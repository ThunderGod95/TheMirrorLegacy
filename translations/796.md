# Chapter 796: Purple Mansion Forethought

'One hundred and eighty *ren* long, and three *zhang* and two *chi* in circumference!'

Li Zhouluo quickly made the calculation. The main hall on the isle was three hundred and eighteen *chi* long. A single one of these "Purple Geng Broad Valley Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails" was as long as four main halls. Stood on end, it would be taller than twelve Inherited Clarity Gates stacked together...

And a circumference of three *zhang* and two *chi* meant it was as wide as a small hut. Furthermore, these Profound Nails certainly wouldn't be made of ordinary metal; they would require an admixture of spiritual items. The materials needed had reached terrifying levels!

Li Xuanxuan was also visibly shocked. He accepted the scroll with both hands and looked at the densely packed list of spiritual materials, a chill rising in his heart. His expression remained calm as he asked, "These thirty-two Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails... what is their main component? What is their approximate value?"

Wen Wu cupped his hands. "The main body only uses iron essence and copper essence. The Eastern Sea has plenty of those. My Purple Smoke Gate has markets in the Eastern Sea and several small mining islands. We will deliver it in batches; Senior need not worry."

"As for the cost, it is not excessive. The iron and copper essences just require labor, and your esteemed clan can smelt them yourselves. Our people will handle the runes, formation patterns, and forging for your clan. Only the other spiritual materials need to be procured by your clan. I estimate... around ninety spirit stones."

He paused, then added, "Per nail."

Li Xuanxuan scanned the scroll back and forth, picking out several materials required in large quantities to study. He spoke in his aged voice, "We don't need to trouble the Blessed Land for everything. Many of these spiritual materials can be sourced from our own Lake."

"Qingwu, Wuhui Spirit Molybdenum, and Mishui Cold Iron are three minerals abundant at the bottom of the lake. Both production and reserves are vast, and we have been excavating them regularly over the years. Shu-White Copper, Fufu Lapis-Iron... these eight types are all produced on the Western shore. The Eastern shore also has Cuiyuan Copper Essence and other such items. Most of these can cover the requirements."

Li Xuanxuan was no longer managing the clan's assets, so while he knew the inventory list, he didn't know the specific quantities. There was also "Yecai Stone" produced on Zongquan Island, but the amount required wasn't large, and Zongquan Island wasn't public knowledge, so Li Xuanxuan didn't mention it to him.

As soon as he finished speaking, Li Zhouluo had already started calculating. He nodded slightly. "We produce these items in-house. The remaining cost can be lowered to sixty or seventy spirit stones. Also... please wait a moment, you two."

He retrieved a jade slip from the desk, checking it against the purple-gold scroll. A strange look crossed his face. "There are some... heirlooms left by the ancestors, and some spiritual materials gathered from the wilderness. These match up. They match up perfectly. I will give the list to you later..."

Wen Wu nodded cheerfully, seeming entirely unsurprised. He bowed. "These thirty-two Profound Nails are very troublesome, especially the materials. Bulk procurement will cause prices to soar, so we cannot rush it. It probably won't be finished even in three to five years. I must ask the Patriarch to designate a resting place on the isle for our Blessed Land's cultivators. Many sect cultivators will be traveling in the vicinity or journeying back and forth from the sect for handovers. We will have to trouble your clan."

"But please rest assured, everyone from my sect has sworn a spiritual oath. They are all elites and will absolutely maintain secrecy. Not only will the formation patterns be drawn separately and the components forged separately, but they will not even know the names of the components or the formation itself."

"How can you say that? It is Moongaze that must thank the Blessed Land."

The two exchanged pleasantries. Wen Wu also had spiritual materials and pills to deliver to Li Quexi's family, and the Purple Smoke cultivators on the isle still needed arranging, so he departed early.

The great doors of the hall closed tightly. Li Xuanxuan frowned. "Zhouluo, what 'ancestral heirlooms' and 'wilderness materials'? Those are just one or two items. How can they be used for the immense quantities needed for the Mountain-Piercing Nails? How much could that possibly save?"

Li Zhouluo no longer concealed the strange look on his face. "Elder, this will save at least twenty spirit stones in expenses! Twenty per nail, times thirty-two nails... that's six hundred and forty spirit stones!"

Li Xuanxuan was thoroughly shocked. "Where did this come from!"

Li Zhouluo looked somewhat awkward. "This... Elder, you don't know. Back when the Profound Peak Gate collapsed and Kong Guxi moved his mountain into the wilderness, he was terrified of a sudden raid by the White Ye Immortal Sect emptying his vaults. He stored a large amount of spiritual materials with our family..."

"Later... the wilderness was also gone. Kong Guxi packed his valuables and came to the Eastern Shore, but the materials remained stored with us. Finally, the Profound Peak Dao lineage vanished. Kong Guxi didn't even want to take back the large batches of Embyronic Breathing and Qi Refining materials. He only packed up the treasure medicines. The rest... he either gifted away or sold cheaply, currying favor with many factions..."

"The bulk of the materials was enormous. Selling it suddenly would crash the price, and selling in batches would have taken five or ten years... After all, no single family was willing to buy it all. So, half-selling and half-gifting, he gave it all to our family as a favor."

Li Zhouluo looked bewildered. "Now, reading this scroll and checking it, I find that nearly eighty to ninety percent of the items listed are things produced or stockpiled by the Profound Peak Gate! And this is *after* the Profound Peak mountain gate was lost and Kong Guxi took a batch of materials back with him. If we had obtained the complete assets of the Profound Peak Gate, we might not have had to spend a single spirit stone to forge these thirty-two Profound Nails!"

Only then did Li Xuanxuan understand. He hesitated, then sat down in the hall. "This matter was arranged in advance by the Daoist Master. Given the Profound Peak Gate's current situation, they have probably figured things out. Otherwise, where would this formation design suddenly come from..."

The elder’s expression grew wary. "The matter of the 'Purple Geng Broad Valley Mountain-Piercing Profound Nails' must remain secret. The name, especially, must not be leaked. Since the Purple Smoke side is maintaining secrecy, it's even easier for us. Do not mention the mountain. Do not mention 'Geng'. It's best not to even mention 'Profound.' If anyone absolutely must ask, just say they are called the 'Thirty-two Prefecture Purple-Broad Spirit Needles.'"

Li Zhouluo respectfully agreed. The elder coughed. "Let Cui Jueyin handle the matters regarding the spiritual materials and the Blessed Land. His cultivation is high, he acts decisively, and he's more capable than the others on the isle."

The elder gave instructions for a while longer, then left the main hall. He took out the carp-shaped wooden boxes from his sleeve, found a seat in an empty side hall, and opened them.

The first box was from Li Quexi. The child had clearly worked hard in the sect; her handwriting was much more elegant. She generally asked about family affairs and Li Xuanxuan's health. It was three pages long. At the very end, she added a note:

*'Purple Smoke has many strange and rare spiritual items. Junior received an award in the competition and also has a quota for requisitions. If the family is in urgent need of anything, you can ask junior.'*

The elder put the letter down. Li Queyi's letter was clearly much thicker. Compared to her sister Li Quexi , who had Wen Wu personally deliver her family letter, Queyi had piled letters for everyone here. Li Xuanxuan picked out his own. The girl offered greetings, then specifically asked if her father, Li Zhoufang, was still seeking favors all day. The rest of the letter beat around the bush for a long time before asking if the family could send her three types of cultivation resources.

Li Xuanxuan looked at it for a moment. He had two of the three resources in his own storage bag, and the last one wasn't hard to collect. He decided to just cover it himself. He also took out several medicinal pills to send back, packed everything together, and wrote a reply for someone to deliver.

He sorted the remaining letters to be delivered to the others, tucked both sisters' letters into his sleeve, and returned to Mount Qingdu alone via a side corridor.

'This world really turns things upside down,' he thought. 'Li Queyi was diligent and reached Qi Refining early, yet she ended up on Ziqi Peak. If she had slacked off in her childhood and been one step slower, Mu Zuo Peak definitely would have taken her... Li Quexi is aloof and proud, her talent less obvious, yet because she was born two years later, she ended up on Mu Zuo Peak.'

'That fellow Wen Wu knows how to teach and is willing to teach. Li Quexi also seems willing to learn... Her flaws in temperament are being corrected. From resources to background, the difference between them is like clouds and mud. She is poised to soar to the heavens...'

Li Xuanxuan was old and had seen many things. He had a vague premonition about the future. Seeing these two letters from the sisters left him feeling extremely conflicted.

Li Xuanxuan returned to Mount Qingdu , but Pingya Island was bustling. Li Zhouluo quickly arranged matters, settling the Purple Smoke Gate cultivators on the isle in the eastern sector. He then gave instructions to summon Cui Jueyin. For a time, the area was bright with lamps and filled with clamor.

The western courtyards, however, were quiet and dark. Ding Weizeng was just riding the wind back down into his courtyard. The burly, tiger-whiskered man looked anxious. Seeing the maidservant at the door, he asked, "How is the mistress?"

The maidservant lowered her head. "The mistress has had a poor appetite these past few days and often complains of stomach pain..."

Ding Weizeng had married his wife, Mistress Ma, in Jiangbei. Back then, Ding Weizeng was just a minor Qi Refining cultivator. Later, he submitted to the Purple Mansion Immortal Clan, and his status rose like a boat on the tide. Prestigious families often offered him their women, but Ding Weizeng refused them all, remaining loyal to Mistress Ma. It was already difficult for cultivators to bear children, even more so when both parents were cultivators. They had finally managed this one pregnancy. Now three months along, the burly man treasured it dearly.

He went in to check on his wife and helped regulate her body. He was preparing to return to Mount Qingdu immediately when his nephew came up to report.

"Wang Quwan requests an audience."

Ding Weizeng froze. The clan had not assigned any new tasks. His current duty was to patrol the lake and protect Li Zhouming and his father. His movements were irregular. Logically, they shouldn't have run into each other. He immediately grew suspicious. "Such a coincidence?"

His nephew replied, "Lord Wang has been coming every single day recently. But sir, you said you would see no one, so the message was never presented. Lord Wang seems to have urgent business; he has been waiting on the isle for you."

"So that's how it is." Ding Weizeng wanted no part in the various factions' struggles and had always refused all visitors. But Wang Quwan was an exception. This man had also been promoted by Li Ximing and was very important. "In that case, let him come up."

Before long, a middle-aged man strode into the courtyard. He had an extraordinary bearing, with a blue-gold treasured sword hanging at his waist, giving him a heroic look. Ding Weizeng laughed.

"Daoist Friend Wang, you've arrived! I haven't yet had the chance to congratulate you... That 'Jingxi Qing' sword of yours has made all the cultivators in Jiangbei and Funan sick with envy... They are all praising you as the foremost sword cultivator in Jiangbei now!"

"Senior jests... I was merely favored by the Daoist Master and seized the initiative... managing to come out on top, that's all."

Although Ding Weizeng now called him Daoist Friend, Wang Quwan remained polite and observed the etiquette of a junior. "Senior's affairs are important, and Quwan does not wish to delay clan business. However, I have encountered a thorny and confusing matter related to Jiangbei, and I have come specifically to ask for Senior's guidance."

Ding Weizeng indeed did not want to waste time. He made an inviting gesture. Wang Quwan said gravely:

"After this junior broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and paid respects to the seniors on the Lake, I received the clan's order to stand guard in Jiangbei. After I passed the Funan border, I heard considerable unrest among the cultivators there. Upon careful inquiry, there is a rumor... a rumor that an opportunity is about to manifest in Jiangbei..."

"Haha, and I wondered what it was." Ding Weizeng shook his head, explaining with a smile, "Anywhere... as long as there is spiritual activity, don't rumors fly every other day? Did Quwan hear some specific news?"

Ding Weizeng also hailed from Jiangbei and was naturally familiar with his homeland. Too many cultivators had fallen in Jiangbei during the past north-south conflicts. When he was young, every ten or fifteen days there was a new rumor about some cultivator obtaining someone's Dao lineage. It was common. Wang Quwan was a highly reliable man; he wouldn't bring this up without conclusive evidence. Sure enough, when asked, Wang Quwan spoke obliquely.

"The Wang clan migrated to Jiangbei back during the Ning State era. Our relatives are widespread. Although my branch declined and I was born of humble means, I still have two relatives... further north."

Ding Weizeng's gaze sharpened. He cut him off: "The Golden Tang Gate or the Capital immortals Dao?"

Wang Quwan said quietly, "The Chengyun Gate!"

Seeing Ding Weizeng nod thoughtfully, Wang Quwan continued, "I heard... two cultivators from overseas sought refuge with the Chengyun Gate and brought news. That ancient lineage from the Jiangbei region, the Wanling Upper Sect, has an underground palace. It is located right beneath the Chengshui Marsh. This palace is a complex maze with many entrances... and they hold three profound stone tokens that are the keys to opening its formation..."

"Oh?" Ding Weizeng watched him intently, saying only that. Wang Quwan retrieved an object from his sleeve.

"I obtained this when I intercepted a demonic cultivator."

Wang Quwan lowered his gaze. In his hand lay a small, exquisite token, displaying an ink-wash pattern of black and white. On it were carved the two ancient seal characters: "Wanling." Gently turning it over, the back read three words:

"South Seventh."

He presented the token to Ding Weizeng with both hands. The burly man held it up, feeling an icy chill on contact. He gripped it suddenly with five fingers, but the token didn't budge.

This token didn't seem like a powerful Dharma artifact, yet he couldn't discern its grade. It secretly held the radiance of a divine ability and was abnormally sturdy. Ding Weizeng gently placed the token on the desk.

"This position of mine... I cannot move or leave it. I naturally have no opportunity to break away. If Quwan is looking for me to accompany him, I'm afraid I must disappoint you... I wonder what Quwan's intentions are..."

But Wang Quwan rose and bowed deeply. "I request that Senior submit this to the main clan on my behalf, and let the masters handle it!"

Ding Weizeng was stunned. He frowned. "This is *your* opportunity..."

Wang Quwan shook his head. "One only does what one's abilities allow. I am just a minor character who has barely broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. How could I participate in the games of such an ancient Dao lineage? I only hope to offer it to the main clan, that it might provide an advantage in the contests between the great families. That would be making the best use of it."

His words made Ding Weizeng noncommittal. Wang Quwan was at the Foundation Establishment Realm and a sword cultivator, personally promoted by the Daoist Master. As long as he didn't lose his mind and try to touch Purple Mansion level benefits, making a huge profit wouldn't be difficult. This was likely a feint—retreating in order to advance.

Ding Weizeng replied, "Moongaze is not a stingy main clan. If this is truly an opportunity you found, no one on the Lake will steal it... At most, I will go up and ask about this matter for you. It would be best to probe for more details to facilitate your trip north."

This response truly exceeded Wang Quwan's expectations. He was, after all, only an external Foundation Establishment cultivator. He assumed that once the opportunity was submitted, it would go to some young master or Ding Weizeng himself. He truly hadn't thought it would have anything to do with him. He stammered, "This..."

"This what?" Ding Weizeng held the token, laughing. "The Lake has always been fairest toward external clans, guest retainers, and protectors... You don't stay on the isle often, so you don't know. Even a direct descendant of the dignified Purple Mansion wouldn't dare insult a Qi Refining guest retainer without reason. I have even less interest in taking your opportunity... Let's go to the main hall together. It will also put your mind at ease!"
