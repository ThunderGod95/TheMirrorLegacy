# Chapter 688: An Underworld Registration

**The Azure Pond Sect.**

Green peaks pierced the sky, wreathed in clouds and mist. The grand hall shone with the light of magical arts, its vermillion gates and high eaves marking it as a place of power. Corridors wound through the complex, and the fragrant smoke of incense curled through the air, painting a picture of a true immortal sect.

A streak of clear light shot across the sky, halting before the stairs. It resolved into a man wearing an ornate crown. He took the steps two at a time, crossed the immortal threshold, and hurried into the hall where a middle-aged man sat at the head seat, brush in hand, focused on a painting.

The crowned man’s expression was anxious, but the middle-aged man preempted him, pulling him over to look at the work. The painting depicted a tall, stately peach tree, around which three flood-dragon serpents were coiled, each baring its claws and fangs.

The serpent on the right was fat and bloated, but the poisonous stinger on its tail gleamed wickedly. The one on the left was small, thin, and weak, but its eyes were dotted with gold lacquer and its form was wreathed in vermillion clouds. The one in the center was powerful and majestic, yet it carried an air of old age.

The middle-aged man smiled. “Fellow Daoist Dantai, what do you think of this painting?”

The crowned man, Dantai Jin, had no choice but to pause and study the artwork. After a moment, he replied in a placid tone, “Sect Master, your skill is sublime… excellent. But the space beneath the tree is empty. Adding a deep pond would give it more depth.”

“Hahahaha!” Si Yuanli roared with laughter and clapped him on the shoulder. “Brother, what a fine eye you have.”

Dantai Jin bowed in return, then lowered his voice. “My spirit falcon has returned from the north. At the Zi hour, the sky over Moongaze Lake brightened. Purple flames soared from Mount Wu, and rainbow clouds billowed—a true Bright Yang phenomenon. The effects will likely spread to envelop the entire lake.”

“Hah!” Si Yuanli’s head snapped up, his gaze sharp. He shook his head and sighed. “Alas! Li Ximing has perished!”

Dantai Jin frowned. “According to my earlier deductions,” he said softly, “he would have entered seclusion twelve to fourteen years ago. For him to reach the Purple Mansion Realm now… the timing is indeed a bit too short.”

“Too short is an understatement!” Si Yuanli shook his head. “Pushing an Immortal Foundation into the Shengyang Acupoint takes a decade. Even with the pill from the Xiao family and all the treasures he prepared himself, it would take five years at the minimum! The Li family lacks the deep foundations of an ancient house, and Li Ximing is no Tu Longjian.”

“Manifesting a divine power is even more perilous—that requires another six years. I never discussed the Dao with him, so I have no idea how deep his understanding of Bright Yang is. Let’s be generous and assume he consumed the Radiant Sky Stone and, by some great stroke of luck, passed that trial.”

“But after that comes the trial of oblivion, which can easily last more than a decade!” he sighed, grinding fresh cyan ink for his brush. “For a phenomenon to appear now can only mean one thing—he has died!”

Seeing him turn back to the paper to paint the pond, Dantai Jin pressed, “But the phenomenon is vast and extraordinary.”

“Because he consumed the Radiant Sky Stone!” Si Yuanli said, still shaking his head. “That is a Purple Mansion-grade treasure. How could the resulting phenomenon not be vast? The stone corresponds directly to the Radiant Origin Pass. Even you, Dantai Jin, might not have such favorable conditions. He is a Wei Li, he cultivated Bright Yang, and he consumed a Purple Mansion treasure. Such a grand spectacle is only natural upon his death.”

Dantai Jin frowned. “Is there no chance he succeeded?”

Si Yuanli paused to think. “It was a possibility. He is a Wei Li, after all. Perhaps his family possessed some secret art that gave him an advantage with Bright Yang, which is why he dared to use the stone… but do you think our superiors wouldn't have anticipated that?”

“As long as he used it, we didn't have to worry. The trial of oblivion would trap him for decades. What would it matter if he eventually succeeded? By then, Li Zhouwei would have long been dealt with. It would have been good if he had managed to become a Bright Yang Purple Mansion cultivator—being in the north, he would have been a perfect shield against the Buddhist cultivators… A pity… he has perished.”

“Besides,” Si Yuanli added, “I heard he was a soft man. Even if he passed the divine power trial, how could he possibly endure the infinite illusions? It was all for naught.”

Dantai Jin was finally silenced. He waited quietly as Si Yuanli finished the painting and handed it to him.

Dantai Jin unrolled it. A small pond now lay beneath the peach tree. The serpent on the left was now half-submerged, its body obscured by the pond’s edge, making it appear even smaller and weaker than before.

Leaving the main peak, Si Yuanli flew on a cloud to another summit. A solitary pavilion stood there, seemingly suspended in the mist. Countless jade talismans hung from its eaves, swaying and chiming in the breeze.

“Fellow Daoist Xizhi!”

Si Yuanli stepped into the pavilion and found Li Xizhi engrossed in a jade slip. He had aged into a middle-aged man, still carrying an air of refined nobility, though his years as the pavilion master had clearly lent him a more scholarly grace.

“Greetings, Sect Master!” Li Xizhi rose at once to welcome him.

Si Yuanli, not daring to be arrogant, quickly steadied him, a deep apprehension in his heart. ‘So many years have passed. I wonder how powerful his arts have become!’

In the entire Azure Pond Sect, the only person Si Yuanli truly feared was the man before him.

In his eyes, Li Xizhi’s cunning was unfathomable. He was clearly a prodigy in the Dao of arts, yet since joining the sect as a teenager, he had never once displayed his talent. He had probably even fooled Yuan Tuan!

‘He didn’t even reveal his true power when Tuoba Chongyuan was hunting him, when his life was on the line!’

It wasn’t until the battle at the Sea of Reefs that Si Yuanli learned that this man was the true genius of the Li family’s ‘Xi’ generation. His talent for magical arts even surpassed that of Yu Muxian, who had once been hailed as a prodigy!

‘If his wife weren’t a member of the Yang family… I would have certainly arranged a marriage alliance to bind him to my cause… Ah well, the current arrangement is not so bad.’

His thoughts were heavy, but his face was a mask of concern. “Xizhi,” he said in a low voice, “there has been trouble at Moongaze Lake!”

Li Xizhi’s expression shifted, his brow furrowing. Si Yuanli recounted the events, his words completely different from those he had shared with Dantai Jin. He spoke of Li Ximing with tact and subtlety, approaching the subject from all angles.

Li Xizhi himself knew a fair amount about the trials of the Purple Mansion Realm. As he listened to Si Yuanli’s account, his heart went hollow. He slowly closed his eyes and exhaled. “Sect Master,” he said softly, “you mean to say… my brother… has likely failed his breakthrough and perished.”

Si Yuanli nodded hesitantly. “Not necessarily… perhaps he succeeded…”

Li Xizhi knew it was mere politeness. He stood in silence for several breaths before saying respectfully, “Thank you for informing me, Sect Master. I must ask you to excuse me.”

Si Yuanli nodded in understanding and departed on the wind. Li Xizhi saw him off, then, holding himself together by sheer will, stumbled back into the pavilion. He closed his eyes, and tears began to fall. They glistened on the man’s face as five words escaped his lips.

‘Ming’er… had it so hard…’

Li Xizhi’s eyes narrowed. He forced the tears back with his spiritual qi as he pulled out a letter from his desk and began to write, his heart growing colder by the second.

‘Since Ming’er has failed and perished, Grandfather must be heartbroken… Of the Xi generation, only I remain. Everyone is scheming against my family’s heir. Even if I have to risk my life and my cultivation, I must protect Zhouwei…’

***

As dawn broke, the purple flames on Mount Wu surged toward the heavens. Clumps of white gardenias rolled along the fiery currents at the summit, and pale golden sand swirled in the air.

Mount Wu, once composed of basalt with reddish-brown soil, had been utterly transformed. The earth had turned a lacquer black, and the stones had cracked, all of them taking on the hue of Radiant Sky Stone. The entire mountain had become a domain of Bright Yang. The grand formation that once protected it had shifted, its power greatly diminished.

Amidst the rolling spiritual sand and blooming gardenias, Li Ximing reacquainted himself with his body. His Cinnabar Sea was filled with heavenly glows, and his Juque Palace was a space of pure, clear light. The snow from before had long since melted, the celestial light within it transmuting into Bright Yang Purple Flames that now flowed freely through the acupoint.

‘Fire soars in the heart, with Yang and Ming as its exterior and interior. Thus is the Radiant Splendor divine power achieved. Its radiance extends over nine feet, emitting purple flames as rainbow clouds rise and fade…’

Li Ximing had not understood the scripture before, but now it was perfectly clear. ‘Fire soars in the heart’ naturally referred to the Juque Palace. The Bright Yang Purple Flames accumulated there, ready to be unleashed with a single thought.

‘Golden armor and golden robes descend from the sky. The sun glows red in the east, and Baleful Earth erupts in the south. Then one roams the Great Void to temper the golden lotus…’

The morning sun was brilliant, but there were no signs of golden-clad soldiers. Perhaps it was because his divine power had not yet manifested externally. He paused, then swept his spiritual sense over the southern face of Mount Wu.

There, the Bright Yang Purple Flames burned with particular intensity, shattering the Radiant Sky-colored stone. Jets of reddish-black Baleful Earth Qi gushed from the ground, only to be suppressed by the purple flames and confined to a small patch of land.

‘This must be “the sun glows red in the east, and Baleful Earth Qi erupts in the south”! My ascension has greatly benefited this mountain, turning it into a Bright Yang treasured land. This Baleful qi is extraordinary. It can be used for alchemy and smithing, and perhaps I can even extract some form of Bright Yang qi from it.’

He sat for a few moments, and then the Great Void seemed to hum. Two figures materialized beside him.

Li Ximing lifted his head slightly, his eyes once more a pale gold. The point of celestial light at his brow pulsed, and the grey aura cloaking the two figures dissolved, revealing their true forms.

One was short and squat, with two horns sprouting from his forehead. He wore a simple grey cloth draped around his neck. His face was hideous; his eyes were set so far to the sides that only half of each was visible from the front. His teeth were long and thin, his pupils a dark, murky green. In his hand, he clutched a grey brush as long as a pestle.

The other was a head taller, his body draped in strings of copper coins. His face was unnaturally long and wide, stretching all the way down to his chest. His nose bisected his face, and his eyes were a startling pink. He was struggling to hold a massive book.

The horned one stepped forward and gave a casual bow. His voice was shrill and reedy.

“Greetings, Fellow Daoist! I am Wang Long, an envoy from the Underworld Bureau of the Netherworld. Good news… good news! You have achieved a divine power, and I have come on behalf of my colleagues to offer congratulations! Congratulations, congratulations! May you transcend life and death, perfect your divine power, master the five arts, avoid the great calamity, attain fruition early, and achieve truth hereafter…!”

He rattled off a string of four-character blessings in his piercing voice. When he finally finished, the long-faced man beside him added, “Congratulations, congratulations!”

Wang Long then bowed to introduce his partner. “This is my companion, Zhang Gui.”

“So you are esteemed envoys from the Underworld Bureau!”

‘No wonder they arrived so quickly,’ Li Ximing thought, returning their salute.

Wang Long’s shrill voice cut in. “Is this the ‘Radiant Origin Pass’?”

Zhang Gui, his long face impassive, glanced at Li Ximing for a moment. “Correct,” he replied. “The style is ancient. It’s the ‘Audience with the Celestial Gate’ of the Wei Li. Fellow Daoist’s version is not the orthodox one. It’s likely a simplified variant practiced by a collateral imperial branch that guarded the northern border. It is called ‘Radiant Origin Pass’.”

“Good, good, good,” Wang Long chirped. He immediately turned to Li Ximing. “Your surname and given name?”

Having just endured the trial of infinite illusions, the request for his name made him hesitate. The words caught in his throat for a second before he answered calmly, “I am Li Ximing of the Li Clan. ‘Xi’ as in the heavenly dawn, ‘Ming’ as in the sun and moon.”

The moment he finished speaking, the brush in Wang Long’s hand flashed, and ink welled at its tip. The horned man nudged his long-faced, book-carrying companion. “Have you found it yet!”

Zhang Gui remained as slow as ever, his hand tracing lines across the page as he searched. He made no sound. Wang Long was clearly impatient. He ignored his partner and began muttering to Li Ximing.

“Honestly… a few True Monarch-level figures, why must they fight? They punched a hole in the sky, and several True Monarchs went to watch in person, stirring up trouble in heaven and on earth.”

“Fellow Daoist, on my way here, I heard a piece of flesh fell from the sky in the State of Wu. It was as large as a city and rotted the surrounding lands. I wonder who was so displeased… sigh…”

He grumbled on, a worried expression on his half-ghostly face. “And I don’t know if Fellow Daoist Si will be able to break through to the Golden Core Realm. If not… we won’t be able to collect this century’s quota of Metallic Essence!”

Li Ximing gave a noncommittal grunt. Unsure of the customs of these Underworld officials, he held his tongue. Wang Long’s impatience grew with every passing second. He spun around, his reedy voice sharp with irritation as he snapped at the long-faced Zhang Gui.

“Old friend, what time is it! You’re dragging your feet! When those old geezers find out, they’ll accuse us of neglecting the affairs of the departed, and you’ll be the one to suffer!”

Zhang Gui looked from side to side, then slammed the massive book shut. He knitted his barely-there brows, making his face even more grotesque. “I can’t find him,” he answered slowly.

Wang Long froze. He grabbed the book’s cover, shoved with both hands, and with a grunt of effort, sent the great tome tumbling to the ground. It immediately fell apart into several smaller volumes, scattering everywhere.

“How could you make a mistake like this?” he shrieked. “Did you copy all this for nothing?”

The two Underworld envoys seemed to be in a tremendous hurry. They scrambled about, frantically searching through the scattered books. Li Ximing glanced down. The volumes were of various colors, and his spiritual sense passed right through them as if they weren't there.

‘Dharma power probably can’t lift these books, and I doubt any arts would affect them… I wonder if I could pick one up with my divine power.’

The two were hunched over, grabbing volumes and flipping rapidly through the pages. The air filled with the rustling sound.

*Rustle, rustle…*

Li Ximing took the opportunity to look down at the volume by his feet. It had a purple-and-gold cover bound with several white cords, making it the most distinguished of the lot. In the swirling purple flames, it was flipping its own pages, coming to rest at the very last one. An inscription ran down the side of the page:

“Registry of Purple Mansion Divine Powers Observed by the Five-Directional Emissaries of Jiao and Yang Provinces—Compiled by the Record-Keeping Ghost, Zhang Gui.”

At the very top of the page, a line of golden text was inscribed in ancient intaglio script, which Li Ximing recognized at once.

“On the third day of the second month in the 697th year of the Yin-time Earth Virtue Cycle, the cultivator, Daoist Master Guanxuan, Yang Tianya, of the Guli tribe of Yangzhou, currently in the territory of the Azure Pond Mountain, achieved a divine power.”

Directly beneath that golden line was another:

“On the twenty-third day of the eleventh month in the 698th year of the Yin-time Earth Virtue Cycle, the cultivator, Daoist Master Houfu, Lin Wei, of the Wuzhong tribe of Jiaozhou, currently in the territory of Linhai Commandery, achieved a divine power.”

Li Ximing’s heart jolted.

He knew both men on the page. Yang Tianya was one, of course, and Daoist Master Houfu was none other than the current head of the Great Xiukui Monastery! The year he broke through was the same year Li Ximing’s clan had been embroiled in the chaos of the Xu Xiao rebellion!

‘Yang Tianya achieved a divine power!’

‘He did it even before Daoist Master Houfu!’
