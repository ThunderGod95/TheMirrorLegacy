# Chapter 947: Scattering of Purple Qi

Li Qinghong picked up the jade slip and found it wasn’t sealed. She could read it the moment she took it. Though she deeply desired it, she still frowned and said, "This is far too valuable."

Kong Tingyun shook her head and softly said, "Sister, take it first. There’s something else I need to talk to you about."

Li Qinghong noticed the seriousness in her expression and had no choice but to set the jade slip down gently. "Please speak, sister."

Kong Tingyun looked at her earnestly, held her hand, and said softly, "Qinghong, does Ximing have the heart to pursue the Purple Mansion Realm?"

Li Qinghong’s heart clenched, and she looked at her with some confusion.

Kong Tingyun hesitated for a second, then spoke seriously, "I know your family has a genius disciple, comparable to Chi Buzi and a revival of the Bright Yang bloodline. Esteemed families have few secrets in Jiangnan. Even Xiao Chuting could only make open moves back then, and was unable to plant hidden ones. All the sects are well aware.

"Wei State has good relations with Green Pine Temple and the Golden Feather Sect, and Emperor Gong of Wei is a wise elder. That’s how the Li Family remained safe in Jiangnan. The Mount Tan Li Family in Wu State doesn’t cultivate the Bright Yang Dao and claims no connection, but their bloodline carries some traces. That alone allows them to stay in Jiangnan, and they have a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator among them. So this path is not impossible.

"Everyone in the Purple Mansion Realm knows the Radiant Sky Stone is reserved for the heir, and that time is still far off. But since I’m a bit closer to your family, I can’t help but notice... does Ximing have his eyes on the Purple Mansion Realm? Is he perhaps coveting that Radiant Sky Stone?"

Her eyes brimmed with worry as she offered heartfelt advice, "Sister, you should know better in this matter. Does Ximing even have a five percent chance to break through? The Radiant Sky Stone doesn’t boost your chances just a little. Without enough secret techniques, it’s not much use even if taken. I’ll be blunt, this isn’t something he should pursue on a whim!"

Li Qinghong’s heart eased. When she saw the sincerity in the round-faced woman’s eyes, she suddenly understood.

No wonder the matter of the Radiant Sky Stone concluded the way it did! The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had already predicted we’d stake everything on Minghuang!

Everything done to conceal Minghuang growing up wasn’t in vain. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators only think he has the Bright Yang bloodline, not that he carries a thread of fate!

Li Qinghong didn’t know how confident Li Zhouwei was about breaking into the Purple Mansion Realm. But having witnessed Guo Shentong, Changxiao, and Tu Longjian rise one after another, she believed the odds were high.

After thinking it through, she spoke up, "What role exactly does the Radiant Sky Stone play in the process of forming divine abilities? I hope sister can shed some light."

Kong Tingyun answered softly, "This isn’t easy to explain. The number of secret techniques varies. May I ask how many your family possesses?"

Li Qinghong’s heart skipped a beat, and a thought flashed through her mind like lightning, I’ll just mention however many secret techniques Ximing has cultivated...

She answered, "Only one..."

Kong Tingyun nodded and replied, "That’s perfectly normal. If one can master even a single secret technique, then after consuming the Radiant Sky Stone, it might only raise their chances by five percent."

Li Qinghong nodded regretfully. Seeing this, Kong Tingyun felt like she had listened and gently continued, "These things depend on the individual, but it absolutely can’t be left to Ximing’s whim... Ancient cultivators could resonate with heaven and earth, so breakthroughs were much easier. Treasures like the Radiant Sky Stone were more effective then. Nowadays, the odds are hard to quantify."

Li Qinghong nodded softly and replied, "I’ll remember what you said, Sister."

Kong Tingyun smiled and nodded, but in her heart, Li Qinghong shook her head. Whether the Radiant Sky Stone went to Ximing or Zhouwei, it was no longer within her power or right to decide.

Xijun obtained this treasure. He must have trusted Ximing, and believed Zhouwei would succeed on his own. At most, he thought Zhouwei might be sabotaged early. But whether the Radiant Sky Stone was kept or not made little difference... thought Li Qinghong.

And she, Li Qinghong, would soon head to the Thunder Arts Grotto Heaven. Li Zhouwei would then be the one managing the household. Would he really lay a hand on Li Ximing’s Radiant Sky Stone?

Before Xijun’s death, she thought Li Ximing might willingly hand over the Radiant Sky Stone. But now, seeing the calm in his eyes, she could tell his thoughts were deeply stubborn. It went without saying.

As for the matter of the Thunder Arts Grotto Heaven, she seems completely unaware. It appears Changxi is too fearful to get involved and has said nothing to her. If I bring it up, it’ll only strain our relationship and offend the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

Kong Tingyun forced the jade slip into her hand, and only then did Li Qinghong finally have the mind to glance at the technique, "...Gather heavenly light, absorb the radiance, draw it into the Juque acupoint, and refine it into a form. This becomes the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. Suppress it with spiritual sense, release it from the center of the eyebrows; it can capture malevolent spirits, sever spiritual energy, and cut through good and evil..."

She skimmed it briefly but still accepted it with thanks. After a short conversation, Li Qinghong brought up her impending trip to the Eastern Sea, and Kong Tingyun readily agreed. The two of them then left Lake Xian and headed south together.

On the other side, Li Zhouwei had just exited the Zhunan Serpent Dragon Palace and was heading toward the Tail Subkingdom. The demon generals on either side carried themselves with far more deference.

The one with bulging cheeks and black armor bowed his head, while the other with a gaping mouth and long whiskers grinned ingratiatingly, "My lord... such righteousness! Our eyes burned with envy seeing a treasure like that, yet you didn’t even take it..."

It was the same two who had brought forth the Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact, so they naturally knew what an astonishing treasure Li Zhouwei had declined. When they saw that even Dingjiao treated him with respect, they couldn’t resist fawning over him. In some ways, demons were no different than humans.

The journey was long, and Li Zhouwei made idle conversation. Then, the black-faced demon general with bulging cheeks suddenly muttered, "My lord has such composure. Guo Shentong couldn’t even bear to look away when he was in front of the same Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact..."

At that, Li Zhouwei grew alert. Inwardly, he thought coldly, Guo Shentong?! The same Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact?

He slowed his pace slightly, gazed into the distance, and smiled as he said, "I’ve heard of him. He’s the master of Crimson Reef Island."

The two demons had been offering dry flattery, but seeing that he’d taken an interest, they finally seized the chance to speak and were overjoyed.

The long-whiskered, wide-mouthed demon said, "My lord! The two of us served the crown prince early on, before he even left the palace and when he was still following the Dragon King of Jin[1] Sea... Guo Shentong once came to the Dragon King’s palace and took a command token with him. It was also a spirit artifact."

A spirit artifact... the Six Ding Merging Fire Token! Guo Shentong may have struck a deal with the dragon kin!

He pondered for a moment. These two demons had rambled for quite a while yet still hadn’t explained why Guo Shentong had received such a reward. It was likely that they had not been qualified to attend court and were simply relaying fragments.

Li Zhouwei softly said, "I wonder how he is now."

The black-armored, thick-jawed demon grunted and replied, "That man birthed a Merging Fire Token. The Bin[2] Crow is short-lived and not too bright. He got better after breaking into the Purple Mansion Realm... but still liked taking dangerous risks. He’s been gone a long time now... likely dead..."

Li Zhouwei could tell the demon didn’t know much. They then continued onward to the Tail Subkingdom, which now looked completely different from before. Lanterns flickered everywhere, and the sand was covered in pristine white clams of various sizes. Several clam spirits in pink-white robes, having taken human form, were opening the shells to search for pearls.

A pink-robed woman approached, holding a basket filled with large, round, luminous pearls. The long-whiskered demon received it and spoke in a low voice, "This is a token of the Tail Subkingdom’s sincerity. Please, my lord, take it back with you..."

Only then did he dare bring it forward, watching Li Zhouwei nervously. The clam spirit fell to her knees with a thud, prostrating herself and crying out, "This lowly one swears on her life, it truly was because I was bearing a pearl that I couldn’t move... I beg you, my lord, to see the truth..."

The surrounding demon generals seemed familiar with her and hurried to speak on her behalf. Li Zhouwei had no interest in determining whether the sea clans had deliberately avoided him earlier.

He simply waved a hand and said, "It’s fine."

He stepped forward, and the two demons escorted him into the palace atop the beast mount. Huiyao had been waiting at the entrance in a daze. When he saw them approaching, a mere glance at the demons’ attitude told him most of what he needed to know.

He bowed respectfully and said, "My lord has returned!"

After Li Zhouwei entered the hall, Huiyao quietly tugged at the demons’ sleeves and whispered, "About those sixty thousand teeth..."

"Forget it!" The two demons casually brushed him off and walked away. Huiyao, relieved, entered the hall, only to meet Li Zhouwei’s piercing gaze.

The young man stood in the center of the chamber and asked, "What matter is this?"

Huiyao bowed lower and respectfully replied, "One of the Dragon Son’s eight consorts required a Dharma robe... it must be made using Sea Hui[1] Fangs. The estimate was sixty thousand pieces, originally to be provided by our tribe. Thanks to the heir, the lives of thirty thousand of our children were spared..."

Li Zhouwei, familiar with Eastern Sea customs, had seen much along the way. Only now did he truly understand how lowly Foundation Establishment Realm demonic creatures such as Huiyao and even the queen of the Tail Subkingdom had to be.

He quietly said, "You’ve always been like this."

"Always have been." Huiyao remained standing and asked in confusion, "It’s been this way for millions of years. Why would it be different? Even before we took human form, we lived like this. Every year, my Hui Clan must absorb the essence qi of thousands upon thousands of spirit crabs... It’s the natural order."

Li Zhouwei gave no reply. He watched Huiyao retreat and continued staring into the wine in his cup.

"Dingjiao doesn’t see me as human... then what about Pristine Water? Is a True Monarch human? A True Monarch is like a dragon; a Foundation Establishment Realm like a Hui; and mortals are just crabs. The world above the sea is no different from the seabed."

He stared into his wine in silence. Though Dingjiao’s palace was extravagantly luxurious, filled with laughter and music, none of it had eased Li Zhouwei’s heart. Instead, the demeanor of the Tail Subkingdom and Huiyao kept swirling in his thoughts.

Li Zhouwei had been mature-minded since childhood. He had seen many kinds of people, and now that he had encountered demonic creatures, he realized there wasn’t much difference. They all loved to devour humans.

He couldn’t help but begin to question, They say the Heavenly Dao is broken, and the world turned out like this. But who can say whether the world became this way... or if it was always this way? If the Heavenly Dao is broken... is it better that all beings be free, or that something above still governs them?

Blood food... blood food... Those who refrain from eating humans lose a third of their power. Can they really contend with those who do?

He had never been ordinary since birth. As thoughts swirled in his mind, he mused, "Right or wrong, it doesn’t matter. Since so many elders are wholeheartedly supporting me, how can I let them down?"

Li Zhouwei lifted the hem of the mat to think for a moment, then put it back casually. The sea outside the palace shifted and came to rest. They had likely arrived at the Hui Clan’s territory.

A cluster of shadows approached, and Huiyao lowered his voice as he drove off the younger ones crowding near, "Go on, go on... all of you, get back..."

Purple Smoke Blessed Land.

Purple mist gathered ceaselessly in the sky, drifting across the mountain peaks in wisps and tendrils, spiraling upward. Pavilions and towers dotted the land, all stunningly beautiful.

A small pavilion stood upon the endless sea of purple mist. A woman in green robes stood to the side, while a female cultivator in purple leaned against the stone steps. Her flowing skirts fell from the high cliff like the mist itself, and halfway down, they dissolved into purple mist.

Her brows were slightly flat, and her face habitually calm. A rare hint of confusion flickered in her eyes as she gazed far into the distance. The purple mist across the blessed land stirred with her every breath, but Kan Xuyu said nothing.

Beside her, Shen Yanqing stood with a trace of sorrow. Purple energy surged from Kan Xuyu’s body as she raised her fingers to divine and thought silently, The items have already been delivered to the dragon kin. Dongfang Lieyun is still honorable enough not to break his word. That bastard Yuan Su has already promoted Li Xuanfeng, and I can no longer touch him. I've at least done my part by going through the dragon kin...

She said softly, "Yanqing, once I fall, you should return home. Your father is in seclusion, and the Shen Family needs someone to take charge."

Shen Yanqing responded with a nod. The small pavilion was shielded by formations, so there was no fear of being overheard by those in the Purple Mansion Realm above. She murmured, "If Master is reborn and has any requests, just send a letter to my Shen Family... I will always be waiting..."

"There’s no need," Kan Xuyu let out a faint chuckle and shook her head gently, her voice barely audible.

She mentally compared the faces of the Li Family with the one buried deep in her heart, but found no resemblance. Her thoughts drifted, and she spat inwardly, He must be a descendant of one of his family brothers... hmph... surely he wouldn’t have had some illegitimate child behind my back...

Her eyes lit up for a brief moment, and her cold expression melted into a shy smile. But the light vanished just as quickly, and Kan Xuyu looked out toward the sky.

Quite a few had come to witness the ceremony. Though most had believed she would rely on that trace of Metallic Essence to reincarnate and wouldn't achieve much, she was, after all, one of those indebted to Li Jiangqun. So, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators held no small amount of hope.

Purple qi surged skyward from Kan Xuyu’s body, drawing all the purple and crimson hues in the sky toward her. The clouds turned into a pure purple cluster, falling upon her in waves. A purple glow emerged at the center of her brow. She joined two fingers, placed them to her lips, and exhaled a breath of purple qi.

This purple qi was entirely different from the vast purple around her. It was more ethereal, and was tinged with traces of pale white. It was just a single wisp, but it hovered before her and slowly condensed into a pill-like shape.

In that instant, the world echoed with the chanting of Daoist scriptures. The scent of incense filled the air as the mountain ranges of Purple Smoke Blessed Land stirred with a low rumble. Deer raised their heads, and birds fell silent.

Heavenly Cultivation Purple Qi Immortal Origin Metallic Essence!

Purple energy burst across the mountain range. A dense script appeared on every falling leaf. The incense sticks in every burner across the mountain went out on their own, quivering like living beings. Ashes crawled back up the wicks, slowly returning to their unlit form.

The woman in the sky looked like a goddess riding mist, yet sparkling tears rolled down her cheeks. Kan Xuyu was filled with overwhelming joy.
𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑛𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮

Brother Jiangqun, I've finally made it through these four hundred years!

The brilliant radiance of the condensed Purple Essence surged into the sky. All the wisps of purple mist she had once scattered across the heavens with her divine abilities were now rushing back, carrying the chanting from every corner of Yue State, all converging into the cluster of qi before her.

But Kan Xuyu suddenly stopped, letting out a quiet sigh.

While all the cultivators marveled at Zipei’s profound cultivation, two shadows high in the sky exchanged glances, both showing surprise.

One of them spoke in a sharp voice, "She... Thankfully we brought the Nine-Layer Attribute Net for her!"
