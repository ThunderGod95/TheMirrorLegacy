# Chapter 1125: Taking Action

Li Ximing finished his arrangements. He settled cross-legged on the mountain, closed his eyes, and began refining a batch of pills. Light and shadow intertwined around him. Soon, there was a disturbance. A hot gust of wind swept in, and a faint golden light sprinkled down upon the wards. At the same time, the jade pendant at his waist pulsed with intense heat.

'Minghuang is here!'

A smile touched Li Ximing's lips as he rose, treading on the light. As expected, the clouds and mist parted to reveal a young man descending from the sky. He wore a black robe adorned with golden patterns, his long hair tied back simply. His features were majestic, and his bright golden eyes radiated a fierce, soul-shaking pressure. A pale white scroll was fastened at his waist.

Daoist Master Bao Xiang had moved even faster, already waiting in the air. Her cultivation was in Pit Water, which was deeply incompatible with Bright Yang. A single glance at the newcomer sent her divine abilities screaming in warning, filling her with an unprecedented sense of crisis. Her expression was a mixture of awe and dread. When she saw Li Ximing approach, she quickly took a step back.

"So, it is King Wei..."

Li Ximing laughed heartily, introduced Bao Xiang with a flick of his sleeve, and then led Li Zhouwei inside. The Daoist Master hastily spoke,

"This junior failed to welcome you from afar... please, do not take offense..."

Li Ximing had learned a few things during his stay. Based on Daoist Master Bao Xiang's seniority, she was indeed from the same generation as Jiangqian. Calling herself "junior" was not mere politeness. He smiled and led them into the mountain. After a few brief pleasantries, the Daoist Master tactfully excused herself, leaving the two to talk privately. Li Ximing then began.

"Everything is settled. And I've received some good news."

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei asked with a smile. Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"On the coast of the Western Sea, near the Abyss of Weak Water, there's an old rogue cultivator. He's in desperate need of a Precious Heart Mystic Swan Pill. When he heard I was here, he traveled all this way to find me. And, according to him... he has a Verdant Profound Sarcophagus."

A thoughtful look crossed Li Zhouwei's face.

"I've heard of it. It's a Mansion Water spiritual item, not particularly famous, nor does it have many uses. It was supposedly recovered from an immortal cave in the Western Sea. The best part, however... is that there wasn't just one."

He sighed.

"I assumed the Western Sea, being one of the Four Seas, would have _something_. But after a tour, 'barren' is the only word for it. It's slightly better than Zhulu, I suppose, with a few more Mansion Water spiritual items. But the environment is harsh, and betrayal is rampant. Aside from a handful of truly powerful figures, the vast majority of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators dare not leave the protection of their own Dao Lineage."

"Their divine abilities are so weak they can't even establish a Purple Mansion grand array. They can only resort to underhanded schemes to gather resources. As for Purple Mansion-grade spiritual items... those are mostly found in ancient immortal caves."

"That particular immortal cave only emerged a few years ago. The spiritual item was suppressed by the cave's grand array. There were five of them in total, and they were divided among five Daoist Masters."

Hearing this, Li Zhouwei already understood his intention.

"Since there are several of them, and it's a Mansion Water spiritual item only recently acquired... Grand-Uncle, you're planning to use the Piting Qingyuan Treasure Cauldron."

Li Ximing nodded with a smile.

"The beauty of it is... that Host Shehu also has a Verdant Profound Sarcophagus. The rogue cultivator who approached me intends to trade for it. As for the others, Daoist Master Bao Xiang has one, and our soon-to-be-helper, the rogue cultivator Yin Qin, has another."

"We don't need all four. If we can get just three of them into the Spiritual Artifact and let it nurture and refine them for a few years, we'll undoubtedly get a portion of spiritual water!"

Li Zhouwei nodded thoughtfully, but Li Ximing's expression turned serious.

"I also made inquiries. Legend says the Verdant Profound Sarcophagus is born from Profound Coffin Crimson Water. If we could refine the Profound Coffin Crimson Water itself... that would be a different matter entirely."

"This Profound Coffin Crimson Water is a treasure of water and wood from the lake. It holds the marvel of transformation and the virtue of nurturing. It's incredibly useful, whether for refining Spiritual Artifacts, constructing precious arrays, or even practicing spell arts."

Li Zhouwei didn't comment further, simply nodding in acknowledgment. He changed the subject.

"This Shehu... what is his strength?"

Li Ximing shook his head with a smile.

"I've asked around. He has two Upright Wood divine abilities, but no Life Divine Ability. And I have the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire. I estimate he can't even defeat me."

After a moment's thought, he sighed.

"The problem is our ally, the rogue cultivator Yin Qin. He's the one facing the West Mansion Grotto Sect. The risk is enormous—he's up against Chi She, a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, and there's no telling who else is in their stronghold. So, he made a demand. If this succeeds, he wants half of everything we get from Shehu."

When Li Zhouwei frowned, Li Ximing explained seriously.

"He's the only Western Sea cultivator willing to get involved, and he'll take the public fallout. No one else would. This way, the official story is that he hired us. The West Mansion Grotto Sect is currently powerful... it's far better to let him be the one to offend them and take the heat. There's no need to drag Moongaze Lake into this."

This reasoning, centered on the clan's future, made Li Zhouwei nod. He recalled some news he'd received before departing and understood.

'So that's how it is. In a remote place like the Western Sea, Shehu is hiding a spiritual root. This Yin Qin must have sensed it and has been plotting to kill him for his treasure all along, just waiting for an opportunity. Everyone is scheming.'

As he was pondering, a faint sound echoed from the mountain. A brilliant multicolored light flared, and Daoist Master Dao Mian returned. He stopped at the foot of the steps, staring at Li Zhouwei with a strange expression.

"Greetings, King Wei."

The Daoist Master's pupils glittered, a clear sign of some unusual cultivated art. He bowed slightly, only straightening up after Li Zhouwei acknowledged him. Then, he smiled.

"Congratulations, Zhaojing! When Daoist Friend Xie heard the good news, he was overjoyed. He started calling Daoist Friend Yan 'Old Senior' and has already settled his affairs in the Western Sea and headed east."

This Daoist Master Dao Mian still looked curious, clearly wondering what great benefit Yan Dushui had offered to make Xie Hu leave so readily. Li Ximing, however, was not surprised. He stood up and smiled.

"Daoist friend, what about your Yin Qin?"

Daoist Master Dao Mian clasped his hands.

"He has already been informed. He is just waiting for your word, Daoist friend!"

"Excellent! The matter is settled!"

Li Ximing smiled and nodded. He strode out and summoned Guo Nanwu, explaining the plan in front of everyone.

"Host Shehu has three allies. Daoist Master Xie Hu has departed and is no longer a factor. The threat from the West Mansion Grotto Sect—namely, the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator Chi She—will be handled by Yin Qin. The Demon beasts of Fangya Province, I am leaving to Nanwu."

Guo Nanwu nodded, accepting the assignment. Daoist Master Dao Mian also nodded, looking quite satisfied. Li Ximing continued.

"He may yet have other allies we don't know about. To prevent any surprises, King Wei and I will move together to suppress this fiend!"

Given Li Zhouwei's current power, second only to a Great Daoist Master, Li Ximing's arrangement was anything but careless.

Delays breed complications. The words had barely faded when Li Ximing acted, showing no hesitation. He and the others took to the wind, soaring up and vanishing into the Great Void. The three of them scattered. Daoist Master Dao Mian, meanwhile, retrieved a jade talisman and crushed it, sending the signal to Yin Qin.

Only then did Daoist Master Bao Xiang enter from the courtyard. She paced the garden a few steps as she listened to Daoist Master Dao Mian sigh.

"They always say mainland cultivators are rigid and old-fashioned, but every one I've met is anything but. Even without this Yan Dushui, given their wealth and position at the center of the world, it wouldn't have been difficult for them to summon another mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator to deal with Xie Hu. But their _method_ of handling him... it truly reveals how skilled these righteous paths are at protecting their reputations."

Bao Xiang, being more familiar with Jiangnan, smiled.

"The mainland is full of rules. Dealing with an enemy, as they just did with Xie Hu, plays right into the strengths of their so-called righteous path. My master once said, 'The true skill lies in wielding righteousness.' Anyone can be unscrupulous. Who among those who have achieved a divine ability isn't ruthless at heart?"

"That doesn't mean he is so capable. It's his position at the heart of the world, giving him the resources and information to mobilize others..."

Daoist Master Dao Mian seemed to recall something. A profound desolation and despair settled on his old features. On the verge of tears, he said,

"Easier said than done. We stay in the Western Sea, free from the constraints of the mainland's great powers, and we think we're clever... but when the time comes... you don't even know what killed you."

"My Xinggong Terrace... that is how it fell!"

---

De'ai Temple.

Small Guang Kong Mountain was no grand spiritual peak. In truth, the entire Western Sea had few such places. The territories of these powerful cultivators were usually just called provinces or islands; even Xie Hu resided in the Tanping Desert.

Host Shehu had moved Small Guang Kong Mountain here himself. Few in this region were proficient in the Dao of mountain-moving, and with the Western Sea being so remote, he hadn't been able to transport anything of quality. It was a mountain in shape only, its scattered temples buffeted by gusts of black wind.

Decadent sounds drifted from the 'Hall of Listening' high on the peak. Inside, two rows of nuns stood in shackles, burdened with stones and satchels of earth. A dark-red table sat in the center. A naked woman shuffled forward on her knees, fished a round object from a bowl of ice water, sliced it meticulously, and placed it in a small bowl. She then picked up a piece with chopsticks and fed it to the middle-aged man seated before her.

The man had a benevolent face with a slightly pointed chin and wore the robes of an abbot. A faint, pleasant smile played on his lips. His throat bobbed as he swallowed, and he let out a breath.

It was none other than Host Shehu.

Shehu was not native to the Western Sea. He was a Demon cultivator from the north, having practiced on the fringes of the Feather-Shedding Land in the Northern Sea. Thanks to a remarkable bloodline, excellent talent, and the grace of his ancestors, he had received a spiritual item from the Tree of One Heart. After enduring countless years, he finally achieved the Dao.

But after achieving the Dao, he grew arrogant. While traveling in the Eastern Sea, he was suppressed in a secret location by Maha Shejie of the Kosa Temple Sect. He was imprisoned for a century, forced to listen to endless scriptures until his mind was broken. He later escaped during a great upheaval, stealing Maha Shejie's spiritual root treasure tree, but he could never escape the scriptures' influence. For a time, he retained some clarity and knew he needed to cultivate a Life Divine Ability. But after decades of failure, Shehu grew increasingly listless.

Shehu found everything dull and meaningless.

'Life ends in death. What is the point of it all?'

Only his hatred for Shejie remained, fueling his atrocities at De'ai Temple as he coldly watched the nuns suffer. Just then, a man in green robes approached, knelt in the hall, and spoke.

"Host... a Daoist Master is outside. He says he's from Jiangnan... an old acquaintance of Daoist Master Yuanxiu. He wishes to speak with you in detail."

The Demon beast raised an eyebrow.

"Yuanxiu? ...He must have something of the Upright Wood Dao to trade with me."

The cultivation method for the Life Divine Ability he possessed had come from Yuanxiu, so the name was familiar. He felt no particular greed, but decided he might as well see him. Picking up the plate from the table, he rose and left the hall. Down at the base of the mountain, he saw a Daoist Master standing there as promised.

Li Ximing, in turn, was studying him. He noted the Demon's kind, benevolent features and his clear gaze. If not for the plate of sliced, blood-dripping heart and liver in his hands, he might have truly passed for a benevolent man.

Li Ximing had no intention of wasting time. He smiled.

"Daoist friend, watch closely!"

He rolled up his sleeve. The various spiritual flames within his body converged in his palm, condensed by the Valley Wind Guide-Fire. He raised a simple, unadorned hand and struck straight at the Demon beast's face.

"You... I...?"

Even with his thousand years of cultivation, Shehu had never encountered such a bizarre situation. This cultivator from Jiangnan had crossed thousands of miles, said "Watch closely," and then, without using any spell arts or Spiritual Artifacts, simply tried to slap him in the face!

"Ah?"

But his shock lasted only an instant. His divine abilities sensed the danger radiating from that palm, even though the hand itself looked as gentle as jade, devoid of any powerful aura. A flash of rage cut through Shehu's confusion.

'Don't tell me Body of Kui cultivators still exist!'

He lacked a Life Divine Ability, but he could still recognize a mortal threat. He instantly opened his mouth and spat out a cyan-yellow light.

It was a bronze basin the size of a human face, ancient and deeply patinated. It was etched with profound patterns, and illusory cyan sparrows wheeled above it, weaving and leaping with brilliant, shifting colors.

Boom!

Li Ximing's long-gathering palm strike landed squarely in the basin, erupting like a dense firestorm. The bronze basin shook violently, glowing red-hot, and visibly swelled as it attempted to contain and absorb all the flames.

It actually had qualities reminiscent of the Buddhist cultivators.

Li Ximing's palm strike was pure fire control, built up over a long time. It was most devastating when landing on a physical body. Even so, it wasn't something Shehu could block just by spitting out a Spiritual Artifact in a panic.

The various spiritual flames were all constrained, save for one bright white radiance that erupted forth:

The Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire!

Shehu clearly recognized the infamous flame—or at least knew that no Merging Fire was ever good news. His expression twisted. He crushed a jade talisman as the illusory light of his Upright Wood Dao flared around him, solidifying like gold. He abruptly clasped his hands.

"Journeying North!"

In an instant, endless gales and lightning filled the world, converging and sweeping in. The Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire flared brightly but began to sputter and scatter, buffeted by the wind. The Demon's own form became ethereal and light, allowing him to drift just outside the raging torrent of fire.

'Journeying North... so it commands wind and thunder to evade fire!'

Li Ximing had discussed this Dao with Sima Yuanli before, so he understood its principles instantly. He withdrew his palm with a trace of regret, but a beam of Heavenly Light was already descending from the sky, manifesting as a brilliant Celestial Gate that crashed down on Shehu.

'Not good! This is a killing blow!'

Shehu's eyes widened, and a cold sweat broke out on his brow. His face turned grim. With no time to prepare, he decisively raised his hand and drew out a talisman.

The Dao-Valley Profound-Color Talisman.

He had acquired it years ago as a life-saving measure. Keenly sensing his opponent had come prepared, he used it without hesitation. His body instantly dissolved into a surge of roiling Valley Water.

The scenery warped around him. Before Shehu could even take a breath, another Celestial Gate descended from the heavens. This one was translucent as jade, radiating a pure, white radiance, and it expanded rapidly in his disbelieving eyes.

It was even more domineering and terrifying than the last!

'There's another one!'

The Heavenly Light blazed, scattering the clouds. High in the sky, a young man stood clad in Qilin-scale profound armor, a halberd in his grip. The scroll in his other hand was wide open, unleashing a cascading waterfall of brilliant colors from the heavens.

The Bright Yang Spiritual Treasure, the Huai River Map!
