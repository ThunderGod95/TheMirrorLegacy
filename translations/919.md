# Chapter 919, The Method of Seeking the Dao

Fuxuan fell silent at these words, a troubled expression on his face. He lifted his cup, only to realize he hadn't even poured any tea in his haste. Daoist Master Che Hong, standing to the side, stepped in to smooth things over.

"I wonder where the Great Daoist Master heard this news? Penglai has been sealed for many years, and we've had no word from them. We haven't seen any trace of Daoist Master Pu Yu, and our Chunyi Dao Gate has little contact with Penglai..."

Chi Buzi shook his head. He wouldn't have asked unless he was certain. "Since Senior Yuanshang is still present," he said softly, "there must be a way."

Hearing this, Fuxuan finally broke his silence. "I don't know how you received this information, fellow Daoist, but the matter of rebuilding one's cultivation is of grave importance. Back then, even when Senior Yuanwu personally went to seek help from Penglai, Daoist Master Pu Yu still refused to act. What chance do you have? It's best not to hold out too much hope."

He paused, his gaze hardening as he looked at the green-eyed man before him. "Furthermore, achieving a divine ability involves registering one's name in the Underworld and being subject to changes in the Nine Nethers. Even extending the life of someone who died violently requires an immense price. Without a specialized Daoist tradition, who could possibly accomplish it? Currently, the paths of the 'Upper Shaman' and the 'Merging Owl' have not returned to their positions, and souls cannot manifest. I don't need to elaborate on how difficult this matter is..."

Chi Buzi just smiled and shook his head. "Fellow Daoist, you are mistaken. Who can know the future? Who knows if those two paths will return?"

He raised an eyebrow, a relaxed expression crossing his features.

"Before Liang fell and Zhao rose, before Cultivation Transcendence returned, who cared about formation disks? What was the speed of traversing the Great Void then, and what is it now? Before the Shangqing Reformation, before Golden Oneness proved the Dao, who could have imagined that Geng-Dui would shift once, let alone a second time? What about fifty or a hundred years from now?"

Chi Buzi's ambition was enormous! He was determined to become a True Monarch, to erase his name from all records, and to have the world follow the path _he_ blazed. Only then would this life be complete! As he mentioned the examples of Cultivation Transcendence and Taiyuan proving the Dao, he struggled to suppress the wild, surging ambition stirring within him!

'In a hundred years, there must be a celestial phenomenon! A borrowed manor, an intercalated feminine, and an escape from the Pristine Pool!'

He smiled. "I cultivate Pristine Water, not Metal Virtue. I am myself, and Yuanwu is Yuanwu. Fellow Daoist, just grant me a meeting. Whether I succeed or fail, or what I ask, I will not involve you."

Fuxuan gave him a deep look, inwardly disagreeing. He silently shook his head,

'Whether those two paths return isn't for anyone to say. After all these years, don't you think the Underworld wants them to return? It's just that the time isn't right, and the candidate isn't right!'

Outwardly, however, he nodded slowly.

"Very well. I will have news within three months. If I fail, consider my Daoist tradition to owe you a favor."

Hearing this, Chi Buzi readily released his leverage. Che Hong immediately stepped forward, presenting the miniature cauldron and the strand of jet-black beads. These two treasures, long separated from their master, pulsed with light, seeming extremely agitated.

Chi Buzi took his Rain-Watching Treasure Cauldron and Motang beads from Che Hong. Fuxuan, meanwhile, was overcome with emotion as he picked up the jade box, his hands trembling slightly.

"Good... good..."

Chi Buzi simply watched him with a smile.

"I will wait nearby. I shall return in three months."

With that, he gave a light flick of his sleeve, transformed into a streak of light, passed through the formation, and vanished into the Great Void.

The moment Chi Buzi left, Fuxuan lost his composure. He shot up from his seat, clutching the jade box tightly to his chest, and strode into his cave dwelling. "Guard the entrance!" he ordered in a low voice. "And get a clear account!"

Che Hong immediately took a serious stance at the entrance, beginning to ask detailed questions about the situation within the secret realm Chi Buzi had been in. Fuxuan hurried deep into the cave, soon reaching its innermost chamber, where he found a mirror shimmering with silver light.

It was the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror!

The silver light scattered onto the ground, unexpectedly forming a calm, ripple-free, moon-white illusion. It was a space of pure silver, barely ten paces across—smaller than the courtyard of a wealthy family—containing only a single table and chair.

An old man stood by the table, staring quietly at the chessboard upon it. Hearing the commotion, he looked up, revealing silver-white eyes, and nodded.

"Lingjiao, you've come."

Daoist Master Fuxuan immediately bowed.

The world knew him as Fuxuan, a man of exceptional talent who had revitalized the Chunyi Dao Gate. But very, very few knew that this Daoist Master, who presided over the Chunyi Dao Gate, was not born with the surname Xi. After he entered the sect, it was Daoist Master Yuanshang who had personally bestowed upon him the name Xi Lingjiao.

Only in front of this old man did Fuxuan need no pretense. His face lit up with joy as he hurriedly placed the jade box on the table and bowed.

"Congratulations, Master!"

Daoist Master Yuanshang's expression turned serious. With a light flick of his finger, he popped open the lid of the jade box, revealing a noble, mysterious spiritual item within. He froze.

The old man's eyes reddened, and his voice grew hoarse.

"A Xuandan Supreme Yin spiritual item!"

"Born from the waters of Supreme Yin Moon Radiance, grown in the lands of the Supreme Yin... the disaster-averting, calamity-dispelling Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch! Where did this come from?"

With tears in his eyes, Daoist Master Fuxuan nodded silently. He watched as the old man seemed to deflate, all strength leaving him as he sank into his chair. Daoist Master Fuxuan choked back a sob.

"We found it. It was obtained by that Chi Buzi!"

Hearing this, Daoist Master Yuanshang lowered his gaze and let out a desolate sigh.

"What does it matter if it's found? What year is it now? This body of mine... what use is it, other than barely surviving beneath the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror?"

He slowly raised a hand and rested it on the box, his expression growing distant. With a twitch of his finger, the box snapped shut, hiding the scattered white blossoms and golden laurel branch from view. The old man's emotions gradually settled, his calm demeanor returning.

Daoist Master Fuxuan pleaded in a low voice,

"Master... please, at least try!"

Daoist Master Yuanshang silently shook his head.

"This 'Reflecting Profound Radiance' is sixteen paces from one end to the other, and I cannot take a single step outside it. I have been languishing here for fifty-six years. I no longer have any desire to break through to the True Monarch realm."

"This item... can only be left for you."

Fuxuan frowned immediately, but Daoist Master Yuanshang's expression was grave. He began to speak,

"The Patriarch left a decree. He stated that the Supreme Yin is sealed and its spiritual items are cut off. For us descendants, he left behind the 'Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity' to help attain the True Monarch realm. The 'Longaeva Harmonizing Light White Hair' that the Patriarch used back then failed... but in truth, two remain."

"What!"

Fuxuan was stunned, the word escaping him before he could stop it.

He knew of the "Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity."

The Supreme Yin was a Fruition Attainment of the highest, noblest order. Since it had vanished from the world, seeking to attain it was fraught with difficulty; almost no one even tried anymore. But the foundation of the Chunyi Dao Gate's confidence lay in this secret art from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition!

This was an exceptionally profound secret art. It was designed to create a sliver of hope in seeking an Auxiliary Position. By using a spiritual item of extremely high status—one connected to an Auxiliary Position—as a buff, one could charge the True Monarch realm and resonate with the secret art, hoping for a better outcome.

And the Chunyi Dao Gate's Patriarch, Jiequn, had a fortuitous encounter back then, obtaining one of those 'Longaeva Harmonizing Light White Hair' items, which he used for his breakthrough!

At this revelation, Fuxuan was naturally bewildered, dense confusion flooding his mind.

"Then, Master, why did you...!"

Daoist Master Yuanshang said bleakly,

"You have not read the secret art, so you do not know. According to its calculations, although the path of the Supreme Yin is hidden, one Auxiliary Position was destined to re-emerge from obscurity, able to accommodate a future cultivator. Your Grandmaster once discussed this with me. It's possible some Immortal, with their heaven-shaking divine ability, left a contingency in place, using a bit of Profound Light or a Dharma Treasure to anchor this specific Auxiliary Position..."

Fuxuan listened, finding it all plausible. But then he saw a look of bitter resentment flash across the old man's face.

"But back then, no matter how the Patriarch calculated, he could not determine _which_ Auxiliary Position it was! It's obvious! Some True Monarch must have used their own divine ability to blind all senses, making it undetectable by gods or ghosts!"

"We can only test it!"

He shook his head in anguish.

"Why did the Patriarch fail? In my view, it's because the Auxiliary Position corresponding to the 'Longaeva Harmonizing Light White Hair' was a dead end!"

"We stand too low to see clearly. We are like mayflies gazing at the sun and moon, thinking we see an opportunity for enlightenment. But looking down from the perspective of those mighty figures, this 'opportunity' might be a critical point on the great chessboard, one that cannot be revealed to others!"

Understanding dawned on Fuxuan. His expression grew somber as he grasped the truth,

"So the remaining two... Master, you kept them hidden on the mountain, never using them! And now, this Xuandan Supreme Yin spiritual item is the one we can _truly_ test!"

Daoist Master Yuanshang sighed.

"Exactly..."

He placed his hand over the jade box on the table.

"It seems our Chunyi Daoist tradition is destined to flourish. You are a genius seen once in a century, and more remarkably, you have walked step-by-step to this day despite the persecution of various houses, becoming capable of sheltering our descendants. Later, Guanghou appeared, and I was grateful to have a mainstay. I never expected Che Hong to be even more remarkable. With the two of you... it need not be wasted on me."

Daoist Master Fuxuan sighed in silence. Yuanshang, in contrast, was overcome with joy. His focus returned to the jade box, and he cradled it, his heart full.

"The quality of this Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch is superb! It likely dates back to the Wei era. I heard that the Lady of the World's Navel obtained a branch before she achieved the Dao, refining it into a talisman to avert disaster and reduce karma. Although we cannot use it for that, it shows just how precious this item is!"

"Indeed."

Fuxuan only said quietly,

"I've sent Che Hong to make detailed inquiries, to find out which house that cave dwelling belonged to..."

As he spoke, Daoist Master Yuanshang's movements paused minutely. His expression, however, remained soft and natural as he said in a nearly inaudible voice,

"There's no need to ask."

Daoist Master Fuxuan raised an eyebrow slightly, then immediately lowered his head.

"Yes."

The cave dwelling fell silent for a moment. Daoist Master Yuanshang shook his head.

"We must still follow through on our promise to Chi Buzi. I will write a letter and ask Pu Yu his intentions. Back then, Yuansu and Zimu knew him best, but he... he doesn't get attached. No one would dare claim to be his close friend. Whether he comes depends as much on my face as it does on Chi Buzi's."

Fuxuan bowed and quickly retreated, leaving the old Daoist Master sitting alone in the silver light. He stared at the jade box, his expression dark and brooding, silent for a long, long time.

'Who sent this? The one from Pristine Water? Likely not... That one's thoughts run deep, and he ignores worldly affairs. Besides Suiguan, who could possibly represent him?!'

...

The Eastern Sea.

Chi Buzi sped onward, traveling day and night. He journeyed out from the Eastern Sea, but this time, instead of heading beyond the Peacock Sea, he followed the path along the World's Navel, descending in a remote, desolate region.

Once deep underground, he found an area devoid of spiritual energy, carved out a simple cave dwelling, and sat down cross-legged to review his plans.

'Yuanshang is indeed still alive... Chi Wei was right. That "Reflecting Profound Radiance" can stabilize the six senses, gather essence, avoid detection, and hide from tribulations. That old man must be the longest-lived of them all. Even if he can't leave that spot, he must have at least ten years left...'

His gaze was calm as he calculated inwardly.

'Does the Underworld know? The Taiqun Spirit-Mirror is masterless, and it's not Jiequn using it; how could they be fooled? I suspect they think he can succeed in seeking gold and have already negotiated with him. The Taiqun Spirit-Mirror can't protect him for much longer anyway, so they might as well grant him this one favor.'

As for the Penglai matter, Chi Buzi hadn't brought it up on a whim. He didn't just want to see Pu Yu; he also wanted to visit Penglai's Quhai Sect!

'According to my plan, if I have to give up the Pristine Water path, I must prepare for the next life. Seeing Pu Yu is essential, whether it succeeds or not... it's a good thing. If I can enter the Penglai grotto-heaven, that would be even better!'

There was a simple reason, Penglai was an extremely special place.

'Penglai is an Immortal Lord Daoist tradition, the heritage of Immortal Lord Chufu. It is an immortal legacy, inviolable and sacrosanct. I've also heard that this Immortal Lord Chufu possessed great merit, and all other paths respect him deeply. His status is entirely different...'

And the Penglai grotto-heaven was one of the few places in the current world confirmed to be suppressed by an Immortal Artifact!

Chi Buzi wasn't certain, but he was eighty or ninety percent sure—if he could just visit the Penglai grotto-heaven once, the karmic threads of destiny entangled around him would become a hundred times more complex, undergoing a qualitative leap.

'Even if I don't remember any of it afterward, it will still make the profound mysteries surrounding me harder to divine... It will reduce the risk. Even a little help is good.'

Chi Buzi had planned for the worst-case scenario from the very beginning. It was entirely possible that the injured Pristine Water would ignore him completely and simply flee to the Pristine Speech Heaven. But for him, Chi Buzi, he only had one life. He could not be too paranoid.

Beyond this, a greater worry was brewing in his heart.

'As the deadline approaches, Immortal Merit is hard to come by. The day I can successfully exchange for what I need... feels further and further away...'

Chi Buzi had spent all his previous Immortal Merit to receive guidance from the Daoist tradition. To be honest, the value of that guidance was worlds apart from the meager effort of a few fights and a bit of scheming; he had never regretted it. But the ultimate constraint was time.

What's more, as he killed Demons and, on several occasions, the Merciful One, the risk of this affair kept rising, making his heart clench,

'It would be best if I can exchange for the cultivation method this time... If I can't, the future will be too dangerous... But even if I get the cultivation method, that method for seeking gold is a hundred, a thousand times more valuable. How difficult will _that_ be to obtain?'

He could only close his eyes and pray silently.

"This junior cultivator, Chi Buzi, respectfully beseeches the Supreme Yin..."

As streaks of white light flashed before his eyes, the feeling of weightlessness returned. Chi Buzi took an ethereal step, and his vision cleared. He was back in the courtyard.

Even though he had experienced this more than once, Chi Buzi still felt a sense of incomprehensible awe. The higher his cultivation, the more he understood just how terrifying this power was, which could snatch him from thousands of miles away.

The four white jade lamp pedestals reappeared before him. The courtyard was unchangingly bright and pure, seemingly as eternal as the grotto-heaven itself. Chi Buzi paused, realizing the courtyard was empty.

'That lazy donkey is slacking off again!'

Chi Buzi was much more familiar with things now. He knew that aside from the first time—when the donkey was new to the job and waited in advance—it had almost never been on time since. He stepped out of the central round pool and waited quietly to the side.

Only a moment passed before the courtyard gate creaked open. A young immortal official with pale turquoise eyes pushed his way in, bustling with excitement.

"Ayo! Great Daoist Master Chi has arrived!"
