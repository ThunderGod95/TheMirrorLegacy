# Chapter 361: Dispute Between Master and Disciple

Li Yuanping rode his horse forward, feeling the onset of a cough as his excitement waned. The riding uniform he wore was cold and clammy from sweat. Li Ximing, sensing his father's discomfort, asked, "Father, how have you been feeling lately...?"

"Heh."

Li Yuanping did not answer. His face remained pale as he rode up to the carriage with the black flags fluttering above it. He dismounted, handing the reins to Dou Yi, who quickly took them. Li Yuanping then said, "Take this horse to... to Xicheng. It shall be his mount. Starting tomorrow, there is no need to prepare a carriage for him anymore."

He bent down and entered the carriage, beginning to remove his attire. Li Ximing, understanding his father's needs, lit the brazier inside. Li Yuanping coughed twice, sat by the fire, and spoke gently, "Sitting high in the hall, the letters from various towns always paint a picture of peace. Riding this horse for these past few months, and seeing things with my own eyes, has finally set my mind at ease. Now that we have observed Li Jiman, Ming'er... what do you think of him?"

Li Ximing's face, illuminated by the fire, turned a bit golden-red. He poked the coals with a stick, recalling his thoughts as he finally replied, "I see him as arrogant and cold-hearted."

"Hmm."

Li Yuanping nodded in agreement, speaking softly, "In your opinion, would it be better for Mount Yue State to fall into the hands of the Tian Family or Li Jiman?"

Li Ximing furrowed his brow slightly and responded, "I think it makes no difference who holds it. It depends on who can give our family more benefits... The land of Mount Yue is vast, and the spirit goods and paddies they send up are too few."

Li Yuanping did not expect such profound insights from a child. He sighed softly and said, "It is not just Mount Yue. As our clan grows, open and hidden struggles within the seven towns have intensified. Clashes between prominent families and branch lines are fierce. If it were not for the Clan Affairs Courtyard and the Jade Court Guards maintaining order, there would be even more disgraceful incidents.

"The clan has existed for five generations... If we count from the day our forefather returned to establish it, it has been nearly a century. Achieving success is indeed easy, but maintaining a household is difficult."

As father and son conversed in the carriage, the lead spirit horse snorted and stopped. Outside, Dou Yi called out, "Family Head, we have reached the town."

Li Yuanping led his eldest son out of the carriage. Dou Yi approached and whispered, "Family Head, Chen Donghe and the others are already waiting in the hall."

Li Yuanping hummed in acknowledgement as he walked into the hall. Despite being only an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator, the Qi Cultivators inside stood up from their seats respectfully.

Li Yuanping took the main seat and first looked at Chen Donghe, asking politely, "Uncle, what is the situation?"

Chen Donghe, now in his fifties at the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, cupped his fist and replied gently, "I have prepared my luggage and am ready to head west with Jingtian."

Li Yuanping nodded in understanding as he reached over and picked up a storage pouch from the desk. He walked down the steps and handed it to Chen Donghe. He then said solemnly, "These are the talismans and Spirit Stones prepared by the family. The town has also arranged two Unrefined Qi Cultivators from Mount Yue to assist with minor tasks... Please take care, Uncle!"

Chen Donghe and his wife had always intended to travel. Officially, they were said to be adventuring, but in reality, they were heading west to the deserts of the Golden Feather Sect to collect Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi.

This was a secret mission. Hearing that Li Yuanping had arranged for two Mount Yue cultivators to accompany him, Chen Donghe looked up in surprise. Li Yuanping smiled and said, "Do not worry, Uncle. These two are heavily bound by ties and have sworn a spiritual oath. They can be trusted."

Mount Yue's cultivation methods were simple and archaic, aligning with the bloodlines of its various tribes. They were easy to practice but not effective for achieving significant power. Over the years, only five unrefined cultivators emerged, mainly tending to spirit plants which were of limited use.

To collect the Golden Yang Radiant Origin by oneself would take at least twenty years. Chen Donghe naturally understood Li Yuanping's intention as he nodded in understanding and expressed his thanks. Given the presence of outsiders, he did not say much more. He simply accepted the silk pouch and took his leave.

After Chen Donghe left, Li Xicheng stepped forward and respectfully reported, "Family Head, over the past five years, Eastern Mount Yue has paid its tribute: 2,100 jin of spirit paddies, 200 White Essence Fruit, 200 jin of Yellow Jade Spirit Rice, and eleven types of various other spirit items."

He paused before continuing, "The total value is seventy Spirit Stones! They have already been sent down the mountain."

"Good." Li Yuanping nodded in approval. The Azure Pond Sect barely managed the small households in the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation realms, only collecting a small tribute to establish a hierarchy, but the taxes on clans were steep.

As a clan, the Li Family had to pay a tribute every five years, a significant amount of 10,000 jin of Spirit Paddies, equivalent to a hundred Spirit Stones; 500 White Essence Fruit and 500 jin of Yellow Jade Spirit Rice, also worth a hundred Spirit Stones; and an assortment of other spirit items totaling thirty Spirit Stones."

Currently, the Li Family could only produce less than half of this amount. The remaining hundred-plus Spirit Stones were a constant source of worry for Li Yuanping.

In previous years, they supplemented this deficit through the Cloud Crowned Peak market, issuing tasks for external and family cultivators to collect herbs and hunt beasts. Combined with the talismans drawn by Li Xuanxuan and others, they could barely generate forty to fifty Spirit Stones.

Additionally, they relied on the Ebony Mine on their territory, which, through full exploitation, could yield another forty to fifty Spirit Stones over five years. The rest was covered by Li Yuanping's frugal management.

"Furthermore, we must provide resources for the family cultivators," Li Yuanping muttered, troubled by the modest revenue from Mount Yue as reported by Li Xicheng.

He moved his cup on the desk and mumbled, "Mount Wutu still lacks a large formation and it is truly impoverished... such annual deficits are unsustainable."

Li Xicheng stood respectfully before him. Seeing that his earlier report had been fairly smooth without any signs of awkwardness, Li Yuanping could not help but ask, "What is the situation in Mount Yue?"

Caught off guard, Li Xicheng hesitated for several moments before nervously replying, "The Tian Family holds power... Prince Li Jiman is brave..."

"Enough," Li Yuanping interrupted, noting that Li Xicheng did not assertively say "The Tian Family rules" or "The Tian Family controls the politics." He had completely lost interest in hearing more and kindly dismissed him.

"Go and cultivate."

"Yes!" Li Xicheng cupped his fist and left.

Li Yuanping sighed deeply, turning to look at Li Ximing, who was diligently studying nearby. He softly remarked, "Xicheng is honest and straightforward, kind and generous... In the future, if you manage the family, you can employ your Xicheng, but he cannot be given sole responsibility."

Li Ximing was quite fond of his elder brother Li Xicheng, so he was at a loss for how to respond, simply burying his head in his book. Fortunately, someone came forward and reported, "Family Head, there is news from the Yuan Family."

"Oh?"

Li Yuanping immediately looked up. The person continued, "Immortal Master Yuan Tuan has reached Mushroom Forest Plain and will arrive at Moongaze Lake on the full moon day of the eleventh lunar month."

"Good!" Li Yuanping said as he clapped his hands together, instantly delighted. It was now the third day of the eleventh month, meaning Yuan Tuan would arrive in twelve days. He smiled and said, "Send someone to reply that our family eagerly awaits the Immortal Master's visit."

The rain in Linghai Prefecture was continuous. Located in the south of Yue State, it was surrounded by mountains, humid and stifling. Rainwater gathered in the valleys, often flooding the low-lying areas.

A young man trudged through the water in the dense rainforest, annoyed by the constant croaking of frogs. He frowned and grumbled, "Master, why are we circling back to this godforsaken place?"

"Who knows what madness has taken over the Azure Pond Sect..."

The man behind him, with wild hair and a fierce look, walked on a black mist and spoke in a hoarse voice, "They did not send even one related Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... We have to first cross Linghai Prefecture and then head to Yi Mountain City at the southern border! This body is already useless. If I had not practiced Blood Drinker, suppressing this body, it would have long turned into a puddle of pus from Metallic Essence erosion..."

The young man squinted his eyes and said ambiguously, "But Master, are you not searching for some special Dao foundations? If you forcefully enter Yi Mountain City, you may never return and have to keep heading south. If you reach the depths of the southern border, where will you find a body for your soul transfer..?"

This young man was none other than Jiang Yan, who had been missing for many years. Many cultivators were causing trouble all over Yue State under his name while he had secretly returned to Linghai Prefecture.

A trace of suspicion flashed in Jiang Yan's eyes as he asked this question tentatively. Jiang Boqing, however, waved it off nonchalantly and replied, "Your Master, a genius who reached the Foundation Establishment Realm at thirty and Purple Mansion Realm at sixty, will figure something out when the time comes!"

Jiang Yan shook his head and laughed, then responded simply, "Since Master claims to be a genius who achieved Foundation Establishment Realm at thirty and Purple Mansion Realm at sixty, why did you abandon the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao and switch to practicing curses and strange scriptures?"

"Damn it..." the rough man groaned, his wrinkles deepening with his changing expression.

He grumbled, "I was a genius back then, oblivious to the filth between the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. I never met anyone with the same immortal foundation as mine, always burying myself in cultivation... Later, when I reached the Purple Mansion Realm—Only then did I realize that the Lord of Mount Wu, Duanmu Kui, cultivated the same Dao!"

He controlled the body that was on the brink of collapse, his expression twisted and hideous, barely managing to smile as he continued, "Duanmu Kui is a figure of overwhelming power in his era... How could I ever wait for him to make a move? It scared me so much that I immediately diminished my divine abilities and cut down my Dao foundation, seeking emptiness to create talismans. I lost most of my cultivation in the process, which is how I became like this."

"Oh?" Jiang Yan remained composed and asked, "What does seeking emptiness to create talismans mean?"

Jiang Boqing shook his head, a hint of pride on his face as he explained, "This is a method I obtained from an ancient text. It involves treating one's life divine abilities as talismans, turning one's entire cultivation along with the Dao foundation into an immortal talisman, transitioning from the Golden Core Dao to the Shamanic Talisman Dao..."

A glimmer of hope appeared on his face as he continued warmly, "When I was young, I received the legacy of a predecessor from Moonlight Origin Mansion. This technique was part of it, and it is not easy to master. Only I, who sought the Supreme Shaman's Three Nine Blood Essence that had a close relationship with talismans, managed to succeed!"

"Turning one's entire cultivation into talismans..."

Jiang Yan pondered these words, then suddenly looked back, this time with tears glistening on his face as he asked in a low voice, "Master... are you now turning my cultivation into talismans?"

Jiang Boqing, still babbling on, suddenly froze when he heard this and cursed, "What nonsense are you talking about?!"

Jiang Yan, however, became more certain. His tears gradually stopped as he stared into Jiang Boqing's eyes and said coldly, "Although I do not cultivate the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, I understand that this path cannot be easily switched. Turning a core into a talisman is already the limit, how can one so casually seize metallic essences?!"

His eyes glinted as he continued coldly, "If my guess is correct, Master, your metallic essence was already heavily damaged... Now that it has disintegrated, there is no more opportunity for you to seize any Dao foundation and start anew!"

Jiang Boqing sighed loudly as his angry expression gradually calmed, turning into a look of appreciation. He said softly, "Indeed, I have no chance of seizing a body..."

Jiang Yan took a step back, seeing that Jiang Boqing was completely unguarded. A bitter smile appeared on his face as he snarled, "It seems you and the Azure Pond Sect are of the same ilk. No wonder... No wonder the Azure Pond Sect, a colossal entity, could not capture even a small cultivator like me after so many years of wandering through the five prefectures."

"So much bloodshed along the way... and every time I broke through a stronghold of the Azure Pond Sect, materials suitable for breakthroughs always appeared... Those resentment qi and blood qi collected dozens upon dozens of years always ended up in my hands one gourd after another."

His pupils dilated, and his fists were clenched so tightly they nearly bled. He then screamed, "Jiang Boqing! What a self-directed, self-acted play... You and the Azure Pond Sect each got what you wanted... You have really put on such a good show!"

"You were never trying to seize some special immortal foundation... It was just a comforting lie for me! The Three Nine True Talisman in my qihai acupoint, the Shamanic Blood Talisman in my Shenyang Mansion, those were what you plotted for!"

His venomous voice echoed through the mountains, silencing Jiang Boqing. Flesh fell from Jiang Boqing's face in shreds. After a few moments, Jiang Boqing spoke.

"I was indeed close with Buzi, and the devil plague was indeed a trade of interests between the Azure Pond Sect and myself... That is why the resentment qi and blood qi were sent to you one after another. You are a smart child, and you guessed all of these correctly."

He paused, shaking his head slightly as he continued, "But my metallic essence is damaged beyond repair. No talisman or seal can save it. The two shamanic talismans on you are something I nurtured myself... They are exceptionally miraculous, but they are not meant for body seizing."

Jiang Boqing's body was covered in blood, yet his gaze remained gentle. He said softly, "Occupying this body is merely to protect you. Without special elixirs or matching techniques, it will eventually perish along with this body. I thought I could hide it from you until I sent you out of the southern border..."

Jiang Yan remained unmoved, taking another step back with a wary expression, his voice ice cold as he replied, "You say it is not... and I should believe you just like that? How can I trust you!"

Jiang Boqing frowned at him, suddenly startled. He then shouted loudly, "Hey!"

His lips and teeth came together, releasing a thunderous shout that made Jiang Yan's head buzz. Jiang Boqing's expression changed drastically as he cursed, "Damn it, it is a divine ability!"

Jiang Yan's eyes cleared up, and he was taken aback. Jiang Boqing quickly grabbed him, lifted off into the air, and shouted, "We must leave quickly! If he is using a divine ability to block us, he must be close!"

"A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator?"

Jiang Yan's hair stood on end as he pushed his mana to fly, asking, "Are you not in cahoots with the Azure Pond Sect? Why would they send a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator after you!"

"Probably an old enemy of mine!"

Jiang Boqing's rough, wild-haired body cursed loudly, calculating in his mind, "How is this possible?! Who could have predicted this?!"

They had only flown for a moment when the biting wind in the sky suddenly ceased. The wind formed from their mana stopped flowing, and streams of black light appeared in the void before them, bursting with the colorful brilliance of a Purple Mansion Realm's divine ability.

"Senior Jiang," a young man said as he leisurely stepped out from within the void. He wore a simple Daoist robe, his features delicate and refined, holding an unremarkable grayish pearl in his hand.

"To think that this day finally came for you..."

"Qing Jifang..." Jiang Boqing muttered as he stared at the young man, clearly surprised by his appearance and unsure of his intentions. He asked in a low voice, "What do you want?"

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's robe fluttered as he turned the pearl in his hand gently, calmly looking at Jiang Boqing. "Senior, no need to be tense... I have many questions to ask you. Perhaps about the Answers to a Beggar's Questions Under the Mulberry Tree, or about Sword Immortal Shangyuan, Xiao Chuting, Tang Yuanwu... What are you plotting? Who has the immortal book now? Everyone from Mount Changhuai is very curious... Please come with me to Wu State, Senior."
