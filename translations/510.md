# Chapter 769: Tuoba Chongyuan

Li Xizhi focused his gaze. The mist slowly rose and swept over the snow-white mountain ridges. Thick gray clouds rolled in behind it, mingling pure and turbid energies. Fleeting traces of escape light could be vaguely seen within them.

Radiant light surged from his eyes, floating within his pupils and subtly dispersing at the corners. The grayness faded, revealing a lead streak of white energy, followed by seven black trails. The rest were minor demonic troops, hidden amidst the clouds.

The Dawn Dew Gathering Technique was among the few top-tier, well-structured techniques within the sect. Its only flaw was the difficulty in gathering dew. No news had ever surfaced about its follow-up techniques from Jiangnan, and all fellow cultivators had long given up on it. Thus, few chose to train in it. However, the perception technique it was paired with was highly compatible. So Li Xizhi was the first among the three to see things clearly, and he sighed inwardly.

Quan Yi counted them one by one, his face pale as he replied, “There are actually this many of them!”

Yu Yuwei looked on grimly, then studied Quan Yi closely before gently reassuring him, “Fellow Daoist Quan, even the Purple Mansion Realm Maha of the great void are watching. One military force facing off against one pass is like a game of Go, where each move is carefully calculated. They surely won’t allow the enemy to concentrate forces and strike this valley all at once...”

Yu Yuwei, after all, was a seasoned cultivator. Normally, he wouldn’t speak such blunt truths that might draw trouble. But when he saw the enemy right before them and Quan Yi still wavering, he had no choice but to explain the stakes and steady his resolve.

Sure enough, after a few seconds of observation, the seven streams of black smoke each descended toward different fortress passes, leading groups of demonic forces to fight separately. Quan Yi calmed down slightly, and only one white escape light rode the wind and flew forward from that swirling demonic aura.

This light carried no accompanying troops, nor did it emit any demonic qi. It flew cleanly through the mass of black smoke raised by the other devil cultivators, untainted by a single speck of filth.

Li Xizhi grew wary and thought to himself, That must be a direct descendant of the Tuoba Family!

Yu Yuwei also looked grim and spoke up first, “I’ve heard that the Tuoba Family’s Liang Dynasty was founded by orthodox devil cultivators. Back then, Tuoba Xuantan established the Great Liang State and revered the Immortal Dao as the highest truth. Their feathered robes and attire all followed the Wei Dynasty...”

They each raised their dharma artifacts and ascended into the air. Outside the formation, the white mist surged, and the white light slowly took form. It revealed a white jade chariot, gleaming with bursts of dharma light. The rolling white mist in front of it was drawn by two illusory horned beasts with faintly red eyes. The chariot slowly came to a halt before the formation.

Seated atop the chariot was a man with righteous features. His face was square and broad, his brows thick, and his eyes so dark they were startling. His gaze was cold and naturally commanding.

He wore a perfectly tailored white robe that had a band of jade-like white around his collar, with platinum-gold patterns flowing down. He wore a tall crown and wide belt, and his feathered ceremonial robes exuded immense grandeur. He carried the bearing of orthodox immortal rites, walking on clouds with poise and grace.

The Tuoba Family had descended from the northern barbarians. After several centuries, their ceremonial attire was even more doctrinal than that of several Jiangnan sects.

When he reached the formation, he stepped down from the chariot and spoke in a low voice, “Fellow Daoists of the south, come out and meet me.”

They had a mere Qi Cultivation Realm formation that was symbolic at best. Even the Li Family found Foundation Establishment Realm arrays difficult to set up, so how could the Azure Pond Sect possibly place a major Foundation Establishment Realm formation here? Thus, before cultivators of that realm, the formation would last no more than seven minutes. The group exchanged glances and flew out of the formation together.

The man in white merely frowned when five Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators appeared. He paid no attention to Yu Yuwei’s two newly advanced disciples, as if they were invisible, letting his gaze pause only on Yu Yuwei and Li Xizhi.

He didn’t move, nor did the others attack. Instead, they listened as he shook his white sleeve and said in a deep voice, “Shengle Heaven, Tuoba Chongyuan.”

As he spoke, he drew a golden-jade seal from his sleeve, streaked with white and yellow. When he saw that Li Xizhi and the others didn’t recognize the gesture and remained silent, he chuckled and said, “Chongyuan has long been in the North, let me show the means of Jiangnan’s demonic sects!”

Five rays of light surged into the air as soon as he finished speaking. Li Xizhi drew his fan with one hand and formed seals with the other, unleashing radiant light. Yu Yuwei and his two disciples joined forces, forming seals to release a sweeping beam of white light.

Though Quan Yi had just spoken of retreat, he fought earnestly once battle commenced. Knowing he was slightly weaker than the other three, he immediately revealed his Immortal Foundation, his entire body shining with radiant brilliance.
𝒇𝓻𝓮𝓮𝙬𝙚𝒃𝒏𝓸𝙫𝒆𝙡.𝓬𝓸𝒎

His Immortal Foundation belonged to the Soft Advance essence of the Twelve Essences, also known as Auspicious Qi. Golden clouds gathered beneath his feet as he pulled two golden cords from each hand, wrapping them around his fingers, though he had yet to unleash them.

Li Xizhi took note for a moment and silently thought, This Quan Yi... always insists on letting us probe first... making a lot of noise but achieving little.

Just as that thought passed through his mind, Tuoba Chongyuan made his move. A white wind surged forth with a sweep of his long sleeve, transforming into a beast midair and instantly shattering their spells.

Tuoba Chongyuan’s expression relaxed as he smiled and said, “You fellow Daoists truly underestimate me... Why bother probing with such trivial spells? Though the Tuoba Family has long resided in a grotto heaven, we still possess some measure of foundation.”

Li Xizhi listened carefully, his thoughts turning. However, Yu Yuwei’s face darkened when he saw their combined spell swatted aside like flies by Tuoba Chongyuan.

He sighed. “Whether fortune or disaster... it cannot be avoided in the end.”

Yu Yuwei formed hand seals, and a small cauldron with two handles and three legs dropped from his sleeve. It was covered in complex patterns and was glowing purple-red. When it emerged, the lid suddenly flipped open, spewing out raging flames of violet and crimson.

Li Xizhi reached for the sword at his waist, stepped forward, and unleashed an arc of sword light that howled as it flew across the sky toward Tuoba Chongyuan. Though Li Xizhi focused on spell arts and had not dedicated himself to the sword path, and was already outshone by his younger brother in that regard, his natural talent and swordsmanship were solid. When he drew his sword, it was still something worth witnessing.

Since his compatriots had engaged the enemy in battle, Quan Yi finally used his true strength and activated his Immortal Foundation. Auspicious qi rose as he formed circular hand seals, his thumbs pressed against his middle fingers which released a blast of yellow wind.

The yellow wind stirred and expanded in the air, forming a hazy veil that seemed to obscure spiritual sense. It kicked up snow from the mountains and cast shadows everywhere, prompting Li Xizhi to tighten his grip on his sword and think, This spell is indeed effective against ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. It would even be quite potent. But against someone like Tuoba Chongyuan... even without perception techniques, it’s probably just a minor nuisance at best.

As for Yu Yuwei’s two disciples, they were even more pathetic. Reaching Foundation Establishment Realm at sixty had already pushed them to their limits. What proper spells could they even cast? The two spells they managed to send drifted lazily through the air, not even warranting a blink from Tuoba Chongyuan.

Tuoba Chongyuan simply formed two seals in the air, leaving golden markings behind. A casual sweep of his sleeve reduced the spells to ashes. Li Xizhi took the opportunity to observe and silently noted, This man’s dharma robe is no ordinary garment... there’s definitely something profound about that sleeve...

He continued to form seals and cast spells, but he watched as Tuoba Chongyuan released a golden radiance from the patterns, effortlessly deflecting the sword light. It grazed his sleeve and flew off. Meanwhile, Tuoba Chongyuan threw out a jade tablet with his other hand.

The tablet appeared ordinary, with pale markings and a gentle glow. However, when it landed on the cauldron, the violet-red flames were instantly extinguished. The cauldron flickered weakly twice before retreating in defeat.

At that moment, the light in Li Xizhi’s hand suddenly pulsed. A condensed rainbow beam shot out at incredible speed, darting through the sky straight at Tuoba Chongyuan’s face.

At the same time, Yu Yuwei leapt into action, his beard bristling and eyes fierce as he shouted, “Hyah!”

Before the shout had fully left his mouth, a handful of golden light leapt from between his lips and teeth, flickering once before turning into a stream of light that shot forward. Quan Yi also gritted his teeth and finally flung out his two golden cords. One after the other, the golden cords slithered like snakes through the air.

Tuoba Chongyuan’s smile dimmed slightly as he focused on the coordinated attacks coming at him. The first strike to arrive was Li Xizhi’s rainbow light. This move was one of the rare offensive arts in the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique, known as Morning Rainbow Lure. Though Li Xizhi rarely practiced offensive arts, he had trained in this quite often. Now that it was unleashed, it was incredibly swift.

A morning glow spell art.

Tuoba Chongyuan’s eyes shifted. He raised his hand, trying to repeat his earlier trick by swiping his sleeve to disperse it. But the rainbow beam suddenly burst into eight streaks of multicolored light, scattering and reforming behind him in sync with his movement. Tuoba Chongyuan struck empty air and frowned.

But in that brief moment of delay, Quan Yi’s golden cords arrived. Clearly not seeing him as a threat, Tuoba Chongyuan casually pushed out two waves of white light to block the cords. But Quan Yi activated his Immortal Foundation and his face glowed with rising qi. The cords pierced straight through the white light and hooked onto Tuoba’s robes.

“Why are all of you using these petty side-door tricks?!” shouted Tuoba Chongyuan.

Boom!

The man finally lost his patience. He shattered the golden cords into countless sparkles with a vicious flick of his sleeve. Retracting his hand cleanly, white demonic patterns appeared on his face as he punched the air.

A thunderous boom rang out as a streak of golden light was forced out of hiding. Tuoba Chongyuan grabbed it with a reverse motion, flinching slightly from the heat, then flung it aside with a burst of multicolored light, growling, “Old Daoist! That’s not how you use Sand-Swallowing Sword Nourishment!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he grasped a bright, slender spear in his hand, its elegant lines flowing like water. White markings appeared across his face as he held it with both hands. It seemed he had activated a secret technique

His voice turned low and resonant, “Strike!”

He moved like an agile ape, spinning the spear in a blur of afterimages. He shattered both the rainbow and golden lights in a single sweep, blasting apart twin bursts of dazzling color. Tuoba Chongyuan laughed heartily and exhaled a puff of white breath.

In the next instant, the group's spell arts surged forward, only to strike nothing but a phantom image. The Tuoba Family’s footwork technique was clearly superior to everyone present, Tuoba Chongyuan vanished into thin air without leaving the slightest trace.

Gold in Cloud!

Li Xizhi was the first to react, transforming into a flickering rainbow light. He reappeared several meters away, only to see a golden afterimage tearing through the air, hurtling toward Yu Yuwei.

The old man was startled out of his wits. Though he had lived many years, he vanished like a startled hare at this critical moment, leaving behind two disciples who fled in panic. A light flick of Tuoba Chongyuan’s long spear shattered their defensive techniques, leaving them pale-faced and defenseless.

Tuoba Chongyuan smiled faintly and seemed to mouth something. As his lips moved, everyone felt their hairs stand on end and instinctively backed away. A piercing screech followed, leaving golden dust hanging heavily in the air and scattering radiant light in all directions.

Wong...

Li Xizhi felt the light before him suddenly dim. He vaguely saw the floating golden dust above gathering into a brilliant arc that shot downward through his field of vision. It flickered once, and vanished.

Pfft!

The disciple behind Yu Yuwei spat out blood. His face turned gold and white, and his body cracked like a shattered eggshell, exploding into a rain of blood that slowly drifted down.

Chunks of flesh scattered, but before they could fall, they transformed into golden falling leaves, accompanied by the faint fragrance of osmanthus.

The remaining disciple was so terrified he lost his entire soul. He was still stumbling backward when Tuoba Chongyuan’s voice echoed across the sky, “Old Daoist! This is Sand-Swallowing Sword Nourishment!”

The slain disciple had become an ominous phenomenon between heaven and earth. The rustling golden leaves fell behind Tuoba Chongyuan, slowly blanketing the snow-covered mountains. Everyone was struck speechless.

The old man’s eyes turned red as he cried out in grief, “My child!... Ai!”

In just a few exchanges, Tuoba Chongyuan had already found an opening and killed someone with two moves. How could the others not feel deeply shaken? The strength he revealed was stunning. Only Li Xuanfeng, the mountain’s guardian, might rival him...

A brief moment of silence passed before radiant glow burst forth again toward Tuoba Chongyuan. Yu Yuwei had gone completely berserk; he hurled his purple-red cauldron forward and swallowed a crimson pill, activating his Immortal Foundation. Waves and mist rose from his body, painting him in deep oceanic blue.

Li Xizhi fully activated his Immortal Foundation, Universal Dawn Mist. His feathered robe shimmered with streaks of Heavenly Glow that danced around its edges. The misty rainbow fog spread rapidly with the steam, and bands of seven-colored light emerged in the air, winding steadily toward Tuoba Chongyuan.

Tuoba Chongyuan spun his spear to block their attacks, moving with practiced ease, as if he was strolling through a courtyard. He said softly, “So, the two of you have finally revealed your Immortal Foundations.”

At this point in the battle, no one could stop Tuoba Chongyuan from speaking as he pleased. Raising an eyebrow, he continued, “Very good, very good. The Dao of the Purple Mansion Realm and Golden Core Realm... truly has some connection to my own. What a curious and amusing display!”

Yu Yuwei’s remaining disciple gritted his teeth and rode the wind, casting spells from the side. Quan Yi, however, was momentarily stunned. He stared blankly at the golden leaves drifting down from the death phenomenon of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. Only after a second did he snap out of it and join the other two in their assault.

Tuoba Chongyuan narrowed his eyes and chuckled lightly. At last, he revealed the seal from earlier and said softly, “Watch closely, everyone!”

He tossed the great seal high into the air. The interwoven yellow and white light surged upward, instantly filling the entire valley. The golden seal rose dazzlingly, and in a flash, transformed into several large words, Shengle Tuoba.

The two ancient-style words glowed with dazzling dharma light, weaving intense color in the sky. Li Xizhi felt the brushstrokes seemed familiar but had no time to ponder it as Yu Yuwei cast a jade-scissors spell that struck the seal.

Boom!

The impact only caused the seal to sway slightly. The intertwined yellow and white light descended from the sky and transformed into a deep-colored barrier. The bright barrier shimmered as yellow and white light flowed across it like ink, enveloping an area several kilometers wide in all directions.

Rumble!

The barrier closed with a thunderous roar. Yu Yuwei’s face turned grim, and Quan Yi's expression shifted to regret as he cried out in alarm, “This is bad! We should’ve left long ago!”
