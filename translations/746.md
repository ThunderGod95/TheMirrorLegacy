# Chapter 746: The Intent of Purple Smoke

A contemplative Li Ximing set down his teacup, yet he still did not put away the jade slip, sighing as he spoke.

"Daoist Master, how do you see this matter with Profound Peak Gate?"

Tinglan saw that he was in no hurry to put the jade slip away and a hint of a smile appeared on her face. "I've been traveling overseas for years, so I don't know the specifics. Daoist Master Changxi, rising from such a minor clan, has already achieved something quite extraordinary. My master mentioned him once... he was very devoted to his clan."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. The woman continued, "After all, we are neighbors. Our Purple Smoke Immortal Gate has been watching. The former Haiying and Haiting, and later Gujun and Tingyun, were all fine supplements. He valued his clan, and that is why he did not act. A cunning rabbit has three burrows, and a Purple Mansion Daoist Master is no less. Now that he has died, Profound Peak Gate may seem to have no way to recover, but in reality, their retreat paths are more numerous than their forward ones. The Immortal Sect might not be saved, but the bloodline and Dao lineage are as steady as a mountain."

"What's more, doesn't the Moongaze Immortal Clan stand with them?"

At this, Li Ximing quickly shook his head.

Though he had not known Changxi for long and had often heard the Daoist Master's name accompanied by disrespectful jokes, he now understood. "Senior Changxi was a man of many thoughts, but he repeatedly mentioned Shanji Prefecture in his final days. He said the million-strong population of the prefecture was the fruit of his life's work and that he had protected them for hundreds of years. Now, unable to continue protecting them, he looked around and saw that only the Purple Smoke Immortal Gate was a legitimate and righteous holy land of pure cultivation. He could only feel at ease entrusting these people to the hands of the righteous path."

Whatever Tinglan was thinking, hearing such high praise made it impossible to refuse the first statement. "We can only thank the elder for his high regard. But as you also said, our Purple Smoke Immortal Gate belongs to the righteous Dao. It is a holy land of pure cultivation. As for the matters of the Immortal Dao, we naturally burn talismans for a higher purpose, to receive the Immortal Mandate from the Moonlight Origin Mansion, and to focus on self-cultivation by guarding our hearts and understanding our nature."

"The Origin Mansion once allocated several prefectures to our Purple Smoke Immortal Gate, and we have guarded those prefectures. We must not cross that boundary... please forgive us."

'Moonlight Origin Mansion?'

Li Ximing was genuinely stunned by her words. He had considered a thousand reasons for her to refuse, but this was not one of them. This excuse was utterly high-sounding and righteous. It took him a moment to recover before he finally spoke.

"I see... this Zhaojing was presumptuous."

The two azure dots in the corner of Tinglan's eyes flickered, and she gave him another look. "Your clan is a rising star and does not yet understand. In truth, the Xiao Clan and your Li Clan followed precedent to become Immortal Clans, separating themselves from the Azure Pond Sect. This precedent, this rule, was a regulation of the Origin Mansion. Elder Si was simply acting in accordance with the ancient rules."

When she finished, Li Ximing realized that Tinglan's earlier words were not a complete refusal. The Moonlight Origin Mansion had many rules that still operated within Jiangnan. Although they might not always be in effect, a Purple Mansion Daoist Master would not violate them unless there was a significant conflict of interest.

He recalled many things: the conservative names of the Immortal Sects and Immortal Gates, the superficial unity between the Green Pine and Supreme Yang Dao lineages, how the various clans retreated from Green Pine Temple to let the Six Gates reside there, and the immense reverence Xuanmiao Temple showed for Sword Gate...

'Even as these six clans secretly plot against each other, their territories barely ever change. They always hold on to their own small plots of land... and all their conflicts are taken overseas...'

'The Six Clans truly hold a transcendent status. Yue Cultivating Sect is reclusive, and Profound Peak Gate is a sect in name only. The Yue State is now essentially two sects, six gates, and three clans... but one sect and four gates cannot be moved.'

Li Ximing gradually came to a realization. A sudden thought surfaced in his mind.

"Snow Wings Gate has been closed for hundreds of years! It has reached the point where mortals have entered the mountains and no disciples have come out... and yet no one has ever tried to touch it! Could it be for this very reason... because it is tightly surrounded by the Green Pine Dao lineage and its land is barren, it has been able to cling to existence until today?"

Many thoughts passed through his mind, but his expression only showed a sigh. "Daoist Master Tinglan... my family has tried its best, but we can no longer protect the entire Shanji Prefecture. What a pity for the people there!"

Tinglan chuckled in return. "That is not difficult. You only need to invite a Purple Mansion Daoist Master to reside there. No one in Jiangnan dislikes more land, and there are many Purple Mansion cultivators who want to establish a Dao lineage here. They only lack a guarantor. The old ones are too cautious to come, and the young ones are too playful... as long as our two families come to an agreement, and we ask for Sword Gate's approval, the matter will be settled."

This gave Li Ximing pause for thought. The more he considered it, the more his brow furrowed. If there was a friendly Purple Mansion Daoist Master nearby, it would not be a terrible thing. However, with the Profound Peak Dao lineage now in his family's hands, it would not be a popular move. Sending the Kong clan members away would be a bit awkward for his family, and it would be hard to explain to Xuanmiao Temple.

'I can give it a try...'

He turned his thoughts and put away the jade slip. "If we go with this idea, can your Immortal Gate first send people to Shanji to gather the forces there? My family does not have the energy to watch over it. I'm afraid that by the time we have news, Shanji Prefecture will have been plundered clean."

"That is secondary."

Seeing that he had put the item away, Tinglan frowned. "If we finalize the matter, there are two conditions. One, the Profound Peak Gate's sect location must be given to them. Otherwise, how can a dignified Daoist Master start a sect? If the spiritual essence-rich land is already someone else's, where will they cultivate? That would be a loss of face."

"Second, Kong Haiying must die."

Li Ximing had expected this. He sighed internally, and Tinglan's expression turned serious. "Let me warn you of something here. If Kong Haiying does not die, the conflict between your clan and the Capital immortals Dao will only worsen day by day, quickly escalating to a point where it is difficult to mediate. Yehui is not an extremist, but he will not tolerate Kong Haiying under any circumstances. Kong Haiying's opportunities are not shallow; he truly has the potential to break through to the next realm!"

"You still have to refine pills for me, after all. If you start a real fight with him, it will likely turn the entire Jiangnan area into a chaotic mess, and I will have no place to refine my pills..."

"It's the same for the Profound Peak Gate's sect location... if it's handed over to someone else, what Daoist Master could tolerate having a few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators still on the verge of breaking through within their sect? If they succeed in breaking through and coming out of seclusion, who would that sect belong to? Who would Shanji Prefecture belong to?"

"The fact that the Profound Peak lineage is in your family's hands is already a reason for Daoist Masters who wish to move inland to hesitate. Once they occupy Shanji and Profound Peak, the Kong clan members in the Wilderness will be, at best, a remnant clan, and at worst, remnants of an enemy. Your family would at least have to send the Kong clan members to them, forcing them to put on a show of gratitude before a reconciliation can be considered."

Although Li Ximing knew the matter was difficult, he sighed after hearing her explanation and nodded. "I understand... are your pills urgent, Daoist Master? If I can't resolve this matter, I'm afraid it will be difficult to refine them immediately."

"It's fine. I can wait for three to five years. Besides... I'm going to the Northern Sea in a few days, so I won't have time to set up the formation for you right away."

Tinglan clearly didn't expect Li Ximing to be able to refine the pills immediately. The two exchanged a few polite words and settled on the details of their agreement. Tinglan pointed to the clay pot on the table.

"I'll give you the formula for the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill to study first. Once you are prepared, you can come to our Purple Smoke Immortal Gate to retrieve the Immeasurable Water and Fire and the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness."

Li Ximing agreed and took his leave. Tinglan escorted him out. Below the purple jade platform, Cui Jueyin and the Purple Smoke cultivator, Wei Danying, were chatting amiably. Their relationship seemed much warmer than the transactional exchange between the two Daoist Masters.

Although Cui Jueyin's appearance was not outstanding, he was well-read and his demeanor was refined, making conversation with him a pleasant experience. Wei Danying listened with great interest. When the two Daoist Masters appeared, they immediately became respectful and retreated behind them.

"Safe travels, Zhaojing..."

Tinglan escorted him out of the blessed land. Li Ximing flew away, deep in thought. After a long time, he sighed internally.

'My family cannot protect the Profound Peak Gate's sect location and Shanji Prefecture right now.'

Li Ximing had considered the Purple Smoke Immortal Gate's attitude, but he hadn't expected Tinglan to have a single, unwavering word"kill"for Kong Haiying. He found it truly surprising.

When Tinglan had spoken from the perspective of the Purple Smoke Immortal Gate, Li Ximing understood. They had no intention of occupying Shanji, but they were open to the idea of inviting a Purple Mansion Daoist Master as a buffer and doing a favor for a friend... In this regard, his family was somewhat in her way.

But his thoughts did not stop at the Purple Smoke Immortal Gate. The next moment, he thought of another person:

'Yehui!'

If another Purple Mansion Daoist Master appearing in Shanji Prefecture was merely slightly awkward for the Li family, something they wouldn't get much benefit from... for Yehui, as long as he was willing to give up some benefits to lure someone in, it would be the best thing that could happen!

Yehui was a cultivator from the Eastern Sea. If he truly couldn't take over the Profound Peak Gate's sect location, he could heartlessly give up and invite a friendly Purple Mansion Daoist Master into Shanji. His family's situation would instantly become difficult... this new Daoist Master would not only have their sights set on the Profound Peak Gate but would also want to sever the Kong clan's lineage!

If this Purple Mansion Daoist Master was invited by the Purple Smoke Immortal Gate, the Li family would still have the option of sending the Kong clan members back and allowing the Profound Peak lineage to merge with another's power. But if it was a friend of Yehui's, there would be no reason to send them back, and it would only lead to open hostility.

'Yehui would have no more worries. My family would be too busy dealing with the threats from the Wilderness to care about Jiangbei...'

Yehui hadn't done this yet for two reasons. First, he was unwilling to give up the Profound Peak Gate's sect location. Second, he hadn't reached an agreement with the Purple Smoke Immortal Gate and Sword Gate... but that didn't mean it wouldn't happen.

'Has Yehui approached Tinglan? Were Tinglan's words out of goodwill, or a subtle reminder because she hadn't reached an agreement with Ye Hui?'

A chill ran through his heart.

'Regardless, Shanji and the Profound Peak Gate's sect location must be dealt with quickly. But to deal with this sect location, I must deal with the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in seclusion from the Kong clan. Even if I want to slightly ease tensions with Capital immortals Dao to free up my hands for pill refining, I must at least deal with Kong Haiying!'

However, Changxi had said there were three people in seclusion: the guest elder Fu En, his great-grandson Kong Haiying, and the former sect master Kong Tingyun. Li Ximing couldn't be sure that the person who died was Fu En, or even that the few in seclusion were Kong Haiying and the others.

Thinking this far, even Li Ximing, who could understand Changxi's mistrust in his later years, felt a sense of fatigue and quiet anger.

"Hiding things left and right... making it hard even to help. So be it... since Changxi was so calculating, it's impossible that he didn't know that Kong Haiying was a matter of life and death for Profound Peak Gate. I can no longer care about what the others from Profound Peak think... if I don't take over Profound Peak and use the Immortal Mirror to find out the truth, there will be no need to protect it!"

He left the Purple Smoke territory and headed for home, a plan gradually forming in his mind. He appeared on Gardenia Scenery Mountain, and Cui Jueyin descended from the sky, standing quietly beside him.

Li Ximing gave his orders.

"Go and invite the several managers, as well as Que'wan and Chenghui. We'll go on a trip together."

...

The Wilderness.

The sky was dawning, and a humid mist filled the mountains.

Several days had passed since the news of Daoist Master Changxi's final wishes, and Kong Guxi still hadn't fully recovered. He had intended to read scriptures until midnight, but in a daze, the sky had already begun to brighten.

He changed his clothes and came out of the hall. The area outside was empty. The stone steps were unswept, covered in fallen leaves, making him wonder if everyone had gone to join other families.

After wandering for a while, he finally found Kong Yu, who was drinking in the mountains with a flushed face. Kong Guxi bowed and asked,

"Great-uncle, where have Qiuyan and the others gone?"

Kong Yu had been drinking all night but could not get drunk. He was still very lucid. "Xiang has been locked up by you. A group of Capital immortals Dao cultivators arrived in the Wilderness, likely from Shanji Prefecture. I don't know what a mess it has become. Qiuyan has taken people to intercept them."

He paused, emphasizing, "The Li family's people are also there."

Kong Guxi acknowledged this and asked about the whereabouts of Kong Guli.

"Where is my elder brother?"

Kong Yu raised his brows. "Patriarch Chenghui sent someone to ask for our family's soul lamps and life jades. Your elder brother just took him there."

Kong Guxi was speechless. He turned toward the front courtyard, where he heard a commotion on the stone steps. Several large bags were being carried. The sect master of Profound Peak looked up and saw his elder brother, Kong Guli, bringing Fu Yuezi up the mountain.

Kong Guli seemed to have lost his soul, but Fu Yuezi was as composed as ever. He carried his Dharma Artifact and waved at him. Kong Guxi went up to greet him, grasping his elder brother's hands and finding them ice cold. He could only ask,

"I heard Great-uncle say... you just left..."

Kong Guli said forlornly, "I did just leave, but who knew that when the news from a few days ago reached them, the elders on the mountain had already packed the soul lamps and life jades, Dao lineage techniques, and all the other items? They all wanted to run here, so naturally, they came very quickly."

Kong Guxi had no words. He saw streaks of light flying through the air, and the noise on the mountain grew louder. He had only walked a few steps when he saw a group of people descend from the sky. The golden-eyed man leading the group strode with the posture of a dragon. Kong Guxi's heart felt as if it had been gripped by a large hand. He quickly stepped forward.

"Greetings, Patriarch... why have you come?"

Li Zhouwei was as courteous as ever. He nodded and replied,

"My injuries have healed a lot. I have been ordered by the Daoist Master to come and hold the fort in the Wilderness."

Sweat beaded on Kong Guxi's forehead. He nodded repeatedly, but before he could ask for more details, a flash of celestial light appeared before him, and the surroundings suddenly became brilliant. Everyone immediately lowered their heads and bowed.

Above them, a Daoist Master in a white robe with golden patterns was standing, observing them. This sight terrified Kong Guli, who retreated several steps. Kong Guxi was shocked and immediately knelt down. The rest of the Profound Peak Gate members, whether they had seen him before or not, knew he was a Daoist Master. For a moment, no one on the mountain was standing. Only respectful voices could be heard, one after another.

As he knelt, Kong Guxi glanced up. Li Ximing's expression showed little emotion, but the fact that the Profound Peak Dao lineage had just handed over the command to Shanji and the sect location made Kong Guxi feel a deep, baseless fear.

He knelt properly and then heard the Daoist Master speak, his voice neither hurried nor angry.

"Bring me Kong Haiying's soul lamp."

A cold chill ran from Kong Guxi's heart to the soles of his feet. The sect master could not see too much of the struggle between Purple Mansion Daoist Masters and the big picture, but based on the progression of events, he had already sensed too many unfavorable things. He could only bow respectfully and say,

"This junior obeys."
