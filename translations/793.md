# Chapter 793: The Three Profundities

Sea's Cape.

The coral cave was brilliantly lit. Seawater churned, rolling up plumes of fine white sand that flowed from the cave like a waterfall, drifting and settling in layers on the seafloor. A large school of white shellfish shuttled through the sand, stirring dazzling reflections in the water.

The Daoist in white-gold robes sat with his hands on his knees. With every breath, roiling spiritual qi of the Bright Yang surged, and faint, violet flames intermittently flew out to circle beside him.

Li Ximing had refined three Profound Adamant Essence Gathering Pills in succession, suppressing and grinding away more than half of the flames raging within his Juque Palace. His situation immediately improved.

He still possessed a good number of spiritual items and treasure medicines, and even more spiritual water. Applying the right remedy, he used the "White Waterfall Cold Water" he had received at the Purple Mansion Dharma Assembly, along with his own clan's "Taiyun Flower," to refine a cauldron of pills. He swallowed them all in one go. The scorched, glazed color on his Dharma body slowly returned to normal.

More than a year passed in a flash. Estimating that sixty to seventy percent of his injuries had recovered, and that Qingxu Temple had likely gathered most of what he needed, Li Ximing finally opened his eyes. A flash of light filled the cave. He took out the jade pendant from his sleeve and checked it; nothing major had happened at home.

"This single jade pendant, nourished and enhanced by my divine ability, was secretly given to Grandfather. It has not yet been crushed... meaning the clan has not yet faced a crisis of survival."

He casually collected the array plate in the cave and passed outside. Li Ximing found that the seawater was still azure, but the seabed was completely different. As far as the eye could see, it was covered in fine white sand. He could faintly see several Embyronic Breathing realm white shellfish busily working the sea floor.

"Curious..."

Li Ximing understood with a single glance. He was clueless about formations and couldn't seal his divine abilities. A Bright Yang Purple Mansion cultivator practicing here had instantly altered the spiritual mechanics of the location. The coral cave should have spewed out Radiant Sky Stone day and night, but the spiritual mechanics at Sea's Cape were insufficient, causing it to spew only layers of white sand.

Even so, it had been enough to make passing demonic beasts stay and settle. Seeing this, it looked like it was about to become a small spiritual land. Li Ximing scanned the area. There were one or two traces of excavation nearby; he didn't know if it was Qingxu Temple or some other group that had come to harvest.

'It's not easy... In Jiangnan, Radiant Sky Stone is used to construct palaces... the bigger the block, the better... This is the first time I've seen anyone collect it as spiritual sand.'

Since fate had brought it about, and there was a rare stretch of vibrant life beneath his feet, Li Ximing simply stretched out his hand, brought two fingers to his lips, and spat out a mouthful of Bright Yang Purple Fire.

The purple fire hovered before him. Li Ximing then took out a jade pot. It was merely a Qi Refining item, kept purely for drinking tea. He formed a seal and cast an art, using his divine ability to leave behind three to five strands of inheritance, before locking the purple fire inside.

Li Ximing's control over fire could only be described as terrifying. The jade pot immediately transformed into a violet-red color, searing hot, radiating waves of bright solar brilliance. With a casual toss, he threw it back into the cave.

The stalled waterfall of white sand began to flow once more. Li Ximing estimated that this mouthful of purple fire, slowly dissipating, could keep the process running for seventy or eighty years. Struck by inspiration, he lifted a brush and wrote:

"Valley Wind."

He flicked his sleeve, and his figure vanished. Crossing a hundred li, he reappeared above Qingxu Temple.

He saw a vast, fertile plain of wheat blowing in the wind, the monastery buildings scattered elegantly within. Only a year had passed, but Qingxu Temple was completely different. The monks in yellow robes no longer seemed to cover the mountains and fields; instead, they were dotted amongst farmers in coarse, short clothes.

He descended on his light, materializing in the highest monastery courtyard. The area seemed empty. The monks of Qingxu Temple had indeed dwindled; presumably, they had all removed their monastic robes to reclaim the wasteland.

Li Ximing sat down at the stone table in the courtyard. He was just hearing the sound of footsteps when Xia Shouyu's accusatory voice arrived first. The woman was highly displeased, snapping, "It's just one pill recipe! It's been half a month and you still haven't gotten it?! How much skill do those people even have that you're finding it so difficult?"

"Shouyu... even the cleverest housewife can't cook without rice. Without resources... what are we supposed to exchange?"

This was followed by a clamor; clearly, many people had arrived. Xia Shouyu dealt with them, annoyed, and sneered, "No resources? You think I can't see through your petty schemes? You're just after those few pills the Daoist Master gave me. I'd dare to give them... but would you little nobodies dare to accept?"

The men following her were clearly all from the Xia family. Their expressions varied. The leader glared, wanting to curse her, but swallowed his words out of fear. He retorted, "Your words are meaningless. We don't even know when the Daoist Master will return... How can the temple have that many resources to use?"

"Pah!"

Xia Shouyu pushed the door open, but the curse on her lips died in her throat. She saw the courtyard was filled with light. The man in the white-gold Daoist robe was sitting at the stone table, holding a pill manual, reading it distractedly. The Profound Light in the center of his brow flickered, striking terror into the heart.

_Thud!_

Xia Shouyu had only managed to get half a foot into the courtyard before she dropped to her knees. The expressions of the men following her also changed drastically. One after another, they fell like rolling gourds, collapsing in a heap.

In an instant, the area outside the courtyard, inside the courtyard, and on the steps was filled with kneeling figures. One had slipped on the threshold, his rear end stuck high in the air, yet he didn't dare move. The ground was covered in figures, still as statues.

Clearly, neither the island-protecting grand array of Qingxu Temple nor the arrays within the courtyard existed for this Daoist Master. Xia Shouyu truly felt as if half her life had been scared out of her. She trembled. "The Daoist Master's immortal chariot has arrived... this lowly one failed to welcome you from afar... please forgive this offense..."

Li Ximing sat in the seat of honor. His gaze shifted from the pill manual in his hand. He gave a noncommittal nod. When dealing with these overseas cultivators, one couldn't afford to be too polite. He just raised an eyebrow. "The pill recipes."

Pill recipes!

Xia Shouyu kowtowed, immediately retrieving a jade box from her storage bag. She turned to look at the trembling crowd behind her. Every last one of them was now behaving, frantically pulling pill recipes from their sleeves and passing them to Xia Shouyu.

She shot the men a venomous glare before turning back. She presented everything respectfully in her hands—a thick stack of beast-hide scrolls piled atop the jade box. Xia Shouyu shifted an inch forward and said respectfully, "This lowly one has spent the last year sending out every cultivator from the temple, searching everywhere. Everything within sight of Sea's Cape, anything famous or rumored... we have checked it all. The harvest is right here."

Li Ximing picked them up one by one to read. No one on the ground dared to move. Soon, the old Temple Master Xia also rushed over, saw the scene, and didn't dare speak, hurriedly kneeling on the ground.

Li Ximing flipped through them. As expected, most were fabricated nonsense. Only three recipes looked reliable, all using ancient spiritual items and resources.

"One from the Azure Manifestation lineage: 'Treasured Manifestation Divine Mountain Pill,' using 'Supreme Concealed Origin' as the main ingredient. One from the Supreme Yin lineage: 'Single Qi Heart-Overwhelming Pill,' using 'Clear Yin Womb Herb' as the main ingredient. And the last one, from the Capital Guard lineage: 'Purple Water Immortal Marsh Pill,' refined using Crimson-Headed Profound Soul and 'Immortal Pure Qi'."

He had to admit, ancient cultivators were truly wealthy. Not one of the spiritual items listed here was below the Purple Mansion level. Among them, "Supreme Concealed Origin" was a supreme treasure of the Azure Manifestation lineage. Who would actually use it for alchemy?

As for the "Clear Yin Womb Herb," he had never even heard of it. "Immortal Pure Qi" was a Purple Mansion spiritual item of the Pure Qi lineage, and Crimson-Headed Profound Soul was almost certainly also a precious spiritual item of the Capital Guard lineage...

The only one Li Ximing held any hope for was the "Single Qi Heart-Overwhelming Pill." If he substituted the core ingredient with "Supreme Yin Lunar Essence," perhaps with some tinkering, it might produce some effect.

Just as he was reading the recipes, someone hurried up from below. Not daring to approach, the person only handed up a jade slip, which was passed along the line of kneeling cultivators until it reached Xia Shouyu.

Xia Shouyu recognized it at a glance: it was the very pill recipe they had just been haggling over. It had clearly been acquired long ago; they were just dragging their feet, demanding one of her pills in exchange, obviously intending to pocket it themselves.

Though furious inwardly, she could only present it respectfully. Li Ximing's eyes lit up. With a thought, the jade slip flew into his hand.

There was one reason for his interest: of all these ancient pill recipes, this was finally one recorded in a jade slip!

He scanned it. The jade slip was not newly inscribed; it looked like an original. It recorded the "Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art," a lineage of the Secret Enclosure Sect.

Although this Secret Enclosure Sect (Mìfán) sounded similar to the Secret Diffusion (Mìfàn) Monastery of Xiaoshi Mountain, this lineage was no newcomer. It already had a reputation in Jiangnan. The Secret Enclosure Sect Ruins in the Eastern Sea were famous; both Li Encheng of the Azure Pond Sect and the Chi Clan Ancestor, Chi Wei, had benefited greatly from the Water Wall Pearl found there.

But when he looked at the jade slip in his hand, suspicion immediately arose. He raised an eyebrow. "Since you bought this from someone else... shouldn't you have transcribed a copy? Why bring the original back?"

A man behind Xia Shouyu shuffled forward on his knees, trembling. "G-Great... Great Lord... that person also stole it... His alchemy skills are crude... This jade slip is mysterious and vast. Lowly cultivators like us... our heads spin just looking at it, let alone trying to copy it..."

Li Ximing narrowed his eyes. "Oh? And he was willing to sell it?"

Being questioned like this, the man was so nervous his calves cramped. He cried out, "T-Truly, Daoist Master! He already tried to refine it according to the steps. This pill art is already ineffective. That's why he sold it!"

Li Ximing slowly sat upright, solemnly immersing his spiritual sense into the slip. Sure enough, he saw the vast, ocean-like text within.

"At the dawn of heaven and earth, Yin and Yang formed first. The Heavenly Lord established his world, and the Five Virtues were thus born, bestowing the Three Profundities, which became the First Dao Archive. Around the Three Profundities, the Four Daos supported them. Below the Three Profundities, only then came the Twelve Mansions... The Secret Diffusion lineage inherits the Encompassing Profoundity..."

Sudden realization struck Li Ximing.

"The Secret Enclosure Sect is already an extremely ancient lineage, yet it's also part of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition... That is unheard of... With such a massive background as the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition, it's no wonder that just one or two opportunities from it could produce figures like Changxiao, Yehui, and Guo Shentong..."

He now valued this "Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art" even more. He began reading it on the spot. The more he read, the stranger and more regrettable it seemed. Finally, he slapped the jade slip against his hand, unsure what to say.

The "Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art" was extremely bizarre. This art didn't follow the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao path of "seeking the pill through nature"; instead, it advocated "seeking the pill through destiny." It was exceedingly complex. Li Ximing gave it a rough overview; the difficulty was extremely high.

'No wonder the Sea's Cape cultivators couldn't refine it. Even I would be extremely strained trying to refine this. Sea's Cape is filled with cultivators of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao... how could they possibly succeed? Even if they learned everything... they would end up refining their own destiny away...'

He looked at the jade slip, his mind racing.

'If that's the case... perhaps there is a reason why Guo Shentong and Changxiao were the most ruthless in their attempts to harm the one favored by fate. Those two must have obtained some technique from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition, perhaps they were also scheming for this aspect.'

'Changxiao was plotting against our clan's Scion this time, too... Unfortunately, I didn't expect him to be so decisive, so ruthless. He's the head of a Purple Mansion-level power, yet when he struck, he aimed to create a mortal enemy...'

It was a pity that he only held a pill art. He couldn't even glimpse the actual Dao lineage of the Secret Enclosure Sect, let alone the even more ancient Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition. Stowing the jade slip, Li Ximing fell into thought.

"The Three Profundities. Encompassing Profoundity is already one. I wonder if Comprehending Profundity can reach that level. That leaves one more, I wonder whose it is... The Green Pine Dao Lineage dominates Jiangnan. Perhaps tracing it upward, it too is one of the Profundities."

He remained silent. Xia Shouyu and the others kneeling below were suffering, waiting anxiously. Finally, Li Ximing raised his gaze and ordered, "You stay. The rest of you, scatter."

The courtyard emptied as if swept by a gust of wind, leaving only Xia Shouyu kneeling. Li Ximing studied her and asked, "What lineage do you cultivate?"

Xia Shouyu hurriedly replied respectfully, "This lowly one practices the _Art of Suppressing Fire and Expelling Cold_. The immortal foundation it builds is called 'White Li Heart.' As for what lineage it is, no ancestor has ever succeeded in cultivating it, so we do not know what it is."

She immediately presented the cultivation art. Li Ximing scanned it. It was indeed an unranked ancient art. Judging by the contents, it wasn't particularly profound, most likely third or fourth grade. He raised an eyebrow. "How rare... it's actually Blazing Fire. This is truly a lineage seldom seen in Jiangnan... Good, good. An unexpected delight!"

Li Ximing had long intended to bring Xia Shouyu back to the lake. Every Dao lineage has its own strengths and weaknesses. The lineage she cultivated was, naturally, the more different from the Li family's, the better. Even if this woman failed her breakthrough, this _Art of Suppressing Fire and Expelling Cold_ was a rare lineage manual in itself.

He smiled and nodded, considering the medicinal pills.

'Unfortunately, I don't know the principles of generation and restraint for the Blazing Fire lineage. I only recall descriptions of it 'calming dampness,' 'expelling rain,' and 'transforming cold into heat.' I should avoid the Water Virtue and Cold Qi. Choosing the Fire Virtue is safest.'

He raised his gaze. "Are there any demonic beasts nearby that spit fire and wield flames? I promised you the Great Dao of Foundation Establishment; I should deliver."

Hearing this, Xia Shouyu was practically overwhelmed with joy. She kowtowed repeatedly, her head striking the ground. "This lowly one cannot repay this grace in nine lifetimes! If you have any command in the future, I will die ten thousand deaths to fulfill it..."

She didn't offer too much fawning praise, only saying respectfully, "I have only heard that the Peacock Sea to the east has many islands and many peacocks. Each one is as large as a courtyard, swallowing metal and spitting fire, ferocious and intimidating. The sea also holds single-horned ox-demons. They are all demonic beasts that spit fire and wield flames."

Li Ximing recalled that the Peacock Sea was also home to a Purple Mansion power, Nine Mounds Mountain. Logically, he could pay them a visit. But looking at this clever woman, a plan formed in his mind:

'Zhouming is... he might not even succeed at Foundation Establishment... His reputation has never been good, making him easy to manipulate. I cannot let him marry a direct descendant of some Purple Mansion clan! This Xia Shouyu is intelligent, clever, and exceptionally talented. Her background is clean... and she is very beautiful... She is perfectly suitable.'

As for Li Zhouming's own opinion, Li Ximing wasn't worried. That child was an incorrigible lecher; he wouldn't have any complaints about marrying her. Thus, he said, "Prepare yourself well. Once you achieve your immortal foundation, another opportunity will await you."

His figure dissipated like flowing light. The sky was already dimming, and the courtyard instantly grew dark. Xia Shouyu's eyes, however, glittered brightly. She stood up, thinking to herself:

'As long as I have the chance to leave this destitute place... as long as I don't have to be trapped on this desolate island until I die... this is a heaven-sent fortune!'
