# Chapter 694: Dongfang Heyun

This place must have been a subject of negotiation between the Azure Pond Sect’s Purple Mansion cultivators and the Dragon Clan, where certain promises were made. A Foundation Establishment cultivator searching here must have violated a taboo.

Li Xizhi quickly formed a hypothesis, but this was not the time to dwell on it. He silently nodded and softly said, "There are always conflicts of interest within the sect, such things are inevitable. But my master's life is at stake. I cannot stand idly by."

The Purple Mansion cultivator stood with his hands behind his back, his eyes appearing to smile. Holding two severed heads in his hands, he spoke, "Good! Such courage! Such audacity!"

Li Xizhi lowered his gaze, suppressing his emotions, as he heard the Purple Mansion cultivator coldly say, "Do you know my name?"

Li Xizhi understood that this was the final test and had already formed his judgment in his heart, High nose, narrow eyes, flowing hair and beard. Clad in golden scales and a voice like a howling wind. This must be a dragon! Its supernatural abilities shine with a deep blue hue, embodying the essence of water, yet it does not resemble the dragon forms from the Azure Pond... It must be a newly ascended great demonic beast, one who profited from Dongfang You's downfall…

He bowed slightly and replied, "Junior greets the great demonic beast, Muhai."

The Purple Mansion cultivator suddenly burst into laughter, revealing his sharp, glistening white teeth. They were long and thin, appearing especially crystalline in the water. He laughed and said, "You have trespassed here and must be punished. Now, flee for your life!"

"Many thanks, senior!" Li Xizhi clasped his hands in salute, then swiftly retreated, riding his Heavenly Glow southward. The dragon waited for a moment before stirring his lips and tongue, exhaling a breath of icy coldness between his teeth.

The chill spun rapidly in the air, transforming into a deep blue droplet of water that floated and trembled continuously.

He picked up the two severed heads and flicked his fingers lightly. The water droplet fell into the mouth of one corpse, causing its flesh and blood to boil instantly, stretching and reshaping like soft clay. Soon, it took the form of a young boy. Muhai chuckled twice, his gleaming white fangs flashing as he released his grip, "Heyun, you have only one hour."

As soon as his words fell, the young boy came to life. His eyes were lively, his demeanor graceful and natural. After tidying his clothes, he gave a slight bow and disappeared southward like a flash of lightning.

Muhai stood with his hands behind his back as the great void beside him tore open, forming a figure who asked, "Dongfang Changmu, what has happened?"

Muhai blinked his emerald-green eyes and spoke softly, "The Azure Pond seeks to kill with a borrowed knife, deliberately sending a Foundation Establishment cultivator here. But I sense he has some backing. Father said that Suiguan does not resemble a human in form, so we should be cautious."

The figure nodded reluctantly, slowly revealing its form. It was a narrow-eyed woman of imposing presence, her robes billowing as she softly said, "Father and Dragon Monarch Xiyang will arrive soon. Be prepared."

Muhai nodded and smiled, "With both Dragon Monarchs acting together, we should be able to take Thundercloud Temple and complete the Thunder Summoning and Lightning Control foretold in the Azure Prophecy Scroll."

The dragon woman shook her head slightly, her expression tinged with melancholy, and merely said, "But while the Daoist Master Shangyuan is breaking through and the humans are entangled in internal conflict, we should seize this secret realm… Besides, that so-called Azure One is a figure from countless millennia ago. What was useful then may not be now."

Muhai simply chuckled, stroking the red whiskers on his lips as he replied, "He is an immortal, he would not be wrong."

----

Li Xizhi sped away on his Heavenly Glow, streaking a deep trail of multicolored light across the sea's surface. Holding a talisman in his hand, cold sweat trickled down his back.

Punishment.

He had no time to consider the causes and consequences. A chill surged behind him and when he looked toward the water, he saw tiny fragments of ice floating upon the surface.

Sensing something amiss, Li Xizhi watched as the seawater before him rose, transforming into a young figure. With neatly tied hair, fine eyebrows, and bright eyes, the figure adjusted his sleeves with graceful ease and said with a smile, "I am Dongfang Heyun. Greetings, fellow Daoist."

Hearing the surname Dongfang, Li Xizhi immediately recognized it as a method of the Dragon Clan from the Purple Mansion. He returned the courtesy as the gentle young man softly said, "By order of my Exalted Immortal lord, I have come to execute you. Forgive the offense…"

Li Xizhi had already placed his hand on his sword. Upon hearing these words, his sharp blade leaped from its sheath, flashing with radiant white light as he immediately executed the Celestial Moon Slash.

In terms of innate swordsmanship talent, Li Xizhi was not inferior to Li Xijun and was even older than him. However, due to his extensive practice of various spell arts, his focus was divided, making his current sword arc less refined than that of his younger cousin.

Dongfang Heyun was still adjusting his sleeves when he casually reached out, pinched the sword light between his fingers and crushed it instantly. Then, raising his gaze, he stepped forward.

With just this one move, Li Xizhi understood many things and thought, He is undefeatable!

The talismans in his grasp leaped into the air, transforming into streams of golden light. Three Foundation Establishment talismans shone brilliantly as they descended, intertwining to form a barrier.

If nothing else, Qingsui Peak had the greatest number of talismans. His grandmaster, Si Yuanbai, had been one of the greatest talisman makers of the Azure Pond Sect, leaving behind a vast collection before his westward departure. Another batch had been left by Yuan Tuan before he left, many of which now rested in Li Xizhi's possession.

As he released the three talismans, his figure dissipated like a mist of colored clouds, leaving behind three radiant trails in the air. In an instant, he had moved over two meters away, his sleeve of Heavenly Glow unfurling in the air, scattering like smoke and wisps of cotton, forming a small circle midair.

Yet Dongfang Heyun floated effortlessly in the wind. With a flick and a press of his fingers, the golden formation of talismans shifted an inch to the side and he stepped out of it with ease.

He continued forward, leaving the golden formation shimmering behind him. By now, Li Xizhi had already fled several miles away, vanishing into the distance. Dongfang Heyun dissolved into a wisp of misty rain, pursuing in silent chase.

Li Xizhi, riding his Heavenly Glow, vaguely sensed the shifting of the three golden talismans. His heart trembled slightly as he quickly analyzed the situation.

This person has not yet used the technique that allowed him to appear before me. There must be some limitations.

If he were a Purple Mansion cultivator, I should have perished already. Yet he does not resemble Foundation Establishment nor Purple Mansion Realm… Rather, he seems… as if he has received the divine power of Muhai!

His pupils reflected the endless expanse of sea and sky as he recalled the moment Dongfang Heyun had appeared. He thought to himself, He is likely neither of the Dragon Clan nor human… but rather a demonic spirit akin to the elements of heaven and earth, wind and rain… How rare!

To recognize the peculiarity of Dongfang Heyun, he had to thank Yu Su of Yuanwu Peak and his Jinwu Xi studies.

Knowing that his family would inevitably clash with Yuanwu Peak, Li Xizhi had been vigilant. He had learned from his father the strategy of planning before acting and had thoroughly studied the dharma artifacts, techniques, mindsets, and preferences of Yuanwu Peak's cultivators.

Coincidentally, Yu Su possessed a golden cage called Long Wind Cage, a treasured heirloom of the Yu family. It contained five imprisoned wind demonic beasts, each at the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm, which could merge into a Foundation Establishment Realm demonic wind. It was a truly extraordinary artifact.

This dharma artifact was an immortal treasure among Foundation Establishment items. Li Xizhi had studied it extensively, and now, seeing Dongfang Heyun, he felt a strong sense of familiarity.

The wind follows the tiger, the clouds follow the dragon

Considering his name, Li Xizhi deduced that Dongfang Heyun was, in all likelihood, a spirit cloud entity.

Just as a Master Monk gains strength by adhering to a Maha, he follows and serves the great demonic beast Muhai, thus receiving divine power… He is capable of shifting spiritual energy, manipulating talismans and dispersing or coalescing at will.

Having reached his conclusion, Li Xizhi made an immediate decision, remaining calm as he thought, I cannot entangle myself with mist and clouds in midair. I must descend into the water to plan my next move!

Behind him, Dongfang Heyun narrowed his eyes slightly, watching as Li Xizhi plunged into the water. He nodded subtly and thought, Ordinary people assume I am of the Dragon Clan and dare not engage me in water combat. But this cultivator, who refines heavenly radiance, is both quick-witted and decisive.

Frowning slightly as if concerned about his robes, he released a burst of mana to repel the seawater before descending.A trail of bubbles were left behind as he sank swiftly.

As expected, once Li Xizhi entered the water, Dongfang Heyun's speed slowed slightly, though not significantly. Li Xizhi dived deeper, and the light before him quickly dimmed.

Following behind, Dongfang Heyun retrieved a luminous blue pearl from his sleeve, placing it between his palms before exhaling softly.

Poof!

Ahead, Li Xizhi's feathered robe flared with radiant light, emitting small wisps of gray mist. His face paled instantly as he spat out blood. The spell he had been forming in his hands reached completion. With his two fingers pressed together, he whispered, "Activate."

His figure instantly split into multiple shadows, yet instead of dispersing, they overlapped and merged together.

"An illusion technique? How could that possibly deceive me?" Dongfang Heyun frowned slightly as another jade pearl appeared in his palm. He flicked it forward with a slight movement of his fingers.

But Li Xizhi suddenly turned back, forming a spell seal in his hands. His middle and ring fingers bent into his palm while the others pointed outward which shaped the image of a cauldron. Layers upon layers of phantom shadows coalesced into a faintly visible, massive cauldron.

The jade pearl fell into the cauldron, erupting with a thunderous explosion. All of Li Xizhi’s phantom shadows shattered at once, his breath momentarily stalling. In the next instant, he flipped his palm and hurled a counterattack straight at Dongfang Heyun’s face.

The Rainbow Phantom Split technique was meant to confuse enemies, but Li Xizhi knew that Dongfang Heyun was a master of transformation and would never be fooled. Instead, he propelled himself away on his Heavenly Glow.

Yet the nature of techniques is ever-changing. Although his phantom split could not deceive Dongfang Heyun, it served as a medium to dissipate the backlash of his cauldron-dissolving technique, mitigating part of the force and shielding him from Dongfang Heyun’s spell.

Dongfang Heyun smiled gently and politely, watching as Li Xizhi reversed the spell upon him. His figure blurred and dissipated into a vast mist, vanishing completely.

Li Xizhi had barely flown several miles when frost suddenly began forming at his side, inch by inch. He carefully observed his surroundings and immediately halted. Before him, the mist thickened and Dongfang Heyun’s face reappeared once more.

Not even an hour...

This thought flashed through Li Xizhi’s mind as a round shield shot out from his sleeve, flying rapidly toward Dongfang Heyun.

Li Xizhi had cultivated both swordsmanship and spell arts to impressive levels, but he lacked a proper dharma artifact. During his years of cultivation on the peak, apart from refining the Dawn Colored Qi, he had never requested any treasures from his family.

Qingsui Peak had always been poor and the artifact he pulled from his sleeve turned out to be nothing more than a mid-grade Qi Cultivation item. Seeing this, Dongfang Heyun raised an eyebrow and said with a chuckle, "I thought you were an immortal descendant of the Purple Mansion!"

Clearly, Dongfang Heyun had finally discerned Li Xizhi’s background from this detail. Though he spoke casually, his hands did not slow. He extended his palm and the seawater instantly hardened into a steel-like wall. The water surged wildly and scattered Li Xizhi’s spell into disarray.

Then, he transformed his palm into a blade that was as smooth as jade, cleaving through the void. Li Xizhi had just enough time to execute half of Gold In Cloud, shifting his body sideways by a few feet.

Clang!

Li Xizhi’s feathered robe let out an ear-piercing wail as crimson blood erupted through the deep sea. His left arm was severed at the root, bursting into a brilliant cascade of multicolored radiance.

The feathered robe given to him by Yang Xiao’er was no ordinary garment. Golden light shimmered across its intricate patterns and responded instantly. Dazzling rays erupted and shot toward Dongfang Heyun, engulfing him completely.

A flicker of surprise flashed in Dongfang Heyun’s eyes. He raised a hand to shield his vision from the blinding light, yet fine, intricate holes appeared on his palm from the impact.

By the time he regained focus, only shimmering water remained before him, dyed with hues of rising colored mist, blood evaporating into radiant clouds. Li Xizhi was already gone, along with his severed arm.

The streak of light Li Xizhi left in his wake bore traces of red. Clearly, he had activated a secret technique. Doubt flickered across Dongfang Heyun’s face as he murmured, "Just where does he come from...?"

Dongfang Heyun understood his master’s intent well. If Li Xizhi truly were an immortal descendant of the Purple Mansion Realm, he should have possessed enough dharma relics, talismans, or other trump cards to last at least an hour in combat.

Yet this man was strange. His intelligence and tactics were first-class, yet his spell arts were a notch inferior. His feathered robe held mysterious power, yet his dharma artifacts were nothing but trash. The contradiction left Dongfang Heyun momentarily perplexed.

He paused for just a moment before a smile spread across his face. Adjusting his sleeves, he immediately took flight, transforming into a streak of white light as he pursued.

Ahead, Li Xizhi’s face was pale as the blood seeping from his wound transformed into multicolored clouds, fueling his escape technique.

His mastery of spell arts was far beyond that of ordinary cultivators. This Blood Harnessing Technique did not truly consume his essence blood but instead harnessed the natural flow of blood from his fresh wound to power the spell.

Once his leaking essence qi stabilized, he retrieved his severed arm from his embrace and carefully reattached it to his wound.

If things reach a desperate point, I may have no choice but to turn this arm into a spell itself...

The seawater here had turned a deep red-green hue. Li Xizhi calculated the distance, Zongquan Island was close. For some reason, Dongfang Heyun had hesitated in the water for a few moments, granting him a chance to accelerate. He could now vaguely see the defensive formations on the island.

Something’s wrong... Something’s off...

His complexion paled further as his mind raced. His thoughts flickered rapidly through his consciousness, but his trajectory was deviating more and more. He was drifting further from Zongquan Island.

Despite being in imminent danger, Li Xizhi's mind remained sharp. He kept replaying the words of the Purple Mansion's demonic dragon in his mind, Punishment... punishment... The cultivators of the Purple Mansion never go back on their word. If I hide within another sect’s formation, wouldn’t that make their punishment meaningless?

He struggled to deduce Muhai’s thoughts, formulating his conclusion in a flash, Muhai must despise how the Azure Pond Sect tried to use him as a weapon! But I trespassed into the Dragon Clan’s territory, which seems like a provocation... He can’t let me go easily...

Dongfang Heyun is far stronger than me. If this turns into a chase, I will die for sure... If he isn’t trying to kill me outright, then either he is restricted by time or I must pay a sufficient price to satisfy his authority!

No matter what, I absolutely cannot flee into my sect’s formation!

Gritting his teeth, he adjusted his escape path further southward, thinking to himself, If I embarrass Muhai, Dongfang Heyun will surely go on a rampage. I must not bring disaster upon my aunt!
