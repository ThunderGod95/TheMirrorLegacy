# Chapter 378: Black Robe

Watching Li Jiman hurry out of the hall, Chen Mufeng's gaze swept across the remnants of melons and fruit as well as the gold and jade cups. He stepped forward, his eyes fixed on the highest seat at the end of the hall.

"The King of Mount Yue is nothing but a puppet," he murmured to himself while he subconsciously stepped up to the platform. He placed his slender hand on the seat with intricate engravings in silence.

The Chen Family had always been exceptionally talented. Chen Mufeng, now at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, surpassed all but those from the main family. He took great pride in this achievement.

"The main family's bloodline is undoubtedly noble, so I can't possibly compare to them. But Tian Zhongqing and Xu Gongming are just a few years older than me... Who among them can match my talents and background?"

He was young and at the peak of his ambition. His heart was brimming with boundless dreams, and he could only fix his gaze on the seat of power.

Lost in thought, Chen Mufeng was staring at the chair when a group of white-armored cultivators suddenly parted the curtain and entered.

One of them respectfully greeted, "Young Master, the preparations are done. Your orders...?"

Chen Mufeng quickly retracted his hand from the chair as though he had been electrocuted by it. He cleared his throat and responded quickly.

"Let's go then."

Meanwhile in Lijing Town…

Li Yuanping, dressed in brocade, was meticulously writing with a vermillion brush, and a stack of wooden slips was neatly arranged on his desk. He glanced up as Li Wen approached quickly and solemnly kneeled before him before reporting, "Family Head, the Jade Court Guards have seized control of Mount Yue… Li Jiman has traveled without rest and arrived in the town."

Li Yuanping hummed in response, stroking his chin in silent contemplation. Li Wen got up and stood guard below the platform. Shortly after, a commotion of footsteps heralded the arrival of a man bursting into the hall.

This man, with a slightly tanned complexion, clutched the hem of his lavish robe. He stepped forward and fell to his knees abruptly.

"Family Head, the Tian Family harbors great ambitions—they aim to monopolize Mount Yue and use it as their stronghold. If we yield it to them, I fear it could lead to significant troubles!" the man lamented.

"Jiman..?"

Li Yuanping frowned slightly and continued with displeasure in his voice, "The Tian Family are close relatives and loyal to the core... How can you say such a thing?!"

He looked slightly upset and pushed over the small pile of wooden slips on his desk. They fell on the ground with a loud clatter, tumbling right down in front of Li Jiman.

"The evidence of crimes committed by those on Mount Yue is here—witnesses and exhibits for each charge! What do you have to say about this then?" he asked coldly.

These incriminating pieces, diligently collected by the Clan Affairs Courtyard, were undeniable, but they were submitted in the name of the Tian Family. Although Li Jiman did not know this, he was aware of these prominent families' nature and did not dare examine the documents.

"Family Head! Although the Mount Yue tribes are violent and tyrannical, they serve as a crucial counterbalance to the Tian Family. If eradicated, the Tian Family will dominate, and the Mount Yue State will be at their mercy…. They could also breed disaster!" he pleaded.

"I've studied history! The Jiang Family of Moongaze Lake once depended on external families, which eventually led to their division into various factions and was overtaken by the Yu Family! This is a very important lesson to learn from..." he continued.

Li Yuanping looked at him silently, a little swayed.

"What do you suggest we do?" he asked.

"Family Head... please recall the Tian Family!" Li Jiman said in an outburst as he remained kneeling, his face flushed with urgency.

Li Yuanping let out a soft sigh, scanned the room, and commanded the two rows of guards, "You're all dismissed!"

As the room cleared in an orderly fashion, Li Yuanping let out another long sigh. He quickly descended the platform, helped Li Jiman to his feet, and spoke warmly.

"Jiman, what are you doing? You are a member of my Li Family; the Tian Family cannot compare to us!"

For a moment, Li Jiman was too stunned to respond, but then he heard Li Yuanping continue, "I'm aware that the Tian Family has deep roots in Mount Yue, and is restricting your freedom to act."

"But the tribes of Mount Yue are tyrannical, greedy, and vicious. If we don't remove them, how can Mount Yue ever fall into your hands?" he asked.

Li Jiman's expression was frozen for a long while before it finally gave way to a spark of realization.

"I see… I was far too incompetent to understand Family Head's foresight!" he exclaimed.

Li Yuanping sighed and took his hand, leading him up to the platform while speaking earnestly.

"The Tian Family, while well-connected within the clan, is innocent of any wrongdoing. If we don't sacrifice the Mount Yue tribes, we have no valid reason to transfer them," he explained.

Li Jiman nodded vigorously, then saw Li Yuanping smile.

"I have already issued the decree to transfer the Tian Family. Once this night passes, the wolves will perish, the tigers will migrate, and Mount Yue will be cleared from top to bottom. The honor of restoring it will be yours!"

Li Jiman was deeply moved, whispering softly and guiltily, "Family Head! You've planned everything for my benefit, yet I scarcely realized... I am truly ashamed!"

Li Yuanping shook his head and said, "I will place part of our family's cultivators under your command. You have studied the art of governance for over a decade. Raise the poor families, redistribute the land, protect the spirit fields, elevate the upper class... I'm sure you don't need further guidance from me, right?"

Confident and excited, Li Jiman quickly replied, "Yes! It's better to put those who are to be punished to good use by having them tend to the fields. Give me some time to train the cultivators. In less than five years, Mount Yue's productivity could increase by more than thirty percent!"

Delighted by Li Jiman's response, Li Yuanping offered a few words of encouragement. Li Jiman expressed his profound gratitude and departed, his head held high—a stark contrast to his earlier subdued arrival.

As he disappeared outside the hall, the smile on Li Yuanping's face slowly faded. Leaning back, he held his forehead with one hand and picked up his brush, lost in deep thought.

"Li Jiman is a clever man. The Tian Family's initiative was too abrupt, and the action to eradicate the other tribes was overly decisive… Sooner or later, he'll suspect me. Better to speak out first, dispel his doubts, and in doing so, also curry favor..." he mumbled to himself.

He gently set the brush aside and coughed a few times before noticing a person approaching. Clad in jade armor, the figure appeared steadfast and honest.

Kneeling on one knee, he reported in a deep voice, "Family Head, of the thirteen Mount Yue clans, two have been eradicated for their crimes. Nine are under custody, and the remaining two have been found innocent."

Li Yuanping nodded, appreciating the fact that the Mount Yue clans still knew how to moderate themselves which allowed two families to survive. He glanced toward the back where large chests and wooden boxes were stored and asked, "How is the harvest?"

Chen Mufeng listed several spirit items before replying, "The total value is thirty-five Spirit Stones, all accounted for here."

Li Yuanping instructed him to dispatch the items, and amidst a bout of coughing, he thought to himself, Once the guest cultivators are escorted to Cloud Crowned Peak, the family's finances will see improvements. The Wanling Blossom might bloom in a few more years, and things might get better."

A gentle, chilly breeze swept through Cloud Crowned Peak Market, causing the pole in front of the door to sway. A black and red flag emblazoned with the character "Li" fluttered conspicuously in the wind.

The dark threshold was marred by more than a dozen footprints, lending it a distinctly worn appearance. A middle-aged man, slouched over, sat silently on the threshold with his chin in his hand, watching the world pass by.

A cultivator clad in gray paused briefly before him and asked, "Brother Yun, do you still have any pills in stock?"

A few days ago, the Li Family store had released over a dozen bottles of high-quality pills at a reasonable price, attracting a large crowd and selling out in less than a day. As a result, passing cultivators frequently inquired about them.

Li Yuanyun looked up and drawled, "Already sold out long ago."

The man waved his sleeve and walked away, muttering something to himself.

Li Yuanyun knew this person well—a regular Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator at the market.

Since he was not highly skilled, he could not afford to provoke the Li Family. Despite being a mortal, Li Yuanyun still belonged to the main family's lineage, which usually earned him some respect. As a result, he was bold enough to show his bad mood in the cultivator's presence openly.

After the cultivator left, Li Yuanyun continued to sit on the threshold with a somber expression. Now in his thirties and showing his age, he now appeared even older since the death of his father, Li Xuanling.

"A direct descendant, yet relegated to such menial tasks..." he muttered bitterly.

Li Yuanyun once held a great appreciation for the clan rules that governed his fellow clan members. Now that these rules were directly applied to him, he no longer felt the same way about them. He sat silently, staring at the passersby, feeling utterly at a loss.

After a while, a black-robed cultivator stopped in front of him, causing the wind chimes at the door to tinkle softly. Recognizing the signs of a Qi Cultivator, Li Yuanyun quickly straightened up and respectfully invited the man, "Senior, please come inside!"

"Hm." the cultivator grunted hoarsely. His bamboo hat obscured his face and his voice was deep and raw.

Li Yuanyun could not help but look up, but at the cultivator's dismissive snort, he quickly lowered his head again and followed him inside. From a corner, Li Qiuyang hastily looked up and greeted the visitor with a respectful smile, "Senior seems unfamiliar... May I ask what brings you here today?"

When Li Yuanyun heard the tone in Li Qiuyang's voice, he could tell that the man was likely at the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, perhaps even at the peak. Li Yuanyun stepped backward discreetly.

The black-robed cultivator nodded slowly, his gaze fixed on Yuanyun for a moment before surveying the room, appraising the merchandise. He was dressed in an unusual attire, his face obscured by a black veil.

"Take a look at this."

With a flick of his fingers, he sent a dark jade pearl flying toward Li Qiuyang, who caught it and inspected it closely.

The pearl was about the size of a fist. As Li Qiuyang held it, a slight tingling sensation passed through his hand. The object was rather heavy and opaque, revealing nothing of its contents.

Li Qiuyang scrutinized the pearl for a bit but could discern no details. He extended his spiritual sense, probing the object briefly, then expressed his confusion.

"Senior, this is my first time seeing such a rare pearl. Our store doesn't usually accept spirit items though, and I hope you will forgive my ignorance... But is this a spirit item of the Qi Cultivation Realm?"

"Hahaha!" the black-robed cultivator laughed harshly, smacking his sword on the counter with a resonant clang that startled both Li Qiuyang and Li Yuanyun.

His voice raspy, he chided, "To run a family store with such a lack of knowledge about spirit items! Is this the standard of the Lijing's Li Family? Ridiculous!"

Qiuyang's expression darkened, anger flaring within him.

Looks like this guy is here to make trouble!

Despite knowing that the man came with ill intentions, he restrained himself and replied calmly, "Please, give me a moment, Senior. I'll consult the owner... He's very knowledgeable and will surely be able to identify this item."

With a respectful gesture, he handed the pearl back to the man.

The black-robed figure calmly put away the item before dismissing Li Qiuyang with a wave, arrogantly saying, "Get out of my sight."

Biting back his frustration, Qiuyang departed. The black-robed cultivator continued to eye the various leather and spirit items displayed around the shop, his murmurs filling the air.

Li Yuanyun cowered in a dark corner and watched silently, too fearful to speak.

Shortly after, Li Xuanxuan quickly descended from upstairs with a smile and said, "Forgive me for the lack of welcome! I am Li Xuanxuan, the owner of this modest establishment."

The cultivator glanced at him and placed the mysterious pearl on the counter, asking curtly, "Do you know what this is?"

Li Xuanxuan hurriedly took the jade pearl and carefully studied it. A sense of familiarity washed over him as if the memory was sparking within him.

"The size of a fist, a tingling sensation upon touch, heavy and black, devoid of light or color. I think I've read about this object before..." he murmured.

As he searched his memory, a shock ran through him like an electric jolt. His heart pounded as realization struck him.

"So this is the item..." he muttered quietly through gritted teeth.

This jade pearl had haunted Li Xuanxuan's dreams countless times, as vivid as if he had read its description repeatedly. In his dreams, he had tried to stop Li Pingyi time and again, only to wake up in agony, his grip crushing the edge of the bed...

Despite its harmless appearance, this object had claimed the life of his most cherished eldest son and plunged him into a life-long despair. Although he had never seen it before, he was able to recognize it right away.

"Hey, you!"

The raspy voice of the black-robed cultivator jolted him back to reality.

Covered in a cold sweat, Li Xuanxuan realized he had been standing frozen to the spot, a chill spreading through his body as he regained his senses.

He wiped his face with his sleeve, suppressing the urge to smash the pearl. With a forced smile, he gently placed it on the counter.

The cultivator found his reaction quite suspicious. He peered at Li Xuanxuan intently from beneath his bamboo hat, his gaze piercing as he repeated his question.

"So... do you know what this is?"

Li Xuanxuan straightened up, hesitating to speak as thoughts raced through his mind.

Why is this person here...? He seems to know what it is... What's going on?

What is the meaning of this? Who would dare to cause trouble in the Xiao Family's market?

He exhaled slowly before replying in a calm voice, "Truth be told, I don't recognize it..."

"Hmph!"

The cultivator smacked the counter and was about to react harshly, but paused when he saw Li Xuanxuan hesitate and open to speak once again.

"But..." Li Xuanxuan began.

"But what?!"

The tension was palpable as the cultivator's voice grew strained, his impatience clear.

"If I am not mistaken, this pearl holds a mysterious technique that could unleash both thunder and fire. It's likely an extremely powerful object."

"Oh?"

The black-robed cultivator appeared slightly surprised, pausing for a breath before his voice deepened with interest.

"You have keen eyesight..."

Adjusting the edge of his bamboo hat, he watched Li Xuanxuan with an amused expression.

Li Xuanxuan, noticing the small gesture, felt a growing sense of alarm and said in a low voice, "Of course, my family possesses a unique secret technique! Mastering this skill would allow one to discern spirit items easily."

"Tell me more."

The black-robed cultivator's eyes glinted with a hint of greed as he stared at Li Xuanxuan, who quickly responded, "Just a moment, Senior!"

He moved to close the door properly before quickly peering outside. As he expected, several nearby shops were embroiled in heated arguments with cultivators inside—each one at the late stage of Qi Cultivation. The confrontations had escalated, already turning physical, with two individuals vandalizing a nearby store.

With a chill in his heart but a smile on his face, he turned back to find the black-robed cultivator staring at him intently.

Li Xuanxuan hurriedly whispered, "Senior, you may not be aware, but my family has a superior perception technique known as Spirit Eye Perception. I would be willing to impart it to you discreetly for a fair price."

"I see!"

The black-robed cultivator was delighted. He knew that such a secret technique was hard to come by as they were usually only memorized within the family. He thought to himself, No matter the cost, I must acquire this technique first before I deal with these people... With only an unrefined Qi cultivator and an early-stage Qi Cultivator, they're as good as dead.
