# Chapter 960: Qi's Light

Li Zhouwei smiled and replied, "It should be."

He immediately added with a touch of regret, "It's just a pity that these past days... I've been racing against time, either in reclusive cultivation or practicing spell arts. I haven't been able to constantly monitor the situation, so I don't know which instances earned them!"

Li Ximing nodded inwardly and soon smiled. "That's fine. Just pay more attention next time. There's no urgent need for it right now. As long as we can secure them, that's all that matters!"

Li Zhouwei nodded and continued, "This junior was overjoyed at the time. I went to the highest meditation cushion in the High Firmament Pavilion and performed the 'Immortal Ascension Art' ritual. I wrote down a writ requesting the Emperor Qi's Light and cast it into the bronze censer. I haven't received any news yet."

"Good, good, good!"

Li Ximing knew he would have arranged it properly and smiled. "It's all thanks to you... I'm always alone at home, and I can't be everywhere at once. Between alchemy and cultivation, it's inevitable that I overlook things."

He glanced at Li Zhouwei and lowered his voice. "But I have one more thing to ask... You received the Illuminating Sun and Moon. After these past few sessions of Dharma combat, has it benefited your Dao-Profundity?"

Li Zhouwei pondered for a moment. "Those Dharma combats were fierce, but they weren't a threat to my life-mandate, and I didn't suffer any real injuries. It wasn't entirely satisfying. However, I did receive a measure of feedback to my Dao-Profundity... As for how it helped... I couldn't tell at the time."

He simply sat down, his thoughts clear. "But now, having witnessed so many divine abilities, I've come to a new understanding of this Dao-Profundity. The other day, when I returned with Daoist Master Yushui, he was grateful for my generous help and also had his eye on the Neck Feathers. We chatted a bit, and I seized the opportunity to ask him about it, both to gather intelligence and to establish some classifications."

Chen Yin's strength is considerable, and his ancestors had connections to the Golden Feather, so he is quite knowledgeable. Li Ximing listened intently as he spoke:

"When it comes to Dao-Profundity, everyone in Jiangnan speaks of the 'Two Purples.' Daoist Master Zimu, Wen Qingzhou, is even called the first. But from this junior's perspective... there is one other—if he can even be called a person."

Li Ximing was thoughtful. "Suiguan?"

"Exactly!"

Li Zhouwei's expression turned serious. "Although Dao-Profundity doesn't necessarily increase with age, with enough time, it will gradually be polished to a higher level. What's more, he is intrinsically linked to a True Monarch... That is the terrifying part."

"In terms of Dao-Profundity, Suiguan and Dongfang Heyun are likely first beneath the True Monarchs. Their status is a result of their fundamental nature, something ordinary people cannot touch, so let's not discuss them."

"Below those two is Daoist Master Zimu. Although I have not seen this Daoist Master personally, it's said that Zimu's Dao-Profundity is a cut above Zipei's. He is famous for it, a true standout among those who have perfected their divine abilities."

A trace of amazement entered his expression. "Daoist Master Chen holds him in high esteem and said only this of him: 'To reach this point in cultivation is to reach the pinnacle'!"

Li Ximing sighed. "I've long heard of him!"

Li Zhouwei actually still remembered that Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia, but he didn't know their name and couldn't say much, so he didn't mention it. He placed that individual and Zimu above Zipei, then continued,

"Daoist Master Zipei wasn't skilled in Dharma combat, but her Dao-Profundity was renowned. Chunyi Dao Gate once had another with high Dao-Profundity, Daoist Master Yuanshang, and Mount Changhuai had the fallen Great Daoist Master Qing. They can be considered the first tier—the peak a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator can hope to achieve in a lifetime."

Li Ximing was astonished. "Daoist Master Zipei is ranked that far down... Ninety-nine percent of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the world should be ashamed!"

Li Zhouwei shook his head. "That's already extremely good. Below them are Great Daoist Masters who have either received a precious Dao Lineage or whose own lineage is inherently world-renowned and 'radiant', making it easy to elevate their Dao-Profundity, like Changxiao or Chi Buzi. Or, mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who have received some inheritance from a Golden Core, like Daoist Master Pu Yu of Penglai. This is the second tier. They have already trained their Dao-Profundity and spell arts to an extremely profound level."

"The third tier consists of ordinary Great Daoist Masters and some mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators whose Dao-Profundity surpasses their peers, like Chi Wei, or Daoist Master Fuxuan of the Chunyi Dao Gate..."

"The next tier down includes Great Daoist Masters whose divine abilities are innately deficient or restricted, and mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who have worked hard on their Dao-Profundity, like Helian Wujiang... As for which Great Daoist Master, he couldn't speak presumptuously, but he implied it to me."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. It wasn't often he got to hear gossip, and he focused intently. Li Zhouwei lowered his voice. "Chen Yin claimed... that among the 'Twelve Qis,' the Dawn Qi and the Cold Qi correspond to each other. It seems that in ancient times, they were both subjected to some unimaginable method by an Immortal Lord. They were forced to submit, making them easier to cultivate, but from then on, their divine abilities were weakened by a fraction, and their Dao-Profundity became very difficult to deepen... When the Wei State collapsed, the Dawn Qi was liberated and is no longer afflicted, leaving only the Cold Qi."

Though he didn't state the name, the implication was blindingly obvious.

"Tianwan of Crimson Reef Island!"

Li Ximing didn't cultivate Cold Qi himself, so he just listened for amusement and let it pass with a smile. Li Zhouwei continued, "The fifth tier below that can be called 'Entering the Hall.' There's finally a decent number of people here. Usually, anyone who has cultivated two or three divine abilities can touch this threshold."

"Heh!"

Li Ximing had always been an optimist. He just poured some tea and laughed.

"And here I was, wondering if I could cross the threshold of 'Entering the Hall.' Turns out I'm still standing at the foot of the mountain."

Li Zhouwei gave a slightly awkward smile. "Granduncle, you've spent the last century working diligently on alchemy... Naturally, you shouldn't be compared to them..."

Li Ximing then began to consider it seriously. "Changxiao is truly formidable. I still remember one of his spell arts vividly... Where do you place yourself?"

Li Zhouwei nodded gravely. "This junior read more spell arts in my early years and benefited greatly from those secret techniques. I estimate that on the path of Dao-Profundity, I can be considered as 'Entering the Hall.'"

"Now, with this bit of progress, I've been gauging myself. If I could gain ten times this amount, I should be able to test my hand against Helian Wujiang."

Li Ximing calculated inwardly and replied with some envy, "That's quite fast! And you still haven't had your fill of fighting."

Li Zhouwei bowed slightly. Li Ximing then left with a smile, riding a beam of light toward the Eastern Sea. Li Zhouwei saw him off, calling out a reminder, "Granduncle, since you're going to Poluoduo, you still need to ask Demon King Qingyan about the spiritual materials. He cultivates Azure Proclaimation. Do you remember that Nine Dams of the Azure Ram Mountain technique we have at home? Its grade is extremely high, and the requirements are strict. It's not suitable for us to cultivate, but it can be exchanged for a good price."

Li Ximing realized the logic in this. Given Demon King Qingyan's rough-and-tumble appearance, his fighting style was likely just as grand and sweeping; the technique would be perfect for him. He agreed cheerfully.

After seeing him off, Li Zhouwei returned to the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda, communed with his Talisman Seed, and advanced his Daoist cultivation.

Time flows differently in cultivation. He had been meditating in the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance for a long time when he finally sensed a warmth from the jade pendant at his waist. He let out a long breath and stood up. He did not leave in a hurry, but instead strode through the overlapping layers of clouds to the High Firmament Pavilion.

The stone platform was exceptionally bright under the glow. On the purple-black wooden slips, pale golden characters appeared one by one:

"Observing the Primal Honored Seat, one becomes Emperor. His light spreads to the corners of the sea, and all look upon his majesty. Yet, like the sun moving through the world, he resides in the second-most-prominent position, which thus forms the foundation of this art... The Emperor said: When the Honored One enters the hall as the host, divine radiance fills the chamber; this is High Radiance. When the guest enters the hall, 'Qi's Light' scatters; this is the Yang Cusp. Thus, Emperor Qi's Light was formed! Its Dao is immense..."

This spell art would be given to Li Ximing to cultivate in the future. He read all the golden characters, quickly gathering them into a golden slip in his hand. He annotated it as he comprehended its meaning, then turned lightly and landed back in the thunder-wreathed pagoda.

'So it's a Yang Cusp art of the inverted Bright Yang...'

'Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light is known as 'The Monarch treads into danger, thus there is concealment.' It has a corresponding flavor. They truly do complement each other...'

He appeared on Gardenia Scenery Mountain and sat down among the drifting gardenia blossoms. After reading the doctrinal exposition, he examined the more critical technique manual:

"Within the Juque Palace, conceal Baleful Fire Qi. Condense light and electricity, transforming them into a chamber. Enter as the 'guest' with various divine abilities to create the omen of 'Qi's Light.' It is best to use a Bright Yang spiritual item to assist the 'guest's' cultivation."

Li Zhouwei did not have a Bright Yang spiritual item, but he did have a Supreme Yang spiritual item. The symbolic imagery of this spell art was too strong; it couldn't be a simple substitute. But he estimated inwardly:

'Concealed Plunder Gold does more than just strengthen spiritual light. When my Dao-Profundity deepens, I should be able to have Concealed Plunder Gold transform into the 'host' of the chamber. The Supreme Yang-rank position will be a seamless fit, absolutely perfect... At that time, not only will its power ceiling far exceed Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, it will probably even jump beyond the fifth grade!'

He looked at it carefully, a quiet joy rising in him. With a light wave of his hand, he summoned an item from the Purple Baleful Bright Yang Spring on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. It was the Profound Pattern Vase.

"It needs Baleful Fire Qi, and condensed light and electricity... The Profound Pattern Vase has been refining in this fire vein for decades. There is no Baleful Fire Qi more pure than this!"

As for light and electricity, lightning was extremely rare in Jiangnan, and it should have taken some time to gather. But while other families had little, the Li family had plenty! Li Qinghong had been diligent back in her day, busy her entire life. Using the convenience of her cultivation art, she had stored more than a dozen lightning bolts at home, refusing to use even one... Such a quantity of lightning would take even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator some time to gather.

'The legacy of our predecessors cannot be used without being replenished. Zhouda has also achieved his Immortal Foundation; I should tell him to start using the ritual platform...'

Just as Li Zhouwei finished arranging these matters, he saw Li Que'wan approaching from the mountain path, looking slightly uneasy. "Reporting to the Daoist Master... something has happened to the Yuan family!"

"What?"

Li Zhouwei looked up in surprise. Li Que'wan reported respectfully, "Yuan Chengzhao has been missing for many years, and the Yuan family has been managed by Yuan Zibin. This man is tyrannical and excessive, whipping his elders and subverting clan law. He is also vicious, having purged the clan several times. No one in the Yuan family dared to control him, which has led to today's situation."

"But news just came from the Mushroom Forest Plains. Yuan Zibin was out enjoying himself on the plains when he was killed by a cultivator. Many others were killed with him. The Yuan clan is in chaos, and their clan structure has completely collapsed."

Li Zhouwei frowned immediately. Li Que'wan continued, "But this cultivator didn't leave... He fought his way into the Yuan family estate, opened their treasury, and took everything out. He then distributed it all to the various small families and clans across the entire Mushroom Forest Plains..."

The Yuan family had ancient origins. Although they hadn't produced a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in many years, they had never truly declined. They had governed the Mushroom Forest Plains for almost as long as the Azure Pond Sect had existed. Their methods were harsh; even the Embyronic Breathing cultivation arts they distributed were divided into six parts based on the six wheels... This new development would likely make those small clans weep with gratitude.

Li Zhouwei mused, "The Yuan family... has seldom cultivated Azure Proclaimation in recent years, haven't they."

As soon as he said this, Li Que'wan understood. She nodded. "Exactly. This junior specifically checked. For the past several decades, the Yuan clan... has preferred cultivating the Mansion Water and Pit Water paths."

"No wonder."

Li Zhouwei asked, "So, which member of the Yuan family did this cultivator prop up?"

Li Que'wan knew exactly what he was implying. "The Daoist Master is wise. Although there aren't many Yuan clan members left, this cultivator still supported a member of the main lineage. He returned the clan to him, instructing him to rebuild the clan structure, return to the ancestral Dao, and restore the name of Azure Proclaimation. However, they are no longer the masters of the Mushroom Forest Plains, but are instead settled in a prefecture on the plains."

Li Que'wan's gaze was complicated. "This junior believes... it's likely that when the Yuan family's old ancestor failed to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, it exposed the clan's intention to find its own path. That's what led to Yuan Zibin, and what led to today."

Li Zhouwei nodded, but his focus was elsewhere, his expression slowly turning strange.

"You're saying the Yuan clan is no longer master of the Mushroom Forest Plains. That means... this person has brazenly... taken the Mushroom Forest Plains, which belongs to the Azure Pond Sect... for himself!"

No matter how you looked at it, the Mushroom Forest Plains was Azure Pond territory. The Yuan clan, regardless of their actions, was still an Azure Pond family. To put it bluntly, they were all private property of the Azure Pond Sect. If this person had acted as a vigilante and left after settling matters, the Azure Pond Sect, being too preoccupied to manage its own affairs, would have had a hard time dealing with him. But this... this had a completely different meaning!

Li Que'wan lowered her head. "Exactly! And currently, there has been no reaction from the mountain."

Li Zhouwei's gaze sharpened. "Does this cultivator have a name?"

The woman before him showed a bitter expression. "His surname is Yang, name Zhuo. He is at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm."

...

The Great Void was pitch black, a bright light streaking through it. A scholar in white robes stood with a broad smile, his face filled with gratitude.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing... if there's anything you need my help with in the future, please just say the word! If nothing else, I have my Auspicious Qi divine ability, which can be useful in many situations!"

The Daoist in pale gold robes repeatedly agreed. The scholar escorted him a long way before finally turning back, leaving the bright light to continue its journey east.

'He's a little too enthusiastic now...'

Li Ximing had just returned from the Xipo Kingdom. Fuxun had only reluctantly departed after escorting him far out over the sea.

After all, that great pill had solved the Demon King's most pressing problem. The Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill was also of excellent quality. Fuxun's desire to befriend him was practically spilling from his face. The last time, it was Qingyan and the others who had delivered it, so they hadn't met. This time, the Demon King had finally caught him.

Li Ximing had passed on the request to search for spiritual materials, but his main purpose was to ask Qingyan about the spell art. He stayed for several extra months and finally got to meet with Qingyan.

The Demon King himself was skilled in blessings and had quite the savings. He was decisive. After just one look at the spell art's outline, he agreed enthusiastically and even offered to trade spiritual materials of the Mansion Water path for it.

But Li Ximing had absolutely no lack of Mansion Water materials right now and was also incredibly busy. He politely stated his own needs and asked the other to acquire those items first, then took his leave.

'Nine Dams of the Azure Ram Mountain is a fifth-grade technique, after all, and Azure Proclaimation arts are rare. It's not often you see that fellow so eager. In that case, my family is in no hurry.'

Li Ximing hadn't expected him to be so generous as to offer spiritual materials. He was in high spirits as he left Poluoduo, crossed the Piaoren Kingdom, and headed north.

While he was a guest in Poluoduo, the token he had given to Dingyang Zi began to warm faintly. The artisan-refiner was contacting him as promised.

News about the Heavenly Star Crimson Gold had already been sent once, so there was no need to use a jade talisman again. This almost certainly meant the old man had finally found another buyer.

Li Ximing immediately grew concerned. He had originally planned to cross the Southern Borderlands, pass through the Shu lands to check on the influence of Sword Gate and Xiukui in the Long and Shu regions, and then head south to Qize to finalize the matter. But the further he flew, the more wrong things felt. By the time he was halfway, his expression had changed completely.

Looking out over the entire Wu State, the land below was covered in the light of fires. Dense pinpricks of light spread across nearly every prefecture city beneath his feet. Cultivators were flying up everywhere, battling in mid-air. Severed limbs rained down from time to time, along with various spiritual items, sparking mad scrambles below!

Mortals battled in the prefectures while cultivators engaged in Dharma combat. The four borders were rotting. The lands of several prefectures before him, Mount Changhuai's unchanging backyard for hundreds of years, had become a scene of carnage!

"What has happened to Mount Changhuai?!"
