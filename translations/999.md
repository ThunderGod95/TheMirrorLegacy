# Chapter 999: Crossing the River

Milin Prefecture.

Li Suining emerged from his chamber. He waited a moment, then saw a man with ordinary features descend on the wind, flanked by two others. They seemed to be discussing something, and he could faintly catch a few fragments:

"The Pu family has produced a genius. Has the Dharma Protector heard...?"

"Indeed... already in the mountains. I saw him some time ago..."

Li Suining waited quietly by the palace. When the three of them reached the hall entrance, the man in the center glanced at him. His brow furrowed, but he quickly recognized the youth, stopping in his tracks and turning around.

"Suining?"

Li Suining bowed immediately. "This junior greets you, Elder Uncle!"

The man before him was Li Zhoufang, the eldest of the Li family's Zhou generation. He was gradually emerging from the shadow of his uncles' and brothers' deaths and had now become an elder himself. Stroking his beard, he stared at Li Suining, genuinely perplexed.

"Is that really you, Suining? You've truly changed..."

Li Suining's heart tightened.

'This Elder Uncle wasn't highly regarded by the senior-most elders. In his early years, he and Second Uncle Li Zhouyang were busy handling affairs in the shadows. After Li Zhouyang fell, Elder Uncle Li Zhoufang remained a pillar of support for the various disciples. He is extremely popular among the juniors on the island... and behind him, naturally, is the Old Master, Li Xuanxuan.'

'Because of this, Li Zhoufang remembered every single child. He had definitely met me before!'

Now that Li Suining's demeanor was so different, Li Zhoufang was naturally astonished. However, the middle-aged man's heart was filled with affection. He immediately dismissed his two subordinates and laughed.

"You're grown up! Completely different from before!"

Li Suining smiled and said respectfully, "I have reached the fifth level of Embyronic Breathing and came to pay my respects to you immediately, my lord."

"I heard! You've brought honor to the Eastern Residence! The Daoist Master values you; you must not disappoint him!"

Li Zhoufang shooed the two men away and eagerly pulled him into the courtyard. After some cheerful small talk about recent events, he quickly got to the point.

"So, what is it?"

Li Zhoufang had helped many clansmen and always knew that when the younger generation sought him out, they needed something. He didn't mind and asked directly.

Li Suining's eyes reddened. He lowered his voice. "It is about my father... He perished in the Wilderness incident. I have always kept it in my heart, but I do not know the culprit... Before my mother passed, she mentioned that Guest Retainer Ding and the Third Young Master gave him much support. I came today, first, to see you, my lord, and second... to ask about the culprit... I harbor thoughts of revenge."

Li Zhoufang froze. His face flushed, and his eyes immediately grew moist.

His own blood brothers had fallen in the Wilderness. The incident had even sent him into a spiral of depression. How could he not feel sorrow and anger hearing this?!

Li Suining's words had struck his deepest pain. He stood up abruptly and paced back and forth in the room twice, his eyes closed and brows furrowed. He sighed.

"Good child!"

Those two words made Li Suining lower his head, a pang of guilt stirring within him for using the man's grief.

Truthfully, the turmoil in the Wilderness was almost insignificant among the Li family's greater vendettas. The senior elders barely paid it any mind. Even for Li Suining, who had lost his father... first, it was impossible to find the specific culprit amidst the chaos, and second, he had never even met his father and had more important, urgent matters to attend to. He wasn't obsessed with it...

But for Li Zhoufang, whose brothers and nephews had all died in the recent conflicts, it was a raw, bloody hatred!

Seeing that he was the only one in the entire Li family who seemed to care, this Elder Uncle surely felt bitter, even if he never spoke of it. Hearing Li Suining's words now, he was deeply moved.

He turned his head, his voice heavy.

"My cultivation isn't high, but thankfully I've earned some merit over the years and co-managed the Wilderness with Guest Retainer Ding. I will absolutely summon him for you! I will help you get answers!"

Li Suining's heart eased. He knew the matter was settled.

He had sought out Li Zhoufang for two reasons. First, this uncle would definitely help him. Second, and more importantly, was Li Zhoufang's status.

'It's not that I couldn't see Ding Weizeng. But given my cultivation level and the people I have access to, even if I could, it would nine times out of ten be by going to the Wilderness front lines to request an audience. That would have the completely opposite meaning. I wouldn't be able to save anyone and would end up trapping myself instead.'

'But Elder Uncle, despite his low cultivation, is the eldest son of the direct line of the Yuandu generation and the eldest son of the Zhou generation. He also presides over the Wilderness's political affairs. Both his position and his status give him the standing to summon Guest Retainer Ding!'

'Even if Li Zhoufang really could drop everything and fly to the Wilderness front, I had a way to convince him otherwise. After all, many from the direct lineage perished in the Wilderness. Li Zhoufang is only at the Qi Refining level; the riverbank is not a safe place.'

Now that the matter was arranged, he offered a sincere thanks. Li Zhoufang just waved his hand, dismissed an attendant, and whispered:

"Guest Retainer Ding is an upright man. This matter has a whiff of currying favor, so we can't say I'm summoning him just for you. Remember: I have official business to discuss with him, and your matter just happens to coincide..."

Li Zhoufang had managed affairs by the lake for many years; he naturally knew how to handle things. Li Suining wasn't slow-witted either and nodded in understanding. But then the middle-aged man sighed.

"Times by the lake are probably difficult. They don't know how to live properly. Don't hold it against them, and get along well with Suikuan..."

"Yes!"

Li Suining had expected him to say something like this.

'This was the difference between Li Zhoufang and Li Xuanxuan. No matter how worthless his descendants or brothers were, Li Zhoufang always had a soft spot, thinking, _"He is my kinsman, after all."_ But the Old Master would truly curse and beat them. For the same offense in my past life, when the Old Master got the full story, he didn't just try to smooth things over by telling me "don't hold it against them."'

'But Li Zhoufang had always been this way. He had been taught by Li Chengjiao to be utterly selfless. No matter how soft-hearted he was, he was still far better than that beast who defected to the Buddhists!'

At this thought, Li Suining's breathing quickened, a trembling anger rising from deep within him.

'Li Chengpan...'

He was extremely wary. Buddhist cultivators had a keen karmic sense. Even though the other party's cultivation should be low right now, he quickly suppressed the thought. He waited anxiously, his mind inevitably wandering.

'It's almost noon... This shouldn't be...'

With the experience of his past life, Li Suining knew that countless mighty figures were watching Moongaze Lake like tigers. He didn't dare act out of line or speak his thoughts aloud. He could only do his best within his capabilities. He felt agitated, distractedly acknowledging his uncle's words, when he suddenly heard a sound.

"Om!"

A flash of crimson-gold light descended from the sky, and a man materialized inside the pavilion.

The man had a noble, martial appearance, with eyes as sharp as blades. He unconsciously radiated a killing aura, a blatant, deadly prestige. He wore a dazzling red armor, and two short clubs were fastened at his waist, faintly pulsing with artifact light.

Merely by standing there without a word, he projected the fierce, imposing bearing of a great general. He glanced down, his voice gruff and low.

"Young Master, you were looking for me?"

Li Zhoufang smiled. "Indeed! Apologies for troubling you to make this trip, Guest Retainer!"

'This is the Palace-Yang Tiger!'

Li Suining's heart pounded, a mix of joy and shock. He desperately suppressed his overflowing delight.

'I really... I really made it in time!'

He had never met Ding Weizeng in his past life. After all, Ding Weizeng had been burned to death by the Merging Fire while Li Suining was still in Embyronic Breathing. He had only heard that the family once had this Palace-Yang Tiger... a highly capable subordinate of the Daoist Master, and his loss was a great regret.

Now, seeing him with his own eyes, he was filled with boundless elation.

'He truly is a fierce general... and I really saved him!'

His euphoria was indescribable. His passionate desire to change his past life had always been shadowed by a lingering fear that fate was immutable. Now that it had truly happened, he had confirmed his ability to change the future. It almost felt like a dream.

This boiling, complex joy was impossible for others to understand. Li Suining just kept his head down, feeling the wave of heat from the artifact light washing over him. His heart burned, and a lump formed in his throat.

'Guest Retainer Ding is the first, but he absolutely will not be the last!'

Ding Weizeng, however, turned those blade-like eyes on him, a hint of suspicion in his gaze.

The 'Palace-Yang Tiger' Dao foundation involved striking opponents with one's gaze; it was a Dao Lineage with profound attainments in ocular techniques. The pressure from his stare was immense. Seeing the youth bow his head was no surprise. He asked, "Is this about the families on the east bank?"

Li Zhoufang began to explain the details. Li Suining, however, kept his head lowered, his gaze drifting to the afternoon sun outside the window, counting down the seconds.

'Three... two... one...'

As he finished the mental countdown, his tension peaked. A breeze swept in. Ding Weizeng looked up abruptly, his expression fierce, and stared at the horizon. In that instant, a terrifying wave of Merging Fire erupted from the north, engulfing the world. The entire sky turned a sickly, ashen black!

"Not good!"

The man didn't hesitate for a second. Ignoring Li Zhoufang's shocked and bewildered expression, he stood up, his body flaring with crimson light, and transformed into a streak of light, rocketing into the sky.

'He dodged the initial Merging Fire and the ambush... He's probably just going to take a look. He should be safe...'

Li Suining also stood, forcing himself not to chase after him. His face showed shock, but his eyes held hope as he slowly raised his head.

Over the lake to the west, a blazing Heavenly Light was rising, stirring the rolling, multicolored clouds and rapidly pushing back the sky's ashen-black. A dull, majestic pressure spread rapidly.

'The Daoist Master is making his move!'

...

"Moongaze Lake..."

Karmic fire surged through the sky, swirling like black fog. Numerous golden bodies materialized, casting multicolored light across the heavens.

The horse-headed, dark-eyed Maha stood in the air, its lotus throne gleaming. The golden body looked up toward the nearby lake, and a Buddhist hymn echoed:

"Nuxiao!"

The nun at his side rose and bowed respectfully. She saw Taixi say placidly:

"Go and test the waters."

'Damn you, why don't you go yourself? You want me to fight the White Qilin?'

The nun rose with a smile, her face a mask of serene peace. Her delicate features shone like porcelain. Though she was cursing him furiously in her heart, she could not defy the order. She cautiously rode the wind forward.

Nuxiao was truly unlucky. She possessed some karmic affinity and was the Merciful One of the Sparrow Carp Fish, making her a strong contender to be his disciple. Her status was not low. Despite several failures, she had relied on this connection to remain secure.

She had recommended Antelope Trample, thinking to earn some merit. But Antelope Trample had crushed all rivals and won the Sparrow Carp Fish's favor, rendering her own value obsolete. Her previous failures suddenly became glaring. Unsurprisingly, with Taixi short on manpower, she was immediately dispatched.

She wasn't even part of his faction; how could she get a good assignment? It was only because Taixi wasn't her direct superior and didn't control her fate that she dared to curse him internally. But cursing was all she could do... She had no power to resist and flew forward, trembling with fear.

She had just crossed the river when she saw an intricate, bright-white Celestial Gate erect itself from the multicolored clouds, shining down countless beams of Heavenly Light. She was so frightened she immediately recoiled. But then she saw a man in white-gold robes sitting atop the Celestial Gate, and she froze.

It was Li Ximing!

"Hah!"

Her back immediately straightened, her brows relaxed, and she revealed a newfound ease. She smiled.

"So, it was Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

How could she, Nuxiao, not know Li Ximing's true strength? They had just crossed blows years ago when vying for Bai Yinzi. Li Ximing was indeed skilled at suppressing a Merciful One, and his Radiant Sun King's Halberd was formidable. But she hadn't come alone!

'Moreover... when the Radiant Sun King's Halberd sees the White Qilin, will it even obey him? The White Qilin is tyrannical; it never spits out what it swallows. Would it have left him with the Pure Yang Bracelets?'

It wasn't just Nuxiao who felt confident. The other Merciful Ones behind her also let out silent sighs of relief. Even Taixi, whose eyes had been clouded with uncertainty, grinned. But the old fox was still cautious.

'Li Ximing is nothing, but the White Qilin is most likely still on the lake. The Lord took his forces to the Wilderness. If the White Qilin hits me with those bracelets and I get injured, it's not worth it... Shilou Yingge used an injury as an excuse to return... but from his report, those Pure Yang Bracelets are still potent.'

Li Ximing just stared at them coldly, a scalding fury boiling inside him.

'Good... attacking the lake without a single word... If I hadn't delayed my departure for the West Curtain Sea, Zhouwei would probably be the only one guarding the lake!'

These few were already trouble, and there were even more powerful auras in the Wilderness. The peace between north and south had been torn apart like paper. The north's first move was a killing gambit, an overwhelming disparity in force. A mix of lingering fear and rage twisted inside him, making his gaze even colder.

He didn't relax in the slightest. The Heavenly Light at his brow flashed, and a perfectly round, crimson-red pearl, like a Golden Core, materialized before his forehead. It was encircled by five golden threads, and fiery birds circled it, emitting a misty, multicolored light.

The Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument!

A torrential wave of Li-Light surged from it. Dazzling and chaotic, the crimson light, trailing intersecting, multicolored rays, instantly drowned the sky, pulling all three Merciful Ones and the one Maha into its domain!

The chaotic Li-Light shot everywhere, shattering all spiritual sense in an instant and pinning Nuxiao, who had been in the lead. But then, radiance burst forth from within, as if carving out a new Buddhist Land. A solemn Sanskrit voice boomed:

"Vile heretics! A parlor trick!"

Taixi's figure had vanished from the lotus seat. A thick golden light enveloped him, the glorious radiance driving back the chaotic colors, revealing the Maha's golden body. His eyes flashed, having already locked onto Li Ximing's position!

But the Daoist Master in white-gold robes showed no sign of retreat. He stood silently, his eyes slightly closed, hands pressed together at his chest. Three blazing lights flashed into existence beside him.

On his left, an apricot-red Radiant Fire burned brightly, flowing and surging, containing a balanced and profound qi. On his right, a True Fire—white within, golden without, etched with red and black patterns—blazed, unleashing the profound mysteries of artifact refinement. Both were Purple Mansion spiritual fires.

But what truly made the Maha's pupils widen was the brilliant, blazing light auras they flanked: a near-invisible, pale gray flame, radiating a terrifying, baleful aura!

'That's... the Merging Fire of the Supreme Yang Dao!'

Incomprehension flooded Taixi's eyes. His mind went blank for an instant.

'Early-stage Purple Mansion Realm? A Purple Mansion cultivator with one divine ability... and _three_ Purple Mansion spiritual fires?'

But the raging flames were already reflected in his eyes. The three spiritual fires, as docile as lambs in the man's control, wove together without interfering with one another. At a terrifying speed, they plummeted down, straight for his face!

PS: Got word today that the film/TV rights have been signed... but it's mostly up to the screenwriters, the author doesn't have much to do with it, so don't worry about it affecting the writing. I've also finished up my other tasks, so I'll be adding extra chapters these next two days—I just don't know what the live-action drama will look like.
