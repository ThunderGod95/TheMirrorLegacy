# Chapter 737: A Claim from the Sword Gate

Li Zhouwei had been ensnared by the Pit-Metal Encircling Chain before. Fortunately, he had managed to suppress it with his immortal foundation in a surprise move, otherwise, he would have been in for a world of trouble.

"This artifact may not have much destructive power, but its ability to restrain is exceptional," he said. "It would be particularly effective against cultivators with potent Dharma Bodies. One or two people might be enough to trap such an expert."

Li Ximing nodded. While these items were of little use to him, they were treasures for a Foundation Establishment cultivator. "Its primary function is binding, which makes it quite useful," he replied. "However, our clan has no cultivators who have reached Foundation Establishment through the Pit Water virtue. The only one even remotely close is Miaoshui."

"Although she contributed greatly in the battle, many others were injured. The Pit-Metal Encircling Chain is a valuable artifact, and to award it so casually would be poor stewardship. Let's store it for now and bring it out when it's needed in a future conflict."

Li Zhouwei put the artifact away and picked up the dark, unassuming Capital immortals Dao Bell. As his spiritual sense swept over it, a hint of surprise crossed his face. "It's imbued with Pure Qi."

Pure Qi was one of the most common Daoist lineages among rogue cultivators, especially in Jiangnan. Eight out of ten of them followed the path of the Lesser Pure Spirit Qi. Most of these cultivators never advanced beyond Embryonic Breathing, and it was common for a single Dharma Artifact to be passed down through three generations. Consequently, there was an abundance of Pure Qi artifacts for those at the Embryonic Breathing stage.

While Pure Qi cultivators were numerous at the lower levels, their numbers dwindled significantly at the Foundation Establishment realm, though they still represented a notable portion. Li Ximing, however, had never even heard of a Purple Mansion Daoist Master from the Pure Qi lineage. Foundation Establishment artifacts of this path were equally scarce, and the few he had seen were crudely made. This was the first time he had encountered one of such high quality.

He turned the black bell over, examining it closely. The materials, the refining techniques, the array patterns etched upon its surface—all were of a contemporary style. Li Ximing frowned. "How strange. Guan Gongxiao, the esteemed young master of the Capital immortals Dao, goes to the trouble of refining and nurturing a Dharma Artifact, yet he chooses to use Pure Qi instead of his own sect's Capital Guard..."

He exchanged a look with Li Zhouwei. "It seems there's some connection between the Capital Guard and Pure Qi. Interesting."

The Pure Qi lineage had no significant strengths or weaknesses against other paths, but this Capital immortals Dao Bell was of a higher grade than the Pit-Metal Encircling Chain, nearly rivaling the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner. Li Ximing let Li Zhouwei keep it for his own use before finally turning his attention to the small mirror.

The mirror was only the size of a palm, with an ancient bronze hue. Its twin-ringed frame was intricately carved with depictions of various beasts in motion. Though it was the most ornate of the three items, its quality was the lowest, and the craftsmanship was not particularly skilled. Li Ximing gave it a glance and said, "A Dharma Artifact, the Bronze-Winged Brightwhite. The frame is made from Virtue-Edict Bronze, and the mirrored surface is White Crane Lapis, a material from the True Qi lineage. The artifact isn't very old. It must have been specially prepared for our family's Profound Light users."

Li Zhouwei had little interest in this item and planned to pass it down to Ding Weizeng, so he tucked it into his sleeve for the time being.

"That old fox Yehui..." Li Ximing finally mused. "I wonder what game he's playing. I should deal with the matter of Shanji Prefecture quickly. Then there's the issue of Xiaoshi Mountain... I ought to pay a visit to the Chengyun Gate."

He mounted his Profound Light and vanished into the Great Void, leaving Li Zhouwei alone in the hall. After a moment of contemplation, Li Wen came to report, his face still pale. He entered the hall and knelt.

"Patriarch, a messenger has come from the Old Master to ask if there has been any progress regarding An Siwei's situation. The Old Master says that Elder An returned to the lake without a word, and we cannot let his heart grow cold."

An Siwei had been captured by the Golden Tang Gate, and that coward Situ Mo was holed up and refusing to show his face. Unless a Purple Mansion Daoist Master personally made the trip, there was little Li Zhouwei could do. He could only send back a message expressing the Daoist Master's concern and dispatched someone with the news.

He stood with his hands behind his back and asked Li Wen, who was still in the hall, "The Old Master asks about this daily. Such frequency... are the letters coming through the Jade Court?"

Li Wen served in the Jade Court and was the most knowledgeable on this matter. "There is no record of it in the Jade Court's logs," he answered. "It must be that the Old Master sent a personal confidant to the East Shore first."

Li Zhouwei's suspicions were confirmed. The East Shore was currently managed by Li Jiangxia, who was Lady An's son. It was this young man's people who were rushing back and forth. He simply tapped his brush on the desk. "He certainly is anxious."

Li Wen bowed his head, pretending not to hear.

"Send a reply through the Jade Court," Li Zhouwei instructed. "Make it clear to the Old Master that the Golden Tang Gate would not dare harm a clan elder, nor would the Golden Feather Sect. Even if he had fallen into the hands of the Capital immortals Dao earlier, he might have suffered a bit, but his life would not have been in danger."

"What is a monumental crisis for a Foundation Establishment cultivator is nothing more than a single sentence, a single game piece, to one at the Purple Mansion realm. Tell him not to worry."

After dismissing Li Wen, he finally began to tend to his wounds.

The main injuries Li Zhouwei had sustained in the great battle were to his head. His forehead had been fractured in two places. Though the external flesh had healed, an injury that affected the bone was not so easily mended. His other wounds were from the water chains he'd endured while taking Guan Kan's life, but those were healing quickly with the help of medicinal elixirs.

***

Li Zhouwei had only been recuperating in the hall for a dozen days, occasionally pausing to reply to messages, when Kong Guxi and the others unexpectedly returned.

Sumian had kept his word. The Xuanmiao Temple had put forth a genuine effort. The injuries of the Profound Peak Gate cultivators had greatly improved. Those with minor wounds were almost fully recovered, and even the heavily injured would be restored after a year or so of seclusion. Kong Guxi, however, wore a grim expression.

Li Zhouwei summoned Li Chenghui and questioned him in detail. He learned that the Xuanmiao Temple had already constructed a courtyard on the mountain where Changxi had passed away. They had even given it a name. Because it directly faced Lake Xian, it was called Gehu Peak—the Peak that Wards off the Lake—with the meaning that hardship, like the vast lake, was to be kept outside the temple's gates by this peak.

It was difficult to say whether this was a gesture of goodwill or an assertion of dominance. The Kong Clan was at its most vulnerable and had to rely on the Xuanmiao Temple for healing. Kong Guxi had naturally worn a fawning expression when he went there, but upon returning to the wilderness, he fell silent.

After Li Chenghui finished his report, Li Zhouwei responded, "It's not necessarily a bad thing that he's displeased. It might even be his way of demonstrating loyalty. In any case, send someone to placate him. We will need the Xuanmiao Temple's healing services again in the future, so we can't allow the Profound Peak Gate members to become too resentful."

The Xuanmiao Temple, after all, followed a Treasured Earth Dao lineage and possessed considerable expertise in healing. Neither Li Ximing nor Li Zhouwei would easily let go of such a valuable resource.

Li Cheng acknowledged the order and withdrew. As light and shadow shifted in the hall, Li Zhouwei had just finished healing a patch of skin when Li Ximing tore through the Great Void and descended.

In his hand, he held a horned beast, no larger than a calf, bound tightly by the Profound Light. Despite its size, its aura was ferocious. Though it was immobilized, its eyes glared with untamed fury.

Li Ximing casually tossed the beast to the floor and smiled. "It's truly difficult to find an unaligned demon general these days. I searched along the river, all the way to the State of Wu. I asked a local clan for information and found this creature in the middle of devouring people. It had the misfortune of running into me."

He then produced a jade box from his sleeve and opened it. Inside lay a spirit grass that shimmered like fine jade. Without pausing, Li Ximing knocked the horned beast unconscious. "The Purple Smoke Gate gifted us the *Tome of Adamant Flame Alchemy*," he explained. "The alchemical techniques within are quite beneficial to me. It even includes a Purple Mansion pill recipe called the Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill, which is said to help overcome karmic trials."

"This beast follows the Pure Qi lineage, which is perfect. And with this Jade Lingzhi Clear Orchid from the Shen Clan, one batch should yield six pills—enough for all of you."

It was the first time Li Zhouwei had heard the name of a Purple Mansion-level pill. As he pondered it, Li Ximing shook his head. "This medicine is life-saving for a Foundation Establishment cultivator, but for someone at the Purple Mansion realm, it's merely for healing injuries. It's a common-grade item among Purple Mansion treasures. If it were truly exceptional, they wouldn't have given it to our family."

An ordinary alchemist would take three to five months to refine a batch of healing pills that used treasured herbs. But with his divine ability, Li Ximing could forgo a cauldron for many common elixirs. This particular pill would only take him three to five days. "I can now refine any pill below the Purple Mansion level with my divine ability," he continued. "The Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill isn't much more difficult. I'll have someone deliver it to you in a couple of days."

No matter how common it was, the elixir was still potent enough to heal a Purple Mansion Daoist Master. The Purple Smoke Gate's gift was not a light one. Li Ximing sighed. "It takes far too long for a demon beast to reach Foundation Establishment, and you can't just catch one whenever you want. It's no wonder the Daoist lineages of Jiangnan favor using humans for their alchemy."

As the two were discussing matters, Li Chenghui returned, entering the hall with a sense of urgency. His expression was somewhat awkward, and he only spoke in a low voice when he drew near. "Patriarch, Daoist Master... someone from the Sword Gate has arrived. They say they've come to the Profound Peak Gate to claim something."

"The Sword Gate? Myriad Radiance?"

This was a development no one had anticipated. Li Zhouwei was genuinely stunned. "Who is it? And what are they claiming?"

Li Cheng shook his head. "I've already arranged for them to be guided to a side hall and have summoned Kong Guxi and the others."

"Let them come up," Li Ximing said.

He immediately withdrew. Li Zhouwei rose from the main seat and moved to the side. The members of the Sword Gate entered the hall, led by the sword cultivator Cheng Jinzhu.

The longsword on his back seemed to hum with sharp intent, and his gaze was piercing. He first bowed to Li Ximing before clasping his hands in a salute. "Greetings, Daoist Master. Since our parting at the sword peak, my own Daoist Master has often spoken of you. He bade me to first extend his well-wishes."

"There's no need for such formality." Li Ximing had a good impression of Lingmei. After their conversation, he had found him to be far from the rigid traditionalists he imagined from the Sword Gate; he was actually quite agreeable.

Cheng Jinzhu did not waste time. After a few polite inquiries about their well-being, he got straight to the point. "This junior has come today on a certain matter... Senior Changxi once borrowed a Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain from my sect. He pledged that upon his death, he would return the southern shore of Lake Xian, along with the nine eastern towns of Shanji Prefecture. The time has now come for these to be returned."

His words fell into a stunned silence that enveloped the hall.

Though the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate was renowned for its integrity, Cheng Jinzhu's statement left Li Zhouwei, and even Li Ximing, momentarily speechless. A heavy quiet descended upon the hall.

The reason was simple: there had been no news, not even a whisper, of such an agreement. Neither Changxi nor Kong Guxi had ever mentioned it. It was only Myriad Radiance's stellar reputation that gave them pause; had it been any other sect, they would have immediately assumed it was a shameless act of opportunism, kicking a man when he was down.

After a noticeable pause, Li Ximing finally spoke. "Go and bring Kong Guxi up."

A few dozen breaths later, the middle-aged man hurried into the hall. He paid his respects to Li Ximing and the others before noticing Cheng Jinzhu. Kong Guxi's face showed no hint of suspicion, only a desire to curry favor. "Greetings, Daoist Cheng!"

By now, even Cheng Jinzhu looked puzzled. He glanced at Kong Guxi tentatively and said, "Greetings, Sect Master..."

A sense of suspicion grew in Li Zhouwei's heart. He smiled. "Sect Master Kong, this is an old matter concerning your Profound Peak Gate. The Cheng clan has come to retrieve something."

"Ah?"

Kong Guxi was completely lost. Seeing the situation in the hall, he had assumed the Li Clan was handing over Shanji Prefecture to Myriad Radiance and he was just here to witness the outcome. He never expected such a sudden turn of events, and a sense of unease washed over him.

Cheng Jinzhu had no choice but to repeat his statement. Kong Guxi's eyes widened in disbelief. Cheng Jinzhu even added, "The Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain is a dharma treasure our sect obtained from the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven. It is no ordinary item. The sect wishes to make use of it now, so I have come to inquire."

'A dharma treasure!'

A wave of bitter grief crashed over Kong Guxi. He raged internally. 'Fine, just fine! Everyone wants to kick us while we're down. But you, Myriad Radiance Sword Gate, you are a noble lineage of the Green Pine and Supreme Yang Dao! How could you be so cruel as to throw stones at my family? If you want our territory, just take it! Where would we possibly get a dharma treasure for you?'

But circumstances were stronger than he was. Let alone the Profound Peak Gate's current decline, even at the height of their power, the Kong Clan would not have dared to offend Myriad Radiance. Beads of sweat formed on his brow as he cast a pleading gaze toward Li Zhouwei.

Cheng Jinzhu was not slow to notice. He immediately sensed something was wrong. "Sect Master, can it be that you were unaware of this matter?"

'What does it matter if I was or not? If the Daoist Master says it exists, then it exists...' Kong Guxi saw that the members of the Li Clan remained silent and could only stammer, "Perhaps... perhaps there was such an arrangement... This territory is to be yielded to the Sword Gate..."

An odd expression flickered across Cheng Jinzhu's face. "Sect Master Kong, where is the dharma treasure?"

With the conversation at this point, Li Ximing had to intervene. "This involves a dharma treasure, a matter of great importance," he said. "The Sword Gate may take possession of the pledged territory for now. As for the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain, I have not yet seen it. Let us set the matter aside for the moment. The Profound Peak Gate can cede a few more towns as payment to continue leasing the dharma treasure. If you have an urgent need for it, I will discuss the matter in detail with Senior Lingmei."

Whatever Myriad Radiance's motives were, and whether this agreement was real or not, having someone take over a portion of Shanji Prefecture was a good thing. Li Ximing decided to lock it in. Cheng Jinzhu was in no position to negotiate with Li Ximing, but fortunately, his master had given him instructions beforehand. He spoke with a serious tone, "Since the Daoist Master has spoken, this matter will be arranged by Moongaze Lake. My Sword Gate understands that the Profound Peak Gate is at a critical juncture. The Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain may be of extreme importance to your esteemed sect. We are not a lineage that preys on the vulnerable. My master said long ago that if it is a matter of the Profound Peak Gate's survival, its return is not absolutely necessary."

Li Zhouwei, however, recalled something. "Your esteemed sect may send men to take control of Shanji Prefecture, but Lake Xian is now in the hands of the Xuanmiao Temple. To cede the southern shore, you will have to speak with Daoist Master Sumian."

"Clan Head," Cheng Jinzhu replied with a steady smile, shaking his head. "My master sent a letter yesterday. The Xuanmiao Temple has already complied. In fact, Daoist Master Sumian came to our sword peak to offer his apologies to my master, but he was not present. He was received by Daoist Master Qi and sent back."

The statement revealed the staggering status of the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate. Yet, both Kong Guxi and Cheng Jinzhu seemed to take it as a matter of course. Li Ximing's eyes narrowed slightly as understanding dawned.

'Is it because of Lingmei's supreme strength and unparalleled swordsmanship, or is it that the status of the Green Pine Dao lineage... is far more revered than we imagined?'

'In the Yue State, whether it's the Three Sects and Ten Gates or the subsequent Seven Gates, these powers rise and fall. Yet the six Dao lineages of the Chongming Palace have endured without fail. How could that be a coincidence?'
