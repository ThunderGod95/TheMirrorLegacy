# Chapter 882: Luoxia Becomes the Mountain

Li Ximing’s heart tightened as he fell deep into thought.

'According to the rumors, one must cultivate a "medicine person" for years, nurturing them with one's own aura. That might be a challenge for rogue cultivators at the Purple Mansion Realm, but for a major sect? It would be laughably simple. They could prepare eight or ten candidates at once. It's easiest if they come from a poor background, but even a disciple from a prominent family... When the time is right, the sect just issues a notice. "Transferred overseas," or "Dispatched to the Southern Borderlands." Partway through the journey, they tear open the Great Void, consume the person, and simply don't return for years. Who would ever find out?'

'Even if this wondrous technique has limitations preventing them from grooming ten people at once, just having one or two... It's not their own cultivated power, anyway. They can use it to attempt a breakthrough, and at worst, it's an extra layer of insurance.'

'But using the Art of Rebirth to achieve a new divine ability... what's the underlying principle?'

Li Ximing didn't possess the Art of Rebirth to examine. At his current level, he could only speculate on the benefits of seizing another's immortal foundation to advance his own cultivation. But all of that assumed one already possessed a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method. Without one, what good was forcing that stolen foundation into the Shengyang Acupoint? You'd just be stuck.'

'The true "rebirth" aspect of the technique... there must be another crucial component. Just as Daoist Master Yuansu said all those years ago, it likely requires numerous Purple Mansion Realm-level spiritual items to assist... Only then could it truly work as intended.'

'Besides, the Art of Rebirth... every faction has its own version. Changxi claimed he was too principled to use it in his early years, but I doubt that. It was likely just a ploy to build rapport with me. The truth is, he probably didn't have a decent method to begin with.'

Li Ximing remembered Changxi's exact words: 'I know nothing of this art, I've had no success with it at all... I could only take him in as a guest elder.'

'Those were his words. Yet Chi Wei used the technique freely. In Changxi's hands, it was a century of failure... That's the difference a Daoist tradition makes.'

'That must also be why Chi Wei sought out Can Lufu for alchemy.'

'Back then, Changxi's Daoist tradition was in ruins, so of course he had no good techniques. The only two worth mentioning, Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire and the Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra, both ended up with my family.'

Li Ximing had no intention of seeking out the Art of Rebirth, nor would it be easy to obtain. If he stumbled upon it by chance, he might give it a passing glance to satisfy his curiosity, nothing more. He sighed inwardly, carefully reviewing his memories.

'Daoist Master Yuansu died before he could, so he certainly never used it. Yuanxiu definitely didn't use it in his early days, though it's hard to say what he did for his final divine ability in his later years. As for Yuanwu... I've heard no rumors.'

At this thought, Li Ximing's brow unfurrowed. He finally understood, and the pieces of his theory fell into place.

'No wonder... Yehui managed to attain three divine abilities, and Changxiao became a Great Daoist Master.'

Nine out of ten rogue cultivators in the Purple Mansion Realm have incomplete Daoist traditions. The Art of Rebirth is incredibly effective at shortening breakthrough times, but even if they had a brilliant version of it, they still lack the Purple Mansion Realm cultivation methods. They're like Zhu Gong: to break through, they *must* rely on the technique's path-continuing effect. But the subsequent cost of doing so is astronomical, far beyond what most could ever gather.

However, cultivators from well-established, resource-rich lineages like the Jiangnan Supreme Yang Dao are different. They either have exacting standards for their divine abilities or hold to a righteous path. They live stable lives, face no imminent threats, and have others defer to them. They are unwilling to take shortcuts or stoop to using someone else's immortal foundation. Often, it's not until their later years, after becoming a Great Daoist Master and still lacking their final one or two divine abilities, that they finally feel the need for such a technique. This, paradoxically, makes their progress appear slower.

Of course, the Supreme Yang Dao also produces people like Chi Wei. The inevitable result is that Azure Pond earned the reputation of a demonic sect.

It's only the overseas rogue cultivators like Changxiao, Yehui, and Guo Shentong—those who stumbled upon a complete Daoist tradition *and* might also possess a potent version of the Art of Rebirth—who act with true impunity. Their cultivation speed simply skyrockets!

'Everyone called them geniuses back in the day. But looking back from the Purple Mansion Realm, it's clear it wasn't just fate. There were concrete reasons.'

He exhaled. He was about to begin his cultivation cycles, but after a moment's thought, a lingering worry kept him from settling. He slowly closed his eyes, and his spiritual sense pulsed.

A moment later, a courtyard guard ascended the steps, bowed respectfully, and said, "Congratulations, Daoist Master! The Family Head left instructions that he wished to see you the moment you emerged from seclusion."

"Send him up," Li Ximing instructed.

He had been concerned about the Shichuan on the Viewing Pavilion Platform. Fortunately, he had already refined the ancient dharma artifact. The distance wasn't great; using his Bright Yang divine ability to connect with the Great Void, he made a quick calculation. The Shichuan's refinement was nearly complete, with only a tenth of the process remaining.

He was overjoyed at this. He had been about to summon Chu Minglian for a detailed report, but since Li Jiangqian had already sent someone, he would hear him out first.

Soon, Li Jiangqian ascended, bowing before the steps. "Congratulations, Ancestor, on the great success of your divine ability!" he said respectfully.

Li Jiangqian, of course, had no way of knowing if he had actually succeeded. They had simply discussed beforehand that this seclusion was for perfecting a divine ability. Every time Li Ximing emerged, someone was there to congratulate him on his "great success." They were just pleasantries, and he was used to them. The crimson-robed young man continued concisely, "Grand-uncle Lord Heavenly Pavilion Heavenly Glow has returned from overseas. He is currently on the lake and requests an audience with the Daoist Master!"

"Zhi-ge'r is back!" Li Ximing was overjoyed. He shot to his feet. "What are you waiting for? Invite him in! No, forget it... I will go and greet him myself!"

The Daoist Master dissolved into a streak of light, traversing the Great Void. In the blink of an eye, he emerged above the lake. Looking ahead, he saw the brocade-robed Pavilion Master approaching, riding a cloud of mist. Li Ximing hurried forward, grinning. "Zhi-ge'r!"

Li Xizhi smiled and clasped his hands. "Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing grabbed his arm and guided him toward the mountain, sighing. "Daoist Master, Daoist Master... what Daoist Master? It's Daoist Masters who are supposedly devoid of emotion. We are brothers. Third Brother, there's no need for such formalities. It makes us sound like strangers."

Li Xizhi landed beside him. Even after all these years, he still possessed that same air of noble grace, though his long tenure in a high position had added an effortless authority to his presence. He smiled. "You have achieved a divine ability, after all. As your brother, no one is happier than I am. I call you Daoist Master with sincere willingness. It gives me confidence. Saying the title reminds me that our family has its own Purple Mansion Realm expert."

Li Ximing laughed heartily. He had been rushing about for so long, he hadn't even had time to visit his brother in years. He was deeply moved. "Did something happen at Splitreed?"

Li Xizhi shook his head. "After all this time, what could happen? No, it's just... my cultivation has been stagnant for years. I'm thinking it's time to make a move."

"I cultivate the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique. While it's part of the Azure Pond Daoist tradition, it was actually left behind by a member of the Chi family—or rather, obtained by one of their ancestors. It was remarkably complete even then. And though it has been refined over the last five centuries, the core techniques remain unchanged from what its creator first passed down."

"This Daoist's name is lost, but he cultivated in the region of Mount Duan. That cultivator from the Lingu Family all those years ago, Lingu Xia, also practiced this technique. I asked the Lingu Family—he, too, went to Mount Duan and vanished. He's either off searching for an opportunity or already in seclusion, attempting his breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm."

Li Ximing nodded grimly. He filled a teacup from the pot on the table. "Heavenly Glow Daoist traditions... I asked both the Supreme Yang and Nine Mounds factions about this when I was in the Eastern Sea. I'm afraid it won't be easy to obtain."

Li Ximing had indeed looked into this for Li Xizhi's sake. He had specifically asked about it back on Nine Mounds. Both parties—one from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, the other from the overseas Nine Mounds—became extremely guarded when the subject was raised. Lingdu was at least tactful about it; Houfu simply gave a flat refusal.

He relayed this to his brother, speaking somewhat cryptically. "The impression I got from both Daoist traditions is that... while the two places seem different, they are both, in fact, the territory of a single entity."

This referred to Mount Duan and Luoxia. One was the resting place of the Heavenly Glow, the other its origin and terminus. According to both major Daoist traditions, both locations were the domain of Wuguang Xiexia.

Li Xizhi hesitated for a moment before replying, "I know. The truth is, the Heavenly Glow fills the sky; there's nowhere that isn't its domain. I couldn't leave before, partly because I was worried about the family. But also, while there was no great war in the Eastern Sea, Daoist Master Qiuhu kept me there in preparation for the Southern Sea. Now, the Southern Sea has been carved up by the various families, the Buddhist cultivators have withdrawn, and I'm not really needed... If I don't go now, I might never get another chance."

"My status... is, after all, rather sensitive."

Li Ximing fell silent. His brother was right. He was, ultimately, a cultivator of the Supreme Yang Dao Daoist tradition and not his own master. The fact that Ning Wan was willing to let him leave to seek his breakthrough was already a gesture of respect for Li Ximing. If any new situation arose, Li Xizhi, lacking a Purple Mansion Realm method, would be forced to toil for the Supreme Yang Dao indefinitely, with no end in sight.

Li Xizhi was not like Li Queyi. His current good relationship with the Supreme Yang Dao and Ning Wan was a subtle thing. If the political winds shifted... or even if they didn't, Li Xizhi was a pawn that could be used, perhaps without him even realizing it, to forcibly drag Li Ximing into their conflicts.

Seeing that Li Ximing understood his implication, Li Xizhi nodded discreetly and changed the subject. "Furthermore, there is the 'Rainbow Cloud' path. It stands independent of Yin-Yang and the Five Virtues, separate from the Twelve Qi and the Ancients. Primordial Magnetism and lightning cannot stir it; blood-fiends cannot breach it. It abides between the world's zenith and the realms of water and fire. Where it stands, neither Bright Yang nor Profound Light can perceive it; neither Upper Shaman nor star-gazer can hear it. Its power is immense, its mysteries profound. So why do so few cultivate it?"

Li Ximing listened silently as his brother continued. "First, the cultivation methods are exceedingly rare, far beyond the reach of rogue cultivators. Second... even for those who obtain one, like Azure Pond, whichever family holds it refuses to practice it themselves. At most, they'll toss it to a minor outsider. And even then, they worry that if that outsider reaches the Purple Mansion Realm and later falls, the power will become uncontrollable."

"Back then, not one of the four great families of Azure Pond would touch it. Nor would the Yuan, Yu, Yang, Xiao, Eastern Yue, or Lingu Family before them. When I asked our Master for this Daoist tradition, it was for the sake of absolute security. And now... this is the price for that security."

"After all, Master never imagined I would one day touch the threshold of the Purple Mansion Realm. Without that foresight, the 'Rainbow Cloud' path seemed the safest, most proper choice."

The middle-aged man's expression was complex. He set down his jade cup. "Wu Earth... on the ground, it forms mountains; in the sky, it forms clouds. The so-called Heavenly Glow is, in fact, Wu Light. Wu Light was originally just one of many lights, alongside Heavenly Light, Magnetic Light, and Treasure Light. But now, it hangs isolated in the sky, perpetually, year after year..."

Li Xizhi stopped there, as if daring not to say more. He retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve, placed it gently on the table, and lowered his voice. "I have been at Azure Pond and Splitreed for many years and have read countless Daoist scriptures. None of them were great treasures, but after reading thousands of texts, one is bound to learn something."

"I've acquired many techniques and even refined several Dharma Arts to a level beyond my predecessors, but they are of little use to the family. Except for one. It's a technique called the «Wondrous Art of Splitting Wu Cloud». It was an ancient spell art that I acquired at the same time as the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda."

"When I got it, I realized it was a spell art as profound as the famed 'Art of Merging Streams'. Its limitations were just too severe. I have spent years slowly modifying it, and this is the result..."

"This art... is designed to refine light into Wu Earth. To bring it from heaven to earth. To make Luoxia become a mountain."

Li Ximing was visibly shaken. "Is this a chance for liberation?"

Li Xizhi laughed and shook his head. "I don't have that kind of power. If I had that level of attainment, I wouldn't be agonizing over my own situation. But this spell art should be useful to you. It can turn Luoxia into Wu Earth. The Heavenly Glow in the world is abundant, and spiritual items from it are not rare, but their applications are very limited. With this, you can try to convert them into Wu Earth spiritual items."

Li Ximing felt little joy. His expression was conflicted. The brother before him clearly had ambitions for the Purple Mansion Realm, but he had been trapped on Splitreed Island for far too long. He met Li Xizhi's eyes, then looked down in silence for a moment. "Brother, if you go to Mount Duan, do not be reckless. Without a proper cultivation method... be cautious about attempting to break through."

"I understand." Li Xizhi smiled and shook his head. "There is one more thing. The Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda. When I obtained it from those cultivators, it wasn't simply to add to the family's reserves. There is something more important inside it."

Li Ximing immediately shot him a questioning look. His brother continued, "Daoist Master Yuanxiu examined it. By then, he already knew his death was certain and had given up hope that you would join Azure Pond. He wished to accumulate some good karma, but he couldn't find any trace of you, so he secretly bestowed this favor upon me instead."

"He left one instruction: the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda itself is not important. The key is the spiritual items within. They appear to be mere Foundation Establishment Realm materials, but at the very bottom, there is a Purple Mansion Realm-level spiritual item!"

"The item is a 'Heavenly Rampart Stone,' a material that is now extinct. If the family ever falls on truly desperate times, you can shatter the dharma artifact to retrieve it."

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. He let out a long sigh. "Brother..."

Li Xizhi shook his head and said quietly, "Senior Yuanxiu's hope was that... one day, if Si Yuanli manages to break through and finds himself in trouble, our family might be able to lend him a hand."

"There was no written record, no oath. It's not a binding obligation. A Purple Mansion Realm item is incredibly precious, after all. I was afraid of an accident on the road, so I never spoke of this to anyone. I just wanted you, Daoist Master, to be aware."

Li Ximing nodded. Li Xizhi sipped his tea, then looked up. "The Yang clan's ambitions are vast, far beyond a single sect... I don't know what the future will look like. Li Chenghuai and his mother are safest and in the best position remaining at Splitreed. As for Zhouluo... he can serve as a minor pillar, but he is not the one to bear the weight of the family. Just let him live his life in peace."

He set down his cup. Li Ximing then hesitantly explained the situation with the Dharma Sword. Li Xizhi sighed. "I have troubled the family with these matters."

With that, he stood up and smiled. "These cultivation methods and spell arts I've researched... I will leave them with the family, just in case. But it is my hope that our descendants will never again have to cultivate the Heavenly Glow."
