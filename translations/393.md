# Chapter 508: Inquiries

He's from the Golden Feather Immortal Sect, huh...

Upon hearing that his surname was Zhang and taking in the attire he wore, Li Qinghong immediately understood that Zhang Yun wanted to remain incognito by referring to himself as a swordsman of Jiangnan, so she chose not to expose him.

Zhang Yun...

The name was familiar, and combined with his tone, it immediately brought someone to mind.

When Li Tongya infiltrated the Snake Demon Cave Dwelling back then, he had to share the spoils with a swordsman named Zhang Yun.

Zhang Yun picked the snake demon's inner core and the Blood Dharma Manual, while Li Tongya received the River Mountain Sutra and the Duruo Spear that she still wielded today.

Li Qinghong deduced that this was likely the same Zhang Yun from years past. Now, seventy or eighty years later, he was about to reach the Purple Mansion Realm.

This man... is a direct descendant of the three sects!

She cupped her fist and introduced herself.

"Greetings, Senior. I am Li Qinghong. Li Tongya is my grandfather."

"Ah, so you are the descendant of an old friend of mine," Zhang Yun replied, glancing at her while his golden robe fluttered in the wind.

"Your immortal foundation is good. The thunder talisman is decent, too. However, your spear technique is average. As for your escape techniques, spells, and secret arts, they lack substance. They might intimidate prominent clans since they are on par with those from the seven gates. Yet, against the Golden Feather and Azure Pond, they would struggle to prevail."

Li Qinghong nodded in acknowledgment. Zhang Yun studied the two of them, standing with his hands behind his back, and then inquired, "Since you know of my friendship with your elder, why don't you invite me in?"

After hearing this blunt request, Li Qinghong had no choice but to lead him inside. The Green Ox River Embrace Formation on Qingdu Peak was likely just mere decoration in his presence. If he had intended to harm her, he could have done so long ago.

Zhang Yun seemed oblivious to her concerns, or perhaps he simply did not care. He landed on the mountain, surveying the White Irises that peppered the landscape, and said softly, "Li Tongya... What a pity. When I heard he had broken through to Foundation Establishment Realm, I thought we would eventually have a formal duel! But it seems that chance has passed."

Li Qinghong remained cautious and held her tongue as she walked with Zhang Yun, who continued to muse aloud, "The younger generation taught by Li Tongya is quite impressive, far better than I was at their age. Although my three sons are gifted, they lack discipline since I'm always in long seclusions... They have grown into rather arrogant boys."

Zhang Yun seemed to suddenly realize he had strayed from the topic and quickly added, "But... I came here this time to remind you of one thing..."

"Don't concern yourself with Zhang Huaide's affairs or any other incidents occurring along the riverbank. I was sent to oversee this matter personally. I consider Li Tongya a friend, which is why I made this trip. Just take care of yourselves," he said.

Li Qinghong thanked him softly, but Zhang Yun suddenly stopped, standing with his hands behind his back as he asked, "The River Mountain Sutra is still in your family's possession, correct?"

After a brief pause, Li Qinghong replied, "Yes, Senior, that's correct."

Although Zhang Yun was no longer a young man, he still had a playful demeanor. With a smile, he simply commented, "Great."

Then, his expression shifted to one of curiosity as he asked, "Is the Wanglin Blossom also from your family?"

Li Qinghong was taken aback by the sudden question but quickly understood the implications.

It's said that the Wanglin Blossoms have been extinct in Jiangnan for hundreds of years. The three sects monitor everything in Jiangnan closely. They must have heard about my family suddenly acquiring one...

"Yes!" she replied respectfully.

Zhang Yun's demeanor turned serious as he pressed on, "Where did it come from?"

Li Qinghong's mind raced. Zhang Yun clearly understood the significance of the Wanglin Blossom, which was why he was inquiring about it. Yet, her family knew little about it.

This must be connected to the Wang Family!

Her family lacked critical information, and their status was not equal to that of the three sects. If she tried anything funny, it might backfire. Thus, Li Qinghong could only be as vague as possible in her response.

"It was left by a Daoist from the north. My family assisted him, and in gratitude, he gifted us with the spirit root."

Zhang Yun, who appeared somewhat frivolous moments ago, now looked very serious as he asked, "What is their cultivation level and surname?"

Li Qinghong hesitated before replying, "That senior is quite strange. He has a majestic aura, yet you can't discern his cultivation level. His surname... is Wang!"

She was smart, choosing her words carefully. While Wang Xun treated her as an equal, she respectfully referred to him as a senior. Hence, her description painted the picture of a formidable northerner, prompting a frown from Zhang Yun.

"I had a feeling his surname would be Wang!" he exclaimed, exhaling deeply as realization struck.

Wang Family of Yinghua Wang! A Golden Core Realm Clan!

Shocked, he asked in confusion, "That is an immortal clan from the north... How can someone from a small clan help him?"

"My elder left behind a sword named Qingche, which contains his sword intent. The senior merely wished to take a look at it," Li Qinghong explained softly.

Understanding dawned on Zhang Yun.

"Ah, yes, that's indeed the only rather interesting thing about your Li Family... Where is the sword?"

"It has been taken by my brother on his trip to the south," she replied.

Zhang Yun could only give up. He nodded, acknowledging the situation then suddenly chuckled softly, saying, "This is your family's opportunity, but don't overthink it... Wang Family of Yinghua is most afraid of being tainted by worldly karma. The fact he bestowed this spirit root upon your family means he has already calculated everything and ensured that your paths will not cross again!"

Li Qinghong raised an eyebrow slightly at his words, and Zhang Yun's clear eyes indicated he had seen through the calculations at play.

She sighed inwardly.

The direct descendants of the Golden Feather Sect are indeed difficult to deal with...

Unbeknownst to her, Zhang Yun felt a pang of regret as he thought to himself, So, it was given by the Wang Family of Yinghua! What a pity. Since the Wanglin Blossom is immensely useful, I intended to come to the Li Family to take this Foundation Establishment Realm spirit root for my own use at the sect... But it seems that I truly can't take it.

After all, the gift from the Wang Family of Yinghua represented a culmination of cause and effect. If Zhang Yun were to snatch it away after just a few years, the Wang Family would inevitably be displeased. Although the Foundation Establishment Realm spirit root was precious, it was not essential for Zhang Yun, and he had no desire to offend the Wang Family.

He looked at Li Qinghong and suddenly asked, "Has your brother also reached the Foundation Establishment Realm?"

Li Qinghong did not dare to lie about such an obvious question and simply nodded.

Zhang Yun smiled and murmured, "Interesting... interesting... Three generations of a family with five Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators—there must be something unusual about that."

After a moment's reflection, he continued, "Ning Tiaoxiao also personally arranged the marriage. He must have discovered something about the Li Family, hmm..."

"Li Qinghong... does your brother also practice Boundless Ocean?" Zhang Yun asked.

"Yes," Li Qinghong replied softly.

Zhang Yun chuckled and nodded.

"Good... very good!"

As soon as he finished speaking, he ignored the Li Family members entirely and enveloped himself in golden light. With that, he passed through their family's formation effortlessly and headed north on his own.

Li Qinghong bowed her head and saw him off, watching as he walked away laughing. It was only then did she release a sigh of relief, her back damp with sweat.

When she noticed Li Xicheng rushing into the yard, she said urgently, "Stop the news immediately. Don't let anyone know about Zhang Yun's visit!"

Li Xicheng nodded in agreement.

"Don't worry, Auntie... The fight just now happened too quickly! We only know that someone used a thunder spell. I'll inform everyone that you were practicing your spells."

Hengdong Prefecture.

"This is far enough, fellow Daoist. There's no need to be so formal," Li Xijun said softly as he and his companions reached the edge of Hengzhu Prefecture.

They cupped their fists to Bi Chengjuan and added, "Let's bid each other farewell here!"

Bi Chengjuan nodded and replied, "If you pass through Hengzhu in the future, just mention my name, and I will personally come to receive you."

With a grateful smile, Li Xijun took his leave. Though Li Xuanxuan still appeared old and frail, he now seemed much more energized, his eyes clearer, and a smile had returned to his face.

"This Hengzhu's Tranquil Purification Technique is truly effective! The heaviness in my heart has lifted significantly, and I can wield my true essence more easily," he remarked.

Li Xijun smiled and responded, "That's a good sign. Granduncle, you must follow the instructions and avoid fighting for the next few years. Otherwise, it could interfere with your cultivation."

Concerned that Li Xuanxuan might disregard his advice, he quickly added, "If a fight breaks out, those Spirit Stones we spent would all have gone to waste!"

"I understand... Of course, I know..." Li Xuanxuan replied, then mumbled trivialities. The atmosphere lightened significantly. Kongheng chanted scriptures as they flew on, watching the old and young man chatter amiably.

After arriving at the Helin Mountain Range, the two landed and began their separate searches for spirit items. They spent two months scouring the area, discovering only one or two minor spirit items with no significant finds.

Li Xijun reunited with Li Xuanxuan at the appointed time, who looked increasingly relaxed over the past two months. The old man held a handful of plums, offering a few to Li Xijun.

Amused, Li Xijun accepted them but remarked regretfully, "I never expected the spiritual energy of Mount Helin to be so poor... No wonder there haven't been any notable spirit items here in all these years."

Li Xuanxuan took a few plums and handed them to Kongheng, who received them with a smile.

"There aren't even many demons in this Helin Mountain Range; it can't compare to Mount Dali," Li Xuanxuan remarked.

Li Xijun took out a map and suggested, "We still have plenty of time. Why don't we cross the prefecture and head to the mountain ranges of Quanwu and Dongli?"

Li Xuanxuan naturally had no objections. The three of them quickly finalized their itinerary and set off to the east, preparing to head northeast to Quanwu Mountain Range first.

"Quanwu Mountain Range is truly vast," Kongheng remarked, gazing at the distant peaks faintly visible through the clouds.

"When we traveled south, we crossed the western foothill of this mountain. Now, after making a huge round, we've only reached its eastern foothill."

Seizing the opportunity, Li Xijun asked, "How does it compare to Mount Luoxia?"

Kongheng pondered for a moment before replying, "It's hard to make a direct comparison. There are also majestic mountains to the north, most of which are renowned for their high elevation and abundant spiritual energy. However, they differ from this mountain, which stretches continuously for tens of thousands of li..."

"However, if we're only comparing spiritual energy, Mount Luoxia is undoubtedly the best. No other place can compare to it," he concluded with decisiveness.

"Mount Luoxia is without a doubt the location with the most abundant spiritual energy in the world, followed by the grotto heavens or blessed lands of various sects. The rest of the mountains are at the end of the list," Kongheng stated with rare confidence.

"What Dao lineage is associated with Mount Luoxia?" Li Xijun asked curiously.

Kongheng seemed momentarily lost in thought before he responded, "The name Luoxia comes from a True Monarch who resides there. He forged his Dao through Heavenly Glow. It's said all Heavenly Glows in this world must yield to his control... When the sun and moon replace each other, the first ray of light emerges from Mount Luoxia."

"Only when this first ray descends upon the mountain can various other Heavenly Glows be born. It is said there are seventy-two types of Heavenly Glows in the world, and forty-eight of them are the creations of this True Monarch's divine ability."[1]

Li Xijun then inquired, "Since Mount Luoxia is the strongest Dao lineage in the north, I assume there must be more than one True Monarch, right?"

Kongheng replied softly, "As for how many True Monarchs exist in Mount Luoxia, how many are on the mainland, how many are overseas, and how many have departed this land—there have always been differing opinions, and no one knows for certain. Only in the past few hundred years have three True Monarchs emerged and made their presence known. These are real Golden Core Realm True Monarchs!"

Noticing that the Li Family members were listening intently, he added, "But I've also heard rumors that the True Monarch who forged his Dao with Heavenly Glow had become an immortal."

"Became an immortal?!"

Jiangnan Daoist cultivators often referred to these immortals as Fairies or Exalted Immortals, while northern Buddhist cultivators often spoke of attaining enlightenment or achieving the Dao.

However, Li Xijun understood that the term become an immortal, as used by Kongheng, carried a much deeper meaning.

"You're referring to... Dao Embryo?" he asked softly.

"Yes..." Kongheng nodded, with a slight envious expression on his face, and continued softly, "I heard that he has already gained the immortal body of Dao Embryo and become truly immortal... for as long as the heaven and earth still exist, and as long as the sun and the moon still shines. I wonder if he is still on Mount Luoxia..."

"What an impressive divine ability master," Li Xijun praised, but Kongheng shook his head slightly and then asked, "Isn't there also an immortal in the south, where you are from?

Seeing Li Xijun and the others looking puzzled, Kongheng asked curiously, "Well... I heard that whenever the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in your south break through to the Golden Core Realm, that person will send someone to collect metallic essence. Is that true?"

Realization finally dawned upon Li Xijun and he replied, "Ah, so that's what you're talking about! Yes, it's true!"

"Yes!" Kongheng exclaimed, before asking, "What level of cultivation does this immortal have? How did he become an immortal? Where is his immortal mansion?"

Li Xijun could only shake his head helplessly in response to the monk's series of questions, and said softly, "To be honest, the three sects have always controlled the circulation of news in Jiangnan. It is said that they once destroyed books in a concentrated manner, blurring out a lot of information about the achievements of Foundation Establishment and Purple Mansion Realms. My family has a shallow foundation, and I have to rely on overseas cultivators just to learn about Jiangnan, let alone any immortals..."

Kongheng nodded thoughtfully and apologized.

The group traveled day and night and flew for half a month before they finally arrived at the other side of Mount Quanwu, which was adjacent to Libu Prefecture in the north and Mount Dongli in the east. It was an area with fewer demons and much safer.

They promptly dispersed to look for water veins and spirit items.

————

Li Xizhi left the sect and flew north quickly on the wind. On the way, he clumsily coaxed Huai'er in his arms to sleep and settled in a small town.

Although Cheng Huai was very obedient, he could no longer hold it back after lying in his arms for two days. He flailed around, wanting to go down for a walk. Li Xizhi tried feeding him some fruits, but he refused to eat.

"I guess we'll rest for a while... Libu Prefecture is still a long way to go. "

By the time Li Xizhi descended, the sky was already dark, but there were still lights flickering in the town below him. He stopped to look and found that the people in the town were gathered in a group, holding up fire torches.

1. For Luoxia (落霞), "Luo" (落) means "to descend" and "xia"(霞) could mean either the "glow of sunrise or sunset". Since the context of "xia" here is vague, I translated Xiaguang (霞光, literal tl: light/glow of sunrise/sunset) as "Heavenly Glow". ☜
