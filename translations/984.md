# Chapter 984: The Oath of Xixiao

The arrival of Li Zhouwei, riding a current of brilliant light, gave both men a profound shock.

‘It’s… the old imperial family…’

The heart of the yellow-robed Daoist Master instantly tightened with a complex mix of emotions. A single glance at those golden eyes and the shimmering golden patterns on the man’s neck left a bitter taste in his mouth. He was utterly at a loss for how to react.

The bright Spiritual Artifact in his hand dimmed slightly. He remained silent, making no unnecessary movements as he took a step back. As intricate feelings flooded his mind, an unexpected wave of fear washed over him.

‘Bright Yang is a tyrannical path. By forcing Cui Jueyin back to the island… I’ve already violated the Oath of Xixiao! I’ve also offended him deeply, an insult of the highest order. It would have been better if we had never crossed paths, but now that we have…’

Cui Yushan hailed from the West Curtain Sea. His ancestors had migrated from the Eastern Sea when Li Xuan was restoring the empire. Whether it was because the Cui clan’s branches had grown distant from the main lineage and were unwilling to bear the karma of a hundred generations, or because it was a measure for the Chongzhou’s Cui clan to preserve its bloodline, his branch of the West Curtain Sea Cui had unequivocally severed its ties with the Li clan, seeking to cut away the karmic debts of the past.

He believed he had done nothing wrong in this matter, but in the eyes of an imperial descendant, such distinctions of right and wrong were meaningless.

His heart leaped into his throat. The Heavenly Light beneath his feet flickered, and his divine ability seemed to shrink in the presence of the man before him. He felt an overwhelming urge to turn and flee.

Just then, the blue-robed Daoist Master frowned, his own heart lurching in suspicion.

‘It’s Li Zhouwei!’

This Daoist Master came from Mount Qusi in the Southern Sea, a sect that had been one and the same with Daoist Master Xuanyi's Mount Jingyi several hundred years ago. They were still considered brethren, maintaining close ties. He actually recognized Li Zhouwei of Moongaze—Xuanyi himself had told him:

‘A conflict with Wei-Li… would be most unwise…’

He sighed inwardly.

‘Although Xuanyi claims to be on good terms with some Daoist Master Zhaojing, there’s no proof. It’s a difficult situation to explain. But the bond between the Cui and the Li is known to all the world. He will certainly side with Yangya… It’s best to avoid any misunderstanding!’

And so, without a single word of explanation or a moment wasted, he said nothing, summoned a current of light, and dissolved into a gust of dharma power, vanishing from the scene.

The scene was thick with irony. Both Li Zhouwei and Yangya understood precisely why the man had retreated so readily, leaving Yangya in an awkward position, unsure whether to advance or withdraw.

According to protocol, as a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Cui family who had received the Wei Empire’s Daoist Tradition, he should have bent the knee upon seeing the White Qilin and addressed him as ‘Your Excellency’—even ‘Your Highness’ or ‘My Lord’ would not have been out of place.

‘Inside this grotto-heaven, all the lords are watching. If I say those words… it would be tantamount to forcing the West Curtain Sea Cui, and even the entire Chongzhou, to choose a side!’

But if he didn’t say them, how could Yangya possibly feel at ease?

How did the Cui clan rise to power? In the beginning, they were merely a noble family in the mountains, one of the six great clans of Guanlong, no different from the Lin or the Qi. It was the harmonious bond between the Wei Emperor and the Cui ancestor, Cui Yan, who swore an oath upon Mount Xixiao to build a great enterprise, that led to their later glory.

At that time, the Wei Emperor had promised:

For as long as the Wei Dynasty stands, you shall be the master of the High Radiance.

And Cui Yan had replied:

Bathed in your magnanimous grace, I, your humble servant, shall assist the celestial branch. Should any of my kin or descendants fail in their duties and dare to oppress the common people… may the radiance strike them down.

Later, one became the Bright Yang Imperial Monarch, and the other, the High Radiance True Monarch. The oath was fulfilled. Throughout the entire Wei Dynasty, the Cui clan enjoyed boundless spiritual fortune, achieving the status of celestial nobility and even becoming the foremost family in the land. At the Celestial Dynasty’s peak, just before its fall, Cui Mu was even able to assume the false station of a True Monarch through the dynasty’s laws. What an incredible honor that was.

Reading that period of history, every descendant of the Cui clan would be shaken beyond words. Even though the history that followed was filled with endless blood and tears, the Cui family had experienced true glory. When future generations asked about their past, they could answer with pride:

"I am kin to a True Monarch's clan."

The history of Wei-Li was both the source of the Cui family's suffering and its brightest, most prideful legacy. Cui Yushan was no exception; he remembered it with particular clarity. Even as one of the staunchest advocates for severing ties with the Li, in his youth, he too had dreamed in the dead of night of the Imperial Monarch’s return to the world, of the realm once again having a sovereign father.

Yangya could even understand why his predecessors had thrown themselves, one after another, into the cause of restoring the Wei Empire.

‘The Qi Emperor shattered our nation and burned its records three times. Aside from what our Chongzhou Cui clan managed to preserve overseas… everything else has been ground to dust. Few people remember the Oath of Xixiao now… but…’

‘But while everyone else in the world might forget the oath sworn by those two great figures back then, there is one thing that surely remembers it with perfect clarity.’

‘The Bright Yang Fruition Attainment!’

Just as Cui Yan had sworn—may the radiance strike them down—it was a pact between an Imperial Monarch and a True Monarch. Without this radiance hanging over their heads, no matter how virtuous the Cui family's traditions were, they could never have produced generation after generation of loyal and respectful members, each willing to forget life and death for the sake of the people.

The Oath of Xixiao no longer held much binding power, but it remained a glimmer of hope for the Cui family. Those who cultivated other Daoist Traditions might have it easier, but he, Yangya, cultivated the Bright Yang path. Though he might laughingly dismiss the oath as meaningless on a normal day, faced with the White Qilin now, he couldn't help but hesitate.

‘Who knows if he carries the attention of Bright Yang? Who knows what aspect of Bright Yang he represents?’

Caught in this web of conflict, he could only stand rigidly to the side, not daring to leave nor daring to speak. He bowed slightly, standing as still as a statue, waiting in silence.

Li Zhouwei, however, had no time for him. Acting as if he were alone, he untied the Radiant Sun King's Halberd from his waist and set to work on the array formation. As time passed, the white light enveloping the area grew visibly weaker, decaying at an astonishing rate. A single strike from the halberd shattered the light completely.

He flicked his sleeves, sweeping up everything on the platform in a whirlwind. A quick scan of his spiritual sense told him that the side hall had already been looted. He spared a glance at Yangya, who stood by, bowing in attendance, and then, without a word, stepped onto a beam of light and departed.

This simple act felt like salvation. A cold sweat broke out on Yangya’s back, followed by a sudden sense of relief. He hastily summoned a gust of wind and took to the air. The panic in his heart dissipated, leaving only a hollow aftershock of fear and a tangled mess of emotions. Without looking back, he flew into the distance, a sense of confusion overwhelming him.

‘Can my Cui clan truly escape this… Does any of it still have meaning? If every appearance of the Wei-Li requires a Cui to be sacrificed, will my turn be today?’

‘But if I stay out of it… does that mean… the sacrifices of my ancestors were all for nothing…’

His heart was a sea of boundless confusion as he fled in disarray, soaring through the vast, empty sky. A chill ran through him, and a doubt began to form:

"Is this a curse passed down from one generation to the next, or a temptation that repeats time and again? Did my Cui ancestors forget life and death generation after generation out of loyalty, or because each one of them wanted to be the protagonist of the Oath of Xixiao?"

---

"Clang!"

A roiling storm of True Fire churned through the mountains, sweeping through a verdant palace. A cultivator in golden robes stood quietly within the hall. The swirling True Fire brushed past his sleeves and crashed into the grand hall with a deafening roar.

The golden-robed man drew back his sleeve. On the other side, a Daoist Master, scorched by the flames, took a slight step back, his expression grim. He summoned True Qi of water and fire to block the flames while lowering his gaze.

"Fellow Daoist Shilou, you are being far too discourteous!" he said in a low voice.

Shilou Yingge’s face was impassive. The divine ability in his hands showed no courtesy whatsoever, bathing him in a light that made him resemble a True Fire crucible. The light radiated outwards, transforming into a thousand streams that shot toward the man before him. "Daoist Master Lin, you jest," he said casually. "This is hardly the time for pleasantries!"

As he spoke, his gaze swept silently across the sky.

The multicolored lights in the heavens were becoming increasingly sparse.

The number of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators gathered here was the greatest in a century, far surpassing the gathering at Anhuai Heaven back then. No matter how vast this mountain range was, it was like a child’s playground to them, carved up in an instant.

Meanwhile, the battle between the few Great Daoist Masters at the center grew ever more intense. The entire sky thundered with their clashes. Several Daoist pagodas had already collapsed. The Spiritual Treasures had all found their owners, yet the combatants refused to stop, fighting with relish as if determined to prove who was superior.

More critically, as the Dharma Treasures were gradually raised and their powers activated, the sealing and containing force of this place grew stronger. Those who had obtained treasures fled in haste, while those who hadn't grew uneasy, preferring to give chase rather than linger in this dangerous place.

Surrounding the mountain range was an endless sea of skeletons, which still held many valuable items… even remnants of Daoist Traditions. Naturally, these could not be missed.

The majority of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, having gained enough, immediately reined in their greed and scattered in all directions, preparing to leave the grotto-heaven.

‘Those who remain here fighting… are mostly mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators…’

He withdrew his gaze, his eyes sweeping over the jade platform at the very center. He frowned inwardly, the True Fire surging from his body growing fiercer. Suddenly, his eyebrows shot up. A crimson-gold light flared in his hand as he sneered, "Fellow Daoist, you’ve been waiting a long time!"

Sure enough, clouds churned and a streak of black light descended from the sky, heading straight for the jade platform. It was intercepted by the crimson-gold light, which erupted into dark clouds and flickering black radiance.

Only then did Shilou Yingge’s expression change slightly.

"The Shamanic Talisman Dao?"

The roiling black qi dissipated, and a figure materialized from thin air. He was tall and thin, with a sallow complexion, dressed in black robes and black boots. A crimson dot adorned the space between his brows, and he held a jade tablet in his hand.

Daoist Master Lin blinked, a smile playing on his lips that was half mockery and half curiosity.

"And who might this be, daring to block the path of us King-Marquises from the northern noble houses!"

The man did not speak. He simply smiled, and a voice resonated in everyone's ears.

"Southern Songzhou Luoshe, Jiao Zhongzi!"

"What audacity!"

Shilou Yingge had certainly heard of the Southern Songzhou Luoshe. The name of Dilu Tian Sanglin was not insignificant; he was considered a rare pillar of the Shamanic Talisman Dao after Duanmu Kui. But however formidable Dilu Tian Sanglin might be, a single glance told Shilou Yingge that the man before him did not possess a particularly high level of divine ability. He sneered.

But Jiao Zhongzi’s eyes merely lit up, and a dense, overlapping wave of brownish-red flames erupted from between his brows and descended in an instant!

Shaoshang Minister Fire

Daoist Master Lin did not let this brief delay go to waste. Though he appeared to stand still, his divine ability had already flown out. A brilliant light flared, only to be suppressed by a dim, heavy radiance that descended upon it. A short, stout man materialized—it was Murong Yan.

"Daoist Master Lin! Long time no see!"

Murong Yan was the same short, stout figure as before, as if his recent hardships had left no trace on him. He laughed heartily as his Valley Water divine ability descended, pinning his opponent in place.

"Colluding with evil!"

Daoist Master Lin snorted, showing little surprise.

Despite Murong Yan's timely appearance, there was no trace of joy on Shilou Yingge’s face. Instead, he erupted in flames. In the sky, colorful clouds were already churning, Heavenly Light appeared, and a celestial gate abruptly plummeted downward!

Audience with the Celestial Gate

This divine ability was so iconic that everyone reacted instantly.

‘Li Zhouwei!’

Everyone froze for a moment. Shilou Yingge’s expression was calm, but his eyes turned sharp and resolute.

‘He’s finally here!’

Daoist Master Lin raised an eyebrow, his expression the most placid of the group. He was clearly aware of the grudges between them and adopted the attitude of a spectator watching a good show. Jiao Zhongzi, riding his black qi, had a speculative look on his face, a hint of anticipation in his eyes.

Only the short, stout Murong Yan’s expression had completely changed. The eager, playful demeanor was gone, replaced in an instant by a deep, haze. His eyes, filled with suspicion, stared grimly at the sky.

‘Li Zhouwei… Li Zhouwei!’

He, Murong Yan, was no fool. He had his own backers within the Murong family. The perilous situation at the riverbank had been a rude awakening. After several discussions, he had gradually come to understand his own predicament.

Now, seeing Li Zhouwei, his mind was a storm of countless suspicions.

But regardless of their thoughts, Jiao Zhongzi was intent on restraining Shilou Yingge, and Murong Yan wanted nothing to do with Li Zhouwei. For a moment, they checked each other, allowing the Audience with the Celestial Gate to crash down.

"Boom!"

A violent surge of divine abilities created a terrifying storm of spiritual energy. The Profound Foundation of the grotto-heaven was already failing, the formations growing weaker by the second. The jade platform, trembling in the storm, could no longer hold and shattered with a resounding bang!

This was precisely Li Zhouwei’s plan!

Their divine abilities were clashing, and all of them were powerful. With Murong Yan and Shilou Yingge in cahoots, it would be difficult to seize the prize directly. It was better to let them restrain each other, release the contents, and snatch them amidst the chaos.

Just as planned, the white light instantly shattered, and six streams of golden light shot out!

"What a pity…"

A wave of regret washed over Shilou Yingge, but the divine ability in his hands did not slow in the slightest. His golden robes billowed as crimson-gold True Fire erupted around his body.

Pheasant Li March!

The rolling light of shamanic arts dissipated. The True Fire bound a streak of golden light and pulled it into his palm. Shilou Yingge narrowed his eyes. In his hand was a jade slip with golden patterns, emitting a faint glow.

‘Only one-sixth…’

Shilou Yingge felt little joy. He knew there was no chance of seizing the other pieces. He turned, his gaze falling upon the golden-eyed youth not far away, who also held a stream of golden light.

Their gazes met silently in mid-air.

Two streams of light, one gold and one red, leaped into the sky, streaking across the grotto-heaven's expanse at a terrifying speed. They created a sharp sonic boom, covering an unknown distance in an instant. Countless scenes blurred past as the lights streaked through the air, finally coming to a simultaneous halt.

"Boom!"

In that instant, a dense, crimson-gold True Fire swirled across the sky, turning it into a sea of flames.

The crimson-gold True Fire surged forth, instantly filling their vision. A hand, as fair as jade, pierced through the fire. In its palm, four small, crimson swords with Profound Spiritual Patterns danced and spun, their reflections captured in Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes.

Rising to meet them was the bright, white glint of a long halberd.

"Clang! Clang! Clang…"

The Grand Ascension danced. Its bright golden body and the illusory, pure gold phantom of its Attachment ability flickered in and out of existence. In a flash, it clashed with the four crimson swords a hundred times. Intense Heavenly Light and True Fire exploded outwards. The four swords leaped back into Shilou Yingge's sleeve. The man's figure became ethereal, his eyes cold.

Pheasant Li March!

With the divine ability operating at full power, over a hundred phantoms of the True Fire Pheasant Li emerged from his body, transforming into a hundred versions of Shilou Yingge within the roiling sea of fire. The eyes of these Pheasant Li phantoms lit up in unison as they formed a hand seal before their chests.

"Light of the Profound Garrison!"

The transition from divine ability to spell art was seamless, without a moment's pause. This move alone revealed Shilou Yingge’s mastery over True Fire.

The hundred streams of True Fire light erupted, giving birth to Li Fire beneath their glow. They swept across the sky. But Li Zhouwei simply gave a light toss, sending out a streak of cyan light.

The cyan light grew as it flew, transforming into a square, cyan cauldron. The patterns of a black bird on its surface suddenly brightened, releasing a powerful suction force that drew in all the True Fire light and locked it away.

Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron!

Li Zhouwei hovered in the air, radiating Heavenly Light, completely unharmed by the roiling Li Fire. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light between his brows shot out like a golden blade of light spanning the horizon, sweeping through and annihilating the numerous phantoms.

"Clang!"

Amidst the surging Li Fire, four crimson swords suddenly appeared beside him. Shilou Yingge had materialized from within the flames!

But there was no surprise in those golden eyes. Li Zhouwei had already raised his hand, reaching into the fire as if he had calculated the exact moment. He clamped down on Shilou Yingge's incoming hand. His five fingers squeezed with sudden force, producing a creaking sound. Between his brows, darkness grew within the light, covering the entire circle. The omen of a solar eclipse had appeared.

But Shilou Yingge’s gaze was sharp, fixed directly on him. His True Fire had already been converted to Li Fire. The red in his pupils suddenly expanded, revealing a scene of a broken profound pillar.

"Boom!"

In the next instant, a dense barrage of black and gold Emperor Qi's Light erupted, engulfing the golden-robed man before him, piercing through his chest and shins, and setting off explosions of Li Fire.

Li Zhouwei’s eyes shifted slightly, a doubt rising in his heart.

‘Something’s not right…’

He leaped up abruptly. Streaks of multicolored light appeared in the sky. Heavenly Light shone down, transforming into layers of celestial gates that descended.

"Bang!"

The Shilou Yingge before him exploded with a deafening roar. A wave of pure True Fire energy swept out, pushing back the Audience with the Celestial Gate several meters. As the shockwave spread, the four crimson swords flew back, and Shilou Yingge reappeared above the celestial gates.

The man's golden robes had now transformed into a crimson-gold Daoist robe. His eyes had turned a bright red, and a crimson, circular halo materialized behind his head. Endless True Fire enveloped him, forming distorted patterns in the air, making him look like a True Fire deity.

Li Zhouwei stood amidst the radiating Heavenly Light, the Audience with the Celestial Gate blocking all the True Fire. The Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron in the sky, filled with dharma power, transformed into white qi and poured down over him. His halberd held the crimson swords at bay, his pupils flashing with a strange light.

‘Still Pheasant Li March… What a formidable divine ability!’

Despite his admiration, he keenly perceived his opponent's stagnation. The technique was indeed powerful, but escaping from the Emperor Qi's Light, while seemingly impressive, had left him unable to regulate his breath for a moment.

Thus, the golden light between Li Zhouwei's brows grew brighter. Scale-like, profound patterns began to creep across his face, covering it. Sovereign's Perilous Tread was already operating at its absolute peak.

"Clang!"

The halberd broke through the blockade, scattering the four crimson swords, and thrust through the True Fire toward Shilou Yingge’s heart.

‘Such a forceful divine ability!’

Shilou Yingge’s Pheasant Li March, operating at full power and augmented by other buffs, was incredibly potent. An ordinary cultivator's dharma body would be seared upon contact, and even a cultivator who had mastered a Body Divine Ability couldn't ignore it so easily.

Seeing that Li Zhouwei had seen through his weakness and was charging in for the kill, he brought two fingers together and pushed forward. A flame of True Fire immediately rained down.

Shilou Yingge’s Dao-Profundity was high, and his Spiritual Artifacts were excellent. For years, he had only needed to focus on cultivation, unlike someone like Helian Wujiang, who had to run around for the sake of his clan. His strength was already a cut above… more importantly, his understanding of Bright Yang far surpassed Helian Wujiang's.

Helian Wujiang’s golden light was purely for bewilderment and immobilization, lacking any additional power. Furthermore, it was a demonic art filled with baleful energy, completely countered by him, rendering it ineffective. But Shilou Yingge’s True Fire flame, while possessing a bewildering effect, was primarily a tangible fusion of light and baleful energy, and it landed precisely on him.

The light of Sovereign's Perilous Tread rose as expected, sweeping away the bewildering aspect of the divine ability. But the rolling baleful light followed close behind, landing on him and halting his charge.

Li Zhouwei had already gained insights into the mysteries of Sovereign's Perilous Tread when they were fighting over the Li Fire Spiritual Treasure. Now, he was not surprised at all. The halberd thrust forward, stabbing out with a speed that still slightly startled Shilou Yingge. He hastily recalled his crimson swords, sighing inwardly.

‘I can’t hold back anymore!’

He opened his mouth slightly. A brilliant light shone from his throat. The dharma power he had been nurturing in his dantian for nearly a century burst forth, flashing rapidly in the air. An intense Supreme Yang radiance swiftly spread across the heavens, overpowering both the True Fire and the Heavenly Light.

Supreme Yang Leveling Profound Light!

"Om…"

The brilliant color of the sun instantly enveloped the world. The terrifying power of the first and most manifest phenomenon of the day was revealed without a doubt. The searing light descended, crashing against Li Zhouwei with a clang and sending him plummeting into the clouds like a falling star.

"Boom!"

A massive column of Supreme Yang light rose from the ground, kicking up a storm of bright white energy. The colorful clouds and Heavenly Light in the sky scattered, and the cloud layer receded, forming a huge, empty circle.

Shilou Yingge’s face was pale. He took two deep breaths to recover from the massive expenditure of dharma power, his gaze falling grimly on the storm below the clouds.

‘There’s no Bright Yang color… Sovereign's Perilous Tread is unyielding. That blow wasn't enough to severely injure him. I'll need to hit him one or two more times.’

But the moment that thought crossed Shilou Yingge's mind, his vision suddenly blurred, as if a Spiritual Sword had pierced his mind and was twisting relentlessly.

Intense pain flooded his spiritual sense. He tried to open his eyes, but all sorts of golden lights viciously bored into them, nearly making him cry out in pain.

"Not good!"

Alarmed, Shilou Yingge forced his eyes open. He poured his divine ability into them, and only then could he make out something through the chaotic golden light.

It was a pair of golden, profound rings.

The rings were no thicker than a finger and looked unremarkable, but they faintly emanated a platinum-colored light, constantly shaking as they sped toward him, growing rapidly larger in his vision.

‘A Spiritual Treasure!’
