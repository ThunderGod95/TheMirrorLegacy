# Chapter 1176: The Art of Demoting Yin

After hearing this, Li Ximing considered it for a moment. "It's just that the Wu Light in your body was only just expelled. If you go out rashly, the calamitous energies might sense it and flare up again."

Li Zhouwei shook his head. "That won't be an issue. I won't travel far, nor will I make a move. I simply have a premonition I need to verify. Grand-Uncle, please wait a moment."

Li Ximing's heart was put at ease. He withdrew his divine ability and fell back behind the gauze curtain, dissolving into a patch of white light amid the fading splendor of the rapidly departing Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. When Li Zhouwei turned around, the pitch-black great hall had already materialized before him.

In that instant, he clearly felt a dense surge of Wu Light emerge from his entire body, rising with ever-increasing speed, threatening to swarm up through his injuries.

‘Crimson Severing Arrowhead!’

A ring like a dying sun immediately appeared behind him, wreathed in wisps of darkness that swirled like desert sand. Coupled with the Sun-Surging Governing Stars that suddenly lit up between his brows, the advance of the Wu Light visibly slowed.

Li Zhouwei took a moment to gauge the situation and made an estimate.

‘With the combined power of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead, the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, and the Huai River Map, as long as I don't engage an enemy, the growth of the Wu Light is within an acceptable range. For every six hours spent in the outside world, I'll only need to return to this realm for fifteen minutes to recuperate.’

After all, he was borrowing the Profound Vastness Art to expel the Wu Light, and every bit of effort consumed a portion of his vital pure qi. Wasting no time, Li Zhouwei took a step forward, crossing the boundless Great Void to arrive in a simple cave-abose.

A young man was lost in thought, his head bowed. Hearing the disturbance, he raised his head sharply, only to be so stunned by the sight before him that he shot to his feet, his pupils constricting.

He couldn't be blamed. The King of Wei's appearance was simply horrifying.

The thick, multicolored light that had once enveloped him was gone, replaced by a dense web of black cracks that made his form even more terrifying. His once-brilliant golden eyes had become pools of shattered black. Standing there in the great hall, he looked like a specter from the underworld.

Li Suining had lived through two lives but had never seen Li Zhouwei in such a state. He was thoroughly frightened and scrambled from his seat, bowing low.

"This junior has disturbed Your Majesty's seclusion. My crime is unforgivable."

Li Zhouwei waved a hand dismissively and smiled.

"By killing Qi Lanyan, I'm afraid I've upset the plans of quite a few factions."

Li Suining could only offer his congratulations.

"With this, there is at least one less figure deliberately targeting our Bright Yang lineage. Especially in these rare days of peace, we can finally breathe a sigh of relief… We no longer need to worry about being targeted by the north."

Li Zhouwei paced forward.

"Is there still conflict in the Jianghuai region?"

Li Suining considered this for a moment.

"If there are no other major upheavals, there should be one more tribulation to come!"

Li Zhouwei fell into deep thought, but Li Suining's focus was not on the grander situation.

"My lord, your injuries… they will not be easy to handle. I wonder… have any arrangements been made?"

The King of Wei took the main seat and nodded.

"I am considering that very matter."

He spoke concisely, relaying all the recent developments, including the Chunyi Dao Gate's suggestions and Li Ximing's own thoughts, ensuring the young man understood the full picture before speaking in a graver tone.

"Ultimately, this is a problem of spiritual materials and resources. The cost is immense, and Daoist Master Zhaojing is not confident. If we were to fail a few times at this critical juncture, both the grand formation and the mystic realm would be pushed off indefinitely."

It was clear that although the King of Wei hadn't mentioned them, the matters of the formation and the mystic realm weighed heavily on his mind. The issue wasn't that the Li family couldn't afford the pill, but that they had very little room for error.

He paused, then said quietly, "I have a way to suppress the Wu Light that won't interfere with my healing or cultivation. In my opinion, it's better to postpone this for now. The matter of my tribulation can wait… The reason I'm hesitating is that I'm waiting for the reward from the Song court."

Li Zhouwei had considered everything thoroughly, but his words put Li Suining in a difficult position.

‘Qi Lanyan's death was like removing a thorn from our side, but it's completely disrupted our original plans. The reward from the Song court is bound to change as well!’

If it were a matter of secret arts or Daoist scriptures, Li Suining might have had something to contribute, but he couldn't conjure spiritual resources from thin air. He was at a loss for words. Seeing no other solution, he wrestled with himself for a moment.

‘I suppose I can give him the Han family's secret art. It might be helpful.’

After a brief hesitation, Li Suining cupped his hands.

"This junior has one more technique I wish to offer to Your Majesty!"

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei's eyes narrowed with interest.

Li Suining began, "This art is called the Elucidating Profundity Bestowed Jade Method!"

Li Zhouwei's expression flickered.

‘The Elucidating Profundity Bestowed Jade Method? A Supreme Yin technique from the Chunyi Dao Gate!’

This was no obscure art. When Li Ximing had visited Chunyi Island, he had heard a Daoist Master from the Chunyi Dao Gate mention this very technique. It was an esoteric secret of the Supreme Yin Dao Lineage, an ancient art on par with their own Intercalary Sun Art!

His heart jolted. After a moment of careful consideration, he realized it wasn't so surprising. A strange thought surfaced in the King of Wei's mind, and he asked, "An art of Supreme Yin generation and transformation?"

The words caught Li Suining off guard, leaving him stunned for a moment. He mulled them over and found they made a certain sense.

Li Zhouwei said, "Don't overthink it. Just tell me what you know."

Before him, after all, was the King of Wei, a man feared by Daoist Masters of both the north and south. Despite their closeness, it was difficult for Li Suining to be completely at ease. He chose his words carefully.

"The Elucidating Profundity Bestowed Jade Method was anciently known as the 'Seeking Profundity Bestowed Jade Method.' It came into being when the Three Profoundities were first taught. There were eight similar arts, known collectively as the 'Eight Seekings'."

"Two of them were lost in the earliest days. The remaining six were annotated in great detail and compiled several times, eventually being organized into a single volume by the disciples of True Monarch Yuanxia. It was then that 'Seeking' was changed to 'Elucidating.' Ancient cultivators referred to them collectively as the Six Elucidations…"

These were secrets from high antiquity. In his past life, the Han family from whom he had borrowed a secret art were descendants of True Monarch Yuanxia, which was why Li Suining was so knowledgeable on the matter. He continued smoothly,

"The Six Elucidations are divided into 'Elucidating Transformation,' 'Elucidating Profundity,' and 'Elucidating Removal.' Each category contains a yin and a yang art, for a total of three yin and three yang, each pair corresponding to the other…"

‘So it’s an art of such ancient origins… No wonder! No wonder!’

An unusual light rippled in Li Zhouwei's eyes. He smiled.

"What is the true name of the Intercalary Sun Art our family possesses?"

Li Suining gave a wry smile.

"It is the Elucidation of Chongyuan's Supplemental Law… Its counterpart is the Elucidating Transformation Na Yuan Intercalary Method."

The Li clan had possessed this immortal art for over a century, yet only today learned its true name. Li Zhouwei couldn't help but nod, his expression turning serious.

"The names are quite revealing. The Intercalary Sun Art involves a transformation between fires, hence 'Intercalary.' The Elucidating Profundity Bestowed Jade Method, on the other hand, transforms a top-tier Supreme Yin into a lesser one, hence 'Demote.' The Chunyi Dao Gate puts it elegantly, calling it the Dao of generation and transformation, but in truth, such a wasteful act was considered improper even by ancient cultivators. This 'demote'… it means to depose… By that logic, we could call it the Art of Demoting Yin."

"‘Within this lies the Dao of derivation, the work of transmutation.’ This saying is clear and concise, striking at the very heart of the Great Dao!"

Understanding its origin and function, Li Zhouwei's profound Dao-Profundity allowed him to grasp the place of these two arts in an instant. Hearing this, Li Suining sighed with emotion and took a jade slip from his sleeve, presenting it with both hands.

"My lord, please examine it!"

Li Zhouwei took it. With a turn, he committed the vast ocean of techniques within to memory. Then, with a flick of his finger, the simple white jade slip shattered into dust.

A look of deep understanding had already dawned on his face. He strode urgently toward the exit of the cave dwelling, stepping into the Great Void, then turned his head back with a smile.

"Our family's 'Whole Pill'… any idea when she will return?"

A smile touched Li Suining's lips as he replied formally,

"Though the Nine Mounds are distant, her divine ability is not. Riding her form through the Great Void, it should take no more than a month."

"Good."

Li Zhouwei laughed heartily and stepped back into the pitch-black great hall. With one more step, the darkness receded as the light of the sun and moon shone down from all directions.

The moment he entered the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, the Wu Light in his body lost its source and subsided within a few breaths. Li Ximing rose to greet him. Li Zhouwei produced a pale purple jade slip from his sleeve and smiled.

"Grand-Uncle, please take a look!"

Li Ximing took it and closed his eyes to read its contents. When he opened them again, he was completely shaken, as if in a dream. He stared blankly.

"The Elucidating Profundity Bestowed Jade Method?"

He raised an eyebrow in disbelief.

‘He went out for one trip and came back with the highest scripture of the Chunyi Dao Gate?!’

The shock prompted Li Ximing to read it twice more, feeling the incredibly profound words of the Great Dao within. He listened to Li Zhouwei's brief explanation, committing it to memory while his mind raced.

"I've given it a quick look," he said. "This process of 'demoting' is no simple matter. But compared to the Intercalary Sun Art, its advantage is that in most cases, it doesn't require auxiliary spiritual resources!"

"Because of that, it can only transform relatively good spiritual resources, objects, and Spiritual Qi into relatively inferior ones. It's impossible to even convert them into something of the same grade!"

"Wait… Spiritual Qi?!"

As he considered this, a chill of both shock and elation shot through his mind.

"With this Art of Demoting Yin, we could transform the virtually limitless Supreme Yin Moon Radiance… into all kinds of other Supreme Yin Spiritual Qi!"

"Exactly." Li Zhouwei nodded, a thoughtful expression on his face. Amid his joy, Li Ximing also realized the catch. He couldn't help but ask,

"A pity… in the end, it’s still not a spiritual item."

Li Zhouwei knew what he meant.

In the outside world, the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance was a supreme and precious treasure. But within the Li family, its status was unique. As a form of ultimate Supreme Yin Spiritual Qi, it was useful, but not exceptionally so.

The reason for this all came down to the nature of Spiritual Qi itself.

In the current age, Spiritual Qi was intrinsically tied to the methods used to gather it; the rise or fall of a Dao lineage could depend on it. Yet Spiritual Qi itself occupied a very strange position.

‘The highest forms have a station that approaches that of spiritual items, and are even treated as such. The lowest forms are worthless. Yet all of it can manifest from spiritual providence out of thin air. A low-level cultivator could gather qi for years and still be unable to tell the difference… Even those who have attained a divine ability and can judge the value of Spiritual Qi have little true understanding of its fundamental nature.’

But for someone of Li Zhouwei's Dao-Profundity, the matter was as clear as day.

"All transcendent things in the mortal world are governed by the principle of the life-mandate. This is composed of intrinsic nature and inherent station. Nature is its substance, while station is its position. That is why they are called spiritual items. When you break it down, the Spiritual Qi, spiritual resources, and spiritual items that cultivators speak of all possess this life-mandate."

"For spiritual items and resources, their life-mandates are mostly complete, differing only in degree. That is why they can be used directly in refining pills and artifacts. But the so-called act of 'gathering qi'—whether it's 'watching pines and treading snow' or 'drawing from desert bloodsands'—is, in reality, the act of gathering station, of gathering all sorts of imagery. The Spiritual Qi itself… is merely the vessel that carries that station and imagery."

Having studied the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art, Li Ximing was no stranger to the theory of the life-mandate. Hearing this, he compared it to his memories of the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance and frowned. Just as he was about to speak, Li Zhouwei continued.

"But lesser cultivators are incapable of gathering station from nothing. In all the years of our family's history, the only thing I have ever seen that possesses station without substance is the Supreme Yin qi within this Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance!"

"After ten years of gathering qi, even if one were gathering empty qi, they would still end up with something. Therefore, the Spiritual Qi that cultivators gather year after year actually contains a portion of 'dharma-nature'—the part that can be consumed for cultivation—which acts as a carrier for its station. And certain types of Spiritual Qi, due to the different techniques used to gather them, have a more abundant dharma-nature, so much so that they can be used via special means to nourish the body or even refine pills!"

"My 'Golden Sun Brilliant Primal' back then was extremely difficult to collect. Once gathered, it settled in its container like a liquid. That was a type of Spiritual Qi with an exceedingly high dharma-nature."

"This is why some Spiritual Qi is called Yin-Leap Qi, some is called Bright Parting Blazing Essence, and others are called Golden Sun Brilliant Primal. 'Essence,' 'Primal,' 'Qi'… these were the secret classifications used by ancient cultivators!"

Li Zhouwei had laid it all bare. How could Li Ximing not understand? In a flash of insight, it all clicked into place.

"Yin-Leap Qi…"

The Azure Step Flawless Pill he had obtained from the Chunyi Dao Gate required a type of Spiritual Qi as its sovereign ingredient! Li Ximing's profound mastery of the Dao of Pills finally resolved his last lingering doubt.

"The reason Yin-Leap Qi can be used as a sovereign ingredient is because its intrinsic nature is so abundant that it can take the place of a spiritual resource. And the reason I felt the recipe for the Azure Step Flawless Pill was so simple is because the formula was designed for the Yin-Leap Qi to provide the station, while the other numerous spiritual items provide the spiritual providence!"

Li Zhouwei's gaze was scorching as he seamlessly continued, "And we have Supreme Yin Moon Radiance."

Excitement flared in Li Ximing's eyes. The King of Wei's own voice trembled slightly.

"The Supreme Yin Moon Radiance is already the absolute highest grade of Supreme Yin Spiritual Qi in the mortal realm. This is equivalent to holding all other forms of Supreme Yin Spiritual Qi in our hands. So… does that mean we possess a massive, endless supply of something like Yin-Leap Qi, something whose life-mandate approaches that of a true spiritual resource?"

"Or," Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes, "perhaps there is another type of Spiritual Qi, one with even more spiritual providence than Yin-Leap Qi, one so potent it could be considered equivalent to a spiritual resource… just waiting for us to discover it."

"A massive supply of Supreme Yin spiritual resources?!"

Li Ximing took a deep breath. Li Zhouwei smiled.

"Since this type of Spiritual Qi would be equivalent to a spiritual resource in its life-mandate, why couldn't we treat it as such, and then use the Elucidating Profundity Bestowed Jade Method to transform it into… other spiritual resources?"

"I know this will be exceedingly difficult… but Que'Wan is about to break through. Without this art, she would be helpless against the Supreme Yin. But now that we have the method, 'Whole Pill' is the one most skilled at inducing such material transformations!"

The audacious idea made Li Ximing draw a sharp, silent breath. But Li Zhouwei wasn't finished. His voice dropped lower.

"And even if we cannot find a Spiritual Qi whose life-mandate can rival a spiritual resource… or if such a thing simply doesn't exist… Grand-Uncle, do you remember? We have five portions of something whose life-mandate is comparable to a top-tier Supreme Yin spiritual item, whose preciousness utterly dwarfs that of the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance…"

"The Final-Tower Sinking Primal."
