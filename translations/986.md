# Chapter 986: Dividing the Spoils

Within the ice cavern, frost and snow clung to the walls.

Daoist Master Tianwan stood silently in the center, her fingers performing divinations while her gaze remained heavy.

'The final path... "Boundless Expanse"... This is the only road left. If this path also leads nowhere, my only option is to attempt the Leap Path...'

The Cold Qi dao lineage wasn't exactly dying out; it's practiced throughout the world. But that makes it even more vexing than a fading lineage. Even those obscure, incredibly difficult dao lineages grant their practitioners a place in the world once mastered...

'But it just had to be Cold Qi! Since ancient times, it has been manipulated by Immortal Lords, reduced to a mere supplement for the Supreme Yin and Lesser Yin. In those days, almost no one was willing to practice it. The only ones who did were ancient cultivators of Lesser Yin, or even Supreme Yin, who, upon failing to break through to a higher realm, felt their Dao-Profundity was lacking and saw no hope in reincarnation. Only then would they turn to Cold Qi... And even after successfully forming a Golden Core, they were still forced to serve the powerful cultivators of the Three Yin Daos.'

She knew her own situation best. After so many years of cultivation, Tianwan had gathered a great deal of information. At its peak, the Cold Qi dao lineage had at least four "Lesser Yin Leaps," all of which only served to push Cold Qi further down this dead-end path.

The further one progressed in this dao, the more hopeless it became. The "Lesser Yin Leap-Cold" path had somehow become the orthodoxy, while the true Cold Qi dao grew weaker and weaker. Even if this made Cold Qi easier to practice at the start, whenever Tianwan looked to her future, she was filled with despair.

'One's Dao path... it determines the rest of one's life...'

As she was lost in thought, a jade pendant hidden in her white sleeve suddenly grew warm. Tianwan paused, her expression turning complex as she sneered inwardly. 'So, it's him. Zhang Yige is making his move.'

At that exact moment, a tremor ran through the Great Void. A streak of brilliance flew out and landed in the ice cavern, resolving into the figure of a man. He was only at the Foundation Establishment Realm, yet he was draped in opulent white-gold dharma robes that shimmered with flowing light. A sword hung from his waist, alongside a collection of jade talismans, precious pearls, a wooden flute, and a ceramic vase. The various trinkets clinked together with every movement—a picture of utter extravagance.

It was none other than Li Quantao! Having secured the hidden cache, he was absolutely euphoric, riding a wave of triumph. His ordinary features seemed handsome beneath his splendid attire, and his face was flushed with high spirits and unrestrained joy.

But as soon as Li Quantao looked up, his expression froze solid.

Daoist Master Tianwan's eyes were narrowed, her gaze burning into him. It felt like a hammer blow to his skull. A wave of terror so potent it stung his nose washed over him, and his vision swam. With a heavy _thud_, he dropped to his knees.

"Gr-Greetings, Great Daoist Master!"

Li Quantao had been tempered in the sect; he wasn't a fool. A Great Daoist Master personally waiting here... what could it be for? It certainly wasn't because she saw his profound fortune and wanted to take him as a disciple.

'Tossing him into a pill furnace, on the other hand... that seemed far more likely.'

Li Quantao pressed his forehead to the ice, trembling uncontrollably. All traces of his earlier triumph had vanished. The only sound was the crisp _clink-clink_ of the expensive baubles at his waist tapping against the frozen floor.

He was scared witless. Tianwan remained motionless, standing with her arms crossed. Suddenly, he saw a man in a blue, profoundly-patterned daoist robe standing silently beside him with a smile. The man had a vermilion dot between his brows and the Black Cloud Silver Sparrow Bottle hung at his waist. He hauled Li Quantao to his feet and remarked:

"What a lucky fellow you are!"

'Another Purple Mansion Realm expert!'

Li Quantao instantly understood. He was, in all likelihood, a dead man. His heart went cold. The Daoist Master before him gave him a light pat on the back, and a surge of divine ability and dharma power instantly flooded his entire body, rushing up into his throat.

_Shhh-clatter..._

All the treasures he had stuffed into his robes and the storage bags hanging from his waist ripped away from his body, taking the splendid robes with them. One moment, Li Quantao was the picture of wealth and success; the next, he was left in a single thin under-robe, collapsing back to his knees in the snow with a _thump_.

His throat ached. He whimpered twice and couldn't stop coughing, gagging as if to vomit, but nothing came up. In an instant, his heart felt utterly hollow. Misery welled up inside him, but he didn't dare let a single tear fall.

"He doesn't seem to have swallowed anything valuable."

Daoist Master Xuanyi glanced at Tianwan's expression and offered this brief defense for Li Quantao. The cold words, however, only made him more terrified. He shivered, frozen to the spot, until a calm voice descended from above:

"Daoist Friend Qu!"

Bright Heavenly Light shone down, and Li Quantao’s heart instantly filled with burning hope. He cautiously raised his eyes, glancing at the newcomer's robes. He knew it was Li Ximing. A realization dawned on him:

'My life is saved!'

Before he'd left the Mystic Realm, if the ambitious Li Quantao had known that everything would be stolen from him—that not even a single hair would be left—he would have collapsed in grief. Yet now, finding himself in that exact empty-handed state, he felt an irrepressible surge of joy amid his despair.

Tianwan raised an eyebrow. Her gaze swept past Li Ximing and landed on Daoist Master Kuang Yu, who was standing quietly to the side. She showed little surprise. She had also caught the protective undertone in Xuanyi's earlier comment and remained silent.

Seeing Tianwan's silence, Xuanyi let out a quiet sigh of relief and smiled.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, rest assured!"

As the mediator, the last thing he wanted was a fight. He gave a polite smile and emptied the storage bags, creating a mountain of items on the ground. With a flick of his index finger, he plucked one item from the pile.

It was a silver-white jade slip.

Xuanyi smiled. "Senior, please take a look... And there is also this Cold Vase..."

A flash of delight sparked in Tianwan's eyes. Her mood instantly brightened, and her tone softened as she gave a grunt of acknowledgment. She took the jade slip and closed her eyes to inspect it, adopting an air of 'out of sight, out of mind' toward the rest of the proceedings.

Xuanyi broke into a cold sweat. He pushed up his sleeve, picked up the remaining jade talisman, and turned to Li Ximing. "Daoist Friend Zhaojing?"

Everyone had already scanned the pile of items Li Quantao had brought out. The sword was a dharma artifact that had evolved from a spirit embryo, the pearl was a Wall Water Pill, and the wooden flute was merely an ancient dharma artifact. Only the jade talisman and the ceramic vase were true Spiritual Artifacts.

When the Hongxue Sect was wiped out, most of its treasures were on the fallen Purple Mansion Realm expert, Daoist Master Guansue. Finding this much in the Mystic Realm was a testament to the sect's deep reserves.

Li Ximing focused his gaze. The jade talisman was actually an artifact of the Capital Guard Daoist Tradition.

Its aura seemed unstable, however, and its divine ability felt weak, giving it no remarkable presence. Kuang Yu, at his side, glanced at it and sent him a message via divine sense, frowning:

"It's a Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman..."

Li Ximing, however, was quite satisfied. He nodded and accepted it.

Aside from these main items, the rest was a chaotic mess of cultivation manuals and common spiritual materials. It was clear the Hongxue Sect had intended this cache as a fallback, a foundation to rebuild the sect should the worst happen. Sifting through it all, they were fortunate to find a few spiritual resources suitable for the Purple Mansion Realm.

The remaining spiritual resources were divided between Xuanyi and the others. Li Ximing took a Soaring Profound Chaos Stone from the Cultivation Transcendence dao lineage. He glanced at the remaining pile of treasures on the ground and said softly:

"Since none of you have any use for the rest, let him take them."

Tianwan had gotten what she wanted; she couldn't care less about the scraps. She had no intention of doing any favors for Crimson Reef Island, and her own high-level disciples had no use for such low-grade items. She simply dissolved into a flurry of wind and snow and vanished.

Seeing her depart, Xuanyi breathed another sigh of relief. He was happy to play the part of the magnanimous one, smiling at Li Quantao. "My apologies for the rough treatment!"

Only then did Li Quantao dare to rise. He gathered his scattered belongings and picked up the fine robe, but he didn't dare put it back on, merely clutching it to his chest.

Xuanyi had always been amicable, so Li Ximing was perfectly courteous, inviting him up the mountain. The Daoist Master declined with a smile. "Daoist Friend, do you remember Bai Yinzi? He passed away from old age some years ago."

"Oh?"

Back when the True Monarch left and Jiangbei fell into turmoil, his old acquaintance Bai Yinzi had been caught up in it. With little lifespan remaining, he had fallen into Xuanyi's hands and decided to follow him, gambling on a final chance. Li Ximing hadn't expected Xuanyi to bring him up today. "So, he managed to live a few extra years..."

"More than that." Xuanyi smiled faintly and raised his hand. The Black Cloud Silver Sparrow Bottle immediately floated above his palm. A dark light leaped from it, materializing before them. It was, indeed, Bai Yinzi.

Except now, he looked much younger, and his robes bore the same black-cloud-and-silver-sparrow motif as the bottle. Upon seeing Li Ximing, he bowed low and offered a respectful greeting. Li Ximing studied him, his expression one of surprised suspicion.

"This... resembles the path of Buddhist cultivators..."

Xuanyi corrected him seriously, "Not at all. It is an orthodox Immortal Dao, though one rarely seen these days. He now possesses a 'spiritual lifespan' of one or two hundred years. While it's not enough to continue a Dao lineage, his abilities are no less wondrous than when he was alive. He helps me maintain the Spiritual Artifact and refine the baleful light within it. You could say we are helping each other."

The man chuckled, though he still seemed a bit resentful about the topic. "Although the Chunyi Dao Gate dislikes me, and that Sumian fellow would surely disagree... the Eastern Sea is a murky place, true. But this Daoist Tradition is of the Immortal Dao, make no mistake. It has nothing to do with those monks!"

Li Ximing observed him closely, nodding with a smile, though a thread of doubt remained. "If such a miraculous method truly exists, isn't it just a form of life extension in disguise? Even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator on the verge of death... would surely covet such a spiritual lifespan."

Xuanyi nodded. "It is a unique function of my Corner-Cleansing Merit Bottle. It requires someone with a 'heavy' destiny; ordinary people cannot enter it. As for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators... they have already cultivated the Shengyang Acupoint, so my treasure cannot accommodate them. It only works on people like Bai Yinzi."

"I see." Li Ximing's first thought had actually been of Li Xuanxuan. But the old man had received the Talisman Seed; his situation wasn't nearly so simple. He sighed inwardly, exchanged a few more pleasantries with Xuanyi, and saw him off.

'This Xuanyi... he seems quite intent on building a friendship...'

He mused silently. Only Kuang Yu remained, standing nearby with her arms crossed. She looked at him with a hopeful smile. "Daoist Friend... I happen to cultivate Cultivation Transcendence..."

Li Ximing paused. Staring into her blue-purple eyes, he finally understood. He retrieved the jade box from his sleeve and opened it gently. Inside lay a fist-sized, brightly glowing, searing hot spiritual stone.

It was the Soaring Profound Chaos Stone he had just received.

Li Ximing laughed. "So that's why you agreed to come along so readily. I thought you needed my help with something, but it turns out you were just hoping to browse the selection..."

"Now, what kind of talk is that?" Daoist Master Kuang Yu's smile widened, and she blinked, enhancing her charm. "It's just a coincidence that I recently commissioned someone to refine a Spiritual Artifact. And I would never take it for free!"

She was clearly tempted by the resource. She fumbled in her sleeve for a moment, hesitating, before finally saying, "Please hold it for me... What little I had... I've already sunk it all into that Spiritual Artifact. However, Daoist Master Liaoluo of Mount Qusi still owes me some resources. He's sure to come out of the Grotto-Heaven with his bags full. I'll go collect the debt and exchange with you then!"

Li Ximing shook his head with a smile. He was, in fact, interested in building a good relationship, especially since he had just agreed to refine pills for her. He took the Soaring Profound Chaos Stone and placed it in her hand.

"If you need it urgently, just take it. I have no use for Cultivation Transcendence resources anyway. You can take your time finding some Bright Yang resources to pay me back."

"Thank you, Daoist Friend." Kuang Yu looked surprised. She accepted the resource, admiring it with delight for a moment before smiling. "Xinyu will remember this."

Li Ximing had met Kuang Yu a few times and knew her surname was Yin, but this was the first time he'd learned her given name was Xinyu. He offered a few polite words, but Kuang Yu replied with genuine enthusiasm, her expression turning serious.

"While I don't know anything about that resource, I _do_ recognize that Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman. My master used to have one. Its core component is Radiant Heartflame Amber, an artifact of the Capital Guard from the ancient Garrison Profound Dao."

"The Garrison Profound Dao apparently had a method for producing Radiant Heartflame Amber. Their cultivators adored these talismans, often passing them from master to disciple, adding to the set over generations. They were originally meant to be used in sets of three or six to form an array. After their Daoist Tradition was destroyed, the talismans were scattered. A single one, seen occasionally, isn't nearly as useful."

Li Ximing understood immediately. 'According to her, her master also had one. These things are only powerful as a set. Yet she shows no desire to acquire mine, either by trade or other means. Does that mean her master's talisman never passed to her?'

Daoist Master Kuang Yu didn't elaborate. She thanked him again and departed on the wind.

Li Ximing's smile faded. Li Quantao, who had been waiting silently this whole time, hurried forward and kowtowed, tears streaming. "Thank you, Daoist Master, for saving my life!"

Li Ximing shook his head and had him gather his things. He then lifted him with a beam of light and flew toward the lake, asking softly, "Did you manage to keep anything else?"

Li Quantao was sweating profusely, his voice trembling. "Not a single thing! The Mystic Realm was orderly, but it hadn't been maintained. Many of the spiritual items and resources had already lost their Spiritual Qi and degraded... This junior did his best to gather everything that was still intact. I was originally planning to come to the lake to find you, Daoist Master..."

Li Ximing gave a noncommittal grunt. Knowing Li Quantao's personality, and with two Spiritual Artifacts in his possession, who else in the Purple Mansion Realm could he possibly trust? It was very likely he _was_ telling the truth about seeking him out.

He landed on Gardenia Scenery Mountain and began to brew some spiritual tea. Looking at Li Quantao's sweat-soaked figure, he said mildly, "I saved your life this time out of consideration for our connection. Be smarter in the future. When you return to the sect, keep a low profile. As for what happened in the Mystic Realm... I will explain things to Si Yuanli. You won't be troubled."

"Yes..." Li Quantao immediately dropped to his knees and began kowtowing. Li Ximing waved him off with a smile. "Go and see the old master. Let him know you're safe."

"Yes!" Li Quantao understood the unspoken implications. His heart swelled with gratitude, and he truly began to see this senior as his own family elder. He kowtowed several more times before hastily retreating down the mountain.

Li Ximing raised his hand, inspecting the jade talisman. It was about two fingers wide and a little over an inch long. Profound patterns flickered across its surface, saturated with a frosty Cold Qi divine ability—no doubt a remnant left by Daoist Master Guansue.

By his calculations, the Grotto-Heaven wouldn't be open for much longer. He sat cross-legged, suffusing the talisman with Heavenly Light, slowly cleansing the foreign divine ability from within. As he worked, he waited quietly for Li Zhouwei, a knot of anxiety tightening in his chest.

'It doesn't matter what treasures he found... as long as he isn't badly hurt...'

He sat meditating on the mountain, cultivating in silence. An unknown amount of time passed before he finally felt a violent tremor from the Great Void. Powerful ripples spread through the air. He snapped his eyes open and looked to the north.

"So fast!"

The radiance in the Great Void—blue above and white below—grew increasingly intense. Li Ximing was just about to take flight to find Li Zhouwei when he froze.

A torrent of Heavenly Light was already converging on the mountain. A brilliant radiance descended from the sky, resolving into the form of a smiling, golden-eyed young man.

"Minghuang!"

Li Ximing shot to his feet, a wave of joy rising in him. But as he looked closer, his expression immediately twisted with distress.

Although the young man was smiling, faint cracks were visible beneath the golden, scale-like markings on his face. The clothes on his upper body had been completely shredded by some divine ability, revealing a powerful torso.

But his torso was also covered in faint, pale-white fracture lines. Streams of Supreme Yang True Fire surged within these cracks, flowing along the lines of his muscles and emitting a scorching, destructive power that crackled audibly.

Yet, the interweaving Heavenly Light and Supreme Yang True Fire only made him appear as if he had stepped forth from the sun itself, and his smile grew even more radiant.

"Grand-Uncle!" Li Zhouwei's voice was hoarse. The sound made Li Ximing's eyes redden. He could only manage to say, "Good... good..."

Li Zhouwei, however, seemed unfazed. His eyes were full of laughter. The look of suppression he always carried—the look of one who had burdened his family and been forced to humble himself—was finally gone from his golden eyes. In its place was a proud, unrestrained joy as he laughed.

"Grand-Uncle, look!"

He began pulling items from his waist, his storage bag, and even his tattered sleeves—a crackling, purple-gold greatmace; an azure, square profound cauldron covered in flying bird motifs; a Spiritual Treasure Mystic Pill that pulsed with Li Fire and was wreathed in illusions...

Spiritual resources, spiritual materials, Spiritual Artifacts, Spiritual Treasures...

The small jade table was quickly overwhelmed. The items began to pile up on the ground, clattering and clanging, flashing with multicolored light. Li Ximing was left dizzy and dumbfounded by the sheer spectacle.

"Huh?"
