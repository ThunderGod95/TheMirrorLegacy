# Chapter 946: Descendants

Li Ximing stood in the twilight, passing the brocade box from his left hand to his right. He juggled it, finding it surprisingly heavy, yet he had no desire to store it in his sleeve.

He lowered his gaze. "Why in Jiangbei? How could it possibly be in Jiangbei?"

His white-gold Daoist robes fluttered in the dying sun, appearing somewhat dim. He mulled over the words, murmuring, "What if... what if she succeeds?"

The two stared into the distance for a while. Li Zhouwei turned slightly, looking toward Shanji Prefecture. Everything at the Sacred Writ Gate was dark and heavy. Like the Purple Smoke Gate, it was utterly silent. No cultivators were ascending into the sky, and no one was flying west.

The sky darkened rapidly. The two silently descended, returning to the table. A cold wind skimmed across the river. Li Ximing set the brocade box down first, met Li Zhouwei's eyes, and simply sipped his tea.

There had been three breakthrough candidates from the Kong Clan back then. After all this time and all these turns, only Kong Tingyun remained. Everyone had guessed she was in seclusion in the Eastern Sea, some even suspected she was with Xuanyi. There had been no news for so long... but now, it was all clear.

Li Ximing could only let out a breath. "It's in Jiangbei..."

Li Zhouwei, however, stared at the brocade box on the table without a word. His unspoken meaning was clear. The man known as Daoist Master Zhaojing set his cup down, annoyed. "We're already too close."

How long had Li Ximing hoped for Kong Tingyun to break through, to become a Daoist Master and secure the Profound Peak Gate? But the Profound Peak Gate had barely clung to life for all those years before collapsing entirely, feeding the appetites of several families. To be blunt, while the Li Clan had primarily protected the Kong Clan's bloodline, they had also taken a significant share of the spoils. If nothing else, even the formations on the island were from the Kong Clan!

But old friends had withered, and times had changed... Kong Tingyun was no simpleton. How could this ever be explained away?

Seeing Li Zhouwei staring at the box, Li Ximing's earlier joy vanished. The brocade box now felt like a scorching potato... This was an impossible situation.

'The matter with Zhu Gong... at this critical juncture...'

Li Zhouwei glanced at him and poured more tea. "The location is in Jiangbei," he said quietly. "Grand-uncle and I cannot go. Tinglan and Zhu Gong cannot go either... We don't know the specifics. In your judgment, what are her chances?"

Li Ximing shook his head and sighed. "Not low... That old fox Changxi... he's a schemer. To sacrifice Kong Haiying and leave a contingency plan in Jiangbei, he must have had a reason!"

Li Zhouwei said softly, "About Daoist Master Zhu Gong..."

Seeing Li Ximing's bitter expression and his refusal to speak, Li Zhouwei's voice deepened. "We have to save her now!"

Li Ximing's heart clenched. He focused. Li Zhouwei continued, his expression grim.

"If Kong Tingyun succeeds, things will be far from simple. It's true that the Purple Mansion masters sat down together to divide the Profound Peak spoils, but Yehui was the one who played the villain! As long as the truth doesn't get out, the official story—that the Daoist Master was ambushed while protecting the Kong family and fled to the Eastern Sea—is at least passable... We must ask about the great formation. We have to discuss everything with Tinglan. To put it bluntly, compared to Kong Tingyun, we still can't afford to offend the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition."

"Zhu Gong is backed by Tinglan and Houfu. No one is blind. The Profound Peak Dao lineage was carved up by the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, plain for all to see. They must have calculated it was her... If this phenomenon hadn't appeared, me refusing to lend blood wouldn't be a big deal. Tinglan would understand. But now, after this, refusing the blood is... sensitive."

"My family has always been on good terms with the Kong Clan, which already makes us suspect. Daoist Master Zhu Gong will likely just assume we've switched sides and would rather see her dead!"

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes, reflected in the tea, seemed haunting. "Honestly, if she died, she died. It might even be for the best. But a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator is too resilient. She won't die. At worst, she'll lose her dharma-body and flee back to the Eastern Sea... hating our family. That thought alone sends a chill down my spine."

Li Ximing sighed heavily. "And now it has come to this!"

Li Zhouwei turned his cup, his expression grave. "I fear that when Kong Tingyun emerges from seclusion, she will find her sect and clan destroyed. Can you imagine her hatred? We can't provoke the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, but she can easily pursue Zhu Gong. If they fight, we will be in an impossible position."

Li Ximing pondered for two breaths. "I agree. We cannot stay out of this. The only thing we can do is try to mediate and delay the conflict between the two sides. That is also what Tinglan and Houfu want to see..."

His expression gradually calmed. "We must protect Kong Guxi and Kong Xiaxiang. The words will only be useful if they come from their mouths."

Li Zhouwei nodded slightly. "I'll leave this to Grand-uncle's judgment."

He flicked his finger, scattering the tea from his cup, leaving it empty. He turned his hand over, revealing fingertips as white as jade, which faintly glowed like pale stone.

With a thought, a slit opened on his fingertip, like a small mouth, revealing a glimpse of bone. After a few moments, a single drop of pale-gold blood mixed with red dripped out.

The instant the blood left his body, it became as round as a pill and as hard as stone. It landed in the jade cup with the crisp sound of colliding porcelain, spun twice, and stopped.

The radiance of the Bright Yang divine ability rose, surging into the cup and dyeing it a brilliant golden-white. All the divine ability and dharma power were sealed within. On closer inspection, it looked rather like a fine treasure.

Li Ximing sighed repeatedly. "Are you... injured?" he asked, concerned.

Li Zhouwei smiled and shook his head, his expression unchanged.

"It's just one drop of blood. I'll take a Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill and I'll be fine with a little time. The essence blood I gave the Dragon-kin back then was the real loss. That time, I needed Purple Mansion Realm spiritual items to recover. Now, one or two pills will suffice."

Li Ximing looked truly embarrassed. He pushed the brocade box into Li Zhouwei's hands and took out several more pills for his recovery.

"I never wanted to drag you into this, but given the circumstances, it seems unavoidable..."

"Grand-uncle jests."

Li Zhouwei shook his head. He took out a jade box and pushed it over, along with the brocade box.

"Inside this box is the Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Pill Scroll, a gift from Daoist Master Tianhuo. The Golden Feather Sect obtained it from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition also calls it the Radiant Qilin Refining Art. It's useless in my hands. Grand-uncle, please take it."

He had gestured to both items. Li Ximing was stunned for a moment, wanting to object, but Li Zhouwei just smiled, stood up, and brandished his Radiant Sun King's Halberd.

"This humble thing can't compare to a Spiritual Artifact."

Li Ximing chuckled, accepting the gift. He opened the jade box and saw a golden scroll within, its four corners embroidered with patterns like golden threads, densely covered in profound script. The moment he touched it, the texture felt fine and soft. He couldn't look away.

"This," he said, astonished, "is a true treasure!"

Li Zhouwei didn't understand the way of pills, so he didn't know the value of the Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Pill Scroll. But Li Ximing, an Alchemist, understood with just a glance.

The author was named Cui E, from an unknown era. He was truly a gifted genius with astonishing skill in the Dao of pills. He also cultivated the Bright Yang Dao lineage and was a master of Mystic Pill techniques.

This scroll was his life's work, recording three pill arts in total: Radiant Qilin, Phoenix's Auspicious Arrival, and Void-Nature Shared-Form.

Both Radiant Qilin and Phoenix's Auspicious Arrival were exceptionally advanced. The first used the authority of Bright Yang's life-giving aspect to assist in pill creation. It detailed six types of Bright Yang pills and three types of Radiant Fire pills, with uses ranging from healing, cultivation, and maintenance... to even escape.

The second art, Phoenix's Auspicious Arrival, used the Bright Yang "father-son principle" to refine pills. In theory, it was similar to the Embracing-Feather Uniting-Heart Pill that Li Ximing had refined for Huo Yang in the Palace of Slumbering Li in the Zhuluo Kingdom.

However, this divine scroll contained hundreds of thousands of words on the subject. It was far more complex than the method Li Ximing had hastily derived from the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art merely to fool that Poluoduo Demon beast. This scroll was an attempt to refine true spiritual pills worthy of renown.

As for the so-called Void-Nature Shared-Form, it was a step further, but it seemed like a simplified Bright Yang version of the Heavenly Heart Oneness technique. Li Ximing scanned it. If he hadn't already obtained the Heavenly Heart Oneness art, Void-Nature Shared-Form would have been invaluable. As it was, it seemed of little use.

When Cui E wrote this scroll, his lifespan was clearly running out, but he still lamented:

'Within the Three Profoundities, pills belong to Encompassing Profoundity. I have heard that below Wanling, four palaces were established, known as the Four Secret Pill Arts, but they are long lost. If I could but read one in detail, I would have no regrets in this life!'

Evidently, Cui E also knew that predecessors had already researched arts like the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art, and he secretly regretted not having access to them.

'This Senior Cui E was clearly seeking a higher breakthrough in the Dao of pills, but in the end, it's inferior to the Secret Enclosure Sect's Heavenly Heart Oneness.'

'The Four Secret Pill Arts must be the heritage of the Encompassing Profoundity pill art... Jiangnan has Secret Diffusion and Secret Enclosure, the two 'Secrets'. The others must be elsewhere.'

Li Ximing finished reading. He folded the Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Pill Scroll. The material was fine and soft, clearly refined with Purple Mansion Realm spiritual materials to keep it pristine for centuries.

"With this scroll, I can refine targeted pills for most of the Bright Yang resources I acquire!"

He put it away, satisfied. Li Zhouwei watched him for a moment, then reminded him, "Grand-uncle, how is your divine ability cultivation?"

Li Ximing paused. "I haven't been troubled by injuries or battles recently, just... busy. I've only just managed to 'ingest qi' for the Scripture of the Monarch's Luminous Heart. It will be several years before I reach the Foundation Establishment Realm... let alone perfect my 'Immortal Foundation'."

Li Zhouwei was puzzled. He hesitated before saying, "Grand-uncle's cultivation speed has always been extremely fast. Could it be that your battle with Helian Wujiang damaged your qi sea? Craftsmanship is important, but you cannot neglect completing your Life Divine Ability to protect your life-mandate."

He took out the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pills that the Great Xiukui Monastery had sent over a few days ago. He kept one for himself and passed the rest to Li Ximing. "These Qilin's Radiant Unity Pills are for daily cultivation. It's better to use them than to hoard them."

Li Ximing sighed. "I'm just stretched thin in so many areas. When there's a chance, I try to earn resources, but then I worry about getting into a fight and injuring myself, wasting all my cultivation. So I've been putting it off..."

"As soon as I resolve the matters at hand, I will enter seclusion for several years!"

He smiled and was about to ride off on his light, but Li Zhouwei stopped him and gave a quiet order. "Go and ask my clan-brother to come up!"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. A handsome man in red robes flew up the mountain. He bowed to them both and smiled. "Greetings, Grandfather, Elder Brother!"

"Oh?" Li Ximing's delight was now visible. He sipped his tea with a smile. "So it's our Fifth Young Master, making a name for himself."

"Grandfather jests!"

Zhouming had never seen Li Ximing joke like this. He was not just flustered but utterly mortified. He managed a dry response. Li Zhouwei, however, chuckled.

"Fifth Brother broke through, emerged from seclusion, and made quite a name for himself singing on a boat."

Being teased about his minor vanity by two Daoist Masters, Zhouming actually blushed. He offered a few more pleasantries, insisting he was nothing compared to them. Li Ximing was secretly pleased. He smiled, "I still have a few things to settle. Once I've arranged matters, I'll come back and test your progress."

Though happy, he was worried about the Kong family and didn't dare delay. He left quickly. Zhouming looked like he wanted to say more. Seeing him go so soon, he was overcome with a sense of loss, standing woodenly to the side.

'A white horse charges the western ridge, a descendant awaits ascension...'

Li Zhouwei savored the thought for a moment, letting his clan-brother sit. He understood clearly. 'He truly is fortunate. As soon as Uncle Li Chengzhi passed, he immediately entered seclusion and broke through. This secretly aligns with the Bright Yang Dao of the son advancing when the father dies. Furthermore, he has an ancestor and an elder brother who wield divine ability, whose very words decide the livelihood of thousands... This is all adding to his momentum...'

...

Sacred Writ Gate.

The night was thick, the mountain forest pitch-black.

Li Ximing flew straight to Shanji Prefecture and quickly entered the sect gate. He found everything quiet. He landed on the peak. The forest around the cave-dwelling rustled, but it was deathly silent.

Yet, on this dim peak, a middle-aged man was kneeling on the steps below. His figure was almost completely enveloped in the heavy shadows of the trees, appearing as a dark mass. Fortunately, a dharma lamp nearby lit up on its own. Its light, filtering through the gaps in the trees, struck his face, creating a fractured, mottled radiance that made his eyes burn with intensity.

Li Ximing had seen this man a few times. Although he looked different now, he recognized him instantly. He paused his stride, turned slightly, and glanced down.

'Clever.'

That single glance made the middle-aged man look up, but his movement immediately slowed. He didn't dare let his gaze rise above Li Ximing's knees. His voice trembled.

"Xiaxiang greets the Daoist Master!"

This was the youngest Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator of the Kong family—Kong Xiaxiang.

The once-arrogant upward tilt of his eyebrows now drooped, and his eyes looked defeated. The face that was once spirited, quick-tempered, and impulsive had completely lost its color. It was now pale and gaunt, his eyes sunken.

In just over a decade, life in the Sacred Writ Gate had completely worn away his edges. The vitality of his youth was gone, leaving only a sorrowful skin-bag draped over terrified flesh and bone.

As a direct descendant of the Kong family, he had naturally been married off to a main-line descendant of the Sacred Writ Gate. For all these years, with Kong Guxi stationed overseas most of the time, he had been the Kong family's representative. Every stumble and every conflict ultimately landed on his shoulders.

The phenomenon that had just erupted in the north had filled him with shock and suspicion. Kneeling on the steps, he trembled, unable to speak.

Li Ximing looked at him. One glance at his complexion was enough to know that in the years of Zhu Gong's disappearance and seclusion, she hadn't had the energy to manage things. The guest-elders of the Sacred Writ Gate had clearly given him hell.

"How is Kong Guxi?" he asked.

A flush rushed to Kong Xiaxiang's face. He kept his head low. "This... this lowly one does not know."

"Why did you come up here?"

The man pressed his forehead to the ground. In a voice that was equal parts gritted teeth and weeping, he forced out a single, heavy kowtow. "This lowly one... is afraid..."

Li Ximing paused for only a second before continuing into the cave-dwelling. As he stepped into the empty chamber, the dharma lamps on either side flickered to life, illuminating the steps below. The peak remained silent, save for a faint, ghostly voice echoing in the air:

"Then keep kneeling here. Once you've endured it, you won't be afraid anymore."

Li Ximing walked inside and found no trace of Tinglan. The only one in the cave was Daoist Master Shanbai, who was calmly sorting spiritual herbs, appearing completely detached from the situation.

From the empty inner chamber, the sound of Zhu Gong's violent coughing and retching could be heard. Bright red flower petals, carried on a warm wind, gushed from the cave, whistling incessantly.

The old Daoist Master beside him used a divine ability to still the wind. His eyes, beneath white brows, watched Li Ximing quietly. He had clearly sensed the northern phenomenon as well.

"Tinglan went to the Great Xiukui Monastery to discuss important matters," he said in a raspy voice. "I'm sure Daoist Master Zhaojing anticipated this. But she instructed me... when you arrived, I am to cooperate with you fully."

Li Ximing gave a faint smile. The old man said quietly, "The world rises and falls. Such are the tides of fate. Everyone has their own burdens to bear."

Li Ximing shook his head silently. He took the jade cup from his sleeve, placed it on the old man's table, and said, "I must trouble you, Senior... Let us end this as soon as possible."
