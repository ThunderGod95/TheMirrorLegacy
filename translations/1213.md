# Chapter 1213: Creek Hook

Li Jiangqian smiled as he carefully appraised the woman before him, yet he found that no matter how he observed her, he could not perceive any difference from before she had received the Talisman Qi. He then nodded inwardly and said:

"It is the Obscure Talisman now."

Li Que'wan lowered her gaze and nodded, feeling the miraculous and constant response from within her Shengyang Acupoint. She let out a soft breath and said with a serious expression:

"There is an advantage now—if I were to attempt to transform the Profound Minister Moon Essence again, the probability of success would surely be more than seventy percent. As for the exact figure, I would have to make an attempt to find out!"

Li Jiangqian considered for a moment, then shook his head and said:

"This is not the right time for such an attempt. If something were to go wrong, the timing would be inopportune and would only cause delays. Although you have no need to polish your divine ability cultivation, you can practice spell arts, or make arrangements in advance… and act as you see fit."

Li Que'wan's eyes lit up, and she nodded lightly, replying:

"I was just about to mention the matter of spell arts. I should have gone to the pavilion to exchange for a new art long ago, but I deliberately postponed it, considering that my Talisman Qi would be enhanced and I wanted something to complement it."

She said with a serious expression:

"Since a battle is imminent, I will focus on the Bright Talisman, which is suited for combat."

The crimson-robed man before her instantly understood her meaning. His golden eyes shifted slightly as he said:

"I understand. This talisman mediates gain and loss, allows one to divide and control their mind, and can even influence the actions of others. Naturally, a great incantation similar to the Great Radiance of White Brilliance would be superior!"

"Immensely powerful spell arts often consume vast amounts of dharma power and require significant casting time. They are also prone to being interrupted, and some even require prior preparation… Since you can anticipate your opponent's actions, it will be easier to evade, and your incantations will not be so easily broken. When the time comes to cast, your spell will also have a greater chance of hitting its target… preventing your foe from escaping."

In truth, there are exceptions among this category of spell arts, such as the life-mandate induction art that Li Zhouwei and his son currently cultivate. Its power can be great or small and requires almost no incantation, but this is a method of the Palace of Orthodox Nature, which Li Que'wan cannot cultivate.

After speaking, Li Jiangqian suddenly realized something. A peculiar look entered his eyes, and after a long moment of contemplation, he asked:

"However, I have an idea."

Li Que'wan raised an eyebrow to look at him as her elder brother paced back and forth, musing aloud:

"I've heard that even when our grand-uncle uses his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body for pill refinement, it can still receive the blessing of the Talisman Qi."

Li Que'wan was taken aback, her gaze flickering for an instant as she listened to her brother continue with a smile:

"Since the key to both the Bright and Obscure Talismans lies in sustaining injury, why not try refining an external body? If you were to close your eyes and focus your spirit, walking about with the external body, and that external body were to be injured, would that count as 'bright' or 'obscure'?"

"If it counts as the Bright Talisman, would that not mean you could receive its mind-reading enhancement without being injured yourself? When you no longer need it, you could simply retract the external body. Your true body would remain 'obscure,' while the external body becomes 'bright.' Wouldn't you have achieved both states simultaneously…"

Li Ximing had spent all these years cultivating this Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body, and Li Jiangqian had indeed taken note of such an excellent life-preserving method. He had thought of it immediately, leaving her stunned as she listened.

For a moment, she found no flaw in his logic, not until Li Jiangqian rummaged through his sleeve and handed her the scroll containing this wondrous art did Li Que'wan realize something was amiss.

"That's not right—for the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body to be linked to one's life-mandate, one must first perform the Sealing the Life-Mandate, which requires biting off a piece of one's own finger."

Li Jiangqian came to a sudden realization:

"That would already count as the true body being injured…"

"What a pity!"

"Then again, it might not be such a pity."

Li Jiangqian said suddenly:

"There is more than one method to refine the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body, with superior, intermediate, and inferior versions. It is rumored that for those who master the highest form, the divided body is identical to the original…"

Compared to Li Jiangqian's ambitious considerations, Li Que'wan seemed more worried. She said:

"It is just that the resources required for the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body are immense, and whether we can achieve the desired effect is an unknown… The world is full of countless strange arts and spiritual treasures… This is something we can keep in mind, but to actively search for a solution would be like looking for a needle in a haystack."

Li Jiangqian could only nod. Having settled this important matter, he was in high spirits. He was chatting idly while preparing to leave with her when his spiritual sense suddenly stirred. He froze for a moment, then said softly:

"The old Daoist Master Chen has arrived."

Li Jiangqian was a cautious man. Since his younger sister was here receiving the Talisman Qi, he had been using an Immortal Artifact to scan the surroundings as he moved about. The moment the old Daoist Master stepped onto the lake, he was immediately detected.

The brother and sister exchanged a glance. Li Que'wan immediately activated her Spiritual Treasure, turning invisible and retreating. Li Jiangqian, meanwhile, stood up, unrolled a scroll, and feigned studying a spell art, though he was inwardly puzzled.

Chen Yin was an ally Li Jiangqian had secured long ago. He naturally could not have been unaware of the Li family's conspicuous array-building activities these past few days. Li Jiangqian could not easily leave the lake, but he had sent a letter to the Chen Clan to inquire specifically about this.

'But the response I received was not clear. According to the Chen Clan's reply, the old Daoist Master was already in seclusion…'

But as he was pondering, he heard an aged voice from outside:

"Is Daoist Friend Changli present? Yushui has come to pay a visit!"

"Old Daoist Master, please come in!"

A clear light then shone brilliantly as the color of Mansion Water descended, and a sharp, fierce aura of the Way of the Sword permeated the air. A white-haired old man was already standing on the mountain peak.

Chen Yin was quite advanced in years. Ever since the death of the highly anticipated Chen Xuanyu, he had aged more rapidly with each passing year, and this had only worsened after the great war. He looked to have lost weight, his cheeks were hollow, and his entire demeanor was somber, giving him an emaciated appearance.

Li Jiangqian and he had, in a sense, fought side-by-side. During the great war, the old Daoist Master had protected him on many occasions. Although it was to curry favor with his family, a bond of friendship had been formed. The young man said with a cheerful smile:

"Senior, you flatter me… I've already said there is no need to call me Daoist friend… Since our two families advance and retreat as one, it would be presumptuous enough for me to call you Martial Uncle. How could I dare to be called your peer?"

Chen Yin smiled and shook his head, but his eyes were dim, and his smile seemed withered and feeble.

Li Jiangqian could tell that Chen Yin was not in a good state. Although the wounds from the great war had healed, his failure to advance his divine ability had instead aggravated old injuries. It seemed he was also suffering from the side effects of some medicinal pills, as he appeared listless.

'Year after year of war… yet he could still find the time and achieve such a cultivation speed… I wonder how many resources he burned through. Perhaps he consumed everything that was originally prepared for that Purple Mansion Realm candidate…'

But perhaps due to a change in his state of mind, the sword qi emanating from the old Daoist Master had grown even more potent. His eyes burned brightly as he said:

"I heard that King Wei is gravely injured and that the Li Clan is establishing an array… I am worried for the Western Shu…"

Li Jiangqian nodded with a helpless expression, repeating the excuses he had prepared earlier and affecting a look of great concern. The old man before him managed a faint smile and said:

"I have just failed in my attempt to advance my divine ability. I received the news upon exiting my seclusion and rushed here without delay. Moongaze Lake is one of the world's great lakes. I wonder if you might permit me a humble place to recuperate, so that I may also… help guard the border…"

Li Jiangqian was instantly overjoyed:

"With such an offer of assistance, how could I possibly refuse!"

Although Chen Yin claimed to be coming to the lake to recuperate, Moongaze Lake was no sacred ground for Mansion Water. Even if the Mansion Water was indeed abundant, there were no arrays or treasured lands to channel it. How could it possibly compare to the ancestral home the Chen Clan had managed for generations? It was merely a polite excuse!

'He truly is a senior… this gesture of sending charcoal in a blizzard is beautifully executed!'

In order to guard against the west, Li Jiangqian could not act personally at present and could only send envoys to hurry between the various great families, a process that would cause untold delays... Chen Yin's consideration was very thorough. His arrival at this moment not only guaranteed the presence of a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm combatant, but it would also free up Li Jiangqian's hands!

'More importantly, with my little sister secretly keeping watch, I can truly leave without worry, unafraid that this fellow might notice something and discover our family's secret.'

Li Jiangqian was endlessly delighted and surprised. He raised his eyebrows and sighed:

"How are your injuries, Martial Uncle?!"

Chen Yin, however, seemed to have thought of something. His expression changed slightly, and he said:

"My family possesses a secret art used to condense a water-virtue divine ability. Although it consumes more resources, it is quite useful. However, if it fails, there are some lingering after-effects. But rest assured, Changli, this injury will absolutely not hinder me in battle…"

Seeing Li Jiangqian shake his head repeatedly, Chen Yin understood that the Li family truly intended to help, so he shook his own head and said:

"I have cultivated a certain spell art. It is better for my sword techniques to leave some injuries on my body."

Li Jiangqian felt a slight chill and nodded. He refilled the senior's tea, but Chen Yin lowered his gaze and said:

"It is just… there is a matter I must trouble you with, Jiangqian…"

"Senior, please speak freely!"

Seeing Li Jiangqian's solemn expression, Chen Yin hurriedly said:

"It is not a major affair… My family's Wenyao, by borrowing King Wei's might, earned great merit and thus had the opportunity to become a Holder of the Profound. He serves in the same court as Jiangliang, and their relationship is quite good. He has long felt admiration and has been thinking of… arranging a marriage with your esteemed clan…"

'So that's what this is about!'

Li Jiangqian's gaze flickered, and he said with a smile:

"I wonder… who it might be…"

In truth, the only one in the Li family of the same generation as Chen Wenyao who was unmarried was Li Que'wan. However, not only was she still in seclusion in the eyes of others, but Li Jiangqian also did not believe they would have the audacity to make such a proposal. And as expected, Chen Yin said:

"Oh… it is his youngest son. He has only just begun Qi Refining, but his talent is the best in our Chen Clan, and he is a clever boy. I hear that your noble clan has a young highness of a similar age, named Yusui…"

Li Jiangqian, of course, knew that name… it was the name of his second younger brother's young daughter, who had been left at the lake! A peculiar look flashed through his eyes, and his first question was:

"Have you spoken to Jianglong, Martial Uncle?"

Chen Yin nodded with a smile and said:

"Indeed. The second highness's meaning was that… this matter has nothing to do with him, and the decision must be made by those here at the lake."

Li Jiangqian smiled but did not speak.

'Li Jianglong is as cold as ever… Be it Suihuan or Yusui, while Li Jianglong certainly pays them some mind, he harbors no great affection for them… He simply considers them returned to the family…'

'In this regard, Li Jiangxia has a kinder heart. He has always kept his two children by his side, raising them personally. Who knows how long it will be before he is willing to return to the lake.'

Since his second brother had already given his word, he had likely accepted no small number of gifts from the Chen family, merely wanting to avoid making the decision himself. Li Jiangqian, believing he understood him well enough, sneered inwardly, though his tone was warm:

"Our two families are so close, so a marriage alliance is only natural. However, she is of our family's direct line. Firstly, I must consult my father on this matter, and secondly, we must wait for a suitable opportunity to let the two of them meet…"

Even though he had little desire for this in his heart, he gave a perfunctory agreement for now. The first priority was to make Chen Yin stay at the lake willingly. He would take the benefits first and deal with this later. He smiled and said:

"How about this… Senior, first let the young master come to the lake for a visit. Let him cultivate here for a year or so. This will give my niece a chance to meet him, and also allow our elders to meet him. What do you think?"

This was a reasonable proposal, so Chen Yin nodded repeatedly and replied:

"Jiangqian is most thoughtful!"

Li Jiangqian smiled and said:

"I recall… my third younger brother also has a son and daughter, do they not? Also in the capital…"

Chen Yin simply replied:

"In truth, I did ask… Jiangxia has been in seclusion for some time, and both the young highnesses are cultivating in their manor. There has been no opportunity to meet them. To wait for one might take many years."

'His movements are quite swift… After all, with the Song Emperor's support, he is not much slower than Jiangliang.'

Having subtly probed the cultivation progress of his two younger brothers, Li Jiangqian then rose and escorted Chen Yin to the western shore. He settled him on a nearby island in the lake and instructed Li Suihuan not to let anyone disturb him, only then did he depart.

He had not expected that upon stepping into the hall, a wisp of clear light would appear, materializing into a figure ten feet away. It had the color of lead and mercury and revealed a graceful silhouette—it was none other than Li Que'wan.

This gave Li Jiangqian quite a start. The Daoist Master's golden pupils instantly dilated, a look of shocked uncertainty in them. He was thoroughly shaken:

'How formidable!'

A distance of only ten feet… at the Purple Mansion Realm, that was no different from being face-to-face. If Li Que'wan had been holding a Dharma Art, it could have struck him in an instant!

'The Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure combined with the blessing of the Talisman Qi… to think it could reach such a level!'

Li Jiangqian was secretly alarmed, but Li Que'wan had other matters on her mind. Her gaze was filled with confusion as she said softly:

"Elder brother, that Senior Chen… I glanced at him just now, and there seems to be a problem with his divine ability."

"A problem?"

This instantly put Li Jiangqian on alert. While Li Que'wan's skill was a good thing, he temporarily set it aside. He focused his attention and frowned, seeing Li Que'wan continue with doubt in her voice:

"The moment I saw him, I faintly sensed the aura of Pit Water. If… he truly rushed here immediately after leaving seclusion, then how could he carry the aura of Pit Water on him?"

The woman's gaze was peculiar:

"So, when you left with him, elder brother, I returned to the mountain and immediately performed an incantation to verify it… It is indeed Pit Water, and even the Vast Ocean. It is a sign of one's immortal foundation being shattered."

Li Jiangqian was slightly taken aback and fell silent for a moment before replying:

"Are you saying… the fourth divine ability he intends to cultivate is the Vast Ocean?"

Li Que'wan nodded solemnly.

Li Jiangqian's eyelid twitched slightly as he replied:

"He is a ruthless one… With his abilities and remaining lifespan, he would never seek an extension. He must have found some secret art to halt his progress at this fourth divine ability… all to gain a temporary surge of power to protect Chen Wenyao until he reaches the Purple Mansion Realm."

Li Que'wan said with a grave expression:

"There is more."

Her expression was grim as she whispered:

"This Vast Ocean… is the version from our family's collection."

"He traded for it with someone?"

At these words, the young man before her spun around, staring at her intently. After a moment of deep thought, he said softly:

"Only a few families possess it… We just gave a copy to the Chunyi Dao Gate… No, it wasn't them. From gathering qi to completing cultivation and then assaulting the Purple Mansion Realm… the timeline does not add up."

Li Que'wan's expression tensed, but Li Jiangqian shook his head slightly. In just a moment, he had connected all the pieces of information he had. His eyes narrowed as he replied:

"I fear it is not as simple as a trade. Don't you think that… whether it's the secret art for breaking through or this clever approach to cultivating a fourth divine ability, neither seems like the Chen Clan's style?"

"Furthermore, the speed at which he perfected his three divine abilities was far too fast… There is someone behind him, pulling the strings."

At the mention of someone pulling the strings, Li Que'wan had a subconscious reaction:

"The Golden Feather Sect? They also obtained it early on."

Seeing that his sister had an answer, a trace of doubt appeared in Li Jiangqian's eyes. He said quietly:

"The Chen Clan's relationship with the Golden Feather Sect is not good… Although it could be a superficial disagreement, I have another candidate in mind."

"He also obtained the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture long ago. More importantly, his entanglement with the Chen Clan is not shallow… they even have a marriage alliance by blood…"

Li Que'wan reacted instantly, a look of understanding flashing in her eyes. She raised her head and whispered:

"Daoist Master Chuting!"
