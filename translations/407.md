# Chapter 534: Xu Xiao

The Jade Court Guard hurried and left, and Chen Mufeng's expression was grim. Li Chengliao took a sip of tea and asked, "Battalion Commander... what happened?"

Chen Mufeng turned around and replied respectfully, "It's just a few trivial matters, Young Master... Let me—"

Li Chengliao happily poured him a cup of tea and responded, "There are no such things as trivial matters; they are all family affairs."

Chen Mufeng's expression shifted slightly, and he hurriedly explained, "It's about Lady Liu... She has a childhood sweetheart, the son of a family in town. His surname is Xu, and he has some family assets... His ancestor is the head of a town. The Liu Family wanted to use Lady Liu to elevate their status, but after hearing that Family Head is interested in her, they immediately changed their mind... and this caused some gossip..."

"Oh?"

An amused smile appeared on Li Chengliao's face, and he joked, "Looks like I've become a scoundrel who stole someone's wife!"

Chen Mufeng looked embarrassed and said, "We have sent two people to invite Lady Liu here but that man managed to beat them up and turn them away... Although those two are cultivators, they were no match for him."

At this, Li Chengliao's smile vanished instantly. He fixed his gaze on the middle-aged man and said, "In my Li Family's territory, I am the head of the second lineage. I sent people to bring her here, and he dared to beat them up and chase them away? Who does he take the Li Family for? We've never forced Lady Liu to agree to the marriage. She could have handled this in a more civilized manner instead of making things awkward!"

Chen Mufeng hung his head in silence and replied, "I have sent the Jade Court Guards over..."

"Wait..." Li Chengliao frowned and continued, "I finally made it down the mountain; let's not create a scene. My clan uncles dislike that and I don't want to risk drawing their attention. That won't end well."

Chen Mufeng nodded in agreement.

"Get two Jade Court Guards over here; I'll go there and see for myself," Li Chengliao instructed.

He straightened his brocade robe and walked toward the door, accompanied by Chen Mufeng.

"This young master from the Xu Family is also rather peculiar. He was mute and had been stuck at the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm for many years. He only broke through last month and now that he can speak, everyone showers him with praises..."

Liu Family's courtyard.

Although the Liu Family had been in decline for many years, it once enjoyed a glorious past.

The courtyard was dark and old, but it occupied a large area. An exquisite stone table sat in the center, where a woman with a cold aura around her leaned against it.

Her beautiful face was filled with radiance, but her slightly furrowed brow revealed a trace of sadness. At the other end of the table stood a strong, handsome young man who radiated vitality.

"Xiao, you are acting too impulsively... The Li Family is powerful and well-established; the geniuses in their family are cultivating in the sect, and they are connected to immortal clans through marriage. How could you offend them like this..? Even if they came to my house, I could have just found an excuse to deal with them. By beating those two up and chasing them away, you're essentially making this into a big issue!"

Xu Xiao crossed his arms and shook his head as he sneered coldly.

"You don't understand! How many times will your excuses work? As long as their eldest son is interested in you, he'll continue sending people to bother you. The Liu Family won't miss the chance to climb the social ladder either. The only way to make him back down is to create a scene!"

"The Li Family values their reputation and enforces strict rules within their clan. My only concern is that we won't be able to create a big enough problem!" he added.

Liu Lingzhen shook her head and remarked softly. "You've been holed up in the courtyard for years and was mute before. You don't understand the extent of the Li Family's influence..."

Xu Xiao laughed proudly and assured, "Don't worry! I've broken through to Qi Cultivation Realm! The great Dao is just right in front of me!"

"What?!"

Surprise and joy filled Liu Lingzhen's face as she continued, "It's only been a few years! You've made another breakthrough?!"

She paused, then added with a hint of regret, "It's a pity it came two years too late. You're already twenty-five, and the Xu Family has bestowed the spiritual qi of heaven and earth on your big brother..."

"It doesn't matter. I don't even want that! It's just a portion of Cave Spring Clear Qi. I've used better," Xu Xiao replied, raising his eyebrows with disdain.

"It's just that I've been breaking through too quickly, so I can't reveal it to others yet. Though there's a secret technique to conceal it, it's hard to guarantee that the Li Family won't have any perception technique to see through it. I'll have to wait a few more years..."

He then changed the subject and continued coldly, "I'm just waiting for that pack of dogs to come and openly confront me. Even if he is Li Chengliao, the eldest son of this generation, the people in the Clan Affairs Courtyard are watching him closely... He'll be in trouble if they report him directly to Qingdu!"

After hearing him, Liu Lingzhen calmed down significantly and murmured, "What if the Clan Affairs Courtyard covers up for him...?"

"Hahaha! I checked the records a few days ago. The Clan Affairs Courtyard has always targeted the powerful. If they made any mistake, they would be the first to be blamed," Xu Xiao replied confidently.

He chuckled coldly and continued, "As long as you and I stay calm, the Jade Court Guards can't do anything to us! And with the immortal sect watching over all of us, I'm sure we'll be fine!"

Liu Lingzhen nodded, somewhat naively, listening to the words of her beloved. Just then, Xu Xiao detected something with his spiritual sense and whispered, "Someone is coming!"

Sure enough, an elder from the Liu Family called out from outside obsequiously. A series of knocks came from the courtyard door, followed by a creaking sound.

Madam Liu's voice rang out, "Zhen'er! Open the door quickly!"

Liu Lingzhen's face paled, and she grabbed Xu Xiao and urged him to leave. However, Xu Xiao refused to move and merely said, "It's too late. I doubt he can see through my cultivation. Just let him in!"

Madam Liu had no intention of waiting for Liu Lingzhen to answer the door. With a creak, it was pushed open. However, it was a young man clad in a pale-colored dharma robe who entered first with a spear slung across his back.

He glanced at the two of them and waved casually.

The middle-aged man behind him, who was at the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, pushed the group of elders and clan uncles from the Liu Family out with ease. The door quickly slammed shut behind them.

The young man with a heroic face then said, "Li Chengliao from the Li Family greets fellow Daoists."

Liu Lingzhen felt as if she had fallen into an ice cave, and Xu Xiao was momentarily stunned. He had never expected Li Chengliao to come in person.

"Xu Xiao from the Xu Family greets Young Master," he managed to reply.

Seeing the way the couple looked at each other, Li Chengliao quickly understood the situation. He continued, speaking with a smile, "Young Master Xu truly looks impressive. The Xu Family is a well-respected lineage; it's about time a hero emerged among them."

Li Chengliao's words caught Xu Xiao off guard and rendered him speechless, while Liu Lingzhen found herself in a difficult position.

After a brief pause, Li Chengliao clarified, "It was the Liu Family who gave your name earlier, my lady. What a foolish mistake they have made! My subordinate also took their bribes and came to invite you over. Thankfully, Young Master Xu intervened; otherwise, it would have caused a misunderstanding!"

"This is certainly my office's oversight. As an apology, I've reserved a quota on the peak for the Xu Family and you, my lady. I've also sent someone to your family to issue a formal apology. I hope you can forgive the incompetence of my subordinates," he added generously.

Not only was Xu Xiao stunned, but Liu Lingzhen was also taken aback for a moment. Her face then lit up with joy as she looked at him with newfound admiration and bowed to express her gratitude. Xu Xiao also lowered his head and did the same.

Li Chengliao's gaze lingered on him for a moment before stepping outside. A group of Liu Family members immediately surrounded him, crying out in an effort to keep him there.

These individuals had been profligate sons when the Liu Family was in power. Now, as they aged and took on leadership roles, they had made a mess of things. Li Chengliao ignored their pleas and left the yard with Chen Mufeng right beside him.

Once outside, Chen Mufeng seemed eager to speak. When they finally returned to the hall, the middle-aged man leaned closer and whispered, "That Xu Xiao... is really at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."

Li Chengliao's smile vanished, replaced by a puzzled expression as he murmured quietly, "Not only is the Liu Family incompetent, but Liu Lingzhen also seems naive and lovesick. Thankfully, this engagement hasn't been finalized; otherwise, problems would arise sooner or later."

He then added thoughtfully, "As for Xu Xiao... his sudden rise is quite peculiar."

After a moment of contemplation, he said, "Tell me everything you know about Xu Xiao!"

Understanding the gravity of the situation, Chen Mufeng hurriedly replied, "He is twenty-five years old, born mute and rarely left his home. He remained at the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm until he was twenty-one when he suddenly began to speak. His personality changed drastically, and he broke through in his cultivation, keeping it a secret until it was recently discovered that he reached the third stage."

Li Chengliao calculated silently, then voiced his suspicion, "Could he have encountered some opportunity?"

His doubt lingered, and he turned to ask, "I remember the head of the Liu Family... is an unrefined Qi Cultivator, right?"

"That's correct," Chen Mufeng confirmed.

Li Chengliao considered this answer, placing his hands behind his back as he said thoughtfully, "Send someone to call him over. Offer him some spirit items as a bribe, and have him test Xu Xiao."

Chen Mufeng was momentarily taken aback, thinking Li Chengliao was being overly cautious.

Nonetheless, given Li Chengliao's authority, he nodded and went off to execute the orders, leaving Li Chengliao standing in the hall, staring at the tea that had already grown cold in the wind.

"I would love to get to the bottom of this and see if this is the work of a demon," he murmured, his mouth set in a stern line.

————

Liu Family's courtyard.

Once the Li Family members left, Liu Lingzhen exclaimed happily, "He doesn't put on airs! What a good man!"

Good man..?

Xu Xiao sighed inwardly. Li Chengliao's response had completely taken him by surprise.

What a clever move to turn an enemy into a friend! No wonder the Li Family dominates the lake, monopolizes spirit fields, levies heavy taxes, and squeezes out every last bit of Spirit Paddies. They rely on connections to control the quotas, ensuring only their clan members can enter the immortal sect to train... and they've solidified their power within the family!

That young master may appear polite on the surface, but who knows if he holds a grudge in his heart? It seems we can't stay here for long... It's better to leave early and explore. Once we establish our immortal foundation and acquire divine abilities, we'll return and overthrow this tyrant...

"Zhen'er, once you break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, we'll go out and explore!" he said.

This had always been their goal, but now, Liu Lingzhen hesitated slightly.

"B-But... he has given me a place to practice on the mountain! The devil plague is rampant out there! Isn't it nice to stay in this safe haven and receive stipends? The Li Family is also quite nice... they never kill to collect blood qi!"

Xu Xiao sneered, transmitting his voice through mana, "Such a formidable family must have their dark secrets. Li Ximing can produce so many pills without compromising his cultivation progress—he might be relying on devil cultivation techniques and blood qi... He probably kills in secret behind the immortal sect's back. If the immortal sect eventually finds out about it, he'll certainly face dire consequences!"

Liu Lingzhen considered what he said carefully and felt that it made sense. She looked at him with admiration as Xu Xiao continued, "We'll travel the world or join the immortal sect! Once we become Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, we'll return and take over this family. Isn't that a good plan? By then, clan stipends will mean little to us; and the entire southern shore will be ours!"

His strong confidence captivated Liu Lingzhen. Compared to Li Chengliao's politeness and reluctance to cause trouble, Xu Xiao was far more charming. She smiled and nodded vigorously.

Xu Xiao paused, feeling that the situation was becoming more challenging than expected as Li Chengliao had caught him off guard. He produced a pill and suggested, "You should go into seclusion and attempt a breakthrough now. Take this pill right away, don't wait for the Qi Cultivation Realm. When you reach Jade Capital Stage, we'll set off."

Liu Lingzhen's eyes lit up with excitement instantly, but she could not help but ask, "Where did you get this? You didn't steal it from home, did you..?"

"Don't worry," Xu Xiao assured softly.

After escorting Liu Lingzhen to the backyard, Xu Xiao prepared to leave. He had not mentioned his breakthrough to the Qi Cultivation Realm to anyone, so he could not ride the wind as his means of travel. As he stepped out of the room, he encountered a fierce-looking old man blocking his path.

"Liu Family Head," he greeted, keeping his tone even for Liu Lingzhen's sake, even though he had no respect for the man.

Yet, he had not anticipated the old man's harsh words.

"Stop seducing my daughter, you motherless bastard!"

Anger welled up in Xu Xiao as he retorted sharply, "I'm only showing you respect because of your daughter, old man! You better know your place!"

Old Liu, clearly enraged, lunged at him with an open palm, muttering curses under his breath. Xu Xiao swiftly grabbed the old man's arm with one hand, his grip like an iron clamp, preventing him from pulling away.

The old man made no attempt to pull his hand away either as he instinctively reached for the sword at his waist with his other hand.

With a sneer, Xu Xiao reacted faster than lightning, seizing the sword before the old man could even draw it. As he pulled and twisted, a dark flame erupted from his lips.

Old Man Liu felt a sharp pain in his chest and quickly pulled out two talismans, but they were incinerated in the flames before he could even have time to use them. He felt weak all over, as if his very cultivation had been burned dry.

He screamed and teetered on the brink of collapse. However, Xu Xiao had no intention of killing him; he calmly sucked the fire back into his stomach and warned coldly, "Annoy me again and you will die miserably."

With a swift motion, a small rune appeared in his hand. He slapped it onto Old Man Liu's chest and threatened, "If you dare to spread anything about me, this fire will reduce you to ashes as soon as you open your mouth!"

"Ah! D-Devil... Devil cultivator!"

Old Man Liu, having never encountered anything like that, was struck by how dark and eerie the spell was. He fearfully accused Xu Xiao of being a devil cultivator, but quickly fell silent and collapsed to the ground under Xu Xiao's fierce gaze.

With a mocking smile, Xu Xiao turned and walked away. Old Man Liu shakily got to his feet, spitting in anger, before quietly slipping into the backyard and kneeling down, too frightened to speak.

A Jade Court Guard landed in the courtyard, his appearance resembling that of Chen Mufeng. Shocked, he murmured, "Just that one move... Just one move..."

Even a Qi Cultivator of the second heavenly layer like him clearly felt the dangerous nature of the black flame, let alone Old Man Liu.

"Did he reincarnate, or did he inherit some sort of immortal legacy? I have never seen such a genius!" he murmured to himself.

Just as the Jade Court Guard finished speaking, he spotted a figure leaning against the backyard door. It was Xu Xiao, who had returned with a blazing black flame in his hand as he regarded him with a sinister expression.

"Captain Chen... why must you meddle in other people's affairs?"[1]
