# Chapter 932: The Halberd

Li Ximing's Dao-Profundity in the Radiant Fire was nothing remarkable, but his skill in controlling flame was no jest. Though he had only just begun his training, he closed his eyes and sensed the intricate details, swiftly grasping the mysteries of this spell art.

'This Great Radiance's Splendor... it isn't an accumulation of dharma power or a divine ability. It's more like a faint reflection of the Radiant Fire within my Purple Mansion Realm. Itâ€™s like using a bronze mirror to catch the light of a flame; you can gather that glow. But no matter how ornate or vast the mirror becomes, or even if you craft many mirrors, the moment the flame itself dies, the light scatters. Everything turns to nothing.'

'Therefore, the true starting point for cultivating the Great Radiance's Splendor is the Radiant Fire of the Purple Mansion Realm. It *must* be the Radiant Fire, and nothing else!'

'And because its origin is the flame itself, it doesn't matter how short my time cultivating this spell art has been or how weak the "mirror" is. As long as I have begun the cultivation, it will reflect at least a flicker of candlelight.'

Thus, the moment the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame settled into the Radiance Gate acupoint, his Sea of Qi produced the first spark of the Great Radiance's Splendor without any need for prolonged cultivation. To be precise, it was the Great Parting's Red Radiance.

He opened his eyes, pleased. He brought two fingers together and twisted his wrist inward. A point of red light, no larger than his little finger, flickered to life at his fingertips. It was hazy, with a feeling of dense weight.

'The power is... acceptable.'

When this wisp of Great Parting's Red Radiance flew out, its power was actually less than his Radiant Celestial Wave Art. But Li Ximing hadn't forgotten how long he had trained the Radiant Celestial Wave Art, versus how long he had trained this new radiance. To have this much power immediately after reading the manual... even if it was borrowing the strength of his Radiant Fire, it proved how marvelous this spell art truly was.

He lost himself in the text, reading past the introductory sections and skimming all the way to the very end. After he finished the entire sixth-rank spell art, he finally understood the purpose of the nine Profound Acupoints.

The immortal cultivator who created the Great Parting's Red Radiance had originally used eight acupoints to absorb spiritual energy and the one "Radiance Gate" acupoint to erupt with light. But it seemed that after he had mastered the spell art and his divine ability and Dao-Profundity had reached an extremely high realm, he discovered the path continued further.

'After the Great Radiance of White Brilliance is mastered, the eight acupoints lose their purpose of absorbing energy. Instead, one can continue to collect other Spiritual Fires. By using an extremely high Dao-Profundity, these Spiritual Fires can be simultaneously stored within the body, housed within those eight acupoints, allowing one to seek an even higher breakthrough.'

'At that point, one must collect five different Radiant Fires and four types of True Fire... Furthermore, among the five Radiant Fires, one *must* be the one called the Incinerating Radiant Fire of the Fold... How extravagant!'

Li Ximing had heard of the Incinerating Radiant Fire of the Fold. Huo Yang had mentioned it, and Li Ximing himself had heard the rumors. It was an extremely rare and powerful flame with a peculiar trait: if its owner perished, the fire would instantly shatter into eighty-one motes of Long-March Pheasant Flame.

Li Ximing sighed and opened his eyes. The sun was already dipping toward the west; clearly, several hours had passed.

The mountaintop, however, remained bright. A woman in red robes stood quietly to one side, waiting respectfully.

"Greetings, Daoist Master..."

The response from the lake had been swift. Li Minggong was already on the mountain. Seeing Li Ximing's contemplative expression, she immediately swallowed the words she had been about to speak.

Li Ximing pondered for another moment before giving a casual wave, gesturing for her to sit nearby. His spiritual sense stirred.

'Valley Wind Guide-Fire!'

The Juque Palace trembled instantly. The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire erupted, surging up through his Dharma Body before coming to rest in his Sea of Qi.

'On this point... I don't need to rely on Dao-Profundity. Could there be any difficulty?'

Ordinarily, Li Ximing wouldn't have been able to do a thing. He couldn't even modify a fourth-rank Dharma Art if it was placed right in front of him, to say nothing of his meager Radiant Fire Dao-Profundity, which was barely enough to even attempt cultivating the Great Radiance of White Brilliance.

But with Valley Wind Guide-Fire, his theoretical control over fire was terrifyingly precise. He forcibly bent the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire to his will, making it lower its head in grievance and squeeze itself into one of the Profound Acupoints.

The original spark of Great Parting's Red Radiance immediately extinguished. Li Ximing used his divine ability to calculate for a moment, his eyes gleaming. He dragged the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire back out and began testing the eight Profound Acupoints, one by one.

He wasn't adjusting the Profound Acupoints with his Dao-Profundity; he was forcing the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire to submit and *conform* to the acupoints. Soon, his eyes lit up, and he extended his hand once more.

"Hum..."

Two points of red radiance now hovered at his fingertips.

The second one, however, was faint and illusory, like a candle flickering in the wind, threatening to go out at any second.

"Haha."

Li Ximing chuckled and waved his hand, dismissing the Dharma Art. He understood.

By relying on Valley Wind Guide-Fire, he could temporarily create an *extra* wisp of Great Parting's Red Radiance. This second wisp wasn't a product of his own cultivation and couldn't be improved, but it was a temporary, additional source of power.

At first glance, this trick seemed useless. Unlike the main Radiance Gate acupoint, using the other eight required the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire to obediently retract inside his body and *stay* in the acupoint, unable to be used against an enemy. The power of a single wisp of Great Parting's Red Radiance was nothing compared to the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire itself. It seemed like a pointless trade.

'But that's just for *one* wisp of Great Parting's Red Radiance. What if I had nine? The leap from a single wisp of Red Radiance to a single wisp of Great Parting's Golden Radiance is a massive hurdle in this spell art, incredibly difficult to cross. But if I cultivate all nine wisps of red, I can temporarily retract my True Fire during a fight and unleash the golden light all the same.'

Satisfied, he dismissed the spell art and turned to Li Minggong with a smile.

"Well?"

He was, of course, asking for news about Dingyang Zi of Qize. He had already laid out his plans.

'Since I'm going to borrow his Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron anyway, why not kill two birds with one stone? I'll refine those pills for him. I'll gain my share of Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resources, *and* I can use that high-grade cauldron to squeeze out an extra pill or two. It's the perfect opportunity to get all my own refining done as well!'

Besides, who is Dingyang Zi? When he left Gardenia Scenery Mountain that day, he'd said he still had a Spiritual Artifact refining in his cauldron. A full Spiritual Artifact, not just a spirit embryo! This man was a rare and skilled Artifact Refiner. He needed a favor from Li Ximing, but Li Ximing saw him as an equally valuable prize. That was why he had revealed his own skills early on, to build a good relationship.

Li Minggong understood his question and replied respectfully, "When this junior arrived at Qize, Daoist Master Dingyang Zi's 'Sun-Worshipping Mountain' daoist tradition treated me with utmost courtesy. I was granted a personal audience with the Purple Mansion Realm master himself. After hearing the Daoist Master's intentions, the Mountain Lord personally visited, bringing me straight to the lake. Unfortunately, the Daoist Master was not present, so he had to return with regret, but he left a message for me."

With a Spiritual Artifact in his cauldron, Dingyang Zi naturally couldn't be away for long. The fact that he came at all showed how important this was to him. She continued, "He is in absolute awe of the Daoist Master's alchemy skills. He is willing to continue refining the Upper Shaman spirit embryos for you. If the Daoist Master no longer requires them, he has a Spiritual Artifact refining matter he would like to entrust to you."

This was precisely what Li Ximing was most eager to hear. He nodded slightly, and Li Minggong continued.

"Unfortunately, he still has that Spiritual Artifact in refinement and his schedule is full. He also... considered whether our family has sufficient spiritual resources for a new refining project. He was very frank. He said that if the Daoist Master can refine those three cauldrons of pills for him, and if the yield is fifteen pills or more, he will personally design a Spiritual Artifact for our lake and provide the complete blueprints. The actual refining and expenses can be discussed afterward."

"He even said that if our family has other connections in artifact refining, we are free to take his blueprints to someone else. He guarantees the difficulty of refinement will be greatly reduced."

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. "How confident!" he laughed.

Li Minggong lowered her head silently. Li Ximing continued, "There's no need for discussion. Go back and tell him we accept. Since we're asking him, why would we go find someone else? I'll not only refine the pills, but I'll also go to Tiger's Frontier and borrow their spiritual cauldron to do it, just to show how seriously I take this."

His laughter faded, and his expression turned serious.

"Before you leave for Qize, have Que'Wan look into the Wall-Sinking Water. We need to procure a large quantity. Let her determine how much we can acquire and handle the arrangements within the inner array."

Li Minggong quickly assented. Just then, a streak of Heavenly Light shot in from off the mountain. It materialized into a man with sharp eyebrows, golden eyes, and platinum armor. He clasped his hands in greeting.

"Seventh Uncle-Grandfather has returned."

"Ah."

Li Zhouwei took a seat, seemingly in good spirits. He smiled. "There was a disturbance in the Wilderness this morning, so I made a trip. I wasn't able to come see Uncle-Grandfather immediately... Please forgive me."

"Nonsense."

Li Ximing waved it off with a smile. The two men rose in tacit understanding and made their way toward Pingya Island. As they descended toward the inner array, Li Zhouwei recounted the situation with the Valiant King. Li Ximing's smile faded, replaced by a quiet sigh.

"That is... troublesome. On the other hand, I have some good news for you."

They sat, and Li Ximing poured tea. He then retrieved a jade box from his sleeve and handed it over. Li Zhouwei examined it and his eyes widened in surprise.

"Grotto Egret Origin Water!"

Li Ximing chuckled and recounted the events of his journey. Li Zhouwei was visibly shaken. After a long moment of contemplation, he said quietly, "Uncle-Grandfather, you are truly one whose life-mandate is bound to immortal destiny. You cannot be compared to ordinary men."

Li Ximing laughed and shook his head, dismissing the praise. "The 'immortal destiny' belongs to our ancestors. The 'life-mandate' was borrowed from you. The benefits I'm reaping now are just nourishment from the Supreme Yang's decline. What's there to brag about?"

Li Zhouwei sipped his tea. "I see no difference."

Li Ximing waved off the topic, so Li Zhouwei changed it. "Daoist Master Tinglan stopped by. She said Daoist Master Zhu Gong is very gravely injured and hopes you might pay a visit... to see if your pills can help."

Li Ximing shook his head. "Sumian would be better for this. They're grasping at straws coming to me. After I've handled my affairs, I'll pay a visit, just to show respect."

He turned back to the main topic. "Idle talk is useless. I've earned a favor from Dingyang Zi, an opportunity to have a Spiritual Artifact refined. Since you've moved the Grand Ascension to the Viewing Pavilion Platform, send the Yuan E to Qize. Have him take a look at it."

Li Zhouwei's eyebrows shot up, a flicker of pleasure in his eyes. Before he could refuse, Li Ximing pressed on. "Ancient items are rare, and ancient armor is even rarer. There's no need to covet them; we can refine our own. Furthermore, now that I have the Radiant Fire, this should go to you."

As he spoke, he reached out. The Heavenly Light between his brows flared, and a spiritual halberd flew forth. It was about three feet long, its double-bladed head curved like a crescent moon. It was the Radiant Sun King's Halberd!

The moment the Spiritual Artifact appeared, even as Li Ximing held it, it seemed to strain, eager to fly into Li Zhouwei's grasp. Li Ximing sighed.

"This item... is of most use in your hands."

This time, Li Zhouwei truly did not dare accept. He shot to his feet, his voice stern. "Elder, you worked for years and paid an immense price to obtain this treasure. How could I dare to seize it!"

"What I spent was the family's resources!"

Li Ximing shook his head and simply relaxed his grip. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd's Improper Bestowal ability activated instantly. The weapon transferred its allegiance on its own, flying directly into Li Zhouwei's hands.

"This!"

Li Ximing cut him off, feigning anger. "I am idle and roam freely outside. You are guarding the North Shore. If you don't have a powerful Spiritual Artifact to hold the line, a proper weapon in hand, how can that stand? They might not be able to do anything to you, but if you get tied down, the family members on the riverbank will be in grave danger."

He pressed the weapon on him, leaving no room for argument. Before another moment passed, a knock came from the hall door. It was Li Que'wan. Li Ximing immediately shifted the conversation, bidding her enter. "What is the situation with Jiangnan's Wall-Sinking Water?"

Li Zhouwei had never been a man of many words. Seeing the matter settled, he could only offer a deep bow of thanks before securing the King's Halberd to his waist.

Li Que'wan was now in charge of the family's spiritual resources, so she was the best person to ask. She bowed gracefully. "Daoist Master, if you require a large amount, we cannot let others know, or they will raise the price on us. This matter must be handled by our own people, purchasing small amounts from various marketplaces. Unfortunately, Mansion Water resources are not abundant to begin with, and Wall-Sinking Water is mostly used for artifact refining. This junior estimates... we can only acquire a few dozen portions immediately. Over a year... we should be able to get at least ten or twenty small jars, but it will put a strain on the family."

Li Ximing made a quick calculation. A year would be more than enough. He relaxed. Li Zhouwei knew he was planning for the Neck Feathers and added, "The Method of Transformation... you'll need to use your immortal foundation to examine it and test it."

"This junior understands."

Li Que'wan understood they were making long-term plans and quickly took her leave. Li Ximing hesitated for a moment before speaking in a low voice. "I want to establish a department in the Deer Weeds island region. It suddenly made me think of Liu Changdie... He said his divine ability could nurture Golden Essence and resources. If he truly has the heart for it now, we could ask him to look at the Feather Transformation Pool in the cave and see if he has any ideas."

Liu Changdie had a long-standing friendship with their family and was trustworthy. Unfortunately, he also carried a great deal of trouble, and Li Ximing worried about attracting unwanted attention. He looked conflicted. Deciding to table that thought, he first asked about the Mansion Water Dao, turning back to Li Zhouwei.

"Is the Luminous Heart Origin Qi available?"

Li Ximing had other plans for this trip back, one of which was to retrieve the clan's Luminous Heart Origin Qi.

Despite his constant travels, he had not neglected his cultivation. He used short breaks to study spell arts and longer ones to practice Qi Refining. He had already completed the six cycles with ease and was now preparing to use the Luminous Heart Origin Qi to cultivate his second divine ability.

'In recent years, there was endless trouble and constant fighting. But now, Jiangbei is stable. With Minghuang standing guard on the shore, it seems there won't be any major conflicts. I can finally cultivate in peace.'

He took the item from Li Zhouwei and tucked it into his sleeve, sighing with emotion. "I truly envy the Purple Smoke Gate's Traversal Token. These days, I wish I could be in multiple places at once, or even better, cultivate and practice spell arts at the same time."

But a sigh was just a sigh. He didn't delay. After finalizing plans with Li Zhouwei, he departed on a beam of light.

Li Zhouwei saw him out of the hall and then returned, alone.

Ever since returning from Mount Dali, his heart had not known a moment of peace. Li Ximing's words echoed in his mind.

*'He gave me the King's Halberd to protect the family members on the riverbank.'*

'Protection for a time... but what if I fail to satisfy Luoxia and am forced into reincarnation? What fate will await our family members then?'

The inner array was always dim, and now it was utterly silent. The vast hall echoed with the sound of his solitary footsteps. He walked to the highest point and sat upon the main seat. He untied the three-foot-long King's Halberd from his waist and held it, studying it intently.

The King's Halberd. A symbol of Bright Yang's authority.

The face of the halberd blade was a deep, heavy bronze, yet it shimmered with a silver light. The pattern of a qilin beast undulated across its surface, its head facing downward in a condescending gaze. At the top, signifying the front and legitimacy, was the sigil of High Radiance.

He turned the halberd over. On the reverse side, beneath the sigil of the Yang Cusp, was the same qilin beast. This time, however, its head was tilted upward, its ambitious eyes staring directly at him.

*Clack...*

The sharp, powerful sound of hurried footsteps echoed from outside the hall. His second son stopped at the entrance and announced respectfully, "Father, Daoist Master Tianhuo of the Golden Feather Sect has arrived."

The golden-eyed man did not respond. He remained on his high seat, silently staring at the sigil on the halberd's blade.

The announcement echoed and faded into the cavernous hall. At last, the man they called the White Qilin, the prodigy of the Li Clan, moved. His fingers and wrist tensed, and the King's Halberd in his hand began to tilt, its cutting edge drawing ever closer to his face.

As he turned the weapon, the angle of the light caused the qilin beast engravings to sink into shadow, while the Yang Cusp sigil at the top blazed brighter. The long, sharp edge caught the light, reflecting his cold, golden eyes.

"See him onto the island."
