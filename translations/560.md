# Chapter 862: The Fall Of Great Ning Palace

Great Ning Palace.

The sky over Great Ning Palace was gloomy and gray. The once bright and beautiful lake had completely dried up, the ground had cracked, and the occasional clouds drifting overhead quickly dissipated.

The cliff at the very center had already collapsed, filling more than half of the dry lakebed. Countless palace halls and towers had toppled and collapsed, littering the ground with wreckage. It was a scene of desolation.

Trouble had broken out in Anhuai Heaven, and a host of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had started to battle. They had even started fighting inside Great Ning Palace itself, causing the entire area to quake. In less than fifteen minutes, the place had been reduced to ruins. If not for the continuous efforts to maintain it, it could very well have been shattered into dust.

Now, with all the Mahas and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators inside, some unknown Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had apparently left a hidden trap that destroyed the sky-piercing pillar of light. It had been smashed to pieces after everyone had entered, leaving Great Ning Palace abandoned and disregarded, shrouded in darkness.

Silence lay heavy over the area as Li Xuanfeng stepped down from the palace ruins. The ground was covered in rubble. He pressed one hand on a stone stair several feet wide, pulled it loose, and casually tossed it aside, where it landed with a heavy rumble.

Li Xuanfeng had been trapped here for some time, but he hadn’t been idle. After all, there might be quite a few spirit items hidden in the ruins of the collapsed palaces that he could put to use.

He retrieved a bright silver lamp from the debris, brushed away the dust, and saw large words engraved on its base, Gaoping’s Xi Family.

This lamp was only at the Qi Cultivation Realm. Li Xuanfeng examined it carefully; the craftsmanship was elegant and refined. Just then, he heard Si Yuanli’s voice from the side, "When the Wei State fell, many cultivators fled south and reached the riverbank. At that time, most of the land south of the Great River was under Chu’s control. The King of Chu ordered the cultivators to stay north of the river, forbidding them to cross south.

"The Sima, Su, Xi, Xiao, and other families gathered in Jiangbei and held secret talks for several days. Led by the Li and Jiang families on both sides of the Jia River, they founded the Ning State, upheld the legacy of Wei, and made the Wanglin Upper Sect the leading immortal sect."

The collapsed palace’s roof ridge jutted high into the air. Si Yuanli sat cross-legged on top of it, resting his chin on one hand, looking rather leisurely as he continued, "Sect rivalry wasn’t so fierce at that time. All cultivators did their best for the country. Ning State made the King of Chu extremely wary, and he always viewed the later-arriving families with suspicion..."

After listening for a while, Li Xuanfeng glanced at the glowing signature of Gaoping’s Xi Family on the lamp base in his hand and said softly, "I heard the founder of the Chunyi Dao came from the Xi Family..."

"It was indeed the Gaoping’s Xi Family." Si Yuanli replied, "That person only ever listened in at Chongming Hall, so strictly speaking, it was only half of a proper Dao lineage. But the more one lacked something, the more they cared about it. I heard that person claimed allegiance to the Green Pine Temple Dao lineage for life. The Chunyi Dao was the same way—always obsessing over such things."

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly. Si Yuanli paused for a moment, then spoke softly, "Fellow Daoist, you guessed right. My Si Family originally bore the surname Sima. We were a powerful family from the north, with Purple Mansion Realm cultivators as far back as the Zhou dynasty. When Wei fell, we fled south all the way and finally settled in Jiangnan."

"So that’s your ancestral origin..." Li Xuanfeng noted.

Si Yuanli sighed softly, "The noble lineages from north and south have lasted to this day. When you look around, whose ancestors weren’t princes, marquises, or generals? It’s better not to mention it; once you do, all you can say is that their descendants are unworthy of their name."

Li Xuanfeng fell silent for a moment. At least his own family was acknowledged as Wei's Li. Then he saw Si Yuanli pause for a moment and speak softly, "My ancestor once guarded the riverbank for the Wei State, and that’s how this scroll of the Huai River Map came to be. It was drawn by the True Monarch Shangyao Cui Yan of the time... It’s a first-class ancient Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact."

Li Xuanfeng was slightly stunned and asked softly, "An ancient spirit artifact... It looks like it’s for defense and suppression. How does it compare to the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal?"

"Well..." Si Yuanli considered for a while, then shook his head as he replied, "It can’t really be compared. Besides, different spirit artifacts perform differently in different hands. In any case, both spirit artifacts are extremely formidable."

Li Xuanfeng suddenly recalled the Binding Ring and Cloudsunder that Yu Muxian had used in the past. Since Si Yuanli seemed open to conversation, he casually asked, "How does it compare to Binding Ring and Cloudsunder?"

"Hahahaha!" Si Yuanli let out a hearty laugh, raising his eyebrows with disdain, and answered, "Fellow Daoist, you must be joking! Binding Ring and Cloudsunder are imitations made by Yuanwu. Binding Ring is a copy of the Yue Cultivating Sect’s Bu Yue, while Cloudsunder is a copy of Xiu Kui Temple’s Tian Xiu. They’re already somewhat inferior to ordinary spirit artifacts. How could you compare them to an ancient spirit artifact?"

He hesitated for a couple of seconds, as if searching for a suitable analogy. Then he pulled out an ordinary dharma sword from his storage pouch and pointed at it. "This thing also came from Yuanwu Peak. It’s said to be at the Foundation Establishment Realm, but anyone can tell it was just pieced together by countless Qi Cultivation Realm refinements over time. It barely meets the Foundation Establishment Realm, has the appearance, and some qualities of Foundation Establishment Realm, but no real wonders."

The orthodox Immortal Sect disciples would never use this kind of dharma sword. Li Xuanfeng examined it carefully, found it just as Si Yuanli had described, and nodded.

Si Yuanli chuckled and said, "Fellow Daoist, comparing this thing to Fuchen Peak’s Water Wall Pearl is about the same as comparing those imitations to an ancient spirit artifact!"

The words flashed through Li Xuanfeng’s mind like lightning, and he keenly caught a certain phrase, Binding Ring dwas a copy of the Yue Cultivating Sect’s Bu Yue...

When Yu Muxian had brought out Binding Ring, Tang Shedu had mocked it endlessly, infuriating Xiao Yongling so much that even his spiritual qi changed color. Li Xuanfeng remembered that incident well. He vaguely recalled that the Xiao Family’s ancestor, Xiao Xianyou, who was once hailed as a Golden Core seedling, had been slain by a dharma artifact resembling the Binding Ring!

Whether Tang Yuanwu actually had that level of strength at the time is another question... and the Binding Ring hadn’t even been completed yet. That means it must have been that spirit artifact, Bu Yue...

Xiao Xianyou was killed by the Yue Cultivating Sect! Was it Shangyuan? Or who else?

Li Xuanfeng wasn’t curious without reason. Xiao Chuting’s actions were difficult to understand, and there was no way to infer his position. If he could get information about Xiao Xianyou, he might be able to roughly deduce Xiao Chuting’s stance, giving himself a basis to judge the situation in the future.

These direct descendants already have resources and innate abilities that are a hundred times greater than ordinary people, and most of their temperaments aren’t far off either... they monopolize the situations and relationships, leaving ordinary people clueless and at their mercy...

Li Xuanfeng thought deeply. Si Yuanli seemed also touched by the Huai River Map. The two of them fell silent, and the sky overhead had turned a pale blue. A bright glow faintly shone through, illuminating them as if they were at the bottom of a lake.

"After losing Daoist Master Qiushui’s divine abilities and suffering at the hands of all those Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, Great Ning Palace finally couldn’t hold on!" Si Yuanli exhaled and laughed, "Just wait a little longer, and we can finally leave this wretched place!"

Boom!

Purple lightning roiled in the sky with a terrifying momentum. The lightning around Li Qinghong’s entire body had turned bright purple. Each feather on her feathered robe was glowing brightly.

She had slaughtered her way here without regard for cost or consumption, breaking several sieges at different crossings. Even though she had been injured, she’d also saved a lot of time.

She immediately activated the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow inside her body. Her internal mana surged and her thunder pool roared with waves of lightning. Her eyes shone with a misty purple hue, and her silver-white spear shone as it pointed forward. Silver lightning burst forth from the six tokens in her palm, descending with a thunderous crash.

Of the four northern cultivators beside Li Ximing, three were Purple Mansion and Golden Core Daos cultivators that had ingested blood qi. The last one was a true devil cultivator from the Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace. The silver lightning exploded, and they all let out pained howls.

The three blood qi-infused Purple Mansion and Golden Core Daos cultivators were better off as they were only paralyzed. However, the last devil cultivator was like a man thrown into boiling oil. His robes burst apart, and his skin bubbled with countless blisters. His blood vessels burst, and thick black smoke billowed forth.

His eyes burst from their sockets like two rotten fruits, exploding midair with a pop. The blood evaporated in an instant, and his body melted like wax, revealing pale white bones at the elbows.

"Profound Thunder!"

Li Ximing was shocked as he watched. This devil cultivator had been the most restrained in his previous battle with Li Ximing. He was often drenched in sweat under his Radiant Light and unable to move freely. Yet, thunder truly was the bane of devils. And among all lightning, Profound Thunder was supreme—he naturally couldn’t compare.

Li Qinghong had seen countless devil cultivators on her way. Her almond-shaped eyes glinted as she immediately understood that this one’s entire body had almost certainly been refined through demonic rituals, usually making him indestructible. But he was as fragile as tofu against Profound Thunder, breaking apart in just two strikes.

She rode the lightning closer, and the purple spear shadow pierced into the demonic smoke, seizing the moment when the silver lightning was still reverberating in the air. Purple light and sparrow shadows flew in, but instead of striking the devil cultivator whose body was already melting, she turned and aimed at a figure in midair.

Li Qinghong had rescued several crossings already, and had long since understood the mindset of the attackers. She wasn’t in a rush to kill the heavily wounded devil cultivator; letting him go would actually attract many cultivators to hunt him down and relieve pressure on the grand formation.

As she calculated, the cultivators themselves were miserable. Their internal mana was still trembling, yet they were being forced to use their dharma artifacts to defend. Their hearts quaked, This southern devil sect... even has a Dao lineage of thunder arts? Why are they working with the devil sect?

Li Ximing formed a spell seal and saw a round shield fly toward him in the air, humming and shimmering faintly. But its quality was truly mediocre. It had just reached him when the purple-and-white spear was already there.

Clang!

Purple lightning exploded on the round shield. The dharma artifact was struck so hard it staggered to a stop and almost flew backward. It started to give off black smoke from the sheer heat of the collision. But Li Qinghong’s spear did not pause; it thrust forward again.

Just then, a bright radiance descended, and the familiar suppressive force returned. The bright light atop the sky flickered, and a magnificent white barrier rose once again.

Battling such a fierce, thunder-wielding cultivator was already nerve-wracking and left no room for distraction. The renewed suppression caused merely a half beat of delay in the northern cultivator, but that was enough. His eyes were filled with the sight of lightning striking down on him.

Puff!

Li Qinghong was battle-hardened and experienced in spell combat. Her spear flashed, and the dharma robe on his body, as fragile as a layer of thick hide, shattered with a crack. Her spear had already pierced his chest, spraying blood.

At that moment, the dharma artifacts of the remaining devil cultivators finally arrived one after another, but they were all subdued by the Radiant Origin Pass. The man with the spear through his chest turned deathly pale, vomiting blood as he stumbled backward, desperately suppressing the lightning within him.

Li Qinghong withdrew her spear and activated the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow within her, purple lightning crackling under her boots. She pointed her spear diagonally, eyes like lightning, and coldly shouted, "Begone!"

Silver lightning spread with her words, forcing them back several steps. Li Ximing loosened the Radiant Origin Pass’s suppressive force at just the right moment. Three dharma artifacts flew out in a hurry, and the three men, as if granted amnesty, quickly retreated.

As for the devil cultivator whose body had melted earlier, he dared not linger any longer. He had long since transformed into a black mist and fled several kilometers away. He was also being chased by other streams of demonic light and continued fleeing northward at a frantic pace.

Li Qinghong stepped forward with her spear. A muffled thunder rang out, and purple lightning landed beside Li Xizhi. When she looked back, the surrounding cultivators felt a chill of fear and retreated in unison.

Li Xizhi had held his own against five opponents, which was a testament to his mastery of spell arts. He took the opportunity to rest and replenish his energy. But when he saw Li Qinghong return alone, his expression turned slightly somber.

Li Qinghong’s purple lightning shielded him; the Profound Punishment Tokens whirled around her; the Duruo Spear gleamed silver; and the Cyan Sparrow Plume shone brilliantly. Thunder itself was already fearsome, but with her late Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation strengthened by the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow, she shone even more brightly, making everyone’s expressions change in shock.

"Lightning cultivator..."

The female cultivator of the Wood Virtue shuddered slightly, her eyes filled with disbelief. Five of them had surrounded and attacked him for so long, yet they had gained nothing. They lingered unwillingly until Li Qinghong’s Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens lit up, at which point they all fled in a rush.

Li Qinghong exhaled lightly and looked into the distance, where streaks of escape light continued to converge rapidly. More and more brilliant streams of light were flowing together.

Li Xizhi moved closer to her and said softly, "Aunt, I’m afraid we can’t hold anymore."

The situation was becoming increasingly clear. The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the sky had some reservations and weren’t fully engaged; many of them were still fighting among themselves. Yet, the number of Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators flooding in was growing rapidly...

What’s more, those who had arrived so far were just rogue cultivators from the north without any background. The ones with real strength were still observing from the sidelines, ready to pounce at any moment.

"The Azure Pond Sect’s formation here isn’t exactly impressive. Even if these Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators don’t strike, the southbound devil cultivators can each throw a spell art and still tear this grand formation apart."

Once the formation beneath their feet was broken, a horde of cultivators would swarm them. There would be no point in holding this place any longer.

Li Qinghong nodded silently and said softly, "I’ve received some news. I’ll do my best to hold on for a little longer... maybe there’s still a chance."

She turned to the north. The purple light in her almond eyes dimmed, but the bright purple lightning on her robe still danced, intimidating the demons in the sky.

A patch of black cloud gradually emerged from the demonic smoke and slowly approached them. It didn’t carry an overwhelmingly demonic aura; instead, it exuded a peculiar and profound feeling.

Li Ximing frowned slightly as his Immortal Foundation burst into the air, transforming into a massive radiant pass that glowed with a searing light.

It illuminated a man in crisp, practical black robes. His face was slightly pale, and he stood with his hands behind his back. He had sharp eyebrows, and two calm gray eyes. He slowly rode on two black clouds, and held a white talisman in his hand as he stopped unhurriedly in front of them.

"Fellow Daoist, we meet again."

Yu Jiang

Li Qinghong had just seen him earlier, when she had been duelling Guo Hongjian; he was a cultivator from the Southern Sea whose aura was hard to gauge and carried an air of deep mystery.

He simply stood there, staring at Li Qinghong’s dazzling purple lightning-covered figure. His expression was naturally full of admiration, as if he were waiting for something rather than attacking.

Li Qinghong knew this person was formidable and held her spear without striking. After two seconds, she saw a streak of blue-black light shoot skyward from Chengshui Tomb in the north, rapidly spreading and dyeing half the sky blue-black.

Boom!

A thunderous roar erupted, as if something had fallen from the distant mountains, sending tremors through the earth. A hazy purple-black energy surged skyward.

The demonic smoke in the north all paused, and twisted in chaotic confusion. Some turned back north; some halted to fight among themselves; and a few continued south, becoming increasingly disordered.

She glanced worriedly, but the young man before her seemed to have been waiting for this moment to arrive, and finally spoke, "Daoist Li, the Great Ning Palace has fallen. Chengshui Tomb is filled with all sorts of relics, and the devil cultivators will surely rush to search for them, so the offensive will slow down for a while.

"I came here especially for this chance, and I ask for your guidance."

His clear voice slowly echoed in the air. Li Qinghong frowned slightly at the unexpected words and softly replied, "Li Qinghong greets you, Daoist friend. But there is a great calamity between the North and South at the moment. I fear it is not appropriate for a duel right now. Please wait until this time has passed. If I survive, you may seek me out then."

Yu Jiang looked at her seriously and replied, "I have some grudges with the Azure Pond Sect, and since you blocked the devil cultivators, I’m not too pleased."

Li Qinghong narrowed her eyes slightly. His words were contradictory, but she immediately became alert, Of course, since the southern advance of the devil cultivators was the will of several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, I greatly reduced the pressure on the defense lines by blocking them alone. As time passes, I might offend all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators...

She exhaled slightly. She started to regard the person in front of her as a cultivator sent by one of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to block her. On one hand, she was relieved he hadn’t come a moment earlier, and on the other, she drew her spear, purple lightning rippling, and softly said, "Li Qinghong of Qingdu."

"Yu Jiang of the Southern Sea," replied the man.

The young man nodded lightly, and suddenly a clap of thunder exploded by his ear. Li Qinghong’s figure vanished from where she stood. She rode a surge of purple lightning, speeding toward him with Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens spinning in her hand and shining with silver-white lightning.

"When Yang reaches its peak, it gives birth to six thunders!"

Boom!

Before her spear could reach him, a streak of silver-white lightning shot forth, but Yu Jiang glanced at the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens and formed a seal with his hand. A glistening gold rune appeared in his palm.

He said softly, "Thunder falls in Dui, resting in the sea of clouds."

In an instant, a vast ocean appeared in the air and a sparkling golden light rose from it. The silver-white lightning fell into it and disappeared like being drawn into a bottomless vortex.

The vast ocean swirled once, then condensed into a single golden talisman that fell into Yu Jiang’s hand. Li Qinghong’s Profound Thunder had been dispelled.

However, she already knew this person was formidable and was not surprised. But as the Duruo Spear carried a purple shadow and thrust forward, Yu Jiang actually raised his hand to slap at her spear.

"Hm?"

Li Qinghong’s silver spear seemed to land on something soft, bending slightly and brushing past him. The black-robed youth casually deflected a surge of purple lightning with a wave of his hand.

Clang!

Li Qinghong pulled her spear back, reversed it, and raised the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens in front of her to guard against attacks. She glanced quickly and saw that the tip of the Duruo Spear had indeed bent slightly, but it was slowly straightening out like a living thing.

"This is the Shamanic Talisman Dao technique..."

She now had a rough measure of her opponent’s strength, while Yu Jiang remained outwardly calm. Still, the hand holding the golden talisman trembled slightly, dissipating a bit of silver lightning. Clearly he wasn’t as nonchalant as he appeared.

Li Qinghong drew her spear back, but Yu Jiang raised his sleeve and lightly flicked it, releasing a few specks of black light that spun in midair, transforming into flowing talismans that quietly circled him once before falling into his eyes.

His pupils suddenly widened, staring intently. Li Qinghong felt as if thunder had exploded in her mind, seeing only darkness as drops of fresh blood dripped, and everything before her became unclear.

What a formidable spell art! Li Qinghong’s vision dimmed, giving Yu Jiang a chance to form another spell seal. His gaze fell on the Duruo Spear in her hand, and he calculated silently, That spear is not ordinary. Perhaps because of its Profound Thunder nature, it naturally restrains shape-shifting demons and evildoers. It was able to straighten itself out almost immediately after receiving my palm strike...

He placed one hand under his elbow, extended two fingers on the other hand, and pointed them at the Duruo Spear in Li Qinghong’s hand. Raising his head slightly, he intoned, "Rise, Shamanic Transformation, turn the weapon into demonkind."

Li Qinghong’s eyes briefly darkened, but a clear light surged from her dantian, sweeping away the illusions of the Shamanic Talisman Dao in her mind. Once she regained her clarity, she summoned her lightning and suddenly felt something slimy in her hand.

The Duruo Spear in her hand had turned into a white python with fine scales, opening its mouth in confusion as it tried to wriggle free. Li Qinghong gripped it tightly, realizing she had fallen into someone else’s spell rhythm.

"Command!"

She decisively spat out a Profound Thunder, and a spot of light shot from between her lips and teeth. Yu Jiang raised an eyebrow, stepped back half a step, and the air exploded with a purple thunder cascade that came crashing down. He had no choice but to pause his spell art to defend himself.

Li Qinghong seized the opportunity, pouring her vast lightning energy into her spear and completely purging the Shamanic Talisman Dao art from it. The Duruo Spear instantly regained its original form, its silver light flashing as it merged into the lightning cascade.

Yu Jiang struggled to move in the thunder cascade but managed to raise his hands, talismans glowing as he pressed both palms against the spear, trying to deflect it.

Li Qinghong was no longer playing around. Her eyes turned a bright purple-white, and terrifying lightning coursed through her body, instantly tearing his spell art apart as she thrust straight at him.

"Good!"

Yu Jiang had no choice but to avoid her strike. He gently twirled his robe, letting it be shredded in the lightning. His figure reappeared several feet away, and he spat out a mouthful of purple lightning.

Both of them stopped fighting and looked north, only to see billowing demonic smoke roaring as several magnificently dressed, awe-inspiring devil cultivators stood among the clouds, slowly pressing down from the horizon.

Clang...

But neither of them looked at the demonic smoke in front of them. Instead, they gazed farther north, where a point of golden light was rushing through the air with fierce, overbearing Astral Qi, ruthlessly tearing through the demonic smoke and rapidly approaching.

Thunder arts split the sky, wielding the spear like a wandering dragon.
