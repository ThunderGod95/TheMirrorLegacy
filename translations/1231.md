# Chapter 1231: Calculations

Hearing this, Ji An froze on the spot. He set down his cup, a trace of doubt in his eyes, and after a moment of contemplation, he spoke in a low voice:

"I have spent years cultivating overseas and have had little contact with the Golden Oneness. As for Daoist Master Tianque, this old man is not acquainted with him either; I have only heard of his profound mastery of True Fire..."

"Oh?"

Li Jiangqian said with a frown:

"If that is the case, does the old Daoist Master know why the Golden Oneness sought this fire?"

Ji An shook his head, a hint of confusion in his eyes, only to see the young man before him also shake his head and sigh.

"How could the great Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition possibly be lacking a Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire, to the point where they must come to the lake to request it."

The old Daoist Master was taken aback, still somewhat puzzled, and asked:

"They asked for it directly?"

Seeing that the man did not grasp the significance of this True Fire, Li Jiangqian said:

"The Golden Feather Sect offered a secret art of their Dao in exchange. It's just that the matter was sudden and the timing coincidental. The agreement was made some time ago, but because my elder was in the middle of refining pills, it was delayed. The term was set for five years, and now a little over two years remain."

"But if you calculate the timing, the True Fire is to be returned right around when my great-granduncle is scheduled to emerge from seclusion after healing his injuries. This has made me somewhat suspicious. You, old Daoist Master, are also a lofty cultivator of the fire element, which is why I ask."

He paused before changing the subject:

"Putting my great-granduncle's injuries aside, now that he has lost his treasured flame, even if he recovers, I'm afraid it won't be easy for him to refine pills for you... This junior has a suggestion. Why don't you, senior, take the time to go and borrow a spiritual flame? That way, you won't be waiting in vain."

"This..."

Ji An was at a loss for words for a moment.

"Spiritual flames are precious and not lent out easily... Who should I ask to borrow one from?"

"Naturally, you should ask a great Daoist tradition that does not consider spiritual flames to be so precious. Only then can you borrow one with peace of mind, without fear of it being lost."

Ji An set down his cup and said with focus:

"Which great Daoist tradition?"

Li Jiangqian's expression was calm as he said:

"The Golden Oneness."

With those words, Ji An finally understood, and his heart trembled.

'This boy... he's so suspicious. He calculated that the time the Golden Feather Sect wants the True Fire is precisely when the pill is to be refined for me, so he suspects they don't want his Li Clan to refine it. That's why they've taken the True Fire, and why he's pointing me in their direction, to set his own mind at ease!'

Ji An truly hadn't considered it from that angle, but Li Jiangqian's words were clear, and for a moment he couldn't figure it out either:

'I have no dealings with the Golden Oneness, so they shouldn't be targeting me... but... how could a tradition as magnificent as the Golden Oneness possibly lack this one flame? Why would they have to forcibly take it from the greater Bright Yang situation?'

For a moment, the old Daoist Master was truly stuck, his expression shifting as he gripped his cup.

'Could it be due to the conflict between the True and Li Daos?'

But after pondering for a moment, he grew doubtful.

'That can't be right. I cultivate Radiant Fire. How could that possibly obstruct their great Dao of True Fire?'

The old Daoist Master, caught in a web of uncertainty, frowned and asked:

"Allow me to ask one sincere question: did the Golden Oneness ask your clan for the True Fire, or did your clan ask the Golden Oneness for the secret art?"

The old Daoist Master's question was precise, doubting whether the Golden Oneness truly needed the fire. Yet the young man before him became even more serious, raising a hand and saying:

"There is absolutely no falsehood! This True Fire was specifically requested by the Golden Oneness! They only said it would be useful to them. If my clan had initiated the trade, why would we hand over the very tool our own elder uses for pill refinement? Senior, you are overthinking this!"

"That's true."

Ji An averted his gaze and said softly:

"I understand."

He lowered his head grimly.

"I will find an opportunity to visit the Golden Oneness!"

Li Jiangqian nodded with a smile, saying seriously:

"Then I must trouble you, senior."

Ji An was rather sullen. He showed no hint of a smile at the thanks, his expression grimâ€”if the Golden Feather Sect lent him the flame, the suspicion would naturally be cleared. But what if they refused? The Li Clan would likely find another excuse to back out of their agreement!

Unexpectedly, the young man's smile did not waver as he said:

"Rest assured, senior. This is not about resolving my clan's concerns, but about easing the worries on your own Dao path. If the Golden Oneness is willing to lend you the flame, it will be a joyous outcome for all. If they are unwilling, since my great-granduncle has already made a promise, he will surely do everything in his power to refine this pill for you!"

Ji An's expression changed, finally showing genuine delight.

"Is that truly so!"

Li Jiangqian gave a wry smile.

"Senior, you are not unaware of my great-granduncle's character... He took on the massive mess left by the Profound Peak Gate all those years ago. Since he has given his word, how could we juniors possibly stop him!"

Ji An naturally trusted Li Ximing's reputation. His face cleared like clouds after a storm, and he nodded repeatedly. Li Jiangqian then said seriously:

"As for the Golden Oneness, you must handle it yourself, senior! If you do borrow the flame, perhaps ask for an extra three to five years, to account for any changes in schedule!"

"I understand!"

Ji An was, after all, a Daoist Master who had cultivated for many years. He was perfectly clear about his own capabilities and whether he was obstructing another's Quest for Gold. It was only the immense reputation of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition that made him a little apprehensive. He simply said:

"Rest assured. I will make some preparations, then go and ask!"

He paused for a moment, then smiled.

"I understand that your clan's circumstances can be difficult... That is why I waited so long for Western Shu's army to return before coming to the lake. But I must also ask you two to understand this old man's predicament..."

After speaking, the old Daoist Master immediately rose up on a plume of fire and vanished into the Great Void. Though he was once again leaving without a finished pill, this time he was not filled with disappointment, and his focus was no longer on Li Ximing.

Li Jiangqian remained seated at the table. He took a sip of tea, set the cup down, and stared into the half-filled cup of clear liquid with his golden eyes.

'This way, by shifting the problem to him, my clan won't have to worry about a flame for pill refinement for a short while...'

He knew, of course, that there was a ninety-nine percent chance the matter of the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire had nothing to do with Ji An; it was merely a bluff. A strange look in his eyes, he recalled the old Daoist Master's parting words and sighed internally:

'He's been a rogue cultivator for many years, after all. The old fellow is still sharp. I had thought that if the Golden Feather Sect was unwilling to lend him the flame, I could pretend my clan was acting in his favor despite the risks, and use the opportunity to earn a favor. But seeing he has his own resources and is unwilling to trust blindly, he agreed to this now for two reasons. First, the timing is indeed a coincidence, and sounding out the Golden Oneness is the safer bet. Second, he has already handed over the spiritual items and artifacts to my clan. As long as we don't go back on our word and make excuses, he is willing to endure a few more troubles.'

'These old foxes are hard to fool. He's half-believing, half-doubting, and just using this as an excuse so both sides can save face.'

Having calmly dealt with the Daoist Master, he sat in his seat, then paced a few steps with his hands behind his back.

'Now that most matters are settled, I can bring up my previous suspicions.'

The crimson-robed Daoist Master stood on the mountain, looking at the mountain of clan records that had been brought up long ago. He picked one up, rubbing it in his hand for a moment, the light in his eyes flickering as he said quietly:

"First, have Suining come see me."

This voice, laced with a divine ability, flew down through the Great Void and landed in the great hall within the formation. In a short while, the sound of hurried footsteps was heard as Li Jiangzong arrived before the hall and bowed respectfully.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Although the two were clan brothers, once a divine ability was achieved, one's status became immensely precious. Barring any major events, it was proper to address him with a title. Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow and smiled.

"Where is he?"

Li Jiangzong quickly replied:

"Senior Liu finished inspecting the grand formation and only came to the lake today to chat with the old master. Suining is attending to him. They are all on the island. I've already sent someone to inquire..."

"Oh!"

Since Li Suining had taken a Daoist Master as his teacher, Li Jiangzong couldn't just summon him away from his Purple Mansion Realm master. Li Jiangqian waved his hand, a small smile appearing on his face.

"I'll go over myself, as it happens."

...

"Li Xixuan..."

The sky above the lake island was bright, and sunlight like liquid gold spilled across the steps. A Daoist Master dressed in fur robes stood in the hall, nodding thoughtfully.

"So... he is Yuanwan's descendant!"

"Indeed!"

The old man sitting opposite him had a kind face. He nodded gently and said:

"Yuanwan's branch has many descendants, but not many cultivators. All these years... Suining and his younger brother are considered the most outstanding..."

The young man standing to the side nodded in agreement, while Liu Changdie stroked his beard and said:

"Xixuan... I recall he was ranked eleventh... Looking at Suining, he must also be a capable person."

His words hit a sore spot. Li Xuanxuan was momentarily speechless before shaking his head.

"He's a scheming child, and did quite well in his early years. Unfortunately... he later made some mistakes and was punished for a time, which led to the several branches under him splitting completely, with no contact between them."

Li Xuanxuan was actually a little puzzledâ€”this Daoist Master paid no attention to anything else, but took a unique interest in inquiring about the lives of early Li clan members. Li Yuanwan was a mere mortal and logically should never have caught the eye of a cultivator who only visited the lake once every few decades, yet he seemed to know him well.

Li Yuanwan was one thing; perhaps Li Yuanjiao had mentioned him in passing. But then the topic shifted to Li Xixuan. He was Li Suining's ancestor, true, but he had absolutely no connection to Liu Changdie!

Liu Changdie, however, had a complex expression. After a few brief inquiries, he already had an answer in his heart and sighed inwardly:

'In his previous life, Xixuan went out to govern several towns in Eastern Yue, assisting the King of Eastern Yue and placing his own trusted men. Although he was dragged down by that good-for-nothing son of his, he managed clan affairs in an orderly and diligent manner, eventually dying of illness while in office. Yuanjiao was quite regretful... I never thought... that in this life, the Li Clan would develop so rapidly, allowing him to break away and live out his old age on the lake in peace, only to end up like this...'

With the example of the previous life, even though the other party considered it a shameful matter and barely mentioned Li Chengzai, he had guessed much of the story. His heart was filled with complex emotions as he sighed:

"Sometimes, when your children truly are worthless, no amount of help will do any good. You only risk your own reputation in your later years!"

His words made Li Suining, who was standing to the side, shift his gaze, a flash of understanding in his eyes. He was a perceptive person and sighed inwardly:

'Master's previous life as a Heavenly Element must have been here on the lake...'

He glanced at Liu Changdie's expression, but as a divine ability was a venerable thing, he couldn't stare. He quickly lowered his head, listening as Li Xuanxuan sighed:

"Compared to that, my own wastrel of a son seems much less worrisome!"

Liu Changdie didn't quite understand but nodded in agreement. Suddenly, a streak of Li-Light swept into the hall, materializing into the figure of a young man who walked in with a smile.

"You two elders are enjoying your leisure!"

Hearing the voice, Li Suining immediately bowed. As expected, he saw Li Jiangqian take a seat, shaking his head with a smile. Liu Changdie, however, laughed.

"An old man worries about the battle in the great desert but has no detailed news. I returned from patrolling the desert, leaving Daoist Friend Juexi to stand guard, and made a special trip to ease some worries."

"The failure is mine."

Although Yin Juexi was completely dedicated, he was clearly not as trustworthy as Liu Changdie at the moment. After returning from a fruitless search for someone at sea, the Daoist Master had been sent by Li Jiangqian to guard the formation in the west, which freed up a great deal of Liu Changdie's time.

Li Jiangqian offered an apology, then smiled.

"I've been busy with various matters these past few days and have been organizing the clan records. I've only just freed my hands, so I came to pay my respects to the old master."

He looked at Li Suining and said warmly:

"Suining, your cultivation is already quite high. Do you have any plans for the future?"

Li Suining quickly bowed and replied:

"I will follow the clan's arrangements."

Li Jiangqian sighed.

"This Heavenâ€“Governing spiritual item is not easy to find!"

Li Suining sighed inwardly.

A Heavenâ€“Governing spiritual item was more than just difficult to find; it was practically impossible. The only Heavenâ€“Governing treasure in all of Jiangnan was being guarded like a precious jewel by Western Shu...

'Fortunately, since I've decided to enter the mystic realm and follow the path of my previous life, I can save the trouble of finding this spiritual item...'

If Li Zhouwei had been the one to ask, Li Suining would have certainly mentioned that there was no need to search any longer. But with outsiders like Liu Changdie present, for various reasons, he ultimately remained silent. He then saw Li Jiangqian smile.

"However... this matter need not be too troublesome. Sometimes things fall into place naturally. But I heard from Senior Liu that your Dao-Profundity in formations is already extremely formidable..."

Liu Changdie nodded in praise.

"Far from ordinary... When I was at the Foundation Establishment Realm, I fear I was his inferior."

Li Jiangqian understood the implication and smiled.

"I heard that back when he was at the Embyronic Breathing stage, he would try to set up formations even without any flags..."

Li Suining felt a slight jolt in his heart. Liu Changdie's brow twitched, his expression turning grave as if in deep thought. The great hall fell silent for a moment. Daoist Master Yuanbian chose his words carefully and said with a smile:

"This is the first I've heard of it as well."

"Ahem..."

Li Xuanxuan coughed twice, seeming somewhat tired.

"Since Jiangqian is here, I still have matters to discuss. I've disturbed Daoist Master Liu long enough today, and Suining also needs to cultivate..."

Liu Changdie simply assumed he was tired and immediately rose to take his leave. Li Suining also withdrew. Li Jiangqian said nothing more, only retracting his gaze from the junior, his eyes faintly reflecting a silver glint that was now vanishing. He smiled.

"Old master... do you have any instructions?"

Li Xuanxuan sighed and said naturally:

"I heard you discussed a matter concerning the Chen Clan?"

Li Jiangqian's expression grew focused. He nodded.

"That is correct."

This time, Chen Yin hadn't even gone to his own Yuyang Prefecture first, but had rushed to the lake to provide aid. His intentions were clear, and Li Jiangqian truly appreciated the gesture. Otherwise, he wouldn't have swallowed his pride and asked Liu Changdie to assist him.

Furthermore, with the shadow of the Xiao Clan faintly behind the Chen Clan, he was even more sincere. His previously wavering thoughts now leaned in a certain direction. He asked:

"What is this person like?"

The old man nodded.

"After you agreed, the Chen Clan sent someone over a few days later to cultivate on the lake. His name is Chen Yuanzhuo. He has a steady temperament. I have met him, and he is quite likable."

"Is that so?"

Li Jiangqian was slightly surprisedâ€”the Li Clan did not have many political marriages, and over the years, the old master had been dissatisfied with most of the marriage contracts for the direct descendants. To receive such an evaluation from Li Xuanxuan was extremely rare!

Li Xuanxuan nodded with a smile and sent someone to invite the young man over, while saying in a low voice:

"As for Yusui, you have not met her, so you do not know her temperament. It is completely different from her brother's!"

"How is it different?"

Li Jiangqian asked with a smile. Li Xuanxuan shook his head.

"As gentle and yielding as water. Fortunately, she is a girl. She should be matched with someone of a stronger character, so she won't suffer unseen bullying after marrying out."

The words were subtle, but Li Jiangqian understood. Good and bad were sometimes a matter of perspective. In a woman, it was gentleness like water; in a man, it would be considered weak and disappointing.

Within the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, a young man and a young woman had entered the great hall. The man was dressed in blue robes, his cheeks slightly thin. He could not be called handsome, but his gaze was steady, and he appeared resolute and brave. He bowed before the great hall.

"Greetings, Daoist Master, Master!"

Li Jiangqian glanced at him once, then his smiling gaze skipped over his face and landed on the woman behind him.

When Li Yusui came to the lake, Li Jiangqian had still been in seclusion seeking the Dao. In the years that followed, he had not had a moment of free time, so this was his first time truly seeing her. The woman was dressed in a white skirt, her wrists slender. She knelt on the ground like a boneless willow, her head lowered reservedly. Judging by her cultivation aura, her talent was not particularly outstanding compared to her brother's.

The old man's judgment was sharp, which made Li Jiangqian nod to himself, a peculiar thought arising in his eyes:

'Could this be the influence of Bright Yang? First, there is a brilliant and martial older brother, and then a gentle and frail younger sister. Perhaps it's a correspondence in their fatesâ€”the yang is ascendant while the yin declines!'

He was lost in thought, then smiled and greeted them. He watched as the white-robed woman lifted her brilliant golden eyes, then he nodded and turned to question Chen Yuanzhuo. After just a few sentences, he found that the young man's responses were appropriate and he showed no signs of panic, which made him nod in approval.

'The Chen Clan has sent over their future pillar!'

'It makes sense. This was an opportunity Chen Yin risked his life as a Daoist Master to secure. Naturally, he wouldn't waste it because of a junior. He would send the most outstanding member of the entire clan. As long as this marriage can be settled, it will protect the Chen Clan for at least the next few crucial decades during the transition between the old and new generations!'

With a single glance, he understood the situation and smiled.

"It is often said that the eldest brother is like a father. Have you met Suihuan?"

Li Xuanxuan sighed.

"They have met. He finds Yuanzhuo acceptable, but he doesn't like her marrying so far away."

With these words, the matter was essentially settled. Li Jiangqian smiled and shook his head.

"Ordinarily, you should meet her father, but he is currently in seclusion at a critical juncture and cannot be disturbed... In that case, I will take matters into my own hands and agree to this on your behalf."

Joy immediately blossomed in Chen Yuanzhuo's eyes. Li Yusui's personality and temperament were top-notch. Most importantly, as a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, she was not at all overbearing but very docile. His Chen Clan was marrying up by associating with the Li Clan, and his greatest fear had been a domineering wife. Now, even that concern had become an advantage. How could he not be delighted?

Li Jiangqian's words paused there, his smile fading as he said quietly:

"But no matter what, she is my, Li Jiangqian's, niece, and the granddaughter of King Wei. I don't care if Li Jianglong looks after her or not. If she suffers any grievance in your Chen Clan, my Li Clan will be coming to you for an explanation."

These were not empty words from Li Jiangqian. Li Suihuan was extremely fond of Li Yusui. Merely for the sake of the future head of the Li Clan and the Bright Yang bloodline, Li Jiangqian could not afford to lose this face.

Chen Yuanzhuo simply bowed deeply.

"With the trust of the elders, I, Chen Yuanzhuo, swear I will not fail her! If she suffers any grievance, may I, Yuanzhuo, be swallowed by the mansion waters, suffer the blades of soldiers, and die without a burial place!"

He spoke these words loudly, causing Li Yusui's lowered head to lift slightly. Her golden eyes fixed on his profile. Li Xuanxuan took it all in, chuckled hoarsely, and said in a low voice:

"Nothing in life is ever certain. But with the friendship between our two families, do not let things reach a point where we all lose face."

Chen Yuanzhuo's expression was resolute as he said seriously:

"A true man cannot even protect his own wife and children, so what ability does he have to protect his clan! Old Ancestor need not say more. I will protect her completely."

These words made Li Jiangqian give him a second look before he lowered his head to sip his tea.

With the decision made, what followed were the trivial details of the wedding. Li Xuanxuan dismissed the two young people, a complex look in his eyes as he said:

"He's a good child... And those words were his to say."

The old man had experienced too much. This scene he was watching extended far beyond the people before him.

'But my Yuexiang had to run into that good-for-nothing from the Yuan Clan... If that Yuan Fuyao had even five or six tenths of this young man's character, things would not have become so ugly back then!'

He was already in his twilight years, clinging to life by a thread of miraculous power. Whenever he recalled past events, a sense of weariness would overcome him. He bowed his head and said no more, but Li Jiangqian had already risen and taken his leave.

He rode a streak of Li-Light and flew off, quickly returning to the mountainside. Li Jiangzong was still waiting there. Seeing him return so quickly, he bowed. He watched Li Jiangqian nod and sit down before saying softly:

"Does my clan brother still need me to summon Suining..."

"There's no need."

Li Jiangqian smiled.

"He has certainly gone into seclusion. You wouldn't find him even if you tried. There's no need to disturb him."

Li Jiangzong was bewildered but nodded hesitantly. His clan brother, a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, simply paced on the mountain with a smile and waved his hand, dismissing him.

After Li Jiangzong had hurried away, the youth in crimson robes sat in the main seat, the color in his eyes growing brighter.

'A sheet of silver light under the Spirit Probe... this is the first time... Can Father not see it... Can great-granduncle not see it? No, it is precisely because of this that they are protecting him, and the old master is covering for him as well... Now this is interesting...'

He stood with his hands behind his back.

'Among the Talisman Seed cultivators of my clan, we have always shared everything freely, never holding back secrets. In the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, we work as one. There is nothing worth hiding...'

'The only things that could be taboo to mention are the sun and moon themselves.'

The young man was exceptionally sharp. It was one thing when he hadn't paid this person any mind, but once suspicion took root and he seized upon a single doubt, he immediately began to probe silently. Almost all the questions in his heart now had a semblance of an answer:

'Before my breakthrough, Father went to the Western Sea... that's understandable. But he clearly needed to use a spell art to conceal things for me, yet three days before I came out of seclusion, Father was still meeting with Li Jiangxia... So precise... Heavenâ€“Governing...'

'The art used to conceal things for me might not have come from the Western Sea as I had guessed... And now, this Art of Demoting Yin that drives the use of all Supreme Yin spiritual items, Father never mentioned its origin... Could it be related?'

There was not a hint of anger in his eyes, but rather a sense of relief.

'Good.'

'This is very good.'

'The masters are not placing their pieces. With only Father fighting to carve out a sliver of radiance, relying on just us, we are smaller than ants in their eyes. When would we ever succeed!'
