# Chapter 1247: Homeward Bound

Simin.

The morning sun was brilliant, a sheet of flowing gold. Light streamed brightly through the imperial palace as the court assembly dispersed. Officials of all ranks, clad in vermillion and purple robes, descended the steps in pairs and trios, appearing minuscule on the overly broad palace stairs.

Beyond the vast main hall, they each stepped into the corridors. There, a middle-aged man of medium build could be seen. His clothes were magnificent, suggesting a man of high station and great power, yet his brows were knitted tightly in a look of deep worry.

He walked alone for a time before someone caught up from behind. The newcomer was a man of dignified bearing with handsome features, his golden eyes filled with a radiant light as he surveyed his surroundings. He drew alongside the older man and smiled.

"Greetings, Marquis of Anyang!"

Li Zhouluo started as if waking from a dream. A smile touched his lips.

"So, it's you, Suichu!"

This handsome young man was none other than Li Jiangxia's eldest son, Li Suichu!

He and his sister, born from the same womb, had both remained in the imperial capital with their father. They were granted official posts upon coming of age, and he, having just returned from an outing, appeared to be in high spirits.

"My rank is low, so I always stand in the outer hall. I was just waiting here for you to come out, Grand-uncle!"

Li Zhouluo was quite fond of the siblings. Their mother, Lady Zou, had raised them well. Though they did not cultivate at home, they were both exceptionally sensible. He shook his head and smiled.

"To my residence?"

"Yes!"

Li Suichu clearly had something on his mind. They walked out of the hall together and boarded Li Suichu's luxurious carriage. The elder leaned back into his seat, looked around, and let out a sigh.

Noticing Li Suichu's gaze, Li Zhouluo remarked with some emotion:

"The clan on the lake is managed with extreme austerity. I've long grown accustomed to it. I rarely use my own carriage; I always feel ill at ease when I do."

A hearty smile spread across Li Suichu's face. He said:

"I've long heard of the lake's reputation. Every time it's mentioned, I feel a sense of pride."

Li Zhouluo knew that the one Li Suichu admired most was his own grandfather—a man he had only met once. With his world-shaking achievements and astonishing divine abilities, who could fail to feel respect? Li Zhouluo said leisurely:

"In the early years of our family, several of the elders were exceptionally frugal. The younger generations dared not live more lavishly than them, so they followed suit. Over generations, this gradually became a habit…"

Li Zhouluo had lived in the imperial capital for decades, and his mannerisms were already a world away from what they once were, but occasional reminiscence still filled his heart with emotion.

Li Suichu held a mysterious and wistful fantasy about his ancestral home far to the north. Whenever he heard such stories, he couldn't help but fall into deep thought. He was about to ask another question when he realized the carriage had stopped. A servant from Li Zhouluo's residence had already come forward to lift the curtain.

'Right beside the imperial palace… very few in the entire capital enjoy such a privilege…'

Li Suichu sighed to himself, following the elder down from the carriage. They crossed a courtyard and entered a rear chamber flanked by pine and cypress trees. He heard the tinkling sound of water; a pond had been built, its surface clear and transparent. A man in white robes sat by its edge, meticulously observing a spell art.

"Uncle!"

Li Suichu called out with enthusiasm. The young man before him looked up, a hint of a smile in his eyes.

"Suichu, you're here!"

This man was Li Jiangchun!

This sword immortal had just retracted his spell art. The aura around him was palpable—complete and perfect, pure as snow, yet holding the sublime mystery of intertwining water and fire. Li Suichu was greatly shaken. He sighed in admiration,

"Congratulations on perfecting your cultivation, Uncle!"

This was clearly not a recent development. Li Zhouluo chuckled and shook his head, while Li Jiangchun reined in his aura and smiled.

"It's merely the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. What's that to speak of?"

Compared to the vast majority of cultivators in Jiangnan, his cultivation speed was naturally astonishing. Yet, Li Jiangchun knew in his heart:

'My family has Talisman Pills and Talisman Qi. Our cultivation is inherently much faster than others. I must cultivate this supreme spell art and also nurture a second Sword Origin. Compared to my two elder siblings back home, my pace is not fast at all!'

Li Suichu understood his general meaning. He shook his head and sighed.

"True. Our family carries the noble blood of the Wei Emperor, a Golden Core lineage. The four on the lake with divine abilities all reached the Purple Mansion Realm in less than a century…"

Li Jiangchun smiled but remained silent.

'The Purple Mansion Realm is only the first step. After reaching it, aided by multiple streams of Talisman Qi, my family's cultivation speed will become even faster…'

Li Suichu quickly changed the subject, saying:

"I came today because there is indeed a matter I wish to consult you elders about."

He said seriously:

"Elders, you have resided in the imperial capital for many years. You must know that the Lin family met with my father once, and there was some talk of marriage."

Li Zhouluo nodded, a curious expression on his face. He said:

"Of course, I know of this. Caiyin is your childhood friend, and he and your sister grew up together as innocent sweethearts. We all saw it. This… was a match made in heaven… there's not much more to be said."

Li Suichu nodded hastily, saying:

"But the problem is… the matter was settled verbally between my father and Elder Lin. If we're being precise, there's no formal basis for the betrothal…"

A flicker of worry crossed his eyes as he sighed.

"Father is in seclusion, and we don't know when he'll emerge. Little Sister is already over twenty. Caiyin wants to propose, but he doesn't know how to proceed. The longer this drags on, the more anxious I, as her elder brother, become."

Understanding dawned on Li Zhouluo. He smiled.

"I understand!"

Li Suichu nodded and cupped his fist.

"I must ask you, elders, to step in!"

Li Jiangchun had been listening quietly the whole time. Only now did he speak, choosing his words carefully.

"This matter… has your father informed the lake?"

The question gave Li Suichu pause. He pondered for a moment before replying:

"This… as for whether Father has mentioned it, it's not for me to guess."

Li Jiangchun's mind stirred.

Great Xiukui Monastery was a well-known righteous sect. They had rendered the Li clan much aid in the early years, and three of their Daoist Masters had died as martyrs for the Dao—a fact that even earned the Song Emperor's admiration. By his own judgment, if the Lin family wished to befriend the Li clan, the lake would surely be in great agreement.

This was his father's thinking as well, but Li Jiangchun was unwilling to agree so readily.

'Regardless, the command should come from the lake.'

He said softly:

"This is, after all, a marriage concerning the main family line. Although Brother Jiangxia is in seclusion, Eldest Brother has already reached the Purple Mansion Realm. Be it in terms of prestige or status, he is more than sufficient."

'Daoist Master Changli…'

Li Suichu nodded thoughtfully, a look of pleasant surprise appearing in his eyes.

"Would it be too much trouble for his esteemed self…"

Li Zhouluo added his support:

"The Xiukui are a major Dao Gate. With four Purple Mansion cultivators on the lake now, having one of them handle this matter would show ample respect."

He smiled.

"Didn't the Chen Clan's marriage contract also pass through his hands? Your sister's standing should be no less than hers!"

As an elder brother, Li Suichu naturally wanted his sister's wedding to be a grand affair. Especially concerning the dowry, with his father in seclusion, he would need the lake's assistance. This new plan solved both problems at once. He was delighted and bowed, saying:

"Then I will ask the elders to contact the family. I shall go give my sister the good news… and let the Lin family know to prepare!"

Li Zhouluo nodded. Watching him depart, he sighed.

"In the blink of an eye… they're all grown up! Even their marriage contracts are now being discussed."

Li Jiangchun smiled but said nothing. Li Zhouluo had no choice but to change the subject, and the worry returned to his brow.

"That Second Highness has requested a sword duel for the fourth time. The Emperor doesn't stop him, just lets him cause trouble…"

The only person who could vex Li Zhouluo so was that Second Highness, Yang Jiong!

The prince was fine in all other respects; his only obsession was the sword. Every time he lost to Li Jiangchun, he would depart with great solemnity and enter seclusion to meditate on his loss. Sometimes it was for a year, sometimes three. As soon as he gained some new insight, he would immediately emerge and cause all sorts of trouble, just to demand another duel!

Li Zhouluo could not comprehend this behavior at all.

'At the same age, the First Highness can already be dispatched to govern regions, and the Third Highness's cultivation is advancing at a shocking pace… yet Yang Jiong is still just playing with swords!'

Playing with swords would have been one thing, and Li Zhouluo never wanted to get involved. But the prince could never be reasoned with. He insisted on being provocative, stirring up trouble to get a rise out of Li Jiangchun, and wouldn't stop until he'd been taught a lesson…

The result was that rumors of discord between Second Highness Yang Jiong and the Li clan ran rampant, spreading ever wider. And what was the Li clan's status today!

'My Li family already holds immense power at court. Never mind the old guard; even among the Holder of the Profound, the newly promoted Sima Xunhui and Chen Wenyao… one is Queyi's husband, the other is Jiangliang's subordinate. And old Daoist Master Chen is constantly trying to curry favor with the Li clan…'

'Anyone with half a brain knows they should be trying to befriend the Li clan!'

In contrast, his rival, the First Prince, had always been courteous to the Li family. While he couldn't form an overt alliance, he took every opportunity to speak warmly with Li Zhouluo, appearing exceptionally amiable.

As a result, though no one was openly taking sides, almost no major powers were willing to back Yang Jiong. The situation escalated, and now Li Zhouluo was truly at his wit's end…

He paced around the residence several times, shaking his head in disbelief.

"Could the rumors be true… that he has no intention of vying for the throne and is deliberately debasing himself?"

In fact, after years of these repeated disputes, Li Jiangchun had grown more familiar with the Second Highness. There was no trace of worry in his eyes as he spoke.

"At least he has a heart that diligently seeks the Way of the Sword."

He looked down. The water in the pond before him was clear and transparent. At the bottom, a sword's light flickered, and the faint glimmer of an azure blade could be seen.

"Whatever his motives, his Way of the Sword has progressed immensely over the years… He relies on all sorts of tricks, but his heart is more sincere than the other one's."

Li Zhouluo gave a bitter smile.

"I don't want to be involved, but his antics make it seem like we are."

Li Jiangchun was about to reply when he felt a sudden warmth in his sleeve. His expression shifted slightly. He stood, but before he could take a step, a servant rushed up, bowing before the hall.

"Master! Someone from the lake has arrived!"

Li Zhouluo's face paled.

For so many years, he had always been the one to write letters to Moongaze Lake, sent via a dedicated messenger. Never before had someone from Moongaze Lake come openly, in the capacity of the Li clan, to seek an audience at his Anyang Residence!

This sudden development startled him.

'What great matter could possibly warrant such a formal summons!'

His thoughts flew to his elder brother, who had been grievously injured for many years and had not been seen since. His heart sank to the depths. He cast a panicked glance at his son, but Li Jiangchun just shook his head silently.

'Impossible…'

'Then could it be…'

Watching his eldest son rush out, Li Zhouluo's eyes stung.

'The Old Master?'

He followed close behind and saw an old man standing in the residence. He had a full head of white hair and a tall frame, but his eyes were full of vigor. One could faintly discern a gentle and magnanimous air about him. His cultivation was only at the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm, and several cultivators stood behind him.

Li Jiangchun glanced at their attire and relaxed slightly.

"Elder White Ape!"

This was the human form of the White Ape. Since being rescued from a fire vein by Li Xuanxuan, the old ape had served diligently on the lake for a hundred years. When the Li were just a lakeside clan, he was a minor demon who tended to the spirit plants. Now, he was a highly regarded old retainer, yet his attitude had never changed. He bowed with gentle humility.

"This old slave greets the Young Master."

Li Jiangchun quickly helped him up as the old demon spoke in a deep voice:

"The Daoist Master has emerged from seclusion. He has summoned you several times… he hopes the Young Master will embark at once to return to the lake and visit."

Li Jiangchun gave him a long look and asked in a low voice:

"Must I tender my resignation to the Emperor before I leave?"

The old demon lowered his head and replied:

"The Daoist Master said… there is no need for such fuss. Depart immediately. After you have met with him, you will need to return here once more."

Milin Prefecture.

The plains were vast, teeming with cultivators. In the center of this plain, several peaks clustered together to form a mountain. The spiritual qi here was strong, but the earth veins were not deep. It was a place where a clan could prosper, but it lacked the foundation for a divine ability user to establish their own sect.

Yet, it was upon this very immortal mountain that spiritual qi now billowed. Currents of spiritual rhyme flowed and intertwined, coalescing into a tangible ocean of energy. One by one, cultivators raised their heads and exchanged shocked glances.

In that instant, the dense spiritual qi that supplied the entire mountain range was drained dry. Countless cultivators were jolted from their meditation, only then realizing that the spiritual qi was flowing in a profound manner toward the mountain's depths…

"Dong…"

Within a cave dwelling deep inside the mountain, a man in a brocade robe slowly opened his eyes. His pupils reflected the golden stone that circled his body. He raised a sleeve, his heart filled with shock.

In his palm, a speck of impossibly brilliant golden light pulsed like a breath.

'Divine ability—Heavenly Harmonising Fullness!'

He, Liu Changdie, had perfected his first divine ability thirty years ago and had made no progress since. Yet, in less than five years, he had made a great leap forward and mastered this second Harmonising Metal divine ability…

'Five years… only five years. An ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator couldn't even fully cultivate an immortal foundation in that time, yet I have already obtained this divine ability… This is the Harmonising and Vault Lock!'

This was an utterly impossible speed. Liu Changdie himself suspected that not even King Wei—the one who gathered the fate of the Bright Yang and orchestrated the grand scheme to slay an emperor—could master a new divine ability in five years!

'Unless he was a reincarnated True Monarch!'

But that was not all. The moment Heavenly Harmonising Fullness was achieved, the Vault-Beam Silver in his Shengyang Acupoint flared with light. It resonated with Heavenly Harmonising Fullness, forming a tight bond. As if nourished, it grew even more brilliant and, in turn, began to nurture Heavenly Harmonising Fullness on its own.

The price, however, was equally painful.

Liu Changdie could clearly sense that his Shengyang Acupoint had now solidified to its absolute limit. If his Shengyang Mansion had once been a clear, free-flowing stream of living water, the locking of these two divine abilities had now forged it into a solid thing of metal, incapable of holding anything else.

He, Liu Changdie, could not even proactively nurture the newly forged Heavenly Harmonising Fullness, let alone raise an immortal foundation into his Shengyang Mansion!

'My path on the Great Dao… ends here!'
