# Chapter 691: Congratulations from the Great Clans

Standing firm in the clouds, Si Boxiu finished his congratulations. Li Ximing immediately clasped his hands in a formal salute.

“Our family has cultivated for a century under the shelter of the great sects,” he said softly. “Your own clan has offered much assistance, and for that we are grateful. My elder brother still serves within the sect. I hope that you will continue to look after him in the future, Senior.”

The complex emotions in Si Boxiu’s eyes remained, but his expression softened considerably. Li Ximing’s breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm was an undeniable fact. What more could be said? He could only sigh. “During the turmoil of the Chi clan’s reign, you were treated harshly,” he said in a conciliatory tone. “For that, I offer my apologies.”

Li Ximing gave a noncommittal reply, his tone still deferential. “You are too kind, Senior. I am not worthy of such words.”

As their exchange concluded, a crimson rune of parting light pierced through the Great Void, materializing in the sky. The light pulsed, coalescing into shimmering motes that formed the figure of a man with thick eyebrows. He wore a wide-sleeved robe with a crossed collar, the edges embroidered with dense patterns of parting light runes. His features were open and honest, his eyes large. He clasped his fists together loosely and announced in a resonant voice, “Hengli of the Hengzhu Immortal Dao, on behalf of my tradition, I offer you congratulations. May you find affinity with the five arts, may the golden lotus bloom with ease, may you transcend upon grasping the purple, and may your Intercalary Sun Art achieve perfection.”

This was Daoist Master Hengli of the Hengzhu Dao, one of the most renowned artifact refiners in Jiangnan. His personal appearance was a clear sign of the Hengzhu Dao’s sincerity. Li Ximing had long heard of his reputation and did not take the gesture lightly. “I have long heard of your esteemed name, Senior,” he replied, returning the salute. “You truly live up to your reputation.”

Hengli let out a low chuckle and nodded. “The Nine-Colored Profound Mercury you entrusted to us has been kept safe. Now that you have reached the Purple Mansion Realm, I have already dispatched someone to deliver it. They are on their way.”

Li Ximing understood that he was referring to the Purple Mansion spiritual item obtained from Wang Fu and responded graciously. Just then, a streak of golden light appeared to the west, revealing a powerfully built man with broad shoulders. He shot a cold glare at Hengli before turning to Li Ximing.

“I am Tianque of the Golden Feather Sect. I come on behalf of my sect to congratulate Daoist Master Zhaojing. May your divine powers be honed through a hundred refinements, may your righteous arts never falter, may your light illuminate the cosmos, and may you attain your true nature!”

These two Daoist Masters were both skilled in combat, and it was well known they did not get along. Li Ximing quickly interjected, saying softly, “The Golden Feather Sect and my ancestors were on good terms. Your presence brings light to my humble home.”

After Daoist Master Tianque nodded, a tall, slender man in shamanistic robes appeared in the clouds. His expression was placid, his gaze distant. He gave a casual salute. “Houfu of the Great Xiukui Monastry, here to offer congratulations.”

Though the Great Xiukui Monastry was considered a righteous path, its traditions were strange and esoteric, and its members rarely socialized. Houfu’s appearance was a gesture of respect for the Li family’s upstanding conduct. The moment Li Ximing acknowledged him, Houfu dissolved into a puff of black smoke and vanished.

Immediately after, a middle-aged man with a sword on his back offered his own salute, his tone relatively mild. “I am Cheng Jiuwen, representing the Sword Gate. If you have the opportunity, you are welcome to visit us.”

The Sword Gate and the Xiukui Monastry were famously aloof. The middle-aged man seemed to hold the current proceedings in disdain. As soon as Li Ximing returned his salute, he vanished back into the Great Void.

Once the man from the Sword Gate had departed, a Daoist-robed man with a kind and gentle face and willow-leaf eyes appeared with a smile. “I am Changxiao, here to congratulate Daoist Master Zhaojing!”

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. The man’s face held no trace of hostility, only a warm, beaming smile. But Li Ximing knew better than to trust him. Not only was this man notoriously difficult to deal with, but the Radiant Sky Stone essential for Li Ximing’s breakthrough had been obtained from the Changxiao Sect.

‘Back then, it was a game played by many cultivators,’ he thought, his mind racing. ‘The Changxiao Sect paid a price, but with their key members confined to the sect, Changxiao used the Radiant Sky Stone as bait to outmaneuver the Hengzhu Dao and keep Tu Longjian from taking a side… Our family just got lucky. But who knows what this old fox is really thinking?’

Though wary, he maintained a polite facade and responded cordially. Changxiao’s voice was deep and resonant. “Daoist Master Zimu of the Purple Smoke Gate is in seclusion, and the other master is of your generation. She is out searching for the reincarnation of Zipei and could not attend. Please do not take offense.”

He spoke as if he were on intimate terms with the Purple Smoke Gate, which gave Li Ximing pause. He offered a polite reply, and after a moment, the few remaining figures who had not shown themselves in the Great Void—including Xiao Chuting—saluted from their concealment and disappeared.

Si Boxiu was the last to leave. He had remained behind, his eyes fixed on the celestial gate in the sky. With his hands clasped behind his back, he seemed to have finally sorted through his thoughts. He gave Li Ximing a slight smile before finally departing.

The celestial light behind Li Ximing receded back into the space between his brows. The rainbow clouds in the sky faded, and the glittering celestial gate dissolved into nothingness. He descended to the surface of the lake, where over a million pairs of eyes watched him.

“We pay our respects to the Daoist Master!”

Li Chenghui was the first to step forward, so overcome with excitement and joy that his eyes were red. He bowed deeply. An Siwei and the others lowered their heads, not daring to meet his gaze, as they held the attendants who had arrived with Zaixingzi.

Li Ximing gestured for Li Chenghui to rise. He brought two fingers together and held them an inch from his lips. His pale golden eyes flashed as he blew out gently.

*Hooo…*

A rain of bright light fell from the sky, finally suppressing the purple flames that had been burning ceaselessly on Mount Wu. The flames twisted like living things, burrowing down through the earth veins and into the mountain’s core. The Baleful Earth spring was filled with the purple fire, and now it emanated a faint purple baleful energy, occasionally spitting out a lick of violet flame. It had clearly undergone a new transformation.

Having quelled the flames, Li Ximing smiled. “I was uncertain of the situation when I broke through and didn’t want others to know. I feared that if I told you, a powerful cultivator might overhear, so I went to see Daoist Master Chuting first and have only just returned.”

“It wasn’t exactly luring a snake from its hole, but we did manage to catch one or two.”

Li Chenghui bowed respectfully, the elation in his heart still so strong it left him feeling dizzy. ‘Our family has a Purple Mansion cultivator? We’re a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan?!’

Everyone stared at Li Ximing, their excitement palpable. His gaze fell upon the cultivators from the Three Sects of Mount Xiaoshi. They were pale with terror, having fainted several times already. They didn’t dare look at him, fearing his gaze alone could kill them.

The jade box still hovered in the air. Li Ximing gave a cold smile. “Chenghui, take a look at the gift from the Three Sects.”

Li Chenghui understood immediately. He gently opened the box. Inside lay a round, white object that looked eerily like an eyeball, radiating a chilling aura.

His voice was not loud, but it was hard and cold. “The Floating Cloud Cave of the Three Sects of Mount Xiaoshi presents a Lesser Yin spiritual item: the Falcon Yin Pearl.”

The men collapsed again, held up only by the spiritual qi of their Foundation Establishment captors. Across the lake, every gaze fell on them like a sword. ‘A Bright Yang cultivator breaks through, forges a divine power, and becomes a Daoist Master, and you dare to present a Lesser Yin spiritual item as a congratulatory gift? The meaning could not be more obvious. Zaixingzi got what he deserved!’ An Siwei’s anger had yet to fade, and he silently cheered.

Li Ximing smiled faintly. “Chenghui,” he said calmly, “return their gift and let them go.”

He turned his face toward the men, who were so frightened they could only stare at the ground, their souls nearly leaving their bodies. They could feel the celestial light from Li Ximing’s brow shining down on them, hot as a blazing sun, and sweat poured from their bodies like rain.

“Within three days, the Floating Cloud Cave—or the Three Sects—will give me, Zhaojing, an explanation.”

An Siwei released them. The Qi Refining cultivators, never imagining they would be allowed to live, began to kowtow and wail. A glare from Chen Yang sent them scrambling to their feet, and they flew off toward their sect on shaky gusts of wind.

“The Daoist Master is truly benevolent,” Li Chenghui said, staring coldly at their retreating figures. “They got off easy.”

He was right. Li Ximing’s actions were incredibly magnanimous. As a Purple Mansion Daoist Master who had been so gravely insulted by Foundation Establishment cultivators, he could have struck them down without consequence. Even if Zaixingzi had been from one of the three great immortal sects of Yue, he would not have been spared unless he was a direct disciple, and another Daoist Master would still have had to come and apologize.

Li Ximing could have torn through the Great Void, appeared in the skies above the Three Sects, and rained down celestial light and endless purple flames, razing the entire Floating Cloud Cave to the ground, and it would have been considered perfectly reasonable. At most, some might have called him callous.

But Li Ximing was unfamiliar with the Three Sects and acted with caution. He had only just broken through and had yet to fully master his divine powers. Fearing a hidden trap, he chose not to act too ruthlessly. He let them go, forcing the Floating Cloud Cave to come to him and atone.

As he landed, Li Chenghui immediately reported in a low voice, “Daoist Master, the Golden Tang Gate is behind the Three Sects of Mount Xiaoshi… It’s a bit tricky.”

Li Ximing understood his nephew’s meaning. The Golden Tang Gate was already struggling to save itself. For a century, it had been plagued by internal strife, and the surrounding sects were not to be underestimated. Ever since the fall of the mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator from the Situ family, their sole remaining Purple Mansion, Situ Huo, could only wander the Southern Sea, not daring to return to the mainland. Rumor had it he was severely wounded by Yuan Su a few years ago, and his current condition was unknown.

“Situ Huo’s refusal to return is the only thing keeping the Golden Tang Gate alive, allowing it to cling to its existence in Jiangbei. It was only in recent years, with Situ Mo’s rise to power and the surge of spiritual qi in the region, that they have started to recover…”

“The spiritual qi of Jiangbei,” Li Chenghui continued, “was paid for with the lives of cultivators from both the north and south…”

As he was speaking, a flash of pale red light streaked across the northern sky. A wave of fire rolled across the lake before revealing the figure of a bright and beautiful woman.

“Minggong!”

It was Li Minggong. She wore a red dress and carried a sword, her face a mixture of disbelief and overwhelming joy. She landed before them, hurriedly bowing.

“Junior… pays respects to the Daoist Master!” As she spoke, her eyes welled up with tears. She choked back a sob before continuing, “Congratulations on forging your divine power, Seventh Uncle! I… I have passed my own trial of life and death and forged the Immortal Foundation: the Pheasant Li March!”

The Pheasant Li March allowed one to command the true fire of the pheasant, refining the five organs internally and all metals externally. One could hold the pheasant’s parting flame in one’s mouth to spit fire and baleful energy, and even take the form of a bird to ride the flames. The family’s fourth-grade *Long-March Pheasant Flame Art* had always been an excellent true fire tradition. That Li Minggong was the first to forge a true fire foundation was somewhat unexpected. Li Ximing was pleased.

“Excellent!” he said warmly.

Among the Foundation Establishment cultivators, Li Minggong was one of the closest to him, being Li Xuanxuan’s direct great-granddaughter. Li Ximing smiled and helped her up. “True fire is excellent for artifact refining. You should study it well. He Jiu’s lifespan is nearing its end, and we still have no one to watch over the family’s artifact refining peak, Mount Jiumen.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Where are Chengliao and Chenghuai?”

Li Minggong clasped her fist. “Reporting to the Daoist Master,” she said softly, “Elder Brother… he failed his breakthrough a few years ago…”

“Oh…”

Li Ximing paused, a look of regret on his face. Li Minggong and Li Chengliao had similar levels of talent, but Li Chengliao had possessed the best temperament. He had thought he would surely succeed, yet the one who entered seclusion first had been the one to fall.

‘Thinking back, managing the family took too much of his time… He always had to look after his brothers and sisters, and he spent too little effort on his own cultivation. Though his cultivation base was solid, how could it compare to his siblings, who tempered themselves a thousand times over in their daily practice?’

Li Ximing was silent for a moment. Five or six years had passed, and the family had mostly recovered. He sighed inwardly, not wishing to dwell on the painful memory. “And Chenghuai?”

Li Chenghuai was the most talented of the Chengming generation. A breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm should have been well within his grasp, but cultivation depended heavily on opportunity and even luck. It was impossible to be certain.

Li Minggong stood beside him. “He is still attempting his breakthrough.”

As they spoke, they landed on the island. Over a hundred thousand people looked up at the figure bathed in brilliant light. Li Ximing made a quick calculation with his fingers and frowned. “He’s late.”

Li Chenghui spoke respectfully. “According to Twenty-ninth Brother’s cultivation speed, he should have entered seclusion long ago. However, Clan Uncle Xizhi went to great expense within the sect to acquire a fourth-grade technique of a compatible element for him, the *Art of Concealed Profundity*. It’s said to be quite miraculous. He had Chenghuai convert his cultivation base before attempting the breakthrough, which caused a delay of five or six years.”

Li Ximing’s face broke into a broad smile. “Good! A fourth-grade technique makes all the difference.”

Listening to Li Chenghui’s explanation, he walked toward the center of the island under a bright sun and a sky full of auspicious clouds.

Li Xuanxuan approached, his face streaked with tears of joy. The old man’s lips trembled, and his hands shook as he reached out. He stared at his grandson for a long time before finally managing to speak two words.

“Ming’er!”

Li Ximing’s heart had been filled with a boundless sense of peace and relief, but those two words struck him with an indescribable poignancy. He closed his eyes. He stood motionless for several breaths before finally managing a choked reply.

“Grandfather! I have not failed you!”

In the endless illusions of his tribulation, he had been devoured by beasts, walked on mountains of blades and through seas of fire, had his chest torn open and his guts ripped out—he had endured it all without a single sound. Yet now, this simple greeting nearly brought him to tears.

He turned his head slightly. “Chenghui, in three months, the Three Sects and Seven Gates and all the great clans will send representatives. Go and make the preparations.”

Li Chenghui and Li Minggong understood at once. They took two steps back and quietly closed the doors, leaving the grand hall empty save for the grandfather and grandson.

Li Xuanxuan’s cloudy eyes were filled with tears. He stood frozen, staring at the radiant celestial light on Li Ximing’s brow. After what felt like an eternity, he closed his eyes, squeezing out two more tear tracks.

The old man smiled. “If I were to die now, I could face my second and third uncles… Ximing, you have brought us glory! If Yuanping and Yuanjiao could know of this in the netherworld, they would be overcome with joy…”
