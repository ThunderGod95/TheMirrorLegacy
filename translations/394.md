# Chapter 510: Situ Mo

Li Xizhi immediately sensed something was amiss, and stealthily approached while concealing his presence. He saw a group of villagers gathered around a low stone altar, where an old man in black stood, his face dark and sinister, holding a sword and muttering incessantly.

The villagers below began chanting as well, their voices growing louder and louder. Black mist spread across the altar, causing Li Xizhi to frown.

"A mere unrefined Qi Cultivator, yet he is putting on such a grand display!" Li Xizhi scoffed.

The black-robed old man had chaotic true essence and weak energy, a clear sign of his origins as a rogue cultivator. In the cultivation world of Yue State, such people were at the bottom of the hierarchy. Li Xizhi, being from a great sect, could see this clearly with just a glance.

Yin qi is everywhere... He must have acquired some kind of devil dao legacy and used it to deceive the villagers so he could conduct blood sacrifices.

As expected, the villagers below brought forward a young boy. The black-robed old man raised his sword, preparing to stab him in a ritual.

Li Xizhi watched on silently as the old man brought his sword down toward the boy, but when the blade touched the boy, it was as if it hit an iron wall‚Äîthere was a sharp metallic clang that rang out, and the sword could not move any further.

A flash of doubt crossed the old man's face. He scanned the surroundings with his spiritual sense but could not detect anything. How could a rogue cultivator like him see through the concealment technique of someone as skilled as Li Xizhi?

Finding nothing, the old man trembled and called out in a shaky voice, "Which Senior... is playing a joke on this humble one?"

Rainbow light began to shimmer around Li Xizhi as he revealed himself above the altar, staring at the old man. The black-robed elder took one look at him and was instantly terrified. He fell to his knees, trembling as he said, "This humble one is Yuan Huzhong... Greetings to you, immortal of the exalted sect!"

Li Xizhi's hand, glowing with rainbow light, was about to strike him, but those words made him pause. Frowning, he asked, "You recognize my attire? You must be quite knowledgeable. Which Yuan Family do you belong to?"

Yuan Huzhong, who was shaking all over now, replied, "I am originally from the Yuan Family of Mushroom Forest Plain, though I have not returned in many years..."

So, he is truly from the Yuan Family of Mushroom Forest Plain!

Li Xizhi felt a bit awkward since this devil cultivator was somehow connected to his master, Yuan Tuan. In a deep voice, he scolded, "Coming from such a great family, how dare you engage in such filthy deeds! You have utterly disgraced the Yuan Family!"

With a flick of his hand, a stream of multicolored light appeared, swirling and flickering like a mirage. With a swish, it snatched away both the sword and the pouch from Yuan Huzhong's waist.

This technique, called Floating Light Gathering, was recorded in the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique and was a Grade Four spell. It was particularly effective at seizing dharma artifacts and treasures. The multicolored light swept over everything cleanly, leaving Yuan Huzhong trembling with cold terror.

The villagers below craned their necks, thinking Li Xizhi had acted against the old man. They immediately broke into wails, begging for mercy, leaving Li Xizhi puzzled.

Li Xizhi examined Yuan Huzhong and, confirming that he was indeed from the Yuan Family, decided to be patient.

"Explain yourself!" he demanded.

Just as Yuan Huzhong was about to speak, black winds suddenly whipped through the air. A massive creature, the size of a house and covered in feathers, descended with a booming laugh, calling out evilly, "Daoist Yuan! How is this year's blood offering?"

Li Xizhi's feet were already surrounded by rainbow light. He scanned the creature with his spiritual sense and quickly realized it was merely a Qi Cultivation Realm demon at the fourth heavenly layer‚Äîfar weaker than him, who was in the sixth heavenly layer. Feeling confident, he stayed in place, studying the demon.

Yuan Huzhong, terrified, dared not reply. Instead, he shot the demon a look and muttered under his breath, "T-This... is a lord from the exalted Azure Pond Sect, Daoist Wu... Hurry up and pay your respects."

A member of the Azure Chi Devil Gate!

Daoist Wu was horrified, collapsing to the ground with a thud that shook the earth. His voice was muffled as he choked out, "This lowly demon greets the exalted immortal!"

Li Xizhi, someone who disliked unnecessary conflict, felt his head throb as the situation became more complicated. Waving his hand, he said, "I have important matters to attend to. Spare me trouble and explain everything quickly so I can be on my way!"

Yuan Huzhong hurriedly explained, "Lord, I truly am from the main branch of the Yuan Family, but my talent is lacking and I have only a single spiritual orifice... After thirty years of hard cultivation and many spirit resources, I have only reached the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."

In his youth, Yuan Huzhong had been diligent, but his poor talent meant he had to rely on the favors of his elders to obtain cultivation resources. Over time, he exhausted those connections, and the Yuan Family no longer wished to pour resources into what they saw as a lost cause. Helpless, Yuan Huzhong left the family and wandered the world.

Continuing where he left off, Yuan Huzhong elaborated, "Later, I found a temple run by rogue cultivators... I received a few legacies, but my cultivation still stagnated, and I had no further breakthroughs. Disheartened, I passed through here and found an Embryonic Breathing Realm demon wreaking havoc, so I dealt with it."

"The villagers begged me for help, and I felt pity for them, so I stayed to protect them..." Yuan Huzhong laughed bitterly and added, "This area is near Mount Quanwu, a place where many demons pass through. They regularly come here to feast on humans. So, I pledged myself to a demon general and, in exchange for providing a special blood offering each year, the demons no longer harass the village."

He proudly pointed to the villagers below him and smiled. "When I first arrived here, this place had just over a thousand people... Now, fifty years have passed, and there are more than five thousand!"

Li Xizhi remained silent, glancing at the boy kneeling on the ground. The boy, his breath weak and uneven, clearly had been consuming medicine from a young age‚Äîlikely the special blood offering that Yuan Huzhong mentioned. The child did not cry or make a fuss, remaining obedient.

Nearby, the demon trembled with fear upon hearing that Yuan Huzhong was a disciple of the devil gate, not daring to lift its head. Yuan Huzhong, after finishing his explanation, cautiously glanced at Li Xizhi, hesitating before adding, "The offerings to the immortal sect from this place... they have been supplied year after year without fail..."

Li Xizhi glanced once more at the villagers below and understood that what Yuan Huzhong said was likely true. The rainbow light in his hand flickered slightly as he responded, "I see."

He stood with his hands behind his back, silently and without any further interest in conversation. Then, in an instant, he soared away on the wind, his feet surrounded by swirling rainbow light, drifting off like an immortal being.

Yuan Huzhong wiped the cold sweat from his brow and collapsed to the ground with relief. He sighed toward the demon beside him, who was equally terrified and trembling, muttering, "Thank the heavens! Luckily, it was a disciple from the Azure Pond Sect... If it had been someone from the Yue Cultivating Sect, who is less tolerant, there would not have been any room for explanation. Not only would you and I have lost our lives, but even my great king would have been slain!"

Yuan Huzhong let out a sigh of relief and added, "If luck had truly been against us, what could we have done? If those sect disciples had slain the demon and left, these five thousand villagers would have been nothing but food for a horde of demons, after you and I were killed."

Li Xizhi soared away on the wind, feeling a slight heaviness in his heart. Although he knew such things were common in Jiangnan, this was the first time he had seen it with his own eyes. After hearing Yuan Huzhong's explanation, he realized he was powerless to change the situation.

At least it's better than overseas... After all, this land was once under the rule of an immortal mansion. Now, the immortal sects, out of caution or perhaps moral scruples, refrain from overt wickedness. Even the devil gates have to put on a false front... Some Dao lineages here still uphold certain principles.

Li Xizhi let out a self-deprecating chuckle. If he had been in Yuan Huzhong's position, he likely would have handled it the same way. He realized how foolish it had been to have thoughts of killing him earlier.

Li Xizhi had far too much on his mind regarding his family's pressures to indulge in any further pity. Soon, he cast the matter aside, flying through the area around Mount Quanwu. Suddenly, the jade pendant at his waist grew warm, emitting a soft white light.
ùôõùíìùíÜùôöùíòùíÜùì´ùô£ùì∏ùô´ùìÆùíç.ùíÑùíêùì∂

"Hmm?"

Li Xizhi was overjoyed and thought to himself, One of my clan's brothers or elders must be nearby!

Li Xijun and the others had been traveling through the mountains of the Quanwu range for several days now. With Kongheng leading the way, they had acquired a few spirit items and had encountered no Foundation Establishment Realm demons, and were merely wandering through the forest.

Li Xuanxuan and another cultivator were performing incantations and surveying the earth veins. After some time, they found a clue near a deep pool. Li Xijun then remarked, "Granduncle, according to the descriptions and techniques from the Chilling Snow Series, there should be a type of spirit water within this pool."

Li Xuanxuan, holding a bundle of mountain fruits, sorted through them and handed Li Xijun a plum before nodding slightly. After performing some calculations with a hand seal, he said quietly, "We may need to wait a few more days. The water vein runs deep, and it will not be easy to retrieve the spirit water quickly."

Li Xijun placed the fruit in his pouch and, along with Li Xuanxuan, continued casting spells, working together to draw out the spirit water. They alternated, one resting while the other maintained the spell. After about five or six days, a golden light finally appeared in the sky, descending rapidly.
ùôõùíìùíÜùôöùíòùíÜùì´ùô£ùì∏ùô´ùìÆùíç.ùíÑùíêùì∂

When the golden light landed, it transformed into a man dressed in radiant feathered robes, holding a golden ring. His aura was overwhelming, indicating that he had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. The moment he landed, the pressure from his presence made the group feel as though their faces were being cut by sharp blades.

The man glanced at the surface of the pool, his face expressionless, and he was clearly here for the spirit water.

He held the golden ring in his hand and had a rather handsome face. His clothing‚Äîwith golden hooks, rings, and diamond-patterned robe‚Äîimmediately gave away his identity as a disciple of the Golden Tang Gate.

"Greetings, Senior..." The Li Family members greeted, cupping their fists.

The Golden Tang Gate cultivator looked down on them arrogantly, his expression showing a hint of excitement. After glancing at the three of them, he drawled, "Where are you three from? This spirit water now belongs to the Golden Tang Gate."

Li Xuanxuan and Li Xijun exchanged glances, while Kongheng frowned deeply and retorted, "But we were here first..."

Li Xijun quickly interrupted him and pulled him back, replying politely, "We are from the Li Family of Qingdu Peak. Since Senior desires it, we will leave this pool to you."

"No." The man's smile was cold and mocking as he said sharply, "You will retrieve the spirit water for me before you leave."

Li Xuanxuan studied the man's face, finding it vaguely familiar. Then, he suddenly recalled that they had crossed paths years ago when he had sought out Kong Yu to help move a mountain, only to encounter this same arrogant Golden Tang Gate disciple.

"Situ Mo!"

This man had a notoriously bad temper. He had mocked Kong Yu mercilessly at the time, making fun of him for being from a small, insignificant family. Li Xuanxuan had not known the full story until then. Back then, Situ Mo had been at the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm, but now, he had just entered the Foundation Establishment Realm.

This kind of person... is only relying on his family's connections!

Li Xuanxuan cursed inwardly. Situ Mo's face was full of contempt as he stared at Li Xuanxuan, with an expression betraying his intense dislike.

Li Xuanxuan quickly realized, Damn it! He recognizes me... I have been dragged into this because of the Kong Family... But what kind of grudge does he have against them for him to hate them this much?

Sure enough, when Li Xijun politely responded, Situ Mo only sneered and said in a low voice, "I remember your family... Years ago, my elders collected qi in your clan's territory! They lured a demon sparrow, causing quite a mess. Your ancestors were mortals back then, they probably even bowed before my elders back then."

Li Xijun had thought at first that this man was merely a spoiled and rich young master, but after hearing that remark, he immediately realized that this was an enemy. The polite smile disappeared from his face, now replaced by a cold expression.

Li Xuanxuan, though filled with anger, was even more perplexed.

Where does this young man's deep hatred come from? This must be about more than the Profound Peak Gate...

He truly could not understand where Situ Mo's deep hatred stemmed from, and the man's words were venomous and harsh, fueling the fire of Li Xuanxuan's anger. The elder's face had already darkened with displeasure.

Situ Mo coldly eyed Li Xuanxuan and spoke in a low voice, "That day we met in the wilderness‚Äîif I had known that you hideous old thing were from the Li Family, I would have killed you on the spot... you..."

He gritted his teeth and continued viciously, "The An Family and the Lu Family made deals with a tiger, and in the end, your Li Family wiped them out. It was indeed satisfying to watch! But because of your family's deeds, my mother fell into despair and took her own life... Now, I have waited long enough for this day, to make your family suffer as my mother did!"

Li Xijun stood frozen in shock, while Kongheng's eyes widened in disbelief. Li Xuanxuan's mind buzzed as one image after another flashed before him, finally settling on a face that had long worried Li Xiangping and Li Tongya...

"Ji Dengqi!" Li Xuanxuan blurted out, "You... you are the son of that Ji Family woman!"

"Haha! Exactly..."

Situ Mo had not even finished his sentence when Li Xijun, having already understood the situation, grabbed Kongheng's sleeve and, in a flash of red light, launched himself into the sky, fleeing at great speed. Even Situ Mo was briefly stunned before he roared in anger, "Just like Li Tongya's spawn! Crafty like a snake!"

Kongheng and Li Xuanxuan were still in shock, but as they realized what was happening, they prepared to follow. Just then, a golden light rose around the pool, sealing the area and trapping them inside.

Situ Mo sneered at Li Xijun's retreating figure and said, "Did you really think I was talking all this time for nothing?"

In the distance, Li Xijun, who was enveloped in red light, was just about to break through the formation when a golden weapon, lying in ambush, shot forward, piercing him straight through the chest and pinning him to the ground.

Blood splattered as the teenager fell to the earth with a heavy thud. The sight sent chills down Li Xuanxuan's spine. His mana-enhanced sight allowed him to see clearly as a bloodstained plum fruit rolled out of the boy's chest pocket, bouncing twice on the ground.

"The little one ran fast, but he fell to the Dinglin Piercer, and died a bit sooner!" A flash of pleasure crossed Situ Mo's face before he turned his attention to the two remaining men.

His voice was icy as he said, "You old fool, you may have some experience, but my mother was Ji Dengyu! The head of the Ji Family back then, Ji Dengqi, was my uncle! When Lu Sisi and An Zheyan slaughtered my Ji Family, they thought my father had been killed, but they did not know my mother was already carrying me in her womb..."

"I thought you would return the same way, but you kept twisting and turning, ending up in Mount Quanwu. I searched for so long, and now that I've found you, I won't let you all leave!"

His expression was cruel and ferocious, but there was a twisted joy in his voice, the kind that only comes from vengeance.

Laughing maniacally, he said coldly, "I know how ruthless the Li Family is, and Li Tongya was a Foundation Establishment Realm sword cultivator, so my mother never dared speak of this, raising me in secret... But now that I have established an immortal foundation, it is time to settle this grudge!"

Li Xuanxuan was in utter shock. His mind raced, his eyes reddening with anger as he tried to explain through gritted teeth, "The destruction of the Ji Family was due to the An and Lu families seizing the two mountains‚Äîit had nothing to do with my family!"

"Nothing to do with you?" Situ Mo sneered.

Since he was not in any hurry and felt certain of his victory, he could not resist arguing back. His voice filled with hatred as he said, "My Ji Family had planted someone close to Lu Yuanlu, and that loose-tongued fool was consumed with jealousy over Li Tongya! He revealed everything! Who do you think you are fooling?"

That idiot! It was that idiot all along!

Li Xuanxuan felt an icy chill sweep over him, making it hard to breathe. His chest burned with rage, and all he could think about was Li Xijun outside. The wound on his face began to crack, revealing a faint golden pill beneath.

Blood began to flow from his seven orifices, and the six old wounds on his body burst open, spraying blood everywhere. His eyes bulged, and he was rendered speechless.

Suddenly, a hand rested on his shoulder, emitting a soft, warm golden light that quickly calmed his emotions and slowly healed his wounds.

Kongheng, with a slight bow of his head, spoke gently, "Elder, you are still not recovered yet, please quell your anger. This humble monk is here... there is nothing for you to worry about."
