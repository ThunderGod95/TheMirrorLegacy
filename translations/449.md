# Chapter 635: The Profound Method of Continuation

The Cloud Octopus had just been subdued when two more demon octopi flew out of the sea, breaking through the air with bared fangs and brandished claws. They collided with Kongheng's golden light, causing it to waver slightly and granting Yun Xiaozi a brief opportunity to breathe. He channeled his demonic power to fend off the incoming thunder.

Kongheng, though slightly strained, maintained an unperturbed expression. Instead, a peculiar glint appeared in his eyes.

Over the years, he had mastered many spells, but subduing three demons simultaneously was beyond his limits. He found the two newly arrived demons surprisingly weak and, upon closer inspection, activated his spell-bound eyes. "These two demons seem odd. They appear to be clones... No wonder the two serpent fishes show no fear."

While he continued suppressing the three demons, Li Qinghong, in the air above, was not idle. Thunder gathered in her hands, and the long spear she wielded turned the surrounding spiritual energy into a brilliant violet hue. With a flourish, she unleashed a spark with her spear, which transformed into the image of a sparrow.

The long spear emitted a conical violet wave in midair, surrounded by thunder. In response, seven or eight bolts of lightning descended from the sky, creating an awe-inspiring spectacle.

Yun Xiaozi was alarmed, thinking to himself, This is not good. She must be a disciple of an immortal sect. If she truly intends to kill me, I will not escape alive under such a barrage of thunder.

Realizing escape was futile, he abandoned the thought, baring his fangs in determination. He knew he had no choice but to fight to the death. Stretching out his eight tentacles, he surged through the clouds and mist, frantically absorbing energy.

Meanwhile, Huiyao, with his round, bun-like face, hesitated to intervene, fearing that stepping forward would result in being suppressed by the golden light. He thought to himself in alarm, Dealing with a monk is already bad enough! But now there is also a thunder cultivator... They speak of merging fire to exorcise demons, and heavenly thunder restrains filth. But in this world, what demon does not carry some corruption?"

Yun Xiaozi, caught between the thunder and his desperate attempts to absorb the spiritual energy around him, caused the energy in the area to plummet. Even the sea, which had been sealed into a flat expanse of land, showed faint cracks as if it might leap and churn under the strain of his spell.

Li Qinghong parted her lips slightly, preparing to summon the profound thunder stored in her thunderpool. A faint purple-white glow flickered at her red lips, giving her an otherworldly appearance.

Since her breakthrough to the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm, her thunder reservoir had increased to two profound thunder. If she were to recklessly expend her temporary mana to conjure a third, it would be enough to end Yun Xiaozi, a demon without a proper Dao lineage. Yet, she hesitated, distrusting the two demon fishes.

Huiyao burst into loud laughter and shouted, "At last, I can be of use!"

He blew and struck the small jade-green bell floating midair. The bell trembled and swayed with a faint hum, sending out ripples that halted the surging flow of spiritual energy. The energy lingered in the air, suspended and indecisive, unable to find its path.

Yun Xiaozi, never having faced such a situation, flailed his eight tentacles in a frenzy. He writhed wildly in midair, struggling to resist the incoming thunder. Unlike Yu Muxian, who was a prodigy in spellcasting, Yun Xiaozi was helpless in this predicament.

While Yun Xiaozi's spell clashed against the green bell's power, Li Qinghong put away her profound thunder. Her long hair flowed freely as she leaped into the fray with unrestrained energy. Thunder and black smoke surged in all directions as she wielded her violet lightning spear, moving effortlessly through the attacks of the three demons.

Li Qinghong had arrived in the Eastern Sea only to face unsatisfying battles thus far. Her opponents were either dealt with in two quick strikes or refused to fight her to the death. This time, she finally found a worthy challenge. The talisman qi within her surged faintly, and with every clash, her strength grew fiercer.

Yun Xiaozi, trapped in the chaos, found himself in utter despair. The power of the lightning in the female cultivator's spear grew stronger, and her spear aura sharper. Torn flesh and blood flew high into the air, raining down in a crimson storm, attracting swarms of fish to feast upon it.

Forced to abandon his spell, Yun Xiaozi noticed that the two serpent fish had already entangled his subordinates. Meanwhile, the bald monk's glowing golden palms landed heavy, crushing strikes directly on Yun Xiaozi's body.

Having lost the initiative and suppressed by the artifact, Yun Xiaozi found himself unable to effectively cast his spells. He was forced into direct combat with Li Qinghong, barely holding his ground. With the Master Monk joining the fight, Yun Xiaozi's predicament grew increasingly dire.

This was a flaw shared by most cultivators outside the dragon clans, immortal gate scions, and major powers. They often relied on just a handful of signature techniques. Once they lost the upper hand or were countered early, they quickly fell into disadvantage and could not sustain themselves.

Desperate, Yun Xiaozi activated his Immortal Foundation and hastily cast several self-created spells. He summoned golden mist to block the attacks, but under the combined assault of his two enemies, his defenses seemed pale and ineffective. The only remotely threatening move he had was his occasional use of a purple-black beak.

The beak was incredibly sharp and charged with destructive power. It could bite through thunder with ease. Even Kongheng, with his iron-like palms, had to avoid the beak's attacks carefully.

After a fierce exchange, Kongheng finally brought out his ancient bronze staff. It rang loudly with metallic clangs as it struck Yun Xiaozi repeatedly. The strikes reduced his flesh to pulp and left him on the brink of collapse.

Yun Xiaozi resisted desperately, but his strength was only comparable to that of Fu Daimu in the past. Fu Daimu, at least, had the advantage of being a disciple of Mount Wu and wielding a Foundation Establishment Realm artifact. Yun Xiaozi had neither of these. Unable to withstand the relentless assault, he continuously threw out talismans and spirit items in a futile attempt to defend himself.

Despite being in the late stage of Foundation Establishment Realm and carrying numerous treasures and talismans, Yun Xiaozi was forced to flee southward for hundreds of li. Blood and golden mist trailed behind him as pieces of his flesh peeled away during the desperate chase.

Finally cornered at the cape, Li Qinghong severed Yun Xiaozi's eighth tentacle, rendering him completely incapable of resistance. After battling through the entire night, her mana was greatly depleted. However, her momentum only grew fiercer. By the end, each spear strike was twenty percent stronger than when the fight began. With Kongheng blocking Yun Xiaozi's escape route, they finally managed to bring the demon down.

Li Qinghong forced Yun Xiaozi into his humanoid form. His previous saddle-nosed elder appearance had been reduced to just a head connected to a withered torso. Closing his eyes tightly, Yun Xiaozi begged for mercy. Li Qinghong sealed his Immortal Foundation and his beak. Only then did the two serpent fish demons finally arrive.

Each of the serpent fish demons held a Cloud Octopus in hand, both of them barely alive. The octopi's eight tentacles had been devoured completely, clearly consumed by the two demons.

Seeing the overwhelming strength of the two cultivators, Huiyao quickly changed his demeanor. Putting away his green bell, he became respectful and deferential, exclaiming, "Your Grace, such powerful thunder techniques! Master Monk, such powerful spells!"

The demon clearly wasn't accustomed to such flattery, repeating "powerful" over and over in its speech, characteristic of its kind's lack of moral burden and willingness to change attitudes in an instant. Li Qinghong, unsurprised, pointed to Yun Xiaozi and said, "Let us not discuss how the rest of the spoils will be divided for now. He is mine—I still have use for him."

Huiyao nodded repeatedly in agreement. Kongheng glanced at the Cloud Octopus heads held by the two serpent fish demons, a look of doubt crossing his face, and remarked, "These two creatures seem surprisingly weak."

Li Qinghong silently turned her head, hiding a smile. She wasn't sure if Kongheng's words were deliberate, but the serpent fish brothers seemed entirely oblivious. One of them hurriedly explained, "Master Monk, you may not know, but Yun Xiaozi's Dao foundation is quite peculiar. These two are not normal Foundation Establishment Realm demons but products of a fortuitous opportunity."

Huiyao continued, "Years ago, he severed eight of his tentacles, each one transforming into a Cloud Octopus. By linking their innate abilities to his Dao foundation and nurturing them over the years with his mana, he managed to cultivate two Foundation Establishment Realm subordinates. However, they are inherently flawed and ultimately inferior."

"Master Monk's abilities are vast, naturally far beyond what these creatures could challenge," Huiyao added, following up with a stream of exaggerated praise. His words fully embodied the typical demon mindset of fearing power without genuine loyalty. Quickly changing the subject, he invited, "This old creature has quite the collection of treasures. Let me take you down for a look."

The two demons reverted to their true forms and dove into the sea. Li Qinghong, after swallowing a pill, calculated that she hadn't even needed to use a single bolt of profound thunder from her thunderpool and followed them leisurely.

After some time searching underwater, the group returned empty-handed. Huiyao, visibly frustrated, grabbed Yun Xiaozi and slapped him a dozen times, demanding the location of his lair.

However, Yun Xiaozi, knowing his fate was sealed, kept his mouth tightly shut and refused to reveal anything. Huiyao and his brother exchanged a sly smile. "My Grace, leave him to us for a bit," one of them suggested.

"Keep him alive, I still need him," Li Qinghong ordered. She watched as the serpent fish dove back into the sea, and a thick mist began to rise from the water. Soon, only Li Qinghong and Kongheng were left on the surface.

Kongheng clasped his hands together, hesitating for a moment with his eyes closed. Meanwhile, Li Qinghong gazed toward the horizon, secretly observing their surroundings.

The group had ventured several hundred li deeper, reaching the sea's edge. The spiritual energy in this area grew increasingly sparse, and the sky was an endless expanse of dim darkness. It was said that the spiritual energy here was so thin that even the Great Void was fractured and unstable. Even cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm, upon reaching this place, would have to descend to lower altitudes to continue flying.

At the sea's edge, the water tumbled over, transforming into mist that rose into the air. This created a dense, heavy cloud cover. If a location with abundant spiritual energy could be found amidst this, it would indeed be an excellent place for cultivation.

Li Qinghong observed her surroundings for a moment, noticing that sweat had started to form on Kongheng's face. Finally, the two serpent fish leaped out of the water, handing over Yun Xiaozi and taking the lead to guide them further.

Yun Xiaozi's eyes were tightly shut, his body covered in blood, and he appeared to have lost consciousness. Half of his form had turned into a limp, fleshy mass, dripping blood that transformed into golden mist as it rose and dispersed into the air.

The group flew over the sea and soon located a formation point. Using Yun Xiaozi's token, they activated it and descended into his lair.

The interior of Yun Xiaozi's lair was empty and slimy, resembling a sea cave. The wet, churning spirit mud created an environment well-suited to the Cloud Octopus' tastes. After searching the area for a while, the group began collecting various spirit items.

The spirit mud here was unusual. Aside from its foul stench, it had a corrosive property that could penetrate mana and erode the body. While the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators were unaffected, they still found the smell unbearable. Huiyao, thoroughly disgusted by the environment, dragged Yun Xiaozi over and slapped him several dozen more times to vent his frustration.

Most of the treasures they found were broken artifacts. Some had been refined by demons, while others were remnants left behind by cultivators. Beyond that, they discovered spirit items, including various forms of spirit water and spiritual qi.

Li Qinghong selected a few spears and swords, inspecting the spiritual qi within them. None of them were familiar to her, but she casually picked a few and selected some spirit water that would be useful for juniors practicing perception techniques.

In terms of wealth... there is nothing truly remarkable here. Just a few rare spirit items to bring back, she thought to herself.

After assessing Yun Xiaozi's strength earlier, she hadn't held high hopes for the treasures he might possess. Huiyao's earlier boasting about the vastness of his collection was no more than a typical ploy to stir greed. Now that their enemy was no more, Huiyao's cheerful demeanor betrayed no hint of embarrassment.

Once the spoils were divided, Huiyao was in excellent spirits. He courteously escorted Li Qinghong and Kongheng back to the island, showing an unusual degree of hospitality. He didn't even bring up the topic of offerings, let alone demand a share of the underwater mineral resources.

Li Qinghong, however, remained cautious. She feared the serpent fish might eventually broach the matter of dividing mineral resources, a topic that was highly taboo among the dragon clans. If such a proposal reached the ears of a Dragon Son, it could lead to serious consequences. She tactfully declined and quietly retreated into seclusion on the island.

In the southern borders, at Yi Mountain City.

Li Xuanfeng had waited in the southern border for over two years before finally being summoned by Daoist Master Yuan Su.

Returning to the entrance of the cave dwelling, he carefully observed the spirit beast statue at its entrance. Sure enough, it resembled the one he had seen in the grotto heaven, giving him confidence as he stepped inside.

Yuan Su, as always, reclined on his jade platform. Spiritual qi surged below, and white mist swirled about. His gaze lingered on Li Xuanfeng for a moment before he spoke softly, "So, you really killed Yu Muxian."

Li Xuanfeng kneeled and bowed, replying, "This subordinate acted rashly. I beg the Daoist Master's forgiveness."

Yuan Su shook his head and slowly straightened, his voice light and drifting in the air. "It does not matter. Yuanwu must die before I do. When that time comes, even Tang Shedu will not be able to do anything to you."

He completely ignored Li Xuanfeng's words and continued speaking to himself. "Suiguan has seen two years of continuous rain without pause. That Golden Feather Sect will not remain idle either. Troubled times loom ahead..."

After a few idle comments, Daoist Master Yuan Su stopped talking. Li Xuanfeng stepped forward and said, "While in the grotto heaven, this subordinate encountered a spirit beast statue resembling the one at your cave dwelling. From the statue, I acquired a gemstone, which I have brought to offer to the Daoist Master."

"The Three-Eyed Mount Tiao Beast?" Yuan Su's interest was piqued. As Li Xuanfeng presented the gemstone with both hands, Yuan Su gave it a brief glance. The gem was dark in color, with what seemed like rippling water inside. Disappointed, he remarked, "It is nothing valuable, just a piece of Valley Water Stone. It is useless to me. Keep it for yourself."

He leaned back on the jade platform again. The matter seemed to remind him of something, and he casually asked, "What techniques did you acquire in the grotto?"

Li Xuanfeng, already prepared, retrieved three jade slips from his storage pouch and respectfully replied, "The first is the Clear Dew Origin Manual, said to align with the Daoist Master's Shared Dao. The second is Meditative Chant, aligned with Fairy Ning Wan's Shared Dao. The third is my own Gold Aura Profound Inquiry Technique."

Yuan Su laughed heartily, the sound echoing for several breaths before he stopped. He then said, "You certainly put thought into this. The Purifying Dew divine ability within the Clear Dew Origin Manual does happen to be the one I lack. Unfortunately, the technique recorded on the Three Drums Wall ends at Foundation Establishment Realm, making it useless to me!"

He slowly sat upright and explained in a soft tone, "When one cultivates their first divine ability in the Purple Mansion Realm, they must start anew with the second. It similarly requires a cultivation technique aligned with the Purple Mansion Realm to develop. Without such techniques, the path is severed."

Li Xuanfeng furrowed his brows slightly. Yuan Su, resting his chin in his hand, casually asked, "Are you wondering how Chi Wei managed to reach the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm despite three of the five techniques from the Chi Family only extending to Foundation Establishment Realm?"

Although Li Xuanfeng had already deduced the answer, he still bowed respectfully and said, "I ask the Daoist Master for guidance."

Yuan Su shrugged and explained, "Without Purple Mansion Realm techniques, the solution is simple: find a prodigy to cultivate the foundation. Once they have brought the Dao foundation to the Foundation Establishment Realm, consume them through various means, supplement it with Purple Mansion Realm spirit items, and guide the transformation into a divine ability."

His eyes narrowed in a sly smile as his voice echoed throughout the cave dwelling, "There are many ways to achieve this, collectively known as the Profound Method of Continuation. It saves time while extending one's cultivation path. Naturally, the world flocks to it."

Yuan Su lamented, "After all, most of the Purple Mansion Realm techniques were lost during the southern migrations. Each family hoards what remains. Without resorting to such devouring methods, there is no other path forward. Otherwise, you end up like me—stuck on the borders, waiting for death to come."
