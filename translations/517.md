# Chapter 782: Heavenly Gilded Helm

Li Xuanfeng had recently been summoned and rewarded personally by the Purple Mansion Realm elders of Azure Pond Sect and Golden Feather Sect. He had been encouraged to continue striving. Everyone knew that Baixiang Valley had been under the protection of his juniors, so no one was willing to speak up first.

On the other side, the man known as the Long Sky Halberd, Tang Shedu, had no intention of stepping forward now, even though he was usually happy to stir up a bit of commotion and nursed past grievances with Li Xuanfeng. He didn’t believe himself to be weaker either. He tilted his head to glance at Yu Su, the Brocade Dark Mouse, beside him.

Ning Heyuan simply continued, "Baixiang Valley has fallen. The surrounding regions, like Qun Yuan Mountain and Nu Mountain, have been thoroughly plundered. A large number of devil cultivators have moved southward, flooding the wilderness up to Lake Xian and further south into Xiao Family territory in Lixia Prefecture, as well as the areas around Mount Yu and Yuyuan.

"The defenders of Baixiang Valley failed to hold their ground and suffered heavy losses. Li Xizhi of Changtian Peak fled to Chengdu Mountain. Yu Yuwei of Panqi Peak escaped to Lake Xian. Quan Yi of Linghe Peak was killed by Tuoba Chongyuan. His body was destroyed and Dao extinguished. None of the remaining cultivators survived."

After he finished reading the message, the crowd began murmuring among themselves.

Li Xuanfeng showed no sign of anger as he suddenly spoke, "Lake Xian is quite far... Baixiang Valley is over five hundred kilometers from Chengdu Mountain, with several intact formations along the way. Why did they only manage to escape once they reached such a distant place?"

Ning Heyuan understood that his brother-in-law was asking a rhetorical question. Tang Shedu let out a cold laugh and was about to interject, but Ning Heyuan quickly answered first, "The two peak masters passed through many checkpoints, but the cultivators stationed there feared Tuoba Chongyuan's power and dared not go out to receive them..."

Li Xuanfeng nodded and said in a deep voice, "Those who lost Baixiang Valley must be punished... but unfortunately, the casualties are too severe. There’s hardly anyone left to be held accountable.

"The two peak masters are among the elites of the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. It's remarkable they survived the pursuit of the devil cultivators. The others who couldn’t enter the defensive formations perished along the way."

Li Xuanfeng's words caused mixed expressions among the cultivators. Chi Zhiyan grew increasingly troubled; he could clearly hear the implication.

Seeing the hesitation in others, he tried to subtly reassure them, "What Xuanfeng says is true... the guards at the checkpoints must also be punished. But the immediate priority is to send people to Baixiang Valley to rebuild the great formation."

He made no mention of the fallen ruins near Baixiang Valley. Those had likely already been divided within the great void. The Azure Pond Sect had just lost a major conflict and their share had been significantly reduced. It was barely enough to supply the Chi Family, let alone be distributed to others.

As soon as those words fell, Tang Shedu and the others, who had been watching coldly, grew restless. They were all cultivators who were over a hundred years old, and they could all vaguely sense the shifting tides of this grand game.

Given the current situation, it was clear that none of them would get a share of the ruins near Baixiang Valley. Going there would only mean offending the Tuoba Family for nothing. Who could say how many tricks Tuoba Chongyuan still had up his sleeve? Was this worth risking one’s life?

Li Xuanfeng had yet to recover from his injuries, so chances were high that someone among these veteran cultivators would be selected. Tang Shedu was the most well-known among them. Not only had he forged his reputation over many years, but he had also been personally trained by Yuanwu.

Tuoba Chongyuan... who would want to go against him? It’s a thankless task and would only bring the wrath of the Tuoba Family.

Chi Zhiyan glanced around and, as expected, asked, “Senior Shedu?”

Tang Shedu could only cough and step forward. But at this point, he had no room for tact and had to respond quietly, “Yuanwu Peak is currently short on manpower. I cannot manage matters alone...”

Chi Zhiyan scanned the crowd and spoke softly, “Fellow Daoist Lingu...”

A middle-aged man stepped out from the crowd and cupped his hands in greeting. He looked unremarkable, with two bulging gourds tied to his waist and vine armor glowing with dharma light. He was Lingu Rao of the Jiachuan Lingu Family, known in years past as the Raozi Scorpion and once a guardian of the Southern Sea for Azure Pond Sect.

A century ago, Lingu Rao had been a well-known cultivator, and his father, Lingu Xia, was even more renowned. However, Lingu Rao had always guarded the Southern Sea and rarely returned inland, so after a hundred years, few still remembered his name.

Chi Zhiyan was about to issue orders when he suddenly paused. The great void split open before him, and a golden rune flew out and landed in his palm.

Chi Zhiyan closed his eyes for a second, carefully absorbing the rune’s message. Then he suddenly laughed aloud. When he reopened his eyes, they were full of joy as he declared, “Let all my fellow Daoists be informed, Tuoba Chongyuan has had his Dharma robe torn and his physical form shattered. He perished violently in Baixiang Valley! Only a single wisp of his soul remains, and is likely returning to Shengle Heaven for reincarnation!”

The news caught everyone off guard. Tang Shedu let out a sigh of relief. Joy naturally lifted his spirits, and unable to suppress his curiosity, he asked, “Congratulations, my lord! May I ask which high cultivator was responsible?”

Chi Zhiyan laughed heartily. “It was the Eastern Sea Dragon Clan! Perhaps Dingyuan, the Dragon Son, was drawn in by the situation in Xu State and somehow crossed thousands of kilometers straight inland.

“Xu State is vast, and yet he happened to run straight into Tuoba Chongyuan! How could a dragon kin spare a member of the Tuoba Family? He beat him to death on the spot! He even snatched his life-bound seal; it might even be displayed as decoration in the palace of the Dragon Clan!”

Chi Zhiyan was in high spirits, enjoying the drama and not minding the chaos. He even added a few mocking remarks, to which Ning Heyuan quickly flattered, “Congratulations, my lord!”

Chi Zhiyan replied with a cheerful smile, “Tuoba Xuantan killed the True Hornless Dragon's seventh son, Dongfang Tianye, to forge his Hehou Profound Pearl and Water Wall Treasure Pill. The Dragon Clan hate them to the bone... Now that they’ve caught someone from the Tuoba Family, flaying him alive would hardly be an exaggeration.”
𝘧𝓇ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝓃ℴ𝓋𝑒𝑙.𝑐𝘰𝑚

Chi Zhiyan nodded with a smile. If Tuoba Chongyuan was dead, the Tuoba Family would likely retreat, and the eastern threat was naturally resolved, so how could he not be pleased?

Now in a leisurely mood, he added, “You should still refer to him as the True Monarch of Profound Breath of Tiancheng or Emperor Wu of Liang... After all, he was a True Monarch. Though now dead and his Dao extinguished, calling him by name directly might yet bring misfortune.”

Outwardly, he chatted casually about the Liang Dynasty's tale, but inwardly, he began speculating, Daoist Master Yuan Xiu sending that rune reply so suddenly was clearly unexpected. Perhaps the Dragon Clan's move was brilliant, catching both the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and the Maha off guard...

It’s odd though... Since the established rules still hold, it definitely wasn’t the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had struck...

Lost in thought, he grew silent. One by one, the others withdrew, and the great hall gradually emptied.

Ning Heyuan and Li Xuanfeng returned together to their cave dwelling, each lost in their own thoughts. Ning Heyuan was the first to speak, “How are your injuries now, brother-in-law?”

Li Xuanfeng was more concerned about Li Xizhi’s condition, but didn’t wish to ask too directly. He waved his hand and replied, “I’ve taken the treasured panacea that was delivered. It’s worked well. There’s no need to worry.”

Li Xuanfeng’s injuries had resulted in him being summoned by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, and the Ning Family had personally provided a healing treasure. It was a Dream Swamp Grass, far more precious than the Huashang Fruit Li Tongya had received years ago.

Li Xuanfeng’s appearance had even regained a youthful glow after taking the herb.

Ning Heyuan noticed and felt much more at ease. He then said solemnly, “Brother-in-law, there’s something suspicious about Tuoba Chongyuan’s death!”

Li Xuanfeng certainly understood and responded quietly, “Of course there’s something strange... Perhaps even the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators couldn’t foresee it.”

Ning Heyuan nodded and said, “The spiritual currents in Xu State are in disformation now. The great void is crowded with Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Maha. It’s impossible to calculate anything clearly! That’s why all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are playing their games... But how did Tuoba Chongyuan just happen to run into a dragon kin?

“Moreover, Shengle Heaven isn’t some ordinary force. The Tuoba Family must have demons stationed in the great void. Even if the current state of Xu State is obscured in the void, surely they can still sense the vitality of their own juniors, can’t they?”

Li Xuanfeng stared heavily at the jade table. A young figure suddenly appeared in his mind. He had specifically asked about Li Xizhi’s situation, and had once met Dongfang Heyun in the Northern Sea.

Perhaps he was the one who acted... Dongfang Heyun was the first breath exhaled by the Dragon Monarch during his core formation, so his origins are beyond prediction. Once a Dragon Monarch is involved, not even all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Maha combined can make accurate calculations.

But speculation would do them no good at this point. Li Xuanfeng asked, “How is the forging of the dharma artifact progressing?”

“The Murong Family’s heavy armor bears many traces of devil cultivators. It’s hard to smelt, and we still need more than half the allotted time,” Ning Heyuan replied.

He expressed further concern for Li Xuanfeng’s injuries, and soon took his leave. After seeing Ning Heyuan off, Li Xuanfeng returned to his cave dwelling and sat cross-legged. He took out a jade bottle from his robes.

Inside the jade bottle was the Geng Metal Triple Qi Pill bestowed by Yuan Xiu. Even through the precious container, holding it felt like gripping a blade’s edge.

The Chi and Ning families keep checking on my injuries and have sent such a valuable pill... It’s clear they want me to recover quickly, and begin working for Azure Pond Sect again.

Li Xuanfeng paused, then tipped the vial to let the pill inside fall out. Golden light flashed, brilliantly lighting the room in radiant white. The celestial pill hovered gently in the air, as if inspecting its surroundings.

Golden-white light flowed along the pill's patterns, and the cave was instantly filled with a fragrant aroma. The sound of clashing metal echoed loudly, while crimson, earthy patterns appeared on the walls, and gold and silver powder swirled up from the ground.

At this rate, everything in the cave will be turned into metal and stone in no time.

He didn’t hesitate for a moment longer. He picked up the pill and gently placed it in his mouth.

Buzz!

Li Xuanfeng heard a deafening hum in his mind as the world began to spin around him. The moment the pill entered his mouth, it vanished, turning into golden light that coursed through his body and swiftly settled in his qi sea.

He had long cultivated the Engraved Stone technique, so his qi sea was already filled with golden mists mixed with hints of crimson. But the moment this new, distinct golden light entered, it stirred up a stormy surge within.

Engraved Stone was a technique from the Golden Tang Gate. Its qi could break formations, cleave mountains, destroy enemy dharma artifacts, and pierce defenses with precision. The more enemies slain, and the more blood refined it, the stronger it became.

He had perfected the Engraved Stone long ago. As an Immortal Foundation, it empowered his body, turning it to metal and stone, as well as controlled baleful qi in harmony with his Strength to Move Mountains. His spiritual orifices spewed killing force, thus his current renown.

Now, golden energy within his qi sea swirled together, rising and sinking. Lighter essence ascended, and the denser descended. The energies began to reconnect, reforming the Geng Metal Triple Qi Pill anew.

To his surprise, his cultivation, which had seemingly hit its limit, began circulating again. It rose further, breaking past the peak of Foundation Establishment Realm and beginning a new phase of condensation.

This...

A strange feeling arose within him, eerily similar to the sensation he’d experienced decades ago when forming his Foundation Establishment. It felt as if something was taking shape within his qi sea.

Sure enough, the Geng Metal Triple Qi Pill slowly morphed, transforming into a massive golden talisman covered in intricate patterns that radiated bursts of multicolored light.

A realization slowly dawned on Li Xuanfeng, The Immortal Foundation, Heavenly Gilded Helm!

What had appeared in his qi sea was unmistakably a fellow Dao partner of his Engraved Stone. It was another Immortal Foundation of the Geng Metal system, the Heavenly Gilded Helm.

His aura advanced once again, as golden armor-like patterns emerged across his body. Yet Li Xuanfeng’s expression darkened, and he thought coldly, So the Geng Metal Triple Qi Pill was actually a method of completing a Dao Partner...

There were many Dao Partners on the path to Golden Core Realm, particularly within the Metallic Essence system. They complemented one another and were to be cultivated once a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability was achieved.

Cultivating such partners naturally took longer than consuming another’s foundation. Thus, in Jiangnan, it was common for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to devour Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, something Xiao Yuansi had once warned of.

So even at Foundation Establishment Realm, pills can be taken to add a Dao Partner in the qi sea... This brings many wonders, but it's an act of forced growth. It can impair the mind and make reaching Purple Mansion far more difficult...

Two brilliant lights were intertwining in his qi sea, but Li Xuanfeng opened his aging eyes slightly. He quickly grasped the motives of Daoist Master Yuan Xiu and Daoist Master Qiushui...

Daoist Master Qiushui clearly meant to benefit the Ning Family... I was the best candidate to practice this art... Whether or not Ning Wan breaks through, this act already brings great gain to the Ning Family...

As for Daoist Master Yuan Xiu, I can bring more benefits to Azure Pond Sect with my newfound strength... Both Daoist Masters saw their interests align, that’s why they summoned me together.

Though the Immortal Foundation had taken shape, the Geng Metal Triple Qi Pill’s medicinal power continued to refine and infuse into the Heavenly Gilded Helm, steadily completing its form.

So this is the calculation of Daoist Masters...

Li Xuanfeng felt a cold chill run down his spine. He had never considered the Purple Mansion Realm, especially since the follow-up to his cultivation method, the Heavenly Lustrous Gold Sutra, was held by the Golden Tang Gate. Whether he had the chance or not, pushing himself toward Purple Mansion Realm didn’t serve Azure Pond Sect or anyone else.

But this single pill had forced the path to Purple Mansion Realm to fade into uncertainty. Shock and anger stirred within him, and as his thoughts spiraled, Yuan Su’s face gradually surfaced in his mind.

But I dare not hate...

More clarity slowly emerged in his heart. The mana from the Heavenly Gilded Helm was slightly dim, flowing through his meridians, causing the golden patterns on his skin to grow increasingly vivid.

The Heavenly Gilded Helm, its essence is cold and sharp, skilled at absorbing and emitting metallic energy, drawing golden brilliance. Once activated, the Immortal Foundation manifests a full helm over the body, turning it into a sculpture of stone and metal.

When worn, it grants the strength to tear tigers and leopards, immune to water and fire, resistant to baleful poisons, able to mend wounds with stone and metal. It can even regenerate severed limbs...

Li Xuanfeng’s cultivation continued to rise. He quietly attuned himself to the change. Within his qi sea, as if clouds parted to reveal the sky, something stirred. Another presence began to rise.

The object was radiant and milky-white, its brilliance halting the flow of golden energy. The golden orb receded, all energies condensed, and Li Xuanfeng’s heart skipped a beat.

This pill... has activated the talisman seeds!
