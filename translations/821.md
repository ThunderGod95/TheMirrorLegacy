# Chapter 821: The Thunder Pool

Li Zhouwei shook his head. "I have met your older brother, Gongsun Bofan. Despite his humble origins, his disposition is superb. The rogue cultivators in Jiangbei are innumerable, yet he has reached the apex of their path. If we ignore the ineffable hand of fate, he truly isn't far behind Wang Quwan..." He glanced at Zhou Boyun. "While he is formidable, you are stationed here in the Eastern Sea. You must be more cautious. Do not waste his heartfelt efforts!"

The Li Clan had once been enemies of the Capital immortals Dao, though relations had thawed recently. Zhou Boyun's words, however, were far too blunt. They were certainly not complimentary toward the Capital immortals Dao. If the wrong people heard his comments—that 'two birds cannot rest on the same branch'—it would be tantamount to placing a blade against his brother's throat.

It was fortunate that Li Zhouwei was the one present; he held Gongsun Bofan in decent regard, and the conflict between their two families had lessened. Had it been anyone else, they would not hesitate to sow discord between Gongsun Bofan and the Capital immortals Dao. A few choice words shouted during the heat of battle, and even someone as steady as Gongsun Bofan would likely turn pale with fright.

Zhou Boyun, whether he understood the gravity of the warning or not, nodded repeatedly and replied respectfully, "It is only because I saw how divinely mighty you are, my lord. I feared that if I spoke too highly of my brother's relationship with the Capital immortals Dao, I might displease you... That is why I spoke the plain truth."

Li Zhouwei was not an overly charitable man. Having said his piece, he stopped there. He gave a slight nod and exited the private room, sighing inwardly.

'Rogue cultivators, generation after generation... producing a single genius like Gongsun Bofan is already a miracle. How could he possibly have an equally remarkable younger brother? That family of Wang Quwan... how incredibly rare they are.'

As he left the pavilion, Yuan Hu'e hurried over, smiling. "My lord... I was just asking someone to inspect the artifact. Why are you leaving so soon? I haven't even had the chance to host you properly..."

Li Zhouwei knew the man couldn't wait for him to leave, so he didn't waste words, merely waving his hand. "Island Lord, there is no need to see me off!"

He immediately transformed into a ray of Profound Light and streaked away, vanishing toward the horizon.

Only then did Yuan Hu'e straighten his bowed back. His face darkened as he returned to the pavilion, with Zhou Boyun following uneasily behind him.

The old man shut the door firmly and said coldly, "Why didn't you inform me of such a situation sooner! You just sent someone saying it was 'big business'... But he produced an artifact like that! Is he some ordinary person? We couldn't even verify his origins! And now look!"

Zhou Boyun grew increasingly embarrassed and remained silent. Yuan Hu'e's expression was grim. "If not for your brother, do you think you would have this cushy job? You nearly got this old man killed! From now on, you're done here!"

Yuan Hu'e stormed out, leaving Zhou Boyun with that parting glare. He stalked out of the pavilion and returned to his own manor-cave. His anger had faded, replaced by calculation.

'The Mushroom Forest Plains are beyond saving. It's a land of conflict, and the ancestors passed down this fatal legacy. Several generations of elders have cultivated themselves to death pursuing it, and the children grow weaker with every generation. If we stay, what future does the Yuan clan have?'

'Yuan Chengzhao is also a selfish bastard. The Yuan family means nothing compared to his own Dao path. Things have escalated this far, yet he doesn't dare show his face or say a single word. Can't count on him. I must bring a few of the children out here. We will establish a new mountain in this territory, escape that cursed place, and restore the family discipline. We cannot let the lineage be extinguished...'

The radiance of the Bright Yang surfaced in the sky as the morning clouds began to glow. The sea glittered with golden light. Floes of ice, large and small, drifted on the surface like countless shards of shattered gold.

The Dragon King of Crimson Reef Island cultivated Cold Qi, sealing it in this land. This Crimson Reef Island was pierced by waves of frigid intent, and icebergs floated everywhere. Li Zhouwei had read the jade slips obtained from Tai'e Island, which recorded that Crimson Reef Island had become quite prosperous in recent years. Many new spirit mines and spirit troves had emerged, attracting a growing number of cultivators.

He flew midway and scanned the area. He didn't spot any Demon beasts, but he did see several flashes of greyish-red flame and heard the crackle of thunder. Two groups of cultivators were engaged in a lively battle atop an iceberg.

Li Zhouwei glanced over. One side wielded ferocious flames that made the opposing artifacts sizzle. The other commanded booming thunder that shattered chunks of the iceberg. A look at their attire and he recognized them immediately.

"One side is Crimson Reef Island, the other is Thunder-Hearing Island. This is a fight between stupid birds and vicious dogs. Both sides stink; neither is any good."

The leader of Crimson Reef Island was a young woman dressed in blue, a stark contrast to the red robes of her companions. The leader of Thunder-Hearing Island wielded two copper alms bowls, thunder crackling between them. He was an old acquaintance: Miao Ye.

This man was a direct descendant of the Miao Family. He had come to the lake before to ask about the Duruo Spear.

Looking closer at the iceberg, he saw that a cluster of ice-blue and white flowers, roughly the size of a fist, had bloomed on the summit. Their stems were vibrant green, rooted directly in the ice. Beside them crouched a black tortoise the height of a man and the size of a large table, trembling as it hid in its shell.

Li Zhouwei recognized it instantly. 'So, it's the Jade Hare Ice Flower... A rare treasure medicine. Legend says it only blooms beneath the Pine of the Wintry Snow. I never expected to find it here.'

'Strange... Even if this flower didn't grow beneath the pine, it absolutely should not be growing on an iceberg. This looks more like a manifestation caused by someone's divine ability breakthrough... It must be the Dragon King of Crimson Reef Island...'

Besides the strangeness of the spiritual object, Miao Ye's status was considerable. He would never travel thousands of miles just to fight over a Jade Hare Ice Flower. Clearly, both groups had other reasons for appearing at Crimson Reef Island; this treasure medicine was just an unexpected skirmish.

The Li Family's enmity with Thunder-Hearing Island wasn't as deep as their hatred for Crimson Reef Island, but it wasn't much better. He swept his gaze over the brawling cultivators, memorized the location, and transformed into light, taking a wide detour.

'After I return from the Lie Sea, I should also find a place for seclusion. I won't leave the Hetian Sea. I can stop by Crimson Reef Island and see just what these two factions are scheming.'

He had already covered most of the distance, and traveling as light was extremely fast. But he suddenly found goose-feather snow falling from the sky. It came down thick and fast, blanketing his entire field of vision in white. The world below became an interweaving canvas of blue and white.

Li Zhouwei smelled the rich scent of pine. On the small reef islands below his feet, countless pine trees burst forth from the stone, shaking in the blizzard, growing taller and taller, only to be quickly buried by the endless snow.

He flew for a hundred miles before the heavy snow began to subside. By the time he reached the outer sea, the snowfall had stopped completely. Li Zhouwei grew suspicious again.

"I've never heard of mastering a divine ability causing such a huge spectacle. It doesn't look like the fall of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator either. It looks more like a Demon beast on Crimson Reef Island breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm... Perhaps one of that Dragon King's subordinates."

He focused and flew on. Following the map's guidance for half a day, he gradually saw a small patch of dark reefs appearing on the edge of the sea. In the distance, the scattered shadows of islands emerged.

Li Zhouwei landed on the reef and looked around. The ground beneath his feet trembled slightly. A carriage, shimmering with purple light, actually rose from the sea's surface. A wave rolled in, carrying sparks of purple lightning.

A female cultivator in a white robe appeared. Her features were delicate, her pupils a deep purple. She led the carriage and spoke politely, "My Mistress invites you. Please, Young Master, come with me!"

Li Zhouwei's ocular art flickered. He perceived that she was a Purple Feather Sparrow and understood that the mistress of the Lie Sea had sent for him. He nodded slightly. "My thanks, Fairy."

"I wouldn't dare!"

The female cultivator, slightly awed, guided him onto the carriage. It was sized for ordinary people, completely unlike the previous Dragon-kin vehicles, which were as large as houses or small hills. This one seemed compact and exquisite.

Li Zhouwei lifted the curtain and entered. A small stove sat in the center, and behind it was only a single soft cushion. It was far too minimalist for the usual Dragon-kin style.

He was extremely familiar with the carriage's interior. He expertly lit the stove and waited, feeling both anticipation and sorrow. The carriage had already leaped into the air. He heard the female cultivator speak.

"Please wait a moment, Young Master. My Mistress is above the Lie Sea at the Profound Firmament Thunder Pool. We will arrive momentarily!"

Li Zhouwei acknowledged her. He watched the misty clouds outside the window gradually turn grey. The carriage beneath him suddenly shook, as if it had landed on something, and then began to race forward.

The thunder on both sides grew denser, and the color of the dark clouds deepened. They pierced the depths of the clouds and finally came to an abrupt halt. Before him was an entirely different scene.

He saw a vast, circular pool of purplish-white, filled with a dense, shimmering thunder liquid. It stretched beyond the horizon. Purple lightning constantly descended from above, smashing into the pool. The strikes were clearly powerful, yet the thunder liquid below, seemingly forged of fine iron, only rippled faintly.

The rim of the pool was a deep cyan, about thirty feet wide, gleaming with the luster of copper and iron and covered in dense thunder patterns. A group of female cultivators in white robes waited quietly by the edge.

Li Zhouwei stepped down. The white-robed cultivator handed the carriage off to another attendant who came to receive it. She gestured slightly and said respectfully, "This way, Young Master."

Li Zhouwei walked forward. The pool's shore vibrated slightly with every celestial thunderclap. After walking a short distance, the cultivator smiled.

"This place was formed by devouring thunder. The metal edge of the pool is the remains of a Grotto-Heaven, and the thunder liquid also poured forth from that Grotto-Heaven. It is called Echoing Thunder Water. It is solid as profound iron; it neither dissipates nor scatters, neither moves nor sounds. And yet, it is thunder."

"Above the Thunder Pool circle thirty-six paths of Profound Thunder and twelve Firmament Thunders. Once you enter, not only can you not fly, but I must urge you, Young Master, *never* draw a metal object. If you must draw an artifact, you absolutely must not point it toward the heavens. The forty-eight thunderbolts will descend and claim your life."

Li Zhouwei nodded in understanding. Fortunately, the Yuan'E Soft armor he wore was soft armor, without any sharp protrusions. He followed the female cultivator forward as the world behind them was gradually obscured by the dark sea of clouds. He saw a gap in the pool's edge, but the purplish-white thunder liquid did not flow out, standing erect as if it were solid.

The cultivator stepped onto the thunder pool. With a metallic clang, she walked directly upon the thunder liquid. Li Zhouwei followed her forward; it was indeed as hard as iron rock.

In the very center of the Thunder Pool stood a small, silver-white palace, not at all imposing. Li Zhouwei raised his gaze and saw a person leaning in the pavilion above.

The woman was draped in purplish-white feathers. She had a high-bridged nose, willow-leaf eyebrows, and almond eyes. Her long hair was coiled behind her, fastened with a single silver-white hairpin, while the rest of her dark hair cascaded like a waterfall from the pavilion window.

A purple mist filled her eyes. The purplish-white feathered robe pulsed as if breathing. Behind her, a faint purplish-white disc shimmered. She merely sat there, yet in his spiritual sense, she was a blinding radiance—a terrifying concentration of extreme thunder, compressed within that body, which otherwise appeared tranquil and gentle.

Li Zhouwei exhaled deeply. He bowed profoundly, as if toppling a golden mountain or a jade pillar, and announced in a clear, strong voice, "Moongaze Li Zhouwei pays his respects to the Mistress."

The woman chuckled softly. "Minghuang, you've come."

The woman in the Thunder Pool was none other than Li Qinghong!

Hearing her reply, Li Zhouwei slowly released the tension in his heart. The woman descended from the pavilion and helped him up. Li Zhouwei's voice was slightly hoarse as he replied, "The Old Master... is still worried sick about you, Mistress. He assumed you must have met with disaster in the Grotto-Heaven. The longer it went, the more anxious he became. But it turns out you have mastered the thunder and secured dominion over a sea... When I report this to the Old Master, he will surely weep with joy."

Although he had guessed it was related to Li Qinghong before coming, Li Zhouwei hadn't dared to hope too much. Even seeing her with his own eyes, he still suspected she might be a remnant soul. But with that one sentence from her, only relief remained in his heart.

Li Qinghong listened, a trace of worry clouding her expression. She spoke softly, "Some things are not suitable to be written on paper, lest they invite calamity... Furthermore, it is difficult to extend my hand onto the mainland. Back then, when Dingjiao met the fox, he still had to go through you in the Eastern Sea; he could not send a letter directly."

"My situation is even more unique. It involves many matters of the Dragon Monarch swallowing thunder. It is not convenient to expose myself, nor is it appropriate for me to leave this sea."

Li Zhouwei bowed. "Knowing that you are safe, Mistress, is the only blessing we need! Only now do I know the Daoist Master managed to escape danger... It was all thanks to your intervention. I only fear we caused you inconvenience, which would be a grave error..."

Since Li Qinghong had stated these concerns, it likely meant her current position was extremely close to that of the Dragon-kin. Learning that Li Qinghong was unharmed *and* that she had rescued Li Ximing was already the best possible outcome. Li Zhouwei absolutely did not want to drag her down. His repeated use of "Mistress" was a clear signal to the Dragon-kin of his attitude.

But his heart was filled mostly with gratitude and joy. "Our family member had just reached the Purple Mansion Realm and understood nothing. The Daoist Master is not the type to manage affairs meticulously. He was plotted against and nearly perished in the Eastern Sea... We only have you to thank for his rescue..."

But Li Qinghong just shook her head slightly and smiled. "For Ximing to reach the Purple Mansion Realm... he is far more formidable than I. He did not disappoint... Whether it's me or the Old Master back home, we both owe him our thanks. We all advanced one step of blood, one step of tears... Because of him, those blood and tears were not shed in vain."

"If he hadn't held on through that mental threshold, we wouldn't even have room to maneuver today... Besides... you all have always underestimated him."

Li Qinghong gave a soft smile and invited him into the pavilion. Sitting down in the pavilion of the Profound Firmament Thunder Pool, her pale purple, almond-shaped eyes blinked slightly.

"The Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring—that is, the Thunder Cloud Temple Grotto-Heaven—many cultivators perished there. Thunder-Hearing Island from the Southern Sea, the Xi Family from the Northern Sea, the Daoist traditions of the Western Heaven Plateau... from Jiangnan and Jiangbei, from Zhao, Yan, Wu, and Yue... every single one of them is a lineage the Dragon-kin have disseminated over the past thousand years."

"My cultivation method originated from Ling Yanzi. Back then, the Dragon-kin also selected him to enter. It was originally promised to the Purple Smoke Gate, but he gave it to our family first. That karmic affinity thus fell upon me... This method landing in our family's hands involved Changxiao and Purple Smoke, and now, the prophecy is fulfilled through Changxiao and Purple Smoke."

The white-robed cultivator who had led him in brought forward a jade pot. Li Qinghong raised a slender hand, stopping her. Those eyes, once so full of heroic spirit, now held a trace of gentleness.

"It's impossible to explain it all clearly anymore. Looking back at everything... perhaps I was just born with the destiny to swallow thunder."
