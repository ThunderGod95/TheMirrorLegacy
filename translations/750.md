# Chapter 750: A Teacup's Worth of Mountains

At the Xuanmiao Temple, a fine spring rain fell, a gentle, drifting drizzle. Inside the temple, several disciples were busy with their cultivation, their forms like gliding fish as they wove through the downpour, riding streaks of light. In their hands, pale green radiance continuously gathered, coalescing into wisps of flowing energy.

A middle-aged Abbot with a slightly square face and simple clothes walked along the stone steps, his robes hitched up, wooden clogs clattering. His movements were like those of an ordinary person with no cultivation. Upon reaching the front of the courtyard, he pushed the door open and smiled, "Please, come in, Zhaojing!"

A Daoist Master in white robes with gold patterns entered through the doorway. He had a proper, dignified appearance and looked quite young. His eyes held no ferocity, yet his calm gaze was enough to make the disciples on either side lower their heads. Li Ximing followed him past the steps and replied, "This spring rain is a rare sight. I see your temple's disciples are all busy gathering qi. It seems they look forward to this day every year. No wonder I haven't seen Qiuxin."

Sumian merely smiled as he welcomed him, "Qiuxin left a while ago. The matters in the Eastern Sea are truly troublesome, and he must be there to oversee them. As for the spring rain, we gather it every year, but it's never enough. Sometimes, I even have to use my Divine Ability to refine it myself."

He let out a laugh and continued, "Your clan has quite a few cultivators. If you're willing, could you have them help me collect some from the lake as well?"

'That old man is a miser, plucking feathers from every passing goose.' Li Ximing chuckled, "Of course. As long as I can take a look at your Qi-Gathering Art, my clan's cultivators can gather the qi and come to your temple to trade for some spiritual items."

"I'll send it to your clan shortly." Sumian's confidence was unshakeable, not in the least bit concerned about the Qi-Gathering Art being leaked. Li Ximing, however, was not intimidated. The Li clan was short on many things, but cultivators were not one of them. Many had time on their hands, and a small side business would be a good thing.

After speaking, Li Ximing sighed inwardly and said again, "It's only been a few days, and a formation has already been built on the late Senior Changxi's mountain! That old Daoist Master certainly works fast... It seems this spirit mountain is quite useful!"

Sumian smiled without a word. When they reached the courtyard, they saw a woman in a yellow satin robe, her eyes marked with a touch of blue at the corners. It was Daoist Master Tinglan of the Purple Smoke Gate. Li Ximing wasn't surprised. He greeted her and took a seat directly.

Li Ximing had received a message from Sumian earlier, saying they needed to discuss the matter of the Profound Peak Gate. He knew for sure that Sumian would not be the only one at the Xuanmiao Temple. At least one of Tinglan or Lingmei would be there, and perhaps Yehui himself.

Picking up his cup, Li Ximing did not beat around the bush. "Fellow Daoist Sumian, what's your proposal?"

Sumian nodded with a smile and replied, "This matter should have been dealt with a long time ago. We delayed it for a few months to save some face for Profound Peak. Now that Tinglan has come to visit and brought it up with me, I've invited you over."

Li Ximing smiled, "Has Fellow Daoist Yehui already been here?"

Sumian hesitated slightly, but Tinglan took over the conversation. "He came once, clarified his conditions, and then we invited you."

She looked at him more intently and said in a gentle voice, "Enemies are better resolved than created. We are all Purple Mansion cultivators. It's only natural for the cultivators below us to stir up trouble and for you to take notice, to have some thoughts of your own. It's just a matter of preserving your honor. There's no need to truly become enemies... We can play a game of chess, but we don't have to get truly angry."

Regardless of whether the Li clan and Capital immortals Dao were truly enemies, Tinglan was helping to resolve the matter for her own sake. It was likely she had orchestrated the entire thing. Li Ximing, of course, understood her good intentions. He still had to show respect to this Daoist Master of the Purple Smoke Gate. He straightened his expression and said, "Fellow Daoist Tinglan is absolutely right. Senior Yehui and I have clashed once or twice, and we've played a round of chess in Jiangnan and Jiangbei, but it hasn't escalated to true enmity. This matter should be simple to resolve."

Sumian's influence was clearly not as great as Tinglan's, but the old Daoist Master didn't care in the slightest. As long as he could persuade these two who were constantly clashing and prevent himself from being dragged into it, it would be a success for him. The old Daoist Master asked, "I heard you went to investigate. Did you find anything?"

Li Ximing nodded. "I asked another Daoist Master to divine the matter. The guest elder in the sect was Fu En, and the one who died earlier was Kong Haiying. The soul lamp had been tampered with by Daoist Master Changxi and was no longer his. As for Kong Tingyun... I don't know where she is making her breakthrough."

Hearing that he had consulted a Daoist Master for a divination, Sumian couldn't help but take a sip of his tea. Tinglan, however, smiled, "Then it's simple. I have a friend who cultivates near the World's Navel. Her name is Zhugong, and she's been thinking about moving into this place. With that, the matter can be settled."

Sumian raised an eyebrow and asked, "Tinglan, if your friend takes this place, isn't she afraid that if Kong Tingyun successfully makes a breakthrough, she will come seeking revenge?"

"Just listen to me," Tinglan said, blinking. This Daoist Master, who hailed from the Qi region, had a beauty that was different from the poised elegance of Jiangnan. She smiled, "I will make it clear to Yehui that Zhaojing is willing to give up Profound Peak and allow him to enter the sect's gate to search on his own. But after he's searched and plundered, and moved any mountains he wishes to, the sect's gate must be returned to me."

"Then, when Yehui brings his people to attack the mountain, Zhaojing can resist a few times, dismantle the Hundred Mountains Concealed Storage Spirit Array, feign defeat, retreat, and hand over the sect gate to him. After leaving some spiritual items behind, Yehui will finish collecting and searching, and I'll have my friend come to seize the mountain and get Yehui to give it up."

She held out her hand and pressed down on each finger one by one. "For you, Moongaze, wouldn't gaining the formation, the Profound Peak Dao lineage, and the support of the people be better than guarding that one piece of land and inviting the covetousness and jealousy of all those around you? Even if, by some miraculous chance, someone successfully makes a breakthrough, Zhaojing's actions would be completely justified... He'd even gain a debt of gratitude!"

"As for Capital immortals, they'll have plundered the spiritual items and cultivation arts, moved the mountains they wanted, and resolved a deeply-rooted enmity. While they won't get Shanji and Profound Peak, it's enough to save their face! As for where Kong Tingyun might be, that's his problem. Having gone to this extent, is he still afraid of offending Profound Peak?"

She took a slow sip of her tea, her expression serious. "And for Yehui... What's good about Profound Peak is the cluster of spiritual lands within the sect, not its geographical location. If he were to truly devour this place, controlling such a vast territory across a river, he would be stretched too thin. Besides, being so high-profile isn't necessarily a good thing."

"As for Daoist Master Zhugong, she will have righteously gained this mountain from an enemy. She won't have to bear the resentment of Profound Peak, and she can even show favor by accepting and heavily promoting the Profound Peak cultivators... Once she establishes a relationship of gratitude and kinship, even if someone truly makes a breakthrough and returns, what could they say? It might even turn an enemy into a friend!"

"And for me and Old Daoist Master Qi... we won't have to worry about your affairs anymore."

She finished her explanation just as she finished her cup of tea and the game of chess on the board. Each Purple Mansion cultivator had received their share of the spoils. The courtyard fell silent for a moment. Sumian was a little dazed by what he heard. He sighed, "I have long heard that the orthodox path is skilled at chess, and that Purple Mansion cultivators can avoid danger and profit in the invisible... This is truly the case! This grand scheme of yours, Daoist Master, has left this old man in awe!"

While Sumian was showering her with flattery, Tinglan shook her head, a complex look of lingering fear in her eyes. She smiled, "Old Daoist Master, you are too kind. I have only watched a few of the Purple Mansion games over the past few years. It's nothing compared to the methods of Chuting and Qiushui, or Yuanxiu and Changxiao... It's just a few minor tricks compared to even Tian'an and Chi Wei's schemes!"
