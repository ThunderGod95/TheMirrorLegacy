# Chapter 855: The Demonic Disciple

Li Jiangqian’s sharp cry jolted Qian Lizi from her trance. The woman paused in mid-air, her face pale as she turned back, as if waking from a dream.

“Someone killed cultivators from the Hall of the Locust Soul!” she announced, her voice trembling.

Li Jiangqian had feared the Purple Smoke Sect’s leader would simply ride the winds north without a second thought. Seeing that she was still clear-headed was a relief, but the meaning of her words quickly sank in. “Someone?” he repeated in a low, questioning tone.

She had said ‘someone,’ not ‘the True Monarch.’ It was possible that Lin Feng wasn't the one who had killed the Hall of the Locust Soul’s cultivators.

But in this day and age, who could kill them? Who would dare?

Seeing the pale, shaken look on Qian Lizi’s face, Li Jiangqian watched as she answered, a mixture of horror and shock in her voice.

“It can’t be this soon… It’s far too early. At this stage, it should be a Qi Refining junior managing to escape from a Foundation Establishment Realm master! How could they have fallen? And more than one of them… Someone else has intervened…”

The stage in Jiangbei had been set by the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and the other powers along the riverbanks. For something like this to happen now, especially while Tinglan was away, spelled trouble.

‘It’s truly one link in a chain leading to the next,’ Li Jiangqian thought, his expression turning grim. ‘All was calm until it wasn't, and then one move could unleash a cataclysmic storm.’

He lowered his voice and asked, “To move against the Hall of the Locust Soul… Will the north not… object?”

Qian Lizi, her face still ashen, shook her head. She bit her lip. “This… This is of little consequence to the north. The Hall of the Locust Soul was part of our arrangement. As long as the True Monarch is present, there will always be a stage. It hardly matters if it’s built in the east or the west, or which pawn plays the fool… If another power is dissatisfied with the stage we've built, they are welcome to tear it down…”

She continued, “After all, every time the True Monarch graces the world with his presence, new grotto-heavens and mystic realms appear for us to divide. There are always benefits to be had. What's happened now is… someone is fanning the flames and has torn down a corner of the stage.”

Li Jiangqian’s gaze hardened. He understood that the grotto-heaven at Dongli Mountain had been the last ‘benefit.’ He raised an eyebrow. “How will Senior Han… respond to this?”

The situation in Jiangbei was spiraling out of control. With Tinglan gone, Li Jiangqian desperately wanted to avoid having Qian Lizi manage affairs. She was, in all likelihood, one of the women left behind by the former True Monarch. Who knew what kind of hidden dangers she represented? She was a ticking time bomb.

He had no idea what assurances Tinglan possessed that made her confident enough to let Qian Lizi control the Purple Smoke Gate. A thick cloud of suspicion rose in his mind.

‘Strange. Daoist Master Tinglan is a shrewd woman. Is she truly certain that the True Monarch will never meet Qian Lizi?’

As he mulled it over, Qian Lizi quickly regained her composure. “The priority right now is to find out what’s happening in the north,” she said softly. “I must trouble your clan to contact the Capital immortals Dao. I will go to Lake Xian to investigate.”

Without waiting for a reply, the woman turned her magical wind. “As for the matter of the Daoist Master, your clan should make a decision quickly. After I visit Lake Xian, I must return to my blessed land to confer with the elders. If you have any news, you can send a message to the Purple Smoke Gate.”

With a brief farewell, she and the other Purple Smoke Gate disciples on the island flew eastward on the wind. Only then did the Li family members gather around. Qu Bushi finally approached, his head lowered in a somewhat disheveled state.

Li Jiangqian gestured for him to rise. “What news? Have you found out which major figure fell in the north?”

Qu Bushi’s expression was grave. He took a step forward and spoke in a hushed tone. “Nothing on that yet, but this subordinate has received other news. The Buddhist cultivators under Chengyun, the Yaosa Chengmi, have already crossed Chengshui Marsh and entered the territory of Xuanmiao Temple. They are proselytizing their Buddhist cultivation methods far and wide.”

“The Capital immortals Dao did not stop them, allowing the group of Buddhist cultivators to pass through their lands and head toward Baihai Creek. There seems to be some chaos in the region.”

The last sliver of hope in Li Jiangqian’s heart died. If the Yaosa Chengmi were in Xuanmiao Temple’s territory, an entire Capital immortals Dao’s domain separated them from the Hall of the Locust Soul. It was impossible that the two groups had fought each other.

‘Someone else must have interfered.’

Li Jiangqian waved him away and returned to the hall in silence. He relayed the recent developments, and a heavy quiet fell over the room. It was Li Minggong who broke the silence.

“Two Daoist Masters are clashing in the north, a fact our family was unaware of,” he said softly. “Yet Crimson Reef Island deliberately ambushed us to probe our situation. That alone reveals their stance. And since Daoist Master Zhu Gong went north to provide aid, it’s unlikely she was the one who intentionally let them through.”

“Crimson Reef Island…”

Li Jiangqian shook his head. “Guo Hongjian cultivates the Merging Fire. He cannot be judged by ordinary standards. If there wasn’t a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability at play, Guo Hongjian’s probe was likely an unexpected opportunity for all the clans…”

“As for the Sacred Writ Gate, even if Daoist Master Zhu Gong sides with the Purple Smoke Gate, letting Guo Hongjian through to test for our Daoist Master’s whereabouts is understandable… This situation… it’s too complicated. With the Luoxia, Supreme Yang, and Zhao Buddhists involved, and layers upon layers of Purple Mansion Realm powers beneath them, you can’t see the full picture without the right background. I don’t think it would be wise for our Daoist Master to return.”

Though his face was etched with worry, Li Xuanxuan understood the priorities. After listening, he stroked his beard and said, “Indeed. Daoist Master Tinglan was the one managing the situation before. She, a prominent figure of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and the Purple Smoke blessed land, was still ambushed and went missing. Now that the other major powers refuse to take her seat, they suddenly think of our family.”

“As for the north, though it is extremely dangerous, our family currently has the advantage of acting first…”

The sky over the north had already opened up, and a torrential downpour now fell upon Moongaze Lake. Li Jiangqian could smell the danger in the air. Beside him, Li Que'wan spoke gently.

“I fear this is a clash between titans. Whether it’s the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition or the forces aligned against it, neither is a power our family can afford to provoke. We should just give her a reply and leave it at that.”

“Agreed.”

Li Jiangqian seemed lost in thought for a moment before he spoke again. “First, let’s observe the situation. I will send someone to the Purple Smoke Gate with our reply. We will say that our family has issued a warning, but when the Daoist Master can arrive—or whether he’ll be intercepted by the Changxiao Gate along the way—is another matter entirely.”

“That is the first step. The second… with our Daoist Master gone, news from Jiangbei is shrouded in mist. The situation there changes in a heartbeat; waiting for news to arrive could take an eternity. We must appease the Capital immortals Dao and use them to observe Jiangbei, especially since Yehui is too selfish to even leave a single message… The Capital immortals Dao’s trust and reliance on our family is currently very high.”

“But what about Crimson Reef Island…?”

“No matter.”

Li Jiangqian picked up a brush. After a moment of thought, he began to write:

“The recent matter has been resolved. The culprit was Guo Hongjian of the Guo clan. He sought to create a rift between our two families to advance his ambitions on the northern shore. I fear this portends trouble regarding the Hall of the Locust Soul. If you have any news, please write to me.”

He read it over twice to ensure no one could discern his family’s internal affairs from the letter. “The Capital immortals Dao and Crimson Reef Island have been on good terms for years,” he said. “We cannot be too direct, lest they think we are sowing discord and become needlessly wary. I will simply link the two events. Let Guan Gongxiao draw his own conclusions…”

The Capital immortals Dao had a representative stationed with the Li family, who could deliver the letter. After folding it, Li Jiangqian immediately had it sent off. He turned to the others, his expression serious.

“I ask you all to keep a close watch on the four lake shores. This is no time for carelessness. If fate is at work and some powerful figure emerges on the shore, we must crush them early!”

“Especially the eastern shore and the wilderness.”

Since someone was sabotaging the stage in Jiangbei, there was no telling what might happen next. While the lake was relatively safe, the eastern shore was now the most vulnerable.

Everyone nodded. Less than half a day later, the long-awaited messenger from the Capital immortals Dao finally arrived. A set of footsteps echoed outside the hall, and the messenger entered, dispelling the illusion masking his face.

“Greetings to the Clan Head!” he said in a low voice.

Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow. “Rise.”

The man had thick brows and large eyes, with a mature and steady bearing. A saber hung at his waist. It was none other than the Capital immortals Dao’s Gongsun Bofan.

He dutifully knelt on one knee. “My master has received the Clan Head’s letter. He is deeply aware of Guo Hongjian’s treachery… and despises him for it…”

He offered a string of pleasantries, but they were empty words. Li Jiangqian remained noncommittal, instead carefully observing the man before him.

Gongsun Bofan’s eyes were dull and his face was pale. Faint gray-tinged scars were visible on his face and neck, as if he had just survived a life-or-death battle and had nearly lost his life.

A sense of foreboding struck Li Jiangqian. “Sir Gongsun… what happened to you?” he asked, his tone grim.

Gongsun Bofan was so heavily injured, yet the Capital immortals Dao had sent him to deliver a message across the lake instead of letting him recuperate. A strong sense of danger washed over Li Jiangqian. As expected, the swordsman’s face was etched with bitterness.

“I was wounded by another…”

“Reporting to the Old Master, my master is equally perplexed by the matter you inquired about. The murder of the Hall of the Locust Soul’s cultivators was utterly unexpected, and it happened in their very heartland. My Daoist tradition is overwhelmed and has no resources to investigate.”

“As for the river… there are very few of our people left. I implore your clan to refrain from issuing any challenges, lest it lead to an awkward situation.”

Li Jiangqian feigned shock and anger. “How could it have come to this?!”

Gongsun Bofan had always been a steady figure, a man who had even earned praise from Li Zhouwei years ago. But even someone as composed as him was filled with fear and dread as he recounted the events.

“Clan Head, within our domain… a demonic disciple has appeared. I don't know what kind of inheritance he stumbled upon, but he emerged from a minor clan, suddenly broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, and proceeded to kill a city lord, slaughter the guards, and plunder spiritual treasures…”

“Not all of our cultivators were on the river; several were guarding our territories. When the arrays shattered and Spiritual Talismans flared, they immediately went to provide support. Who could have imagined… they would be killed by this demonic disciple who had just reached the Foundation Establishment Realm!”

Li Jiangqian listened intently, stunned. “And then?”

Gongsun Bofan shook his head, a look of lingering fear on his face. “I was the first to arrive… I never expected him to throw three talismans at me. Their power was terrifying. If I hadn’t diligently practiced Dharma Arts over the years and refined my cultivation, I doubt I would have escaped with my life.”

“Ancient talismans of that caliber would be considered a trump card even for the direct lineage of my master’s clan, yet he used those three as if they were common trinkets, without the slightest hesitation… It allowed him to escape.”

“Our cultivators have now spread out to scour every inch of Baiye Creek to find him. My sect master is short on manpower, so he sent me here.”

Li Jiangqian’s heart pounded as he listened.

‘This must be a key figure brought forth by the True Monarch, and he was already at the Foundation Establishment Realm when discovered… Back then, a single Qi Refining junior like Xu Xiao was enough to cause our family immense trouble. For this one to emerge only after reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm is truly deadly!’

‘Worse, we don't know if this person is friend or foe. If he intends to align himself with the True Monarch… the Capital immortals Dao is about to be gravely wounded. They’re in for a world of hurt!’

Looking at Gongsun Bofan’s ashen face, Li Jiangqian was secretly astonished. He knew that the Capital immortals Dao, being situated in Jiangbei, would have more troubles than his own clan, but he had never imagined something so fierce and humiliating. “Then what is your master’s intention?” he asked.

A look of determination crossed Gongsun Bofan’s face. “My master says this person cannot have gone far; he must still be in Jiangbei. If the opportunity arises, he hopes your clan can offer timely aid and lend us a hand.”

No wonder the message from Guan Gongxiao had cursed Guo Hongjian so thoroughly. The Capital immortals Dao was also facing a critical moment. With a demonic disciple emerging from within their own ranks, their presence on the river was as good as non-existent. And Guo Hongjian was over on the other side, provoking the Li family on their behalf! If the Li family truly grew angry and crossed the river to attack, they would be assaulted from both inside and out…

It was a testament to Guan Gongxiao’s usually calm demeanor that he was still able to write letters. A man with a shorter temper would have coughed up blood from the rage.

But this turn of events made Guan Gongxiao’s request for help incredibly awkward. Why would Li Jiangqian want to get involved in this mess? He put on a look of anger and disappointment and sighed.

“I understand that our fates are linked, that we must help each other. But your sect and Crimson Reef Island are as one! How could Guo Hongjian understand that? Now he’s running around with a set of hidden magical artifacts. How can my family dare to let anyone venture out?”

Gongsun Bofan was not a thick-skinned man and looked somewhat ashamed. Li Jiangqian didn’t give him a chance to interrupt, continuing with a regretful tone.

“The moment Guo’s clan appeared in the wilderness from the Eastern Sea, I suspected something was about to happen in Jiangbei. My letter was meant as a warning, but I didn’t expect it to be a step too late!”

He shook his head. “But rest assured, my family has its own share of troubles. We will not take this opportunity to cross the river. You should return for now. Let’s ensure news between Jiangbei and here travels more frequently, so our two families can aid each other at a moment’s notice.”

Gongsun Bofan nodded repeatedly at his words. “Thank you for your understanding, Clan Head…”

With that, he took his leave.

Li Jiangqian saw him out of the hall, watching his figure disappear into the distance as his mind churned.

In truth, Guan Gongxiao wasn’t afraid of the Li clan crossing the river to seize territory. Jiangbei was currently being roasted over a fire; what benefit was there to be had? What he feared was Li Jiangqian acting out of anger and launching an attack. Any casualties on either side could lead to unpredictable consequences.

‘As for sending the heavily injured Gongsun Bofan to deliver the message… I doubt it was because they lacked manpower. More likely, they’re using his arduous journey back and forth as bait to lure out the escaped demonic disciple… a clever scheme, I suppose.’

‘Thankfully… the Capital immortals Dao still has Guan Gongxiao… a man who knows when to bow his head and can maintain some control. Without him, both our families would be in deep trouble right now.’

He had just turned around when a young man in black robes landed in the hall amidst the downpour. His face was grim as he knelt on one knee.

“Clan Head, the Hall of the Locust Soul has crossed the river.”

Li Jiangqian’s head snapped up. He sighed inwardly.

‘As I expected! Trouble has arrived right on schedule!’

He raised an eyebrow and asked urgently, “How many men? Is Daoist Bai leading them personally?”

Chen Yang’s expression was grave. He nodded. “Daoist Bai is leading them across the river. They are currently in the wilderness!”
