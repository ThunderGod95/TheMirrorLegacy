# Chapter 732: News from Mount Jingyi

The battle in the wilderness had subsided.

Li Zhouwei was not lightly injured. After taking some medicine, he made a gentle gesture. The towering gatehouse in the sky vanished, transforming into a stream of light that flew back to him. Immediately, three streaks of light shot up from below in a desperate attempt to flee.

But if they could not escape during the height of battle, what chance did they have now that they had fallen into the hands of the Li Clan? Several cultivators closed in, seizing the three Dharma Artifacts and delivering them into Li Zhouwei's hands.

He stored them away and, enduring the pain, descended on a beam of light.

The Li Clan's foundation in the wilderness was shallow, with few garrisons to speak of. The Kong Clan, however, had been cultivating their presence here for a century. With the surge in spiritual Qi over the last decade, they had tightened their control and built numerous palaces.

They landed at the nearest one. Li Chenghui approached, his face etched with concern. Li Zhouwei let out a breath and asked, "How is everyone's condition?"

In the chaos of battle, no one could keep track of every detail unless a cultivator fell. Li Chenghui had already made a quick assessment.

"Only Miaoshui and Li Wen are seriously wounded," he answered concisely.

Everyone on the field was injured to some degree, so for Li Chenghui to single them out meant they were wounded to the point of incapacitation. Li Zhouwei still felt the urge to vomit blood.

"The Profound Peak Gate has a Pristine Water cultivator of the 'Spring's Echo' and a Wood Virtue cultivator of the 'Verdant Grove'," he said urgently. "Get them here to help."

Li Chenghui helped him settle into a hall before nodding.

"I'll go at once. The 'Spring's Echo' cultivator, Elder Bai, was killed in the fighting. Elder Sun of the 'Verdant Grove' is in better shape. I'll bring him."

As Li Chenghui departed, Li Zhouwei gritted his teeth and swallowed blood, forcing himself to sit on the main seat for a quarter of an hour. The stars in his vision slowly faded, and his sight returned to normal. He exhaled a plume of white mist, finally managing to bring his roiling Qi and blood under control. His complexion returned to normal, masking his weakness.

The white mist spread, filling the entire palace with the fragrance of peonies. A moment later, a group of people entered, led by Li Chenghui, to make their report.

Li Chenghui was largely unharmed, having expended nothing more than a Profound Thunder talisman. Behind him, Cui Jueyin stood with a lowered gaze, his expression respectful; he had merely consumed some spiritual qi.

The last of the group, Qu Bushi, had a severed arm and a weary expression, but it wasn't a serious concern. The old man was not much of a fighter, but he excelled at self-preservation. His 'Palace of Concealed Storage' was unique; he could simply find a few corpses to mend his severed arm and would be fine after some rest.

As for Miaoshui, who was not present, her injuries were severe. She had been struck down in the final moments of the battle, her body cut into three pieces as she plummeted from the sky. Qu Bushi had managed to find her and use a Wanling Flower to keep her alive. A moment's delay, and the cultivator from Jiangbei would have perished in the wilderness.

Although Miaoshui was a surrendered general from the Dense Cloud Cave, she had fought valiantly, perhaps in an attempt to atone for her past or to display her loyalty. She had nearly given her life. Li Zhouwei naturally couldn't ignore her sacrifice. "See that she is well cared for," he ordered. "I will ask a Daoist Master to save her."

The final casualty, Li Wen, possessed the Immortal Foundation 'Jade Court General'. Though not of a high grade, it was still a Dharma Body. He had only lost four fingers and suffered shattered bones throughout most of his body. He was immobilized but not in any mortal danger.

After hearing the report on his clan's cultivators, Li Zhouwei's mind began to settle. The Profound Peak Gate had served as the main force in the battle, and their guest elders—willingly or not—had been positioned to shield the Li Clan's own people. As a result, his clan's losses were not substantial.

'But this means nearly all the significant casualties were on the Profound Peak's side,' he mused. 'My family fought with all its strength, but the Profound Peak guest elders were practically used as sacrificial pawns. From a quick glance, I'd say they lost nearly five Foundation Establishment cultivators in that one battle...'

'Forget the guest elders... I imagine even the direct descendants of the Profound Peak Gate are terrified by now...'

After the arduous journey to reach Foundation Establishment, a cultivator could expect to be an honored guest anywhere they went. Who would willingly throw their life away after seeing so many peers perish in a single fight? The "Profound Peak" name wasn't a magic charm that inspired suicidal loyalty. The only reason they hadn't scattered at the start was the immense pressure from their own Purple Mansion Realm masters.

Knowing this full well, he deliberately inquired about the Profound Peak Gate.

The cultivator from the Profound Peak Gate, Elder Sun of the 'Verdant Grove', wore coarse hemp clothes and had an aged, desolate air about him. "To answer the Clan Head," he began, "we lost two early-stage and one mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. An early-stage direct descendant was crippled... We also killed one of the Capital immortals Dao's mid-stage elders and an early-stage cultivator, and... and..."

He seemed to find the next words difficult to say. "Two of our retainers were captured. One of them... surrendered before he was even out of our territory..."

It was a matter of shame, and it was unlikely the other captured retainer would hold out. Elder Sun fell silent.

Li Chenghui spoke up. "The remaining direct descendants are Kong Qiuyan and Kong Xiaxiang at the early Foundation Establishment realm, Kong Guli at the mid-stage, and the Gate Master Kong Guxi at the late-stage. Among the guest elders, we have Elder Sun Bo here at mid-stage and Fu Yuezi at late-stage. The other two guest elders... are incapacitated."

Li Zhouwei noted the presence of the Kong Clan members but didn't see Kong Guxi. The Profound Peak Gate Master had fought the hardest and was likely half-dead himself. He cut straight to the point. "How much of Shanji Prefecture did you manage to hold?"

Sun Bo looked startled for a moment, then replied in a low voice, "We secured about sixty percent. We only have the twenty-seven towns in the south. We've lost the mountains and the market. The main gate of the sect remains intact... The young master is cultivating within the sect and is unharmed."

The "young master" was, of course, Li Jianglong. With Changxi dead, the people of the Profound Peak Gate were desperate to see Li Jianglong return to the Li Clan safely. They would never allow him to come to harm. Li Zhouwei wasn't concerned about him, but he sighed inwardly. 'Without outside help, it will be difficult for them to even hold their current territory, let alone control Shanji Prefecture. They should have ceded it to the Purple Smoke Gate earlier in exchange for assistance.'

With no word yet from his own Daoist Master, Li Zhouwei dared not make any rash moves. He dismissed the group and waited. A short while later, the news he had been waiting for finally arrived from the west. Elder White Ape's figure appeared before the hall. Li Zhouwei hurried to greet him. "What is the situation in Funan?"

Elder White Ape reported everything. Li Zhouwei let out a breath of relief, but when he heard that An Siwei had been captured, he froze for a second before his expression hardened. "Immediately send someone with Situ Ku and try to exchange him for Elder Siwei! Once the Capital immortals Dao takes him away... it will be a completely different matter!"

If the Li Clan offered to trade Situ Ku for An Siwei, Situ Mo would surely agree with both hands raised. But once An Siwei was taken away by Guan Gongxiao's people, the situation would change entirely.

Guan Gongxiao wouldn't give Situ Ku a second glance.

Elder White Ape immediately clasped his fist and withdrew. An Siwei's strength was not outstanding, but his loyalty was unwavering and his contributions were significant. Li Zhouwei did not want anything to happen to him.

He paced the hall for a few steps, feeling the hope for this plan was slim. Furthermore, Li Ximing was still entangled with Daoist Master Yehui in the Great Void. An Siwei's chances of returning were pitifully small.

'Guan Gongxiao is no fool. Although Elder Siwei is not a powerful combatant, as an elder of my clan, he surely possesses valuable information. Guan Gongxiao knows this. He'll demand An Siwei from Situ Mo... and Situ Mo has no grounds to refuse!'

***

On the riverbank, the spiritual Qi in the air still vibrated from the recent battle. The grass and trees on the ground were wilted. Cultivators were dispatched to tend to the spirit veins scarred by True Fire and Geng Metal, but the ruins themselves were bustling with activity.

Although both sides coveted the territory of the wilderness and had tried to keep the fighting in the sky, collateral damage was unavoidable. Fortunately, an enemy cultivator had died on the spot, invigorating the water veins and preventing a major loss of spiritual Qi.

Kong Guxi descended from the sky and lifted his robes. The flesh on his legs looked as if it had been chewed by dogs, with chunks missing here and there, exposing translucent flesh and tender white cartilage.

'The Capital immortals Dao's Dharma Artifacts are truly formidable. This won't be easy to heal.'

His spiritual qi was depleted, preventing any self-healing. Worse, the wounds were infused with the enemy's lingering power. He quickly swallowed two pills and covered his legs, then addressed a disciple who had come to greet him. "Several of the Peak Lords are grievously injured. I saw that Elder Sun and Elder Wu were still in fair condition. Where have they gone?"

The disciple stammered for a moment. "Reporting to the Gate Master, the two lords have gone to Lord Chenghui's hall to make their report."

Kong Guxi paused, then nodded quickly. "Good... good... I've been too slow. I'll head over right now."

He glanced around. Not a single guest elder was in sight. Only his own kinswoman, Kong Qiuyan, was in the camp, tending to the wounded. Most of the other Foundation Establishment cultivators were down, and those still standing had rushed to greet the Li Clan.

Looking closer, Kong Guxi noticed that even the sect disciples they had brought were few and far between. There were only a handful left, with a dozen or so lying on the ground, groaning in pain.

He couldn't help but ask, "The disciples of the Seventeen Peaks... why are there so few left?"

The great battle had not involved many Qi Refining or Embryonic Breathing cultivators. While the Foundation Establishment masters fought in the sky, the Profound Peak disciples on the ground had mostly faced the gentry clans from across the river—hardly formidable opponents. Although the enemy had more Foundation Establishment cultivators and there were accidental killings, the losses shouldn't have been this catastrophic.

The disciple hesitated, unsure how to explain. Some things were apparent to him, a mere disciple, that might not be to the lofty Gate Master. He lowered his voice. "Reporting to the Gate Master... the brothers fought a retreating battle along the river. Perhaps they flew too far and lost their way. They should return after a short while."

"Lost their way?!"

Kong Guxi had not been in charge for long, but he was no fool. Hearing those words and seeing the disciple's expression, understanding dawned on him. He pursed his lips and said bitterly, "Oh... let them go... it's for the best."

The Profound Peak Gate had not been built from nothing. Most of its disciples came from the gentry clans of Lake Xian and Shanji Prefecture. With those lands now in enemy hands, their own families were in peril. It was only natural for the disciples to flee. Though a cold sorrow filled his heart, Kong Guxi understood.

'Once Shanji is completely lost, another wave will leave.'

Wincing in pain, Kong Guxi took to the air. A man in ochre armor with a black-patterned mask flew over to him, holding a spear and an axe, his body covered in blood. He bowed before Kong Guxi, his voice hoarse. "Fu Yuezi has just tended to his wounds and comes at once to pay respects to the Gate Master."

Fu Yuezi had fought one against four, and two of his ribs had been shattered, exposing the stark white bone beneath. Kong Guxi hurried to help him up, patting his shoulder. "Go and see Lord Chenghui. Why are you wasting time seeing me?"

Fu Yuezi stubbornly refused to move. Kong Guxi, severely injured himself, lacked the strength to push him and sighed, taking a step back. Just then, another old man hurried over, stopping hesitantly nearby. His hair was disheveled, his crown askew, his eyes red and bloodshot—a picture of utter misery.

The moment Kong Guxi saw him, it was as if a hole had been smashed in a frozen lake, and an icy chill shot to his heels. The heel on his left foot had been sheared off, and a phantom pain flared through the empty space. "Old brother... what is the meaning of this?" he asked.

This old man was the messenger Kong Guxi had sent to Mount Jingyi as soon as Changxi had fallen. He had crushed a jade talisman, signaling for the messenger to request aid. Now, he had returned in this pathetic state. The old man dropped to his knees with a thud, weeping and lamenting as he spoke. "The people stationed at the market near Mount Jingyi said... said Daoist Master Xuanyi is not on the mountain... That disciple was so arrogant, he wouldn't even deign to look me in the eye!"

"I asked for news of our seventeenth brother, but they said he refused to see me. The family sent eight letters before... he never answered a single one... And now... now! I went to Yuezhou Island, and they drove me away!"

"What!"

The breath caught in Kong Guxi's lungs. He was so stunned he could hardly breathe. Several moments passed before he could recover, his voice filled with disbelief. "Didn't he ask the sect for resources just before the new year?"

"He did..."

Understanding crashed down on Kong Guxi, and he nearly collapsed. The man who had not shed a single tear while his flesh was torn apart in battle now broke down into sobs. He let out two choked cries before stifling them, like a rooster being strangled.

"Alas... it's over... How will I ever explain this to Daoist Master Zhaojing!"

He wiped his tears. With his brother and Daoist Master Xuanyi proving unreliable, Kong Guxi feared the Li Clan would decide to retreat, sealing their doom.

Beside him, Kong Qiuyan was equally terrified. She glanced at her Gate Master and asked helplessly, "What can we do... He's climbed ashore and refuses to touch a sinking ship..."

A heavy silence fell over them. Kong Guxi's elder brother, the messenger, looked around with a miserable expression. "Where is everyone?" he asked.

Those two words struck them like a hammer blow. Seeing their faces, the old man understood. He went limp as if his bones had been removed. "The Xuanmiao Temple watches from the sidelines, Mount Jingyi slams the door in our face... Our family is in dire straits. It would be better to abandon the sect and find a place to live on the sea... At least there would be a chance of survival!"

Kong Qiuyan silently closed her eyes. "Who would go with you to some godforsaken place? Sun Bo? Which of the guest elders? And what random island could possibly support several Foundation Establishment cultivators?"

At their side, Fu Yuezi dropped to his knees again, his voice thick with emotion. "Wherever the Gate Master goes, Fu Yuezi will follow, even unto death!"

Kong Guxi listened in abject terror, his soul nearly flying from his body. "What nonsense are you spouting!" he roared. "We will follow the Daoist Master's arrangements! Who gave you the audacity to make such suggestions!"

Leave the mainland?

Never mind how important the Profound Peak Mountain was, or that their own elders were in seclusion there, even if the mountain fell, Kong Guxi would never dare to entertain the thought of leaving. It was madness!

'What is this? This is a slap in the face to the Li Clan... If we do that... where in this vast world could we possibly hide?'

A wave of dread washed up his spine, pulling him from his grief and rage. His face flushed crimson as he shouted, "You will all remember this! Even if the Kong Clan must die, we will die in Jiangnan! We will die fighting the Capital immortals Dao! As long as the Daoist Master allows it, even if there is only a single plot of land for us to stand on, as long as we can look up and see the spirit mountains of the north, we are not going anywhere!"

"Brother, if you speak such words again, do not blame my sword for being merciless!"
