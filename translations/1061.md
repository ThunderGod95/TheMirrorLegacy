# Chapter 1061: First Residence

Li Ximing listened for a while and felt a sense of sudden enlightenment. He said thoughtfully, 'When I cultivate, I sense that the Ancient Merging methods are all different. Whether it's the Five Virtues or the Twelve Qis, they all have similar marvels and are combined, but the Ancient Merging itself is extremely different. At the time, I often attributed it to the strangeness of ancient methods... simply the principles of heaven and earth.'

He paused and replied, "I visited Poluoduo once in my early years and heard the term 'Three Shamans and Two Rites' there. I thought it was just a classification within the Ancient Merging, but I never expected it to be relevant here!"

Lingdu raised his eyebrows, a slight smile appearing.

"Poluoduo was originally a barren, savage land, but quite a few ancient cultivators seeking tranquility, or perhaps demonic cultivators fleeing disaster, went there. It's natural that some legacies were left behind."

He then turned, pouring tea, and said, "Our Daoist Tradition of Tai-Tao and the Nine Mounds is passed down from Azure Profoundity. This Nine Mounds Mountain beneath our feet was also called Spirit-Pacifying Moon-Clear Mountain in ancient times. However, as Yin and Yang waned, it became vastly different from before. In terms of our Daoist Tradition, we are inheritors of the 'Yin-Yang Primacy Doctrine.'"

He smiled. "This isn't hard to explain. Within our Daoist Tradition, Yin and Yang are held higher than the Five Virtues. There are, and only are, Three Yin and Three Yang. As for how to coordinate the methods of the Ancient Merging, there are various disagreements within the mountain. The 'Prime Virtue Doctrine' also has quite a few adherents..."

"Jiangnan successively experienced proselytizing by the Chu State and the Immortal Mansion. The overarching Daoist Canon there is based on Yin-Yang, the Five Virtues, and the Twelve Qis. Although they don't compare Yin-Yang and the Five Virtues in hierarchy, they also recognize Three Yin and Three Yang, which is similar to us."

Li Ximing didn't know the purpose of comparing the hierarchy of Yin-Yang and the Five Virtues, but it didn't stop him from having a realization. He looked up and asked,

"Placing the Five Virtues above Yin and Yang... that is likely a Northern Daoist Tradition, isn't it?"

Lingdu's hand, which was pouring tea, paused. He hesitated for a moment, then shook his head. "The philosophies within are complex, and the disagreements many. I'm afraid only our Great Daoist Master can make sense of it all. But Zhaojing, if you must speak of something _above_ Yin and Yang... in truth, only 'Pure Qi' has a few adherents who would recognize it as such."

Although his words were reserved, afraid to say too much, Li Ximing was already thoroughly convinced.

'Who in this world places the Five Virtues above Yin and Yang? Using Earth Virtue to shepherd Bright Yang... isn't that an expression of the Five Virtues suppressing Yin and Yang?'

The low, heavy words of Li Zhouwei from years ago surfaced in his mind: 'Too many people in this world want Li Qianyuan dead! The conflict between the North and him isn't just rooted in Daoist Traditions, Dao Paths, and divine abilities; it's also rooted in grievances, philosophies, and cultivation...'

Li Ximing sighed internally. 'Bright Yang being suppressed beneath Earth Virtue... many people were likely unwilling to see that. But Li Qianyuan's path was too tyrannical... so tyrannical that all the immortal cultivators in the world set aside their disputes to deal with him. That is what led to this outcome...'

His thoughts grew complex. He sipped his tea silently for a moment, then set the cup down and smiled.

"This kind of precious ancient secret is something only the Nine Mounds Immortal Dao could possibly decipher, yet Senior has imparted it so generously. Zhaojing has gained much. Thank you, Senior!"

Lingdu smiled and shook his head. Li Ximing turned back to Li Que'wan and smiled.

"This old senior is giving you pointers, holding this profound discussion specifically for you. You must thank him properly."

The meaning behind Lingdu's words was far-reaching; it was obviously not just for Li Que'wan. But regardless of the fundamental purpose, with the Heavenly Glow blazing in the north, some pretext was needed. Li Ximing waited for Li Que'wan to give her thanks, a thought stirring in his mind.

'Old Daoist Master Lingdu is quite amicable, and the Nine Mounds Daoist Tradition seems easy to get along with... Right now, the Wave-Suppressing Mansion is unstable, and it's even harder to say if the Fuxun matter can be handled. If it implicates Senior Liu and a fight breaks out one day while Que'Wan is still in seclusion on that island... then my family will have lost a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator!'

'Since we're already at Nine Mounds, why not rent a cultivation abode and let Que'Wan break through here...'

Li Ximing wasn't worried about other things; this mountain might even be safer than the lake. The difficulty lay in Lingdu's willingness. Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then smiled first.

"Junior came here this time to fulfill an appointment with Daoist Master Yan. It has been several decades since we last parted. I wonder if Daoist Master Yan is well?"

Lingdu stroked his beard and mulled it over for a long time before finally saying, "He's the same as always. A few years ago, an important junior of his failed their breakthrough, which left him mentally and physically exhausted. Then, while traveling the outer seas, he fought with someone—who knows who—and not only failed to get the treasure but also returned injured. Back home, his eldest son caused more trouble, making him so angry he nearly killed him... In short, he's not having a good time."

Li Ximing nodded, seemingly considering something. Lingdu then smiled.

"Que'Wan... it's inconvenient for you to bring her along. Leave her on the mountain. I'll watch over her for you."

Li Ximing had been waiting for those exact words. He had someone lead Li Que'wan away, and only then did his expression turn serious. "Senior, what do you think of this child of my family?"

Lingdu raised an eyebrow and smiled, his tone filled with admiration.

"Rare, truly rare. That body of dharma power and True Essence... I should really have my Nine Mounds disciples take a good look, just to let them know there's always someone better out there!"

Li Ximing lowered his voice.

"It's embarrassing to say, but this junior has also reached the point of needing to assail the divine ability stage. Unfortunately, I have many matters to attend to next, and I don't know when Daoist Master Yan's affair will be concluded. It's hard on her, following me around, rushing from place to place."

Lingdu raised an eyebrow, understanding perfectly.

'He's asking for protection... It's a good thing she's a girl, and not of the Bright Yang bloodline. Otherwise, it would be difficult to forge this connection...'

He laughed and said, "What's so difficult about that? The spiritual atmosphere at Nine Mounds is stable, and Pure Qi is abundant. If, Fellow Daoist, you estimate you have enough time, just have her enter seclusion on my mountain!"

"How could I impose..."

Li Ximing chuckled and exchanged a few polite pleasantries with him, and the matter was thus settled. But this, in turn, reminded Li Ximing of something even more important.

'In all these years, I haven't gathered a single piece of news about Whole Pill spiritual items. If Que'Wan breaks through, she'll have to use the Six-Aspect Ceremonial Hue. What a waste...'

The Six-Aspect Ceremonial Hue wasn't bad; it was _too_ good, to the point of being wasteful. He proceeded to ask Lingdu, but this time the old man finally shook his head. "We once had a 'Prime-Response Metal'. Later, when Daoist Master Qiushui needed to cross the immortal threshold, she collected six types of Whole Pill spiritual items to verify her cultivation, and someone from Golden Feather traded for it."

Li Ximing's teeth practically ached hearing this. He was about to take his leave, but Lingdu stopped him. He took a jade talisman from his robes and smiled. 

"Take this and show it to him, as proof you've already been to Nine Mounds."

Li Ximing paused, then immediately understood.

He was no longer afraid of what Yan Dushui might be plotting; on the contrary, Yan Dushui was now afraid of _him_. If he helped Yan Dushui open the treasure and was then overcome by greed, killing him to seize it, Yan Dushui's old body truly couldn't take it. Having this Nine Mounds jade talisman as a witness would set his mind at ease.

He smiled and accepted it, then rode the wind away from the mountain. He crossed the glittering sea and soon saw the West Curtain Sea.

The high seabed once again appeared below. Decades had passed, but the mortals here were still harvesting reefs for the Panorama Immortal Gate, just as their ancestors had, suffering the calamity of drowning. The only difference was that things looked much more chaotic, which must be due to instability within the Immortal Gate.

He waited for a while. A bright Heavenly Light shone in the sky. After a moment, there was a disturbance in the Great Void, and Daoist Master Lin Yi—Yan Dushui—hurriedly arrived.

The old Daoist Master was still draped in his white feathered robe, his appearance largely unchanged. However, his demeanor was far worse than before. A gloomy, volatile, and sharp light floated in his eyes, lacking the peaceful look of the past. He only restrained it upon seeing him, saying joyfully, 

"Fellow Daoist Zhaojing has arrived!"

The old man, afraid his joy was in vain, stared at him intently. Only when he saw Li Ximing nod with a smile and produce the jade talisman from his sleeve did he comprehend, exclaiming with both joy and envy,

"Zhaojing's cultivation speed is truly formidable."

Li Ximing was no longer the greenhorn who had just set out. He was much more composed. He gave him an extra look and smiled.

"It seems these years have not been easy for Daoist Master Lin Yi."

Yan Dushui led him inside, his expression dark.

"The sensible junior perished, and the ones who remain are unfilial, rotten to the core. Not even a divine ability could save them. Yesterday, I killed a few to rectify the atmosphere on the mountain."

No matter how worthless one's disciples or juniors were, those who resorted to butchering them were few. Li Ximing was slightly taken aback and didn't know how to respond. He understood that the Panorama Immortal Gate had weakened severely over the past decades.

"How did it come to this," he replied.

Yan Dushui looked somewhat lost.

"It's no great matter. I'm more worried that the spirit veins of the West Curtain Sea are failing. It's one thing to have no resources, but as the younger generation's cultivation falters, we're finding fewer and fewer children with spiritual apertures..."

The two passed through layer after layer of the sea region. Yan Dushui then drilled down toward the seabed. Soon, they found a thumb-sized fissure on the sea floor. The two of them flickered, transforming into two streaks of light and tunneled down, going deep.

Li Ximing was bored to death, and his mind started to whirl.

'Yan Dushui seems to be nearing the end of his lifespan... In that case... things must be arranged in advance.'

Yan Dushui owed him a favor for taking action. Li Ximing's original intention for using him was to deal with a Purple Mansion Realm Demon beast, to be used for a sacrifice. If he waited until Yan Dushui perished, even if Jishan couldn't escape the obligation, what use was a group of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators?

'Jiangqian is also about to break through. I must use this guy's favor! And as it happens, there's also Guo Nanwu!'

The two of them sometimes vanished into the Great Void, sometimes leaped out at disconnected points. After traveling an unknown distance, Yan Dushui finally came to a sudden halt. Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. He saw that this place was a cultivation abode. The entrance was very simple, without even a plaque.

The stone door was slightly ajar. The threshold was frighteningly high, reaching an adult's waist. Two small holes were dug on either side, and a faint blue flame burned weakly within them.

Li Ximing's expression finally turned grave. He swept the area carefully with his spiritual sense, only to find that everything before him was a blur. It was even less clear in his spiritual sense than it was to his naked eye!

"This is... 'Exiled Qi'..."

Li Ximing's heart tensed. He heard Yan Dushui say with emotion,

"This is the place!"

He turned his head and instructed solemnly, "Fellow Daoist Zhaojing, this cultivation abode is supported by a single treasure. Normally, the things inside are inert, like dead objects. But as soon as someone enters, the treasure immediately resumes burning. When it burns out, this abode will vanish like smoke..."

"My ancestors entered many times. It has been passed down to this day, and it's already half-burned. Once we enter, we cannot hesitate for even a moment. We must act quickly!"

'As expected of something from the Underworld...'

Li Ximing marveled silently and nodded in agreement.

Yan Dushui stepped inside, his figure flickering between light and shadow. Li Ximing, however, walked forward slowly, stopping at the high threshold. He immediately saw the main hall of the abode. It was pitch black. A table and a stool sat in the center. On the table, there seemed to be a bowl, and within the bowl, a speck of red light shimmered. The rest of the place was dark and deep, like a ghostly mansion.

Spiritual sense was useless here; he could only rely on his blurry vision. Yan Dushui himself hadn't been here many times and looked somewhat terrified. Li Ximing, however, steadied himself and connected with his spiritual sense.

'Immortal Mirror!'

A transcendent feeling descended. In an instant, all the darkness before him vanished. The threshold, the stone table, the stone chair—all of it disappeared! Before him was just an enclosed space of black stone. There was no cultivation abode at all, just a low, short stone hollow, about the size of a desk!

In the center of this stone hollow was a pile of pale black, withered firewood. From a distance, it was just the right size to resemble a dog's kennel.

Scattered on this pale black firewood was a pure white skull, facing upward. Its jaw was tilted high, revealing the empty space within. Looked at this way, it rather resembled a cenotaph dug casually by some cultivator!

Li Ximing swallowed silently. He knew where that "cultivation abode" had come from now.

'This is a pocket realm built by an ancient... a small immortal abode, but it's _attached_ to this skeleton!'

He suddenly understood. Hearing Yan Dushui call to him from within the "abode," he stepped inside. The darkness that rushed to meet him was bone-chillingly cold. Li Ximing gently pinched some of the darkness in his hand and was immediately stunned.

'Purple Qi, Cold Qi... and it seems there's Lesser Yin and Supreme Yin as well...'

Li Ximing looked down and saw, in the bowl on the table, half a stick of faint yellow incense, as thick as a pinky finger. Just one look at it stunned him.

He actually recognized this thing—it was identical to the profound incense Li Zhouwei had brought back from Wanling Heaven!

And the speck of red he had seen from outside the abode was the smoldering, dark fire at the tip of this incense. It had already burned halfway. The other half, a segment of grayish-white ash, lay broken in the bowl, completely intact, not scattered in the slightest.

Yan Dushui walked up to him, his voice tense but hopeful, speaking very quickly.

"Fellow Daoist!"

Li Ximing awoke as if from a dream and quickly followed him inside. They walked several steps, passing through the main hall, and saw an inner chamber.

This chamber was extremely deep and long, shaped like a narrow box. The far end seemed to connect to some empty, vast space, from which a ghostly, cold wind blew, brushing past diamond-shaped jade stones hanging from the ceiling and causing them to _ding_ and _dong_.

The patterns on both sides were arcane, and the various decorations were bizarre and inexplicable, things he had never seen before, carved with numerous Shaman-Registers, birds, beasts, and ghostly symbols. They flickered in and out of sight in the dark mist.

There were three steps in this inner chamber. On the highest, golden, circular platform sat a piece of withered wood. It looked like a piece of broken mulberry that had withered halfway through its growth. The broken end was the size of a fist, but its root system below was wide, nearly as large as a tabletop!

Suspended above the broken surface of this dark mulberry wood was a faint black object: a feather, the length of an index finger and the thickness of a thumb. Its pitch-black surface was entwined with dense golden patterns. It had none of the aura of an immortal, transcendent being; instead, it inspired dread and felt utterly bizarre!

Yan Dushui had already hurried forward. He gently flipped his hand, carefully taking out a light-cyan jade casket covered in profound patterns. It seemed to be an important treasure. He gingerly placed it in Li Ximing's hands and said urgently,

"It's up to you now, Fellow Daoist!"

Li Ximing felt an icy chill as it touched his hands. He looked down, and his pupils finally contracted violently. His mind reeled—he, Li Ximing, had also seen this jade casket before. He even had one in his possession with similar, even mostly identical, patterns!

'The item from the Pingya Island marketplace back then!'
