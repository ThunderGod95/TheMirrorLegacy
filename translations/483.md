# Chapter 715: The Jadeborn One

Li Xuanfeng’s eyes flickered slightly with the light of his perception technique. He couldn’t discern the youth’s true form, but upon hearing the surname Dongfang, he assumed it likely had ties to the Dragon Clan. He nodded and replied, “Fellow Daoist, are you from the Converging Sea’s Dragon Clan?”

Dongfang Heyun wore robes of blue and white, appearing refined, with a polite smile as he replied courteously, “Indeed. I was blessed by the Dragon Monarch, born of cloud and vapor, and now serve the dragons of the Eastern Sea. Thus, I was granted the surname Dongfang.”

Li Xuanfeng didn’t know what this man was up to, so he listened silently as Dongfang Heyun sat across from him and spoke gently, “What a coincidence. While patrolling near the Qunyi Strait, I once saw a young member of your clan flying through the clouds with carefreeness. He accidentally entered Dragon Clan territory, so I took action to escort him out.”

Xizhi…

In recent days at the southern border, Li Xuanfeng had only heard that Li Xizhi was out on an errand for Profound Peak Gate. He hadn’t expected him to have entered Dragon Clan territory. His eyes opened slightly as he replied, “Oh? Then it seems the younger one overstepped his bounds.”

Dongfang Heyun smiled and shook his head, speaking softly, “Yes, that did happen. He was injured by mistake. I’m here to ask how he’s recovering.”

Li Xuanfeng found it a bit unusual, and heard Dongfang Heyun continue, “If he’s mostly recovered, he’s welcome to visit the Converging Sea. I happen to have a bit of affinity with the Heavenly Glow technique.”

Li Xuanfeng couldn’t tell whether his intentions were good or ill, so he responded noncommittally. Only then did Dongfang Heyun rise, politely cup his hands and vanish into wind and rain.

This one is neither man nor dragon. But a creature born of heaven and earth. A troublesome sort. Li Xuanfeng watched his departing figure in thought, then turned his gaze to the swirling snow outside the cave and pondered, How did Li Xizhi end up in Dragon Clan territory? There’s something strange about Xizhi’s situation… I should find a chance to seek him out.

The information he received from this man was completely different from what he’d heard from the Ning Family. Sensing something amiss, he realized the child was likely scheming in secret. Not wanting to disrupt any plans, he resolved to speak with Li Xizhi personally.

Just as he was about to close his eyes and cultivate, someone nearby had been quietly watching for some time. Dressed in flowing white robes, a middle-aged man with a sword at his waist strode over quickly and smiled, “Xuanfeng! Senior is here!”

Li Xuanfeng looked closely, it was Xiao Yongling of the Xiao Family, an old friend of Li Tongya. Dressed in white, Li Xuanfeng immediately rose and said softly, “It has been a long time since I last saw you, senior.”

Xiao Yongling’s expression turned a little somber. He studied Li Xuanfeng for a moment and said softly, “Since that day at the Green Pine Grotto Heaven, I haven’t seen you again. Your killing aura has grown much heavier, Xuanfeng.”

He sat down nearby, accompanied by a young woman in violet robes who smiled sweetly and said gently, “Kong Tingyun of Profound Peak Gate. Greetings, Senior.”

Li Xuanfeng naturally knew of the Profound Peak Gate’s ties with his family and had heard the name before. He nodded slightly, and the three of them sat on the snowy peak. Kong Tingyun chuckled and said, “This Beihuan Sect is quite amusing. With all these talents of the Immortal Dao gathered from around the world, they didn’t even bother to set out tables or chairs. But they only opened this little cave and had everyone sit on the ground.”

Xiao Yongling, who seemed to have been here for a while, stroked his beard and said, “Beihuan Sect is of a very old Dao lineage. They still keep many of the old customs. They rarely leave the mountains, and they have only a few dozen disciples.”

He glanced slightly toward the figure standing on the peak and whispered, “That one is a descendant of a Golden Core Realm cultivator, from the Xie Family of the Northern Sea. Not sure which Dao lineage he cultivates but it’s rare to meet a True Monarch’s bloodline.”

Out of courtesy, Li Xuanfeng didn’t stare and saw nothing unusual about the man. Kong Tingyun, however, said with some intrigue, “I’ve heard that the Xie Family are adept in spells, they can manipulate spiritual energy, ride mist and cloud, and are masters of technique. They can even craft talismanic water to heal wounds.”

The phrase ‘talismanic water’ seemed to stir some memory in Li Xuanfeng, and he paused slightly. As they chatted on the peak, he looked north and asked softly, “Among all the immortal families with True Monarchs, aside from the Wang and Xie Families, how many others remain?”

Xiao Yongling paused, then replied, “In the ancient times, there were many. But now, those clearly still in existence are likely no more than five. The Wang and Xie Families are the most well-known.”

He hesitated briefly and then added in a low voice, “Years ago… There were also the Li and Cui Family of Longdi, the Ning State’s Li family of Daoist Master Donghua, and the Jing, Ji, Yang Family of Jiangnan. Some have declined, some were destroyed. Most have fallen silent.

“The rest, such as the Mount Tan Li Family of Wu State, the Chen Family of Jiangnan, my own Xiao Family, and the Shen Family of Jiangbei are a tier below. Known, but not prominent.”

Listening at the side, Kong Tingyun noticed Xiao Yongling pause and gently added, “If our guess is right, your esteemed family should be a remnant of a northern lineage. Formerly nobility of Wei State, and further back, likely descended from the Li Family of Longdi.”

Their reasoning was quite thorough, but Li Xuanfeng couldn’t be sure. Others might not know, but his family were originally farmers. His ancestor, Li Mutian and all who came before were mere mortals, wanderers who had drifted here.

When the rise of Lijing began, several brothers all possessed spiritual orifices, but these were granted through talismans. The outstanding talents of the later generations were likewise due to the presence of talismanic seeds and the support of immortal arts. Without these, their cultivation would have been as slow as that of ordinary people. They were by no means descendants of immortal families.

Although Yuan Su calculated that his bloodline was from Wei State, Li Xuanfeng felt that, at best, it might be from a collateral branch of a collateral branch. The Wei State Li Family had ruled for a thousand years, expanding from a few counties to dominate the north. No one could say how many descendants they’d produced.

Only Li Zhouwei stirred a hint of suspicion in Li Xuanfeng’s mind, something about him felt strange, If that’s truly the case, why is there not a single word of it? How could the line fall to generations of mere mortals…

He dared not think further. These thoughts filled his mind in just a couple of seconds. He couldn’t bring himself to acknowledge it, and simply muttered, “Just rumors and hearsay. If our family were truly descendants of Wei State, how could we have fallen to such a state?”

Kong Tingyun misunderstood his meaning. She exchanged a glance with Xiao Yongling, they both seemed to understand something deeper, she said, “Though so many years have passed, plenty of old enemies remain. The name of the Wei State Li Family may be glorious, but it brings plenty of trouble too.”

That said, Kong Tingyun couldn’t help but feel some envy. As long as the Li Family grew strong enough, the legacy of the Wei State Li Family would still be there, possibly traceable to ancient times. It wasn’t just a name, it was something that flowed in the blood.

Her own Kong family had produced only one Daoist Master and that was Daoist Master Changxi. Further up the lineage were merely rogue cultivators of the Yue State. They were ancestors who had once been mere county magistrates under the shadow of the powerful Yuan Family…

Xiao Yongling watched the two as their expressions shifted, forming a few guesses. He gently advised, “Rise and fall are part of the world, they are often unexpected. Don’t overthink it. Back then, everyone thought the Yuan Family was untouchable… who would’ve imagined today? Or that from a tiny village, a Li family would emerge with four generations and eight Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators? Even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators can’t fully divine such a thing!”

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly, and Kong Tingyun responded with a bright smile, secretly amused, Didn’t your Man on Creek already divine that? Leaving everyone stunned.

The three soon fell into silence, each adjusting their breath in quiet meditation.

Time passed swiftly as the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators cultivated beneath alternating light and shadow. Nearly half a month passed, and still there was no sign of Yuan Su. The three days he had promised stretched longer and longer.

Not until the twenty-third day did multicolored lights finally appear again, streaked with the blackness of the great void. From the sky descended an old man carrying a fishing rod on his shoulder. Beside him stood a middle-aged man with a stern demeanor and a thumb-sized glowing jade embedded in his chest.

“Greetings to the two Daoist Masters!”

Li Xuanfeng had met Xiao Chuting before. Back then, he was just a lowly Qi Cultivation Realm disciple, while Xiao Chuting had likely pretended to be Foundation Establishment Realm, collecting offerings atop the peak. His appearance hadn’t changed much, though now he seemed even more transcendent.

As for the other man, Li Xuanfeng could only guess, but he was likely the famed Daoist Master Changxi. His appearance was somewhat different than expected. Xiao Yongling and Kong Tingyun both took their leave and flew off into the clouds.

Li Xuanfeng gave a respectful salute. Both Xiao Chuting and Daoist Master Changxi seemed rather cordial. Li Xuanfeng thought Xiao Chuting hadn’t changed much from before but Xiao Chuting looked at him with completely different eyes. The once-innocent boy Li Xuanfeng, had grown into a hardened and unyielding veteran.

Xiao Chuting nodded and said in his hoarse voice, “Xuanfeng, wait here a moment.”

The four vanished swiftly. Li Xuanfeng turned to look, snowflakes drifted across the peak and only Xie Zhanchang remained. His hands were forming seals and he was seated cross-legged in meditation. In one shadowy corner, a dark figure sat quietly in the snow.

Li Xuanfeng looked closer. The man’s face was pale and grim, his robes a mix of gold and black. It was an all-too-familiar attire.

Someone from the Golden Tang Gate…, thought Li Xuanfeng.

This man was indeed from Golden Tang Gate. Li Xuanfeng didn’t recognize him by face, but the robes were unmistakable. After all, he had once slain the Golden Tang Gate’s young master ruthlessly, with blade after blade. There was no way he’d mistake their emblem.

Seeing this scene, realization struck him instantly, So the Situ Family’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, who’d been hiding for so long was still caught by Yuan Su in the end.

He sat cross-legged for another three days. At last, Yuan Su emerged from the void, his face slightly pale, halting midair. One of his hand tucked behind his back, the other holding a severed arm.

Yuan Su’s aura fluctuated, and the sound of bubbling spring water resonated clearly. His brows were tightly furrowed and his expression was faintly grim. The peak was almost deserted. He took Li Xuanfeng up into the clouds again and continued northward.

After ten or so seconds of silence, Yuan Su finally spoke in a cold tone, “That old bastard could’ve hidden wherever he wanted… but to show up in the Northern Sea? I’ll let him off with just one arm as a lesson.”

Hearing this, Li Xuanfeng understood why the Situ Family’s Purple Mansion Realm had gone missing all these years. They were waiting for Yuan Su’s lifespan to run out, trying to drag him down with them.

Yuan Su’s strength is indeed impressive. The Situ Family had no choice but to run for their lives, thought Li Xuanfeng.

The severed arm was sealed with mana, yet it still trembled faintly. Yuan Su raised it and said in a low voice, “Situ Huo, listen well. If you’ve got the guts, stay in the Southern Sea forever. Pu Yu and Yuming are looking for you too. Don’t get careless and come crawling back.”

After saying this, he broke off one of the fingers and tossed it into the sea, letting it find Situ Huo on its own. Only then did he stow away the arm. The sky above had already filled with starlight.

Without another word, he continued flying upward with Li Xuanfeng. The north wind grew increasingly fierce. It was strong enough to knock ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators out of the sky. The mountains below, streaked with black and white, looked solemn and austere.

They finally reached the highest ice plain. At its center was a small lake. Several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators stood silently on the clouds. Upon the icy platform in the lake sat a lone figure in quiet meditation, a wooden sword hanging at the figure’s waist.

Standing on the cloud, Li Xuanfeng felt the fierce, biting wind halted just beyond the cloud barrier. After a few seconds, he suddenly heard a faint rustling. A soft, fragmentary clattering sound.

Because Yuan Su’s cloud aura blocked his spiritual sense, he couldn’t probe outward. He could only look around and noticed that amidst the falling snow were countless tiny white fragments. Each one striking the ground with a faint cracking sound.

Yuan Su, now much calmer, reached out his hand and caught a handful of snowflakes. With a gentle shake, he revealed specks of fine, white jade dust among them.

“It’s begun.”

Li Xuanfeng understood immediately. Sure enough, atop the platform, Shangyuan opened his eyes, scanned the surroundings one by one, and spoke, “I am Shangyuan. Today I attempt to break through to the Golden Core Realm. In accordance with the pact among the immortal cultivators of the Four Nations and Seas, I’ve invited you all to witness. Observe closely, there may be benefits to gain.”

He spoke calmly. In contrast to the trembling silence when Duanmu Kui spoke, or the mockery when facing Chi Wei, the assembled cultivators all nodded in return. Even those Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who disliked his temperament now reluctantly returned the greeting.

Mist still shrouded Shangyuan’s face, his wooden sword swaying at his side. He looked off into the distance as two faint figures slowly appeared. Smiling faintly, he clasped his hands and said, “Fellow Daoists, one moment.”

The two blurry figures had seemingly been waiting for a long time and dared not delay. One of them, with a sharp voice, quickly said, “No need for such formality! If your breakthrough succeeds, we hope you’ll remember to guide us in turn!”

Shangyuan let out a brief laugh and began to rise into the air. No spell was cast, he merely pressed his hand lightly upon the sword at his waist.

In that instant, countless spiritual swords among the gathered cultivators began to tremble violently. Some slipped from their owners’ control, ringing out in unison with the urge to draw themselves. It was an awe-inspiring sight.

All the cultivators in the sky had been watching his every move. Almost simultaneously, the majority of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators stepped back cautiously and assumed defensive postures. Only a few, Yuan Su among them, stood unmoved.

Li Xuanfeng looked up and saw a mocking smile on Yuan Su’s face, as if this display was very much to his taste. He stood with arms crossed, perfectly relaxed.

Under the veil of mist, a trace of amusement played across Shangyuan’s face. He released his grip on the sword, and the others found themselves left standing awkwardly midair. They were embarrassed in front of their juniors. Yet none dared to speak. At most, their faces darkened slightly, though most didn’t even dare show that much.

Shangyuan paid them no mind. He gently exhaled a breath of white mist.

The mist rose and twisted in the air, forming strange and marvelous visions. White-robed men, jade cliffs, cascading silks like waterfalls and even a great white jade disk rose into the sky.

Billows of white mist surged and spread. Within the clouds, endless scenes manifested. Beneath the glow of the jade disk, zithers and flutes played, white-robed men wielded spears and swords in dance, strange beasts ran across crescent moons and waterfall-like silk unfurled in the sky, flowing all the way down into the lake.

Amidst the many celestial visions, steps of white jade appeared beneath Daoist Master Shangyuan’s feet. Clad in his immortal blade, he ascended them with ease and composure.

With each step, surging waves of white mist erupted. The wooden sword at his waist began to glow with its grain turning to luminous jade. Shangyuan said softly, “The Jadeborn One.”

As the words left his lips, a radiant, elegant white feathered robe formed over him. Long strands of mist trailed from his sleeves like silk. Normally dressed simply, Shangyuan now looked like a being from the heavens.

Li Xuanfeng found it oddly familiar. He had read the Aged Courtly Path Scripture, and this feathered robe matched the descriptions there. Although it was far more mystical than he’d ever imagined. He thought to himself, This must be the Jade Court General form… perhaps a higher version of the immortal text or the ancient name of the Immortal Foundation…
