# Chapter 794: Great Divine Ability

The Peacock Sea.

The waters of the Peacock Sea were unique, a deep brown tinged with green luminescence. Many stretches of the surface were an iridescent mix of coppery-purple and verdant-violet, glittering with ten thousand colors, dazzling to behold.

Upon this jewel-like, shimmering sea, a cultivator in white-gold Daoist robes pierced through the Great Void and materialized.

Li Ximing estimated he had arrived at the Peacock Sea and began to walk across its surface, a sigh of emotion rising in his heart:

'The Sea's Cape is truly distant...'

Li Ximing had traversed the Great Void to get here. His original plan had been to ride the winds all the way from the mortal world, collecting spiritual materials along the route. Who would have thought that even flying for days at his Purple Mansion Realm speed, he hadn't even managed to fly out of the Sea's Cape region? Beyond the waters controlled by Qingxu Temple, there was nothing but an endless, mundane sea, utterly cut off from spiritual qi.

Such places had no connection to the Great Void; within that higher dimension, they were but a single, almost nonexistent point, bypassed in a flash. For an ordinary cultivator, flying that distance would take months, if not years. No wonder no one was willing to travel to the Sea's Cape.

He had merely found a spot with a bare minimum of spiritual qi, entered the Great Void, and this time, he reached the Peacock Sea almost instantly. Gazing back at the boundless ocean behind him, he couldn't help but marvel:

"What a desolate and impoverished place. If a cultivator ever managed to fight their way out from a land like that, they would be a truly world-shaking talent."

He flew along the Peacock Sea for a while. The spiritual qi finally grew dense. Several of the barren islands he passed possessed spiritual qi on par with Qingxu Temple. Flying and stopping intermittently, he soon spotted several large peacocks with vibrant, colorful wings soaring through the air, bringing with them a rolling wave of heat.

The largest of these peacocks was the size of a courtyard, its back broad enough to carry a building. Even the smallest was powerfully built, larger than a bedframe, its feathers a riotous blaze of purple, red, and green. Flames churned around it—a truly majestic sight.

Li Ximing glanced over and thought he saw human figures on the peacocks' backs. He immediately dismissed the idea of attacking and traversed the Great Void again, materializing over a massive island bustling with a noisy, lively crowd below.

This place was nothing like the Sea's Cape; concealing his tracks was necessary. Li Ximing casually altered his face and retracted the aura of Profound Light from his robes, erasing every trace of his Bright Yang divine ability.

He grasped his hand, and the jade-bead-like Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger materialized. Pinching it in his fingers, he used the spiritual tool's authority to transform his entire aura into that of the Still Earth Dao lineage, suppressing his cultivation to the late Foundation Establishment Realm.

Taking a step forward, he transformed into a middle-aged cultivator wearing brown robes.

Li Ximing was utterly clueless regarding the Dao of Transformations. This series of changes couldn't fool a Purple Mansion cultivator, nor even a Foundation Establishment cultivator who specialized in such arts. Unfortunately for them, the island was filled with nothing but Qi Refining and Embryonic Breathing cultivators, all of whom prostrated themselves the moment they saw him.

The one leading them was the island master. He was similarly dirt-poor, but at least slightly better off than Qingxu Temple; the man wore a Qi Refining-level magical sword at his waist. He kowtowed and said:

"I do not know where the Master comes from? My land is humble and may stain your noble feet..."

Although the archaic customs here weren't as pronounced as at the Sea's Cape, they still retained the "Master" form of address. Li Ximing asked:

"What place is this, and whose domain are these seas?"

The island master bowed. "Reporting to Master, this is Gaoxuan Island. The Peacock Sea is the territory of the Grand Dao of Tai-Tao and the Nine Mounds. About two thousand li east of here, there is a Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain, where the Daoist Masters reside."

Inquiring here at the Peacock Sea was far more convenient. This single sentence was infinitely more useful than the vague information Xia Shouyu had provided. Li Ximing lowered his voice:

"I have heard there is a great divine ability user in the Peacock Sea. Might I ask which Daoist Master cultivates here?"

The man hurriedly bowed again. "Reporting to Master, on the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain resides Daoist Master Yuandao, a possessor of great divine abilities. The entire Peacock Sea venerates him alone. He is kind and charitable. Not only do people from all the nearby sea regions come to seek his teachings, but even Daoist Masters from the unreachable Jiangnan come to pay their respects..."

'Daoist Master Yuandao...'

Li Ximing had never heard the name. He frowned, forced to ask, "Do you know what lineage the Grand Dao of Tai-Tao and the Nine Mounds is... What is the surname of their direct line?"

The man was only at the Qi Refining level; how could he possibly know anything about lineages? Terrified of offending the powerful cultivator, he broke into a cold sweat, racking his brain.

"This lowly one is in a remote place and knows nothing of lineages... or direct lines... I have never had the opportunity to ask..."

Just as sweat poured down his face, his eyes suddenly lit up. "However... when this lowly one was young, I followed my father once to the Peacock Sea Market. The lord administrator of that market had come down from the mountain. All the cultivators called him... Lord Dantai..."

'Dantai?!'

Enlightenment struck Li Ximing. He thought inwardly:

"Someone from the Dantai family! Dantai Jin of the Azure Pond Sect is from that family... This Daoist Master Yuandao must be Si Boxiu's friend!"

"Well, well. So the Dantai family is in the Peacock Sea... and they command such prestige! Daoist Master Yuanxiu truly found a powerful backer for his descendants..."

With this understanding, he felt an unexpected surge of delight. He raised an eyebrow. "I see... Are all the peacocks in this sea from the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain? Who normally governs the demons here?"

The man didn't know why the topic had suddenly shifted to demons, but he replied, "You may not know, sir, but the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain is located in the southwestern part of the Peacock Sea, which is also where the largest clusters of islands and landmasses are. The peacock lords are all in the northeast... stretching continuously northward, there is a Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendor. It is where the peacock lords cultivate. They all read sutras and strike wooden fish. They are said to have blessed lands within their bellies and have saved many people."

This piqued Li Ximing's interest. He asked, "The Peacock Sea once had a Demon King, and now its descendants are studying Buddhist cultivation? For the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain to tolerate them, they must have someone backing them."

The island master naturally didn't know the details. "They are indeed the descendants of that great one. I've heard that these lords, with their myriad colors, are connected to many Dao lineages within the sea. They often share life and death with those great figures..."

Li Ximing understood. The Merciful Ones of the mainland frequently came here looking for mounts. He mused internally:

'If I'm going to hunt demons, hunting these sutra-chanting peacocks would be the most satisfying. Unfortunately, my condition is not optimal, and I don't know who stands behind them, so it's not wise to make a move. Still, I can memorize the location...'

"In the future, if I need sacrifices for a ritual or ingredients for alchemy, I can swing by this flock of peacocks and 'reap an autumn harvest.' After all, demons without backing are hard to find, but the peacocks in this temple are both fat and plentiful."

Thus, he asked, "Do you know of any area that is more chaotic, where demons run rampant?"

The man replied, "Further south, there is the East A-Wang Sea. The dragon-kin have withdrawn and no longer govern those waters, so it's in total chaos... Everyone is planning to go there to make a fortune."

Li Ximing nodded. He casually tossed the man two medicinal pills and traversed space. Being so close to the Sea's Cape, the Great Void was extremely efficient. He quickly arrived at this East A-Wang Sea. Peering through the Great Void for a moment, he tracked the spiritual qi fluctuations and broke through. Sure enough, he saw battles raging everywhere in utter chaos.

Not far away, a great black-feathered bird with crimson eyes was flying, wreathed in roaring flames. Two groups of people were scattering in panic. The flame-spewing bird blotted out the sun, its fire scorching the surroundings white as it stretched its neck, swallowing cultivators one by one, leisurely pursuing the fleeing crowd.

"Yo! Better to arrive at the right time... than to arrive early."

Just as the demon was reveling in its power, a cultivator in white-gold robes appeared from thin air beside it. He reached out one hand and seized the majestic demon by the neck, lifting it casually. In an instant, all the flames vanished. The bird, struck by the divine ability, was forced back to its original form, shrinking to the size of a common wild goose. Its legs stuck out rigidly, unable to move a feather.

The sea was instantly plunged into silence, broken only by the hysterical, heart-wrenching shriek of a lesser demon below:

"The Great Demon King of the Primal-Parting Treasured Pagoda who Burns the Heavens has been captured!"

Li Ximing frowned at the name, suspicious. He held the vicious demon like a dead bird, grabbing its tail and holding it upside down. He slapped its beak, forcing the dead-seeming bird to open its mouth wide, and gave it a few shakes, emptying everything from its stomach.

He glanced at the pile. Not a single item was noteworthy. Realizing the demon was worthless, he frowned.

"What corner of the wilderness did this demon crawl out of? Utterly ignorant. With such shallow cultivation, how dare it take such a magnificent title. Anyone who didn't know better would think a Demon King was here..."

He untied his belt, looped it around the bird's neck, tied it off, and fastened it to his robe, looking just like a Daoist descending a mountain after buying a chicken from a farmer. He then turned and left.

He left behind a crowd of cultivators and lesser demons, all standing frozen on the spot, staring dumbly at each other. Faintly, they heard cries that "The Great Demon King... has fallen!" One cultivator raised his head, his face a mask of indelible shock and the profound relief of having survived. He whispered, "A great divine ability user... This is nothing less than a great divine ability!"

A cultivator next to him, wearing similar attire, let out a heavy breath and replied, "Let's go... Brother Li. This place is not safe. Elder Shihai is already on his way. We must rendezvous quickly."

...

Moongaze Lake.

The rainy season had passed. Without the bother of the rain, the stone steps of Mount Qingdu appeared even cleaner. The moonlight swept across the courtyard, year after year, just as it always had.

The small courtyard was quiet. An old man stood with his hands clasped behind his back, pacing the yard. Li Shuya, dressed in brown, stood to the side holding a jade tray, waiting. As the bell tolled the midnight hour, Li Shuya took a step forward and said softly:

"Old Master... it is midnight."

In the jade cup on the tray, a clear tea had already been poured. This was brewed from the treasure medicine "Cleansing Cloud Floating Leaf," an item Li Ximing himself had ordered years ago to help Li Xuanxuan recuperate, to be consumed along with his medicinal pills.

Li Xuanxuan understood this was Li Shuya's duty and didn't make it difficult for him. He drank it quickly, finally unable to hold back his question:

"Xixuan has been locked in the ancestral hall. How... how is he now?"

Li Xixuan had been confined to Mount Qingdu ever since his argument with Li Xuanxuan and had not yet been released. Li Shuya, however, misunderstood the question and replied respectfully:

"The entire island and the shore are using this as a cautionary tale. Progress on the western bank has also sped up considerably..."

Li Xuanxuan fell silent for a moment, then asked:

"Minggong is in seclusion... and Xixuan is confined to the courtyard by me. The Yuanwan branch must be in an uproar. Has no one come to plead for him recently? Are there any other movements?"

Li Shuya shook his head, hesitating. "This junior does not know... The Yuanwan branch has not formally split the family. Only one branch with a few Spirit Aperture members split off. Later, it was only after Lady Minggong reached Spirit Aperture that Lord Xixuan's side was established as its own branch. Right now, the five or six households are extremely anxious. Some have even tried to persuade this lowly one, hoping I can convince the Old Master to calm his anger..."

Li Xuanxuan asked again, "What is the island saying about this matter?"

Li Shuya paused, then said haltingly, "All the clan members are very... emotional..."

"Emotional?"

Li Xuanxuan knew exactly what they were feeling. He sighed, his voice weary. "They are all wringing their hands in sympathy for him, aren't they... Xixuan championed the greater good, fighting to secure them shelter... going so far as to defy me... How could I, his grandfather, not see what these children are thinking? Let him be confined for now. We will see how many people jump out later."

He paced the courtyard another round, then looked up. "It's getting late. You should rest. I am going to see the clan head."

Li Shuya was, after all, a mortal. Worrying day and night alongside Li Xuanxuan during this period had taken its toll. The old man dismissed him to rest and flew up on the wind alone, landing on the continent shore shortly after.

He saw a scene of bright lights and revelry. Several brightly lit red pleasure barges, burning candles and lamps, drifted lazily across the lake's surface. Waves of fragrant perfume and song drifted from the barges, floating over the water.

These were clearly not transport vessels, but a new form of entertainment and pleasure. The trend had begun in Lijing Prefecture, confined only to the rivers. Later, as the Li family cultivators grew in number, the restrictions on luxury and pleasure-seeking had loosened somewhat. They all moved out onto the lake, making the scene even livelier.

The pleasure barges were filled with high officials and nobles. The direct descendants of the Li family naturally did not frequent them; they were mostly places of enjoyment for those with other surnames or from minor clans. Therefore, Li Xuanxuan did not find the scene decadent; rather, he found the bustling atmosphere relaxing.

'One, it diverts the idle thoughts of these cultivators. Two, it keeps the lake from looking dead and dreary... A bit more open celebration means a bit less hidden debauchery...'

After Li Ximing reached the Purple Mansion Realm, the interactions between the island and the shore had grown closer. Many of these things seemed to have sprouted from the cracks in the rules, but in truth, they had been permitted successively by both Li Zhouwei and Li Jiangqian. The old man looked around, shaking his head and sighing to himself:

'It is very prosperous... No wonder those on the island are envious.'

But just as the old man shifted his gaze back toward the island, he spotted a youth in red robes secretly landing, seeming to have just returned from outside the island. He cleared his throat and flew over in pursuit, calling out:

"Li Zhouming!"

Li Zhouming jumped in fright. Seeing who it was, his first instinct was to run. He took one step back before realizing it was too late. He put on an obsequious smile.

"So it is the Old Master... I haven't had the chance to visit you these past few days..."

Li Xuanxuan sized the boy up. "Where did you go?"

Li Zhouming gave an awkward smile. "I met a lovely girl on the shore. She just reached the second layer of Embryonic Breathing. I saw her family was struggling and couldn't afford any Dharma Artifacts, so I had a hairpin made... Yup... I just delivered it tonight."

Although Li Zhouming was a wastrel, his one redeeming quality was that he never lied to Li Xuanxuan; otherwise, the old man wouldn't have such a crystal-clear understanding of his debauchery. Li Xuanxuan just frowned.

"Which family's girl is it this time... You fall in love every three days and replace her every six months. Don't you dare do anything disgraceful!"

Li Zhouming bowed with his hands clasped. "Old Ancestor... this junior is just appreciating her, I haven't tried any dirty tricks... The family rules are so strict, if I even had such a thought, they'd surely force her on me. Then I'd never be able to look at beautiful women again..."

Li Xuanxuan was often helpless against him. He shook his head and sighed. "Behaving like this... it is not good for the girl's reputation... You should interact less..."

Li Zhouming quickly said, "Rest assured, I have my ways of handling Mount Qingdu... It will never come to that, otherwise how would I have muddled along until today? This is my only hobby. If you cut this path off, you'll be taking my life..."

"Scram, scram!"

Li Xuanxuan could only let him go. He walked quickly toward the main hall. Only after the old man was gone did Li Zhouming straighten up. His two attendants looked at him as the wastrel muttered:

"Those few families do nothing but wail and mourn all day, acting like a little confinement is a death sentence! One wants to go farm, the other wants to go pole a boat. I heard it all from little sister Xinghan! They've secretly taken who-knows-how-much wealth from Aunt Minggong... I bet they have so much money they don't know how to spend it!"

"Aunt is kind-hearted and afraid they'll be punished, so she keeps quiet about it, and now they've bothered the Old Master himself! Let's go, let's go..."

The two couldn't help but look up. "Your Highness..."

Li Zhouming's face turned serious. He flicked his sleeve, snapping his fan open with a *shua*, and declared:

"Didn't those families spend all day staring at me just to report me to Mount Qingdu? Damn it, they can't even figure out how to sneak around and enjoy themselves properly, they just spend all their time being jealous of me. Today, we're going to their courtyards, and we're going to pick out the laziest crybaby, the foulest bird in the nest, the whiniest dog looking for fun... and curse them out before we leave..."

"At the very least, we'll vent some anger and piss them off. Let's see how sincerely they can keep crying then!"

Brimming with enthusiasm, he stalked off, damning his two attendants, who were sweating in terror. They scrambled after him, trying and failing to dissuade him, whining miserably:

"Little master! You can't just go cursing people... everyone on the island is watching... Aiyo..."
