# Chapter 816: The Fall of Mount Yan Pass

Mount Yan Pass.

Dense demonic qi surged across the ruins. The ground was dim and soaked in blood. The once radiant formation was now in tatters, with only faint glimmers of formation lines flickering intermittently on exposed stones.

The reek of blood filled the air, demonic smoke soared into the sky, and not a trace of immortal light could be seen. Cries of battle and the clash of dharma artifacts echoed across the land. Thick black clouds spread for nearly fifty kilometers as it rushed southward.

Zhao Tinggui sped through the air atop a small golden cloud, a white jade lantern in his hands radiating multicolored light. Each time the golden cloud tried to accelerate, streaks of violet light shot out from the layers of demonic clouds. The white jade lantern in his hand would immediately emit colorful rays to block them, leaving behind crackling and shattering sounds.

Zhao Tinggui’s dharma artifact was indeed impressive to shield him from the violet rays. But even as those rays were shattered, a wave of white radiance would fall on him. Just as the golden light beneath his feet would start to rise, it would be dimmed again by the white glow.

Boom!

The streaks of violet light seemed never ending, leaving Zhao Tinggui’s face pale and ashen. His refined junior martial brother, dressed in brocade robes, remained calm and composed even in danger as he said, “Senior brother... this Murong Gong is overwhelmingly powerful... I fear we are no match for him!”

Zhao Tinggui’s expression was grim, and his heart had long since turned cold. His usually polished and smiling face was now slightly pale, with traces of blood at the corners of his lips.

“Tang Shedu... Tang Shedu...”

Zhao Tinggui knew Tu Longjian had broken through and expected difficult times ahead for him, but he truly hadn’t imagined that Tang Shedu would defect from the Azure Pond Sect overnight and join the enemy, ruining the entire strategic situation.

The defection had caused the front lines to collapse like a landslide. Li Xuanfeng was exceptionally strong, so he might yet escape with his life, but the rest likely had no more than one in ten chance of survival. Zhao Tinggui’s heart turned to ice.

Yu Su is useless too... he thought.

Yu Su’s forces had been stationed close to Mount Yan Pass, yet he had only advanced a few hundred kilometers and was already calling for reinforcements. At the time, Zhao Tinggui hadn’t known of Tang Shedu’s betrayal, so he had felt uneasy and sent a few men over. In the end, none returned.

He had been burning with anxiety as he waited within the pass. But when he saw five spiritual winds surging into the sky and getting torn apart by demonic hands, Zhao Tinggui could only mutter in a daze, “Yu Su is most likely dead...”

The Yu Family’s Long Wind Cage was well known for having five wind fiends held within it. Zhao Tinggui had personally seen it years ago. But judging from the current state of things, even the Long Wind Cage had been dismantled. How could Yu Su still be alive?

Then, the Murong Family’s Murong Gong suddenly led a charge straight through the pass. Since Mount Yan Pass had been emptied, Zhao Tinggui had only five Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators at his side. What could they possibly use to stop the enemy? What could they even use to defend?

He had no idea what agreements the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had made, but devil cultivators had even stirred up chaos inside Mount Yan Pass. The entire defense line had collapsed in less than fifteen minutes. Zhao Tinggui hadn’t even had time to gather all his junior brothers before being engulfed in the billowing demonic smoke.

Zhao Tinggui’s strength was above average, but he came from humble origins. Though the Ning Family had temporarily granted him a few dharma artifacts, his techniques and spell arts couldn’t compare to those of the Murong Family’s direct descendents. After holding on for a few dozen exchanges, he could no longer withstand the onslaught and was forced to retreat.

If not for his few dharma artifacts, Zhao Tinggui would have long since fallen to the devil cultivators. He and his junior brother Lin Wuning had fled all the way here, while Murong Gong followed at a steady pace, seemingly unsatisfied with his spoils and hoping to lure out more prey.

Zhao Tinggui's heart was frozen with dread as his junior brother Lin Wuning murmured again, “Senior brother... this demonic cultivator is getting faster... he’s likely nearing the riverbank. Since he sees no more prey surfacing, he’s getting ready to close the net!”

Of course he understood Lin Wuning. Murong Gong had just shattered the great formation at Mount Yan Pass with his own strength. Though he had used a dharma artifact, the power it lent him was very real. The two of them likely had no way to escape.

Boom!

Another bright purple ray streaked toward them. The white jade lantern in Zhao Tinggui’s hand flared with dense, hair-thin streaks of multicolored light. Zhao Tinggui staggered from the impact, the wind beneath his feet nearly dissipating.

Murong Gong had cultivated some unknown art, and was perhaps even wielding a Mansion Water dharma artifact. Every time his spell struck, a dispersing force would follow, preventing the dharma artifact beneath Zhao Tinggui’s feet from ever fully activating.

After suffering two more strikes, Zhao Tinggui suddenly fell silent. He stared deeply into the fog of demonic mist ahead and spoke quietly, “Wuning, we’ve come this far, and it’s only Murong Gong chasing us. I’ll use the White Blossom Lamp to block this demon for you. Take the Fortune-Rising Cloud and flee south on your own.”

Lin Wuning was stunned. Countless feelings churned in his heart, and though he wanted to protest, the words stayed lodged in his chest. Lin Wuning hadn’t thought much of his senior brother earlier. Zhao Tinggui came from poverty, and though it was a miracle he’d reached his current status, he was always gathering allies and currying favor. Lin Wuning always thought him overly concerned with appearances and reputation. He was altogether too calculating.

As the son of a peak master, Lin Wuning carried a natural pride in his bearing. He had always found Zhao Tinggui’s demeanor petty and unbecoming of greatness, and had looked down on him.
𝘧𝓇𝑒𝑒𝑤ℯ𝑏𝓃𝘰𝑣ℯ𝘭.𝘤ℴ𝘮

But over time, he came to realize that Zhao Tinggui, though constantly scheming and striving, genuinely cared for the disciples of his own peak. So over time, Lin Wuning gradually let go of his resentment.

He used to scorn how Zhao Tinggui scurried about for petty gains, seemingly without dignity. But now, when he heard these words, his face flushed red and he said weakly, “Senior brother, your future still holds promise... let me... stay behind... and cover you instead.”

“Nonsense!” Zhao Tinggui didn’t have the energy to manage his tone. He scanned the mist for a path to escape, while Lin Wuning shrank back hesitantly. Zhao Tinggui murmured, “I gave my word to Li Xijun... promised Li Qinghong... and in the end, Mount Yan Pass fell within fifteen minutes. I couldn’t even find my own brothers, let alone Li Yuexiang...”

Lin Wuning could only reply, “How can this be your fault, senior brother?! I know Li Yuexiang is Li Xizhi’s sister, and Li Xuanfeng is terrifying, Li Qinghong is strong too... but how many of them will even make it back? There’s no need to...”

Zhao Tinggui shook his head and replied quietly, “I shouldn’t have sent anyone out... Mount Yan Pass fell in fifteen minutes, and the majority of the blame is mine. Every major clan north of the Yue River had cultivators within the pass. If I survive alone, I’ll be condemned by all and hated by everyone!

Zhao Tinggui said quietly, “What face do I have left to return across the river?”

Seeing his junior brother still bewildered, he had to explain, “I’ve long known this day would come. I knew my end would not be good ever since the sect sent me with no backing or support to rally cultivators. They even stripped me of every Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator under my command.”

Lin Wuning looked at him, somewhat dazed, as Zhao Tinggui simply said, “In the past, the Chi Family didn’t care about anyone’s opinion, but now they’ve grown weak and can no longer act so domineering. The pass falling in fifteen minutes; someone will have to take the blame for such a crushing defeat. From top to bottom, first to last.”

Lin Wuning seemed to slowly understand. Zhao Tinggui placed the golden cloud beneath his feet and channeled all his mana into the white jade-like lamp.

He looked at his junior brother twice and finally said, “You often said I was overly scheming and ambitious. I know it’s hard for you to understand. But before I came up the mountain, I was just a farmer’s son carrying nothing but a sickle. If I didn’t fight for every inch, I wouldn’t have survived.

“Later I realized that if I didn’t scramble, I’d die. But if I scrambled too hard, I’d still die... But I realized that too late. All the cultivators thought I had the Ning Family backing me, but they were wrong. I had nothing behind me. My fate was sealed long ago. It was only a matter of time before I was sacrificed.”

He poured his mana into the cloud and sent Lin Wuning southward, letting out a heavy yet gentle sigh as he muttered, “I’ve always known you looked down on me, but that won’t stop me from saving you. Master brought me up the mountain and taught me to cherish my junior brothers, and I’ve never forgotten that.”

Radiant white light burst from his body as the dharma artifact in his hand shone brilliantly, blocking the sweeping violet light. Blood streamed from all seven orifices as he turned to face his opponent. The openly mocking look on Murong Gong’s face gave way to seriousness.

Lin Wuning bowed his head and charged out of the dark clouds. The flying cloud beneath his feet moved faster and faster, plunging him deep into the heavy mist. Below him was a sea of demonic haze and strewn corpses. After flying for several kilometers, the demonic aura finally began to fade.

He flew blindly through the wind until he saw the roaring Great River. It was only after crossing it and heading further south that the terror in his heart gradually subsided. His senior brother’s words echoed within him for a long while. He was grateful, but also overwhelmed and at a loss.

Further south is Moongaze Lake...

After a brief moment of hesitation, Lin Wuning didn’t land or issue any warnings, fearing to waste precious time. He instead veered toward Mount Bianyan, and calculated silently. If he could bring reinforcements back in time, perhaps he could still save Zhao Tinggui.

Mount Qingdu.

The coldest days had passed and the heavy snow began to ease. Though the lake’s ice had yet to thaw, it had grown much thinner. Li Xuanxuan finished drawing a talisman, folded his sleeves, and strolled through the mountain.

He had heard that the northern situation was growing ever more chaotic, but news from their own people was growing scarcer by the day. Li Zhouwei had become busy, and Li Ximing remained in seclusion with no resolution regarding that child’s matter.

Li Xuanxuan deliberated for a moment, then decided to find Li Zhouwei, only to run into him at the temple gate. The young man wore a solemn expression and now stood a full head taller than Li Xuanxuan. Golden light flowed through his eyes, and his face was filled with thought. His black cloak was dusted with slowly melting snow.

“Huang’er... how did it go?” asked Li Xuanxuan.

Li Zhouwei bowed slightly and answered, “A devil cultivator just slipped into Mount Yue and conspired with some remnants of the Western Tan lineage to steal spirit paddies and flee. It has been dealt with. I came right away to report to you.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded. Li Zhouwei raised his hand to shut the temple doors and activated the isolation formation. Only then did worry show on his face as he spoke softly, “My trusted men stationed along the northern river have just returned. They reported rampant demonic smoke spreading southward. It’s spreading so much that even Mount Yan Pass was covered in it. It’s likely been breached by devil cultivators. The situation looks grim.”

Li Xuanxuan let out a long sigh and asked quietly, “Have there been any signs from the family’s life jades?”

Li Xuanxuan was referring to the life jades the core members of the Li Family all nurtured in the ancestral hall. If any faced life-or-death danger within five to ten years, the life jade would show signs.

Li Zhouwei shook his head and reminded him, “Jiangbei is in complete chaos. Even the Maha of the Purple Mansion Realm can’t divine anything anymore. How could mere life jades show anything? Ever since they entered Xu State, their life jades have dulled and no longer reveal their state.”

Li Xuanxuan could only nod. After hesitating a moment, he braced for the worst and asked, “If Mount Yan Pass has truly fallen, and the devil cultivators push all the way to Xu State’s border... how should we respond?”

“We can only watch how the Azure Pond Sect reacts.” Li Zhouwei had clearly considered this and said bluntly, “If their response is quick enough, we might be able to stop the devil cultivators at the Great River, rebuild a defensive line, and reorganize cultivators to resist... but if not...”

His golden eyes flicked northward as he said, one word at a time, “Then we can only defend at the northern shore of Moongaze Lake, where the Fei Family will be the frontline!”

Li Xuanxuan had long sensed it would come to this, but still sighed as he replied, “Earlier, Xijun sent so many family cultivators and spoke of sharing weal and woe... I underestimated it then. But now it seems the devil cultivators are right on our doorstep.”

Li Zhouwei had spoken of the Fei Family with such weight; it was clearly a hint. He thought to himself, If it truly comes to that, and we lose one more battle, we might lose the entire northern shore...

If the Azure Pond Sect withdraws again, their own domain would become the frontlines of a north-south struggle. What then? Win or lose, how would the million mortals living here be dealt with?

The Li Family had managed the southern shores of Moongaze Lake for years. If they lost it, where else could they go? Could they really abandon tens of thousands of acres of spirit fields and several spirit veins to flee to the Eastern Sea?

If it comes to that... How will I ever face my uncles and elders?

The elder raised his tea but didn’t drink, his mind preoccupied with the safety of the younger generation. Meanwhile, Li Zhouwei looked north and said softly, “We must prepare. I’ve already sent several loyal men to investigate further.”

The white ape had only returned to the family with Li Chengliao a few days ago, but Li Zhouwei didn’t plan to send him to scout. Though the ape was strong and could move freely, he had just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. If the white ape was caught by devil cultivators in the north, they’d lose a critical asset...

Li Zhouwei stared solemnly into the distance, golden light flickering in his eyes, and thought to himself, If things really come to this... I can’t delay any longer. I’ll take some pills and enter closed-door cultivation to break through to Foundation Establishment Realm first.

The Li Family understood well that breaking through from Qi Cultivation Realm to Foundation Establishment Realm wasn’t a race. Ideally, they would practice spells until around age forty or fifty before advancing. At the latest, they would advance no later than sixty.

Li Zhouwei cultivated the Radiant Essence Scripture, the highest fifth grade technique in the Li Family’s history. He was also extraordinary from birth. He had been inherently attuned to Bright Yang, so his cultivation speed should have been astonishing.

However, to avoid attracting undue attention with overly dazzling progress, and to ensure steady cultivation by balancing both spell arts and halberd technique, he had deliberately prioritized building a solid foundation rather than advancing too quickly. That was why his pace had slowed.

Yet even with this restraint, his cultivation still surpassed Li Ximing in his youth. He had already reached the mid-stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm before the age of twenty.

Li Zhouwei’s gaze flickered with resolution, but just then, someone approached and handed him a small letter.

He unlocked it with a unique method, glanced over it briefly, waved the messenger away, and said softly, “There’s news from Yu Fuzi of Changxiao Gate.”
