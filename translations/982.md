# Chapter 982: The Li Fire Palace

'Chi Buzi…'

How could Taixi not recognize him! This man’s movements had been bizarre for years, yet his divine abilities grew ever more exquisite, his cultivation and Dao-Profundity ever deeper... And Pristine Water was one of the preeminent Daos of the current age. How could he not be terrified!

Back then, supported by the great conflict between North and South, Taixi hadn't even dared to defy Zipei. Now, although his own divine abilities had improved, Chi Buzi was no Zipei. More importantly—in this grotto-heaven, there was no way to connect to the Buddhist Land. To fall here was to truly die!

For a moment, a chill washed over Taixi.

'He came after all… Of course… He’s scheming for a Golden Core position. How could he miss such a perfect opportunity! But… but why would he come to save Si Yuanli…'

Taixi had been confident, even daring to use Chi Buzi to mock Si Yuanli, for a very good reason. Whether it was the Si family or Si Yuanli himself, their blades were stained with the blood and resentment of the Chi clan. They had slaughtered countless members of his family…

Even if Chi Buzi was ruthless, detached, and had transcended mortal affairs, his entire clan had been exterminated. It was one thing not to seek revenge, but how could he possibly appear to save his mortal enemy?

Taixi could see it clearly: Si Yuanli himself was terrified!

"So… it is the Great Daoist Master…"

He replied dryly, only to see the man before him smile. The terrifying divine ability and dharma power of the Chou-Gui Hidden Form had already spread out instantly. This divine ability was inextricably linked to his Dao-Profundity, reaching a frightening level. Chi Buzi seemed to make no move at all, yet his hand was already rising, striking Taixi across the face!

_BOOM!_

The light of Pristine Water surged. Taixi’s entire face fractured like a shattered glazed tile, covered in countless cracks. His golden body collapsed like a mountain, tumbling heavily from the clouds and stirring up a violent storm. Only then did the man’s cold words echo through the air:

"You know who I am, yet you just stand there watching!"

Although the palm's power wasn't immense, his opponent had intentionally displayed his Dao-Profundity in the Pristine Water Dao. Taixi's heart hammered as he finally understood.

'This man doesn't want to be stained by a single thread of karma. His heart holds nothing but his Immortal Dao!'

The Maha's sleeve shook, scattering several streaks of white light toward Chi Buzi. Simultaneously, Taixi channeled his dharma winds at full power, transforming into a streak of golden light and fleeing with insane speed.

Chi Buzi paid him no mind. He casually lifted his sleeve, gathered the few treasures into his robes, and began to inspect them at his leisure.

Radiant Pass and the brilliant light in the sky had long since fled. Si Yuanli stood rooted to the spot, feeling as though he couldn't breathe.

If he had been mostly indignant, though unnerved, when the two Maha first besieged him, his mood had shifted drastically when Li Zhouwei appeared. Now, however, he had plunged back into an abyss of anxiety. His heart was filled with nothing but terror and ice.

What if Chi Buzi was here for revenge? He didn't even need to _actively_ seek it. Just passing by with a casual thought would be enough! This was a grotto-heaven, a place without even a connection to the Great Void! While Si Yuanli had used his inheritance to learn the entry and exit points… could he truly last that long?

He wasn't Li Zhouwei, who had been at a safe distance and could retreat calmly. Chi Buzi was right in front of him! Who knew if the Chou-Gui Hidden Form already had a Spiritual Sword aimed at his back, ready to strike at any moment?

For a time, he knew neither to offer thanks nor to turn and flee. Si Yuanli could only silently retract his Spiritual Treasure, hiding it in his sleeve. He appeared to be bowing in deference, but in reality, he was braced to strike. Only then did Chi Buzi turn his head.

Strangely, the eyes of this prodigy of the Chi family held not a trace of hatred. There wasn't even a single negative emotion. They were utterly clear, watching him with a warm smile.

"Yuanli… I didn't expect you to have achieved a divine ability too!"

Si Yuanli secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He wisely avoided mentioning any sect affairs and mirrored the smile.

"It is only because the old Daoist Master's methods are profound, allowing even a mediocre talent like myself to one day achieve a divine ability."

"Good, good, good…"

Chi Buzi seemed exceptionally polite, as if the Chi family truly had nothing to do with him. He smiled.

"You've lived up to expectations… The sect is fortunate to have you!"

Si Yuanli's heart pounded as he heard this, unsure if it was courtesy or sarcasm. He gave an awkward reply. But Chi Buzi took a step forward, his smiling gaze fixed on him.

"Yuanli wouldn't _not_ recognize me, would you?"

Si Yuanli froze. A chill ran down his spine. The words were almost identical to those spoken to Taixi. He still found it hard to believe. He met the Great Daoist Master's gaze, and the hand clutching his sleeve trembled. He couldn't bring himself to take out the items, hoping against hope that the man was joking.

"Of course…" he answered nervously.

Chi Buzi's smile widened.

"You know who I am, yet you just stand there watching!"

Si Yuanli’s eyes snapped open. Only then did he discover that roiling Pristine Water had completely surrounded the area. Despite his extreme reluctance, suppressing his rage and hatred, he could only shake the white lights from his sleeve. Bitterness filled his heart.

'…So it was a disaster after all!'

Chi Buzi received the items with a casual hand. He glanced at them and shook his head.

"You really are a greedy one. You weren't willing to give those two high monks a single share. No wonder they refused to let you go and dragged things out here for so long…"

"I remember… the Sima Family has people in Wanling Heaven, correct? I wonder which peak they cultivate on, and how capable they are."

His expression was composed as he asked casually:

"What good things did they leave behind that were worth all this trouble for you?"

Si Yuanli felt a deep sense of humiliation but had no choice other than to lower his head. In this grotto-heaven, cut off from the Great Void and suppressed by Dharma Treasures, a Great Daoist Master's power was on another level entirely. He could only say respectfully:

"My ancestor… Sima Duan, sought the Dao in Wanling Heaven. He studied under Immutable Peak and received its Dao Lineage. He once authored a book… Here in the Echoing Void Palace, there is a Spiritual Treasure of the Horn Wood Dao, called Spring's Few Branches… It is right here."

"Oh?"

Chi Buzi scanned his face with a scrutinizing gaze. Without bothering to examine the lights in his hand, he simply stepped onto the Pristine Water and ascended into the air, leaving Si Yuanli to straighten up, his face burning with shame.

"Daoist Friend Minghuang!"

Li Zhouwei arrived on a streak of light. Xiang Chun was just flying up from the mountains, guiding him closer.

"It's almost time," she whispered.

Li Zhouwei, however, was still pondering the matter of Chi Buzi.

'He may have forgotten what happened back then, but surely he hasn't forgotten the incident in the Eastern Sea? With so many Golden Cores outside, he too must tread carefully.'

The Li family naturally held deep suspicions about Chi Buzi. His attempt to spy on the immortal artifact back then was bad enough. Later, he had returned to the Eastern Sea and said some truly terrifying things. Whether he was being arrogant or it was the truth, it was a matter that could never be spoken of again… But as for whether he was still the original Chi Buzi… perhaps not even Chi Buzi himself knew.

He could only suppress these thoughts, return Xiang Chun's courtesy, and reply, "I saw that Daoist Master Chi Buzi has also arrived. I fear something major is about to happen here."

"Chi Buzi…"

Xiang Chun frowned. "He has thrown in his lot with the Viewing Pavilion faction now. He’s quite brazen, daring to show his face. I don't know what the Exalted Ones are thinking!"

Li Zhouwei nodded thoughtfully, acknowledging her words as they moved closer to the great formation. As he walked, he silently activated an ability. The power of his Spirit Probe began to operate.

Just as he'd thought, even a great formation like this, linked to the Profound Foundation and guarding the grotto-heaven's core secrets, could not hide from his Spirit Probe.

But the instant he passed through the formation, his vision was flooded with infinite golden light. There was nothing else. Just this overlapping, blinding radiance, so dense it was like staring directly into the Supreme Yang. It almost caused an adverse reaction in his true body!

'This is…'

The intense light instantly contracted. Only then, through a hazy mist, did he see ninety-nine segments of golden light, coiling in the air. Even though he wasn't facing it directly, it still filled him with an immense sense of suffocation.

"A Golden Core Dharma Treasure!"

He narrowed his eyes slightly, quickly averting his gaze from the object. He stopped looking at the highest treasure hall and instead swept his gaze over the many magnificent immortal palaces along the mountainside. His eyes passed over the two Wanling Flower Trees planted at the mountain's base, and four Daoist pagodas came into view, each suppressing a Spiritual Treasure that now appeared in his mind.

"There really are Spiritual Treasures!"

This wasn't surprising. There were traces of Spiritual Treasures outside the formation; there were bound to be more within. He carefully examined the four Spiritual Treasures. The Merging Fire item was a pot, the Gathering Wood item was a ruler, the Mansion Water item was a pearl, and the Treasured Earth item was a seal. They were clearly a matched set.

'Never mind the others, but Wei Xuanyin and Chi Buzi are both here… There are probably even more Great Daoist Masters, perhaps even seventh or eighth-life Maha. All their eyes are fixed on this place. It won't be easy.'

But his mind was already working. He didn't linger on the four pagodas. On the surface, he appeared to be closing his eyes to focus, but his Spirit Probe was operating at full capacity, searching palace by palace.

Some of these palaces were in disarray, others completely empty. Clearly, some of their masters were still in the grotto-heaven, while others had left long before it was sealed. Two even showed signs of cultivators who had passed away in meditation, with Purple Mansion Realm resources scattered on the floor.

"Nearly forty percent are empty. When these ancestor-level figures leave, they often take their disciples with them… This means the Wanling Heaven currently being plundered by cultivators… is only at sixty percent of its peak…"

But even with forty percent empty, the sheer abundance of spiritual items and resources left him speechless. He silently calculated on his fingers.

"Two, four, six…"

There were six more Spiritual Treasures scattered among these surrounding immortal palaces!

'Added to the four in the center… that's ten Spiritual Treasures… Ten whole Spiritual Treasures! And there are even two Spiritual Artifacts that have clearly degraded due to a shift in their Fruition Attainment. They look damaged…'

'Even the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition… might not have this much!'

The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition had been the hegemon of Jiangnan for a very long time. The six branches of Chongming certainly had more than ten Spiritual Treasures, but this was only _sixty percent_ of Wanling Heaven… and that didn't even count the Spiritual Treasures outside the formation…

Li Zhouwei had no time for awe. His gaze swept rapidly through the immortal palaces.

'The moment this opens, the Great Daoist Masters will definitely rush for the obvious Spiritual Treasures under the pagodas. That will be the best time to snatch one of the scattered ones…'

Although he was confident in his Body Divine Ability, in such a chaotic situation, speed and decisiveness were paramount. He scanned carefully, and his gaze finally settled on the second palace on the far southern edge.

This palace was entirely crimson. Before it stood four arches, all of deep-red lacquer with profound patterns, featuring ornate brackets and crimson railings. Statues of fire-stepping birds stood guard, radiating a majestic aura—this was clearly a palace of Li Fire!

'Wanling Heaven is full of Merging Fire… a Li Fire palace is incredibly rare!'

Under his detailed scan, he saw that this palace enshrined a Spiritual Treasure. The left-side hall even contained a Spiritual Artifact, and the right-side hall held Li Fire spiritual materials and cultivation manuals. It was an extremely complete set. Perhaps this grotto-heaven didn't value Li Fire, and the master of this palace was the only one with deep cultivation in it, allowing all the good things to fall into his hands. Setting aside the Spiritual Treasure, the value of its contents was undoubtedly among the top one or two of all the mountainside palaces, perhaps even rivaling those near the central pagodas!

He silently memorized its location and began to reassess.

It wasn't that there were no Bright Yang palaces in the mountain, but they only contained Spiritual Artifacts. Although the quality of those artifacts was high, they were still a grade below a Spiritual Treasure. Moreover, the Li family already had enough Bright Yang items. Taking more wasn't just a matter of redundant utility.

'When I fall one day… the clan will need something other than Bright Yang to rely on. I must prepare for this early…'

His gaze traveled down the mountain, pausing for a moment on the plaque that read "I Command the Laws of Heaven," before finally landing on the endless field of bones at the mountain's foot.

A headless corpse wearing a feathered crane-cloak and draped in scriptures stood silently, holding a Spiritual Treasure in its hand! But the Spiritual Treasure was not the most eye-catching thing about it. What forced one to look away was the terrifying Sword Intent radiating from the corpse itself!

'What incredible Way of the Sword…'

His heart shook. He prudently severed the Spirit Probe connection at once, but his eyes still stung. He glanced silently at Xiang Chun, who was busy with her calculations, and exhaled without drawing attention.

"This sealing and absorbing power is growing stronger. I wonder what kind of marvel it is."

He wasn't wrong. The closer they got to the Dharma Treasure, the stronger this sealing and absorbing force became. His Body Divine Ability was formidable, so it didn't affect him much, but Purple Mansion Realm cultivators without one would likely be in trouble.

"If it's like this out here, I can't imagine how terrifying it will be inside the formation."

His concern was clear. Xiang Chun paused her calculations and replied:

"Wanling Heaven possesses a Dharma Treasure left by the ancient True Monarch Chongyuan, called the Lingyang Immutable Palace. It has the ability to seal and absorb. This is just its power leaking out."

"As for your worry… the sealing power here has actually weakened considerably. If we had come here right after entering the grotto-heaven, we might have been immobilized. Several True Monarchs are currently lifting the Dharma Treasure into the Great Void. How else could this formation be opened? It looks like we are opening the formation, but really, we're just waiting for good news from outside."

"I see."

Li Zhouwei said in a low voice, "I wonder what kind of Dharma Treasure it is, to require several Exalted Ones to move it."

This touched on Xiang Chun's own doubts. She nodded in agreement.

"They must have some concern…"

She was pondering this when her expression suddenly changed. "There's movement!" she whispered.

Li Zhouwei looked up. Sure enough, the vast white light barrier spanning the heavens was fading, bit by bit. A commotion erupted all around them. Divine abilities flared, and the great rumbling grew louder and more intense.

_BOOM!_

In the blink of an eye, the white light in the sky shattered, scattering like a roiling white wind. In that instant, countless streaks of multicolored light appeared. True Fire and spiritual water erupted in the sky as everyone made their move!

"The formation is broken!"

Blinding multicolored lights fell like a meteor shower, trailing long tails of flame as they flew into the depths. Some paused to observe the situation before changing direction; others casually scattered water and fire to interfere with their rivals. But the major powers, like Golden Feather and Viewing Pavilion, had clear targets, flying straight for the mountain's summit!

Sovereign's Perilous Tread!

Li Zhouwei was already braced to act. His Body Divine Ability flared to its absolute limit, golden patterns flashing on his face. He became a streaking comet, smashing through all the water, fire, and golden light blocking his path, heading straight for the mountainside!
