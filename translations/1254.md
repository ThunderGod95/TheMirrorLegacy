# Chapter 1254: This Moment

A Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

Hues coalesced and clouds of qi churned as an illusory white radiance flowed between heaven and earth; a young man sat quietly upon the Jade Terrace, the Bright Yang radiance of his body continuously retracting inward to gather between his palms.

As the last trace of color from the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill within his sea of qi sank away, dissolving into motes of white light until it was completely consumed, a brilliant streak of light finally leaped up from within the snow-white mist, illuminating all around!

'Imperial Observation of the Origin.'

Li Zhouwei exhaled a breath of white qi.

'Seven hundred and twelve days… The second 'Imperial Observation of the Origin' is complete!'

Whether in terms of Dao-Profundity, Dao insight, or cultivation talent, Li Zhouwei was among the finest in the world; given sufficient resources, even for something as incredibly difficult to attain as the 'Imperial Observation of the Origin,' he had spent just under two years to successfully cultivate his immortal foundation!

If not for the instability of his divine ability and the injuries he carried hindering his cultivation, his progress would have been even faster.

'Another three years to perfect this immortal foundation, and the divine ability will be within my grasp.'

Of course, Li Zhouwei had no intention of wasting time refining his immortal foundation; instead, he rose and walked into the chamber, and as he reached the table, his gaze fell upon a long-necked jade vase resting on it.

He offered a respectful bow, then closed his eyes and centered himself. The jade vase began to shake rapidly, and in but a moment, a brilliant white ribbon of light leaped out, twirled gracefully in the air, and cascaded down!

It was Talisman Qi.

The speed at which the Li family perfected their immortal foundations was, in fact, terrifying; each strand of nourishing Talisman Qi was no less potent than a spiritual item of the Purple Mansion Realm. This ribbon of light lingered in his sea of qi, swirling around his immortal foundation, coiling and circling, nourishing it without pause.

Li Zhouwei stabilized his aura, calmed the restless immortal foundation, let out a long breath, and closed his eyes to make some calculations.

'With the nourishment from this supreme substance, even if I don't actively cultivate, the immortal foundation will reach perfection on its own in five years. There will be no delay at all...'

That was right; Li Zhouwei planned to continue cultivating even as he waged war.

'If I can take Luoxia within five years and return to the lake victorious, my immortal foundation will reach completion at the perfect time, and I can immediately achieve my divine ability!'

He rested for a moment before a sound came from the pavilion. Multicolored light rippled as Li Que'wan entered, riding a vermilion wind. She offered a brief salute, and Li Zhouwei smiled.

"Excellent, you were even faster than I was."

Li Que'wan smiled and nodded.

Her 'Awaiting the Supreme Divine' was complete!

Li Que'wan had achieved the Dao five years after Li Jiangqian, and it had been sixteen years in total since she had attained her divine ability. She had spent a great deal of time on other matters, so to have completed this cultivation now was nothing short of miraculous speed!

She said softly,

"Your Majesty, I consumed a medicinal pill and completed my cultivation three months ago. I have spent the days since in seclusion, practicing spell arts and making preparations in secret."

As she spoke of this, a flicker of regret showed in her eyes.

"Xiukui's Sand-Pointing Curse Art draws upon the Dao of Transformations and incorporates shamanic arts, making it extremely suitable for me. Unfortunately, there was too little time. A hundred days was enough to become proficient, but it's still not enough to make a truly dazzling showing."

Li Zhouwei, however, nodded in satisfaction. At the Purple Mansion Realm, spell arts were endlessly profound; it was rare to even gain a foothold in an ordinary art within three months, let alone one as notoriously difficult as 'Whole Pill.' He said,

"You have a profound foundation and a deep understanding of transformations. Your advantages become even more apparent at the Purple Mansion Realm, where you can make use of all manner of spiritual pills and Spiritual Artifacts. Perhaps your cultivation will be even faster than your brother's!"

Without the slightest hesitation or a moment's delay, he raised his head and took a single step forward. The scenery of sun and moon around him flickered and vanished, and below his feet, the lake's surface glittered—he had already arrived above the great island!

With that single step, he sensed something. He raised his head, an eyebrow arched, and his brilliant golden gaze fell upon a mountain peak on the lake's shore. Looking at the grand hall perched on its summit, the corners of his mouth curved into a faint smile.

'Excellent... he's succeeded, too!'

Li Que'wan gazed at the mountain, her eyes full of curiosity, but Li Zhouwei did not proceed immediately. Instead, he took another step, and the scenery around them changed abruptly to a mountain peak covered in a flurry of white blossoms and roiling flames.

Gardenia Scenery Mountain!

The Daoist Master seated upon a jade pillar seemed to sense their arrival. He opened his eyes, a golden glint flashing within them, and his face instantly lit up with joy as he descended upon a ray of Heavenly Light.

"You're out of seclusion?!"

"I am."

The Daoist Master immediately looked to Li Que'wan, nodding repeatedly. A smile touched Li Zhouwei's eyes as he remarked,

"Congratulations, Grand-uncle."

The Li Ximing before them was brilliantly radiant. The color of Heavenly Light at the center of his brow was more vivid than ever, and a ring of the Light of the Six Harmonies circled him, refracting the faint, multicolored afterimage of a Purple Mansion divine ability—his 'World's Radiance' was complete!

Hearing this, Li Ximing could not help but smile as well.

"Yes... it's finally complete! And for this... I have Jueyin to thank!"

The joy on his face deepened, and then, as if just realizing, he slapped his thigh and laughed.

"Minghuang, Jueyin has succeeded!"

Only then did Li Que'wan understand, while Li Zhouwei simply shook his head and smiled.

"I know."

Li Ximing nodded in sudden understanding, then turned to pour some tea and said with a laugh,

"He cultivated the 'Eternal Brightness Steps' and took a bit of my Light of the Six Harmonies… I didn't expect it to have some benefits!"

Over the past days, Li Ximing had remained seated on the mountain, sending his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body to watch the furnace while he secretly focused on cultivating his divine ability.

That 'World's Radiance' had been repeatedly refined in his Shengyang Acupoint, brightening at a torturously slow pace. Even with the aid of the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill, his progress had felt arduous, something Li Ximing had long grown accustomed to.

He had not expected that upon entering seclusion this time, his 'World's Radiance' would begin to pulse, as if it had received some kind of response. The originally difficult path of cultivation was like a new world being carved open, flowing with swathes of color; his speed had more than doubled!

"Not only did giving away some of the Light of the Six Harmonies not affect me, it even helped me complete 'World's Radiance'!"

Li Ximing was overjoyed.

He had naturally seen Li Zhouwei's concern. When Li Jiangqian had come looking for him, he had been extremely anxious; twenty years had passed, and he could not afford to fail. But from another perspective, Li Ximing himself had spent a full thirty-one years just perfecting this 'World's Radiance' of his!

Whether it was Li Jiangqian, Li Que'wan, or now Cui Jueyin, he was happy in his heart to see these juniors achieve success one after another, but when he looked back at his own cultivation speed, he couldn't help but feel anxious—even if the time he actually spent cultivating was indeed not much.

Now that he finally had an opportunity, he had decisively taken the pill and entered a long seclusion, completing his cultivation in less than two years!

Standing on the mountain at this moment, the divine ability aura throughout his body was harmonious and complete. The perfection of 'World's Radiance' made his presence more restrained and had also improved his divination skills.

"Eternal Brightness Steps…"

Li Zhouwei first carefully observed his aura, then listened as he relayed Cui Jueyin's words. He nodded slightly, not surprised, and said with a smile,

"That's as it should be… Imperial Observation of the Origin is a system of monarch and minister; World's Radiance is a heart of ruler and subject. Without steps, without fealty, how can one illuminate the world? This aligns with the intent and the divine ability. If it still hadn't been completed, then there would be a problem with the cultivation method."

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly, still exuding a cheerful air. But seeing that Li Zhouwei was out of seclusion and the time was near, he quickly grew concerned.

"This is rather unfortunate… Jiangqian just took the pill and went into seclusion. Although he has the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument to aid him with its power to impart teachings and assist divine abilities, it's absolutely not something that can be done in two years!"

He said with regret,

"What a pity. The Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument has the power to aid in achieving the Dao. He has to keep it with him to cultivate and can't free his hands. Otherwise, if you took that Spiritual Treasure with you to the north, it would be like giving a tiger wings!"

"It's fine."

Li Zhouwei shook his head gently.

"Let him have his seclusion. He doesn't necessarily have to go with us this time. The ten-year agreement we made before was mainly for the later matter with the Xiao family. Leaving him to guard the great desert now is also a use for him. Que'wan, on the other hand, must go with me to the north."

This was beyond doubt. Li Zhouwei would certainly make use of the Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure on this trip; no matter what, Li Que'wan had to go with him!

He said quietly, "Que'wan is actually safer now, especially since the two of them have not yet mastered their divine abilities. Jiangqian is in far greater danger than Que'wan… After all, in terms of life preservation, Li Fire is far inferior to Whole Pill."

"From a broader perspective, the Golden Feather Sect currently intends to protect her. Luoxia is right under their noses; they can't sit idly by, for both sentimental and logical reasons. No one will help Jiangqian. He is also my eldest son and of great use to the Buddhist cultivators, which makes him a target."

Li Que'wan listened intently throughout, not saying a word. Li Ximing, however, nodded thoughtfully.

"Minghuang, you planned long ago for him to stay and guard the lake…"

Li Zhouwei remained noncommittal, only asking,

"Is there any news from Jiangchun?"

At these words, the Daoist Master before him quickly took a black talisman from his sleeve and handed it over with a grave expression, saying softly,

"He didn't come back… It was Yang Tianyou—she returned for a visit in the name of accompanying her husband home and placed this item in my hands."

Li Zhouwei gently took it. The patterns on this talisman were extremely complex and glowed with a faint black light. Under the probe of his spiritual sense, it was completely empty, clearly having been enhanced with 'Exiled Qi'!

"The Yang clan has agreed to act, and not just people like Yang Ruiyi and Yang Ruizao, but the ones behind them… Perhaps they were forced, or perhaps they had this intention all along. For now, at least, they approve."

Li Zhouwei observed it for a long time before suddenly replying. Li Ximing said in a low voice,

"She said the Song Emperor… wants to move the capital!"

Since Li Zhouwei had emerged from seclusion, he had foreseen many things; even good news like Cui Jueyin's breakthrough had only made him raise an eyebrow. But when the words 'move the capital' fell on his ears, for the first time, a surprised and complex expression appeared on his face. After a long moment, he said,

"Jingchuan or Shanji?"

Li Ximing nodded.

"The news hasn't spread yet. The imperial court sent people to Jingchuan to pay respects to the ancestors. The entire Great Song, from top to bottom, is saying it's a power struggle between two sides, that the Song Emperor wants to seize the autonomy of the Sword Gate. Rumors are flying everywhere, creating a lot of unpleasantness. Only after getting this news did I realize they were secretly making preparations. It must be Jingchuan!"

"Bold…"

Li Zhouwei praised, saying,

"Lake Xian has been pacified. Although spiritual qi is flourishing, there is no defensive ground. Once the capital is moved, the northern gate will become Chengshui Marsh—this gate is not secure, and is even adjacent to the lands of Yan and Qi. Once it is breached, the north can ride straight down and the army can immediately be at the city walls!"

"In that case, Jianghuai, which was once a place of strategic advance and retreat, will immediately become forbidden ground where not an inch of land can be ceded… Once there is turmoil in the north, it will lead to great trouble…"

A more complex look appeared in his eyes.

"He is using the fortune of his emperorship to force the Yang clan into the fray!"

If it were only that, it would not have been enough to surprise him so much, but Li Zhouwei had a good grasp of the situation and understood the circumstances behind this move.

"The most troublesome part is… he is forcing the Yang family, not the Underworld… The two are completely different. This is a gamble…"

If the Underworld's determination for Yang Zhuo to achieve the Dao was not firm enough, if they held even a sliver of thought that it could either succeed or fail, a single Yang clan would not be enough to hold the line in the north!

The Song Emperor's intention in this was crystal clear, just like their conversation in that small pavilion all those years ago:

'Unless I, Yang Zhuo, fall before I seek the Dao, no one in the Great Song will obstruct King Wei from seeking the Dao!'

With today's actions alone, he had lived up to that promise!

Li Zhouwei gazed distantly to the south, silent for a long time. His five fingers gradually closed, and the pitch-black wooden talisman in his palm, like a piece of rotten wood, shattered with a bang!

An formless stream of light leaped up, like a layer of gray mist or a flickering black gleam. It first borrowed the Great Void to speed far away, disappearing at the edge of the lake, only then did it sense heaven and earth, seeming to connect with a distant existence.

Li Ximing's face suddenly lost its color.

He of course knew what Li Zhouwei had come out of seclusion to do. Li Ximing's perception was not the strongest, but he possessed a Life Divine Ability and was experienced enough to have been observing!

In his eyes, the current King Wei's divine ability was unstable, and his dharma body was faintly injured, yet no dharma power was leaking out, and his aura was stable—it clearly looked like an old injury that had not yet healed.

If it were anyone else, they would likely assume his Wu Earth injury had not yet fully healed, but both of the medicinal pills had come from Li Ximing's own hands. It wasn't a Wu Earth injury, so it must be a failure to cross the Purple Mystery!
This made him silently lower his head, sighing inwardly.

'The threshold of the Purple Mystery is difficult to cross, and even vaguely touches upon the secrets of the various great Daoist Traditions. The injuries from a failed breakthrough can be light or heavy; it's normal for him to be injured… But for such an important matter, he didn't even ask me for a pill or two…'

'Perhaps… he wasn't very confident to begin with.'

He had already begun to secretly consider what pills to use to heal Li Zhouwei, and had thought he would wait several months to prepare properly, but he never expected this King Wei to crush the talisman in his hand in an instant! Stunned for a moment, he confirmed in a low voice,

"Now?"

Li Zhouwei's golden pupils shone with a brilliant light, and as if reading his mind, he said softly,

"There are capable people in the north as well; they may not fail to see the truth behind the Jingchuan matter. The longer this drags on, the more I fear complications will arise."

He felt a strange sense in his heart, but there was another reason:

'If I don't act soon, I won't be able to maintain my injuries!'

Li Zhouwei's divine ability and Dao-Profundity were high, and his 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' was enhanced with the ability to escape perilous situations. Even though his dharma blood and body were precious, his healing speed was not slow. He had cultivated the 'Profound Vastness Art' for many years, and its clear qi surged, constantly trying to repair his injuries on its own!

While cultivating, Li Zhouwei also had to suppress the power of this 'Profound Vastness Art'!

He had managed to maintain his injuries to this day, to maintain this appearance of having overcome the calamity but with the old wounds from Lake Xian not yet healed, and it had taken considerable effort. If he delayed any longer, the injuries would slowly heal on their own over time. He feared that before he even met the people of the world, his wounds would be almost fully recovered!

"We can't delay. It must be now!"
