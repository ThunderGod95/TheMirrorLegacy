# Chapter 869: Lingering Sunlight Over The Huai River

The wind along the riverbank was fierce, with dark black rocks scattered among the river waters. The jagged stones created eddies in the flow, some calm, others turbulent. Occasionally the reflections of the sky could be seen in the bends where the water was smooth.

However, there was a single point of brightness amid the dense night fog.

A man in platinum armor rose high into the sky, shining like a white star in the dim night, radiating a blazing light. The cultivators in the north hesitated for a moment, then all looked up at him.

"Li Xuanfeng of Bianyan..."

The crowd of cultivators did not just have rogue cultivators and family cultivators, but also experts. They were all silently waiting for something. The entire stretch of the river from north to south fell eerily silent, leaving only the sound of the surging water.

Si Yuanli was also a decisive man. Once he’d made his decision, his mindset shifted immediately. His sword aura was ethereal as he stood beside Li Xuanfeng.

There were many cultivators on the northern bank, yet they were divided into several factions. Several Buddhist cultivators and Master Monks gradually arrived, settling in the back like immovable mountains. The front was mostly made of family and rogue cultivators conscripted from the northern counties, with their sects often a mix of Daoist, Buddhist, and demonic practitioners. It made for a complicated scene.

The rogue cultivators and minor sect cultivators were clearly much simpler; they were either purely practicing Daoist or devil cultivation, or sometimes both. In any case, they were all demonic in nature, with no real conflict. They were mixed with devil cultivators from all over the southern and northern regions. There were even some from overseas, all here to fish for profit. It made for a chaotic gathering.

Si Yuanli watched for a while and even saw some Zhao State’s banners. He wasn’t surprised; Zhao’s imperial court had become a puppet of the Buddhist Dao, but unlike Wu and Yue, it wasn’t just an empty shell. The Buddhist cultivators used Zhao’s court to conscript cultivators, and it looked more legitimate that way.

He turned to Li Qinghong and spoke softly, "Buddhist cultivators from the Way of Emptiness, Compassion, and Virtuous are gradually arriving. The northern bank is no longer as chaotic and leaderless as before. Buddhist cultivators like to seize the destiny and fortune of this north-south conflict; they definitely won’t give up easily. We must remain vigilant."

Boom!

Thunder rumbled twice in the clouds when he finished. The dim, dark smoke rose, and Li Xuanfeng stood in mid-air, bow in hand and bathed in golden light. The cultivators he had halted with his shout began to press forward again after more than ten seconds.

Brilliant platinum light shimmered in the air, beams of bright light shooting out, piercing the night across the river. The man released the string and drew a scroll from his waist.

The scroll wasn’t large and looked quite ordinary, yet now all eyes from north and south were focused on him alone. Every burning gaze fell on that scroll, some curious, some suspicious; all their pupils followed its every movement.

Li Xuanfeng’s eyes also fell on the spirit artifact. He poured his spiritual sense and mana into it. The ivory-white hook fastener untied itself, and the long scroll unfurled, forming a sheet of white in the air.

Li Xuanfeng personally held the scroll and took in its contents at a glance. It was a vast depiction of the Huai River region. The depiction covered five thousand kilometers of the river, with rich scenery of vividly lifelike birds and beasts on both banks. It was far longer than the river at his feet as it wound and twisted its way until it flowed grandly into the Eastern Sea.

His gaze followed the scroll all the way to the end, "Huai River Map, Boye Cui Yan, Year 317 of Zhenghe."

When the scroll opened, countless red light streams burst forth, swirling like fireflies in the air. Li Xuanfeng’s voice was slightly hoarse, but sonorous and powerful, "Shining in the Profound Mystery, remnants of sunlight over the Huai River..."

His voice was drawn into the scroll the moment he spoke. The sky instantly brightened, and the clouds transformed into a brilliant golden hue as a sheet of bright light fell from the heavens.

Below, Li Ximing’s pupils slowly widened. His Immortal Foundation seemed to stir, letting out a series of rumbles. A dazzling brilliance was reflected in his eyes as he murmured, "Bright Yang..."

Before tens of thousands of onlookers, a golden light flew out from the scroll and descended from the sky. A brilliant radiance appeared beneath Li Xuanfeng’s feet. The great river had turned into a bright, clear golden stream.

The bright river continued to surge forward. A shadow faintly emerged on the water’s surface, and a second later, a tall pass rose from beneath the water, breaking through the surface and soaring into the sky.

The pass stretched on without end, its patterns intricate and bright. The white bricks fitted together perfectly, with a jade-like color that shone even brighter. It exuded an ancient yet elegant beauty as it rose into the sky.

Splash!

The heads of the assembled cultivators slowly lifted as their eyes followed the pass into the air. Golden river water shimmered as it cascaded down the pass like countless golden waterfalls.

"An ancient spirit artifact... Huai River Map" A voice from the north murmured. The words echoed among the cultivators, sounding especially sharp in the quiet atmosphere.

The sky grew dim once more. The man in platinum armor stood atop the hundred-zhang pass dividing north and south like an ancient celestial general. Behind him, white illusions formed concentric rings of light, illuminating the space at his side.

Countless mysteries rose in Li Xuanfeng’s mind, and both of his Immortal Foundations received some kind of blessing. Thick mana surged outward, allowing him to lightly float in the air. The Heavenly Gilded Helm covering his body shone more clearly than ever, exuding a fierce and mighty aura along with dazzling platinum light.

Buzz.

He raised his bow, and a mysterious arrow immediately fell onto the string. Sharp light began to flicker along the bow, and powerful Astral Qi spread behind him, leaving golden trails that occasionally put his face in shadow.

Whoosh...

A flash of golden brilliance streaked through the air. All the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators felt a sudden alarm in their hearts and hastily raised their dharma artifacts in panic. The cultivators on the riverbank froze all at once as colorful dharma artifacts, red, orange, green, rose into the air, creating a dazzling display.

Boom!

But the head of a middle-aged cultivator standing on the northern bank exploded with a bang. The dharma artifact in his hand was torn through like thin paper, raining down on the others in a flurry. The blast of dharma light and Astral Qi erupted, producing a deafening roar.

Rumble!

The surrounding cultivators all backed away. This person hadn’t even taken a single blow before being killed on the spot. His only claim to existence was a red mist rising to the sky, transforming into a crimson light like a sunset glow.

"A phenomenon... that’s truly dead!" The elderly cultivator beside him turned pale, trembling as he exclaimed in fright, "Chunyu Bei is dead... even though he was injured, that was just one arrow! How can this be reasonable?!

"We are, after all, prefecture temple masters from many regions, yet in front of this man, we’re like dogs and chickens... what’s the point of fighting?!"

The crowd did not even have a chance to mourn before a fearful wailing rose in their ears. The cold-faced man already had five more arrows nocked on his bow. The Embryonic Breathing Realm and Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators that were at his feet, the monks and nuns, couldn’t see the situation clearly and rushed forward in confusion, but every Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator collectively took a step back.

"Not good!"

Boom!

Brilliant golden light exploded everywhere. Before the elder could even see who had died or been injured, several black escape lights shot into the sky. Li Xuanfeng exhaled lightly, and five more arrows appeared on his bowstring.

The elder felt a cold chill on his neck, stepped back, and exclaimed in shock, "Why is no one stepping up? Are you forcing us to die for nothing!"

Terror spread across the northern bank. Even the lesser cultivators on the ground raised their heads, and the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators’ escape lights flickered in and out, showing signs of collapse.

Meanwhile, the many cultivators on the southern bank were equally shocked. They all looked up at Li Xuanfeng in the air, expressions of joy appearing on their faces. They flew up to the pass one after another, each raising their dharma artifact.

Li Xuanfeng’s body shone brightly as he lightly juggled the arrows in his hand. At last, the north could no longer hold out. A monk soared forward on the wind, his muscular body tense and eyes wide with anger as he shouted, "Little demon, how dare you be so insolent!"

This monk, so different from the usual Buddhist cultivators with their few dharma artifacts, now stood on a golden cloud at his feet. He also held a crescent-moon spade covered in brilliant patterns. It was quite luxurious.

Only then did he ride the wind upward, immediately followed by a tall, thin monk with a constant smile on his face. His left hand rested flat against his chest, thumb and index finger pinching a golden ring. He said nothing as he silently followed.

Li Xuanfeng, empowered by the spirit artifact beneath his feet, shone with bright light that moved with his every motion. It did not just boost his physical strength and mana but also spread his spiritual sense across the entire riverbank. He merely glanced coldly as he drew his bow, golden light streaming past both sides of his face.

Buzz!

Although the two monks called him a demon, they didn’t dare to be careless. Their faces turned serious, and the smile on the thin monk’s face froze, as if facing a great enemy. He raised the golden ring in his hand.

The golden ring rolled and expanded in midair, revealing dense patterns. It spewed a hazy golden light that abruptly captured a speck of golden energy. The thin monk immediately beamed and commanded, "Collect!"

The dense clattering of metal echoed across the riverbank, making everyone’s ears ring. The thin monk looked tense, as if facing a great foe, and the burly monk quickly swung his dharma artifact forward, aiming to strike Li Xuanfeng.

The two monks’ brief obstruction allowed the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators behind them to finally reach the riverbank. The northern and southern cultivators clashed, countless lights rose into the sky, and roaring sounds filled the air.

Li Xuanfeng’s single arrow had been blocked, but his expression remained unchanged. He was renowned far and wide, so it was only natural that the north would send special dharma artifacts and cultivators to counter him. It was no surprise.

"Courting death."

The tall, thin monk wasn’t particularly strong. It was clear from a glance that he was just a pawn sent to probe. Only his dharma artifact was somewhat unusual.

Li Xuanfeng stamped his black boots, drew his bowstring, and sneered, "Go!"

The golden-red arrow in his hand vanished in an instant. A burst of golden-red light erupted in the sky, and the golden ring seemed to be struck hard from the front. The mana dissipated, and it reverted to its original form as it flew backward. The thin monk spat out a mouthful of blood, his eyes reflecting the golden-red brilliance.

Bang!

Li Xuanfeng’s full-strength shot, empowered by the Purple Mansion Realm’s spirit artifact, was even more powerful than the arrow that once pierced through Tang Shedu. The thin monk’s upper body was instantly torn to shreds; his lower body lingered for just a moment before being shredded by Astral Qi as well, leaving only a golden light drifting northward toward reincarnation.

Only then did the burly monk charge forward, his body covered in golden runes. His crescent-moon spade fell like a meteor from the sky, bringing a sweeping golden light crashing down.

Boom!

The golden light scattered, revealing a large hand covered in golden-white armor plating that had caught the dharma artifact. Li Xuanfeng tightened his grip on the artifact. The platinum patterns on his face intertwined with radiant light, transforming his previously fierce features into a solemn majesty.

"Just with you?"

The cold words froze the monk in place, preventing him from retreating. His voice thundered through the sky, "Since Tang Shedu rebelled and turned to The Merciful One, then killing me in the midst of the north-south conflict must be a fine opportunity..."

Circles of light rippled behind him, his golden armor shining brilliantly. The patterns on his face radiated authority. He held the burly monk’s dharma artifact lightly in his hand and cast his bright, golden gaze northward.

"Come out, all of you!"

His voice rolled like thunder, reverberating through the clouds, drawing the attention of everyone present.

Figures appeared one after another around him, some holding spears or staffs, and others cradling bottles or rings. Their faces bore the golden features of compassionate Buddhas, but their bodies were like unbreakable Vajra. They stood scattered in the air, around a dozen in total, all eyes staring coldly at him.

Their voices resonated through the air, some male, some female, as if tens of thousands spoke at once, "Brazen demon!"

***

A young man in black emerged from the black smoke, clutching a talisman tightly. He slipped into the crowd of cultivators on the north bank, heading deeper northward until he reached a small hill on the northern side.

A large, fat monk wearing a kasaya approached him. He beamed as he said, "Daoist Friend Yu!"

"Master Monk Xuwang," Yu Jiang responded casually, his face calm though his mind was elsewhere. He raised an eyebrow and asked, "Why does your Buddhist sect have so many Daoist and demonic cultivators under its command?"

"Ah..." Xuwang chuckled twice and replied, "What are you saying? My orthodox sect is the most magnanimous and treats all equally. How could we possibly coerce Daoists or demons, or deny others their Dao lineages? Daoist Friend, you’ve been in the Southern Sea, and you’ve only heard that the Great Zhao is a Buddhist nation, so you assume too much..."

He spoke more seriously, "Although Great Zhao reveres Buddhism, there are still plenty of Daoists and demonic cultivators. We of the Buddhist sect prevail in the prefecture cities, but we Buddhists never interfere in the surrounding prefectures and the mountain wilderness. Those places are left for those with the affinity to find them..."

As he spoke, he led Yu Jiang to the top of the hill, where several people were already seated in a great hall. One of their number, wearing Daoist robes, looked sullen.

When he heard Master Monk Xuwang from afar, he sneered, "Isn’t that the truth?! If there were no devil cultivators, who would even believe in Buddhism?! The common folk are clever, they only become more devout when the devil cultivators grow rampant! Haven’t you heard that beneath Buddhist Mountain lies hell itself?"

He glanced over and recognized Yu Jiang, his tone easing a bit as he casually said, "Daoist Friend, you come from Danjungwulo in the Southern Sea, the place where the Revered One attained Dao. Now it’s where devil cultivators are most numerous, isn’t it?"

Xuwang didn’t get angry, but laughed instead. "What are you saying? We respect their Dao lineages and do not interfere with the mountain cultivators. If they cultivate themselves into demons, eat human flesh and drink blood, and frighten the common people, then in the end, we kill them. That is our merit, is it not?"

The man in Daoist robes sneered but said no more. Yu Jiang turned to look over at an effeminate man in a python robe sitting silently and sipping his tea.

Yu Jiang sat nearby, knowing well why he had been invited. Still, he spoke coldly, "Master Monk, why did you so urgently ask me to come? What’s the matter?"

Xuwang chuckled and replied in a low voice, "Our Mahas, The Merciful Ones, have lost contact. It’s time for us to ponder his true intentions... Daoist Friend Yu, you’re still in touch with some great cultivators, could you give us some guidance?"

"What is there to guide?" Yu Jiang understood his meaning but deliberately didn’t expose it. Instead, he wanted to glean more information, so he stood up and pointed south, speaking coldly, "Can’t you see what’s happening in the south? You’re asking me to break the Purple Mansion Realm’s spirit artifact? You think too highly of me! That’s a troublesome matter; please find someone else for it!"

"No, no!" The fat, big-eared monk shook his head repeatedly as he laughed. "The situation is changing, how could the plan remain the same?"

"That ruthless man in the south..."

The monk laughed heartily and replied, "Of course that’s a chance for the senior brothers of my sect. There’s no need for the Daoist friends to intervene!"

Yu Jiang’s heart jolted at that, but then he saw the monk point northward, a smile appearing on his face as he spoke softly, "Daoist Friend, you have a grudge with the Azure Pond Sect, do you not? Only you can quickly break the great formation on Mount Bianyan!"
