# Chapter 837: The Curtain Rises

After Li Jiangqian finished speaking, Ning Wan quietly observed, "By allowing demons to run rampant, don't these Jiangbei powers fear being judged as villains by the True Monarch?"

Li Jiangqian hastily replied, "In the north, ever since the Golden Tang Gate's master, Situ Mo, fell, the sect has completely collapsed. It's in chaos, showing signs of splintering, and can no longer control the various powers under its jurisdiction."

A flicker of regret crossed Ning Wan's face. "If Xuanfeng had managed to hold on until today," she added, "his great opportunity would have arrived."

The Golden Tang Gate possessed the *Heavenly Beard Polished Metal Sutra*, the very Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method that complemented the 'Engraved Gold Stone' technique Li Xuanfeng practiced. If he hadn't needed to rely on elixirs and had cultivated to this day, he might have had a chance to obtain it.

But Li Jiangqian was unsure of the Ning family's stance toward the Si family, so he simply nodded respectfully and changed the subject. "The Daoist Master of Chengyun Gate has some conflict with the Lotus Temple to the north and has taken his forces there. In his absence, a monk named Yaosa Chengmi has taken the opportunity to stir up rebellion, spreading the ways of Buddhist cultivation…"

Jiangbei had been overrun by Buddhist cultivators several times in the past, so their teachings already had a foothold and were popular among the common people, allowing them to spread rapidly. This kind of rebellion was not uncommon. Tinglan added with a smile, "I'd say this Daoist Master Changyun is quite capable. He appears out of the Eastern Sea, brings his sect to heel, and then gets entangled with the Lotus Temple. It’s all a show, pushing and shoving. That Yaosa Chengmi probably thinks he’s clever, believing Minghui is keeping the Daoist Master occupied for him."

Ning Wan seemed lost in thought. Seeing she wasn't going to speak, Li Jiangqian continued, "As for Xuanmiao Temple... they announced their Daoist Master is embarking on a long journey and that the temple will seal its mountain to face a tribulation. They've dismissed all their outer disciples and shut their gates."

"To the south, there's the Capital immortals Dao. Their Daoist Master has vanished, and now the various commanderies are showing signs of self-governance. The situation at Baijiang Creek is extremely volatile. My family has already withdrawn and is now in a standoff with the Capital immortals Dao across the river in Jiangbei."

The two of them were both Daoist Masters, so they understood the situation without needing every detail. Ning Wan remarked, "Everyone is certainly showing their true colors!"

Tinglan said, "After all the trouble your family has gone through, the lands of the three Secret Diffusion families at Baijiang Creek are indeed a suitable place for the True Monarch to build his power. What is the situation now?"

The 'three Secret Diffusion families' she mentioned were the Li family's Funan, the Capital immortals's Midong, and the sole survivor, the Brahma Cloud Cave. These were key areas under close watch, so of course she was informed. Li Jiangqian replied, "Since my family's dispute with the Capital immortals Dao began, the lands of those three families have descended into chaos. The great clans are still exercising some restraint, but people from the Eastern Sea and Southern Sea have stepped forward. A Daoist Huang and a Daoist Bai have both brought men, ostensibly to gather qi in Jiangbei, but in reality, they're using this opportunity to search for and seize spiritual items everywhere, making a fortune."

"On another note, I've also heard they are searching for a token... related to the Secret Diffusion orthodoxy."

He answered cautiously, but Tinglan just smiled. "That token you speak of... it does exist."

'It does exist.' How could Li Jiangqian not know whether it existed or not?

At a gesture from Tinglan, a woman in a purple robe approached, carrying a jade tray. She walked to Li Jiangqian and bowed slightly, allowing the black-robed man to see the object on the tray.

It was a token with a black base and intricate gold patterns, depicting ephemeral clouds and bowing malevolent spirits.

The token gleamed with a pure light, looking exceptionally precious. It was difficult to discern its material or grade, and faint wisps of black wind and white qi drifted over its surface. Li Jiangqian had seen his share of treasures, but one glance told him this felt like an artifact of the Purple Mansion Realm.

Even more remarkably, though its purpose was unknown, just looking at it conveyed a sense of noble authority that stirred the heart, kindling a desire to possess it.

'So they actually had a Purple Mansion Realm expert forge it... This thing is incredibly realistic. If I didn't know I'd made the whole story up myself, even with it right in front of me, I'd assume it was a secret treasure from some major power, just waiting for the right conditions to reveal its glory. I would never recognize it...'

Tinglan glanced at him. "This is the token," she said softly. "Take a good look, and make sure the Capital immortals Dao recognizes it too."

Li Jiangqian bowed. "I obey!"

He was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator; a single glance was enough to memorize it. As the purple-robed woman carried the jade tray away, Tinglan added casually, "This item has many wondrous uses. It would be quite something if a cultivator from the Eastern Sea were to obtain it."

Tinglan didn't elaborate further for him, instead turning to Ning Wan. "Ning Wan, do you... have any other arrangements for now?"

Ning Wan naturally shook her head. It was better to let Tinglan, who had been in the Purple Mansion Realm longer, handle the planning. The question was merely a courtesy. "The Snow Wings Gate has been sealed for many years," Ning Wan said softly. "Is there any news of them?"

Cultivating the Cold Qi, Ning Wan was clearly already planning her next steps. Tinglan shook her head. "The Snow Wings Gate has its own history. Since they've sealed their mountain, it would be inappropriate to disturb them."

Having given Ning Wan that reminder, which she accepted, Tinglan pointed out another path. "Now that you have reached the Daoist Master realm, the matter of Hongxue must naturally be handed to you. Wasn't Li Encheng protected back then for the sake of Hongxue's lineage? Now there's Li Quantao. Senior Yuanxiu sent him to guard the Hongxue ruins, but there hasn't been much movement."

"Once the news of your success came out, Senior Yuanxiu, who was also preparing to break through to the Golden realm, hastily recalled Li Quantao. He did it to preserve this path for you."

Ning Wan nodded in surprise. Tinglan continued, "Now that the True Monarchs is observing the mortal world, and the Hongxue ruins are located in the wilderness near Lake Xian, it's the perfect time to uncover the lineage. You can have him try. If he strikes it lucky, you'll gain at least two Purple Mansion Realm legacies, Water Mansion and Cold Qi. It's a worthy gamble."

"I specifically involved you in this matter with that consideration in mind."

Ning Wan was tempted.

Among the many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan, Tinglan was one of the most trustworthy from the Ning family's perspective. Her master, Daoist Master Zipei, and her Martial Uncle, Daoist Master Zimu, were both close friends of Daoist Master Yuansu. Daoist Master Zimu was even still alive, so it was natural for her to offer some assistance.

She replied, "I will dispatch Li Quantao and his son back to their ancestral land to stand guard. I'll also send his son to investigate the matter of the Jiangbei token and try his luck. However, I'm not familiar with the details of this affair, so I must trouble you, Senior."

"Of course." Tinglan nodded slightly. "I'll send Qianli to observe the situation. If anything goes wrong, I can simply extract the two of them. We must protect the descendants of Hongxue."

The more Li Jiangqian listened, the more uneasy he felt. For Daoist Master Tinglan to bring this up here and now made her intentions obvious. Sure enough, the Daoist Master looked over with a smile and instructed, "This is not to be known by others."

How could Li Jiangqian not understand that this was directed at him? He bowed. "This subordinate understands."

The Moongaze Li Clan had a good relationship with Li Quantao. If Li Quantao were to come to Lake Xian, he might contact the Li family, learn about the situation in the north, and grow suspicious of the Ning Clan. While this wouldn't endanger Li Quantao's life—and might even benefit him—it was best for him to remain ignorant if they were to claim the Hongxue legacy.

With the matter settled, the two Daoist Masters departed for the Great Void, leaving only a letter from Li Ximing stating that the family had put Li Jiangqian and the other in charge.

Li Jiangqian respectfully saw the two of them off until they disappeared, then turned to Li Xuanxuan. The old man was stroking his beard, his brow furrowed in a deep frown.

Li Xuanxuan had surely understood the Daoist Masters' intentions. He held a great deal of affection for Li Quantao. He stood and said, "Think carefully before you act... Quantao once saved Zhi'er... Although... he is powerless in this matter. It would be better if Ximing were here; he could have a say. But he isn't, and we have no right to interfere."

Li Jiangqian replied, "You worry too much, my lord. The fact that the two Daoist Masters informed our family specifically shows they've considered Li Quantao's Wei-Li bloodline. But he is also a cultivator of the Azure Pond. With these two identities, the Ning family's reward will not be small. This is his good fortune."

Li Xuanxuan couldn't tell if Li Jiangqian was speaking this way because he suspected Ning Wan hadn't truly left, or if he genuinely believed it. He simply nodded and withdrew. Li Jiangqian, however, sank into thought. He summoned the Immortal Mirror in his mind, and only after confirming no one was in the Great Void did he dare to let his thoughts run free.

'With the Talisman Seed on me, Ning Wan's Serene Listen shouldn't be triggered even if I harbor malicious thoughts. But if she were to focus on listening... what might she hear?'

He pondered this for a long time, troubled. Just then, Li Minggong entered the hall, also with a frown. Clearly, she had learned of the messes her father, Li Xixuan, had made while she was in secluded cultivation to heal.

Seeing Li Jiangqian, Li Minggong asked about the visit from the Daoist Masters, then said softly, "I just received a report. The Daoist from Mount Jingyi has come out of seclusion. He read the letter we gave his mountain and wishes to see me. I told him to come here so we can question him together."

Li Jiangqian had his own questions. This Shouding had finally emerged. He quickly nodded and asked for him to be brought in.

A Daoist with narrow eyes soon appeared before them. His face was no longer as gaunt as when he was injured, but it was still pale. He bowed upon seeing them. "Thank you for the grace of the Moon-Gazing clan's shelter! Shouding will surely repay you upon my return!"

"There is no need for repayment." Li Minggong was polite enough, but after that one sentence, she fell silent in the main seat.

Li Jiangqian let out a small laugh and helped him up. "Years ago, Daoist Master Changxi entrusted Kong Gumo to Mount Jingyi's care. How is he now?" he asked in a low voice. "Daoist Master Changxi's foresight was incredible, managing to preserve that spark... My family was very close with the old Daoist Master. I wonder what instructions he gave your sect... He must have pleaded earnestly, ai!"

His eyes filled with sorrow, and he shook his head, one hand on Shouding's back, his voice thick with emotion. Moved by his tone, Shouding sighed. "Isn't that the truth! So the old Daoist Master explained it to your esteemed clan as well. Preserving that spark was the priority; the mainland was secondary. My mountain would have helped where we could, but then the great war broke out, and we had to let it go."

'Just as I thought...' Li Jiangqian sneered internally. 'So that was Daoist Master Changxi's plan. He told my family Mount Jingyi would help, but was vague about how much! Daoist Master Xuanyi only ever agreed to protect Kong Gumo!'

'And that Sumian, with his hypocritical act, secretly blaming Mount Jingyi time and again. Could that old fox not know? Adding fuel to the fire... I wonder what he was plotting. Wonderful... not a single one of them is any good.'

His expression remained unchanged. Not fully trusting Shouding's side of the story, he probed with a sigh, "For your sect to protect him so steadfastly, you must have a strong relationship with Profound Peak. In the east..."

Before he could finish, Shouding started waving his hands as if he'd seen a plague god. "You misunderstand, Clan Head! My lineage does feel sympathy for the old Daoist Master, but our relationship was never deep. We weren't familiar back then..." He paused, then explained further, "It's not as if our traditions are similar. We had only met briefly. It's just that Yuezhou Island is close to our mountain gate, and we urgently needed a market like that to attract talent and resources... which led to today's situation."

His words screamed, 'Don't you dare associate Profound Peak with us.' Seated above, Li Minggong sighed internally for Kong Gumo. "I see," she said softly. "What are the mountain's instructions? Is there any way my family can assist?"

This was a question about his future plans, and perhaps a polite way of asking him to leave. Shouding immediately became awkward. "The mountain... hopes I can stay on the mainland for a while..."

Shouding said this, then quickly tried to justify himself. "It... it won't trouble your clan. I've already imposed for years. My Daoist Master has some friendship with the Chen Clan. I will head south now, to Tongmo Prefecture."

Just from that, Li Jiangqian could tell the man was a clumsy speaker. He could have simply said he had business with the Chen Clan, but he had to say so much more. Seeing his oblivious expression, Li Jiangqian sighed to himself.

'If you dare go south, the Yuyang Chen Clan won't dare to take you in... Are you trying to scare their Daoist Master into coming out of seclusion? That would just create an awkward situation.'

This was a free favor waiting to be claimed. The Yuyang Chen Clan had a past relationship with the Li family; they had worked together to eliminate Wang Fu during the struggle for the Radiant Sky Stone. Li Jiangqian immediately smelled an opportunity. He smiled. "I see your injuries have not yet healed, Daoist friend. There's no rush. Why don't you let our guest elder examine your condition while I send a letter to the Chen Clan to inquire? Wouldn't that solve everything?"

Shouding was at a loss, but he couldn't refuse Li Jiangqian's enthusiastic offer. He could only nod and go find Sun Bai. Li Minggong looked over, a thoughtful expression on her face, as Li Jiangqian wrote two letters.

One was for Mount Jingyi, stating that Daoist Shouding intended to visit the Chen Clan but was temporarily being hosted by the Li family. The other was for the Chen Clan, with a similar message, saying he "suspected it might be inconvenient, and was thus writing to inquire."

He had them sent out immediately, then turned to Li Minggong with a smile. "It's a favor that costs us nothing. It's always good to be on friendly terms with Purple Mansion Realm powers. This saves the Chen Clan from future resentment, where they might feel our family should have stepped in to prevent an awkward situation for everyone."

The two discussed matters in Jiangbei until late into the night. Suddenly, they noticed the northern sky begin to brighten faintly. A pillar of intertwined black and white light shot towards the heavens, its presence immense.

Though it was too far to discern any specific aura, the intertwining black and white colors were identical to those on the token. It took no thought to realize a treasure had appeared.

'A Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master is truly different. So efficient!'

Li Jiangqian strode out of the hall, gazing north for a moment. He tilted his head as if listening, then pulled his black outer robe tighter and chuckled. "Men!" he commanded. "Prepare fine gifts! We're going to meet this 'Successor of Secret Diffusion'!"

Qu Bushi quickly appeared from the side, carrying a jade tray laden with several spiritual items. He followed closely at Li Jiangqian's side, a chill in his heart.

'What a disaster... so there really is some heaven-defying token. The overseas world is a storm of blood and gore, where the demonic path runs wild—it truly is vicious... And this mainland... though it looks bright on the surface, it's just as stained with filth...'
