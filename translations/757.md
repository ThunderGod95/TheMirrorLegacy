# Chapter 757: One Glyph, One Register

Li Ximing traversed the Great Void. Gloomy, purple-black vapor hung heavy in the air as he raced forward. Ahead, the massive peak of condensed white qi materialized once more. Yehui was perched atop the same scaled, bird-like beast, its massive beak a glaring gold, its pupils a milky white.

From the beast's back, Yehui glanced at Li Ximing, divine power gathering in his hands.

"Daoist Master Zhaojing," he began, "your willingness to take that step back, abandon the Profound Peak mountain gate, and sacrifice Kong Haiying proves you are truly a reasonable man. Yehui acknowledges this favor, and I thank you for it."

Li Ximing watched him, his gaze heavy. The smile on the man's face was polite. When facing Li Ximing, Yehui never resorted to the cold mockery or scathing ridicule he had used against Changxi. Even now, initiating a battle of divine abilities, he maintained an air of civility.

His attitude projected a distinct detachment—whatever the subordinates below did was their own affair. Your chariot takes my cannon; I checkmate your general. It was merely moves on a chessboard. To hold a grudge over it only proved one lacked magnanimity.

It was this attitude, combined with Li Ximing's own caution, that had preserved a sliver of diplomatic room between their two factions at the Purple Mansion level. Now, isolated in the Great Void, Yehui was actually offering thanks.

Li Ximing could only reply, "What is Daoist Friend saying? Since you intended to move on the Profound Peak mountain gate, I was bound to intervene."

Yehui gave him a deep look, seeming to weigh his options. "Then very well," he replied. "Today, I shall properly test the might of your Bright Yang divine ability."

The instant his voice fell, a violent fluctuation tore through the Great Void.

A vast deluge of purple water descended, filled with leaping, human-headed fish. The peak of white qi surged again, its snowy summit piercing the gloom.

Radiance immediately erupted from Li Ximing's back. Dazzling celestial light surged upward, staining the void as the 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' manifested once more. The intricate, bright-white celestial gate rose from the void, dragon banners and luan chariots passing through it, jeweled standards and ceremonial parasols fluttering in an unseen wind as figures in golden armor and robes appeared.

A cacophony of war cries erupted. Golden-armored soldiers charged forth from the gate while the human-headed fish swam through the purple water. As the brilliance of their divine abilities clashed, the white mountain peak slammed down, pressing heavily onto the Celestial Gate. Li Ximing felt the pressure instantly double, his own divine ability shuddering violently.

The human-headed fish, unlike their previous encounter where they scattered on impact, now stubbornly blocked the charge of the golden-armored soldiers, forcing them back inch by inch. The white qi mountain peak was no longer static; it began to swell, inflating as if breathing.

Previously, Yehui had been cautious, uncertain of his opponent's capabilities. Now, having committed to the duel, he unleashed his power without reservation. The purple tide swelled, the colors growing several times richer, forcing Li Ximing's celestial light into a desperate, three-zhang sphere, unable to advance another inch.

Only now did Li Ximing realize that Yehui had been toying with him before. This was his true strength. His own cultivation gains over the past two years had produced negligible improvements to the 'Audience with the Celestial Gate,' and he was rapidly forced onto the defensive. He had no choice but to ignite the celestial light at his brow, pushing his divine ability to its limit just to resist the 'Sorrowful Southern Water.'

Yet, the purple tide parted, revealing Yehui floating within. The Daoist Master wore deep blue robes, his features compact, and he cradled the same softly glowing sword. Behind him, however, a pair of treasures had appeared.

To his left floated a flat, palm-sized jade disc, intricately carved like a profound glyph. To his right hung a long, wide register, its black surface etched with flowing white script. Both items pulsed with a brilliant light.

Yehui formed a hand seal and chanted, "By this decree, the wind stills, the waters cease; the Dharma manifests the Primordial."

The glyph and the register vanished. A profound chill shot through Li Ximing. He took a step back as violet flames erupted beneath his feet, celestial light bearing down from above.

'He obtained the Douxuan lineage!' Li Ximing thought, alarmed. 'He truly possesses spiritual artifacts!'

He had barely manifested his flames when a vibration shook his mind. The flat jade glyph appeared, *clanging* as his celestial light instinctively tried to suppress it. The glyph locked onto his face, and a devastating volley of lightning rained down.

The lightning was silver-white and utterly ferocious, blasting his protective violet flames into chaotic waves. Li Ximing fought the urge to summon the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. Instead, he formed a rapid seal, projecting a ray of Bright Yang light from his hand to intercept the lightning.

But the moment he committed to the seal, the long, black-and-white profound register leaped into existence on his other flank. A discordant sound blurred the air, and a torrent of crimson True Fire, fierce and agile as a falcon, sprayed toward him.

Li Ximing was already strained just blocking the lightning; how could he possibly fend off the fire? Furthermore, his 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' was completely pinned by Yehui's two divine abilities, leaving it immobile.

He gritted his teeth. His own Bright Yang nature meant that enduring intense flame, while agonizing, was preferable to taking a direct hit from that destructive lightning. He had to prioritize. He focused his defense on the lightning while the celestial light at his brow flared again, projecting a beam of white 'Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light' to counter the True Fire.

As expected, his hastily cultivated Hidden Light was no match for a dedicated spirit artifact. Although the beam split the fiery torrent and slightly diminished its power, a devastating amount of True Fire still rained down.

This was his Purple Mansion Dharma Body, not mortal flesh. Even so, the impact was excruciating. The searing True Fire split like boiling water, flowing over his Dharma Body as white steam hissed from every point of contact.

Li Ximing took the hit, his entire form blazing, his Dharma Body shimmering with a glazed, ceramic hue under the flames. This was no ordinary lightning, no common flame; it couldn't be extinguished by simple suppression. It was fire from a spiritual artifact, uncontrollable by his own Talisman Qi.

Worse, Yehui had already raised his Dharma sword, the tip aimed directly at Li Ximing's face, and had begun chanting another spell.

Li Ximing no longer cared what nonsense the man was mumbling. He only saw a yellow light flash before him, making his eyes sting, as multiple halos of light—one layered upon the next—began to manifest in the west. Whatever it was, it did not look easy to handle.

'This old fox is getting serious!'

Before Yehui could finish casting, Li Ximing forcibly burned his own vital energy. The 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' behind him erupted in a final, dazzling flare of violet flames, momentarily throwing back all the suppressing forces. In that single instant, Li Ximing’s figure vanished.

The purple water calmed. The white qi mountain struck empty space. The radiant light that had defied the void disappeared. The halos behind Yehui slowly dimmed. He sighed softly and gave chase through the Great Void.

Li Ximing reappeared a vast distance away, his body still wreathed in stubborn flames. Fortunately, his Bright Yang nature excelled at handling fire, and this True Fire wasn't the dreaded Merging Fire, which grew stronger as it burned. Extinguishing it wasn't his immediate priority. He fled onward, his mind racing.

'Yehui truly intends to fight. This is likely a demonstration of force... but if he sees an opportunity to inflict a serious injury, I doubt he'll pass it up!'

Those two artifacts had genuinely startled him. Now, Yehui pursued him from the west, the sensations of lightning and fire already beginning to manifest on his body again. Li Ximing was forced to continue fleeing east.

But Yehui’s speed in the Great Void was greater than his own—significantly faster than before. The 'Sorrowful Southern Water' surged beneath his feet, the purple water reflecting his burning silhouette. Li Ximing cursed inwardly and hesitated for a fraction of a second.

He was already far from Profound Peak territory. His options for sanctuary were few: the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate, the Xuanmiao Temple, the Xiukui Monastery, or fleeing all the way to the Eastern Sea. The Sword Gate and Xiukui were neutral observers; dragging a fight into their territory, especially one that required traversing the mortal world, would surely antagonize them.

That left the Xuanmiao Temple. Li Ximing didn't hesitate. He banked his light, altering his trajectory directly toward their territory.

'Going to Xuanmiao at least gives me a path of retreat,' he calculated. 'If Yehui really tries to kill me, Sumian is still there. And if Sumian refuses to intervene, I’ll drop directly into the mortal world. The Xuanmiao Temple is in Jiangbei. How dare Yehui continue a fight there?'

Dropping into Jiangbei was a desperate, last-ditch maneuver. First, while the region’s cultivators would undoubtedly intervene to stop the fight, alarming every Purple Mansion expert in both Jiangnan and Jiangbei was a disastrous way to maintain relationships. Second, this entire affair touched upon the True Monarch's grand design; it was nothing to be trifled with.

He raced onward, alternating between the Great Void and the mortal realm to shake his pursuer. He had just crossed the Snow Wings Gate's territory, his body taking several more licks of flame, when Yehui’s calm voice echoed from behind:

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing! A duel is a duel. Fleeing to Jiangbei is simply tasteless."

'How the hell do I know if you're dueling or trying to murder me!' Li Ximing retorted in his mind.

But just as he formulated the thought, the very fabric of the Great Void ahead of him changed. It twisted, becoming steep and treacherous. Snow began to fall. In the distance, an impossibly vast wind, heavy with frost, roared toward him.

The wind drew near. It was a pale, sickly green, yet it cast a gloomy, gray pall over everything, dimming the celestial light beneath his feet. Snow immediately accumulated, rising half a finger deep on his shoulders. Li Ximing's expression turned cold.

This wind felt familiar. He had seen arts derived from this lineage before—the 'Deep Abyss' aspect of the Chongming Profound Insight Screen came from this exact path.

'A divine ability from the Great Wind of the Deep Abyss lineage!'

He stopped short, realization striking him like a bolt of ice.

'The Capital Guard divine ability: "Western Heaven Plateau"!'

The Western Heaven Plateau—the legendary, desolate expanse west of Long and Shu, the very birthplace of the Great Wind. It was a place of absolute desolation, where spiritual qi was severed and the Great Void itself could not be crossed.

The moment the divine ability manifested, Li Ximing’s speed plummeted. The void beneath him warped under the ability's influence, becoming treacherous and rugged. Simultaneously, Yehui spat a plume of white qi as his 'Eastern Feather Mountain' divine ability activated. The white qi seemed to weigh thousands of tons, and the entire stretch of the Great Void around Li Ximing began to solidify.

'Western Heaven Plateau' and 'Eastern Feather Mountain' stacked upon each other. Their combined control over the Great Void instantly reached an apocalyptic new level. Li Ximing was horrified, a dark suspicion blooming in his mind.

'Does Yehui intend to kill me?!' he realized. 'The Capital Guard path... all three of its major divine abilities are lethal... Why have I never heard him use "Western Heaven Plateau" before!'

In the lightning-fast instant he processed the thought, the white qi descended and the void froze, nearly severing his connection to the mortal world. He was trapped. Li Ximing had no choice but to halt and manifest the 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' once more.

'Eastern Feather Mountain' was not unfamiliar, nor was it overwhelmingly strong on its own; Li Ximing's own Celestial Gate could achieve a similar void-lock. Yehui had used it in their very first confrontation, and Li Ximing had broken the lock with purple fire to escape.

But that was then. Now, the glyph and the register hovered menacingly nearby. Lightning and True Fire were already descending. The white qi mountain peak was crashing down, and the 'Sorrowful Southern Water' surged from below. With his purple flames occupied, how could he possibly counter everything?

Li Ximing saw only two choices. He could use his purple flames to fight the lightning and fire, and the Celestial Gate to hold back the mountain and water, effectively trapping himself here to wait for an opening. Or, he could tank the artifacts' attacks directly and use his purple flames to blast open the void lock and flee to the mortal world.

'The mortal world below is the Snow Wings Gate's territory,' he analyzed frantically. 'Yehui will chase. I'll still have to cross Lake Xian. If I'm injured, my speed will be even slower. Taking the damage doesn't even guarantee my escape...'

'Use the Mountain-Chasing Tiger? With divine abilities pressing me from every side and a sword at my neck, the Tiger can't teleport me instantly. I'd just be wasting its defensive charge for nothing.'

In that split second, the 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' roared to life, rising to meet the white mountain and purple water. The purple flames in his mouth clashed with the descending lightning. Once again, Li Ximing used his Hidden Light and his own Dharma Body to endure the True Fire.

The sound of sizzling crackled through the void. This time, the True Fire scorched his Dharma Body far more severely. Though the glazed hue remained, faint but undeniable scorch marks now marred its surface.

Li Ximing suddenly threw up a hand. The recently learned 'Sun's Resonant Radiance Art' activated, swatting the black-and-white register away, while his other hand blurred into a different seal.

'Should I use it?'

He knew the 'Geng Tiger Dao' aspect of his divine ability could get him out of the lockdown. However, the Geng Tiger Dao excelled at stealth, concealment, and bypassing seals; it did nothing to augment his escape velocity or aid in traversing the void. Speed was not its strength.

Most critically, the True Fire still burning on his body made him as conspicuous as a lantern. He was too close to Yehui; he wouldn't get far. It would be a complete waste of the ability.

He committed. Divine ability blocked mountain and water. Purple flames blocked lightning. The Resonant Parting Art and Hidden Light blocked the True Fire. With no capacity left to counter Yehui's chanting, Li Ximing slapped his storage bag.

A stone box flew out. This was the container Li Zhouwei had brought back, filled to the brim with Serpent Origin Spirit Water. It was the largest supply of high-grade spirit water the Li family possessed. In this crisis, it was the only water he had in sufficient quantity. There was no time to worry about the waste.

Fortunately, Yehui seemed unaware that Li Ximing needed to extinguish the fire to utilize a stealth escape; the Daoist Master was only chanting faster.

Li Ximing slammed his palm onto the stone box. A sheet of crystal-clear spirit water burst forth, dousing his Dharma Body as he pushed his other abilities to their absolute limit.

*Pssssssht!*

The stubborn artifact-flames flickered wildly, sputtered, and finally, reluctantly, extinguished.

Before Li Ximing could feel a whisper of relief, a hazy yellow brilliance manifested behind Yehui. The Daoist Master completed his chant:

"Profound Light of the Three Xu Abandoning Purity... Go!"

Having just doused the fire, Li Ximing wasn't waiting around for the attack to land. Yehui had barely spat out the first word of the ability's name when Li Ximing sacrificed a white pearl, engraved with a tiger looking over its shoulder, from his Shengyang Acupoint.

Rainbow light flashed. In an instant, the pearl transformed into a spirit tiger that looked carved from gray-black stone, its eyes glittering with uncanny intelligence.

Li Ximing mounted the tiger. Immediately, the brownish-yellow 'Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen' shimmered into existence, wrapping around him like silken threads. He slammed his divine ability against the enclosing water and mountain, felt the void-lock shudder and loosen, and instantly tore through the opening, vanishing into the Great Void.

The 'Profound Light of the Three Xu Abandoning Purity' flashed and dissipated into the empty space he had just occupied.

Yehui was left standing alone, sword in hand, the purple river flowing quietly at his feet. He let out a long breath, clearly having expended significant energy. He made no move to chase. He simply stood motionless, allowing his divine abilities to recede.

As the white mountain and purple water faded away, Yehui stared into the vast emptiness where Li Ximing had vanished, a look of hesitation on his face. After a long moment, he composed himself, stepped back onto his flow of purple water, and departed.
