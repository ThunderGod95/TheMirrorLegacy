# Chapter 1081: Children

After seeing Li Ximing off, Kuang Yu rode the wind back to Mount Qusi. Xuanyi and the others were long gone, leaving the pavilion in silence.

Kuang Yu headed deeper into the mountain on her own, only to find a woman in red robes blocking her path. The woman bowed respectfully.

"Miss, the Master wishes to see you."

Surprised, Kuang Yu paused and nodded slightly. She followed the path to the front of the Hall of the Three Yangs Suppressing Dawn. Billowing clouds of Dawn Qi swirled across the golden platform. As she ascended the steps, she saw the main throne area was brightly lit, contrasting sharply with her master, who sat shrouded in deep, dark red.

She walked forward, ascended the platform, and bowed deeply.

"Master!"

Diyan's expression was no longer as grave as before; a hint of liveliness had returned to his features. He sat casually on the throne, holding a wine goblet.

"What did he say?" he asked in a low voice.

Kuang Yu replied, "He spoke of the Precious Tusk Golden Land."

Diyan took a sip of wine.

"I am insistent on pursuing the Dao. Do you resent me for it?"

Kuang Yu bowed her head.

"I wouldn't dare... This junior only wishes to support the Master's pursuit. I am merely worried about Mount Qusi, and... I worry..."

Her expression was complicated.

"If we get involved too deeply, if we anger this power or that, will the fallout not strike Mount Qusi?"

Diyan took another sip.

"There's no need to worry. Patriarch Qujie is, after all, a disciple of Motongse Palace. The beings 'up there' see these things... differently."

Kuang Yu looked up, confused. Diyan continued,

"The subtlety of this affair lies here: In the eyes of King Wei, we are helping him. But in the eyes of Luoxia, are we not also helping them? Even the Dragon-kin will see it as us lending a hand!"

"Though that great personage hasn't appeared in ages, this action aligns perfectly with his stance and interests. Whether he directly ordered it or not, the other great powers will assume it was his move. Why would they vent their anger on us?"

Kuang Yu was silent for a moment before asking,

"So this was your calculation all along, Master."

Diyan merely looked at her with a faint, unreadable smile and sipped his wine.

'My calculation? That's not necessarily so!'

Kuang Yu stood up to leave. Diyan hesitated for a moment, then finally took a jade talisman from his sleeve. It was about three fingers wide, black as its base, and inscribed with patterns of gold and red.

Kuang Yu took the talisman from his hand and examined it. Her expression immediately grew wary. She looked up at her master as Diyan spoke in a level tone,

"Years ago, I had you practice Cultivation Transcendence. My thinking was that a chaotic era of displacement was coming. The path of 'Cultivation Transcendence' is not only skilled at self-preservation, but it allows one to ride the tides of the era, offering a chance to achieve great Dao-Profundity."

"Now that you are deeply involved in the Bright Yang's machinations, your Cultivation Transcendence Dao can borrow a measure of its power."

Kuang Yu's face paled slightly.

"This junior has never considered the Quest for Gold!"

Diyan shook his head.

"I am not asking you to undertake the Quest for Gold, merely to borrow its power to cultivate your divine abilities. Your path requires 'transgression,' and I fear you'll hardly find an act more transgressive than killing the Emperor."

Kuang Yu looked lost.

"This junior is confused... Master, you already have my younger cousin cultivating Cultivation Transcendence. Isn't he a more suitable candidate? I am the inheritor of Mount Qusi's legacy..."

Diyan paused, his cup halfway to his lips, a flicker of pain in his eyes. He sighed after a long moment.

"This... this was supposed to be your father's task. His age was perfect... If he had lived, his cultivation would also be at the perfect stage. He would have assisted King Wei in this great transgression, and regardless of success or failure, he would have had a chance to contend for an Auxiliary Position... If he were here, I would never, ever let you touch this."

He shut his eyes tightly.

"Hateful... to be killed by... Can Lufu!"

At the mention of her father, Kuang Yu's expression flickered and fell. Diyan continued in a somber voice,

"He is gone. No one dares to bear the karma of this Bright Yang transgression alone. That leaves only you... and your cousin, to share the burden. With your combined aptitude, you might have hope of passing the Purple Mystery. If one of you manages to claim the greater share, you might even... touch upon reincarnation."

"This is why I instructed you to get close to Li Ximing, not to King Wei. The King is Juexi's domain. Juexi serves him openly as a courtier; you forge a bond in the shadows. By leveraging Juexi, you can take on a greater share of the karmic ties. Without him, it would be very difficult for you to claim any significant part."

Kuang Yu nodded thoughtfully. Diyan continued, his voice heavy with meaning, 

"This is also why I absolutely had to speak with him today, why he had to meet Juexi, and why he had to agree on King Wei's behalf first. Juexi's talent is high, but breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm is still fraught with peril. By letting him be 'stained' by the status of this Bright Yang transgression, he will have a much greater certainty of achieving his divine ability!"

Comprehension dawned on Kuang Yu's face, and she sighed deeply.

"Master, your planning has been truly painstaking..."

"And... there is the matter of avenging your father, but it is still too soon..." Diyan shook his head, cutting her off. He gently closed her fingers over the jade talisman she had been holding uncertainly.

"I can only arrange this much for you. How you walk your future path... whether you do this or not... is entirely up to you."

Perhaps it was merely the deep red light of the hall, but Kuang Yu's face seemed flushed. She bowed silently and retreated, leaving Diyan alone on the throne.

All expression vanished from his face. His gaze, following her retreating figure, held a profound loneliness. This Great Daoist Master, his divine abilities perfected, seemed like a caged bird, trapped within the small confines of the hall. He narrowed his eyes, watching silently as Kuang Yu disappeared.

'Diyan...'

Li Ximing streaked across the sky, flying over the Southern Sea, his mind still heavy with thought.

He knew a great deal now; Li Zhouwei consulted with him on nearly everything he knew. But as the major powers emerged one by one, testing the waters again and again... Li Ximing was struck by a powerful sense of absurdity.

'This entire Bright Yang affair... it's become a gamble!'

'It's a gamble with the 'shaking of the Bright Yang' as the minimum payout, the 'fate of the White Qilin' as the bonus, and the 'ascension of a new Bright Yang Monarch' as the grand prize. The great powers are all placing their bets, and people like Changxiao, Diyan, and even Yuandao are continuously raising the stakes, not hesitating to wager their fortunes and their very lives.'

'They keep betting more and more. It's as if the entire world is being pushed forward... with no chance to turn back.'

His expression was calm as he flew westward. After an unknown amount of time, the myriad pavilions of the coastline finally emerged on the horizon.

The Protectorate of the Tranquil Sea had originally been Daoist Master Zhusheng's territory. It contained the Shahuan Kingdom, whose people were mostly of Jiaozhi descent. The kingdom had since been dissolved and its lands divided into prefectures, all administered by Great Song officials.

When Li Ximing returned on his beam of light, the mountain was surprisingly bustling. A group of cultivators was kneeling in the main hall, not daring to move. Cheng Qian, dressed in white, sat on the main seat with a severe expression, terrifying the cultivators into holding their breath.

As Li Ximing's Heavenly Light appeared, Cheng Qian's expression finally softened.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

He moved to welcome Li Ximing while waving his sleeve at the others.

"Go and investigate again!"

The cultivators scattered as if granted amnesty. Seeing Cheng Qian's grave expression, Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"What's happened?"

Cheng Qian flicked his sleeve and sighed. "After I arrived, I visited several of the Shaman Kingdoms and began to deal with the demonic disturbance. But the more I investigate, the less simple it seems. Behind the turmoil in the Shaman Kingdoms... there must be a Demon King."

Li Ximing's eyes narrowed.

"Which Demon King?"

Cheng Qian sighed.

"More than one!"

He looked troubled as he explained, "The Shaman Kingdoms are wedged between two powers. One is the territory of the Bifeng Mountain Lord, bordered by the Black Lacquer Ridge. The other is the territory of another mountain lord, named Mountain Lord Yuandun, bordered by Favorable Ridge Peak. He has shown goodwill to Jinghai in the past."

"This Bifeng Mountain Lord is infamous. I presume you know of him, Daoist Friend? His name is Can Lufu..."

Although Cheng Qian was intelligent, he was an overseas cultivator and unfamiliar with the affairs of Jiangnan. He had no idea what the Li Clan's past entailed, or what enemies they had made. He spoke quite naturally.

Li Ximing's expression remained neutral, but his heart turned to ice.

'Still running free... Enjoy your freedom for a few more decades. It won't last.'

Before his breakthrough, Li Ximing and the entire Li Clan were nothing but dust in Can Lufu's eyes. Even after he broke through, the clan was still negligible. But things were different now. If the Li Clan went all out and called in their allies, they could certainly cause the Demon King significant trouble, though it was still far from enough to kill him.

Cheng Qian continued, "This Can Lufu is a notoriously old demon, with profound methods and high Dao-Profundity. Mountain Lord Yuandun on the other side is only at the mid-Purple Mansion Realm. He's only managed to contend with Can Lufu by banding together with several other nearby Demon Kings."

"Your clan's general has been seizing Can Lufu's territory. Now... the old demon is using this as an excuse, 'cutting from the north to patch the east,' so to speak. The two sides are fighting fiercely, allowing him to plunder the populace and, conveniently, suppress Mountain Lord Yuandun at the same time."

Having achieved the Purple Mansion Realm not long ago and spending most of his time in the Eastern Sea, this situation was a natural headache for Cheng Qian. Li Ximing exhaled slowly, considering.

"Have any Purple Mansion Realm experts made a move?"

Cheng Qian's expression darkened.

"That's precisely the problem. The Bifeng Mountain Lord has dispatched two Purple Mansion Realm Demon Kings, and they've been stirring up trouble repeatedly. There are tremors in the earth veins, calls for aid... Once the fighting escalates, we will likely have to assist Mountain Lord Yuandun."

Li Ximing mused, "I seem to recall... Daoist Master Zhusheng had a friend among the demon-kin here... someone called Daoist Master Xian Chan."

"He serves under Mountain Lord Yuandun!"

Li Ximing already loathed Can Lufu, so he was instantly inclined to take sides. However, his desire for true vengeance was greater, and he was wary of alerting his enemy prematurely. Furthermore, if he was to act, he preferred to do so under the banner of the Song Court.

"We should support Mountain Lord Yuandun," he said. "It's a matter of balancing the Southern Borderlands. But we can no longer act independently as we once did. We must report this to the Emperor first. Even if no troops are dispatched, having one or two Spiritual Artifacts allocated to us would be for the best."

Cheng Qian immediately saw the logic.

"Senior, your foresight is thorough!"

Li Ximing simply picked up a brush, infusing his divine ability into the scroll as he carefully worded his report to Yang Zhuo. All the while, he was coldly calculating.

'This has more than one purpose. The matter of the Azure Talisman is still unresolved. If I can get a clear grasp of the situation here, find an opening, and eliminate one of the Demon Kings allied with Can Lufu, I can secure a strand of Talisman Qi for Jiangqian!'

At this thought, he felt quite satisfied and even felt a bit more favorable toward Yang Ruiyi.

'No matter how I influence the situation in the Southern Borderlands, as long as I act under the identity of the Great Song, there won't be any major trouble. Compared to the north, this place is far more comfortable. I don't have to face the northern Buddhist cultivators, and I might even be able to earn some spiritual resources and favors...'

Simin Prefecture.

Simin had been the foundation of the Azure Pond, but its immortal halls and pavilions were all located on the mountain. The prefecture below, prosperous and grand, was ultimately a mortal domain. However, after the Great Song was founded, it was established as the Imperial Capital. Gathering the heroes of the former Yue State, they instituted new systems and erected grand palaces, transforming the city into a scene of splendor.

Hidden amidst the dense layers of city buildings, the main gates of a vast but low-key residence were tightly shut. The inner chambers were just as quiet. A group of servants stood pressed against the walls, not daring to look up. The only sound was the light, clear ringing of a small bell.

A woman in white sat sideways by the bed, her pale, slender fingers gently turning a small bell, causing it to jingle softly. On the bed, a baby boy, no more than a year old, watched with rapt attention, his pair of golden eyes locked onto the bell.

A baby girl, even smaller and more delicate, lay sleeping with her back to them, snuggled against her mother.

While the woman entertained the boy, a powerfully built man beside them was trying on a set of black robes. A ceremonial sash of purple and gold was tied at his waist, giving him an imposing air.

Li Jiangxia held up a bronze mirror, gazing at his own golden eyes within it. He suddenly recalled something and asked,

"Has Daoist Master Zhaojing gone to the Southern Borderlands?"

The woman immediately set the bell down.

"Yes," she said softly.

Li Jiangxia raised a hand and shook his head.

"If he hasn't returned to the lake, he is likely unaware of Yuzhi and Suichu being born. Send someone to Jinghai to inform him."

The woman agreed softly, but she seemed hesitant, as if wanting to say something difficult. Li Jiangxia waved the nearby servants away. She then spoke, "This lowly one was blessed with great fortune to bear children for the General... But I have heard that Ting Province has... naming conventions based on generation. I fear that 'Yuzhi' and 'Suichu' do not follow the rules."

Her expression was anxious.

"I am not afraid of gossip, but I worry the two children... will not be favored by King Wei."

Li Jiangxia laughed and shook his head as he pulled on his spiritual boots. 

"You needn't worry about that. My own name, 'Xia,' is not part of the convention either. My father, the King, gave it to me."

He turned his head, a thoughtful look on his face.

"I understand his intentions now, so I'm not concerned with such rules. I am not like Li Jianglong, who had to shamelessly beg for his son's name. This is fine. As for you... you bore me twins. Who would dare to give you trouble?"

Although Li Jiangxia had many concubines, he had remained without an heir for many years. When he finally arrived at the Song Court and went to war wielding the Holder of the Profound, he had given up on the idea, focusing entirely on his cultivation.

The Song Emperor valued him highly, bestowing upon him not only spiritual resources and treasures, but also six women to serve him. All of them cultivated the Veiled Yin. The intent was not for him to bear children, but purely to allow him to engage in dual cultivation, harmonize his yin and yang, and advance his cultivation base.

But perhaps it was because he had left Moongaze Lake—dominated by the Bright Yang and the suppression of his father and brothers—that his own fate had flourished. Or perhaps the Dao of Veiled Yin was truly effective. In any case, one of the six women, a woman from the Mushroom Forest Plains named Zou Xie, had unexpectedly become pregnant.

Li Jiangxia was overjoyed, but an even greater surprise followed: Zou Xie bore him twins—a son and a daughter!

'Could it be that my fate has truly unfurled?'

He was elated. Now a father, he doted on his two children, and he brought Zou Xie with him everywhere. Now, returning to the Imperial Capital to report on his duties, he had brought the mother and children back with him.

He lovingly stroked his two children's heads and said softly, "The Emperor has summoned me. I must make a trip to the palace."
