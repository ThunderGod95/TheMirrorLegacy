# Chapter 683: Abandoned Pawns in the Formation

The waves of the Sea of Reefs churned as a great ship materialized in the sky. At its bow stood a young man in black robes, his hands tucked into his sleeves. In the center of the deck was an old man with white hair and sharp, high-arched eyebrows that gave him a ferocious look. He was draped in gold and jade, his body shimmering with the light of powerful artifacts—the very image of a direct descendant of the Chi family.

Six Guest Elders stood in two rows on either side of him. All were clad in resplendent spirit armor, their hands gripping weapons that vied for brilliance—axes, blades, spears, and staves. None of them were below the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm.

'Such a grand display,' Li Yuanqin thought. 'All this for Li Xizhi.'

The old man in the center, Chi Buhua, was advanced in years. Surrounded by the other cultivators, he wore a look of impatience, his eyes constantly scanning the sea below. Finally, his deep voice rumbled, "Why aren't they here yet?"

"Rest assured, Senior," Li Yuanqin said with a casual laugh. "There's more than enough time. The monk Ning Hejing sent is formidable, but Li Xizhi cultivates the Dao of Heavenly Glow. He won't be defeated so easily."

Chi Buhua glanced at the black-robed young man, a hint of satisfaction finally showing on his face. "We misunderstood you before," he nodded. "You have played an invaluable role in this."

Given Chi Buhua's high status, Li Yuanqin simply offered a polite acknowledgment.

Chi Zhihu was reckless, impulsive, and arrogant, often ruining carefully laid plans. While Chi Fubo outwardly respected him as an elder, he secretly held him in contempt. Chi Buhua, however, was Chi Fubo's most capable agent—not only was he cautious and steady, but his cultivation was among the highest in the Chi family, giving him a deep understanding of the situation.

The old man raised an eyebrow and said leisurely, "The Lingu family is tied up with the demon scourge in the Southern Sea, and Si Tongyi was kept on Green Pine Island by Ning Hejing. We have the entire Si family under surveillance. Li Xizhi has well and truly been abandoned."

Chi Fubo was a capable man. Ever since Si Yuanli had entered seclusion, he had kept all the major families under watch. Daring to send Chi Buhua here meant he was ninety percent certain of success, with numerous contingencies in place to keep the Si and Lingu families from interfering.

Even so, Chi Fubo had dispatched six Peak Lords and the profoundly powerful late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, Chi Buhua. The grand formation Chi Zhihu was using also concealed a hidden, devastating power. Even if, by some miracle, Lingu Lanying and Si Tongyi were present, the formation was strong enough to suppress all three of them.

"Zhihu knows nothing of the true plan. By acting as the bait, he earned the Si family's trust. At this point, unless Daoist Master Yuanxiu himself appears, there is no turning back."

Chi Buhua's only fear was that the monk and Chi Zhihu would kill Li Xizhi prematurely, which would be a disgrace. 'The Li family still has many friends among the Purple Mansion cultivators. Killing Li Xizhi would force us to sacrifice many of our own to appease their anger. It's best to capture him alive and force Si Yuanli to back down.'

By now, Chi Buhua was no longer worried that Daoist Master Yuanxiu would actually intervene. 'The Daoist Master must have tacitly approved of this. This is a move against the Li family, a test of some kind. Otherwise, things would never have reached such a passive state for him. Even if he did show up to save Li Xizhi, he would lose immense face. And in the absolute worst-case scenario, if Li Xizhi is saved… we just go home. Is the Daoist Master really going to kill us for it?'

All signs pointed to one conclusion. Ning Hejing's plot was clumsy, and Chi Fubo had only acted because he could turn it to his own advantage. Otherwise, why would he have bothered?

While the old man mulled this over, Li Yuanqin stood by respectfully, his mind a world away.

'Chi Fubo truly wants Chi Zhihu dead.'

Chi Buhua knew only half the story. His esteemed junior was no gentle soul. Chi Fubo had secretly tampered with the formation, making it a one-way trap—easy to enter, impossible to leave. He had also conveniently arranged for the Grand Feather Sword and the Flowing Light Mirror to be sent away.

As for the monk, Liaokong, Chi Fubo was certain he would not act in their best interest.

'Liaokong wants to harm the Li family, which means he needs Li Xizhi to kill Chi Zhihu. Even if Li Xizhi is unwilling, Liaokong will *help* him do it. Only with that crime can he effectively frame Wei Danying and the Li family. Ning Hejing is far too naive.'

With all these factors in play, Chi Fubo was banking on his uncle dying at Li Xizhi's hands.

'If they only fought for a while, no matter how we twisted the story, the worst we could do is have Li Xizhi imprisoned. But if it comes to a matter of life and death, if Chi Zhihu dies at Li Xizhi's hands, then Li Xizhi will have no way to defend himself. That would be enough to demand his life, and that is what will forge him into a sharp blade to pierce the Si family.'

Of all the players in the Chi family, Chi Fubo's thinking was the most ruthless and profound. Though he had never met the monk Liaokong, his grasp of the situation had allowed him to form a tacit alliance of interests.

Li Yuanqin’s thoughts churned, but he remained silent, his arms crossed.

'The Si family was willing to throw the Li family away… What is their true goal?'

His thoughts grew grim. Through the shimmering blue water, he could almost see Si Yuanli's simple, honest face.

'Does the Si family really just want to defeat the Chi family and divide the Azure Pond Sect with the Li and Lingu? I'm afraid not.'

A sudden realization struck him. 'How many Foundation Establishment cultivators does the Si family even have?'

Only two of any note. And how many years did Daoist Master Yuanxiu have left?

'And the Li and Lingu families? How many do they have? Never mind Li Xizhi, the Peak Lord of Changtian Peak. Li Ximing is a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator and a genius alchemist. And Li Zhouwei is the Child of Bright Yang, a talent unseen in a century.'

The young man's expression darkened. 'More importantly, the Li family has been forging connections with Purple Mansion cultivators everywhere. Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong instigated Si Yuanli to move against the Chi family. Does Si Yuanli truly not see their selfish motives? Is Daoist Master Yuanxiu really unaware that he's being used as a weapon?'

'And the Lingu family? Lingu Lanying might not be a genius, but is she weak? They collude with the Xiukui Sword Gate, nurturing bandits in the Southern Sea to make themselves indispensable. They use the grievances of the Jiangnan cultivators to pressure Si Yuanli. Are they not a threat to be feared?'

'Is that the kind of Azure Pond Sect that Si Yuanli wants to rule?'

In Li Yuanqin's mind, the seat of power in the Azure Pond Sect was a throne of thorns. The sharpest belonged to the Li, the most venomous to the Lingu. The Si family had few members, and Daoist Master Yuanxiu was running out of time. If Si Yuanli took that seat, who would usurp him after the Daoist Master’s death? The Li? The Lingu?

His perspective suddenly expanded. Si Yuanli's simple, almost slow-witted face became transparent, and behind it stood the stern, unsmiling figure of the Purple Mansion Daoist Master.

'Chi Fubo, Chi Xunxiao… they are all just scissors, just axes. They wouldn't dare touch the trunk of the Si family, so they are being used to chop away at the poisonous thorns of the Li and Lingu.'

'Once the Li family is weakened and the Lingu family loses its hold on the Southern Sea, the other cultivators will tremble in fear. Then, Si Yuanli, unable to bear it any longer, will emerge from seclusion like a savior, crying out against the Chi family's cruelty to the Peak Lords and their persecution of the great families. He will take their place.'

'Then he can generously restore the two families and console the peaks, and there will be no more threats. By the time the Li and Lingu realize what has happened, even if they harbor suspicions, what could they possibly do?'

His face remained impassive, but his mind was reeling.

'Yes! So that's how it is!'

With that single thought, all of the Si family's bizarre actions suddenly made perfect sense. But his moment of clarity brought no relief, only a bone-deep, bottomless chill.

The thought vanished as quickly as it came. The young man shivered and drew his black robes tighter, an unconscious gesture that made him touch his throat. Chi Buhua was watching him and immediately asked, "What is it?"

'What is it? I'm checking if my head is still attached, of course.'

Li Yuanqin cursed inwardly, half-expecting a talisman to fly out and lop off his head at any moment. Outwardly, he simply smiled and said warmly, "Thank you for your concern, Elder. I just feel a bit of a chill here."

"A chill…" Chi Buhua laughed, the realization dawning on him. "Ah, yes. The Dragon King of the Sea of Reefs cultivates a dao of cold energy. He has turned his undersea domain into a grotto-heaven of ice. It does make the area colder. If you were to fly a little further, you'd even see icebergs."

He turned to the men at his sides with a warm smile. "Look at me, I'd forgotten that Yuanqin is still a Qi Refinement cultivator. We Foundation Establishment cultivators naturally wouldn't feel a thing. My apologies."

Chi Zhihu was in the grand formation, luring Li Xizhi into a trap. They needed to frame Li Xizhi for his murder, and Li Yuanqin's testimony would be essential. Chi Buhua was mindful of this. 'This Li Yuanqin is Li Xizhi's clan uncle, after all. He's an important piece. Although we don't need to fear him recanting his story, it's best to keep him on our side.'

Li Yuanqin deflected with pleasantries. A few moments later, a talisman in Chi Buhua’s hand suddenly lit up, pointing north.

"Found him!"

Overjoyed, Chi Buhua steered the spirit ship in that direction. The sky ahead was empty, but the old man activated an ocular art, his hands forming a seal and pressing against his eyes.

A massive, bright yellow formation became visible, blanketing the sea. "Right ahead!" Chi Buhua declared, his voice filled with delight.

Li Yuanqin watched, his heart sinking. 'This old fossil has lived a long time and accumulated far too much power. Not only does he have a powerful ocular art, but he even knows a special technique to enhance it…'

Such specialized arts were rarely used. That he had mastered one spoke volumes of his profound skill. Though Li Yuanqin's cultivation was low, his insight was not. A single glance was enough to make his stomach tighten. 'It seems Chi Zhihu isn't dead yet. This old man is powerful enough on his own, and he has six other Foundation Establishment cultivators with him. With Liaokong's interference and the power of the formation… things could still go wrong.'

His face remained a placid mask, but anxiety gnawed at him. As the others prepared to leave the ship and enter the formation, Li Yuanqin racked his brain and said in a low voice, "Senior, a moment!"

At such a sensitive time, before Chi Buhua could even speak, a nearby Chi family Guest Elder shot him a sharp, narrowed glare. These men were proud and had only tolerated Li Yuanqin's presence out of respect for Chi Buhua. They weren't about to let him command seven Foundation Establishment cultivators. He opened his mouth to rebuke him, but the old man stopped him.

"What is it, Yuanqin?" Chi Buhua asked, his tone surprisingly patient. Li Yuanqin was useful, and his sharp mind often produced unexpected results. Besides, in his view, delaying their entry was pointless. 'Even if Li Yuanqin has ulterior motives and wants to save his clan nephew, he should have entered the formation sooner. Delaying now will only seal his nephew's fate.'

His tolerance grew. Li Yuanqin adopted a hesitant expression. "Senior, firstly, I am concerned that members of the other two families are still in the area. And secondly… I worry that since Li Xuanfeng visited the Great Ning Palace, Li Xizhi might have a Purple Mansion-grade talisman."

"A Purple Mansion talisman?" Chi Buhua paused. "What of it?"

"I fear he might use the talisman to escape the formation. If we all rush in, he could slip away. With his speed, we would be left helpless." He chose his words carefully. "Capturing him should be effortless for us. Perhaps it would be better to leave one person outside, just in case he uses a Purple Mansion talisman to break through the formation."

Chi Buhua frowned. Such escape talismans were exceedingly rare, capable of traversing the Great Void to pass through formations. The Azure Pond Sect had only a few, all in Daoist Master Yuanxiu's possession, with one held by the Sect Master, Chi Zhiyun, and another that had belonged to the deceased Chi Zhiyan.

'Li Xizhi has such a treasure? He's making a mountain out of a molehill.' The old man grew suspicious and stared at him intently.

Li Yuanqin waited a beat, seeing he had successfully planted the seed of doubt, before adding hesitantly, "Elder… the truth is, this formation can be entered but not exited. I fear if we all go in… we might be walking into a trap!"

A half-hidden truth is always more alluring. As soon as he heard this, the old man froze, his mind reeling. Chi Buhua was old and experienced; it took him only a moment of thought to grasp the implication. "He wants to use Zhihu's life…" he gasped.

He cut himself off, his face hardening. He drew a sharp breath, lifted his chin, and closed his eyes. The weathered bark of his face wrinkled deeply. "Then… we will wait a little longer," he sighed.

He waited. The grand formation fell silent, with only occasional flickers of light, a clear sign that the cultivator inside had dealt with his opponents.

"Alright…" Chi Buhua grit his teeth and exhaled, his face cold as he issued his orders. "You six will stand guard outside. If anything goes wrong once I'm inside, I will crush this jade pendant. Three of you will enter. The remaining three will act based on the pendants of the first three."

"Yes, sir," the six replied in unison.

A flicker of motion crossed Chi Buhua’s old face. He glanced at Li Yuanqin, who stood by respectfully, and a new suspicion entered his grim expression. 'In that case, is it possible this boy is colluding with Li Xizhi, trying to buy him some time?'

'And where is Liaokong? If Zhihu has been dealt with, the monk should be inside, contending with Li Xizhi…'

He stared at the boy, a cruel glint in his eyes. 'This is a perfect chance to test him.'

Chi Buhua suddenly laughed. "As for you, Yuanqin," he shook his head, "why don't you come inside with me? You are Li Xizhi's clan uncle. You can persuade him to surrender without a fight. It will save us all the trouble of coming and going."

Li Yuanqin understood and nodded, clasping his fist. "As you command."

"Good." Chi Buhua roared with laughter, using his spiritual qi to pull the boy to his side. Seeing the youth's calm expression, he felt he had the situation perfectly under control.

'Since Li Xizhi is a member of the Li family, how can he disobey his clan uncle's command? Even if he pretends not to listen, he will have to divert his attention to protect Li Yuanqin. He cannot bear the infamy of killing his own uncle. This gives us another weakness to exploit!'

'And even if he is stone-hearted and they are not colluding, I can simply call in three Guest Elders. One to guard Li Yuanqin, while the other two and I capture Li Xizhi. It will be effortless. And that's not even counting his mortal enemy, Liaokong! Even Li Qinghong would be powerless here, let alone this boy.'
