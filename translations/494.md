# Chapter 737: Father And Son

The two returned to Qingdu, flinging the two cultivators to the ground. First, they sealed the six senses of the white-robed old Daoist, tossing him aside like a rotting log, then removed the restraints on the black-clad cultivator.

The black-clad cultivator immediately turned over and kowtowed, respectfully saying, "Greetings to the two seniors. I am He Yitao, a cultivator from Xu State, cultivating at Mount Bianyan. With the Buddhist cultivators pushing south, we had no place to stand and were forced to cross into Yue State. If we have caused any offense, I am willing to offer full compensation!"

Li Xijun merely waved his hand and asked, "What is the current situation in Xu State?"

The black-clad cultivator quickly replied, "The Buddhist cultivators swept southward, reaching the southern parts of Xu State. The battles centered around Mount Bianyan, and even the great demonic beast Sanjun of the mountain couldn’t stay out of it. His subordinate demonic generals were captured and eaten, and Sanjun himself fled on the wind to Mount Dali, leaving chaos in his wake..."

"Did the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators or Maha intervene?" Li Xijun asked carefully, and the black-clad youth replied, "I haven’t seen them. Only two of The Merciful Ones were overseeing the battle. The Golden Feather Sect and Azure Pond Sect sent a group of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, but there has been no sign of Maha in the north."

Lowering his eyes respectfully, he quietly observed and said, "Across Xu State, landslides and cracks have appeared everywhere, and strange phenomena abound. I’ve heard a giant boulder, two thousand meters tall, fell in the north. The rivers in the east have dried up, and fish and shrimp in the riverbeds are singing... Events like these are countless."

Li Xijun asked another two questions, then continued, "Which Dao of the Buddhist cultivators is leading the charge?"

He Yitao froze, gritted his teeth in thought for a moment, then said, "I’ve only heard of the Way of Compassion and the Dao of Great Desire.., and also the Way of Emptiness. As for which Dao lineage the two Merciful Ones belong to, I am too low in rank to know."

Li Xijun nodded. Beside him, Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard and asked with concern, "Has there been any sign of the Way of Wrath?"

He Yitao paused for a moment, then said uncertainly, "Your Excellency may not know, but the Way of Wrath once reincarnated. Back then, its physical form was cleaved by the Celestial Moon Li Tongya, and its true form was besieged by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Its Dao lineage suffered heavy losses, their inquiries to the law went unanswered. It's rarely seen anymore."

Li Xijun nodded slightly, gave him a glance, then questioned him three more times. He sent a stream of mana into his body and sure enough, the man was a devil cultivator.

Without waiting for him to speak, Li Xijun flipped his hand and tossed him aside, then removed the restraints from the old Daoist. The old man fell to his knees with a thud and said in a trembling voice, "Your Excellency..."

The biting wind and snow around Li Xijun were fierce, but his voice was gentle as he asked, "Old man, where are you from, and why have you come here?"

"I am from Xu State... a rogue cultivator from the Floating Cloud Cave of Mount Xiaoshi..."

He cried sorrowfully, "The five-eyed Merciful One of the Way of Emptiness and several Master Monks descended near Mount Xiaoshi. Sixteen households of us scattered in panic... those who ran slowly slit their own throats... or cut off their limbs, ears, and noses, or leapt off the cliffs...

"I've cultivated for over a hundred years, and only managed to survive by running fast. I escaped from the hands of Master Monk Xu Mu... and ended up in this region."

Li Xijun gripped his sword, frowning as doubts arose in his heart. Before he could speak, the man cried out repeatedly, "Please wait, Your Excellency! Please wait!"

He raised his head slightly, one eye glancing upward to read their expressions. Curling his body inward, he spoke quickly like spilling beads, "My martial uncle has been cultivating by this lake for many years! I came here this time just to seek refuge with him! Please wait, Your Excellency... perhaps we are even allies!"

The old man was well-versed. Upon hearing this, Li Xuanxuan became intrigued and asked, "When was this... and does he have a Dao title?"

Seeing his expression, the old Daoist quickly formed a plan. A flattering smile appeared on his face as he replied, "I am Fu Yuan. My martial uncle's Dao title is Ling Guizi... He broke through the Qi Cultivation Realm about one hundred thirty years ago and came to this lake to seek fortune. I don’t know if he has reached the Foundation Establishment Realm by now..."

Li Xuanxuan found the story odd. His smile faded, and he quietly glanced at him, saying, "I think you've lost your mind, daring to spout nonsense here... A rogue cultivator takes what, sixty years to break through the Qi Cultivation Realm? He came here a hundred and thirty years ago? He’s probably long dead in some forgotten corner.

"Just because someone once cultivated in a place doesn’t make them destined to be there!"

Daoist Fu Yuan was terrified, shaking his head repeatedly as he hurriedly said, "Your Excellency! My martial uncle carries a great fortune with him! He is definitely not ordinary!"

Li Xuanxuan no longer quite believed him and only asked, "What kind of fortune?"

Daoist Fu Yuan couldn’t explain and stammered, "My master was still thinking of my martial uncle on his deathbed, saying our grandmaster passed the fortune to him before he died..."

He couldn't explain it, and what great fortune could a Qi Cultivation Realm rogue cultivator possibly have anyway? Fu Yuan knew this in his heart, and could only keep kowtowing without saying another word.

Li Xuanxuan saw that the man's qi wasn’t particularly impure. For someone from a place like Xu State, it was already rare and precious. He wasn’t planning to make things difficult and was just about to speak.

"Wait..." Li Xijun suddenly stopped him, frowning and shaking his head.

Daoist Fu Yuan grew even more terrified, raising his head in panic, thinking, The old man is kind, but this handsome young man is ruthless.

Li Xijun simply gave him a calm glance and asked softly, "Old man, how did you escape from the Merciful Ones and the Master Monks?"

Daoist Fu Yuan stared blankly at him, as if trying to recall, and after several breaths, he exclaimed in surprise, "Oh dear... I’ve completely forgotten!"

Blood seeped from his mouth and nose. With a cry of pain, his body collapsed like a bundle of firewood, hitting the ground with a thud. He was dead without another sound.

Li Xijun stepped back and used mana to flip the body. Daoist Fu Yuan's face was pale and skin cold. With two fingers forming a sword, Li Xijun slit open his abdomen.

Inside was pitch black. His internal organs had vanished, leaving behind only a shriveled, dead maggot.

Li Xuanxuan stood in a daze, while on the other side, Li Zhouwei gripped his halberd thoughtfully. Li Xijun conjured flame between two fingers and gently dropped it onto the empty skin. With a burst of crackling sounds:

Boom...

The dried-up flesh caught fire instantly, flaring brightly for a moment before turning to ash.

Seeing this, He Yitao was terrified to the extreme, tears and snot flowing as he said in a low voice, "I possess nothing of value. Your Excellency would disdain such things. But for the sake of my harmlessness, I beg for my life. I will obey your every command, without a hint of betrayal."

He feared Li Xijun would ask something that would cost him his life on the spot. But the man merely took his storage pouch, examined it for a breath, saw it was full of blood-stained meat and rice, and shook his head.

Before He Yitao could react, a scorching pain bloomed in his chest. Heat surged from his belly and spurted out his nostrils. A halberd had pierced through his chest, its shaft held by the young man.

The demonic fetus he had nurtured in his abdomen immediately awoke. It was a tiny, mouse-like lump of flesh, it wriggled a few times inside him, but before it could burst out or hide, a hand plunged once more into his belly.

Li Zhouwei held the halberd with one hand, stirred around in the belly with the other, fished out the demonic fetus, studied it for two seconds, and casually crushed it.

Though He Yitao was at least an early-stage Qi Cultivation Realm devil cultivator, he had no chance to react. His head was removed in the next instant.

Golden flame surged from Li Zhouwei’s hand, laced with black smoke. He cast it onto the corpse, and in an instant, golden sparks consumed it completely. The young heir retracted his halberd, and Li Xijun nodded, saying, "The Bright Yang Dao is also effective against devil cultivators... Though it’s not as potent as Supreme Yang or Profound Thunder, it’s still well-regarded."

Beside them, Li Xuanxuan was still staring blankly at Daoist Fu Yuan’s corpse. Li Xijun turned to look back and, seeing the old man lost in thought, said with some concern, "Uncle..."

Li Xuanxuan stepped forward slowly, took the storage pouch from Daoist Fu Yuan’s waist, examined it closely, and murmured, "So very familiar!"

This small brocade pouch was different from the ones commonly used in Yue State, it was more delicate and compact. Li Xuanxuan studied it for a while, and a look of reminiscence appeared on his face as he softly said, "The first storage pouch my family ever owned... looked just like this!"

After saying this, he grew more certain, turning the pouch over again and again, his voice drifting, "Back then, Uncle Xiangping went to rescue the Wan Family. Who would have thought the Ji Family borrowed strength from the Golden Tang Gate and utterly crushed the Wan Family... My uncle ran into an old Daoist who tried to kill him.

"That old Daoist had waited in the lake for thirty years, seeking a fortune... but was killed by my uncle, who brought back this very storage pouch. It seems... he was the martial uncle mentioned just now."

Li Xuanxuan paused in thought for a breath and softly said, "If there's ever a chance, we should go visit Floating Cloud Cave on Mount Xiaoshi."

Li Xijun, of course, understood what he meant. He nodded silently and said softly, "The situation in Xu State is utterly chaotic. With the Fei Family holding the front, we can discuss things more thoroughly. After all, it’s a rare Foundation Establishment Realm formation. If used well, we could reduce our own losses significantly."

Li Xuanxuan put the storage pouch away, his expression showing faint dissatisfaction as he said, "Even at this point, they still refuse to send someone to ask for aid."

Li Xijun let out a small laugh. Li Zhouwei stood tall and said softly, "The Azure Pond Sect is ten thousand miles away, far beyond reach. It takes over a month to go and return. But we’re just across the lake, close at hand. A distant stream can't put out a nearby fire. They'll see it clearly soon enough."

Both seniors nodded. After arranging the defenses, Li Zhouwei soon took his leave, riding the wind out of Qingdu, drifting lightly into the side courtyard of the central hall.

Chen Yang followed closely behind, speaking respectfully, "Your Highness, my father has been waiting in the hall for quite some time."

Hearing this, Li Zhouwei nodded and finally came to a stop. As expected, he saw the middle-aged Chen Mufeng waiting respectfully in the great hall, holding a young woman by the hand.

Chen Mufeng had now reached the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Though he had erred in the Xu Xiao matter years ago and was severely punished, the Chen Family remained a prominent family, and Chen Donghe held considerable favor. So, Mufeng still had some standing.

He approached with a full smile. Chen Mufeng had married Li Xicheng's younger sister and was also Li Chengliao's uncle by marriage. He spoke, "Your Highness, this is my youngest daughter, Chen Shao... born of a concubine. Now that she's grown a bit older, I’ve brought her for Your Highness to see..."

Li Zhouwei naturally understood what he was trying to do. Glancing at the demure, downcast girl, he deliberately avoided eye contact and flung his robe aside. He walked straight into the room, leaving only a voice echoing through the courtyard, "Go ask my father!"

Chen Mufeng was thoroughly shut down. He exchanged a glance with Chen Yang, and could only withdraw quietly.

As the father and daughter left the courtyard, Chen Shao seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, her steps growing noticeably lighter. Chen Mufeng let out a low sigh, while Chen Yang walked slowly with a dark expression clouding his face.

Back at the Chen residence, Chen Shao gave a hurried bow and retreated as if fleeing. Chen Mufeng seemed calm enough, simply leading Chen Yang forward.

The father and son said nothing as they made their way swiftly to the rear courtyard. Madam Li was reading, and glanced up to ask, "So it didn’t work out?"

Chen Yang answered coldly, "Correct!"

He gave a slight bow, flung his sleeve, and left.

Chen Mufeng stood awkwardly in the courtyard. Madam Li merely sighed and said, "If it didn’t work, so be it! We just wanted to see if either side would take a liking... I don’t blame you for anything."

Madam Li had always been a gentle and fair mistress of the household, Chen Mufeng knew this well. He nodded, and when their eyes met, both saw the same worry reflected in the other.

Chen Mufeng’s expression was no longer just awkward, he was angry too. After brooding for a while and drinking several cups of tea, he could no longer hold back and said in a low, tense voice, "He... he’s truly vicious to the core!"

Madam Li sighed. The middle-aged woman was gradually growing helpless too, and said softly, "I don’t know who he takes after... The more we taught him, the more he learned to manipulate and use people."

Chen Mufeng's anger surged again, and he ground his teeth as he said, "How did we... end up raising him like this! He wasn’t this cold and heartless, this sharp and unkind when he was little!"

Though he had always favored this eldest son, he was still a father. His heart held feelings for all his children. He said coldly, "The way he looked. It was as if the younger sister didn’t marry the heir, he’d pull a blade to force her!"

Madam Li lowered her eyes, unsure of how to comfort her husband for a moment.

Creak...

A crisp creaking sound echoed as the courtyard gate was pushed open. A pale, lean and nimble hand appeared, followed by their eldest son, Chen Yang, stepping inside with a calm smile on his face.

His face was sharp and cold, even smiling. He exuded a chilling sense of cunning. The eldest son spoke softly, "Father, let’s go see the family head tomorrow."

Both husband and wife felt a chill run down their spines, struck speechless. The courtyard gate was supposed to isolate sound. Chen Yang, who had just left, couldn’t possibly have heard their conversation. Yet Chen Mufeng felt his son’s gaze chill him to the bone, like frost.

Somehow, he nodded unconsciously. Chen Yang chuckled, gripped the doorway with both hands and stepped out backward. He closed the doors behind him with two crisp creaks, tight and shut.

Chen Mufeng vaguely felt sweat forming on his forehead. He picked up his tea and drank heavily for several gulps before turning to look at his wife again.

Madam Li sat frozen in place, staring blankly. After a long moment, she finally said in a soft voice, "I once thought that sending him to the main household... would refine his temperament, teach him humility and restraint, help him understand there are always greater people in this world..."

Her eyes lowered slightly as she spoke quietly, "Now I feel... sending him to the heir’s side, letting him lead troops and kill, suppressing Mount Yue only sharpened his claws and fangs. He once only looked cruel and cunning but now it's in his very bones."

Chen Mufeng sat in a daze for more than ten seconds, feeling an icy chill spread through his heart before he finally said coldly, "He only values the ones on Qingdu... Only sees them as his kind... Only yields to the heir. As for us... we're nothing more than tools he can rely on when needed."

Hearing this, Madam Li was startled and shocked. She suddenly raised her head, staring at the man who had seemed foolish beside her for most of their lives, and a strange premonition rose in her heart, So it turns out... the son's cunning comes from a father who was never simple either.

When she tried to ask Chen Mufeng again, the man remained silent.
