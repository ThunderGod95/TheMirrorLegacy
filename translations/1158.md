# Chapter 1158: Reclaiming Fate

Divine abilities roiled.

One by one, Daoist Masters stood above Lake Xian as the Great Void shuddered, refusing to settle. The formless power that shielded the earth veins had already faded. The lake water had been evaporated completely, leaving a thick crust of salt frost at its bottom. The pale azure light of Horn Wood mingled with the verdant wind that blanketed the surface, transforming it into what looked like a vast, fertile plain.

Some of these divine abilities blazed with light while others were dim and pallid, a constellation of uneven stars suspended in the air. At their very center stood an old man with a golden-red blade slung across his back. His face was slightly pale, yet it bore the faint trace of a smile.

Situ Huo was brimming with triumph.

He had entered this great battle expecting to get the short end of the stick, even secretly preparing to throw in his lot with the north. But then Lingmei had stepped forward, meaning he no longer had to face Wang Ziya's treasure—the very bane of Metal Virtue!

His opponents were the Helian uncle-nephew duo, and one of them, Helian Wumeng, was still mending his physical form with blood qi, having only just recovered from a grievous wound.

Pitting Metal Malice against Demonic Malice, further bolstered by the light of Martial Cultivation, he tore through their defenses. When he saw Qi Lanyan fall and the tides of battle turn, a new ambition sparked within him. He began to see the Helian uncle and nephew as trophies for the taking—he, Situ Huo, was here to earn his destiny, and the more divine abilities he slew, the better.

It was his all-out, reckless interception of the newly recovered Helian Wumeng that forced the ruler of the Tiefu Kingdom, Helian Wujiang, to make a sacrificial turn. This mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm master had abandoned his own fight to cover his nephew's retreat, sealing his own fate on this battlefield.

But for Situ Huo, this was just one joy piled upon another.

‘What’s one Helian Wumeng compared to this? The man is not only a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm master, he’s the ruler of a kingdom! The Helian family founded the Tiefu Kingdom and once controlled all of Monan. They still hold considerable sway. Though he keeps a low profile, the rewards for taking him down would be immense!’

Everyone had been wounded in this battle. Li Zhouwei’s state went without saying. Daoist Master Wenqing had been ambushed by the retreating Zhelu, her dharma body all but shattered. Ning Wan had only survived by relying on the Great Snow's Severing Edge. The only one to emerge and reap the spoils of their conflict was him.

And with Li Zhouwei gravely injured, Situ Huo was the only cultivator of consequence at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. As the Military Commissioner of Tangdao, responsibility fell to him. The upcoming reconquest of Jianghuai would fall under his command. How could he not be ecstatic? The joy in his eyes was plain to see as he chuckled.

"My apologies, Daoist Helian."

The remark was dripping with sarcasm. Helian Wujiang lifted his head, his gaze piercing through the swirling spectrum of powers to scan the faces around him, as if to commit each one to memory. His lips trembled as he spoke, his voice low.

"Situ Huo!"

The cry was fierce and sharp, reverberating with venom through the assembled powers. The other cultivators remained silent. Situ Huo’s eyes gleamed as he retorted,

"There is no shame in your capture at my hands, Daoist. But you have failed to cultivate immortal virtue. You have killed without number, and your crimes are too numerous to list. When you stand before the emperor of my dynasty, you will answer for them!"

His words were masterful, simultaneously highlighting his own great deed and issuing a threat, all but praying for the man to drop dead right there and then. Helian Wujiang let out a sneer, his gaze mocking the Blood-Omen Tower in Situ Huo’s hand. In the end, he let it go, his voice taking on a haunting quality.

"Situ Huo, the path of Martial Cultivation is easy to grasp but difficult to release. Your lifespan dwindles, and the day you take refuge with the Buddhists draws near. Do you truly believe the Yang Clan is unprepared for that?"

At these words, some cultivators turned away in silence, while others couldn't suppress a cold smirk. Situ Huo’s expression remained unchanged as he smiled.

"My loyalty to the emperor is as clear as the heavens. I'll not be swayed by the provocations of a dead man walking!"

The old man appeared calm, but the white-knuckled grip on his blade betrayed the fury in his heart. The smile on his face grew colder, but then he stiffened and whipped his head around.

At some point, a sword immortal in white had appeared beside the golden body held fast by the Supreme Yang radiance. His sword-sharp eyes were glacial. Beside him, Lin Chensheng’s eyes were tinged with red as he stood in attendance with the deference of a disciple.

Maha Nuzi’s face was a mask of terror.

"I am a trusted agent of the Peacock," he stammered. "Sword Immortal, spare my life, and the Way of Great Desire will reward you handsomely!"

His plea seemed to make the very heavens tremble. The sword immortal let out a furious laugh, and the Pear Blossom Sword in his hand hummed to life.

Heaven and earth turned white.

A razor-sharp wave of Reflecting Metal Qi sliced through the verdant wind, causing the golden body to shudder violently. The sword immortal's figure dissipated like smoke. Before Maha Nuzi could even utter a cry of pain, a surge of pink light and a cascade of sand and rock plummeted into the lake below.

Maha Nuzi of the Way of Great Desire had fallen.

None of the masters in the sky paid his death any mind, yet no one moved. Even Situ Huo waited in silence, watching as Sima Yuanli descended on the wind from amidst the maelstrom of dust and light. He stopped beside the young man at the lake's center and spoke with tentative reverence.

"The northern cultivators are broken. We await your command to deploy our forces, King Wei."

"Crack."

As Li Zhouwei moved, flakes of multicolored light fell from his body like cracking porcelain. He turned his head. That face, covered in a web of colorful fractures, swiveled toward Sima Yuanli, the iridescent light in his eyes blazing fiercely. Daoist Master Qinghu felt a chill creep into his heart as he raised his gaze, only to see the young man beside him suddenly stir.

He trod upon the Heavenly Light, walking step by step toward the horizon. Streaks of multicolored light trailed from his body like teardrops, drawing the shocked and bewildered gazes of all present.

Helian Wujiang snapped his head up as he heard a hoarse voice.

"I will grant you a swift end."

The words echoed as the long halberd spun back, descending with a crash under the watch of countless eyes.

‘He… can still attack!’

Helian Wujiang was utterly spent, having just endured a brutal siege. Yet he possessed both a Body Divine Ability and a Life Divine Ability. Short of the Yang Clan producing a treasure on par with the Crystalline Jade Branch, no matter how he was suppressed, he could always take his own life in an instant. Capturing him alive was a near-impossible task.

Forcing him to surrender was even more out of the question.

Unlike the unattached Buddhist and rogue cultivators, or the Touba and Murong clans who had powerful backers and the possibility of a prisoner exchange, Helian Wujiang was the paramount warrior of the Tiefu Kingdom. If he surrendered, the fate awaiting the entire Tiefu Xiongnu and the escaped Helian Wumeng was easy to imagine.

‘He chose to stay behind. He was already prepared to die.’

In that instant, every gaze converged on him. Even Helian Wujiang, his face grim beneath the roiling divine abilities, looked up. He understood that Li Zhouwei was offering him a final measure of dignity. He exhaled a long breath and met his fate.

His lips trembled. This was the man who had dominated Monan for a century, who had deftly guided the Helian family through crisis and revival, yet now he found he had no one to whom he could entrust his final words. Ultimately, he remained silent.

"BOOM!"

As the assembled masters held their breath, his Shengyang Acupoint imploded. His entire body erupted into a torrent of demonic light. A thick pillar of Baleful Qi shot skyward, blasting away all the divine abilities pressing down on it and painting the heavens with a vista of mountains and rivers made from the ink of Baleful Qi.

The Horn Wood divine ability had filled the sky for a mere dozen breaths before the Baleful Qi surged, overwhelming the verdant wind. On the same day, a second mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm master had fallen.

"DONG!"

The sky turned a viscous, ink-green. Cold drops of baleful rain began to fall. A darkness so profound you couldn't see your own hand swept across the firmament, leaving the divine radiances of the masters standing like lonely sentinels.

Helian Wujiang had no real feud with the southern cultivators. In past conflicts, he had practiced restraint, taking care not to offend any single power. Now, in the silence, there was a certain sorrow for a fallen peer.

Situ Huo's face darkened. He lowered his eyes, saying nothing, seemingly lost in thought. Sima Yuanli quietly watched the cold rain, but he noticed that the King of Wei remained standing in mid-air, his back ramrod straight, showing no sign of retreat.

‘What else is he planning to do?’

The King of Wei crossed the celestial darkness, treading upon the light to land by the lakeshore. His voice was hoarse, but his words were steady and strong.

"Tinglan, Fangjing, Qinghu."

At his call, three figures stepped forward. Lin Chensheng acknowledged the order as the King of Wei continued,

"With Lake Xian conquered, the Jianghuai region is ours for the taking. You three will take the Holder of the Profound with you to Baiye Creek. Surround the mountain gate, but do not attack immediately. Drive off their divine abilities, then proceed to the White River to rescue the Moongaze forces and reinforce the Tangdao garrison."

"Yes."

The cultivators acknowledged. A smile touched Situ Huo's lips, but his expression froze as Li Zhouwei’s steady voice rang out again.

"Situ Huo and Cheng Jiuwen, you two…"

The young man paused, a cold smile forming on his lips.

"You will follow me to conquer Xuanmiao Temple and advance along the Baihai Creek."

A wave of shock rippled through the crowd.

‘For an ordinary cultivator struck by the Crystalline Jade Branch, it's a miracle to survive. They would be forced into seclusion for decades, and many perish unexpectedly in seclusion. He… he dares to press north while so gravely injured!’

Every cultivator's expression changed. Situ Huo was stunned into silence. But the pair of iridescent eyes stared straight at him, forcing him to swallow his words of disbelief.

"This subordinate obeys!"

A flicker of doubt had already been in his heart, and now, understanding dawned.

‘So… so he’s also trying to amass his own share of destiny! That’s why he’s insisting on heading north despite his wounds!’

Poised and unhurried, Li Zhouwei strode onto the Heavenly Light and headed north. The dark Crimson Severing Arrowhead flickered, shielding him from all sight. Only then did he discreetly swallow the blood that had risen in his throat, his complexion improving slightly.

His ability to endure this long was thanks to a great contributor—the Crimson Severing Arrowhead.

This ability to defer a tenth of his injuries proved equally effective against this tribulation, which meant the actual burden on his body was less than ninety percent. This Bright Yang divine ability was unexpectedly immune to Wu Earth. Just moments ago, while riding the arrowhead, he had slipped past the sweeping Wu Light that had pinned all the other divine abilities to the lake, causing Qi Lanyan’s plan to fail.

He keenly sensed the anomaly in this.

‘It is said that Wu Light is inescapable, that few can evade it and even fewer can suppress it. This miraculous power, which no one has ever spoken of… it could prove decisive in future battles!’

But now was not the time for such considerations. Feeling the success of the Sovereign's Perilous Tread and the feedback of dharma power from his Talisman Qi, Li Zhouwei made a quick calculation.

‘Three days!’

He had spent most of the battle fighting alone, so the resonance he felt from the White Qilin's destiny was faint, and the feedback from his technique was correspondingly weak. The greater aid came from the dharma power his Talisman Qi had absorbed by breaking through divine abilities and defeating his foes.

This power, working in concert with potent medicinal pills, was holding back the escalating tribulation within him and allowing his condition to stabilize. But within three days, both forces would be depleted. If he didn't enter seclusion to suppress the tribulation by then, he would be in grave danger.

‘Three days… to pacify the Jianghuai region.’

The multicolored light in his eyes was grim, but held no fear.

‘With Qi Lanyan dead, their control over Jianghuai is bound to collapse. The way forward is clear. Besides…’

The image of a purple talisman flashed in his mind. He raised an eyebrow, gazing into the distance.

‘The northern cultivators are not united. Defeated, they will scatter. And since Yehui was willing to conspire, there are surely other gains to be made!’

…

Moongaze Lake.

The colors in the sky had receded, vanishing over the northern horizon. Li Ximing shook his head, feeling a wave of dizziness. He coughed up a spray of golden blood that erupted into embers and vanished.

He looked up toward the east in shock. An intense shade of bruised-black stained the sky, a dreadful omen that filled him with alarm.

‘What is this?’

The distance between Lake Xian and Moongaze Lake spanned the entire Song State. To see such a cataclysmic sign so clearly, more than one Purple Mansion expert must have fallen.

‘Minghuang knows his limits. Qi Lanyan would not have dared to harm him…’

He had no time to ponder it further. To the west, the enemy forces were finally in retreat, their banners fading from view. He felt a sliver of relief.

"The assault from Western Shu was ferocious."

Li Zhouwei had correctly predicted a major battle at Moongaze Lake. But his departure had shifted the entire focus of the north-south conflict, and Qing Jifeng was making his move. The main invading force had unexpectedly been from Western Shu. Of the reinforcements he had expected, only Chen Yin had arrived to defend the river.

Li Muyan and Hongyan had arrived as planned, but one was still recovering from grave injuries, while the other's hands were tied; neither was a significant factor. But among the ominous clouds, there had been another.

His name was Shen Sou, a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who possessed profound divine abilities.

Against the three of them, Li Ximing’s life had hung by a thread. If not for the Heavenly Nurture Urn holding them in check, he would have been grievously wounded, if not killed, long before they reached the Western Mountains.

Now, with the western forces suddenly withdrawing, he was injured but alive. Yet he felt not an ounce of relief.

‘Jiangqian is still guarding the river.’

Even if the north's focus was no longer on the west, the guardians they left at the White River would be formidable. Moreover, with Baiye Creek lost and the Tangdao garrison surrounded, the Mahas of the Way of Great Desire could march unopposed.

Li Jiangqian was stationed on the riverbank, from where he could watch the opposite shore. Before the battle started, Shilou Yingge and Gao Fangjing had been at Baijiang Creek, not to mention several of the Merciful Ones…

‘Shilou Yingge might not be willing to fight hard for Qi Lanyan, but the Way of Great Desire harbors ambitions. If they send someone south, their target would undoubtedly be Jiangqian!’

The fact that Li Jiangqian had not yet activated his distress talisman offered a small measure of comfort. With no time to waste, Li Ximing shot through the air, secretly activating an art.

[Spirit Probe]!

He had just left the Western Mountains, but already the scene at the churning river materialized in his mind's eye. The image that returned, however, sent a jolt through his heart.

The river surged, and divine abilities clashed overhead. A storm of Radiant Fire raged with abandon. There was no sign of Shilou Yingge or Gao Fangjing, nor any other northern reinforcements. The Way of Great Desire had not even sent a Maha. There were only two Merciful Ones, struggling desperately beneath the flames, pinned down and unable to advance or retreat.

The knot of anxiety in his chest finally loosened, only to be replaced by a wave of confusion. He rode the Heavenly Light, arriving at the northern bank in moments. Wary of an ambush, he stopped and cast his gaze further north, toward the White River.

Indeed, he saw blazing True Fire and the golden body of a Maha.

But far more eye-catching were the dozens of divine abilities flashing across the sky. A brilliant golden qi filled the heavens, and within it stood several Daoist Masters clad in gold. They stood firm against the searing heat of the True Fire, pressing the two masters of 'True Fire' at the center so hard they couldn't even raise their heads.

‘The Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition!’

Everything clicked into place. In a flash of insight, Li Ximing understood.

‘It’s the Golden Feather Sect… They must have launched their northern assault long ago and already pushed into the Jianghuai region!’
