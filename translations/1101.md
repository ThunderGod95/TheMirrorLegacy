# Chapter 1101: The Precious Tusk Affair

The golden hall echoed with nothing but wave after wave of sobbing. The black-robed monk's words left the other monks bewildered, unable to comprehend. Outside, golden light continued to flare and overlap in the sky, only to cascade downward, one streak after another.

Fachang ascended the steps from the front of the hall.

The Dharma Realm was riddled with factions; some sought the ancient paths, others invested in new arts. This Maha, Fachang, guarded an old heart, trying to protect the Dharma Realm's interests, and as a result, he pleased no one. He was a lone figure even within his own order. As he entered the main hall, his face was slick with cold sweat.

Even if he and Vast Cicada weren't particularly close—the entire Great Adoration Dharma Realm had suffered this loss!

'Vast Cicada was killed by the south!'

The thought sent a chill from his scalp to his toes. He approached Kongshu and bowed low, his voice thick with grief and terror.

"Grand Martial Uncle!"

Kongshu's gaze remained fixed on the residual image, and he said nothing for a long time.

Fachang frantically waved his sleeve, banishing the disorderly crowd of wailing, prostrating monks from the hall. He sealed the doors. In an instant, the candles flared to life, and all aural chaos was shut outside. Only then did Fachang drop to his knees.

"Grand Martial Uncle," he wept, "what are we to do?"

At last, the monk Kongshu turned his head.

"What to do?" he sighed. "The moment Li Jieyi agreed to go south, scheming against another's life-mandate, he should have known this day would come. How can one plot to take another's life and expect to keep one's own?"

Sweat poured from Fachang like rain. Even one as obstinate as him couldn't spare the energy to debate the point. He just lowered his gaze.

"But... even if he died as a consequence of his own karma... Precious Tusk!"

Forget the entire world, forget all Buddhist cultivators—within the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, was there any high-ranking member who didn't know of their Realm Lord's designs on that Golden Land? On a small scale, this was just Vast Cicada losing his life. On a grand scale... a major operation of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm had been sabotaged!

Seeing Kongshu's continued silence, Fachang could only grit his teeth.

"Our life-mandates are fragile and our Dao-Profundity shallow. We cannot perceive the shape of such great matters... much less discern the will of heaven. We only wish to ask Grand Martial Uncle... What is the status of Precious Tusk right now?"

"Contact has been lost. What else could its status be?" Kongshu replied, leaving Fachang speechless.

Losing contact with a Golden Land was nothing new. The most recent case was the Qin Ling Golden Land. That particular Golden Land had an origin even more profound than Precious Tusk's! It had been the seat of power for the great master who had synthesized the demonic and Buddhist paths. And though the Wei Emperor had shattered it with a single decree... the legacy it contained remained terrifyingly rich.

When that Golden Land was in the hands of the Wrath Aspect, it was known as the sharpest of blades, its might unparalleled. But after the Wrath manifestation collapsed overnight, the illustrious Dao Lineage of Qin Ling could only sense a single, pitiful Merciful One position. Neither their own Realm Lord nor the masters of the other aspects could do anything about the hidden Qin Ling Golden Land. To this day, it remained lost.

Fachang understood exactly how catastrophic this loss was.

"This matter..." he choked out, "the Master of Tanshan has never cared for our affairs. But I fear... I fear this will enrage the Realm Lord. Among the five peaks, not only will they lay the blame on Precious Tusk, but the voices demanding a southern campaign will grow ever louder..."

"Now, we won't even be able to suppress the other Daos, and we ourselves will be dragged into the mire... How much more killing karma must be generated!"

Seeing Fachang's utterly desolate expression, Kongshu shook his head.

"It is not quite so dire as that."

He shifted his gaze to the statue of the Undefeated King of Brightness in the center of the hall.

"Back when Great Wei stood," Kongshu said quietly, "the Wei Emperor and the six-surnamed kings of Guanlong often feasted in the Central Long Gardens. They raised White Qilins there. When Wei fell, the Shangguan family broke open the gardens, and the White Qilins scattered. Most, however, were slain by powerful cultivators. One of them made its way to Qingliang Terrace. The abbot at the time named it 'Shengming', hoping it would achieve greatness."

"Later, when the Undefeated King of Brightness achieved his station, this White Qilin was gifted to him as a mount. They ultimately died together. But what few know is that this White Qilin senior fled and died upon Qingliang Terrace—and it left behind many words."

Fachang froze, his eyes widening in horror.

"If that's true... then the truth of Emperor Liang's drowning... Qingliang Terrace..."

Kongshu fell silent for a moment, shooting Fachang a warning glance before continuing.

"This senior passed away in the mountains. His final words were: 'He who succeeds Precious Tusk shall be a King Cicada descendant.' He then dissolved into endless Heavenly Light and Radiant Fire, leaving behind a single Sarira on the terrace. It was shaped like a White Cicada, and they called it the 'Shengming Precious Tusk Stone'."

"That single sentence... it protected a descendant from that branch of the Undefeated King of Brightness. At the time, this descendant was hiding with the Tao family. To escape the chaos of war, they all changed their surname to Tao, pretending to be members of that family."

"And Vast Cicada... he is a direct descendant of that line. His study of the Immortal Dao... was, in fact, done in secret, under an old Daoist Master from Seeking the Purple Pavilion."

Fachang's disbelief was total. "Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect? The Dao Lineage of the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch?"

The sweat on his face grew heavier. He finally connected the dots.

"...Li Jieyi could have studied at the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect... He was a Tao, after all. I heard back then that he was humiliated by Bai Ziyu, and couldn't bear the insult after just a few words. So that was the reason. To think... a disciple of the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect, the very sect that most despises Buddhist cultivators, was ultimately forced to enter our Buddhist Path..."

Kongshu's expression was complicated.

"His master was merely a person from the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect."

"As his cultivation neared its bottleneck, unable to comprehend the Purple Mystery, his master also perished. It was then that he met our Dao's lord. He bowed to the Shengming Precious Tusk Stone and entered the Buddhist Path to unseal Precious Tusk. But the reality of it was far less glorious..."

The black-robed monk let out a low sigh.

"And he... upon first entering the Buddhist Path, his ambition was already too great. He even entertained the idea of cultivating the demonic path. After all, in the eyes of those Immortal Dao cultivators... the demonic is at least the opposite of the immortal. Anything but falling so low as to join the Buddhist Path."

"To that end, he insisted on refining a flawless, perfect Dharma Body, refusing to settle for anything less. But he feared it would take too long, leaving him without sufficient combat strength in the present. So, he went into the Precious Tusk Golden Land and selected the head of a past worthy to use..."

"It was precisely because of this act, and his divided heart, that the Precious Tusk Golden Land never truly acknowledged him. Aside from his own Maha position, the number of other positions it granted him was pitifully small."

"The lords were, in fact, very dissatisfied with him over this. But, having no one else to use, they merely postured, pretending they might reclaim Precious Tusk and find another... He was held over the fire, which is what forced him to rush south in search of an opportunity."

Fachang let out a visible sigh of relief.

"May the Revered One protect us... May the Revered One protect us... In that case, this might not be such a bad thing. The Shengming Precious Tusk Stone is still in our hands. Though Precious Tusk is out of contact for now, surely it will one day return..."

He looked genuinely relieved. But Kongshu's expression remained heavy.

"You are wrong."

Fachang looked up as the black-robed monk continued, "The Seven Aspects may not have needed Vast Cicada. But his absence is a disaster for the Dharma Realm. The Seven Aspects still have leverage over Bright Yang. With Vast Cicada, our Dharma Realm could have supported him, contended with the Seven Aspects, and maintained our involvement. Now that he has perished—and with no descendants in the Tao family—we have lost that right!"

"We must wait until Compassion and Great Desire make their moves, achieve their victories, and apply pressure through Mount Dayang..."

"Doesn't the Great Desire Dao have a Bright Yang bloodline in their possession? If they prop that person up, and our mountain has no one of Vast Cicada's stature to counter... then for the sake of the greater good, we may be forced to hand over the Shengming Precious Tusk Stone for them all to share. It will go from being the property of our Dharma Realm... to a treasure carved up by all Seven Aspects."

This black-robed monk was truly formidable. Not only was he brilliant, but he was completely unbound by dogma. He had, almost single-handedly, deduced the most likely course of the future.

Fachang was speechless. He knelt in a stupor for a long time before gritting his teeth.

"Vast Cicada... Vast Cicada! So greedy, so wicked! He hadn't a single shred of cultivated virtue in his heart, yet he possessed a desire to swallow the heavens! Now, everything is ruined because of him!"

Kongshu remained noncommittal. He simply helped Fachang to his feet. 

"Regardless, he was a Maha of our Dharma Realm. Find someone to make a trip south. Go to where his body fell. Retrieve a piece of his Dharma Body, so that he may be properly enshrined..."

Fachang nodded mutely.

Kongshu, however, merely smiled.

"You need not despair. The one who truly needs to worry right now... is Qi Lanyan."

"As for Precious Tusk..."

The monk's face was serene, his eyes lost in thought.

"In the end, it will find its way to the one who deserves it."

...

Moongaze Lake.

The sky churned with rolling colors. A thick, oppressive purple blanketed the heavens, warring with the myriad colors from the west and casting down pulsing halos of light.

Moongaze Lake had weathered many disasters, but they were almost always concentrated on the northern and eastern shores. The western shore, after all, was backed by the Western Mountains, and the southern shore by Mount Dali. For ages, both had been free from external threats. They were peaceful, prosperous regions.

The western shore, in particular, was rich with mineral resources. Back in the Azure Pond era, when Daoist He had governed the shore, he had established rules that prevented most conflict. Later, when the Li family retook the west, the Yang family acted as intermediaries, allowing them to secure it without bloodshed. The place had never even suffered the schemes of the southern clans. The appearance of one or two demonic cultivators was the extent of its troubles. It had known peace for hundreds of years.

But today, upon the peaks of the Western Mountains, countless banners snapped in the wind. Amidst the roiling clouds, the glittering golden character for 'Shu' was faintly visible. Enormous flying vessels sliced through the air as legions of cultivators descended on the wind, their gazes cold.

The entire western shore erupted into chaos. War cries tore through the sky as battles broke out everywhere. The deduction made by Yang Ruiyi and the two Li family members had been correct. The soldiers of Shu had arrived.

Li Ximing prized the safety of Moongaze Lake above all else. Vast Cicada's reputation was simply too rotten. He couldn't be certain that the man would head north after emerging from the White Ye Immortal Sect. What if he took the risk and came south, striking at Moongaze Lake? That would shatter the Li family's very foundation.

Thus, as arranged by Yang Ruiyi, Li Ximing had initially remained at Moongaze Lake. Unlike Li Zhouwei, who had already prepared to move north, Li Ximing was still on the river when he personally witnessed the White Ye Immortal Sect's ambush force move north, not south. Only then did he finally depart, arriving at Baixiang one step behind Li Zhouwei.

Left to stand guard in his place was Daoist Master Wenqing of the Purple Smoke Grotto-Heaven, specifically to defend against Western Shu.

At this moment, the Daoist Master held a Purple Qi Dharma Conch, locked in a battle of arts with a white-robed Daoist Master on the Western Mountains. Her opponent, wielding a treasured blade, looked perfectly calm. He was none other than the Great Shu's Military Commissioner of the Desert Pacification Army—Daoist Master Ni Hongyan.

This Daoist Master had once been a staunch supporter of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition and was close to Sword Gate. He also recognized Purple Qi. Now, leading an army against Daoist Master Wenqing, he fought with a casual ease, clearly holding back.

Hongyan, after all, possessed two divine abilities. He had not only received a Dao Lineage from Sword Gate but had also acquired numerous techniques from Changhuai. With both supporting him, his strength was truly formidable. He felt no pressure at all dealing with Wenqing. He was, in fact, intentionally showing mercy.

In the sky, Daoist Master Wenqing knew her opponent was going easy on her. The complex emotions in her heart were indescribable.

'To think it would come to this...'

She, Kan Ziyu, had been a direct disciple of Purple Smoke, a woman of high status. She had even been friends with Cheng Gao and had visited the Ni clan as a guest. This very Daoist Master Hongyan... he had met her back then. He had even entrusted his own direct grandson to her, to cultivate under her tutelage.

'That boy was named Ni Zan. He returned to his clan long ago and should be in the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm by now. If the world were as it was a hundred years ago, Hongyan and I would be the closest of friends.'

'And now... we are here, fighting to the death.'

Her heart was a knot of conflicting feelings. She had no way of knowing that Daoist Master Hongyan, who appeared so calm and collected, was suffering his own internal earthquake of boundless panic.

He, Hongyan, had not achieved the Dao all that long ago. He had attained his divine ability in the same year as Tu Longjian, and only then because of a generous gift from Sword Gate. Without that spiritual item from the old Sword Gate Daoist Master, Hongyan would be nothing but a pile of dust.

Ever since Qing Jifang had stationed him in the great desert, Daoist Master Hongyan had felt something was wrong. And just as he'd feared, now that an army was needed to cross the Western Mountains and attack Moongaze Lake, he was the one they had sent.

Daoist Master Hongyan knew exactly what was happening.

'How many schemes could that bastard Qing Jifang possibly have? He knows I've always been close to the Dao traditions of Yue State, so he sends me to lead the attack and forge a blood feud with the Li clan!'

His heart went cold, and he trembled.

'He's just like his father—pitifully petty. This is revenge. This is his reprisal for what happened that day! He's killing the chicken to warn the monkey!'

Back when Great Song was founded, Li Zhouwei had been ennobled as King Wei. Qing Jifang had brought him and Li Muyan east...

Daoist Master Hongyan had private ties to the Tanshan Li Clan, so he had a decent understanding of Li Muyan. That old fox, in his bid to protect his clan, had come with the express purpose of provoking Ting Province. It was just that Li Zhouwei's divine ability proved too terrifying. He nearly beat Li Muyan to death, forcing him to scream for Qing Jifang. That, in turn, forced the Daoist Master from Mount Changhuai to come out and take the beating himself, causing him to lose immense face.

Li Muyan, satisfied, had returned to his mountain to recuperate. But Daoist Master Hongyan, who had merely sat back and watched the tigers fight, unwilling to commit his full strength, had been marked by Qing Jifang. This, today, was the result.

Qing Jifang knew perfectly well that Hongyan wouldn't go all-out. But the flying vessels behind him and the soldiers at his feet wouldn't be part of his act. Even if the Ni clan wanted to avoid offending Ting Province, a battlefield was no place for diplomacy. A flying sword would cross the distance, and it would be your life or mine. A river of blood was already flowing. The message was unmistakable:

'You don't want to offend the Li clan? Then I'll force your family to be the first to charge!'

What truly made Hongyan's heart sink, however, was the knowledge that these dharma vessels didn't just carry his Ni clan cultivators and the desert garrison. The Shu court had secretly inserted one or two of its own squads...

Hongyan didn't need to think hard to know what they were for. The cultivators on the lake couldn't tell one Shu soldier from another. These agents would simply borrow the Ni clan's name... and commit horrendous slaughter on the western shore, targeting the direct descendants of the Li family.

He could only curse in the darkness of his heart, his thoughts a field of ash.

'After this battle... my Ni clan... will be despised by Ting Province.'
