# Chapter 311: Fahui

Li Xuanling had traversed the Xu State for the past five years. After the battles between the Purple Mansion Realms and the Merciful Ones, the various powers were greatly weakened and focused on recuperation.

With the intervention of the Yue Cultivating Sect in Xu State after the war, rules were established to restrict rogue cultivators, resulting in a period of peace. The common people's lives were relatively decent, though not as prosperous as those under the Li Family's governance, but they were still livable.

Li Xuanling had made connections and recorded various methods of qi gathering in the Xu State. This year, he crossed over to Zhao State to assess the situation there. He saw the desolate land of Duanchen Village and expected the people to be full of complaints, but instead, the tenant farmers were ecstatic. This surprised him, and he asked softly, "How do I get to Mount Luoxia?"

Although the north had fallen under Buddhist control, there were still some Dao lineages and immortal cultivators who lived in seclusion in the mountains, avoiding worldly affairs. They usually had some background, so no one disturbed them.

Mount Luoxia was one such place, where many northern immortal cultivators were still active. Li Xuanling intended to see how the northern Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao differed from the southern ones.

"Mount Luoxia?" The people below exchanged glances with each other upon hearing this, looking puzzled. Li Xuanling shook his head and was about to ride away on the wind when he suddenly looked up, sensing something.

Standing on the ridge of a rice field was a shirtless man with well-defined muscles, his hands clasped together. He stared intently at Li Xuanling and said in a deep voice, "I do not know which path you follow, but you look unfamiliar. Greetings, I am Fahui of Duanchen Temple!"

"Ran into the real deal..." Li Xuanling muttered to himself, feeling awkward now. He wanted to speak but feared revealing his identity. He nodded and was about to ride away on the wind when the monk shouted loudly, "Ha! I knew there was something wrong with you, heretic."

Fahui leaped from the ridge like a soaring eagle, aiming a punch at Li Xuanling. Li Xuanling quickly rode the wind, alarmed, thinking to himself, Is this man crazy?! Why is he attacking me out of nowhere?

Without considering the consequences, he quickly performed a spell to create a mana shield around him while simultaneously grabbing the sword at his waist. His true essence flowed like water as he spoke, "We have no enmity. Why are you attacking, monk?"

The monk's eyes were wide with rage, and his fists, which were like iron, pounded on the shield loudly. Li Xuanling drew his sword, preparing to strike. Fahui kicked the shield, using the force to leap and dodge the sword, then descended like an eagle.

Li Xuanling felt a sharp pain from the cutting wind and raised his sword to block the attack. The sword emitted grayish light, but Fahui, with his steel-like body, grabbed the blade with his bare hands, trying to seize Li Xuanling's wrist.

"Hey!"

Seeing the monk's physical strength, Li Xuanling dared not let him grab hold. He did not want to abandon his sword either, so he thought quickly and cast a spell, aiming it at Fahui's hand while fully activating the sword, emitting waves of gray-black light to force him back.

Fahui was momentarily halted by the spell. He crushed it with his palm, but his other hand was hurt, and the golden light on it showed cracks. Fahui thought, For some reason, I find this person loathsome. My anger is uncontrollable! But this sword is sharp, and holding it will break my Dharma body. I must let go!

He threw a final strong punch at the shield, causing it to shatter with a loud boom, then released the sword and leaped away.

Li Xuanling had gained much experience from killing demons and people in Xu State. This was his first encounter with a Buddhist cultivator and had taken a beating. With a moment to catch his breath, he quickly realized, This person probably can't fly and is only staying aloft by leveraging my power. I don't need to fight him!

He did not pursue but immediately pulled back, leaving Fahui shouting angrily at him. Fahui struggled to stay in the air but eventually fell back to the ground like a heavy bear with a loud crash.

"Hmph! Heretics who lead people astray must be killed!"

Fahui was just a monk who could not ride the wind. Li Xuanling ascended even higher, leaving Fahui glaring angrily from below.

Li Xuanling, both startled and furious after the unexpected attack, cursed, "I only asked for directions. How am I leading them astray?"

Before achieving the status of a true monk, Buddhist cultivators were still ordinary mortals. Despite this, Fahui was highly skilled, breaking Li Xuanling's mana shield with only two punches. Li Xuanling, from his elevated position, could have attacked with his sword but hesitated due to Duanchen Temple's local influence.

The monk below continued cursing, shouting, "You're using illusion technique! How is that not leading people astray? Have you ever led anyone to a land of bliss with your heretical ways? All you seek is to..."

Fahui was still shouting, but Li Xuanling ignored him. He saw figures emerging from the distant mountain temples and knew he could not linger any longer. He sneered and said, "Nonsense! What land of bliss? It is just a pretense to eat people... a self-deceiving concept!"

Fahui's eyes widened in fury as Li Xuanling floated away in the wind. The monk roared in place until other monks arrived where the scene slowly quieted down, but they all glared in the direction Li Xuanling had left.

A monk beside Fahui spoke kindly, trying to calm him down. After a while, an old monk appeared, wearing a gray robe and holding a string of crystal-clear beads. He smiled and said, "Fahui, your destiny has arrived!"

"Abbot," Fahui responded, looking surprised. He asked, "Why do you say that?"

The old monk nodded, looking delighted, and quickly said, "You have been intelligent since young, progressing rapidly in your cultivation. You have the deepest roots of wisdom in our temple and are only a step away from becoming a master monk... I went to the great temple to inquire about you, and now it seems that the opportunity has come!"

"What do you mean?" Fahui asked in a low voice, and upon realizing this concerned his path of cultivation, he immediately shifted his attention, feeling overjoyed.

The old monk stroked his white beard and replied, "I crossed three mountains to seek enlightenment. The Merciful One sat at the head, and I detailed the situation. He said, This person was a fisherman in his past life, fond of snake soup. He fished year after year until he encountered a storm and was swallowed by a great whale. In this life, he's fortunate to become human. A Daoist riding the wind will appear, with mana and true essence like rivers. He is the reincarnation of a serpent dragon. If he can convert this person and thus eliminate evil, he will cultivate a land of bliss within his stomach and become a master monk."

Fahui clapped his hands repeatedly, his eyes shining with divine light. He laughed and said, "I see... this must be it! No wonder I felt uncontrollable anger at the sight of this person... It was destiny and fate!"

The old monk laughed heartily and continued, "I then asked, is there a chance for him to become The Merciful One?"

Fahui's eyes widened at this and he licked his lips, staring intently at the old monk. "What was the answer?" he asked eagerly, his eyes gleaming in anticipation.

The old monk deliberately paused. Fahui, already hot-tempered, grew impatient and shouted, "Abbot! Do not keep me in suspense. Tell me quickly!"

"Hahahaha!"

The old monk laughed loudly and said, "The Merciful One calculated, listening intently, and after a long while answered, He must seek the great whale. If he does not survive this ordeal, he will still perish in the belly of the whale dragon."

Everyone exchanged glances, deep in thought, discussing among themselves. Fahui hesitated, then took an artifact handed to him by a fellow monk and said fiercely, "No matter the ordeal, I will convert this heretic and become a master monk!"

With that, Fahui bowed deeply to the old monk, then cupped his fist to the other monks and said loudly, "Fortunately, he mentioned going to Mount Luoxia, so he should not be hard to track. I'll be off now!"

With that, he took off swiftly, leaving a trail of dust behind him. The remaining disciples gathered around the abbot, and one of them said, "Senior Brother Fahui practices the Wrathful Eye technique and is on the verge of a breakthrough. If he can catch that person by surprise, he can still kill him!"

"Indeed!"

They discussed it eagerly among themselves while the old monk's smile faded.

He trembled as he turned away, muttering, "Opportunity is also an ordeal... There is no such thing as a perfect situation..."

Fahui of Duanchen Temple had set his sights on Li Xuanling. Meanwhile, Li Xuanling flew on, crossing field after field, his heart filled with concern. He thought to himself, This Zhao State is full of Buddhist cultivators, and if they are all as crazy as this one... it's too dangerous here! I don't even know where Mount Luoxia is, and it's not a place I must visit. I've been out for a few months; perhaps it's best to return now.

He then changed direction and flew south. It was already late, and as he looked down at the gray-yellow land beneath him in the twilight, he saw tenant farmers sitting around fires. They were listening to monks talking about the suffering of this life and the promise of becoming Maha or Dharma Master in the next. Li Xuanling concealed himself quietly, listening to the ordinary monks speaking with great longing.

Although the tenant farmers were emaciated and covered in scars and dirt, their eyes were bright with hope and yearning. Li Xuanling stood silently in the darkness for a while, listening to their joyful cheers and devout prayers, his heart filled with complex emotions.

"Whether the talk of lands of bliss and reincarnation is true or false, who among the immortals, devils, and Buddhists is right or wrong... The world is filled with deceit and darkness beyond words."

Time on the lake passed as smoothly as the water, the deep blue waves gradually growing colder. Xiao Xian once again brought several family servants to Lijing Town, sitting nervously under the main hall.

"Brother Xiao!" Li Yuanping called out, his face pale. He smiled as he sat at the head of the hall, looking down at Xiao Xian. "We have not seen each other for a few months, and your cultivation has improved greatly!" he commended with a smile.

Xiao Xian's talent was mediocre, having just broken through to the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Li Yuanping's words were naturally flattery, and Xiao Xian simply smiled and let it pass. After sitting for a while, not knowing how to start the conversation, Li Yuanping decided to take the initiative and asked, "What brings you here today, Brother Xiao?"

Xiao Xian nodded, organizing his thoughts before replying respectfully, "I am now eighteen, and my family is preparing to find a wife for me..."

Hearing this, Li Yuanping immediately understood his intentions. He stroked his chin and thought, Qingxiao is now thirteen or fourteen... Mount Yu's branch probably wants to settle this matter early, fearing problems later.

Xiao Xian paused and then continued sincerely, "You probably already know, but I have admired Lady Qingxiao for a long time and sincerely wish to marry her. Could you convey my feelings to the elders and the lady herself? If it is agreeable, my family will send a proposal."

Li Yuanping rubbed the jade cup in his hand. Marriage proposals between clans were not made rashly. Typically, someone would first sound out the other party to ensure a positive response before formally proposing. Xiao Xian was now bringing this matter forward formally.

After all, for a clan, a direct rejection would be a blatant insult. Giving prior notice prevented awkwardness and enmity from forming if the proposal was unsuccessful.

Li Yuanping nodded, put down his teacup, and said solemnly, "Brother Xiao has helped me greatly... I will not stand idly by. I will inquire and speak well of you. You can expect good news."

Xiao Xian had gone through all this trouble for this assurance. Seeing Li Yuanping agree without asking for anything in return, he felt deeply relieved and grateful. "Thank you very much, Young Master!" he expressed sincerely.

Li Yuanping smiled, and the two chatted about various topics. Suddenly, Li Yuanping remembered something and asked, "Earlier this year, a devil cultivator named Murong Xia passed through our territory... He was quite domineering. Do you know what became of him?"

"Murong Xia?" Xiao Xian repeated as he thought for a moment and replied, "Does he cultivate the Virtuous Benevolence Devil Dao? The one who nurtures a human head in his belly? I have heard some things about him."

"Indeed," Li Yuanping confirmed.

Seeing his affirmation, Xiao Xian became more spirited and replied, "This person went south after passing through your family's territory. In our land, he devoured hundreds of people, acting as if everyone were treated equally. He claimed that they all went to enjoy themselves in his belly."

Li Yuanping remained silent, feeling a stir in his heart, and asked, "I heard my brother mention this person. From your perspective, is this so-called land of bliss real?"

Xiao Xian sneered and answered, "Whether it is real or not, I do not know. I would rather die than enter it! Even if it is true, what good is pleasure when you're under someone else's control?"

He paused and smirked sarcastically before continuing, "As for this Murong Xia, it is said that after devouring 16,756 people, he will become a Maha. He must have some incredible background, with many Master Monks and Merciful Ones escorting him. Even our family had to respectfully send him off."

He took a sip from his tea bowl and continued, "I thought he was some great Dharma Master, but he deliberately avoided the territory of the Yue Cultivating Sect... I guess he was scared."

Li Yuanping suddenly understood and, after a moment of thought, replied, "Could it be the Sword Immortal Daoist Master Shangyuan? Being both a Sword Immortal and at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm, even Murong Xia would not dare provoke him."

Xiao Xian nodded and said, "Exactly. Excluding the Golden Core Realm cultivators, Daoist Master Shangyuan is the strongest in this region. The vast land of Xu State belonging to the Yue Cultivating Sect proves this. Daoist Master Shangyuan cares for the common people and clans. If Murong Xia dared to flaunt his ways there, not even a few Merciful Ones could save him."

The two chatted in detail for a while, but Xiao Xian seemed restless. Seeing this, Li Yuanping laughed and said softly, "Please wait a moment, brother. I will go up the mountain and inquire for you."
