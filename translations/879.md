# Chapter 879: Secluded Cultivation

Moongaze Lake.

The sky was hazy, but the lake was bathed in light. On the Viewing Pavilion Platform, the Li Fire surged, sending a column of flame into the sky. Li Ximing strode across the light, his gaze sweeping over the platform. The refinement of the Shichuan was progressing well; Chu Minglian was presently observing it, carefully deciding when to stoke the flames.

He was in high spirits. Nodding to himself, he stepped onto Gardenia Scenery Mountain and sat at the table. The Profound Light between his brows stirred, and he summoned the Radiant Sun King's Halberd.

"A Bright Yang Spiritual Artifact."

While both Spiritual Artifacts and spirit embryos served as weapons for the Purple Mansion Realm, they were worlds apart. A spirit embryo couldn't compare in combat, and a Spiritual Artifact was a treasure that could be passed down for generations. As Li Ximing refined the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, he realized just how different this weapon truly was.

Compared to the meager three abilities of his Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, the Radiant Sun King's Halberd boasted a full five!

Two of these abilities, its primary functions, had been mentioned by Tian Sanglin. The first was [Splitting Light], described as a power that "Shatters evil, punishes rebellion. It is not lightly granted, and when it moves, it kills."

This [Splitting Light] was the halberd's sole offensive ability, imbued with the foe-shattering might of the Bright Yang. Its one weakness was its speed—it was incredibly slow to strike. If it missed, the next attack would be severely weakened, even if the same amount of dharma power and divine ability was channeled into it.

According to Tian Sanglin, [Splitting Light] was derived from the Bright Yang divine ability Crimson Severing Arrowhead, which was likely the source of this limitation.

The second ability was [Radiance]. Its purpose was to "illuminate the land and its people." When the Spiritual Artifact was raised high, it could bestow a blessing upon allies.

Li Ximing examined it briefly. For a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, the ability was decent but not spectacular. When attached to his dharma body, it was like a weaker version of his Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption, though fortunately, it came with far fewer restrictions.

'The crucial part is that Earth-elemental and Bright Yang don't conflict,' he thought. 'This means I can use both blessings simultaneously. It'll make fighting the Merciful One much easier.'

After all, Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption couldn't defend against the Twelve Qis or Fire Virtue—its limitations were too severe. It wouldn't offer much of an advantage against Immortal cultivators. Thus, Li Ximing's reflexive "hypothetical enemy" was, naturally, the Buddhist cultivators.

Beyond these two combat abilities, the remaining three were far more interesting. Tian Sanglin hadn't mentioned them, likely because they could only be activated by catalyzing them with a Bright Yang divine ability. The one Li Ximing valued most was called [Mandate].

"Strong, it dominates; weak, it invites disaster. It bears the weight of an empire and sweeps away all obstacles... That wasn't just empty rhetoric. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd's power is truly influenced by my Bright Yang divine abilities. Right now, its power is merely average. But the more Bright Yang abilities I master, the stronger it will become. With Purple Mystery as the threshold, anything less than three abilities is actually a weakened state. Once I achieve grand completion in Bright Yang and unite all five abilities, this weapon... it might not be any weaker than the Ancient Spiritual Artifacts."

Li Ximing felt a mix of envy and bitterness. He hadn't even crossed the threshold of the Purple Mystery; achieving grand completion in Bright Yang felt like a distant fantasy. For now, he pinned his hopes on Li Zhouwei, which felt like the right move.

The last two were minor abilities: [Flame-Spitting] and [Improper Bestowal].

[Flame-Spitting] was clearly just a small perk. When the Radiant Sun King's Halberd was summoned, it would grant Li Ximing a mouthful of Li Fire to spew, slightly more potent than the kind found in Juque Palace, but not a significant boost.

"Used together with my Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire, I suppose it's a nice little bonus."

Having familiarized himself this far, Li Ximing was thoroughly satisfied. The only exception was [Improper Bestowal], which he found rather exasperating.

'The Mandate cannot be improperly bestowed; once given, it signifies it cannot be controlled.'

This ability, [Improper Bestowal], had only one function: it prevented the Radiant Sun King's Halberd from being casually lent to others.

Normally, be it a dharma artifact or a Spiritual Artifact, as long as the owner agreed and opened their spiritual connection, it could be temporarily lent. This was how Li Ximing had been able to use Kui Qi's Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass. Kui Qi remained the artifact's true master; he had simply lent it to Li Ximing.

By doing this, even though Li Ximing couldn't wield it with perfect proficiency and spent more dharma power to use its abilities, the ownership never changed. This avoided the messy business of imbuing it with his own divine abilities and mitigated many other risks. For instance, if Kui Qi desperately needed it, he could summon the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass to traverse the Great Void and return to him. And if Li Ximing refused to return it, not only would it take him much longer to refine, but Kui Qi could also use their connection to track him down.

But the halberd's ability completely eliminated this possibility. Once this weapon was given to someone, it *had* to be returned voluntarily. Otherwise, the Spiritual Artifact would be lost for good, like a stone sinking into the ocean.

'An ability like this actually exists... No wonder Tian Sanglin said it couldn't be lent out...'

He weighed the Spiritual Artifact in his hand, immensely satisfied. In terms of both its abilities and its raw power, the Radiant Sun King's Halberd was on a completely different level than the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger.

The Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger's Geng Tiger Evasion ability had certainly played a vital role when he was fleeing for his life, but on a normal day, it felt rather useless. He mused internally:

"It's not just the difference between the Spiritual Artifacts. It's probably also because I'm not an Earth-elemental cultivator."

As for the halberd's other miscellaneous functions—like being stored within his Profound Light or emitting a bright glow—these were just minor abilities tied to his divine abilities, nice extras but nothing more.

He absorbed the Spiritual Artifact into the Profound Light between his brows and began to meticulously nourish and refine it with his divine ability. By the time he finished, day had turned to night outside. He finally rose and summoned Li Jiangqian.

Soon, Li Jiangqian arrived, ascending the mountain with a jade box in his hands. He bowed and said, "Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing smiled and mentioned his acquisition of the Radiant Sun King's Halberd. Li Jiangqian looked up, pleasantly surprised, and offered repeated congratulations. Li Ximing simply waved him off, not wishing to dwell on it, and motioned for him to begin his report.

Li Jiangqian opened the long jade box, revealing a pure black Dharma Sword nestled within. The moment Li Ximing's eyes fell upon the sword's shape, his expression flickered, and he shot to his feet.

He first used the Immortal Mirror to ensure they were alone. Only then did he take the Dharma Sword and scrutinize it. "It truly is," he murmured, his eyes narrowing, "the resemblance is uncanny."

Li Jiangqian nodded deeply. He reported all the details surrounding its discovery before continuing:

"During the time you were away, my lord... I sent out orders to investigate the four Dharma Swords. Besides our Black Creek, the other three—Falling Cassia, Sea-Parting, and Heart-Piercing—are in the possession of Bai Yinzi, Han Li, and Song Yunbai, respectively."

"The Converging Water sword is held by a cultivator named Han Li. We don't know where he came from; I've only ever heard you mention his name. We have no other information on him. Acquiring that one will be difficult."

"The Li Fire sword, Heart-Piercing, is with Song Yunbai. This one should be the easiest to acquire. While Song Yunbai isn't in Capital immortals, her family resides within the Hall of the Locust Soul's territory. We've already managed to obtain an illustration of it."

He retrieved a scroll from his sleeve and gently unfurled it. It revealed a masterful painting of a crimson Dharma Sword. It had more intricate patterns than Black Creek and was slightly longer.

"Not only was the color wrong, but it also lacked any ornament on the pommel. It was clear: this Heart-Piercing sword can be ruled out."

"Bai Yinzi's Falling Cassia is of the Supreme Yin attribute. After parting ways with you, my lord, he appeared in the great desert. We sent men to make inquiries and received word from the Zhuang family. They said he was traveling due north, toward the great river."

"As for his sword... Zhuang Cheng reported that the blade was sheathed, so he couldn't see its form. However, a part of the hilt was visible, and it was gray. Unfortunately... he also said... he did not see any ornament attached."

Li Ximing's gaze darkened. "The lack of an ornament means little," he said quietly. "He might have simply stored it. After all, the fragment looks like a common trinket. Bai Yinzi would have no way of knowing its true purpose. He probably just tossed it into his storage pouch."

"This man... must be watched closely!"

"Since he passed through the desert, the Golden Feather Sect likely has news of him. But if he's heading north, he's bound for the Golden Tang Gate's territory... We should ask the Golden Feather Sect about that sword. Fortunately, since it's a Dharma Sword, our family has a legitimate reason to inquire about trading for it."

"Your junior sent a few people to investigate, but I dared not be too conspicuous. If it weren't a sword, I wouldn't have dared send anyone to even look..."

Li Jiangqian cupped his hands. "Regarding the north, a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from the Hall of the Locust Soul fell yesterday. It's clear you've already made your move, my lord. The Capital immortals Dao also lost another Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator a few days ago. Guan Gongxiao has pulled his forces back, and the demonic cultivators have now secured their foothold."

He retrieved a small letter from his sleeve and said in a low voice, "Guan Gongxiao is requesting aid again, hoping our family will intervene."

Li Ximing gave a noncommittal grunt.

Years ago, Yehui had plotted against his family on Changxiao's behalf, holding back his strength and harboring ulterior motives. Li Ximing had barely escaped with his life. Though he had no fondness for the man, he had always instructed his family to maintain stable relations with Capital immortals.

Yehui, for his part, also seemed unwilling to completely sever ties. He had kept his peace during the years Li Ximing was away. But that didn't mean he was weak. The man had obtained the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition and possessed several Spiritual Artifacts. He was not someone to be trifled with.

Since Li Ximing still didn't know Changxiao's whereabouts, he decided it was best to show some goodwill to Capital immortals. The fact that Li Jiangqian had brought this message to him directly suggested he felt the same. "Send word back to him," Li Ximing said.

"Tell him I have given my word. He is to hold his mountain gate. He only needs to wait a while longer."

Li Jiangqian bowed and nodded. Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. "Three years have passed since that personage reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. The Hall of the Locust Soul has little strength left to resist him. He intends to travel north and will likely depart within a year or two. Pay close attention to the sword. I just hope it isn't that spirit embryo."

Li Jiangqian acknowledged the order. He then said softly, "There is one more matter to report, Daoist Master. Uncle-Grandpa Li Chengzhi... he passed away some time ago."

Li Ximing's fingers tightened on his jade cup. He finally let out a sigh. "I know," he said quietly.

Given Li Jiangqian's control over the clan, he naturally knew Li Ximing had already seen Li Chengzhi. He immediately lowered his head and shifted the topic. "On a better note..."

"Fortunately... after Uncle Zhouming finished handling your affairs, he took the pills the family had prepared and successfully broke through to the eighth level of Qi Refining. We are now preparing to have him consume that Talisman Pill to reach the ninth level, so he can attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm."

"Good."

Li Ximing nodded, then asked, "How are the family's sacrificial rites? You did not request a talisman, I trust."

"I did not."

Li Jiangqian bowed. "Now that the Purple Mansion Grand Array is in place, we conducted the rite with incense and obtained three Talisman Pills. As for Talisman Seeds... most of the children in the family are not yet of age. Although our Jiangque direct line has many cultivators, fertility has been poor... My younger brothers remain unwed."

He offered the three pills to Li Ximing, smiling. "Some time ago, I considered receiving a talisman to better help the family, but we lacked a grand array for concealment... Now, there's no rush. After all, this junior is only in the early Foundation Establishment Realm, and my cultivation speed is still fast. I can either wait to receive a talisman after I break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, using the Talisman Qi to enhance my divine abilities... or, at worst, I'll seek it during the middle or late stage of my current realm."

"Therefore, the Old Master presided over the rite this time. I did not participate."

Li Ximing nodded and sighed. "That's wise. The world is full of cultivators trapped in the later stages of Qi Refining or Foundation Establishment Realm, grinding away for countless hours. It's only when you reach the Purple Mansion Realm that you realize *divine abilities* are the real bottleneck... No miracle pill, no matter how potent, adds more than a tiny fraction of progress..."

Speaking of which, Li Jiangqian offered a reminder. "Since you have already broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, Daoist Master, you can consume a Talisman Pill again. The 'Sacrificial Rites Method' states that the pill can break barriers and advance one's cultivation. It should be effective for divine abilities as well."

Li Ximing fell into thought. "I have considered this," he replied. "I'm still weighing it. Since you brought it up, you can speak your mind."

"I did acquire and consume many spirit medicines during my time overseas. My Audience with the Celestial Gate has already reached the minor completion stage, and I still have two spirit pills left. By stacking all these, I'm not far from grand completion... I was thinking it would only take another five or six years of effort anyway. Better to save the Talisman Pill... and use it for my *next* divine ability."

Li Jiangqian understood perfectly. He bowed low. "My lord, once you head north and return to the mountains, Jiangbei will erupt in conflict. There will be many great battles, and not just with the Daoist Masters of the Immortal Dao. I fear the Buddhist cultivators from the north will also intervene... When that time comes, it will not be simple."

Li Ximing rose, clasping his hands behind his back. "You're right... My urgent search for Spiritual Artifacts is for this very reason. It won't just be mainland Daoist Masters. I expect cultivators from both the mainland and overseas will come to spectate. Even if they can't get a piece of the Child of Destiny, someone like Fei Qingya is practically a supreme spirit medicine in their eyes. Besides, that personage is generous. After all these years, do you think people like Fei Tongcai or Bai Yinzi haven't received any benefits? And that's not even counting those who will simply try to fish in troubled waters..."

His expression was calm, but his tone was firm. "Now that we have a lead, everything else is secondary. The fragment absolutely cannot be lost. I can't afford to gamble. I will write a letter to Ning Wan, and then immediately enter seclusion. I'll use the Talisman Pill to force my divine ability to grand completion."

"Regardless of when the True Monarch departs for the north, he is set to return in six years and six months. That group will only make their move once his return is confirmed. We have more than enough time."

Li Jiangqian nodded. With his hands still behind his back, the Daoist Master continued, "Fortunately, with the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven in existence, there is no shortage of Bright Yang spiritual items and Spiritual Artifacts in the world. They are far easier to acquire than those of other Daoist traditions. Once this is done, I must continue the search for more Spiritual Artifacts!"

"For now, focus all your efforts on tracking Bai Yinzi!"

He dismissed Li Jiangqian. After writing the letter to Ning Wan, he sealed the grand array, took out the Talisman Pill, enveloped it in his divine ability, and consumed it.

Since breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, Li Ximing had taken spirit pills on several occasions. Even the very best of them had only managed to make his divine ability stir faintly, inching it forward like a starved donkey turning a heavy millstone. But the moment he consumed the Talisman Pill, the divine ability within him seemed to connect with some profound aura, and it instantly began to seethe.

A powerful rumble echoed within him. The raw spiritual energy provided by the Talisman Pill was a drop in the ocean for a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, yet it felt as though it had unlocked a hidden gate. His divine ability began to circulate spontaneously. Overjoyed, Li Ximing immediately consumed a Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill. His internal dharma power surged, supporting the divine ability as it erupted in boundless light.
