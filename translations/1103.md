# Chapter 1103: Azure Moon's Homecoming

'You?'

The grey-robed cultivator glanced left and right, suspicion rising in his heart. He saw Li Minggong hesitate for a moment and then actually retreat. The unknown Heaven–Governing cultivator was even more decisive, simply riding the wind away.

The Li Clan was hardly an unknown family these days. The cultivator from Mount Changhuai immediately grew vigilant, sneering inwardly,

'Looks like they have some skill... But this level of contempt? Has my Mount Changhuai been secluded for so long that people think they can walk all over us?'

But the yellow-robed cultivator behind him simply clasped his hands behind his back, his gaze fixed cautiously on the sword light pulsing from the youth's hand. His immortal foundation flared with a warning, and he replied,

"Junior Brother Shancao, we must be careful."

Li Nitan, however, was observing them secretly, his mind racing.

'Who is this now? He looks incredibly young, must be a direct descendant. But I've never heard of any junior from the Li Clan with such mastery of the Way of the Sword. And those two... they aren't surnamed Qing. So arrogant one moment, yet they backed down so easily...'

While the two long-robed cultivators exchanged wary whispers, Li Jiangchun took a step forward. This was his first true life-and-death battle, and he held nothing back. He attacked with brazen, full-force!

Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record.

The Profound Mystery core within him responded instantly. A rolling, illusory radiance gathered, forming a nimbus of light behind his head as large as a prayer cushion, shining brilliantly. An infinite confluence of flames coalesced, draping over him in a multi-colored cloak.

The grey-robed cultivator before him was no slouch. He had already summoned his own dharma artifact—a grey-qi gourd hovered in front, a small, dark sword above it. But this action seemed to serve only as a reminder to the youth. In an instant, a cascade of dharma artifacts flew forth from Li Jiangchun—a white fan, a separation banner, a pearl-adorned sword—each one flaring with light!

Not only were the artifacts numerous, but every single one was a high-quality item, superior to his own. The cultivator, Shancaozi, felt his expression darken. He intoned,

"Let verdant life flourish, let hidden streams flow, when the great wood rots, the earth shall rise!"

Fertile Mire's Rule.

His immortal foundation surged. Colors seemed to precipitate from the air, condensing into a deep, turbid aura of mud. It layered itself thickly, threatening to smother all the surrounding metal, water, and wood qi, absorbing them without end.

This man cultivated Treasured Earth, a natural counter to sharp, aggressive attacks.

But the only thing that rose to meet it was a single, bright sword light, like a crescent moon, vast as a giant sail. In a flash, the light condensed into the shape of a swimming fish and drifted past.

The spell art, built upon the Treasured Earth immortal foundation, was caught completely off guard. First, it was scorched by a deluge of falling True Fire. Then, before the ethereal sword light, it became as dull and rigid as a stone, allowing the "fish" to easily slip past it.

'Sword Origin...'

The grey-robed cultivator's heart sank. The grey gourd he had activated barely managed to block his front, but the Celestial Moon Sword Arc blatantly swatted it aside. Before he could even feel a moment of relief, he felt a sudden, piercing chill on his neck.

All his retreating dharma artifacts were intercepted. Worse, a wave of Profound Qi and baleful energy surged toward him. A talismanic light screen, bright as glazed glass, flared to life, but it was a step too slow. Three large holes had already appeared in his chest. Three bright, agile sword lights, shielded by the Mansion Water profound light of the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record, had at some unknown moment burrowed into his organs and were now wreaking havoc.

"Ah?"

The cultivator's mind went blank. Even Li Jiangchun paused, surprised by the speed of it all. But his final attack, the Autumn Moon's Accord, was already descending.

This sword light fell like the last, drifting autumn rain of heaven and earth. It struck the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from Mount Changhuai, who erupted into a shower of blood, earth, and stone.

The scene was one of visceral impact, yet the sword light that fluttered down was as gentle as a spring breeze, carrying no lingering might. It was this discrepancy that left the yellow-robed cultivator frozen in place, his mind reeling with horror and disbelief.

"It... it must be an illusion."

Shancaozi wasn't a top-tier expert, or he wouldn't have been sent on this kind of mission. But he was, nonetheless, a proper cultivator of Mount Changhuai. To be slain in three moves by a nobody?

'He was dispatched as easily as a Qi Refining scrub!'

And he, standing just three feet away, had felt no threat, no killing intent!

'Even... even when Chi Buzi killed our cultivator in the grotto-heaven... even with his cultivation suppressed... it took him twelve full moves!'

Killed in three moves?

It wasn't that such figures didn't exist. Back then, Duanmu Kui, blessed by the 'Earth Wu-Shaman', had killed a Wuzhu Gate cultivator with a single talisman. But such people weren't nameless! And their Mount Changhuai was worlds above the Wuzhu Gate!

It wasn't that this cultivator's mind was weak. On the contrary, his logic was too firm. The Sword Origin, Crescent Moon, had been utterly devoid of killing intent, which made the event before him seem impossible. He could only conclude it was a powerful illusion.

And so, he hesitated for half a step.

It was precisely this half-step of hesitation that sealed his fate. Amidst the rain of earth and stone, a sword light ignited anew, locking onto him. Only then did a suffocating sense of crisis finally engulf his mind.

But the nearby Li Nitan, after a brief moment of terror, had already shot away like an arrow loosed from a bow.

He fled as if he had seen a ghost, pure fear driving him westward. But he didn't get far before three streaks of escaping light—one in front, two behind—sped toward him. The leader wielded a jet-black sword, his face gloomy and his gaze fierce as it landed on Li Nitan.

Chen Yang was already in the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. He had been suppressing his opponents when he suddenly received orders to retreat from the west. Discovering he had lost many of his trusted followers along the way, he was fuming. Seeing someone now trying to cut off his escape, he was both furious and cautious. With a flick of his long sword, he brazenly stabbed forward.

Chen Yang was the undisputed number one genius of the Four Surnames, and his strike was menacing. Li Nitan, seeing the man try to intercept him even while fleeing for his own life, had no choice but to summon a dharma artifact and parry casually.

"Clang!"

Li Nitan was frantic, with no time to get entangled. He blocked the blow and, without a backward glance, continued his desperate flight. This left Chen Yang stunned, a flicker of doubt in his mind.

'What was that? Did he just fly over to take a hit?'

But in that instant, the earth shook and mountains swayed. A great rain fell, and a sword light leaped through the air, flashing in Chen Yang's eyes. The gloomy, suspicious cultivator froze on the spot.

Li Nitan, however, understood that both Mount Changhuai cultivators had fallen. His heart was consumed by terror. He surged his dharma power and roared, his voice shaking the heavens:

"Quickly, save me!"

With the Tanshan Li Clan's Daoist Master injured and gone, Li Nitan was in command. His status in the Shu army was not low; all the Foundation Establishment cultivators recognized him. His shout brought the entire battlefield to a halt. A large contingent of cultivators broke formation and began moving toward him.

In truth, the yellow-robed cultivator's cultivation had been higher, and he had been far more cautious than the first. Even with Li Jiangchun's advantages in dharma artifacts, Dao-Profundity, and spell arts, finishing him would have taken time. Li Jiangchun had only managed to wound him with ten strikes before suppressing him with his artifacts. By then, Li Nitan had fled too far, deep into the enemy ranks. He was beyond pursuit. Out of caution, Li Jiangchun had already decided to let him go.

But that one shout intimidated the entire west bank and threw the Shu army into chaos. This, instead, made Li Jiangchun's eyes light up. He immediately reached back and gripped the hilt of the azure-edged sword on his back.

'If I cut this man down, I'll shatter their will to fight!'

Even if Li Nitan fled a hundred li, he still had a way.

'It's just... my control isn't perfect. Killing him is best... but even a heavy wound would be enough to stun them...'

He grasped the hilt, gathering his power to draw. But as he did, an unexpected feeling of connection, as if to his own flesh and blood, surged through his heart. In an instant, clear qi erupted from his Qihai acupoint. Infinite profound meanings bloomed in his mind. Deep in his sea of consciousness, in an expanse of Limitless, he saw an azure sword.

"Clang!"

The world shifted. Wind and clouds surged. Countless sword hums vibrated through the air, and every sheathed long sword began to tremble. Every cultivator on the battlefield looked up, their expressions of pure, uncomprehending shock.

Li Minggong, who had been worried about Li Jiangchun advancing too deep and was rushing back from the east, stopped dead in her tracks and stared.

She saw the youth in the sky, his eyes an eerie azure-white. A sword mark had materialized between his brows, adding a fearsome killing intent to his once-elegant features. The waning moon had waxed full, its sharpness infinite!

He drew his sword!

Yet, there was no sky-filling sword light, no vast sword qi. All the sword light condensed onto the blade's edge, faintly emerging, transforming into infinite illusions.

Only a single sheet of azure-white light flashed past.

"Clang."

The azure-edged sword was already back in its sheath.

Far in the distance, Li Nitan turned his head with agonizing slowness, his features frozen in a dazed stupor.

'Sword... Intent...'

Li Jiangchun was already incredibly profound on the path of Sword Origin. Now, holding the Qingchi, he had sensed the Way of the Sword inheritance. This attack was not just the fourth form of the Celestial Moon Sword Codex, following Autumn Moon's Accord. It was a strike propelled by Sword Intent!

Azure Moon's Homecoming!

Li Nitan's head flew high, revealing the neat, smooth muscle and bone of his severed neck. His three mansions were simultaneously annihilated, all profound mystery extinguished. His body, not yet registering its own death, drifted forward a short distance before plummeting from the sky.

"Boom!"

A plume of grey clouds and yellow earth blasted into the air.

Like the helpless Chi family prodigy under a single sword strike all those years ago, this direct grandson of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Tanshan Li Clan—was slain on the spot from a hundred li away!

Sword Intent was devastating even in divine ability-level combat, let alone at the Foundation Establishment Realm! Without achieving a divine ability, one simply could not restrain Sword Intent. Moreover, the current Li Jiangchun, from his cultivation method to his full set of dharma artifacts, was at the absolute apex of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

'Sword Intent!'

Chen Yang's pupils dilated to pinpricks. His face was drenched in cold sweat, his cheek stinging with pain. He stood motionless in the sky, listening as the sword immortal's ice-cold voice reverberated through the heavens,

"Those who advance east... die."

"Boom!"

The advancing cultivators stopped. The battlefield fell utterly silent.

In an instant, the Ting Province cultivators were overcome with a mix of joy and shock. The steadily retreating battle line had brazenly halted, locked in a tense stalemate. Li Suining was suddenly overjoyed, a realization dawning on him:

'With General Ding here... dragging it out for that one hour... it truly made a difference!'

He turned his head eagerly, only to find Li Minggong staring blankly, her expression a knot of complexity. She muttered,

"Back then... when the elder defended the river... he looked just like this."

It was the same feat—one person halting an army, one shout stopping the enemy. But the first emotion that welled up in the woman's heart was fear. Panic seized her.

'Where is the Daoist Master... Where is Uncle... I'm afraid someone... will try to harm him!'

...

Great Void.

A shining Celestial Gate stood in the vastness of the Great Void. A man in platinum Daoist robes sat casually beneath it, toying with a wisp of bright white flame between his fingertips. It was dazzling, yet encircled by a faint grey ring.

Not far away, two divine abilities were madly entangled. Bright radiance clashed violently as lightning radiance and Bright Yang Heavenly Light warred against each other, sending out wave after wave of power.

The man in the platinum robes paid it no mind. Deep in his eyes was an irrepressible joy. A golden-white radiance, seemingly a kind of Life Divine Ability, circled behind him, faintly shrouding down from the Great Void to protect the sword immortal in the mortal world.

On the other side of the Great Void, a pale-faced man stood with his hands behind his back, his expression gloomy. He remained silent for a long time.

As the collision between the two divine abilities grew more intense, the man seemed to aggravate his injuries. He coughed, his voice hoarse.

"Daoist friend... we are the same family, after all. Must you be so utterly ruthless?"

"Same family?" Li Ximing sneered, "My junior is following my orders, defeating enemies and killing generals. I know nothing about any 'same family'."

He flung the man's own words from that day with Li Zhouwei back at him, causing the man's face to pale even further. Only then did Li Ximing continue faintly,

"When your Tanshan Li Clan shunned Moongaze like vipers and called us a 'foreign clan', did you think of 'same family'? When you followed Qing Jifang to raise an army and provoke us, did you think of 'same family'? Now that your cultivators have crossed the border and are slaughtering the common people, have you thought of 'same family'?"

"Now your direct descendant is about to die, and you have to step in to save him... _now_ you remember 'same family'."

He gave a cold laugh.

"Lord Li doesn't fuss over bloodlines, and he has many descendants. He probably won't miss this one."

The pale-faced, middle-aged man before him was none other than Li Muyan of the Tanshan Li Clan—Li Nitan's biological grandfather!

He had sought injury and received it, having been badly beaten by Li Zhouwei. He had only just managed to heal when Qing Jifang, who clearly didn't regard him as human, hurriedly dispatched him to the Great Western Plateau. He suffered a crushing defeat, and now he had dragged his injured body all the way to the great desert to hold the line.

Only upon arriving did he discover that his own grandson, the key direct descendant the Tanshan Li Clan relied on to defend the desert, had been sent by the Qing family with two men from Mount Changhuai deep into the Li heartland to do this!

'This is a blatant setup! It's designed to harm someone! Either the Ting Province people get hurt by me, or he gets killed by the Ting Province people!'

It hadn't been long since his breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm. The seniors in his family were still alive, so no great treasures had been passed down to him. Riddled with injuries, how could he dare to provoke Li Ximing? He could only stand there silently in the Great Void.

The coldness in his heart was palpable.

'That bastard Qing never treats people as people, but I never imagined he could be this cruel... He's too stingy to even spare a token reward, a thin disguise... It's... it's reached this point!'

Li Ximing saw it all clearly and said coldly,

"You know full well how the Tanshan Li Clan came to be... Whether you've cut ties cleanly is hard to say, but you're certainly efficient at betrayal!"

"I also know your esteemed clan faces... difficulties. Allow me to accommodate you!"

His intentions laid bare, Li Muyan was mortified, and even more, terrified. He gave Li Ximing a deep look, and seeming to bite back his anger, he ground out through his teeth,

"This generous gift from your esteemed clan... the Tanshan Li Clan will remember it."

These words actually made Li Ximing stand up and laugh uproariously. His gaze burned like fire and lightning as it fixed on Li Muyan. He flicked his sleeves and cursed with a grin,

"Good for you, Li Muyan! Daring to vent your anger on me? Everyone knows you have Qing Jifang at your back. He uses you like a dog, and you lap it up. You dare cross the border and talk tough to my face? If not for him, what the hell do you think you are!"

He laughed.

"Come... come on over. King Wei will be here any moment. If you fucking dare to repeat those exact words to him, I'll even count you as a man!"
