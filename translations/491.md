# Chapter 731: Chaos

Just as he finished speaking, the sky outside the central hall suddenly flashed. Several streaks of light flew from north to esouth, leaving long trails across the sky. To the south, five bursts of Heavenly Glow rose into the air, dyeing half the sky red.

As the Heavenly Glow drew near, its true form was revealed. A cloudship wreathed in golden light, with wings like mist unfurled at its sides. It cut through layers of cloud, and atop it stood a gathering of shadowy figures.

"The Dawn Cloudliner..."

Li Xizhi frowned and glanced upward. The command token at his waist began to glow, each engraved character lit up one by one. His expression turned grave as he stared intently at the sky.

Figures scattered across the Dawn Cloudliner, and dazzling lights streamed southward from the north. Li Xizhi calmed his brothers, then rose on his own ribbon of glow, cloaked in swirling mist, and approached the cloudship.

He activated the glow in his hand and channeled his command token. Immediately, someone aboard the ship rode the wind over to him. The man's face was somewhat familiar. After a moment of scrutiny, he recognized Li Xizhi as well.

The man was short and plump, with a well-fed appearance. As he neared Li Xizhi, he opened his mouth and said, "Daoist friend..."

Only then did he recognize Li Xizhi’s cultivation level. His expression changed at once, plastering on a wide smile as he respectfully said, "Ah! Greetings, Senior! It's been so many years... and you've already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

"So it’s you!" exclaimed Li Xizhi.

The man before him was Yu Fuyu of Lingdou Peak. Years ago, when Li Xizhi had still been in the Qi Cultivation Realm, he had arranged a trade of sect duties with this very man to secure a trip home.

Though he was from the Yu Family, he had long severed ties with them, living modestly and alone. Afraid of Li Xizhi’s background, he now greeted him with excessive deference, "Senior, your cultivation has progressed with incredible speed!"

Though Li Xizhi’s progress had been swift, he couldn’t compare to his own younger brother and was considered only upper-mid tier within the sect. He paid no mind to the flattery and asked directly, "What’s going on here?"

Yu Fuyu quickly said, "Senior, Yue Cultivating Sect has sealed its mountains and withdrawn deep inside. All cultivators stationed from the north of Xu State to the Eastern Sea have pulled out completely, they’ve abandoned the front entirely.

"As a result, the large swath of Buddhist cultivators in northern Yue State, along with the devil cultivators who’ve been fleeing there year after year, are now completely unsupervised. They’ve already pushed into Xu State!"

He seemed almost animated, saying, "With Yue Cultivating Sect sealing itself off, they’ve tossed all former agreements aside. The nine seaward passes are completely unguarded, without a word of warning. The route from the Eastern Sea to Xu State is wide open, and who knows what kind of chaos is erupting now."

He even showed a hint of pity as he continued, "Poor Xu State... After decades of recovering from turmoil and finally showing some promise, now it’s going to fall into a sea of blood once more."

Li Xizhi felt uneasy hearing this, but the scene before him was becoming clearer. He asked, "So the sect has intervened?"

"Exactly!" Yu Fuyu replied, "Not just Azure Pond Sect, even the Golden Feather Sect has made a move."

Li Xizhi silently calculated the situation, then said with a sigh, "This is getting serious. Have any Purple Mansion Realm cultivators made a move? Has there been any new Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in the sect?"

"None that I’ve seen!" Yu Fuyu nodded repeatedly and quickly added, "Quite a few seniors who attempted breakthroughs have fallen, many of them well-known figures. Like Li Encheng, the Water Wall Pearl, and Mo Chen, the Golden Profound Eagle..."

At this, Li Xizhi’s heart gave a sudden jolt. He thought to himself, So Li Encheng really did fail... Ah, it was something I’d long suspected...

Though thoughts stirred in his heart, his expression remained calm and focused, giving nothing away. The old man before him noticed nothing and went on eagerly, saying, "We’re just the advance group heading to Xu State. The sect has summoned all peak masters, each peak has been assigned duties. Someone’s probably already on their way to fetch you, Senior."

Li Xizhi gave a slight nod. Seeing that the cloudship was about to cross into Xu State, he prepared to ride the wind away, but Yu Fuyu grew anxious and quickly said, "Senior! My Lingdou Peak... we had strong ties with Qingsui in the past! My martial uncle and family elder, Yu Yuxie... he was a close friend of Senior Si Yuanbai...

"I... I’m no good at combat..."

Li Xizhi paused slightly, realization dawning. He thought, So this cloudship is full of those aging cultivators who loaf around the sect... now they’ve been sent to Xu State as the vanguard, it won’t end well for them. No wonder he’s so desperate.

Seeing Yu Fuyu’s tearful expression, Li Xizhi merely said softly, "This isn’t something I can decide on my own. I’ll have to return to the sect first and inquire more carefully. If I can help you find a less dangerous posting, I’ll do what I can."

After he said this, it was clear Yu Fuyu didn’t fully believe him. He barely managed to offer a couple words of thanks before Li Xizhi disappeared on a streak of glow, leaving Yu Fuyu standing there in a daze.

Moments later, a man in platinum-white armor emerged from the ship’s cabin, wielding a long halberd and exuding a commanding presence. He swept his gaze across the crowd, pointed at two people, and said quietly, "You... and you. Come with me."

Tang Shedu! As that finger pointed toward him, a chill ran down Yu Fuyu’s spine.

Li Xizhi descended on the wind and reentered the hall, where his brothers awaited. Seeing the grave look on his face, they exchanged glances. Li Xizhi quietly conveyed the news, and at the head of the hall, Li Xijun pulled out a map.

Xu State was situated between the Wu, Yue, and Zhao States, with a great river running through it. It bordered the Yue Cultivating, Golden Feather, Azure Pond, and several Buddhist and Daoist sects. The point where Azure Pond Sect touched Xu State, right in the middle, was Moongaze Lake.

Now that Yue Cultivating Sect had retracted its forces, it had effectively abandoned most of Xu State, leaving only the isolated Golden Tang Gate behind. Northern Yue had become a blank void, and where the Profound Peak Gate met the Eastern Sea, the shoreline was now untended wilderness. All of the areas connecting to Xu State were about to descend into chaos.

The territory was vast, nearly as large as the entire influence range of Azure Pond Sect. And it sat just north of Moongaze Lake and the Xiao Family.

Li Xijun studied the map closely, his expression grim and his voice heavy, "I’m afraid this won’t bode well for us."

The Li Family and Xiao Family had become the shield of the Azure Pond Sect. In the turmoil to come, they would not escape unscathed. What’s worse, their family had long been enemies with the Buddhist cultivators and now that Yue Cultivating Sect had opened the way, those Buddhist sects could march southward unchecked.

Everyone present had clearly thought the same and remained silent. Li Xizhi sighed and reminded them, "This won’t be simple. Azure Pond Sect will definitely summon every family to contribute forces and send them to Xu State... our family won’t be exempt."

Li Xizhi appeared deeply troubled and said softly, "Beyond that, something big may be brewing... The Three Sects and Seven Gates are stirring restlessly, I doubt there will be peace for long."

The refined man beside him gently shook his head and said warmly, "A time of chaos is coming..."

He paused, hesitating briefly, then said in a low voice, "There is news. Li Encheng has passed."

Li Encheng had been a key connection the Li Family built in the past, thought to be useful when the time came. But fate was unpredictable. By the time of his final meditation, no opportunity had ever arisen to make use of that bond.

Instead, the Li Family had poured quite a bit into him. When he made his final breakthrough attempt, they even sent him a batch of spirit items. Now with this news, all of that had gone to waste.

Li Xuanxuan, listening closely, said in a low voice, "It’s not a total loss... He did give me an Essence Gathering Pill, so at least he didn’t take our help for nothing."

Li Xizhi, occupied with preparing to return to the sect for inquiries, didn’t linger. He cupped his hands to the others and said softly, "Keep watch over the family for now and await my letter."

Li Qinghong rode thunder through the skies for a while, noticing that the seawater beneath her was receding at an extremely slow rate. It was so slow that, without close observation, one might not even realize the sea was slowly drawing back.

"It’s most likely the Dragon Clan making a move. According to the old agreements, everything beneath the sea belongs to them. With the sea receding like this, who knows how many treasures will be lost in just ten days or half a month," she muttered.

She then recalled the spiritual omen of the Eastern Sea, Falling Water, Rising Storm, and found it curious. She had thought it referred to heavy rainfall, but now the sea itself was truly falling, and thunder rumbled even more powerfully overhead.

Continuing to ride the thunder, the Qunyi Strait appeared before her. The once-scattered islets that could barely support a single person were now fully exposed due to the receding tide, revealing vast stretches of shoreline.

Flying another thousand miles eastward, the distant silhouette of Shiqi Island in the Qunyi Strait came into view, followed by the emergence of a large island ahead.

The island was shielded by a radiant golden-red formation, glowing with brilliance. On the newly exposed land from the receding sea, a group of fishermen moved about, dragging brown nets, their faint laughter carrying through the air.

But the laughter quickly vanished as her cultivator aura became visible. Those mortals fell to their knees in fear. Before Li Qinghong could speak, a streak of gold-white light shot toward her.

It was a young woman, about seventeen or eighteen, still youthful in appearance. She held a small golden ring and rode the wind toward Li Qinghong. Eyeing Li Qinghong warily, she asked, "Senior... are you here seeking someone, or...?"

Seeing how guarded the girl was, Li Qinghong responded softly, "I am Li Qinghong, a cultivator from the mainland. I’ve come this time... to inquire about some treasure-related news."

"A mainland cultivator..." These words caused the girl’s brows to relax slightly. She bowed respectfully and replied, "This junior, Cui Wanqing, greets Senior!"

Cui Wanqing paused, a trace of doubt in her eyes, and asked, "Senior... which Li Family do you belong to?"

Li Qinghong paused briefly before replying, "The Moongaze Li Family."

Cui Wanqing silently repeated the four words, guiding her toward the island as she muttered, "I’ve heard there's a great marsh in the mainland called Moongaze... could it be that one?"

Li Qinghong nodded and replied softly, "Correct. The marsh has dried up, leaving only a lake. My family cultivates beside it."

Cui Wanqing nodded thoughtfully and said quietly, "That makes sense. With no one holding the Water Mansion Fruition Attainment, it’s natural that the wetlands would wither."

From her words, it was clear she had inherited knowledge. Li Qinghong followed her down and took a seat in the courtyard while Cui Wanqing went to summon her elders.

This was, after all, the Eastern Sea, where everyone remained cautious of one another. Naturally, Li Qinghong wouldn’t recklessly step into someone else’s formation. The hall Cui Wanqing chose was specifically built on the island for receiving visitors, located safely outside the family’s protective array.

Soon after, an elder appeared at the edge of the courtyard. With solemn white whiskers and a stately posture, he wore a light blue robe. He was tall and spoke in a deep, composed voice, "I am Cui Changfu of Chongzhou Island. Greetings, Daoist friend."

The elder appeared to be of considerable age, with a cultivation at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. His aura was imposing, and as he appraised Li Qinghong, his gaze paused for a moment on the jade bottle at her waist.

Li Qinghong of Moongaze Lake.

Sensing that this elder might be difficult to deal with, Li Qinghong kept silent until the old man sighed and said, "Then Wei Lixun has arrived, has he?"

His tone was strange, and for a moment, Li Qinghong didn’t know how to respond. She simply shook her head lightly. The elder then said, "Please allow me to examine the dharma bottle."

Li Qinghong hesitated but removed it. Still, she grew tense as she worried that this elder, upon seeing the dharma artifact, might covet it and try to seize it from her. She said nothing, her silence heavy with caution.

Cui Changfu paused slightly, then seemed to understand and spoke gently, "The Cui Family of Chongzhou is currently under the protection of the Dragon Clan. We’re not too big, but not insignificant either. We still care about our reputation. I, Cui Changfu, am pretty well known in these waters... I wouldn’t act against someone over a mere Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact.

"Besides... judging by your bearing, I doubt your family is some powerless little force in the mainland."

Li Qinghong subtly assessed the terrain, gauging her distance from the formation. If the man before her were to suddenly attack, she might not win, but with her thunder-riding speed, she was confident she could at least escape. Only then did she relax slightly.

She nodded, offered a few polite remarks, and carefully handed over the dharma artifact. Cui Changfu took it, weighed it in his hand, and dimmed its glow before flipping it over.

The purple, vein-like patterns slowly dimmed, revealing several ancient seal-script characters, ‘Li Qianyuan of the Wei State Li Family.’ Cui Wanqing let out a soft gasp and exclaimed, "The Ancestor of Wei, Li Qianyuan!"

Both of their expressions turned complex, but in Li Qinghong’s ears, the name struck like thunder in a calm sky. She stood stunned for a full breath, "The Ancestor of Wei?"

Of course, Li Qinghong had always known her bottle wasn’t ordinary, that it had once belonged to a cultivator from the Wei State Li Family but she had never imagined it had such a prestigious origin.

Cui Changfu returned it and said in a calm voice, "But the Wei Emperor was no ordinary figure, he wouldn’t have used a mere Foundation Establishment Realm artifact. The authenticity of this item remains questionable.

"After all, I’ve never heard that the Wei Emperor had a dharma artifact shaped like a bottle. Either it was something he used early in life, or it’s a replica crafted by later generations."

At those words, Li Qinghong immediately felt relief, as though a great weight had lifted from her shoulders. She thought, Those True Monarchs... how many of them are simple? If something of his ended up in my hands, it must’ve been part of some grand plan. Even if this one has been dead for years... who can say what immortal arts a True Monarch left behind?

Oddly enough, the possibility that the artifact was a fake brought her comfort. She nodded slightly and tucked it back into her sleeve. Meanwhile, Cui Changfu was studying her closely, watching the subtle shifts in her expression.

Having survived in the Eastern Sea for so many years, Cui Changfu was no fool. His guard had been up from the start, and he thought to himself, Anyone with family history would know about the Cui Clan’s old ties with the Wei State Li Family. This woman’s artifact is far too conspicuous... I have to be cautious that she isn’t posing as a descendant of the Wei State Li Family to exploit us.

But seeing her subtle shifts in expression unfold naturally, he couldn’t quite make up his mind. In the end, he chose to wait and test further. He asked, "And what brings Daoist friend here, if I may ask?"

Li Qinghong nodded and answered directly, not bothering with further pleasantries, "I heard your lineage cultivates in Bright Yang across generations. My family lacks a Bright Yang treasure... so I’ve come here to inquire about it."
