# Chapter 753: Another Job

Chi Buzi burst from the void close behind her, his green robes fluttering. He caught sight of the carnage, and his voice thundered in rage: "Vile demon! I trapped you with my divine abilities, yet you still dare to devour mortals! You are truly courting your own doom! If I fail to capture you today, I will have failed my cultivation!"

The spirit sparrow sped through the air. His words struck her ears, causing every feather on her body to stand on end as fury flooded her chest. 'You... you! You running dog of the Pristine Water, you shameless demonic cultivator! The Azure Pond Sect kills more people in a year than I have feathers on my body, and you have the audacity to lecture *me* about devouring mortals!'

She had cultivated in the overseas realms for many years. With her celestial bearing, she was treated as a Purple Mansion immortal wherever she went. Since achieving true sentience, she rarely consumed mortal flesh. She had only done so now out of absolute desperation. Chi Buzi’s hypocritical scolding left her choking on unspoken bitterness. With no time to even turn and argue, she simply lowered her head and flew desperately onward.

Seeing that she offered no retort, Chi Buzi continued his pursuit, shouting insults as they flew. The two figures flickered in and out of the Great Void, one chasing, one fleeing, until they reached the absolute farthest eastern reaches of the Eastern Sea. The edge of the world was just ahead. The spirit sparrow abruptly wheeled around, tearing back into the Great Void to return the way she came.

Chi Buzi, however, had been patiently herding her eastward this entire time. How could he let her turn back? He shook his head. "Friend, that simply won't do."

He immediately retrieved a cauldron from his sleeve. Tossing it into the air, it instantly swelled to the size of a small house. Chi Buzi chanted an incantation, swept his sleeve across the vessel, and following a clear chime, he declared: "I petition the Palace of Heavenly Aspect to shift its position. Let there be rain."

The spiritual artifact was intrinsically tied to the Pristine Water lineage. As Chi Buzi channeled his power, he simultaneously activated a divine ability. 『Heavy Murk』 manifested as rolling gray qi that spread at terrifying speed, blanketing the sky and sea, casting everything into a gloomy twilight.

The spirit sparrow saw the world ahead of her change abruptly. Rain began to lash the surface of the sea, transforming the world into a boundless expanse of gray. Fear struck her heart, and she immediately fled back into the Great Void.

But Chi Buzi followed close behind. The sparrow flew for some time before he caught up again, forcing her back into the physical world. She blinked, realizing that the Great Void around her had become uniform and placid; she could no longer distinguish any direction or location.

"What kind of spiritual artifact is this!"

She was forced to pick a random spot and return to the physical world. She was met again by the same gray, misty rain. Rolling fog churned below her, obscuring her path and leaving her completely disoriented. Gritting her beak, she plunged into the roiling mist below, only to shoot out an instant later from the rain clouds *above*—colliding directly with Chi Buzi, who waited with his hands clasped behind his back, watching her coldly.

'This spiritual artifact is extraordinary... It's an ancient spirit treasure!'

Chi Buzi’s divine ability did not wait. He had been gathering power, and now a torrent of turquoise Pristine Water crashed down. The sparrow had never cultivated a body divine ability, was already injured, and was weaker than him to begin with. She took the blow head-on. It felt as if her bones and feathers were melting, and she let out a piercing, tragic shriek.

This attack struck at her very life force. The spirit sparrow remanifested in another location, flying blindly, her heart filled with despair. 'All of the Azure Pond Sect’s spiritual artifacts must have ended up in this bastard’s hands! A dignified late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator, armed with three spiritual artifacts and a great array, and he *still* had to resort to ambushes and deception to trap a junior like me…'

But no matter how long she flew, she was caught again, struck by another divine ability. She grew sluggish. Chi Buzi's array had been terrifying enough, and now this ancient spiritual artifact... Her heart turned to ice.

She flew while frantically observing her surroundings. Occasionally, a few small islands would flash past in her vision. This at least proved the spell wasn't forcing her to fly in circles, not as tyrannical as that spiritual artifact belonging to Ning Tiaoxiao...

'But the Eastern Sea is vast! This miraculous artifact, combined with Chi Buzi’s deliberate herding, is more than enough to prevent my escape! How can I just wait inside this spiritual artifact’s rain-curtain, letting his Pristine Water divine ability slice me apart like death by a thousand cuts?'

She was tormented by her predicament, but Chi Buzi never let his guard down. This spirit sparrow had, after all, attained the Dao through the Lesser Yin lineage as an rogue cultivator. Though he had never heard of her acquiring any great opportunities, one could never be careless when facing a Purple Mansion opponent.

He paused slightly, but the spirit sparrow suddenly wheeled around. She unleashed her Lesser Yin divine ability at full power, converging it into streams of white tassels before her. Chi Buzi didn't recognize the specific technique, but he had investigated her background thoroughly and could guess its nature.

'A Lesser Yin divine ability, 『All-Fragrance Sinks』. This power is born from the first blush of splendor and the onset of Yin-cold. It commands cold, yet contains fire; it commands Yin, yet it is dry. Since 『All-Fragrance Sinks』 is a spell art divine ability, it must be a fusion of that cold and dryness, manifesting as flame.'

As he analyzed it, the white tassels indeed erupted with an eerie Yin-fire, vaporizing the surrounding rain into mist. Even the gray fog below showed signs of dissipating. Chi Buzi could not allow that; he simply flicked a finger.

『Clear Dusk Rain』!

A torrential downpour descended, temporarily suppressing the flames. The sparrow pushed her power to the limit, causing the fire to flicker erratically in the rain, becoming unstable. A flicker of regret crossed Chi Buzi’s mind.

'The Lesser Yin's Sovereign Fire of Cold and Dryness should be suppressed by the Pristine Water's Purging Jewel Dew. It is a perfect counter. If I just had that one divine ability, capturing this demon would be effortless. But unfortunately, I never managed to acquire the 『Purging Dew』 ability!'

The Azure Pond Sect's legacy was incomplete. The Qi-gathering method for the associated technique, the *Art of the Dew-Calamity Splendor*, was unattainable. The Chi family had spent years collecting fragments of the technique, but every attempt at gathering the required Qi failed. Therefore, even he, a direct descendant of the Chi family, had been unable to master 『Purging Dew』.

The Pristine Water lineage was clearly dominant, yet gathering the Qi for 『Purging Dew』 always failed. Chi Buzi hadn't dared to overthink it while at the Azure Pond Sect, but out here in the Eastern Sea, the truth was obvious. Who else could it be but the explicit will of their own True Monarch of Pristine Water?

As long as that True Monarch held this intention, all Qi-gathering methods for that specific art were rendered useless. The specific spiritual Qi required by the Chi family’s technique had never been found in any ancient ruin. Chi Rui had tried to use a Pristine-Water harmonization method and repeatedly failed. Chi Wei had also failed to achieve 『Purging Dew』 and had been forced to use 『Horn Wood』 as a substitute to cultivate...

His thoughts were wandering, but the spirit sparrow seized the moment, switching from defense to offense. Her sharp, pale-yellow beak snapped open, revealing rows upon rows of fine, needle-like teeth. A blinding, deep-white brilliance erupted from her throat.

Chi Buzi finally turned serious. His hand seals changed, and the great cauldron burst from the Great Void to shield him. His pupils slowly shifted from pale cyan to a deep, profound turquoise.

『Spring's Echo』!

This potent ability, both a Life and a Body Divine Ability, activated instantly. His physical form dissolved into the water of the Spring's Echo, merging seamlessly into the great cauldron as the tinkling sound of a bubbling spring filled the air.

A full incense stick of time passed before the sparrow’s desperate, life-risking blast of white light finally knocked the great cauldron over with a deafening clang. The spring water was blasted free, but a voice emerged from within the turquoise-gray liquid itself:

"The spring echoes; turbidity rests within the water. Therefore, it neither congeals nor ceases; it neither dries nor halts. Your Sovereign Fire may be strong, but how can it possibly harm me?"

The spring water surged forward, defying the deep-white light, while the great cauldron simultaneously pressed down from above. The brilliance dimmed, and the surrounding gray turbidity thickened once more, sealing her fate.

This single exchange revealed the vast chasm in their Dao attainment. This was a gap the demon could not hope to cross. Despair flooded the spirit sparrow’s heart. She had only just broken through to her realm. How could she fight back? Chi Buzi surpassed her in cultivation, possessed stronger divine abilities, used miraculous arrays and spiritual artifacts, and held a far deeper understanding of the Dao. This was utterly hopeless.

"It's 『Spring's Echo』!"

The spirit sparrow recognized it an instant too late. Realizing he must have activated his core Life Divine Ability, she tried to seize the opening, but it was already gone. The turquoise-gray Pristine Water was already descending upon her.

Chi Buzi remained vigilant. Though the sparrow was trapped, she was not incapable of fighting to the death. If she died here, all his years of careful preparation would be for nothing.

Thus, while maintaining the pressure of the Pristine Water, he allowed his form to reappear, a confident smile of absolute victory on his face. "Friend, do not be alarmed," he said. "I went to all this trouble not to end your life."

The demon did not believe him for a second. "Then let us fight to the death! My abilities may be shallow, but if I burn my life, I can certainly injure you!"

Chi Buzi blinked, his expression turning utterly sincere. He looked earnest, almost righteous. "I truly have no intention of killing you. Our Dao lineages are unrelated, and there is no enmity between us. You possess no great spiritual artifacts or treasures, so why would I harm you? I am merely trying to secure an opportunity related to the Lesser Yin lineage, and I was afraid you might try to seize it. That is why I was forced to take these measures."

The demon remained unconvinced. Chi Buzi kept the Pristine Water divine ability active, continuing: "A fight to the death helps neither of us. Friend, why not take a chance?"

Even as he spoke, a silver-white rope hidden within his sleeve began to glow faintly. He maintained his mask of sincerity, staring at her earnestly, while the pressure from the Pristine Water silently, steadily increased.

***

The World Within the Mirror.

Clouds of mist drifted past bright, translucent white tiles. Several stone lanterns stood in the courtyard, casting a pale yellow light. A young boy with pale-green eyes lay slumped over a stone desk, looking utterly demoralized.

'The *Art of Drumming Profundity Fire Refining*... a True Fire control technique. Let's see... it uses the Path of the Twelve-Storied Pagoda... What ancient era did this technique come from? Gotta fix it...'

Dangjiang listlessly picked up his brush and began making revisions. The pavilion was empty save for two dull-witted, Yellow-Armored Strongmen staring blankly ahead as they carried jade slips upstairs.

Dangjiang had received his promotion, but his workload hadn't lessened, and the number of people he saw had plummeted. Back when he was in the Honored Lord's mansion, near the Son of Heaven, there were at least a few people to talk to. Now he was tossed into this pavilion and couldn't even leave easily. It was misery.

After receiving commendations last year, he had begged and pleaded—not for a transfer, just for a colleague. Immortal Officer Liu finally told him he would be assigned two Strongmen as subordinates. Dangjiang was thrilled to finally be a boss, but when he returned to the pavilion, he discovered the two Strongmen were brainless puppets.

Dangjiang was disappointed, but no matter how stupid they were, at least they were someone to talk to, a way to break the monotony. Besides, there wasn't really anything to move in this place, making the two Strongmen redundant. This made Dangjiang feel a little guilty, so he kept quiet about it.

Still, every time he looked up and saw those same thick-browed, wide-eyed faces, it dampened his spirits. 'Next chance I get,' the boy mused, pausing his work, 'I’m changing their Dharma bodies. Both of them. They’re going to be serving maids. Graceful, gorgeous ones. One will hold a green pipa and wear white robes; the other will carry a jade pot, wear a pink skirt, and the pot will be filled with hot milk... Now *that* would be beautiful...'

He was lost in this fantasy for several moments when he heard a *knock-knock* at the gate.

Dangjiang leaped from his seat in joy, shouting, "My Lord, please enter!"

Sure enough, a white-robed Immortal Officer stepped into the courtyard. His features were plain, but Dangjiang was so happy he looked moved to tears. "Lord Liu!" he cried. "It’s been too long!"

Immortal Officer Liu gave a slight nod. "Greetings, fellow Daoist. I have been away. How goes your progress?"

Dangjiang, long accustomed to Liu's cold tone, didn't mind at all. Maintaining his enthusiastic grin, he immediately launched into his work: "I was just reviewing this *Art of Drumming Profundity Fire Refining*! The 'Profundity' here refers to the Profound Marsh, meaning to spread blessings across the Great Wilderness, taking the meaning of 'nothing is beyond its reach.' This fire refining art is ancient, so we must discuss the Twelve-Storied Pagoda..."

He opened his mouth and didn't stop, pulling concepts from the east, mixing them with the west, rambling north and south. He talked, and talked, and talked. Lu Jiangxian’s fists clenched, relaxed, and clenched again.

'Why, why did I ask?'

Lu Jiangxian had sent this avatar regarding the Chi Buzi situation. Chi Buzi was about to deliver a Purple Mansion demon, but Lu Jiangxian didn't have many high-value rewards to spare and was reluctant to grant him a Azure Talisman. He would most likely have to reward him with Talisman Pills and White Talismans.

Such a reward wasn't particularly generous, and Chi Buzi was the type who wouldn't release the hawk until he saw the rabbit. He was not easily fooled. Lu Jiangxian needed to ensure Chi Buzi remained a loyal asset, and he also saw this interaction as a trail run for engaging with the Li family.

He was too lazy to manage the interaction personally; he didn't want to have to put on an act every time they met. Chi Buzi was sharp, and no performance Lu Jiangxian mounted could match the genuine, heartfelt belief radiating from an honest soul like Dangjiang. So, he had decided to use Dangjiang.

But he'd been listening to this rambling monologue while, outside the Mirror-World, Chi Buzi had already beaten the demon into submission and was about to capture her. The timing was about to be missed. Lu Jiangxian finally snapped.

"Fellow Daoist, your words are indeed profound!" he interrupted, his voice tight. "Such fascinating speculations... However, I am here today... to bid you farewell!"

"Ah?"

Dangjiang, who had been at the peak of his rant, heard this thunderclap and froze. "This... how can this be! Is this the will of the Great Registrar?"

Immortal Officer Liu nodded grimly.

Dangjiang looked like he was about to burst into tears. "You are the only kindred spirit I have up here! No one else will even talk to me... All my work is submitted through you! If you leave, what am I going to do!"

"I am not descending for reincarnation," Liu said. "It is merely a position transfer. I just won't be able to see you as often. Someone else will come to handle the handovers... Do not worry. When I have the time, I will come and visit."

Dangjiang visibly relaxed. At least he wasn't vanishing forever like some other Immortal Officers. But then Immortal Officer Liu sighed. "However, one matter has been weighing heavily on my heart. I have a favor to ask you... I have thought about it for a long time, and I feel I must ask."

Dangjiang, eager to curry favor, slapped his chest. "My Lord, please speak! I will certainly do my best!"

Immortal Officer Liu hesitated. "With this transfer, my original duties in the mansion are now vacant. We are short-staffed in the heavens, and several other colleagues have descended to the mortal realm. My new post is on the other side of heaven, and traveling back and forth is simply too inconvenient. Therefore, I petitioned the Lord... thinking that I might ask you to cover for me for a time."

Dangjiang’s smile froze. His expression warped into one of stunned, mournful disbelief. He raised a trembling hand and pointed at himself.

"My Lord, you mean... your... your work..." he stammered. "Your *job*..."

"I have to do that, TOO?!"
