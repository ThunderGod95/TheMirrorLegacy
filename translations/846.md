# Chapter 846: The Heir Apparent

Moongaze Lake.

The lake water was a serene azure, and a continuous spring rain fell. Gentle breezes drifted along the shore, leaving the small courtyard on the islet in silence. The two kumquat trees by the gate swayed slightly, their leaves droopy and listless from being shaded by the eaves and denied sunlight, even with the spring wind stirring them.

Li Xinghan stood in the courtyard, a precious sword hanging from her waist.

She was now at the seventh level of Qi Refining, firmly in the late stage. As a direct descendant of the Li Family, she was due to enter the mountains, take pills, and go into secluded cultivation once she reached the late stage of Qi Refining. She had heard that a few pills would be enough to help her attempt a breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Not knowing how many years this journey would take, she had come home to see her parents.

Hearing the commotion, her mother came out of the house with a smile to greet her, while her father sat sideways on the doorstep, his head bowed.

Ever since her maternal uncle, Chì Tiàozōng, had been promoted and the matter of her brother's official position had led to a falling-out with her parents and brother, Li Xinghan had rarely visited home. She mostly sent letters. Now, looking at the courtyard, it was eerily quiet, the laughter of previous years long gone.

It was clear that the influence of her uncle, Chì Tiàozōng, and her own influence were worlds apart. Although her brother had managed to secure a government post, it was a poor one in some remote place. Her brother and sister-in-law had moved out, leaving only their two aging parents to live in the quiet courtyard.

Seeing this, Li Xinghan’s heart felt heavy. She tried to say a few pleasant words, but her father was clearly still angry with her. He answered with a curt face and a few clipped words, perhaps also blaming her for the pain of their family's separation.

Unable to stay any longer, Li Xinghan announced her impending secluded cultivation for Foundation Establishment. As it was an endeavor where one either succeeded or died, her mother froze in shock, her eyes welling up with tears.

Her father finally lowered his legs from the threshold, his mouth opening as if to speak, but his face remained cold. Li Xinghan sighed, saying, "The family head still needs to see me... I've already visited my uncle. I just came to bid you both farewell."

She looked at her father, who had aged significantly, and her voice softened.

"Father... my brother isn't very capable. Even when he was managing the hands at a mining branch, he was a total mess. The only reason Qingdu didn't arrest him was because he finally listened to my uncle's advice and stopped taking bribes.

"Now, Jiangqian is in charge of the family. He's sharp-eyed and surely saw through my brother's ineptitude. The one overseeing the eastern shore is the Second Young Master, Li Jianglong. He has shown me favor, and I often hear news that he is tolerating my brother's actions out of consideration for me...

"If I fail my breakthrough and word of my death reaches you, please have my brother resign from his post early. Brother Zhoufang has already gone through enough trouble for our kin. There's no need for us to bother him again later."

She wasn't sure if her father had listened, and she turned to leave. He remained motionless, watching her go, while her mother saw her out of the courtyard and quickly returned, crouching by his side to wipe away tears.

Only then did her father stand up, listening as his wife whispered, "Look at you, you agreed to him... to say a good word for Zhoutui to inherit Master Chenghui's legacy, but you got cold feet again... and now you can't give him an answer..."

Her father closed his eyes and shook his head. "Forget it. Our daughter is stubborn and proud. Now that she's attempting Foundation Establishment, how can she possibly listen to such talk? It might even affect her state of mind. Whether Li Zhoutui lives or dies is not worth her life... and as for his legacy, he can go die somewhere far away and not get involved with my family."

He sighed and said, "Aren't there a few temples for the immortals on the eastern shore? Tomorrow... come with me to pray."

"I heard the Merciful One Temple by the river is more effective," his wife suggested.

Her father shook his head vigorously. "You're confused, too. A member of the Li Family praying to the Merciful One? Aren't you afraid of being crushed by a falling beam inside the temple? Forget it... we'll go to the eastern shore!"

Li Xinghan summoned the wind and soared into the air, landing inside the main hall. She lifted her gaze and saw a Qi Refining cultivator standing near the hall's entrance. He had a remarkably ugly face with a pointed jaw and sunken cheeks. Her brother, Li Zhoufang, was speaking with him, his expression awkward. Seeing Li Xinghan, he looked as if he had been granted a great pardon and hurried over.

"This is Fifth Young Master," he said.

It turned out this man was Li Jiangnian. By his age, he was only around eighteen, so his talent must have been decent. His appearance, however, did not reflect his age at all.

His gaze was downcast, as he dared not look at Li Xinghan. This wasn't directed at her personally; on the Immortal Dao, where everyone was stunningly handsome, his ugliness was especially pronounced, causing him to hunch his shoulders and mumble, "Greetings, Aunt."

Li Jiangnian's voice was unremarkable, at least much better than his face. Clearly, his resolve was far weaker than his brothers', as he lacked the courage to look others in the eye.

Li Xinghan sighed internally and exchanged a polite greeting before entering. The seat for Li Jiangliang on the other side was empty. The Fourth Young Master must have gone to the river with Cui Jueyin.

The two sisters of the Jiangque generation were both at the Purple Smoke Gate, and of the Zhouxing generation, only she and her brother, Li Zhoufang, were allowed into this hall. She glanced around and immediately went up to bow to Li Minggong and Li Xuanxuan.

"Greetings, masters!"

Li Minggong smiled and nodded, gesturing to a square-faced young man who stood nearby. He looked about twenty, with bright eyes. Li Xinghan was familiar with this one; he was Li Zhoufang's treasured son, the recently cultivated Li Jiangzong, who was currently by Li Minggong's side.

Li Jiangzong was very familiar with her and paid his respects. Only then did Li Xinghan return to her seat beside Li Zhouming. The red-robed young master had broken his bad habit of being late and had arrived early, sitting properly, which made Li Xinghan smile.

"Swish!"

Li Zhouming opened his fan, using it to cover his mouth as he spoke in a low voice.

"I say, little sister... I'm a bit strapped for cash these days. Shòuyú has confiscated all my things and will only let me make hairpins for her... do you have one or two pieces of spirit iron or materials I could use to pay off some debts to other families..."

Li Xinghan let out a laugh. "You've got some nerve. Go see Uncle Chenghao for spirit iron... I'm not in charge, nor do I manage things. Where would I get such things?"

Just then, Li Jiangqian's soft voice echoed through the hall. "Now that all our clansmen have arrived, let's discuss the matter of Grand Uncle Chenghui."

At his words, the gathered clansmen quieted. Li Jiangqian continued, "This matter should have been settled long ago, but our brothers are either away or in secluded cultivation, so it has been difficult to gather everyone. Now that Aunt Xinghan is also about to go into seclusion for her breakthrough, it's the perfect time to make a decision."

Li Chenghui had no heirs and left no written will, making the matter of his succession very complicated. After so many years of delay, Li Zhouda, the oldest and most talented, was already in the middle stage of Qi Refining and was nearing the age to attempt Foundation Establishment in just a few years. He had personally visited Li Xuanxuan, hoping to put the matter on the agenda.

After all, a breakthrough to Foundation Establishment was a life-or-death moment, the very time when one most needed the legacy of Li Chenghui, from cultivation methods and spell arts to spiritual artifacts and resources. Even his official lineage and status, if not decided now, would become meaningless later. Not only would they lose their greatest value, but it would also breed resentment.

And that coveted Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman, although said to be a clan item and not part of the inherited Daoist tradition, everyone knew that whoever first obtained the Daoist tradition and successfully cultivated the way of lightning would ultimately wield the spiritual artifact.

In addition, there was an even more critical issue: Li Chenghui's father, Li Xì'è, had passed away a few days ago.

Although Li Xì'è was a mere mortal, he was Li Chenghui's father! While he never said anything, his heart must have favored his closest blood relative, Li Zhoutui, as the successor. With his death, the lineage of Li Zhoutui suffered a major blow.

Of course, even if a few of the higher-ups felt this way, they continued to publicly state that they were waiting for the elders to return, as pleasantries still needed to be said.

Li Jiangqian paused slightly. Li Xuanxuan spoke in a hoarse voice, "There were originally three candidates: Zhouda, Zhoutui, and Zhouxun. Zhouda is the most talented and has the fiercest temperament, which is well-suited to the way of lightning. However, his fiery nature also presents difficulties..."

"Zhoutui has a closer bloodline, but like Zhouxun, he lacks talent..."

Everyone present was well aware of the three candidates. Li Zhoutui was the closest in bloodline and the most suitable. Had he not made that impatient, presumptuous wail back then, the matter would have been settled in his favor. This whole long process would have been avoided.

But his family elders lacked self-control, and his outburst had soured the goodwill of several Foundation Establishment cultivators towards him. Over the years, Li Zhoutui had enjoyed excellent resources, yet his cultivation was only comparable to Li Zhouxun, who had gone out to manage the fields. Both were still in the Embryonic Breathing stage, which only made things worse for him.

As for Li Zhouxun, his talent was passable. In the past, he came from a poor family and was taken in by Li Chenghui, thus gaining some rights to the inheritance. However, Li Chenghui might have only been observing him and never said a word about it, so he couldn't have been named the successor at the time.

Yet, he later voluntarily gave up and went to the island to manage the spiritual fields. If Li Zhouda hadn't been an option, he would have had a great chance, but compared to him now, his prospects had dimmed.

After Li Xuanxuan finished speaking, he looked around. The others lowered their heads in thought, and no one spoke up, knowing there was no dissent. He then said, "Let's have Zhouda come in and see for himself!"

Soon, a stocky man in leather armor entered from the side. He was robust, with a square face, thick brows, and large eyes. He looked somewhat similar to Li Wen, but while Li Wen had a simple-minded demeanor, this man was clearly someone who had seen blood, a great deal more ferocious, with eyes that shone brightly.

He quickly walked to the front of the hall and, without fear, bowed and said, "Greetings to all the elders and brothers!"

Li Xuanxuan nodded and said, "This is Li Zhouda. He currently holds a position at Yùtíng, handling tasks like slaying Demons and expelling evil."

The old man looked around again. Only Li Zhoufang hesitated for a moment, glancing at Li Xinghan, who, having a good impression of Li Zhouda, spoke softly, "I have stayed by the lake for a while. This brother is diligent and responsible. Among the clansmen, he's one of the most hardworking."

With Li Xinghan's endorsement, Li Zhoufang remained silent. As both were his kinsmen, he certainly wouldn't speak up for Li Zhoutui against his promising sister. The old man noticed this and nodded. "All the elders think highly of you. You just need to temper your personality a bit."

"This junior accepts your guidance!" Li Zhouda grinned and bowed to everyone. Li Minggong stood up and said, "I'll take you to Qingdu. All the rituals on the mountain should be ready."

The clansmen followed Li Minggong to Qingdu, leaving only Li Xinghan and a few others. Li Xuanxuan sighed, "He is good, yes, but only because we have Jiangqian and others to oversee the big picture. We won't rely solely on him in the future. That's why I dared to choose him. We won't need him to be the head of Qingdu, but he can certainly hold down a few peaks."

Li Zhouda was exemplary in every way, save for his overly righteous and volatile temper and his lack of verbal skill. He would often champion justice within the clan, which earned him the support of many clansmen, but it was not considered a safe path on the road of cultivation.

Li Jiangqian had been waiting for this matter to be settled. His gaze was profound as he sipped his tea. "When word of this gets out, it will be alright for the lone Zhouxun, but the Zhoutui faction will likely have some complaints.

"That's one thing. The other is that Uncle Zhouda has a fiery temper and can't stand petty gossip... my suggestion is that as soon as the formalities are complete, he should be sent into secluded cultivation immediately. That way, he won't hear any of it, and by the time he comes out in a few years, the matter will have faded, and there will be far fewer disputes."

Li Xuanxuan was most afraid of such trouble and could only sigh. In truth, they all understood that at this point, they had no choice but to pick Li Zhouda. Li Zhoutui would likely remain a Qi Refining cultivator forever.

The old man glanced at Li Xinghan and said in a gentle voice, "As for that Essence Gathering Pills of yours, I sent people to inquire with various families a couple of years ago. We eventually obtained one refined by Yùzhēn from the Sword Gate and traded it for one of our own.

"I will also take you to your cave dwelling later and teach you the proper sequence for taking the pills needed for your breakthrough to Foundation Establishment."

Since the Li Family possessed a Talisman Pill, they could achieve a breakthrough without any side effects. As they could not reveal the pill, the Li Family had devised various methods over the years. Li Jiangqian had even managed to mix the Talisman Pill into a selection of other pills by wrapping it in a pill skin, so that when the final breakthrough occurred, it would simply be attributed to an unusually effective combination of medicines.

Li Xinghan bowed in gratitude and withdrew from the hall. Li Jiangqian then waved his hand, dismissing the others on either side. Seeing Li Xuanxuan's worried face, he smiled and said, "Elder, you don't need to worry so much. He may be temperamental and enjoy a good fight, but he's not an idiot. Look at how he spends his days fighting and brawling, sticking up for his clansmen, and how he fights Demons without regard for his life. Isn't he building a reputation? A family needs a direct descendant who is a powerful fighter and a hothead, willing to risk his life, and with such high cultivation... it's a very interesting way of getting what you want."

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard, and Li Jiangqian spoke in a low voice, "I received news that Li Quantao is already stationed at Lake Xian, and his son has gone to Baijiang Creek to travel around that area. The surrounding families aren't bothering him.

"Master Li Xizhi has been transferred east to guard the Eastern Sea for Azure Pond. He has been given a larger area, from Green Pine Island all the way to Tai'e Island near Crimson Reef Island. He has full authority to command it. His status now... is comparable to that of Sect Master Dantai Jin."

A smile appeared on his face as he continued, "There's also news that Fei Qingyi has made her first public appearance since marrying Qín Xiǎn. It's said she's been invited to guard the Eastern Sea and will be placed under Master Li XIzhi's command. Dantai Jin sent a large group of people with her, and she is highly valued.

"This person is sharp-eyed..."

Li Xuanxuan shook his head. "When the Sima Family was at its peak, she avoided them and didn't even contact her own family, yet she never forgot to fawn over our family, even giving away a spiritual artifact for Foundation Establishment. Now that Ning Wan has come out of seclusion, it's immediately seen as a signal from the Sima Family to show goodwill to the Ning family... Call it good fortune or cleverness, she has finally escaped the sinking ship of the Fei family and is soaring higher and higher."

Li Jiangqian paused, then rose from his main seat and walked out the door. He seemed to sense something and looked north.

'Inward Heart Surging Profundity is beneficial for the Immortal Dao and secluded cultivation, and it can clear the twelve vital breaths.'

'To break through at the very moment a True Monarch descends... there is something suspicious about this.'

In the north, heavy snow fell, blanketing the distance in white. Spring snow was not a particularly surprising phenomenon, but Li Jiangqian observed the extent of the snowfall and smiled.

"They've come just as I expected... After all these years, the Fei family has finally produced their own Foundation Establishment cultivator... but Fei Qingyi... might be in for another headache."
