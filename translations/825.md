### Chapter 825: The Immortal Decree

As Li Jiangqian headed toward the riverbank, he glanced up at the sky. The ethereal essence released by Tian Zhongqing’s fall had already vanished without a trace. The sun blazed fiercely, casting a light so bright over the lake it was almost suffocating.

"The summers get drier every year."

He descended on stepping flames. Below, in the Lijings Prefectural Town, doorways were already draped in white mourning gauze. The various branches of the Tian clan had once been prominent families in Lijing. Though their power had waned after moving to Eastern Yue, and they were caught in the crossfire of the conflict between north and south, their path had been difficult. Fortunately, Tian Zhongqing had returned safely back then. Even if the younger generation was lacking, the family still retained a measure of prestige and relied on old favors. Li Jiangqian had been delayed, and by the time he arrived, the riverbank was already crowded.

Although Chen Yang had departed, the Chen family—a great clan equal to the Ans—had no shortage of influential figures to manage the situation. Moreover, Chen Donghe himself had personally come this time. Li Jiangqian scanned the crowd. Aside from Li Chenghuai and a few others currently in seclusion, nearly half of the lake region’s true powerholders were present.

He wasn't surprised. It was no secret that the esteemed clans of the lake region were a tangled web of alliances. The Li clan itself had integrated with external families through generations of intermarriage. The fact that Ding Weizeng, Qu Bushi, and Miaoshui—several of the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators belonging to the Jiangbei faction—had *not* attended, actually earned his silent approval.

The old master of the Tian family, Tian Ling, waited by the riverbank dressed entirely in white. He was something of a special case. His father, Tian Rong, had been assassinated by a servant girl, leaving Tian Ling to grow up alone in Qingdu. He had held posts first in the Jade Court and later in the Lake region, but his low cultivation meant he was never considered an important figure. Currently stationed on the eastern shore, he had rushed back for the funeral. He stepped forward to receive Li Jiangqian, bowing meticulously.

"Greetings, Clan Head."

Li Jiangqian offered a few words of comfort as he landed. He scanned the dense, overlapping reed marshes, spoke the necessary pleasantries, and made his appearance brief. It was enough to fulfill his obligations.

Stepping away from the formal proceedings, he sought out Li Xuanxuan. The old man looked deeply worried. The moment he saw Li Jiangqian, he spoke.

"Qian'er, are you returning to the main island? Take me with you; I need to retrieve an item or two."

Li Jiangqian was indeed managing countless affairs and still had his own cultivation to attend to; he had little time to waste here. He nodded, supported the old man's arm, and ignited his flames, flying back out over the lake. As they traveled, he asked:

"Elder, what are you fetching that requires you to go personally?"

Li Xuanxuan sighed. "The Tian family’s younger generation is truly in decline. We must help where we can... This old man has some spiritual items stored away. I’ll go fetch them... If I spot any promising youths, I'll pass some along."

Li Jiangqian nodded thoughtfully. "You can entrust that task to me."

Before Li Xuanxuan could reply, Li Jiangqian activated his ocular technique. A brief glance aside made him pause. "Hm?"

Standing amidst the clouds near the lake was a man and a woman. The woman’s features were unremarkable, but she carried herself with an excellent bearing, a faint smile on her face. In her arms, she cradled a treasured sword that radiated an aura as piercing and cold as Ice.

Beside her stood an exceptionally handsome young man, appearing to be in his late twenties. He wore a deep green robe secured by a Jade belt, and dark boots. A short talisman-sword hung at his hip.

Li Jiangqian smiled and flew over, bowing first to the woman. "Greetings, Aunt Xinghan."

Li Xinghan returned the greeting and then hurried to pay respects to Li Xuanxuan. The young man, surprised, quickly followed suit. After the flurry of salutations, Li Jiangqian turned to the man, feigning unfamiliarity.

"And this is..."

"I am Zhuang Pingye, of the Guyan Zhuang Clan," the man replied with a smile.

Li Jiangqian recognized him; this was indeed the famous talisman-sword successor from Guyan. "Daoist Friend, you have a truly striking countenance," Li Jiangqian praised.

Zhuang Pingye was indeed exceptionally handsome, but his was the dazzling handsomeness of wealth and dashing flair. His features—a broad, noble forehead, bright lips, white teeth, and a full chin—were so opulent they commanded attention. Yet, he lacked true refined grace. He was prettier than Li Xizhi, but Li Xizhi possessed an enduring quality to his looks that Zhuang Pingye lacked. His beauty was also starkly different from Li Xijun’s cold, sharp elegance.

His looks and bearing were first-class, and he was clearly accustomed to praise. He bowed politely to Li Jiangqian.

"Greetings, Clan Head!"

His voice was also extremely pleasant, compelling trust. Based on this first impression alone, Zhuang Pingye seemed an impeccable candidate for a husband. Li Xuanxuan watched with a faint smile, nodding slightly.

Li Jiangqian nodded, and Zhuang Pingye immediately added:

"I heard that Xinghan enjoys sword arts. I recently acquired a rather unique sword manual in the Great Desert and brought it to study with her."

Li Jiangqian glanced at Li Xinghan, who nodded gently. He offered a few more pleasantries, praising Zhuang Pingye. Though the young man smiled, he deflected every compliment with practiced humility. Not wanting to intrude, Li Jiangqian took his leave.

'With that appearance and bearing, he’s certainly not beneath Aunt. He doesn't seem like a brainless fool, either... Though he's a few years older, his prospects for reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm look very promising...'

As Li Jiangqian flew back on the wind, solidifying his impression of the man, Li Xuanxuan spoke.

"It seems Xinghan isn't averse to him. He has a good demeanor and is clearly generous. Matters of affection often rise and fall as quickly as an overturned cup or spilled tea. We must investigate clearly, and quickly—how many brothers does he have? His paternal line consists of high-level cultivators, but what about his maternal line? Does he have any black marks on his record? If this needs to be stopped, it must be stopped early, before it harms anyone."

Li Jiangqian replied cautiously, "Elder, I already investigated this. He is the youngest legitimate son of Zhuang Cheng. His mother, a woman from a minor clan, died early. The subsequent official wife bore no children, which is why Zhuang Cheng keeps seven concubines... Still, he has very few legitimate sons. Zhuang Pingye is deeply favored, surrounded by numerous servant girls and songstresses, but he has no heirs."

Li Jiangqian had only revealed a fraction of what he knew, but the implication was clear. Li Xuanxuan frowned. Then again, one of his own descendants was also known to indulge in that path, so he only hesitated, offering no reply. The two descended back onto the island, arriving at Qingdu. The old man sighed.

"These things are often unavoidable... We shall wait and see."

They landed. Li Jiangqian returned to the main hall in the center of the island via his fire technique and took his seat. A guard soon reported that Xia Shouyu was waiting outside.

This woman had, after all, been personally selected by Li Ximing, and furthermore, she was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. Li Jiangqian treated her with considerable respect and immediately invited her in. Xia Shouyu was escorted into the hall. She bowed.

"Greetings, Clan Head... I have been looking for Young Master Zhouming these past few days, but he was nowhere to be found this morning. His attendants mentioned he went for an outing by the lake, but I found no trace of him. Since the weather is rather oppressive, I came here to inquire..."

'An outing in this blazing heat? Where else could he be... he’s off indulging his vices.'

Li Zhouming had been remarkably well-behaved recently, so much so that Li Xuanxuan almost believed the boy was finally mending his ways. But a fox cannot hide its tail. The itch obviously became unbearable, and he had gone off to rendezvous with some woman. Li Jiangqian felt the awkwardness of the situation and forced a smile.

"My uncle does have a habit of taking such outings. He often rides out alone, and even the servants cannot track him."

Xia Shouyu observed his reaction and understood the situation perfectly. However, with the marriage agreement still pending, a woman as calculating as she would never choose to make an issue of it now. She smiled.

"I understand. It was merely a casual mention. The wedding date is approaching, so I came to find the Clan Head to discuss the arrangements."

Her expression turned serious. "My family members were supposed to come here, but considering the Daoist Master’s situation... the Daoist Master gave specific instructions not to expose anything. I fear that if cultivators from my home traveled here, their movements might be revealed. Yet, planning this alone seems inappropriate. Therefore, I came specifically to consult the Clan Head..."

Li Jiangqian fell silent, observing her expression just as carefully, weighing his calculations.

Xia Shouyu’s engagement had been personally decreed by Li Ximing. Her background was a mystery, but Li Jiangqian had no authority to question the decision. Besides, she handled every matter meticulously, leaving no room for complaint.

By framing it this way, she made any request to meet her elders seem unnecessary. He couldn't tell if this was a strategic maneuver—advancing by retreating—or a genuine desire to consult. With Li Ximing’s reputation backing her, Li Jiangqian could only concede.

"Senior is commendably cautious. We shall proceed with the wedding according to custom. With the Daoist Master vouching for you, the formalities with your sect are not urgent..."

He set aside the letter in his hand and smiled. "However, Senior possesses the rare Blazing Fire Dao lineage. Such lineages have specific requirements. If there is any location within the lake region better suited for your cultivation, you must mention it. Since you cannot currently contact your sect, you may also list any spiritual items required for your high-grade techniques."

"The juniors in the family are also quite curious about the Blazing Fire lineage and were hoping to ask you for guidance."

Xia Shouyu’s heart tightened, though her smile remained unchanged. "There is no need for spiritual items; I brought sufficient supplies when I left home. As for guidance... I would not dare presume to instruct the Immortal Clan. However, if the juniors visit, I will certainly not be negligent in their teaching."

Li Jiangqian was about to press the point when the sound of hurried footsteps echoed from the entrance. Cui Jueyin appeared at the hall entrance, his expression urgent. He bowed quickly, and Li Jiangqian swallowed the rest of his sentence as Cui Jueyin approached and whispered:

"Clan Head... someone from the Golden Feather Sect has arrived. It is the individual closest to Daoist Master Qiushui—Zhang Duanyan of the Golden Feather Sect. She is waiting outside the island perimeter."

'Qiushui? Zhang Duanyan!'

If one had to name the most unprovokable figures in all of Jiangnan, one was the sole survivor of the Three Yuans, Daoist Master Yuanxiu. The other was this very Daoist Master Qiushui. Both were cultivators on the verge of trying the Golden Core realm, figures that even other Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters deeply feared.

Furthermore, Daoist Master Qiushui was a Great Daoist Master specializing in the Whole Pill path and a member of the Golden Feather Zhang family, placing her status even a notch above Daoist Master Yuanxiu. This meant Zhang Duanyan’s authority within the Golden Feather Sect was scarcely less than that of the Sect Master!

Li Jiangqian’s pupils constricted. He shot to his feet and strode rapidly down from the dais, offering a brief apology to Xia Shouyu as he passed.

"An honored guest is at the gate. I must greet them immediately. Please forgive me for neglecting you, Senior."

How could Xia Shouyu possibly complain about being neglected? She was practically breathing a sigh of relief. Li Jiangqian vanished from the hall in moments, and she hurriedly excused herself, making her way back to her own cultivation abode.

Li Jiangqian, meanwhile, had no capacity to analyze their conversation further. His mind filled with unease, he exited the hall and rode the wind toward the island’s edge. Sure enough, a woman stood waiting in the small pavilion there.

The woman was tall and dressed in golden robes. A golden gauze veiled the lower half of her face, revealing only a pair of calm eyes and fair skin. Her hands were clasped behind her back. An old man, eyes half-closed and back hunched, stood beside her.

The woman was currently gazing out at the lake scenery with what seemed to be an appreciative smile. However, her ramrod-straight posture and a subtle hesitation in her movements betrayed an inner turmoil.

Li Jiangqian hurriedly landed his flames outside the pavilion and entered on foot, bowing deeply. "Greetings, Emissary of the Immortal Sect."

Zhang Duanyan turned and returned the bow. She studied him for a moment. "You are Li Jiangqian. Let us speak inside."

Li Jiangqian and Cui Jueyin led the pair inside, guiding them through the defensive formations and back to the great hall. Zhang Duanyan observed their surroundings and nodded.

"The Li Clan has governed this lake region with considerable merit, surpassing the Jiang family of old."

Li Jiangqian clasped his hands. "The Jiangs were descendants of an Immortal Mansion; we cannot compare. We have merely benefited from our Daoist Master’s good fortune, which has allowed us some prosperity..."

Zhang Duanyan smiled faintly. Faced with an emissary from the Golden Feather Sect, Li Jiangqian tactfully bypassed the main audience hall, guiding them instead toward a rear hall.

The reason was simple: the main audience hall possessed only one high seat, forcing an awkward declaration of status. Zhang Duanyan was not at the Purple Mansion Realm, but she was the mouthpiece for one, and her personal background was illustrious. With his own Daoist Master absent, Li Jiangqian letting her take the high seat would seem obsequious; taking it himself would be arrogant. The rear hall, with its less formal seating, solved the dilemma. They sat, and Cui Jueyin served tea.

Li Jiangqian spoke respectfully. "The Emissary of the Immortal Sect gracing our humble abode brings radiance to the entire lake region. May I ask what guidance you bring us?"

"There are indeed arrangements to discuss. Have you had news of your Daoist Master in recent years? It would be best if he were present to oversee this matter."

Zhang Duanyan nodded lightly, returning his polite smile as she inquired after Li Ximing’s whereabouts. Li Jiangqian replied:

"The Daoist Master is traveling overseas, and we have received no news of his return. If the Immortal Emissary needs me to relay a message to him, I fear I am unable to do so."

Zhang Duanyan sighed softly. "The Clan Head misunderstands. A few days ago, an emissary from the North arrived at the Golden Feather mountain gate. They bore an Immortal Order, and after negotiations with my Golden Feather Sect, a great matter was decided. I have been dispatched south to transmit this order to the various sects."

'An emissary from the North?'

The Zhang family had never shown any deference to Buddhist cultivators. For Zhang Duanyan to refer to this person as an emissary from the North—and even subtly imply her own status was lower—the origin of this visitor was obvious.

'Mount Luoxia!'

Just as this realization struck Li Jiangqian, Zhang Duanyan rose from her seat. Her veil vanished, revealing a lovely face with bright eyes and pristine teeth. She spoke in a low voice:

"This decree should have been received at the Tiantai Dharma Realm. Fortunately, it was already formally received once at the Golden Feather Sect. This is merely a transmission, one step removed from the original Immortal Rank, but it is still improper to announce it indoors. If the decree cannot reach the heavens, this hall will collapse. If my feet do not touch the raw earth, the foundations beneath us will shatter..."

Li Jiangqian only had to gesture her one step back; the rear of the hall opened directly onto a courtyard exposed to the sky. Zhang Duanyan judged it spacious enough.

"All of you, bow now."

The old man accompanying her was already prostrate on the ground, his expression respectful to the point of terror. Li Jiangqian and Cui Jueyin bowed down. Zhang Duanyan’s expression turned utterly solemn. She retreated half a step, bowed deeply from the waist, raised her hands above her head, and respectfully intoned:

"Comprehending Profundity’s purple reflection, the Wu light revealing the dawn mist; the Golden Oneness of this Dao, I humbly beseech thee."

The Great Void did not tremble, nor did any spiritual light flash. Her hands merely vibrated faintly, and a scroll materialized within them. It was white with a brown border, looking as commonplace as a mortal book as it lay flat in her palms.

Li Jiangqian’s heart seized. He dared not ask a thing. He only registered that every sound of bird and insect in the garden had fallen utterly silent. The wind stopped. Even the bright light from the zenith above seemed to dim.

Zhang Duanyan’s expression was grave, her normally calm eyes filled only with profound weight. Her voice dropped low: "On the twenty-second day of the seventh month, in the twenty-second year of Shenxuan, the Wu Light accepts the offering. The Celestial Entourage shall honor the realm, arriving at the Three Streams of Jiangbei. It descends to observe the mortal world, to spread virtue and grace. It proceeds thence to Qilu, returning in six years and six months. All clans in the lands it traverses must burn incense and perform the rites. Close your doors and do not disturb the passage. In all places the Celestial Entourage treads, deference is paramount. Do not entangle yourself in this causality."

Zhang Duanyan only spoke the words; the immortal decree in her hands was never unrolled. Perhaps the Li family lacked the status to see it, or perhaps opening it would unleash something terrifying. The scroll remained inert in her palms.

Yet her voice echoed in the profound silence. Li Jiangqian slowly bowed his head lower, his mind roaring like thunder.

'Mount Luoxia’s *Celestial Entourage* is coming to Jiangbei to observe the mortal world...'

Whose entourage could possibly come from Mount Luoxia? It had to be a True Monarch! "Observe the mortal world"... the phrase sounded magnificent, projecting an air of supreme authority, but it meant only one thing: a True Monarch was reincarnating and descending!

'Proceeds to Qilu, returning in six years and six months...'

This True Monarch intended to carve a path from Jiangbei straight through to the lands of Qilu, returning to Mount Luoxia after six years and six months—a precise repetition of what Chu Yi had done all those years ago!

As for the warnings about deference and causality, it felt less like a threat and more like a merciful reminder: this True Monarch was descending to observe the world's suffering as the path to reclaim his Fruition Attainment. Any great clan or immortal sect that blocked his way would be scattered like dust in the wind.

'Back then, Chu Yi rose abruptly and annihilated the great clans of Yufu Prefecture. Our family knew nothing concrete, only whispers and speculation. Now... only because we have achieved the Purple Mansion Realm, do we finally qualify to receive Mount Luoxia’s direct orders...'

While Li Jiangqian still possessed the clarity to analyze the situation, Cui Jueyin was frozen solid beside him, stunned into a statue. His legs trembled violently. As a direct descendant of the Overseas Cui Clan—a line that had suffered repeated torments—his terror of a True Monarch ran far deeper than Li Jiangqian’s, perhaps even deeper than Zhang Duanyan’s.

Zhang Duanyan herself remained solemn, her eyes overflowing with boundless awe and reverence, as if her own consciousness had been swept away. Yet, it seemed genuine. Only the knuckles of the hands gripping the scroll had turned white.

She was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator; that grip contained enough force to shatter brick, yet the immortal decree remained utterly pristine, without the slightest wrinkle. Li Jiangqian kept his eyes firmly fixed on the ground, his voice resonant with deference.

"This lowly cultivator accepts the decree!"

The immortal decree in Zhang Duanyan’s hands vanished abruptly, as if it had never existed. The woman stepped forward naturally to help Li Jiangqian rise, her voice emerging slightly hoarse.

"Clan Head, please rise quickly."

Li Jiangqian accepted the gesture and rose, though a heavy pressure remained lodged in his chest. Beside him, Cui Jueyin was drenched in sweat, his eyes lowered to mere slits, his gaze seemingly nailed to the earth, utterly unable to look up.

The four returned inside in silence. Zhang Duanyan took her seat but remained quiet.

Zhang Duanyan had traveled here from the Golden Feather Sect. The Li clan didn't know which stop this was on her itinerary, but based on geography, they had to be the first or second. The woman clearly had little experience reciting an immortal decree. It wasn't only the Li family members who were shaken; her own face was pale, and she seemed to be struggling to catch her breath.

Li Jiangqian quickly adjusted his emotions and poured her fresh tea. "We have truly troubled the Immortal Emissary to make this trip simply to warn my family... Jiangqian thanks you on behalf of the entire Li clan!"

Zhang Duanyan raised the cup to her lips and took a sip. Her eyes betrayed her exhaustion, but she forced herself to maintain the proper etiquette. "The Clan Head speaks too gravely. This is merely within the scope of my duty."

Li Jiangqian considered this, then asked, "Just one thing... this 'twenty-second year of Shenxuan, seventh month.' My family is unfamiliar with this calendar. When is that?"

Zhang Duanyan replied in a low voice, "Shenxuan is the calendar used by the Northern Dao lineages, reckoned by the spiritual atmosphere. It corresponds to June, two years from now."

Li Jiangqian sighed softly, searing the date into his memory. But Zhang Duanyan spoke again, her expression turning solemn.

"Since the Celestial Entourage will be in Jiangbei, the grudge between your esteemed clan and the White Ye Immortal Sect must be set aside. If you are still preoccupied with such squabbles when this begins, I fear that in the end..."

She hesitated, trailing off. Li Jiangqian nodded quickly.

"Emissary, rest assured, my clan knows its limits. We would never do such a thing. The affairs of a True Monarch are far beyond our touch. We will not intentionally provoke the Capital immortals Dao... But we cannot guarantee their restraint."

"Rest assured on that count."

Zhang Duanyan shook her head. "The Capital immortals Dao will absolutely not make a move. They will not use this as an opportunity for any schemes or assassinations. They will not even allow the *thought* to arise. This matter is far beyond the control of any Purple Mansion Realm. If anyone harbors such designs, the result is often the annihilation of both parties, and worse, it is an offense to the North. That is tantamount to punching a hole in the heavens."

Li Jiangqian finally relaxed. Only then did Zhang Duanyan continue:

"In another two days or so, the decree will also have been delivered to the Capital immortals Dao. I implore your clan and the Capital immortals Dao to negotiate properly. Use the two years you have. Withdraw the personnel that must be withdrawn. Swiftly promote the clans necessary to hold the territory. Ensure the boundaries are handed over properly. Do this, so you are not forced to sever a limb to survive when the time comes."

"As for the rites and incense, it is best to perform them to the fullest extent. No one truly knows the specifics of this situation. It would be best to construct a high altar and ensure all formalities are observed."

"This junior obeys!"

Zhang Duanyan let out a slow breath. She pondered for a long moment before speaking again, as if steeling herself to add a final warning.

"Daoist Master Qiushui met Senior Xuanfeng back in the day. There was some affinity there, and she holds him in high regard. Furthermore, my grandfather shares a deep friendship with your clan. Therefore, I will offer one personal reminder: your clan must remain quiet. Do not entertain any thoughts of making contact. That path leads only to eternal damnation."

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian felt a flicker of suspicion. 'Where is this warning coming from? She already made the point clear. It’s not as if our family is ignorant of the Chu Yi affair. Why would we be insane enough to attempt contact with a True Monarch?'

He immediately replied aloud, "That is absolutely impossible. My clan would never seek its own destruction."

Zhang Duanyan nodded lightly and turned her gaze to Cui Jueyin. This time, her tone was not so polite. "And you."

Cui Jueyin was still drenched in sweat. Being singled out, he sucked in a sharp breath and bowed deeply. "I swear on the Chongzhou Cui Clan, I will never defy the Immortal Decree!"

Zhang Duanyan sipped her tea, finally guiding the conversation away from the terrifying subject. Her voice softened. "Once this affair has passed, both Daoist Master Yuanxiu and my own Daoist Master Qiushui will be attempting to break through to the Golden Core realm. It is rare for a Daoist Master of my Zhang family to seek their Dao in the outside world. We will be sure to send your clan an invitation. If your Daoist Master has returned from his travels and is in residence, he is more than welcome to observe the ceremony."

The Zhang family, unlike the Chi clan, were the legitimate, direct descendants of True Monarch Taiyuan—true Golden Core Immortal Descendants. The Golden Feather Sect’s Grotto-Heaven was on an entirely different level than the domain at Pristine Water; countless members of their direct lineage likely cultivated within it.

When a Daoist Master of the Zhang family neared the end of their lifespan, they would perish inside that Grotto-Heaven, feeding their spiritual essence back into their domain rather than letting it scatter to benefit outsiders. Zhang Tianyuan, who had not been seen in years, had almost certainly followed this path.

Zhang Duanyan phrased it elegantly, but the reality was that aside from their ancestors on the Path of Metal Virtue, none of the Zhang family's recent Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had managed to cultivate the Five Dao Divine Abilities to completion. Now, all their hopes rested on Qiushui.

For a Golden Core Immortal Descendant to speak this way already showed immense respect. Li Jiangqian hurriedly returned the bow.

"The Great Daoist Master is the foremost expert of the Whole Pill path beneath the heavens! Her cultivation and techniques shake the world. She will certainly attain Fruition Attainment. My clan need only prepare our congratulatory gifts and wait for the day when heaven and earth celebrate with her!"
