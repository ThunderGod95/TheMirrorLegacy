# Chapter 1258: Uncontested

Xuanwei lowered his gaze and said nothing, but the junior behind him could no longer remain still. He approached hesitantly and ventured,

"Martial Uncle, the Great Song has already reached Xiangxiang—we must have a way to respond!"

The middle-aged man jolted as if waking from a dream. His hands gripped the windowsill, and his voice was ice-cold.

"There is nothing to respond to!"

He spun around and took several quick strides, his eyes holding the chill of ten-thousand-year-old ice. Returning to his seat, he pressed a finger lightly on a jade talisman on the desk and pushed it forward, sliding it all the way across to Tao Jiexing.

Tao Jiexing offered a salute before raising his gaze to look. He saw a line of vertical script written from top to bottom on the jade talisman:

[All cultivators of the Tao Clan are requested to immediately depart Yinling and mount a defense.]

Tao Jiexing was stunned.

"This is..." he asked, aghast.

Xuanwei’s gaze was laced with sarcasm.

"That was a gift from Emperor Zhaowu of Zhao back when my Tao Clan presided over Yinling. It's a treasure of the Cultivation Transcendence Dao. It hasn't shown a reaction for several hundred years, yet today it decided to light up!"

Tao Jiexing pondered this for a moment.

"Is it the Zhao court?"

Xuanwei scoffed.

"That's the only pretext they have that's of any use! Those wretched bald monks—they can dream on!"

His mockery finished, he sat down calmly and said,

"My Tao Clan is a great clan, unlike the others. For generations, we have followed the Dao-paths of Shuo Lou and Guanhua. What? Weren't Qi Lanyan and Vast Cicada enough? They still want to cause trouble?"

He gave a cold laugh.

"No matter the circumstances, my Tao Clan is related by marriage to the Qu Clan. Even Shangguan Zidu would have to address my ancestor as 'Grandmistress.' Yes… the Wei Clan are the blood descendants of a True Monarch, so they can't be bullied, but is my Tao Clan fair game? If the two Shangguan brothers hadn't failed in verifying the Dao, my Tao Clan would now be in the Xiyang Abbey. Would it be our turn to be suppressed like this today?"

He stated coldly,

"No matter how high and mighty they act, it's nothing more than the victor being crowned king and the loser branded a villain. The Wei Clan hasn't produced a True Monarch in a long time, so the old ties of favor have faded. Now, they even dare to have so many people meddling in a junior's attempt at verifying the Dao!"

Martial Uncle Xuanwei was notoriously stubborn, a fact Tao Jiexing had anticipated. When relaying Wei Xuanyin's words, he had taken great care to soften them again and again. Even so, his martial uncle had clearly understood, and now seethed with rage.

"When Xue Linqing entered Tongxuan Palace, it was a Tao family ancestor he paid respects to. My clan hasn't produced any world-shaking figures in recent years, so it's only right that we not interfere with their schemes. But now…"

He ultimately preserved a sliver of decorum and said no more. Tao Jiexing spoke up,

"It’s just that acting this way will look bad. Once Luoxia is back in the hands of the Great Zhao… we will offend a great many people…"

Xuanwei's voice was glacial.

"I am not one to be trifled with. If they dare to pressure my Tao family, then I, Xuanwei, dare to tear away all pretense and use the few methods our ancestors left behind. We'll see who is more disgraced then!"

Tao Jiexing hadn't expected the situation to escalate so quickly. He lowered his head, at a loss for words, and only managed to say,

"I only fear that… King Wei… has been coerced…"

"King Wei?"

Xuanwei, however, began to laugh. He shook his head and replied,

"You are mistaken!"

A strange light glittered in his eyes as he gazed southward with a peculiar expression.

"Look at the situation. Is anyone coercing him right now? Wrong! He is the one coercing others!"

As Tao Jiexing looked up, lost in thought, Daoist Master Xuanwei continued,

"He is the White Qilin. As his divine abilities have matured, it is always he who forces the hands of others. In the Battle of Lake Xian, wasn't the entire Great Song nearly driven to true fury by his actions?"

Tao Jiexing pondered for a time before asking in a low voice, "Then we…"

"We will simply wait for him to arrive."

Xuanwei sat quietly in the pavilion, a hint of derision in his gaze.

"I know what he wants, and I have had enough. They fear Li Zhouwei's momentum is too great; they fear losing Luoxia will hand leverage to the Great Song. Well, I intend to make their worst fears come true!"

His gaze was profound as he looked directly at Tao Jiexing. The youth was no longer the naive fledgling he had been in his early years; a flickering glint could be seen in his eyes.

‘The "they" Grand-Uncle speaks of… is it really the Zhao court and the Seven Aspects? Is he truly cursing those monks… No one will undertake the thankless task of pursuing this matter with our family. At worst, we will offend Jiang Toushou… Is there really a need to play our hidden hand?’

…

Jia Zan rode a beam of light from Yinling and traveled through the Great Void for a time. The ominous feeling in his heart grew ever stronger and his expression gradually darkened. Suddenly, his expression shifted, and he turned to the east.

Across the vast plain, a golden aura surged to the heavens, and there were even faint flashes of lightning!

‘Ruzhou!’

‘There's trouble in the east as well!’

If the Crimson Severing Arrowhead that had just flashed across the sky had made Jia Zan understand that the situation was dire, then the layered radiance illuminating the east was the starkest confirmation, causing his spirits to sink.

‘Ruzhou has also been ambushed! Even if it cannot be conquered quickly, how could the Song people allow those two families to free their hands!’

He snapped his head around, his gaze flickering.

‘And the Tao Clan has lost its patron and seems to be hesitating... Old Daoist Master Qiao has just fallen, and although the Ju Clan has a genius, he is still far from the Purple Mansion Realm…’

A major factor in Jia Zan's willingness to head south was that Ruzhou still had an experienced old Daoist Master and a rising prodigy from the Yang Clan. If the Yu and Yang Clans of Ruzhou were tied down, what good end could possibly await Luoxia?!

‘This means that in Xiangxiang, there are only Jiang Fuwang and Lu Fu. And right now, the only one rushing toward Xiangxiang is me, Jia…’

Once this thought surfaced, Jia Zan found himself unable to move another step. He paused within the Great Void, his expression uncertain, and focused his gaze on the scene ahead.

‘Those two are from prominent clans, after all, and possess an endless supply of treasures. If Li Zhouwei truly came alone, with no reinforcements, it would be impossible for him to crush them. My rushing in recklessly would be of little use…’

‘But if other Song cultivators arrive, I would instead become the weak point for them to break through…’

Had Jia Zan not been unable to tolerate Lu Fu's condescending sermons, leading him to seek refuge in Yinling to be out of sight and out of mind, he would have already left the prefecture to face the enemy, holding his ground while awaiting reinforcements. At this very moment, however, Jia Zan had become the one to grasp the full scope of the situation. The alarm in his eyes intensified as he understood the scene laid out before him.

‘Luoxia's only chance to break this deadlock lies with the Tao Clan. With Xuanwei unwilling to act and no outside aid, Luoxia cannot possibly hold back the Song's advance!’

His gaze shifted slowly, eventually settling on the west. Zanmen Pass was shimmering with light, though it was unclear if it was a response. Jia Zan held no hope—the Zhao court was mired in bickering; they could argue over a single matter seven or eight times. What kind of response could they possibly muster?

‘If I defend the south for them, Zanmen Pass will dispatch troops slower than my Jia family can arrange my funeral!’

The radiance in the south was astonishing, not diminishing in the slightest and even appearing ready to surge into the sky. Jia Zan's urge to turn and flee grew stronger, yet no matter how his expression shifted, he remained rooted to the spot.

‘But Dangshan is still in seclusion…’

The Jia and Wei families had been on good terms for generations. Although he, Jia Zan, was a disappointment who had relied on treasures for his own breakthrough, he had an exceptionally talented nephew, Wei Dangshan, who was currently in Xiangxiang, undergoing secluded cultivation to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm!

‘The Song forces would certainly not harm the members of our two families. I could leave and hide for a year or two to observe the situation. But once Luoxia falls, even if these southern cultivators with their divine abilities wouldn't kill my clan's direct heirs, they would hardly leave our grand formation untouched…’

Even if this King Wei had no intention of killing his own people, the moment the Purple Mansion's grand formation was shattered, Wei Dangshan, cultivating in seclusion within, would face certain death!

At this, Jia Zan had no choice but to ride the winds, cross the Great Void, and approach the south with a heart full of dread. As he expected, he saw a sky filled with crimson. The desert sands churned, and killing intent surged to the heavens.

He cautiously kept his distance and formed a hand seal, touching one finger to the point between his brows and another to his lower abdomen. A divine ability began to brew. His eyes faintly glistened, and soon a multicolored light gathered.

Secret Art of Scrying Hues and Distant Sights!

The sky was golden as the setting sun hung low. Various scenes flashed past his eyes until one came into focus: a Celestial Gate, standing between heaven and earth like a small mountain. It was splendid and regal, wreathed in dense purple flames, its base sunk into a sea of clouds, connecting the heavens and the earth!

Audience with the Celestial Gate!

Within the gate was an expanse of intensely thick radiance. Beneath it, the Heavenly Light shone brilliantly where a golden luminescence struggled ceaselessly, attempting to break free, only to be bound again and again by descending golden chains, dimming with each attempt.

Jia Zan, both shocked and horrified, slowly shifted his gaze.

In the wilds beyond the prefectures of Xiangxiang, a middle-aged man was kneeling, one hand on his spear, barely propping himself up. Though he had broken free from the Crimson Severing Arrowhead, his body was still draped in the blood-red light of the setting sun, a terrifying sight to behold.

"Pfft…"

The man’s head was bowed, his features obscured, as he intermittently coughed up blood. The sight made Jia Zan’s heart tremble. Only when the Daoist Master slowly, bit by bit, raised his head was his mature, weathered, and charismatically masculine face revealed.

Jiang Fuwang.

Half his face was steeped in dark crimson blood, and a bright golden mark stretched from his forehead down to his neck. His silver armor was completely shattered, its fragments scattered like rain upon the fertile earth, casting a shimmering light across the fields.

Every single fragment was priceless, yet not a single cultivator dared to approach.

Although Jiang Fuwang's divine abilities and innate talent were not considered astonishing, his prowess in combat was by no means ordinary. He had once led an expedition into Mobei, subjugating the various tribes and forcing Helian Wujiang to draw a border and retreat, relinquishing a great expanse of fertile land.

While the renown of the Jiang family certainly played a part, the man's exceptional ability could not be denied. Yet this accomplished member of the Jiang family was now on one knee, covered in blood, leaning on his longspear just to stay upright.

‘If even Jiang Fuwang is in this state, what of Lu Fu? He must be trapped beneath that Celestial Gate!’

Jia Zan stiffly followed his gaze.

A young man stood quietly in the twilight of the setting sun.

Compared to Jiang Fuwang's ornate armor, this man's ink-black robes, embroidered with simple golden patterns, seemed far more modest. He stood quietly beneath the Celestial Gate, gazing at the kneeling man before him with what appeared to be a look of appreciation.

Jia Zan no longer cared about such details. He knew only one thing.

Xiangxiang had fallen.

‘How much time has passed? Thirty exchanges? Fifty?’

He stood there, dazed for a moment, but then, under his shocked and startled gaze, the youth slowly turned his head. His face, like that of a demon god, faced north, and his eyes locked directly onto Jia Zan's.

It was a pair of golden eyes that seemed to merge with the sunset's glow.

‘This is bad!’

Jia Zan felt a chill rush through him. He saw the youth's lips move for an instant, as if to say something, but he had no time to hear it. An overwhelming sense of crisis had already seized his heart.

In his last, blurred moment of vision, the youth beneath the Celestial Gate vanished.

The hair on Jia Zan's entire body stood on end as his form dissolved into countless streams of light. The static situation across Xiangxiang suddenly erupted into motion. In that split second, the blood-soaked Daoist Master on the ground disappeared, and the Celestial Gate on the plain was suddenly flung upward as a brilliant golden light flashed out, attempting to escape!

The Daoist Master trapped beneath had been waiting for a long time, needing only this single opportunity!

Pandemonium erupted!

But as Jia Zan frantically activated his divine ability, the vanished youth did not head north. Instead, he reappeared merely a hundred zhang away, now standing atop the Celestial Gate.

His expression was placid, sparing not even a glance for the distant Jia Zan. His black boots shimmered with radiant light as he brought his foot down heavily upon the brilliant Celestial Gate!

“BOOM!”

The Audience with the Celestial Gate, which had just been lifted, plummeted once more. It smashed down at a speed several times faster, landing as if a great mountain had crashed into the earth. A deafening roar echoed out, and a plume of white vapor shot skyward, accompanied by a heaven-shaking, muffled groan!

The Celestial Gate divine ability stabilized once more, but the golden light beneath it seemed to have suffered a fatal blow as it began to flicker erratically.

Only then could the calm voice of King Wei be heard.

"Fellow Daoist Lu! A pity you wasted this final opportunity."

In that instant, Jia Zan's judgment became crystal clear. He did not activate a divine ability, nor did he turn to flee. Instead, he took half a step forward, crossing the distance. His voice arrived before he did, urgent yet laced with respect.

"King Wei!"

In the blood-red sunset, Jia Zan bowed without hesitation and said softly,

"Jia Zan, on behalf of the Jia and Wei families and the people of Xiangxiang, pays his respects to King Wei!"

His eyes remained fixed on the ground and his voice was deferential. Only then did the sense of danger that had enveloped him begin to recede. Jia Zan’s heart still trembled as he lowered his gaze and schooled his features.

The vast, fertile land still glimmered with silver light, as if bathed in moonlight. The middle-aged warrior was nowhere to be seen, and an astonishing silence had fallen over the land. Jia Zan slowly raised his head and finally beheld the presence of King Wei. He possessed a magnificent bearing and a captivating charm that made it difficult to look away. He seemed unconcerned, his fingers glowing as he casually toyed with a small golden cauldron marked with elegant, pure-white patterns, a look of keen interest on his face.

‘The Chenshan Golden Sand Cauldron… Lu Fu even lost his Spiritual Artifact…’

King Wei turned to look at the old man kneeling before him.

"Daoist Master, your words are too heavy. There is no need for such ceremony."

The immense weight in Jia Zan's heart lifted. He scrambled to his feet and said,

"King Wei… Your Majesty's divine might… We are utterly terrified…"

The man before him shook his head gently, his shadow stretched long by the blood-red sunset. His tone was inscrutable.

"Even now, they still dare to underestimate me… The moment we met, instead of using an escape technique, he actually dared to test his divine abilities against mine…"

"Then there is no longer a need to use them."

A chill went through Jia Zan's heart. In that moment, he felt he understood why the world had been so terrified when that emperor had emerged from Guanlong all those years ago, why none had dared to oppose him…

‘The Bright Yang resides on high; to defy it is death. Ah, Lu Fu… your defeat was not unjust…’

In that fleeting moment of reflection, the man before him had already turned his head to gaze south.

Jia Zan silently adjusted his stance to turn as well. Before he could voice the question forming on his lips, his pupils reflected streaks of multicolored light speeding toward them from the south.

His mouth tasted bitter and acrid.

‘Five Daoist Masters!’
