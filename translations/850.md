# Chapter 850: Supreme Yang's Transmuting Radiance

A pure white brilliance shot forth from the snow, stirring up a rolling tide of Supreme Yin radiance. It emerged in the heavens like a great vortex, spreading across the sky until it gradually enveloped the vast complex of palaces that stood amidst the ethereal clouds and mist.

The next moment, a pure, golden-red dawn shimmered in the east as the hazy, silver-white light of a bright moon set in the west. The world within the Immortal Mirror, once perpetually dim, hazy, and shrouded in dark clouds, vanished. In its place, the crystal-clear splendor of the sun and moon shone forth.

This newly carved-out grotto-heaven presented the wondrous sight of the sun and moon sharing the sky. The world was vast and boundless, wreathed in clouds and mist—unconnected to the heavens above or the earth below, composed of nothing but layer upon layer of swirling vapors.

Lu Jiangxian manifested his form within it and gauged the world’s size. It was roughly a hundred li across, similar to the Li Clan’s Pingya Island. However, with its vertical dimension, the space felt significantly larger, forming an almost spherical domain.

But this was far from the grotto-heaven’s limit. *The Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core* built a world based on one’s Attainment, using divine abilities and dharma power as its foundation. As he continued to channel his power into it, this realm would expand bit by bit until his Attainment could no longer sustain it.

'Still, like all grotto-heavens, this realm has no connection to the Great Void. It won't generate its own fire or water veins, and it can only contain things aligned with my own Attainment. It can’t be considered a truly complete world…'

'More importantly, a grotto-heaven doesn't naturally nurture spiritual objects. Without a link to the mortal realm, it can barely gather any spiritual energy, relying only on what little it can draw from the Great Void.'

Lu Jiangxian’s grotto-heaven was even more isolated, completely cut off from the Great Void. This meant that if he didn't actively channel his own divine power and Supreme Yin essence into it, the world would be almost entirely devoid of spiritual energy.

"As it stands, the divine power flowing from the Immortal Mirror is endless. In a year, I can add another space the size of Pingya Island. In ten, it could rival Moongaze Lake, and in a century, it might compare to the entire domain of the Azure Pond Sect…"

"That’s not slow at all. Once the Immortal Palace is the size of Moongaze Lake, if I forbid flight and fill it with pavilions and towers, no one would ever be able to tell how large it truly is."

Lu Jiangxian had once entered *Anhuai Heaven*, the grotto-heaven left behind by the renowned True Monarch Tianwu of True Qi. By his estimation, that domain was less than half the size of the Azure Pond Sect’s territory.

He gave a light wave of his sleeve, and wisps of Supreme Yin radiance streamed out, coalescing among the clouds at his feet. They rapidly formed a seemingly endless, pale-white platform. One after another, osmanthus trees sprouted from the ground, and at the very center, a moon-white round table adorned with profound patterns rose into place.

He strode to the table, and with another sweep of his sleeve, an assortment of items appeared upon its surface.

The first things to catch his eye were two small pots. One was formed from the demon body and divine ability of Shaohui; the other held the dharma body and soul of the male peacock. Both contained the concentrated essence of a Purple Mansion Realm demon beast.

He could have used both pots to expand the grotto-heaven, saving himself two or three years of effort. But while his divine power was inexhaustible, the essence of a Purple Mansion Realm expert was not so easily obtained. It would be even more difficult to acquire once Pristine Water returned.

Beside them lay a golden pearl and a azure talisman. The pearl was a vessel for all the karma and fate left behind by Li Xuanfeng—useless for now. The talisman was for Li Zhouwei, intended to help him directly form a second divine ability after he broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm.

Finally, there was a faint, finger-sized sliver of silver light.

This was a remnant of the divinatory power he had obtained from Liu Changdie long ago. It was an extension of the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination, a technique that had served him well in his early years. After using most of it, he had kept this thumb-sized piece for reference.

'There's still no trace of the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination…'

After so many years of growth, Lu Jiangxian had a new theory about the talisman’s location.

"It must be like the Immortal Dao Wall, hidden away in some grotto-heaven or secret realm. That would explain why Liu Changdie came into contact with the talisman but left no trail. He must have accidentally stumbled upon the entrance to that hidden domain…"

"His activities were centered around Lixia Prefecture, stretching to Yuebei and Jiangbei… There are only a handful of grotto-heavens in that area. The Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven and Anhuai Heaven can be ruled out. That leaves Wanling Heaven of the Wanling Upper Sect and Donghua Heaven of the Moonlight Origin Mansion."

Although Wanling Heaven was not connected to the mortal realm, it interacted with the Great Void to draw in spiritual energy. Lu Jiangxian knew for a fact it was located in Jiangbei. But the Moonlight Origin Mansion’s Donghua Heaven was a mystery. It might have been completely severed from the Great Void, as he hadn’t been able to find a single trace of it.

'And then there’s another, more terrifying possibility… Based on Li Jiangqun’s memories… his past life was the master of the Moonlight Origin Mansion… So what if the so-called Donghua Heaven… is this very world within the Immortal Mirror!'

If that hypothesis held true, then the Talisman of Grand Heavenly Divination was likely in Wanling Heaven or some other secret realm hidden within Jiangbei.

He pondered this for a moment before his divine sense flew out of his realm, crossed the Great Void, and descended before the Immortal Dao Wall.

***

Chi Buzi sat with his head bowed and eyes tightly shut, seemingly oblivious to the faintly glowing formation before him. Dazzling light scattered down from the sea’s surface, draping the blue-robed man in its brilliance.

Lu Jiangxian’s gaze swept past him and settled on the vast ocean.

Although Chi Buzi had flown deep into the abyss, this was no longer the bottom of the Eastern Sea. Buried beneath layers of restrictive formations was an even greater immortal-grade formation. And this place was a secret realm, carved out by a powerful cultivator on top of that immortal array.

'Chi Buzi, like the cultivators of the Three Sects and Seven Gates, believes he has passed through the layered barriers and entered the immortal formation itself. He’s wrong… They were transported to a different place entirely… an independent space.'

'It's just that this secret realm happens to connect to the mortal world from within the immortal formation…'

That was why this place had no connection to the Great Void. It was why Li Jiangqun had dared to bring his friends here for open discussion, even boasting that no True Monarch could spy on them.

And this secret realm was unlike any other Lu Jiangxian had ever seen.

This secret realm dared to hang a sun in its sky.

Above the thin layer of seawater at the bottom was a terrifying expanse of Golden Crow Transmuting Radiance. And if one were to pass through that massive, thousand-zhang-tall field of profound light, they would reach the apex of the secret realm—a blazing Supreme Yang star, radiating with boundless light.

The stars in the heavens were not without meaning. In ancient texts, every star was linked to a Fruition Attainment, an Auxiliary Position, or an Intercalary Position. Even the Comet Star, which fell outside the domain of the ancient Time Rulers, was a signifier of Cultivation Transcendence. Although the world was now fractured and the celestial order in chaos, the stars would still respond when a True Monarch acted.

When True Monarch Taiyuan had made his move, the Taibai Star had stirred in the sky. To this day, famous correlations remained, such as Li Fire with the star Yinghuo, and Upright Wood with the star Suixing.

As for the Supreme Yang and Supreme Yin, everyone knew their significance. They hung nakedly in the sky. The Supreme Yang Fruition Attainment pointed to Yingze. Unless one was a True Monarch under that immortal’s command, no one would—or could—hang a sun in their own grotto-heaven. It would be no different from acting directly under that immortal’s watch.

Of the many grotto-heavens Lu Jiangxian knew of, this secret realm was the only one that dared to display a sun. This meant that even if the immortal formation wasn't Yingze’s own handiwork, it was undeniably a creation of the Supreme Yang Dao.

The thousand-zhang pillar of Golden Crow Transmuting Radiance further cemented his conclusion.

Golden Crow Transmuting Radiance was a Golden Core-level phenomenon, a burst of light released from the entanglement of a Supreme Yang Fruition Attainment and its Auxiliary Position. This radiance typically lasted only for an instant before fracturing into eighty-one types of spiritual light, each one a treasure on par with Lustful Merging Fire.

'Forget Chi Buzi. Even if Pristine Water himself were here, if that thousand-zhang torrent of Golden Crow Transmuting Radiance came down on him… Du Qing could just pack it in.'

'This was Li Jiangqun’s true confidence! This is why he dared claim that no True Monarch would dare to look, much less approach!'

The external immortal formations were formidable, but not enough to completely halt a True Monarch. Someone like Cultivation Transcendence could probably bypass them entirely. But the Golden Crow Transmuting Radiance was a true sword of Damocles hanging overhead.

'After all, no one knows the criteria for its judgment. Does it kill any and all intruders, or does it judge based on morality and merit? No Golden Core cultivator would risk their life to find out…'

'In that case, Li Jiangqun’s intention in inviting everyone here is obvious. He wasn't some defenseless fool… This was likely a show of force…'

Lu Jiangxian slowly withdrew his gaze, leaving the Golden Crow Transmuting Radiance untouched. He had his own Supreme Yin Profound Light and had no use for it. He followed a mountain path down to a stone table.

The table was covered in bronze wine vessels, some upright, some toppled, all long since empty. The neat arrangement of some hinted at their owners' personalities. He scanned the table until his divine sense landed on a white outer robe.

The robe was as white as snow, with faint, subtle silver Supreme Yin patterns along the edges. The design was remarkably simple, with a small, crescent-moon-shaped piece of jade at the collar that pulsed with a gentle light.

It was a dharma robe, and a peculiar one at that. Though it emitted not a single trace of spiritual energy, it exuded an almost imperceptible air of nobility.

With just a sweep of his divine sense, Lu Jiangxian knew it must have belonged to Li Jiangqun, who had left the treasure here.

'Li Jiangqun’s death… it’s too suspicious…'

Another item on the table was a jade pot that appeared utterly mundane. Yet Lu Jiangxian understood that this was the reason Chi Buzi dared not approach.

Though it looked plain, the pot was filled with a sea of sword intent, a roiling ocean of power ready to erupt at any moment and annihilate any cultivator who drew near.

This was undoubtedly Li Jiangqun’s sword intent.

As one of the most powerful cultivators in the Purple Mansion Realm, Li Jiangqun's bottled intent was more than enough to instill deep fear in Chi Buzi. For all his strength and his many spiritual artifacts, Chi Buzi was no match for the likes of Li Jiangqun or Duanmu Kui.

Lu Jiangxian observed it for a moment longer before departing. At that same instant, the light from the formation before Chi Buzi finally faded. The green-eyed man opened his eyes a beat later and let out a long sigh.

He lowered his gaze, and with a light wave of his sleeve, he erased the formation he had drawn on the sandy ground. Only then did he rise, bow deeply, and dissipate into a streak of azure light.

***

**East A-Wang Sea**

The East A-Wang Sea was a vast region dotted with numerous islands. The most famous was White Sand Island on its easternmost edge. The island was a local marvel, covered in dense jungles and boiling hot springs, a place where water and fire veins intertwined.

While such scenery was merely average on the mainland, here on the fringe of the outer seas, it was a prime location. It had once been the base of the Kui Ling Sect, the region’s former leader, but now it was bustling with people coming and going.

Past a mixture of old and new cultivation abodes, the grand hall at the island’s highest point finally projected an air of authority. A spiritual formation shimmered around it, and the doors to the cultivation chamber were sealed shut. Inside, a cultivator in white-gold Daoist robes was meditating with his eyes closed.

After an unknown amount of time, he finally let out a long breath. The Profound Light at the center of his brow flashed faintly, illuminating the entire hall.

'Taking that spirit pill really boosted my cultivation!'

Li Ximing had used two major medicinal ingredients—either of which would make numerous Purple Mansion Realm cultivators green with envy—to refine a batch of Supreme Yin Dao spirit pills. He had produced a total of three. Before entering seclusion, he consumed one to advance his cultivation.

The pill was refined from his own essence and used on himself, making its absorption incredibly fast and its effects profound. It had drastically shortened the time needed to cultivate his divine ability. After a period of focused cultivation, his *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was now nearly halfway to completion—an achievement he could call a minor success.

A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's first divine ability was meant to be simpler, as it didn’t require building from the immortal foundation up. But Li Ximing's journey had been a series of stumbles, constantly either injured or on the run. This pill had not only made up for the lost time but had even pushed him further ahead.

'It would be best if I had some Bright Yang treasures… Alas, ancient spiritual artifacts are too precious. If Yuanxiu were willing to lend me the Huai River Map, my progress would be a thousand li a day…'

He mentally checked the contents of his storage bag. Although he was in peak condition, he had already used up his Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill. Without any Purple Mansion Realm healing pills on hand, he felt a constant sense of unease.

'I should take a trip out of seclusion anyway, refine some more pills. Besides, the island has been trembling occasionally these past few days. Something might be happening outside. I should check on it.'

Li Ximing stepped out of his cultivation chamber. The hall was silent and empty. A few cultivators stood guard outside, but even as Li Ximing walked right past them, they remained completely oblivious, standing perfectly still.

After Tinglan had left, Li Ximing had found this place suitable and entered seclusion on the spot. He had casually grabbed two or three local cultivators and ordered them to watch over the island, lest another group of demonic cultivators arrived to practice their blood-refining arts.

He had even warned them specifically not to cause trouble using his name. Now, seeing these unfamiliar faces, his expression cooled. With a single step, he vanished into the Great Void.

***

His form dissolved into light and quickly reformed on another high platform, where he saw a group of Qi Refining cultivators gathered, discussing something with grave expressions.

They were being respectful, at least. A fine jade table was set up spaciously, with cultivators of all kinds seated on either side. The grand seat at the head of the table was empty, clearly meant to represent Li Ximing.

Even in his absence, his name was worthy of being hung up as a signboard.

Ignoring the formation on the platform as if it weren't there, he strode in and materialized beside the imposing immortal seat, frowning as he took in the scene.

The sudden appearance of the white-gold figure threw the entire platform into silence. The cultivator at the head of the group stared in shock for a moment, then his face contorted in terror. He fell from his seat as if he’d seen a ghost and began kowtowing frantically.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

That cry broke the dam. The scrape of chairs, the splash of spilled wine, and the frantic shuffle of feet filled the air, soon replaced by the dull thud of foreheads hitting the floor. By the time Li Ximing turned around, he was met with the sight of cultivators prostrating themselves, trembling all over.

Li Ximing’s voice was soft. "Where are the others? I told them not to cause trouble in my name. Did they not understand?"

The white-haired cultivator at the front was shaking so hard he couldn’t stop kowtowing. "Daoist Master," he stammered respectfully, "it’s the cultivators of the East A-Wang Sea… they all heard a Daoist Master was in seclusion on White Sand Island… and they came here on their own to trade. Now… White Sand Island is the largest market in the entire East A-Wang Sea… No one has established a sect…"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow. Glancing down, he saw that the buildings were indeed a mix of old and new. The unknown sect from long ago had left behind a massive formation, which the cultivators of the East A-Wang Sea were now using to eke out a living.

"The Kui Ling Sect was destroyed, and the few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the East A-Wang Sea are gone. The demon beasts are rampant… Everyone looks to White Sand Island for safety and has settled nearby…"

Li Ximing understood.

A Daoist Master like him was a figure people would kneel to even on the mainland, let alone in the barren and desolate outer seas. The East A-Wang Sea was already impoverished. When its cultivators heard of such a powerful figure, they stopped their squabbling and, united as one, flocked to him like ants, hoping to borrow a sliver of his protection.

'So this is the mess left behind by the fall of the Kui Ling Sect…'

Li Ximing frowned. Amidst the chaos, he heard an old man being carried up from below. Finally, a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator had arrived. Unfortunately, everything below his abdomen had been bitten off. With a face ashen pale, he looked up and said in a broken voice, "Daoist Master… the demon beasts are out of control… We truly had no choice…"

Clearly, the old man knew that using Li Ximing’s name was a deadly gamble and that his seclusion would eventually end. He had been drinking poison to quench his thirst.

'…'

The crowd was silent, trembling in fear. Li Ximing could see at a glance that the man was afflicted with a cold poison and would not live long. He had likely consumed some blood qi just to survive this long. Li Ximing sighed internally, but his expression remained glacial. He glanced at the old man and said with a frown, "Stand and speak."

As the words fell, his Bright Yang divine ability flared. In an instant, the old man’s lower body grew back. The cold poison was incinerated, and the dark cloud hanging over his face dispersed. He covered his face and wept, collapsing to his knees once more.

Li Ximing asked, "Since you borrowed my authority, where did these demon beasts find their courage?"

The old man trembled. "They… they were wary at first, but later they made inquiries. They captured a few cultivators for questioning and even asked the nobles of other seas. After that, they stopped believing…"

The demon beasts knew little of the situation and certainly didn’t know it was Li Ximing cultivating here. Unless they asked the Dragon-kin, their inquiries would have been useless. Annoyed with the hassle, he turned and ordered, "Relay my command. Tell those demon generals to get over here and see me."

He had barely finished speaking when dark clouds swarmed the sky and the waves began to churn violently. A sharp, piercing roar split the air. Everyone looked up to see the sky turn grim and the sea roil into towering waves.

From the high platform, they could see an army of shrimp soldiers and crab generals standing on the waves, surrounding a sinister-looking youth in a dark green robe with long whiskers on his forehead.

"You, with the surname Wu!" the demon beast roared, his voice like thunder. His two whiskers stood proudly in the air as he stood upon the waves.

Just then, the Great Void suddenly ripped open, and a flash of golden light appeared.

*Smack!*

Before the demons could even see what happened, a palm had already struck the demon general’s face. The green-robed youth’s head spun around several times before snapping backwards, leaving the dark back of his head facing the island. His blood-streaked face stared blankly at his own troops, eyelids still twitching mechanically.

Only then did everyone see a man in a white-gold Daoist robe standing before him, his expression grim.

The Profound Light on the man’s brow flashed. With a single glance, the demon beasts on the waves tumbled into the sea like rain. He retracted his gaze, stepped back into the Great Void, and vanished.

*Thud!*

Li Ximing reappeared on the immortal seat on the high platform. He casually tossed the demon general to the ground like a piece of trash. The creature’s life force was tenacious, so it was still alive. It didn't dare turn its head back around, instead lying chest-down, its face pale and lips trembling.

The cultivators felt little joy, only a profound, unspoken terror.

'A late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm demon general… taken down with a single slap…'

Li Ximing had been disturbed several times during his cultivation. Although they were just tremors and he wasn't at a critical breakthrough point, disturbing a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was an offense for which this demon could die a hundred times over and it still wouldn't be enough.

Besides, all he had wanted was to cultivate in peace. Although revealing his presence wasn't as dangerous now, and others wouldn't necessarily know which Daoist Master was here, the fact that this demon had forced the cultivators of the East A-Wang Sea to rely on his name was, ultimately, an annoyance.

On the mainland, a Foundation Establishment Realm demon would only be a general. In a desolate place like this, he was probably considered a Demon King. This one cultivated a Pristine Water art and had the appearance of a shrimp-Flood Dragon. Forcing his patience, Li Ximing managed a smile and asked, "What's your background, to dare disturb my cultivation?"

Seeing that the demon could only beg for mercy and couldn't form a coherent sentence, Li Ximing knew what kind of creature he was dealing with. He kicked the demon in the chest, sealing its cultivation. His heart was cold.

'Practicing a Pristine Water art and a shrimp-Flood Dragon type, no less. You're truly unlucky to have run into me.'

He picked up the demon, preparing to go back and refine it into a pill, but noticed that everyone on the ground was still trembling. Li Ximing watched them in silence for a moment, which only made them tremble more.

The old man, his face now pale from fear instead of poison, approached again. He prostrated himself at Li Ximing's feet, shaking like a leaf in the wind. "Daoist… Daoist Master," he stammered, "thirty-six days ago, the… the Upper Sect from the West Curtain Sea to the west, the Panorama Immortal Gate, sent someone. They said they were here to… to pay their respects to you…"

Li Ximing was slightly surprised. "Their information network is quite impressive," he remarked.

The comment sent the old man into a fit of terrified kowtowing.

"Did they say why they were looking for me?" Li Ximing asked casually. "What is this Daoist tradition’s background?"

The old man shook his head repeatedly, bowed again, and finally said, "They only said… only said that someone had recommended them…"

At these words, Li Ximing’s expression became thoughtful. He released the demon in his hand and sat down on the immortal seat, his gaze on the Flood Dragon on the floor softening considerably.

'Someone recommended them… I wonder who. It's a clear signal that they already know my identity… but they're approaching with friendly intentions… wanting to meet me.'

'In that case, this foolish demon might not have been truly bold and reckless. It's possible the other party had some urgent matter and used a Life Divine Ability to stir the waves, hoping to draw me out of seclusion…'

Li Ximing mulled it over for a few seconds, looking at the creature on the ground, and shook his head internally.

"It must be that the outer seas demon beasts are just brainless. Otherwise, that would have been far too disrespectful."
