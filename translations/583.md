# Chapter 905: Realization In Hindsight

The Li Family had always been highly efficient. Li Chenghuai had already prepared numerous spirit items and arrived with his entourage while Li Xijun walked along the edge of the island and listened to the formation masters’ explanations.

Unlike the robe style worn by the Xiyue generation, Li Chenghuai wore the pleated garments commonly seen among esteemed family scions. His dark-blue wide sleeves were embroidered with black leaf patterns, layered inside and out with an elegant finish. A white mourning robe was draped over it, and he clasped his hands in greeting with graceful decorum.

Li Chenghuai was not particularly handsome; as a youth, he had looked even more ordinary. Now in his thirties, his steady demeanor lent him a more agreeable presence. Having recently taken charge of the family’s affairs, he exuded youthful vigor and confidence.

"Eighth uncle!" Li Chenghuai said, "I’ve brought all the spirit items. A few clan members and allied families who are skilled in formations came along as well... perhaps they can lend a hand."

The spirit items he referred to clearly included more than just those Metal Virtue treasures, it also encompassed a large array of formation materials. Though they were not very valuable, organizing them still took effort.

Li Xijun nodded lightly and said, "The masters are all here, coordinate with them and discuss the plans together."

Li Chenghuai landed on the island and quickly began conversing with the others. Since arranging the formation wouldn’t be a quick task, Li Xijun handed the island’s affairs over to him and rode Chilling Snow northward toward Mount Qingdu.

Li Xuanxuan was engaged in casual conversation with the elderly cultivator He Jiumen within the great hall. Both elders had witnessed a century of transformation at Moongaze Lake, and once they started chatting, they found much in common.

These aged cultivators had a deep-seated fear of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. When He Jiumen saw Li Xijun enter from outside the hall, he immediately stood up in alarm, respectfully stepped aside, apologized twice, and hurriedly withdrew.

Only after seeing him retreat did Li Xuanxuan’s smile drop away. He stroked his beard. "Fellow Daoist He knows the western shore well. I was getting to know him better. If we send a few of our juniors to study under him, perhaps we can gain some skill in artifact forging too."

Li Xijun respectfully nodded and replied, "He’s eager to draw close to you, my lord. That’s understandable. If you’re inclined to build ties, it would indeed be a good thing."

He shifted the topic slightly, a trace of worry in his expression, and spoke softly, "Breaking the forbidden formation won’t be too difficult nor too costly. But the island at the heart of the lake still needs a new formation. That’s the real challenge.

"Leaving cost aside, with Elder Liu Changdie absent and no reliable master of our own, we don’t even have the opportunity to set up the formation!"

Li Xuanxuan furrowed his white brows. Both of them knew all too well that the grand formation on the island at the heart of the lake would become the foundation of their family’s future. If they were to enlist a sect or immortal family to set it up, it would mean placing their own safety in the hands of others.

The Li Family had seen such cases many times before. The Yu Family’s market had been breached by Jiang Heqian, and outsiders came and went freely through the Fei Family’s grand formation. These were all cautionary tales. The only person they could truly trust, Liu Changdie, had gone missing. This was undoubtedly a thorny matter.

Li Xijun spoke softly, "Besides, this island is far too large. Ordinary formation masters won’t be able to handle it. It will require a great deal of spirit items and likely won’t be completed in a short time."

Hearing the shift in his tone, Li Xuanxuan asked aloud, "What you mean is..."

Li Xijun replied, "Why not wait until the forbidden formation is lifted, then have several formation masters work together to set up a Qi Cultivation Realm formation first? That way, the island at the heart of the lake will be enclosed, and the entire lake can be integrated. As for the main formation itself, we can discuss it further in the future."

He shook his head lightly and murmured, "The disciple from Changxiao Gate doesn’t have much time left overseas. Brother Ming hasn’t said anything, but we really shouldn’t keep delaying. If we miss the timing, it would leave regrets."

Li Xuanxuan nodded heavily. After mulling it over and studying his expression, he asked tentatively, "Was Xizhi’s return this time rather warm?"

Li Xijun paused in surprise and replied, "How could you say that, my lord? Brother Zhi returned despite his busy schedule specifically to resolve the matter of the western shore. He didn’t dare linger and returned to the sect immediately, which is why he didn’t have time to pay his respects."

Li Xuanxuan sighed. The old man was still dwelling on the matter of Li Yuexiang. When he had sent her away earlier, he had sighed about failing to cherish one’s own siblings. Now there was no time for grief, but he still worried about the brothers’ relationship.

He advised gently, "You are different from Ximing and Xizhi. You bear the responsibility of watching over the family, so some sacrifices are inevitable. It’s best if they can understand that..."

Li Xijun hadn’t expected him to bring up Li Ximing. His hand strayed to the hilt of his sword. He drew it, and wiped the blade, shaking his head as he said, "There's not much meaning in your words, my lord. Uncle Yuanjiao told me long ago that managing a household is the same as bearing guilt. This matter was my fault; there’s no need to say more."

He sheathed his sword and took his leave to go find Li Ximing on the mountain. Li Xuanxuan remained where he was, lost in thought. Suddenly, he remembered his younger sister, put down the cup in his hand, and paced around the hall for most of the day, still steeped in regret.

***

In the blink of a few months, several auxiliary formations were set up on the island at the heart of the lake, faintly glowing amidst the reeds by the shore.

Li Chenghuai waited with his men by the lake. Soon, three streaks of dharma light descended from the sky; thunder, frost, and radiant light intertwined in a brilliant display. Li Chenghuai cupped his hands in greeting, while the elders behind him all dropped to their knees in unison.

"Welcome, my lord!"

Li Qinghong had become quite renowned by now. Her thunder had swept along the riverbanks, saving many cultivators. Many had witnessed her thunderous might with their own eyes, leading to her name being spread across many clans, with titles of all sorts flying everywhere.

The Si Family had keen eyes and were close to the Li Family, so they were happy to stir up attention. Thus, the Azure Pond Sect called her the Celestial Thunder Sparrow. But since Li Qinghong cultivated Celestial Thunder and also wielded a Profound Thunder dharma artifact, various families referred to her alternately as Profound Thunder or Celestial Thunder, which caused quite a bit of confusion.

Over the past half year, even the cultivators of the Azure Pond Sect, and Si Yuanli himself had begun using the title Celestial Thunder Sparrow in several public occasions. As a result, her name had become well known, and those present recognized her and treated her with even greater respect.

Formation Master Lin was the first to step forward and respectfully said, "The grand formation is ready. We humbly request the lord to bestow the treasure."

Li Qinghong nodded gently. Behind her, Li Xijun proffered a pale-white longbow and said solemnly, "This was used by one of our elders to guard the riverbanks. It is named White Lightning."

As soon as those words were spoken, Li Chenghuai quietly looked up. The others froze in place, then looked at White Lightning in shock and awe, thoughts running through their minds, So this is the famed White Lightning.

Li Xuanfeng had used it to slay eighteen Buddhist cultivators; it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call it the foremost bow in Jiangnan. Formation Master Lin quickly received it, the bow’s aura like blades across his face. He placed it into the formation and stepped back to observe.

Soon, golden energy surged atop the auxiliary formation, with thunder rolling within. Formation Master Lin let out a sigh as he said, "Congratulations, my lords. This artifact is exceptional. Dispersing the residual thunder within the formation will be effortless with the strength of just three of you! It’s only equivalent to the strength of four or five cultivators."

Li Xijun did the math in his head. Both Li Ximing and Li Qinghong were late stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators with profound cultivation. They certainly couldn’t be considered average Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

"Since White Lightning alone is sufficient, there’s no need to bring out the Six Xin Harmonising Metal Token," muttered Li Xijun.

Though the Six Xin Harmonising Metal Token had lost its miraculous properties, it was still an ancient spirit artifact made of rare material. If it could be kept hidden from public view, so much the better.

Li Xijun merely said, "Let’s begin, then."

Several streaks of brilliance shot out with a flick of his sleeve.

Zimu Profound Gold was roughly the size of a fist, its surface a luminous white and covered in dense patterns of dark-gold etchings. Heartsway Gold was slightly smaller, pale-golden in hue, with no particularly remarkable features.

The Black Profound Gold, made of Geng Metal, was a scattered patch of black. They were remnants from when Chimen Difu’s dharma artifact had exploded years ago. They had also borrowed Ritual Pearl Gold from Profound Peak Gate, which formed a tiny mound of gold grains no larger than rice.

Li Xijun sent the four spirit items to land at their respective formation nodes. Instantly, the central formation’s White Lightning flared brilliantly.

Formation Master Lin immediately rose with the wind. He brushed his storage pouch with practiced hands and revealed a sword at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. He raised it high and flicked his finger hard against the sword’s spine.

Clang!

The sword trembled heavily as visible cracks ran down its length, but it didn’t break. Formation Master Lin looked momentarily awkward. He quickly lifted the sword and struck it three or four times against the dharma light at the edge of the formation. Only then did a crack ring out, and the sword split in two.

Formation Master Lin had already discussed this beforehand with Li Chenghuai, who stepped forward and explained with a wave of his sleeve, "This is a formation rite passed down through Master Lin’s dao lineage. It’s said to increase the chance of success."

Li Xijun nodded slightly, and the grand formation beneath his feet rumbled to life. Several streams of mana poured into the array’s core as dark clouds filled the sky.

Li Qinghong nodded as well as she said, "Interesting."

Sure enough, the forbidden formation began to flicker. The thunder within seemed to be drawn by some force and surged outward. White Lightning gleamed brilliantly and soared into the sky.

Li Qinghong continued to channel mana into the formation and watched as White Lightning devoured the thunder in the sky like a great whale drinking water. She murmured, "Residual thunder falling into metal... Perhaps it’s not a phenomenon exclusive to formations. If a skilled artifact smith were to forge a specialized dharma artifact, it wouldn’t be difficult. We should pay more attention to this in the future."

"I understand, senior." Li Xijun had already resolved to keep this firmly in mind. After all, their family possessed a Dao lineage in thunder arts, which was considered prominent even in Jiangnan. How could he not be concerned with such matters?

As the two exchanged words, the thunder in the sky had noticeably diminished. Empowered by the mana of all three, White Lightning inhaled with full force, digesting all the heavenly thunder. Meanwhile, the forbidden formation underground continued spewing thunder upward, but now it was clearly running dry.

After another fifteen minutes, the forbidden formation began drawing on the surrounding spiritual energy. The formation masters had anticipated this and simultaneously activated several auxiliary formations to lock down the surrounding energy, preventing it from being absorbed.

If this had still been the high-grade ancient formation of the past situated in a prime location, these few auxiliary formations wouldn’t have been able to seal off even a trace of spiritual energy. But it was now merely the remnant of a forbidden formation. Unable to draw energy, it began flickering weakly.

Boom!

Fifteen minutes later, the formation was finally exhausted. It let out a series of faint rumbles before slowly vanishing from the island at the heart of the lake, dissolving into countless arcs of lightning and mystic light that disappeared cleanly into the air.

A rich wave of spiritual energy erupted, leaving Li Chenghuai feeling refreshed and clear-minded. As he looked around he saw lush grass growing everywhere and, in the distance, four broken stone pillars still standing at the island’s core. The forbidden formation that had shrouded the island for nearly a century had finally dissipated.

"Congratulations, my lord."

Li Xijun let his hands drop as he exhaled slowly. After calculating, he realized he had expended half of his mana. When he checked on Li Ximing and his aunt Li Qinghong, both had steady auras. Li Qinghong had used up thirty percent, while Li Ximing had only consumed nearly twenty percent.

The two were far more advanced than him in cultivation, so Li Xijun wasn’t surprised. Li Ximing’s technique was of an even higher grade than either of theirs, making it easier for him to bear the load.

The three of them landed in front of the formation. Li Chenghuai had already retrieved the spirit items from the formation. As expected, the Black Profound Gold and Ritual Pearl Gold were not only unharmed but gleamed even more brilliantly, their quality seemingly improved.

As for the Heartsway Gold and Zimu Profound Gold, they had already vanished without a trace. Only the two other spirit items remained. Without even glancing at them, Li Qinghong accepted them and waited until the others had offered their words of blessing before speaking warmly, "Since you all are here, I’d like to trouble you to design a Qi Cultivation Realm formation for our family. One that covers the entire island will suffice. If you need anything, feel free to speak with Chenghuai."

Li Chenghuai stepped forward with a nod, and the few old men instantly beamed with joy.

The reward for breaking the forbidden remnant formation earlier had been modest, and yet several of them had competed to join in purely to hone their formation arts. But this new formation job was truly profitable, and since the island at the heart of the lake was so large, the profit they’d share was nothing small. Naturally, they accepted the task with utmost reverence.

Li Qinghong rode lightning back, landing alongside Li Xijun on Mount Qingdu. Only then did she flick her sleeve and release the two spirit items. One of the spirit items appeared fluid in form, so Li Qinghong’s mana formed it into a sphere the size of a head. It glowed like a miniature sun.

Li Ximing examined it for a while and said softly, "This seems to be Feathered Gold Liquid, a substance of the Geng Metal attribute. It disappeared many years ago. I was only able to recognize it thanks to the Gold Aura Profound Inquiry Technique."

Li Xijun usually didn’t have much time to read cultivation manuals, but he immediately understood. Li Xuanfeng’s storage pouch contained three ancient techniques. The first was Gold Aura Profound Inquiry Technique, the second was Meditative Chant, and the third was Clear Dew Origin Manual. Judging by the phrasing of these texts, they most likely came from the Three Drums Wall of Green Pine Grotto Heaven and could no longer be cultivated due to the disappearance of spiritual qi.

But the Gold Aura Profound Inquiry Technique required Feathered Gold Qi, which was refined from Feathered Gold Liquid. Now that they had obtained this substance, the technique could finally be cultivated!

Li Qinghong nodded slightly and mused aloud, "Having Metal, Fire, and Water attributes is sufficient for a technique suitable for core disciples. If it also includes Thunder, Frost, and Bright Yang, it becomes far less vulnerable to countering."

The other spirit item was only the size of a fingernail, and was gray-golden in color. It was also icy to the touch, and extremely tough. The three of them took turns examining it but failed to identify it. It was likely some ancient and extinct material.

Li Xijun stored both items away, looking thoughtful. He glanced at the other two and said quietly, "This whole matter has given me some ideas... We only converted Dui Metal into Geng Metal to dispel the residual thunder. But thinking further, if we can find more residual thunder, it could become a way to obtain spirit items that no longer exist in this world.

"These items are ancient secrets, so surely some sects still retain traces of their lore. There may be more methods of elemental conversion that could enable core disciples of immortal sects to cultivate ancient techniques long thought unusable due to spiritual qi's absence..."

Li Ximing immediately thought of something and was about to speak, but Li Xijun beat him to it, "Brother, do you remember the Yang Nourishing Technique?"

"Of course I do!" replied Li Ximing.

Li Yuanjiao had discovered that technique the first time he met Tu Longjian; it had been read from a jade slip on his person. It allowed the mutual transformation of spiritual flames. Their family had converted Profound Yang Li Fire into Long Marching Fire Essence through it, allowing their disciples to practice the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique!

Having heard this much, Li Ximing naturally understood. He said quietly, "We only ever used that technique once, and it’s been gathering dust at home ever since. But it’s likely a thousand times more valuable than we thought! Most Fire Virtue techniques that others can’t cultivate... may be nothing to us now."

Li Xijun nodded deeply in agreement. Li Ximing exhaled and lowered his eyes. "He truly is favored by the heavens... Even a random jade slip found on his body contains treasures that ordinary sects spend centuries chasing in vain... Fate, how profoundly unjust it is!"
