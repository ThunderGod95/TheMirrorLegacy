# Chapter 1219: A Change of Plans

The high mountains rolled on, magnificent and spectacular. From their peaks, one could clearly see the yellow sands churning below, where formation platforms stood tall. Buildings of white and gold, inscribed with profound patterns, dotted the desert landscape, lending it an exceptional beauty.

Li Que'wan commanded a Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure, sitting primly atop one of these high mountains. In her hands, she held a small, palm-sized jade cauldron that emitted a constantly shifting silver light, her gaze carrying a hint of worry.

Chen Yin had not actually left in a great hurry; he had even gone to Gardenia Scenery Mountain to find Li Jiangqian. However, his purpose had been to free Li Jiangqian up, so he understood that it was perfectly normal for the prince not to be on the mountain. After leaving a warning talisman, he departed in haste.

With him gone, Li Que'wan naturally had to personally oversee matters on this side of the great desert. In truth, there had been no trouble these past days, but she had heard no word of her brother's whereabouts.

‘In the blink of an eye, more than seven months have passed… and still no news…’

These last six months, Great Song had remained peaceful, focused on recuperation. Western Shu, however, had already invaded the lands of Long for nearly half a year, and the events that unfolded there were a series of constant upheavals.

First, Wei Xuanyin led the great northern cultivator, Daoist Master Zhu Kui, into a great battle against Qing Jifang and his forces in Long. Qing Jifang had left one Great Daoist Master behind to guard against Xiangxiong, so he entered Long with two Great Daoist Masters as well. The battle was earth-shattering, a back-and-forth struggle that raged for seven full days. The celestial phenomena changed several times, but the master of the Profound Governance Pavilion proved his might; even though he was at a disadvantage in the number of Purple Mansion cultivators, he still managed to block Western Shu’s ferocious assault.

Yet within those seven days, a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator from the north, relying on his own strength, fought against many. He pressed Qing Jifang so hard that the latter was forced to frequently pull back to provide aid, leading to a collapse on the front line and a temporary retreat.

Just as the situation was looking excellent for the Zhao State, cultivators from the Xiangxiong Kingdom suddenly swept down from the west of the river to attack the Chen State. Not only did they tie up the Chen State's ruler, but the Five Bright Ones of Xiangxiong also led an invasion force. This area was not only Wei Xuanyin's homeland but also bordered Long. The Zhao State was thrown into chaos, and Qing Jifang seized the opportunity to push north, fighting all the way into their heartland and shaking the capital itself!

Just a few days ago, an even more dramatic turn of events occurred. After the Five Bright Ones of Xiangxiong—five Purple Mansion cultivators—captured the Golden City, their military advance came to an abrupt halt. It seemed they had reached some sort of agreement with the Zhao court. Reversing their previous stance, they suddenly turned south and began to clash fiercely with Qing Jifang's forces.

‘How interesting…’

Li Que'wan had been holding the fort here, and though she had not revealed herself, she had not missed a single piece of intelligence. Her mood was now quite stable, and there was even a flicker of joy in her eyes.

‘Let them fight, let them fight. The longer it drags on, the better. The more brutal the battle, the better. Let the dogs tear each other to pieces. It would be best if Qing Jifang is so grievously injured that he can no longer venture out. The threat to my lake will be greatly diminished then!’

However, she did not lower her guard, instead observing the situation with increasing frequency.

Li Que'wan naturally trusted Li Jiangqian to act with discretion. Her worry stemmed from the movements in the west—if Western Shu could deploy forces in Yuyang, they could do so in the great desert as well. It wouldn't take many; even if only Li Muyan were to arrive, she would be forced to make a move.

‘It’s not that I fear I can’t beat them, but that exposing my whereabouts would bring more trouble later on.’

After a short wait, a hint of delight appeared in her eyes. The iridescent light in her palm converged, and a speck of gold leaped out from the jade cauldron.

It was a golden-patterned talisman, a finger's breadth wide. It appeared seamless, its material unremarkable, yet it was bound by a divine ability so condensed it was like a solid entity, shimmering with specks of light.

While Li Jiangqian was busy running errands, Li Que'wan had not been idle in the slightest. In recent days, apart from constantly monitoring the west, she had been contemplating the arts of the Shaman-Register to prepare in advance.

The arts of the Shaman-Register were mostly related to blood sacrifice, ghosts, and gods. Li Que'wan's Shamanic Talisman Dao was more particular. Now that she had achieved a divine ability, its nature was gradually revealing itself, broadly divided into three categories.

The first was formlessness, the second was transformation, and the third was life and death.

The first path of formlessness comprised various formless arts, such as divination, predicting fortune and misfortune, and even resolving calamities. At profound levels, it could even consume one's life-mandate. The second path was used far more often; it was the various aspects of the Dao of Transformations, applicable to both enemies and oneself, and the only one that could be used in combat.

The third path was ruthless. It was said to be about ‘the dead live, and the living die’. ‘The dead live’ referred to ways of escaping certain death. If used against an enemy, however, short of paying a tremendous price to curse them to a sudden, violent end, there was no other outcome.

As such, preparing in advance was a rather vexing matter. After careful consideration, she finally decided to try using talismans—an extremely important auxiliary tool in shamanic arts.

It was the very one in her hand.

Brewing within it was an art of transformation. Lacking a suitable Whole Pill spiritual resource to act as a vessel, she had used several Foundation Establishment spiritual items to craft the talisman, succeeding only after several failures. Even so, this art of transformation would dissipate the moment it left the nurturing of her divine ability. Although it was similar to the Purple and Gold Dao, only cultivators of the Whole Pill and Upper Shaman paths could use it, which made her think to herself:

‘Fortunately, we have Cheng Qian. If we can also invite the Great Xiukui Monastery, and Jingzhao, that is Lin Chensheng, I can give these to them before the great battle. They won’t go to waste.’

She waited for several more days and nights. Amidst the wind and rain, she finally sensed a streak of Li Fire cross the Great Void, sailing through the skies before landing softly on a distant mountain. She knew her brother had returned.

She took a single step and came to a stop in the Great Void above Gardenia Scenery Mountain. Raising her brow, she saw that the eldest son of King Wei had a composed expression, his eyes filled with contemplation. Unexpectedly, a young man was following beside him.

This man was strikingly handsome, with a tall, slender figure. He had the appearance of a transcendent Daoist practitioner, his eyes shining brightly. A dot of Cinnabar was marked between his brows, and the divine ability rolling off him was immense—he, too, was a Whole Pill cultivator!

‘It’s that Cheng Qian.’

An idea formed in her mind, but Li Jiangqian simply smiled and said softly,

"Wan'er, this is Daoist friend Cheng Qian."

These words made Cheng Qian start. He knew someone was nearby, but no matter how he tried to sense them, he could not detect the slightest presence. A chill ran down his spine. Just then, a brilliant, mercury-colored light scattered down, and a woman appeared before his eyes.

"This…"

The Daoist Master’s gaze fell upon her and he could not look away. He was so astonished and full of admiration that he was rendered speechless. He waited until Li Que'wan smiled and greeted him before he awoke as if from a dream, saying in a strained voice,

"Your sister cultivates… the Dao of immortals and gods!"

Indeed, as a dignified Purple Mansion cultivator, Cheng Qian would not be swayed by mere appearances. While the Li Que'wan before him was certainly beautiful, he dared not entertain any improper thoughts. What truly shocked him was her divine ability!

The Whole Pill path was already uncommon. Each lineage had its own specialty, but they were all uniquely unsuited for combat. It was one thing when she was hidden, but now that her aura was revealed, how could Cheng Qian, also a Whole Pill cultivator, fail to sense that primordial, natural-seeming air of her divine ability! It nearly made his jaw drop.

‘To think such a brilliant divine ability exists in this world!’

That single glance had left him feeling utterly intoxicated. If not for the inappropriate setting and their respective statuses, Cheng Qian would have loved nothing more than to take her by the hand and discuss the Dao in detail. For now, he could only avert his gaze with a complex expression and say,

"Congratulations, Daoist friend!"

A smile on his face, Li Jiangqian shook his head and said,

"This sister of mine also cultivates the Whole Pill path. She has only just reached the Purple Mansion Realm. In the future, I hope you’ll give her some pointers when you have the chance."

‘Me? Give pointers?’

Cheng Qian let out a helpless laugh.

"Your Highness jests with me… On the Whole Pill path, lineages are of high and low grades. The threshold of a great Dao lineage is the difference between heaven and earth. Daoist Master Qiushui, when she first formed her divine ability, could simulate all manner of weapons with three inches of silver mercury. I have cultivated to this day, and it still takes me thirty days just to balance yin and yang… Pointers? I truly wouldn’t dare."

In truth, balancing yin and yang in thirty days was not considered slow. Without the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, it would have taken Li Que'wan several days herself. She smiled and shook her head. As Cheng Qian followed the two to their seats, a surge of excitement grew in his heart.

‘The Li clan actually possesses a top-tier Whole Pill Dao lineage!’

If it were only him, Cheng Qian, who cultivated the Whole Pill path, the Li family would never have braved the pressure from the Golden Feather Sect to find a lineage for him. But now, with Li Que'wan in the picture, he was merely an additional benefit. It was highly likely that his path on the Dao was now free of worries!

What did this mean? It meant he no longer had to cultivate under the immense pressure of the Golden Feather Sect, constantly seeking a lineage while on the verge of being exterminated. Furthermore… even if he couldn't obtain their true teachings, learning a few of their spell arts—even just thirty or forty percent—would be enough for him to pass through the Purple Mystery stage!

From this moment on, a subtle change occurred in the mentality of this Whole Pill cultivator. His previously detached mindset, born of being forced by circumstances to throw in his lot with the Li clan, had shifted. After all… a path where the future of one's cultivation was visible would always give rise to greater ambitions.

At his side, Li Jiangqian watched him with a constant smile, a hint of shrewdness in his eyes. Seeing the man before him lost in thought, he finally smiled faintly and said softly,

"Then let's not speak of pointers. It's better for the two of you to communicate often than to cultivate alone."

"Indeed… indeed!"

Though Cheng Qian maintained his composure, the joy in his eyes was unmistakable. Li Jiangqian offered a polite word before saying,

"Now that Old Daoist Master Chen has departed, I'll leave the great desert in your hands, Cheng Qian."

"Your Highness, rest assured!"

Cheng Qian nodded lightly, but a shadow of gloom flickered in his eyes, and he couldn't help but add a warning.

"It is said… that Western Shu possesses a treasure capable of divination…"

Having been out and about, Li Jiangqian was clearly aware of this matter. He let out a cold laugh and said nonchalantly,

"I heard. Old Daoist Master Chen was discovered as he was leaving Yuyang. Otherwise, they wouldn't dare try to divine the situation on the lake, no matter how capable they are! Rest assured, Western Shu will either not make a move, or if they do, it will be in a major battle after the northern campaign. There won't be too many schemes."

Cheng Qian bowed, about to take his leave, when the woman before him gently stopped him, her voice soft.

"Please wait a moment, Daoist friend."

She turned her hand over, and a silver light appeared in her palm. As the iridescent colors faded, a thin, finger-sized talisman with golden patterns was revealed. Li Que'wan said with a serious expression,

"I must ask you to nurture this within your divine ability. When the great battle comes, it will surely be of use."

Cheng Qian naturally expressed his thanks, accepted it, and took his leave. Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow and asked,

"What is that?"

Li Que'wan answered briefly, which brought a look of satisfaction to the crimson-robed young man's eyes. He said,

"A good method… I have already been to the Great Xiukui Monastery… I was delayed because I had to wait for the time Lin Chensheng told his disciples he would emerge from seclusion. However… he agreed readily, saying he would bring the Spiritual Treasure of the Great Xiukui Monastery to assist us!"

"Excellent!"

Although Lin Chensheng had only just formed his divine ability, the foundation of the Daoist tradition behind him was simply too profound. With his many Spiritual Artifacts and Spiritual Treasures, holding off a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator would be no problem. Li Que'wan understood and said,

"I will go prepare another one!"

Li Jiangqian nodded as he set down his cup, speaking in a low voice.

"During that time… I wasn't just waiting idly at his monastery. I also made a trip to the Sword Gate to find the Cheng clan… The Sword Immortal is always in seclusion and sees no one, so I only met with Senior Cheng Jiuwen."

"And what was his answer?"

Li Jiangqian’s expression was tinged with doubt as he replied,

"Cheng Jiuwen's meaning was… that he will definitely come, but the Sword Immortal's intentions are unclear. Senior Heaven's Horn has also gone into slumbering cultivation, so the Cheng clan dares not make a promise. However… there is some good news."

He raised his brows.

"All the treasures of the Sword Gate are currently with Senior Jiuwen. If he makes a move, he will surely be far superior to the likes of Shen Sou from the Shu kingdom… With Yehui also coming, the combat strength on the lake can no longer be underestimated. It's a pity we're missing Situ Huo; who knows where that old coot has run off to enjoy himself!"

Li Que'wan pursed her lips and smiled.

"You've worked hard, running around out there…"

Li Jiangqian shook his head with a smile.

"You have no idea. While I was out, I heard several pieces of news from the north, and it has put me in high spirits… Qing Jifang… observing his strategies, he's like a child. If it weren't for the formidable power of Changhuai at his back, he would be of no concern at all!"

The young man's tone was full of contempt as he continued,

"The Zhao court has always been making eyes at Xiangxiong, which means the powers behind them have a basis for cooperation. Back when Zhao and Song fought their great war in Jianghuai, who was it that tied him down in Long? They truly have short memories. The moment the wound heals, the pain is forgotten. Could Xiangxiong possibly be helping him in earnest?"

Li Que'wan nodded.

"So it seems they're luring the enemy in deep?"

Li Jiangqian was noncommittal.

"It's half true, half false. Xiangxiong is taking advantage of the chaos, and Great Zhao has had to make a painful sacrifice. But I've looked at the maps. Several of Xiangxiong's Daoist Masters plunged straight into Qing Jifang's rear. It should have been a situation where his forces collapsed at the first touch. The fact that he's still holding on suggests the fool at least had some precautions in place—it's just that his nature is too greedy, and he was willing to gamble!"

Hearing this, Li Que'wan gave a slight nod.

"From the looks of it, he will be returning empty-handed."

Li Jiangqian’s smile finally faded, and his expression grew serious.

"Correct. At the very least, there is no longer any possibility of advancing north. It all depends on how much territory he can hold onto. This great war will certainly be decided in a few months, or at most, a year and a half!"

This was clearly the reason for his heavy thoughts upon his return. The prince took several steps around the mountain path before speaking in a low voice.

"It's just a pity… Whether he sensed it himself or some Great Daoist Master was on guard and offered a warning, Western Shu managed to block Xiangxiong's southern push this time. The possibility of them suffering a major defeat is now very low… This battle will have to be fought for real."

Li Que'wan sighed. Just as she was about to say more, a calm voice suddenly came from outside the grand formation.

"Yuanbian has come to visit. I ask that the Seventh Young Master open the formation!"

When the words reached them, the two Daoist Masters inside the formation were both stunned. They exchanged a look, each seeing the shock in the other's eyes.

‘That's… Senior Liu!’

It was a known fact that Liu Changdie's friendship with the Li clan spanned generations. Of all the many Purple Mansion cultivators in Jiangnan, he was undoubtedly the closest. Even Li Que'wan had cultivated her secret arts under his protection, otherwise Li Jiangqian would never have entrusted him with the matter of the grand formation. But this senior had explicitly stated that he dared not set foot in Jiangnan again. By all rights, he should never have appeared here!

He stepped out onto the wind and saw, sure enough, a Daoist Master in a white fur robe standing in the Great Void. His bearing was profound and peaceful, his demeanor graceful. It was none other than Liu Changdie!

Astonished, Li Jiangqian led him into the mountains. Once they landed on the summit, Li Que'wan quickly stepped to the side and performed the rites of a junior, saying respectfully,

"Que'wan greets Senior!"

The calm expression on Liu Changdie's face finally broke. A clear look of delight appeared in his eyes. He took a few steps forward and looked at her carefully, his voice filled with surprise and joy.

"Excellent, excellent… I knew you would succeed, but I never thought it would be so soon!"

Liu Changdie did not know most of the Li family's younger generation, but he was closest to Li Que'wan. The young woman had spent her early years cultivating at the Wave-Suppressing Mansion, and her polite and considerate nature had won his affection. The Daoist Master subconsciously reached for his sleeve and smiled.

"What a coincidence!"

With a flip of his hand, a copper box appeared in his palm. The middle-aged man said with a warm smile,

"Since you listened to my teachings and grew up under my care, I consider myself half a master to you. I prepared this congratulatory gift for your attainment of the Dao long ago… I was only worried I would not get to see you!"

Li Que'wan did not dare accept his gift and refused repeatedly. But the elder put on a stern face and pressed it firmly into her hands, saying,

"I could not help you with the spiritual item for forming your divine ability. If you refuse to accept this spiritual resource from me as well, you must look down on this small favor of mine…"

Li Que'wan found herself in a difficult position and could only say,

"Senior, you misspeak. The spiritual item for my attainment of the Dao was precisely what you sought by running all over the place… How could you say you were no help…"

Liu Changdie waved his hands dismissively, saying no more on the matter. He turned to Li Jiangqian, his expression serious.

"I have come to build the formation!"

Li Jiangqian had his suspicions, but he had not expected this to be true. He temporarily suppressed his doubts.

"It's really finished!"

The great war between the Shu kingdom and Great Zhao had only just seen its first battle. This speed was absolutely astonishing, so fast that Li Jiangqian had never dared to hope for it, so fast it was almost suspicious!

He was both overjoyed and shocked. He sighed and said,

"Senior is truly formidable…"

Liu Changdie smiled. He solemnly raised two fingers to the center of his brow and drew out a brilliant golden halo.

The halo gently descended, transforming in his palm into a rose-gold circular disk, no larger than his hand. It was engraved with intricate patterns of gold and white, as fine as ox hair. The colors were magnificent, the lines winding and rotating with a dazzling brilliance. As the Daoist Master's palm shifted, it actually gave birth to streams of Lesser Yang light.

‘How beautiful…’

A formation plate was the crystallized essence of the intersection between the Daos of formations and artifact refinement. Even Li Jiangqian, who had never seen one before, immediately felt that this object was precious. As he took it from Liu Changdie's hands, he felt an urge to never let it go, murmuring,

"What a treasure!"

Liu Changdie nodded seriously and said,

"I cultivate Vault Metal, where treasury gold is stored within. If the dharma body is whole and uninjured, its essence blood is precious and has the effect of completing a profound formation. Among the many items that form a foundation, the formation plate is special. Vault Metal is the metal of reception and storage. A formation plate is a precious item of the Dao of formations, and it is hidden within the formation—this is the very sign of Vault Metal… My Dao lineage uses this to analyze great formations. When I asked you to add a measure of Metal Virtue while refining the plate, it was precisely for this moment."

"This plate has now been nourished by my essence blood, which is of great benefit. Not only is it completed instantly, but when the great formation is activated, the Vault Metal will return to its rightful place, naturally adding a touch of the miraculous."

The divine light in the Daoist Master’s eyes blazed. Clearly, nurturing the formation plate with his blood was not some impatient whim but part of a plan conceived from the very beginning of the formation's design and creation!

With his explanation, the two Daoist Masters understood immediately, their faces filled with amazement. Li Que'wan nodded repeatedly, looking somewhat ashamed. Liu Changdie was not a man of small character; for him to call his own essence blood precious meant it was clearly an extremely important component of Vault Metal cultivation. She hurried to say,

"Senior's Dao-Profundity is immense! But for such a generous gift, my family does not know how we can possibly repay you!"

"What is there to speak of repayment?"

Liu Changdie, however, thought nothing of it, shaking his head.

"It is merely a matter of daring to imagine it. It is a pity that Purple Mansion spiritual items of these two paths are so rare now. I lamented back then that if I could obtain the spiritual items of these two Dao lineages and create a formation based on the concept of Harmonising and Vault Lock, it would surely shake the world!"

Hearing the full story, Li Jiangqian was overjoyed. He thanked him with sincere warmth, led him to a seat on the mountain, and pushed a collection of medicinal pills toward him, saying seriously,

"Please!"

Fearing he would refuse, he added,

"There will be a great battle soon!"

Only then did Liu Changdie accept them. Seeing the siblings so happy, his own spirits lifted, and he said with a smile in his eyes,

"Then I shall do as you say."

Seeing the elder put the items away, Li Jiangqian was unwilling to waste another moment. He said with a serious tone,


"Why don't we… set up this formation right now!"

Liu Changdie stroked his beard and smiled.

"There is no rush for you to go. I have never been to that place and am unfamiliar with its earth veins and spiritual energies. I must first go and align the earth veins, light up those few formation platforms, and link them to the spiritual energy of the veins. Only then can the formation plate be installed."

"Oh?"

Li Jiangqian understood. He asked,

"How long will that take?"

Liu Changdie pinched his fingers to calculate, then said seriously,

"It will depend on the layout of your esteemed clan's grand formation. At most, several months; at least, twenty to thirty days."

"Excellent!"

Thanks to Liu Changdie's marvelous methods, even though Western Shu had retreated, there were still several battles to be fought in their rear. Thirty days was more than enough time. Li Jiangqian watched him depart, then turned back with a smile.

"With Senior Liu here, a great weight has been lifted from my mind!"

Seeing that everything was on the right track, Li Que'wan also had a smile on her face. She lifted her sleeve, took out the copper box, and opened it. Inside lay a pool of spiritual water, in the center of which rested a mercury pearl, no bigger than a fingertip.

Her Dao lineage was profound. With a single glance, she recognized it immediately and said with admiration,

"This is Phase Yin Mercury. Though considered common among spiritual resources, in this day and age, it has become quite rare…"

"Senior is truly sincere towards you. That is a rare and precious thing!"

Li Jiangqian nodded. Even with his cynical nature, he wholeheartedly approved of Liu Changdie's selfless actions, understanding that the man considered them family. His only worry was about the karmic ties being formed, but he put that aside for the moment and changed the subject.

"Fortunately, the Whole Pill path was only thoroughly plundered by the Golden Feather Sect, not completely severed. Looking now, if one searches in all the nooks and crannies, some of the things they looked down upon, and even some precious items, can still be found."

Li Que'wan nodded, turning her hand to put the box away. She replied with great solemnity,

"A storm is coming. I will complete this last talisman. As for the formation in the great desert, I will leave it to you and Senior!"
