# Chapter 1027: Nanwu

His reply was clever, subtly revealing his stance and drawing a laugh from the other three. Sima Yuanli simply pulled Li Ximing aside and sighed.

"Daoist Friend Guo is just spooked... He suffered quite a loss because of a Merging Fire in his youth. The whole affair gave him a massive headache, and now he turns pale at the mere mention of it!"

"Well, Guo Shentong's divine ability is quite famous, after all," Li Ximing replied with a smile.

Sima Yuanli lamented, "It wasn't just him. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's Merging Fire once brought disaster upon his family, taking many of their members. He eventually had to sell it for the spiritual resources he needed to break through. Only then did things slowly begin to improve for them..."

"It's good that he doesn't cultivate a Merging Fire! As long as he avoids it..."

Sima Yuanli tapped his temple playfully.

"There's a story there!"

Li Ximing chuckled, but then he was suddenly reminded that his own most powerful art, the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire, was also a type of Merging Fire. 'If it weren't for the Valley Wind Guide-Fire and the Talisman Seed, I'd be affected too,' he thought, and steered the conversation away from the awkward topic.

Kuang Yu, perhaps not well acquainted with Sima Yuanli, only offered a slight, tight-lipped smile. Li Ximing, however, nodded in deep agreement. "This way, please!" he said.

Playing the part of the host, he led the three up the mountain, stopping at the summit. Sima Yuanli then made the introductions.

"Daoist Friend Guo hails from the Eastern Sea. He is a rogue cultivator, though his ancestors were from a prestigious line—the renowned Yongzhou Guo Clan. They fled to the outer seas during the fall of the Great Liang, and their name faded into obscurity..."

Daoist Master Nanwu nodded slightly and took over, smiling. "Daoist Friend Qinghu, you flatter me. But when it comes to noble lineage, how could I possibly compare to a descendant of an emperor? To do so would only invite Senior Zhaojing's ridicule."

He let out a soft sigh. "Back then, my ancestor was gravely injured and dared not show his face, so he took refuge in the outer seas, where he met a swift end. The Spiritual Qi in the outer seas is thin, and within a century, my family had fallen into extreme decline, relying solely on the island formed from our ancestor's body to continue our cultivation..."

"Before he passed, he entrusted his treasures to a certain Daoist Master, asking him to look after our family. It was to prevent us from being destroyed for the very treasures we possessed. That Daoist Master cared for my family for a hundred years before perishing in a calamity, and we heard no more from him... Our family's fortunes declined even further, to the point where we could no longer even defend our island."

"If not for the old master from Mount Qusi passing through the outer seas a century ago and discovering me by chance... if he hadn't brought me away from the outer seas, and if I hadn't had a bit of luck myself, I would never have found the path I am on today!"

He sounded deeply moved, but Li Ximing understood the underlying message. This introduction first mentioned the Great Liang to establish his origins, then brought up Mount Qusi to hint at his network—the line of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from the Southeastern Sea under Kuang Yu.

It also cleared up one of Li Ximing’s questions. For a family to be harmed by a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's Merging Fire, the "many members" lost must have been in the Foundation Establishment Realm. The ancestor likely used the Merging Fire forcefully to save his clan from disaster. Such arts damaged one's nature and lifespan, so a tragic death would be a natural outcome.

Li Ximing lowered his hands and sighed. "It hasn't been easy..."

Kuang Yu nodded slightly. "The Guo family has endured much hardship these years... Returning from the outer seas, they urgently need vast spiritual resources and a Purple Mansion Realm formation to protect the clan... which aligns with your expectations, Daoist friend!"

"That's why, upon receiving news from Zhaojing, I immediately thought of Daoist Master Guo. I asked him in detail, and unexpectedly, he already knows Qinghu. On the way to Helin to inspect the formation, we came here directly."

Li Ximing nodded in understanding. Sima Yuanli wasted no time and retrieved an object from his sleeve.

It was a profound scroll, adorned with intricate, multicolored patterns and tied with a golden spiritual cord. Placing it before Li Ximing, he sighed.

"These past few days, the formation masters in my clan have been painstakingly piecing together the diagram for this formation. We also gained some clues from a few Changxiao formation cultivators. We've managed to restore about fifty or sixty percent of it."

Sima Yuanli's gesture was considerate, giving face to both sides. Li Ximing nodded with a smile as Sima Yuanli stroked his beard and continued,

"This is the Celestial Harmony Grand Spirit Formation, crafted by Changxiao. When he emerged from the grotto-heaven back then, he was laden with treasures and was never stingy in their use. The formation plate's foundation is made of 'White Ying Remote Gold,' with its patterns inscribed using 'Long He Bright Star.' It was refined from these two Purple Mansion Realm spiritual materials, along with various other resources. This formation plate alone is priceless and virtually unobtainable on the market!"

"Once established, this spiritual formation is somewhat lacking in defense and has few offensive capabilities. However, for assisting cultivation, gathering Spiritual Qi, nurturing life, and establishing a Dao lineage for passing down teachings, it is of the highest caliber—a treasure of the first rank!"

As his voice fell, he revealed an object in his palm and smiled. "This is the formation plate!"

The object was palm-sized, an octagon with eight corners, and gleamed a uniform, pale blue-white. Runes as fine as ox hair were inscribed upon its surface. Though it shone as bright and white as snow, it cast a shimmering golden hue as Sima Yuanli moved his hand.

"My family has a decent heritage, so we managed to retrieve this item safely with minimal damage. At most, some of its Spiritual Qi was depleted. Once a new grand formation is established, it can be nurtured for a year or two to fully recover!"

"The only issue... is that we obtained this by breaking the original formation. I am not well-versed in formations and have merely used a spell art to contain it. I'll need to find someone who understands formations, and I will go with them to install it."

Daoist Master Guo's eyes lit up at these words, and he nodded discreetly. Li Ximing calmly accepted the plate. A distinct coolness spread through his palm as it settled in his hand.

It was truly a treasure of the Purple Mansion Realm. The plate itself was small and exquisite, yet it radiated the multicolored light characteristic of a Purple Mansion-level divine ability. Once he looked at it, he couldn't tear his eyes away. Holding it, he was even more reluctant to let go. Even if he had no use for it himself, he wished he could keep it just to study its craftsmanship.

Beside him, Daoist Master Guo's gaze was even more fixed. Li Ximing smiled at him and asked, "Daoist Friend Guo... your cultivation path is..."

The man quickly looked up and said politely, "Senior, there is no need to be so formal. I am Guo Nanwu; please feel free to call me Nanwu... My Guo family cultivates the paths of Valley Water and Lesser Yang, supplemented by a Dao of Fire Virtue. I myself reached my current realm through the Lesser Yang Dao..."

"Now that is rare!"

Li Ximing realized this was the first time he'd met a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Lesser Yang Dao. But his reaction was swift; his surprise was quickly followed by suspicion.

'Lesser Yang... it's not entirely out of the blue. He said his family was from the Great Liang, which had the infamous Lesser Yang Demon Monarch. Combining that with his ancestor's story of fleeing into exile, it's highly likely his ancestor was a high-ranking minister of the Liang Emperor and a cultivator of the Lesser Yang Dao!'

And what did that imply? The Great Liang's Lesser Yang Dao lineage originated from the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect, colloquially known as the Viewing Pavilion faction! And who was in charge of the Viewing Pavilion faction today? Wei Xuanyin! And who did he work for? Luoxia!

This was the advantage of understanding the web of Daoist traditions. Even if the chance of him being from the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect was slim, Li Ximing immediately began to probe. He nodded. "That's not so unusual... the Lesser Yang Dao. Is it from the Viewing Pavilion's Daoist Tradition?"

As soon as he spoke, Sima Yuanli, who had been about to speak, closed his mouth and sipped his tea in silence. Guo Nanwu, however, just smiled. "We couldn't possibly claim a connection to the Viewing Pavilion's Daoist Tradition. In truth, Valley Water is my family's primary cultivation path. The Lesser Yang Dao was something an ancestor traded for... It's just that, unexpectedly, our efforts with Valley Water have repeatedly failed, while the Lesser Yang path has borne fruit."

His expression grew more wistful as he continued.

"I know you're referring to the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect... Back in the day, those cultivators were lofty and unreachable. But now... their orthodox lineage has been completely severed. They're nothing more than a group of lackeys running errands for the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao."

Li Ximing was slightly surprised, but Sima Yuanli coughed, signaling that the topic should be dropped. Li Ximing could only set down his cup and nod silently.

'That makes sense... For one, if his family had been from the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect, they wouldn't have been hunted down to their current state. And secondly... even if Wei Xuanyin wanted to stir up trouble, this isn't his style... He wouldn't need to involve himself in such a suspicious affair. He'd find a descendant of the Bright Yang lineage, or at the very least, someone with a cleaner background...'

Guo Nanwu seemed a bit awkward and quickly added, "Nanwu understands that this item is precious. I have brought a spiritual object in trade."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing looked up with interest. Guo Nanwu took a box from his robes, opened it, and revealed a flash of pure, bright color within.

He spoke softly, "Senior, please take a look!"

Li Ximing's spiritual sense swept over it. He perceived a brilliant golden qi surging and roiling within the box, suppressed by the divine ability sealing its surface. The concentrated color at the very bottom shone with a pure, clear light, marking it unmistakably as a spiritual object of Metal Virtue.

This made Li Ximing narrow his eyes. "Dui Metal?" he asked.

"Indeed!" Guo Nanwu's expression was solemn. "This item has no name, but it is a type of Metal Malice, a Dui Metal spiritual object. I had the old Daoist Master examine it, and he said it is more exalted than ordinary Purple Mansion spiritual materials!"

"Exalted?"

The choice of words struck Li Ximing as odd. He fell into contemplative silence. Sima Yuanli, however, frowned with a mix of belief and doubt.

"It looks like 'Long Yue Variable Gold'... yet it has an added hint of radiance..."

"Daoist Friend Qinghu has sharp eyes!" Guo Nanwu shook his head and sighed.

"Years ago, while my family was cultivating in the outer seas, the Great Void trembled. A golden star fell from the sky, its long rainbow tail sweeping past the moon as it neared the horizon. The phenomenon threw the landscape into chaos, cloaking everything in a dense mist. Although my ancestor was heavily injured, he had no choice but to reveal himself."

"He saw several points of golden light plunge into the sea. Being so close, he took advantage of the opportunity and secretly retrieved them. After repeated study, he also concluded that it was 'Long Yue Variable Gold'."

"Later, when the old Daoist Master Diyan came to our aid, I wished to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. I offered this spiritual object as thanks, hoping to trade it and a 'Miuwei Merging Fire' for a 'Three Sects Glory Yang Stone'. The old master accepted the Merging Fire, but he returned the 'Long Yue Variable Gold'."

Guo Nanwu's gaze was complex.

"The old master said it was 'A gift from the White Lightning, the metal of a bygone year,' and firmly refused to take it. He also instructed us not to let it come into contact with any other Dui Metal, lest it undergo a transformation... and so we have kept it safe to this day."

"After I achieved my divine ability, I visited the old master at his sect to ask about this matter, but he remained tight-lipped. When I asked about its special properties, he would only say that it possessed a trace of the Supreme Yang's might... I was always curious, but now, after searching through all my clan's possessions, this is the only thing worthy of offering!"

Li Ximing carefully appraised it, his own divine ability resonating with the object.

"It does indeed possess the might of the First Manifestation," he confirmed.

This gave Li Ximing something to consider. His own Emperor Qi's Light, which he was refining in a chamber within Juque Palace, required spiritual objects of Supreme Yang, Lightning, and Light Malice as its primary components. This item contained the power of Supreme Yang and was also a Metal Malice. If he obtained it and couldn't sell it right away, he could use it to cultivate the spell art. It should be of great use.

He wasn't thinking of using it for himself, but rather to enhance Li Zhouwei's spell arts. Otherwise, he would have been quite unwilling to trade for a Dui Metal item!

Guo Nanwu nodded repeatedly. Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"This item is indeed precious. However, the Celestial Harmony Grand Spirit Formation plate uses 'White Ying Remote Gold' as its base and 'Long He Bright Star' for its patterns. Both are supreme Purple Mansion spiritual materials. This single piece of Dui Metal, I'm afraid, is not enough."

Guo Nanwu hesitated, opening his mouth as if to offer a cultivation technique. But it was an ancestral matter, and he hadn't discussed it with the clan on his island; he couldn't just offer it up. Kuang Yu, however, raised an eyebrow and smiled.

"That's not all. To construct the formation, you'll need a vast amount of spiritual resources, which you will inevitably have to source from the mainland. And techniques of the Upper Rite are exceptionally rare. Now that Daoist Friend Minghuang has conquered Changxiao, these things will not be easy to come by!"

Guo Nanwu clearly trusted her judgement. He considered her words and nodded. Kuang Yu spoke softly.

"How about this... I've calculated the time. The Guo family is small. Even working at full capacity, building this formation will take ten to twenty years. It's a long-term project..."

She turned to Li Ximing, her tone amicable.

"Why don't we let him take the Celestial Harmony Grand Spirit Formation first, so the Guo family can establish themselves on their island in the Southern Sea? Meanwhile, Daoist Friend Zhaojing here needs someone to help with matters in the outer seas. For a period of twenty to thirty years, the Li family can supply some basic spiritual materials, and in return, Nanwu can act on Moongaze's behalf in the Southern Sea. He can lend a hand with tasks that are within his means and unrelated to the conflict between the north and south. It would be a form of mutual support..."

Kuang Yu smiled. "And there's no need to worry. Once the grand formation is complete, if it turns out there was truly no trouble for Nanwu these thirty years, he can add one or two more spiritual resources for you, depending on the situation."

Her expression turned serious. "With myself and Mount Qusi mediating this, you have a guarantee! If things truly don't work out... he can only offer some cultivation techniques to compensate you..."

This proposal was completely unexpected, causing Li Ximing to turn his head in surprise as he considered it.

'She has a point...'

The matter with Qingyan was still unresolved, and Li Ximing still had contacts with several Demon Kings from Poluoduo. He could trade for pills and spiritual resources, but it was inconvenient to have junior cultivators transport such things back and forth. Unable to leave himself, he could only sit idly on his mountain...

Even his trade with the Southern Songzhou Luoshe and his meeting with the person on Yinzhou Island were things he should have handled personally. But with numerous threats looming and Moongaze Lake needing protection, he couldn't leave in a timely manner. He finally had Liu Changdie, but he had to be stationed at the Qunyi Archipelago! These tasks had piled up for so long that Li Zhouwei had been forced to act as an errand boy on his last trip out.

'If I had someone like him... on the surface, he'd only need to maintain a friendly relationship with my family, visiting occasionally or sending a letter. The most valuable and confidential items would be out of the question, but for handling these pills, spiritual resources, and other ordinary goods... he would be very useful...'

As for the one or two extra spiritual resources, Li Ximing didn't covet them at all. He understood that Kuang Yu genuinely hoped the cultivators of Yue State would grow closer to her faction. But what truly made his heart race was something else entirely!

Both Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan were already showing promise of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm. When they did, another critical matter would arise—the Azure Talisman!

'When the time comes, if we can find a Demon beast in the outer seas with no significant background, we could pool our strength... it might be possible... and even if a Demon beast with no backing is hard to find, having another Purple Mansion Realm-level combatant is always a good thing!'

'The only pity is... the Southern Sea doesn't offer many benefits for my family... and it wouldn't be right to drag him into the conflict between north and south.'

He pondered for a long while, with no intention of asking for their family's cultivation techniques. He smiled.

"We can certainly establish a friendly relationship. Since we've agreed on thirty years, we will be friends from now on. There's no need to be so rigid about the terms, and I would feel embarrassed to accept more spiritual resources from you!"

"This..." Guo Nanwu was taken aback and felt a bit uneasy. He quickly bowed in return.

"Senior Zhaojing..."

Li Ximing shook his head, rising with a smile.

"There's no need for such formalities!"

He picked up the formation plate and placed it in Guo Nanwu's hands.

"Since it's decided, let's not keep Daoist Friend Qinghu waiting any longer. Please, make the trip at once!"

The formation plate felt cool to the touch, but Guo Nanwu held it as if it were a scorching treasure. He let out a long, deep sigh of relief. "Junior will remember this kindness!"

He raised his eyes to look at Kuang Yu but was slightly surprised to see she had moved to stand by Li Ximing's side. The woman smiled radiantly.

"Congratulations! Daoist Friend Zhaojing and I still have some minor matters to discuss... so I won't accompany you back. Fairy Ning is at Xinyu. You can go look for her directly!"
