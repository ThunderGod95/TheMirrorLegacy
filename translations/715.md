# Chapter 715: The Matter of the Capital immortals Dao

"My deepest thanks, Daoist Master!"

Ding Weizeng's voice was heavy with respect. He was a hearty man with a square jaw and a bristling beard, and his simple, earnest bow was more convincing than a thousand fawning compliments. The old Daoist Master nodded, pleased.

After Ding Weizeng paid his respects, Sumian remained smiling but silent. The conversation that followed was not for his retainer's ears, so Li Ximing gestured, sending him out of the courtyard.

"I must thank Daoist Master Qi," Li Ximing said sincerely. "I only recently broke through, and my clan's precepts forbid me from engaging with matters of blood qi. I'm not skilled in this area, unlike you, whose divine abilities make such healing seem effortless."

"Zhaojing, you jest," Sumian replied, shaking his head as he poured the tea. "If you truly wished to heal his injury, it would hardly be a challenge. I merely had the advantage of a convenient divine ability."

He filled their cups just as a cool, quiet rain began to fall outside. Changxi watched Li Ximing with a complex expression, a finger resting on his teacup as if to steady himself. "Seeing you in your prime, Zhaojing, is like looking at myself three hundred years ago. It brings back a flood of memories."

Changxi was not yet five hundred, only around four hundred and fifty. Li Ximing had long been puzzled by the lifespan of Purple Mansion cultivators. He paused for a moment before asking, "Even after attaining a divine ability, if one cannot achieve transcendence, is it not possible to at least enjoy a millennium of life? Five hundred years is hardly enough time for cultivation."

Sumian smiled wistfully. "That's a fine question, one I asked myself in my youth. My lineage's records touch upon it briefly. Allow me to share what I know."

"Lifespan consists of two parts: the life of the body and the life of the spirit. The former is tied to your physical nature, the latter to your destiny. We of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivate our physical nature. Our souls are bound to our bodies, so while the body itself may endure, our destiny is finite. When it runs its course, the soul weakens, and we die."

A flicker of understanding crossed Li Ximing's face. Changxi added with a wry smile, "Look at the Buddhist cultivators of the north. They cultivate destiny. Their physical lifespans are short, but when one body perishes, they simply find another. Their Merciful Ones, for instance, changes bodies every century or so. Though they must reforge their Dharma body each time, living for over a thousand years until their destiny is exhausted is no problem at all."

"Precisely," Sumian agreed. "Therefore, it shouldn't be called a five-hundred-year lifespan, but a five-hundred-year destiny. Before the heavens changed, this was all recorded in the registers of the Underworld—so-and-so cultivator, fated to live for so many years... I've even heard tales of cultivators bribing officials in the Underworld to extend their time."

Changxi sighed. "After the heavens changed, the Underworld became inaccessible. Everyone's destiny became fixed. Purple Mansion cultivators have five hundred years. Those who cultivate a Life Divine Ability can live a little longer and have a chance through possession, but with my divine ability... I can only wait for the end."

Li Ximing mulled this over for a moment. "What of the ancient arts of cultivating Qi and nurturing one's nature?"

"The way of the ancient immortals is superior, of course! To master a divine ability and perfect both body and destiny—that is the path to true longevity!" Sumian laughed. "But how many can actually succeed? Look at the Wang and Xie families, hiding in their vast Grotto-Heavens with millions of mortals. Do they even have ten cultivators among them? And of those who cultivate, does even one in a thousand attain a divine ability? Even if you could find such an immortal scripture, your entire Moongaze Lake might only produce one or two children capable of using their powers for something as simple as calling rain."

Li Ximing nodded in acceptance, took a sip of tea, and changed the subject. "Is the old Daoist Master secure in these lands?"

Sumian knew he was asking about the White Ye Immortal Sect. "Rest assured, Zhaojing, I have always lived peacefully here by the sea. Shen Yuming of the Shen family, Master Minghui of the Lotus Temple in Lu, and even Yehui of the Capital immortals Dao and Chang Yun of the Chengyun Gate have all paid their respects."

His meaning was clear. The Xuanmiao Temple had no grand ambitions. Sumian wished to live out his final years in peace, maintaining good relations with his neighbors. He had no desire to get involved in the tense standoff between Changxi, the Li clan, and the White Ye Immortal Sect.

He glanced at his two guests before adding, "But now that I have promised Changxi I would look after the Profound Peak Gate, I will naturally keep my word."

Li Ximing was not surprised. He chose his words carefully. "When I broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, this Daoist Master Yehui sent no congratulations. That I can overlook. But he then went out of his way to mock me without cause. I am at a loss as to how I offended him."

"I am aware that the White Ye Immortal Sect is blocked to the north by the Chengyun Gate—and Chang Yun is a formidable figure. To the east, they have Xuanmiao Temple; to the south, your Profound Peak Gate; and to the west, the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion. They are natural rivals to my clan... but there was no need for him to bare his fangs so soon."

Yehui was not the only one who knew that the Azure Pond Sect, the Li clan's backer, would not welcome their prosperity; Sumian and Changxi knew it as well. It was this knowledge that fueled Yehui's greed. The two old men exchanged a look, and Sumian sighed.

"There is something you don't know, Zhaojing. Yehui obtained his great opportunity in the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven, and he owed his entry to the support of Guo Shentong... In the early days of the conflict between the east and west isles of Crimson Reef Island, many held back from attacking the west isle out of respect for his connection to Guo."

The final piece of the puzzle clicked into place for Li Ximing. 'So that's it,' he thought with a deep sigh. 'In the end, it all comes back to our feud with Crimson Reef Island. No wonder he was so hostile. The vendetta between our clans and the direct lineage of Crimson Reef is not easily resolved.'

As he processed this, Changxi's voice grew low and cold. "I heard that opportunity was meant for Lingshu! That man is a snake! Zhang Lingshu is dead, and I'd wager Yehui had more than a little to do with it!"

The name Zhang Lingshu sounded familiar. After a moment's thought, Li Ximing remembered that Li Xizhi had inherited the title of Changtian Peak Lord after the line was broken with Zhang Lingshu's death. She had originally been a Peak Lord of the Azure Pond Sect.

Sumian shook his head, looking slightly uncomfortable. "It's a complicated matter. In the end, Haiying and Lingshu never married. You have no grounds to accuse him."

"Hah!" Changxi let out a heavy sigh.

Li Ximing, however, felt a jolt. *Haiying* could only be Kong Haiying, the Purple Mansion seed of the Kong family, currently in seclusion for his breakthrough. From their words, it seemed Kong Haiying and Zhang Lingshu had nearly become Dao companions.

'This is a blood feud,' he realized. 'If I were Yehui, the moment Changxi dies, I would invade the wilderness... I'd strike at Profound Peak Gate until it trembled, then press the attack, disrupting Kong Haiying's breakthrough and ensuring his failure.'

It was a grudge tantamount to murdering one's beloved. Yehui understood the gravity of the situation, which only deepened Changxi's worries.

'So there was more to the story.' A flash of annoyance at Changxi's secrecy crossed Li Ximing's mind, but this was not the time or place to show it. Besides, the source of his own clan's conflict with Yehui was now crystal clear and seemingly irreconcilable. He lowered his head and sipped his tea.

Changxi, who had been watching him closely, felt the awkwardness and quickly moved the conversation along. Sumian, with the wisdom of his centuries, smoothly filled the silence. "Zhaojing, are you aware... Yehui cultivates the 'Capital Guard' of the Ancient Merging lineage. It is an ancient Dao of exorcising ghosts, guarding mountains, and empowering rivers. Its history is long, and he has mastered three divine abilities. He is not to be underestimated."

Li Ximing had only just learned of the Capital Guard Dao. If not for Xiao Ruyu mentioning that Xiao Yongling's 'Eastern Feather Mountain' was of this path, the Li clan would have remained ignorant. He decided to ease the tension. "This junior is inexperienced and has never encountered the Capital Guard Dao before. I would be grateful for the senior's guidance."

"It's actually quite common in Jiangnan," Sumian said with a smile. "The Capital Guard Dao has lacked a Fruition Attainment cultivator for many years, so it has waned. Below the Purple Mansion Realm, it's unremarkable, mostly consisting of Immortal Foundations based on the spirits of mountains and rivers. There are many such cultivators here, but they are difficult to identify. Most mistake them for substitutes of the Earth or Water Virtues, or of the Upper Shaman and Hengzhu Rites, never recognizing their true nature."

"The famous 'Eastern Feather Mountain' of the Xiao clan, the 'Soul-Summoning Lore' favored by the Yue cultivators, and the 'Sorrowful Southern Water' of the Lingu family are all of this path. More famous examples... are not in Jiangnan, such as the 'Western Heaven Plateau' of the Baiqiang and the 'Northern Desert Court' of the Di tribe."

This made sense. The Li clan had once assumed Eastern Feather Mountain was an Earth Virtue foundation and had only recently learned the truth. Changxi, clearly familiar with the topic, added, "Many fallen Dao lineages survive as substitute foundations. If not for the famous Duanmu Kui appearing in Jiangnan, most cultivators would still think the 'Locust Shade Ghost' was just a Wood Virtue substitute, believing its connection to Lesser Yin made it an inferior path."

"Exactly!" Sumian laughed heartily. "As long as the cultivation art is powerful, how can the Immortal Foundation be weak?"

All three men laughed. They all knew how rare and precious powerful arts and techniques were. Unless a clan faced utter annihilation, no one would let their jade slips fall into outside hands; they would destroy them first. If not for the Immortal Mirror's transmissions, the Li clan would still be practicing the *Great River and Grand Mound Scripture*.

"No wonder they're called the Capital immortals Dao. The 'Capital' is from the Capital Guard. What mysteries do its divine abilities hold?"

Sumian lowered his head to his tea, but Changxi answered, "At the Foundation Establishment Realm, it is merely the manipulation of the baleful qi of mountains and rivers. But at the Purple Mansion Realm, one can command spirits and drive out evil, using wondrous spiritual arts to face enemies. And yet, among the Ancient Merging arts, the Capital Guard is not considered particularly demonic. Thunder and heavenly light are not its natural counters."

Li Ximing committed this to memory while trying to pry more information about Yehui's specific divine abilities. He had asked Changxi before, but he didn't know. After a few subtle attempts, it became clear Sumian was unwilling to speak on the matter.

'Either he truly doesn't know, or he's afraid of getting involved in our conflict. A cautious old master indeed.'

The three chatted for a while longer. The cold rain in the courtyard grew heavier, drumming a steady rhythm on the eaves. The fragrance of tea filled the air. A figure appeared outside and spoke respectfully through the door.

"Reporting to the Daoist Masters! The Radiant Splendor Daoist has broken through the river peaks of the Dense Cloud Sect and has slain Pingyang Zi of Pingshui Hill. He is now advancing deep into their territory. The Secret Diffusion region is in an uproar, and cultivators have already been dispatched from Baiye Creek!"

"Good." Changxi pinched his fingers, calculating the time and distance of Li Zhouwei's advance. He smiled. "Worthy of being called the White Qilin of the Li clan! Now, Yehui will be forced to act."

Li Ximing stroked his beard and smiled, though a deeper thought surfaced in his mind.

'Here we sit, discussing idle matters over tea in the cold rain. Yet in the shadows of our robes, generals march and soldiers move, breaking formations and slaying enemies. Thousands of lives are maneuvered like pieces on a board. A Foundation Establishment cultivator, a master of his own domain, is reduced to a bargaining chip. The hegemon of a river, on whom countless cultivators depend, is nothing more than a watchtower...'

'This is the Purple Mansion Realm... this is true power.'

Li Ximing had not forgotten the generations of his ancestors who had been swept along like driftwood in the currents of Purple Mansion cultivators, used as pawns and sacrificed. From the moment Li Tongya first looked up from Mount Huaqian to Li Qinghong flying alone into the Eastern Sea, the clan had sacrificed everything to push him to where he sat today.

'I will trade the freedom of my divine abilities for the peace and prosperity of ten thousand households.'

Li Ximing finished his tea and rose with Changxi to take their leave. Sumian knew they were heading for the Baijiang Creek region and did not detain them, simply having Qiuxin escort them out. The young man seemed to be related to the Kong family by marriage and was quite close with Changxi.

As they stepped out of the courtyard, Qiuxin bowed to Li Ximing. "There is something I must return to the Daoist Master," he said respectfully.

He drew an object from his sleeve and presented it with both hands. It was a small purple cauldron with two handles and three legs, covered in intricate patterns that seemed to shimmer with faint flames.

Four small, elegantly inscribed characters were on the lid: "Shengle, Tuoba."

Not waiting for Li Ximing to ask, he explained, "Years ago, when our temple was still in the Eastern Sea, I accepted an invitation from Xi Chang of the Chunyi Dao Gate to exorcise demons at an estuary near Lake Xian. There, we encountered a cultivator from your esteemed clan who practiced thunder arts. We did not make things difficult for her and allowed her to leave, but she left an old man behind."

"He was killed by the Chunyi Dao Gate, but I kept this item. I return it to you now to settle the matter."

Li Ximing actually remembered the incident. The old man was Yu Yuwei of the Yu family, whom Li Xizhi had mentioned was the maternal uncle of Li Quantao from the Azure Pond Sect. Qiuxin—or rather, Sumian—was unsure of the connection and decided to return the item to be safe.

Li Ximing accepted it casually. "This belongs to a cultivator of the Yu family. If I have the chance, I will see that it reaches his relatives."

Changxi watched with a pleased expression. His sharp eyes noticed something else. "How did you get injured?" he asked Qiuxin.

"Replying to the Daoist Master," Qiuxin said respectfully, "the spirit mine at the Quanyuan ferry was overrun by a school of Xu Water Demon Perch from the sea. I was injured while rescuing people."

"Ah," Changxi said. "Those demon perch have some backing. Their constant harassment must be trying for you."

Li Ximing understood the implication immediately but kept his expression neutral. He scoffed internally. 'A subtle hint, is it? But my clan has no connection to dragon-kind! What Xu Water Demon Perch? What am I supposed to do about it?'

***

Meanwhile, in the territory of Dense Cloud Cave.

Dense Cloud Cave lay slightly northeast of Floating Cloud Cave, further downstream. The terrain was more varied, not just rolling hills but also gentle plains and several towering peaks. It was a fine piece of land.

Beyond the border at Pingshui Hill, several bustling cities came into view. Li Zhouwei flew high above, his cloak whipping in the wind. His armor gleamed, his great halberd held at the ready, and in his other hand, he carried a gruesome, severed head.

Pingyang Zi had been a demonic cultivator from the Eastern Sea, a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator of decent strength, certainly stronger than Wen Yi. But the formation on his mountain was only at the Qi Refining level. Surrounded by Li Chenghui and Li Minggong, there was no escape. Li Zhouwei had ended his life with a single strike of his halberd.

Now, having crossed Pingshui Hill, they were deep in enemy territory. The cities below were in chaos. Li Chenghui looked down with a trace of regret. "These cities are well-managed. It's a shame we don't have the strength to secure them. We must focus on the main peak."

Li Zhouwei nodded and made a quick estimation. "Dense Cloud Cave abducted the population of Floating Cloud Cave. Including their original people, there should be over a million mortals here. That's a significant prize."

Population was still a vital resource for the Li clan. They had no shortage of cultivators at the Embryonic Breathing and miscellaneous Qi stages, but they were desperately lacking at the Foundation Establishment level. They couldn't even manage their own affairs, which was why they had taken the risk of employing men like Qu Bushi.

Large families that had produced Foundation Establishment cultivators were valuable not only for their potential to provide guest retainers but also for their ability to supply a steady stream of mid and late-stage Qi Refining cultivators with pure Qi. These were the true backbone needed to govern a region, unlike the Li clan's current situation, where they had fewer than ten late-stage Qi Refining cultivators, most of whom were either elderly or from the direct family line.
