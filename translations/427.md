# Chapter 571: The Full Story

Li Qinghong composed herself and carefully recounted the events of recent years. When she finished, Li Xuanfeng, who had been listening quietly by her side, said softly, "I have not been at home to lend a hand with all these matters. It must have been hard on all of you."

With that, he gently ran his hand over the black-gold tiger belt at his waist, producing a glimmering jade slip in his palm. "This contains the talismans I acquired in the Southern Border. Take it back and let your eldest uncle examine it. Yue State is well-suited to cultivating talismans; our family could make great strides in this field."

Li Qinghong accepted the slip and, after listening to Li Xuanfeng, asked with curiosity, "Yue State is suitable for cultivating talismans...? This is the first I have heard of it."

Li Xuanfeng paused briefly before replying softly, "It is not something widely known. Fortunately, we are within a secluded cave dwelling, so I can share it. It seems that the True Monarch of Azure Pond Sect has Pristine Water Fruition Attainment connected with talisman cultivation. His Dao field is located in Yue State, making the region a fertile ground for talismans."

Now that he mentioned it, Li Qinghong realized that nearly everyone in Yue State knew at least a few talisman techniques. Talismans were indeed abundant, and although true mastery was rare, there were far more talisman cultivators than those skilled in alchemy or smithing. Even rogue cultivators would have a few reliable talismans in their possession.

Nodding thoughtfully, Li Qinghong remembered the True Monarch she had glimpsed by the shore earlier, hesitating to speak. She thought to herself, It is said that the head of the Yue Cultivating Sect has unmatched divine abilities, greater than any of the three sects. I'd better keep quiet to avoid unnecessary trouble.

Glancing down at the jade slip Li Xuanfeng had given her, she noticed faint, handwritten notes on its surface. The title read Annotations on the Upper Enclosures, written by Chen Gao of Mount Douxuan, detailing various techniques of talisman arts.

Mount Douxuan—it must be an ancient sect, Li Qinghong mused as she skimmed through it. She found several methods for crafting talisman swords appended at the end, finally understanding Li Xuanfeng's intent. She nodded, saying, "This will work well. Many in our family are sword cultivators, so we could forge some talisman swords for our younger generations. They could be passed down to bolster our clan's future."

Li Xuanfeng nodded in agreement, then produced two jade bottles, one large and one small. The larger bottle was a blue-green hue, with what seemed to be a liquid flowing inside, while the smaller was the usual size for holding pills. He explained, "This is Yuwa Stone Liquid and Enduring Tranquility Spirit Pills, both to aid Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation. There are five portions of Yuwa Stone Liquid and ten Enduring Tranquility Spirit Pills. Using these will greatly enhance one's progress in cultivation."

Most of these items he had acquired in the Southern Border, though some he had saved over the years. Placing them on the table, he added in a low voice, "If there is anything else the family needs, let me know. I can spend some time at the marketplace to complete any purchases."

Li Qinghong picked up the two jade bottles from the table. The Yuwa Stone Liquid inside the first was a translucent, pale green, and the Enduring Tranquility Spirit Pills in the second were a dusky color, ten in total.

She tilted the bottle slightly, letting one pill fall into her palm. She examined it closely, tracing the lines on its surface and confirming its properties with her spiritual sense before saying, "Second Uncle... this is a blood-qi pill."

"What?" Li Xuanfeng paused.

Li Qinghong chose her words carefully, speaking in a low tone, "Uncle... this pill was refined from blood qi. This practice has become widespread, both at home and abroad, though it remains a closely guarded secret. Azure Pond Sect has been gathering blood qi over the years largely for this purpose..."

She then gave him a full explanation of the situation. Li Xuanfeng listened in silence, taking a long moment before he exhaled, saying, "I have come to know a great deal while in the Southern Border, but I was entirely unaware of this. It seems Azure Pond Sect has maintained very tight control over information within the city..."

His gaze drifted over the two jade bottles before waving dismissively. "The Yuwa Stone Liquid can be used, but have Ning Heyuan exchange the Enduring Tranquility Spirit Pill for something else."

Li Qinghong nodded and finally inquired about the Ning Family. As the matter was somewhat sensitive, she lowered her eyes, asking softly, "Can the Ning Family be trusted?"

Li Xuanfeng hesitated, then answered, "Not entirely, but they are a reliable ally. Contrary to rumors, the Ning and Chi families are not that close-knit. The Ning Family holds considerable influence within Azure Pond Sect, so if our family wants to annex Moongaze Lake, we will need their support, along with that of Daoist Master Yuan Su."

Li Xuanfeng continued, "I asked around within the sect about Yuanwu Peak's affairs. It is clear that Daoist Master Yuanwu holds Yu Muxian in high regard—even offering his daughter's hand to him. If we fail to contain the situation... we may face Yuanwu's wrath."

Li Qinghong understood that he was referring to the matter with Yu Muxian and sighed, "None of us could easily handle him, let alone Daoist Master Yuanwu's possible retaliation. My brother sees this as a serious matter. He hopes to draw Yu Muxian out and resolve it directly before he reaches the Purple Mansion Realm..."

"That will be difficult to achieve," Li Xuanfeng replied, shaking his head. "I have inquired with Hemian, and apparently, this man is wholeheartedly dedicated to the immortal cultivation. He is practically devoid of desires or attachments, seeing everything except the path to ascension as a burden. Bound by no worldly restrictions... and his cultivation method is aimed directly at reaching the Purple Mansion Realm. He will not leave the sect without cause."

"His Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation technique is an ancient one, causing unbearable pain during cultivation, with golden blades seemingly circulating through his meridians at every moment. Over the past hundred years, he is the only one known to have successfully practiced it... Rumor has it that he is calm to the point of cruelty, with a technique for refining dharma artifacts using soul blood, and he has amassed considerable personal wealth," Li Xuanfeng explained.

Li Qinghong listened intently as Li Xuanfeng recounted several stories and rumors circulating in the sect about Yu Muxian. Gradually, she formed an image of him in her mind, her expression growing worried, An emotionless, ruthless seeker of the Dao... that will be troublesome to handle.

Seeing her concern, Li Xuanfeng said in a serious tone, "You do not need to worry. I will send someone to gather more information. Stay here for a few months, and you can also take me to Yuanjiao when the time comes."

"Alright," Li Qinghong agreed naturally. She had several tasks on this trip: one was to collect thunder energy according to a schedule, and another was to explore the grotto heaven near the Qunyi Strait. She then voiced a concern: "I just hope we do not alert him prematurely."

"It is of no consequence," Li Xuanfeng replied. "The Yu Family has grievances with ours, so asking around for such information would not raise suspicion."

Hearing this, Li Qinghong added, "Please also ask Ning Heyuan. The family has discovered one or two valuable items, so it is best for an elder to inquire about them."

Their family had found an underground river within the Great Jueting, along with a reddish mineral the size of a table, covered in white veining and accompanied by a piece of golden ore.

Not knowing the value of these items, Li Qinghong worried about asking too openly, thinking it would be safer for Li Xuanfeng to handle it. After all, with a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator behind them, any gain could be managed without fear.

After hearing her description, Li Xuanfeng nodded. With a flash of spiritual sense, he summoned someone nearby. It was none other than Ning Dingbo, the eldest brother of the Ning Family. Li Xuanfeng gestured to him and said, "Fetch Ning Heyuan."

The hall where Ning Heyuan resided was nearby, so he soon arrived, greeting both of them with a smile. Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly and asked, "Any recent movements from Yuanwu Peak?"

Ning Heyuan was momentarily surprised, then nodded in realization and replied, "Brother-in-law, Yuanwu Peak cultivates with metal and iron properties, so with the Green Pine Temple matter... I hear Daoist Master Yuanwu is very interested."

So it all comes back to Green Pine Temple! Li Qinghong's suspicions were confirmed.

Li Xuanfeng took a moment to recall and then spoke gravely, "As I remember... Green Pine Temple was known for its arts of Swamp Metal and Fire Virtue... Most of what is left there should be cultivation techniques, correct?"

"Exactly," Ning Heyuan replied softly. "The temple holds various ancient arts, though those relating to Swamp Metal and Fire Virtue are more recent and abundant. Most of them are practicable, making them especially coveted. And these ruins are about to be opened to a select few, with all the sects making preparations."

Li Xuanfeng had heard vague mentions of this before, though he hadn't delved into it and knew little of the specifics. In a low voice, he said, "Explain the background of this matter in detail."

"Certainly," Ning Heyuan nodded and began to recount, "The story begins with Chu Yi of the Li Fire Spear."

Then he began to narrate the story, "The True Monarch of the Luoxia grotto heaven possessed vast divine abilities and profound insight into the mysteries of heaven and earth. With his Fruition Attainment, he incarnated as a mortal and journeyed northward. Although we lesser cultivators do not fully understand his purpose, we witnessed strange phenomena arising from the void, triggering the fates of countless individuals."

He spoke in a somewhat mysterious manner but, feeling he hadn't conveyed it clearly, continued more directly, "In essence, the True Monarch's reincarnated form descended into the world, and various figures aligned with his fate emerged in succession. These individuals, possessing threads of fate, rose from all corners, chosen by heaven as its favored ones."

So that's how Xu Xiao came to be... Li Qinghong had a sudden realization. Figures like Xu Xiao and Tu Longjian were originally supporting characters in the True Monarch's grand narrative. With this new understanding, she listened as Ning Heyuan continued, "But the True Monarch's reincarnated form returned to Mount Luoxia rather abruptly, leaving this group of Fated Ones still wandering across the north and south, stirring up countless disturbances."

Li Xuanfeng frowned slightly and asked, "Could the Daoist Masters identify them?"

Knowing the nature of the three sects and seven gates, Li Xuanfeng understood they would see such individuals as invaluable resources, or at the very least, useful tools. He doubted they would let them slip by.

Ning Heyuan offered a wry smile and replied quietly, "Even the Daoist Masters could not recognize them outright. All they know is that a group of such individuals exists, scattered among the common folk."

"Although the Daoist Masters could not identify them directly, those who stood out from the crowd were almost certainly people bearing a thread of fate. The sect has focused on a few of these individuals, recording them all in the sect's registry," Ning Heyuan explained.

He paused briefly and added with a slight smile, "That Xu Xiao from your clan likely belongs to this group; he happened to form a connection with Crimson Reef Island..."

Seeing that Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong weren't particularly interested in discussing Xu Xiao, Ning Heyuan tactfully skimmed over the topic, continuing in a quiet tone, "Green Pine Temple is located on the island, and entry to it depends entirely on fate. How could the Daoist Masters tolerate such uncertainty?"

"So, Daoist Master Tianyuan of the Golden Feather Sect proposed gathering this group of fated individuals and sending them all to Green Pine Island. With their intertwined fates, after a few days or weeks, one of them is bound to unlock the grotto heaven." Ning Heyuan continued, "The Green Pine Temple's grotto heaven cannot accommodate Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, so each of them is simply waiting for the right moment to enter in single file."

Only now did Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong fully grasp the situation, as the many pieces of recent events started to come together. Li Qinghong frowned and asked, "But... why not bring these fated individuals into the sects... dispatching them as sect disciples would give them loyalty, and afterward, they could officially be inducted."

Ning Heyuan looked slightly embarrassed and lowered his voice, "These people... they are meant to be divided among the Daoist Masters afterward. Making them official disciples would look bad, and if they were part of the sect, we would have to provide them with dharma artifacts. By sending them out to roam as rogue cultivators, they will discover countless grotto heavens and treasure troves on their own, and their artifacts will still be high quality... Ultimately, the sect gains it all for free."

"So that is the reason... truly... a clever scheme," Li Qinghong murmured. She thought of these so-called Fated Ones, who, despite their current glory, were unknowingly being guided toward a deadly confrontation at Green Pine Temple, where they would all end up as keys for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to unlock the ruins. She could only shake her head silently.

Ning Heyuan sighed and said quietly, "This is not the first time... it is the reward the Luoxia Immortal Sect promised Jiangnan."

Now that the details were fully laid out, the sequence of events became clear. Li Xuanfeng paused, then said gravely, "It seems that fate has its limits... it cannot contend against the divine abilities of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators... Since you mentioned that this is not the first time, has no one ever managed to escape?"

"There are always exceptions," Ning Heyuan replied with a slight smile. "Two hundred years ago, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan wanted to open the Douxuan Grotto Heaven at the Qunyi Strait. One fated individual managed to charm a fairy from an immortal sect, and after discovering the truth, they joined forces with another person of destiny. Together, they ventured deep into the grotto heaven, using their courage and fate to make a daring escape."

Ning Heyuan continued, "That individual was named Guo Shentong. He is now the Island Master of Crimson Reef Island, and his Dao companion is Fairy Tianwan of the Golden Feather Sect. As for the other who joined him, their name is lost to time, but they were known as Daoist Changxiao."

He looked intently at the two of them and added quietly, "Guo Shentong hid overseas, quietly cultivated to the Purple Mansion Realm, and later returned openly to Jiangnan to establish his own sect, which is now known as Changxiao Gate."

The revelation was significant, and both Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong were taken aback, even Li Xuanfeng raising an eyebrow in mild disbelief. Li Qinghong, surprised, asked, "So these two sects... did they intervene in the Green Pine Temple matter?"

"They are very much involved," Ning Heyuan gave a sarcastic smile and replied in a low voice, "With interests at the forefront, who would let this opportunity slip by? Should they release every Destined One, allowing them to establish their own sects and achieve the Purple Mansion Realm, ultimately squeezing their own territory? The two Daoist Masters would never permit that."

Ning Heyuan chuckled and said, "From what my uncles have told me, these two—of all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators—are the most wary of Fated Ones! I will not speak much of Daoist Master Changxiao, since he resides overseas and I do not know him well. But Daoist Master Guo alone has personally taken down two of them, both of whom he destroyed completely with his Purple Mansion Realm power, erasing those two arrogant young cultivators in the Embryonic Breathing Realm, body and soul."

He spoke as if he were sharing an amusing anecdote, though his tone held an undertone of schadenfreude and even a hint of envy he himself didn't seem to notice. He continued with a smile, "I saw it myself that year. That young cultivator, riding on his thread of fate, had overcome every obstacle and was just about to escape overseas. But Daoist Master Guo shattered the great void, descended right there, and wielded a Grade Six spell combined with his divine ability, leaving the youth not even a sliver of a chance. He annihilated the young cultivator's entire clan."

Ning Heyuan shrugged. "He forged his own divine abilities through fate and understands its power better than anyone. How could he be careless? He will never let one slip away..."
