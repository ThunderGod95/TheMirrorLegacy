# Chapter 868: Shichuan

When Li Ximing had first designed the grand formation with Tinglan, he had proposed modifying Profound Peak's own formation disk. The brilliant display before them was clearly Tinglan’s handiwork. Changxi's grand formation belonged to the Earth-elemental path, specializing in defense; it would never have produced such a radiant spectacle on its own.

Ning Wan must have noticed that the modifications didn't perfectly align with the original Earth-elemental patterns on the disk. A glimmer of understanding crossed her face, but she knew better than to comment on it. Instead, she answered, “There’s a main command token refined by Tinglan within the formation. Zhaojing summon it with your divine ability.”

Li Ximing understood perfectly. He gently raised his hand, and a lattice of golden light flickered into existence across the sky. A moment later, a purple token with yellow patterns, about eight inches long, descended into his palm.

He was quite satisfied with the formation. As he took out a jade talisman and began engraving it with his divine ability to communicate with the array, he mused to himself.

'Changxi's gate was a poor one, built from nothing. Its only real asset was its unique dharma arts, which allowed it to accumulate some wealth. The most valuable thing in all of Profound Peak was the mountains they moved, year after year… Their formation disk was never very good to begin with, and it certainly couldn't compare to those of the Supreme Yang Daoist traditions. This current state is passable enough.'

After all, when Yehui had come knocking all those years ago, the Profound Peak Gate's grand formation had shown no reaction whatsoever, let alone emitted any kind of spiritual light.

Li Ximing's mood was excellent. He then noticed Kui Qi slowly surveying the area from mid-air before giving a slight nod. This Daoist Master from the Great Xiukui Monastery was more direct than Lingmei and Ning Wan. He offered few congratulations, instead saying softly, “Zhaojing, if you ever need to construct another grand formation, you can come find me at Tiger's Frontier.”

All over the island, the Purple Gen Broad Valley Pillars now pulsed with a faint glow. The sky above seemed clear, yet it held the surrounding cultivators in place, preventing them from taking a single step. Li Ximing finished carving the jade talisman, encoding it with permission to enter and exit the formation’s perimeter. He then summoned Li Jiangqian and casually handed it to him.

“For now, I'm leaving matters on the lake to you. These pillars are protected by the power of a Purple Mansion Realm grand formation to prevent internal sabotage, making them difficult to approach. Your first task is to plan the layout of the surrounding area. I will be back soon.”

Although Pingya Island was a ruin, such matters could be left to Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan without further instruction. He couldn't keep the other Daoist Masters waiting. Li Ximing made a gesture of invitation, and the four of them pierced through the Great Void, flying toward the domain of the Great Xiukui Monastery.

Traversing the Great Void with Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities was astonishingly fast. Even with Jiangnan’s vibrant spiritual energy making the Great Void more perilous, their speed was incredible. They landed among the temples and palaces atop the Tiger's Frontier summit, where several Foundation Establishment Realm disciples were sweeping snow from a long staircase winding up the white-blanketed mountain.

The snowfall seemed to quicken in Ning Wan’s presence. Li Ximing glanced down the long steps on the mountainside and saw Cui Jueyin still waiting at the bottom. The man stood respectfully amid the vast whiteness, likely not having moved for days, a mere thumb-sized black dot among the great mounds of snow.

“Zhaojing!” Ning Wan called out.

Li Ximing took a seat and accepted a cup of tea. Kui Qi, with his sharp eyes, had obviously noticed the scene below. He shook his head with a chuckle. “After all these years, the Cui family is still the same… It’s a pity. After crossing the sea several times, their courage was slowly broken. You rarely see anyone from the Purple Mansion Realm on Chongzhou Island anymore. After all, they all seek the path of Bright Yang. How can one attain such a righteous Dao when they harbor guilt and fear toward it? They might as well cultivate something else…”

Li Ximing sighed inwardly, unsure how to respond. Kui Qi’s words were perhaps just a passing lament, but Lingmei sensed Li Ximing’s awkwardness. He inverted the Great Snow's Severing Edge in his hand and passed it to Ning Wan.

“I was fortunate to hold such a fine spirit sword,” he said. “My thanks to Daoist Master Qiuhu.”

Though Ning Wan hadn't feared that Lingmei would keep the sword, she felt a wave of relief as her fingers closed around the hilt. She accepted it with thanks. Kui Qi gave a few quiet instructions to an attendant, dismissing them, before his expression turned serious.

“The situation in Jiangbei is our most urgent concern. With Tinglan injured, the Purple Smoke blessed land cannot be mobilized, and Zhu Gong's whereabouts are unknown. Daoist Master Qiuhu, I’m afraid we must rely on you to oversee matters along the river.”

“After all, Serene Listen is a Life Divine Ability. For now, you are the only one we can depend on.”

Ning Wan seemed to have anticipated this. “I don't mind shouldering the responsibility,” she replied softly, “but I haven’t possessed my divine ability for long. It will be difficult to influence events on the other side. If the north plans any schemes, I won’t be able to hold out for long on my own.”

“Those monks and their undying ambitions!” Kui Qi sighed, a flicker of displeasure finally showing. “Zhelu won't dare cause trouble for a while. Be cautious when you are alone, and don’t venture too far. There’s nothing those bald donkeys can do then. With Zhaojing here on our side of the river, reinforcements are always ready.”

He then turned specifically to Li Ximing. “Zhaojing, you need not get too involved. You have only just returned to the mainland, and you must be wary of others plotting against you. Stay out of the True Monarch’s affairs; just keep an eye on the Northern Buddhists’ movements.”

“Besides, your Audience with the Celestial Gate is incredibly useful. Should anything happen, we will arrive quickly. Just be sure not to stray too far from Jiangnan.”

“Understood!” Li Ximing had no intention of meddling and agreed without hesitation.

Lingmei’s expression was placid. He took a sip of tea and added quietly, “The Azure Pond Sect still has the Great Konghai Temple to contend with in the Southern Sea. Although Daoist Master Zhusheng and that Snow Ridge Listening Pine Fox have managed the situation, Daoist Master Qiuhu is stretched thin. Zhaojing, if you are able, lend them a hand to prevent any mishaps.”

Ning Wan’s voice was gentle. “If it’s possible… that would be for the best. I have already sent a sliver of my divine ability there.”

Li Ximing looked up, a hint of confusion on his face. Lingmei explained in a low voice, “The Great Konghai Temple seized the Southern Sea before Daoist Master Qiuhu could intervene. Two Daoist Masters from the Southern Borderlands stepped in, acting out of their respect for Daoist Master Yuanxiu. One cultivates ‘Jade True,’ which can make illusions real, while the other, a demon, cultivates Cold Qi, which blocked that Baoqing. When the Maha sensed something was amiss, he immediately retreated.”

“The master of the Konghai Temple was satisfied with taking the Southern Sea. But Baoqing has both a fated connection and a personal grudge with the Three Yuans. He will certainly return for revenge…”

Lingmei seemed lost in thought. “Although that demon beast’s words were harsh, this fated connection cannot be so easily severed…”

The sword cultivator’s expression grew complex. “You have only seen Yuanwu in his decrepit old age,” he said softly. “In his youth, he was the very picture of arrogance. As the eldest disciple-brother of the Three Yuans, he wore iron-winged silver robes, carried the All-Encompassing Pagoda, and wore boots of embroidered black silk. In front of hundreds of cultivators at Shitang, he stomped on another man’s face, trying to force him to admit that the Shi were inferior to Immortals.”

“Yuansu and Yuanxiu were already at loggerheads then, on the verge of becoming enemies. Baoqing had the misfortune of stumbling into him at that moment. Yuanxiu even made the jest, ‘One Talisman is Enough,’ before using his golden talisman to smash Baoqing to death. If the master of the Konghai Temple hadn't personally come to the rescue, with Yuansu also there, Baoqing wouldn't have even had the chance to reincarnate.”

Beside them, Kui Qi’s brows were tightly furrowed, but he could only sigh. “Though I dislike Yuanwu, that act was truly satisfying. My master, Great Daoist Master Lou Xing, even praised him for it. I suppose arrogant men are kindred spirits; it’s why Yuanwu ended up associating with Situ Tang.”

Li Ximing’s memories of Yuanwu were faint, mostly connected to his subordinate, Yu Muxian. In those days, Yuanwu and the Tang family had placed immense pressure on the Li Clan. He never imagined the man had been so brazen in his youth. “Year after year,” he sighed, “so many geniuses rise and fall.”

Kui Qi glanced aside, where a woman was ascending through the snow, carrying a black treasure box.

He took the box and placed it in front of Li Ximing with a smile. “This is a Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill, a treasure from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. It is the same spirit pill that Bright Yang Purple Mansion Realm cultivators once took. My ancestor examined it and confirmed that this pill can repair one’s Dharma body, suffusing it with light. It is exceptionally useful for comprehension, healing, and cultivation.”

“However, this pill focuses on gentle nourishment. Its strength lies in its steady, continuous effect, making it unsuitable for use during combat. Zhaojing, you must be mindful of this.”

Li Ximing nodded eagerly. He was not lacking for combat-oriented pills at the moment and was overjoyed by the gift. He gently took the box and opened it to find three golden pills resting inside. Each was traced with white, qilin-like patterns. Though many years had passed, they had been so well-preserved that they still brimmed with spiritual energy, looking quite extraordinary.

“The alchemy of Eastern Fire was truly remarkable… It possesses a unique magnificence…”

As Li Ximing spoke his admiration, Ning Wan, having seen Kui Qi present the pills, paused for a moment before adding softly, “Speaking of which… I heard from my ancestors that within the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven, there grew a spirit flower known as ‘Yearly it blooms and withers, its fallen petals become armored insects.’ It was obtained by Daoist Master Qiushui and is now in the possession of the Golden Feather Sect. There is also an alchemical text, the ‘Radiant Qilin Refining Art,’ which I believe corresponds to this very Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill.”

Li Ximing listened with rapt attention. The fall of the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven had scattered countless extraordinary Bright Yang treasures, yet his clan had not received a single share. He couldn't help but ask, “There were many Bright Yang spiritual artifacts in the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. Do any of you know how they were divided? Which sects ended up with them? I still lack a suitable spiritual artifact since my breakthrough and should acquire one.”

Kui Qi seemed to have anticipated the question. “During the Eastern Fire incident, I was in the Great Void protecting my comrades and did not participate personally, so I received little,” he said softly. “The main beneficiaries were the Golden Feather and Azure Pond Sects. Mount Changhuai, the Purple Smoke Gate, the Chunyi Dao Gate, and the Chen Clan also gained something. Profound Peak and Crimson Reef Island controlled a few of the sea entrances, so they collected some scraps.”

Most of the names were expected, but the inclusion of the Chunyi Dao Gate and the Chen Clan gave Li Ximing pause. Ning Wan, who knew more about the matter, clarified, “The Three Sects and Seven Gates all sent disciples to claim a share, but they only took non-essential items. The true treasures were the portions left over from the main peak after the True Monarch took his fill, as well as several important side peaks.”

“Three spiritual artifacts and two spirit embryos were recovered. The spiritual artifacts were divided among Mount Changhuai, the Azure Pond Sect, and the Golden Feather Sect. As for the spirit embryos, one went to the Chunyi Dao Gate, and the other is in the hands of the Purple Smoke Gate.”

'In the hands of Azure Pond?'

At the time, Yuanxiu had been in seclusion, which meant the representative from the Azure Pond Sect had been Daoist Master Yuansu. That meant the spiritual artifact had fallen into the hands of the Ning family. Li Ximing's eyes lit up, though a question arose in his mind.

'Tinglan has one as well? And she never mentioned it.'

The treasure in the Azure Pond Sect’s possession was a completed spiritual artifact, whereas the Purple Smoke Gate’s was a spirit embryo that still required nurturing—a significant difference in quality. Although a spirit embryo refined by the Cui family would undoubtedly be superior to anything Li Ximing could create himself, a finished spiritual artifact was surely better. “That spiritual artifact…” he began eagerly.

Ning Wan shook her head with a touch of embarrassment. “My ancestor obtained that Bright Yang spiritual artifact, but it was ill-suited for him and incompatible with my Cold Qi. He traded it to King Luoshe of Southern Songzhou in exchange for the protective treasure I now possess.”

Spiritual artifacts were, by nature, secretive things. Ning Wan didn't elaborate, but as the inheritor of Yuansu's legacy, she was certainly not lacking in treasures. She paused, then added, “Although Sister Tinglan’s spirit embryo is excellent, it is not of the Bright Yang path. The Purple Smoke Gate had the first choice, and they naturally selected the one most suitable for them. The one left for the Chunyi Dao Gate, however, is of the Bright Yang path.”

Li Ximing felt no disappointment. Yuansu had been nearing the end of his life and must have made arrangements for everything, not keeping a spiritual artifact for himself. In any case, it was simply a matter of a trade. As long as he knew its location, it was manageable. He murmured to himself, “So, it's one of three: the Golden Feather Sect, Songzhou, or the Chunyi Dao Gate…”

The Golden Feather Sect possessed a wealth of treasures, but Li Ximing doubted he had anything that could persuade them to part with one. The items held by Songzhou and the Chunyi Dao Gate seemed more attainable. “This King Luoshe of Southern Songzhou,” he asked, “what sort of person is he? What Daoist tradition does he cultivate?”

At his question, Lingmei stroked his beard. “I know of him,” he answered. “A mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, the Supreme King of Songzhou. His power has expanded dramatically in recent years, making him a dire threat to Thunder-Hearing Island. If not for the fact that he cultivates the path of Shamanic Talismans, which is somewhat restrained by the Miao Family's lightning arts, Thunder-Hearing Island would have already been destroyed. You could start your inquiries there.”

“As for the Chunyi Dao Gate,” he continued, “they consider themselves the orthodox lineage of the Supreme Yin and are bound by strict rules. A Bright Yang artifact would be of little use to them, and a spirit embryo is less valuable than a full spiritual artifact. In my opinion, that one might be even easier to obtain.”

The network of a Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was far beyond what a solitary cultivator like Li Ximing could muster. An introduction from Kui Qi and the others would greatly improve his chances. Li Ximing nodded repeatedly. “Then I must trouble you all.”

He paused before adding politely, “If a spirit embryo proves unattainable, do any of you fellow Daoists have an ancient Bright Yang Dharma artifact that I might study?”

Li Ximing had already made his plans. He had acquired the *Refining in the Fiery Pavilion* from Changxi, and the ritual platform by the shore was complete. Regardless of the outcome with the spiritual artifact or the spirit embryo, it was never a mistake to begin refining one himself. For that, he would need to seriously consider a base, and an ancient Dharma artifact was the ideal choice.

His request seemed to surprise them. Cultivators from the Supreme Yang Daoist traditions typically selected an ancient Dharma artifact during their Foundation Establishment Realm and carried it all the way to the Purple Mansion Realm. Li Zhouwei, for instance, could begin refining his Grand Ascension Halberd into a spirit embryo the moment he broke through.

But as soon as the words left his mouth, all three nodded. Kui Qi raised an eyebrow and smiled. “Huiyu, bring the ancient Bright Yang Dharma artifacts from the treasury!”

A black-robed Daoist wiping a Dharma sword on the highest step immediately rose and bowed. Kui Qi nodded back. “We have a stock of ancient Dharma artifacts. My family should have the most—three in total. Zhaojing, pick one. Please, don’t be polite!”

With Kui Qi’s swift offer, Ning Wan and Lingmei could say no more. But ancient Dharma artifacts were not like their modern counterparts; their numbers were finite. They were not items to be given away lightly, even among Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Li Ximing was stunned. “I cannot accept a gift from the Xiukui for nothing…” he said, shaking his head.

Kui Qi laughed heartily and rose to his feet, a look of pleasure on his face. “Since all our fellow Daoists are present, I will be direct. I will not treat you unfairly. Not only may you choose an artifact, but I will also gift you a spiritual extract, a resource for the Bright Yang path…”

A sharp glint flashed in his eyes as he stated his price. “My Xiukui… wants Fei Qingya.”

The words hung in the air, and Li Ximing finally understood. By association with the True Monarch, the Li family had acquired Fei Qingya. She was a liability now, but once the True Monarch departed, she could become an invaluable asset. The Great Xiukui Monastery was clearly tempted!

As realization dawned on Li Ximing, he saw that Lingmei was unsurprised. Ning Wan, however, having only recently reached the Purple Mansion Realm, did not grasp the full implications and looked on thoughtfully. Kui Qi smiled. “I thought if she didn't cultivate Cold Qi, she would cultivate ‘Purple Qi.’ I never expected that with you two trapped in the north, fate would intervene, and she would end up cultivating Pit Water. And with Xiao Chuting in the Northern Sea… this fine seedling, it seems, is destined for my Xiukui!”

The Great Xiukui Monastery oversaw many subordinate monasteries, which cultivated not only the ‘Xiukui’ arts but also ‘Pit Water’ and ‘Shamanic Talismans.’ Li Ximing’s mind raced, weighing the possibilities.

If he didn't kill Fei Qingya, keeping her within the clan would be inconvenient. She currently held a favorable opinion of the Li family, but she was still a Fei, with the potential to reach the Purple Mansion Realm. The Fei family also had ties to the Sima Family's troubles. Once her cultivation advanced, there was no telling what complications might arise.

More importantly, the memory of Xu Xiao was still vivid, and Li Ximing remained wary. His Talisman Seed and Immortal Mirror were his greatest secrets. If an outsider from another clan reached the Purple Mansion Realm under his roof, too much would be exposed. And should the Fei family develop ambitions of its own, they could vacillate between ally and enemy, or even break away entirely.

He had considered arranging a marriage, but she was the True Monarch’s woman. Marrying her to a Li family member would be a direct insult to a True Monarch—a historically unprecedented act of foolishness.

Sending her to a Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, on the other hand, could forge an alliance with a future Daoist Master. His only fear was that if she achieved great power at Xiukui and the Fei family sought her aid, the trouble stirred up by a major Daoist tradition would be far more lethal. Despite his reservations, Kui Qi had made his offer plain. Li Ximing could only sigh. “It is not that I am unwilling… I simply fear that her worldly attachments will prevent her from focusing on cultivation, and she will end up wasting your esteemed sect’s resources.”

Kui Qi caught his meaning. “Zhaojing, you can rest easy on that score,” he smiled. “My Dao has ways of initiating one into a monastery, of clarifying the heart and proving one’s path through an oath not to let clan matters interfere. As for the Fei family… my Linhai prefecture is vast and mountainous. There is certainly room for another clan. When the time is right, we can move them to Linhai and, following precedent, establish them in the deep forests with their own monastery.”

It was clear that although the Great Xiukui Monastery's primary Daoist Masters were surnamed Lin and their clan dominated the region, the numerous monasteries scattered throughout were not merely for show. Li Ximing nodded, choosing his words with care. “That would be best. However, she is originally from Moongaze Lake. My family sends her an annual stipend of resources, as is our custom. Does your esteemed monastery have any rules that would prevent her from accepting them?”

For the Li family, this was a gesture to maintain goodwill, but it was also a way to gauge the importance the Great Xiukui Monastery placed on Fei Qingya. Kui Qi simply raised an eyebrow and replied cheerfully, “Not a problem!”

Li Ximing surmised that the Lin Clan already had its own pillars of strength, making Fei Qingya a welcome but not essential addition. He relaxed considerably as the black-robed Daoist returned, carrying a jade plate upon which rested three treasures: a ring shimmering with Profound Light, a long and elegant spear, and a ruler of azure jade.

The Daoist presented the three ancient Dharma artifacts with a respectful bow. He first indicated the ring, which was made of golden jade and bore three points of brilliant light. “This is the Outer Frontier Ring,” he said reverently. “It is an ancient Dharma artifact that the Great Daoist Master acquired from the Northern Buddhists in his youth. It dates to the early Liang dynasty. It can dissolve Dharma power to escape as a beam of light, and its three bright points can unleash three streams of Profound Light to strike down foes.”

The ring was both ornate and versatile, clearly an auxiliary Dharma artifact once worn by a noble scion of the Wei imperial family. The Daoist then picked up the spear. “This is the Heaven-Measuring Bright Spear. It was recovered from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. Its age is unknown, but it predates the Liang dynasty, from sometime after Emperor Gong. The spear can transform into light to pierce and wound enemies. It is immensely powerful but demands skill in weaponry.”

Finally, he gestured to the jade ruler. It was over a foot long, carved with intricate patterns of mountains and rivers, and exuded a warm, gentle aura. “This is Shichuan,” he said. “It also came from Eastern Fire and is even older, likely predating Emperor Gong of Wei. It can summon projections of mountains and rivers to cover a battlefield, empowering its wielder and allowing them to walk on Profound Light. It can also be used to sense an enemy’s movements.”

Li Ximing surveyed the items. As expected of the Great Xiukui Monastery’s collection, none were ordinary. The Daoist had provided only a brief summary, but each artifact possessed deeper mysteries. As a cultivator of the Bright Yang path, a single glance allowed him to grasp most of their functions.

'The ring is likely the most valuable. Its functions are comprehensive and would be immensely useful to a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. But I have already mastered a divine ability. Even if I were to refine it into a spirit embryo, I can already replicate many of its functions myself. It isn’t an exceptional choice for me.'

'The spear is a purely offensive weapon, but it relies on martial skill rather than mystical spell arts. I don’t mind practicing Dharma Arts, but I’ve had no affinity for spears or swords since childhood. To start learning now, at the Purple Mansion Realm… my divine ability grants me clarity, so I might not be worse than an ordinary cultivator, but it would be laughable among my peers.'

'This ruler is well-rounded, yet grand. Its abilities have some overlap with the wonders of my Audience with the Celestial Gate…'

He considered them from his lofty Purple Mansion Realm perspective, his standards exacting. Hearing Ning Wan’s soft exclamations of praise, he knew that even the Azure Pond Sect’s offerings could not surpass these. He reached out and picked up the Shichuan.

Kui Qi sipped his tea and explained casually, “The Shichuan is of an exceedingly high grade. It was likely a plaything of an imperial descendant qualified to contend for the throne. That is why it is more refined than it is powerful. Once you supplement it as a spirit embryo, it will be quite formidable.”

“It is one foot two inches long, eight-tenths of an inch thick, and one and two-tenths inches wide. The material is Stork River Azure Jade, a substance now lost to time. It is exceptionally fine. The tail is engraved with ‘Yang Extreme,’ the head with ‘High Radiance.’ It depicts mountains and rivers, but no deities, putting it only a single step below the specifications for an artifact of a Wei crown prince.”

He was clearly intimately familiar with the treasures of his sect. He gazed at the Shichuan with a touch of wistfulness. “When I was being punished by guarding the treasury, the Shichuan was on the third platform to my left. I often found myself wondering if its owner ever took that final step… The master of such an elegant artifact ought to have brought a long era of peace to the Wei state.”

Li Ximing nodded. No wonder the ruler felt so unexpectedly heavy. Since its material was superior to the other two, its potential was also greater, making it the most worthy candidate for a spirit embryo. This realization swept away any lingering hesitation. Content, he smiled and said, “Many thanks, fellow Daoist, for making this possible!”

Kui Qi smiled and waved his hand dismissively, then turned to give an order. “Go and bring the spiritual extract.”

The black-robed Daoist departed at once. Li Ximing caressed the warm, smooth surface of the Shichuan, growing fonder of it by the moment. The Wei style tended toward one of two extremes: either domineering and fierce, or calm and majestic. The Shichuan was undoubtedly the latter, and he found it difficult to put down.

'This will be my first Purple Mansion Realm spirit embryo!'
