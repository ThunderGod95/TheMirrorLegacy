# Chapter 826: Rumors

"Let us hope your auspicious words come to pass, Family Head."

Zhang Duanyan shifted her gaze away from Cui Jueyin and replied.

The attempt by Daoist Master Qiushui to seek the Whole Pill Fruition Attainment was the one thing the entire Zhang family desperately hoped would succeed. It was also an endeavor the entire Golden Feather Sect was sparing no effort to support. The benefits of gaining another True Monarch were so enticing that the mere thought could make one’s breath quicken. Li Jiangqian's words had clearly struck the right chord, bringing a hint of a smile to Zhang Duanyan’s face.

"The Sect has been paying attention to the brethren of your noble clan... truly, all are talents. My Golden Oneness of Highest Azure daoist tradition also regards them highly. If the opportunity arises, you may send them to the mountains to seek entry. Although my family is strict in recruiting cultivators from outside the Grotto-Heaven, given the aptitude of your clan's geniuses, they would have a very strong chance."

Li Jiangqian smiled and nodded, uncertain how much of her statement was genuine and how much was mere courtesy. Since she hadn't produced any token or command sigil, he treated it as polite chatter and refilled her tea.

The Golden Feather Sect’s stance toward the Li family was neither good nor overtly malicious; it remained perpetually ambiguous. Although they proclaimed to their own disciples that Li Tongya and Zhang Yun were close friends, when it came to practical matters, there was little tangible support to speak of.

This wasn't specifically targeted at the Li clan. Compared to other sects, Golden Feather already showed considerable goodwill toward Moongaze Lake. When Yuansu died and the matter of Li Xuanfeng's custody fell into the hands of the Purple Mansion realm cultivators, Qiushui’s attitude had been amicable. The present Zhang Duanyan was also approachable. Had it been any other power, their attitude might not have been nearly so pleasant.

The Golden Feather Sect had always acted with a certain capriciousness. If their interests aligned, they could be generous in sharing benefits. If their interests conflicted, the Dao lineage wouldn't hesitate to inflict harm. Despite this, their reputation in Jiangnan remained quite good. After all, for such an enormous Golden Core Dao Lineage, people tended to forget its severity and were far better at remembering its kindness, provided it showed even a sliver of gentleness.

Now that their business was concluded, Li Jiangqian began to subtly probe for information, sighing.

"My family has only just attained the Purple Mansion Realm, and we must rely on your esteemed sect for guidance in all matters. The Upper Sect from the north has passed down an edict, which we were fortunate to receive via Golden Feather... After all, years ago, that Daoist Master Chi... he was observing the mortal world within the Azure Pond territory. When Azure Pond received their orders, they completely disregarded the minor clans below them..."

His face showed resentment, but the words carried a deeper meaning.

No one knew if Mount Luoxia had actually passed the command to Azure Pond. His question, while appearing to be a complaint, would inevitably force a response that hinted at the positions of the various sects. More importantly, it touched upon the nature of Golden Feather's role in this trip. For the dignified Golden Feather Immortal Sect to act as a mere messenger was, ultimately, not a glorious affair.

Zhang Duanyan sipped her tea before replying.

"When Azure Pond was previously under Daoist Master Chi, he was indeed a bit hasty and paid little attention to the people's livelihood."

Having said this, she skillfully avoided the Azure Pond issue and instead smiled.

"The ancients always emphasized the division of Dao Lineages. Take the Green Pine Supreme Yang Dao Lineage; it can be traced all the way back to an Immortal Lord. As long as one inherits the Green Pine Supreme Yang Dao Lineage, they must show each other some face. Outsiders who see this connection will also take a step back."

"Jiangbei is also one such region of lineages. If we speak purely of Dao Lineage divisions, my Golden Feather has some jurisdiction over sects like Chengyun and Xuanmiao. This is the same reason the northern power is referred to as the Upper Sect."

It was a clever answer, deftly sidestepping the matter of Azure Pond. Li Jiangqian nodded.

A nostalgic look crossed Zhang Duanyan's face as she continued, "Once... in the Ten Directions Conclave, there were established rules between sects. Only remnants of those rules remain today. Your noble clan can still rely on this connection to pay respects to the various Supreme Yang Dao Lineages. When the Immortal Mansion existed, noble clan would have been considered a subordinate. Although they would count as part of the Supreme Yang Dao Lineage, there was a clear hierarchy between you and direct lines like Purple Smoke and Azure Pond... Nowadays, however, that hierarchy is not so easily enforced."

She paused, then looked at Li Jiangqian with a smile and nodded. "I heard my grandfather mention... the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture... is in your clan's possession?"

Li Jiangqian’s expression flickered, but he nodded lightly.

While the matter was important, there was no reason to hide it. Zhang Yun himself had visited the Li family years ago to confirm this. Now that the family had their own Purple Mansion Realm expert, the cultivation method no longer seemed so dangerously valuable as to invite disaster.

Thus, Li Jiangqian rose from his seat, bowed, and replied, "Years ago, my ancestor was acquainted with Senior Zhang Yun. They discovered a hidden trove together, divided the spiritual items, and thus obtained this technique. It has been kept in our treasury ever since."

Zhang Duanyan showed no surprise. "The Great River and Grand Mound Scripture has been lost for many years, and our sect lacked the method to unseal it. We believed that with Senior Tongya's celestial bearing, he would surely have the fortuitous opportunity to decipher it. So, it was entrusted to your clan, considered a continuation of his Dao path."

"We never imagined that Jingzhan would harm the senior and his son. At that time, voices within the sect demanded we send someone to the lake to retrieve both the cultivation method and the Duruo. My grandfather argued against the consensus, came personally, and intended to exchange it for the Wanling Flower as a replacement."

Li Jiangqian listened intently as the woman chuckled. "He didn't expect the Wanling Flower to be connected to Yinghua, so Grandfather returned empty-handed. It was then that the voices in the sect claimed he was protecting Senior Tongya’s descendants due to their deep friendship."

"So that's how it was!" Li Jiangqian nodded thoughtfully, musing internally.

'The news that the Jade slip contained the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture came during the destruction of the Moongaze Lake Market. That group of people... perhaps it included Golden Feather cultivators who intentionally shouted the name to give our family a clue.'

Finally understanding the origin of the rumor, he naturally wouldn't say anything else, offering only, "My deepest thanks to your predecessor!"

He then asked, "Senior Zhang entered seclusion to break through. Is there any news?"

Zhang Duanyan’s expression remained unchanged. "My lord broke through long ago. He is currently within the Grotto-Heaven studying mystic arts."

"Senior truly is a peerless talent!" Li Jiangqian nodded slowly, a realization dawning on him.

'There were no phenomena in the wider world. It seems... one truly can break through to the Purple Mansion Realm inside a Grotto-Heaven. If so, then how many Purple Mansion experts the Golden Feather Sect actually has, how many are active in the world, and how many might have fallen... it’s nearly impossible for the outside world to discern.'

'A Grotto-Heaven... truly extraordinary. It's understandable why Yue Cultivating Sect abandoned Jiangbei and Yue State. Even if they lost all their external territories, they still possess an entire, vast world within the Grotto-Heaven.'

The two chatted for a while longer. When the sun passed noon, she rose to leave. Li Jiangqian escorted her beyond the island. As they were parting, Zhang Duanyan turned back, a bright smile on her face.

"Since your noble clan cannot open the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture, letting it sit in your treasury for a hundred or even a thousand years won't change that. Why not let it go? Allow someone in the world bound by fate to obtain it. They will surely make it shine with brilliance."

She seemed to be implying something specific. Li Jiangqian, catching her meaning, replied, "I understand. Thank you for the guidance, Immortal Emissary."

She and the old man then departed to the north. Based on their flight path, they were likely heading toward the White Ye Immortal Sect.

Li Jiangqian mulled over her words on his way back.

'It makes sense. It will never open itself just sitting in the treasury. But if we let it flow out into the world, we'll lose track of it. It seems we must identify the right person to pass it to, just as the Zhang family did with us...'

'But how to identify this person? Furthermore, their cultivation method would need to be compatible...'

He found this approach too inefficient and frowned... when a better idea struck him.

'Perhaps we could have a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator use their divine abilities to place a secret imprint upon its surface. Then we let it drift freely. When the time comes and someone opens it, we would sense it, shatter the Great Void to arrive as if reaping a harvest, and obtain a superior Purple Mansion Dao Lineage.'

At this thought, a chill climbed his spine.

'If I can think of this, wouldn't the Zhang family also have thought of it? Wouldn't the various Purple Mansion experts who carved up Lingyu Gate have thought of it? Can it be that this item was released... just waiting for a cultivator bearing the mark of destiny to activate it?'

'How did Zhang Yun determine that my ancestor carried the mark of destiny? Could it be that the copy of the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture he saw happened to share the same energetic affinity as my ancestor's cultivation method, allowing it to be continued? And seeing his extraordinary bearing, he decided to test him, thus forming his speculation?'

'If the Zhang family hadn't hinted at it, I would never have considered this possibility!'

Even someone as ruthless as him couldn't help but feel suspicious. 'Ordinary cultivators might not think of such a venomous plot. Whether this imprint exists or not... we'll know as soon as the Daoist Master returns. I'll ask him to examine it.'

Li Jiangqian walked back to the main hall, lost in thought. The teapot and jade cups had already been cleared from the table. Cui Jueyin followed behind him, his head lowered, seemingly in a daze.

Suddenly, Li Jiangqian turned around. "Protector Cui, regarding this matter with the Upper Sect, does the Cui family have any knowledge?"

Cui Jueyin bowed deeply, his gaze fixed on the floor. "Reporting to the Family Head... it is truly that my family... for a thousand years... what we have endured... endured..."

This Foundation Establishment Realm Daoist, who for years had always maintained the calm and elegant demeanor of a noble scion, now seemed utterly terrified. The mere mention of Mount Luoxia seemed to evoke an extreme, primal fear.

"The Dongli Sect... annihilated in an instant... A direct edict from the Upper Sect. Our ancestors acted rashly and defied it. Three generations were nearly exterminated. Even Purple Mansion Divine Abilities cultivators died violently within days. We must fear it. We *dare not* fail to fear it!"

"Now, the edict is before us. All we can do is tremble, prostrate ourselves, and await orders."

Li Jiangqian stared gravely at him. Beads of sweat continued to drip uncontrollably from Cui Jueyin's neck, one after another. This was the first time he had ever seen Cui Jueyin in such a state, and he sensed a profound, deep-seated unease.

'If I keep pressing, I'm afraid disaster will spring from his words.' He sighed inwardly and said, "Protector Cui, go and rest well."

Cui Jueyin stood, bowed, and retreated from the side. Li Jiangqian’s gaze fell upon the empty desk.

'Comprehending Profoundity, reflecting the purple. Wu Light meeting the heavenly glows. The Jin-Yi path... is one of supplication.'

'Golden Feather has a reputation of subservience to the north... and most of the time, this reputation is fact. That entity in the north... is confirmed to be at the Dao Embryo realm, without a doubt. As for how many Dao Embryos are behind them... that is hard to say.'

'Zhang Duanyan implicitly revealed that the Jiangbei families and Golden Feather belong to the same Dao Lineage. Since Golden Feather cannot refuse, these lineages can all be considered subordinates of Luoxia. This means the mastermind behind the conflict between north and south, and the designs on the fertile lands of Jiangbei, is also perfectly clear.'

A feeling of powerlessness rose in his heart. He forced the thought away and focused his mind back on Jiangbei.

'The Ding Clan moved their entire population; they can be protected. Qu Bushi and Miaoshui are merely local guest elders with shallow connections. The family's deepest entanglement... is the Wang Clan.'

The Jiangbei Wang Clan had lived and grown in this place for generations. Escape was impossible. No matter how cleanly they tried to cut ties, the karma remained.

"Right now, whoever is biggest in Jiangbei is destined for the worst luck... We must pull back from the lands of Funan for now. Bring all the cultivators back. Let it go wild. Don't touch it. Don't even go near it."

He summoned an attendant. "Pass down my order. Tell the Second Young Master to depart immediately and report back to the Lake."

The attendant received the order and was about to leave when Li Jiangqian hesitated, then called him back. "Go and ask Protector Cui. It would be best if he personally traveled to Jiangbei to deliver this order."

Besides Li Jiangqian himself, Cui Jueyin was the only one in the family who understood the gravity of the situation. His own brothers were not easy people to deal with, and this matter was one of absolute urgency. Li Jiangqian could not afford any mistakes.

He immediately got busy, spreading out the bamboo slips on his desk, noting down every possible oversight.

'Wang Quwan is tied to the Secret Diffusion Dao Lineage. We must protect him if possible... but his connections to the Jiangbei Wang Clan run too deep... this is truly...'

As Li Jiangqian pondered this, he suddenly froze. A dark cloud of suspicion crawled across his features.

'Wang Quwan... Wang Quwan... It couldn't be... Could it be that destiny pushed this person forward first, intending him to be a stepping stone for that True Monarch? If so... isn't this man doomed to die?'

His heart heavy, he deliberated for a long time before ordering, "Summon Qu Bushi."

Old Man Qu’s immortal foundation was the Palace of Concealed Storage. He excelled at surveying earth-veins and nurturing spiritual fields. Having already organized the lands of Funan, he had spent the last few years by the lake identifying fields, teaching a few apprentices, and re-classifying the Li clan’s spiritual fields. He was living a quiet, secluded life.

He was quite idle, so he arrived quickly at the hall upon being summoned, prostrating on the floor. "This lowly one greets the Family Head!"

This old man usually kept a low profile, avoiding involvement in anything significant. He was exceptionally cunning, which was precisely why Li Jiangqian had sought him out. He smiled and asked:

"I need to ask you about something. You are very familiar with Funan in Jiangbei. Are there any independent cultivators there, Foundation Establishment Realm, who have absolutely zero connection to my family?" He paused, then added, "Preferably ones who aren't gentle... the tyrannical, overbearing types."

Qu Bushi was baffled by the request but sank into deep thought. "There are many independent cultivators in Jiangbei now, but very few in Funan; it's mostly managed by our own cultivators and manpower. However, I have heard... in the Midong territory, there are several."

Midong had been tossed by the Li family into the hands of the Capital immortals Dao and had long since devolved into chaos. The Capital immortals Dao had sent several cultivators to manage it over the years, but all had failed. Eventually, they resorted to simply collecting a stipend, and the place remained a total mess.

Qu Bushi observed his expression, guessing he was looking for some kind of scapegoat, and answered:

"If Milord is looking for someone ignorant and untraceable, this subordinate has an idea. There are countless people like that in the Eastern Sea. Lure one over, tempt him, perhaps point a demonic cultivator his way... let him murder for treasure and create his own sect gates. Once the man is dead, everything vanishes. Very convenient."

Qu Bushi truly lived up to his reputation as someone who had survived the Eastern Sea to reach Foundation Establishment. Li Jiangqian considered this and immediately had a plan.

'The Capital immortals Dao will surely send someone to negotiate soon. This isn't a matter for just one family. I vaguely recall that Guan Gongxiao also knows how to handle things. This is the perfect time to deal with it.'

'This will also force our two families to break the cold war we've had for years. I wonder what the Capital immortals Dao's attitude will be.'

He looked up. "Guest Elder Qu, stay by my side for the next few months. When the time comes, there will be matters I need to discuss with you."
