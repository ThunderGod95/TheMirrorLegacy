# Chapter 1075: The Four Seasons

Though his gaze was veiled, how could Ning Wan fail to notice it?

The feud between the Ning Clan and the Situ family was far from simple. The enmity between Ning Tiaoxiao and Situ Tang ran as deep as the Eastern Sea, utterly irreconcilable. His conflict with Situ Huo himself was just as deep-seated. No wonder her face had gone pale!

Situ Tang had plundered and seized whatever he wanted, showing no regard for his descendants and leaving them with a mountain of hatred. Situ Huo was smart; hiding himself away in the vast sea was far better than Situ Nu's fate, who had been caught between two sects, had his Dharma Body shattered by Chi Wei, and was nearly beaten to death in a single breath.

But just as Situ Huo had finally endured long enough to see his day, Daoist Master Yuansu, on his deathbed, had decided to take his frustrations out on him!

That battle had cost him an arm and left him in a wretched state. A man like Situ Huo—how could he possibly not hold a grudge?

Her gaze was tranquil, but her heart was ice-cold. She remained silent.

The animosity between her clan's Daoist Master Yuansu, Ning Tiaoxiao, and the Situ family was ancient and unavoidable. Although Ning Wan had been in seclusion when Ning Tiaoxiao fell, she still understood the situation clearly.

'Back then, with the great northern war looming, my Lord knew his time was short. He made a special trip to hunt down Situ Huo... Unfortunately, that final attempt... also ended in failure.'

Ning Tiaoxiao had been famous in his lifetime, especially for that sharp tongue of his. His abilities were considerable; relying on his spell arts, Dao-Profundity, and the 'Spring's Echo'—which was both a Body Divine Ability and a Life Divine Ability—he had forced countless villains to bow their heads. Compared to the exiled Situ Huo, he was heaven and he was earth. But Ning Wan knew in her heart that in her Lord's later years... he was willing, but the strength was fading.

'The gap between divine abilities cannot be ignored. Sometimes, suppressing even one divine ability can decide a battle. It was my Lord's exceptional talent that allowed him to compensate with his own Dao-Profundity... But eventually, as other Daoist Masters enhanced their own divine abilities, that gap was destined to close, and he would even be surpassed.'

For that final battle, Ning Tiaoxiao had surely made ample preparations. But he hadn't anticipated that Situ Huo would successfully condense his third divine ability. Even though Ning Tiaoxiao still beat him down like a helpless child, the opportunity to take his life was lost.

That feeling—of being slowly caught and even surpassed by mediocre talents far less gifted than oneself, sometimes even by the descendants of one's enemies—must have been unbearable. Whenever Ning Wan thought of it, a chill crept into her heart.

'I heard that in his later years, my Lord's temperament grew increasingly paranoid. He must have known this great threat to his heart could not be eliminated... If the Ning Clan couldn't secure the backing of the Chi family, we would likely face total annihilation...'

Ning Tiaoxiao had no children. In all honesty, Ning Wan felt her elder had already done more than enough. Now, seeing Situ Huo, she didn't feel this was some poison left behind by her predecessor. Instead, she met his gaze with an icy stare of her own, returning it with sharp intensity.

'A homeless cur...'

Situ Huo's eyes met hers for an instant. He wasn't surprised; there was even a flicker of understanding. He slowly withdrew his gaze, his heart as calm as still water.

'It's not surprising. It's only fitting that Ning Tiaoxiao would have such a descendant.'

Even so, he paid the woman no real mind. His attention returned to the Tablet of Proclaimed Might in his hand. Staring at the short, blade-like token, a blazing fire of desire ignited in the depths of Situ Huo's eyes as he scrutinized it.

He studied it, lost in his own world. But the crisis had clearly been resolved. On the Great Song's side, everyone was injured, yet not a sound was made. They all wore different expressions, exchanging glances.

Only Lingu Lanying, whose spirit embryo had been stolen, was unreconciled. She took a step forward, looked at Situ Huo, then at Tinglan, who stood with her head bowed in silence. She could only shake her head, her brow furrowed, and watch helplessly as the cultivators departed.

Just then, Situ Huo returned the celestial edict, and his old hand suddenly gripped the jade blade.

He cultivated 'Engraved Stone', a Dharma Body divine ability that was highly ranked even in the Purple Mansion Realm. The Tablet of Proclaimed Might was not meant for cutting, yet it easily sliced open his palm. It flickered brightly, and thick blood, like molten gold, dripped from the blade, transforming into roiling water and fire as it fell through the air.

'Good...'

The treasure flared and dimmed three times in the air, showing signs of trying to break free, but it was suppressed by the celestial edict. It finally settled upon him, subdued. The old man turned around and said flatly:

"This old man is Situ Huo... I have been humbly appointed as the General Who Pacifies the Huai, and concurrently as the Military Commissioner of Golden Tang. Everyone... I look forward to your guidance in the days to come."

The night sky was still silent. A crystal-clear jade sword slid back into its sheath, stirring up a cloud of dense white mist. The white-robed Daoist Master, dressed dashingly and holding his sword, let out a sneer.

"Looks like this old dog doesn't have to be a stray anymore!"

It was none other than Daoist Master Zhusheng, the one who had fought fiercely against Gongsun Bei and saved the overall situation. Utterly fearless, he scoffed, flicked his sleeves, and departed, leaving only his cold words to echo in the air.

His words plunged the crowd into silence once more. Situ Huo, however, smiled, looking rather pleased with himself, as if pondering something. He took a step forward, swept his gaze over the assembly, and said softly:

"It seems Daoist Friend Liu still clings to old grudges. Not very magnanimous of him."

Tinglan was left speechless and cursed inwardly:

'Magnanimous? How could anyone be magnanimous? Situ Tang wiped out an entire remnant clan of Chu-Liu... The bodies of Chu-Liu descendants who died at his hands could form a mountain! The Blood-Omen Tower is probably filled with their baleful-blood qi!'

This didn't stop Situ Huo's old eyes from roaming, finally landing on Ning Wan's face.

"So, a descendant of Daoist Friend Yuansu... How rare... how rare..."

Ning Wan's expression had mostly recovered, but it remained cold and sharp. She clutched her sword and said nothing.

Situ Huo suddenly laughed.

"Daoist Master Yuansu gave me much 'guidance' in his life. Now that he is gone, all that remains is..."

He put on an expression of not knowing her name and looked around. Only Xianyao took a step forward and was about to raise his sleeve, but Lingu Lanying had already spoken, her voice soft:

"This is Fairy Qiuhu, Ning Wan."

Situ Huo's eyes flickered slightly. He smiled.

"Ah, so it is Ning Wan!"

Beside them, Tinglan's expression was just as sour. This Daoist Master from the Golden Tang Gate had truly terrible relations. In all of Jiangnan... especially among the cultivators represented by the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, there were likely few who felt any goodwill toward the Golden Tang Gate. How could she possibly be in a good-natured mood?

'The chaos in the Golden Tang bloodline was the result of deals between Azure Pond and Golden Feather. At its root, the relationships between Situ Tang's descendants are toxic, filled with sinister and vicious individuals. Situ Huo is a prime example of this, only with an added layer of caution... This is trouble...'

But right at that moment, an old Daoist Master emerged from the group. He wore robes of glazed grass-cloth and had a smile on his face. He bowed with clasped fists, eager to change the subject, and laughed.

"Congratulations, Daoist Friend!"

This was Daoist Master Xianyao from Overlook Peak. The two seemed to have some history. Situ Huo returned the courtesy in a slow, deliberate manner and turned to the crowd.

"Everyone, please guard Yufu. I am heading to Tangdao Mountain to report."

Ning Wan looked up, somewhat dazed. Tinglan, her expression complex, stepped forward with her, rushing to separate the two and explaining in a low voice:

"Lord Yang has already... conquered Tang Blade Mountain! I will go report at once."

She mounted a purple cloud and vanished into the Great Void. After flying a short distance, she turned her head back, unable to ignore the situation completely. She said softly:

"The North is powerful now. Senior, you and Wan'er both serve the Great Song. The old feuds mostly stemmed from Situ Tang. I ask that Senior please let them go... It will not do to disrupt the Emperor's affairs."

Situ Huo's smile vanished. He said quietly:

"Thank you for the reminder, Daoist Master. Ning Tiaoxiao was indeed capable. I even admired him somewhat. Resentment... is not quite the word."

The old man's gaze was calm, and his tone was serious. He was old; his admiration for Ning Tiaoxiao outweighed his resentment. But that didn't mean he wouldn't avenge the humiliation of being hunted.

'He tried to kill me not necessarily because he hated me, but because I am a descendant of Situ Tang. That remains true. If I get the chance, I will eliminate Ning Wan for the same reason: because she is a descendant of Ning Tiaoxiao.'

He rested his hand on the Tablet of Proclaimed Might at his waist, but his mind was already elsewhere.

'The key right now is the Purple Mystery... I have been stagnant for far, far too many years... The light of cultivation is my only chance!'

...

In the distance, illusory colors shimmered faintly. A cold autumn wind drifted by. The steps were bathed in the fading sunlight. Inside the great hall, the bright silver cauldron still stood. Though it was only just the beginning of autumn, the clear water within it had already frozen solid, a sheet of glittering silver.

The hall felt vast and empty. A Daoist Master in white robes sat at the head seat, holding a vermilion brush. He heard footsteps approaching from outside the hall, and a woman ascended the steps.

She was tall, with a refined and beautiful face. A three-petaled white flower was painted between her brows, giving her an ethereal, otherworldly air. She had a high-bridged nose, wore a white dress, and carried a longsword on her back. Her movements revealed a fiery, impetuous nature. She bowed at the steps and said in a low voice:

"Martial Uncle!"

Above, Wei Xuanyin looked up, a trace of surprise in his expression. Before he could speak, the woman before him was already frowning and blurting out:

"Martial Uncle Wei, is it true? We really can't take back Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain!"

Wei Xuanyin pondered for a moment, then set aside the Daoist book in his hand. 

"At least, not right now."

The woman paced a few steps in agitation.

"Earlier, we thought Shu was strong and Song was weak. With King Wei also in seclusion, we assumed the Great Song couldn't stir up any trouble anytime soon, so we moved our people to the Long region. We never expected that while we held that front, we'd end up losing more than half of Jiangbei!"

Wei Xuanyin sighed silently.

"Was Mount Bianyan secured?"

The woman paused, her slight confusion making her features even more vivid. 

She replied, "Fortunately, it was secured. The 'Exiled Qi' has already dispersed. Martial Uncle, you are in charge of the Zhaoyao Four Seasons Cauldron. How could you not know?"

Wei Xuanyin shook his head, staring quietly at the bright silver cauldron. The ice within was unbreakable, reflecting a faint silver light. The master of the Profound Governance Pavilion said,

"The 'Book of Zhaoyao' states: 'Spring resides in the Horn, thus there is growth. Summer resides in the Blaze, thus the cold is released. Autumn resides in the Harvest, thus there is storing. Winter resides in the Mansion, thus there is preservation. Together they mark the year, divided into four seasons, to be cultivated for balance and consumed for spiritual nourishment.'"

"The Zhaoyao Four Seasons Cauldron is indeed a supreme treasure for divination and detection. But the Harmonising Metal, which represents autumn, has entered its embrace-lock to store the Vault Metal. Around the autumn equinox, the cauldron's power is greatly diminished. It is not what it was. I can no longer see clearly."

Wei Xuanyin tapped the table in frustration.

"I told all of you to study it properly. In the end, none of you have learned the true essence. You should have seen this coming."

"How could I possibly compare to Martial Uncle!"

The woman replied, abashed. She thought it over, then asked in sudden alarm:

"Does this mean... they planned this?!"

Wei Xuanyin smiled.

"The Great Song has the Exiled Qi. Why would they need to scheme like this?"

He placated the woman, but his gaze was deep and thoughtful. He stroked the cover of the book.

'The Great Song doesn't need to, but other Daoist Traditions might... On the surface, Jiangbei's interests are aligned... but there are plenty of people colluding between north and south for private gain. Being able to avoid my detection would naturally be best for them.'

He fell silent, but the Daoist Master before him spoke again.

"When I came in just now, I saw Li Jieyi waiting outside... It's strange. Mount Dayang hasn't even rushed to punish him this time, yet he's the one rushing to find you, Martial Uncle!"

"He's afraid."

Wei Xuanyin sighed, but he didn't elaborate on the monk's situation. He frowned.

"Baiyue, I told you to go south and find Lanyan. Why have you returned?"

At the mention of this, Yin Baiyue looked aggrieved. She gritted her teeth.

"What choice did I have? Disciple-brother Qi has been like a different person these past few years since he left the mountain! I went to Xuanmiao Temple to find him, and he insisted I return. He said nothing could touch him, that he would bear responsibility for everything himself... But if something _does_ happen, who in the Profound Governance Pavilion will be able to escape the consequences!"

Wei Xuanyin was silent. He lowered his gaze.

"That child is too impatient. No matter what anyone says, he just won't listen."

Wei Xuanyin was older and had watched these "children" grow up. It was a habit to still call them that. But as soon as Yin Baiyue heard it, she sensed something was wrong. She looked up sharply, her expression changing.

"Martial Uncle, are you..."

Wei Xuanyin composed himself slightly.

"Then you will stand guard in the Long region. There's no need to go east."

Yin Baiyue clasped her hands, suppressing the doubt in her heart. She said, troubled:

"That Situ Huo... The northern families contacted him several times, but in the end, he actually defected to the south... It's truly unexpected."

Wei Xuanyin smiled.

"He's a clever man, or he would have been torn to pieces long ago. What he wants is to seek higher Dao-Profundity, but he's unwilling to abandon his self. He would never casually join the Buddhist cultivators, so how could he possibly come north?"

"His battles in his early years likely cost him a significant portion of his lifespan. Time is now running short, and there are very few things that can help him cross the threshold of the Purple Mystery. It's only natural he would pledge himself to Martial Cultivation."

Yin Baiyue asked, puzzled:

"I heard Disciple-brother say the same... He didn't seem surprised. But... but... Geng-Dui is the private reserve of the Golden Oneness of Highest Azure. Why didn't he join Shu? Why join Song instead?"

Wei Xuanyin nodded.

"That's why I say he is clever... He isn't desperate to ascend to a throne. All he wants is to reap enough benefits in this chaotic world to push his cultivation to its peak. Reincarnation is a slim chance, but if he were to seek the Buddhist path after achieving such power, wouldn't it be a natural progression? He might even be subject to fewer constraints."

His expression was gentle.

"You should all learn from this... Since your minds are muddled and you lack the will to truly seek the Dao, you shouldn't be fantasizing about that final step, about reaching some Lesser Attainment. Do you think a Lesser Attainment is so much easier to achieve?"

"The difficulty of seeking some Lesser Attainments exceeds even that of Fruition Attainment!"

Yin Baiyue hesitated for a moment before replying,

"This disciple is enlightened..."

Wei Xuanyin knew she hadn't truly taken it to heart. He could only sigh inwardly, blaming himself for not setting a better example. He didn't press her further, just waved his hand.

"Hurry to the Long region. And send Li Jieyi in."

Yin Baiyue had no choice but to bow and retreat. A long while later, a monk ascended the steps. He wore light brown monastic robes, and his face was etched with bitterness. He walked to the front of the hall and gave a deep bow.

Wei Xuanyin did not look up. He lifted his vermilion brush and tapped it lightly on the scroll.

"I told you not to go south. And now you've returned, carrying the blame for another's crime."
