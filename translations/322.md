# Chapter 365: Azure Manifestation

Yuan Tuan had just finished speaking when Li Ximing stepped forward, drawing everyone's attention. He wore loose white robes and appeared quite dignified though his voice still sounded somewhat immature.

"Junior Li Ximing greets Senior!"

Yuan Tuan looked at him carefully, the long ribbon at her waist gently fluttering. She smiled and said, "I heard from my senior brother that there is an alchemist with a harmonious aura, blending together both water and fire. Now that I see you, you are indeed a fine seedling!"

With that, she took Li Ximing's hand and asked warmly, "Do you have a suitable alchemy furnace, Ming'er?"

Li Ximing was slightly taken aback and looked at Li Yuanjiao, who gave a slight nod before he replied, "Yes, Senior! I already have one!"

The Li Family's alchemy furnace had been taken by Li Tongya from someone else when the market fell many years ago, and it was at the Qi Cultivation Realm. At that time, the Li Family was still weak, and Li Tongya feared that possessing such a treasure would bring trouble, hence it had been sealed away for many years.

Now that the Li Family's foundation was stable and they had an alchemist, the furnace finally saw the light of day, though its presence was known only to a few direct descendants.

Upon hearing this, Yuan Tuan paused as she rubbed her storage pouch at her waist, sensing the alchemy furnace inside. She could not help but laugh bitterly to herself.

This is awkward. I have owed Yundan Peak a favor for nothing...

The Li Family had only been established for less than a hundred years, so Yuan Tuan did not expect them to have an alchemy furnace ready. She thought for a moment, then took off a jade bead from her wrist which was tied with a red string, and put it around Li Ximing's wrist. She then smiled warmly.

"Consider this my gift to you, Ming'er!"

Li Yuanjiao noticed the brilliant radiance of the jade bead and knew instantly that it was no ordinary item. He was delighted but quickly said modestly, "Peak Master! How can we accept this?!"

Yuan Tuan laughed, looking at Li Ximing's serious little face, liking him more and more. She then explained, "This item was my protective treasure during my years as a Qi Cultivator, and it is called Azure Manifestation. It has been tempered by my cultivation method for many years and possesses some spiritual abilities. It can transform into an eagle, dog, tiger, or deer, making it an excellent dharma artifact for those at the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realms.

"Now that I have achieved the immortal foundation, Azure Crest Manifestation, and nurtured it for two years, it has become even more miraculous, almost a Foundation Establishment Realm artifact... The abilities of Azure Crest Manifestation overlap with this item, so I no longer need it and so I will give it to Ming'er!"

Li Yuanjiao could tell that Yuan Tuan had originally intended to give an alchemy furnace as a favor, but now that she had given the jade bead instead, it must be of equal value. Alchemy furnaces were rare and priceless, and this jade bead being comparable was extraordinary. He immediately said, "Quickly thank the Immortal Master!"

"Thank you, Senior!" Li Ximing replied earnestly.

Yuan Tuan nodded before extending her delicate hand, and released a faint white light that enveloped them, isolating them from the outside. She then asked seriously, "Are you aware of the chaos caused by the devil plague?"

Li Yuanjiao immediately became alert, and Li Yuanping, Li Xicheng, along with the others also pricked up their ears in attention. Li Yuanjiao replied, "Our family is located in northern Yue and has heard some news... It is said that Jiang Yan committed all kinds of evil, spreading the devil Dao lineage everywhere. These teachings have even spread among rogue cultivators and commoners, causing widespread chaos, especially in the south, which suffered greatly..."

"Correct." Yuan Tuan nodded and continued in a low voice, "Although Jiang Yan opposed our sect, he practiced the shamanic dao, not the devil dao as rumored. Moreover, he has been missing for many years... The devil plague must have another cause."

Li Yuanjiao frowned slightly and replied, "Senior, you mean to say that... the devil plague in Yue State is caused by someone who deliberately spread the devil Dao lineage...? Is anyone in the sect going to suppress and resolve it?"

Yuan Tuan's expression was difficult to read as she said softly, "No, but there are concerns among the peaks. We fear that if the devil plague is left unchecked, it will eventually lead to a tragedy like that of Pingming Ford."

The great battle between the immortals and devils took place at Pingming Ford, causing heaven and earth to collapse, mountains and rivers to submerge, and the divine continent to sink. This led to the immortal cultivators abandoning the north, the invasion of the Jie people, and the widespread influence of Buddhism, resulting in the current situation.

Li Yuanjiao nodded silently, understanding the gravity of the situation. Yuan Tuan then advised, "In recent years, we have repeatedly found traces of devil cultivators in the Mushroom Forest Plain, and we have even lost two Qi Cultivation Realm disciples. It seems the situation is worsening and moving north... Please keep an eye on this."

"Thank you for the reminder, Senior!"

Seeing Li Yuanjiao's respectful response and knowing he took this matter to heart, Yuan Tuan's delicate fingers emitted a trace of azure light. As soon as it touched the ground, it transformed into two white deer, blinking their eyes and standing still.

Yuan Tuan then said softly, "Good disciple, follow me back to the peak!"

Li Xizhi hurriedly bade farewell to his parents and brothers, then mounted the white deer and soared into the clouds.

Yuan Tuan gracefully mounted on the back of the deer as well and said softly, "If you wish to send a letter to the sect, send it to the Yuan Family. The favor of the predecessors will eventually fade, so work hard on your cultivation."

Her voice lingered in the air as the two white deer stepped on the clouds and disappeared without a trace. The remaining people looked up, and Li Yuanping finally spoke, "Azure Crest Manifestation truly has the demeanor of an immortal... I wonder which lineage it belongs to!"

The two exchanged glances, both pleased with the smooth proceedings and the gifts they had received. Li Xijun leaned over to Li Ximing curiously and said, "Brother! Let us see your fine dharma artifact!"

Li Ximing nodded eagerly, having been excited for a while but trying to maintain the family's dignity without showing joy in front of Yuan Tuan. His eyes sparkled as he activated his mana and the jade bead glowed slightly, then emitted a stream of azure light that drifted to the ground.

The azure light transformed into a white deer, about the size of a cat, looking very lively and blinking at the people. Li Xijun laughed, flipped onto the deer's back, and attempted to ride it.

The spirit deer, however, would not comply, darting left and right actively and trying to hide behind Li Ximing. Li Xijun laughed, grabbing its antlers and playfully wrestling with the spirit deer while Li Ximing held the bead and grinned.

"First stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm..." Li Yuanjiao muttered as he scanned the spirit deer with his spiritual sense, still dressed completely in black.

Li Yuanping nodded and replied, "It should be related to the cultivation level of the bead holder."

"Ming'er!" Li Yuanping called out, and Li Ximing hurriedly brought the dharma bead over, reluctantly handing it to Li Yuanjiao.

Li Yuanjiao took the dharma artifact, Azure Manifestation, and channeled his mana into it. After a few moments, he remarked, "It has some spirituality... it has already recognized its master."

He then handed the jade bead back to Li Ximing. Li Ximing, whose eyes had been glued to the bead, was overjoyed at this and tied it back onto his wrist.

After sending off the children among the generation of Xi and Yue, several clan guards entered the hall for the night watch. The two men sat down at a small table, and Li Yuanping said in a low voice, "The devil plague is approaching. I reviewed the clan's situation recently and wanted to discuss it with you, Big Brother."

"All right," Li Yuanjiao replied.

Li Yuanping began, "There are currently six Qi Cultivators in the clan. Big Brother is at the sixth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm, Big Sister at the fifth heavenly layer, Uncle Donghe is currently away from home, Father is at the third heavenly layer, Sister-In-Law Guiluan and my mother are at the first heavenly layer."

"Besides the main lineage, there's also a Qi Cultivator in the branch lineage named Li Wen, who has just broken through. He's from the Jade Court Guards, specializing in protective duties." He paused, then called out to the clan guard, "Summon the battalion commander."

The person acknowledged his command and retreated while Li Yuanping continued, "External cultivators Tian Youdao, Tian Zhongqing, and Xu Gongming are all at the first heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm, and guest cultivator An Zheyan is at the seventh heavenly layer. As for Unrefined Qi Cultivators similar to Li Qiuyang, there are seven to eight of them, mainly from Mount Yue. Facing a Qi Cultivation Realm devil cultivator would be a death sentence for them..."

After hearing this, Li Yuanjiao said in a deep voice, "Excluding our uncle and father who are not at home, there are six early-stage Qi Cultivators, two mid-stage, and one late-stage."

"Correct," Li Yuanping confirmed with a nod.

Just then, a robust, tall man with a rough face and strong build entered, kneeling powerfully with an aura that could push down golden mountains and jade pillars.

"Court Guard Li Wen greets Family Head and Clan Uncle!"

The treatment for Jade Court Guards was equivalent to that of a battalion commander, so Li Wen had sufficient resources for his cultivation. He had also been practicing the rapid cultivation method, Guardian of the Courtly Path, and was now just over thirty.

Li Yuanping quickly called him to rise and explained to his elder brother, "This man has been in seclusion and breaking through in recent years, so he may seem unfamiliar to you, Big Brother."

Li Yuanjiao nodded and asked, "Which branch are you from?"

Li Wen replied, "My great-grandfather was the younger brother of Li Mutian, the youngest son of Li Genshui, and the elder of the four branches..."

Seeing this sturdy man's face full of pride and chanting this lineage fluently, Li Yuanjiao found it both amusing but headache-inducing, and quickly interrupted, "I understand, so you are from the youngest son of Ancestor Genshui's line."

Li Wen nodded proudly, the fluent recitation indicating he often spoke of it. Li Yuanjiao took out a bottle of pills from his storage pouch and placed it into Li Wen's hand, saying lightly, "Consider this a greeting gift from your clan uncle."

"Thank you, Clan Uncle!" Li Wen bowed again and murmured his thanks before retreating.

"He seems honest," Li Yuanjiao remarked, watching his retreating figure.

Li Yuanping, his face pale, nodded and hinted, "The branch lineage has many people, but their talent is lacking. Among so many, only he has emerged, and even among the Unrefined Qi Cultivators... there is only Uncle Qiuyang."

"Indeed..." Li Yuanjiao nodded, placing the jade cup on the table. "It does seem too few, which might raise suspicions," he commented with a sigh.

After all, the main lineage of the Li Family consistently produced children with spiritual orifices, each generation more talented than the last. Although the two main branches had many descendants, including many mortals, somewhat balancing the high ratio, the branch lineage had been too lackluster, producing no notable talents for many years. Such a thing could arouse suspicion among those with ulterior motives.

"What is your suggestion, Brother Ping?" Li Yuanjiao asked earnestly.

Li Yuanping had already made his plans but still looked to his elder brother, Li Yuanjiao, for confirmation. Hearing the question, Li Yuanping nodded slowly and answered, "We approach it from two angles. For the branch lineage, reduce their households under charges and encourage cultivators to marry into the main lineage, changing their surnames. For the main lineage, expand the branches and increase the population... I have been working on these matters for the past few years."

Li Yuanping paused, his expression somewhat grim as he explained, "After all, abolishing the ancestral temple is a significant matter. It strikes a painful blow to the branch lineage. Changing the surname from Li to Ye and expelling them is extremely painful for the branch lineage, comparable only to death... This needs to be done gradually."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, staring into Li Yuanping's eyes as he said softly, "I have a good method."

"I would like to hear the details!" Li Yuanping chipped as he looked up.

Seeing this, Li Yuanjiao began, "Nowadays, there are more and more wastrels and ruffians among the branch lineage. Although the Clan Affairs Courtyard has many cultivators, they cannot spend all their cultivation time managing the clan members, and they are gradually becoming overwhelmed. Several fools are even being played around by the prominent families."

His voice was low, almost drifting in the air as he continued, "Should there be a war, we could mobilize the clan disciples as soldiers and generals according to tradition. This would eliminate the weak and retain the strong, cleansing our family and greatly reducing our burden."

Li Yuanjiao had fought on the battlefield in his youth, beheading many in Mount Yue. At that time, Li Yuanping had not yet been born. By the time he took charge, Li Yuanjiao had already restrained his nature, discussing matters with him day and night without showing any ferocity.

Now, hearing these words, Li Yuanping understood why their father, Li Xuanxuan, always said that Li Yuanjiao had too strong of a killing intent. He silently took a deep breath and asked, "Who would we fight?"

"It does not necessarily have to be a war; it is just an idea," Li Yuanjiao chuckled, his eyes fixed on the letter from Eastern Mount Yue on the table. He then said warmly, "Eastern Mount Yue is now also occupied by the bloated and useless clans. Back then, we needed these clans to restrain Shamoli. Now that the Tian Family has succeeded, keeping them around is just allowing them to embezzle spirit resources and occupy spirit fields."

He sipped some tea and said softly, "First, eliminate the parasites in the clan. Second, deal with the lords of Mount Yue. These matters must be resolved before the devil plague arrives to prevent our family from becoming weak and allowing these parasites to grow unchecked."

The Xiao Family, Xianyou Peak.

The cold water in the clear pool rippled slightly, and the spiritual grass on the shore grew crookedly. Xiao Chuting rode a rainbow light out of the void and sat on a rock at the highest peak.

"The Supreme Shaman's Three Nine Blood Essence is truly magnificent."

Xiao Chuting stroked his beard, filled with emotion. The golden light had flashed in the void for over ten breaths, alarming all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the Wu and Yue States. Witnessing the once-in-a-century spectacle of the metallic essence dissipating filled them with awe.

"Qing Jifang is still young and judges others by himself... He really thought these Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, no matter how far they advanced, would always be afraid of death and submit to his Mount Changhuai."

Thinking of Qing Jifang's shocked and terrified face when he was solidly hit by the supreme shaman's metallic essence, Xiao Chuting felt quite pleased.

"Jiang Boqing... Since the fall of Duanmu Kui and the loss of Answers to a Beggar's Questions Under the Mulberry Tree, he knew he did not have much time left... He was just unwilling to die without trying to break through one last time..." Xiao Chuting reflected.

Back then, Jiang Boqing materialized in the void of Lixia Prefecture, his aura comparable to the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm. This terrifying presence had left the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of the Azure Pond Sect paralyzed with fear. They could only watch helplessly as Jiang Boqing manipulated them like puppets, not daring to utter a word.

Looking back at today, he had been surviving under the jurisdiction of Azure Pond Sect for over ten years, forced to damage his own metallic essence in order to seize Dao foundations and flee in all directions. In the end, he had to sacrifice his own life only to severely injure a junior, which was truly lamentable.

"Such bad luck. Just when Duanmu Kui fell, he also met his end, becoming a target for everyone and losing his chance for reincarnation..."

Xiao Chuting took out a white jade fishing rod and placed it on the rock. Just as he was about to use his divine ability to see if there was anything valuable nearby, a warm voice sounded in his ear.

"Welcome back to the mountain, Ancestor. Yuansi is here to pay his respects!"

Xiao Chuting face showed a trace of helplessness. Despite his attempts to avoid him, Xiao Yuansi still found him. In a hoarse voice, he said, "Come up!"

Before long, Xiao Yuansi, dressed in white and emanating a medicinal fragrance, flew up. It seemed he had just finished refining a batch of pills. He landed in front of Xiao Chuting and greeted respectfully, "Yuansi greets the ancestor and congratulates the ancestor on attaining advanced mastery of divine abilities!"

Seeing his overly formal and stiff demeanor, Xiao Chuting could not help but laugh inwardly. He asked, "Are you here because of Li Tongya?"

"Ancestor is perceptive; Yuansi is impressed!" Xiao Yuansi replied as he continued to stand respectfully.

Xiao Chuting had to put down the white jade fishing rod and said gruffly, "I have done my best! Li Tongya's fate is sealed. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators pushed him to that place, which is beyond my power to change anything."

Then he recounted the entire cause and effect of the matter with the Wrathful Maha, finally saying, "I have already tried my best to alter fate. Since Li Tongya's fate cannot be changed, we can only use him to gain more benefits... Our Xiao Family has some ties with his family, but not enough to offend numerous Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and disrupt years of plans for his sake."

Having heard the whole story, Xiao Yuansi could not help but exclaimed, "Why Li Tongya?! Why?!"

Xiao Chuting sneered and said in a low voice, "Perhaps it is because his fate is both fragrant and beautiful, or maybe because of his position at the junction of the north and south...making him convenient to manipulate. Or perhaps he was a resource prepared by the Maha years ago..."

He then paused slightly, as if thinking of something, and a scene from the void on that day flashed in his mind. He silently added in his heart, Perhaps it's not just to lure the Wrathful Maha using Li Tongya... but to test some other existence...

Seeing Xiao Yuansi's silent and thoughtful appearance, Xiao Chuting shook his head and sighed. "It is a pity that idiot Liu Changdie ran from east to west, then from west to south, desperately trying to traverse the entire Yue State, mixing up all the fates, making it impossible to deduce anything accurately. By now, there are already more than a dozen Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan who want to kill him with a single slap. They complain in the east, curse in the west, all barely able to restrain their anger."

Xiao Chuting chuckled as if recalling something amusing, leaving Xiao Yuansi confused. He only heard the name Liu Changdie but did not understand what everything else meant.
