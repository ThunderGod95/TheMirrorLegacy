# Chapter 789: Having A Child

Li Qinghong accepted the feathered robe and thanked Chu Minglian. Though the old man had been sent by the Ning Family and his compensation would be handled by them, Li Qinghong still took out a storage pouch from her sleeve and slipped it into his hand.

Chu Minglian naturally refused, but Li Qinghong softly said, "Senior Chu’s artifact forging skills are superb. My family may have further need of your expertise in the future. Our families have also long been connected. Please, accept this."

Chu Minglian hesitated for a moment, but ultimately tucked it into his robe, and took his leave. As Li Qinghong escorted him out of the hall, golden light rippled twice in the northern sky before gradually fading.

She calculated the direction; it was exactly where the ancient ruin had descended. She thought, The ruin has most likely already been divided, and the scraps others couldn't be bothered to carry are now left for the ordinary disciples of the various sects.

It was not just Li Qinghong, this was something all the nearby cultivators had grown used to. Year after year, whenever a grotto heaven appeared, it would always be divided among the major sects, and common cultivators would never get a share.

She looked closely and saw that the golden light flared up at that spot, streaking through the air with a trailing blaze, gradually growing larger as it neared, until it stopped before her. It was a woman in a Xiang-style robe, her Dharma robe shimmering, holding a golden orb in her hand.

She stopped before the formation and said with a smile, "Is Qinghong within the formation? Kong Tingyun of Profound Peak has come to visit!"

"Sister Tingyun." Li Qinghong paused only slightly before understanding, Profound Peak must have had a stake in the unidentified ruin as well. Now that Kong Tingyun had reached the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, she had naturally been sent there.

Kong Tingyun had just returned from the north, yet her aura was steady and her attire neat. She looked nothing like someone returning from a battle. Rather, she seemed like someone who had just broken through in cultivation.

As always, she was warm and friendly. She landed inside the formation and spoke with a sweet smile, "I had sect duties here, and when I heard that you were stationed nearby, I came to see you as soon as my tasks were done."

Li Qinghong dismissed the others, pulled her inside the cave dwelling, and said, "It's been years since we last met. You've truly changed a lot, Tingyun."

Kong Tingyun now carried a more dignified and refined air. Perhaps she had just emerged from secluded cultivation, for while her brows and eyes still danced with a smile, her clothing and the glow of her mana emanated a sharp intensity.

"I did come upon a fortunate opportunity, but my feelings haven't changed. Qinghong, don't treat me as an outsider." Kong Tingyun smiled and shook her head, sitting beside her and lowering her voice, "There were too many people earlier, so I couldn’t speak freely. I said it was sect business, but in truth, it was that fallen Dongning Palace. I saw many people and many things inside... It was just a few months, but it felt like years."

Li Qinghong nodded gently, and Kong Tingyun continued, "My family's power once lay between Xu State and Ning State. It was only after our family's upheaval that we moved to Jiangnan, so I know a bit about such matters. I gained some benefits in Dongning Palace, and heard a few things as well."

She spoke in a low voice, "Qinghong, do you still remember Wrathful Maha Fahui?"

When Li Qinghong heard that name, her expression turned solemn as she replied, "Of course I haven't forgotten."

Li Tongya had died because of him. Li Qinghong was not the only one who still remembered, but who in the Li Family didn’t remember?

Kong Tingyun continued earnestly, "He had cultivated through nine lifetimes, and was just one step away from attaining the Dharma Master, but he fell at Mount Bianyan. Wrathful Dao already had a scattered lineage, and it swiftly declined afterward...

"But while I was there, I encountered a monk and gathered some information from him... He said that in he earlier years, Wrathful Dao had a loyal Merciful One who returned from Mobei. He had been ambushed and seriously injured, but he had managed to escape and vanished."

Li Qinghong sharply met her gaze, her heart skipping like a lightning strike, Was this truly gathered intel? Or is Changxi using Tingyun’s mouth to send me a warning?

Either way, it made little difference. Changxi had tried to show goodwill to her family more than once. Li Qinghong quickly expressed her thanks, but Kong Tingyun waved her hand and said gravely, "No need to thank me, Qinghong. That’s not the only issue... there’s more trouble.

"First, a monk of the Way of Emptiness fled into your family's territory and was slain. He was one of the Five-Eyed Merciful One’s Arhats... someone who was valued greatly. Taking a life is the primary karmic tie... I fear they may come seeking trouble because of it.

"Second... there’s a Merciful One in the north; his Dharma name is Nuzi. He seems to have set sights on Senior Xuanfeng. He’s silently observing from the shadows. Though there are many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators around, so he dares not act, but it’s still unsettling..."

Taken together, this meant that three Merciful Ones had their eyes on the Li Family. Li Qinghong felt a heavy weight in her heart and bowed in thanks, "Many thanks for the sect’s warning... This favor will be remembered."

Kong Tingyun waved her hand and replied, "There’s also good news. Years ago, your family inquired with mine about the Bright Yang spirit item. I hadn’t heard anything, until now. I finally came across a Bright Yang Purple Mansion Realm spirit item, the Radiant Sky Stone, in Dongning Palace!"

The Li Family had inquired about spirit items several times. The Cui Family had initially pointed them to the Ning Family's channels. Li Xuanfeng asked once and had indeed acquired a certain item called Suyuan Hua in the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven.

But he had long traded that spirit item to Daoist Master Pu Yu from the outer sea in exchange for Winter Cold Qi to help Ning Wan with her breakthrough. That item had then fallen into Daoist Master Pu Yu’s hands, whose sect was elusive and untraceable, leaving them with no further leads.

Li Qinghong was instantly invigorated. She quickly met King Tingyun’s eyes and asked, "Did it fall into your hands, sister?"

Kong Tingyun shook her head regretfully and spoke in a low voice, "I was in a dangerous situation at the time and only caught a brief glimpse. The hexagonal white stone shimmered brightly, with light and flame intertwining around it, making the surrounding mist glow orange from the heat. It was definitely the Radiant Sky Stone.

"The Radiant Sky Stone was fiercely contested, but in the end, it fell into the hands of Yu Fuzi from Changxiao Gate."

Li Qinghong fell into silence, while Kong Tingyun raised her brow and said quietly, "This person has some strength, and he also bears a grudge against me. But right now, I have no idea where he is..."

Kong Tingyun's meaning was faintly revealed, but Li Qinghong’s heart sank.

Relations between the Changxiao Gate and Profound Peak Gate were far from cordial. In fact, Li Qinghong herself had killed a member of Changxiao Gate before, though it had yet to be discovered.

Kong Tingyun clearly hadn’t considered retrieving the item through trade as she likely believed the Li Family had nothing that could tempt Yu Fuzi. Yet Li Qinghong couldn’t just follow along with that view and remained silent.

Kong Tingyun said softly, "Yu Fuzi is a direct descendant of Changxiao. That sect has two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, and one of them is likely watching from the great void... It will indeed be difficult. I've passed on the message; if your family has allies who might be able to try, you'll have to judge for yourselves."

Li Qinghong softly thanked her. It was clear that Kong Tingyun was referring to Xiao Chuting. But the Xiao Family had become increasingly low-key in recent years and rarely appeared in public. Xiao Chuting had long been absent from Jiangnan, and the Xiao Family tended to avoid entanglements. So, it was very unlikely that they would offer support.

After chatting a little longer, Kong Tingyun took her leave on the wind. Li Qinghong escorted her out, then returned to her cave dwelling. After some thought, she quietly began to write a letter.

The Li Family household.

Winter snow fell with a soft rustle. This year, the snowfall was heavier. Cold snow gathered atop the long stone wall along the riverbank, painting it in stark gray and white. A few pedestrians hurried past, clutching new quilts in their arms.
𝒻𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘸ℯ𝒷𝘯𝘰𝑣ℯ𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝘮

This riverside dam had originally been constructed after two sects exploited the flood caused by the Yuan Family patriarch’s death. The lake had long since receded, leaving behind a long, gray-white dam wall.

Li Zhouwei walked casually down the snow-laden path, cloaked in a black robe. An Siwei and Chen Yang were following behind him.

His father, Li Chengliao, had already reached the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm and had gradually handed over family affairs to him before heading up the mountain to cultivate. Though Li Zhouwei had yet to formally inherit the patriarch's position, the responsibilities of the household had already fallen to him.

The Li Family had already begun separating secular family affairs from the immortal matters of Qingdu in previous generations. This was the trend under the likes of Li Yuanping, Li Yuanjiao, Li Xicheng, and Li Xijun. But now, things had changed.

Since Li Xijun was severely injured on Mount Qingdu and Li Ximing in seclusion, authority now rested with Li Zhouwei. Li Chengliao had relinquished power, and even the affairs of the central hall were now handled by Li Zhouwei.

He handled it all with composure. Each day, he would sit briefly in the central hall, with his brush sweeping like a dragon. Dozens of complex family affairs would be resolved in mere moments. Then, with a flick of his robe, he would return to Mount Qingdu, never wasting time.

Now that he had been cultivating for some time, he even had moments to observe the livelihoods of the common people by the lake. Golden light shimmered faintly in his eyes. A small blue bird was perched on his shoulder; it was the manifestation of the dharma artifact Azure Manifestation, a gift from Yuan Tuan. The spirit bird conjured from it appeared lifelike and animated.

"How have the arrangements for the seven remnant families gone?" Li Zhouwei asked softly, arms folded across his chest.

Chen Yang promptly responded, "They’ve been assigned to various towns and are following orders. As families with a history of wrongdoing, they’ve been quite diligent, though their status is ranked below that of the other families."

The remnant families Li Zhouwei spoke of were, of course, the families left behind after the fall of the Yu Family. All of them had been relocated to the southernmost reaches of Mount Yue, where they would be left to compete and struggle against the various tribes.

An Siwei responded calmly, "Reporting to the heir, the seven families now all identify themselves with Nanzhang Mountain in the southernmost part of Mount Yue. They each claim to hail from Nanzhang and no longer mention their past."

"Smart enough," Li Zhouwei replied casually. He noted the name Nanzhang and pondered, They could be a useful group... not afraid of offending others, and born in a savage land. That place is treacherous. If we give them just enough favor, they won’t be wiped out, and will still serve as a check on the inner families.

From An Siwei’s line, ‘they all claim to be from Nanzhang,’ Li Zhouwei understood that the seven families were consciously forming a united front. First, to contend with the native Mount Yue tribes, and second, to carve out a place in the silent struggles among the prestigious families across various towns.

After a century, the Li Family had already splintered into factions. The man behind him, Chen Yang, represented the Chen Family, and he was a leading figure of Lijing’s four towns among the various peaks.

An Siwei, naturally, represented Huayu’s seven towns. The remaining branches of the Li Family, along with Wutu’s eight towns, Huaqian’s four towns, the Milin’s eighteen towns, and the twenty-six tribes of Eastern Mount Yue each had their own external rivalries and internal discord. The complexity had grown far beyond what it was a century ago.

Among them, the Lijing faction was the strongest. Li Zhouwei had a reputation for favoring unpopular figures, such as Chen Yang, whom the other houses disliked. Bringing in An Siwei, who was well-respected among the Huayu families, was clearly a calculated move.

He was considering promoting one or two people from Nanzhang when a subordinate came rushing up to report, "My lord! News from the Clan Chief’s Court!"

The trusted aide pulled a letter from his sleeve and handed it to Li Zhouwei. He opened it and, after a glance, rare delight appeared on his brow.

"Xu Peiyu is with child," muttered Li Zhouwei.

Xu Peiyu was the first woman Li Zhouwei had taken as a wife. Later, he had married women from the An and Tian Families, with four concubines in total to stabilize his standing. Despite all that, Xu Peiyu still held a special place in his heart.

"No wonder."

Every time he visited, the woman only sought closeness to the point of exhaustion before resting. She hadn’t contacted him in the past two days, and he had thought she’d finally taken a break. However, it seemed she was pregnant.

He tucked the letter away, dismissed the two aides, and rode the wind to Lijing Mountain, landing in the jade-like courtyard of the central hall. The guards on both sides immediately bowed as Li Zhouwei strode straight into the hall.

"Greetings, Your Highness!"

The white-armored palace guards on either side all fell to their knees in unison. Jade halberds and swords clinked crisply as they arranged themselves neatly, their voices echoing in perfect harmony in the hall.

Li Zhouwei’s boots rang coldly against the floor. Unlike his father, Li Chengliao, who would pause to let the guards rise, he walked straight to the end of the hall before his voice finally floated back, "You may rise."

After a few more steps, he soon arrived at the rear hall. His father, Li Chengliao, had only one wife, so this place had always been empty. Now, however, it had become lively, with handmaidens often hurrying through the corridors.

Xu Peiyu’s building was nearby. When Li Zhouwei entered, a physician stepped forward and bowed respectfully. "Congratulations, Your Highness! Lady Xu is one month pregnant."

The physician lifted his eyes slightly but heard no response. He only saw the gleaming jade boots standing motionless before him.

They say the moods of lords are hard to read... and indeed it’s true... thought the physician.

Sweat trickled down his forehead as the man before him finally spoke, "One month?"

Li Zhouwei’s tone turned cold. He had visited Xu Peiyu several times this month. As a cultivator, how could he not tell whether she was pregnant? He was starting to suspect this man’s medical skill was poor. His diagnosis was pure nonsense.

"My lord." Just then, Xu Peiyu hurried up to him. Li Zhouwei glanced at her belly, and his expression softened somewhat. He dismissed the sweating physician with a wave and carefully examined Peiyu’s complexion.

Sure enough, though she seemed spirited, there were dark circles under her eyes. Her essence qi was subtly waning, and her cheeks were much thinner than usual. Li Zhouwei said nothing and followed her into the hall.

Golden light flowed in his eyes as his expression grew darker. It’s been less than ten days... yet the child already shows signs of being a month along...

Xu Peiyu was still unaware, chattering on and pulling him to talk about this and that. Li Zhouwei responded calmly, trying to reassure her.

The woman stared keenly into his eyes and murmured, "I've often felt dizzy and sluggish these past few days. My whole body feels drained of blood and qi. I nearly fainted a few times... I might need stronger medicine..."

"I'll take care of it... let's first have an elder examine you," replied Li Zhouwei.

A sense of foreboding rose in Li Zhouwei’s heart. He scrutinized her once more, then slowly turned and strode out. He soared into the air, leaving her behind still waiting in the hall.

Only after Li Zhouwei vanished from sight did Xu Peiyu’s expression finally show traces of fear. She felt as though all her essence qi was draining into her womb. As she sat blankly in her seat, a faint dread rose in her heart.

Each time she had lain with Li Zhouwei, a fragrance like peonies would intoxicate her senses, nearly causing her to lose her mind. Only after he had been gone for some time would she slowly feel fear again. Yet the moment he returned to the hall, she would rush out to greet him, overjoyed.

His Highness is divine and mighty, capable of ensnaring hearts and souls. Those golden pupils... he doesn’t seem human, but more like some demonic creature...

How could a human bear the child of a demon? What logic is there in that? He might devour me without hesitation!

Truly like a demon...

Xu Peiyu dared not tell anyone. Even to her own family, she only said the pregnancy was good news. But now, her legs grew cold. It felt as if a great stone had settled in her womb. It was so heavy she could barely breathe.
