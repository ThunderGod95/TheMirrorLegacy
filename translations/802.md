# Chapter 802: Nine Mounds

Pale light bloomed again in the pitch-dark cavern. On the ground, the green pool rippled. The young man opened his eyes once more, the world shifting from a blur into sharp focus.

*Drip.*

Chi Buzi raised an eyebrow, standing motionlessly. His eyes still held a thick, lingering expression of disbelief and joy. As if waking from a dream, he scanned his surroundings before standing still, sleeves clasped.

"Valley Water Intercalary Position..."

He stood dumbfounded for a long time, still feeling that the answers he received from the Immortal General were worth far more than two Purple Mansion beasts... The first sentence was, "Pristine Water and Valley Water have an intercalary," and the next was, "Cultivate 'Morning Cold Rain' to seek the Valley Water intercalary position." What kind of treatment was this?

'Even the great families like the Wang and the Xie... or the Luoxia and Dragon-kin... do they receive such treatment? If their descendants hit a bottleneck in cultivation and personally went to pay respects to a True Monarch, would they receive this level of guidance?!'

'Four Pristine and one Mansion seeking Valley Water? What an utterly astonishing concept! Yet, coming from that Immortal General Zhengao, it sounded as simple as post-tea chatter... What level of Dao insight is this? What kind of Dao lineage! If you swapped in another True Monarch, could they possibly reach such a conclusion in an instant?'

Chi Buzi’s expression flickered.

"Impossible... Even the True Monarchs of the current age, who have cultivated for so many years longer than that... one of them only managed to nurture a single Jade True Monarch. While it’s true that my heart for seeking the Dao is resolute, an ordinary Golden Core cultivator surely lacks such miraculous means to turn decay into magic..."

The gap was simply too immense. For a moment, Chi Buzi even began to suspect what kind of place the world beyond the sky truly was. He didn't know if other realms existed, but if this was all real, such a terrifying Immortal Palace could likely command this realm as if it were child's play.

Chi Buzi was naturally suspicious and didn't dwell long on such extravagant fantasies. Instead, he sought the most reliable guess, musing inwardly:

"This level of Dao lineage insight... it must be a heritage from the Middle Antiquity period, at the very least..."

He sorted through his thoughts, gradually grasping the key point as his eyes narrowed.

'It’s likely he was taught to say it. A Golden Core cultivator whose lineage is close to the Valley and Pristine Waters might not be incapable of thinking of this method. But this affair isn't just about *thinking* of it. One must be able to produce a true Gold-seeking method for it to be reality.'

'And this Gold-seeking method is anything but simple. Forget all the ancient orthodox techniques, whether they seek Gold through the Five Elements or through Void and Reality—they are all useless here. This must be a method tailor-made specifically for me. Moreover, for such a fantastical, practically impossible Gold-seeking method, the difficulty of creating it is even greater than proving the Dao myself...'

It was the series of statements from the Zhengao that had given him sufficient confidence to believe it. He suppressed the surging joy and anxiety in his heart, returning to his usual calm.

'I still haven't received the Gold-seeking method, so some doubt remains. I'll continue hunting beasts for now. Since I have nothing I can cultivate at the moment, it's the perfect time to hunt these creatures... I must first get that cultivation art and see it for myself...'

His mood lifted considerably. He rode the wind and burst forth from the sea. He felt the world open up and the sea breeze refresh him. Lifting his gaze, he saw the stars shining brightly in the sky.

"One must always plan ahead. I need to make a trip to the World Navel, visit the various Dao lineages, leave a good impression on that Lady, and read more of the Valley Water Daoist scriptures."

The Sea Cape.

The island baked under a scorching sun. The air over the sea held not a trace of moisture, carrying instead an oppressive, stuffy heat. The sky was a spotless, cloudless blue, baking the island's crops until they withered.

A man sat on a large boulder by the sea. He wore white-gold Daoist robes, and a celestial light flashed between his brows as he gazed quietly into the sky.

Li Ximing had returned from hunting beasts and refined the Essence Gathering Pill. He had sent Xia Shouyu into seclusion while he did the same here at the Sea Cape. In three years, he had consumed two Profound Adamant Essence Gathering Pills and cultivated diligently, successfully suppressing all the flames within his Great Juque Court.

Now, his injuries were ninety percent healed. The remaining damage was merely superficial harm to his Dharma Body from the battle's flames. He just needed to find some time to patch it up, and returning to his peak state would be effortless.

Of the seven Profound Adamant Essence Gathering Pills, exactly one remained. Li Ximing tucked it away safely for emergencies.

'If I weren't an alchemist myself, I'd still be trapped in that cursed place, laying low. I might have even had to face that treacherous old bastard again in the future. This last pill is a perfect reserve. If I'm truly struck by that technique again, this can still save the day.'

With his injuries mostly treated and Xia Shouyu successfully breaking through to Foundation Establishment, Li Ximing planned to leave the Sea Cape and head for the Peacock Sea.

'The "Blazing Fire" Immortal Foundation is forged. Rain clouds scatter, and cold turns to heat. It truly is just as the books described.'

Li Ximing's insight was no longer shallow. Since the 'White Li Heart' was 'Blazing Fire' and also utilized 'Li,' it was almost certainly inseparable from the Luan Sparrow. Luan Sparrows command fire and revere 'Blazing Fire' as supreme. The 'White Li Heart' technique should not be weak.

His timing was precise. He waited only two breaths before a bright light shot up from the temple on the island. Reddish flames soared into the sky, accompanied by the faint, bright, and pleasant cry of a bird.

The chirping drew closer as the white-and-red flames sped toward him, resolving into the form of a beautiful woman. Her face was faintly flushed, her eyebrows thin and high. Bearing a smile, she respectfully knelt before him.

"Shouyu greets the Daoist Master! I was fortunate to not fail my mission. I have now forged my Dao Foundation and have not wasted the Daoist Master's precious pill..."

Li Ximing smiled and nodded, extending a hand to lift her up.

"It was not entirely the pill's doing," he said. "To cultivate in this desolate land and reach Qi Refining so early already proves you are a rare genius. Your ability to meet me is also a sign of your deep fortune."

Xia Shouyu nodded repeatedly as Li Ximing continued, "Let's go look around the temple. Once you have your affairs in order, we will set off."

These words sent a thrill of excitement through Xia Shouyu. She immediately bowed deeply and replied, "Your Excellency's grace... this lowly one will carve it into my heart and never forget!"

She knew full well that the Sea Cape was separated from the Peacock Sea, at the very edge of the Eastern Sea, by countless stretches of mortal ocean. Even though she was now at Foundation Establishment, she had no idea how many years or months it would take her to fly across it herself. Worse, once she reached the coast, the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain might ignore her, but the peacocks certainly wouldn't spare her.

Staying at the Sea Cape meant she could be a local tyrant, but her cultivation would stagnate until she died. The distance separating her from the wealthy Inner Sea and the Heaven-Merging Sea was unimaginable... And now, standing before her was a Purple Mansion cultivator. She had found a stable backer!

Li Ximing had already started walking. Master and servant arrived before the monastery to find the grounds covered in kneeling people. Li Ximing did not enter, merely stating casually:

"Handle it all."

Xia Shouyu immediately bowed and stepped inside. She was met by a thunderous chorus of "Your Excellency" and "Gracious Matriarch." There were sounds of old men weeping with joy, middle-aged men begging bitterly for mercy, and soon, inexplicable cries of people trying to make her stay. Only fifteen minutes passed before the chicken-and-dog chaos subsided. Xia Shouyu walked out quickly and reported respectfully:

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, the temple's affairs are all settled. When this lowly one broke through, it caused a three-month drought that harmed the populace. I have already left the resources the Daoist Master granted with the temple, instructing them to send people to purchase rice and compensate the commoners."

Xia Shouyu had clearly already perceived Li Ximing’s stance. This action was both a probing stone and a final bit of compensation for her own temple. Li Ximing noted it and nodded slightly. The two mounted a ray of celestial light and soared toward the horizon.

Xia Shouyu remained in a kneeling posture on the light, peering faintly through the illusory glow at the crowds still kowtowing on the ground below. Her heart was filled with complex emotions, but a pool of inky blackness swiftly spread, and the world went dark.

"Great Void!"

As they traversed the Great Void, Li Ximing spoke.

"You did well. I cultivate in Jiangnan and hail from an Immortal Clan; I am part of the renowned orthodox path. Your mind is sharp, but when you arrive at the clan, you must cast aside the temperament and methods you learned in the Outer Seas."

Xia Shouyu let out a breath of relief and nodded respectfully. Li Ximing casually retrieved an outer robe painted with a moon-lake pattern from his storage bag, tossing it along with a pair of silver boots into her hands.

"We are going to meet a guest," he ordered.

Xia Shouyu's current attire was a mismatched, unpresentable mess. While this outer robe wasn't a formal Dharma Robe, it was made of soft, expensive spirit cloth and matched the boots perfectly. Draping it on would cover her shortcomings. The moment Xia Shouyu touched it, she loved it.

'Tsk, tsk, this material... this spiritual qi... This must be authentic Jiangnan goods.'

She draped it over herself, admiring it silently, careful not to disturb him further. Li Ximing, meanwhile, continued to travel through the Great Void, pondering his plan:

"A visit to the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain is in order. The Dantai family is a good friend of Si Boxiu, and he was the first person I visited back then. My current relationship with the Si family is also amicable, and he is closely connected to the Inner Sea, making him the most accurate source for information. It is worth a visit."

He finalized his itinerary. After traversing the Great Void for a short while, he broke through the void and reappeared. The seawater below was a mix of bronze-green and rainbow-red; they had clearly arrived at the Peacock Sea.

Xia Shouyu, not understanding the principles of Great Void travel, was struck dumb by the speed. Li Ximing, however, frowned. Seeing flocks of peacocks crisscrossing the sky, he immediately concealed their forms.

"Why is this flock of peacocks going insane... searching everywhere like their mothers just died..."

He ducked back into the Great Void. Although he didn't know the precise location of the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain, he simply flew toward the most perilous-looking place within the Great Void and emerged back into the world. Sure enough, a majestic mountain range materialized from the sea, appearing even more imposing amidst the churning waves.

The entire mountain range was a deep purple-red, covered in maple trees that were a rare sight in the Outer Seas, their leaves rising and falling like waves in the sea breeze. Li Ximing swept his gaze over it and materialized at the foot of the mountain.

He found himself before a massive, pure-white mountain gate archway that stood well over a hundred zhang tall.

The right pillar bore large, magnificent characters:

【Great Wonder Merging Truth Path】

The left pillar read:

【Spirit-Pacifying Moon-Clear Mountain】

Li Ximing glanced at the center beam, which read:

【Supreme Mound Nine Daos】

Just as the various families recognized the Li family as part of the Wei-Li Dao Lineage and thus targeted them with the Xiqi Daos, all Dao lineages traced their origins as far back as they could. These names held great significance. Li Ximing committed them to memory.

Immediately, a cultivator flew out from the mountain. He looked startled but remained respectful, bowing.

"Greetings, Daoist Master. This lowly cultivator is Dantai Muming of the Nine Mounds Dao Lineage. We were unaware of Your Immortal Carriage’s arrival and failed to provide a proper welcome. Please, enter the mountain to rest."

Li Ximing had heard at both the Sea Cape and here in the Peacock Sea that the master of Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain was exceptionally hospitable and had many friends. This Dantai Muming clearly had seen his share of the world; his reception was practiced and natural. His surprise likely stemmed only from not recognizing Li Ximing.

Behind him, Xia Shouyu was still reeling from the shock of the majestic mountain and the colossal archway. However, with her Daoist Master backer standing before her, the surge of inferiority was minimal. Instead, she felt a sense of shared glory and stepped forward slightly, trying her best to appear natural and not disgrace Li Ximing.

Li Ximing gave a slight nod. "Is this the cultivation abode of Daoist Master Dantai? I have long heard of your great name. I had a very pleasant discussion with Senior Yuanxiu last time, and he spoke of the Daoist Master's reputation. As I was passing the Peacock Sea and found myself with time to spare, I came for a visit."

Li Ximing did not state his own name, but Dantai Muming was visibly pleased.

"So you are a friend of Daoist Master Yuanxiu! We have truly been remiss... Please, Daoist Master, rest in the pavilion for a moment. I will go and fetch my elder."

Although Li Ximing spoke as if they were familiar, Dantai Muming maintained his vigilance and did not rashly invite him fully into the mountain. He sent someone to make inquiries while apologizing, "A few days ago, the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour from the north suddenly came to cause trouble. Our sect's Great Daoist Master was invited to Great Bestowal Copper Mountain to discuss important matters with the peacocks and cannot return immediately."

"However... our sect's Daoist Master Lingdu is currently in the sect discussing the Dao with Daoist Master Houfu. They have been at it for three months. I will send someone to ask them."

Li Ximing's eyes lit up.

'Daoist Master Houfu is here too!'

Daoist Master Houfu was from the Great Xiukiu Monastery. That monastery acted with considerable righteousness and had no conflicts with the Li Clan; they had even come to congratulate Li Ximing in the past. With him present, Li Ximing felt much more secure about this visit.

Only a few breaths passed before two Daoist Masters were seen treading through the air toward them.

The one in the lead was ancient, leaning on a wooden staff; this had to be Lingdu. The one behind him, dressed in shamanistic robes, was tall and thin. It was indeed Houfu, whom he had met before. When the two arrived, Lingdu looked slightly perplexed.

"Greetings, Your Excellency..."

Li Ximing offered a smile, but Houfu recognized him. He stepped forward, a faint smile pulling at his lips as he spoke.

"Senior Lingdu, this is a Daoist Master from our Jiangnan: Zhaojing."

Daoist Master Houfu didn't often travel in Jiangnan, but when he did, it was always with banging gongs and drums, in a carriage pulled by spirit beasts. The man loved his pageantry, and the Li family had presented him with congratulatory gifts back then. Li Ximing quickly bowed.

"Greetings, Senior Houfu! I never imagined the Daoist Master would be here. This is truly an unexpected joy!"

Houfu was, strictly speaking, a peer of Li Ximing's generation. When Li Ximing elevated his status this way, his smile broadened slightly. "You flatter me... Zhaojing, you are truly formidable!"

Li Ximing understood the implication. Houfu saw that he was in good condition and was tacitly praising him for escaping intact from a late-stage Daoist Master like Changxiao. But Li Ximing knew better than anyone that his survival had involved far too much luck. He smiled and deflected the praise. The elder, Lingdu, however, looked quite shocked. He studied Li Ximing from top to bottom before praising him.

"So it is the Imperial Scion, Zhaojing. This old man is Cao Xiyan of the Nine Mounds Immortal Dao, titled Lingdu. Greetings, Daoist Master."

"I am unworthy of the title 'Imperial Scion'... it is merely a false rumor spread in Jiangnan."

Li Ximing quickly deflected again. Lingdu kept the smile on his face, clearly not believing the denial. He lifted his sleeve and gestured.

"Zhaojing, please..."

The three rode the wind into the mountain interior. A cool breeze rustled past, sending maple leaves drifting through the air. Beneath the largest maple tree sat an ancient bronze chessboard, where black and white pieces were locked in a fierce, entangled struggle, clearly in the middle of an intense game.

Li Ximing felt a pang of nervousness, glancing at the board.

'...I've lived this long and never even touched a chess piece... Please don't ask me to play.'

Fortunately, Lingdu immediately moved the chessboard aside. Houfu stood behind him, hands clasped, and chuckled.

"Zhaojing... you've certainly made Tinglan search hard these past two years! I just asked this old senior. That woman didn't just ask my Great Xiukiu Monastery; she even came asking the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain. She is desperate to find you!"
