# Chapter 778: Chengming's Seclusion

Only then did Li Ximing remember Xia Shouyu. The woman was already so frightened her legs had gone soft. Seeing the dark, vacant look in her pupils, he worried that a little more time would scare her to death, leaving him with no way to find an exit. He forced the blank, white expanse of his face to split open into a mouth and spoke.

"Little friend... you've finally come."

'Which old monster's cave did I break into! I'm finished, finished! A monster like this... it's probably going to steal my body!'

After all, Xia Shouyu knew she had nothing on her person worth coveting. The only thing a high-level cultivator might possibly target was this body of hers. She wasn't afraid of losing her virtue... she was afraid of someone seizing her body for reincarnation!

Xia Shouyu scrambled on the ground, but her legs were too weak to stand. Fortunately, for this woman to have achieved her status in the marketplace, she naturally had some cunning. She spoke, trembling with dread.

"My... Milord... this humble woman is just a wandering cultivator from the Eastern Sea. I have hardly any flesh on my bones, and the Dao I cultivate is nothing special... I've offended your sacred domain by accident. If Milord has any task! Please, just command me... If you need a blood offering... please let this humble woman go out and find one for you."

Li Ximing let out a dry chuckle. "What do you mean, 'by accident'?"

When Xia Shouyu saw that he was clear-headed and wasn't immediately demanding to eat her, she felt a sliver of relief, but the terror remained an indescribable weight. She shivered.

"It... it was this lowly one, blinded by greed, who offended this sacred place..."

Li Ximing casually released his grip on her, and the woman flopped to the ground, kneeling. He corrected her, "You were *fished* over here by my Divine Ability."

'A Divine Ability? A Purple Mansion expert?!'

A chill seeped straight into Xia Shouyu's heart. She stared at the ground in disbelief. Li Ximing still wore that blank face, and she didn't dare use her spiritual sense to probe him. She could only continue to kneel, shrinking in on herself.

"You don't believe me?"

Li Ximing figured she wouldn't. He immediately raised his hand and waved it through the empty air. Xia Shouyu felt an intense heat flare through her limbs as all four were instantly incinerated to ash. With a dull thud, she dropped to the ground like a block of wood.

"Ah?"

Now limbless, Xia Shouyu lay on the ground like a human trunk, staring blankly at the ceiling of the karst cave. Above her, that faceless visage appeared once more. It blew out a breath, split its mouth open, and commanded:

"Grow!"

Xia Shouyu felt an agonizing, itching numbness at her four stumps. As if an old tree were sprouting new buds, her arms and legs burst forth from the charred wounds. The warm sensation of the ground returned beneath her.

She pushed herself up, the world spinning around her. Her newly grown limbs were even paler and more tender than before, and they felt alien to her. She stumbled and fell right back onto her knees, crying out:

"Daoist Master! I believe you... I believe you! This lowly one believes! I will follow all of the Daoist Master's commands!"

Li Ximing laughed. "That's more like it! Your body is like worthless grass to me. This Daoist Master has no interest in your mortal flesh. What matters is the task I am about to give you. If you do it well, I guarantee you will receive boundless benefits!"

Xia Shouyu couldn't possibly guess what he wanted. She could only press her forehead to the ground, awaiting his orders.

"This Daoist Master is here suppressing an object and cannot leave," Li Ximing said. "I have been hungry for a long time and have no nourishing items on hand. I require a demonic beast at the Foundation Establishment level that cultivates Valley Water. It just so happens you broke in. Bring me one demonic beast of the Valley Water virtue, and you will have earned your merit."

"Me?"

Xia Shouyu froze. The woman actually didn't agree immediately just to escape. Instead, she kept her head bowed and replied:

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, this lowly one is all alone, and my cultivation is pitifully shallow... How could I possibly capture a demonic beast for you!"

Seeing her reaction, Li Ximing knew his previous display had earned her belief and awe. He adopted the tone of a Purple Mansion expert of the demonic path and said:

"Fool! I don't care what excuse you use. Say there is a great treasure here, or some spiritual item, whatever it takes. Just lure it to this spot. Once it's here, it won't be able to escape even if it has nine lives!"

"This lowly one understands!"

Xia Shouyu shuddered violently. After a moment, she asked carefully, "Reporting to the Daoist Master... this lowly one knows the territories of a few Demon Generals... The 'Valley Water' you speak of... should be one of the water virtues, but this lowly one has never seen it... I cannot be certain."

'...'

Only then did Li Ximing remember that, given the barrenness of the region, the knowledge and experience of these cultivators were probably lagging by leagues. He had no choice but to explain.

"The creek and valley are low and receptive, thus they are 'valley.' Valley Water is the water of the gully. It lies in what is stored but not yet released. In the heavens, the rain clouds are the valley, thus it is cloud water. In humans, the belly's storage is the valley, thus it is amniotic fluid. It is all manner of nourishing water that is gestating and unreleased."

'What in the world... how am I, a Qi Refining cultivator, supposed to understand a Purple Mansion expert lecturing on the Dao.'

Xia Shouyu cried out, "This lowly one does not understand..."

Li Ximing's blank face darkened. "Just go find the Demon General who is the best at healing!" he barked.

"Right away!"

*This* Xia Shouyu understood. She nodded repeatedly. Just as she was about to get up, Li Ximing commanded:

"Wait!"

He reached out a hand and tapped the woman lightly on her pale forehead. The power of a Divine Ability poured down, flowing all the way into her Juque Palace, which she herself could not see, and transformed into a wisp of purple fire that entered within.

"I can't just let you walk away so easily," he said. "I have planted a Divine Ability inside your body. If you dare to flee, this ability will detonate and kill you... This is the far reaches of the sea, and no one you beg for help can dispel it!"

Xia Shouyu was not surprised. The other party wasn't running a charity. It was perfectly normal for a mighty Purple Mansion expert to plant some safeguards. She immediately dropped back to her knees, performing a hand seal and placing her hands over her precious sea of Qi, swearing an oath.

"This lowly one has received this great kindness and will wager my life to accomplish Milord's task! If I violate this oath, may lightning strike me from above, may my Profound Core shatter, and may my path of cultivation be severed forever!"

'Lightning strike her? This truly is the backwater... the Thunder Palaces have already been dismantled, yet they still add that line to their spiritual oaths.'

Li Ximing was reasonably confident in her. He just said, "Be careful! If anyone dares to perform a soul search on you, this purple fire will explode, and you will all die... If this matter is successful, I will reward you with an Essence Gathering Pill and guarantee your path to Foundation Establishment!"

'An Essence Gathering Pill?... Could that be... the Foundation Establishment Pill?'

Although Xia Shouyu didn't know what an Essence Gathering Pill was, she certainly understood what "guarantee your path to Foundation Establishment" meant. She nodded repeatedly and backed away, flying up out of the fire and exiting the hot spring. The cold sweat that had been plastering her back finally stopped.

The night wind whipped past, making her legs feel weak. Xia Shouyu lifted her sleeve, looking at the distinct marks on her shoulder and her unnaturally pale new forearm. She felt as if she had just passed through a lifetime.

"Is this a fateful opportunity... or a path to certain death?"

...

Moongaze Lake.

Thunder rumbled low on the horizon, and rain began to fall across the island. Water vapor rose from everywhere, and a stillness fell over the land. The great hall was draped in white. Figures hurried to and fro, yet the only sounds were the drip of the rain and the shuffle of footsteps.

No one in the hall spoke. They waited until the storm swept in from the north, blurring the world into a vast sheet of rain. Only then did a streak of light weave through the downpour and land before the hall, resolving into a woman with a jade pendant at her waist. Her features were unremarkable, but she possessed a clear, sharp aura.

"Lady Xinghan!"

The cultivators on both sides bowed to her. Li Xinghan gave them a hurried nod and strode up the steps into the main hall. There, she saw Li Jiangqian descending from the upper level, dressed in white mourning robes. This First Young Master, who was acting as the family head, lowered his brows and spoke.

"Aunt, you've arrived. I was just about to send for you. I received word from Uncle Zhouluo that two more of our elders from the Zhou-generation met misfortune in Funan to the north. Their families have sent someone to collect the subsidy. I cannot make a decision on this matter; it requires an elder's approval."

Li Xinghan had been dispatched to the eastern shore to defend against cultivators from the Capital immortals Dao. But while the mission was called "defending against the Capital immortals Dao," this time it was more about dealing with demonic cultivators who had come to plunder amidst the chaos. Her sword had claimed several lives. She had seen blood since she was young and still felt it wasn't enough.

Having rushed back from the eastern shore, she now felt a pang of sadness at this news. "Which brothers and sisters were they?"

Li Jiangqian replied, "One was Uncle Zhouken from the Second Branch, early-stage Qi Refining. The other was Aunt Xingsai from the First Branch, peak Embyronic Breathing."

Li Xinghan knew both of them. Li Zhouken's innate talent had even been considered decent, and he had visited the main island in the past. Hearing this, a sour grief welled up in her heart.

"The family always insists on sending direct lineage clan members out, treating them the same as any common retainer. They are prioritized for border assignments and slaughter grounds... It is meant for training, a good intention, but unfortunately, when something like this happens, their lives are cut short."

Li Xinghan had practiced the sword since childhood and had never encountered this sort of administrative affair. She was perfectly efficient at killing people or demons, but organizing funeral matters left her at a loss. She felt a bit helpless.

"Where are the two senior elders?" she asked, referring to Li Minggong and Li Chenghuai.

Upon this question, Li Jiangqian said, "Great-Aunt Minggong and Great-Uncle Chenghuai have both entered seclusion to heal their wounds. Guest Elder Miaoshui and Elder White Ape are doing the same. Lord Cui is out searching for Protector Ding. Only Qu Bushi, Li Wen, and An Siwei are on the lake."

He paused, then added, "And Protector Chen Yang."

Strictly speaking, Chen Yang was Madam Chen's elder brother, and the biological uncle of his own second brother, Li Jianglong. His breakthrough had undoubtedly allowed the Chen Clan members on the lake to stand a little taller. The Chen Clan and the Li Clan were joined by blood, so Li Jiangqian should have been happy, but he seemed to lack any enthusiasm for the topic.

"Still no sign of Guest Elder Ding?"

Worry filled Li Xinghan's heart. Ding Weizeng's combat power was absolutely top-tier, and he had always been loyal to the family. For him to be missing for several months was deeply unsettling.

After hearing his report, she replied, "We should still gather all the brothers and sisters for a proper discussion. The family has reached this state, and we have all lost our guiding pillar. If we don't work together now, it will be a dereliction of our duty."

Li Jiangqian nodded at once and sent someone to relay the summons. "Reporting to Aunt, I must also enter seclusion soon. Although there is one last Dharma Art I haven't mastered... the matter of Foundation Establishment can no longer be delayed."

He cultivated the sixth-grade Scripture of Heavenly Radiance and the Waning Sun. He had recently mastered the movement art Tread on Flames, the accompanying escape art Heavenly Fire's Crimson Shine, and the now-famous Sun's Resonant Radiance Art. The unmastered technique he spoke of was the sixth-grade Dharma Art, Great Radiance of White Brilliance. This art required Purple Mansion-level Radiant Fire, and there was no longer any hope of waiting for that.

Li Xinghan didn't know the details, but she nodded in response, a touch of envy in her eyes. Although she was a generation above him, she was still only at the fifth level of Qi Refining.

After a short wait, a man in black, pleated robes entered the hall. He wore a sword at his waist, his body radiating a sharp, metallic aura. He was clearly in a hurry. His cultivation had already reached the seventh level of Qi Refining.

Li Xinghan nodded. "Brother!"

Li Zhouluo responded. He had recently been in charge of Mount Qingdu and had reached the point of needing to stabilize his cultivation and practice his arts. The affairs on the lake had become increasingly numerous and hectic. Only now, sitting in the hall, did he finally have a moment to rest.

They waited a while longer, and the eldest brothers, Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang, arrived at the hall. The two brothers looked like they’d been carved from the same mold. They always went wherever they were needed and never spoke much. They offered a simple greeting and stood off to the side. Li Jiangqian immediately excused himself and withdrew.

The Zhou generation was not known for producing great talents; these few were already considered their leaders. Li Zhouluo was just about to speak when he heard the thunder and rain raging outside. A person landed before the hall, shook the rain from his robes, pushed the door open, and entered with a laugh.

"Brothers, it's rare to see you all!"

This man wore a golden lock that swayed and tinkled around his neck. His face was rather handsome, and he wore white robes, clutching a fan painted with birds, fish, and insects.

Li Zhouluo looked slightly awkward, though his expression remained mostly normal. He took a step forward to greet him. "Fifth Brother, you've come. We don't usually see you on the island. What a coincidence you're here today."

Li Xinghan glanced over. The newcomer was none other than the Daoist Master's direct grandson, Li Zhouming. His early-stage Qi Refining cultivation was the lowest among them all. Li Xinghan had almost never seen him. She gave a slight bow and replied, "Today I finally have the chance to meet Fifth Brother."

Li Zhouming smiled, bowing left and right. He hitched up his robes, stepped into the courtyard, and snapped his fan shut in his palm. "Same here. A while back, I ran afoul of the Old Master and got a fierce tongue-lashing. He told me to turn over a new leaf and start acting decent. So, I had no choice but to come over to the island to take a look... and listen to what's going on."

"Good."

Li Zhouluo accepted this. He held the highest post among the brothers present. With Li Zhouwei absent, it was natural that he would lead. He lowered his voice.

"That child Jiangqian needs to enter seclusion for Foundation Establishment, which means someone needs to manage the island's affairs. Jiangxia and Jianglong are both good kids, but they each hold important positions. Placing either of them in charge of the island would show favoritism... I asked the Old Master, and he said the choice should come from the Zhou-generation... What do my younger brothers and sister think?"

As soon as Li Zhouluo finished speaking, Li Zhouming tucked his fan away and grinned. "Well, naturally, Brother, you have the most prestige! Just let Brother manage the family affairs. There's nothing more to say! Nothing at all!"

He tapped the fan against his robes. The brothers Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang remained silent as always. Li Xinghan also just held her sword, saying nothing. Seeing this scene, Li Zhouming just said, "So that settles it? I thought it was some big crisis."

Li Xinghan finally couldn't hold back. She spoke up, "Brother... when the Old Master said the choice should come from the Zhou-generation, did he mean we are choosing one of the *young masters*, or choosing one of *us* from the Zhou-generation?"

Li Zhouluo, who was the most handsome of the group, replied in a clear voice, "The Old Master was afraid the young masters would be dissatisfied. He is hoping to pick from among us brothers. After all, it is only to manage things temporarily for a few years..."

Only then did Li Xinghan find the will to nod. Although she was often away, she was aware of her brother's political achievements. At present, there was truly no other candidate besides him. She hesitated, thinking:

'The Youngest Branch has never had a precedent of managing the family affairs... Do the two Foundation Establishment elders know about this? If this was the Old Master's order, it's no different than directly appointing Fourth Brother to take charge...'
