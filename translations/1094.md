# Chapter 1094: Origin Heart

Li Zhouwei did not know the full implications of the "opportunity" the man spoke of. He pondered for a moment, then focused on the crucial point and asked,

"This favor from the Heavenly Element... what form does it take? What level must one's divine ability reach, what kind of mysteries must one possess, to see these 'favors' clearly? I only fear that this junior might be harmed by others!"

It was an extremely sharp question. Qingyu Qian fell silent, mulling it over for a long while.

Ostensibly, Li Zhouwei was asking about the manifestation of the Heavenly Element. But how could the mysteries of Rank Designation be fathomed by a cultivator below the True Monarch realm? Li Zhouwei was asking a question to which he already knew the answer. His first objective was to make Qingyu Qian personally deny any possibility that he had used some Heaven–Governing Daoist treasure to sense Li Suining. He wanted the fox-kin to admit that there was, indeed, a powerful figure backing him.

As such, the words that reached the fox Demon's ears carried a different meaning entirely.

'This matter with Li Suining and Liu Changdie being favored by the Heavenly Element... was it your backer who told you?'

And the deeper, potential meaning was even more pointed.

'If so, has this great person of yours been staring intently at my Li clan for the past hundred years? You, Qingyu Qian, possess the Celestial-Awakening Ear—what role, exactly, are you playing in all this?'

Qingyu Qian knew how deeply his Celestial-Awakening Ear was feared. Even in the ancient era, brimming with experts, this one divine ability was regarded as a terrifying and insidious Daoist art. The user themselves might not fear it, but whose family, whose juniors, didn't need to pass on secret arts or whispered inheritances? A single moment of carelessness, and one's weaknesses, flaws, or perhaps a vital technique, could fall straight into an enemy's ears.

The oppressive nature of the world was even greater now. To the Li clan, the Celestial-Awakening Ear was a dreadful threat. Simply using 'secluded cultivation' as an excuse years ago had not been enough to satisfy the White Qilin. If the fox-kin truly wanted to cooperate with the Li clan, this issue had to be resolved.

He paused, then said in an explanatory tone,

"Those favored by the Heavenly Element possess a natural ability to conceal themselves. It isn't simply that they are difficult to calculate. They are 'unclear,' existing 'outside of calculation.' It doesn't matter how high your divine ability is; you cannot even detect an anomaly."

"As for Liu Changdie, I don't know which faction handled his case. But the situation at the time was tense. The great figures had one consensus, that is, as long as the Jade True situation was unresolved, Anhuai and Wanling could not be breached. Yet, none of them trusted each other. No one was at ease placing him in another's hands, but they couldn't eliminate him either... After all, no one knew the true situation within Wanling Heaven, and keeping him alive was useful. Thus, they pushed him into the Vault Metal."

"The Vault Metal is a place to 'suspend and hide, not to be used.' In the eyes of those great figures, it was equivalent to locking him away in a treasure vault."

As he spoke of this, his expression was not calm. It was less complex than it was filled with a trace of hatred. His tone remained flat.

"But even this solution had a problem."

Qingyu Qian said softly,

"Now, the Book of Elements has fallen into the Exiled Qi. Obscured and entangled, it can no longer influence the present world. But that wasn't the case back then. The Book of Elements was still in Wanling. How much power did it have? What was its situation? No one knew. The Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book could use one piece to move a hundred pieces across the world. The most critical task was to sever Liu Changdie's connection to it!"

"What those great figures wanted was the key. They wanted the Encompassing Profoundity treasures he unlocked while roaming the world. They had no intention of truly letting the Book of Elements place its pawns everywhere."

"Therefore, they needed something powerful enough to contend with the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book, something that could completely sever Liu Changdie from it without transferring the karmic consequences onto themselves."

"And so, Liu Changdie was brought to Moongaze Lake. The treasure there was the only suitable one. It was suitable to a point of absolute perfection."

Li Zhouwei's eyebrows twitched, his eyes narrowing. An answer surfaced in his mind, but it was shrouded in doubt. He listened as Qingyu Qian continued,

"The only thing that can contend with the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book is another treasure—the Azure Insight Origin Mirror from Mount Dali!"

Li Zhouwei's breath caught. His mind raced as he asked,

"An Immortal Artifact?"

"An Immortal Artifact."

Qingyu Qian closed his eyes slightly, a chill entering his voice.

"This item causes diviners to miscalculate and observers to fail in their observation. It is indescribably precious. Even the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book could not calculate its existence, let alone through the barrier of a grotto-heaven... so it couldn't have been a deliberate plot to bring him to the lake. Nothing was more suitable. Liu Changdie made one trip to the lake, and from then on, his divinatory light vanished, and his chaotic fate was severed. Though he retained his ability to know the future, he had already fallen to a lower path. Not only was his connection to the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book broken, but even the lingering favor upon him disappeared."

"After being observed by so many great powers, his fate had become too 'heavy.' Without the favor to obscure him, he looked like a monster to those with powerful divine abilities. Purple Mansion Realm cultivators couldn't even divine what kind of being he was. It was only from this point on that he became someone whose abnormality could be easily detected by the Purple Mansion Realm. He moved to Jiangnan, and that's when he stumbled into the grand game of Golden Feather and Azure Pond. Xiao Chuting, Chi Buzi, and Zhang Qiushui were likely the first in the Purple Mansion Realm to know."

"After all, in the eyes of the Purple Mansion Realm, being 'incalculable' is, itself, the biggest problem."

Understanding dawned on Li Zhouwei instantly.

"That's it... That's why our divine abilities can't see the strangeness in Suining, but Liu Changdie was infamous among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators back then!"

Qingyu Qian nodded in acknowledgment, offering a slight apology.

"The timing was wrong that day, so I did not explain in detail to the Great King. In truth, with the Azure Insight Origin Mirror at the Northern Foothills of Mount Dali, I am ignorant of almost everything that happens in the southern half of Moongaze Lake. Besides you, no one in this world knows what truly goes on there!"

"The immortal might of the Azure Insight Origin Mirror is so profound that even the Martial Cultivation Star cannot pass, and the Profound Light does not descend. If any of those Holders of the Profound from the Great Song were to come to Moongaze Lake and stray even slightly south, their cultivation would be immediately beaten down and stripped away!"

His words carried a hint of emotion. Li Zhouwei set down his jade cup.

"So that was the real reason..."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, puzzled. He asked again,

"The Azure Insight Origin Mirror belongs to you, senior. How can you not see through it?"

Qingyu Qian was silent for a breath before replying:

"That is a relic left by the Immortal Mansion. Even my lord is forbidden from touching it. We are merely guarded and trapped on this lake by its protection. How could a minor Demon like me ever hope to?"

That one sentence clarified everything.

Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze and sipped his wine.

'The 'great person' behind Qingyu Qian is likely someone from the Immortal Mansion, but not a figure at the very top. Perhaps their status is insufficient, or their cultivation isn't high enough. Their control over this Immortal Artifact is limited. They might even be in an compromised state, which is why they are 'trapped' on the lake.'

'The 'great person' Chi Buzi is so obsessed with is probably this one... but which Dao lineage are they from? Heaven–Governing? The Three Yin? Water Mansion?'

He remembered that when Chi Buzi traveled to the Eastern Sea years ago, he had met Li Qinghong. Mistaking her for one of the fox-kin, he had passed on a message, and in it, he had mentioned three names.

'She Immortals, Water Mansion, Yingze... The last two are understandable, but why is there a Sheji Immortal?'

He fell silent, his mind racing, but he finally felt a sense of calm. The thick, ever-present fog of danger that had loomed over him at last receded.

'The words of that Yang entity were not false. It truly does not know the specific situation on the lake. That's why it doesn't know my family actually has four lines of immortal cultivation!'

His heart settled. He remained quiet for a long time, though he didn't fully believe Qingyu Qian's claim of complete ignorance.

'The great powers cannot probe, and the Purple Mansion Realm cannot calculate. But cultivators below Golden Core can still see with their own eyes! Other factions might be afraid of provoking the fox-kin's backer and wouldn't dare send people brazenly. But Qingyu Qian himself cannot be as ignorant as he claims. He must have known something was different at the base of the mountain. That's why he sent Bai Rong out!'

'What could it have been...'

His mind grew clear. His own Immortal Mirror was constantly scanning. Since Qingyu Qian knew a 'great person's' arrangement was down there, he likely wouldn't have come personally. Something abnormal must have alarmed him...

Li Zhouwei thought it through, gradually connecting the pieces.

'The Supreme Yin Profound Light? The wolf Demon from the clan history... or something even earlier?'

As Li Zhouwei sank into thought, Qingyu Qian was observing him. The fox Demon king anxiously fiddled with the jade cup in front of him and continued,

"As for this Li... Suining. His matter is also different. Now that Wanling Heaven has fallen into the Exiled Qi, the Heaven–Governing Rank Designation has shifted. The 'favor' fell directly onto the lake. My lord has some Dao-Profundity in the Heaven–Governing Dao and saw certain omens, which is how we came to understand."

"This junior understands!" Li Zhouwei stood up, clasped his hands in a salute, and said, "Many thanks, Senior!"

Qingyu Qian shook his head with a wry smile.

"I wouldn't dare call myself senior. I simply owed the Great King an explanation."

His expression turned serious.

"The year it was confirmed that the Great King intended to walk the Bright Yang path, the mountain began to consider its options. Then, seeing you bring an invitation from the Dragon-kin, we knew your inclinations lay with the dragons. It just so happened that Dongfang You died. We used 'building relations' as a pretext to send Bai Rong over. Our true intention was to join you in the Bright Yang endeavor!"

"At that time, it was the Dragon Monarch's birth anniversary."

Qingyu Qian's expression was grave.

"The birth anniversary of the Dragon Monarch Beijia. It wasn't just about borrowing his position. It was his birth anniversary, but it was also the birth anniversary of the other eight Dragon Monarchs. More importantly, it was the day the Great Sage fell. The seas were in chaos. Only then did such an opportunity arise."

"The Dragon-kin are faithless and treacherous. Although they agreed, how they would ultimately arrange things was never certain... But at least they produced the Pure Yang Bracelets, which showed their attitude."

'So that's how it was...'

Now that Li Zhouwei understood Qingyu Qian's position, a bit more trust was established. He began to scheme.

'Chi Buzi was possessed so silently. If he wants to ally with my family, he must do so under the guise of allying with the fox-kin. He is at the Chunyi Dao Gate, and his repeated probing has already put him at odds with the Dragon-kin. I must help him.'

He looked up.

"Does the Demon King know... of Chi Buzi?"

Qingyu Qian tensed, immediately adopting a solemn, attentive posture.

"How could I not..."

Li Zhouwei said intently,

"I believe he has intentions of turning to your great person."

Qingyu Qian was momentarily stunned but had little time to think. He seemed to commit the words to memory, nodding heavily.

"I understand!"

Li Zhouwei sensed the underlying meaning and silently lowered his gaze. Qingyu Qian, however, stood up and said softly:

"Suining cultivates... the Divine Sequence?"

Li Zhouwei nodded. He saw a flash of regret on Qingyu Qian's face, who muttered,

"If only it were two hundred years earlier... if only... things would have been much simpler!"

His expression was bitter.

"My fox-kin know of this art. It is from the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence, a treasure of Wanling Heaven. For it to appear now means it has truly emerged into the world. It must have fallen into the Great King's hands at just the right time. That is well... at least it was not lost."

Li Zhouwei's expression didn't change, but his mind stirred. He asked,

"Was it written by a cultivator from Wanling Heaven, or is it an inheritance from ancient cultivators?"

Qingyu Qian smiled.

"A cultivation art like this is naturally not something a Wanling Heaven cultivator could write. It originates from the ancient Encompassing Profoundity Taiyuan Court's 'Heaven-Governing Sequence Classic.' It was likely completed around the time of the Wei dynasty. It is an extremely profound art!"

Li Zhouwei's mind worked fast, seizing the opening. This item didn't come from Wanling Heaven at all; it came from the High Firmament Pavilion! If he could clarify these two points, it would be immensely helpful in determining when the Immortal Mirror was damaged.

His immediate line of inquiry had been blocked, but he wasn't disappointed. 

"Does senior have any insights?"

Qingyu Qian replied, "This art originates from the Taiyuan Court's method of grotto-heaven ascension. However, this is not the original, but rather a technique derived by a later person who observed that ascension method..."

The Demon King smiled, and the white mist around him swirled.

"I see you brought him here today because you wish to trade with me for a method of Great Void construction!"

The 'method of Great Void construction' he spoke of was precisely a method for creating a grotto-heaven mystic realm!

The fox Demon smiled, but his eyes held a complex mix of emotions.

"Trading the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence for it is a perfect exchange. It will complete a missing part of my mountain's Dao lineage!"

Li Zhouwei nodded slightly.

He was not unaware of this matter. Li Ximing had even visited the High Firmament Pavilion to investigate. The price for these grotto-heaven creation methods... the required immortal merits were astonishingly high!

The most expensive one was called 'Liangzhi's Secret Essentials of Heaven and Earth,' and it cost a staggering 1,716,800 immortal merits! You could slaughter the entire Seven Aspects of the Great Zhao seventy or eighty times over and still not have enough to trade for it!

Even the cheapest one, the 'Void-Chamber Refining Art,' required over 1,100 immortal merits, more than five times the cost of the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence. You'd have to wipe out all the Buddhists and devils in Jiangbei to afford it.

Because of this, Li Zhouwei understood the value of a Great Void creation method. He was somewhat stunned to hear the offer and paused before replying:

"That is far too precious."

Qingyu Qian shook his head and sighed.

"Not at all... I only fear the Great King will look down on the method I possess! I did not wish to offer it in shame, but this particular art was passed down by my lord personally and has ties to the Heaven–Governing Dao. That is the only reason I mention it..."

His gaze lowered as he sighed inwardly.

'Is this an exchange... or a repayment? It's hard to tell anymore.'

Li Zhouwei, however, lowered his gaze, his thoughts running deeper.

'This is actually an excellent thing. These Great Void construction methods were all accounted for in ancient times. In the eyes of those great figures, they are clearly mapped to specific Daoist traditions, unlike these latter-day Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivation arts, which are as numerous as the stars...'

'Furthermore, a grotto-heaven must be 'hung' up. It needs to be opened, closed, and communicate with the present world. It would be best to register it under the fox-kin's name. That would add a layer of security...'

Thus, Li Zhouwei did not stand on ceremony.

"My family is in great need of this. We accept our lord's generous gift with thanks!"

Qingyu Qian let out a soft laugh and stood up, smiling.

"I will have someone deliver it at once!"
