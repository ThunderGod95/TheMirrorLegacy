# Chapter 1261: Yu and Yang

Ruzhou.

City after city lay arrayed upon the ground, their lights twinkling, but the sky above blazed with a radiance that surged toward the heavens, a golden light that seemed as if it would cover the entire firmament, falling toward the earth with a cold, sharp gleam.

A man in white robes stood suspended in the void, holding a small umbrella. He floated in mid-air with a gloomy gaze, and said faintly,

"Fellow Daoists… my previous offer still stands. Will you truly not consider it?"

Before him, an intense aquatic light converged, swirling in the air to form patches of dark, cloud-like mist. An old man's voice could be faintly heard from within, his tone steady:

"The younger generation is truly formidable. Daoist Master Changyun, your skills are quite impressive."

He paused for just a moment, yet there was not a trace of urgency in his voice as he continued,

"However, taking me down will be no easy feat."

The man holding the umbrella watched him with an unwavering, gloomy gaze, well aware that his words were not wrong—Yu Xi was an old cultivator who had been at the middle stage of the Purple Mansion Realm for many years, and he had cultivated three Valley Water divine abilities!

The man was ancient, and his ability to remain active to this day had much to do with his Dao! Valley Water was famous for enabling escape and concealment; no matter how powerful he, Changyun, was, he could not be certain of easily defeating such an old Daoist Master.

'I'm afraid… even if a Great Daoist Master were here, unless they were on the level of Wei Xuanyin, they couldn't guarantee that they could keep him here!'

This displeased Changyun greatly, and his heart even filled with confusion.

'What is the point of this!'

In Changyun's opinion, Yu Xi should have been the one in all of Luoxia most inclined to side with the Great Song. After all, he was old and had no successors. The light of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead had already flashed and now there was no activity, meaning Xiangxiang was surely lost. Anyone could see that this was a premeditated strike against an unprepared foe; the Great Song clearly had the advantage!

The radiance of Martial Cultivation was a rare opportunity, so why be so stubborn with him?

The Yu and Yang families were both present here, and the Daoist Master of the Yang clan was clearly hesitating, not using her full strength; but because Yu Xi refused to be swayed, she dared not be the first to surrender!

He had, after all, come here with a few reservations.

'The battle at Baixiang Valley back then injured the White Qilin, and I had no opportunity to get closer to him afterward. That shameless Yehui changes his tune faster than flipping through a book, and he actually managed to get on good terms with the Lake!'

For one, he, Changyun, still had his own ambitions; for another, he bore a mission. Although the Li clan was nothing to write home about, their standing policy was to maintain good relations with Li Zhouwei for at least the next few decades!

He also understood why Li Zhouwei had chosen him; he was eager to achieve merit. But if Yu Xi decided to get serious, he could hold out against Li Zhouwei himself a hundred times over, let alone Changyun.

Thus, Changyun had intended from the start to use both threats and inducements, but this old codger refused to play by the rules, insisting on fighting him to the bitter end. This brought a shadow to Changyun's eyes as he said faintly,

"The old Daoist Master is skilled, but she might not be."

As soon as he spoke, his form dissolved into feathers of light. Beneath the gloomy, misty rain, a patch of shadow-light could be vaguely seen. A divine ability flared in panic, and then a golden qi suddenly blasted down, striking the dark clouds and forcing them to fall, revealing a woman.

The woman wore a green skirt with profound patterns and stood upon roiling white qi. Her figure was petite, and her expression was a mixture of beauty and pity. In her hand, she held a green-bladed sword, but she cut a rather sorry figure.

It was none other than the Daoist Master of the Yang clan—Yang Xuancai.

She only had a single divine ability and had merely been providing support in this battle. During the fight, she had been struck by two of Changyun's divine abilities and knew how powerful he was. Seeing him manifest with such a menacing aura, her heart skipped a beat. As she collided with the brilliant golden qi, she immediately formed an incantation seal and cast a spell, a colorful light manifesting between her brows.

Lone Magpie Wind-Riding Escape Art!

In an instant, the woman's figure transformed into a gust of turquoise spring wind and drifted away, but the golden qi in the sky relentlessly entangled it, pressing its advantage before cleaving down from the void!

Changyun cultivated Geng Metal, the bane of spring wood!

Previously, the Daoist Master had been testing her willingness to surrender to the Song, so his attacks had not been ruthless. Once he made up his mind, however, his moves became exceedingly fast and his divine ability grew a good deal stronger, striking the woman down in an instant!

Caught off guard, Yang Xuancai instantly spat out a mouthful of blood. A new golden wound had appeared on her arm, so deep that the bone was visible.

But Changyun was stunned.

Yu Xi was not the least bit concerned.

The old codger's figure had vanished into the thick aquatic mist, and it was impossible to tell where he had gone. Occasionally, a stream or two of aquatic light would fall, seemingly to obstruct the golden qi in the sky, but they appeared to have little effect.

How could the woman not see that the old man was not trying his best? She was instantly horrified and said with hatred,

"Senior—why must you go this far!"

Yang Ruiyi had mentioned to Li Zhouwei that the Yu and Yang clans were not on good terms, but Changyun had come in a hurry and had not known about this great battle beforehand, so he had no understanding of the situation. Right now, he had no idea what these two were up to, but the arrow had already left the bow. He could only form another divine ability and say faintly,

"Fellow Daoist Yang, watch closely!"

The white umbrella behind him abruptly flipped over. In that instant, the sky and earth changed color, and an autumn wind howled. A dense qi of Metal Virtue, like an endless waterfall, poured from the rim of his umbrella—gold and white, cyan and black—causing the woman's black hair to whip about and her heart to tremble.

But at that moment, another golden light fell from the Great Void, faintly pinning her in place. Changyun's hidden card, concealed for so long, was finally played!

Yang Xuancai finally felt the crisis of death wash over her. Seeing the white mist in the sky continue to roil, with no intention of coming to her aid, her heart sank into icy despair.

Even a clay doll has a temper. A surge of fury rushed to her heart, and though Yang Xuancai was forbearing, she could not tolerate this any longer. She shot a hateful glance at the clouds in the sky and said through clenched teeth,

"If you continue to stand by and watch, old master, the Yang clan will have no choice but to surrender!"

It seemed her words had an effect. The clouds between heaven and earth began to swirl, and a streak of white light gradually shone down, aimed at Changyun and filled with boundless killing intent. Changyun's hand had yet to loosen its grip on the umbrella handle when a cold voice, laced with a divine ability, drifted into his ear.

"Fellow Daoist Changyun—if you kill her, the Yu clan is willing to surrender and guard this place for the General!"

It was the voice of Yu Xi.

Changyun had a sudden realization.

'In Ruzhou… the conflict between the Yu and Yang clans has reached an irreconcilable point! It's normally suppressed and unable to erupt, but at this critical juncture, this old codger actually intends to murder a fellow divine ability user!'

'He wanted to drag this out until I grew impatient, creating a situation where I might become a blade in his hand!'

The white qi in the sky seemed to be aimed at Changyun, but it was secretly heading for Yang Xuancai!

This gave him a moment's pause. The golden light in his hand grew ever stronger, and Yu Xi's aged yet resolute voice boomed in his ear.

'Fellow Daoist Changyun, it would only take us a moment to kill her. If you accept her surrender, I, Yu, will defend Ruzhou to the very last, ensuring this place will never fall into the hands of the Song!'

Such words would have been tempting to any Song cultivator, but Changyun was different. A chill settled in his heart.

'If she's to be killed, it should be by Valley Water, not Geng Metal. Do you want me to do your dirty work for you?'

But Yang Xuancai was no fool. In that single instant, she vaguely understood that the white light was not coming to help her. Her gaze turned resolute, and the essence blood of her divine ability surged through her body, causing her to spit out a mouthful of blood as she finally broke through the golden light. A swath of cyan then rose from her body.

Ushering Spring’s Dawn!

Battles between Purple Mansion cultivators could change in an instant. The Horn Wood divine ability poured forth. In the moment Changyun had paused, her desperate, all-or-nothing struggle allowed a bright spring wind to gush out, carrying her away at extreme speed!

Yu Xi was to the north and Changyun to the south. Utterly terrified, she fled westward, pushing all the divine ability and dharma power she could muster to its absolute limit.

'The Tao clan is on good terms with the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao; they will surely be able to save me!'

Ushering Spring’s Dawn possessed the ability to ride the winds and nourish wood, and she was traveling through the mortal world. Her movement was incredibly fast, and in a flash, she became a single point of jade-green light on the horizon, on the verge of escaping with her life!

But in that instant, a bright light seemed to flash across the sky. The surging spring wind was suddenly disrupted and scattered, and a massive hand abruptly reached into the air, materializing from nothing to seize the divine ability!

Yang Xuancai felt as if she had slammed into an invisible wall. Her head spun, and blood trickled from her lips. To her greater dismay, a massive hand was now clamped around her fair neck, lifting her high into the air!

'I'm done for!'

Yang Xuancai felt utterly wronged. She forced her eyes open, only to meet a pair of brilliant, intensely powerful golden eyes.

The golden eyes held a hint of confusion, as if their owner could not understand how a Daoist Master from the Great Zhao had managed to crash right into him.

'Golden eyes…'

The Daoist Master of the Yang clan had no time to curse her bad luck; she instantly understood who stood before her.

'The White Qilin!'

In her despair, she saw a glimmer of hope. Blood was still streaming from her mouth, but she managed to cry out urgently,

"The Yang clan is willing to surrender to King Wei!"

Li Zhouwei did not release his grip. His powerful Bright Yang divine ability still held the woman fast. He took a single, heavy step, crossing the mortal plane to arrive before the two Daoist Masters in the sky.

"Cough, cough…"

He set Yang Xuancai down beside him. The woman coughed up some more blood, and having survived the ordeal, she stood meekly behind him in exhaustion. With her eyes lowered, she dared not utter another word.

Li Zhouwei paid her no mind, turning his head to look around. For the instant his eyes swept over them, they shone with a brilliant light. Golden light surged in King Wei's other hand as a long halberd materialized from the void.

He said, "Surrender—or die."

The aquatic mist in the sky roiled. Changyun already found Yu Xi deeply unpleasant, and now he stood by, gloating, the smirk on his face practically overflowing.

Yu Xi was silent for a moment.

If it came down to it, Yu Xi's Valley Water was not afraid of Bright Yang techniques. Even with Li Zhouwei's prestigious reputation, he did not believe he could be taken down in an instant—he, Yu Xi, could afford to drag things out, but Li Zhouwei could not!

But Changyun was still standing by.

If Changyun and Li Zhouwei attacked together, his only option would be to protect himself and flee. Even then, he could still stall for some time, which would also be a loss for Li Zhouwei, but if he just up and left, what would happen to the members of his Yu clan left in Ruzhou? Yang Xuancai had already submitted to Li Zhouwei!

He, Yu Xi, was no loyal subject of the Great Zhao, so why should he hinder himself?

'I'm not even in a position to negotiate with him!'

The old man cupped his hands, lowered his eyes, and said decisively,

"I am willing to serve King Wei."

Li Zhouwei's expression was unchanged as he said,

"The formation."

This was to be expected. Yang Xuancai was already prepared, holding a jade talisman in her slender hands while glaring fiercely at Yu Xi. The old man had no choice but to produce a jade talisman of his own. Li Zhouwei took them, and his spiritual sense permeated them, confirming that he could sense the formations.

Seeing this, Changyun grew thoughtful and sent a message via his divine ability:

'This Yu Xi is a slippery old fox. He's not suited to be anywhere… even following King Wei and myself would be a huge problem!'

This was the advantage of Valley Water. Just as Murong Yan had been as slippery as a loach during the conflict between the north and south, so too was Yu Xi now—he was not necessarily that formidable in a fight, but no matter how dire the situation became, he always had the ability to protect himself and just walk away.

Having obtained control of the great formation, a hint of a smile appeared in King Wei's eyes. The time had come to reveal his true intentions.

He said faintly, "Daoist Master Yang will guard Ruzhou. Fellow Daoist Yu—you will follow me west to face the enemy."

At these words, the color drained from Yu Xi's face. Changyun, however, was not surprised. He smiled and looked at Yang Xuancai, saying,

"Daoist Master Yang, please move the Yu clansmen into the Yang clan's formation and await King Wei's command."

They were all accomplished Daoist Masters, so Yang Xuancai naturally understood. Her eyes filled with glee as she stared hatefully at Yu Xi and replied,

"Yes!"

But this old Daoist Master was no simple character. Seeing this, he simply said,

"I am willing to die for King Wei, but there are message talismans within my clan. I will know of their life and death."

Having brought him to heel, Li Zhouwei turned to Changyun and said in a low voice,

"Mount Liangchuan has been taken. With this hindrance removed, you can accompany me to resist the Zhao general."

He said this aloud deliberately. Not only was Changyun startled, but the two Daoist Masters, Yu and Yang, were also greatly shocked. Yang Xuancai cried out in disbelief:

"Then Yinling…"

She clearly thought the Tao clan had already surrendered to the Song, but Changyun secretly shook his head,

'The Tao clan is arrogant and never listens to the commands of the Great Zhao. Even Qi Lanyan could only call upon Tao Jiexing through their private friendship. Right now, they're just sitting on the mountain watching the tigers fight. While they're unwilling to die for the Great Zhao, they're also not willing to surrender at the first sign of trouble…'

'I see… they've clearly reached a tacit understanding with King Wei to guard Yinling and wait for Li Zhouwei to pacify the region, after which they will answer the call of Martial Cultivation as reclusive immortals… In short… as descendants of powerful cultivators, and with three Purple Mansion combatants at their disposal, both Li Zhouwei and the Song Emperor desperately need them… They're truly playing the long game.'

Changyun came from a distinguished background, so he had a broader perspective and a quick wit; his assessment of the situation was spot on. Li Zhouwei did not answer Yang Xuancai, instead rising up on a ray of heavenly light. The three mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivators immediately sped away—and Yu Xi was the most hurried of them all.

For every moment his clansmen were in the hands of the Yang, he would feel a moment more of unease!

Li Zhouwei, however, looked somewhat grim. He let the landscape streak past beneath his feet, his brow never un-furrowing. Changyun saw this, offered a slight bow, and sighed,

"It was my oversight. I have troubled you, King Wei."

The matter was quite clear. Li Zhouwei had sent Changyun to Ruzhou hoping he could subdue the region, settle things with the two great families, and bring their forces west as reinforcements.

Now, with the advantage Li Zhouwei had gained from his surprise attack on Liangchuan, he should have been able to rendezvous with Changyun and immediately proceed to Boye to set an ambush before Zanmen, catching the Zhao forces completely off guard.

But no news had come from him; he had even gotten bogged down in the situation, which had now escalated to the point where Li Zhouwei had to personally intervene, wasting a perfect opportunity!

Changyun could only feel bitter. After all, Luoxia had always been peaceful. Who would have thought that a so-called minor friction in Ruzhou would escalate to this, that the conflict between the Yu and Yang clans would reach the point where Yu Xi would try to use Changyun to eliminate Yang Xuancai!

He neither knew nor cared how the two families had reached such a state; he only cared that it had ruined his plan!

Although Li Zhouwei had not witnessed the events himself, he had used a Spirit Probe while on his way and was aware of the situation. To avoid revealing this, he had deliberately shown a bit of confusion when he caught Yang Xuancai. Now, he sent a message via his divine ability, saying quietly,

"It is no matter… The greater situation is always in flux, and things will not always go according to plan. Although we lost an opportunity, we have gained Yu Xi's full cooperation… It is a pity to lose such a good chance… If we cannot ambush them at Zanmen, we will settle for the next best thing."

A smile slowly spread across his face, and the will to fight burned fiercely in his eyes.

"Then we shall fight them at Boye!"
