# Chapter 1177: Song Ci

Li Zhouwei’s words echoed in the pavilion for a long time. Li Ximing was stunned for a moment, his heart suddenly stirring. He withdrew his hands, paced within the pavilion, and said with a sense of awe,

"I understand!"

He generally grasped Li Zhouwei’s talk of a life-mandate, which was merely about finding the most potent kind of Supreme Yin Spiritual Qi—a task that truly wouldn't be difficult for him.

He reached into his sleeve and pulled out a pale blue jade slip.

This was the secret compendium of Supreme Yin materials he had acquired from the Chunyi Dao Gate, named the 'Moonlight Embracing Profundity Compendium'!

To secure this object, the Li Clan had to give a refining method from one of the grotto-heavens, the Six Harmonies Treasure Vase Treatise. The Chunyi Dao Gate had been extremely fair, providing a virtually uncensored record of an ocean of Supreme Yin materials!

The spiritual sense of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator reviewed the information at lightning speed. Dense, pure-white characters poured through his mind. In an instant, Li Ximing’s eyes lit up.

"There is exactly one—'Profound Minister Moon Essence'—it's bright as the moon, dense as lead, untouchable, and is collected using the 'Moon Bright Broad Acceptance Secret Art' from the 'Northern Zenith Moon Fluid' found thousands of feet above the sky, which is bathed in Supreme Yin illumination. It takes five years to collect a single thread, and ten threads to form it!"

"This thread of Spiritual Qi... requires a full fifty years of collection, and it must be collected using a Spiritual Artifact from the Purple Mansion Realm!"

Evidently, based on the description, the difficulty of collecting this Spiritual Qi was far higher than the Jiangchun's Lesser Void Yin Qi, which was harvested from the Great Void. If Supreme Yin Moon Radiance was at the very pinnacle of Supreme Yin Spiritual Qi, then this substance was in the layer just beneath it, yet it possessed the most vibrant potency in that secondary layer.

If Supreme Yin Moon Radiance had a position rating of ten and a potency rating of three, then this substance had a position of nine and a potency of eight. Its rarity was likely comparable to Supreme Yin Moon Radiance.

He did not decide rashly but continued reading through the chapters until he had reviewed all the recorded Spiritual Qi, finally affirming.

"At least within the Chunyi Dao Gate's archives, this is the Spiritual Qi with the most abundant potency."

Li Zhouwei gave a subtle nod, but Li Ximing was already growing impatient. His heart was filled with many internal thoughts,

'My Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body is already near the threshold. For a long time, I've hesitated to condense Supreme Yin Moon Radiance into it, but if the Profound Minister Moon Essence possesses enough potency to serve as the Monarch medicine for a pill, then, with a few Spiritual Resources to dissolve its potent Supreme Yin nature, I can dare to have the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body consume Great Pills, which ordinary cultivators find difficult to obtain in a hundred years, like they were mere beans!'

His thoughts soared. He floated up, decisively took out a portion of Supreme Yin Moon Radiance from the pavilion, and read it against the Elucidating Profundity Bestowed Jade Method. He couldn't help but loosen his grip on it and look up at Li Zhouwei.

The King Wei chuckled and said,

"We might as well wait for Que'wan. She is skilled in transformation. If our luck is good, we will have more than just Supreme Yin at our disposal."

His words carried significant meaning. Li Ximing sighed twice, turned, and put his things away, saying,

"It's not that it can't be used, it's just too profound and would take considerable time. While familiarity would eventually speed things up, with Que'wan here, there's no need to spend that unnecessary effort."

Li Zhouwei pulled a jade charm from his sleeve. Looking at the warm glow on its surface, he smiled and said,

"Granduncle, don't be disappointed. Isn't there good news as well?"

Li Ximing looked up, slightly stunned, and then immediately asked joyfully:

"The Song Court has arrived?!"

---

The black energy in the sky was arrayed like interwoven bolts of silk, horizontally and vertically displayed. A bronze immortal carriage sped across it, drawing out two parallel lines of purple energy.

The bronze carriages were laden with treasures. The most precious ones contained treasure caskets and were guarded by ranks of steel-clad soldiers. The procession traveled north toward Ting Province. Li Jiangliang, clad in official robes, stood before the carriage, accompanied by a woman at his side. Both their expressions were somewhat unusual.

This carriage was bound for Ting Province.

Even though the carriages were filled with fine silks and treasures, and the favor shown was substantial, and even though he was traveling to his own hometown, Li Jiangliang found it difficult to feel any joy. The many discussions from the morning's court still rang in his ears, filling him with worry.

'The Great General... intends to resign from his post as the Grand General of the North...'

The Song Court had deliberated in secret for a long time, tallying merits, providing solace, smoothing things over, and then arranging the rewards. Yet, following this long list of rewards was Yang Ruiyi's move to take responsibility for Liu Bai’s death and seek to return his military seal.

Although the Song Emperor refused Yang Ruiyi's gesture and even bestowed further gifts upon him, it was clear to anyone with eyes that this Great General intended to retreat to a secondary role. With this, all the Daoist Masters and various factions were utterly filled with anxiety.

Yang Ruiyi was not particularly likable. While he had no astonishing achievements, he was relatively gentle and had never used harsh methods against any of the great clans—this was enough. Having such a Great General ensured that no major crisis would erupt.

Now that he was stepping down, the Yang Clan certainly had no general who could command respect. King Wei, who possessed both prestige and power, was not favored by the Martial Cultivation light, and preferring to reign supreme over his own domain, would not permanently reside in the court. Thus, someone else would have to be appointed to govern Jianghuai.

The problem was that Jianghuai was not an easy place to handle. Among the few cultivators in the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, Situ Huo was ambitious and desperately needed Martial Cultivation beyond the Purple Mystery level, while Changyun, having earned merit for securing the land, also desired to govern Jiangbei. The land of Jianghuai also had the potential to increase the light of Martial Cultivation, and many Daoist Masters beneath them wished to partake in the benefits. Even Yehui had resigned his title as King and sought to secure the Holder of the Profound position for Guan Gongxiao.

In this situation, undercurrents surged within the court and the common folk. Those of them who held a Holder of the Profound position while only being in the Foundation Establishment Realm felt somewhat awkward.

He was lost in thought, and Yang Tianyou, by his side, was likewise subtly uneasy, holding an even heavier worry in her heart than he did.

'The Great General voluntarily relinquishing his power... Without his guardianship in the court, it will sooner or later become a one-man rule under the Song Emperor.'

Since the founding of the nation, this Song Emperor had always been extremely restrained, maintaining a high degree of tacit understanding with Yang Ruiyi, going no further than refusing to promote Yang Ruiyi's close confidants... But in Yang Tianyou's eyes, this Song Emperor was by no means an ordinary person!

'Whether it's King Wei or the Song Emperor, both are people blessed with fate. Even in ancient times, they would have been Mystic Body cultivators or Holy Sons of an immortal sect. How could they long remain subordinate to others?'

Once the Yang Clan loosened its restraints on him, if Yang Zhuo developed any ideas or wished to undertake any kind of northern or southern tour, would the Yang Clan cooperate or not? Wouldn't they be led around by the nose?

Even if it didn't come to such an extreme, as long as he bestowed extra favor upon a certain Daoist Master, under the imperial decree, how could they refuse?

The couple were each preoccupied with their own thoughts, both sensing subtle undercurrents surging beneath the great victory of the Song Court. It was only when the bright, flowing Moongaze Lake appeared before them that they suddenly snapped out of their musings.

The Daoist Master in the white-gold robe was already approaching on a beam of light to greet them.

Although Li Ximing had received surprisingly good news and felt quite lighthearted, his naturally serious face still bore a heavy, unyielding concern. His brows were knit together, showing hidden sorrow.

This expression jolted Li Jiangliang. He forcefully restrained the urge to ask about his father, turned around, and lifted the curtain, revealing the man inside.

"Lord Yang, please."

This person was none other than Yang Ruizao, the former Family Head of the Yang Clan in the Azure Pond Sect.

This man's talent was low, and he was quite old. Back when he was in the Azure Pond Sect, he couldn't even manage to meet a Daoist Master. But fate was a trickster; with no one else to step up in the Yang Clan, he unexpectedly rose from a person of mediocre talent to become an Imperial Scion Holder of the Profound position. Even Daoist Masters had to salute him.

However, Yang Ruizao was very close to the Li Clan. When the Li Clan planned to annex the west bank, it was through his connections that they reached an agreement with Daoist Qu, avoiding a bloody conflict. He had also met the Li family members at that time.

Now, as old friends reunited, Yang Ruizao was extremely courteous. Having had his cultivation forcefully suppressed and returned to the Foundation Establishment Realm, he dared not put on any airs. Stepping down from the carriage, the first words out of his mouth were congratulations:

"Your clan's three Holders of the Profound have all been promoted, and their official stipends have increased. Jiangxia has received the greatest favor, being ennobled as Auxiliary Yang Marquis."

These titles of nobility for the three Holders of the Profound actually held little practical significance for the Li Clan. Li Ximing responded with a smile. Yang Ruizao immediately unrolled a golden scroll and began to read the imperial decree.

This edict was unprecedentedly long. It praised King Wei as "the foundation of the nation, the pillar of its great endeavor," moving from commending Li Ximing for "serving his duties without slack, with outstanding diligence and merit" to praising Li Jiangqian for "aiding in times of crisis and receiving the national canon," and then grouping them together to laud their "being worthy of this grand ordinance." The Song Emperor's high approval was evident.

In this struggle between North and South, the Yang Clan might not have been particularly pleased, but this Song Emperor was likely overjoyed. Li Ximing listened, secretly chuckling in his heart, and cupped his hands,

"Ting Province has not failed the Sacred Expectation and shall strive to build on its achievements."

Yang Ruizao was clearly unaware of the machinations involved, repeatedly voicing his approval. Having been a Holder of the Profound for so long, the experience of being returned to the Foundation Establishment Realm made him extremely insecure. He quickly urged,

"Please, Daoist Master, accept the rewards on behalf of King Wei!"

Two armored Song generals stepped forward. They lifted a desk from the seemingly bottomless ethereal carriage, each holding one end. Only when they came closer did they reveal the soft red cloth, upon which lay a small bottle and a stone box.

Yang Ruizao first took the box and laughed,

"Daoist Master Changli's exceptional talent and timely aid during the crisis were seen by all of us. Although the Golden Feather Sect coveted the White River and did not enter the lake, they did tie up Touba Lan and the others earlier. This reward is solely for him."

His words sounded pleasant, but Li Jiangqian's contribution was the most minor, which was why it was brought up first. Li Ximing watched with a smile as he opened the jade box, revealing a reddish, dusky malevolence within.

"Clear Li Malevolence Cloud."

Yang Ruizao said,

"This object is particularly unique; it's not quite fire, not quite cloud—it is, in fact, a malevolence. Whether cultivated with a special spell art or used in refining a Spiritual Artifact, it can achieve unparalleled wondrous effects!"

The Song Court was enormously wealthy. Even though Li Jiangqian had not played a major role, a Li Fire Spiritual Material was still presented out of respect for Ting Province! Yang Ruizao did not elaborate, but Li Ximing understood clearly and inwardly praised,

'That's not bad at all. I wonder if he can pair it with his newly acquired 'Vast Desert Li Fire' and exchange it for a good spell art to cultivate!'

Once this appetizer was finished, Yang Ruizao smiled a little more and picked up the small bottle.

"This is a treasure bestowed by the court, specially prepared for the Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing looked closely. The bottle was crystal clear, with eight facets. It was no bigger than a fist, with a neck two fingers wide, and it shone brightly, unremarkable in its appearance. Yang Ruizao then said,

"This object comes from the Heavenly Lang Terrace Daoist Tradition of the ancient cultivators. It was specially used by alchemists. Although considered a minor trinket by ancient cultivators, it is still an outstanding treasure in the present day. Most importantly... this object is a long-lost 'Azure Manifestation' artifact!"

"'Azure Manifestation'?!"

Li Ximing’s heart stirred.

The only Azure Manifestation Divine Ability he had ever witnessed was Qingyan. That Demon beast had likely perished at the hands of the Great Western Plateau now. Despite his regret, the feeling that Azure Manifestation Divine Ability had given him remained unforgettable.

"What kind of wonder does it possess?"

Li Ximing asked expectantly. Yang Ruizao had already presented the object, allowing Li Ximing to take it, and explained,

"I heard this object can hold liquid. If ordinary liquid is poured into it and left to settle for a year, it can capture the 'Azure Manifestation' wonder. Drinking it into the Juque Palace can assist in alchemy!"

'A blessing spell art indeed!'

Li Ximing had experienced the 'Almighty Crag' of the Qingyan blessing back then; how could he not know the power of that Dao Lineage?

'Even if it doesn't increase the success rate much, if a single batch of pills yields one or two extra, a few batches later, the profit will be huge!'

He was momentarily ecstatic. Yang Ruizao, however, laughed,

"We are not 'Azure Manifestation' cultivators, so we cannot fully unleash its wonder. Its most useful ability is the blessing of pills. The remaining divine ability—which condenses Azure Manifestation light to kill enemies—is not very potent. While usable for those newly entering the Purple Mansion Realm, it's hardly worth mentioning in the hands of your clan."

Li Ximing did not feel disappointed and nodded with satisfaction:

'Azure Manifestation cultivators... where in this world could one find them? This is already enough!'

Though this reward was already quite substantial, Yang Ruizao remained unfazed and finally said with a serious expression,

"The Emperor considered King Wei's reward for a long time. Firstly, King Wei's merit is immense and difficult to quantify, and he feared that ordinary items would show a lack of proper respect. Secondly, the Emperor is especially concerned that King Wei is injured and has not fully recovered."

Upon hearing this, Li Ximing’s heart sank:

'Could he be giving me a Supreme Yin Spiritual Material?'

Supreme Yin Spiritual items were indeed precious, but with the Art of Demoting Yin and infinite possibilities now within reach, Li Ximing actually preferred not to receive an arbitrary Supreme Yin Spiritual item!

Perhaps the Supreme Yin Spiritual item was also deemed insufficient as a reward, or perhaps the Song Emperor did not possess a sufficiently valuable Supreme Yin item himself. Yang Ruizao lifted the jade box, and inside lay a jade slip and a crimson-veined silver pill, no larger than a finger!

This instantly piqued Li Ximing’s interest. His gaze burned, and he tentatively asked,

"A Spiritual Treasure?"

Yang Ruizao nodded with envy.

"A Spiritual Treasure from the Hengzhu Dao—the Mystic Tablet Edict Pill!"

At the first sight of the object, Li Ximing had nearly mistaken it for a healing pill, and his heart leaped into his throat!

'It's not that I don't need the pill, it's that it's no longer necessary!'

He secretly breathed a sigh of relief. The man in black then recounted the history of the item:

"This item originated from the ancient 'Whole Pill' Dao Lineage's Cavern-True Terrace. It originally consisted of five pills, forming a set called the 'Five Edicts of Hidden Profundity'. However, it was repeatedly moved from place to place and scattered, its reputation diminished. Later, a minor cultivator from the Purple Terrace acquired it and rose steadily through the ranks using this Spiritual Treasure, eventually achieving a divine ability. He then had the good fortune to slowly find the other four pills, and for a time, he dominated a region and earned an immense reputation!"

"After his death, the object was scattered again. Future generations tirelessly searched for the five pills, and those who imitated the refining process were countless... They created a multitude of counterfeits, alongside those who imitated the various Profound Mystery tokens of the Encompassing Profundity Dao, which became a widespread trend!"

Li Ximing was secretly delighted, his heart fluttering:

'Something from the Hengzhu Dao... This is the first time I've seen it, let alone a Spiritual Treasure with such a history!'

Today, I landed in Guangzhou at 3 AM. I'm exhausted, so this is a bit late. I can write without distraction tomorrow.
