# Chapter 987: Harvest

The treasures before his eyes flickered, a dazzling sight that illuminated the entire Gardenia Scenery Mountain. Li Ximing held his breath, stepped forward two paces, and carefully examined the purple-golden Thunder Profound Mace.

"Oh!"

Just as he was about to pick it up, his gaze was irresistibly drawn to the Li Fire Spiritual Treasure. It was as perfectly round as a Golden Core, wrapped in golden threads and flowing with various dazzling Li Fire illusions and True Fire, making it impossible to look away. His eyes immediately fixed in mid-air.

"Wonderful!"

His eyes were glued to it, but his hand unconsciously continued its previous motion. He quickly reached for his waist, pulled out a jade box, and handed it to Li Zhouwei, saying, "Go ahead and take the pill first!"

In the grotto-heaven, Li Zhouwei had already taken a Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill, but the one Li Ximing was offering now was from the 'Valley Water' lineage, and was a much better remedy. He nodded, took it without a second thought, and laughed.

"I got eight stalks of spiritual incense, five spiritual items, three Spiritual Artifacts of an incredibly high grade, one Li Fire Spiritual Treasure, one record of merit, and one spirit embryo that I snatched on the way out, and two Purple Mansion Realm cultivation arts… five spiritual resources… As for the other miscellaneous things, like ancient dharma artifacts, they're too many to count!"

"The things on me were too precious. I was worried there might be an ambush outside, and I just happened to find an exit inside, so I came out early. Otherwise, with the anomaly just appearing, I wouldn't have made it to the lake so quickly."

Li Ximing was astonished. "That's enough to be the foundation for a new sect! Just how many people did you rob?"

Li Zhouwei simply laughed. "Granduncle doesn't know how rich this Wanling Heaven is... it's probably unprecedented. Inside the grotto-heaven, immortal palaces are everywhere, Spiritual Artifacts are on display, and everything is opulent. Things that are rare outside are used as mere decorations inside the palaces... it even surpasses the Anhuai Heaven of the past. You could say everyone got their fill!"

Li Ximing secretly clicked his tongue and shook his head. "After all, it's the Wanling Upper Sect! How could it be just any Dao Lineage? But a Spiritual Treasure is hard to come by. It must have taken a lot of effort!"

Li Zhouwei's expression turned serious. "That part was indeed out of the ordinary. I made a few enemies, but they weren't anyone important, just some Northern Barbarian tribesmen, demonic cultivators from the South, and the Maha Merciful One... when you owe too many debts, you stop worrying. I just robbed them."

"The cultivators were all focused on grabbing treasures, and few wasted time fighting. The only one was the Shilou Yingge, who fought me a bit fiercely. These injuries on me are all thanks to him."

He shook his head, a placid look in his golden eyes. "He got what he asked for. He's not having a good time now either."

"Shilou Yingge!" Li Ximing knew this person was a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, and had personally faced the pressure he brought. It was no wonder he could cause so much trouble for Li Zhouwei. Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"Just an old grudge..."

Li Zhouwei just gave a dismissive smirk and said, "First, let me show Granduncle a treasure!" He raised his hand mysteriously and lightly hooked something under the table, and a jade box immediately leaped out.

The box was covered in dense patterns and shimmered with light, looking extremely unusual. Li Ximing recognized it at a glance as the jade box Li Tongya had obtained on Pingya Island all those years ago. It had no particular value in itself, but in terms of containing spiritual items, it was the best he had ever used.

This item was originally used to store Supreme Yin Moon Radiance and moon branches, but after the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance opened, all those things were put into it, and they wouldn't suffer the slightest bit of damage, so the jade box was taken out.

His interest was piqued. "What kind of treasure is it that you have to use this to store it?!" He saw the lid of the jade box flip open, and a blazing, bright white flame was burning within. The fire was a dazzling, brilliant white. Vaguely, he could see many light-gray, almost invisible flames enveloping the bright white fire. They surged forth instantly, and a fierce, scorching heat wave rushed towards him, greatly shocking Li Ximing's heart.

"A Purple Mansion Realm spiritual flame!"

He was highly experienced in this field. He only needed one glance before he was stunned.

"A Merging Fire related to the Supreme Yang!"

Li Zhouwei had anticipated his surprise and laughed. "Spiritual items like this are rarely seen... but they're common in grotto-heavens!"

Li Ximing was no longer listening to anything he said. He quickly reached out two fingers and lightly swiped across the jade box, instantly refining the flame.

_Buzz!_ The blazing, bright white flame immediately leaped onto his palm, dancing with excitement. Li Ximing closed his eyes slightly, greatly agitated, and replied, "What a spiritual flame!"

Li Zhouwei asked with a smile, "Does Granduncle recognize it?"

This hit the spot. Li Ximing chuckled. "I actually know a bit about it! Back then, I heard Daoist Master Yuandao explain a Dao, and there was one flame called the 'Lustful Merging Fire,' and I had an epiphany from it. After that, I specifically researched and collected information, secretly matching what I found... A Great Daoist Master once mentioned that the Yuwu bird has an affinity with the Three Yangs, giving birth to three kinds of fire. The one corresponding to the Bright Yang is the essence of lustful fire outside of desire, which is the second kind of fire. But the one corresponding to the Supreme Yang is the first, called the 'Supreme Yang Merging Fire'... It is rumored to have infinite power. The Yuwu bird bestowed it upon a descendant called the 'Great Peacock of the Yang Star,' whose descendants call themselves the Heavenly Yuwu, and they use the 'Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire' that is right before us!"

There was still a look of disbelief on his face as he spoke. "I don't know much about this thing, but among the Merging Fires, it is definitely a top-tier existence! If you don't use flames, you don't know how powerful this thing is... if a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who cultivates Merging Fire were to get their hands on it... it would definitely be enough for them to make a famous name for themselves among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators!"

"In all these years... this is the most precious spiritual flame I've ever seen! Even the 'Small Peacock Karma' of the past cannot compare!"

"Oh?" Li Zhouwei hadn't expected this flame to be so extraordinary. He was secretly moved. While thinking, he said, "That makes sense! I remember there's a screen in the Xinhu Palace that also has a painting of the Yuwu bird, its beak pointed at the sun. There were three circular positions, which must also correspond to this legend."

Li Ximing was overjoyed. He put away the flame and laughed. "Although the Supreme Yang neutralizes it a bit, this fire still has the devious nature of Merging Fire. It can burn a dharma body and damage a person's dharma power, not only clinging to them like a festering wound and being extremely difficult to remove, but also able to summon the power of the sun to kill enemies..."

"Its power is great, but first, it consumes a lot of dharma power, and second, its power is hard to control. The latter isn't a problem, though... The key is that it's too rare. We should find a few seniors to ask about it!" Li Ximing's "not a problem" naturally referred to the Valley Wind Guide-Fire. He happily accepted it. Li Zhouwei then took out the rest of the items. The remaining spiritual item was a pot of Upper Rite spiritual material, which was integrated with the Essence-Gathering Profound Origin Art and thus could not be moved, so it would be kept in the clan.

Next was an eye-catching jade ring. Its smoky color was shimmering, as if stained with rouge. The Supreme Goodness Profound Jade and the Cascading Profound White Jade were combined into one, which was also a very valuable Purple Mansion Realm spiritual item.

"This thing is incredible. Granduncle, please take it and ask Daoist Master Zhusheng from the Southern Borderlands about it."

While Li Ximing admired it again and again, Li Zhouwei took out another item. It was a radiant, crystal-like object, shining with dazzling multicolored light, which made Li Ximing's eyebrows rise in delight.

"Now this can make up for that lost spiritual item. Otherwise, I would really have no way to explain it to Wan'er!" It was the "Whole Pill" spiritual item Six-Aspect Ceremonial Hue! This item was no ordinary thing. It was mentioned in the Golden Book of Houshu and was much rarer than the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury from back then... It was a treasure of the Whole Pill Dao and could assist in transformations. If it was refined into a Spiritual Artifact, it would be even more wondrous!

At this sight, Li Ximing felt both regret and joy. Human hearts are never truly satisfied, and he couldn't help but sigh. "To think it's such a wondrous spiritual item! If the Nine-Colored Profound Mercury were still here, this item could have been used to refine an artifact for her after she reaches the Purple Mansion Realm, which would have surely taken her divine ability to the next level... What a pity!"

Li Zhouwei was non-committal and laughed. "Nothing can be perfect. Let's just wait and see." These were all things he had acquired early on. He paused for a moment and then took out another profound box, lightly picked out an item from inside, and showed a beam of white light.

Inside the box was a piece of Water Metal, about an inch long, that emitted a colorful, hazy, golden light. A thick watery mist settled at the bottom, its color a deep blue.

"A 'Converging Water' spiritual item!" This jade box was the white light he had snatched from Helian Wujiang. Li Zhouwei was extremely lucky; it wasn't a spiritual resource, but another spiritual item! He laughed. "It's just that our family doesn't have a Converging Water Dao Lineage, so I can't identify what it is... but that's not a problem. I'm acquainted with Daoist Master Xiang Chun, so I'll just send her a letter and ask."

The Converging Water Dao is a prominent Dao of the current era, one of the few Great Daos that has been consistently prominent since ancient times. Its items are not rare, and although the situation in the grotto-heaven was a little different, spiritual items of this Dao were still to be found.

Li Zhouwei wasn't surprised, but Li Ximing sighed. "No wonder everyone is so eager to get in. These five spiritual items combined would have taken me hundreds of years to collect..."

"But that's not all!" Li Zhouwei then unfastened the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron and handed it to Li Ximing, speaking seriously. "This is the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron. Although its combat power is not great, its auxiliary effects are extremely strong. It can refine spiritual water from spiritual items, and in its wondrousness, it surpasses most of the Spiritual Artifacts of today! Only in the Wanling grotto-heaven would there be such a treasure..."

Li Ximing took it in his hands. Li Zhouwei's gaze swept over the purple-gold Profound Mace and the Li Fire Spiritual Treasure. "As for these two treasures, one is an outstanding Spiritual Artifact, and the other is a Spiritual Treasure. I'll have to trouble Granduncle to refine them a bit while I recover from my injuries..."

Li Ximing readily agreed, laughing. "I also have a jade talisman with three treasures that need refining, so it's going to take me a while... but I'm more than happy to do it. It's not every day you get a chance like this."

Li Zhouwei laughed and took something out from his sleeve, holding his palm up to show it to him. It was a golden jade tablet the size of a palm, with flickering patterns and a slight curve, which made Li Ximing freeze.

"There's more?!" The golden-eyed young man just smiled. "That's right!"

He shook his hand, and the jade tablet flipped lightly in the air, suddenly transforming into a golden light. It extended like water, and when it landed in his palm, it had become a golden spear about ten feet long, entirely golden.

The spear was extremely strange, smooth all over, with no patterns or changes in shape. The spearhead and the shaft were one, making it look very unremarkable.

Li Zhouwei said with a hint of regret, "This is also a Spiritual Artifact, called the Descending Radiance Equal Edge. There are six in the set, and when they flew out, I only managed to snatch one. Its power isn't significant on its own, but it's still usable."

"Descending Radiance Equal Edge..." Li Ximing was slightly surprised, listening to Li Zhouwei's appreciative tone. "This item was forged with the Wandering Metal spiritual item. Its original owner, in order to highlight the wondrous nature of the Wandering Metal—the 'metal of no cause and no effect' and its 'wandering' nature—did not inscribe any profound patterns, pushing the Wandering Metal's abilities to their maximum..."

"Therefore, this item is quite special. Although it doesn't have a big divine ability on its own, and it moves extremely slowly through the Great Void, it has high resistance to Dharma Arts and is difficult to predict. When all six are present, it has the wondrousness of 'no cause and no effect'..."

"How amazing!"

This forging method was quite unique and was completely different from the current trend of pursuing more profound patterns and more divine abilities. Li Ximing listened thoughtfully, nodding repeatedly. "The ingenuity of an Encompassing Profoundity cultivator is truly an eye-opener!"

This Descending Radiance Equal Edge was naturally a better fit for Li Zhouwei. Li Ximing pushed it back to him and told him to keep it. Only then did Li Zhouwei begin to tally the final harvest from the Li Fire Palace. He placed a magnificent dark red jade slip on the table with a faint smile.

"An ancient Li Fire cultivation art, the Sutra of Double Radiance and Fiery Illumination, which allows you to achieve the divine ability 'Grasp of Ninefold Heaven'!"

Li Ximing took it and read it, sighing, "Jiangqian's Dao Lineage is settled!"

Li Zhouwei sat down next to him, taking out some spiritual water to extinguish the flames on his body and mend his injuries. He replied, "That's not all. Although this cultivation art is ancient, it's extremely wondrous and was created at the very beginning of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. It's abstruse and difficult to understand, and it greatly values one's life-mandate... it's very profound. A cultivator of this art would have a hard time switching to the Heavenly Embryo Dao..."

"What's even more rare is that in the grotto-heaven, secret arts are often held by high-status individuals and sealed in some way. But the owner of this Li Fire Palace was either one of those high-status people or was not under their authority at all, because the secret arts are attached to the end of the text, all three of them!"

In Li Zhouwei's judgment, this palace was not in the center of the mountain but in a more peripheral location, which indicated the latter possibility was more likely. He kept this in mind, and then his tone shifted. "All of this means that our family can let truly talented disciples cultivate this art, and their chances of breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm are not small!"

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly. Then he saw Li Zhouwei open two more jade boxes he had gotten at the same time. One contained a crimson spiritual energy, which was the Luminous Rite of Double Radiance Qi needed for the Sutra of Double Radiance and Fiery Illumination, and there were nine portions. The other box was even more brilliant, containing five crimson, pigeon egg-sized gems. A strong wave of Li Fire Qi immediately rushed out. Each one was bright and of excellent quality, and the one in the very center was surrounded by the others and presented a brilliant golden color.

"The ones around are Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resources, the Crimson Radiance Li Amber..." Li Zhouwei swept his gaze over them. He found it strange. The one in the center should be a spiritual item, but he couldn't tell what it was. He thought to himself, 'It looks like it was prepared early, with the intention of passing down the Dao Lineage... Could they have foreseen the fate of Wanling Heaven, and that's why they prepared the spiritual qi? It's a pity I didn't have time to go to the other side hall, and so I missed the Li Fire Spiritual Artifacts...'

A few thoughts raced through his mind. Li Ximing, standing before him, let out a small exhale and laughed. "With all these things, we finally have the spiritual resources to forge that spiritual armor!"

Li Zhouwei hadn't expected him to still be thinking about the spiritual armor. He was slightly stunned. Seeing his Granduncle put it away in his sleeve, he could only laugh and accept it, saying, "I'll trouble Granduncle with this!"

It was difficult to determine the rest. Li Ximing waved him away and took the silver bell spirit embryo made of Vault Metal. He was in a great mood. "Senior Liu is watching over the Eastern Sea for us. We've never had a good way to repay him. This Vault Metal spirit embryo is more than enough. He'll definitely be happy with it, and he might even be able to help us with something..."

Li Ximing also took the eight golden-patterned profound incense sticks to look at them. He couldn't figure them out and guessed that only someone from the Encompassing Profoundity Dao Lineage would be able to identify them. Unfortunately, their family's relationship with Crimson Reef Island and Changxiao Gate was worse with each passing year. After thinking it over, the only peaceful option seemed to be Duxian.

As he was thinking, Li Zhouwei prepared to go into seclusion to heal his injuries. He reminded him, "Remember to refine that Spiritual Treasure first, Granduncle. There might be some synergy with the Sutra of Double Radiance and Fiery Illumination!"

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly as he saw him off. "Leave the miscellaneous tasks to me. You just focus on healing your injuries, and I'll make sure it's all taken care of."

But in the middle of the forest, Li Ximing saw the young man suddenly remember something. He turned around, his brows raised, his eyes bright, and laughed.

"I also took revenge for you on Helian Wujiang!"
