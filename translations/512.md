# Chapter 772: The Battle Under The Great Seal

But Li Xizhi had already drawn his sword and arrived, several flashes of light flickering and falling, before Tuoba Chongyuan could finish speaking. Quan Yi also retracted his golden cords and struck with a palm imprint of golden light. Tuoba Chongyuan merely raised his spear to block, and the two forces clashed.

Quan Yi’s strike made the long spear tremble. Tuoba Chongyuan shifted slightly, stretching out his ape-like arm to block Li Xizhi, only to discover that the man in the feathered robe was still forming a spell gesture. Just as Tuoba Chongyuan’s arm touched him, he turned into a misty haze.

Rainbow Phantom Split.

Taking advantage of the moment his opponent’s perception technique was broken, Li Xizhi split into multiple illusions that scattered in different directions. His true form emerged behind Tuoba Chongyuan, and with a spell gesture, Morning Rainbow Lure surged forth, striking directly at his back.

However, Tuoba Chongyuan’s dharma robe was extremely tough. Even after taking a direct hit, his face merely paled further. He dispersed three of the illusions with a sweeping motion. His spear shimmered with golden light as it spun and gently flicked against Yu Yuwei’s large purple-red cauldron.

Yu Yuwei was a seasoned cultivator and posed the greatest threat. Tuoba Chongyuan’s spear strike was meant to hold the cauldron back. Dark red veins appeared on his arm, and his blood energy churned violently. Clearly, he had suffered a loss, yet the purple flame within the cauldron managed to surge past the lid and lick at his dao robe.

Tuoba Chongyuan felt a slight pain in his arm and calculated silently, This man in the feathered robe is light and elusive; he's not one suited for direct combat. I’ve already seen through his perception technique, chasing him down would be a waste of time! The man with the golden cords is weak and cowardly. He’s unwilling to confront me directly. The others are mediocre. The most urgent task is to eliminate this old Daoist!

He summoned another jade tablet and effortlessly suppressed the flame in the cauldron. He then took two steps through the air, his figure lunging forward like a phantom.

Yu Yuwei was unafraid. His beard and hair flared outward as he held a purple flame in each hand. A spell brought flames down like a storm, while violet smoke coiled around him. Hatred flared in his heart as well, This brat’s dharma robe is powerful, and he has many artifacts, along with two deadly spells... But the spear in his hand is quite ordinary...

Though formidable, he relies heavily on external tools. His spells are lethal, but if we act together, there’s still a chance of victory!

He conjured flames to block Tuoba Chongyuan’s spear. Bluish water mist emerged as his Immortal Foundation circulated. Water and fire combined, and ferocity twisted his face, suiting his wild appearance.

Yu Yuwei had been born when the Yu Family still basked in its former glory. He and several younger clansmen had been among the last generation of geniuses. At that time, the Yu Family had not yet splintered and faded into obscurity. The techniques and spells he had cultivated were of the highest tier. Now, as he unleashed his might, water and fire intertwined, making for an imposing display.

Yet Tuoba Chongyuan remained indifferent. He merely furrowed his brow and spun his spear to defend. Quan Yi threw out his golden cords to entangle him, while Li Xizhi maneuvered to the side with Heavenly Glow and used rainbow light to assist.

Although Tuoba Chongyuan was far stronger than them, having his perception technique broken made it much harder to deal with Li Xizhi. His initial strikes often left Yu Yuwei pale and Quan Yi spitting blood, yet he still couldn’t catch Li Xizhi.

The three exchanged dozens of moves. Though some on Li Xizhi’s side occasionally coughed up blood, what were a few mouthfuls of blood when lives were at stake? They relentlessly trapped Tuoba Chongyuan as they wore down his mana.

Whoosh...

Struck in the back again by the rainbow light, Tuoba Chongyuan gripped his spear with both hands, his expression darkening. His dharma artifact spun in his grasp as he formed a spell gesture, pressing two fingers together to emit a burst of dharma light.

Strangely enough, though the Tuoba Family was a prestigious devil cultivator family, Tuoba Chongyuan only gave off immortal aura during the battle. There was no trace of demonic or blood qi. Even the techniques he used were upright and righteous immortal arts.

Naturally, the others wouldn’t let him have his way. Almost as soon as Tuoba Chongyuan stopped moving, multiple spell arts rained down. Prepared, he shifted the spell gesture to one hand, while the other reversed his grip on the spear to shield himself.

At the same time, his sleeve flared high, releasing a wave of pure energy. The spells blasted their way through it, but the energy wave had drained forty percent of their power. One by one, they struck the spear, exploding in dazzling brilliance, sending hues in all directions.

Though his face turned a shade paler from the impact, Tuoba Chongyuan subtly smiled, loosening his grip slightly to absorb the force. Then, his pupils suddenly widened.

Gold In Cloud!

Three brilliant beams of colored light abruptly appeared over ten meters away, leaping forward in an instant. Li Xizhi suddenly appeared, flinging out a sleeveful of Heavenly Glow that dispersed through the air like mist and silk.

The man in the feathered robe reached out without hesitation and, to everyone's surprise, gripped the sharp edge of the spear. Vibrant rainbow light rippled from his palm.

Floating Light Gathering!

Heavenly Glow was naturally good at knocking down and seizing objects. Tuoba Chongyuan’s focus had been split and he had been bombarded by spells, so he naturally had to loosen his grip slightly to absorb the blows. Li Xizhi saw the opening and closed in with Gold In Cloud to snatch the weapon.

An instant later, Tuoba Chongyuan felt a sudden lightness in his hand. His half-relaxed grip gave way completely. The scene before him spun briefly, and his spear was already in Li Xizhi’s hands!

The spear felt cool to the touch; it was smooth and solid. It was made from extremely tough material, and Li Xizhi could feel spiritual energy surging from within. It was a top-grade dharma artifact, only comparable to his own Qingche Sword.

Li Xizhi drew back with the spear, but blood instantly split his palm open in several places. His skin was torn to the bone and bled freely down to his wrist. Yet he was already forming a spell gesture with the other hand. His middle and ring fingers curled into his palm, and the rest extended like a cauldron.

His face went pale as he shouted, “Senior Yu!”

Yu Yuwei was genuinely startled, but he was quickly elated. His eyebrows shot up with excitement as he cried out, “Good!”

The purple cauldron immediately surged forward. Even without Yu Yuwei’s orders, Quan Yi and the other disciples launched fierce attacks at Tuoba Chongyuan, forcing him to lose the chance to take back his spear.

A furious surge of indignation, like capsizing in a gutter, filled Tuoba Chongyuan’s heart. He was so enraged he nearly lost control of the spell he was about to complete.

His brows shot up, and he roared like spring lightning, “How dare you?!”

White light flared In his other hand, transforming into six white ribbons trailing long tails. Astonishingly, he withstood the barrage of spell arts with just a wave of his sleeve, while he threw a strike toward Li Xizhi with his other hand.

Six dazzling beams of white light sizzled through the air. Li Xizhi barely managed to cast Gold In Cloud, part of his Heavenly Glow escape spell. His figure shifted dozens of meters to the side, forcing the six streaks of white light to arc low. Meanwhile, the dharma seal in his hand was already complete.

Calamity Dispelling Heart Cauldron!

The very first spell art Li Xizhi had learned after joining the sect was this life-saving technique. Now, a faint cauldron of Heavenly Glow manifested in his hands as he poured all his mana into it without restraint. He even drew in surrounding spiritual energy in torrents to fuel his spell art.

The streaks of white light were astonishingly fast. Even though Li Xizhi had shifted to the other side of the battlefield with his escape spell, the white light reversed direction instantly and shot toward him. The beams paused for a moment before plunging directly into the Heart Cauldron in his hands.

Boom!

A chaotic blast of white light erupted in the sky. The spell art in Li Xizhi’s hands held for three full breaths before he flung it away like it was scalding him. But it exploded uncontrollably before he could make his own escape. The sound of bones cracking echoed loudly as he tumbled downward at an angle, coughing up blood.

Purple flames poured down like boiling water, dousing Tuoba Chongyuan’s head and face. Thick white mist burst upward as he lost his grip on his dharma artifact. He was forced to raise both hands to block the massive purple cauldron.

A deep violet-red blood lined Yu Yuwei’s lips, dripping down his white beard as streams of deep blue water and purple flame struck simultaneously.

The elder’s eyes flared with brilliance as he shouted, “Hyah!”

Golden light flickered from his mouth again and vanished into the air. Tuoba Chongyuan’s eyes were bloodshot as his robes rippled wildly. One hand was braced against the searing purple cauldron, filling the air with the scent of scorched flesh, yet his expression remained unchanged.

His other forearm was hooked by two golden cords, which was yanking Quan Yi off balance. The blue water turned into cords that tightly bound his wrists. The three of them worked in concert, not only preventing Tuoba Chongyuan from sweeping his sleeve to dispel spells but even stopping him from forming a single hand seal.

Crackle—snap—

More searing purple flames coiled around his neck, filling the air with the scent of charred flesh. Yet Tuoba Chongyuan continued to crane his neck upward, expression both calm and ruthless, eyes wide as if desperately watching for something.

Crack!

A loud, crisp sound of bone snapping rang out as Tuoba Chongyuan forcibly twisted his own neck to a grotesque angle. His white teeth snapped open and shut with sharp cracks as he panted.

Clang!

His white teeth were freshly stained with blood as he bit down hard on a golden leaf-shaped object. It struggled fiercely between his jaws, producing a grating, tooth-rattling screech that made Yu Yuwei’s expression grow grim.

Boom!

The golden leaf-shaped object lingered for a moment before crumbling into dust and vanishing. White patterns surfaced across Tuoba Chongyuan’s body, and he even had the leisure to laugh.

He said, "Old Daoist, I told you, Sand-Swallowing Sword Nourishment isn't meant to be used like that!"

Golden light flickered like threads of mist between Tuoba Chongyuan's lips and teeth. Suddenly, Quan Yi threw his head back and screamed in agony. The back of his neck was drenched in blood, and he dropped like a bird with broken wings.

The golden cords slackened and Tuoba Chongyuan slowly twisted his dislocated neck back into place, each movement accompanied by loud cracking sounds. The many spell arts surrounding him gradually faded, and gold-red blood flowed back into his wounds along the lines of his skin.

He used The Great Liang Shengle Immortal Yin Art...

The markings on his body became clearer, stretching along the contours of his muscles and bones. Only now did a sinister, eerie aura begin to emerge around him. Naturally, Yu Yuwei couldn’t stand by idly. He thrust the massive cauldron forward to strike.

Boom!

Tuoba Chongyuan gestured gently, and the massive seal in the sky finally responded, crashing down and striking the purple-red fire cauldron with a thunderous bang.

Pfft!

Yu Yuwei's face went pale in an instant. The cauldron flew back, its brilliance dimming. It hovered midair, unmoving, as he struggled for breath for a long moment.

A second later, a pale Li Xizhi rose back into the air. One of his arms was swollen with shattered bones and torn muscles, but he didn’t care. He swallowed another Autumn Convergence Pill.

Taking a single Autumn Convergence Pill usually required years of rest, and if more were taken recklessly, it could shorten one’s lifespan by several decades. The limit was three at once, or else the Immortal Foundation could collapse. But given the current situation, there was no time to worry.

Li Xizhi consumed the pill and waited for his mana to replenish, his gaze heavy and dark.

Crack... crack... crack...

The massive seal in the sky gradually lost its radiance. Streams of white and yellow light cascaded down like a waterfall and poured into Tuoba Chongyuan’s body. Dense, inky-black patterns climbed across his form, spreading thick and fast.

Though Li Xizhi still felt some tightness in his chest, the pill gradually restored him. Watching closely, he confirmed that the surrounding barriers were weakening and dissipating as the seal’s glow faded. So, he waited calmly for the right moment.

Tuoba Chongyuan finally opened his eyes and glanced at the spear in Li Xizhi’s hand. His face shimmered with white and golden hues, and his voice rang like a bell and drum, “In all these decades, only you have dared to seize my dharma artifact... Good...”

Tuoba Chongyuan’s expression was neither jealous nor admiring, but rather excited. Yu Yuwei’s face grew increasingly grim, while behind him, Quan Yi wobbled back into the air. A large portion of his face was missing, and his breath was barely a whisper.

The spell art from Tuoba Chongyuan had shattered most of his cheek and exited through the back of his neck. Though the vitality of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was strong, despair filled his eyes. He floated unsteadily, blood dripping into the air and turning into faint auspicious mist as it scattered.

Yu Yuwei remained silent. Tuoba Chongyuan's gaze shifted slightly as the purple cauldron reappeared, and the rainbow light shot forth once more. Tuoba Chongyuan extended both arms, but struck with one palm, sending the cauldron shuddering violently.

Yu Yuwei’s face turned pale as various streams of mana intertwined in the air. A barely holding on Quan Yi struggled into the sky amid the overlapping lights of magical power. He scanned the area blearily through a half-blinded eye. The great seal above had dimmed, and though the surrounding barrier had thinned, it still stood tall.

If only I had known! thought Quan Yi.

Quan Yi stood in the center, and a long, muffled sigh escaped his ruined mouth. His Immortal Foundation was aligned with Auspicious Qi, a path called Scroll of Fortunate Attainments. He had divined a deadly tribulation awaiting him in the North long ago.

But what use was foresight? It was bound to come. Who among those who had ventured to the North would not face no life-and-death tribulation? In the end, whether it had been foreseen or not made no real difference.

Quan Yi opened his eyes wide and gazed at the great seal, then let out a heaven-shaking, earth-shattering wail, “Fellow Daoists—my mother still remains in the sect!”

His words hung in the air as his entire body transformed into dense layers of golden radiance and lit up the sky. Decades of cultivation in the Scroll of Fortunate Attainments Immortal Foundation were, in an instant, converted by some secret technique into a rune-laced burst of brilliance that shot heavenward.

The dense glow spread out, falling gently over Li Xizhi and Yu Yuwei and bathing their faces and bodies. They felt like they were standing on clouds as their breaths eased and hearts calmed. All of their dharma artifacts trembled slightly.

Be it the purple fire cauldron, the jade tablet thrown by Tuoba Chongyuan, or even the Xia You weapon in Li Xizhi’s hand, all were veiled in a shimmering glow. Li Xizhi and Yu Yuwei were relatively unaffected, but Tuoba Chongyuan clearly frowned as his vision was obscured.

His perception technique had already been shattered, and now his vision was clouded by the brilliance born from a lifetime’s cultivation. He truly couldn't see clearly.

Yu Yuwei sighed and said, “Let’s go!”

The two exchanged a glance and struck together, seizing this brief moment of Tuoba Chongyuan’s distraction and the shrouding of the great seal, and directed their combined power at the barrier.

Crack!

The barrier had already thinned to a mere veil. Their joint attack shattered it instantly, and they shot out of the formation.

Realizing this, Tuoba Chongyuan launched his escape light and tread upon white-yellow qi to pursue.
