# Chapter 1135: Returning Home

White light shimmered within the immortal cave, suffused with a lingering, clear qi.

On the jade platform sat a youth, his long hair undone. An azure mark had surfaced between his pristine white brows. He exhaled slowly, and as if emerging from another lifetime, he opened his eyes. He stared at the swirling clear qi before him, remaining silent for a long time.

The azure sword rested on his lap.

Li Jiangchun had been in seclusion for a very long time, and his senses were still hazy.

The moment he grasped that azure sword, it felt as though he had fallen into a fable. He experienced countless eons, studied innumerable ancient texts, and attained a sudden, profound enlightenment. He had gained this sword, yet the experience left him feeling displaced, as if an entire age had passed.

He slowly raised his hand. As his palm lay flat, a speck of azure light appeared.

This azure speck was like a darting fish, like a wisp of clear breeze. It circled and leaped, pulsing in his palm, shimmering like moonlight that threatened to dissipate at any moment.

'Sword Intent...'

This intent was precisely what he had comprehended from that single sword—it was called [Azure Homeland]!

'My cultivation base didn't progress much... but this was worth it, no matter what...'

He, Li Jiangchun, had spent the better half of his life immersed in the sword. Sword Intent was the highest Dao-fruit a sword cultivator could seek in their lifetime. He had naturally yearned for it, yet now that he had manifested it overnight, he felt none of the joy he had imagined.

'This sword may have originated from Moon Palace, and I may have adapted it to my own temperament, but its attainment was not my own achievement.'

He was a genius in the Way of the Sword and had cultivated his Sword Origin for many years; he had only been a single step away from Sword Intent. This sword had helped him take that final step, yet it left him feeling hollow. The Way of the Sword was a personal path. Relying on an external force made it fundamentally different.

'It's still unstable, but I've achieved it. Still... this Sword Intent... it's ultimately different from my true, original path.'

If his lifetime of cultivation in the Way of the Sword was a spiritual root, then this new Sword Intent was its fruit. But it was a fruit rooted in the countless experiences that had flooded his mind when he grasped the sword, not from his own growth. Though the root had borne fruit, Li Jiangchun felt a lingering sense of dissatisfaction...

He remained silent for a long time before turning his hand and dispersing the [Azure Homeland Sword Intent]. He closed his eyes, and after a moment, his pale palm once again rippled with a faint white light. It drifted back and forth, gradually condensing.

This white light was quite different from the azure. It was as ethereal as moonlight, yet it shifted to form a small bird, flying and soaring. It seemed faint and unstable, on the verge of being assimilated and scattering completely.

This was the [Crescent Moon Sword Origin] he had cultivated for so many years!

The youth stared at the Sword Origin in his hand, and a vague, new idea formed in his mind:

'They seem like different fruits from the same branch... If I continue to pursue this path... could it be possible... to manifest [Crescent Moon] into its own Sword Intent?!'

...

Moongaze Lake.

A heavy snow had just begun to fall. A resplendent carriage streaked across the pure white sky, its long banners fluttering and its profound light casting reflections below. It landed swiftly by the shore, startling a flock of sparrows into flight.

A purple curtain swayed, and a handsome, scholarly man adjusted his silver-white crown before stepping down onto the snow. His black and white spiritual boots made soft crunching sounds as they met the fresh powder.

Li Jiangliang raised his brows, his expression complex and filled with emotion.

'Moongaze Lake... It's been so many years...'

He helped his wife down from the carriage and saw a person waiting for them in the snow. The man was dressed in red robes, adorned with gold and silver, and had a fan hanging from his waist. His face was bright and welcoming. He held the hand of a woman behind him, whose willow-like brows were slightly lowered, giving her a gentle and pleasant appearance.

Li Jiangliang quickly bowed.

"Junior greets Fifth Uncle... and Aunt! We have troubled you to come out..."

"Eh..."

Li Zhouming laughed heartily and casually pulled him closer.

"You've made quite a name for yourself out there. These days, you're the Emissary of the True Light Cloud and the Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace. How could you not deserve the welcome? This... this must be the Eldest Princess?"

At his words, Yang Tianyou, who was standing behind, quickly bowed as well and offered some pleasantries. Li Jiangliang, however, just smiled mysteriously. He turned slightly and gestured for Li Zhouming to look.

"Uncle, please look!"

In the carriage behind them, the colors within were dark. The curtain was lifted, revealing a middle-aged man dressed in black.

Li Zhouming looked, and he froze.

The man had long brows and sharp, narrow eyes. His profile was strong and capable, marked by a few faint scars. He had wide shoulders and a thick chest. His wrists and ankles were bound tightly with black cloth strips, like one of the rogue cultivators from the martial world, giving him an air of keen competence.

He placed one foot in the snow, bracing the other against the carriage, and stamped the snow from his boot. As he stepped down calmly, Li Zhouming finally noticed the gold and white bow slung across his back.

He saw a familiar shadow in this man. That aura of restrained danger, that calm and unhurried demeanor... it was somewhat reminiscent of his own King Wei.

'It's just that Elder Brother is steady and heavy; his danger is hidden within his heart. This man's eyes are grim and sharp, yet full of spirit. He inspires awe at first glance.'

Li Jiangliang smiled but didn't make an introduction. Instead, he turned to the man.

"My lord..."

The man in black raised his brows and stepped forward.

"Lord Duke, you are too kind."

Before Li Zhouming could speak, the man looked his way.

"And this is..."

Li Jiangliang smiled.

"This is my Fifth Uncle, the Daoist Master's grandson!"

Even having never met him, how could Li Zhouming not understand who this man was? The scrutiny on his face instantly melted into delighted surprise. He beamed.

"So, it is you, my lord, who has returned! This is wonderful... wonderful! The Old Master's wish can finally be fulfilled!"

The middle-aged man in black was, of course, Li Yuanqin!

Faced with this elder who had been gone for so many years, Li Zhouming's own feelings of sorrow and joy were not profound. His first thought was of Li Xuanxuan, and for that, he was overjoyed. A look of urgency crossed his face.

"Excellent... truly excellent! Come, everyone, follow me!"

Thus, they rode the clouds and mist, treading on light and fire, and flew hurriedly toward the mountain peak rising from the lake. They passed through layer upon layer of palaces until a great hall, shimmering with golden light and overlapping pavilions, came into view.

Li Zhouming, however, stopped. He lowered his gaze and said,

"The Old Master is getting on in years, and his health hasn't been good. He has been taking medicine these past few days, so he must not be disturbed by too much noise. Shouyu, why don't you take our two guests to request an audience with King Wei first? I will lead our lord to pay respects to the Old Ancestor."

Hearing this, Li Jiangliang's expression turned grave. He pinched his fingers as if calculating, then sighed.

"Of course... How insensible of me. When I return this time, I must make a point to find some spiritual items for him."

Xia Shouyu always knew how to give her husband face in front of others. She nodded with gentle obedience and led the other two away. Li Zhouming then led Li Yuanqin up the steps.

As they walked, Li Yuanqin said, "My adopted son is still behind, leading the convoy with the court's rewards for King Wei. We should have someone fetch him, so he can also pay his respects to the Old Master."

"Yes..."

The two stepped into the great hall. The old man was already waiting in the courtyard.

Since returning from the Eastern Sea, Li Xuanxuan felt his spirit and body were much improved. That vital energy had been renewed, and he had once again thrown himself into managing the family's affairs, catching up on all the news he had missed and seeing all the people he couldn't during his illness.

When he heard Li Jiangliang was returning to the lake, Li Xuanxuan, who was already deeply concerned about matters in the imperial capital, was naturally eager to see him. He paced anxiously, and the moment he saw movement, he strode down from the main seat. He never expected that when the golden doors opened, the one who entered would not be Li Jiangliang.

The man had a middle-aged appearance, dressed in practical black. His expression was steady, but his eyes held a fierce light. The bow on his back, glinting gold and white, was exceptionally striking.

Li Yuanqin remembered Li Xuanxuan. When he had returned to the lake with his mother all those years ago, everyone had been kind, but there was an unavoidable sense of distance. Only this uncle had held him and wept, mourning his father's death, his pain all-consuming...

Therefore, in this clan where so much had changed, Li Yuanqin respected and loved him most. The look he gave him now was warm, tinged with a smile.

But as he looked back, the old man sucked in a sharp breath. His heart seized, and he was momentarily speechless.

'Xuanfeng...'

But the voice that echoed in the hall was one of respect.

"Nephew greets Uncle!"

That single sentence sent hot tears streaming down the old man's face. He instantly realized the difference between this man and his second younger brother. Li Xuanfeng's fierceness had been that of an old sword stained with blood, a weapon that had taken lives. His steadiness came from having weathered every storm, merely waiting for death, a sharp light shining from within the gore. No matter how much this man resembled him, he ultimately lacked that killing aura.

He helped Li Yuanqin up, his voice thick with tears.

"I finally get to see you... How is your mother? And your... your wife..."

Li Yuanqin lowered his gaze, his voice strained.

"Mother has been living in seclusion in recent years and is unwilling to travel. She only wished for me to send her greetings... As for my wife, she perished during a breakthrough."

Li Xuanxuan was startled from his reverie. He led Li Yuanqin to a seat, but Li Yuanqin would not sit while bearing his late father's relic. He carefully took [White Lightning] from his back, held it level with both hands, and presented it to Li Xuanxuan.

The old man said nothing for a long time. He clutched the dharma artifact, weeping and murmuring to himself, before reverently placing it on the main seat. He sat to the side, taking a moment to collect his emotions before looking at Li Yuanqin. He asked several times about his recent situation, then hesitated for a moment before raising his brows.

"I've mentioned it many times... This branch of the family is thin, with only your father's line. I've worried about it year after year, so much that it's become a sickness in my heart... It wasn't proper for me to press the issue, but I often sent letters to the Southern Borderlands..."

"I never imagined your father's talent would be so good, and yours is no less. Your father, and you... both could be called the best of your generation, your cultivation advancing faster than anyone... You never had the chance to establish more branches... It's good that you are finally willing to see the line continued."

Li Yuanqin nodded silently.

"I have troubled Elder with worry."

The most important reason for Li Yuanqin's return to the clan was to adopt an heir. Hearing his words, Li Xuanxuan sighed.

"There is no rush. Since you have returned, you should get to know the various branches, meet the juniors, and let them get to know you... You must choose someone you know well, and someone you like."

Li Yuanqin could only nod. Just then, the hall doors opened, and a man entered. He was tall and carried himself with a heroic air. He approached and bowed.

"Greetings, Father, and Lord!"

Only then did Li Yuanqin speak formally.

"The Ning clan also places great importance on the matter of inheritance. The Daoist Master personally selected this child for me. He is now named Li Fuchao. I brought him here for you to see, my lord."

Li Xuanxuan studied the young man for a few moments, had him speak, and asked several questions. Li Yuanqin then said in a low voice,

"He is from Ning Heyuan's line. That man once visited the lake and was always on good terms with Father. Elder Sister Li Qinghong should also know of him."

Hearing this, Li Xuanxuan finally relaxed. They left the hall together and went to the ancestral hall.

The hall was deathly quiet, with incense smoke curling past shining golden characters. Li Xuanxuan personally cleaned this place most of the time. There were six rows of tablets, arranged by height, shrouded behind deep curtains.

Li Yuanqin followed the old man in kowtowing. He looked closely at the spirit tablets. His father's was in the fourth row, standing clearly in the center, bearing the characters he himself had written all those years ago. The space to its left was empty, presumably reserved by the old man for himself.

He glanced down. In the fifth row, he could see the tablet for Li Yuanping, the father of Daoist Master Zhaojing. But with just that one glance, a sliver of doubt rose in his heart.

'The space beneath Father's tablet is a bit wide...'

He remained silent. Li Xuanxuan had someone bring a vermilion brush and the clan register, which was covered by a red cloth. The old man seemed to hesitate and did not uncover it. Instead, he led Li Fuchao forward and said with great solemnity,

"Since the Li clan was consolidated by Li Jingtian, you are the only person to have been granted this surname. I hope you will guard your temperament, hold to the righteous path, and never bring defilement to our house... Come. Kowtow!"

The man kneeling below, his face flushed with emotion, prostrated himself fully on the ground.

"This junior will absolutely not disappoint you, my lord!"

...

The heavenly light was brilliant.

On Gardenia Scenery Mountain, white petals drifted through the air. Li Zhouwei sat quietly on the main seat, gazing at the two people bowing on the floor before him. A slight smile touched his lips.

"Rise. There is no need for such formality."

Only then did Li Jiangliang raise his head and rise respectfully. Yang Tianyou also lifted her head, moved to the table, and with a slender hand, picked up the jade pot. She filled a cup, held it reverently, and raised it past her brows.

"On our wedding day, we were unable to invite Father. This junior was deeply unsettled, and my husband also reprimanded me, saying that with Father-in-law not present, how could the marriage be proper? We make up for it today... Please, Father, accept this tea."

Li Zhouwei did not make things difficult for her. He casually accepted the cup, completing the simple rite, and took a small sip.

"I was in seclusion at the time, preoccupied with many things. It was an unfortunate delay."

He tilted his chin, his golden eyes calm, and looked at Li Jiangliang.

"Among all the brothers, Jiangliang is the one who most follows the rules and knows right from wrong. His heart is more upright than his older brothers. I only worried he might suffer for it in the south."

Yang Tianyou bowed respectfully.

"Father, rest assured. The Emperor places great trust in my husband, viewing him as an indispensable minister..."

She raised her brows and smiled, a deeper meaning in her eyes.

"My lord handles all matters perfectly. When I saw the Old Ancestor, he also mentioned the great defeat of the Buddhists, saying it was extremely mighty."

Li Zhouwei remained noncommittal and did not reply to her. Li Jiangliang lowered his gaze and said, "You'er, the Old Master's residence should be prepared by now. Why don't you go see him first? I will be along shortly."

Yang Tianyou's expression settled, and she nodded, withdrawing silently. The mountain peak grew quiet. Li Jiangliang remained motionless for a long time. Li Zhouwei gave a rare smile.

"Well? What matter could be so important as to bring you personally to the lake?"

Li Jiangliang, standing one step below him and to the side, bowed solemnly.

"Your son has an urgent matter to report!"

At these words, Li Zhouwei's expression also sobered. He listened as Li Jiangliang spoke, his face complex.

"Father, your victory in the Western Sea has greatly enhanced your reputation, but that spiritual object was not simple... I have heard fragments and whispers, which led to some speculations. I came urgently to report them."

Li Zhouwei already had his own suspicions. He frowned.

"Is this about the Lesser Yang matter?"

Li Jiangliang nodded grimly.

"The item that the demon beast acquired was passed down from a cultivator of the Comprehending Profoundity orthodoxy. Their Dao Lineage is called the [Xiyang Temple]..."

"The founder of this [Xiyang Temple] was originally a cultivator at the Lesser Yang Auxiliary Position. He was a disciple of Comprehending Profoundity's first disciple, the very first master of Lesser Yang, and is thus revered as their founder. The [Xiyang Temple]'s Dao Lineage in the mortal world is the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect!"

Li Zhouwei had, in fact, anticipated this. He remained impassive.

"I will ask you only one thing: Is Yin Qin one of Comprehending Profoundity's people?"

Li Jiangliang was stunned for a second before lowering his gaze.

"Father is sharp. While there are no great figures backing him, if you trace his origins, he does indeed belong to their mortal Dao Lineage."

Li Zhouwei's expression grew heavy. He listened as Li Jiangliang continued quickly,

"That Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant was a gift from the Emperor of Liang. It is an object of Lesser Yang consummation. While nothing seemed amiss at the time, after the fall of Lesser Yang, many of the great lords began to suspect... that this item... is connected to a contingency plan left by the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch."

"A contingency plan?"

Li Zhouwei was noncommittal. The item had shown no reaction under the Immortal Mirror's probe, so it surely couldn't be a major contingency... If he had to name a contingency, he would sooner think of something far more suspicious.

'That demonic evil that possessed Fuxun... that was very likely a method of Xiyang, attempting to escape confinement...'

He frowned.

"If it's a contingency plan, then what is Comprehending Profoundity playing at? Do they wish ill upon their own True Monarch?"

A look of dread appeared on Li Jiangliang's face. He organized his thoughts before speaking in a low voice.

"The Lesser Yang Demon Monarch Kuaili of Great Liang was originally a cultivator from the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect. But he obtained a demonic inheritance and plotted for a long time. He took advantage of the moment the Lesser Yang Immortal Lord of that era ascended to the [Purple Pavilion Palace] and departed, leaving the Fruition Attainment vacant. In a single stroke, he bypassed the [Xiyang Temple] and seized the Fruition Attainment for himself."

"At the time, the entire [Xiyang Temple] was shocked and furious, utterly disbelieving. But while His origins were low, He was still considered a Comprehending Profoundity cultivator. Furthermore, the Dao of Enduring Malice had also been established by a Comprehending Profoundity cultivator. Since He had already taken the Fruition Attainment, they had no choice but to hold their noses and acknowledge Him."

"Afterward, this Demon Monarch repeatedly profited from several great upheavals, and His cultivation advanced immensely... He once suppressed all other cultivators, and the Comprehending Profoundity cultivators naturally began to change their attitude, eventually holding Him up as their poster child."

He finished with a strained voice, "It's just... I heard them say that His relationship with the other great lords... was not good."

"This matter is technically concluded, but your son's heart remains uneasy. I was afraid that our family, upon seeing the Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant, might have other plans for it... and end up getting entangled in this..."

His words were already extremely tactful. Li Zhouwei was silent for a moment, not answering immediately. Instead, he seized on another point of doubt.

"If that's the case, why did Comprehending Profoundity clean up the demon beast's mess back then? They could have just gone with the flow and allowed the spiritual object to be destroyed naturally. Why go back and forth like this? Isn't that just causing trouble for themselves?"

Li Jiangliang had clearly not considered this question before he arrived. He thought hard for a moment, then said haltingly,

"The inner workings of the Comprehending Profoundity path... I do not know the fine details. In ancient times, if two True Monarchs ever emerged from the same Dao-path, it would immediately split. Even a single Dao Lineage can have internal conflicts, to say nothing of the countless figures operating under the Comprehending Profoundity banner..."

"Moreover, Comprehending Profoundity has always followed the principle that those on the mountain do not meddle in mortal affairs. If we are to be strict about it, Daoist Qu's involvement was already against their own rules..."

Li Zhouwei, however, did not let his guard down. His thoughts ran deep.

'From start to finish, Yin Qin was verbally trying to persuade me not to destroy the plant. He seemed to be in great distress. Yet, just as he was leaving, he decisively destroyed that precious land himself...'

If not destroying the plant didn't align with his true interests, then his actions must have served some other purpose.

'Saving face. Fulfilling an obligation.'

His mind cleared, and he began to form a hypothesis.

'If Jiangliang is correct, and if the Great Liang founded by Kuaili truly doesn't align with Comprehending Profoundity's ideals... it means there is genuine conflict. In that case, even though they are all part of Comprehending Profoundity, the lords in the heavens might not want to see Lesser Yang return.'

'But right at this moment... a suspected Lesser Yang contingency appears. They would certainly want it eliminated.'

So where was the difficulty?

Judging from Daoist Qu's actions, the [Xiyang Temple] had, by the end, clearly sided with the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch. A Demon Monarch who had cultivated for so many years would surely control his own Dao Lineage. His followers had to look to Kuaili's whims to cultivate; those who remained must have been his staunchest supporters.

It was hard to say if these supporters had a True Monarch backing them, but most were likely still at Mount Luoxia. And even without them, Kuaili was still a Demon Monarch officially recognized by Comprehending Profoundity, from within their own tradition. The lords above could not afford to be so brazen in their actions.

'So, they needed someone else to cut down this tree for them. And this person had to be someone involved in "mortal affairs," someone they couldn't easily stop. It's even possible Yin Qin's orders were to protect this plant at all costs. But he knew the true intentions of his superiors, leaving him trapped for years, damned if he acted and damned if he didn't...'

'That's it. That's why Yin Qin looked so reluctant... when in reality, he was overjoyed. He could go back and report: [King Wei insisted on destroying the tree!]'

But was that all?

Li Zhouwei's thoughts quickly circled back to his own position.

'And the message from Suining was to eliminate this spiritual root... he mentioned that specifically. This wasn't a case of them passively borrowing my hand. I suspect I was the one actively taking a stance!'

'A stance declaring that the powers behind me, Li Zhouwei, are also unwilling to see the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch return.'

With that, it all clicked into place.

'It's because I represent the remnant power of the Immortal Mansion line. The one backing me, placing their bets, is the person behind Qingyu Qian!'

'The Lesser Yang Demon Monarch fell at the hands of Lord Yingze. But Lord Yingze has been missing for many years, quite possibly having gone beyond the heavens. Even though the remaining Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is fractured and its factions fight among themselves, they would never want to see the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch make a comeback!'

The gold in his eyes turned dark and heavy.

'So that's how it is. If I cut down the plant, no one bats an eye. But if I don't cut it down... the implications become very complicated.'

He raised his brows and smiled.

"Are they afraid I'll side with Comprehending Profoundity?"

Li Jiangliang immediately stepped away from his spot and bowed low, his head down in silent admission.

He was right.

Comprehending Profoundity disliked the idea of Kuaili returning to meddle in the mortal world. But how could the Underworld not be on guard? The Demon Monarch's power was immense. If Comprehending Profoundity was playing a double game—saying one thing publicly while secretly preparing for the revival of Lesser Yang—the balance of power between the two great forces could be shattered!

'When Yang Tianyou arrived, she called me "Father" in every sentence, except for that last one, "My lord handles all matters perfectly". And she just had to mention Yang Tianya. Was that "my lord"... truly referring to me?'

'If "my lord" referred to the power behind me, it means the Underworld was also extremely satisfied with my destruction of the spiritual root... And yet, someone among Them still suspects that I, Li Zhouwei, am secretly colluding with Luoxia!'

Kuaili was a figure Comprehending Profoundity disliked, but one the Underworld was actively vigilant against.

'In truth, if that day really comes, the Underworld is not unprepared... Why else would they cede the vast lands of Jiangnan entirely to the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition? Could it be a tacit agreement? The moment Comprehending Profoundity tries to use Kuaili, the four lords—Taiyi, Taiyue, Taiqing, and Taizhu—will immediately side with the Underworld.'

'And yet, the Underworld still dreads His return. Is it because their traditions are different? Or because it would invite new chaos? Or perhaps...'

Another, more terrifying answer surfaced in his mind.

'They believe that the four True Monarchs of Chongming Hall—four Azure Profoundity Golden Core masters wielding Dharma Treasures—even if they joined forces... still could not stop the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch who was dismembered a thousand years ago: Kuaili!'
