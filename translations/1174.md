# Chapter 1174: Awaiting the Supreme Divine

The Eastern Sea.

Waters shimmering with five hues surged at the foot of the mountains. In the heavens above, storm clouds churned. A Daoist Master, riding a ray of Lesser Yang light, flew eastward, deeper and deeper into the vast sea. After an unknown amount of time, an immortal mountain covered in crimson maple trees appeared on the horizon, and only then did he pause his flight.

"The Nine Mounds Daoist tradition, Spirit-Pacifying Moon-Clear Mountain."

The rider was none other than Guo Nanwu, a Daoist Master of the Lesser Yang Dao and the Purple Mansion Realm.

He had been commissioned by the Li clan to seek counsel from Nine Mounds. But this Daoist Master, though young, was a cautious man. He hadn't flown directly east. Instead, he had feigned a trip south to visit Mount Qusi, then veered deep into the Southern Sea, following the edge of the world eastward before finally taking a roundabout path to the Peacock Sea.

Guo Nanwu was truly troubled.

'King Wei’s power is renowned across the north and south, but his current injuries… who knows how many factions would rather he never recover? I am a minor cultivator from an unorthodox path. If I fall into the wrong hands, I'll be lucky to escape with my life, let alone my future on the Dao path.'

Working for the Li clan offered generous rewards and powerful backing, but it was not without its price. Guo Nanwu was a man of prudence by nature, and this clandestine journey had already cost him more than a month.

Yet upon arriving before the gates of the Daoist tradition, the young Daoist Master hesitated once more.

Over the entire entrance to Nine Mounds Mountain, strange phenomena roiled. Black and white energies intermingled as a celestial force gave birth to water, which fell like shimmering dew. The drops, silver-white like mercury, rained down across the entire sea, sinking like countless silver pearls into the depths.

Higher up, a wild, untamed fire blazed, held within the black clouds and compressed into a fiery orb like a massive alchemical pill. To one side, the shadows of souls crouched low, clutching nascent forms to their chests. To the other, a divine court stood desolate and empty, save for a torrential flood of liquid Cinnabar gushing from its gates, pouring down upon the world.

In all his hundred years, Guo Nanwu had never witnessed such a sight. He stared, utterly mesmerized, a deep suspicion rising in his heart.

'From the looks of this, it's either the successful cultivation of some profound Daoist art or the forging of an immortal artifact. To be blunt, it could even be the fall of a Daoist Master… How could they possibly allow me to enter?'

He stood there hesitating for three breaths when a figure emerged, riding the wind. The man wore a tall crown and white robes, his features strikingly handsome. Stepping upon the rising flames, he smiled.

"My elder foresaw your arrival and told me a guest from the Lesser Yang would arrive from the south as a divine ability was being forged. He sent me to welcome you. My name is Fu Chi. Please, Daoist friend, follow me into the mountain!"

Guo Nanwu’s gaze swept over him. The man’s aura blazed, yet the foundation of his divine ability seemed shallow; he must have achieved his breakthrough within the last five years. But filled with a healthy fear of Nine Mounds, Guo Nanwu would not dare to refuse. He quickly agreed and followed Fu Chi into the mountains. As they landed on the bluestone path, the ground was already blanketed in Cinnabar. Guo Nanwu spoke in a low voice.

"I have long heard of Nine Mounds' great name! I wonder… is Great Daoist Master Dantai on the mountain?"

Fu Chi flicked his sleeve and smiled.

"The Old Ancestor is away."

Guo Nanwu breathed a sigh of relief, but he understood the implication. He cupped his hands.

"So you are a descendant of the Dantai. Forgive my lack of respect!"

Fu Chi’s expression grew somewhat complicated.

"Though I am of Dantai blood, my Dao Lineage is with the Supreme Yang. The mainland is in turmoil, which is why I chose to have my breakthrough here. Since you have come from the west, Daoist friend, you must be familiar with the Azure Pond Sect. Daoist Master Yuanxiu is my master!"

Realization dawned on Guo Nanwu. A strange feeling settled in his heart, but he said little in response. Adjusting his collar, he followed Fu Chi up the mountain path and sighed,

"Truly an otherworldly immortal mountain."

By now, the storm of Cinnabar had grown more intense. Daoist Master Fu Chi produced an umbrella and escorted him forward until they reached the highest maple grove. There, he saw an old man seated beneath a tree.

A stone table glowed with an azure light, and upon it sat a single jade cup brimming with a blood-red spiritual elixir. Even with the sky full of Cinnabar and the light dim and heavy, nothing could conceal the multicolored halo radiating from the cup.

Fu Chi introduced him in a low voice,

"This is Daoist Master Lingdu."

Guo Nanwu hastily greeted him as 'senior'. The old man remained seated and smiled.

"Please, have some tea."

Guo Nanwu hesitated for a moment, about to ask his questions, but Lingdu simply waved a hand, signaling him to wait.

'I wonder… which prodigy of Nine Mounds is having a breakthrough!'

Left with no choice, the Daoist Master fell silent, watching as the various phenomena in the sky slowly faded and the colors dispersed. A single point of iridescent light shot straight down, pulling clouds and stirring the air, smashing into the mountainside and kicking up a cloud of white mist. Only then did a figure emerge from within.

It was a woman.

She had willow-like brows and eyes like stars, her face exceptionally beautiful. A point of light glowed between her brows, but it was her eyes—large, bright, and full of spirit—that truly captivated, elevating her entire presence with an air of exceptional, reserved beauty.

She wore a long dress of cloud-satin, free of any adornment. Her slender hands were held gracefully as she moved with an enchanting elegance. The brilliant, multicolored light on her brow was fading, coalescing into a solid vermilion mark.

This subtle change shifted the focus of her face from her brow to her almond-shaped eyes. The celestial light no longer stole the show. It was as if a divine maiden from an immortal realm had stepped into a Daoist court, becoming a true master who gathered heavenly energies and roamed free from worldly cares.

The Daoist Master walked to the grove, bowed slightly, and said,

"Greetings to the two seniors!"

Her voice was gentle and courteous. Guo Nanwu stared, momentarily stunned. He found her aura to be indistinct and unreadable, yet she felt strangely familiar.

'A Daoist Master of the Whole Pill path!'

Daoist Master Lingdu rose with a smile, picked up the cup of blood-red elixir, and presented it to her.

"Congratulations, Daoist friend, on achieving the Purple Mansion Realm. Please, drink this!"

The woman’s almond eyes blinked. She accepted the cup graciously.

"Senior, you are too kind!"

Beside them, Fu Chi’s eyes were filled with emotion. Reading the situation, he said warmly,

"This is Xuantang Pond Water. It can solidify one’s foundation, cultivate essence, and ward off malevolent forces. I also partook of it during my breakthrough. It is a tradition here at Nine Mounds. Please, do not stand on ceremony!"

"Thank you, senior!"

The woman’s vermilion lips pursed slightly, and the cup was empty. As she raised her head, the noble, reserved air vanished, replaced by a familiar visage. At last, Guo Nanwu dredged the face from his memories and cried out in shock.

"Que'wan? It's you! You're at Nine Mounds!"

This woman was none other than Li Que'wan, who had entered seclusion at Nine Mounds to achieve her breakthrough and master the divine ability 'Awaiting the supreme divine'!

Guo Nanwu couldn't help but be shocked. How many years did it take Li Zhouwei to reach his current level? How many for Li Jiangqian? And the woman before him—how many years had it taken her to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm?

'Senior Zhaojing’s achievement was unexpectedly swift. King Wei’s breakthrough to the divine ability stage was terrifyingly fast, happening within ten years. Changli’s ascension to the Purple Mansion Realm couldn't have taken more than fifteen years. I don’t know when she arrived at Nine Mounds, but at most, it couldn't have been more than twenty years!'

Forget ten or fifteen years; even a cultivator who reached the Purple Mansion Realm in twenty years was a rarity in the world!

The achievements of King Wei and his son could be attributed to their unique imperial bloodline. With the addition of the woman before him, the Li clan now had a fourth Purple Mansion cultivator. And this one was a Daoist Master of the 'Whole Pill' and 'Prime Virtue' path, a wielder of profound mercury arts—she was already a match for the Azure Pond Sect at its peak!

'King Wei is certain to overcome the Purple Mystery trial. That young master of his has an excellent chance as well. And this Li Que'wan, along with Daoist Master Zhaojing, can at least reach the middle stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. A genius that an ordinary Dao lineage might see once a century, a figure they would treasure to anchor their destiny—Ting Province alone has four of them!'

'What did that even mean?'

A Purple Mansion cultivator lived for five hundred years. If four such geniuses emerged in succession, with an orderly inheritance, they could protect a Dao lineage for well over fifteen hundred years. Even for those cultivators Beyond the Profound, it was enough time to foster a great Dao lineage renowned throughout the world.

And the Li clan, to this day, had a history of less than two hundred years… just a little longer than he, Guo Nanwu, had been cultivating!

The Lesser Yang cultivator was filled with a whirlwind of emotions. He gazed at the woman before him, a bitter taste in his mouth, and said softly,

"Ting Province's immortal fortune is truly flourishing, unequaled in all the world."

Li Que'wan had just consumed the Xuantang Pond Water. A chill lingered on her lips, which she suppressed into her sea of qi with her divine ability before taking a breath. The words were praise, but they sent a shiver through her.

The Li clan carried too many secrets and had always maintained a low profile. Even with the entire clan doing its utmost to minimize their influence, the world was in turmoil, and some things simply could not be hidden. She replied politely,

"The Bright Yang shines upon us all, bringing forth many opportunities. Without King Wei, this junior would never have had the chance to even approach the gates of the Purple Mansion Realm!"

Her words gave all credit to the Bright Yang. Daoist Master Lingdu stroked his beard and smiled.

"Zhaojing and the father and son of the Wei clan have indeed been greatly favored, and thus achieved the Dao. But you… since you cultivate the 'Whole Pill' path, there is no need for such humility."

These two sentences helped to settle Guo Nanwu's turbulent emotions.

Though still awed, he had calmed down. He seized the opportunity to sigh,

"It's just… King Wei's current situation… is truly grim!"

The moment he spoke, before Lingdu could even react, the woman with the vermilion mark on her brow turned her head sharply. Her gaze, filled with anxiety and worry, fixed on his face.

"What has happened to King Wei?"

"He killed Qi Lanyan! But unfortunately… he was afflicted by the calamity of Wu Earth…"

"What?"

Li Que'wan froze, a flash of pure shock in her eyes. As she listened to Guo Nanwu's hurried explanation, Daoist Master Lingdu began to ponder.

"Have you sought out the Chunyi Dao Gate?"

Guo Nanwu nodded.

"Daoist Master Zhaojing went to visit them immediately. Fearing that there might not be enough time, he sent me to come here concurrently."

Hearing this, Lingdu stood and paced a few steps among the trees, seemingly considering the matter on a deeper level, weighing his words. After a long moment, he spoke.

"My Nine Mounds follows the ways of Changtang; avoiding disasters and calamities is well within our means, and we have no shortage of Supreme Yin items. If King Wei has need, he can send someone to retrieve them. Normally, one would not require Supreme Yin to evade such a calamity, but against Wu Earth Flawlessness, clever methods like 'Manifestations Earth' or 'Renewing Wood' are useless. It must be confronted directly."

Though his tone was calm, the power and confidence he projected were palpable, making Guo Nanwu stare. Lingdu then turned his head, smiled at Li Que'wan, and said,

"I do have a proposal… Our daoist tradition possesses a Supreme Yin Ancient Spiritual Artifact. How about you take it back with you for him to try?"

A Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure!

At his words, the amazement in Guo Nanwu’s eyes deepened. Li Que'wan was stunned, and even Daoist Master Fu Chi looked aghast.

'In this age, Supreme Yin spiritual items are already incredibly rare, to say nothing of a Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure!'

The Nine Mounds Daoist tradition was known for being reserved, yet their every action revealed their extraordinary standing. Even so, none of them had expected Daoist Master Lingdu to offer a Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure so casually.

Li Que'wan grew pensive. She paused for a full second before speaking cautiously.

"Wouldn't that be too precious? For senior to offer such a profound treasure… I would be alone, ignorant of the treasure's history. I don't know if I could even transport it back to the mainland safely…"

Lingdu smiled a leisurely smile.

"Supreme Yin Spiritual Artifacts have been rare since primordial times. As Yin and Yang receded and spiritual materials vanished, even fewer have been forged. At the same time, there are few Supreme Yin cultivators. When a Supreme Yin Spiritual Artifact is occasionally discovered, a suitable owner cannot be found. It becomes a beautiful but impractical object, so others melt it down, perhaps to enhance other treasures or invigorate various Yin-aspected arts."

"Because of this cycle, any Supreme Yin artifact that has survived to this day is almost certainly a Spiritual Treasure—one that its owners could not bear to melt down. This is not unique to Supreme Yin… the 'Upper Rite' path, the 'Protecting Wood' path… most of the Dao lineages that have vanished from the world have only left Spiritual Treasures behind."

"It is naturally quite precious. If you were to ask me for a simple Supreme Yin Spiritual Artifact, I couldn't produce one on the spot…"

Li Que'wan nodded thoughtfully. Lingdu had already raised his hand. With a gentle flip, a ring the size of a copper coin appeared in his palm.

The object was thin and flat, perfectly translucent. Its surface was etched with faint silver patterns depicting indistinct, exquisite flowers and brocade. It looked unremarkable, yet a soft, gentle moonlight pulsed from it.

Guo Nanwu's pupils dilated. He scanned it several times with his spiritual sense and said hesitantly, "I… I can't see it clearly at all!"

Lingdu first chuckled, then spoke with a hint of regret,

"This item possesses infinite immortal might. It can merge with one's Dharma body, and in the hands of a Supreme Yin cultivator, it reveals four divine marvels! Unfortunately, in the hands of a cultivator from another path, it can only display its most shallow ability, 'Moon Reflection'. It's like two entirely different treasures. If it were not so, you could ride its 'Otherworldly Storage' marvel and travel the Great Void, and no one would ever be able to divine your whereabouts!"

"This isn't so strange," Guo Nanwu mused. "It's normal for a Spiritual Artifact to lose thirty or forty percent of its power when not wielded by someone of its own lineage. And the Supreme Yin is the ultimate path of concealment, so this helps avoid trouble…"

He paused, glancing at Li Que'wan's expression, then feigned a question as a deliberate reminder,

"In that case, wouldn't we need to find a Supreme Yin cultivator to activate the artifact? The risk of exposure and attracting unwanted attention would be another major problem!"

Hearing these words of caution, Li Que'wan felt no sense of difficulty. Instead, her eyes shone brightly. She looked at Lingdu and declared with conviction,

"Senior, why not let me try it first?"

Lingdu was slightly puzzled, but he confidently handed the immeasurably valuable treasure to her, even transferring its ownership. The newly ascended 'Whole Pill' Daoist Master closed her eyes for a moment to sense it. When she looked up, her eyes shimmered with a strange light.

"I'm afraid… it won't be that troublesome!"

In a single thought, a wave of color—crimson and silver interwoven, like liquid gold and iron—flowed from her delicate hand, dancing and shifting in endless transformations.

'The nature of things may change, as a Whole Pill becomes an artifact. Thus is the profound truth: the nature of the Dao is immutable!'

This was the divine ability 'Awaiting the supreme divine'!

As the divine ability circulated, the dim Supreme Yin artifact began to glow brightly, bursting forth with rich color. The ring, a Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure, actually melted like water. It surged up Li Que'wan's fingertips and, bit by bit, merged into her Dharma body.

Thick moonlight poured down, illuminating her fair face. Before the stunned gazes of the other Daoist Masters, the woman’s eyes slowly opened. In the pupil of her left eye, a tiny, perfect moon had appeared.

'Awaiting the supreme divine'.

It drew upon the nurturing power of the Whole Pill, gathered immortal light, nourished the body’s spiritual mansions, and refined golden mercury to forge the essence of heaven and earth. Upon its completion, the divine ability manifested a profound light, allowing her to seize control of the wondrous abilities of elixirs and artifacts.

Through this miraculous transformation of material nature, 'Awaiting the supreme divine' could not only unlock more of a Spiritual Artifact's power even if it wasn't from her own Dao lineage, but it could also forcefully command an obscure artifact—one that had not yet found its true master—to obey her will.
