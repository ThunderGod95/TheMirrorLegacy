# Chapter 454: The Hooked Serpent

Within the world of the mirror...

While Li Yuanjiao journeyed through the desolate mountain temples to Shanji Prefecture, Lu Jiangxian had read 131 manuals on Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques, 36 on Qi Cultivation Realm, and two on Foundation Establishment Realm.

All these manuals were piled on the desk in front of Lu Jiangxian, forming a small mountain before him.

Two more Foundation Establishment Realm techniques: Yi Wood Talisman Technique and Mountain Mist and Sea Technique, corresponding to the Dao foundations of Yi Wood Wholeness and Mist Yin Reversion...

The scrolls before Lu Jiangxian had already formed a small hill. He was carefully reading the Yang Nourishing Technique from Tu Longjian, which was the longest secret technique he had come across, truly broadening his horizons.

This is the first time I've encountered someone naturally endowed with fate...

Li Yuanjiao had spared Tu Longjian, largely because Lu Jiangxian had not intervened, allowing Li Yuanjiao to be swayed by his thoughts and let the man go.

Under the illumination of the mirror, Tu Longjian's aura was a bright crimson, his presence incredibly formidable. Though Li Yuanjiao could not see it, Lu Jiangxian observed it clearly.

If Tu Longjian had died at Li Yuanjiao's hands, thus disrupting the flow of fate and the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator traced it backward, it could have caused significant problems...

Lu Jiangxian had his fair share of encounters with many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. He knew they could not foresee every change in the world, nor could they monitor everyone constantly. However, having mastered the Life Divine Ability and formed alliances, they had a general sense of the forthcoming situation.

Li Yuanjiao was not supposed to discover this person. It was only because fate was no match for the immortal mirror that he did. If he had killed Tu Longjian and taken the Yang Nourishing Technique, it could have potentially ruined important plans of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

Though the alliance between the Xiao and Li families might lead the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to suspect Xiao Chuting, Xiao Chuting would naturally suspect the Li Family. However, Xiao Chuting was already walking on thin ice. Lu Jiangxian feared that the old man would not be able to withstand the pressure, and he also feared that some in the Purple Mansion Realm might directly suspect the Li Family.

But what exactly is this fate thing... it's vastly different from divine abilities, affecting others without leaving a trace!

Lu Jiangxian had watched as the crimson fate behind Tu Longjian swirled, transforming Li Yuanjiao's intent from one of murder to one of recruitment. Even Li Yuanjiao's own aura was later also tinged with crimson, but due to his growing suspicion, he forcibly changed what could have led to his family's ruin into a situation where they merely suffered financial loss to avoid greater disaster.

There's a hint of Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit here, almost like... two fates compromising with each other... But if Li Yuanjiao also has fate on him, why have I never seen it?

Is fate manipulating people, or are people manipulating fate..?

————

Li Yuanjiao flew leisurely on a cloud, the mist swirling around him as he traveled. He had recently acquired a new treasure, and he was so enamored with it that he could not bear to part with it. While he was carefully exploring its wonders, he had flown into the territory of the Profound Peak Gate without realizing it.

His mood was light and carefree, and he felt an inexplicable sense of relief, as if he had narrowly escaped disaster. This only strengthened his belief that Tu Longjian was indeed endowed with fate. He halted before the gate's formation and put away his artifact.

A few moments later, Kong Tingyun came out to greet him. She had changed into a set of pale yellow feathered robes, appearing much more formal than when they had last met. She smiled and greeted, "Brother Jiao has arrived! Tingyun has been waiting for quite some time."

Li Yuanjiao returned the gesture with a cupped fist, and Kong Tingyun said, "Fellow Daoist, come with me to Lake Xian; we can talk on the way."

The two of them ascended into the air, and Li Yuanjiao was the first to ask, "How did your faction fare at the sea entrance?"

Kong Tingyun smiled, her eyes curving as she replied, "We had a bountiful harvest for once. In such a major event as the division of the grotto heaven, even the crumbs that fall from Azure Pond's fingers are enough to satisfy us!"

Seeing no unusual expression on her face, Li Yuanjiao nodded, looking ahead at the vast, dark lake that reflected spots of golden light under the blazing sun. Kong Tingyun continued, "I fought with the Hooked Serpent once; it was difficult to deal with. It feared the immortal sect backing me, so it did not dare to go all out and quickly fled a hundred li away to settle in a new location... I was afraid of scaring it away, so I did not pursue it further."

"We should search separately. The Hooked Serpent has a family and is not hard to find. It will only take half a day of searching, but we must be cautious not to alarm this creature," she suggested.

Li Yuanjiao responded, "That won't be necessary."

He shook his head and descended onto the surface of the lake. Instantly, the water began to surge, and the faint movements of a serpent dragon could be seen beneath the waves, occasionally revealing half of its black scaly claws.

Before long, a dark blue crayfish jumped out of the water, curled up in fear, trembling as it was held aloft by the waves. Li Yuanjiao asked in a low voice, "Where is the Hooked Serpent?"

After listening closely, Li Yuanjiao tossed the crayfish back into Lake Xian and said with a smile, "Seventy-two li to the east, there's a desolate mountain in the middle of the lake... The Hooked Serpent is in seclusion there."

"I almost forgot about the abilities of your Boundless Ocean!" Kong Tingyun praised in awe.

The two of them ascended into the air again, and Li Yuanjiao asked, "You mentioned earlier that the Hooked Serpent was driven away by the Azure Water Serpent Dragon... What kind of creature is this Azure Water Serpent Dragon?"

Kong Tingyun replied, "I inquired about it at Crimson Reef Island overseas. The Azure Water Serpent Dragon is not particularly strong, but it was sent by a certain serpent dragon palace under the sea. It has a profound background and drove the Hooked Serpent away..."

Li Yuanjiao, still thinking about the nature of Foundation Establishment Realm creatures in the sea, asked in confusion, "Are there many creatures in the sea like this Hooked Serpent with no significant background?"

Kong Tingyun nodded and answered, "There are countless demonic creatures in the sea, and the Eastern Sea is full of demon dens... Not to mention the Eastern Sea, even Lake Xian has quite a few. The Hooked Serpent is simply the weakest among them."

As they conversed, the desolate mountain soon came into view in the distance. Kong Tingyun performed a hand seal, clouds and mist began to rise beneath their feet.

Li Yuanjiao whispered, "I have an aura restraining artifact."

Kong Tingyun's eyes lit up as she nodded in understanding and replied, "I will go first, and Brother Jiao can follow."

Li Yuanjiao watched as she rode the wind into the water, then activated the Profound Patterned Bottle to scan the surroundings. After ensuring there were no hidden people or creatures lying in ambush, he too descended into the lake.

The waters were already churning, with various fish and shrimp scattering in all directions in a desperate bid to escape.

Li Yuanjiao caught sight of the emerald-green formation plate before him and could not help but feel a twinge of envy as he thought to himself, As expected of the three sects and seven gates; even the formation plates they use are of the Foundation Establishment Realm...

He slowly approached with the formation trembling incessantly.

This woman is unlikely to collude with the demonic creature to kill me... With the mirror in hand, I'm not afraid.

And thus, he used the Profound Patterned Bottle to release a mist, concealing himself as he infiltrated the formation. There, he saw a massive, dirty serpent body, about two zhang thick and as large as a water tank with scales gleaming brightly, each as big as a palm.

The Hooked Serpent's voice trembled as it lamented, "I have cultivated for many years and was fortunate to consume several spirit beasts to achieve my current Dao foundation. I came to Lake Xian only to feed on spirit creatures and had no intention of offending anyone... Could you consider the difficulty of my cultivation and spare my life, my lady? I will leave immediately and never return to Lake Xian!"

Kong Tingyun, knowing that Li Yuanjiao had entered the formation, remained silent and maintained her efforts. Li Yuanjiao quietly advanced. Seeing that it could not persuade her, the Hooked Serpent growled harshly, "How arrogant you are, little girl! Do you think you can kill me with this formation? I might as well eat you and then flee to the depths of the Eastern Sea! Can Changxi really chase me down from thousands of li away to seek revenge?"

As the serpent spoke, Li Yuanjiao moved to within a zhang of the massive snake. Any closer and he might alarm the creature, so he gripped his sword and prepared to strike, waiting for the serpent to raise its head high before unleashing a sword arc.

Roar!

A flash of sword light flickered underwater, suddenly creating a burst of blood as it left a massive wound at the serpent's vulnerable point.

Kong Tingyun was momentarily stunned, then sighed and she marveled to herself, "What a brilliant sword technique..."

The black serpent dragon coiled upward, entangling itself with the Hooked Serpent. The serpent no longer had time to hate its opponent's treachery as Kong Tingyun's spells and Li Yuanjiao's sword qi continued to rain down on it, battering it repeatedly.

The Hooked Serpent, unsure of what immortal foundation the attack stemmed from, spat out two green beams of light. The two venomous hooks on its forked tail also sprang up right away.

Kong Tingyun laughed lightly and chirped, "I have been waiting for this!"

From her sleeve flew a small pale-gold pearl which wobbled as it flew over, releasing waves of golden light that pinned the serpent's tail in place. The two green beams were also blocked by her shield-shaped dharma artifact.

Kong Tingyun then said, "I will leave the rest to you, Brother Jiao!"

Using her artifact to immobilize the serpent's most threatening twin tails and fend off the creature, Kong Tingyun gave Li Yuanjiao the opportunity to move in closer with his sword.

The serpent was in dire straits, and as a last resort, it opened its mouth and spat out a pearl.

The pearl whirled around, emitting a stream of cold, white mist that froze the surrounding area, causing shards of ice to form. However, Li Yuanjiao's expression turned slightly strange.

He subtly curled his finger, activating his Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit, and instantly absorbed a small portion of the cold qi into his hand. He burst out laughing as he said, "What a fine serpent pearl! Too bad you do not understand techniques and can only use cold qi to defend yourself... It is quite amusing!"

With both hands cupped together, the cold qi continuously flowed into his hands, causing the white pearl to lose its rotation and gravitate toward him. A storm of white qi surged into his hands, leaving a narrow ice pillar in the water.

Disciples of immortal sects indeed possess many immortal techniques...

The Hooked Serpent, now in utter despair, had lost its serpent pearl.

Kong Tingyun threw out a golden mountain which pressed down on the serpent, further weakening it.

The serpent, now near death, cried out desperately, "There is only one portion of Nascent Origin True Water in the mountain's depths... How do you two plan to divide it?"

Hearing this, Kong Tingyun's expression changed dramatically, a slight hint of anger crossing her face. She performed a hand seal, causing the golden mountain to shine even brighter, crushing the serpent further until it coughed up blood.

The female cultivator scolded, "Stop spouting nonsense!"

Li Yuanjiao, noticing her reaction, immediately understood the situation. He took a few steps forward and seized the serpent pearl in his hand, then severed its connection with the creature and stored it in his storage pouch. He then said in a deep voice, "Fellow Daoist, dispel the formation quickly."
𝘧𝓇ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝘣𝓃ℴ𝓋𝑒𝑙.𝑐𝘰𝑚

As soon as these words left his lips, he was already standing in front of Kong Tingyun with one hand on his sword, his face full of vigilance. Kong Tingyun pursed her lips and dispelled the formation while Li Yuanjiao, without hesitation, grabbed the formation plate in his hand, finally letting out a small sigh of relief.

I fear she might let greed cloud her judgment and try to trap and kill me here. Although she certainly wouldn't stand a chance against me, offending Profound Peak Gate would be a major issue.

Li Yuanjiao quickly landed in front of the mountain and sealed the Hooked Serpent's Dao foundation. Only then did he turn back, speaking in a deep voice, "Care to explain, fellow Daoist?"

Kong Tingyun put away her pearl and golden mountain artifacts, saying apologetically, "I did indeed deceive you... Although the hooks on the serpent's tail are also something I need, the real goal was this Nascent Origin True Water."

She explained softly, "Profound Peak Gate has a secret method. Years ago, I noticed changes in the water veins and realized that a spirit water would soon be born here. Fearing it would be taken by someone else, I secretly concealed the water veins, intending to retrieve it later. This place was later unexpectedly occupied by the Hooked Serpent. I just wanted to find someone to help remove this demonic creature so I could obtain the spirit water..."

Li Yuanjiao, being well-versed in deception himself, did not feel particularly angry. After all, everyone relied on their own abilities. He nodded and said, "So, in truth, you never fought the Hooked Serpent. You already knew it was here, and all those previous actions were just to disguise this desolate mountain... And as for not seeking help from your fellow disciples, I assume it is because you were afraid they would see through your method of concealing the water veins?"

Kong Tingyun smiled and nodded, replying, "Exactly. Who would have thought that this demon serpent would also discover the spirit water? My efforts were in vain..."

The two exchanged glances, and Kong Tingyun spoke in a serious tone, "The Tail Hooks and the Nascent Origin True Water are both things I must obtain! I hope you can part with them, fellow Daoist..."

Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes slightly, lifting the weakened Hooked Serpent from the lake as he replied, "I want the Hooked Serpent and the serpent pearl, and I will need another portion of spirit water to compensate for my efforts."

Kong Tingyun shook her head and said, "You ask for too much, fellow Daoist. I do not have any other spirit water... Please, consider another reward..."

Li Yuanjiao pondered for a moment and then responded, "Does your gate have anyone who can cultivate a fire vein? I ask that you help my Li Family cultivate one."

Kong Tingyun smiled slightly and said, "We do have such people! My senior brother has already gone out, and when he returns in some time, he can visit your clan to cultivate a fire vein. But... Why are you so confident that I will not go back on my word?"

With this, Kong Tingyun's tone became slightly cunning as she blinked her large eyes and smiled at him.

Li Yuanjiao shook his head, pulled out a green formation plate from his storage pouch, and calmly said, "Your Foundation Establishment Realm formation plate is still in my hands, and I am sure it is worth much more than a fire vein."

Kong Tingyun was taken aback. She had not expected that he had already thought several steps ahead when he made his first move. She bit her lip as she glared at him, but then could not help but laugh, saying, "Li Yuanjiao, you are indeed the most cunning person I have ever met!"

Li Yuanjiao retrieved the formation plate, already calculating in his mind how he could maximize the benefits by borrowing this formation for a while. He responded, "You flatter me. Under Azure Pond's governance, those who are not cunning or ruthless are long dead."

Kong Tingyun smiled faintly, forming a hand seal as she silently searched for the spirit water. Li Yuanjiao took the opportunity to ask, "What kind of treasure is this Nascent Origin True Water?"

Kong Tingyun seemed to be in a good mood, humming a tune as she replied with a smile, "Brother Yuanjiao, this Nascent Origin True Water is a top-grade spirit water. You are cunning and decisive; I am actually afraid that if I tell you its use and value, you might turn around and rob me of it... With the formation still in your hands, this little girl is really quite scared."

Li Yuanjiao was momentarily taken aback, then backed off with a somewhat sheepish expression. Kong Tingyun glanced at him and asked softly, "Does your clan have any Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators? Perhaps someone with a similar temperament as you and has not yet married into the Xiao Family?"

Li Yuanjiao was baffled by this question and frowned.

"None."

Kong Tingyun sighed slightly, lowering her gaze as she began to lament, "I spent years in seclusion during my youth, and in the blink of an eye, more than forty years have passed. It is difficult to find a kindred spirit within the gate, and the few Foundation Establishment Realm male cultivators are really quite unremarkable..."

Li Yuanjiao immediately understood and offered some advice, "Choosing a Dao companion is something that must be done with great care. It is better to wait a little longer. The Dao is full of dangers, and if you choose a fool, it could bring disaster for three generations and ruin for a century—it is not something to take lightly."

"You're right," Kong Tingyun said as she bit her lip and continued softly, "The ancient times are distant and their records are lost; even in more recent history, there have been Dao Embryos who were harmed by the Dao companions in their family... How could we, mere small cultivators, claim to understand such matters? Perhaps remaining alone is the more prudent choice..."

Li Yuanjiao remained silent, which only deepened Kong Tingyun's worries. She continued to cast her spell wordlessly, holding the jade bottle in the air until a light green spirit water emerged from the ground, bringing some joy to her face.

After erasing all traces in the lake, Li Yuanjiao bade her farewell and left. Kong Tingyun watched him as he flew away, carrying the massive Hooked Serpent, until finally he disappeared on the horizon.

"What was I even thinking..?"

Kong Tingyun sighed. She patted her forehead with a wry smile and rode the wind back to face the gate's internal affairs alone.
