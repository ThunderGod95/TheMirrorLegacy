# Chapter 460: Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique

Liu Changdie had long been immersed in the art of formations. Despite only performing two rounds of assessments, he could clearly discern the distribution of the earth veins. His eyes shone with a perceptive light, revealing his clarity and insight.

This perception technique, known as the Spirit Eye Perception, was from the Li Family, though no one within the family had yet to master it.

Liu Changdie possessed a wealth of formation skills that allowed him to earn plenty of Spirit Stones with them. Even without a family to support him, he traveled across the state, searching for spirit water, and it took just over a decade for him to master this perception technique.

After a thorough study, Liu Changdie chose the Green Ox River Embrace Formation, a recent addition to his repertoire. This formation, which he developed in Linghai Prefecture, harnessed the power of the lake water around Mount Qingdu, combining it with the earth and water veins to repel enemies.

Breaking this formation would be a prolonged endeavor without the power of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Even an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator would struggle to breach it within an hour, making it a superior Qi Cultivation Realm formation indeed.

Formations from Linghai Prefecture often incorporated shamanic spells, adding offensive capabilities to their defensive functions. The Green Ox River Embrace Formation was no exception; it could summon a Green Ox with mana to attack intruders.

Li Yuanjiao was pleased with the formation and inquired further. The Green Ox River Embrace Formation required a substantial amount of Ebony Ores, which the Li Family conveniently possessed, thus saving them some Spirit Stones. Ultimately, the cost would amount to only a hundred Spirit Stones.

"Brother Changdie, you're too generous!" Li Yuanjiao said, frowning. If the cost were truly fixed at a hundred Spirit Stones, his family would owe Liu Changdie a favor. So, he insisted on giving Liu Changdie 115 Spirit Stones which Liu reluctantly accepted.

Liu Changdie stayed for several months while the formation was set up on Mount Qingdu. Kong Yu had mentioned that small peaks would emerge near Qingdu Mountain over the next few years, so Li Yuanjiao made sure the formation's coverage was huge enough to accommodate those peaks as well.

After a drink to celebrate the project's completion, Liu Changdie stayed for another half a month before heading north to the Yue Cultivating Sect's territory to continue his study on formations and seek breakthroughs.

Despite Lu Changdie's eagerness to remain with the Li Family as a guest cultivator, Li Yuanjiao was hesitant to let him stay permanently due to the mysteries surrounding him. Handling the situation diplomatically, Li Yuanjiao, along with Li Qinghong, escorted Liu Changdie out of their territory.

Liu Changdie, reluctant to leave, bade his goodbyes to Li Yuanjiao though he was sighing inwardly.

Alas, we have been together for more than ten years, and the Li Family still doesn't fully trust me given how wary they have always been...

With a heavy heart, he flew out of Moongaze Lake, heading north.

After seeing him off, Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong flew over the lake but were approached by a monk with narrow eyes. He clasped his hands together and said to Li Yuanjiao, "Congratulations on establishing your immortal foundation, fellow Daoist."

This monk was none other than Kongheng, who had aided the Li family during the devil plague and continued his cultivation on the lake. Though his motives were unclear, the Li Family remained grateful to him.

Li Yuanjiao replied warmly, "Thank you, Master."

Kongheng nodded, then addressed Li Qinghong.

"When I was traveling the world, I heard of a peak on the Mushroom Forest Plain named Heavenly Thunder Peak. If you're looking to make a breakthrough, you might find it helpful to cultivate in seclusion there."

With that, Kongheng excused himself and floated back to the lake. He rolled up the ends of his trousers and lowered his bald head, then began digging for lotus roots on the shore. His technique was unusual and the fact that he was rarely cultivating in seclusion suggested that he might be facing a bottleneck.

The siblings were puzzled and continued on their journey. Li Qinghong whispered, "What is that monk trying to say?"

Li Yuanjiao shook his head, skepticism evident in his voice as he replied, "Who knows?"

Li Qinghong paused before suggesting, "Let's send someone to investigate. If it's feasible, it might be worth a try."

"Mushroom Forest Plain is within the Yuan Family's territory. If what the monk said is true, we should speak to the Yuan Family. A breakthrough on that peak could be beneficial..."

The two of them returned to the peak and dispatched someone to inquire with the Yuan Family. While Li Qinghong went off to cultivate and meditate, Li Yuanjiao took out the Foundation Establishment Realm formation plate from his storage pouch and began to contemplate the situation with the pig demon on Mount Dali.

Eliminating this demon would allow us to request the white talisman for Ximing and Xijun, as well as free up the northern foothills for qi and herbs gathering, thus improving the family's situation.

Li Yuanjiao waited several days before finally receiving a reply from the Yuan Family. In fact, Yuan Huyuan came in person himself.

Yuan Huyuan, a peak Qi Cultivator, had a complex expression on his face. It was tinged with a hint of shame as he gazed blankly at Li Yuanjiao and mumbled, "You've actually reached the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

Li Yuanjiao was puzzled by his huge reaction and simply replied slowly, "Yuanjiao greets Senior..."

He could not fully grasp the depth of Yuan Huyuan's shock.

When Yuan Huyuan first arrived at Moongaze Lake, Li Chejing was only at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and Li Tongya had not even broken through the Jade Capital Stage.

When Li Chejing became a sword immortal and Li Tongya established his immortal foundation, Yuan Huyuan was already amazed. The sight of Li Yuanjiao, a junior, now reaching the Foundation Establishment, left this old man astounded.

After several attempts to call Yuan Huyuan's attention, the elder finally came to his senses and sighed.

"I've hesitated too long... I kept waiting for the right opportunity, wasting years, and ended up like this!"

With renewed determination, Yuan Huyuan quietly resolved to himself, I shall attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm once I return!

Having made up his mind, Yuan Huyuan's demeanor shifted. He smiled, cupping his fist as he said, "Congratulations on your breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm, fellow Daoist!"

After exchanging a few words with Li Yuanjiao, Yuan Huyuan said, "I have investigated as you requested. There is indeed a peak on the Mushroom Forest Plain named Heavenly Thunder Peak. The peak is struck by lightning annually due to a thunder mine located there, and as a result, the entire mountain has been scorched black."

"There are very few thunder cultivators in Jiangnan, and my family hadn't considered that location until now. Otherwise, we would have informed you sooner..." he added.

Though Yuan Huyuan's words were courteous, Li Yuanjiao did not take them too seriously. He nodded in agreement and resolved the matter in his heart.

Once we deal with the pig demon, I'll send Qinghong to the Mushroom Forest Plain to cultivate in seclusion!

After Yuan Huyuan had explained everything, he presented a few modest spirit items as a gesture of goodwill. Li Yuanjiao naturally understood his intention and responded warmly. The two exchanged a few more words before Yuan Huyuan smiled and said, "You're too kind, junior. It's reassuring to see your family thriving."

As Yuan Huyuan prepared to leave, Li Yuanjiao escorted him out and thought to himself quietly, This pig demon is at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment Realm... I can't handle it alone. I need to find a helper.

Li Yuanjiao initially wanted to delay this until Li Qinghong successfully completed her breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Then, he planned to invite another person to join them in dealing with the demon.

However, it was hard to find a Foundation Establishment Realm formation plate and he had no idea when Kong Tingyun would send someone to retrieve it. Without the formation, even four or five people might struggle to subdue the pig demon.

After some contemplation, Li Yuanjiao considered asking the Xiao Family for assistance. However, he was reluctant to appear overly dependent on them.

Uncle Xuanfeng also requested an Essence Gathering Pill. Although it's refined with humans and we have sworn not to consume it, it could be used to recruit help! There might be room for further negotiation for additional items as well.

Glancing at Yuan Huyuan, Li Yuanjiao inquired cautiously, "Senior, are you planning to attempt breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm?"

"Your guess is correct," Yuan Huyuan replied with a soft smile as he continued, "At my age, being ridiculed by the younger generation is unbearable... I must try for the Foundation Establishment Realm before this life ends!"

Li Yuanjiao continued asking further in concern, "Senior, do you have any special techniques or pills to aid in your breakthrough...?"

Yuan Huyuan hesitated for a moment before nodding slowly and replying, "Yes, the Yuan Family does. We have special secret techniques, formulas, and pills that complement each other, making it possible to achieve the breakthrough with only half the required effort."

As a century-old prestigious clan, the Yuan Family was naturally wealthy. Li Yuanjiao listened and nodded.

"I've heard that the Essence Gathering Pill can aid in achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm. Does your clan have it prepared?" he asked with a serious look.

Yuan Huyuan sighed softly as he raised his eyebrows, then replied vaguely, "Essence Gathering Pills are not ordinary pills..."

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly. Sensing that Li Yuanjiao seemed to know something, Yuan Huyuan decided to speak frankly.

"Ordinary pills wouldn't allow Golden Feather and Azure Pond to maintain control for so long. There are various ways to refine Essence Gathering Pills... Some can assist in achieving breakthroughs with less than just half the effort. Unfortunately, my family does not possess it."

"If you need it, my family can provide one."

Li Yuanjiao offered, transmitting his voice with his mana.

Yuan Huyuan was caught off guard. His expression changed drastically, and he hesitated for several breaths before asking slowly, "Qinghong is preparing for a breakthrough too... won't she need it?"

Li Yuanjiao shook his head with a smile and replied, "You worry too much, Senior. My family has already made arrangements for her."

Yuan Huyuan, tempted by the offer, nodded thoughtfully and asked nervously, "May I see the quality of the pill?"

Feeling confident enough to handle a peak Qi Cultivator like Yuan Huyuan if something went awry now that he was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Li Yuanjiao produced a jade bottle. He inverted it and a pill floated out from within it.

The pill was white with gray patterns on it, emitting a captivating aroma. Yuan Huyuan's eyes sparkled at the sight of it as he exclaimed, "Excellent! Truly excellent!"

He quickly asked, "What do you want in exchange, fellow Daoist?"
𝙛𝒓𝓮𝙚𝔀𝒆𝒃𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝓵.𝙘𝒐𝒎

Li Yuanjiao considered the options but could not think of an immediate need for his family, so he simply responded, "What can you offer in return, Senior?"

Yuan Huyuan was pleased to see that Li Yuanjiao was not being fussy. He patted his chest and assured, "Cultivation techniques, medicine, dharma artifacts...my family has plenty. I can also help you acquire any of them through our sect connections if needed!"

Yuan Huyuan struggled to determine Li Yuanjiao's needs and requirements since he refused to speak. Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes, thought for a moment, and then asked, "Are you able to obtain Heavenly Pure Essence, fellow Daoist?"

Heavenly Pure Essence was a highly prized spirit water. Not only was it an excellent healing medicine, but it could also purify true essence, alter Dao foundations, and elevate various unrefined Qi Cultivators to proper Qi Cultivators.

The Li Family did not have unrefined Qi Cultivators who needed this spirit water, but since Li Qinghong's secret technique formed the Profound Thunderpool, Li Yuanjiao wanted to find this essence to further enhance her Dao foundation.

After making this request, Li Yuanjiao remembered that the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique was also modified. Altering her Dao foundation might severe her cultivation path.

Yuan Huyuan shook his head and replied, "Fellow Daoist, you overestimate my capabilities! Heavenly Pure Essence is a water essence of the Purple Mansion Realm... Only the three sects might have it. If any of the ancestors had acquired such a purifying essence, they would have used it themselves rather than leaving it for future generations."

Li Yuanjiao could only abandon the request and inquired, "Does your family have a method to capture and subdue spirit beasts or demon creatures then?"

Li Yuanjiao was still considering the Hooked Serpent, which was a rare Foundation Establishment Realm combat force. Taming such a creature without significant backing was appealing, and the cold qi it released could assist those cultivating the Slaughter Jun Kui Light, making it a tempting prospect.

Yuan Huyuan was taken aback by the unusual request and asked, "Is it for a small demon or a demon general?"

Li Yuanjiao was excited to see that Yuan Huyuan seemed to have a solution and responded eagerly, "A demon general! A Foundation Establishment Realm demon!"

Yuan Huyuan thought carefully before saying, "My family does have a method, but it's quite difficult."

"Oh?"

Li Yuanjiao's curiosity was piqued instantly.

Yuan Huyuan explained, "My ancestor once traveled far to the north and inherited a legacy from a temple known as the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique. It's a Grade Four technique capable of suppressing demons and controlling spirits... However, this method has two major drawbacks."

Yuan Huyuan shook his head and continued, "First, this method is very costly to use. It requires six types of precious spirit items for the ritual. In the past, this cost ninety Spirit Stones for a single casting, but now, with the materials being more expensive due to the distance from the north, you might need up to a hundred Spirit Stones."

"Second, the method requires a life-matching object, which must be significantly more powerful than the demon. Otherwise, not only will the spirit items be wasted, but the life-matching object will also be consumed."

Yuan Huyuan then added, somewhat awkwardly, "My family can't obtain the Purple Mansion Realm spirit medicine, so we had to use a Foundation Establishment Realm panacea instead. It took two pieces to succeed, costing a total of about seven or eight hundred Spirit Stones. Since then, my family has lost interest, and only very few still use this method for taming demons."

If the Li Family were not also a prestigious clan with whom they had a strong relationship and expected many future exchanges, Yuan Huyuan would not have been so honest. He would have just handed over the technique and called it a day.

"I see," Li Yuanjiao said, putting on a troubled look on his face. Although his heart raced with excitement, he deliberately lamented on, "Oh... Why must it be so difficult to tame a demon?"

Yuan Huyuan shook his head, sharing the sentiment.

Secret techniques are unlike elixirs or dharma artifacts. Once given, it's no different than leaking the family's legacy. It won't be easy to get the ancestor's approval, so it might be better to make him give up on this idea.

Noticing Yuan Huyuan's expression, Li Yuanjiao decided to push forward. With a resolute look on his face, he said, "My home is close to Mount Dali... Finding a treasured panacea won't be a significant issue. I'll trade this pill for that secret technique!"

Yuan Huyuan had no choice but to nod.

Li Yuanjiao then added, "But this secret technique alone is not enough."

Yuan Huyuan, looking troubled, asked, "What else do you need, fellow Daoist?"

"Two methods for collecting cold qi, different from the method used in my family," he answered.

Yuan Huyuan shook his head and said, "We can only provide one. Qi gathering methods are clan secrets. We can give you one that is not rare, but we can't offer more than that."

"Understood!" Li Yuanjiao smiled and continued, "However, I will need your help to arrange for a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from your family to assist in capturing a Foundation Establishment Realm demon so I can use this secret technique."

Yuan Huyuan was slightly taken aback but, upon seeing Li Yuanjiao's sincere expression, he nodded in agreement.

"That won't be a problem. I'll have a cultivator from my family assist with that."
