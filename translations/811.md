### Chapter 811: Destiny-Forged Alchemy

Li Ximing nodded. The three Purple Mansion cultivators began discussing the dao right then and there. Lingdu opened with a topic, speaking on the flawless nature of Wu Earth and which Dao could restrain it. Houfu countered by recounting stories of the Daoist Masters in his family sparring with Wu Earth cultivators. He speculated that a certain divine art within the Upright Wood lineage was the ultimate counter to Wu Earth, and the conversation flowed with enthusiasm.

Li Ximing, naturally, had little to contribute. His only significant contact was with Changxi of the Earth Virtue, and beyond that, Sumian of the Treasured Earth Dao. He had only heard that some cultivator named Cheng Yan practiced Wu Earth, but he’d never even met the man. He settled for listening intently, chiming in only with pleasantries when appropriate.

Seizing a lull in their discussion, Li Ximing turned to Lingdu and asked, "Senior… do you know anything of the Heavenly Glow Dao lineage?"

Houfu’s expression turned intriguing, his gaze suddenly profound. Lingdu, however, frowned. "Zhaojing, are you referring to… the Mount Luoxia of the Wuguang Xiexia?"

Li Ximing was asking on behalf of his elder brother and had merely taken the opportunity to inquire. He hadn't expected the conversation to immediately jump to Mount Luoxia, a name he was hearing for the first time. He paused, momentarily stunned, before quickly clarifying, "No, not that… I mean the Heavenly Glow Purple Mansion Dao lineage…"

Lingdu looked startled, then visibly relaxed, letting out a helpless laugh. "All Heavenly Glow in this world originates from one of two places: Mount Luoxia or Mount Duan. While they seem to be two separate locations, they are, in fact, enjoyed exclusively by that single individual. If you are speaking of the Heavenly Glow Purple Mansion lineage… that, too, is someone else's private property. It is something the vast majority of lineages simply do not possess."

Li Ximing offered some flattery. "This junior knows such things can't be found elsewhere. Most lineages naturally wouldn't have it. But an ancient, profound, and unfathomable lineage like yours, Senior, surely surpasses all others… so I thought I would ask."

Houfu, however, sighed, his gaze holding a deep, unspoken meaning. "Zhaojing, you are thinking too wishfully. We have nothing related to the Heavenly Glow."

He spoke cryptically, leaving Li Ximing to look up in surprise, but neither cultivator seemed willing to elaborate. Just then, someone else arrived in the grove. Dantai Muming strode up quickly. He waited until Houfu finished speaking and the three looked his way before reporting respectfully, "We have guided Daoist Friend Xia through the clan acknowledgment rites and had her read the biography of Senior Brother Yu. She has changed her attire and is waiting quietly in the grove."

"Good." Lingdu replied with a smile. "Daoist Friend Zhaojing likely has further instructions. Let her come up."

Li Ximing understood this was his cue; he likely shouldn't overstay his welcome. He reflected internally.

'I really have stayed too long. I received the benefits, and the Nine Mounds lineage has treated me exceptionally well. Staying longer would be impolite. It's best to depart soon.'

Soon, Xia Shouyu ascended. She was dressed in a white top and a gray skirt, adorned with shells that chimed softly—the typical attire of an Eastern Sea cultivator. Li Ximing beckoned her over and retrieved two scrolls from his sleeve, one red and one gold.

"Take these two scrolls back with you," he instructed. "The red scroll confirms your marriage. The gold one is a personal letter from my hand. Deliver them both directly to Elder Xuanxuan at the lake."

Whatever Xia Shouyu was feeling, her face remained respectful as she bowed. "Many thanks to the Daoist Master for bestowing this marriage! This junior will certainly deliver these to the Elder’s hands!"

Li Ximing then turned back to Houfu and bowed. "I must trouble you, Senior!"

Houfu gave a slight nod. Li Ximing gestured for Xia Shouyu to stand behind him, watching as Houfu replied, "Zhaojing, you are too courteous. Just call me Houfu… In recent years, the White Victory Dao has been clashing with the Great And Illustrious Peace Temple, shaking the Great Western Plateau. The Sword Gate requested aid from my Great Xiukui Monastery. I must travel west to the Great Western Plateau anyway, so this is directly on my path. It is no trouble at all."

Li Ximing nodded, but Lingdu looked utterly astonished, his eyes widening. "The White Victory Dao? Do you mean one of the three who was born in Splitreed Island? This is extraordinary! Truly extraordinary..."

Li Ximing knew a fair bit about ancient history, and the splitting in Splitreed Island wasn't exactly a great secret. In those days, Yingze had split the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch into three. One of those parts was the demon Xiyan, located right in the Great Western Plateau…

Although he didn't know why Lingdu immediately connected the White Victory Dao to the Xiyan Demon Monarch, it didn't stop Li Ximing from realizing the gravity of the matter. He lowered his voice. "Senior means to say… Lesser Yang…"

Houfu merely shook his head. Even though Li Ximing had spoken with extreme caution, Houfu raised a finger to his lips, his expression grave. "Not necessarily," he replied. "It is just that the White Victory Dao has risen rapidly. First, their leader achieved the Diverse Mansion realm over a decade ago… then, a year ago, another of the 'Five Brightnesses' perfected a divine ability. Two consecutive Purple Mansion cultivators have emerged, reversing the situation. The Merciful Ones of the Great And Illustrious Peace Temple can no longer hold them back."

He paused, adding, "Although there has been no sign of *that specific individual*, as a Lesser Yang lineage, it is possible this is his handiwork."

Lingdu’s expression was grim. He likewise raised a finger, but this time, he pointed toward the sky. "Do not forget, there is another Lesser Yang beyond the heavens. If *he* was the one injured, it is entirely possible it triggered anomalous activity from the other two."

The three looked at each other, speechless.

While those two dared to speak of such things, Li Ximing dared not listen. After all, one represented a Supreme Yang and Supreme Yin lineage, the other a tyrant of the overseas Nine Mounds lineage. He, Li Ximing, was a down-and-out cultivator with no one backing him. Seeing the silence descend, he felt a chill creep up his spine and quickly bowed.

"I will not impose any longer. Many thanks to the Nine Mounds Immortal Mountain for the spirit fire. I will remember this kindness..."

After exchanging a few more pleasantries—Lingdu offered only a token request for him to stay—he was escorted to the mountain's edge. The farewell felt rushed; the elder was clearly distracted, and all three were lost in their own thoughts. Only Houfu added one last comment.

"By escorting Xia Shouyu back to the lake, people will inevitably assume I have met with you, Zhaojing. I personally fear neither Yehui nor Changxiao… but if Tinglan comes asking, I will find it difficult to answer her."

Evidently, as fellow Supreme Yang lineages, Purple Smoke and Xiukui shared a decent relationship. Houfu felt uncomfortable deceiving her outright.

Li Ximing considered this. He still needed to build the grand array and truly shouldn't leave a fellow Daoist Master hanging. Yet, exposing his own movements was troublesome; he couldn't give an exact location that Changxiao might exploit. After careful thought, he drew a jade pendant from his sleeve and handed it to Houfu.

"I am traveling nearby in the East A-Wang Sea. If Daoist Friend Tinglan wishes to find me, tell her to come to the border where the East A-Wang Sea meets the Peacock Sea. Have her crush this talisman, and I will naturally go to her."

Houfu understood and accepted the pendant. Li Ximing bid farewell to the two and sped away, flying across the ocean until he reached the neighboring East A-Wang Sea. The chaos here had somewhat subsided. Several Demon Generals had carved out territories, and smaller factions had begun to grow. The sea region looked relatively peaceful.

He carefully inspected his dharma body, ensuring no trace of Lesser Yang brilliance remained, and muttered, "That came out of nowhere, talking about such terrifying things… You mention one, you have to bring up all three, and that drags out another seven or eight..."

Li Ximing scanned the area, then dived deep into the sea, landing on the ocean floor. He immediately activated the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. Enveloped in a pure aura of Earth Virtue brilliance, he phased through the earth, piloting the Earth-Tiger shuttle deep underground until he located a fire vein and settled within it.

Using the power of the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, he carved out a cave, channeled the fire vein into it, and placed his alchemy cauldron atop the heat. Only then did Li Ximing sit down.

Before he could even act, he suddenly felt his Shengyang Acupoint turn ice-cold, as if a frigid force had smashed down upon him. Sparks exploded in his mind, his vision blurred, and a frosty qi surged up his face, forcing tears from his eyes.

"This…"

'It's over!'

It felt as if a giant hand had seized his spiritual sense, yanking it instantly into the infinite void beyond the heavens.

Suddenly, he saw blazing suns and twinkling stars, endless white jade immortal palaces rising like scales, clouds veiling the moon, and the divine light of the Golden Crow soaring amidst phoenixes. Twelve bridges of gold spanned a celestial lake, and tens of thousands of halls glittered…

The scenery flashed past in an instant. Before Li Ximing could see clearly, he plunged back into darkness, as if standing in a deep, subterranean palace. Specks of light dotted the gloom ahead, where a single stone bridge crossed the void. A man in gray robes, stained with blood, stood upon it. Peering closer, Li Ximing recognized a steady, calm, middle-aged face.

Wang Quwan.

The dim void seemed to contain only this single, empty bridge suspended in darkness. Wang Quwan was looking up, gripping a blue-gold treasured sword. From far above, strands of silk-like white brilliance descended, seemingly connected to some profound Dao trove.

Li Ximing’s vision zoomed rapidly toward that white brilliance. Countless wondrous treasures, Daoist scriptures, and dharma artifacts flashed before his eyes, dazzling and multicolored, until his focus finally locked onto the deepest object—a spirit sword hanging in the void.

The sword was simple and dignified, colored a pale gray without a single etching. It was a stark contrast to the luxurious and complex refinement styles of the current age. The cross-guard was nearly the same width as the blade itself, giving the entire sword a straight, uniform profile.

What truly captivated Li Ximing was the sword's sole decoration: a bright white spirit stone set into its pommel.

The familiar aura radiating from that stone caused the Talisman Seed within his Shengyang Acupoint to tremble violently, a sensation that made Li Ximing shudder. This was not the first time he had felt this. All those years ago, when Yu Muxian had arrived by boat, the young Li Ximing had been touched by that fragment and fainted. This was that same feeling.

A realization struck Li Ximing like lightning, flashing a single phrase through his mind:

'An Immortal Mirror fragment!'

The white brilliance rapidly receded, and the encroaching darkness dissipated. Li Ximing felt the world spin, and he slowly opened his eyes. He saw the dim stone walls of the cave. The dark alchemy cauldron stood before him. The crackling sound of the fire vein returned to his ears. He was back in the subterranean grotto.

He first performed a deep, formal bow before standing up. His face was a ghastly mix of blue and white as he exhaled a plume of frosty air. Forcing down his discomfort, he fumbled in his storage bag for a jade box.

"Cough!"

The moment he opened his mouth, several pale white vines burst forth, growing frantically. In an instant, they climbed his jaw, and several tendrils draped down like hanging orchids, blooming mid-air into clusters of pure white flowers.

A cold fragrance filled the cave.

He reached up, grasped the spirit object, and plucked the entire growth out, root and all. He placed it in the jade box, and without sparing it a second glance, immediately began checking his body.

'I wasn’t struck by a Supreme Yin divine ability… it's just a lingering chill… So it was the Immortal Mirror. I really thought I had angered a True Monarch by recklessly discussing them, that one just happened to be nearby, and I was about to be obliterated by Fruition Attainment pressure…'

He breathed a sigh of relief. The chill in his heart faded, replaced by shock and wild joy.

'Wang Quwan... that was Wang Quwan! That place must be the Secret Diffusion Dao trove, and the Secret Diffusion trove contains an Immortal Mirror fragment!'

'This place is countless thousands of miles from Jiangbei, yet I was able to glimpse the Secret Diffusion scenery… How powerful… And that place with the immortal palaces and pavilions… could that be beyond the heavens?'

He surmised that his sense had first linked to somewhere beyond the heavens, then followed the connection between that place and the Immortal Mirror down toward Jiangbei, observing the Secret Diffusion inheritance, before finally piercing into the Secret Diffusion Dao trove and perceiving the fragment's location...

'Truly a divine and mysterious technique…'

Suppressing his shock, Li Ximing quickly realized he had missed the immediate opportunity.

'The opening of the Secret Diffusion Dao trove must be timed. This time, it must be because the Chengyun Gate and the other sects gathered the required inheritances and opened it for the first time... Though I missed this window, if I just wait, there will be another chance…'

'If that's the case, raising my own Secret Diffusion successor is completely out of the question; it's far too late. I absolutely cannot allow that treasured sword to sit inside that trove for ten or twenty years… The only path is to fully support Wang Quwan…'

He sat silently, his gaze heavy.

'Wang Quwan… Wang Quwan… Is this the hand of destiny, or the pull of karma?'

Li Ximing slowly reined in his thoughts. Back home, Li Jiangqian also possessed a talisman and must have sensed this event. With him managing affairs from the clan, arrangements would certainly be made. Li Ximing didn't need to rush back himself.

Only then did he turn his gaze to the jade box. Inside, the branch of "Moon Orchid" remained vibrant, eight small flowers blooming upon it, radiating a faint white halo.

'A fine resource for the Purple Mansion realm.'

Li Ximing’s judgment was worlds apart from what it once was. With the Profound Light concealed between his brows, he could identify the grade of many things. Although he couldn't name the Supreme Yin spirit object before him, he could still recognize it as a Purple Mansion-grade resource, similar to the Horn Wood Golden Tassel.

'This is the perfect time to start alchemy. And I have another great medicine… right here on me.'

Steeling his resolve, he felt around his own body, precisely locating his Dantian. He pressed his index finger and thumb against the spot and spread them apart.

*Huala!*

The skin and flesh of his lower abdomen stretched open, revealing the Qi sea within. A brilliant golden radiance shone out, illuminating the entire cave.

Li Ximing quickly rolled up his other sleeve, plunged that hand into the opening, and felt around for a moment before slowly extracting something.

It was a glistening white pearl, smooth and round, with a crystal-like luster. It was only the size of a grain of rice, but the moment it left his abdomen, it instantly swelled to the size of a fist, releasing an intoxicatingly clear fragrance.

Li Ximing almost lost his grip on it. His divine abilities flared, and he invoked the suppressive power of Audience with the Celestial Gate to halt the pearl's expansion.

"Hmph!"

This object was the refined spiritual qi from the Shade-Cleansing Pool, tempered by the Valley Wind Guide-Fire. If a Foundation Establishment cultivator had this, they would be stuck with it in their Qi sea, unable to use it or exhaust it. Even for a Purple Mansion cultivator, it would normally take a very long time to safely draw out.

Fortunately, Li Ximing had a flexible mind; digging it out by hand was the fastest way. Now, the hand holding the wound open relaxed. With a single wipe, the opening healed completely, leaving not even a scar.

'But without the amplification from the Valley Wind Guide-Fire, my personal suppression is far weaker.'

Looking at the orb in his hand, Li Ximing immediately began assessing it with his old professional eye.

'This is pure Pure Qi, the divine ability essence of the Lesser Yin lineage, mixed with a hint of Bright Yang from its time in my Qi sea. If I use this as the base for a pill… I should be able to refine a furnace of spirit pills that greatly enhances divine abilities.'

'After all, this qi-pill requires my constant suppression. If I let go, it would likely erupt into a veritable mountain of spiritual qi. If I don't refine it, just carrying it around is not a solution.'

His expression suddenly turned strange.

'Well, it's not that there are *no* other ways to carry it… I could always cut myself open again and stuff it back in for the Valley Wind Guide-Fire to manage…'

That was, of course, a joke. While the Valley Wind Guide-Fire could suppress it effortlessly, the object was now the size of a fist. It wouldn't fit back into his Qi sea even if he forced it.

Although the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire was not yet refined, he possessed the Valley Wind Guide-Fire, and Li Ximing reckoned he could handle it one-handed. He pulled out the crimson bowl and flicked it with a finger.

*Peng!*

The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire erupted again, its bright red glow illuminating the cave. Li Ximing took a gentle breath.

*Huala!*

The entire sheet of flame eagerly flew from the bowl, surging toward his nostrils. In a mere instant, the bright red light vanished from the cave, leaving only the empty, crimson-glazed bowl in his palm.

The moment the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire entered his body, it tried to flee. But the Valley Wind Guide-Fire instantly blazed to life, lunging like a starving beast, and bound the new fire with an incredibly powerful pull. The flame flickered brightly, and just like that, Li Ximing had complete control.

He easily guided the flame down, settling it into his Juque Palace. The Bright Yang Purple Flame and his True Fire showed no conflict; they actively made space, flanking the new True Fire as if protecting it.

Only then did Li Ximing open his eyes. His pupils flashed bright red, then pale gold, before slowly returning to their normal color.

"Good!"

Looking at the Shade-Cleansing Qi Pill and the Moon Orchid in his hands, Li Ximing felt immense satisfaction and began pondering the refinement method.

'I have no corresponding recipe. Refining them separately would require my own formulation, and the results would likely be nothing special. It's best to refine them together. Pure Qi, Lesser Yin, Supreme Yin, and Bright Yang. There are no conflicts. This can become a great pill!'

'However, alchemy demands a hierarchy: Monarch, Minister, Assistant, and Envoy. This Moon Orchid is a great medicine, but the Shade-Cleansing Qi Pill is also a great medicine, their qualities equal. If one becomes the Monarch, the other becomes an overly powerful Minister of a different nature. Such a refinement cannot succeed. Even if forced, it would waste the medicinal properties.'

The Xiao family's alchemy was the traditional Jiangnan technique. Li Ximing had long since surpassed Xiao Yuansi's alchemy Dao. The notable refinement methods Li Ximing possessed were few: the techniques for the [Xuanque Jingxin] and [Tianyi Cuiyuan] pills were just different recipes using similar methods. That left the complete alchemy system he'd obtained from Sea's Cape: the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art.

'The Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art demands high Dao comprehension, which isn't a problem, but it uses *destiny* as the primary ingredient… Hsss…'

Li Ximing was already a master of alchemy; his insight surpassed the vast majority of Purple Mansion cultivators in Jiangnan. After acquiring the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art, his vision and skill in the Dao of alchemy had risen to another level entirely.

Jiangnan alchemy used *nature*—that is, the medicinal properties and affinities of spirit items were combined to create a pill. The alchemist was tested on their dharma power, cultivation base, and divine abilities. The Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art used *destiny*. It combined the karmic destiny and life-force of the ingredients. The alchemist was tested on their Dao comprehension, their personal fate, and their hierarchical status in the world.

'Spirit items possess both nature and destiny. The spiritual status of that Moon Orchid is terrifyingly high. But the Shade-Cleansing Qi Pill is essentially just solidified dharma power. It has nature, but no destiny. Even after passing through my body, its destiny is worlds below that of the Moon Orchid!'

'If I refine this using the Heavenly Heart Oneness method, the Moon Orchid is the undeniable Monarch medicine. The Qi Pill is its iron-clad Minister! Lesser Yin assisting Supreme Yin—it is a perfect match! Furthermore, the orchid grew from my mouth, and the qi pill was born in my abdomen. They are fundamentally of one body, their destinies intertwined, a true heaven-sent opportunity. Who else in this world but me could possibly refine this pill?'

Li Ximing was struck by sudden enlightenment. Through his own exploration, he felt he was dimly perceiving a higher realm in the Dao of alchemy.

Fired up with inspiration, he struck the cauldron. The bright red Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire erupted, swirling around the vessel before diving beneath it, converging into a vortex of scarlet flame.

He was more focused than ever before. He deliberately retrieved a [White Jade Spirit Wood]—a gift he had received when breaking through to the Purple Mansion realm and had saved ever since—and tossed it into the True Fire first.

Then, his storage bag pulsed. Boxes long and short, jade vials large and small, all flew out, wrapped in his spiritual qi. Serpent Origin Spirit Water, [Wuxi Sand], [Yuanyang Spirit Essence]… all manner of spirit items flowed forth, leaping one after another into the furnace.

A viscous, bright purple medicinal liquid began to pool at the bottom of the cauldron. The Shade-Cleansing Qi Pill dropped into it and immediately threatened to erupt into a torrential storm of spiritual energy, intent on blowing the cauldron apart. The Profound Light between Li Ximing’s brows flared, and a white, suppressive divine ability slammed down, binding all the rampaging energy within the furnace.

Finally, the Moon Orchid fell inside. Li Ximing instantly sealed the lid, pressed both hands to the cauldron's sides, and enveloped it in his Bright Yang divine ability. He shut his eyes, focusing his full power on the task.

'This pill uses every ounce of knowledge I have accumulated. It will undoubtedly be the pinnacle of the first half of my alchemy career!'

...

Southern Sea.

The Shitang Sea is the region of the Southern Sea with the least amount of land. Known as the Ten Thousand Mile Shitang, it is bordered by the Southern Borderlands to its back, Songzhou to the east, and Lufang to the south. Aside from the Azure Pond Sect's own North Dan Island, the region consists only of sparsely scattered small islands. Positioned between these major islands and having enjoyed recent peace and order, its trade has become increasingly prosperous.

North Dan was a land of beautiful scenery. At its center stood Elephant Mountain, rising six thousand feet. A grand palace sat atop its peak, bustling with cultivators coming and going. Yet, passing through this palace, one found a quieter pavilion in the rear courtyard where a man in white robes stood alone.

He had a noble, dignified appearance, a slightly long face, and brows set close to his eyes, giving him a generous and refined handsomeness. He held a sword level; it was bright white yet shimmered with a seven-colored radiance.

Potent sword qi brewed along the spine of the blade. He frowned slightly, his eyes shut tight, his face pale. Several breaths passed. The sword light pulsed erratically, threatening to erupt. Only then did his eyes snap open.

"Cough."

He coughed twice, and flakes of golden osmanthus petals tumbled from his robes, scattering on the ground in a golden halo.

Although he had clearly lost focus, the sword light had merely fluctuated rather than erupting violently, a testament to his profound mastery of both dharma arts and swordsmanship.

This man was the Master of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, a direct descendant of the Moongaze Immortal Clan, and the current Lord of Shitang’s North Dan—Heavenly Pavilion Heavenly Glow, Li Xizhi!

Li Xizhi quickly steadied himself, and the light on his sword immediately stabilized. With a flick of his other sleeve, the osmanthus petals on the ground were swept up, disappearing into a jade box that leaped from his waist, which he then tucked into his storage bag. All traces vanished in an instant.

He raised his brow, his eyes flashing with shock and suspicion.

'An Immortal Mirror fragment... Which disciple of my clan has touched upon this opportunity?'
