# Chapter 764: Threats

Hefted the man, Li Jiangxia tossed him to one of his trusted aides and paused briefly before giving the order.

"Send him to Kong Guxi."

The confidant departed with the man. Only then did a youth who had clearly been waiting for some time step into the hall. He approached and bowed.

Li Jiangxia’s attitude softened considerably. "Xuantong, you’ve arrived just in time."

An Xuantong was the most outstanding cultivator of his generation in the An clan. A year older than Li Jiangxia, he was already at the Qi Refining realm. He had been in seclusion in the dense forests, mastering the *Art of the Azure Cliff and White Smoke*, a third-grade cultivation method from the Jiang family lineage. This technique only became viable again after the spiritual qi was restored following the return of the Jade True.

He looked weary from his journey. Clasping his fist, he retrieved a jade pendant from his sleeve.

"Young Master, I just came from the forests. Lord Cui passed along a message. This jade has been nurtured by his own spiritual sense. If the situation in the Wasteland changes, crush this talisman, and my lord will come to provide reinforcements."

"Good."

Li Jiangxia tucked the item into his sleeve and strode forward, listening as An Xuantong continued in a low voice, "I heard that Profound Peak Gate has lost its authority. The minor clans on the Wasteland border are wavering, sending feelers out to Capital immortals Dao. Neither side is stable."

Li Jiangxia remained unconcerned. "Ignore them for now. Ultimately, they are Profound Peak’s people. If they truly defect to Capital immortals Dao, it is Profound Peak that loses face. My older brother is the definition of vengeful; the clan is keeping detailed records. When this situation stabilizes... they will pay."

He turned the question back on him. "Elder An... is missing... and with so much happening, has the An clan remained stable these days?"

An Xuantong answered respectfully, "The An clan has been loyal for five generations; we are old vassals of the household. The entire family worries for the clan's affairs. Several of my younger brothers have come out of seclusion, and the elders repeatedly petitioned to come east and fight Capital immortals Dao to the death. Fortunately, the elder lord stopped them..."

Unlike the reserved An Siwei from the previous generation, An Xuantong clearly had a mind of his own. Li Jiangxia knew these were not empty pleasantries; the An and Chen families were the most deeply entangled with the Li clan, bound securely to their war chariot. The moment the Li family showed instability, those two families grew the most anxious.

"Elder Zheyan is old," Li Jiangxia replied. "There is no need for him to risk himself again. These matters are for the younger generation... Is Pei Xie out of seclusion? I will go see him. You handle things here."

An Xuantong nodded quickly. "Lord Pei is currently managing affairs in the Wasteland."

Pei Xie was a rogue cultivator from the Wasteland and one of Li Jiangxia’s closest friends, whom he had known for five or six years. This rogue cultivator was highly talented, and though somewhat older, he had relied on resources from Li Jiangxia to reach the late stage of the Qi Refining realm.

As Li Jiangxia’s most trusted subordinate, An Xuantong had already arranged everything. He reported Pei Xie’s location, saw Li Jiangxia off, and then returned to seek out another attendant.

An Xuantong asked about the incident with the guest elder. After listening to the explanation, he fell silent for a moment and sighed.

"A timely word cannot save a ghost destined to die. That man Fu Jie has a suicidal nature. I suppressed him time and time again, but he just assumed I was afraid of him stealing the spotlight. The moment I went into seclusion, he ran off to get himself killed."

He let out a cold laugh. "So be it. Did the Young Master send him to the Lake... or to Profound Peak?"

"Reporting to my lord, he was sent to Profound Peak."

An Xuantong understood immediately.

'He's afraid the Eldest Young Master (Li Jiangqian) will exploit this against Profound Peak... It seems the Third Young Master still pities the common people of the Wasteland. This means that even if we must retreat, he’ll try to block Capital immortals Dao and save more people for the Eastern Shore.'

'But sending him there... puts Profound Peak in a difficult spot. Fu En was, after all, loyal. This is bound to chill some hearts.'

Having anticipated the fallout, he immediately began preparations. He retrieved several scrolls and had some cultivators deliver them to his quarters. After a moment's hesitation, he returned and sought out someone to carry a message to the Lake.

"Profound Peak's mountain gate has fallen," he said quietly, "and Fu En died catastrophically during his breakthrough. This is already an extremely sensitive matter. At this critical time, this Fu Jie refused to keep a low profile and instead courted his own death. He is finished. The Fu family is unlikely to survive this. If anyone begs for mercy, the main family absolutely must not agree."

***

The Wasteland.

Kong Guxi felt a chill rise from the soles of his feet as he returned from Moongaze Lake. Behind him, Kong Qiuyan hurried off to issue orders to the sect members. The Gate Master walked quickly toward the main hall, where, as expected, a crowd was waiting.

Their expressions varied. Some were families and former sect members who had fled Shanji Prefecture, desperate for a place of refuge. Others were local cultivators from the Wasteland border whose mountains had been seized by Capital immortals Dao, here to beg for aid. More still were members of the Kong clan itself.

The new Profound Peak mountain gate was not even as spacious as their original gate's reception peak. Now, crowded shoulder-to-shoulder with people, the grievances aimed at him, the Gate Master, threatened to blot out the sky.

Before Kong Guxi could speak, a gray cloud descended from the heavens. The mountain fell instantly silent as a voice boomed from above:

"The Guo clan of Crimson Reef Island has come to visit the Kong clan. Please show yourself!"

Crimson Reef Island had a terrible reputation. In an instant, the refugee cultivators and the opportunists alike scattered like the wind. Kong Guxi understood his own predicament clearly; seventy percent of his sect was disloyal, but he never realized it was this porous.

'I haven't even walked out the door... and they're already here.'

A middle-aged man in ornate red robes descended from the gray cloud. He was at the peak of the Foundation Establishment realm, his cultivation clearly honed to its limit. He wore a token at his waist, and behind him, a retinue of Crimson Reef cultivators stood in array. Though the man’s features were grim, the display was imposing.

"My lord, I..."

Kong Guxi moved to greet him, but the man cut him off coldly.

"Guo Hongjian, of Crimson Reef Island."

Although Kong Guxi did not recognize the man, he knew from his bearing that he was from the direct lineage. He quickly gestured to the main seat. Guo Hongjian ignored him, refused the tea that was offered, and demanded, "That matter of gathering qi. Have you asked your masters?!"

Kong Guxi’s expression changed drastically.

When Crimson Reef first asked, they addressed the "Kong clan," not Profound Peak. Now, this man did not call him Gate Master, and referred to the Li family as "your masters." The implication was that Profound Peak was destroyed, and the Kong clan were nothing but servants.

While this wasn't far from the truth, it was a reality that neither the Li family nor Profound Peak was willing to acknowledge. All other visiting powers had afforded them basic courtesy. How could they compare to Crimson Reef Island?

Kong Guxi swallowed his rage and replied respectfully, "Daoist Guo, I have received a reply. The Wasteland is a chaotic warzone. Capital immortals Dao watches us like a tiger, ready to strike west at any moment. Your esteemed clan wishes to build palaces to gather qi, but I fear the war will interfere. It is simply not convenient for your sect to operate here."

Guo Hongjian was not interested in the polite refusal. He knew the roundabout answer meant no.

"Your Profound Peak? *Your* Profound Peak?" he spat. "You have to ask the Li clan's permission for everything. What Profound Peak do you have left to speak of! A few remnants! We should be praised for not simply crushing you, and you stand here playing games with me!"

Kong Guxi gritted his teeth, but Guo Hongjian stepped closer, his voice rising.

"Surnamed Kong! Back then, regarding the Radiant Sky Stone affair, wasn't it your family that instigated things? How many times did you sow discord? My sister entered the inland seas on orders, and wasn't it your people who blocked her at Lake Xian, forcing her to reroute and miss her chance! All the little tricks your Profound Peak has pulled over the years! Today you dare to dither with me? If we truly settle old debts, none of you have enough lives to pay!"

Behind them, Kong Qiuyan’s face went white. Kong Guxi lowered his voice. "The decision regarding the gathering of qi was made at the Lake. It is not something a minor cultivator like myself can decide. My lord does not need to take his anger out on me."

"Then go get the Li family member!"

Guo Hongjian was no stranger to the Li family. He had crossed blades with Li Qinghong during the North-South conflict and had nearly captured Li Xijun while escorting the Radiant Sky Stone. His clan had sent him here for a precise reason.

'They just want me to probe Li Xi... Daoist Master Zhaojing. I'm only afraid I can't make *enough* trouble!'

He barked, "I see you're nothing but a sniveling servant. Get the Li representative here!"

Kong Guxi retreated silently, whispering to an attendant, "Go to the forest and request their presence."

Only then did Guo Hongjian take a seat. A short while later, a figure strolled into the hall. He had refined brows and steady eyes; while not stunningly handsome, he possessed a graceful air, draped in purple robes. Guo Hongjian glanced at him. "Who are you?"

Cui Jueyin had just rushed over from the dense forests. His Cui family was also an Eastern Sea power; he knew exactly what Crimson Reef Island cultivators were like, and the relationship between their two families was poor at best.

"Cui Jueyin of Moongaze Lake," he answered calmly. "I govern the dense forests and manage the Wasteland on the Eastern Shore."

Guo Hongjian sipped his tea. "Not a Li... a Cui will do just fine. Crimson Reef wishes to gather qi in the Wasteland. Your clan simply needs to cede a piece of land."

The youth opposite him remained perfectly composed. "It is not that Moongaze Lake is unwilling to lend the territory. Your esteemed clan uses Merging Fire, and gathering qi in this manner harms living souls. The inland is not the outer seas. Such an act against cosmic harmony cannot be permitted. Hengzhu and the Sword Gate both uphold the righteous path and will not tolerate such actions."

Before Guo Hongjian could explode, Cui Jueyin continued, "This is our family's concern. We fear, Daoist friend, that you will perish here and damage Crimson Reef's reputation. However, if you have no such fears, I can report this matter again and ask the Lake."

Guo Hongjian’s expression turned ugly. Seeing Cui Jueyin’s calm demeanor, he sneered, "If Moongaze Lake cannot help me with this, and I receive no news in three days... then it doesn't *have* to be Moongaze Lake. Once Capital immortals Dao crosses the border, I shall be able to gather qi in the Wasteland all the same."

Hearing the threat, Cui Jueyin gave a mild, flat bow. "Daoist Guo speaks reasonably. By all means, wait for Capital immortals Dao to cross the border, then you may gather your qi. When Capital immortals Dao invades, and your Crimson Reef acts as their accomplice, killing everyone... let us see how the Sword Gate and Purple Smoke Gate react."

His voice turned cold. "Daoist friend, you ventured inland. Be careful not to cross a line and die here in the Wasteland. Crimson Reef wouldn't even be able to say a word."

Guo Hongjian laughed in fury. "Good, good... I truly want to see who your family intends to send to defend the Wasteland."

Though Cui Jueyin’s cultivation was lower, his aura did not yield an inch. "As you wish, Daoist friend. Just don't laugh too soon, only to be slapped to death here in the Wasteland by a Daoist Master."

Cui Jueyin flicked his sleeve and departed.

Guo Hongjian was suddenly uncertain. This was, after all, a matter of life and death.

'I must visit Daoist Master Yehui’s mountain gate and listen to his divine instructions,' he thought. 'This Cui seems to have a strong background. I need to investigate him.'

Guo Hongjian likewise stormed off, riding the wind away. The confrontation had ended badly for everyone, but Kong Guxi, waiting at the side, felt a wave of relief. He wasn't afraid of them fighting; he was afraid that the Li family would back down and negotiate.

When the hall doors were sealed and the array was activated, Kong Guxi finally spoke. "Cui Jueyin was strong. The Lake must still have an ace up its sleeve."

Kong Qiuyan nodded, answering fearfully, "I hope so."

Kong Guxi sighed. "Our mountain gate is gone. Regardless, Profound Peak owes the Fu family. We must care for their descendants in the future."

Kong Qiuyan only nodded. Kong Guxi studied the haggard look on her face. The ordeals of the past two years had clearly broken her spirit. That unique composure belonging to the disciple of a great house was gone, replaced by a constant, forward-looking terror. The sight left a bitter taste in Kong Guxi’s mouth.

"Yan’er," he said, "my vision was too shallow... Back then, when the North-South conflict was looming, the sect discussed a marriage alliance with the Li clan. I held onto the empty airs of an immortal sect, feeling that you should not marry down..."

"After Li Xicheng died, Aunt Tingyun even had you meet Li Xijun. You, too, felt he was a great character. But the idea was shot down by us old stubborn fools and arrogant fools... Otherwise... otherwise..."

Kong Qiuyan was silent for a long moment before she replied. "Otherwise what? Otherwise the sect would be better off today? Or perhaps, otherwise I would simply be a widow by now? My lord, although you act with the sect in your heart, you cannot say such things. I still have sect duties to attend to. I will take my leave."

She exited through a side door, leaving Kong Guxi stunned by the response. Just then, a frantic, chaotic banging echoed from the main hall doors.

Kong Guxi still felt hollow, but his body reacted first. He moved to open the door and found an elder man knocking urgently. Kong Guxi stared blankly as the door opened, revealing a figure bound and pressed to the ground in the courtyard, wearing rich robes, his face obscured.

The elder, Kong Guli, his face flushed red, whispered, "Gate Master, Fu Jie provoked the Third Young Master, intending to harm the direct lineage! He was captured and sent here... The Third Young Master’s meaning is... for the Gate Master to handle it himself."

Kong Guxi’s vision went black, and he nearly collapsed. He steadied himself and asked, "Is this... Elder Fu En’s direct kin? Fu Jie... yes, I have heard that name."

Seeing the man beside him nod, Kong Guxi felt his mouth go dry. The Fu clansman knelt on the hall floor, moaning, mumbling incoherently. Kong Guxi was lost. He grabbed his brother by the arm.

"Wasn't he called clever? Brave? Always saying shocking things? How could he fall so low as to sow discord!"

No one answered him, least of all Kong Guli, who didn't know the specifics. The man on the floor just whimpered, unable to speak clearly. Kong Guxi finally managed to summon the guards who brought him, and after listening to their report, he felt a fire consuming his heart. He stalked forward, grabbed Fu Jie by the collar, and snarled:

"Was this the time to be clever? You are a child of this sect, sheltered for generations! How could you interfere in the affairs of an Immortal Clan... trying to be a petty strategist..."

The wound on Fu Jie’s chest had not healed. His pale lips trembled. Mortally terrified that Fu Jie might actually speak, Kong Guxi slammed him back onto the ground, interrupting his words. With a sharp *shing*, Kong Guxi drew his sword and hacked down with all his might.

He struck in such a hurry that with a wet tearing sound, the man before him was split in two. Blood, bile, and viscera spilled out, splashing across Kong Guxi’s feet.

The Gate Master stumbled back a step and threw the sword down with a clang. Dizzy, refusing to look at the remains on the floor, he ordered, "Quickly! Send someone to thank the Third Young Master!"
