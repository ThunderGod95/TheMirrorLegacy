# Chapter 768: The Fiend

**The Ends of the World.**

The small island was thick with dense jungle, threaded by the movements of wild beasts and dotted with numerous native stockades. Spiritual qi was thin, but at the island's center boiled a bottomless azure spring. Several azure creeks flowed out from it, vanishing into the forest.

A cultivator in black robes sat cross-legged by the pool, guarding it in silence. After most of the day had passed, a brown-robed cultivator finally sped over, landing by the spring and clasping his hands.

"Daoist Friend Feng, I borrowed the Lishu Fire-Averting Cover."

The cultivator named Feng leaped up from the poolside, his earlier stillness clearly just a pretense. "Many thanks, Daoist Friend Fang! Quickly, bring it out!"

The man surnamed Fang retrieved a bright red jade pearl from his sleeve, his voice full of reluctance. "You must be careful... I had to pledge my family heirloom, the Wuting Talisman Brush... and even added a spirit stone as rent. If that brush weren't so unique, they never would have let it go..."

Cultivator Feng glanced at him, speaking patiently. "Relax. I've been to this island many times. The savages here were raised in this place by my own great-ancestor, conveniently left for his descendants to use. He was so afraid of them producing someone powerful that he never even taught them to write."

"This island has always been barren of spiritual qi. When I came today, I found the island suddenly had a faint aura, all of it originating from this great boiling spring at the center. There must have been a change in the earth-veins."

He took the jade pearl and infused it with his spiritual qi. It immediately swelled and expanded, transforming into a red barrier covered in runes that enveloped them both. Feng led the way, sinking into the lake while speaking.

"I once visited Lord Xia, an alchemist in the Admirable Sea. He mentioned that a spring, azure in color, that erupts powerfully from the earth with a rising intent, is called a 'Cave Spring' when it reaches the point of transforming water. A remarkable Dao lineage inland cultivates this. They call it 'Pristine Water'."

Daoist Friend Fang asked, "Pristine water? What kind of Pristine water? What level of expert does one become after cultivating it?"

Cultivator Feng shook his robes and pointed upward. "Naturally, higher than the sky."

The surrounding lake water was growing hotter. Fang said in alarm, "Higher than the sky? A Foundation Establishment cultivator's Dao lineage!"

Cultivator Feng smiled without speaking, shaking his head. "That's called Purple Mansion! It is the lineage of a Purple Mansion cultivator! Don't be fooled by how impressive those island lords look moving mountains and filling seas. A true expert of that lineage could kill them with a single glance."

He changed the subject. "Regardless, the object in this cave is capable of making the entire area boil and filling the whole island with spiritual qi. It must be a Foundation Establishment-level spiritual item. As long as we get our hands on it, you and I won't have to worry for the rest of our lives."

Fang sighed. "I rely completely on your guidance, Daoist friend. I am just a mixed-qi cultivator. What good would a great treasure do me? Daoist Friend Feng, at least you have pure-qi. Once you obtain this opportunity and ascend step by step, do not forget to lend me a hand."

As they spoke, they had already entered the earth-vein. On both sides, scalding steam mingled with flames, blasting the artifact and making it hum. Cultivator Feng was clearly struggling to power it, and he handed control to his partner. His face changed.

"How tyrannical! We haven't even reached the depths of the earth-vein... where did such terrifying earth-fire come from!"

Fang's lineage was clearly inferior to his; he had never even seen earth-fire before. He could only pretend to nod. Feng's expression shifted several times before he gritted his teeth.

"How many medicinal pills do you have left!"

Fang mumbled the meager contents of his pockets. Feng made a decisive choice.

"We both have enough pills. Since we have already come this far, how can we return empty-handed? We must go deeper into the vein and see. Even if we can't take anything, at least we will know what is down here!"

He gritted his teeth and pushed his spiritual qi, flying downward for several more minutes. Finally, the steam ahead of them thinned. The subterranean flames flickered, and they vaguely saw an open space.

The cavern floor was made of smooth stone slabs, carved with countless complex patterns. At the very center, on a platform resembling an altar, danced a plume of deep black fire.

A rush of excitement flooded their minds. Before they could even recover from the shock, Cultivator Feng took advantage of a moment when the flame dimmed to scan the area. He vaguely spotted a skeleton sitting next to the fire!

The skeleton sat cross-legged and appeared to have been dead for many years. A glittering, metallic-looking storage bag lay beside it, gleaming dazzlingly in the firelight.

Cultivator Feng's heart pounded as greed consumed him.

'The sitting-place of a deceased cultivator! My opportunity has come!'

He immediately began to back away, whispering urgently, "I can't hold on much longer! We must leave, quickly!"

Both men were spent forces, and the surrounding flames were beginning to flare brighter with the earth-vein's cycle. Fang could already feel his feet burning. He nodded frantically, and the two vanished back into the sea of fire.

Long after they departed, only the vast flames remained. On the ground, the skeleton's finger twitched. Flesh and skin instantly reappeared, and a white-gold Daoist robe shimmered back into existence, revealing a proper face.

Li Ximing let out a long, deep breath, feeling a sense of relief.

"Someone came!"

Li Ximing was trapped by Changxiao's Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art. The moment he left this spot, the flame on his body would flare like a beacon, so he could only use spiritual items to suppress it. Months had passed, and he had already used more than a dozen drops. His only hope was for someone to come from the outside.

"This spring is subtle; it doesn't draw attention and looks like a natural change in the earth-veins, so it won't cause a major disturbance. The downside is... very few people come. After waiting for months, a single Qi Refining layer-one cultivator finally shows up!"

A Qi Refining cultivator was naturally useless. If Li Ximing hadn't intentionally suppressed his flames, the two men wouldn't have even been able to see him. He left them alone, letting out a long line to catch a big fish.

'Qi Refining is far from enough... I need at least a Foundation Establishment cultivator... only then is there a possibility of escape.'

The only Purple Mansion-grade healing item in his possession was a single Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill. He still had plenty of treasure medicines and supplementary herbs in his storage bag. Li Ximing was, after all, a Purple Mansion Alchemist. Over the past few months, he had slowly formulated a path to healing. Unfortunately, it required a Foundation Establishment demon beast as the primary ingredient. Sitting here paralyzed, he certainly couldn't refine it.

'Lure a few Foundation Establishment cultivators here, find a way to make them gather a few spiritual items for me... and then capture a Valley Water demon beast. Then I can devise a way to refine a pill... and suppress this injury first.'

He pondered briefly, then borrowed the power of the Immortal Mirror. His spiritual sense leaped out, watching the two men depart. Before they had even left the island, the black-robed Cultivator Feng, seeing that his partner's spiritual qi was exhausted, drew his sword and, in a flash, cut him to pieces.

'Truly decisive... Now he doesn't even have to return the artifact. He can just keep it for himself.'

Li Ximing coldly watched Cultivator Feng leave the island, a strange feeling rising in his heart.

'So now *I'm* the old Purple Mansion fiend suppressed in an earth-vein, just like in the stories... just waiting for some foolish kid to accidentally release me, only to be utterly slain by him with an immortal sword after seventy-eight chapters of twists and turns. What a beautiful story.'
