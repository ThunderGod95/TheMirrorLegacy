# Chapter 799: Peacock

When Li Wushao asked, Li Xuanxuan immediately shook his head and replied:

“Naturally, nothing is settled. Back then, Chenghuai's marriage was arranged when Zhi'er and Yang Xiao'er returned home to visit family. Now, we only have this one child, and no news has come from the sect. The clan can only set the matter aside…”

“Moreover, Zhi'er is not who he used to be. He is a major figure in the Southern Sea. This matter requires even more caution…”

When Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er had returned home to visit those few times, the Foundation Establishment grand array on Qingdu Peak hadn't even been constructed. It couldn't compare to the current state of a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan, to say nothing of Li Xizhi holding such status now. After the old man finished speaking, Li Wushao nodded:

“Master and Mistress said that in the past, they only hoped the Young Master could grow up safely and continue the family bloodline, so they specifically selected the Ding clan. Now that Zhouluo is grown, his marriage is especially critical. Several families and sects have shown interest. Some have even paid Master a visit. In the years the Young Master has been head of the family, they've come even more frequently…”

Li Xuanxuan nodded repeatedly. He certainly hoped Li Zhouluo would find a good wife. The old man said, somewhat tactfully, “We must also pay attention to mutual affection... If things turn ugly later, we will end up offending people.”

“That is only natural.”

Li Wushao, perhaps not fully understanding his meaning, cupped his hands.

“Master's intention is this: before Young Master Zhouluo reaches Foundation Establishment, he should first make a trip to the Southern Sea. He will live with Master for a period, meet the young ladies from several prominent families and sects, and cultivate some feelings. He will marry right there. Once everything is arranged and he breaks through to Foundation Establishment, he can decide if he wishes to return.”

Li Xuanxuan was flabbergasted. “This… isn't that putting on too many airs? What if it makes all the families unhappy…”

“Haha!” Li Wushao laughed and shook his head.

“It is not excessive in the slightest! Old Master, you are not in the Southern Sea, so you do not know. Today, wherever Master goes in the Southern Sea, he is the guest of honor. Zhouluo is the master of a direct line Purple Mansion Immortal Clan, the Daoist Master's grand-nephew, of Yue royal blood, and the grandson of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion Master. He himself is a first-class talent. Which family wouldn't be rushing to present themselves?”

Li Xuanxuan understood the calculation. He mused internally:

'Ximing said that Yang Tianya is still lurking in some dark corner. That means he (Zhouluo) also has the bloodline of that Yang family Daoist Master. Indeed…'

Li Wushao continued without stopping:

“Besides this matter, there is the issue of Qi-Plucking Peak. The current Peak Lord is Peak Lord Lin Wuning. When she heard I was coming to the lake, she visited me repeatedly, asking me to carry a message. She said that the Azure Pond Sect harvests five types of 'Qi' from the lake, three of which cannot be found anywhere else. Now, damn it, they're being all polite, saying they hope to establish a place with the Moongaze Immortal Clan to serve as a foothold for the Azure Pond Sect. This way, when they come to gather Qi in the future, they'll have a proper procedure to follow.”

His mouth split into a grin. “So the Azure Pond Sect has this day too. How satisfying.”

Li Xuanxuan pondered this and knew it referred to things like the Golden Autumn in the Lake Qi. Most were unique to the Azure Pond Sect. The Moonlake Autumn Reflection Technique was very famous. His own family possessed the Supreme Yin Lunar Essence, but they didn't dare use it. It was quite the dilemma.

A thought struck him, and he asked, “What kind of people usually gather this Qi? They probably wouldn't send Foundation Establishment cultivators. They have all sworn the Profound Scenary Spirit Oath…”

“Correct.”

Li Wushao had clearly learned a thing or two at the Azure Pond Sect and understood the subtle meaning. He pulled him into the hall and lowered his voice.

“Old Master, this Qi-Plucking Peak naturally doesn't send Foundation Establishment cultivators to gather Qi. The Dao of Qi-gathering is always treated as a top priority. The key to the Golden Autumn in the Lake Qi is the Summoning Radiance Technique. Unless one were to search their souls…”

Li Xuanxuan actually chuckled and replied, “There is no rush. Just let their people come and gather the Qi.”

Li Wushao nodded heavily. Soon, he saw Quan Yuduan and the other disciple return. However, these two Azure Pond disciples deliberately avoided the other side as they returned, seemingly unwilling to run into the cultivators from Purple Smoke Gate. Their tour had not been enjoyable; they seemed constrained and awkward.

Wang Quwan was already waiting on the lake. Li Xuanxuan could only take Li Wushao out to see them off. Quan Yuduan saw the two from afar and smiled.

“Old Ancestor, we will head out now. We will return to see the senior when our business is concluded.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded. “Be careful in all things.”

The group headed north together. Li Xuanxuan saw them off past the lake. The sky darkened again. The lake was wrapped in silence. The Purple Smoke Gate cultivators, who had been hiding on their isle, also emerged. Several streaks of purple qi pierced the air and flew away lightly.

Peacock Sea.

The further north one traveled, the more magnificent and iridescent the waters of the Peacock Sea became. By the time one reached the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour in the far northeast, the seawater beneath the sacred bronze mountain already displayed a fantastical, shifting, five-hued brilliance, changing colors repeatedly with the sunlight. Patches of coral floated on the surface, moving like living fish and snakes.

Looking down from the sacred bronze mountain, one could still see several black dots squirming on the sea's surface, kowtowing with every single step as they approached the mountain. Coral naturally rose up to support them, allowing them to walk upon the sea as if on flat ground.

But the mountain was full of peacocks leaping and hopping, chasing each other playfully. When several mortals finished kowtowing and reached the foot of the mountain, the peacocks swarmed them and pecked them viciously. These people were already sallow and emaciated; how could they withstand such torment? Covered in blood, they fell back into the sea.

At this, several acolytes attending the peacocks watched with great relish and began to laugh.

“Their minds are unstable. They truly deserve it! Kowtowing every step is meant to nurture the Buddhist heart. If they cannot abandon self-respect, self-love, and their own independent thoughts, how can they be called pious? How can they seek emptiness?”

Just as they were laughing, a wild wind swept across the flat ground. These acolytes possessed little cultivation and were instantly swept up by the gale, along with the mortals on the ground. All of them landed upon a multicolored, feathered surface. Before the acolytes even landed, they were laughing in ecstasy.

“We have been chosen by the blessed land!”

“The Seven-Colored-Language Peacock Back! This is one of the highest blessed lands!”

The acolytes quickly settled themselves on the peacock's back and began piously chanting sutras. The dozen or so mortals, sallow and suffering from broken limbs from the fall, saw this and began chanting along, and astonishingly, they no longer felt any pain.

The massive peacock spread its wings and flew east. Splendor flowed in its dark, gem-like eyes. The Eastern Sea was vast, and the peacock was truly bored by the flight. After a while, it snatched up one person and "received" them, eliciting a cheer from those on its back.

The acolytes had the best "flavor" and were being saved for last. Seeing the mortals enter the "blessed land" first, they grew indignant. Suppressing their jealousy, they used every ounce of their strength to chant the sutras.

The peacock flew onward until it reached the Sea's Cape. Its snacks now finished, it transformed into a dignified and benevolent-looking woman clad in a five-colored robe. She dove deep into the seabed, executed an art, tunneled into the earth, and flew into a karst cave, finally arriving before a pool of turquoise water.

She smiled slightly and whispered, “Greetings, Great Daoist Master Buzi!”

The water in the subterranean pool rippled slightly, and a weak voice emerged, sounding ancient and weary:

“Daoist Friend Yuse, my thanks to you this time… Did you bring the Blood-Jadeite Treasure Pearl?”

The Merciful One Yuse smiled and nodded. “You are a great cultivator who has entered the Purple Mansion Realm; you need not be so polite. To be able to help a Great Daoist Master in this dire place is also due to fate. I only hope you recover from your injuries and capture that great demon!”

“I only hope… to see that flower first.”

The green pool rippled, and Chi Buzi's voice emerged: “As it should be.”

At this, the water stirred, and a bright white flower floated up from the pool's surface. The eyes of the Merciful One Yuse lit up, and she smiled. “This truly is a rare Supreme Yin treasure! Worthy of the Supreme Yang Dao… It truly opens the eyes of a minor cultivator like me from the poor countryside.”

She looked at it closely, just as a clear, smiling voice sounded right by her ear:

“Beautiful, isn't it? It should be!”

Yuse's heart seized in shock. She whipped her head around. Behind her, seated on a large rock, was a green-robed cultivator with unbound hair, smiling warmly at her. A deathly chill shot through her heart. “Daoist Master… what is…”

Before she could finish her question, she saw a spray of crystal flying toward her. The hairs on her body stood on end. She formed a hand seal, and layers of colored light flew up to block the crystal, only to find her vision blurring, immersed in a piercing, icy cold.

An icy sensation radiated from beneath her feet, the cold touch of ripples. She was already standing in the green pool.

Chou-Gui Hidden Form!

The Merciful One Yuse was only recently promoted. In a fight, she was no match for Chi Buzi. She immediately formed a seal and spoke with urgency:

“Great Daoist Master! My fate is held in the hands of the Shanjia Maha! Killing me will create binding karma! I urge you to act with caution!”

Yuse never imagined Chi Buzi would attack her. The Shanjia Maha was already in his ninth incarnation. Furthermore, Chi Buzi was not some vengeance-fueled Buddhist. Killing her, Yuse, offered him no benefit whatsoever!

Both Merciful Ones and Mahas were Buddhist cultivators who had attained the "Non-Retrogression Stage," equivalent to the Purple Mansion Realm. The greatest difference between them lay in that stage. A Maha's Non-Retrogression Stage resides on their own Maha "seat"—their position, form, and thoughts never regress. Unless their True Spirit is locked away, they are equivalent to immortal.

But a Merciful One's Non-Retrogression Stage is "hung" beneath a corresponding Maha's seat, the highest being beneath the Golden Lotus Seat—once also called the Lotus Seat or the Great Pu-Sa Dixit Seat. Their form and thoughts do not regress; even if their Dharma Body is shattered in the outside world, they can completely recover upon returning to the Buddhist Pure Land.

A Merciful One of this level already possesses the potential to attain the Maha realm; the conditions are just extremely strict.

The system of the Buddhist cultivators was extremely wondrous; otherwise, how could they have emerged from the ancient chaos of immortals and demons and seized the entire north during the turmoil? There was a reason why the seven paths of Buddhist cultivators and the northern mortals were pathologically obsessed with the Pure Land—it was simply far more convenient and infinitely safer than seeking one's own nature…

Although her, Yuse's, Non-Retrogression Stage was not yet certified under the highest Golden Lotus Seat, she had reached the secondary Developing Wisdom Seat. Her spiritual thoughts would not regress and could retreat to the Pure Land. More importantly, as a descendant of the Peacock, her status in the Way of Compassion was unusual. If she died, the Shanjia Maha himself would personally attend to the matter!

Killing her would only shatter this Dharma Body, offend the Ninth-Incarnation Shanjia Maha, and anger the entire Peacock clan, yielding Chi Buzi absolutely no benefit. Otherwise, why would she, Yuse, dare to recklessly contact Chi Buzi?!

Even as events spiraled far beyond her imagination, Yuse remained calm. She pointed out the stakes while forming seals, watching the green-robed man lounging on the rock. He smiled.

“Little Peacock, I won't kill you! I'm just borrowing you for a while.”

The Pristine Water at her feet rippled. Facing Chi Buzi of the Pristine Water Dao, Yuse had already lost most of her fighting spirit. She still wanted to immediately move and leap out of the green pool. She circulated her magic and stepped forward, only to find that the pool followed her like a shadow, staying directly beneath her feet.

Chi Buzi raised an eyebrow, observing her, and said casually:

“You are a peacock, after all. Yao are inherently inferior to humans. You cultivate as a Merciful One, yet you don't even have a single divine ability and clearly haven't learned any decent Dharma arts. If you had run into someone else, they would have slapped you to death in two hits!”

He appeared to be sitting casually on the rock, but he was toying with a small cauldron that radiated a shimmering green light. A powerful sensation of stagnation filled the carefully arranged cave, so thick that a faint green mist began to rise. He was clearly primed and ready to strike.

A descendant of the Peacock was still a Purple Mansion bloodline. Although not equal to a Dragon or Luan-Phoenix, she was certainly not worse than others. Unfortunately for her, she had met Chi Buzi, the greatest genius of the Chi family in three hundred years. The green pool below and the green mist in the air combined to bind her, preventing her escape into the Great Void. Yuse barely maintained her polite facade:

“I wonder what the Daoist Master requires? You could have simply told this junior. Why must you be so aggressive…”

Yuse's *thoughts* were non-regressing, not all three aspects. This Dharma Body and her Merciful One status were extremely precious to her. Knowing he couldn't, and had no motive to, kill her, she was ultimately reluctant to fight back.

Chi Buzi raised an eyebrow, glanced at her, and smiled.

“I have been cultivating a specific Dharma art these past few years. It requires peacock blood, peacock feet, and peacock feathers. I came this time, Daoist Friend, to borrow your Dharma Body.”

Yuse immediately relaxed. After all, these things, no matter what, were nothing compared to her entire Dharma Body. But if she weren't trapped here, she naturally would be unwilling to give them. The request now felt reasonable. She lowered her voice: “My…”

*Rumble…*

Before she could finish speaking, the small cauldron in Chi Buzi's hand had already appeared above her head. The intense, dense power of Pristine Water pressed down. In the single instant that Yuse hesitated, the green pool beneath her feet erupted with complex, glowing array patterns.

A sudden, deadly chill seized Yuse's heart. But Chi Buzi had been accumulating power in that cauldron for who knows how long. As it descended, it suppressed her, scattering her dharma power and rendering her completely immobile.

Chi Buzi remained seated on the rock, unmoving, his eyes filled with mockery.

'Fell for it once and it wasn't enough, she had to fall for it again. Truly stupid. The Pure Land only raises these kinds of idiots…'

Even though Chi Buzi was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, Yuse was not someone he could kill with a mere flip of his hand. In this short time, he could only stun her, force her back to her original form, and trap her above the green pool.

Yuse was suddenly horrified. This was her moment of weakness, unable to move. If he sacrificed any Dharma Artifact now, he could easily wound her. Her mind was still reeling:

'At the absolute worst, he just covets my entire Dharma Body… Could he possibly pull out a Dharma Treasure and actually kill me?'

In that fleeting instant of thought, the grand array beneath her feet flared with a blinding white light. Yuse's figure abruptly faded. A dignified Merciful One from the Developing Wisdom Seat vanished just like that, leaving only the flow of colored light in the empty cave.

Chi Buzi's eyes darkened. He felt the slow, creeping sensation of weightlessness and understood.

'It can 'receive' Yuse even like this... and it clearly wasn't *Him* who acted. There are multiple True Monarchs in the 'Heavens Above'…'

'Dharma Artifacts have no effect. I wasn't even inside the array, yet I can still be pulled into that Grotto-Heaven... I fear I couldn't hide even if I fled to the ends of the earth. The 'Heavens Above' is not only much higher than the Buddhist Pure Land of Compassion, but it's fundamentally not in the Great Void. It is... beyond Heaven…'

'Peacocks really are stupid and dull... If I loop around, I might be able to trap one here again. Ugh, but that means I have to see that chatty moron of a donkey again…'
