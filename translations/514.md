# Chapter 776: Encheng

Li Xizhi had understood early on that guarding the valley was no easy task. If the Tuoba Family sent some random subordinate, they would be fine. But if they sent a direct descendant, then he would need to prepare an escape route.

So he had inquired about the relevant rosters, memorized the approximate layout of the checkpoints surrounding Baixiang Valley, and organized a list of the cultivators stationed at each. Now, he followed the shortest possible route in his flight.

He rode past more than ten strongholds on Heavenly Glow. Most were minor hills and small formations. Some had been razed by devil cultivators, while others were simply too afraid to appear, remaining eerily silent.

He had passed two major formations. One remained sealed shut and the other was surrounded by devil cultivators. It had been too dangerous to approach. That one had originally housed members of the Yang Family, but they were either trapped or dead. No signs of life remained. He could only forge ahead blindly.

Now, his back was soaked with sweat, and his insides in complete disarray. His spiritual sea was nearly empty, and the Heavenly Glow had grown dim. He flew past another small mountain. Its formation was unresponsive, turning him away at the threshold.

Li Xizhi hovered lightly on the dim Heavenly Glow and glanced downward twice. His insides were in turmoil, as danger loomed. He steadied himself with a spell and thought to himself, More than ten formations, and not a single one familiar to my family? Is this just ill fortune... or deliberate plotting?

His Heavenly Glow was like the very image of a dying lamp. He only had one Autumn Convergence Pill left, but he could no longer afford to save it. He quickly calculated, There’s only one pill left, and Tuoba Chongyuan is closing in. The problem won’t be mana exhaustion anymore. I’ll be caught before I even reach Mount Bianyan...

A cold feeling crept across his heart. Chengdu Pass ahead was most likely under the guard of Yuan Huyuan, elder brother to his master Yuan Tuan. The two were already estranged.

The old man is timid and indecisive. He’s eager to keep the peace and please outsiders. Even someone like Yuan Chengdun dared to cut down his own family’s finest. There’s no hope he’ll act with clarity now, thought Li Xizhi.

Even the younger members of the Chi Family found that man’s personality to be spineless. Of course he wouldn’t dare confront the Tuoba Family. He would hesitate even when the two sides weren’t at odds. There was no chance he would open the formation to welcome Li Xizhi.

So Li Xizhi sped up to pass quickly. But unexpectedly, a silvery-white ripple of spiritual energy surged outward to meet him from within Chengdu Pass’s formation.

“Peak Master, I’ve come to aid you!”

Li Xizhi instantly felt a surge of hope. He paused in surprise and quickly saw that the person was not from the Yuan Family.
𝘧𝘳𝘦ℯ𝓌𝘦𝒷𝘯𝑜𝑣𝘦𝓁.𝒸𝘰𝓂

He guessed they were from the Ning or Yang Families and replied, "Fellow Daoist! We’re already near Mount Bianyan, just delay him a little! Reinforcements are on the way!"

He spoke those words for Tuoba Chongyuan to hear. Li Xizhi quickly formed hand seals, wary of an ambush. With a flick of his finger, the final Autumn Convergence Pill slipped into his mouth.

Tuoba Chongyuan finally frowned, summoning a streak of white light to his palm as he said coldly, “Whose family are you from... stay out of this!”

Li Quantao shook his sleeve, and a warm, lustrous white pearl leapt into the air, shedding radiance as he replied, “This is my family matter, I have no choice but to intervene.”

Tuoba Chongyuan assumed this was one of Li Xizhi’s kin coming to his rescue and his expression darkened. But then, streaks of flowing light burst from the pearl in Li Quantao’s hand, and rose into the clouds. Thunder roared overhead, and droplets of water began to rise from beneath their feet, joining the clouds above.

Li Xizhi immediately felt lighter, and the mana required to ride the Heavenly Glow dropped sharply. Tuoba Chongyuan, momentarily obstructed, gave Li Xizhi a chance to breathe. His complexion regained color, but what caught him off guard was the dharma artifact in the young man’s hand.

That’s the Water Wall Pearl! He’s from Li Encheng’s line!

Li Encheng had been nicknamed Water Wall Pearl precisely because of this very artifact. It was an ancient dharma artifact retrieved from the ruins of the Mifan Sect. It was well-known throughout their sect. Now that Li Encheng had passed, this young man was likely his descendant.

He’s... willing to help me? thought Li Xizhi.

He had taken every detour through the mountains and planned for every possibility to preserve his life. But he had never expected that rescue would come from someone of Fuchen Peak. But though he was stunned, he didn’t slow his hands. The pill’s energy surged through him, and he launched a Heavenly Glow spell art skyward.

Tuoba Chongyuan scanned the newcomer with his spiritual sense. Li Quantao was merely at the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. He wasn’t worth notice, much just like Yu Yuwei’s two disciples. So Tuoba Chongyuan launched an attack with a casual wave of his sleeve.

But Li Quantao was the son of a great alchemy master; he was gifted and well-resourced. More importantly, he wielded the ancient dharma artifact, the Water Wall Pearl. When he unleashed his mana, streams of gray-white water of the Mansion Water burst forth, merging with the surrounding wind.

Mansion Water Dao were rare even in the southern Jiangnan region, let alone in the north. Tuoba Chongyuan suddenly felt the spiritual winds beside him turn wild and unruly beneath his feet. He had to halt mid-air to stabilize himself.

“Mansion Water...” muttered Tuoba Chongyuan.

Tuoba Chongyuan’s expression shifted at once, and his eyes showed interest. He stared at the glimmering pearl, and a look of realization crossed his face.

He still had the leisure to comment, “Hearing about it doesn’t compare to seeing it! Our Emperor Wu of Great Liang founded the nation after slaying dragons and phoenixes, obtaining both the Converging Water and Inferior Water pearls. The one in your hand must be a replica from an ancient cultivator.”

The glow around him dimmed slightly. He didn’t need a weapon; he simply cast a spell that made the Water Wall Pearl tremble violently. Li Xizhi and Li Quantao joined forces to barely block the blow, but Tuoba Chongyuan was pressing hard. After ten or so exchanges, Li Quantao’s face was beginning to pale.

Li Xizhi was in dire condition; he should’ve escaped while he could. But if he broke away now, it wasn’t clear whether he could even make it out, and the youth who’d come to save him would likely die in his place.

So he gritted his teeth and stayed, defending alongside the youth. He coordinated quickly with Li Quantao with his spiritual sense.

The young man responded, “Peak Master, I am Li Quantao of Fuchen Peak! This man is too fierce. Yuan Huyuan wouldn’t open the formation, but some of our kin are not far from here. We should fight and retreat. We need to head south!”

Li Xizhi immediately understood. He focused on calming his breath while Li Quantao took the lead. His mana boiled over, and his Dao foundation manifested as he bought time with reckless abandon.

Though Li Quantao's cultivation was comparatively weak, his dharma artifact was formidable. The white water barrier deflected spell arts while he fought to stall Tuoba Chongyuan. The latter had just come out of a battle and was still without his weapon. Thus, Li Quantao managed to hold his ground for several exchanges.

But Li Quantao’s complexion had already begun to pale after just a dozen exchanges. The blessing of the great seal allowed Tuoba Chongyuan’s every move to strike like a dharma artifact. Had he not lost his favored weapon, Li Quantao would have long since been knocked from the sky.

Even with multiple peak masters from Baixiang Valley, things turned out like this... I can’t afford to underestimate him.

Li Quantao, though not powerful, had some battle experience. He quickly swallowed a pill, triggering a downpour of Mansion Water currents. Even while coughing up blood from a blow, he responded via spiritual sense to Li Xizhi, “Don’t worry, Peak Master! It’s just a seven minutes’ journey. I, Quantao, can hold out until then!”

Tuoba Chongyuan’s expression darkened. He had already spent far too long pursuing Li Xizhi, and had ventured too deep into enemy territory. Though he was still confident, he began to weigh whether the kill was truly worth it.

Tension surged between the three of them, until suddenly, a burst of light flared in the sky.

Boom!

The sky brightened abruptly. The spiritual aura of heaven and earth shifted violently, and the rise of several glowing halos caused the sky to hum in resonance. In the distance, a mountain quaked and shattered.

Li Xizhi squinted as the sky turned red. A massive arc of golden light flickered in the distance, followed by a piece of golden brilliance plummeting from the sky. Two crisp cracks rang out as a stretch of buildings materialized and dropped into the distant mountains.

Could it be a fluctuation in spiritual aura... causing something from a grotto heaven to fall into our realm?

In that split second, several thoughts flashed through Li Xizhi’s mind. He grabbed Li Quantao and the two of them activated Blood Escape Technique, launching into the sky under the crimson heavens as they fled south.

But Tuoba Chongyuan didn’t follow. Instead, the devil cultivator stopped where he was. He shut his eyes and cast a spell. Li Quantao had barely survived that last bout thanks to his dharma artifact, so he watched with growing dread.

Sure enough, only a few kilometers into their escape, six beams of white light chased after them. Unlike the previous pale-white hue, these were much thicker. The lights were tinged faintly with yellow. Alarmed, Li Quantao pulled out a talisman.

Li Xizhi also activated several talismans, raising the Calamity Dispelling Heart Cauldron in his hand to dispel the spell arts. Li Quantao summoned the Water Wall Pearl again and smashed it directly toward the incoming beams without hesitating.

Boom!

The white light clashed with the dharma artifact and instantly shattered into tens of thousands of blade-like fragments. Li Xizhi’s mana shields lasted only two seconds before the blades landed on his feathered robe.

Golden light burst from the robe once again and dissolved the remaining blades. In the end, he only coughed up a mouthful of blood. The robe, which was a gift from his wife, had saved his life yet again. Li Xizhi quickly took a pill and looked to the youth beside him.

Li Quantao had taken a full face of blade fragments. A talisman had shielded his head, but he still coughed twice and reached into the air to catch his severed arm and leg. He hastily reattached them.

The Mansion Water Dao foundation body had strange properties. Unlike typical Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, such injuries were not fatal. He recalled the Water Wall Pearl and rode the blood wind once more.

Despite everything, his tone remained warm as he said, “The Water Wall Pearl’s core is incredibly tough, it can even withstand attacks from a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. No need to worry.”

Tuoba Chongyuan had vanished from view. Li Xizhi exhaled deeply. Finally, he had the space to think of something else, There’s still the Sun Seeker Ring back home, which is just as sturdy and unpredictable. But it’s tied to Green Pine Temple. I’ve never dared to use it...

As he and Li Quantao passed another checkpoint, the grand formation still shimmered brightly, clearly refusing to let them enter. The young man’s face darkened, but he said nothing more, simply stating, “Peak Master, follow me. My elder brother oversees a formation not far from here. We can enter there.”

Li Xizhi scanned the surroundings, Tuoba Chongyuan was still nowhere in sight. But neither of them dared to relax. They continued to flee on their blood light until they reached a green mountain in under seven minutes.

Li Quantao clearly held more authority here than at Chengdu Pass. He didn’t even report as he waved his command token and brought Li Xizhi inside. The area beyond the formation was a mess, filled with the rubble of the many collapsed buildings.

Yet, despite the disarray, the morale remained stable. Li Quantao asked around briefly, then turned back and said, “Peak Master... my elder brother has gone to provide support and hasn’t returned yet. This place is still relatively safe. Please rest and recover without worry.”

Li Xizhi finally allowed himself to relax. Pain surged through every bone and limb, while head spun and vision blurred. He forced himself to stay upright and said, “No need for such courtesy. Thank you, brother... Some debts are too great for words.”

“Hey, don’t mention it.” Li Quantao was not in much better shape himself. His internal injuries were far more severe. He wasn’t some reckless youth acting on passion. He had agreed to intercept and aid Li Xizhi out of gratitude, and partly because he thought his brother was stationed here.

But he had underestimated Tuoba Chongyuan in every regard. In the end, the wounds he suffered were far worse than expected. Now, realizing his brother wasn’t even in the formation made him break out in a cold sweat, he thought, Thank the heavens that devil didn’t keep chasing... If he had pressed on and my brother wasn’t here, both of us, and the entire formation’s cultivators, would’ve been buried together!

After fleeing and fighting for so long, both men were thoroughly exhausted in both body and spirit alike. Whatever needed doing could wait until they had healed. Each found a cave dwelling and began silent recovery.

Li Xizhi sat cross-legged and carefully calculated. His feathered robe had sustained damage again, its lifespan reduced by a decade or so, but it had saved his life.

Fortunately, I had the Autumn Convergence Pill... Fortunately... that favor was repaid.

————

I’ve missed the appointed time.

Tuoba Chongyuan furrowed his brows, but his hands didn’t slow. He had sent six beams of white light after the fleeing blood escape, yet he decisively abandoned the two and turned back in haste, flying swiftly in the direction from which he had come.

Breaking through the formation had always been his main goal, while chasing the man in the feathered robe was merely a convenient aside. If he couldn’t catch him, so be it. It was only a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. But if he delayed family matters... that would be a real problem.

He flew over five kilometers before his celestial chariot rolled through white mist to catch up. Gone was Tuoba Chongyuan’s earlier ease, he poured mana into the chariot and sped back with urgency.

After a moment of spellcasting and calculation, he followed the spell art and descended into a forest. There, buried in a mossy green boulder, stood his spear, its dharma light glimmering faintly.

Since the dharma artifact had been sealed by Li Xizhi, he couldn’t summon it directly and had to retrieve it himself. He landed carelessly before the stone and gave it a tug, but it didn’t budge.

"Hm?"

He felt a sudden jolt and whipped around. A youth, dressed in a Daoist robe patterned with cloud motifs and with neatly combed hair, emerged from within the tangled red-tinted mist.

The young man greeted him politely, "Fellow Daoist, that spear happens to be mine."

Tuoba Chongyuan was already in a foul mood, and an angry laugh slipped out of him. He was eager to return and in no mood for distractions.

As he slowly exerted more force on the spear, he replied coldly, "Bold of you!"

Just as he was about to speak harsher words, he paused. The spear remained firmly embedded in the stone, unmoved despite his strength. His expression darkened further.

The youth gave a slight bow as he calmly studied him. He smiled. "I came here under orders to take a share of the spoils. It was quite the coincidence when a spear fell from the heavens, landing right before me. I thought I had stumbled upon a fine dharma artifact for free...

"So it belongs to a young master of the Tuoba Family, no wonder you throw things around so generously!"

He nodded approvingly, looking quite pleased as he continued, "Your esteemed family hasn’t dared set foot in the Eastern Sea since the death of Tuoba Xuantan. It’s so rare to see one of you. I mean no disrespect, just that I intend to kill you."

Tuoba Chongyuan felt something off. He stared at the youth, whose identity had become increasingly clear. The youth quietly gripped a jade talisman in his hand. A swirl of yellow and white rose around his face as he gathered power.

"Dongfang Heyun, at your service, Young Master." The youth tidied his sleeves, cupped his hands in greeting, and grinned. "Young Master, why haven’t you run yet? Hurry along and go save your life!"
