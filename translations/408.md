# Chapter 536: Tremors

In the blink of an eye, Captain Chen felt an instant chilling sensation on his neck and when he reached for his waist, he found that the jade pendant he kept there had disappeared.

As he looked up again, a black flame materialized before him. He barely had time to raise his hands in defense before he was sent rolling on the ground. Xu Xiao glanced at him with disdain as he sneered coldly.

"All you cultivate are worthless techniques."

Captain Chen was shocked to be so easily overpowered by a cultivator at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Alarm bells rang in his mind—he suspected possession by a devil. As panic set in, he reached for his communication talisman to call for help.

"Seize!"

Xu Xiao raised a crimson command token, its surface adorned with ancient runes. With a sharp command, the token emitted a gentle red glow, shooting out like lightning right away.

Captain Chen let out two hoarse gasps before collapsing to his knees, his arms hanging limp by his sides. In a single move, his mind had been subdued, leaving him helpless.

Fearing that delaying would attract other Jade Court Guards, Xu Xiao acted swiftly. He formed a black seal in his hand, calmly stepping forward and pressing his palm into Captain Chen's chest.

Knowing that injuring or killing a Jade Court Guard would cause significant trouble, Xu Xiao had held back during their fight. Now, instead of striking a fatal blow, he planted a spell within Captain Chen's body. Once the seal took hold, he withdrew his token and watched as the man slowly regained consciousness.

Captain Chen emerged from his stupor, confused and disoriented. When clarity returned, his eyes filled with fear. Gripping his long blade, he appeared ready to fight once more.

Xu Xiao sneered, "Captain Chen, think carefully. We are in the same boat now."

The realization dawned on Captain Chen and he quickly scanned his body with his spiritual sense. With a heavy heart, he dropped his blade, despair washing over him. He thought bitterly to himself, I could die, but I can't doom my family along with me!

He reluctantly asked, "Who... who are you?"

Xu Xiao's expression remained calm.

"I know your family lives within the Li Family's territory... I will not force you into anything. Just pretend none of this happened. That way, you save your life and your family stays safe."

Xu Xiao's voice lowered, his tone measured and persuasive.

"Just turn a blind eye and let me leave. When the time comes, I will take Lingzhen and be gone without causing any trouble."

With his words precisely calibrated and the token subtly influencing Captain Chen's mind, Xu Xiao turned away confidently.

Caught in an agonizing inner struggle, Captain Chen watched Xu Xiao leave. Unable to resist the pull of self-preservation, he took off, flying toward the mountains as if nothing had happened.

Xu Xiao, observing his departure, smiled smugly, Whatever I want to do by the time I leave is beyond your control!

He then leisurely made his way back.

In the grand hall, Li Chengliao sat at the head of the room, holding a jade slip. A white-furred monkey stood nearby. The tall creature carried a staff on its back and wore a stern expression.

This white monkey, now at the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, seldom spoke and rarely interacted with others. Its unwavering loyalty to the Li Family made it the perfect guardian for Li Chengliao.

Kneeling below him was Chen Mufeng, bowing his head in submission as he made his report.

"You are telling me Xu Xiao took two strikes from Old Man Liu and left wounded?" Li Chengliao said aloud as he listened carefully, pondering for a moment before his expression softened with a trace of guilt. "Seems I have been too harsh, envious of his talents... I may have wronged him."

Chen Mufeng remained silent, not daring to speak. Li Chengliao, known for his mild temperament, continued calmly, "Since that is the case, let us put this dispute with the Liu Family to rest. However... I fear Old Man Liu may pressure his daughter. Bring him here—I will explain the situation to him."

"Right away!" Chen Mufeng responded as he respectfully withdrew.

Li Chengliao sat in contemplation, considering how to smooth things over so he could return to his cultivation quickly.

"Xu Xiao may have potential, but he is not one to submit to others. It is best to foster goodwill, give him some Spirit Stones, and let him leave. My humble house cannot shelter a grand figure like him."

As these thoughts ran through his mind, an elderly figure shuffled into the hall, trembling as he kneeled before Li Chengliao. It was none other than Old Man Liu, who, despite his usual arrogance within the estate, now prostrated himself in silence.

"Liu Yi of the Liu Family pays respects to Family Head!"

He bowed deeply, his forehead damp with sweat, his voice trembling with respect.

"Family Head Liu, since your daughter Lingzhen and Xu Xiao have mutual affection, you should do them the favor of allowing their union. Let them pick a date, and I shall play the role of matchmaker on their wedding day!" Li Chengliao said as he stayed seated at the head of the hall and read from the jade slip in his hand, sipping tea calmly.

In his younger days, Old Man Liu had been a notorious wastrel, yet he had witnessed and heard of the Li Family's rise to power, leaving him deeply shaken. Due to Liu Rouxuan's connection, he had even met Li Tongya once.

At the time, he was still young and kneeled trembling before Li Tongya, too terrified to even raise his head. He could only hear Li Tongya addressing him by his full name and asking a few questions about the Liu Family's affairs, which had left his legs weak.

Now in his old age, Liu Yi had at least come to understand the gravity of situations and the value of life. However, with his fate in the hands of another, he could not find the words to speak.

Li Chengliao, noticing the silence, raised his eyebrows and glanced at him inquisitively.

"Hmm?"

That single sound shattered Liu Yi's courage. Torn between covering for Xu Xiao to save him and trembling with indecision, sweat streamed down his face. Before Li Chengliao could say a word, Liu Yi had already pressed his forehead to the ground repeatedly, sobbing uncontrollably.

Li Chengliao's smile slowly faded as he scrutinized the old man. Taking a step down from his seat, the crisp sound of his jade-tipped boots echoed on the steps below his robe.

He stood silently, watching as Liu Yi's sweat soaked the ground, realizing that something must be terribly wrong. In a low, heavy voice, he asked, "Liu Yi... what is going on?"

The mention of his name hit Liu Yi like a thunderclap, causing his legs to shake uncontrollably. Finally, the weight of the situation crushed him, and he wailed loudly, "Ancestor, Xu—"

He had only managed to utter the first syllable when the white monkey behind Li Chengliao opened its eyes, stepped forward, and reached for the old man.

But it was already too late. Black flames erupted from Liu Yi's body, bursting from his chest and abdomen with a thunderous boom. Blood splattered throughout the hall, sending his organs flying in all directions.

Black blood spouted like a fountain, filling the air. Li Chengliao stumbled back in shock, yet black stains still marred the hem of his robe, splattering across his chest and collar.

From within the boiling black blood, a dark seal shot upward, attempting to escape. However, a large furry hand swiftly reached out and deftly grasped the black light.

The black light struggled to break free, thrashing wildly amidst the overwhelming demonic energy surrounding it. Although it held a higher power, it was relentlessly ground down by the furry hand's immense force.

The white monkey withdrew its hand while Li Chengliao wiped the bloodstains from his collar. He removed his robe and draped it over his arm.

"Captain Chen!"

Li Chengliao's sudden shout rang through the hall. Hanging his robe carefully on the back of a chair, he saw Chen Mufeng rush in, his pupils dilating at the sight of the carnage.

Overwhelmed by fear, Chen Mufeng dropped to his knees with a thud, stammering, "I accept my punishment..."

Torn between fear and hatred toward Xu Xiao, Chen Mufeng also felt a flicker of relief that he was dealing with Li Chengliao. Had it been Li Yuanping, he would have kicked him to the ground without a word, leaving no room for explanations.

Facing away from him, Li Chengliao struggled to contain his anger, "Kneeling will not help. Gather the men immediately and secure the Xu Family... Xu Xiao might not even know yet."

Chen Mufeng leaped to his feet instantly and dashed out the door. Li Chengliao's voice echoed after him, "If he escapes, do not bother coming back."

Chen Mufeng responded with urgency, disappearing into the distance. Meanwhile, Li Chengliao was plagued by unease, recalling the old matter with Chu Yi from Yufu Prefecture. He knew too many hidden truths, and his mind remained clear despite the circumstances—Xu Xiao was no Chu Yi.

"With the cautionary tales of the Kong Family and Chu Yi, I cannot afford to be careless."

Calling yet another attendant forward, he ordered, "Keep a close watch on the Liu Family, especially Liu Lingzhen."

At that moment, Li Chengliao abandoned any thoughts of saving face or fostering harmony. His mind was now consumed with fear and hatred. Wasting no time, he summoned the white monkey, and together they took to the skies, heading toward Mount Qingdu.

Upon arriving at the mountain, the hall stood empty except for a young woman seated in the courtyard, combing her hair. Her phoenix-like eyes and fine eyebrows gave her an elegant, noble appearance.

Seeing her, Li Chengliao's heart sank. With a grim expression, he greeted her, "Auntie."

Although Li Yuexiang was younger than him, her seniority was much higher. Noticing his anxious demeanor, she asked, "Why the rush? My brother has already entered seclusion."

Hearing that Li Xijun was in seclusion, Li Chengliao's heart sank further. Li Yuexiang continued, "He sensed an opportunity to break through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm a few days ago, so he hurried into seclusion. It is best not to disturb him."

This is bad!

Although Li Chengliao knew there was not much benefit in sharing all the details with Li Yuexiang, he still gave her a brief account of the situation.

After listening, Li Yuexiang set down her comb, her expression thoughtful.

"So, he carries a thread of fate within him... That is why our brother suddenly went into seclusion, and Grandfather and Elder Donghe led a group of Qi Cultivation Realm disciples eastward to congratulate Daoist Master Houfu, leaving us with weakened defenses?"

Her words sent a chill through Li Chengliao as it was only then did he realize that many of their key Qi Cultivators had gone east. He responded grimly, "Can the thread of fate truly be so potent? Could this not all just be a coincidence?"

Li Yuexiang tied up her hair and answered, "Let us not lose our composure. Before going into seclusion, Brother left me a jade. It can summon him. Do you want to try it?"

Li Chengliao nodded decisively and said in a low voice, "Please awaken Eighth Uncle. This matter is too important! It is better to err on the side of caution, even if it means striking preemptively... I will take full responsibility."

Li Yuexiang took a jade pendant from her sleeve and murmured, "Do not speak of taking responsibility like that."

With a light squeeze, she crushed the jade talisman into powder.

At the Qingdu Cave Dwelling.

Li Xijun, looking slightly pale, stepped out of the cave dwelling, where several people were already waiting for him. He scanned them briefly, took a letter, and one of the Jade Court Guards stepped forward, bowing respectfully, "My Lord. The Clan Affairs Courtyard has sent word... there seems to be trouble with Young Master Chengliao."

"Trouble with Chengliao..?" Li Xijun frowned. The Cheng and Ming generation of the Li Family were not particularly gifted, except for the promising young Li Chenghuai. The only other noteworthy member was Li Chengliao, who was known for being courteous and steady.

"What happened?" Li Xijun asked.

"It appears to involve a conflict with the Xu Family in town... all over a woman," the guard reported.

"What?!" Li Xijun's expression darkened. Chengliao had always conducted himself well on the mountain; he never expected him to cause such trouble the moment he went down to town. However, without more details, Li Xijun held back his judgment and said quietly, "We will put this matter aside for now. Summon Yuexiang."

He figured that Yuexiang's urgent summons had to mean something serious was unfolding. His thoughts immediately turned to the possibility that their elders overseas were in trouble, prompting the use of the jade talisman to request aid. A sense of unease weighed heavily on him.

As he was about to get up, another figure rushed in and reported, "My Lord, the young lady and young master are here to see you."

Li Xijun sat back down and gestured with his hand.

"Let them in."

Li Yuexiang and Li Chengliao hurriedly stepped forward but without fully grasping the situation, Li Xijun calmly invited them to sit. However, Chengliao did not even take the time to sit before speaking urgently in a low voice, "Eighth Uncle! There is someone down in the town who might carry a thread of fate, just like what happened with Chu Yi."

This news was entirely beyond Li Xijun's expectations and far more serious than he had anticipated. His brows shot up in shock, and he asked gravely, "Where is this person? Have they made contact? How far have they gone?"

"Chengliao has already controlled the situation," Li Chengliao replied. "Though not as terrifying as Chu Yi, there is still something unsettling about him. He may carry a thread of fate and cannot be taken lightly."

Li Xijun rubbed the jade pendant hanging from his waist, pondering briefly. Just then, the lake beside Qingdu began to churn violently, and a gust of sinister wind swept through the courtyard. A young man dressed in black descended hurriedly, his piercing snake-like eyes scanning the surroundings before bowing his head, "Master, do you have orders for me?"

This was Li Wushao, whose twin hooked tail had already reformed, solidifying his combat prowess. Li Yuanjiao had assigned him to guard and train within the family grounds. Li Xijun spoke softly, "Something has gone wrong within the clan. I must rely on you, Senior Wushao."

Two streaks of black light swirled within the shadow beneath Wushao's feet. He nodded and stepped back behind Li Xijun.

"Let us go!" Li Xijun commanded.

Li Chengliao nodded in response, but Li Xijun hesitated momentarily and extended a hand to block his sister, Li Yuexiang. "You two must not go," he said solemnly, "People like this are often unpredictable and dangerous. I fear they might use underhanded means."

Li Yuexiang paused briefly, then retrieved a talisman from her sleeve and placed it into her brother's hands gently.

"Brother, this was left to me by Father. Take it for your protection. You must be cautious—who knows how strong this person is."

Li Xijun gave a silent nod, then summoned the wind and flew swiftly toward the town. From a distance, he could already see several figures patrolling the air above, maintaining a loose but watchful presence. The Li estate appeared as usual on the surface, yet a subtle tension filled the air, as if it were braced for something.

A Jade Court Guard whispered the gathered intelligence in Li Xijun's ear, guiding him toward the Xu Family estate from afar. "My Lord, the target is at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm... Should we send someone to provoke the devil cultivator from the Xu Family and lure him out for you to observe?" the guard asked quietly.

"There is no need for such trouble," Li Xijun responded, forming a concealment spell. He remained high in the clouds, refraining from probing with his spiritual senses. Instead, his eyes glimmered with a pale light, cold as frost and hazy as mist as he focused his gaze downward.

The Xu Family's protective formation was rudimentary, designed merely to block external interference. With the enhancement of both his perception technique and talisman qi, the barrier quickly faded from his sight. In an instant, Li Xijun spotted a handsome youth standing within the courtyard.

"Third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm?!" he exclaimed in surprise.
