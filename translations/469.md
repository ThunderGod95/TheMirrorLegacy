# Chapter 684: Mu Moli

The grand formation on Mount Wu had originally been set up by Duanmu Kui, a formidable Purple Mansion Realm formation master. Unfortunately, Zhu Yue had welcomed Azure Pond after Duanmu Kui's death and this formation had long since been offered to the Azure Pond Sect.

Later, Jiao Zhongzi took control of Mount Wu and re-established the formation, sealing it tightly under a pitch-black light barrier.

A field of bones lay at the foot of the mountain. The grand priest shivered as he knelt before a boiling blood pool. A gray wind swooped down the mountain and coalesced into an elderly man in black robes. His deep, eerie eyes gazed coldly at the Mount Yue warrior before him.

The grand priest had finally received a response. His fear intertwined with joy as he cried out in terror, "My lord! Xian Du underestimated the enemy... The six towns were broken by the rebel army and all the generals were captured. Over five thousand have been killed or wounded. The rear army was also crushed, and are trampling over one another in panic. They were all driven into the six towns, which surrendered at the mere sight of the enemy. Their forces are now advancing upon the Northern Court..."

The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator's expression darkened, and he muttered coldly, "Useless trash."

This was none other than Mu Moli. He adjusted his black robes and casually swept the sacrificial offerings into his pouch. He rode the gray wind into the sky, where he hovered for a moment. He placed a finger between his eyebrows and listened intently.

"Grand Concord of Radiance."

"Grand Concord of Radiance."

He was cautious enough to listen carefully. Yet, he noticed that the rebel army had stopped fifty kilometers outside the royal court. He cursed under his breath as suspicion rose in his heart. He thought, Could someone be trying to lure me out of the mountain? And at the perfect fifty kilometers range to target my Immortal Foundation...

Mu Moli felt unease stirring deep within him. In these times, Weihou advances from the north, the world is shrouded in turmoil, and the wolves and tigers lie in wait. My senior brother has not returned for many years. I must remain vigilant.

He prepared to ride the wind back up the mountain. But at that moment, he felt a blistering heat surge behind him. The clouds above him were torn apart as a brilliant golden light descended with a thunderous roar.

"I’ve been waiting for you!"

Mu Moli instantly broke out in a cold sweat. His figure blurred as black smoke surged from under his feet. Fear gripped his heart as he thought, Who is it?!

The golden light shone brilliantly as white stone bricks appeared and seamlessly joined together to form a towering fortress gate. The majestic gate stood tall, with two massive white pillars engraved with intricate patterns.

Radiant light shimmered inside the gate. It was hazy yet dazzling, as if it contained a blazing sun. The burst of brilliance completely dissipated the black smoke beneath his feet. Mu Moli was momentarily stunned before he swiftly flicked his sleeves and released two Tortoise Shields.

Only now did he clearly see the figure seated cross-legged atop the radiant gate. The young man wore a smile and his Daoist robe billowed in the wind. The brilliant light illuminated the town and rivers beneath them as he grinned, "I, Ximing, was ordered to guard this place. I have been waiting for quite some time!"

Li Ximing had obtained the Radiant Essence Scripture, and had spent a long time refining his mana. Though his Immortal Foundation Realm was not as perfect as the orthodox version of the Radiant Essence Scripture, it was nevertheless profound, resembling a great sun suspended in the sky.

"Li Ximing?" Mu Moli never expected to truly find someone from the Li Family. In that instant, disbelief struck him, and he regretted, I was too careless!

Mu Moli had not entirely dismissed the idea of the Li Family launching an attack, but he had assumed they would proceed methodically. He thought they would first crush the weaker Yu and Fei Families, who lacked even cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Then move on to the lone Huo Luo'e, before finally choosing to attack him.

He only wanted to hold Mount Wu for Jiao Zhongzi, and believed that the Li Family would not arrive so soon. However, because of this misjudgment, he had lingered too long and now found himself trapped.

"Damn it!" He silently formed a hand seal, causing the two Tortoise Shields to emit thick black mist that tried to mar the gate’s pillars. However, a searing brilliance scorched his face until his skin sizzled. Gritting his teeth, he shouted, "The Li Family is truly cunning and cautious! Though you have so many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, you still resort to such tricks to lure me out of the mountain!"

Li Ximing simply continued to channel his Immortal Foundation’s energy, pressing it down upon Radiant Origin Pass, and spoke softly, "Mount Wu was once the residence of Duanmu Kui. Even remnants of his techniques could spell eternal doom for mere Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators like us. Senior, your sorcery is profound, do not underestimate yourself."

Mu Moli felt as though he were sinking into a quagmire. The hazy yet dazzling light from the gate had set his robes ablaze. He could only discern that Li Ximing’s Immortal Foundation was of the Bright Yang lineage, which was skilled in suppression. Since he didn’t know where Li Qinghong and the others were, he spoke softly, "You seek only the lands of Mount Yue, Ximing. Let me go... I will return to the mountain and clean everything up, never to return... Why resort to bloodshed?"

The suppressive force within Radiant Origin Pass grew stronger. Li Ximing was more than happy to stall for time. He simply asked, "Tell me, where is Jiao Zhongzi?"

Mu Moli remained silent. He realized that the Li Family would never let him go. His expression turned grim as he retrieved a wooden talisman from his sleeve and crushed it, speaking coldly, "You wouldn’t even dare to plot against the north if not for my senior brother’s absence!"

Mount Wu trembled violently as soon as the talisman shattered. A river of black clouds surged from its peak, accompanied by a deafening susurration. The dark mass ascended rapidly, hurtling straight toward the two of them.

Boom!

Radiant Origin Pass trembled slightly as the black cloud condensed into a long-tailed black-furred panther. It was unmistakably Jiao Zhongzi’s mount. Its emerald-green eyes gleamed and it spoke in a thunderous voice, "Mu Moli! What kind of trouble have you stirred up this time? Calling for me in such a hurry!"

Mu Moli cursed back, "You fool... The Li Family is after Mount Wu!"

The beast was immediately startled. It leaped upward like a rolling cloud and attempted to pull Mu Moli free from Radiant Origin Pass. But then, a gust of freezing snow swept in from the east. The fierce wind and snow blew it away from the clouds.

Dressed in pristine white, Li Xijun approached with a sword strapped to his back. His refined features carried an otherworldly charm. He had two fingers pressed together as he summoned a piercing cold wind.

The young man nodded slightly, a faint smile on his lips as he said, "Greetings, fellow cultivator."

The Li Family was renowned for their swordsmanship. Even though Li Xijun had yet to draw his sword, the beast was already wary. The two Li brothers stood in the sky and exuded the aura of a celestial family from a major sect.

Mu Moli had exchanged dozens of moves with Li Ximing, yet he remained trapped within the brilliant radiance. His face was covered in red welts and his lips were pale. Frustration seethed within him.

He could tell that Li Ximing lacked combat experience and did not know any particularly powerful spell arts. Yet, his Immortal Foundation Realm was overwhelmingly strong. No matter how many shamanic spells Mu Moli cast, the Radiant Origin Pass held him firmly in place.

Moreover, the gate seemed naturally suited for suppression and eradication, which made escape even harder. Though Li Ximing could not defeat him outright, Mu Moli’s mana and blood essence were steadily depleting. He was getting pulled deeper into the trap.

"Ju Wu, assist me at once!" shouted Mu Moli.

As a seasoned cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Realm, Mu Moli immediately recognized that Li Xijun had only recently broken through. His once-hopeless heart stirred with renewed vigor as he thought, It’s not Li Qinghong with her Profound Thunder Dao Foundation Realm! Just a newly ascended Foundation Establishment brat... My chance lies here!

Mu Moli’s spirits lifted at once. If he were facing Li Qinghong, who wielded thunder and lightning, he would truly be doomed. So he urgently called upon the beast, Ju Wu, for help.

The panther-like demonic beast glanced at the scene and spat out a gust of wind as it charged forward. But before it could reach Mu Moli, Li Xijun formed a hand seal and chanted an incantation. He kept his two fingers pressed together as dozens of white streams burst forth. Waves of cold light transformed into fine, pine-needle-like snowflakes. The waves were carried by the wind as it swept toward Ju Wu.

“Hah! You—” The demonic beast had barely spoken when the chilling yin qi pierced through its body. Snowflakes gently descended from the sky and Ju Wu’s movements stalled. Li Xijun calmly reached for his sharp sword and unsheathed it in one smooth motion.

Clang!

A dazzling white sword light flashed. The Foundation Establishment Realm sword, Han Lin, had been forged for over a decade. Now, it finally displayed its true brilliance. The slender blade danced and its fierce radiance gleamed like snow.

Celestial Moon Slash!

All the snowflakes in the surrounding space shifted an inch in unison. Ju Wu let out a sorrowful wail as two short, thick claws flew into the air. Li Xijun had wielded a sword since he was a child. He had practiced against the falling snow in the mountains. Forty years later, he felt an exhilarating satisfaction as his blade tasted blood.

Many in the Li Family had mastered Celestial Moon Slash in the past century. Li Xuanling had great talent in swordsmanship but had perished too soon. Li Yuanjiao treated the sword merely as a tool for killing and did not refine his technique. Their Celestial Moon Slash was always the same pale-blue glow that merely imitated the sword of Li Chejing.

Only Li Tongya’s Celestial Moon Slash had ever been as grand as a ship’s sail. His slash carried a deep and vast sword force. He had truly made it his own sword. Now, as Li Xijun unleashed a fierce and drifting snow-white light, he finally stepped beyond mere imitation.

Threefold Moonlight!

His sword flicked back, releasing three agile streaks of white light. As he wielded his blade, admiration flashed across Li Xijun’s mind, The sword canon is profound. One could spend a lifetime and never exhaust its mysteries. My ancestor only wielded the blade for fifteen years before composing this text. Such a talent, truly peerless.

But his sword did not slow even as he reflected. Slaughter Jun Kui Light was a perfect complement for his swordsmanship. Ju Wu struggled to cast any magic, let alone defend against the sword as he was already bound by the spell. It was struck again and again until it vomited black blood.

Ju Wu was utterly terrified. It had been reduced to nothing more than a mount though it was a demonic beast. It was already weaker than most rogue cultivators. How could it endure such swordplay? In despair, it cried, “To hell with aiding you, Mu Moli... I’m about to be slain!”

Mu Moli, still locked in a stalemate with Li Ximing, felt a chill in his heart. He spoke coldly, “Leave at once! Find our senior brother!”

Mu Moli swallowed several pills, forcing his Immortal Foundation into full operation. His eyes gleamed with a faint red light as he retrieved a bronze tablet. He grasped his own shoulder and with a sickening crunch, tore off his own arm.

Before the blood could even flow, he hurled the severed arm high into the air. A flash of red light erupted as it transformed into a massive green-faced, fanged demon that charged fiercely at Li Xijun.

“Finally, a proper shamanic spell,” muttered Li Xijun. Li Xijun let the demon rush forward, knowing that Kongheng would handle it. Examining the creature with interest, he stepped forward, drawing his sword.

Although Mount Wu carried a lineage of shamanic cultivation, Duanmu Kui himself, along with his disciples, had followed the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Dao. Though Duanmu Kui likely possessed knowledge of shamanic spells, he rarely taught them. He only left a few techniques for his disciples to study on their own.

As a result, the shamanic spells used by the Mount Yue cultivators were a mix of Daoist and shamanic arts. It was often awkward and incomplete. Now that he was bearing witness to a fully realized shamanic spell for the first time, Li Xijun observed it carefully.

The green-faced demon stood over twenty feet tall, with a grotesque visage and a mouthful of fangs. Its body was covered in intricate runes, but instead of emitting mana, it radiated a faint green aura.

After a few sword strikes, Li Xijun noticed that the demon’s body was soft, almost like clay. It regenerated quickly but seemed particularly vulnerable to spell arts.

Forming a spell seal, he channeled Slaughter Jun Kui Light, and sure enough, the demon’s green aura rapidly diminished. He took out various talismans and started testing them one by one, silently memorizing their effects.

While Li Xijun conducted his experiments, Mu Moli was still struggling against Li Ximing after over a hundred exchanges. Forming a quick seal, he slapped his storage pouch and flung several skulls into the air.

The black smoke around him surged into the skulls, transforming into five or six shadowy mountain ghosts that shrieked as they charged toward Li Ximing. The ghosts were attempting to bypass Radiant Origin Pass and strike directly at his body.

Yet, the moment the ghosts rose, four ancient sigils on the left pillar of Radiant Origin Pass flared to life and immediately repelled the ghosts.

Li Ximing laughed. "My Bright Yang may not compare to Profound Thunder against such filth, but it ranks among the best. Senior, don’t bother with these petty tricks!"

But just as Li Ximing unleashed Radiant Origin Pass, Mu Moli transformed into a streak of crimson light and fled. Taking no chances, Li Xijun immediately gave chase. But, a figure emerged in the distant mist. The silhouette swept his sleeve and captured Mu Moli with ease.

Li Ximing stopped, brows furrowed. He was momentarily stunned as he watched the figure glide effortlessly through the air on a white, porcelain-like flying shuttle.

"This..."

The man bore the marks of age and wear, yet his expression was warm. His deep-set eyes and long face carried a serene demeanor. His white hair and beard had streaks of gray running through it as it framed his face. Dressed in a flowing white robe with cloud-patterned sleeves, he stood with his hands behind his back.

Several medicine pouches hung from his waist. In his hand, he held the transformed Mu Moli, effortlessly containing the crimson light’s movements no matter how it twisted and surged.

He met Li Ximing’s eyes and spoke in a gentle voice, "Ming'er."
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝔀𝓮𝒃𝙣𝓸𝒗𝒆𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝒎

Li Ximing quickly kneeled in respect. His voice was choked with emotion as he reverently greeted, "Disciple Ximing greets Master!"

Li Xijun immediately understood and followed suit, bowing as he respectfully addressed, "Greetings, Senior Xiao!"
