# Chapter 722: Sovereign's Perilous Tread

‘If the Li Clan's techniques were inferior, why would the Cui Clan even propose an exchange?’ Li Ximing’s hesitation was born from this exact thought. Cui Xianye instantly grasped the situation. To spare the Daoist Master any awkwardness, he spoke with deep respect.

"Daoist Master, our *Sovereign's Perilous Tread* is merely a fourth-grade technique, and it comes with only a single secret art. How could it possibly compare to your clan's esteemed immortal methods? Furthermore, the *Upper Mansion Audience Scripture* is one of our most fundamental treasures. I would never dare offer it without the express permission of my elders."

Decisively, he dropped to his knees and bowed low.

"This junior is willing to present the technique to you, Daoist Master. In return, I ask only for a single favor. Your divine abilities are as radiant as the sun, a shield for all of Chongzhou. Should our clan ever face a crisis, I pray you will protect our peace and safety."

Li Ximing paused, his mind racing.

'A single favor for a Purple Mansion cultivation method? Even if it's only fourth-grade with a single secret art… it's still a *Purple Mansion* technique!'

Cultivation in the Purple Mansion realm was vastly different from Foundation Establishment. Upon breaking through, a cultivator couldn't immediately begin working on their next divine ability. First, they had to refine their current one to the point of perfection. This could be a slow, grinding process, taking decades of patient cultivation to max out the ability. Or, one could accelerate the process by using various spiritual treasures, pills, or specific continuation arts.

Once a divine ability was perfected, the cultivator had to immediately begin on the next. To do this, they needed a Purple Mansion technique to condense a new Immortal Foundation within their sea of Qi and then transfer it to their Shengyang Acupoint. Aided by their existing divine ability, the process was less arduous than the initial breakthrough to Foundation Establishment, but it still demanded a great deal of time.

Some cultivators could resort to unorthodox methods, like refining pills or even consuming another's Immortal Foundation, using specific arts to absorb it directly into their Shengyang Acupoint and gestate a new power. But for someone like Li Ximing, the only path forward was to follow a proper Purple Mansion technique, building his power step by painstaking step. Without such a technique, he would be trapped with a single divine ability until his death. Its importance to him was immeasurable.

For a cultivator like Ning Tiaoxiao, who had been stuck in the early Purple Mansion realm for years without a proper technique, a method like this would be priceless. He would trade almost anything for it. A Purple Mansion expert might scheme endlessly for such an opportunity; a single favor was a pittance in comparison.

Though Li Ximing generally trusted the Cui Clan, he didn't accept the offer right away. He took a slow sip of tea, saying nothing. Cui Xianye, his forehead still pressed to the floor, continued to speak.

"The Cui Clan has been isolated overseas for a millennium, but our loyalty has never wavered. In all the dealings between our two families, we have always supported one another. My request today is not merely a transaction; it is an appeal based on the bonds of our shared history."

"Our clan has the protection of a draconic ally, so we rarely face threats to our very foundation. The favor I ask is for a future possibility: if we ever discover the location of a Bright Yang spiritual object, we would need to ask for your aid in securing it."

Li Ximing was mostly convinced. He gave a thoughtful nod, a smile touching his lips.

"Favors are a part of any lasting relationship. As long as what you ask is within my power, I will certainly lend my aid."

"What's most important is that our families strengthen our ties. Everything else is a natural part of that friendship. Now that we're renewing our old bonds, the Cui Clan should send some of your younger generation to cultivate by the lake, and my Li Clan will send some of ours to your island."

Only then did Cui Xianye rise, taking a respectful step back.

"As you command, Daoist Master. The Jue generation of our clan is just now reaching maturity. I shall summon one for you to inspect."

He turned, first addressing Cui Wanqing.

"Go and fetch the *Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass*."

Cui Wanqing bowed with grave formality and departed. He then summoned another attendant.

"Bring Jueyin here."

The entire sequence of actions was a masterclass in showing respect, and Li Ximing couldn't help but admire the Cui Clan's discipline. A moment later, a figure entered the hall.

The man's features were pleasant enough, with well-defined brows, but what truly stood out was his scholarly and graceful bearing. He entered the hall, bowed first to Cui Xianye, then turned his attention to Li Ximing. He immediately took a respectful step back and bowed deeply.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Cui Xianye turned to make the introduction.

"This is Cui Jueyin, the second eldest of our Jue generation. He has been known since youth for his humility and grace, and is held in high esteem by the clan."

Li Ximing was in dire need of capable hands. Seeing that Cui Jueyin was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator and, more importantly, a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion clan, he was delighted. The Cui might have declined, but their heritage was undeniable.

"Jueyin," he said warmly, "would you be willing to return with me to the lake?"

Though he'd been summoned abruptly, Cui Jueyin was sharp. From Cui Xianye’s demeanor, Li Ximing’s welcoming tone, and the mention of "the lake," he had already pieced together the situation. He bowed again.

"To meet you, Daoist Master, and to have the chance to cultivate at the immortal lake is the greatest fortune of my life. I am both humbled and overjoyed to accept."

Li Ximing laughed heartily as Cui Wanqing returned, presenting a jade tray. "Daoist Master," she said softly, "the *Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass*, its secret art, and the activation incantations are here."

She presented the tray. On it lay three jade slips and a small jade box. Li Ximing swept his spiritual sense over them, identifying the contents: one slip for the *Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass*, one for its secret art, and a third containing the incantation to unlock them.

'A Purple Mansion technique, after all,' he thought. 'Even the unlocking incantation needs its own jade slip.'

Given its value, it was best to verify the contents immediately. Without delay, he used the incantation to access the scripture and began to read.

"The Divine Ability of the Supreme Radiance Profound Dharma Body is attained by embracing the nature of Bright Yang and treading a perilous path. Through the cycles of descent, one arrives at the realm of awakened clarity. With a focused heart and a purified will, the divine ability is forged. Only then is it understood that a treasured vessel finds its perfection through its flaws. From this emerges a form clad in profound robes and golden armor, borne upon a chariot drawn by a white luan..."

His eyes scanned to the end, where a particular phrase caught his attention. It was strikingly familiar.

"Shining upon the eight directions, all sovereigns pay homage. Ten thousand spirits bow in reverence. Supreme Radiance, the Celestial God!"

Those were the exact words of the casting incantation for his own technique, Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

'So, Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light and Sovereign's Perilous Tread are deeply connected!'

His spirits soared. He turned his attention to the secret art. Its name was *The Art of the Body That Breaks a Hundred Formations*. He read it through and muttered to himself.

"Isn't this just my clan's Folding technique? Why give it such a ridiculously long name?"

Li Ximing had studied all nine of his clan's secret arts. The text for *The Art of the Body That Breaks a Hundred Formations* was pathetically short compared to his own clan's version of the Folding technique. After reading it through once, he was simply stunned.

He couldn't stop himself from reading it a second time, his mind reeling.

'What??'

Li Ximing had always lamented how difficult it was to cultivate his clan's secret arts. He'd assumed they were the raw, original texts, full of archaic and obscure language. He often imagined that major sects like the Azure Pond or Golden Feather must have volumes of annotations and interpretations, allowing their disciples to learn with twice the results for half the effort.

But looking at this, he realized *this* was the original text. His clan's version was the heavily annotated one!

Reading *The Art of the Body That Breaks a Hundred Formations* made his scalp crawl. If his clan's version was a finely prepared cake, this was the raw, unhusked grain!

'No wonder it was so easy to learn…' he thought, a little deflated. 'And here I was, thinking I was a peerless genius…'

He gave a wry laugh, though he didn't feel particularly discouraged. His clan lacked the deep heritage of a major sect; it was only natural that his cultivation path would be smoother, and his understanding less profound than that of their core disciples.

He collected the jade slips and turned back to Cui Xianye.

"I will accept this technique," he said. "When you need my help, send a messenger inland."
