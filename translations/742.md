# Chapter 742: Arranging Affairs (Part 1)

"You dare lie to me."

The moment Li Ximing spoke, a purple flame erupted across the mountain, its celestial light illuminating everything. Bathed in the searing blaze, the stone bricks grew scorching hot. Wenhu, his face already pressed to the ground, didn't dare to lift his head as his skin began to sizzle.

The consequences of deceiving a Purple Mansion cultivator were one thing, but to be questioned so calmly by one was a psychological torment of an entirely different order.

Whatever Wenhu was thinking, Li Chenghuai, standing beside him, felt a chill shoot up his spine and into his skull. Even though he wasn't the one lying, fear gripped him.

'Uncle already possesses the aura of a Daoist Master!'

Li Ximing looked down at Wenhu, feeling more amusement than anger. The man's lie had been cleverly constructed, a mixture of truth and falsehood. The Secret Diffusion direct lineage disciple he mentioned was most likely the one who had been lured away by the Capital immortals Dao and tricked to his death by Wenhu himself. This matter involved the Purple Mansion realm and was highly secretive. If not for a passing mention from Chang Yun, Li Ximing would have had no way to confirm it.

Wenhu had based his lie on a real person he had actually been in contact with. This not only guarded against Li Ximing using divination but also ensured the details were accurate—after all, Wenhu knew too little about other Secret Diffusion Dao lineages to invent such a person from thin air.

Had Li Ximing lacked concrete information, Wenhu could have continued his fabrication. But the Li family had Fu Dou's head and had used advanced shamanic arts to determine he was killed in a sneak attack. The revelation of *The Xiaoshi Art of Clearing the Heavens and Scattering Clouds* was the final piece of evidence that sealed Wenhu's fate.

'In the span of a single breath, he concocted a complete story,' Li Ximing mused. 'If he hadn't been so desperate to prove his worth and offered up *The Xiaoshi Art of Clearing the Heavens and Scattering Clouds*, he might have left fewer loose ends.'

Li Ximing sipped his tea. Wenhu finally lifted his face, a scorched and blackened mess. It was impossible to tell if he was crying. Following a glance from Li Ximing, Li Chenghuai stepped forward, grabbed Wenhu’s chains, and said, "If you had just told the truth, the Daoist Master would have decided your fate. Why go to such lengths?"

Wenhu's eyes opened. They had been burned in their earlier fight and were now completely white. He looked up. "I've spent my life scheming and fighting in the Southern Sea. When I encounter a problem, I plot. If I succeed, it's my victory. If I fail, it's my loss. I have never been one to sit idly by and wait for a 'Daoist Master's judgment.'"

Li Ximing set down his jade cup. "Well said."

The word had barely left his lips when a torrent of celestial light wrapped in purple flames swept over Wenhu. His flesh and bone were torn away and incinerated, turning to ash in an instant. The chains and iron clasps etched with array patterns all melted away, leaving no trace. A moment ago, a Foundation Establishment cultivator had been kneeling there; now, he was gone, dispersed like smoke on the wind.

A faint clatter echoed as a few twisted, scorched pieces of metal—remnants of his shackles—fell to the ground. Wenhu had cultivated the art of Hurricane Ghost Yin, a technique completely suppressed by Bright Yang. The blast had not only killed him but had also erased his cultivation so thoroughly that not even a hint of a spiritual phenomenon remained.

Li Chenghuai, standing to the side, let out a silent breath. Li Ximing placed three jade slips on the table, rubbing his temples. "Chenghuai," he asked, "one art is Hurricane Ghost Yin, the other is Floating Cloud Body. Both are fourth-grade techniques and will be a great benefit to the clan's foundation. See if anyone in the family is interested in cultivating them."

Li Chenghuai considered this. "I will check which of the children are about to begin Qi Refining."

Li Ximing left the arrangements to him, though he knew that no matter which clan member was chosen, they would be too late for the spiritual trove of Xiaoshi Mountain. "The territories of Funan and Midong were taken over after we eliminated their sects and seized leverage over their great families," he said. "We brought some people back. Are there any promising talents from the same cave-heaven who cultivates a compatible Qi?"

"I will look into it, ancestor," Li Chenghuai replied.

He immediately sent someone to fetch the records. A court guard returned shortly with a jade slip, which Li Chenghuai began to read. The benefits of his meticulous administration were now clear; he had obviously kept careful track of these matters. After a quick scan, he reported, "There is one with the surname Wang who cultivates a compatible Qi for Floating Cloud Body; he is in the late stage of Qi Refining. There is also a Guest Elder Huang who cultivates the same art. We have no one with a compatible Qi for Hurricane Ghost Yin."

Li Ximing responded casually, "The Wang clan is a major lineage in Jiangbei, and Wang He still holds a position in the Capital immortals Dao... It's difficult to manage them in Secret Diffusion territory. Since this young man is already in the late stage of Qi Refining, we should support him. It would be best if he could achieve Foundation Establishment. This will also help stabilize the people who migrated from the Funan region."

As he gave the order, he had a premonition. 'It seems we won't be getting much from this spiritual trove. We'll have to treat this as a trial run. It's not a one-time opportunity, so we can plan more carefully once the younger generation rises.'

Li Chenghuai understood and bowed to take his leave. But then he saw the white-robed, gold-patterned Daoist Master close his eyes and exhale slowly.

"Chenghuai," Li Ximing said suddenly, "destiny, talent, and temperament are three things rarely found together. We often believe cultivation and cunning are paramount, but one must also worry... for when luck runs dry, the Purple Mansion is unattainable, and when fate is shallow, Divine Abilities remain a distant dream."

"This junior is enlightened," Li Chenghuai said, knowing his uncle was referring to Wenhu.

"Have the members of the Zhou generation come here," Li Ximing instructed. "And... invite the old patriarch as well."

***

**Mount Qingdu.**

These days, Mount Qingdu was bustling with newly constructed pavilions. Much of the forest had been cleared, transforming the once-secluded residence of a few Foundation Establishment cultivators and direct descendants into the busy peak of the Court of Justice. Streaks of light constantly rose and fell as figures hurried about their duties. Li Quewan's own light descended, landing softly on the mountainside.

The silver-white pendant around her neck gleamed faintly. She wore a thoughtful expression. Now at the seventh level of Qi Refining, she was considered a core member of the Li family. She had just returned from a fruitless trip to the northern Yue mountains, feeling slightly dejected.

'This Shamanic Talisman Dao is truly difficult...'

The *Shamanic Talisman Dao* was a shamanic art she had obtained from a Talisman Seed. To call it an art was an understatement; it was a comprehensive encyclopedia of shamanism, filled with an astonishing number of techniques focused on three paths: transformation, shamanic talismans, and soul manipulation. Yet, for all its complexity, the tome was organized into just three sprawling chapters, with no clear progression, as if it had been haphazardly bound together.

'It's an ancient cultivation method, I suppose. They valued simplicity...'

Li Quewan dedicated nearly all her energy outside of her primary cultivation to the *Shamanic Talisman Dao*, yet she had barely scratched the surface. On Li Jiangqian's advice, she focused on the transformation techniques for self-preservation, learning little else besides a few divination methods.

The opening line of the text was daunting enough: "Only when the profound is first achieved may one begin the study of shamanic arts." As she had discovered, "first achieving the profound" meant reaching the Purple Mansion Realm.

"In ancient times, you weren't even considered accomplished without a Divine Ability," she sighed. "How I envy them."

Pushing these thoughts aside, Li Quewan focused on her surroundings. She had only visited Mount Qingdu a handful of times, but she held the place in deep reverence.

The Court of Justice on Mount Qingdu had originally managed the mortal affairs of the direct lineage. As more descendants became cultivators and the mortal bloodlines dispersed into the branch families, its staff was expanded to oversee cultivators. Later, as intermarriage with outside families and guest elders grew more common, and the Jade Court began transferring its prisoners to Mount Qingdu for judgment, its authority swelled. The Jade Court still conducted investigations, but its jurisdiction for sentencing and punishment was now limited to the lower-level cultivators of the sixteen prefectures, two peaks, and one mountain. It had gradually become subordinate to Mount Qingdu.

When Li Chenghuai broke through to the Foundation Establishment realm and mastered the art of Untraceable Presence, he gained the ability to discern truth from falsehood among low-grade Qi Refining cultivators. While this had little impact on the family's upper echelons, it was a monumental event for the entire administrative system, helping to root out corruption. He even uncovered wrongdoing among three direct-lineage clan elders, who were subsequently sent to the island under house arrest. This cemented Mount Qingdu's paramount status.

Yet, at the height of its power, one of Mount Qingdu's side peaks remained lush with trees, without a single new pavilion. It was quiet and rarely visited. Li Quewan was respectful as she approached a middle-aged man at the door.

"Please inform the old patriarch," she said politely, "that the Daoist Master has requested his presence."

The man was her own brother. He nodded quickly and hurried inside. Moments later, an old man descended the stairs. His cheeks were sunken, making his face appear thin and gaunt, but it did not diminish his kind expression. His eyes, bright and black, were nestled in a web of smiling wrinkles. His mouth was slightly open, and seeing him made Li Quewan want to smile herself.

"Is the old patriarch in good health?" she asked softly.

"Fine, just fine!" Li Xuanxuan came forward quickly. Li Quewan reached out to support him, but he waved her hand away, looking around eagerly. "Ximing is back? Let's go, let's go! We'll head over right now!"

Today, Li Xuanxuan was likely the only person who dared to call Daoist Master Zhaojing by his given name. Li Quewan rose into the air with him.

"A few months ago... that He Jiumen died of old age," Li Xuanxuan lamented. "He used too much of his vital blood in artifact refinement and only lived to be one hundred and fifty. Such a pity... And his legacy, he couldn't pass it all on to Queyi and the others. The old man didn't even get to die satisfied!"

He Jiumen was an old cultivator from the west bank who had grown close to Li Xuanxuan in recent years. This was the first Li Quewan had heard of his passing. Before she could respond, Li Xuanxuan continued, "Donghe has been silent as a stone at the Jade Court all these years, and An Zheyan is away on a mission. Qiuyang, on the other hand, has let everything go to pilot a boat on the lake. I'm all alone on this mountain with no one to talk to. The few who do come to visit are just trying to use my influence. It's all so insincere..."

After Li Qinghong, Li Xuanxuan was the first elder Li Quewan had followed. Hearing his complaints, she felt a pang of guilt.

"An Zheyan only has a few years left," Li Xuanxuan said, his tone turning indignant, "and they sent him to the north! And after what happened to An Siewen... what's the meaning of this? I'm going to have a good talk with the Daoist Master about it."

In the middle of his words, they descended upon Gardenia Scenery Mountain. At the foot of the mountain, a man and a woman were waiting.

The man was handsome, dressed in pleated robes that shimmered with a golden light like wheat, branching into six streams that moved with the grace of sparrows. The woman was of plain appearance, without makeup, wearing a simple dress with a sword on her back.

"Uncle Zhouluo, Aunt Xinghan!" Li Quewan greeted them.

The two quickly bowed to Li Xuanxuan, their ancestor. He hurried to help them up, giving Li Xinghan a surprised look. "Zhouluo visits me often on Mount Qingdu, so I see him a lot. But Xinghan, I don't believe I've seen you much. Where are you cultivating these days?"

Li Xinghan cupped her hands. "Replying to the patriarch, Xinghan cultivates on the northern shore of Moongaze Lake. The cliffs there are steep and excellent for practicing swordsmanship."

Though her appearance was unremarkable, her voice was as crisp and clear as melting snow, quite captivating. Hearing the word "swordsmanship," Li Xuanxuan's eyes lit up. "Have you cultivated sword Qi?"

"Replying to the patriarch, I have."

As they approached the Daoist Master's residence, they lowered their voices. Li Xuanxuan didn't press them further. They reached the summit, where fallen gardenia petals blanketed the ground like a layer of white frost. A few broken jade pillars lay amidst the sea of flowers, with faint wisps of purple flame flickering between them.

The Daoist Master, dressed in white robes with gold patterns, was reading a jade slip. Seeing Li Xuanxuan, he immediately rose to welcome him, helping the old man to a seat and pouring him tea. Only then did the younger clan members dare to move, standing respectfully to the side.

Li Zhouluo glanced over and saw his father, Li Chenghuai, standing silently nearby. His heart began to pound. 'What is happening...?'

With the juniors present, Li Xuanxuan held his tongue, simply responding to Li Ximing's questions about his well-being. Finally, Li Chenghuai spoke. "Reporting to the Daoist Master, Zhoufang and Zhouyang of the First Branch are in the wilderness and have not yet returned."

Li Ximing nodded and turned his gaze to Li Zhouluo and Li Xinghan, a look of satisfaction on his face. His eyes lingered on the sword on Li Xinghan's back. "Our family was founded on the sword," he said, "but besides my two brothers, few in the younger generation have taken to it. It is good that you two, one cultivating Geng Metal and the other Jade True, both practice the way of the sword."

Li Zhouluo was the first in the family to cultivate the *Gleaming Gold Spirit-Searching Art*. Li Xinghan was a special case; she cultivated the Yu family's Dao lineage, the *Jade Dao Unity True Art*.

This technique had been recovered from the Yu family's secret vaults. Although it was ungraded, it was a rare and complete inheritance. However, almost no one in the Li family had cultivated it over the years due to the difficulty of gathering its unique Qi.

The *Jade Dao Unity True Art* required a cultivator to hold a jade plate and chant scriptures day in and day out to gather the initial strand of Qi. The process took five or six years—not an eternity, but far more demanding than the one or two hours a day other methods required. It was a significant delay in one's cultivation. Moreover, the Qi had to be gathered by the same person without interruption. The original scriptures had been scattered when the Yu family fell, making it even more challenging. Li Xinghan's father, though a direct descendant, was unremarkable in talent and ability and could never have acquired such a treasure for her.

But fortune and misfortune are intertwined. Because of his poor cultivation, her father was not qualified to participate in the great river battle. With only his status as a direct descendant, he had married a woman with ties to the Yu family. Li Xinghan's maternal uncle had once been a Yu family guest elder who knew the scriptures. Doting on his niece, he personally spent five years gathering the Qi for her.

Her mother's family's efforts had not been in vain. As Li Ximing looked at her, his eyes truly lit up.

A family's Dao lineages should be as diverse as possible to prevent them from being suppressed by a single type of magical artifact or spiritual aura. The family's direct lineage was lacking a Jade True cultivator. Li Ximing was pleased.

"Your immortal foundation has the intent of comprehension and unity, and you have appeared when the Jade True is prominent in the world," he said with a smile. "In ancient times, the Jade True Six-Nine Void True Monarch was also a sword immortal. When he attained Fruition... it's possible that this Jade True is an excellent lineage for sword practice, no worse than Geng Metal. Continue to train well."

Li Ximing needed to make no promises. For a Daoist Master of his stature to say these words in front of the clan's old patriarch and the Foundation Establishment head of Mount Qingdu was a clear sign that Li Xinghan had caught his eye. The young woman, though not one for complex thoughts, understood the weight of his words and immediately bowed low.

"Thank you, Daoist Master!"
