# Chapter 593: The Small Courtyard

Situ Chen's features were striking, with a high-bridged nose that bore a resemblance to Situ Mo. Black and red fire enveloped him, swirling with ominous qi.

His flames were unusual, taking on the shapes of various birds, their sheer power enough to shatter the bolts of lightning hurled at him. His dual blades moved with ferocity, slicing through the air with the force of a tiger's charge.

The surrounding cultivators hesitated at the sight. Neither Miao Ye nor Situ Chen was someone to trifle with. A confrontation between the two could only mean trouble, leaving little for others to gain. Gradually, the others dispersed, leaving the two locked in a standoff mid-air.

Situ Chen grew even more resolute. The Hidden Cloud Orb was critical to forging his artifact. He said coldly, "I have no desire to waste time with you here. Why not name a price? Let us negotiate‚Äî"

"Bah!" Miao Ye sneered, spitting as he interrupted, "Mother fucker! Do you think I have forgotten how that Flameshadow Crow you wield came to be? It was Situ Tang who stole my family's fortune on Mount Douxuan and seized the technique! Now you dare feign civility and speak of negotiation? I spit on you!"

Situ Chen's smile darkened as his expression grew cold. He retorted, "How dare you utter the Daoist Master's name directly! If your family lost its fortune, you have only yourselves to blame. Your accusations are baseless."

Miao Ye barked out a bitter laugh and said mockingly, "The old bastard is dead! I will curse him in front of your face‚Äîwhat can you do about it?"

The two exchanged sharp words before erupting into battle. Li Xuanfeng, clad in his black-gold spirit armor, dimmed its radiance and concealed himself within the clouds, silently observing the scene.

"So, it is you... The Flameshadow Crow... It really is the Flameshadow Crow." Memories from Li Xuanfeng's youth in Lijing Town resurfaced. A severe drought had struck Lichuankou Village, emptying nearly every household. The Xu Family had been devoured, leaving only old Xu alive, while Chen Erniu had fled to become a tenant farmer under the Li Family.

Old Xu had died in front of Li Xuanfeng all those years ago, revealing a dark secret: Golden Tang Gate had orchestrated a demonic ritual to prepare Flameshadow Crow Qi for the young master's cultivation, using monsters to kill humans and harvest fire energy.

"Flameshadow Crow Qi," Li Xuanfeng murmured.

These events had taken place far in the past. Harvesting spiritual qi from heaven and earth often required years or even decades. Golden Tang Gate must have collected fire qi from multiple locations, their activities unnoticed amid the passage of time.

Mortals, with their short lifespans, had little time to dwell on grief. Yet old Xu, clutching six-year-old Li Xuanfeng's trousers in his dying moments, had left a memory that stayed with him for over seventy years.

Li Xuanfeng adjusted his longbow, and a quiver of arrows trembled. One leaped from the quiver to rest on the bowstring. Streams of golden light rapidly gathered and coalesced into the arrowhead.

Standing silently, bow drawn, Li Xuanfeng held his position without firing. Instead, he slowly retreated into the clouds, keeping his presence hidden as he carefully memorized Situ Chen's features.

In this grotto heaven, they won't fight to the death. It's a petty skirmish over scraps, a case of losing the greater prize for smaller gains. This man, as the young master of Golden Tang Gate, is no easy target. If I act, it must be decisive‚Äîhe cannot be allowed to escape or prepare defenses.

Below him, the black-red flames around Situ Chen surged higher with every swing of his twin blades. His strikes hurled arcs of fire at Miao Ye, who stood firm with lightning crackling between his bronze bowls.

The two exchanged spells and techniques, testing each other through dozens of moves. Gradually, the battle intensified, sending shockwaves of flame and lightning scattering across the sky.

As the clash dragged on, both began to show hesitation. In the grotto heaven, prolonging their fight risked leaving them vulnerable to opportunists. Reluctantly, they reached a tacit understanding and stopped.

Situ Chen sheathed his blades and snorted coldly before flying off toward a distant mountain range. Miao Ye spat in his direction before turning and heading the opposite way.

Once the two separated, Li Xuanfeng concealed his spirit armor and silently followed after Situ Chen, heading north through the clouds.

As he moved through the mist, streaks of light grew increasingly common around him. Bright trails cut through the gray haze unabashedly, while dimmer and more subtle glimmers revealed the presence of at least a dozen other cultivators.

The distribution within this cloud sea is unclear, but by rough estimation, there must be forty or fifty people here. Of them, at least ten carry threads of fate. If a fight breaks out, it will be quite the spectacle. After glancing around briefly, Li Xuanfeng pressed on.

Before long, the mountain range began to emerge. Its deep brown base rose sharply from the clouds, towering toward the heavens. The slopes were covered in various types of spirit pines, their luminous needles reflecting a faint glow.
ùó≥ùê´ùöéùó≤ùö†ùöéùóØùïüùê®ùòÉùöéùóπ.ùó∞ùóºùó∫

A cyan wind whistled through the forest, scattering and drawing the clouds in rhythmic waves, creating the illusion of an island floating within a sea.

Amid the vast pine forest, emerald-green stone steps wound upward like the body of a great azure serpent dragon. The steps extended from the mountain's foot to its summit, flanked by pavilions and terraces exuding an ethereal, celestial aura.

As Li Xuanfeng approached the mountain, the wind surrounding him abruptly dispersed, forcing him to falter mid-air. Stumbling slightly, he landed at the mountain's foot.

Taking a moment to identify the phenomenon, he realized the wind was Heavy Abyssal Gale, a rare spiritual force capable of scattering flight techniques, disrupting spirit boats, stirring sandstorms, and interfering with magical artifacts. It was a highly coveted spirit material, even among Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

Such a wind was exceptionally scarce in the present world, found only in trace amounts on the Great Western Plains. Even a wisp of it could be used to forge artifacts capable of disarming opponents. Released into the wild, it would cause rogue cultivators to fight fiercely over it.

Yet here, the gale seemed endless, circling the mountain endlessly. None of the cultivators knocked from the skies paused to gather it; instead, they hurried toward the summit.

Li Xuanfeng descended to the ground and noticed a black-robed man landing ahead of him. The man had coarse, shallow eyebrows and gaunt cheeks. Cupping his fist, he said, "I saw Daoist Xuanfeng from the skies earlier. The mountain is dangerous‚Äîwhy not travel together?"

The man was Lin Chensheng of the Great Xiukui Temple, who had warned him earlier. Li Xuanfeng had a good impression of him and raised an eyebrow before nodding lightly, "Very well."

The two began moving, stepping onto the stone pathway and advancing quickly while activating their footwork techniques. Ignoring the spirit pines lining the path, they headed toward the nearest pavilion.

The pavilion was no larger than a small courtyard of a commoner's home. Two stone lions stood at its entrance. As Li Xuanfeng looked closer, he realized someone had already arrived.

A female cultivator in a red robe stood at the courtyard gate, intently examining the pavilion. She held a small halberd in her arms, no longer than her forearm. The weapon, colored in shades of red and yellow, had three prongs at the tip that curved together like petals. It resembled a ceremonial artifact more than a weapon.

As soon as Li Xuanfeng and Lin Chensheng stopped, the woman turned to glance at them warily. In a soft voice, she said, "Daoists, I arrived here first. Please look elsewhere."

Her gaze swept over Li Xuanfeng and froze when it landed on Lin Chensheng. Her eyes curved into a delighted expression as she exclaimed, "Brother Chensheng!"

Lin Chensheng was also somewhat surprised and responded, "So it is Daoist Yuzhuang..."

He gave a sincere smile and introduced her to Li Xuanfeng, "This is Daoist Bi Yuzhuang of the Hengzhu Dao Gate, a close friend of mine since childhood."

Turning to Bi Yuzhuang, Lin Chensheng smiled and said, "This is Li Xuanfeng, a capable and trusted aide of Daoist Master Yuan Su."

Bi Yuzhuang's attitude shifted noticeably as she responded with a smile, "I was just troubled over how to break this formation. I was at a loss for what to do. Your arrival is timely‚Äîwhy not work together to resolve it? That way, we can save time and avoid unnecessary entanglements."

Lin Chensheng scratched his head awkwardly and cupped his fist, "You know I have never been skilled with formations, and Daoist Xuanfeng is not either... If Kan Ziyu were here, perhaps we could give it a try."

Bi Yuzhuang pondered for a moment before replying, "I have been studying this formation for some time. It is quite peculiar and carries an ancient flavor. It does not follow the six-segment structure nor the nine-pattern layout. Over the centuries, as the world changed and fruition attainments shifted, its original might has greatly diminished."

She flipped her hand and retrieved several jade wedges from her storage pouch. Each wedge was attached to a few fine, elongated chains. She lightly tossed them, and the chains' ends gathered back into her hand as the jade wedges danced nimbly over the formation.

Explaining as she worked, Bi Yuzhuang said, "This formation was likely established over a thousand years ago, during a time when the Pristine Waters had yet to recede, and both Bright Yang and Veiled Yin were still present. It is even possible that the Supreme Yang and Supreme Yin still existed in the world. Hence, the formation relied on a Yin-Yang stabilization method for its core, making it exceptionally durable."

Bi Yuzhuang continued, "The world today has changed far too much. Modern cultivators favor using the Five Virtues and Three Metals as the foundation for formations, almost entirely abandoning Yin-Yang methods. While the grotto heaven has mitigated the effects of these changes, flaws have inevitably appeared."

With a gentle tug on the chains, Bi Yuzhuang revealed a series of glowing nodes across the formation. She pointed to a few of them and said softly, "If the two of you follow the guidance of my spiritual sense and strike at these weaknesses, the formation will break."

Lin Chensheng flipped his wrist and brought out a talisman. The talisman was pitch-black and shimmered faintly with multicolored light. He held it in his hand for a moment, then formed a seal and activated it, slamming it down with a loud bang.

Clearly holding back, Lin Chensheng refrained from using his full strength. The formation flickered briefly under the impact but quickly regained its brightness.

Li Xuanfeng raised his bow, but instead of nocking an arrow, he condensed a long streak of golden light and loosed it at the formation. He, too, held back his power, causing the formation to shake violently.

The formation, clearly not meticulously crafted and more akin to a casual protective barrier, was already riddled with flaws. Under the combined effort of the three, it shattered into pieces. The two stone beasts flanking the gate dimmed and lost their vitality.

The three ceased their attacks, and Bi Yuzhuang retrieved a resplendent white orb from her storage pouch, tossing it gently.

The artifact landed and immediately transformed into a white-armored warrior. Though its cultivation was only at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, it stood tall and dignified, its features symmetrical and calm. Without a word, it began marching toward the courtyard.

This reminds me of Yuan Tuan's Azure Crest Manifestation, Li Xuanfeng thought to himself.

He watched as the white-armored warrior pushed open the courtyard gate and boldly stepped inside. In the center of the courtyard lay a collapsed pile of rubble.

The rubble was still intact enough to make out the form of a stone beast that once stood there.

The creature was neither wolf nor tiger, and its shattered head on the ground bore three eyes and sharp fangs, giving it a ferocious appearance. Its third eye had a gemstone embedded in it, though its nature was unclear.

Li Xuanfeng found the stone beast oddly familiar. After a moment's thought, he suddenly realized why: Daoist Master Yuan Su had a similar stone sculpture in front of his gates.

Sure enough, both Lin Chensheng and Bi Yuzhuang turned their gazes toward him. Lin Chensheng said softly, "A Three-Eyed Mount Tiao Beast. This beast was used in ancient times to guard formations and attract wealth. They were once fairly common, but the last known sighting was... Ah!"

Li Xuanfeng recalled that Yuan Su once owned a living spirit beast of this type, which had been killed by Situ Tang of the Golden Tang Gate. He asked, "And this gemstone‚Äîwhat is it?"
ùìØùôßùôöùíÜùô¨ùôöùíÉùô£ùô§ùíóùìÆùìµ.ùôòùô§ùô¢

Neither Lin Chensheng nor Bi Yuzhuang could identify it, so Li Xuanfeng used his mana to retrieve it and said softly, "This item is connected to the spirit beast. I will return it to the Daoist Master. Allow me to take it for now."

The two nodded, watching as the white-armored warrior ransacked the pavilion and its side rooms, casually gathering an assortment of items and laying them out at the gate.

Among the loot were several dozen ancient texts, over ten jade bottles, and miscellaneous objects like jade pillows and mats. It seemed the courtyard's owner never anticipated intruders within the grotto heaven and had left without packing anything.

Without wasting time, Lin Chensheng took the ancient texts and distributed them among the group according to customary practice, ensuring everyone could read through them.

Li Xuanfeng examined the texts closely. Thirteen of them covered formations, seven were cultivation manuals, and the remaining dozen or so were biographies, tales, and bestiaries, most revolving around sea dragons and related aquatic species.

Bi Yuzhuang skimmed the formation manuals and sighed, "What a pity... such intricate formations... but with the changes in the world, most are no longer relevant."

Li Xuanfeng focused on the cultivation manuals. Three of them pertained to Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques, including two Grade four manuals, Six Chapters Seeking Immortality and Scaled Beasts Inquiry Technique, and one Grade Five manual titled Insights of Taihua.

These ancient cultivators were certainly straightforward with their naming conventions‚Äîpractical and unadorned, Li Xuanfeng thought.

Among the three, Scaled Beasts Inquiry Technique focused on cultivating the six chakras of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, but the technique required transitioning exclusively to water-attributed methods afterward, which made it somewhat restrictive. The others were more flexible. However, Six Chapters Seeking Immortality included a specific note at the end, stating it could not be followed by Ancient Merging techniques.

What are these Ancient Merging Techniques? I've never heard of them before... and where would anyone find them now? Li Xuanfeng mulled over these for a while.

The three Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques were of no use to Li Xuanfeng personally, but they would be invaluable for the younger generation of his family. While he wasn't sure what techniques his relatives practiced beyond the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra, he was certain none of them had access to anything as high as Grade Five techniques.

These days, only in a grotto heaven can such high-grade techniques be found! Li Xuanfeng pondered in awe.

After memorizing the three manuals, he turned to the remaining four texts. Three were Qi Cultivation Realm techniques, incomplete and seemingly excerpts the pavilion's owner had used to make a selection. The last, however, was a complete manual that reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, suggesting it had ultimately been the owner's chosen path.

It seems the owner of this courtyard settled on this one in the end. It was easy for Li Xuanfeng to reach this conclusion.

Qi Cultivation Realm techniques were of little interest to him, so Li Xuanfeng skimmed over them. However, he carefully examined the Foundation Establishment Realm manual. The ancient book had a unique texture‚Äîfirm, durable, and unlike anything common. The title, written in bold, clean characters, read, "Taiyue Northern Dawn Manual".

Intrigued, Li Xuanfeng opened the first page, preparing to study it in detail.
