# Chapter 1194: The Three Schemes

The clouds roiled and the sky grew heavy, casting the land for ten thousand miles in pitch-black darkness. Yet, a single talisman of shimmering gold light hung suspended above the mountain gate, shining with the brilliance of the sun and bathing everything in radiance.

At the entrance to a cave dwelling on the mountain's peak, layers of purple mist coiled around white stone steps. A woman stood to the side, her features elegant and refined, her body awash in a surge of golden energy. It was none other than Zhang Duanyan, a Daoist Master of the Golden Feather Sect.

Daoist Master Qiushui herself had promoted this junior, who had since gradually entered the core of the immortal sect. Though she typically handled its myriad affairs, in these troubled times, she had returned to this lofty cave dwelling to wait in silence.

As the doors to the inner cave swung slowly open, a scorching, violent aura poured from the gap, forcing the purple mist to retreat. A well-built man emerged from the shadowed interior, his bare torso covered in a dense network of vermilion runes that pulsed with an otherworldly light.

"Greetings, Old Ancestor!"

Zhang Duanyan's eyes filled with delight. She bowed naturally and offered her congratulations.

"This junior congratulates the Old Ancestor on transcending the Purple Mystery! Your divine ability is complete, and the Five Methods are now within reach!"

The man slowly opened his eyes. The roiling True Fire throughout the grotto instantly converged on his body, the crimson condensing to its absolute limit until it manifested a hint of purple. After a long moment, his hoarse voice finally sounded.

"It is merely True Fire. Not worth mentioning."

This man was Daoist Master Tianque of the Golden Feather Sect!

He had been stagnant at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm for many years. Now that he had broken through, he showed not a hint of triumph. The junior at his side kept her lips sealed, while Tianque familiarized himself with the divine ability seething within him.

"I have contended with Hengli for so many years," he said faintly. "I've fallen far too far behind him with this step. Besides, this is a dead-end path with nothing to celebrate. Even on such a narrow road, isn't there still Gao Fu in the north? I am vastly inferior."

Zhang Duanyan seemed to disagree.

"If the Old Ancestor had been willing, you would not have delayed this step until today," she said in a low voice. "You were merely waiting to understand the greater situation and make additional preparations…"

Tianque pulled a Daoist robe over his shoulders, suppressing the flames that rose from his body.

"Isn't Hengli the same?" he said casually. "His 'Calamity Measure' art is said to require a great disaster to succeed, but everyone knows who's holding that back. The decline of the Supreme Yang is a great boon for cultivation. Back then, Yanque said he had the heart of a child, and Hengxing, fearing he would develop an inner demon, even made him wade into the murky waters of Luoxia."

Zhang Duanyan said, "If the Old Ancestor had cultivated a conventional Dao Lineage…"

Tianque shook his head.

"Back then, the monarch of the Zhuluo Kingdom had a truly magnificent presence, repeatedly drawing observers from the Feather-Shedding Land. Since I left the grotto-heaven to cultivate, I naturally had to seize the opportunity to fill the True Fire position... to seek its restoration and then some. A pity... in the end, it was Zixuan who shattered the True Fire. He is but a junior and was unequal to the task."

"'The turning of the heavens is not for me to decide.' What could I do?"

Evidently, that Zhuluo monarch had won the favor of the master of the Tree of One Heart. According to True Monarch Taiyuan's calculations, it was only natural to plant a hidden pawn to pursue the True Fire. But what was a casual move for the True Monarch had been a dead end for Tianque, sealing off his proper path.

Zhang Duanyan could only sigh.

"Now... since the Old Ancestor has perfected four True Fires, will the final one... be the 'Radiant Fire'?"

Tianque ambled out of the cave dwelling and took a seat at the stone table.

"I'm not cultivating it. Many seek severance through True Fire, but few succeed. I had someone make a special inquiry."

His words immediately made the Daoist Master's eyes light up. For Tianque to inquire about his path, he wouldn't have asked just anyone—it must have been their own True Monarch!

As she expected, Tianque spoke softly, "The True Monarch said the transformation of True Severance is that 'weak yin cannot harmonize with ascendant yang; a waning fire cannot lack a true sovereign.' I only vaguely grasp the principle, but this path is closed to me, and the others are just as difficult. Better to set my ambitions aside and cultivate the borrowed 'Pheasant Li March'."

A look of relief washed over his face.

"If it can be done, it will be done. If not, so be it…"

The words were an unmistakably terrible sign. Zhang Duanyan's face fell, her lips trembling as she whispered,

"How can there be no path forward…?"

Tianque laughed.

"Nothing in this world is perfect. The True Monarch has been planning for years, and now our path has three arrangements for the Golden Core, each one world-shaking. If even one succeeds, it will greatly alleviate our sect's plight. Should I be greedy for more? It is better that I become a Great Daoist Master, quickly perfect my divine abilities, and lend my strength to aid these three schemes."

He was well aware of how low his chances were of attaining the 'True Fire' Dao-fruit, but he paid it no mind. He rose to his feet.

"I've had this plan for a long time—or rather, the arrangement was made in the grotto-heaven long ago, and I have only just now understood. The matter with He Ting was all in preparation for today!"

Zhang Duanyan froze for a moment before it dawned on her.

"He Ting? The Nine Gates Temple?"

"Years ago," Tianque said quietly, "the grotto-heaven bestowed a certain technique that required a place devoid of karmic ties for its refinement. Where else could such a place be but Moongaze Lake!"

"The great one took a fancy to the marvelous power of the Azure Insight Origin Mirror and specifically tasked me with finding someone to forge the Spiritual Artifact on the lake. Thus, He Jiumen came to be. I went to great pains to acquire a certain pill and, under the pretext of refining a spirit embryo, had him occupy the western shore. He consumed the pill and toiled for a century on the lake before the artifact's embryo finally took shape!"

"Now, the Nine Gates Temple has merged with the Calendar Heart Sand, allowing it to perceive and erase karmic threads. Carrying this artifact into the world is for one purpose: to intervene in the matter of the World's Revolution at the critical moment and lend him a helping hand!"

Zhang Duanyan mulled this over for a long time before saying, stunned,

"So that was the reason."

Tianque ignored the surprise on his junior's face and turned, but he didn't see the familiar figure he expected.

"Where is Tianhuo?"

Zhang Duanyan quickly bowed.

"The sword has been forged. Unfortunately, it was tampered with slightly, causing some... changes. His Highness gathered a great deal of information, formed some conjectures, and went to the grotto-heaven to report to the great one."

"His father's situation is the most conspicuous," Tianque said with approval, "but that does not mean we will allow them to plot against us as they please."

After a moment of thought, Zhang Duanyan retrieved a golden scroll from her sleeve. Her expression grew serious.

"The Li family's 'Whole Pill' is a success!" she said in a low voice.

The moment she spoke, Tianque set his cup down on the table. He rose and paced with his hands behind his back, quickly extending a hand to calculate the year. Seeing his reaction, Zhang Duanyan couldn't help but hesitate.

"The news hasn't spread yet. Li Ximing sent a trusted Daoist Master to deliver the message to me in secret. That person has a respectable background and was very cautious—he came politely and left in a hurry... With no one in a position of authority in the sect lately, I haven't yet given a response."

While she spoke, Tianque had already unfurled the golden scroll. Inside were some pleasantries, the woman's date of birth, an outline of her cultivation method, and a final addendum: a question about that very method.

Tianque's expression remained calm. He silently rolled up the scroll and held it in his hand.

"What a genius... Her breakthrough speed is nearly on par with King Wei's... and she cultivates the Golden Book of Divine Attendance!"

Although Zhang Duanyan was somewhat acquainted with the Li family, she didn't dare say a word on this matter. She hesitated, observing his expression, before venturing,

"Based on the traditions of the Immortal Mansion, it seems unlikely they would possess the Golden Book of Divine Attendance…"

Tianque was clearly thinking of something else.

"That's not strange," he said offhandedly. "There is a copy in Anhuai Heaven. Tianhuo even considered going in to look for it back then, but Chi Buzi burned the book, earning him a vicious curse. Thinking back, it's not so surprising. It must have been Chi Buzi who took the Golden Book of Divine Attendance..."

He paced with his hands behind his back, pondering for a long time.

"But this business with the Li family isn't new. Li Que'wan is far too young, born too late, so the outcry in the grotto-heaven won't be too loud. Still, according to our past arrangements, even a small risk like this cannot be taken. Wasn't it the same with the Xinggong Terrace back then?"

"He understands our family's methods. The Fruition Attainment cannot be compromised, and bowing his head won't solve anything. By asking about the technique... he's likely probing our attitude, seeing if we intend to sever her path."

The newly ascended Great Daoist Master spoke softly, "It's an appropriate response. If an ordinary family produced such a genius, even if we spared her because of this deferential scroll, we would still give her a technique from the Three Shamans and Two Rites to ensure she cultivates a divine ability and severs her path to the Dao-fruit for good…"

"But the Li family is different. It's not just about those Immortal Mansion remnants clinging to life. More importantly... there's King Wei."

A trace of resignation surfaced on Tianque's face.

"Our family has been tied to him for many years; we can't be fickle now. He may be little more than a tool with a glorious facade, but I must admit, he is one of the few people in this world with the capital to be truly willful. We don't need his help, but if he were to turn on us, it would be an absolute headache."

"With him in the picture, we have no choice but to swallow our pride and accept it... Look at it another way: with Bright Yang gone, if by some chance she manages to secure an Auxiliary Position, she'll have no one to rely on. In the end, she'll have to seek shelter with us…"

The matter of the Li family had been explicitly discussed in the grotto-heaven. Tianque could only sigh at the thought. Shaking his head, he said,

"In that case, let's make a proper trade with him. Fulfill the obligation…"

Zhang Duanyan lowered her voice.

"The Old Ancestor means... a golden book?"

Tianque nodded.

"The golden books are a very particular matter. There are two for each of the Prime Virtues, making ten in total. The remaining four are 'Whole Pill' books, for a total of fourteen sequences… This is the Dao Lineage of the Left-Hand Path Immortal, Su Jing. He taught more than one True Monarch, and though he was not the originator of the 'Whole Pill Prime Virtue Theory,' he was the one who made the Prime Virtue teachings famous. They were even subtly absorbed by the lofty cultivators of the Three Profoundities, and it is partly to his credit that they are so widespread today…"

"They already have the Golden Book of Divine Attendance. The remaining ones are 'Questioning the Prime,' 'White Nurturing,' and 'Listening to Explication.' Since we're doing them a favor, we might as well take out 'White Nurturing' to trade…"

Hearing this, Zhang Duanyan's eyes lit up.

"Excellent... I'll go make the arrangements. That golden book is the one that best represents our Zhang family. It's the perfect opportunity to show them the experience and power of our True Monarch, lest they get any other ideas…"

"Whether they get ideas is not for them to decide."

Tianque shook his head, his interest flagging. His expression turned serious again.

"Even if it is a favor, there's no reason to give it away for free. We must ask for something beneficial in return. There is an item in their possession that I have coveted for years. Since you're going anyway, you will trade for it and bring it back to me."

Zhang Duanyan nodded in understanding. She bowed and was about to withdraw when the mountain's protective formations trembled slightly, sending ripples of sensation through the cave. She raised an eyebrow in confusion, then pinched her fingers together in a quick calculation. A look of understanding crossed her face.

"Guest Retainer Qi has arrived."

Tianque had just picked up a jade slip to read, but the name she spoke caught his attention. He let out a cold laugh.

"He knows what's good for him. You go on. I'll deal with him."

The woman descended gracefully. Before long, a middle-aged layman appeared on the mountain path. He had a somewhat square face and simple clothing, but his eyes held a profound wisdom. Were it not for his slightly pale complexion, he would have had the very air of an immortal.

Had Li Ximing been present, he would have been stunned to recognize the man's identity—it was Sumian!

This Earth Virtue cultivator from Jianghuai had abandoned his own Xuanmiao Temple, vanishing without a trace. He had allowed Qi Lanyan and the others to throw Jianghuai into chaos, letting his own disciples be ordered about like ants, yet here he was, arriving leisurely at the Golden Feather Sect as a guest!

Their host, Tianque, was not the least bit surprised. He stood silently before the cave, waiting for the old Daoist Master to ascend. Sumian approached with a beaming smile and bowed, but as he got a clear look at the divine power radiating from Tianque's body, he froze in shock.

"Fellow Daoist... you've actually... Excellent! Truly excellent! My congratulations, Fellow Daoist!"

Tianque watched him with cold eyes, not a trace of a smile on his face.

"Fellow Daoist Qi," he said flatly, "there is no need for false pretenses. You and I left the grotto-heaven together and have been apart for many years, but this Daoist Master still knows what you're made of. With Jianghuai in turmoil and you having vanished, I was terribly worried."

His words were dripping with sarcasm, but Sumian paid it no mind.

"Was Fellow Daoist truly worried about me?" he chuckled. "Or about the treasure you entrusted me to refine?"

Tianque had a violent temper to begin with and was already displeased with the man before him. How could he tolerate such a retort? His eyes flared with a shimmering purple light as he stared daggers at the old Daoist Master.

"You took my family's property and fled to the sea in one go. Those who knew would assume you were refining a treasure for our cause. Those who didn't would think you'd gotten other ideas…"

Sumian showed no outward emotion, but the hand behind his back clenched slightly.

"Isn't Qiuxin already in your esteemed clan's grotto-heaven?" he said with a smile. "This old man is counting on your clan to produce another Daoist Master for my Qi family. What else is there for you to worry about, Fellow Daoist?"

Tianque's expression remained unchanged. He said coldly,

"The Qi Stone Demonic Fetus is a thing that allows one to reincarnate and cultivate anew. You, Fellow Daoist Qi, are old. To disappear for so many years without sending so much as a single letter to my immortal mountain—did you not harbor other intentions?"

The man lifted his chin, a sneer spreading across his features.

"Qi Qiuxin? A mere junior? What does he count for when compared to reincarnation and several hundred years of freedom? The only reason you've returned to the Golden Feather Sect, the only reason you've come before me, is because you fear we will hold you accountable!"
