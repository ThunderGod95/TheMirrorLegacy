# Chapter 1077: A Change of Post

The night was grim, the dark waves churning below. A silver light shot through the air, only to halt mid-flight and pause for a moment.

The light resolved into a middle-aged man dressed in elegant, expensive-looking fur robes. Three points of silver light dotted his brow. His hands formed a technique-seal as he casually glanced around.

Liu Changdie had been living more comfortably these days. The Xu Water Demon King, sent by the Dragon-kin, had explained their various plans. Although he still didn't dare set foot on the mainland, he could at least move about the Eastern Sea under the Dragon-kin's protection, enjoying a measure of freedom.

But this wasn't what weighed on Liu Changdie's mind. His hesitation stemmed from Fuxun.

After Li Ximing's warning, Liu Changdie no longer dared to seek out Fuxun casually. In all this time, today was the only visit he had made.

Fuxun's position was, after all, arranged. With no one to restrain him, he lived freely enough, and the Demon beasts under his command were gradually making a name for themselves in the sea. But the wounds on Fuxun's body had taken a strange turn.

Superficially, the injuries had healed, but the insidious damage lingered deep in his marrow, a plague clinging to his bones that he couldn't shake. Fuxun was in misery, constantly begging him to find a cultivator from the Lesser Yang Daoist Tradition to help heal him, which left Liu Changdie speechless.

'In my current situation, I can't even leave the Eastern Sea. Where am I supposed to find him a Lesser Yang cultivator? And I can't trouble Ximing with this...'

He could only set the worry aside for now. He drifted down toward the island, lost in thought, and soon spotted the great isle in the distance.

This island was truly strange. From afar, it appeared flat and vast, with no great peaks piercing the sky. Instead, low hills rolled on endlessly, the terrain sinking lower toward the center, all of it shrouded in a pale gray spiritual mist.

This was, in fact, the world-renowned World's Navel.

He didn't proceed, however. He changed direction and headed for the immortal mountain beneath his feet.

Liu Changdie actually knew a few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the Eastern Sea. He had once roamed the World's Navel and formed some connections with the Daoist Tradition there. After achieving the Purple Mansion Realm, he had returned to renew those ties.

He had come again today, first, for some personal matters, and second... because of the Xu Water Demon King's earlier guidance:

'In the eyes of the Profound Maiden, the Qunyi Archipelago cannot simply watch as one favored by the Heaven–Governing falls...'

Those were the Xu Water Demon King's exact words!

Liu Changdie's Dao-Profundity wasn't high among those in the Purple Mansion Realm, but his knowledge was first-rate. How could he not know of the 'Heaven–Governing'?

'The Heaven–Governing is the Encompassing Profoundity. It offers pills to heaven and earth, evolves divine abilitys, calculates the profound order, and observes all eight directions...'

Liu Changdie knew this "favor" must be related to his rebirth. He had survived to this day only on account of the Valley Water Matriarch... which meant he had no choice but to come and build this connection.

He rode his cloud down, soon stopping at the profound mountain on the island's edge. He had a disciple announce him, and immediately, a swath of grayish color emerged, resolving into a person.

The man appeared frail, treading lightly on a cloud. His face was paper-white, but his lips were a vibrant, moist red. His pitch-black eyes stared at him.

"Daoist Friend Liu!"

Liu Changdie replied, "Senior Cang Tiaozi, it has been a long time!"

The Daoist Master gave a light nod and led him inside, asking a few concerned questions about his recent situation. Liu Changdie, however, couldn't detect any special treatment. Once they were seated at the table, Cang Tiaozi stated flatly:

"Daoist Friend Liu, have you come to discuss a matter of importance?"

Liu Changdie knew that this 'Cang Tiaozi' before him was merely a skin-bag cast off by a Valley Water divine ability. That it could walk and talk was already incredible; he couldn't expect it to make specific expressions. He began by inquiring about the recent happenings in the Eastern Sea.

'This is a difficult subject to broach. I'll test him first, then ask about the Valley Water Matriarch.'

Liu Changdie was just trying to start a conversation, but he seemed to have landed right on Cang Tiaozi's worries. The man shook his head.

"It seems you've heard as well... Many Demon beasts have fallen in the depths of the Vermillion Sea. A great Water Mansion Demon King, who had been in seclusion for years, reappeared. Who knows how many rounds they fought, but many Demon lairs were shattered. Those Purple Mansion Realm Demon beasts' divine abilitys were no match for him, so they had to lie low and flee to other seas..."

"This would normally just be a curiosity, but the depths of the Vermillion Sea are unusual. The corpse of the 'Eighth Prince' is suppressed there, making it an extremely sensitive location. That's why this affair has blown up and drawn so much attention."

The name Vermillion Sea (Zhu Lu) didn't just refer to the water's color. The _'Zhu Lu'_ was actually a homophone for 'Execution', referencing the fall of that Eighth Prince. Liu Changdie naturally knew this. But the two places were extremely far apart; it shouldn't have concerned this Daoist Master so much. Upon asking, he saw a pained look cross Cang Tiaozi's face.

"I was refining a Pristine Water treasure there. Now I can't get it back. I have no idea who took it. Someone else gets to profit for nothing."

Liu Changdie never left the Eastern Sea, not even its borders, so he had no interest in this. He smiled.

"Daoist Friend, you are an expert in the Valley Water Dao, with a lineage from the Valley Water Matriarch. You research Pristine Water as well?"

Cang Tiaozi's gaze flickered slightly.

He smiled, "The Valley Water has an affinity for all waters. It's perfectly natural."

Liu Changdie sensed the other's guardedness. He had asked about the Valley Water Matriarch several times, but the man just smiled and brushed him off. He had no choice but to get to the point.

"I sent a man some days ago. Is there any news on the Guanyuan Profound Light?"

At this, the Daoist Master shook his head repeatedly.

"The Gathering Wood Dao is obscure these days. That thing is incredibly hard to find. Of all the items you asked about... there is news on only one. It's a Whole Pill spiritual item."

Joy sparked in Liu Changdie.

"Truly?!"

The reason Liu Changdie had asked this Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the World's Navel was because this place was ancient and held many spiritual items. Furthermore, the Valley Water's healing abilities were second to none. Cang Tiaozi often received favors from others, making it highly likely he would have such things!

When he sent his man, he had not only asked about the spiritual items _he_ lacked and the Vault Metal Dao, but as a precaution, he had also inquired about Whole Pill Dao items—this, naturally, was for Li Que'wan.

Li Ximing had asked him about a spiritual item for Li Que'wan before. Liu Changdie didn't have one himself, but he had sighed in astonishment at the request:

'That's the Six-Aspect Ceremonial Hue! It ranks in the top three of all Whole Pill spiritual items. It might be the only one in all of Wanling Heaven!'

Naturally, he was overjoyed.

'The items I needed for myself are too rare. I've been searching for years without success, so it's normal he doesn't have them. But getting news about a Whole Pill item is just as worthy of celebration!'

Hearing this, Cang Tiaozi smiled.

"Why would I lie? The Golden Feather Sect has snatched up most of the Whole Pill spiritual items. You can't find them in normal places anymore. However, there is a Dao Lineage in the Western Sea that also cultivates the Whole Pill path."

"They used to have a Great Daoist Master of the Whole Pill Dao, but she perished abruptly some years ago. Her disciples fell on hard times and have now sought me out, looking to trade it for Valley Water healing."

Liu Changdie understood immediately, though he felt a pang of disappointment.

"I see... I had considered the Western Sea, but certain things happened, making it inconvenient to contact anyone there... To think it would lead back to the Western Sea after all. What is the item?"

Cang Tiaozi opened his palm, revealing a speck of crimson sand that tumbled and leaped restlessly.

"The Vermillion Temple Golden Sand!"

Liu Changdie wasn't surprised. A flicker of recognition crossed his face as he sighed,

"Just as I thought! It's from the Xinggong Terrace, isn't it?"

Cang Tiaozi shook his head.

"It's enough that you know. No need to say more."

The Xinggong Terrace Liu Changdie mentioned had once been a great sect in the Western Sea. It had seen a glorious era; its Great Daoist Master, Miaoqi, had advanced step by step, crossing into the Purple Mystery in her later years to become one of the world's foremost figures.

Unfortunately, turmoil rocked the Western Sea. Great Daoist Master Miaoqi fell suddenly. Another Dao Lineage, the West Mansion Grotto Sect, rose to prominence and, in a great battle, shattered the Xinggong Terrace's spine, sending it into an irreversible decline... This Vermillion Temple Golden Sand was one of the most potent spiritual items held by the Daoist Masters of the Xinggong Terrace!

Liu Changdie had roamed the world, leaving tracks even in the Western Sea, and had known figures from the Xinggong Terrace. He thus felt a certain melancholy. Cang Tiaozi, far more detached, smiled.

"This item lies between the paths of Plainness and Metal. It excels at transforming into a boundless rain of Cinnabar treasure. If you refine it into a dharma artifact or a technique, the benefits will be beyond imagination. It's even better than spiritual water or fire!"

Spiritual water and fire already held value far beyond ordinary items. By using them as a comparison, Cang Tiaozi was stressing the item's worth. Liu Changdie quickly took a jade box from his sleeve and showed its contents to the Daoist Master, but Cang Tiaozi just shook his head.

"I am only interested in the One-Qi White Globe Stone!"

This put Liu Changdie in a bind. The One-Qi White Globe Stone he possessed was meant to be traded for the Guanyuan Profound Light. How could he use it now?

'But if I don't use the One-Qi White Globe Stone, he's barely interested in my other items. I'd have to add much, much more to make the trade...'

He hesitated, opening his mouth and closing it, unable to speak. Even if he treated the Li family as his own, this was an extremely precious item, the culmination of his savings. He couldn't make such a decision in an instant. After a moment, he said,

"Please, Senior, hold onto this item for me. I must go and raise the funds... or ask around. I will find items of equivalent value to exchange for it."

Cang Tiaozi naturally agreed and saw him out of the mountain. Liu Changdie grabbed his hand, pleading repeatedly,

"This junior knows Whole Pill spiritual items are scarce, and many Dao Lineages are searching for them... but this item is of the utmost importance to me. Please, hold it for me. I will return to trade for it soon!"

In the mountains, summer leaves fell, and autumn's gold returned. Inside a deep cave-mansion, two jade boxes sat on a stone table, gleaming under a ray of Bright Yang light. The Daoist Master seated within slowly exhaled and opened his eyes.

He stood and shook out his sleeves. His injuries were more than halfway healed, and his aura showed no visible fluctuations. This was clearly not what Li Ximing had expected. He pinched his fingers to calculate and was slightly stunned.

'More than a year has passed since I sent my message to Yang Ruiyi...'

Li Ximing was a little disappointed, guessing that Situ Huo had already taken control of Jiangbei and that his own escape was now a problem. But he had been prepared for this, so he didn't show his dismay.

'I'll have to find another chance...'

The jade stone in his sleeve buzzed incessantly. Li Ximing quickly strode out of the cave-mansion. Sure enough, Daoist Master Cheng Qian was standing outside, pacing back and forth. He smiled upon seeing him. His first words were,

"Congratulations, Daoist Friend!"

Li Ximing paused.

"What is there to congratulate?"

Daoist Master Cheng Qian gestured for him to come out, bowing his head with a smile as he explained,

"News has come from the mountain. It’s about a change in our garrison posting!"

He unfurled the golden scroll in his hand and passed it to Li Ximing. A few dozen words were written clearly on it. The gist was... Daoist Master Xianyao and Sima Yuanli were to come to Caishan. Li Ximing and Daoist Master Cheng Qian were to depart immediately for Jinghai to quell a Demon uprising.

Cheng Qian explained:

"Much of the Shaman Kingdom to the south has already been destroyed, and the region is in chaos. With Daoist Master Zhusheng having come north, those Demon Kings are no longer suppressed. They've been shamelessly testing our borders... That's why we've been ordered to go!"

If this had been a year ago, Li Ximing would have smiled, knowing Yang Ruiyi had done him this favor. But a full year had passed, leaving him somewhat baffled. He suppressed his doubts, bowed, returned the scroll, and stepped out. As expected, Xianyao and Sima Yuanli were waiting.

The two groups didn't say much. They bade each other farewell, mounted the wind, and plunged into the murky Great Void, speeding south.

Once clear of the mountain, Daoist Master Cheng Qian seemed to relax considerably. Li Ximing also breathed a sigh of relief. Finding a moment, he frowned.

"A reassignment for no apparent reason... Has the situation changed this past year?"

Daoist Master Cheng Qian said,

"You were in secluded cultivation healing your wounds, so I dared not disturb you... But while things have been quiet, Caishan only faced one or two probes from a Merciful One—seemed like they wanted to find out who was stationed here. Tangdao Mountain, however, has seen major events."

Li Ximing shot him a questioning look. Daoist Master Cheng Qian continued:

"Just after you entered seclusion, news came. Military Commissioner Situ blocked the northern army and arrived at Tangdao Mountain. But then he was suddenly ordered south to the Song Court for an audience with the Emperor. He's been there for months... so the General... had to remain in the north."

His words set Li Ximing to thinking. He understood at once.

'Yang Ruiyi couldn't return to the Wilderness... He's been stuck guarding Tangdao Mountain...'

"What was General Yang's reaction?"

Daoist Master Cheng Qian said,

"I heard of no reaction. But rumors are spreading privately that the north is planning another major move. They are determined to retake the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain... That must be why General Yang was ordered to remain."

Before Li Ximing could speak, Cheng Qian continued with a faint smile:

"Normally, being summoned back is just a formality, a ritual of paying respects. But Military Commissioner Situ just... _didn't_ come back. He stayed at the Imperial Court for a long time, petitioning the Song Court to gather the surviving blood descendants of the Situ family and allow him to re-establish his clan."

Li Ximing narrowed his eyes, realizing Situ Huo's intention.

"And how did the Monarch answer him?"

Daoist Master Cheng Qian appeared very polite, his own stance unreadable.

"The Situ family has long had no direct line. However, after a careful search, it was discovered that when Tangdao Mountain collapsed, the Purple Smoke Blessed Land took in a group of a Situ branch family. They are still in Yufu and have already been granted to Senior Situ."

He sighed with emotion.

"The whole affair took a year. Senior Situ only arrived back at Tangdao Mountain a month ago. Our reassignment must have been ordered by Lord Yang just before he left."

Li Ximing heard this, made some quick calculations in his mind, and remained silent for a long time.

'The true Situ direct descendants are still in the hands of the Buddhist cultivators. Situ Huo has become a hot commodity in the south, which means the karmic value of those descendants has skyrocketed...'

As he was pondering, he saw Cheng Qian turn to him with a serious expression. 

"My thanks, Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing paused, turning to look at him.

'So he knows he's benefiting from my connection... no longer having to guard Caishan. With everyone injured, whoever guards the northernmost point is the most likely to meet disaster... He's sharp.'

He chuckled and shook his head, not answering directly. Instead, he smiled.

"When we reach the Southern Sea, I have some personal matters to attend to. I may have to trouble you, Daoist Friend Cheng Qian."

The young man gave him a thoughtful look and quickly replied, "Lian understands! Please, Daoist Master, do not worry!"

His injuries were much better, and he was free from Caishan. Li Ximing's mood improved greatly. He took a talisman from his sleeve and sensed it with his Life Divine Ability.

"Qusi... still further south."
