# Chapter 1211: Three Alike

The world was filled with light, and white snow drifted down. Within the palace, spiritual qi swirled ethereally. A man in white stood at its center, pacing silently with a contemplative expression.

‘This Tang Xie… He truly is a formidable figure.’

One might see Tang Xie and Yuanshang chatting animatedly within that realm, looking quite satisfied, but Lu Jiangxian, watching from the side, had broken out in a cold sweat.

‘No wonder… no wonder he could preserve the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition to this day… Not only did he make the difficult sacrifice of decisively protecting the grotto-heaven from the grasp of a True Monarch, but he also survived the grand tide of the world known as the Sheji Apostasy…’

Yuanshang lacked a master's guidance and a Dao lineage to inherit, leaving him ignorant, but Tang Xie possessed true skill

Relying on mere scraps of information, he could grasp the crux of the matter… Over ninety percent of his assessments of the situation were correct, even bordering on the truth. Both his insight and his vision were extraordinary!

‘First, the methods of those from the ‘heavens’ to cross Rank Designations and ignore the arts of immortals were too terrifying and too conclusive in his eyes, which allowed him to believe completely. Second, Yuanshang himself is a man riddled with inconsistencies, making him less suspicious by nature. Had it been anyone else—never mind Dangjiang or Shaohui, even if I had personally possessed Zhengao—I would, in all likelihood, be questioned until a chill ran down my spine.’

After all, Lu Jiangxian’s initial goal had been to probe the original orthodoxy of the Supreme Yin… He never expected Tang Xie to have such a lofty perspective and clear objective, managing to unravel the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition in one fell swoop. This had alarmed him several times, and he had feared that another quarter-hour would have led to a question that exposed a flaw.

Now that things had finally settled, a wave of relief and gratitude washed over him:

‘That Immortal Xu Xiang did not misjudge him!’

Similarly, Tang Xie’s words had also brought him significant insights. Clasping his hands behind his back, he took a few steps within the hall and nodded to himself:

“So, the frequent mention of Zhang Yuanyu in the ancient texts is not without reason. His role in the world's grand tide was greater than I had first imagined… Is he not… nearly on the level of the Dragon-kin…”

If Tang Xie’s claim that Taiyuan was but a single step from the Dao Embryo was true, then the True Dragon so coveted by the Converging Water Dragon Monarch was likewise merely a manifestation of the Dao Embryo…

‘Perhaps there are still tiers among them… but from this perspective, the gap between Golden Cores is far greater than I imagined, while the gap between a Dao Embryo and a Golden Core… is likely difficult to compare.’

This was not good news. Lu Jiangxian had to re-evaluate the differences between the Underworld, Luoxia, and several other powers. He brooded with a trace of anxiety for a moment, his gaze turning to the snow-filled world outside.

His thoughts, however, diverged slightly from Tang Xie's:

‘If… Li Zhouwei succeeds… and a Bright Yang Golden Core is born, he cannot be without backing. Taiyuan does not have a fundamental conflict with the attainment of the Bright Yang Dao… Whether Taiyuan can be of assistance hinges entirely on what profit He stands to gain.’

“A revolution of the world… that is something that must be achievable. This is not enough… The schemes of Luoxia and the Underworld are too nebulous, to say nothing of the Taiyuan’s path…”

He let out a soft sigh, his gaze falling back to the tabletop, upon a jade slip as white as jade, where golden characters were inscribed:

‘To hold oneself in utmost esteem is the path; the immortals of Tushita knock upon the gates of authority…’

This incantation undoubtedly settled the last wisp of doubt in his heart:

“From the earliest Great Divination of Heaven-Governing, to the later Heavenly Dao Thunder, then to the Divine Dao Incense, and finally to the Bright Yang Imperial Authority, the actions of the Encompassing Profoundity Dao have followed an exceptionally clear tenet: to govern the heavens!”

“The Divine Court presides over the world, thereby governing the heavens. If the path of gods fails, they turn to the Thunder Palace. If the Thunder Palace falls, they use imperial authority. Even when that authority crumbles and they retreat to a corner of Jianghuai, they still harbor the ambition to rule the world through martial might!”

“The Encompassing Profoundity Dao and the ancient Heavenly Dao are inextricably bound! The sundering of heaven and earth, the annihilation of the Heavenly Dao, was also the annihilation of Encompassing Profoundity—or rather, they are one and the same event!”

Reaching this point, a suspicion faintly bloomed in his mind:

‘Does the so-called Heavenly Dao truly exist? Could it be a term of profound reverence and secrecy, in fact referring to the cultivators of Encompassing Profoundity, and even the Three Monarchs and Five Immortals who stand behind them?’

He was lost in thought for a long time, his burning gaze fixed on the golden characters upon the jade slip:

‘Furthermore, everything leaves traces and can be judged by a standard… Even the current Underworld, though it has gone its separate ways from the Encompassing Profoundity of old, still displays some intent to control the world’s Golden Malignance! And since the matter of Martial Cultivation involves the authority of kings and emperors, it naturally falls into the hands of the Underworld…’

‘For example… in the current affair of Li Zhouwei’s Bright Yang, the initiative should naturally fall to the Azure Profoundity, who govern Yin and Yang, and the Encompassing Profoundity, who govern the authority of kings and emperors… Each faction has its own rules; all follow the dictates of their own Dao.’

…

The radiance of the sun and moon shone as one. Within the pill furnace, crimson flames churned and leaped relentlessly. The Daoist Master beside the furnace was pale, yet his focus was absolute, not daring to waver for an instant. An unknown amount of time passed before he sensed a tiny flicker of light emerge from deep within the flames.

‘The moonlight is distinct…’

A smile finally touched Li Ximing’s lips, but that brief lapse in concentration immediately caused his divine ability to become unstable. He grit his teeth and focused his entire will on containing the mystical power. After another unknown stretch of time, the light before him gradually stabilized.

If before it had been merely a speck of different color within the fire, it was now like a tiny pinprick of light through a window screen, casting a clear, bright, and steady moonlight. Only then did Li Ximing relax his mind, carefully guiding the fire to recede as he nurtured the pill by the furnace’s warmth.

“Huu…”

The Daoist Master heaved a long sigh. Leaning against the table and chair, he wiped the cold sweat from his face.

The energy expended in refining this single pill was no less than what would be spent in a fierce, pitched battle. Though it inflicted no physical injuries, it had been a long and unceasing effort. Now that he had stopped, his spirit felt weary and his qi, sluggish. His two divine abilities felt as if they were on the verge of collapse; it had clearly damaged his vital qi.

‘This state of my divine abilities, like a man just recovering from a grave illness, is nearly as weak as when I was beaten by Changxiao and forced to flee east beyond the sea…’

This was even after receiving several boons from the East Life-Mandate Vase and consuming pills midway through the process; otherwise, he would never have lasted this long. In contrast, the object within the furnace, though past the most arduous step, still had a long road of slow nurturing and heating ahead.

‘Fortunately, I have already refined the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body and have the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire to assist me. I can now free my hands for my own affairs. Otherwise, another three to five years of nurturing this pill would have cost me half my life.’

He breathed a sigh of relief, slowly opened his eyes, and shifted his gaze.

He found that another person now sat upon the rush mat in the jade pavilion. His build was imposing, his temperament somber, and upon his brow were the four stars of the Piercing Sun. He leaned against a bright moon lampstand, a jade slip in his hands, which he was studying intently.

Seeing Li Ximing finally stir, the man raised his brows, revealing a pair of grayish-white eyes filled with cracks. A smile graced his lips. It was Li Zhouwei!

Joy immediately colored Li Ximing’s face. He rose and stepped forward, saying:

“What a coincidence!”

He studied the younger man carefully, discovering that his injuries seemed to have vanished. His back seemed even broader, and a condensed divine ability flowed across his body, exuding an intimidating pressure. Li Zhouwei smiled and said:

“It is all thanks to Grand-uncle’s spiritual pill!”

Li Ximing asked hurriedly:

“You’ve fully recovered?”

Li Zhouwei waved his hand.

“The trouble with the Wu Earth calamity is its ceaseless nature. With the protection I had, and Grand-uncle’s pill being so potent, I have spent these last few years focused on healing. As planned, I left only these eyes untreated for the sake of my cultivation… As for the rest, save for my Audience with the Celestial Gate divine ability being somewhat depleted…”

“Everything else is healed!”

After all, the pill had been forged with precious treasures, so such speed was not entirely unexpected. Li Ximing was quite pleased, nodding again and again before sighing:

“It is a pity that my Supreme Yin treasured pill is still a long way off…”

“I wouldn't say that.”

Li Zhouwei then nodded and said:

“Though the Crimson Severing Arrowhead is exceedingly difficult, I have now overcome the greatest hurdle. With this calamity upon me and these injuries remaining, now is the perfect time for cultivation. That pill can wait.”

Li Ximing understood his meaning and asked with a hint of excitement:

“How long will it take to polish it to perfection?”

The young man smiled faintly and said:

“Three to four years.”

Li Ximing was at once surprised and enlightened. Counting on his fingers, he said:

“That’s right. It has been over ten years since you forged your Crimson Severing Arrowhead. With your usual pair of divine abilities, you would have already forged the next immortal foundation by now. To think that it will take a total of fifteen or sixteen years to fully master this one divine ability—it truly shows how difficult the Crimson Severing Arrowhead is!”

“One reason is the difficulty of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead itself. The other is the scarcity of pills and suitable cultivation grounds. The amount of truly effective cultivation time has been quite limited.”

Li Zhouwei replied, then changed the subject.

“I have timed my visit precisely. I came specifically to discuss a matter with you, Grand-uncle…”

Li Ximing’s eyes brightened.

“You mean… Imperial Observation of the Origin?!”

“Correct.”

Li Zhouwei affirmed with a nod.

“Qi gathering takes time, after all. A period of three to four years is most suitable.”

The King of Wei’s expression grew serious as he continued:

“The Purple Mystery is an immortal threshold. Though I have not yet reached that step, I can already feel a stagnation within my Shengyang Acupoint. Countless geniuses throughout history have broken themselves against this barrier; to be stuck for only fifty or sixty years is considered a cause for celebration. Even I must be prepared to fail several times when facing this gate… Furthermore, we do not know the difficulty of gathering qi for the Imperial Observation of the Origin, so we must not treat this lightly.”

Without a word, Li Ximing immediately rose and accompanied him toward the High Firmament Pavilion. Li Zhouwei said gravely:

“I have examined all the divine abilities here. There are many of the Eternal Brightness Steps, but only two for Imperial Observation of the Origin. A few days ago, after fasting and bathing, this junior exchanged for one of them and is now awaiting its bestowal.”

The Eternal Brightness Steps was naturally not a consideration; they already possessed the Cui family’s Bright Origin Contemplating Fire Scripture, which was of that category, so there was no need to acquire another. Li Zhouwei glanced over, saw that the golden name had lit up, and showed it with a pleased expression:

“These two… one is concise and clear, called the Northern Emperor's Scripture of Wei, which is the one I have chosen. The other is more exquisite and intricate, called the Scripture of the Bright Mountain's Surging Waves.”

Li Zhouwei had clearly given this much thought. He sighed softly and said:

“These two are somewhat troublesome… Back then, the names related to the Crimson Severing Arrowhead were distinct, with a clear hierarchy of quality that made the choice obvious. These two, however, offer no such clues, and even the prices of the arts are similar, both around two hundred and seventy.”

Li Zhouwei paused for a moment.

“I made my judgment based on the name. The Northern Emperor's Scripture of Wei seems more ancient. The text for the Crimson Severing Arrowhead back then was also a 'Codex'—the Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light. This one is also a 'Scripture.'”

Li Ximing said simply:

“Your cultivation technique must not be treated lightly. Our family’s repository of immortal arts is so vast; I say you should simply choose the more expensive one… Besides, the path to the Purple Mystery is fraught with hardship. Since you are at such a crossroads, you could even acquire both and consult them together while seeking the Dao.”

A look of agreement appeared in Li Zhouwei’s eyes. He said:

“Let me try one first before we discuss that.”

He then took up the jade book filled with golden script and slowly closed his eyes. The vast scripture poured into his mind like a flowing river. An instant later, Li Zhouwei opened his eyes, his expression slightly odd.

Seeing his look, Li Ximing grew more curious. The King of Wei did not keep him in suspense.

“It is both difficult and not… The qi is called Imperial Sun-March Sha. The method for gathering it is highly complex. It requires the Supreme Yang to shine down upon an emperor’s traveling palace or burial ground, which must then be piled high with Bright Yang spiritual items… From this, one can gather the qi. The process will take three to five years.”

As he spoke, he transcribed the qi-gathering method and passed it to his elder. After reading it, Li Ximing’s brows furrowed slightly.

“An emperor’s traveling palace or burial ground… must it be someone who claimed the title of emperor? That shouldn't be too hard to find…”

Li Zhouwei nodded and said coolly:

“Not difficult, but rather conspicuous.”

After all, the closest location was the Song Emperor’s traveling palace. Given the current relationship between their two houses, gathering some qi would be a simple matter of dispatching a few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

‘But others are not blind; they will see that we are gathering qi… In the eyes of those great figures, would it not be a blatant declaration that I intend to cultivate Imperial Observation of the Origin?’

Li Ximing’s expression turned grave as he pondered in silence, but Li Zhouwei had already turned away, saying softly:

“Send someone to Chengyun to investigate first… Give the task to Jiangqian… he will handle it properly.”

Li Ximing started, then understanding dawned. He murmured to himself:

“Right. Chengyun was once Watersign Ridge, the tomb of the Ning State emperors… I wonder if it is of any use now…”

He nodded, tucking the matter away in his heart. As they left the immortal pavilion, he recounted the events of the past few days and mentioned the formation plans. Li Zhouwei responded succinctly:

“We need to be wary of Western Shu.”

“Jiangqian has already gone to make arrangements.”

Clearly, with Li Jiangqian present, Li Ximing’s burden was greatly lessened. At the very least, he no longer had to juggle such matters while refining pills. He smiled and said:

“I heard something from one of our juniors concerning the Quest for Gold that I specifically wanted to share with you. And since you just mentioned the Purple Mystery… it has given me an idea.”

Li Zhouwei turned his head in surprise. Li Ximing then explained in detail the Zhang family’s mention of the Intercalary Arts: the Three Alike, Two Different and the Four Alike, One Different. Li Zhouwei contemplated this for a moment, then placed a hand on the Azure Nether Bronze platform, his eyes burning as he said:

“Grand-uncle, you are referring to… the Purple Mystery?”

“Exactly!”

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly, impressed by his sharpness.

“Before the Zhang family spoke of it, I would never have conceived that the Three Alike, Two Different could be a path of cultivation. But now that he has raised it… this Three Alike… is that not the essence of the Purple Mystery?”

“Three Alike… yes.”

It had to be said that Li Ximing’s idea was incredibly well-founded. It made Li Zhouwei pause his actions, the light in his eyes growing ever brighter as he said softly:

“Brilliant… ‘Cān,’ in ‘Cān Zǐ,’ (Purple Mystery) means ‘to mix’ or ‘to consult.’ It might be a reminder for future cultivators to reflect on the paths of their predecessors… Wondrous… It is said that ‘a single word of the Dao is worth a thousand pieces of gold.’ There must be a reason for these names left by the ancients. Truly wondrous!”

This discovery allowed him to vaguely grasp something that had been just out of reach. Though he still lacked the final piece, his profound Dao-Profundity enabled him to draw a conclusion. After a long moment, he nodded.

“There may be a link between the Three Alike, Two Different and the Purple Mystery Immortal Threshold. It is highly probable that the reason for the threshold’s difficulty is the very factor that allows the Three Alike, Two Different to be cultivated. They might even… point to the same truth!”

This realization brought immense joy to them both, sending their thoughts racing. A faint worry, however, crept into Li Ximing’s heart as he replied:

“If that is the case… then it is truly time to choose a path for the Quest for Gold.”

Li Zhouwei caressed the Azure Nether Bronze platform. He naturally understood what his elder was implying, but he only shook his head slowly.

“Impossible.”

Li Ximing nodded lightly and composed his expression.

“Regarding the affairs here, I will have Jiangqian come in to explain all the arrangements. You should focus on your cultivation.”
