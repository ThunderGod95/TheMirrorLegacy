# Chapter 1167: Beyond the Three Realms

When Li Zhouwei finished his explanation of the cause and effect, including the matter of the Sword Gate, the Daoist Master at his side saw his expression flicker several times before he let out a heavy sigh.

"So that's how it was… I'd always assumed we couldn't rely on anyone from the north or south, but I was still waiting for them to show their hand. Now I see it's just as I feared."

Li Zhouwei pinched the bridge of his nose to ease the throbbing pain.

"Then there are the Dragon-kin," he said. "Two-faced and full of schemes. We can ignore them for now. The priority is to heal… the sooner I recover, the better."

He set the matter aside and changed the subject.

"There are two other things… I'm still in possession of the Great Xiukui Monastery's Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass and the Sima Family's Spiritual Treasure, the Huai River Map. One can amplify the Yang Cusp, the other can preserve one's life essence. Both are indispensable for suppressing my injuries. I'll need to borrow them for more than just a year or two, so I'll need you, Grand-uncle, to make the arrangements."

"Of course!"

They wouldn't bring it up, but their family had to make things right. Li Ximing nodded emphatically. Li Zhouwei paused, then added a reminder.

"During the battle, Sima Yuanli also produced a Pill of the Second Manifestation's Vast Yang. Though the man is agreeable but lacks fortitude, his mind full of distractions, it was a gesture to curry favor, and it cost him a fortune. We shouldn't remain in his debt…"

After all, that very pill was still glowing with a Bright Yang radiance within his sea of qi, a scorching sun continuously feeding him divine ability and dharma power. After the reminder, he steered the conversation back with a hint of a smile.

"As for the Great Xiukui Monastery, once I've healed, I will pay them a personal visit. The treasure that surprised me most in this battle was, without a doubt, the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!"

This was no exaggeration. Although the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass wasn't a decisive factor in the battle, the wondrous profundity it displayed throughout the fight was top-tier.

"For escape, it can sow chaos among the stars. For offense, it unleashes the killing power of High Radiance. Without any need for incantations or spells, it has four charges that can be used at a moment's notice. Even after they're exhausted, it simply reverts to a normal Spiritual Artifact, requiring hand seals and incantations."

"And on top of that… it has the divine effect of aiding one in reaching the Yang Cusp!"

Even though Li Ximing had never witnessed the compass display its divine might, his expression was one of deep approval. He had borrowed the Spiritual Artifact years ago and retained a vivid impression, even making a quiet, regretful comparison when he had traded for the Radiant Sun King's Halberd.

He spoke now, "I suggested a trade for it back then, but Senior Kui Qi declined on the grounds that it was a registered, sect-guarding treasure. Now that the Great Xiukui Monastery is in decline, a trade might not be out of the question. We'll just have to ensure they don't come out of it short."

"If a trade is impossible, so be it. The debt of gratitude we owe them comes first. The Xiukui are of the righteous path; we won't put the Lin clan in a difficult position."

The decline of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had sent shockwaves through the land, and the Li clan benefited greatly from the resulting turmoil—particularly from the state of the Great Xiukui Monastery. Furthermore, the deaths of two Xiukui Daoist Masters had shaken Jiangnan to its core.

From the cultivators of the Song State to the Yang clan, and even the lofty Song Emperor himself, all treated Lin Chensheng with a newfound respect, and Li Zhouwei was no exception.

Li Ximing nodded gravely.

"Besides that mystic tiger, there is still a Merciful One inside this Heavenly Nurture Urn. It cannot be left unguarded. I will take it out."

Saying no more, he collected the three Spiritual Artifacts and took his leave with haste, leaving Li Zhouwei standing alone in the hall. After a moment's hesitation, he finally formed an incantation seal.

That light, ethereal, cloud-riding sense of weightlessness washed over him once more. Darkness first filled his vision, followed by an explosion of light!

A cool, moon-like white jade pavilion emerged before him. The sight of the sun and moon sharing the sky was framed by the window lattice, and a familiar, perfectly balanced aura of yin and yang washed over him.

Li Zhouwei slowly opened his eyes.

The multicolored light in his eyes pulsed, its hues deepening. The fissure-like marks on his face lit up in succession, catching him by surprise.

'This calamity…'

The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth that had been plaguing his body flickered, seeming to have lost its target in a state of confusion. It gradually dimmed, and its ever-intensifying power slowed dramatically!

'Hmm?'

The deep furrow in Li Zhouwei's brow relaxed, a hint of joy in his eyes. He quickly closed them again, concentrating his senses.

'Is it being neutralized? …No, that's not it…'

The affliction was twofold. One part was the injuries sustained from direct hits in the great battle. The other was the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth, which caused an ever-denser Wu Light to well up from within him. This made it impossible to spare the focus to recover; in fact, his injuries were steadily worsening.

But the moment he entered this place, the calamity showed a distinct hesitation. If before it had been like a great sun in the sky, its light beating down unimpeded, now it was as if he had taken shelter under the eaves, avoiding a good portion of its force.

Not only that, but in his senses, the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth wasn't just suppressed; the gushing torrent of Wu Light was actively receding at an accelerating rate!

This filled Li Zhouwei with shock and elation, and his heart hammered in his chest.

'What is the principle behind the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth? How does it function… and just how potent is the divine ability of this Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance?'

All manner of theories flashed through his mind. The next instant, Li Zhouwei formed another incantation seal. The world around him faded like an illusion, and he was back in the great hall in Ting Province.

Just as he expected, the moment he left the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, a brilliant, mysterious glow pulsed into being, and the stinging pain of the calamity flared in response. The weakening Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth roared back to life, its power growing rapidly.

'The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth… a calamity…'

Understanding dawned in his eyes. He manifested once more within the Heaven, watching the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth slowly weaken inside him. He let out a long breath, rising to his feet and beginning to pace.

'It must be some kind of resonance. When the Crystalline Jade Branch struck me, it was as if I was branded with a mark—a focal point for the affliction, so to speak. That's the source of this unending Wu Light. It originates from the Spiritual Treasure… no, that's not all… Is it a Rank Designation or a Dharma Treasure?'

"No… it can't be either of those."

The multicolored light in his eyes slowly faded.

"The Azure Insight Origin Mirror is on the lake! Neither a Rank Designation nor a Dharma Treasure can reach this place. It must be… a profound power that attunes to the Wu Earth Fruition Attainment itself!"

"The Azure Insight Origin Mirror cannot sever the link to the Fruition Attainments that form the foundation of Heaven and Earth… otherwise it would be impossible to gather 'Pit Water's' River-Center Clear Qi or 'Pristine Water's' Grotto-Spring Clear Qi on Moongaze Lake…"

"And what severs the link to the Wu Earth Fruition Attainment isn't merely the fact that the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance is a grotto-heaven!"

The Crystalline Jade Branch had been infamous since primordial times. Countless high-level cultivators throughout history had been struck by the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth. In the old days, grotto-heavens in the Great Void were plentiful. Surely a dignified cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm could enter one to recuperate?

"It's because the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance is on a higher level than the Azure Insight Origin Mirror. It exists outside the three realms of the mortal world, the Great Void, and the grotto-heavens—realms both tangible and intangible. It is not bound by the Five Virtues! To be conservative, it is, at the very least, beyond the influence of Wu Earth!"

"If cultivators of old had practiced here, they could likely have avoided the three calamities and nine tribulations, free from the jurisdiction of Heaven-Governing Thunder, worldly disasters, and the Underworld's registry, and walked the Great Dao in perfect freedom."

"If I…"

He let out a long, slow breath, quickly suppressing the impulse.

"No… since this place is outside the Fruition Attainments, not only is the Quest for Gold impossible here, but one cannot even connect to the Great Void through the Shengyang Acupoint when breaking through with a divine ability. One must eventually return to the mortal world, exposed to the gaze of every True Monarch. Besides, a life of idle detachment is not the Dao of Bright Yang…"

Li Zhouwei quickly cast aside these distracting thoughts, calming his mind to take stock of the situation. He felt the pressure on him lighten considerably.

"With this advantage, at least I won't have to constantly fight the calamity while inside this grotto-heaven. I only need to wait for it to recede, then I can eradicate the accumulated Wu Light and focus entirely on healing… Once I've recovered, even cultivation will not be a problem!"

"And Grand-uncle can take his time searching for a way to remove the source of the affliction. Without the interference of this dense Wu Light, uprooting it will be much easier. And in the worst-case scenario, even if the taint can't be removed, facing it at my full strength versus fighting it while crippled are two completely different things!"

His mind at ease, he immediately sat down cross-legged. Torrents of divine ability surged through him, dissolving the Wu Light and healing his wounds. Shafts of Heavenly Light converged upon him, illuminating his face in a brilliant radiance.

…

Li Ximing rode the wind out of the hall and casually crushed a jade talisman to summon Guo Nanwu. As he did, he found Ting Province already abuzz with celebration, decorated from end to end and filled with a festive air. A quick glance revealed that the various Daoist Traditions of the Song State had all come to offer their congratulations.

Not only had the smaller traditions sent representatives, but even the Sima and Lingu clans, who had just retreated from the war between north and south, had sent people. Even the Purple Smoke and Cheng clans were represented. Most came under the pretext of celebrating Daoist Master Changli's breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm, while discreetly trading the latest news.

'King Wei slew Qi Lanyan, the direct heir of the Comprehending Profoundity lineage who ruled Jianghuai!'

'A great victory! The three Holders of the Profound from the noble houses have pacified Jianghuai together…'

News of the breakthrough of Li Jiangqian, King Wei's eldest son, had spread far and wide, but the glory of slaying Qi Lanyan in battle was truly immense. Even to the Li family, it sounded almost unbelievable. One joyous event followed another, and the entire island was filled with a fervent atmosphere. The two guards standing watch before the main hall bowed low, and even they wore smiles when they raised their heads.

Seeing this, much of the gloom weighing on Li Ximing's heart lifted. He paused for a moment, just as Li Jiangzong entered, dressed in celebratory red. Li Ximing asked,

"What are the losses?"

"Daoist Master, we have won a great victory in the south. Casualties on the lake were minimal, and we lost only a few Qi Refining disciples taking Xuanmiao. The enemy prostrated themselves in surrender. Uncle Zhouda has already sent a letter back, asking for your guidance…"

The fighting in this war was ferocious, and the primary casualties had been among those of the Purple Mansion Realm. Li Ximing's greatest fear had been losing one of his own direct heirs in some unforeseen incident. He managed a small smile as he listened to Li Jiangzong's report.

"Our kinsman reports that the spiritual treasuries at Xuanmiao Temple have been secured by Gongsun Bofan, Daoist Miaoshui, and Dharma Protector Ding respectively. They have all fallen into our hands. As for now… do we wait for the Great Song to send someone for the handover, or…"

He left the rest unsaid, but Li Ximing understood perfectly. He nodded.

"Take it all! Don't leave them a single copper!"

Helian Wujiang's three Spiritual Artifacts falling into their hands was a clear signal of the Yang clan's attitude. Regarding Li Zhouwei appearing at the Sword Gate and shattering the tacit truce between north and south, Yang Ruiyi was clearly making a gesture of apology. And with their own family on the verge of establishing a mystic realm, they were in desperate need of resources. Li Ximing felt no need to be polite.

'This is nothing! The rewards from the Song Imperial Court are the real prize!'

Li Jiangzong's eyes lit up, and he nodded eagerly. Li Ximing raised a hand, adding a word of caution.

"It's good that Xuanmiao Temple is under our control. Ransack it as you please, but do not touch their Ancestral Hall. And that painting especially—it's best if you don't even look at it."

After all, Xuanmiao Temple still operated under the banner of Xu Xiang. And who knew if the Great Daoist Master of the Numinous Treasure Order had already departed. If one of their own did something insulting and was struck dead by a single wisp of his aura, Li Ximing could only swallow the bitter pill in silence.

Li Jiangzong quickly agreed, his face full of anticipation. "Elder Brother has reached the Purple Mansion Realm and refined a divine ability. He is one who has transcended the illusory to grasp the real. For three generations now, our family has produced such figures, making us the foremost of the Great Song's clans. The celebratory banquet… I wonder when it should be arranged?"

Li Ximing could tell at once that an elder had coached him. He had been on edge for days, and the formal words left him in a daze. He mused internally,

'That's right. Three generations who have refined divine abilities. Our family clawed its way up from nothing to reach the pinnacle of Jiangnan's great houses. It's only right that we burn incense, pray for good fortune, and report our success to the ancestors…'

'The higher you climb, the clearer you see the figures at the summit, and the more you realize how small you are.'

But he wasn't worried. Instead, his expression softened slightly as he smiled.

"Wait a little longer. There's still Wan'er. It's not too late for a joint celebration."

Li Jiangzong understood at once and nodded expectantly. Before he could say more, a ray of clear light streaked through the air and landed before the hall.

A young man's deep, steady voice rang out.

"Congratulations, Senior! Congratulations, King Wei!"

Li Ximing smiled and nodded, glancing at the junior beside him. Li Jiangzong tactfully withdrew. Li Ximing's expression immediately changed, and he sighed.

"The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth is the true menace. Nanwu, can you ask Qusi for me?"

Guo Nanwu nodded, his face serious.

"That is precisely why I have come!"

Li Ximing was instantly overjoyed and hurried forward to listen as Guo Nanwu spoke gravely.

"The Great Daoist Master has been following matters on the mainland. He heard what happened to King Wei and learned of the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth. He privately detests Qi Lanyan's viciousness and knows that this calamity cannot be left to fester—the longer it lingers, the more terrifying it becomes. Concerned that certain parties might hope to see King Wei delayed by it, he sent me here specifically."

Li Ximing nodded again and again.

"I am deeply moved by the Great Daoist Master's concern. This timely aid is like sweet dew on a parched day!"

Guo Nanwu continued, "The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth is a calamity. While my Great Daoist Master does not have a solution himself, he knows where one can be found… The most supreme methods and miraculous pills for evading calamities are all found with the Azure Step. Even the mighty Underworld cannot compare in this art!"

Guo Nanwu's words were polite, but Li Ximing's trust in the south was at an all-time low. He didn't for a second believe the Underworld couldn't solve the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth; they simply lacked the incentive. He couldn't be bothered to argue the point. He'd never imagined that the lineage most skilled in this art was not some distant power, but one so close at hand. Joy bloomed in his chest.

"The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition?! I'll go visit them right now!"

Hearing this, Guo Nanwu looked hesitant and stopped him.

"The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is indeed of the Azure Profoundity orthodoxy. However, according to what my Qusi knows, that eminence within their ranks does not specialize in evading calamities. What teachings exist on the matter are held by a few of their True Monarchs and are not typically passed down…"

"According to the Great Daoist Master, among the distant orthodoxies, the Dantai of the Nine Mounds or the Han clan of Chang Prefecture would be your best options. Closer to home… you could either approach the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition, or… follow the path of Supreme Yin and seek out Chunyi."

Sudden realization dawned on Li Ximing's face, but a strange feeling stirred in his heart. He muttered to himself,

'The path of Supreme Yin? Seek out Chunyi?'
