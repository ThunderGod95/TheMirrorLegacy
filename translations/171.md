# Chapter 184: Envoy from Mount Yue

In the great hall, the candlelight flickered. Li Yuanxiu stood to the side at the highest seat with an envoy from Mount Yue kneeling below him, his head pressed firmly against the ground.

He spoke with respect, "My humble self greets the Young Family Head! Our king remembers the friendship between our two families and often speaks of the health of my aunt and uncle, and recalls the alliance between our two families... He has sent many products from our region. Currently, the position of queen remains vacant, and the king still hopes to marry a daughter from the Li Family..."

Li Yuanxiu stepped forward and descended two steps from his elevated position. The clan soldiers on both sides immediately focused their attention on this envoy from Mount Yue.

Chen Donghe, who was standing below the steps, also went on high alert, ready for any sudden movements from the visitor.

"Our Li Family is located in the east and has only heard of the upheavals in Mount Yue. Mu Jiaoman's side branches have all perished without survivors... With the envoy coming from afar, can you enlighten me on this matter?"

Li Yuanxiu did not respond to the envoy's initial address, instead bringing up the details of the unrest in Mount Yue. This caused the envoy to stammer and sweat profusely.

The current king of Mount Yue, Qimu, although following Mu Jiaoman's orders to kill his brothers, had such an excuse often doubted within his own territory. Naturally, that excuse alone was not sufficient to convince Li Yuanxiu.

The envoy could only shakily say, "There was unrest... it resulted in the death of the previous king's heirs, and a change in kingship is inevitable... it wasn't our king's intention. He made sure to protect the mother queen, which was indeed meritorious!"

The 'mother queen' naturally referred to the woman from the Li Family who had been married off there. Mu Jiaoman, while keeping the woman in his palace, acted cautiously, never allowing her to bear children. Her status in the palace was quite unique, and during the turmoil, forces from all sides sent protection for her immediately.

Li Yuanxiu listened but made no response. Observing the Mount Yue envoy trembling before him, he contemplated to himself quietly.

Before Shamoli breaks through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, we should pacify Qimu to prevent him from becoming suspicious and seek help elsewhere, potentially causing trouble. Everything should remain as usual, making him feel at ease.

Tributes and trade are easy to agree upon; it's just a matter of issuing another order. However, if a daughter of our clan were to marry over there... wouldn't she become a widow within a few years? There are many daughters in the minor clans right now, but several clan uncles and elders will inevitably make a fuss.

The envoy from Mount Yue, not understanding the situation, thought Li Yuanxiu was angry and trembled like a leaf. His sweat was pooling on the stone floor, almost forming a small puddle.

Li Yuanxiu then spoke up, breaking the silence softly.

"Mount Yue wishes to continue the marital alliance with our family, and we, the Li Family, also agree. Matters of tributes and trade will follow the old practices; there is no need for changes."

"Thank you, great king! Thank you, great king!"

The envoy bowed deeply several times in relief, blurting out his thanks, calling Li Yuanxiu a "great king". Li Yuanxiu raised his hand slightly, smiling warmly.

"However... our family does not have many daughters to marry off as of now. They hold significant status within the clan, so we can't simply arrange a marriage... Besides, my father is currently cultivating in seclusion. I, the Young Family Head, am not easy to persuade like my father. There is one condition for this marital alliance with Mount Yue."

"Do tell, great king," the envoy quickly said, to which Li Yuanxiu, still smiling, replied, "How could my family's daughter marry into the West without land to showcase her prestige? To the west of Eastern Mount Yue, there are several villages. Let Qimu conquer a few villages to the west as a celebration gift for our daughter's wedding."

"T-That's..."

Caught off guard by Li Yuanxiu's demand, the Mount Yue envoy momentarily froze, knowing well that granting lands to a daughter who would wield no real power upon marrying out merely meant extra tax revenue from those lands.

He could only respond, "Would it be possible to grant a land or two from the various villages of Eastern Mount Yue? Our king is not stingy! The region is unstable, and it might not be advisable to mobilize troops rashly..."

Li Yuanxiu frowned and, cutting him off mid-sentence with a commanding tone, challenged, "Is this truly the extent of your king's sincerity?!"

As Mount Yue was in a position of weakness and reliant on the Li Family for survival, the envoy, naturally becoming submissive, panicked under Li Yuanxiu's intimidation and started begging for mercy.

"This lowly one will report back to the king immediately! A response will be provided within a few days... please, forgive me, Young Family Head!"

"You're dismissed."

Li Yuanxiu simply waved his hand, and the envoy hurriedly retreated.

Then, a clan soldier brought forward another person dressed in Mount Yue attire who kneeled and cupped his fist instead as he greeted, "Young Family Head!"

"What news does my clan sister bring?" Li Yuanxiu asked, lifting his head.

The messenger from Mount Yue then pulled a thick stack of documents from his chest pocket and replied respectfully, "The Queen Mother has recorded all the arrangements Qimu made upon ascending to power, along with the distribution and locations of Mount Yue cultivators within the state here."

Li Pingyi stepped forward to receive the book, and Li Yuanxiu nodded with a smile. He then said softly, "Tell my clan sister when you return to first excel in her role as Queen Mother, and within these few years, we'll find a way for her to reunite with her family."

"Understood."

The man bowed in gratitude and withdrew.

Li Yuanxiu then took the stack of documents from the approaching Li Pingyi, spread them out, and began to read. He muttered to himself, "Three at the early stage of Qi Cultivation Realm... one at the mid-stage... all are cultivators with unrefined qi. Mount Yue is indeed too weak; no wonder Qimu was able to stabilize the state in one fell swoop. He couldn't afford to wait and has come to affiliate himself."

As Li Yuanxiu read on, Li Yuanjiao was already standing in the courtyard. He glanced at the Mount Yue messenger. Once the messenger had exited the courtyard, Li Yuanjiao spoke, "Although our clan sister is from the minor sect, she's no easy mark. Mu Jiaoman was wary of her while alive, yet she quickly garnered support after his death and meticulously gathered information, placing people within the trade caravans that were returning home, which is no small feat."

"Hmm."

Li Yuanxiu simply nodded, continuing to read the letter before responding, "When selecting a daughter from the minor clan to go west that year, she was chosen with great care, and her entourage was loyal. When she returns, we must acknowledge her and her group's contributions."

The Li Family's marriages were certainly more strategic than when Mu Yalu had come over alone in her time. Not only could the clan daughter return home annually, but she could also bring many loyal attendants along with her.

After listening to his brother's explanation, Li Yuanjiao nodded in agreement.

"Brother, Shamoli has already broken through the fifth stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm and has been persuaded by me to go into seclusion... The spirit fruits have also been delivered to him. With these aids, he should attempt to break through the Qi Cultivation Realm within two years."

"Good!" Li Yuanxiu commended as he nodded. He pondered for a moment, then softly added, "I'll also personally go up the mountain to make sure that our family is prepared with a portion of unrefined qi."

Li Yuanjiao chuckled softly and responded, "From what I managed to listen to outside, brother, your method is indeed effective. No matter whether the new king of Mount Yue takes one or two towns in the west, in the end, it will still belong to our Li Family!"

Li Yuanxiu's face, which bore a resemblance to Li Yuanjiao's but with a more relaxed and casual expression, curved into a smile. He glanced at his brother below and replied, "We both know the family's strategies; it's merely closing a loop. With Mount Wu sealed off, the villages of Mount Yue to the west have lost their backing. According to the reports, Qimu also harbors ambitions to expand westward... I'm merely giving him reasons to act. When he conquers more villages for our family, his troops will also suffer from the strain and commit atrocities. It will be more legitimate for Shamoli to replace him then."

"You always think things through so thoroughly," Li Yuanjiao praised with a smile of awe.

Li Yuanxiu waved his hand and replied, "It's a small move that doesn't greatly impact the overall situation, but it'll make subsequent plans run more smoothly."

"As for the clan daughter to be married off... brother, whom do you plan to send?" Li Yuanjiao asked.

Li Yuanxiu shifted his gaze from the letter and his voice was soft when he replied, "Nobody."

Li Yuanjiao was momentarily stunned, then quickly grasped his brother's intention, murmuring, "Brother, I understand your care for our clanspeople, but will this really work..?"

"Li Yuanxiu smiled and nodded, explaining, "We'll find a respectable family in the town that's willing to provide a daughter... We will then train her up and send her over. Whether Qimu realizes it or not, he'll have to pinch his nose and accept her. Would he dare complain? Once we control Eastern Mount Yue, we can bring her back, and she'll have earned the status of a branch family. Surely, many families will be willing to volunteer themselves then!"

Li Yuanjiao lowered his eyes slightly. His care for his clan members was based on affection rather than bloodline, and he was inclined to truly send a clan daughter to appease Qimu, even if there was a slight chance of causing a disturbance.

However, since Li Yuanxiu had spoken thus, he could only nod in agreement. He replied solemnly, "As long as you are confident about this, Brother."

Li Yuanxiu looked at him, catching wind of the disagreement in his mind. Setting aside what he was holding, he then said gently, "Qimu is requesting a daughter from the minor sect... There are five bloodlines within the minor sect, which have been separated since our great-grandfather's time. The elders from families are very old and usually silent, yet their feelings must be considered. These people are closely related to us and are instrumental in managing our household affairs. Several of the elders have the ear of our father and granduncle. If we were really to marry off a clan daughter indiscriminately, the clan's elders would have significant objections... Remember, harmony within the family is paramount."

Li Yuanjiao scoffed at this.

"Who cares what they think?! They're just ordinary people."

"Jiao'er!" Li Yuanxiu shook his head, saying in a stern voice, "The reason our family stays closely knit is firstly due to the orderly transmission of our cultivation techniques, and secondly, because of the humility and respect within our ranks—from honoring the elderly to cherishing the young. If these principles collapse, what follows will be endless bloody strife and a disordered, fragmented clan, rendering the intelligence of future generations useless. We are the role models for the younger generations; they will remember how you act today. Don't underestimate those noisy elders; they may seem to fuss over securing advantages for their descendants, but they understand the gravity of major right and wrong. They restrain their descendants from disgraceful acts, contributing significantly to the stability ensured by the Clan Affairs Courtyard."

Li Yuanxiu stared into his brother's eyes, explaining, "If these elders see their children committing acts that disgrace the family, they would even hobble over to the Clan Affairs Courtyard with their canes to report it. They understand the importance of the family's reputation and deeply wish for its prosperity. Moreover, for the sake of the family, Uncle Qiuyang and several cultivators from the minor sect have been diligently supporting us. If you marry off their children like this today, and annihilate Qimu tomorrow, it will dishearten these people."

Li Yuanjiao opened his mouth, not expecting Li Yuanxiu to have thought so deeply. His view of those nagging elders improved significantly, and he nodded, murmuring, "I see... thank you for enlightening me, Brother!"

Li Yuanxiu nodded approvingly, continuing, "In the past, it was natural to be cautious of those from the minor sects when our main family lacked capable cultivators. Now that our main family is thriving, with our granduncle's swordsmanship unmatched on the lake, these minor sects and branches are invaluable aids in managing our affairs. The approach should be to embrace and favor them, treating them as our own."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in agreement. The brothers exchanged a smile and a few more pleasantries before Li Yuanxiu chuckled and revealed, "I've now broken through to the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm!"

"Really?"

Li Yuanxiu had started cultivating earlier than Li Yuanjiao, who had rapidly advanced through the Profound Scenery Stage thanks to a talisman seed, and had broken through to the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm a few months earlier. Li Yuanxiu, catching up a few months later, also had a commendable pace.

"Why would I even lie about that?" Li Yuanjiao laughed.

Li Yuanxiu calculated the time and spoke, somewhat concerned, "As the day of the sacrifice ritual approaches, with several elders still in seclusion aiming for breakthroughs and no sacrificial offerings prepared, I've already made arrangements... But I fear if the elders don't emerge soon, we might miss the deadline."

At the cave dwelling on Meiche Peak, there were three stone chambers where Li Tongya, Li Xuanxuan, and Li Xuanfeng each resided in seclusion. Li Xuanling, however, meditated in the great hall, having sat cross-legged on a straw mat throughout the night. The main door of the cave trembled slightly, and two clan soldiers stepped aside as a woman dressed in a white robe entered.

She had a dignified appearance and smiled gently at him.

"My dear," Lu Wanrong said, now at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm in her cultivation—considered quite capable among the external clan cultivators. With a warm smile, she approached him, holding a bamboo-woven food basket which she placed on the stone table.

Li Xuanling spoke softly upon seeing this, "They could have brought it up; you didn't need to trouble yourself by coming all the way here..."

Cultivators at the first four stages of the Embryonic Breathing Realm exhibit vigorous blood qi and consume large amounts of food. Once they break through the crucial Jade Capital Stage and transcend the mortal realm, their need for food drastically reduces.

Upon reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm, and being blessed with the longevity of a deity, they sustained themselves on air and dew, needing only to drink clean water. If they eat at all, it must be spirit meat or spirit rice, as secular food could hinder their cultivation progress.

Li Xuanling, at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm and a step or two from the Qi Cultivation Realm, still required regular meals; roughly once every day or two. Now that his household was prosperous, he no longer consumed ordinary grain but spirit rice and demon beast meat instead.

Lu Wanrong opened the food basket and retrieved two tiers—one containing steamed, pristine spirit rice, and the other several slices of tender, red demon meat.

Li Xuanling took the jade chopsticks from his wife and ate slowly, chewing thoughtfully.

After he was done, Lu Wanrong handed him some tea which he accepted gracefully. She spoke softly, "Yuanyun hasn't come down from the mountain for over a year, and I'm really worried about him. He's very proud at heart, and despite the setback, he won't share his troubles with us..."

Li Xuanling's expression became pained and slightly guilty as he responded to his wife's concerns.

"I'm aware of that."
