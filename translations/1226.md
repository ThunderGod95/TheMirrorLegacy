# Chapter 1226: Hasty

The Dao of water and fire flourished, spearheaded by the path of their union, their influence spreading in all directions. In this landscape, Chen Yin's divine abilities and Daoist inheritance were unremarkable... even the Way of the Sword he wielded seemed dim and colorless under the brilliance of the great Daoist orthodoxy led by the Sword Gate.

Yet now, the sword light in this Daoist Master's hand pulsed with infinite killing intent. Concealing a crimson hue, it surged upward like a great wave, unexpectedly shattering the boundless light of Earth Virtue and, for a moment, holding the cascading radiance at bay!

Seizing this moment of respite, Li Que'wan activated her Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure. A light like shimmering silver sand enveloped her, and her figure swiftly faded from sight.

'Chen Yin...'

The headless body in the sky trembled as the injuries he had forcefully suppressed flared up once more. The phantom multicolored light in his hands dimmed bit by bit before scattering without a trace, and a roiling gray wind swept down, shrouding his form again.

Rapidly expanding above his head was another golden spiritual sword, its light crisscrossing the sky!

It was none other than Cheng Jiuwen!

This spiritual sword was entirely different from the longsword Cheng Jiuwen usually wielded; it was barely an's arm length. Two grooves were carved into its body, from which flowed a bright white luster as it soared through the air, aimed directly at Qing Jifang's brow.

Meanwhile, Shangguan Mi, who had been tasked with delaying the sword cultivator, was now suppressed in the Great Void by a mystic mountain of white stone. A divine power that sealed the surroundings rippled outward, impossible to dispel no matter how the valiant general’s flames surged.

'Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain.'

The Sword Gate's foundation was truly extraordinary. This Daoist Master had finally broken free of the siege, and with two treasures displaying their might in unison, a potent killing intent instantly arose. Qing Jifang's situation became dire. He clapped his hands together and then parted them, and the round pearl of gray qi returned to his palm.

"Clang!"

The clash of metal resounded through the sky, drawing down a heavenly rain. The round pearl shook continuously, trembling as if in agony, but the golden sword had vanished, leaving only a vast golden qi to crash down upon the headless body with the falling rain.

Yet, a far deeper sense of crisis welled up in Qing Jifang's heart.

"Strike!"

A clear shout rang out as a streak of light shot forward. Qing Zhuo's expression darkened as he infused his hand with green light and tapped lightly in mid-air. The tap seemed to strike a patch of darkness, revealing the form of a brown pouch. At this touch, the mouth of the pouch twisted open, and an intense radiance of the Supreme Yang erupted, grazing past the headless body in the sky before plummeting onto the great desert!

"Boom!"

The intense light of the Supreme Yang shot skyward, drawing the gazes of all present. With the appearance of this iconic Spiritual Treasure, who could fail to recognize its owner? Sure enough, a Daoist Master in black appeared with a cold expression—it was Lin Chensheng!

The great battle had dragged on long enough for him to arrive!

All his tactics had come to naught. As time stretched on, he had been forced onto the defensive. The divine abilities in the sky trembled; Qing Jifang felt golden qi invade his entire body. The breath he had just gathered dissipated, and his internal injuries throbbed with a dull ache, constantly interfering with his techniques. Even with boundless rage in his heart, he was, for the moment, powerless.

He truly could not be blamed for this—from the 'Supreme Yin' and 'Protecting Wood' Spiritual Treasures to the ways of shamanic arts and the 'Vault Metal' Dao, one would be hard-pressed to find another place in all of Jiangnan with so many unorthodox divine abilities!

He was not the only one who had paused; so too had all the divine abilities clashing in the great desert. Nearly everyone understood the current situation. The powers they used for their attacks swiftly receded, leaving only their majestic auras to put on a brave front.

Chen Yin might not carry much weight on his own, but the influence of a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator on the battlefield could not be underestimated. Qing Jifang was already severely wounded, and the Spiritual Treasures of Lin Chensheng and Cheng Jiuwen were both immensely powerful. At this moment, his very life was in danger!

'They both returned from a great war, both with unhealed wounds, but there is still a difference. If Great Daoist Master Wu Gan were here instead of Great Daoist Master Danyin, this formation would have undoubtedly been broken...'

Shangguan Mi slowly retreated a few steps, brushing a hand over the wound on his face. A flickering flame danced over the bloody gash, restoring its surface to its original state as he heaved a long sigh in his heart.

Strictly speaking, Qing Jifang had arrived with overwhelming momentum. Had Moongaze Lake possessed but one or two fewer reinforcements, destroying the great formation would have been no issue. But this battle had been full of unexpected turns, ending in utter frustration. A failure was a failure, no matter how you sliced it. Unorthodox Daoist traditions and Spiritual Treasures could only serve as excuses.

'There's nothing left to fight for... The northern expedition was fruitless, the eastern invasion was hasty. Wasting the nation's fortune to squabble over pride, that's all this is!'

Before his helpless eyes, Qing Zhuo finally strode out from the Great Void. His figure was like a wisp of a spring breeze as he plucked the amber pearl suspended in the void. His fingertips deftly maneuvered a brownish-yellow talisman, placing it precisely upon the pearl, which he then held high, illuminating the entire area.

The divine power that had momentarily halted the storm of golden qi unfurled once more. As the pearl's color rapidly faded, amber light rained down from the heavens like a torrential downpour, shaking the Great Void and connecting with every Daoist Master from the lands of Shu.

'It's the 'Manifestations Earth' divine power!'

At the same time, Danyin rose from the Great Void, having already dispelled the golden light that covered him. Though his gaze toward Yehui was still frigid, he had no choice but to call upon his divine ability, pushing his Dao-Profundity to its absolute limit!

Gathering of Bitter Herbs.

An emerald green radiance expanded infinitely, like a meandering river flowing across the great desert. Li Ximing coughed up a mouthful of blood as he finally reclaimed the Merging Fire, suppressed the technique, and began to regulate his injuries.

A soaring light shone as Li Jiangqian drew back his long spear. Dense golden threads now coiled around him, ensnaring a fiercely burning, flame-like pearl. The Daoist Master he had been fighting, his body wreathed in flowing flames, had long since decided to retreat. Now, riding the wave of divine power, he fell back. Li Jiangqian did not pursue, watching coldly and letting out a quiet breath of relief.

'He's finally leaving.'

His gaze shifted, sweeping over the assembled Daoist Masters in silent contemplation.

Though Qing Jifang had been battered and beaten, the might of Changhuai remained. Without a cultivator from the Yang Clan present to command, nobody could stop Qing Jifang if he wished to withdraw. Cheng Jiuwen silently stayed his hand, and Lin Chensheng was halted by a mere glance from Chen Yin. The various masters of divine abilities stood with differing expressions, some observing Li Que'wan, others sizing up Yehui. Across the entire desert, not a single cultivator of the Great Song dared to stand in their way.

Only the amber light still raging in the sky separated east from west. The great desert was a scene of utter devastation. Even the great formation underfoot, which had absorbed most of the aftershocks from the divine abilities, was now riddled with the scars of battle.

'I came with plans to conquer you, and you were meant to obediently accept it. If you gain the upper hand, you are forbidden from killing my people. We let each other go, and that is the 'dignity' I grant you. Truly the way of the great Daoist traditions, their tyranny is so profound. No wonder he can withstand Qing Jifang's turmoil!'

'The only one who dares to refuse this 'dignity,' who can force a great power's pawn into a desperate corner, or even slay them on the spot... is Father!'

Li Jiangqian watched with cold eyes, his gaze sweeping the scene, feeling not a shred of joy at having repelled the Western Shu. He was not one to let matters rest, and even after fighting the enemy commander to a state of confusion, a dark anger still simmered within him.

'Just you wait...'

However, it was only at this very moment that the great weight in his heart finally lifted. The years of preparation and the overcoming of countless difficulties had finally paid off!

'With this victory, my family has established a firm foothold in the great desert. This Ministerial Fire Seeking Evil Spirit Formation can now truly be called a grand formation of our own making. From this day forward, with this formation to rely on, we need no longer fear a sudden crossing by the Western Shu, and we have gained a precious new land to shelter our subordinates...'

Though his heart was filled with elation, his expression remained solemn. He took a step forward and spoke in a formal tone.

"My thanks to you all!"

Zhong Qian, who was nearest to him, merely nodded, the rolling thunder in his hands suppressing a sword-shaped object. This Daoist Master spoke to no one. He cupped his fist, then suddenly heard Chen Yin step forward and say urgently,

"I must ask you all to accompany me to Yuyang!"

"Yuyang?!"

Li Ximing was taken aback for a moment before understanding dawned. Chen Yin spoke in a rush.

"I was ordered to guard the Mushroom Forest Plains. Just now, we were beset by enemies on two fronts, and I was delayed by Li Muyan. Fortunately, he was wounded, so I shook him off and came north. Now that the siege here is broken, please, come with me to support the south at once!"

Chen Yin did not have many years left; his only concern was his ancestral legacy. He could afford to leave his own affairs in the south unattended, firstly because there was no truly urgent cry for help from his clan, and secondly because he had long ago given his promise to the Li Clan...

He was already fraught with worry, how could he possibly remain idle now?
He immediately heard Cheng Jiuwen, who was beside him, reply.

"It is only right!"

This Daoist Master was perhaps the least injured among all the cultivators present. However, he had first been blocked by the Shu general Shangguan Mi, renowned for his valor, and then had been watched like a hawk by Qing Zhuo, rendering him largely ineffective. His face was etched with guilt.

Since Chen Yin had rushed to their aid, the Li Clan would naturally lend as much strength as they could. Cheng Qian was currently considered a person of some standing in the Great Song, and would go with them to rescue the Chen Clan. Li Jiangqian, meanwhile, secretly activated his Spirit Probe. Confirming that Qing Jifang and his contingent had withdrawn, he then said softly,

"My elder and my sister are both injured, so I cannot easily leave. I must ask Senior Liu to go in my family's stead as reinforcements."

"Many thanks, Your Highness!"

With those parting words, Chen Yin sped southward.

After all, the Western Shu still had two Great Daoist Masters. Even if one was guarding the north, that left another free to attack Yuyang; the danger was still very real. Liu Changdie responded with a grave tone, then followed Chen Yin and the others, riding the wind as they departed at great speed.

And so, on the great desert where powerful divine abilities had just clashed, only the cultivators of the Li Clan and the unwelcome Yehui remained. The atmosphere grew quiet. Li Jiangqian rode the wind over to support Li Ximing, took a step forward, and declared earnestly,

"In this battle, Senior's contributions were the greatest!"

These words were directed squarely at Yehui!

No one present lacked a discerning eye. The fact that the Western Shu had been so easily defeated was due to two key individuals: Li Que'wan and this Daoist Master Yehui... one had used the wonders of a Spiritual Treasure and her Dao-Profundity in shamanic arts to injure a stronger foe, outwitting the enemy's commander. The other had carried almost the entire weight of the battle—had Yehui not held the front, using the advantage of thunder and fire over wood to forcefully pin down that Great Daoist Master, Danyin would have plunged into their ranks like a tiger among sheep!

One unorthodox, one orthodox; only this combination could have broken the ferocious assault and brought the great battle to such an unexpectedly swift conclusion.

Yet the price this Daoist Master had paid was by no means small. As the golden light faded from his face, his eyes were revealed to be hollow voids, surging with black-purple mystic blood. The divine power emanating from him had also dwindled to an extreme, becoming almost imperceptible.

Evidently, the final streak of blood-gold light that had rescued Li Ximing from the encirclement had damaged his foundation and shaken his divine ability. Coupled with his earlier control of thunder and fire, drawing upon his dharma power without restraint, this 'Capital Guard' Daoist Master, always so composed, looked truly wretched for the first time.

Bai Ziyu, however, showed no change in expression. He simply drew a blue silk ribbon from his sleeve, tied it just below his brow to cover his pitch-black eyes, and then smiled.

"It's not that I'm powerful, it's that Danyin is useless—a useless man who cultivated a useless Dao is naturally useless to the core."

He always had a venomous tongue and secretly held himself in high regard. Even though he had damaged his divine ability to stop Danyin, his tone was filled with disdain for the man. Beside him, Li Ximing, having now regulated his technique, looked rather emotional as he shook his head.

"Thank you, fellow Daoist!"

In the fight just now, Yehui had truly given his all. Li Ximing had never imagined he would owe such a debt to Yehui, and his heart was a tangle of complex emotions. The Daoist Master before him simply smiled.

"Don't be in a hurry to thank me. I came with a purpose!"

Li Ximing gave an awkward smile, but Yehui observed his expression, calculating inwardly.

'The great Qilin is domineering, the little Qilin is treacherous; they might not remember a favor. Among the entire Li Clan, only this Zhaojing truly values friendship!'

Had it been Li Jiangqian in peril, he, Yehui, in those final, desperate moments, might not have been willing to injure his own divine ability just to ensure the man escaped completely unscathed. Doing his part was enough; as long as the person didn't die, who cared how badly they were injured?

He knew that the man before him had a reputation for being earnest and could be moved by acts of kindness. His own path to a solution surely lay with Li Ximing, which was why he had allowed himself to end up in such a miserable state. Having made his intentions clear, he let out a laugh, probed the Great Void, and, not seeing the woman, tactfully said,

"My injuries are quite severe, and I must hurry back to heal. I won't disturb your rest!"

"Fellow Daoist, please wait!"

Li Ximing called out to him in earnest, taking out a medicinal pill to offer him. Yehui, however, shook his head and smiled.

"I have no lack of such things... It's just that after this battle, your clan's 'Whole Pill' Daoist Master is destined to become famous across the land!"

Under the watchful eyes of so many, such an outcome was inevitable. Yehui rode the wind away, his figure drifting into the distance. Li Jiangqian frowned slightly, then mounted a cloud of fire and followed his elder toward the lake.

Once they reached a place where they were unobserved, Li Jiangqian immediately asked,

"Grand Uncle, how are your injuries?!"

Li Ximing shook his head. He reached into his sleeve and produced a small, exquisitely lifelike wooden carving. More than half of its body was shrouded in gray qi, presenting a rather tragic sight. Li Ximing coughed twice and said softly,

"With the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body assisting, it's not a serious injury... After all, Yehui bore the brunt of Danyin and Qing Jifang's combined attack. If those two had succeeded, I doubt even a fraction of my dharma body would be left!"

Once assured that Li Ximing was alright, Li Jiangqian's expression grew solemn. He lowered his voice.

"The battle just ended, and I saw Sister rush back toward the lake. I don't know if her injuries are too severe, or if something else has happened..."

"What?!"

Li Ximing's face changed. His already pale complexion became horrified. With no time for words, he took a single step and reappeared before the great purple-yellow hall of the inner formation.

Within the grand formation, where talismans had once glittered and purple light had pulsed, the ground was now covered in black water. The sound of rushing water was everywhere. A steady stream of dark liquid gushed from the cracks in the doors, flowing down the steps inch by inch until it had submerged the pavilions, creating a scene of absolute chaos!

'Li Wushao!'

Li Jiangqian descended hurriedly. Sure enough, he saw that the mystic pool within the great hall was riddled with cracks. Turbulent black water spewed endlessly from the pool's edge. The man in black who had been sitting cross-legged within now had a face the color of golden paper, and the divine power around him was extremely unstable, as if it might shatter at any moment!

And at his side, the woman stood suspended in the air, her hand forming a sword-finger that was pointed at a Spiritual Treasure interwoven with silver and red. She was using all her strength to stabilize the man's condition. The blood still lingered at the corner of her lips, and her brow was beaded with sweat.

"This is bad!"

Li Ximing understood instantly—the refinement of the Mystic Tablet Edict Pill was at a critical juncture. Although it had allowed Li Que'wan to leave and fight, it still required constant, careful nurturing. It was a rare feat for her to have been able to free her hands to fight at all; how could she have endured being injured again and again!

'Never mind the severe injuries from Qing Jifang's palm strike... that blow also shook the Spiritual Treasure connected to her split spirit, disrupting the process with Li Wushao!'

'No wonder she rushed back to the lake without a moment's rest!'
