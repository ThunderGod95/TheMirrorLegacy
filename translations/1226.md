# Chapter 1226: Reinforcements from the Manor

The Absorbing Gold's Heavenly Profound Light technique involved holding light under the tongue, using the lips and teeth as a gateway. Li Que'wan's spell art had erased her opponent's lips and teeth. A grand Dharma Art, charged to its absolute limit and ready to erupt with overwhelming power, was now sealed within his mouth—what other outcome could there possibly be?
Qing Zhuo's Dao-Profundity was extremely high, so he naturally understood this with perfect clarity.

'This is far more than a simple backlash from a failed spell!'

Since beginning his cultivation in the mortal world, he had never traversed the Great Void with such tension. He pushed his art of void-walking to its absolute limit, just barely managing to reach the man's back as the golden light in his mouth condensed to its breaking point.

As a direct descendant of the Qing clan, Qing Jifang's command of spell arts was certainly competent. Yet, to everyone's astonishment, this great Dharma Art, unleashed with the full power of a Golden Core scion, neither struck an enemy nor missed its mark—instead, it detonated right inside his own mouth.

A violent roar echoed between heaven and earth. As the desert winds churned up sand, a terrifying golden storm began to rise.

This golden light concealed an infinite vitality, its color exceptionally brilliant, like bamboo shoots bursting from the earth after a spring rain. It scoured the sky with thousands of blade-like lines, eclipsing the thunder and flames, scattering the fire clouds, and soaring straight into the firmament!

A stillness fell over the great desert.

"Pfft!"

Amidst the heaven-shaking, earth-shattering storm, Liu Changdie, who stood watching in shock from a distance, felt a sharp, cutting pain across his face. He faintly heard a low sound of someone spitting blood. Li Que'wan's face also paled as she suffered a backlash, coughing up a mouthful of golden blood!

'Is this... shamanic arts?'

In an instant, all eyes shifted to the woman's face, filled with utter shock.

'To think such a shamanic art actually exists...'

Even Yehui, who was now at a complete disadvantage yet still desperately holding back the Great Daoist Master, shifted his gaze, a peculiar light flickering in his pupils.

'Her Dao-Profundity... is by no means shallow!'

But these thoughts passed in a fleeting moment, just before a solemn, soft cry rang out from the sky.

"Settle!"

The cry rang out like a great temple bell, and the golden storm that had been rampaging wildly across the sky was instantly quelled. The aftershocks of the spell art vanished without a trace, revealing the man at its center.

It was Qing Zhuo.

The middle-aged Daoist Master wore a grave expression. One of his hands rested on Qing Jifang's shoulder while the other formed a sword-finger, pointed to his side. At his fingertip, a small, amber-colored pearl spun ceaselessly.

The pearl was no larger than a fingernail and felt as warm and smooth as jade. Its power radiated outward, enveloping the entire area. It was this very treasure that had quelled the storm of golden energy raging between heaven and earth!

But Qing Jifang, sheltered by him, remained completely motionless.

The Grand General of Shu's clothes were pristine and his posture was erect, as if he had been completely unaffected. But as one's gaze traveled upward, it became clear there was nothing above his shoulders. At his neck was only a section of pale windpipe and writhing flesh.

He looked just like a headless corpse!

Qing Zhuo was not the least bit surprised; he even let out a small sigh of relief.

Qing Jifang's injuries were far from ordinary. The Absorbing Gold's Heavenly Profound Light was not an external spell art; it had detonated from the inside out! In that single moment, Qing Jifang had endured not only the backlash from the spell art, but also the Profound Light divine ability erupting from within him!

'Losing only his head is a testament to this clan uncle's deep foundation and mastery of spell arts; it shows he was able to suppress some of the blast!'

As this scene unfolded before everyone's eyes, even Li Ximing, who had anticipated this outcome, could not help his pupils dilating in silent, pleasant surprise.

"Excellent!"

How could he allow his opponent a moment's respite? While resisting the Spiritual Treasure, he had already closed his eyes to sense the Merging Fire!

Indeed, in that brief moment, the Golden Kite Purple-Gold Alms Bowl that Qing Jifang had summoned to suppress the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire was already glowing red-hot and trembling incessantly. The divine ability at the bowl's mouth was rapidly dissipating, allowing the bright white flames to leap free.

Qing Jifang knew full well that his Golden Kite Purple-Gold Alms Bowl could not contain the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire for long and had intended to end the fight quickly. He never imagined such a turn of events, to be so brutally outmaneuvered by a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with a single divine ability!

Qing Zhuo immediately frowned and sighed to himself.

'This clan uncle is far too arrogant! The Li family is furious, so much so that they refuse to give any face to my Mount Changhuai!'

Qing Zhuo actually held no ill will toward the Li clan; in fact, he was quite supportive of this Bright Yang family for tying up Luoxia's resources, and he hoped they would stir up as much trouble as possible. But Qing Jifang's life was also a line he would not cross!

He moved two fingers forward, and the amber pearl spun ever more fiercely before stopping in front of the Merging Fire. In an instant, a suppressive force descended, freezing the Merging Fire that had been pouncing like a vicious wolf in mid-air, transforming it into a lifelike tableau.

After a full breath of time, Qing Jifang's fragile hands finally stirred. His little finger rose to touch his thumb, and a halo of divine ability immediately began to shimmer.

Divine Life Invocation.

In the blink of an eye, the man's figure dissolved into a gust of gray wind that soared into the sky. Clouds roiled overhead, radiating a baleful aura. Countless golden threads wove together, finally coalescing into a massive Dharma Body clad in armor and robes!

The Dharma Body shimmered with a brilliant golden light, as if woven from countless golden threads. It was as large as a mountain and had completely detached from his original physical form, bringing his chaotic dharma power back into order. Only now did Qing Jifang finally recover, his pupils blazing with boundless fury and shock, his very divine ability and dharma power trembling within the Great Void!

Years ago, when he had fought Li Zhouwei, even when he had suffered a disadvantage, he had concealed it so that no one would see. Even so, the memory had lingered with him for many years.

'Li Zhouwei is a White Qilin... a man on the verge of death. Let him have his moment of glory. But a mere nobody... dares to plot against me...'

When had he, Qing Jifang, ever suffered such a loss or been so utterly humiliated!

He soared into the air, but Qing Zhuo remained in place, his gaze locked upon him, seemingly on the verge of speaking but holding back. Finally, he shook his head with a sigh and stepped into the Great Void.

All that remained in his original position was the small, spinning amber pearl.

His heart ablaze with malevolent fire, Qing Jifang took the pearl in one hand and strode forward. The rope that had been suppressing Li Ximing also sprang to life, slithering recklessly toward Li Que'wan!

Seeing that Li Que'wan was injured, Liu Changdie could hardly ignore it. The colors of the divine ability he had been gathering in his hand for some time swirled together, forming a silver, disc-like pattern. He did not move to intercept the speeding Spiritual Treasure, but instead gently raised his hand and touched Li Que'wan.

In an instant, Li Que'wan's aura vanished from the Great Void. A brilliant gate opened in the sky, sealing away the descending gray energy. Understanding at once, she crossed two fingers before her as a bright moon lit up in each of her pupils!

Profound Bestowal Glazed Talisman.

The wonders of the Supreme Yin responded, allowing her to evade the targeting locks of various Spiritual Treasures. Like a single drop of fresh water merging into the ocean, Li Que'wan's figure instantly vanished from the desert.

Li Ximing, on the other hand, having just escaped from beneath the Spiritual Treasure, was in no rush to rescue his junior. Instead, he formed a hand seal and began to cast a spell. Strands of crimson light coiled between his fingers, coalescing into a golden radiance covered in runes. It was the Great Parting Golden Radiance!

He made no attempt to conceal his actions; his intent was to force Qing Jifang to intervene and interrupt him!

His injuries not yet healed and his Spiritual Treasure having missed its mark, Qing Jifang's heart was shrouded in gloom. His spiritual sense trembled as he transmitted a message via divine ability, his voice filled with shock and fury.

"Danyin!"

The word struck the ears of the Great Daoist Master manipulating a divine ability in the sky like a bolt of lightning. A shadow fell over the eyes of this pillar of the Sun clan; he understood it was a warning from Qing Jifang!

'In his eyes, the fact that I've been stalled for so long by a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, unable to provide any reinforcement or even assist from a distance, must seem like extreme negligence!'

If he failed to provide aid now, he would surely earn his enmity.

But the frustration in Danyin's own heart was no less palpable.

'Besides, who could have imagined... that this Yehui had hidden his true strength so well!'

Danyin and Yehui had a history. To be precise, a junior of the Sun clan, Daoist Master Shen Sou, had once fought fiercely with Yehui over a spiritual item in the Eastern Sea when he possessed only a single divine ability. Danyin had intervened to assist, forcing Yehui to retreat.

At the time, Danyin had been quite scornful.

'The Capital Guard's legacy in Ancient Merging is incomplete. Its rogue cultivators are scattered across the world, and to this day, few of its Dao lineages have ever produced someone with a divine ability. What future could they possibly have!'

Yet it was this very Daoist Master from an incomplete Dao lineage who had dealt him a heavy blow right as he broke through to the rank of Great Daoist Master, when his divine abilities were at their lifetime peak. In the very first exchange, Danyin had even been put at a disadvantage. Qing Jifang may have lost face, but did that make him, Danyin, look any better?

His Gathering Wood Dao lineage excelled at defense and containment; even if outmatched in strength, he could temporarily stall an enemy. It was not the Upright Wood lineage, which possessed the advantage of swift conclusions. Facing an opponent with thunder and fire, he was fighting with a heart full of frustration!

As he brought his four divine abilities to bear at once, the Capital Guard Daoist Master had already fallen to a disadvantage and was being firmly suppressed. With just a little more time, Danyin was confident he could inflict a grievous wound. But when Qing Jifang's command arrived, he had no choice but to abandon his hard-won advantage and soar up to provide aid.

Gathering of Bitter Herbs!

His target was Li Ximing!

There was no other reason. Although Danyin did not recognize Liu Changdie, he did recognize the legendary Vault Metal Dao, and the man also wielded a Spiritual Treasure. Who knew what power this middle-aged man who had come to provide aid had behind him?

'Better to target Li Ximing. I've already offended him, and at least I know what I'm dealing with!'

The divine ability responded with extreme speed as a jade-green ocean spread out once more, a carpet of myriad grasses and trees radiating a powerful intent of confinement and sealing. Li Ximing had already been tricked once and knew he could not meet this divine ability head-on. He took a single step, and a fiery light flashed beneath his feet.

Tread on Flames!

Li Ximing had only just grasped the basics of this Li Fire technique in his early years. Since then, he had spent his time either refining pills or practicing other arts and had not progressed much further. However, it was ultimately enhanced by his fire-control arts, and given that Li Fire incinerates wood and Danyin had acted in haste, he was able to break free instantly!

But his opponent was a Great Daoist Master, after all. He braced himself as if facing a formidable foe, the threatening spell art in his hand immediately dissipating. Sure enough, the ghostly figure, arriving via a divine ability, appeared right before him.

Falcon's Roost.

Off to the side, Qing Jifang had lost track of Li Que'wan. His sword-like gaze swept over Liu Changdie. The Spiritual Treasure, having failed to catch Li Que'wan, immediately moved to suppress the closer Liu Changdie, while he himself rushed toward Li Ximing in the very next instant.

Luminous Dredging!

The golden threads were much dimmer than before as they descended from the sky toward Li Ximing. His figure transformed into a gray wind, sweeping forward.

With a Great Daoist Master and a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm direct descendant attacking in concert, Li Ximing felt a chill run up his spine. The sense of crisis was immense. Pushing his World's Radiance to its limit, he successfully blocked the already-weakened Luminous Dredging. Without hesitation, he activated the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass for a second time!

The stars in the sky suddenly shattered as his figure shifted dozens of feet to the side. As he regained his footing, waves of light from Shichuan pulsed outward to repel his enemies. At the same time, he unhesitatingly snatched up the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire and held it before him.

"嗡!"

As expected, a dark light flashed, aiming straight for his eyes. Burned by the Merging Fire and resisted by the light of the Supreme Yang Responding-to-Li, it finally dissipated. The aftershock still struck his face with a searing pain, as if he had been burned by fire, and thick white smoke rose from his skin.

It was Danyin.

Li Ximing was now a battle-hardened veteran. Having seen his Falcon's Roost before, he understood his opponent's uncanny ability to appear where he was about to land, like a hunter waiting for its prey. He would not fall for that again!

Just as he disengaged and caught a breath, Yehui was already closing in from a distance to assist. Without pausing, he caused a mountain to fall from the Great Void, suppressing the white jade fan that was about to descend on Li Ximing's head. With his other hand, he pinched two talismans of thunder and fire, summoning a profound light that fell upon Li Ximing. A voice transmitted via divine ability barked a sharp command.

"Brother Zhaojing!"

Both men knew this was the most dangerous moment; a single misstep could be fatal. Li Ximing immediately relaxed his body and mind. He felt himself enveloped by purple water and supported by white qi, shifting him several feet and allowing him to narrowly avoid the glow of the amber pearl. Only the Qingchi ruler was not quick enough and was fixed in place by the marvelous Spiritual Treasure!

Elsewhere, the Heavenly Nurture Urn hung high in the air, swallowing all the gray wind descending from above.

But Li Ximing felt not a shred of triumph. The Great Daoist Master's face had already appeared, the light between his brows condensed to its peak, staring straight at Li Ximing, making his hair stand on end with a sense of infinite peril!

Though Yehui was a cunning man, he had made a promise and was now giving his all. His face grew cold and hard. The golden light in his eyes exploded, erupting with a blood-red hue that held the Great Daoist Master, who was unleashing his divine ability to its fullest, frozen in place. His divine ability continued to push Li Ximing back, protecting him, his eyes grim and icy.

'The person I, Bai Ziyu, want to protect—you think a piece of trash like you can touch him!'

The hand he had been preparing behind his back swung forward, shining with an earthy yellow light.

Three Abodes.

The iridescent light surged forth, aimed entirely at the Great Daoist Master's eyes. Danyin, unable to move, was struck squarely. But his Gathering Wood divine ability responded, causing his eyes to dissolve. From the empty sockets, a new pair grew, completely unharmed.

Yehui, however, was only using the move to stall for time, his own heart filled with a sense of extreme danger. Qing Jifang was already descending from the sky with boundless rage! He had abandoned Li Ximing. The amber pearl in his hand spun, not only immobilizing Yehui but also flying toward his temple!

'It's the Heavenly Amber Heart-Sacrifice Pearl! I can't let it hit me! If I'm struck by this, it will be a fatal disaster!'

He wrenched his head aside, trying to avoid the critical temple point. At the same time, he urgently recalled his Spiritual Treasure for aid. Just at this critical moment, a swath of purple lightning appeared in the sky. A thunder mace fell from above, while a silver point materialized in front of Qing Jifang. A beautiful face regarded him with an icy expression.

Awaiting the Supreme Divine!

The Divine Corpse appeared, shaking heaven and earth!

'I've been waiting for you!'

A surging killing intent erupted from Qing Jifang's golden-threaded Dharma Body. Although he was held in place by the divine ability, a single golden thread suddenly descended upon the woman's head, connecting her to the sky and locking her in place. Above the clouds, his headless physical body appeared, the divine ability in its hands, which had been charging for some time, suddenly flared!

He, Qing Jifang, had been waiting for this moment!

Li Que'wan felt all the divine ability and dharma power in her body surge toward the top of her head. For a moment, she could not move. Her expression was cold, and she raised a hand as if in a futile last stand, seemingly resigned to her fate. But inside, her heart was a sea of calm.

A white-haired figure suddenly appeared before her, blocking the path of the divine ability. A wrinkled hand grasped the hilt of the sword at his waist and drew a longsword that carried the roar of surging waves.

Daoist Master Yushui, Chen Yin!

The old man's face was fierce, his gaze fixed on the figure in the sky with utter hatred. His divine ability was already operating at its peak, and a torrent of Mansion Water poured forth, coalescing before him into a vast, seemingly solid abyss of water.

This sword cultivator, who had attained the Dao many years ago, radiated a grim killing intent and loathing. The spiritual sword in his hand shone with a brilliant light tinged with blood. One sword became a hundred, and a hundred became a thousand. The countless streams of sword qi that erupted were like a tidal wave, actually severing the Earth Virtue divine ability that was descending from the heavens.

'The Hundred-Light Fractal Sword Art!'
