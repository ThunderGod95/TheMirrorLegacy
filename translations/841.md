# Chapter 841: The Great Rat

Qu Bushi hurried forward, his voice respectful.

"Reporting to the Family Head, it was indeed Guan Lingdie. The Capital immortals Dao sent her to the Eastern Sea. As for the Capital immortals Dao itself… they've been shuffling their personnel quite aggressively, replacing several cultivators stationed near the borders of Baijiang Creek."

"Guan Gongxiao still dotes on his sister," Li Jiangqian mused, nodding to himself. It was understandable. Though opportunities abounded at a True Monarch's side, if he were in Guan Gongxiao's shoes, he wouldn't have been willing to send Li Que'wan either, even if she hadn't already entered seclusion for her breakthrough.

'A personnel shuffle… Don't tell me that Guan fellow scoured his entire sect and sent every female cultivator he could find? Knowing Guan Gongxiao's personality, it's not out of the question…'

When it came to matters surrounding a True Monarch, female cultivators were always more convenient than males. Over the past few years, Li Jiangqian had already been gradually replacing the cultivators stationed on the northern shore with members of the Fei family and women, just to prevent any unforeseen incidents.

Qu Bushi lowered his head slightly and continued, "The two families have been in a standoff for several months, with skirmishes beginning to break out. Many great families and demonic cultivators have come to spy. One of them, a fellow with rather paltry skills, was spotted at a glance by Lord Cui on the river and captured."

"He has been taken to a side hall, awaiting your judgment, my lord…"

This was no surprise to Li Jiangqian. "I am aware," he replied calmly. "He's one of the Hall of the Locust Soul's people. Protector Cui already sent a message. I will question him myself."

A chill crept into his smile. "They have some nerve. Not just on the river—demonic cultivators have been spotted snooping around our northern shore as well. Give them an inch and they take a mile. A mere Foundation Establishment Realm demonic cultivator, gathering some rabble, dares to spy on my family's mountain gate…"

'If it weren't for more pressing matters…' he thought coldly, 'I'd dispatch a protector to fetch his head!'

A shiver went down Qu Bushi's spine. He hadn't expected the faction across the river would dare to spy so openly. That old Daoist Bai had clearly underestimated the reach of a Purple Mansion Realm power and overestimated his own sect's ability to keep secrets. The old man could only bow his head in silence.

Most of the clan's Foundation Establishment cultivators had been sent to the river, and Li Jiangqian once again felt he was short on manpower, especially those from the direct lineage.

Li Jianglong had returned from the north and was now in seclusion. Having reached the eighth level of Qi Refining, he could attempt his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm after consuming the Talisman Pill and the Three Perfection Breakthrough Pill. Jiangxia was a bit faster, but not by much.

As for the rest of the Li family, a new generation of cultivators—Fei Qing'yi, An Xuantong, and even Li Zhoufang, Li Zhouyang, and Li Xinghan—was gradually reaching the later stages of Qi Refining. Li Jiangqian made a quick mental calculation.

'In about ten years, our family will see its peak number of Foundation Establishment cultivators. It won't even be a problem to have one for each mountain peak… We will truly become a behemoth, just like the Xiao family of old…'

As the two were discussing matters of the north, a cultivator approached from the side, drew a small letter from his sleeve, and presented it. Li Jiangqian's expression turned peculiar as he read it.

His gaze swept over the heavy rain outside the window. He dismissed Qu Bushi, then turned and walked back into the hall, sending someone to summon Li Xuanxuan and Li Minggong.

The old man arrived quickly, riding the wind. He moved with haste, yet his face was wreathed in smiles, as if he had heard good news. Li Minggong, however, was nowhere to be seen, likely at a critical juncture in her cultivation of spell arts. The current conflict with the Capital immortals Dao wasn't a full-blown war, and they had enough people. Moreover, Cui Jueyin was in charge and knew the secrets behind the situation, so he was more than capable of handling things. Thus, they let Li Minggong focus on her training.

Li Xuanxuan took the letter from Li Jiangqian. As he read, Li Jiangqian poured a cup of tea for the elder.

"Daoist Master Qiuhu fought in the Southern Sea… and was forced to retreat by Maha. Beidan is lost…"

Whenever Li Xuanxuan came to the main hall, Li Jiangqian would personally pour his tea, always at the perfect temperature. It was just the man’s way, making others feel at ease in his presence. Li Xuanxuan quietly accepted the cup with a smile.

"It's rare to get news of Li Xizhi… This is a good thing… A family of sword immortals should have a sword cultivator, after all."

The letter had evidently mentioned Li Xizhi drawing his sword, but Li Xuanxuan's smile was strained. Li Jiangqian's frown deepened. He set down the teapot and lowered his voice.

"Something is very wrong with this. It's been wrong from the start. Tell me, this Zhuzhen Merciful One… why would he suddenly take Shitang? Was it necessary for the Great Konghai Temple? Even if we assume there's some secret we low-level cultivators don't understand… why would he take Shitang without harming a single cultivator from the Azure Pond?"

"Daoist Master Qiuhu was clearly stationed to guard the north. How could she appear at Shitang in a flash? Not even traversing the Great Void is that fast, unless the Daoist Master possesses supreme wisdom and knew about it long in advance."

"Furthermore, after the Zhuzhen suffered such a humiliation, it wouldn't have been excessive for him to strike someone down in anger…"

Li Xuanxuan had been worried that Li Xizhi was drawing too much attention, but he hadn't considered Li Jiangqian's line of reasoning. Hearing it now, he asked, "What are you implying?"

Li Jiangqian's expression was unreadable. "I received news some time ago that the Lotus Temple also ceded territory to the Chengyun Gate."

As Li Xuanxuan pondered this, the pieces seemed to fit. Li Jiangqian continued in a low voice, "They are both leaders of the Immortal Dao, after all… They shouldn't be on such friendly terms with Buddhist cultivators…"

The old man understood his meaning, but it was hard to say whether the Azure Pond had deliberately given up Beidan as part of a secret trade, or if they were secretly colluding with the Great Konghai Temple on some grander scheme.

Li Jiangqian glanced at him. "The one who suffers most is the Lingu Family."

The old man stroked his beard and nodded.

As Li Jiangqian saw it, with Ning Wan supporting the Azure Pond alone, it was understandable that she would trade Beidan for some form of aid. And what kind of place was Shitang? The Lingu Family had been operating there for years, using the Wu Oakworm and Ginseng-Timber Wood to bleed it dry day by day. Ning Wan couldn't possibly have been unaware. There was also a marketplace there that benefited the Ning and Si families, but with Yuanxiu's death, that market was doomed to fail.

Seeing the old man remain silent, Li Jiangqian whispered, "Daoist Master Ning should still be in the Southern Sea."

Li Jiangqian was not one for idle speculation; he was hinting to the old man that he had already used the Immortal Mirror to check. Li Xuanxuan's face filled with worry. "I just fear… that things are not stable for Xizhi."

This was precisely what unsettled Li Jiangqian. "Who would reveal their true strength for no reason when they could keep it hidden?" he said softly. "Stepping into the limelight is never a safe path. It seems like he's earned everyone's praise, but with his status, does he really need such accolades? From start to finish, there's no benefit for him in this, only for the Azure Pond."

"I don't believe Daoist Master Ning is the type to push Xizhi forward for her own gain," the old man countered. "She is not like Yuanxiu, and the Li family is not what it once was… And don't forget… he is Zhaojing's brother."

'Once you reach the Purple Mansion Realm and attain a Life Divine Ability, your heart changes, no matter who you are.'

Li Jiangqian could only nod silently. Though he thought otherwise, it was not the time to say more. "In any case, this doesn't bode well. Daoist Master Ning is the most powerful figure involved. It would be best for you, my lord, to meet with her on the lake. There should be no obstacles."

Li Xuanxuan nodded grimly, then changed the subject. "I've heard about the matter with the Hall of the Locust Soul. Do not be rash…"

Li Jiangqian smiled. "You underestimate me, old master."

Li Xuanxuan said no more, but his heart was heavy with concern.

'If it weren't for Daoist Bai, and if our family wasn't in Jiangbei, we would have found it difficult to escape this entanglement. This Li family rules their domain with an iron fist, commanding factions from afar, their background profound. They are all so-called young masters of a great family, and the one governing them is a cunning youth in black and crimson robes, a golden-eyed scion with great ambitions who will stop at nothing… This young man's father was a peerless talent among Foundation Establishment cultivators, and above him is an ancestor, a Daoist Master whose whereabouts are unknown…'

'They're the protagonists of this drama, while we are just clowns on the side! If my family were in Jiangbei, we would have already packed up and fled overseas by now.'

He left without another word to write his letter. Li Jiangqian set down his brush, only to see a young man in a red robe approaching the hall from outside, a folding fan in his hand. It was his uncle, Zhouming.

Li Jiangqian smiled. "Uncle, you seem to be in a leisurely mood today, to have time to visit me."

Zhouming, a blissful newlywed, had lost his usual debonair flair. His face was a mask of misery as he shook his head. "These past few months… I haven't been able to visit a single pleasure barge. I don't know how Shouyu gets her information, but every time I slip away, she shows up moments later. She doesn't say a word, just sits there smiling and watching…"

"I break out in a cold sweat every time. And those poor girls? They usually end up kneeling on the floor, weeping…"

Li Jiangqian was well aware of his uncle's recent antics and stifled a laugh. The red-robed man before him shook his head again. "I thought I could get a breath of fresh air on a trip to the Azure Pond, see the sights, but I was called back as soon as I arrived. I didn't even get to see anything…"

He sighed. "In this rainy season, there's nothing more relaxing than drifting on the lake in a boat and watching the rain. But I have no heart for it anymore. I came here to hide."

Zhouming loathed tedious duties more than anyone. To be driven to seek out work in the main hall showed just how desperate he was. Li Jiangqian clicked his tongue and offered some comfort. "Aunt is from a prestigious family, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, a first-rate figure… If you put in more effort, Uncle, a happy marriage is the best thing you could ask for…"

At the mention of this, Zhouming's face paled slightly, and he sighed. "She's a direct disciple of an immortal sect, very capable… You should find something for her to do… A dignified Foundation Establishment cultivator, tormenting me day in and day out? I can't take it anymore…"

Li Jiangqian understood at once. He smiled inwardly but put on a thoughtful expression.

'He has a point. A woman of her standing, the wife of a Purple Mansion Realm direct descendant, should have a position. It's only proper.'

He had been so busy lately that he had overlooked the matter. "What you say is reasonable, Uncle. I recall that Aunt cultivates the Blazing Fire. Coincidentally, the clan is re-establishing the Qi-gathering division, to be called the 'Furnace Tribute Division.' We will have to trouble her to lead it!"

The Li family's Qi-gathering branch possessed a treasure, an ancient artifact called Stray Fragrance that Li Xuanfeng had acquired. It was originally from the Si Family and could store spiritual qi without letting it dissipate. His words implied that Xia Shouyu would now be in charge of it.

Spiritual qi was always a finite resource, making this no easy job. The one in charge needed not only status but also cunning. Li Jiangqian's arrangement was perfect. Zhouming didn't grasp all the subtleties, but he nodded repeatedly. "My thanks, Family Head. There is one other matter… My brother Zhoufang's eldest son, Li Jiangzong, has broken through to the Qi Refining realm. He cultivates the Pheasant Fire March Art from the True Fire lineage. My brother dotes on him and hopes he can study under our aunt, Li Minggong. If you could put in a good word for him…"

Li Zhoufang had been blessed with many children. First there was Li Queyi cultivating at Purple Smoke, and now there was Li Jiangzong. All of them were quite promising. With Li Xinghan from the Yuandu branch as well, their lineage had become the most prominent of the main branch.

Li Jiangqian naturally agreed. A new, promising member of the direct line was a good thing. Although Li Minggong was from the Yuanwan Branch, she held no such sectarian prejudices and would surely be delighted. He smiled and asked, "How old is this young cousin of mine?"

Zhouming snapped open his fan. "Twenty-three, a little younger than Queyi."

Just as he finished speaking, a figure appeared outside the hall. It was Li Minggong, dressed in a white gown, the lantern in her hand unlit—a stark contrast to her usual attire.

Li Jiangqian then remembered that today was the anniversary of Li Chenghui's death. She must have been paying her respects, which was why the person sent to summon her couldn't get through to her manor.

Affection fades when one is gone. For the first two years, the anniversary rituals had been grand affairs, but now, few people still remembered Li Chenghui. Only the three clan members who stood to inherit his legacy made a lively show of it every year, organizing ceremonies more splendid than those for their own ancestors. Whether their sentiment was false or genuine, Li Chenghui had left no children, and at least someone was there to manage his affairs.

Li Jiangqian's black robe was appropriate enough, but Zhouming was still clad in bright red. He wasn't a bad person, just utterly thoughtless. He had barely met Li Chenghui a few times in his life, and even seeing his aunt in mourning white didn't seem to register, which made Li Jiangqian cringe.

Fortunately, Li Minggong wasn't one to fuss over such things. "I've recently mastered the Art of Wondrous Transformations," she said gently. "It was a congratulatory gift from the Slaughter Jun Gate to the Daoist Master back then. The art is highly compatible with my immortal foundation, and that pocket of purple baleful qi on Gardenia Scenery Mountain was a wondrous aid in my training… Its potential is immense."

"You cultivate the Li Fire, which is even more compatible than my True Fire. You should give it a try. There's more to this art than meets the eye."

The Slaughter Jun Gate's Art of Wondrous Transformations was a method of consuming Li Fire and Baleful Earth to exhale Earth Fire Baleful Qi. It was quite difficult to cultivate. Li Minggong's expression was one of pleasant surprise, having mastered it with the aid of the purple baleful qi.

If it could excite Li Minggong, who cultivated True Fire, it would surely be even more effective for him with his Li Fire. Li Jiangqian's interest was piqued. He nodded eagerly and sighed. "Nothing from that Daoist Master Junjian is ever subpar… And he has such good relations with our family, the things he gives us are bound to be better than what he gives others… Have you had a look at the juniors in the family, my lady?"

Li Minggong moved to take a seat. "I was just about to speak with you about that. I've seen Jiangzong. He is modest and eager to learn. While one might not call his temperament exceptional, his magnanimity already surpasses most."

Hearing this, it was clear the boy was quite promising. Not even his father, Li Zhoufang, had received such praise, and Li Zhouluo had only been described as "talented." Li Jiangqian looked up slightly, breathing a sigh of relief.

'Among the Jiang and Que generation, aside from my own younger brothers, we finally have someone presentable!'

He now understood Li Xuanxuan's joyful expression when he had arrived. The old man cared most about such matters and must have known early on. Li Jiangqian sighed. "The lack of promising successors has been a constant worry for the old master and the other elders. Having a talented one at last should ease their minds and quench their thirst."

Among the Zhou and Xing generation, only Li Xinghan could be considered prominent. In the Jiang and Que generation, besides the golden-eyed children, Queyi and Quexi were at Purple Smoke, leaving only Que'wan on the lake, and her cultivation was so rapid she had no time for thoughts of offspring.

Zhouming finally seemed to grasp the situation. He asked a few questions about family affairs, careful not to mention the abandoned Funan. "I hear there's been some fighting on the river," he said. "Our cultivators have clashed with those from the Capital immortals Dao, and we've captured a demonic cultivator. Which faction is he from?"

Li Jiangqian shook his head. "Let's bring him up for the elders to see."

He gave a quiet order, and Qu Bushi entered from outside the hall, dragging a young-looking demonic cultivator. The man's hands were bound tight, his cultivation sealed. His face was pale, and he was drenched in a cold sweat.

Zhouming looked at the man, but the youth was unable to speak. Li Jiangqian said with a thin smile, "My family is in a major conflict with the Capital immortals Dao, and this fellow was spying from the sidelines. Lord Cui's ocular arts are formidable; he plucked him right out."

He held up the letter from Cui Jueyin, read from it, and then passed it to Zhouming and Li Minggong. "He's already been interrogated. He's from the Hall of the Locust Soul. The Secret Diffusion Dao lineage has a long history, so he has some backing."

He turned his head, his voice turning sharp. "Your name! Your position!"

The young man immediately dropped to his knees. "This lowly one… this lowly one is a protector under the Hall of the Locust Soul, called Protector Black Rat. I am one of the seven protectors before the main hall, in charge of taxes on spiritual items in the Funan area, and I also manage a storehouse…"

"The Hall Master was unsure what was happening on the river and specifically sent me to investigate. I had no intention of spying, I swear! Please, my lords, see the truth!"

Zhouming, unaware of the underlying situation, reacted genuinely. He smacked his fan into his palm, clearly displeased. "Is there truly such a thing as owing a favor to a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator? But he only has a favor, while our family truly *has* a Purple Mansion Realm expert. We can't let them bully us as they please…"

Li Jiangqian sighed dramatically. "Uncle, you don't understand. This Secret Diffusion Dao lineage is no simple matter. The Purple Mansion Realm faction behind them has deep roots, possibly even tracing back to a True Monarch… The family must avoid this conflict at all costs!"

Zhouming was taken aback. This gave him a much better understanding of why they had lost Funan. He shot to his feet. "What should we do then?" he stammered. "Should we… release him?"

"No…"

Li Jiangqian made no attempt to hide his intentions from the kneeling demonic cultivator. His eyes, light and sharp, flickered across his uncle, and he changed his words mid-sentence. He laughed in fury. "But we cannot be bullied like this either. I will kill him and make the other side taste some pain."

As the words left his lips, a sense of unease washed over him. He saw Zhouming jump to his feet, a look of shock and terror on his face. "You can't kill him! If there's a True Monarch involved…"

Even Qu Bushi was stunned and quickly pleaded, "My lord, I'm afraid you can't kill him…"

Li Minggong, too, frowned slightly, clearly disagreeing. She was mindful of his position and remained silent, but if he persisted, she would likely speak up as well.

Li Jiangqian surveyed the room with amusement, his feigned anger subsiding slightly. "He may have received a token, but that doesn't mean his entire lineage has it! Just because of one token, everyone wants to put him on a pedestal?"

The two men resumed their persuasion. After a long while, Li Jiangqian finally relented.

"Fine, I won't kill him, but he can't just come and go as he pleases. Take him down and let him taste some suffering first."

Zhouming let out a long breath. Before Li Jiangqian could change his mind again, he hurriedly had Qu Bushi take the man away. Li Jiangqian simply raised an eyebrow, taking it all in, a realization dawning in his mind.

'Protector Black Rat… an important figure. Good, very good.'

Qu Bushi hadn't left yet. He paused to ask for instructions. "Where should he be imprisoned?"

An idea immediately formed in Li Jiangqian's mind—it was time to make use of the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda on the lake.

The Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda was a gift from Li Xizhi years ago. It was extremely valuable and had been kept in Qingdu, intended as an artifact for training the younger generation and punishing disciples. Yet, it had seen little use over the years.

Firstly, just after they acquired it, Li Jiangqian had come out of seclusion to reorganize the family's affairs. The entire Li clan was incredibly busy, so no one had the time to figure it out.

Secondly… its power was simply too unbalanced. Forget the Li family disciples, even Chen Yang had entered it once and came out covered in soot. After braving the Supreme He Fire, he found the Crop-Injuring Wind in the middle to be pitifully weak, while the final Autumn-Perishing Water was overwhelmingly powerful. Among the many cultivators of the Li family, only Cui Jueyin and Ding Weizeng could complete the full trial.

The benefits gained were not that significant either. For cultivators of Cui Jueyin's and Ding Weizeng's level, refining their true essence or clearing their spiritual sense was of little use. As for Qi Refining cultivators, they had no hope of withstanding the Supreme He Fire.

'It's an ancient artifact, after all. With the changes to Fruition Attainment, everything is different now. It's not very practical.' he thought. 'But the artifact is controllable. Unless the Northern Palace Thunder at the very top is activated, it won't be fatal. No wonder they said it was for punishing disciples; that's its best use.'

"This fellow is weak," he said coldly. "Send him into the Crop-Injuring Wind. Let him have a taste of suffering!"

The Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda wouldn't kill, but it would inflict continuous torment, enough to leave an indelible mark on the man's mind. As Qu Bushi dragged him away, Zhouming returned to his seat to discuss some family matters before taking his leave.

Li Jiangqian sat quietly in the main seat, a chill spreading through his heart.

'It's already begun… Black Rat's capture wasn't an accident. No wonder it was so sloppy… Now we'll see if the Hall of the Locust Soul wants him back. If they really send someone to retrieve him, he must play a significant role.'

The True Monarch was prophesied to descend within six years, which meant it couldn't be an infant. The descent would be into a host who had long felt the connection, or a reincarnation whose destiny had only recently awakened… in which case there probably wouldn't be any grand omens.

'He's been captured for some time now. News from the north should arrive soon.'

Li Minggong had watched the entire performance without a word. Seeing Li Jiangqian lost in thought, she spoke up, her brow furrowed. "From his description, this man seems extremely important to the Hall of the Locust Soul. They will send someone to ransom him."

Li Jiangqian sighed internally. It seemed Li Minggong also had her suspicions. He remained silent on the matter and simply said, "I'll go see for myself."

The woman departed on a trail of fire. Li Jiangqian waited, trying to read through some scrolls. After a while, he grew agitated, unable to distinguish which thoughts were truly his own. He strode outside and leaned against the corridor railing once more, sighing as he gazed out at the ceaseless storm over Jiangbei.

"This great rain… the blood of the great families and the Hall of the Locust Soul… It would be best if none of it splashes onto my family."
