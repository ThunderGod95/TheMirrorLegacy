# Chapter 1097: The Crimson Desert

Tao Jiexing rode the wind from Xuanmiao Temple, his heart heavy with an indescribable burden.

'From the look of him, Lord Wei has failed to cultivate it.'

Though Tao Jiexing was new to the world, he had achieved the Dao at a young age and was exceptionally clever. He had been lured out by Qi Lanyan on borrowed time two months ago and still hadn't been able to return. He already had his suspicions, and that single sentence confirmed them, leaving him somewhat dazed.

'Failure to cultivate... failure to cultivate _is_ success.'

The Tao family had deep ties to Profound Governance and was, in ancient times, a great clan that practiced the Three Yin. When his great-grandfather had cultivated the Dao and achieved the Unblemished Robe, it was a glorious affair that drew cultivators from half of Zhao State to offer congratulations.

And yet, when the old man returned to the family in private... he was lost and despondent, weeping without end.

'The old man said... the Veiled Yin was purged by the Lesser Yang, condemned as demonic disciples. Now those same powers hang high in the sky, ordering Profound Governance to enter the mortal world and wear the purple robe on their behalf. How can the Unblemished Robe possibly be achieved under such circumstances? To _fail_ is to walk the true path. His "success" in cultivating the Unblemished Robe meant he had merely hidden the purple robe beneath a white one, turning it into a Robe of Concealed Flaws.'

Tao Jiexing understood. For Wei Xuanyin to _fail_ to cultivate it now... was actually a terrifying and extremely dangerous situation.

'This Lord Wei... he sits at the pinnacle of the Profound Governance Pavilion. With Profound Governance intervening so completely in the Immortal Dao, manipulating the state of the entire world, achieving the Robe of Concealed Flaws should be an inevitability. Yet he remains aloof from it... Setting aside what kind of Dao-Profundity this requires... Lord Yao couldn't possibly be ignorant of the mechanisms at play. To appoint him to Profound Governance nonetheless... the meaning is painfully clear.'

'His ambition will likely prove a great trouble for the mountain.'

From Tao Jiexing's perspective, Mount Luoxia was actually quite tolerant. Otherwise, Wei Xuanyin would never have been allowed to reach his current cultivation as a Great Daoist Master. But what the mountain _truly_ thought... who would dare to guess?

Lost in his thoughts, Tao Jiexing found he had already arrived at a hazy, gray mountain forest. Peaks and valleys undulated in the night, and rows of gray-white banners snapped in the wind. This was the White Ye Immortal Sect.

This was Yehui's mountain gate. It was an inconspicuous player in the conflict between North and South, but it was nonetheless protected by a Purple Mansion Realm grand array. Tao Jiexing gave the dark forest a deep look before riding the wind down.

In stark contrast to the pitch-black desolation outside, the array's interior blazed with limitless radiance. The ground was golden, and the layers of palaces were nearly devoid of cultivators in Daoist robes. Instead, they were packed with a dense swarm of monks.

High in the main hall, two Mahas sat cross-legged, having shrunk to the size of ordinary men. Their golden bodies shone brilliantly, filling the hall with the sound of Sanskrit chants. Only one man, dressed in a feathered robe, sat off to the side, his eyes closed in silence.

The tiny White Ye Immortal Sect was practically bursting with Buddhist cultivators!

Not only were the Mahas Vast Cicada and Maha Nuzi presiding, but below them, Nuyan, Xuwang, Luejin, and others of the Golden Lotus Seat were arrayed. Master Monks and lesser disciples stood in sequence, and off to the side, silent and stern, was the Touba family's own Daoist Master, Touba Ci.

This was the strategy Yehui had presented to Qi Lanyan.

The White Ye Immortal Sect lay just across the Wilderness. Its territory was vast, and to the northwest lay Baixiang Valley, a perfect springboard for attacking Mount Bianyan and relieving the pressure on Tangdao Mountain. This was, in fact, the very same strategy Great Song was employing.

However, Qi Lanyan had calculated that the Great Song cultivators would be too desperate to send reinforcements to attack the White Ye Immortal Sect's mountain gate directly before first repelling the Northern forces. They would surely bypass it and head for Baixiang. During the last several engagements, he had secretly used the Touba family's demonic arts to smuggle Buddhist cultivators into the sect's mountain gate. Bit by bit, he had amassed a significant force, having long since hidden Vast Cicada and the others here.

The seemingly isolated, helpless, and tottering Capital immortals Dao mountain gate, apparently abandoned by its Daoist Masters, was in fact hiding a surprise army!

With this arrangement, if Liu Bai and his contingent stopped to assault the White Ye Immortal Sect, they would be bogged down in a protracted siege, allowing the North to encircle them. But now, with Liu Bai and the others racing north to provide aid, this hidden army could pour out at any moment, sever their line of retreat, and seize a massive advantage.

Helian Wujiang, Helian Wumeng, and the others were all just bait. The only person who knew the full extent of the plan was Yehui himself.

This band of monks had been waiting here for a long time and were growing restless. Seeing Tao Jiexing, they were overjoyed. Vast Cicada, who sat at the very head, immediately leaped down and grinned.

"Cousin... is it done?"

To avoid detection by the South, they hadn't even linked the grand arrays, instead using the Purple Mansion Realm array to sever all connection to the Great Void. They were completely in the dark. Tao Jiexing quickly clasped his hands in respect and replied,

"It is—they've gone north!"

In an instant, delight spread across their faces. The man in white robes sitting to the side opened his eyes, a hint of a smile in his gaze.

"In that case, why not strike south immediately!"

His meaning was obvious: take this chance to cross the Wilderness and strike directly into the heartland of Great Song.

But this casual suggestion, clearly a jest, made everyone's expression flicker. Not a single one dared to respond. Touba Ci, standing to the side with his hands clasped behind his back, laughed inwardly.

'This entire group is here to scavenge for destiny, not to throw their lives away. Who would follow you into the Great Song heartland? Profound Governance gave no such order, and deeply offending the Underworld... is that a death wish?'

'What's more, there's still no definitive news on Yang Ruiyi. If we really ignore Liu Bai and dive deep into the South, Situ Huo, Liu Bai, and the others could just abandon the mountain, race back to reinforce, and coordinate with Yang Ruiyi. Then _we_ would be the ones cut off and surrounded.'

'If we're striking south, Moongaze Lake is a more realistic target... but Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei are joined there. We couldn't take it quickly. The end result would be the same.'

No one answered him. Only Vast Cicada gave an awkward laugh.

"In that case, Daoist friend, please feel free to head south yourself. We still need to go north and catch them completely unprepared."

Liu Bai's group was already struggling to attack Mount Bianyan. How could they possibly withstand a pincer attack from the rear? Why take a massive risk by invading deep into enemy territory when there was such a soft target ripe for the taking?

At this, the man in white robes immediately fell silent. Tao Jiexing simply said,

"Time is short. Everyone, let's move!"

Instantly, countless golden lights erupted as they stepped into the Great Void and surged north. The sky churned with chaotic colors. Vast Cicada laughed.

"Daoist friend Touba and I will go first! The rest of you wait here and intercept their routing forces!"

...

Baixiang Valley.

Baixiang Valley had once been a precious land of exquisite beauty, the ancestral home of the great Su clan of Ning State. Its low hills were covered in maple trees. But now, the earth quaked and the mountains shook, and the ground was scarred with crisscrossing trenches.

A colossal golden body blotted out the sky, its countless eyes gazing down upon the mortal world. The heavens above were a swirl of mixed hues, with thousands of pink, illusory bands of light streaking across the firmament, layer upon layer, casting a gaudy, multicolored sheen over everything.

The one guarding this place was none other than a Liangli of the Way of Emptiness—Zhelu.

This Maha was a six-life reincarnator, and his power was immense.

And the sword cultivator standing opposite him, treading upon a field of pure white light, was Liu Bai.

This Daoist Master's divine ability blazed, filling heaven and earth. His feet were planted on the Azure Jade Cliff, an art that evaded calamity, and the longsword in his hand pointed directly at the Maha, showing no sign of weakness. Wherever his blade pointed, thousands of the Maha's eyes would squeeze shut in turn, streaming tears.

And behind this Daoist Master Zhusheng, a round jade ring hung suspended in the air. It was as large as a desk but as thin as a cicada's wing, divided into an inner and outer circle. A smoky, rouge-soaked light rippled across its surface. Empowered by his divine ability and dharma power, it spun like the dharma wheel of a true immortal, its divine might boundless.

The Supreme Goodness Profound Jade he had received in trade from Li Zhouwei all those years ago had now been refined by this Daoist Master into an exceptionally formidable treasure!

Under the dual empowerment of the jade wheel and his True Qi, he gave no ground, and even seemed to be overpowering Zhelu.

While his sword qi swept the field and stirred the heavens, Helian Wujiang and Murong Yan were still locked in combat with Chen Yin and Xianyao. In another part of the battlefield, Tinglan was in a much more difficult position.

Her opponents were Gao Fangjing, whose raging fires and fierce Spiritual Artifacts were deadly, and Changyun of Chengyun Gate, a master of metallic arts and profound Dao techniques. Gao Fangjing was the lesser threat; Changyun, despite his rogue cultivator origins, had already reached the mid-Purple Mansion Realm. His divine abilities were tyrannical.

Tinglan wove between them, relying on her Immeasurable Water and Fire and the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion, but the wounds on her body were accumulating. A deep sense of exhaustion was setting in.

'The North has too many people! Baixiang and Mount Bianyan... this was clearly a trap!'

Her heart grew heavy. Her gaze swept the battlefield, only to find that the most relaxed fighters were, paradoxically, the Li family's three Holders of the Profound, who were entangled at low altitude with several Merciful Ones.

There was a simple reason for this: when dealing with Buddhist cultivators, especially the Merciful Ones who served the Mahas, the Lightless Water and Fire was simply too effective.

This True Qi, manifested as a shimmering golden-purple flame and water, was even more terrifying than her own Immeasurable Water and Fire. Her art burned the surrounding Great Void; their art directly _severed_ the Merciful Ones from the Great Void itself.

For a Merciful One, this wasn't as simple as being unable to traverse. The guiding light from the Buddhist Land vanished instantly. All Buddhist arts linked to the Buddhist Land failed. Even though the Maha Liangli was right there, even though the Buddhist Land had never felt closer, they couldn't join hands, form an array, or draw upon its multicolored light. It was impossible. Unless Zhelu became so desperate that he ordered the Way of Emptiness's Buddhist Land to manifest and connect with the mortal world, these Merciful Ones couldn't hope for even a shred of its aid.

To make matters worse, Li Jiangliang and his brothers were no easy opponents. Their command of the light of Martial Cultivation grew more proficient by the moment, descending upon their foes one by one without the slightest hindrance. They were beginning to make it look effortless.

This undoubtedly relieved a great deal of pressure on Tinglan, easing her worries about being flanked. She raised her brow and once again forced the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion to suppress Changyun's golden saber. Her face paled, and before she could even dissolve the tremors rattling her body, her expression changed abruptly.

The True Fire that Gao Fangjing had sent hurtling toward her burned brightly, but from within it, a speck of yellow light suddenly flared!

Intertwining streams of Profound Yellow Qi burst forth, manifesting a bright, sharp halberd. Before it even reached her, a suffocating pressure washed over her face. This attack was prepared in advance, brimming with stored divine ability. It was aimed to kill.

'The Touba family!'

At that moment, both of Tinglan's Spiritual Artifacts and her Immeasurable Water and Fire were occupied, suppressed externally. Her own divine abilities were busy parrying, leaving her guard wide open. Seeing this, Changyun's eyelid twitched. He knew this was bad.

But just then, a brilliant radiance burst from Tinglan's glabella. A mirror leaped out!

The mirror was a shimmering, palm-sized disc of silver. It looked exceptionally fragile, yet it met the halberd with ferocious tenacity. In an instant, the silver light shattered, exploding outward to pierce heaven and earth!

"BOOM!"

A world-shaking crack of thunder echoed. The entire sky changed color as silver light cascaded down like a waterfall, unleashing thousands of streams of divine lightning.

"CLANG!"

This heaven-spanning tempest of lightning was terrifyingly potent. It cleansed the air, shattered evil arts, and dispersed all concealment, revealing the hidden figures suspended in the sky, one by one.

Tinglan's pupils dilated.

She saw Touba Ci materialize in front of her. Her heart sank. Her reaction was immediate; she knew what this meant. Her head snapped up, her gaze flying toward the three Li brothers in the foothills.

A speck of white had just leaped from the Great Void.

The thing was all claws and snapping jaws, its wings a blur. Tinglan knew it instantly—her heart seized with terror.

'Vast Cicada?!'

'That monk... he's after the sons of Bright Yang!'

"Hahahahaha!"

Almost simultaneously, the world exploded with a deafening roar. An immense golden form erupted from the ground between the three brothers. A face that towered into the clouds reappeared—its nose a mountain peak, its eyes like palace halls. Its giant mouth gaped open, and its tongue had transformed into a White Cicada, writhing and clawing as if in a savage sneer.

Vast Cicada had revealed his Golden Body without a moment's hesitation.

His Golden Body was so vast it cast a colossal shadow over the land, not only freezing the three brothers in their tracks but also sending the nearby Merciful Ones tumbling to the ground in terror.

"Vast Cicada?!"

Li Jiangliang felt a chill run down his spine. The delicate balance the three of them had struggled to maintain against the Merciful Ones was instantly shattered. The force of the roar shoved all three back nine steps. They paused for a fraction of a second, their faces completely engulfed in the immense shadow.

Gleaming white fangs parted. The mountain-sized White Cicada leaped forth. The thousands of human eyes embedded in its compound gaze fixed on him as it drew its limbs from the endless darkness and lunged, its arms spread wide in a crushing embrace.

A dignified Maha of five reincarnations had been lurking all this time, only to strike with his full, merciless power, and he was the target.

Li Jiangliang was enveloped by the shadow of that giant maw. He felt as if he were trapped in a blazing fire. His expression changed as his hands flew together, forming seals to sense Martial Cultivation and attempt an escape. But he found the White Cicada's crimson eyes boring into him, pinning him in place with a divine ability.

"DONG!"

A sonorous, melodic bell chimed in his ears.

"Fourth Brother!"

Li Jiangxia's roar shook the heavens. But everything before Li Jiangliang seemed to freeze. A golden light, no bigger than his palm, was born from the darkness. It swelled to the size of a mountain, like a tiger leaping from its long dormancy in the jungle, and it hacked squarely into the White Cicada's face.

"BOOM!"

The dazzling golden light banished all darkness. The world filled with the sound of cracking and shattering. The incessant chanting and the chiming bell that had filled his ears vanished, replaced by a profound silence.

"AOWOO!!"

An earth-shaking scream of agony echoed through the heavens. The scenery around him dissolved, flowing backward like a chaotic, disorderly river.

Li Jiangliang found his vision fading. Endless, howling winds swept past him. He was in a crimson desert, under a vast and empty sky, and the sounds of slaughter rose from all directions.

He felt the world spin. A golden-yellow sun was rising _backward_ from the west, ascending at a terrifying speed. A dark-golden halberd was embedded in a pale-white cicada husk, and a pair of invisible eyes opened, spanning the heavens and the earth.

Before this brilliant, colossal sun, which loomed like a great beast slumbering in the desert, he—Li Jiangliang—and his two elder brothers lowered their heads as one. It was as if their spines had been ripped out. Before that endless, qilin-like golden light, they were but three black specks, three ants, kneeling in the desert's howling gale.

Four stars flickered in the sky. The dark-golden halberd flew back to its owner's hand. Light and shadow played across his elder brother Li Jianglong's face. His eyes were squeezed shut, and with a voice filled with a bizarre mix of terror and joy, he choked out a single word.

"Father."
