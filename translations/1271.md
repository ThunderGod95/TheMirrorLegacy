# Chapter 1271: The Marquis of Yincheng

Within the opened doorway, light and shadow flowed like water, causing Li Zhouwei's robes to flutter loudly. He crossed the golden threshold, his figure disappearing into the intense Heavenly Light.

"Boom!"

Immediately after, the Profound Hall rumbled shut. The grand formation seemed to gain some new power as its colors grew more vibrant. The two qilin statues beside the steps instantly bared their fangs and brandished their claws, glaring menacingly as they burst with radiant light!

This grand hall stretched across the horizon as Heavenly Light swept out, indiscriminately suppressing every cultivator who flew into the clouds. It seemed to permit only that single figure in black robes to reside high within its walls.

Even though he, Xuanwei, had no intention of contending for treasures, he could still feel the killing intent emanating from the grand formation. He knew the Bright Yang formation was operating on its own, vigilantly guarding against him, the nearest Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

'Such potent spirituality…'

Xuanwei had guarded this mystic realm for many years. Even after handing it over so easily, he still held a sliver of curiosity, wanting to see what secrets the grand hall had kept hidden for a millennium…

He had flown here with the intention of taking a peek, but being barred by the Profound Hall, he could only shake his head helplessly. He turned to look at the celestial phenomena in the west and sighed faintly.

'All debts must be repaid…'

Li Zhouwei was naturally unaware of Xuanwei's thoughts. As the King of Wei crossed the threshold, he saw a long corridor of vermilion and flowing gold. Pillar after pillar of scarlet stood in the darkness. While the Heavenly Light outside was brilliant, the interior of this grand hall was dim.

As he stepped forward, the spiritual flames on the lampstands lining the path flickered to life one by one, casting a gentle, pale gold light.

This radiance illuminated rows of dark red objects in the darkness. The young man glanced at them casually, discovering they were small cushions the size of prayer mats, made of a dark red spiritual cloth that was faintly mottled.

Scattered white bones lay casually about the grand hall, some whole, some shattered. They were strewn sparsely, here a little and there a little, across these cushions. Occasionally, a tangled bundle of robes could be seen.

Li Zhouwei's divine ability swept across the scene, and his expression turned slightly grim.

These bones were dull and lightless, crumbling at the slightest touch—most of them belonged to mortals.

'Even if these bones show traces of being infused with dharma power, it couldn't erase a thousand years of time. They must have been… the officials of the Great Wei.'

The Great Wei had promoted the method of the Celestial Dynasty, augmenting mortal bodies with divine marvels and dharma power. When the Great Wei collapsed, the vast majority of the officials in this hall must have perished together.

He casually flicked open a storage pouch. As expected, it was empty, likely having been looted clean by those who survived the great calamity and attempted to flee.

He watched in silence, walking along this path paved with bones until his view finally opened up, and he arrived in the main hall of the grand palace.

Compared to the antechamber, this place was in even greater disarray. The floor was covered with white bones mixed with large amounts of gold dust, shattered porcelain shards, and jade slips that had been trampled to pieces.

Li Zhouwei conjured a wisp of Heavenly Light, and his figure drifted, landing in a corner of the hall. There was a pale golden, circular archway, sealed tightly by a formation. With a light push from him, the gate opened on its own.

This area, which was lined with dense rows of stone cabinets, was clearly much cleaner and tidier. An occasional cabinet or two had toppled, and from the jade vials that had rolled out, the medicinal pills had been eroded to dust by the ages. Li Zhouwei didn't spare them a second glance, merely beckoning gently with his hand.

Bright golden patterns instantly appeared on the stone walls on both sides, which then slid open. Rows of black jade boxes shot out, arranging themselves neatly before him.

Li Zhouwei flicked a finger, and the most exquisitely patterned box in the very center opened first.

The white stone inside this box was no larger than a pupil, suffused with celestial authority and intertwined with flames. Its color was a brilliant white, as if wreathed in a cloud of smoke.

A Purple Mansion Realm spiritual item, the Radiant Sky Stone.

The young man stared at it for a moment.

This was an item that had once cost the Li Clan all its strength, involved a Purple Mansion cultivator, and demanded the sacrifice of lives. Now, lying in this black jade box, it was but an ordinary object.

It was a good thing, but no longer worth getting excited over.

He turned his hand and put it away. The other five boxes also opened in unison. For a moment, colors intertwined and radiant flames cast an ethereal glow, filling the secret chamber with multicolored light. Aside from two boxes of 'Li Fire' spiritual resources, the other three were all 'Molten Fire' spiritual resources!

'Molten Fire? Interesting…'

This finally brought a small smile to Li Zhouwei's face. However, the descent of the mystic realm was certain to attract prying eyes from all directions. He didn't linger for a moment. With a single step, he used the formation to pass through the stone wall and arrive in another secret chamber.

There was no need to break any formations or investigate closely. He once again beckoned gently, and Heavenly Light suffused the stone wall. Four jade boxes promptly shot out!

The King of Wei flicked his finger, shattering the jade boxes. Their contents flew out, arranging themselves one by one before him.

The most brilliant object was a spiritual axe of reddish-gold!

In ancient times, the larger version was a halberd and the smaller an axe. This axe was only about an arm's length, much smaller than the Radiant Sun King's Halberd. It was engraved with the pattern of a beast's face, set against a background of clouds and lightning. The blade was wide and curved, with both corners turned up, giving it a rather ferocious appearance.

'It can be considered a fine item.'

What gave Li Zhouwei pause was that this item was actually a 'Dawn Qi' object!

This 'Dawn Qi' was vastly different from Gongsun Bei's 'Dawn Qi' from before. It did not appear greenish-white but was instead tinged with red. When he sensed it closely, he could faintly feel a burgeoning energy, like a rising sun.

'Ancient Dawn Qi?'

He flipped the axe over and saw ant-like script on its side.

'General Tiancui, Wei Xuan of Boye.'

Although this item felt extremely familiar, Li Zhouwei did not touch it with his divine ability. Instead, he temporarily tucked it into his sleeve and turned to look at the other items.

The other three items were a Dawn Qi saber, a Bright Yang goblet, and a Molten Fire sword. After Li Zhouwei examined them, he couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. The Bright Yang spiritual goblet had some merit, but it was only slightly better than the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. The other two items were crude, making him frown deeply.

'Not all ancient Spiritual Artifacts are masterpieces; only the masterpieces have been passed down in the outside world to this day. These two items can't even compare to my great-uncle's spirit embryo.'

But no matter what, even dismantling these items would yield a few spiritual resources. He immediately collected them, his gaze then sweeping down to the numerous weapons on the floor.

Unlike the medicinal pills in the other secret chamber, the low-level cultivator weapons strewn across the floor here were much less damaged by the passage of time. Most had sustained damage due to the Bright Yang shift, but their overall materials were of high quality, exquisite and ancient!

It was these things, conversely, that made Li Zhouwei nod with pleasant surprise.

'Perfect for arming Ting Province!'

Ting Province was very backward in the art of artifact refinement. Even with a rising star like Li Jiangzong, they ultimately lacked a genius of the highest caliber, nor was the practice popular across the province. Emptying this place of its weaponry to arm his subordinates would save a massive amount of low-level cultivation resources, and they were even more exquisitely uniform than what the Li family could forge themselves!

Not to mention all the manpower it would save!

Taking another step, he was already in another location. Here, flames surged with extremely vibrant colors. The walls were forged from pure gold, exuding an air of oppressive luxury. In the very center stood a golden platform, merely two feet square. Its center was slightly concave, and surprisingly, it held a single medicinal pill!

The pill was shrouded in a hazy flame, as if hidden behind white gauze. After a thousand years, it still shone with brilliance, continuously emitting a mysterious fragrance that tempted any nearby to seize it.

'This is…'

Li Zhouwei was slightly astonished.

'No wonder. So it's a Molten Fire pill.'

Molten Fire is the counterpart to Valley Water, a fire of concealment. Hidden in a mystic realm and sealed within a secret chamber, it had benefited from its environment. It was an extremely advanced medicinal pill to begin with, specially nurtured and enhanced by a formation. Preserved for a thousand years, the pill's radiance was exceptionally bright; its potency had likely increased rather than diminished!

This was why, among the discoveries of mystic realms and cave dwellings across the world, aside from the lost Vault Metal, the most commonly preserved medicinal pills were those of the Horn Wood, Valley Water, and Molten Fire treasures, while the rarest were the Geng Metal, Renewing Wood, Pristine Water, Blazing Fire, and Manifestation Earth types!

He was not versed in the Dao of alchemy and couldn't identify it, but his Dao-Profundity allowed him to understand the principles behind it. He found a box, placed the pill inside, and specifically used his divine ability to seal it tightly before putting it away in his sleeve.

There was still an herb garden and a casting platform left in this hall, but they had not survived like the other areas and had been completely plundered. Li Zhouwei's Spirit Probe had already swept over them. After making a show of walking around, he took a step and arrived upon the high platform.

The scarlet-gold profound gate in the deepest part.

Just like all the previous restrictions, the core gate of this grand hall did not dare to block his path. With a gentle push, it slowly swung open.

But unlike the previous gloom, this doorway actually shone with a golden light that cast itself upon the white bones covering the floor—the interior was brightly lit.

Li Zhouwei raised his eyebrows.

In the deepest, most secluded hall of this mystic realm, stood three golden thrones—one main and two auxiliary. The two on the sides had long been empty, but a person was seated on the central one.

This person was dressed in a red robe and wore a jade crown. His face was extremely young and exceptionally handsome. He was leaning against the main seat, his head propped up by his hand, seemingly dozing in the high-backed throne.

The red of the robe was intense, its gold-thread patterns complex and spiraling, veiled in the color of a solar vermilion cloud. Its golden trim intertwined with the morning light, creating a magnificent, profound radiance—Li Zhouwei knew with a single glance that this spiritual robe was no worse than the gourd from before!

Most captivating of all was the point of Heavenly Light at the center of his brow, blazing with a brilliance that was quite intimidating.

In the perception of his Spirit Probe, the person before him did not seem like a body, but rather a divine ability concentrated to its absolute limit, ready to erupt at any moment. Yet, it seemed to be suppressed by something, continuously entangled with the golden throne beneath, returning in failure time and time again.

'He has perished.'

Li Zhouwei said nothing, stepping up the stairs one by one until he stood before this person. He felt the scorching Heavenly Light that seemed about to rush into his face and noticed the specks of blood near his boots.

The blood was golden-red, spattered drop by drop near his feet, flickering with flames.

As Li Zhouwei's gaze lifted, the King of Wei finally saw tiny, pale golden scales on his neck. The scales were no bigger than grains of rice and flickered with profound patterns, looking like a few specks of light had landed on his neck, but Li Zhouwei saw them with perfect clarity.

This was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had died from breathlessness.

A Daoist Master of the Wei-Li.

Li Zhouwei did not rashly touch his remains, but instead carefully sensed the divine ability within his body.

'It's Molten Fire… Although all the divine abilities in his body have merged into one and are locked within his corpse, judging by the intensity of this divine ability… he was likely a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.'

With this judgment, Li Zhouwei finally took a step and circled around, at last discovering a pale golden token at the side of the golden throne.

The token was as large as a palm, with graceful, profound patterns. The front was inscribed with only a single character.

【Li】.

When he turned it to the back, however, there were many seal-script characters.

Marquis of Yincheng.

The Great Wei was truly extravagant. A mere identity token was of exceptionally high quality, seemingly crafted from a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resource. Upon obtaining this token, Li Zhouwei finally detected the faint aura this person had refined into it.

'That purple and gold gourd… it must have been his. I just don't know why he wasn't carrying it, or why it wasn't even in this great hall, but was lost somewhere in the mystic realm, only to be discovered by me as it fell from the sky…'

And beneath the golden token, several lines had been condensed from divine ability and blood, coiling on the ground like snakes to form words. The writing was already very faint:

'【The Hou Mochen Clan secretly colluded with the rebel army. Tuoba Ling was harmed by them, leading to the defeat at Mianchi. This was not Gao Xun's fault…】'

'【Is the Radiant Sun King at Han Pass?】'

Li Zhouwei glanced at the bloodstains on the ground, making deductions based on his Dao-Profundity and experience.

'This person's injuries were very severe. He hid in the depths of this great hall. This thing that looks like a golden throne is actually a formation plate connected to the grand formation, used to suppress his injuries… He must have been communicating with the surviving Wei forces in the mystic realm using his divine ability and blood…'

But what he had not expected was that, after a short gap, there was more writing, clearly written and extremely messy:

'【With the loss of Mianchi, my death is not enough to atone】. '

'The time gap between the two lines of writing is vast, as if a very long time passed between them…'

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes watched quietly.

'This person was likely at least from a relatively close branch of the Wei-Li. His lifespan was not short, and his dharma body was extremely strong. Who knows how long he sat in this mystic realm, watching his subordinates perish one by one, until no more sound came from the outside world, before he finally wrote this second line…'

'In the end, he no longer had the strength to stand up from this position. Yet he was afraid that perishing on the spot would disturb the spiritual mechanics and affect the mystic realm, allowing others to detect it. He could only connect his Dharma Body to the formation, using his own body to imprison the Molten Fire divine ability in this place…'

'And it had to be Molten Fire. Had it been any other divine ability, it would have been absolutely impossible to maintain it for so many years after death…'

A thoughtful look appeared on his face. He turned his hand and put the golden token away, looking pensively at the Dharma Body before him. His gaze fell upon a few of the characters:

"Radiant Sun King… so there really was a Radiant Sun King."

Although the Radiant Sun King's Halberd was a ceremonial weapon, it could resonate with its user. The stronger the user's Bright Yang divine ability, the more miraculous and powerful the weapon became, not in the least inferior to a Spiritual Treasure. It could be said to be a weighty treasure that Li Zhouwei had found comfortable to wield so far, and one he would not easily replace in the future!

This weapon had originally been obtained by Daoist Master Yuansu in the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. Its last owner was said to be named Li Guangfu, who was likely also of the Wei-Li.

Li Zhouwei gave the bloodstains on the ground one last look, committed them all to memory, then waved his hand to erase them. He took a step back, gave a slight bow, then turned and descended, a thought stirring in his heart.

'This Profound Hall has separated from the mystic realm and is now like water without a source, growing weaker by the day. But control is already in my hands, so moving it will not be difficult!'

'A full three-divine-ability Purple Mansion cultivator, and with Molten Fire, the gentlest of the flames at that… If I move it back to the lake and find a suitable location to carefully arrange it, I can certainly create a sacred land for cultivation and alchemy!'

Impatience over small things can disrupt great plans. Even knowing the spiritual robe on the body was priceless, and who knew what other fine treasures were in the storage pouch beneath it, Li Zhouwei did not touch him. He strode out with large steps. Behind him, the gates of the Profound Hall closed one by one, locking the remains of the Marquis of Yincheng within the great hall!

By the time he stepped out, the main gate of the Profound Hall had also closed. Two guards, miraculously conjured, loyally escorted him down the profound steps and bowed deeply.

"We respectfully send off Your Highness!"

Only then did Li Zhouwei lower his gaze and look down, discovering that the hall was now several dozen feet higher than before. It shone with a dazzling light, burning with purple flames, as if to symbolize that only he was qualified to be in mid-air. Even Xuanwei, to avoid contending with the grand formation, had retreated half a step and was watching from a distance at a lower altitude.

Seeing Li Zhouwei emerge, Xuanwei finally crossed the Great Void to approach him and bowed.

"Congratulations, King Wei!"

Li Zhouwei nodded, his gaze pausing for an instant as he looked at him.

'I'm afraid the Tao family's ancestor also guessed that this Marquis of Yincheng was defeated at Mianchi and fled all the way back here to pass away. Desiring this person's full divine ability, robes, and Spiritual Artifacts, he silently sealed this mystic realm, awaiting the right opportunity.'

Xuanwei was unaware of his thoughts. His expression grew slightly grave as he said:

"Your Majesty, Mountain's Edge Hall has fallen!"

Li Zhouwei turned to look. Sure enough, the southern sky was filled with Li Fire, scorching and oppressive. Clouds of fire filled the surroundings. It should have enveloped an entire region, but it was being forced back by the wind and sand of Boye and the purple clouds of Yinling, brewing a terrifying storm in the sky.

Li Zhouwei said in a low voice:

"I must ask Daoist Master to make a trip to Ruzhou."

The four wildernesses were shaking. No matter how stable Ruzhou's mystic realm was, after experiencing the destruction of its grand formation and the upheaval of the Buddhists, and with three other mystic realms falling nearby, it surely could not hold on now. Its fall was only a matter of moments!

'Que'Wan is in the south. The only one here who can gain the trust of the Yu Clan and not embezzle the spiritual resources and items is the man before me.'

Xuanwei hesitated for a moment but understood his meaning. He finally nodded, rose on a beam of light, and dispersed like smoke. Li Zhouwei, meanwhile, turned around and, with a gentle lift, caught a person from below and brought them into the raging flames.

This person had a calm expression and a jet-black sword hanging from his waist. He was at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. It was Chen Yang!

Li Zhouwei's expression was slightly grave as he said:

"Organize some men and break the restrictions on the ruins. There's more than one storage pouch here. Dig three feet deep; not a single one can be missed!"

Li Zhouwei had not forgotten the bodies that littered the ground. Since that Daoist Master had not responded and great chaos had erupted in the mystic realm, cultivators fought and killed each other, plundering wealth. Anyone who escaped the great hall without reaching the Purple Mansion Realm was inevitably doomed to wait for death, their lifespans ending as they passed away in the mystic realm!

'If I find all these storage pouches, I should be able to salvage three catties of iron from this wrecked ship.'

This kind of treasure hunting could easily lead to embezzlement by subordinates. It was best to entrust it to Chen Yang. The man nodded solemnly and descended with a grim face. Li Zhouwei then took a step, his form changing into a blazing streak of Heavenly Light that shot across the sky, heading west!

Before long, he saw the ground covered with floating clouds and mist, flashing with green light. The spiritual mechanics were in a state of chaos, with sand and stones flying across the mountains and fields. A spot of gold stood in the Great Void and flew forward to meet him, bowing.

"Your Majesty!"

Cui Jueyin's eyes were burning brightly; he had clearly come ahead to welcome him. He reported,

"The mystic realm of Boye was ultimately unable to hold on and has fallen. This subordinate has already gone ahead to watch over it. Currently, Senior Liu is guarding the area."

His brow darkened slightly as he said:

"There are faint stirrings from Zanmen, seemingly probing the situation… Senior Changyun has already gone to stand guard, to prevent a sudden move from a Maha!"

Li Zhouwei shook his head and smiled.

"They've just been soundly beaten by me. They won't dare come out for a while."

Li Zhouwei had conquered this place and immediately began to shake the mystic realms without pause, precisely to seize this window of opportunity. The various cultivators had just been repelled and were reorganizing everywhere; they had not yet had a chance to mobilize their divine abilities or summon a Maha. It was the perfect moment to bring down the mystic realms.

'If I had been even a day or two slower, seeing all these treasures fall, how could the various cultivators have let it go so easily?'

But as his gaze slowly swept across the sky, he did not see a palace suspended in mid-air, and a trace of disappointment flashed in his eyes.

'【The Wei Palace rides the heavens, falling but not destroyed】. With no palace rising now, the Qiao Clan must have obtained this mystic realm and, over the past thousand years, already breached and modified the main hall, making it their own. What a pity!'

He descended in a streak of light. Liu Changdie was approaching on a golden radiance, his face deeply moved as he lamented.

"King Wei… truly decisive!"

Li Zhouwei chuckled, his eyes quickly scanning the land.

Compared to the chaos of Yinling, this place appeared orderly and well-managed. After all, it was the Qiao Clan's own mystic realm. They were familiar with most of its formations and mechanisms. Aside from the restrictions created by its fall, there were hardly any troubles. Many of the Jade Court Guards were even already stationed among the ruins, sealing off the various halls.

Cui Jueyin led him to the location, bowed, and said formally:

"This subordinate has already inquired about the Qiao Clan's various methods. I invite Your Majesty to enter!"

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes swept over the area as he stepped onto the main hall. He immediately discovered that this place had been converted into a grand formation of the 'Lesser Yang' Dao, though traces of the Wei hall's shadow could still be vaguely seen in the corners.

He said softly:

"Bring me the things left behind by the Wei-Li."

Cui Jueyin was meticulous and had already made preparations. Pushing open the hall door, he saw a sword already placed on a golden platform. Standing humbly beside it was a person, who seemed to be the patriarch of the Qiao Clan.

Cui Jueyin said in a low voice,

"After the Qiao Clan obtained the mystic realm, over many years they have traded away or reforged the items of the former Wei, leaving almost no trace. However, there is one item that the Qiao Clan has always kept suppressed within the formation, never allowing it to circulate."

Li Zhouwei's gaze had already settled on the sword.

The sword was exceedingly long and slender. Its base was crimson, interwoven with black patterns and speckled with gold, creating a variegated effect. It was as if someone had sprayed a mouthful of golden blood onto the spiritual sword, giving its colors an unevenness that held a strange kind of beauty.

The Qiao Clan Patriarch glanced at the two of them, then fell to his knees with a thud, saying in a low voice:

"Reporting to you sirs, this is an item left behind in the hall from the time of the Wei… Celestial Dynasty… It is a high-grade sword artifact… untamable and unruly. In the Qiao Clan's grand thousand years, only two people have ever managed to subdue this sword…"

Li Zhouwei had seen his fair share of treasures, but upon suddenly seeing this sword, he couldn't help but show a look of appreciation and reached out a single hand.

"Om…"

Under the slightly stunned gaze of the Qiao clansman, the spiritual sword suddenly brightened, leaped up, and landed of its own accord in the hand of the King of Wei!

The moment the precious sword landed in his hand, it seemed to come alive. It vibrated intensely, continuously emitting a high-pitched sword cry, humming and buzzing as if weeping and complaining. The golden specks on it instantly brightened, casting a field of light!

Li Zhouwei sighed softly:

"A fine treasure…"

In Li Zhouwei's spiritual sense, this sword's killing intent was extremely heavy, and its might was equally dense. It condensed boundless spiritual mechanics and Heavenly Light, as if ready to burst out of the blade at any moment. Its colors were variegated, black and gold speckling red. Vaguely, it seemed even more noble than the purple and gold gourd from the Governing Yang Grotto!

'What a pity I am not a sword cultivator!'

Surprise and regret mingled in his eyes. His gaze casually swept over the scattered items on the golden platform, and they all suddenly seemed like common trinkets. He turned around and smiled:

"With this sword, my slaying of Gongsun Bei was not in vain!"

...

Guyan Great Desert.

The Seeking Evil Stage was a riot of color, with flames rolling and inches of fire dancing in the air. The light of Dawn Qi converged with falling Ministerial Fire. In the distance, the atmospheric phenomena were world-shaking, yet all the flames within the grand formation were converging upon this stage.

"Boom!"

The Great Void trembled ceaselessly. The Golden Core was like a Flood Dragon emerging from the water, roaming the Great Void before descending from the sky again, to be caught in a fair, white hand.

"Concordant Conquest!"

"It's done!"

The youth in crimson robes stepped out, his slightly narrow eyes filled with surprise and a hint of contemplation. But before he could think it through, his ear twitched, and he looked up with some astonishment.

The distant horizon was adorned with purple fire and purple smoke, deep and scorching, as if covered in purple glaze. Reflected against the sandy haze, it presented a magnificent, surging ocean of purple.

The northern atmospheric phenomena filled the sky.

In all his years of cultivation, Li Jiangqian had never seen such a spectacular phenomenon.

'It's Luoxia…'

He took a step out. The sky was already crowded with cultivators, each one looking northward with a pale face. The crimson-robed youth stared for several breaths, a suspicion rising in his heart. No longer feeling at ease, he flashed with Li-Light and appeared on the mountain!

White flowers billowed and fierce flames soared. The white-robed Daoist Master was also standing on the mountain, gazing north in some amazement. Seeing Li Jiangqian appear, he was overjoyed, his expression becoming animated.

"Jiangqian? You've succeeded!"

"How could it be so fast!"

Li Ximing was even a little uncertain. Li Jiangqian smiled, though his heart was truly full of doubt, and said,

"It was indeed much faster… I rushed the practice of this divine ability, so it should have been unrefined. For the first few years, I made no progress, but when it came to the critical juncture, it was as if I leaped over an obstacle. Within a few days, the divine ability erupted, the Shengyang Acupoint shone brightly, and I actually saved several years of effort! This junior is also very pleasantly surprised…"

He understood the priorities, but seeing that his elder showed no worry, his heart relaxed. He smiled and asked,

"What is this phenomenon in Luoxia? How many Purple Mansion cultivators must have fallen for this to happen! Could it be that… Luoxia's Purple Mansion cultivators are being beheaded in succession?"

Li Jiangqian's sudden joke made Li Ximing laugh out loud.

He said, "Not at all… It's the mystic realms of Luoxia's aristocratic families being taken down one by one by your father!"

Li Jiangqian was stunned to hear this, a thoughtful look appearing in his eyes. Li Ximing was both worried and pleased, saying,

"Your sister is guarding Xiangxiang. News just arrived a few days ago. The King of Wei took Xiangxiang in a great victory, captured Lu Fu alive, and made a surprise attack on Liangchuan, subsequently breaking through the various states of Luo. In the whole of Luoxia, only Jiang Fuwang escaped. He slew Gongsun Bei at Boye… Now he's going to take down all the mystic realms of Luo…"

A look of realization suddenly lit up in his eyes, and he said in a low voice:

"I understand!"

Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow. The elder transmitted his voice with his divine ability:

'Your father's Talisman Qi, 'Illuminating Sun and Moon', has a small miraculous effect called 'Inheriting the Enterprise and Securing Peace'. It is used to display the might of the Bright Yang and can boost your morale… This affair in Luoxia, slaying a general in battle and pacifying the region in a matter of days, isn't that precisely 'Concordant Conquest'? There could be no image more fitting than this!'

Li Ximing was quite amazed and couldn't help but praise.

"Your father's Dao-Profundity is extremely high. He probably thought of this long ago. He launched a solo surprise attack, doing everything in his power to pacify Luoxia in an instant, all for the sake of perfecting your divine ability!"

"Inheriting the Enterprise and Securing Peace?"

Li Jiangqian's eyes lit up. He nodded thoughtfully and sighed.

"So that's how it is!"

Li Ximing sighed, then changed the subject, saying,

"But I've heard some news these past few days that is quite unsettling… What is the King of Wei… trying to do now? It seems it will be difficult to defend, so he plans to plunder everything and temporarily withdraw."

Li Jiangqian poured himself some tea and smiled.

"No need to worry. We must defend it, and we must defend it continuously. It is surely for Daoist Master Xiao. Luoxia is the springboard to the north. Only by taking this place can we extend our hand towards Badger Prefecture!"

After hearing his words, Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then shook his head and said:

"Then I am even more confused."

"Your father slaying Gongsun Bei was very impressive. But now that he's knocked down all the mystic realms one by one, the gains are indeed substantial, but the aristocratic families of Luoxia have numerous Purple Mansion cultivators and deep backgrounds. They are likely very dissatisfied with him…"

"While he is here standing guard, of course they are all obedient and submissive. But once he is no longer here, these people will harbor resentment. Even if they don't defect to the Great Zhao, it's highly likely they will secretly slack off!"

"When the time comes that he is not here to stand guard, or if something happens in Badger Prefecture that requires his presence, and the Buddhists pull the rug out from under them, and these people refuse to cooperate in the defense, wouldn't that be a huge problem?"

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian narrowed his eyes, which shone with a golden light, and said,

"Great-Uncle, in the eyes of the north, what do you think this Luoxia counts for?"

Li Ximing was startled. Li Jiangqian smiled.

"Zanmen is the upper arm, Gu Prefecture is the cheekbone, and only after crossing the Ji River and Badger Prefecture can one see the heart and lungs. As for a mere Luoxia, long unacquainted with war, it is nothing but thigh meat!"

"In years past, the thigh meat grew on their own body. The Buddhists and other cultivators would only look on, perhaps touch, and drool. Now that Luoxia has been lost and become my father's territory, that thigh meat has fallen off and become a delicacy. With those mystic realms hanging in the air, filled with countless treasures, pairs of eyes are staring this way, eager to carve it up and devour it!"

Li Ximing frowned and nodded, lost in thought. Li Jiangqian shook his head and praised.

"And my father, by conquering the cultivators and striking the mystic realms, is precisely trying to make this piece of thigh meat lose its luster. With the states of Luo turned into a wasteland, and Yinling being too high to climb, who would be willing to come here and attack? Who would come to gnaw on bones in a thankless task? The Buddhists don't work for the Zhao court for free!"

"I'm afraid those with ulterior motives may suspect my father is here to plunder, but they might not necessarily believe he won't defend it!"

He stood up, clasped his hands behind his back, and smiled:

"Only by causing a worldwide sensation, a complete uproar, and letting the entire world know that Luoxia is empty will it naturally lose its allure. Even if some are forced to come, they will only go through the motions of advancing and retreating—there is no benefit to taking this land!"

"If I am not mistaken, my father will next carry out a large-scale migration of aristocratic families, transferring spiritual resources and population back to the Great Song under the watchful eyes of the entire world. Only three things will be left here."

"A Purple Mansion Realm grand formation, the direct lineage cultivators of Luo, and Purple Mansion cultivators."

His eyes turned slightly cold.

"There's no need to consider whether the Purple Mansion cultivators of Luoxia will do their utmost. By moving the mortals away and leaving the cultivators within the grand formation, he will have a grip on both their hearts and their tails. How could they not obey and submit?"

"The Purple Mansion cultivators of Luoxia will have no choice but to fight with all their might, while the Buddhists and other cultivators who invade this land won't even be able to capture a blood sacrifice. Why worry that Luoxia cannot be defended? Even if my father is not here, defending this place will be just as easy!"

He naturally stepped down and said leisurely:

"As for the spiritual resources, spiritual items, and the fallen mystic realms, we will hold them first, grasp them in our hands. Whether to give or take, to pick or choose, the grace and power will naturally be ours. How can others be allowed to question it?"
