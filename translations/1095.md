# Chapter 1095: Avidya (Ignorance)

"Your Highness... We cannot attack the Wei capital."

"My lord... my lord, Grand-uncle Zhouda... he was killed by Wang Quwan... The Western Mountains were breached by Ni Zan... Fifth Grand-uncle has also exhausted his essence and died... That black ape still wants to harm us... My lord... what are we to do..."

Li Suining's mind was heavy and groggy. He awoke from his daze covered in a cold sweat. The room around him was pitch black, the light of a jade lamp flickering fitfully. On the jade table before him, a round tray sat perfectly in place, a jade knife resting beside it. Everything was peaceful and harmonious.

He actually felt a wave of relief.

Everything he had just experienced felt like a nightmare. He had merely dozed off at the table; nothing unusual had happened at all.

But as his dazed gaze shifted, he spotted a man in ink-black robes seated at the other side of the table. The man was majestic and imposing, his bearing utterly transcendent.

His pair of golden pupils were lowered, focused on a profound scroll in his hands. His expression seemed complex.

'King Wei!'

All at once, his memories rushed back. He knew he had been drunk from a single cup of wine until this very moment, and that the Daoist Master had already reached a decision. Overcome with panic, Li Suining leaped from the main seat and dropped to the ground with a thud, his voice full of reverence.

"This junior... pays his respects to Your Majesty..."

"Rise."

Li Zhouwei's voice was surprisingly calm, almost gentle. Li Suining looked up, meeting those golden eyes, and was struck by a powerful, dizzying sense of familiarity.

'In my past life, the last time King Wei rode out for battle... he called us in one by one to give his last instructions. When it was my turn, he spoke to me with this exact same gaze. He said...'

'He said, Suining, if Zhouming falls, you are to inherit the orthodoxy. As for your own successor... you will decide.'

A sudden peace settled over Li Suining's heart. He kowtowed twice, listening as Li Zhouwei spoke.

"You have suffered."

That single sentence brought tears streaming down his face. He looked up, his voice thick.

"Your Highness... I!"

He had barely begun to speak when a divine ability sealed his mouth, leaving him tongue-tied. Li Zhouwei watched him softly, patting his shoulder.

"Do not overthink things. I know you've had a fortunate encounter. From this day on, you may leave this mountain, but you are forbidden from leaving Moongaze Lake. When I have made my preparations, I will arrange a path for you. For any matter that requires a decision, I will meet you in secret."

He paused, a flicker of hesitation in his eyes.

"As for... Grand-uncle..."

Li Zhouwei considered his words.

"There is no need to tell him anything. He is not like me. He... cannot bear it."

In an instant, Li Suining understood. The King's first concern was identical to his own upon his rebirth. This King Wei... he had been making preparations to protect Daoist Master Zhaojing long, long ago.

'I'm afraid it's not just me. The other major powers nearby must also understand... They're desperate for the Li clan to grow stronger, just so King Wei won't be left all alone. Even if it only makes him hesitate for a moment... or concede a single step... they would see it as a victory.'

Li Suining nodded, whimpering. He looked up at Li Zhouwei, whose golden eyes burned bright. The King's lips parted, as if to ask a question, but in the end, he said nothing on that matter.

"I must make a trip north."

Li Suining quickly wiped his tears away.

"Your Highness! If my knowledge is correct, this trip should be free of great disaster. However, the Touba family possesses a monstrous demonic dao that brings ruin to the soul. I implore you and the other lord to be careful!"

"The soul?"

Li Zhouwei seemed entirely unafraid. He just chuckled, shook his head, and stepped forward. Treading on the Heavenly Light, he passed through the Great Void and vanished into the deep, infinite darkness.

The moment he was swallowed by the all-consuming shadows, the smile vanished from his face. The gentleness in his eyes evaporated, replaced by a savage, beast-like viciousness. A cold sneer, sharp as ice, touched his lips.

'Wang Quwan? A 'good' Wang Quwan, indeed.'

...

The world was heavy and dim, shrouded in mist and swirling clouds.

The grayish-white Profound Banner of the White Ye Immortal Sect snapped and fluttered in the wind. Faintly visible on its surface, the character for "Zhao" seemed to have shrunk, appearing ghostly and indistinct. Beneath the banner, a youth in blue robes sat on the steps, a jade pot in hand and a smile on his face.

Helian Wumeng stood encased in shining silver heavy armor, wreathed in a brilliant profound light. He resembled a crouching behemoth, his face obscured. His voice was like the clang of metal on stone.

"Senior Bai, what is the situation?"

In the distance, the Wilderness lay submerged in darkness. This place, once the "Hongxue Treasure Shore" of the Hongxue Sect, had been plundered and fought over relentlessly since that sect's annihilation. It was now a land scarred and broken. Yehui's gaze retracted, falling back to the scroll in his hand.

It was a letter from Qi Lanyan, stating that negotiations on the Great Western Plateau were complete.

Yehui gave an unreadable smile.

"The White Victory Dao Lord's demonic body has already left the mountains. His demon body is heading south from the Ruwu Strategic Pass to strike Qize from the flank. The Western Shu... they cannot move, and they do not wish to."

Helian Wumeng's expression was peculiar.

"I have long heard of his reputation. This will be a good chance to see what's so special about him, that Lord Wei would call him a confidant and allow the White Victory Dao to rise so abruptly. Everyone thinks the Western Shu are just putting on a show, but if we're not careful, we could truly suffer for it."

Yehui rolled up the scroll and rose to his feet. He watched Helian Wujiang stroll out of the Great Void and laughed.

"You two again, uncle and nephew. Your task is to stop the southern reinforcements, so they send you to wade into wherever the fighting is thickest. It can't be a pleasant feeling, can it?"

From the perspective of their southern advance, the entire riverbank had only three entry points. The easiest was Moongaze Lake. The one with the largest concentration of divine abilities was Profound Peak. And the most dangerous... was the Wilderness.

After all, everyone was guessing that Yang Ruiyi was on the mountain. But the man was infuriatingly elusive. What if they were wrong? If he was still lying in wait in the Wilderness, the vanguard would be in mortal peril.

It was precisely this fear of Yang Ruiyi's schemes that had Tangdao Mountain completely surrounded. Qi Lanyan's main force was still focused on advancing south from Profound Peak, terrified that Yang Ruiyi was pulling a feint. What if he made a desperate gamble, sacrificing Tangdao Mountain to secure Profound Peak? Profound Peak was their key to suppressing the Great Song. Even if all of Jiangbei were lost, Profound Peak could not fall.

Helian Wujiang seemed to know Yehui well enough not to take offense. He just mused,

"We appreciate Daoist Friend's concern. My Dao relies on cultivating Baleful Qi, which gives us considerable resistance to both 'True Qi' and 'Exiled Qi'. Our deployment here is only natural."

Helian Wumeng remained silent, his grip on his weapon simply tightening.
Yehui stood with his hands clasped behind his back.

"My Capital Guard Dao specializes in Spirit-Summoning and mountain governance. In ancient times, no cultivator would establish a Dao lineage without first consulting the Capital Guard. Years ago, when I visited the Profound Governance group, Lord Wei mentioned Moongaze Lake. I told him that the lake sits between north and south; it is a 'Living Attribute'. If its master can hold it, it will be a great boon for their ascension. If not, outside evil will bleed in, causing internal chaos. It would inevitably become another Golden Tang Gate."

He turned his gaze to the Helian duo.

"And your family's home in Hetao... in my opinion, it's in an even more wretched position than Moongaze Lake. You have a local Dharma Realm to your front and the Touba at your back. You're flanked by ambition and elbowed by the 'Profound Chen'. In my Capital Guard Dao, we call such a place a 'Death Attribute'. A person of virtue would not occupy that mountain, nor build a foundation in such a land."

Helian Wujiang remained perfectly calm, his expression natural, even thoughtful. He skillfully changed the subject.

"Oh? Then it seems Daoist Friend was quite meticulous in establishing your own Dao lineage in Baiye Creek."

Yehui knew this was a barb, mocking how his own Dao lineage was now exposed to the south's blade. He gave a dry laugh.

"Of course. I occupy land from which I can advance or retreat. In all of the northern and southern Sanjiang, only two such places exist. One is Chengyun. The other... is my Baiye."

Helian Wujiang stared at him, his voice flat.

"Daoist Friend, you use the lives of your entire Dao lineage as capital for your own path to attaining the Dao. Naturally, the world is vast, and you can place your pieces anywhere. But my clan is in Mobei. My ancestral foundation is there. I have no cause to simply abandon it."

Yehui's eyebrow twitched, his tone a mix of mockery and warning.

"Unwilling to part with that meager foundation? You'd rather they be used as chess pieces, generation after generation? Is that what you find so comforting? On this point, you and your nephew are far less insightful than Li Zhouwei. The ability to use one's Dao lineage as capital is not just a sacrificeit's a privilege. One that most people could only dream of!"

Helian Wumeng, unfamiliar with Yehui, bristled at the words. His hand on his weapon clenched and unclenched. Fortunately, a brilliant white light finally flared in the south, making his eyes light up.

"The south is breaking!"

He slammed his weapon into the ground and shot into the air, transforming into a heaven-and-earth-spanning gale of baleful wind that surged forward.

"Boom!"

In an instant, countless baleful peaks rose like a vast, dark ink-wash painting unrolling across the land of Baiye. A swirling, pitch-black Baleful Qi descended, sweeping over everything.

From the south, an enormous, multicolored light streaked across the sky to meet it. It rippled like a dazzling waterfall, kicking up a furious wind that slammed against the incoming divine ability.

"Boom!"

The multicolored light floated upward as an earthy, Wu-colored light descended. An old man materialized in the center, dressed in glazed kudzu robes. His gaze was serene, and he held a small jade mountain. His voice boomed like thunder,

"Foreign savages, how dare you act so presumptuously!"

It was Daoist Master Xianyao.

As his voice echoed, a gleaming, multicolored light shot from him.

"Subjugating Crest!"

It was an Wu Earth divine ability.

The brilliant light solidified, descending as a mountain of immortal radiance. Helian Wumeng looked up, his expression shifting. Hidden beneath his heavy helm, his eyes now glowed with an eerie, grayish-silver light.

"Clang!"

Subjugating Crest was no simple technique. It was designed to suppress the Immortal Dao. While it posed little threat to Buddhist cultivators or demon cultivators, anyone hit by it, even those of a higher cultivation, would be slammed into the ground.

Although Helian Wumeng cultivated a demonic dao, it wasn't a pure one. It wasn't an inheritance from the four demon ancestors, but was rooted in the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao. This meant he was still subject to the technique's restraints. Fortunately, he cultivated a Diverse Mansion, and his Baleful Qi was far less affected. He summoned a Spiritual Treasure and was only slammed to the ground, immobilized. The profound light erupting from his body flared like a bonfire, showing no sign of retreat. He parted his lips, his voice savage and venomous.

"You old waste, your path to the Dao is severed! A beggar from the Eastern Sea... You dare to stand here and bark?"

Daoist Master Xianyao's expression didn't change at the "severed Dao path" insult, but the moment "old beggar" left the man's lips, the elder's face darkened.

"Such insolence! My Lian clan descends from the great families of Guanzhong! When I first ascended with my divine ability and was crowned king, your Helian clan were still slaves to others..."

Before he could finish, a wisp of white qi drifted down and intercepted him. Yehui appeared, treading on a current of purple water. He sighed.

"Senior... my apologies."

With his sigh, a crushing weight of white qi streamed from his lips, coalescing into a massive, gleaming white mountain. Its appearance caused the Great Void to solidify, and all divine abilities in the area became sluggish, as if trapped in a mire.

Daoist Master Xianyao's lips pressed shut. He brought his hands together, held them to his mouth, and... also spat out a stream of white qi.

The instant his qi emerged, a second mountain rumbled into existence from the Great Void. The two peaks collided. White qi billowed like an avalanche, a spectacular, world-ending waterfall of power.

It was also Eastern Feather Mountain!

This Daoist Master Xianyao... he had actually cultivated a Capital Guard art to complete his Dao lineage!

At this sight, both Helian uncle and nephew stared, stunned. A strange look even crossed Helian Wujiang's face.

'What a crafty old fox, Xianyao. Did someone guide him... or was this truly just a wild gamble?'

Only Yehui was unsurprised.

Daoist Master Xianyao's situation was really no better than Changxi's. He had relied on Subjugating Crest to attain the Dao, true, but he had no other Dao lineage to speak of. After finally acquiring that copy of Immortal Without Flaw from Cheng Yan, he had hit a wall and could advance no further.

But the old man was decisive. Estimating he lacked the years to cross into the Purple Mystery realm, he had begun planning early, seeking a substitute path to ensure his survival. In the end, he had come to Yehui... and had taken Eastern Feather Mountain.

The two had a history, but Yehui showed no hesitation now that they were enemies. His form vanished. He reappeared behind the old man, weaving through the cascading waterfall of white qi, his brows suddenly raised.

A scorching light flared in his eyes. A mysterious radiance shot out, slamming into the back of the old man's head.

He was the one who had given him Eastern Feather Mountain; he naturally knew the critical flaw in his cultivation!

Daoist Master Xianyao's face fell. With a sharp gesture, he summoned his personal Spiritual Artifact. The jade mountain in his hand instantly magnified.

"Hanging Pass Mountain!"

The two enormous mountains of divine ability collided. Helian Wujiang's figure drifted over like a willow seed on the wind. But as he approached, a heavy, gray halo flashed. An old man rode a current of Mansion Water qi, a glacial-blue blade aimed straight at his face.

'Chen Yin of Yushui...'

Helian Wujiang's heart sank.

It wasn't that he was terrified of the man, but the news of Chen Yin being tricked by the Western Shu had spread far and wide. The little old man was now desperately reliant on the Song court. If Helian Wujiang were Yang Ruiyi, he would absolutely use this 'fine steel' at the most critical moment.

Chen Yin's presence here meant the Song's resolve was strong.

Helian Wujiang, ever-cautious, didn't dare relax. He slapped his waist. A whip, a saber, and a sword leaped out, kicking up a boundless, baleful wind.

Though Helian Wujiang had been overshadowed by Li Zhouwei in the Grotto-Heaven, he was a true powerhouse against someone like Chen Yin. His whip lashed out, binding Chen Yin's sword. His short saber darted like a phantom, while his longsword hovered in his palm, ever vigilant.

With both mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm masters engaged, Helian Wumeng stood alone amidst the roiling Baleful Qi, a cold smile playing on his lips.

Facing him were three streaks of multicolored light, each wreathed in water and fire.

The man on the left was powerfully built, his gaze like that of a dragon. He wore blue-purple martial armor, a resplendent golden sword at his waist, his face a little pale. The one in the center wore blue and white robes, his features fine and handsome, his glabella marked with a blue-purple and purple-gold sigil. The one on the right, in white and purple robes and a black cloud-patterned cloak, seemed at ease, holding a profound sword at the ready, his eyes wary.

Helian Wumeng's grayish-silver eyes reflected those three pairs of golden pupils. He burst into wild laughter, a sound so powerful it shook the entire sea of Baleful Qi.

"Interesting, this Song court!" the young man boomed. "They actually delivered all three of their 'qilin sons' right into my hands!"

His voice and his figure dissolved into the baleful sea.

"Let's see just what this Holder of the Profound rank is made of!"

Li Jiangliang's brow flashed. He snapped his profound sword up just as the demonic man materialized before him. A long-handled pole-blade, half-saber, half-spear, blazed with black light as it chopped down on his sword.

"Boom!"

The water and fire cloaking Li Jiangliang exploded. He was knocked back three steps in mid-air, his expression darkening.

"He's strong!"

Helian Wumeng was built like a tiger but moved like a viper. He spun in the air, and his pole-blade, which had vanished, suddenly leaped up from below, thrusting viciously at Li Jiangliang's throat.

Li Jiangliang felt his skin crawl, a deathly chill flooding his mind. The purple sigil on his brow flared, and his body shattered with a bang, trying to dissolve into roiling water and fire.

But Helian Wumeng was a hardened veteran. His eyes had already turned blood-red. A dense beam of baleful light shot from them, aimed straight at Li Jiangliang's face. Simultaneously, a strange pulse of energy rippled from him, causing Li Jiangliang's water-and-fire transformation to stutter, slowing him by a fatal instant.

"Boom!"

Fortunately, Li Jiangxia arrived. The water and fire in his hands flowed and solidified into a spear. It pulsed in the midst of the Baleful Qi, neutralizing the attack as it thrust toward Helian Wumeng's throat.

Helian Wumeng ignored it, even sparing a moment to glance back, his eyes full of contempt.

'Plenty of weapon skill... but not enough divine ability. He hasn't even healed from his last fight, and he dares to challenge me?'

The spear plunged forward unopposed, but it felt like stabbing a cloud of Baleful Qi. It passed straight through his throat, leaving no wound, striking only an illusion.

Thousand-Hundred Body!

Li Jiangliang grunted, retreating as a blast of water and fire.

Helian Wumeng's ape-like arm snapped back, his pole-blade reversing to slash down at Li Jiangxia. The Spiritual Artifact hadn't even arrived, but the Baleful Qi struck first, crashing down like a mountain peak.

From within his baleful eyes, a blur of golden light shot out, pinning Li Jiangxia in place. Unable to dodge, he took the full force of the blow. He was sent flying like an arrow, slamming into the ground with a sickening thud.

'Light of Great Peace and Pacification!'

But that brief delay was all Li Jianglong needed. The radiance he had drawn down from the stars finally struck Helian Wumeng's back.

Though the three were only at the Holder of the Profound rank, the light they channeled through their Martial Cultivation was anything but simple. Helian Wumeng was frozen in place. An instant later, a thick, multi-hued aura of water and fire exploded from his body. This caused Li Jianglong to turn deathly pale, as if bound by the attack. He, too, was frozen, unable to move, his aura fading at an alarming rate.

On the ground, Li Jiangxia shot back up as a streak of white light. A golden seal hovered over his head, and he appeared to be completely unharmed. With a flick of his wrist, a golden chain materialized, snaking out and binding the demon.

"Fourth Brother!" he shouted.

The three brothers knew they would be charging north into battle. How could they have come unprepared? They had not only requisitioned Spiritual Artifacts from the Song Emperor but had also specially chosen spell arts to cultivate, all for this very moment.

Li Jianglong and Li Jiangxia were famously at odds, but in a life-or-death battle, they coordinated faster than anyone. There wasn't a trace of suspicion between them; their synergy was so perfect it stunned Li Jiangliang, leaving him momentarily flustered.

He had no time to be surprised. He shut his eyes, and the sigil on his brow darkened, pulsing with power. A speck of light leaped forth.

It was a brilliant gold and a vibrant purple. At times it flickered like fire, at others it flowed like water. It lit up the battlefield, the gold as profound as sacred classics, the purple like the chant of a thousand cultivators under a rain of immortal light. It seemed slow, but it was impossibly fast, landing squarely on Helian Wumeng.

This was the true trump card they had requested for their mission: Lightless Water and Fire!

"Boom!"

A blinding immortal radiance tore into the sky. The entire baleful sea heaved, and plumes of black smoke choked the air. The caster, Li Jianglong, was thrown back three steps. The thread-thin beam of white light that bound the combatants snapped. He began to cough, vomiting blood, unable to even stand.

The golden chain shattered. A terrifying beam of white light swept across the sky, blasting Li Jianglong so hard he spat up more blood and nearly fell from the sky. Li Jiangliang used the light to teleport again. Li Jiangxia, at the center of the storm, was unaffected by the blast, but eighteen azure-glass pearls had suddenly appeared above his head, locking him in place.

Azureglass Stars of the Western General!

Helian Wumeng had clearly risked himself to lure them into this trap. He just hadn't counted on them possessing such a powerful treasure.

But the man's willpower was iron, his control over his divine abilities unshakable. Even as the spiritual fire consumed him, he used his Spiritual Artifact with the stability of a mountain. He had not only trapped Li Jiangxia, but from within the raging flames, a human figure was already stepping out.

Helian Wumeng's left arm and most of the left side of his body were engulfed in the Lightless Water and Fire. Spiritual flames licked out from within his body; his true form was clearly injured. Yet, he showed little reaction, standing in mid-air with an expression of pure surprise.

"The Great Void..."

In his senses, his connection to the Great Void, which had been ever-present, was severed completely.

The Lightless Water and Fire had also affected the Great Void. It wasn't like the Immeasurable Water and Fire, which cut it off entirely. Instead, it had singled him out, Helian Wumeng, and caused the Great Void to reject him.

This meant that until he extinguished the spiritual fire, he would lose access to all the profound mysteries of the Great Void. His three opponents, however, could still enter and exit it at will, effortlessly dodging his attacks. If the tide turned, he might not even be able to escape.

This should have been a disastrous turn of events. But the profound-armored warrior wasn't alarmed. Instead, his interest was piqued.

"Good!" he roared.

With his shout, the endless baleful sea surged anew. Mountain peaks rose from the darkness. His grim voice echoed across the land.

"Now, you will see what I am truly capable of!"

'...This...'

The white light from the sky faded. Li Jiangliang, who had been knocked tumbling ten steps away, was wreathed in baleful light, his face as white as paper. Reflected in his pupils was the demonic pole-blade, carrying with it an overwhelming tide of Baleful Qi... and a pair of demonic eyes.

The man had predicted his exact landing spot.

A spike of pure terror lanced through Li Jiangliang, and he broke out in a cold sweat.

Though he rarely left the palace, he wasn't inexperienced. He had fought the Merciful One and even crossed blades with Kong Tingyun. But the pressure from this man... it wasn't even in the same league.

'No wonder. Father, in all his nobility, broke through from the Eastern Sea and fought this man on the northern bank, but failed to capture him. He truly is a demon.'

'This... this is a true genius of the northern Daoist Traditions.'
