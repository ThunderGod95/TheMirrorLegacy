# Chapter 1025: The Mountain's Might

'Shanqing… Shanqing…'

A subtle change flickered across Li Zhouwei’s expression. He watched the old man before him, who stood with his head bowed in silence, and pressed further.

"Did he really just vanish? A figure like that, whose divine abilities were already perfected… how could he disappear so suddenly? If he had achieved a new Fruition Attainment, the heavens and earth would have shifted. The entire world would have known."

His words carried a probing edge. Cui Changfu sat stunned for a moment before leaving his seat, closing the Celestial Hall doors, and then returning to the steps, his posture uncertain.

"Your Highness is correct," he answered, his voice fraught with hesitation. "The ancient records speak of the signs for the attainment of Dui Metal, and the conditions for failure: 'There should be an early autumn, the migration of armored soldiers, a gathering of merchants, and joy throughout the world.' But… if someone did succeed, who would be able to record it? To announce it to the world for all to see, to allow it to be written down… that would require the heart of a truly sincere venerable one. Such figures are few and far between…"

Even though the ancient texts recorded no such success, his words clearly implied that the Daoist Shanqing had indeed achieved his goal and retired from the world.

'Dui Metal!'

Li Zhouwei fell silent.

Dui Metal was no obscure Dao. The Golden Feather Sect, a renowned Immortal sect that controlled a vast territory in the Yue State, was the orthodox sect of what was known as the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition. The True Monarch of the Golden Feather Sect who now walked the world had always been called the master of the Dui Metal Fruition Attainment!

'If that unfathomable Grand Preceptor truly achieved the Dao back then, and if not for the intercalary affair, he would almost certainly have been the one to claim the Dui Metal seat!'

He keenly grasped the old man's implication.

'True Monarch Taiyuan of the Golden Feather Sect… is also an enemy of Bright Yang… he cannot be trusted. If we were to revive Li Qianyuan, he would likely be the first to leap out and stop us!'

Whether this information was accurate remained to be seen; for now, it was only the Cui family's side of the story. Li Zhouwei sensed the old man was still hiding many secrets he dared not speak. His expression turned solemn as he, for the first time, asked with complete candor:

"I have one question. The Wei-Li… are they truly part of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition or not!"

Though a mountain of evidence in his heart already pointed to the answer, he needed to hear it stated plainly. The old man stared at him for a long moment before replying.

"The Wei-Li are to Encompassing Profoundity as the Great Ning Palace is to Encompassing Profoundity. If Your Highness must have an answer… then the answer is—yes!"

Li Zhouwei held his gaze, then suddenly shifted topics.

"I'm interested to hear… any ancient tales you know of Dui Metal."

Cui Changfu hastily shook his head. Though he knew exactly what Li Zhouwei was asking, he demurred.

"I dare not speak of Dui Metal, but this old one has heard some stories about Metal Virtue… Does Your Highness know of the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring?"

How could he not? When it came to familiarity with the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring, few in the mainland could compare to his own family. His own grandaunt had been transformed into a spirit by this very Dao, and to this day could not take a single step out of the Lie Sea!

He gave a slow nod. Cui Changfu's voice turned wistful.

"The Profound Thunder is based in the Northern Sea and is often called the Northern Palace Divine Thunder, but few know of the other three seas… In truth, to suppress demonic cultivators back then, the Thunder Palace established thunder Dao lineages in all four seas."

"But after the Thunder Palace was destroyed, the Profound Thunder lineage suffered a devastating blow. Most of its branches sought shelter under other Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Traditions. Among them, the Eastern Sea lineage was second only to the Northern Sea's. The first disciple of the Dams-Goat Temple Palace entered the sea to defend it and rebuild order, establishing the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring. When the Motongse Palace of the Milin Mountains Daoist Tradition emerged, they entered the Southern Sea, consolidated the thunder Dao there, and kept the name Motongse Palace… Only the Western Sea's thunder Dao was already weak; when the Northern Sea collapsed, it was annihilated the very same day, vanishing without a trace."

Cui Changfu paused, hesitating before continuing.

"And behind this Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring, there was also a great figure… His venerable title was Xu Fang of the Heavenly Thunder's Cry. He was the last venerable one to ascend the Thunder Throne, tasked with defending the Eastern Sea. He acted with great discretion and lived until the era when the Supreme Yang powers contended for their thrones…"

"It was his protection that preserved the last fragment of the Profound Thunder Daoist Tradition."

Li Zhouwei listened intently. Cui Changfu’s tone suddenly dropped.

"But when the Great Liang fell, the world descended into chaos. The Fuqi clan rose in the north, and the era of Cultivation Transcendence began… The Liang fell and the Zhao rose, and the world was pacified. But that venerable one suddenly vanished without a trace. The Thundercloud Temple, the foundation of the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring—then known as Thundercloud Divine Island—sank into the sea and was never seen again."

"In the same year, the Motongse Palace ascended in broad daylight. Eighteen islands rose from the Southern Sea, and the era of the thunder Dao's twilight finally came to an end."

Cui Changfu looked up at Li Zhouwei.

"From that moment on, the power of Dui Metal began to extinguish the remnant thunder."

'So… that's when the remnant lightning fell to the Metal virtue…'

Understanding dawned in Li Zhouwei’s mind.

'It was most likely the True Monarch of Dui Metal who made these moves… He orchestrated the rise and fall of the Qi Emperor, and he was the one who eradicated the remnant lightning.'

He recalled when Zhang Duanyan had come to the Li family to deliver the immortal decree. She had clearly and explicitly referred to Luoxia as their Upper Sect, confirming the subordinate relationship between Luoxia and the Golden Feather Sect. And since that Daoist Master Zhang was a Comprehending Profoundity figure, the matter became crystal clear.

'The reason the Daoist Shanqing was able to drive the common people like cattle was likely because he was backed by the Dao of Sheji, which opposed the Thunder Palace. Whether it was an alliance or a transaction, he probably borrowed the power of Sheji during that great upheaval, and eradicating the remnant lightning was his repayment…'

'But if that's the case, why has the Dao of Sheji never been seen?'

He pondered this for a long time before asking, "Did the Motongse Palace have any descendants? Ascending in broad daylight sounds like a sign that one's ascension has blessed all those connected to them, not like a tragic end."

Seeing his questions delve deeper, Cui Changfu grew increasingly anxious. Fortunately, this place was under the jurisdiction of the Dragon-kin, who already had poor relations with the Thunder Palace and Luoxia, so the topic was permissible. Not daring to refuse an answer, he gritted his teeth and spoke.

"The master of the Motongse Palace… was an incredible figure. He was once the premier Dao Child of the Southern Township Daoist Tradition. At the time, the Four Southern Secrets had already declined, and he was hailed as the immortal talent who would revive the Southern Township…"

"But once that Daoist Tradition reached the Southern Sea, it formally broke away from the Milin Daoist Tradition… It no longer revered Encompassing Profoundity, instead achieving the Dao through paths like Profound Qi, Upper Shaman, and Body of Kui… It was a mix of Immortal and Buddhist paths, calling itself the Motong Daoist Tradition."

"A mix of Immortal and Buddhist paths again?" Li Zhouwei asked with a frown.

This wasn't the first time he had heard of this. Legend had it that the master of the Dams-Goat Temple Palace had fallen due to combining Immortal and Buddhist ways. The Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring was based in the Thundercloud Temple, and now the Motongse Palace had also mixed the two. For this to happen repeatedly suggested a reason far from simple.

At Li Zhouwei’s question, Cui Changfu's expression dimmed.

"It's… difficult to say. The roots of this go back to more ancient times, for reasons unknown. But at the very least, two of the three most famous Daoist Traditions of Encompassing Profoundity have unclear ties to Buddhist cultivators. Only the Northern Palace thunder Dao has maintained a clearer boundary."

Cui Changfu sighed in sorrow.

"To us of the later generations, it seems like no good thing. It was bad enough that Su Xikong attained the Radiant Qi, but the Body of Kui, which also belonged to the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition, was passed down again and again until it finally ended up in the hands of Buddhist cultivators…"

He paused, as if belatedly realizing something.

"Does Your Highness know of the Body of Kui? Very few Daoist Traditions in the world know of it today…"

Li Zhouwei, of course, knew of this dao lineage of the Zhao Emperor. He nodded for him to continue. Cui Changfu immediately apologized and went on.

"The Motongse Palace did leave a legacy… Over half of the major Daoist Traditions in the Southern Sea inherited something from them… such as the Southern Songzhou Luoshe and the Great Konghai Temple… The Southern Sea Daoist Traditions forming their own distinct system originates from this."

These were familiar names. Li Zhouwei's heart steadied as he listened to Cui Changfu continue through gritted teeth.

"There are things I didn't dare say in the past, but it matters little now. To speak frankly… my family also has a long history. Your Highness… have you heard of the Miao Family of Thunder-Hearing Island? They have an ancestor named Miao Dushan, rumored to be a genius who combined the thunder Dao with the demonic Dao."

Li Zhouwei’s eyes narrowed. Cui Changfu sneered.

"I've heard rumors that this Miao Dushan is not so impressive. The world is full of geniuses, but none are that talented! How could a young man possibly merge the thunder Dao with the utterly incompatible demonic Dao? If he truly possessed such Dao-Profundity, he'd be sitting on a Golden Core throne by now, and we'd all be addressing him as 'Your Excellency'. Why would he be repeatedly thwarted in the mainland?!"

"The word among our families is that he obtained some secret art that inspired him, and from it, he derived his own path. He has some genius, yes, but not enough to defy all logic."

Li Zhouwei's eyes narrowed further.

"You mean to say… he obtained a profound Daoist Tradition from the Motongse Palace, and not daring to reveal it, he used it as a foundation to write the arts of Thunder Island?"

Cui Changfu fell into a grim silence, a clear admission.

The story of the Motongse Palace and the scandal of Thunder-Hearing Island were unremarkable when considered separately. But linked together… the implication was extraordinary.

If Miao Dushan truly obtained an ancient inheritance and used it to create a method for demonic thunder cultivation, and if that inheritance came from the Motongse Palace… what did that mean? Inheritances are never passed down without reason. The Dao Child of Motongse Palace was clearly from an Encompassing Profoundity background, yet he broke ties with them, ascended in broad daylight, and became a True Monarch… It was likely all connected to this demonic thunder cultivation method!

A shock went through Li Zhouwei.

'It's likely that this former Dao Child… if not outright defecting to Comprehending Profoundity, at least betrayed the Thunder Palace. He used any means necessary to achieve the Dao, and in doing so, carved out a path completely contrary to the brilliant might of heavenly power… From then on, a path of demonic thunder cultivation existed. The Miao Family and Miao Dushan were simply following a road that had already been paved!'

Cui Changfu stood with his head bowed, but Li Zhouwei understood his meaning perfectly.

'This figure was likely aligned with Comprehending Profoundity, which means… the true power of Luoxia might extend from the mainland all the way to the Southern Sea… another Golden Core-level force to contend with…'

'The might of Comprehending Profoundity is truly terrifying… No wonder the Dragon-kin, despite their dominance, have never controlled the Southern Sea as openly as they do the Eastern Sea, their authority there existing in name only… No wonder the Dragon-kin, who treat noble clans like slaves and wield their divine abilities like weapons, are confined to the Eastern Sea!'

'The fear of the Cui clan… it all stems from this.'

He remained silent for a long time. Cui Changfu spoke in a low voice.

"As for what happened after that, my family's records are unclear. After all, with our Purple Mansion Realm cultivators falling one after another, we lost the qualifications to know of matters at a higher level."

Li Zhouwei nodded and took a sip of tea.

"The Cui clan has not had it easy over the years. I came here this time not to ask for spiritual items or resources. Firstly, I came to ask about this history. Secondly, I wish to exchange for your clan's cultivation arts."

Cui Changfu was clearly prepared for this. He nodded silently.

"Our clan's inheritance comes from the Wei-Li and the Dongli Sect. It was originally taken from the palace and the army. To return it to its rightful owner is only natural. It isn't ours to begin with, so we wouldn't dare ask for an exchange."

Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes swept over him. "You will not be shortchanged. Accept what is given."

"Furthermore," he added, a slight smile gracing his lips. His golden eyes seemed to glow, and the aura of his entire face shifted from fierce to majestic.

"If your family refuses any payment, you'll only worry about following in the footsteps of your predecessors."

No matter how respectful Cui Changfu appeared, he couldn't escape that fear. At Li Zhouwei's words, he was rendered speechless. He opened his mouth to speak but could form no reply.

Li Zhouwei was bound by the fate of Bright Yang, but his constant emphasis on the terror of Comprehending Profoundity revealed his own deep-seated fear of Luoxia. Li Zhouwei's words struck right at his vulnerability.

'If I truly give him my all, on the day he falls, when the powers on the mountain come to settle scores, will any Dragon King be there to protect my clan? Which great lord could possibly save us?'

'And taking a step back, even if the mountain doesn't settle scores, if he truly shakes the foundation of Bright Yang, won't the Dragon-kin settle scores themselves?!'

From Cui Changfu's perspective, Li Zhouwei's offer was a lifeline. He felt an impulse to refuse, but the words wouldn't come. He could only turn his head and call out in a pained voice, "Jueyin, go and bring everything for His Highness."

Cui Changfu's choice of messenger was brilliant. Cui Jueyin was practically a member of the Li family. By not giving any prior instructions and simply sending him, he was signaling that he would bring out everything the clan possessed, proving that nothing was held back.

Cui Jueyin, who had listened to the entire exchange with a calm expression, retreated from the hall. Cui Changfu then rose, bowed deeply, and said in a choked voice, "Thank you… Your Highness!"

"Sit down. No need for all the bowing."

Li Zhouwei waved a hand, his gaze fixed on him.

"I have never blamed your Cui family. Situated in Chongzhou, with the fate of a million clansmen on your shoulders, decisions are not made by one person alone. As for Daoist Master Yangya… I have met him in the Grotto-Heaven. You have now achieved your own success, and Chongzhou has its own master. You no longer need to be constrained by him."

"Your Highness!"

Cui Changfu didn't know how to respond. Fortunately, Cui Jueyin returned quickly. He bowed before the steps and presented three gleaming jade slips and a stone talisman.

Cui Changfu hurriedly turned, holding one sleeve with one hand while presenting the items with the other in a gesture of extreme humility.

"This is the Audience Jade Talisman, the key to my Chongzhou Cui clan's inheritance. It records the Upper Mansion Audience Scripture, the treasured foundation of our family. It is a high fifth-grade art, containing three secret methods… for achieving Audience with the Celestial Gate! It was passed down from the Immortal Mansion of old."

"Because of this, the talisman is of exceptionally high quality, crafted from the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual material known as Flawless Body Jade. It's a top-tier Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, incorruptible and indestructible, with its divine light concealed within. Should our clan ever face annihilation, a junior could carry it out without attracting notice for possessing a great treasure, thus preventing its loss…"

Li Zhouwei glanced at it but was skeptical of its stated purpose. He shook his head.

"Your family's understanding of this inheritance is flawed… This isn't an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact. It's a degenerated spirit embryo. Now that you have attained a divine ability, it would be best if you had a secret method to refine it. If not, you could spend thirty to fifty years refining it, and it could serve as a protective Dharma Treasure."

Cui Changfu was stunned. He never imagined his family's heirloom had such a function. Overjoyed, he thanked him profusely, took the item in his hands, and said respectfully, "I wish to offer this item to Your Highness!"

Li Zhouwei simply shook his head. If Li Ximing didn't have Sichuan, this item might have been suitable for his family, but now it was redundant. He pushed it back and simply read the Upper Mansion Audience Scripture.

'It is indeed Audience with the Celestial Gate, but different from my family's version… It lacks some of the imperial majesty and the killing intent of a border pass that the Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art possesses. It has more of the ethereal style of the Immortal Dao, suited for cultivation in an Immortal Mansion…'

'As for these secret methods…'

Li Zhouwei frowned as he read, but a hint of satisfaction grew in his heart.

'Regardless, it's three secret methods. I can leave them in the family for the younger cultivators to study. It will be a fine addition.'

This could be used by the younger generation for reference. In the future, descendants with a suitable disposition would be better served by cultivating this art. Li Zhouwei casually tossed the jade talisman back into his hands. Cui Changfu immediately pointed to another jade slip.

"This one is the fourth-grade Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass."

Cui Jueyin immediately raised an eyebrow. "Daoist Master Zhaojing has already taken a copy of this in exchange for a favor to our clan!"

Cui Changfu paused, then nodded and moved his hand. "The remaining two… one is the Bright Origin Contemplating Fire Scripture, left by Daoist Master Yangya the last time he returned to the island. He traded for it from another cultivator. Its origin is the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven… However… it is of the Eternal Brightness Steps path, not the Imperial Observation of the Origin."

Li Zhouwei calmly took it and glanced through it.

'What a coincidence. My family has a copy as well, though only the Foundation Establishment Realm portion. It was a gift from the Profound Peak Gate back in the day… and it came from the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven.'

He raised an eyebrow.

"It seems Yangya didn't take from you for free. He left something behind after all… Looks like he didn't want to be too indebted to you!"

"Yes… yes…"

The words were blunt but accurate. Cui Changfu looked embarrassed. He glanced at Li Zhouwei's face and continued his introduction.

"The various paths of Bright Yang, whether high-grade or low, all share the same root. The only differences are in their divine abilities and the strength of their dharma power. But the Imperial Observation of the Origin is unique. The Eternal Brightness Steps path was derived by many past sages from the 'Memorial on the Completion of Rites at Mount Taishi in the Northern Lands', personally written by High Radiance True Monarch. Their foundations are fundamentally different."

Li Zhouwei was very familiar with this concept. The 'Courtyard Guard' art he had first obtained was the same. It seemed to be from the same source, but in reality, it was worlds apart, even possessing the ability to command its lesser counterparts.

'I see. It's possible the 'Courtyard Guard' was also derived from some dharma text written by the original master of Jade True…'

Cui Changfu took a step forward.

"This last one is a secret art of our family, called the Art of the Perfected Sleeve Residence. It is an art from the Immortal Mansions, left behind by a senior who once piloted a Treasure Ship. It was a technique he was borrowing to study. When trouble arose in his state, he rushed back, but fearing the art would be lost, he left it with our ancestor…"

Li Zhouwei's interest was finally piqued. He took the item and read it carefully.

"Hmm?" he murmured.

"The Art of the Sleeve Residence?"

"Precisely!" Cui Changfu’s face showed a hint of envy.

"This is an ancient cultivation method, a divine path practiced by those who follow the way of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature. One can cultivate a residence within one's sleeve to store treasures, eliminating the need for a storage pouch. With advanced cultivation, one can even draw living creatures into the sleeve with a flick of the wrist."

"The art even describes that if one reaches the level of its creator, a flick of the sleeve could collect an opponent's spell arts, dharma light, or even spiritual fire and water!"

Li Zhouwei began to read, impressed. He read for more than ten breaths, but still couldn't see the end.

'It's just like those other arts for ingesting qi… astonishingly difficult. I fear an ordinary Purple Mansion Realm cultivator couldn't even read it through, let alone master it… Even a Great Daoist Master would struggle!'

'But its value is immense. It's in the same category as the Great Void-walking technique of those northern Grotto-Heaven cultivators—something you can only hope to encounter by chance, priceless and unobtainable!'

However, possessing Talisman Qi, Li Zhouwei was not intimidated by the difficulty. He spent some time memorizing it before nodding.

"I won't take advantage of you just because you've newly reached the Purple Mansion Realm. This is a rare and valuable item."

Cui Changfu quickly replied, "Your Highness is mistaken. Even if this item remained in my family for one or two hundred years, not a single person would be able to even begin learning it. We have had so many Purple Mansion Realm ancestors, yet none have succeeded! Since we cannot use it, it can't be considered a valuable item!"

"Your point is valid, but that doesn't erase its intrinsic value," Li Zhouwei said, shaking his head.

"Back when my family had just produced a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, my grand-uncle was also in a tight spot and owed a favor. I assume your family can't and dares not use this anyway, so I won't hold you to it."

With a flick of his wrist, he produced a jade box from his sleeve and placed it in Cui Changfu's hands, gesturing for him to open it.

Cui Changfu hesitated before opening the box. A wave of Bright Yang Qi rushed out. On a soft, white brocade cushion rested three wondrous spirit pills covered in shimmering scales, their brilliant light dazzling his eyes.

'Purple Mansion Realm spirit pills! Purple Mansion Realm spirit pills of the Bright Yang Dao!'

Cui Changfu had no idea of their true value, but Li Ximing's alchemy was superb. The wondrous fluctuations emanating from them made him covetous. A mix of shock and joy filled his heart, and he quickly said in alarm, "I absolutely cannot accept this!"

"Say no more!" Li Zhouwei waved his hand and produced another jade box, his expression serious. "My grand-uncle's favor is worth far more than three spirit pills. I have only one condition: one of these three pills must be given to Jueyin to help him break through to the Purple Mansion Realm."

Cui Changfu's expression turned solemn. He raised his hands in a salute and said earnestly, "To be honest, Jueyin is the one in our family with the greatest hope of breaking through. Even if Your Highness hadn't mentioned it, I would have certainly reserved two of these three pills for the younger generation, and one of them would have been for Jueyin!"

Li Zhouwei nodded and passed the box over.

"There is also a cultivation art here, the Heavenly Beard Polished Metal Sutra. It's a fifth-grade Geng Metal art. Gathering the required qi might be a bit troublesome for you—you'll need to find famous mountains or gold mines… but it's one of the simplest to practice. You should be able to find what you need on some of the larger islands… Cultivating an art from another Dao will give you more options."

Li Zhouwei had many Purple Mansion Realm cultivation arts, but they were either inconvenient to share, having been traded from others, or the qi was too difficult to gather even for the Li family. Only this one had been obtained from another source, was easy to cultivate, and was already known to several parties, so its secrets were few. It was perfect for him.

An easily cultivated Purple Mansion Realm art was enough to be the foundational treasure of an entire sect! Moreover, it was high-grade and could fill a gap in the family's arts. Cui Changfu was stunned, then overcome with ecstatic joy. He couldn't help but reach out and take it, clutching it like a priceless treasure. But Li Zhouwei wasn't finished. He produced a jade talisman shimmering with immortal light.

"This is the Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman, a Spiritual Artifact of the Capital Guard! It's best used with a famous river or a large island, which makes it suitable for you here in Chongzhou. This is in exchange for your Art of the Perfected Sleeve Residence and the Bright Origin Contemplating Fire Scripture."

As he spoke, profound patterns on the talisman lit up in response, casting a brilliant radiance across the old man's face.

'A Spiritual Artifact?!'

'This is a Spiritual Artifact!'

Chongzhou was not without Spiritual Artifacts, but theirs had been lost with the Treasure Ship in the mainland. Only a mediocre protective treasure had remained, and that too was lost during the destruction of the Dongli Sect… They hadn't seen such a treasure in years! With this in hand, once he refined the spirit embryo and consumed the spirit pills, he could immediately secure his footing in the early stage of the Purple Mansion Realm!

'His Highness is so magnanimous! This is the bearing of an imperial scion!'

Cui Changfu was already dazed by the string of treasures. He clutched the cultivation art like a holy relic, but his eyes were glued to the Spiritual Artifact, his heart pounding. His lips trembled, unable to form words of refusal.

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes, however, weren't on him. He was looking at Cui Jueyin with a faint smile, sighing inwardly.

'After this, Jueyin will surely command the greatest respect… His talent, intellect, and methods are all top-tier, and he serves under me often. He has a high chance of breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm. When that day comes, this Spiritual Artifact will ultimately end up in his hands…'

His gaze lowered, and a private smile touched his lips.

'A fitting legacy to leave behind.'
