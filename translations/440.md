# Chapter 601: Morality

Li Xuanfeng and Xiao Yongling descended the mountain together. On their way up, they had rushed and not paid much attention, but now, as they reached the foot of the mountain, they noticed a small platform. Scattered across it were six ancient lamp stands, lying askew.

These lamp stands, dark gray and simple, were mostly broken into pieces. Evidently, they had once held treasures that had drawn intense competition, leaving behind clear traces of battle.

Reaching the platform's edge, the two stepped onto the wind and flew toward the sea of clouds. Xiao Yongling spoke softly, a trace of wonder in his tone, "This Green Pine Grotto Heaven... originally named Mirrored Mirage, was established by the ancient immortal cultivator Yingze. It is also the last remnant of the Green Pine Dao lineage. My family's ancestor once said that Yingze carried both the powers of the Supreme Yin and the Supreme Yang, thus earning the name Yingze."

Xiao Yongling continued, "When he created this grotto heaven, his cultivation had already reached its peak. He sought transcendence and aimed to find a new path between the Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang... But in the end, he perished, and there was no further news of him."

Li Xuanfeng gazed at the vast sea of clouds below his feet, pondering for a few moments. He hesitated to ask if this immortal's surname was Lu, wary of revealing too much with Golden Core Realm cultivators present. Instead, he asked, "If the sea of clouds above and below represents different layers, would there not also be treasures hidden in the lower layer if we have already taken them from above?"

Xiao Yongling paused momentarily before explaining, "I had a similar thought when I entered. I came across a small peak that was deserted, where I found a jade slip with a spell. After retrieving it, I returned to the sea of clouds below, only to find that the peak had become completely barren."

Li Xuanfeng considered this briefly before murmuring, "Perhaps we are all within the lower realm, each searching for our own opportunities, while the upper realm is merely a projection..."

When Li Xuanfeng had entered the grotto heaven, he had immediately descended into the sea of clouds, believing he was in the lower realm. Thus, he voiced this deduction. Opposite him, Xiao Yongling frowned and replied, "This is the lower realm? I have traversed this space several times, only to return to where I first entered..."

Li Xuanfeng looked at him, and a look of shock gradually appeared on his face. Meanwhile, Xiao Yongling's expression became increasingly uneasy. Li Xuanfeng spoke softly, "Senior, please wait here. Let me go down and take a look."

He rode the wind and dove headfirst into the sea of clouds. After just a single breath of time, he emerged from the lower edge of the cloud layer, now inverted, and ascended once more, riding the wind upward.

Before him stood a middle-aged man clad in white, a sword at his waist—it was Xiao Yongling!

The Xiao Yongling before him clutched his sleeve, his expression puzzled as he looked at Li Xuanfeng. In a calm tone, he said, "I thought you would investigate for a while longer. I did not expect you to return so quickly after just diving down. Did you discover anything?"

Li Xuanfeng was struck with alarm and replied in a low voice, "Who are you...?!"

Xiao Yongling frowned, sensing that something was amiss. Li Xuanfeng came to a realization, silently retreated a step, and once again plunged into the sea of clouds.

He took another breath of time to pass through the dense gray clouds, flying upward on the wind. As he emerged, there was yet another Xiao Yongling standing above the sea of clouds. Li Xuanfeng's expression turned complex as he gazed at this Xiao Yongling hovering above. In a quiet voice, he said, "I will remain here. Senior, why not go down and take a look for yourself?"

Xiao Yongling's face darkened slightly. After a moment's hesitation, he gave a brief nod and descended into the sea of clouds. Li Xuanfeng fixed his gaze on him, watching as yet another Xiao Yongling rose from the clouds below. This figure turned around, and the sword, which had been strapped to his left side, remained exactly in place.

Xiao Yongling stood in silence for a moment, his disbelief evident. Finally, he spoke, "Could it be... that this is an illusion? It appears as though we are diving into the clouds, but in reality, we are being transported back by some kind of maze formation... giving us the sensation of traversing two realms."

Li Xuanfeng shook his head slightly and said, "Senior, ride the wind down again. This time, look carefully at the stars in the lower realm."

Xiao Yongling nodded, descending once more. From beneath the clouds rose yet another Xiao Yongling. This figure lifted his head to the sky, his face marked with shock. "The stars above and below are indeed reversed... This is not the same realm. Entering this grotto heaven has created a shadow of ourselves in the lower world..."

"What just occurred on that mountain... it has been mirrored below the clouds, completely intact!" Li Xuanfeng remained silent. He had initially assumed that the reflections conjured by the grotto heaven would differ, akin to the inversion of stars between the realms. Yet, as it turned out, they were perfectly identical.

Once Xiao Yongling had processed his astonishment, Li Xuanfeng softly remarked, "But... how can we be certain... that we ourselves are not merely reflections projected by this grotto heaven?"

The two spent some time experimenting, diving in and out of the sea of clouds. No matter how many times they moved, the figures above and below were indistinguishable. When one descended from the upper realm, the other ascended from the lower. If not for the precautions they had taken to coordinate beforehand, it would have been impossible to tell the difference.

Xiao Yongling fell silent, staring at the sea of clouds in a daze for what felt like dozens of breaths. Finally, with a hint of despair, he murmured, "The divine abilities of ancient cultivators... their power truly defies comprehension."

————

Tu Longjian charged into the hall and seized an item before swiftly exiting. Riding the wind, he flew across the cloud sea for some time. Li Yuanjiao had already revealed his figure, having never entered the mountain. Instead, he had been waiting in the cloud sea all along.

Li Yuanjiao stood amidst the sea of clouds, refraining from joining the fray below. Instead, he focused on identifying Yu Muxian's figure and scrutinizing the overwhelming aura emanating from the person standing beside him. A heavy pressure weighed on his heart. "Two cultivators at the late Foundation Establishment Realm... Who knows what sort of protective artifacts Yu Muxian has on him..."

Tang Shedu stayed close by Yu Muxian's side, not straying a single step. If Yu Muxian were to be killed, it would require dealing with Tang Shedu as well. Li Yuanjiao silently acknowledged that his own strength might not be sufficient for such a task.

His expression darkened. At that moment, Tu Longjian returned triumphantly, clearly pleased with himself. Noticing Li Yuanjiao's troubled demeanor, he spoke up, "Senior, what troubles you?"

Li Yuanjiao's concern was evident, his voice steady but heavy. "I spotted an old enemy... He is already at the late Foundation Establishment Realm. It makes me worry for the future."

Tu Longjian observed him carefully, noting the fine beads of sweat glistening on his forehead. He lowered his gaze thoughtfully. After they flew together for a short distance, Tu Longjian softly said, "Senior... I have never forgotten the kindness you showed me in the past. Would you care to share the details?"

He paused briefly, watching as Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist in a respectful salute and murmured a word of thanks. Tu Longjian then continued, "May I ask who it is?"

"Yu Muxian of Yuanwu Peak," Li Yuanjiao stated plainly.

As soon as the name was uttered, Tu Longjian fell into a prolonged silence. It was only after what felt like an eternity that he finally spoke, his tone subdued. "That man carries Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifacts... and not just one."

Li Yuanjiao's eyelids twitched. He silently rested his hand on the hilt of his sword, his thoughts racing, This complicates matters...

Tu Longjian hesitated for several breaths, his gaze lingering on Li Yuanjiao. At last, he quietly asked, "Senior... why do you need to kill him?"

Li Yuanjiao recounted the enmity between the Yu and Li families in broad strokes. After a brief moment of hesitation, he added, "For the Li Family to advance further—whether it be for territory or influence—this man must die. If he reaches the Purple Mansion Realm, our family's position will be crushed. Yu Muxian is heartless and ruthless; he will not hold back."

Tu Longjian pondered his words for a moment, his expression becoming slightly inscrutable. Finally, he murmured, "In the end, it is all a matter of interest—taking lives for the sake of gain."

Li Yuanjiao fell silent for a moment, his voice turning hoarse. "You are correct... Yu Muxian entered Azure Pond Sect at the age of eight. He has spent his years in secluded cultivation. I have never heard of him harming others..."

His vision dimmed slightly, his Immortal Foundation wavering. A wave of fear crept into his heart, filling him with a sense of helplessness. Beads of cold sweat gathered on his face, dripping steadily. He finally broke the silence, his voice trembling slightly.

"People like us are not like you. Our lives are spent walking on a knife's edge. The things we do... they are far from honorable. We kill for wealth, for self-preservation, for family... And sometimes, the people we kill do not deserve to die."

"I have lost count of how many lives I have taken. I do not fear death, nor do I claim to follow a righteous path. I do not weigh sins against virtues. My family has shed blood at Moongaze Lake, and among those who perished, not all were guilty."

"The road to the Dao stretches endlessly forward. Do you think every obstacle in the way is a despicable villain? No. The path to power is not paved with ethereal purity and celestial grace. My family... we are merely struggling to survive."

Li Yuanjiao stood with his hands clasped behind his back, the sharp blade at his waist emitting a faint hum. A cooling sensation spread through his Shenyang Mansion, gradually calming his turbulent emotions. His tone softened as he continued, "I do not offer this as an excuse. I am simply not a virtuous man. My family treats mortals and rogue cultivators kindly. We do not cultivate through blood qi, and I rarely harm others without cause. But when the survival of my family is at stake, I cannot afford to retreat."

Tu Longjian stared at him blankly before responding, "Senior, you misunderstand me..."

He fell silent for several breaths, as if he had more to say. However, before the words could leave his lips, a deep, resonant drumbeat reverberated through the heavens.

Boom!

Both men instinctively turned their gazes skyward. Amidst the vast sea of stars, a brilliant white light emerged, scattering clouds as it descended. Amid the glittering starlight, a jade wall slowly rose into view.

The jade wall was covered in dense engravings, etched with countless names. Amidst the hazy clouds, it appeared blurred and indistinct. Several streaks of light rose from the horizon, heading toward the jade wall.

Boom!

A second deep drumbeat echoed through the air. Tu Longjian hurriedly said, "Senior! The Three Drums Wall is descending. Let us go observe it first. We can discuss this matter later!"

The two of them soared into the sky, Tu Longjian's hand gently brushing over the black-red token at his waist as his spiritual sense stirred. What madness is this? Why would you use your divine ability to influence him!

The token flickered faintly, transmitting a weak spiritual response, You are the one who's mad! Why would you provoke that Yu Muxian! I know someone like you, still clinging to notions of old debts. If I act to deter him and make him retreat on his own, wouldn't that be perfect? But alas, my strength has waned... and this man's will is solid... he actually broke free of it on his own...

Tu Longjian's anger flared but there was no opportunity to lash out, so he could only sulk as he flew higher into the clouds, glancing into the distance.

The skies were already filled with figures, their forms scattered within the cloud layers. Many familiar faces hovered silently in the mist, all intently watching the jade wall, waiting. Tu Longjian turned to Li Yuanjiao behind him and said softly, "This is an opportunity open to all... Senior, let us wait a moment."

The two stood in midair for some time. Slowly, the veil of mist shrouding the jade wall dispersed, revealing a massive surface inscribed with tightly packed ancient characters. At a glance, all the markings on the jade wall appeared to be names of techniques.

The sight in the clouds was spectacular. Nearly all those within the grotto heaven had gathered here, their robes and garments of every color glimmering in the light of their dharma artifacts and spirit tools. Each cultivator stood frozen, hands forming incantations, their gazes fixed on the jade wall.

Boom!

The third drumbeat reverberated at last. None dared to move as two figures materialized before the jade wall.

One figure was tall and clad in ancient white robes, cascading downward in flowing lines with two pale sashes hanging loosely at his sides. His face was obscured by a hazy aura, and golden-white halos rippled outward behind his head, marking him as no ordinary being.

The other appeared to be a youth, sitting cross-legged atop a cloud with his feet dangling freely. He leaned lazily against the Three Drums Wall, holding a jade pot in one hand and casually pouring its contents into his mouth. His face, too, was veiled in indistinct mist, while his other hand rested on his knee.

The youth spoke softly, "I have always had a question I cannot resolve. I wonder if Senior might enlighten me."

The standing figure gave a slight nod.

The youth asked, "Does morality truly exist in this world?"

"I have wandered across Jiangnan and the Eastern Seas, witnessing countless people and countless events. Conflicts in this world stem first from gain, second from emotion, and only third from morality." He continued, "Forget about good and evil. Killing someone to advance one's cultivation—could that be considered moral?"

The white-robed figure shook his head definitively. The youth chuckled and pressed on, "If killing to cultivate is immoral, then what about killing to seize treasure—can that be called moral?"

The white-robed figure gave a faint shake of his head.

The youth persisted, "Then is it moral to harm and kill in the name of stealing another's heritage or dharma artifact? If it is immoral to harm and kill for the sake of theft, then enslaving others must also be immoral. If enslaving others is immoral, then renting land to tenants and collecting taxes or tributes must likewise be acts of exploitation! Buying cheap and selling high, extorting excessive profits—are these not also violations of morality?"

The youth's voice remained light and airy, "In that case, let me ask you, Senior: Since the dawn of human society, when has the ruling class ever possessed morality? And when have the ruled ever followed morality?"

The white-robed figure gently shook his head and replied, "It is precisely because human hearts are mired in greed that we, who are blessed by the heavens and earth, must act to set the world right. We are tasked with correcting humanity and nurturing our own morality... to enter the world and cultivate by upholding justice."

The young man straightened his back, his gaze fixed on the figure before him, and his tone grew cold and stern, "If we go by what you have just said, the Wei State is still cultivating Bright Yang, with its system of three wives and four concubines. They have established an imperial hierarchy, centralizing power into a single figure and enforcing a rigid structure of reverence and submission. Where, then, is the concept of governance through noninterference? In today's world, when have cultivators ever shown any true morality?"

He let out a cold laugh. "So this is your logic: cultivate immortality, cultivate immortality... but no matter what we cultivators do, we are born guilty! As long as there is injustice and inequality in this world, it can all be blamed on us. And then what? So what? What does it have to do with me?"

His tone was icy, and though he addressed the figure before him as senior, there was no hint of reverence in his words, only audacious defiance.

The figure in white spoke softly, "In ancient times, men and women mingled freely, and they felt no shame in being without clothing; union itself was considered morality. In the distant past, when heaven and earth had no order, treasures were claimed by the capable, and that, too, was morality. Today, under imperial rule, the authority of rulers and parents is morality. Morality, like the fruits of the Dao, is ever-changing. It is not a static thing."

"Oh?" The young man burst into laughter, his laughter rolling out uncontrollably, his body swaying with amusement.

The figure in white merely stood there in silence, observing him until the young man finally subdued his laughter. When he spoke again, his voice carried a biting edge, "So, senior, your so-called morality is like dandelion fluff in the wind, changing at every whim! You keep your eyes fixed on the heavens, bowing to the celestial tribulations above, letting them dictate everything. With reins through your nose like an old ox plowing a field, you move wherever you are directed!"

His tone turned chilling, his words laden with scorn, "Then remember this, senior—perhaps someday, killing others to cultivate will also be considered morality! After all, the fault lies not with me, but with the times, with the heavens themselves!"
