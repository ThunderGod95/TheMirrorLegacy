# Chapter 538: Green Pine Temple

The robust young man sat upright in the courtyard, his fingers forming hand seals. Black flames churned from his palms, spreading in ripples around him. Dark runes flickered like streams of light around him, weaving and twisting through the air by his side.

Li Xijun cast a brief glance his way, wary of being noticed. He averted his gaze and monitored the young man from the corner of his eye.

Chengliao wasn't affected by him, meaning this person isn't on the same level as Chu Yi. There likely isn't a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator behind the scenes controlling him either. It's possible he carries a thread of fate, stumbled upon some hidden legacy, or received guidance from a skilled master.

Li Xijun refrained from acting hastily and first summoned Chen Mufeng.

"The Jade Court Guards patrolling the area are too concentrated—it might raise suspicion. Spread them out along the borders. His lover is still on the mountain; I will have Senior Wushao personally keep an eye on Xu Xiao," he instructed.

Chen Mufeng's heart was full of bitterness, thinking only of making amends and avoiding demotion.

At the time, he had only sent a trusted confidant, Captain Chen, his kinsman, to handle matters. Now, Chen Mufeng had quietly reassigned Captain Chen to Mount Yue to distance him from the events in town, intending to deal with him once the situation was resolved.

After voicing his acknowledgment, Chen Mufeng hurried off to carry out the orders.

Li Chengliao had initially granted Liu Lingzhen access to cultivate on the mountain, intending to drive a wedge and win her over. Yet now, it had inadvertently placed her within the grasp of the Li Family. Li Xijun assigned two people to question her discreetly, then turned to Li Wushao, "Senior, do you know of any sect techniques involving black flames, preferably ones capable of manipulating minds or threatening lives?"

Li Xijun was well-acquainted with the factions in Wu and Yue States and knew them thoroughly. However, he had never seen anything like this black flame—capable of beguiling minds and toying with lives—leading him to suspect it might originate from overseas influences.

Li Wushao thought for a moment, hissing as he spoke, "There are countless Dao lineages on the seas, and those sunken to the ocean floor are even more numerous. As for black flames... there is indeed one that is quite famous."

He paused for a moment, then added gravely, "Crimson Reef Island, a significant power on the seas. Their direct disciples cultivate Merging Fire, one of the Fire Virtue, and are known for breathing black flames laced with spells that confuse minds and cast sinister curses."

"Crimson Reef Island..."

Li Xijun's primary concern was whether this individual was a pawn of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. However, there had been no word from Li Xizhi's end. Given the current strength of the Li Family, any Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would have informed them before taking action, rather than stirring trouble in secret.

With no incoming news and given the limits of Xu Xiao's abilities, murderous intent rose in Li Xijun's heart. He suspected that someone was using Xu Xiao to disrupt his family. Yet, the Li Family had no prior conflict with Crimson Reef Island, making the situation uncertain. He summoned one of his men and ordered, "Find a clever female cultivator and have her extract some information from Liu Lingzhen—subtly. Gauge her stance on the immortal sects and gates."

The subordinate hesitated but nodded, leaving with several capable assistants. It was clear that he did not fully grasp Li Xijun's intent, prompting Li Xijun to elaborate, "Send a female cultivator to casually talk about some overseas sects. Drop a few deliberate errors—make it sound convincing but irritating. See if Liu Lingzhen can catch the mistakes and determine her attitude toward the sects."

After making these arrangements, Li Xijun refrained from acting hastily. He intended to probe further, delaying matters until the ancestors returned.

"If he leaves without incident, that would be ideal... but if he bears a grudge, we cannot let him go."

Li Xijun lingered in the sky, feeling deeply unsettled. Only he possessed the perception technique needed to pierce through illusions. He found a vantage point on Lijing Peak, where he could oversee the entire town below.

The night passed.

The next morning, a subordinate arrived on a gust of wind and reported respectfully, "My Lord, as you instructed, we sent someone to speak with Liu Lingzhen. She has revealed some information."

Following Li Xijun's orders, the female cultivator approached Liu Lingzhen arrogantly, showing off and casually mentioning some details about the outer seas. Liu Lingzhen, naive as she was, could not stand the boasting and retorted.

The subordinate reported, "She pointed out the mistakes made by the two agents we sent, exposing them easily. Once she started talking, she could not stop and spoke highly of the sects, even describing some of their artifacts in detail."

Xu Xiao may be cautious, but his lover is all appearance and no substance... she's left us far too many clues.

These remarks were swiftly relayed to Li Xijun. The mention of the outer seas stirred thoughts in his mind, prompting him to mutter, "A girl who has never set foot outside this town somehow knows about the artifacts of overseas sects...?"

With this information in hand, many possibilities were eliminated. The most likely scenario was that Xu Xiao had a thread of fate upon him, stumbling upon Crimson Reef Island's inheritance and falling under its influence—or he might even be a vessel possessed by someone from the island.

If Xu Xiao truly had deep connections to Crimson Reef Island, it could involve a rare technique for avoiding death through reincarnation, making him an even greater threat and harder to eliminate.

Li Xijun considered this possibility for a moment before dismissing it, "If it really is a reincarnation technique, the matter should have been made public. If he had informed us, the Li Family would have ensured his safe return to the island... unless he is some kind of rogue disciple."

His thoughts raced, circling through numerous possibilities. The more he pondered, the harder it became to judge the situation. Exhaling slowly, he turned his mind to the enigma surrounding reincarnation.

"No matter what, it is clear that he is tied to Crimson Reef Island."

Setting aside his concerns, Li Xijun flipped through the records handed to him by his subordinates, reviewing Xu Xiao's recent activities in detail. He had to admit that Xu Xiao's temperament and behavior suggested a growing resentment toward the Li Family—perhaps even greed.

Li Xijun found it intolerable for someone with a thread of fate to harbor ill will toward his family while remaining outside their control. Such a person posed a greater danger than a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator lurking nearby. If the situation escalated to that point, offending Crimson Reef Island might be unavoidable—Xu Xiao would have to be eliminated.

"Just because someone has a thread of fate does not mean they cannot be killed..."

As Li Xijun ran his hand along the hilt of his sword, murderous intent simmered within him. Suppressing it, he muttered to himself, "To deal with someone like this, you either hold back entirely or strike with full force, ensuring they have no chance to escape."

He stood up, calculating how long it would take for the senior family members to return. But with them far away on unpredictable journeys across the seas, Xu Xiao grew stronger with each passing day—waiting any longer might not be an option.

As these thoughts swirled in his mind, another subordinate rushed in and reported, "My Lord, that devil cultivator just took a large barrel of medicinal herbs! We do not know what kind of spell he intends to perform!"

The Li Family treated Xu Xiao with great caution. While the core members understood the reason, most of the lower-ranking members were left puzzled. Following Li Xijun's orders, word had spread that Xu Xiao was a devil cultivator who had seized another's body. Coupled with the grisly and bizarre death of Old Man Liu, fear and hatred toward Xu Xiao simmered among the family members.

Li Xijun rose swiftly upon hearing the latest report and rode the wind outside, where Wushao approached him with a hissing voice and reported, "He just left the courtyard."

Fixing his gaze on Xu Xiao, Li Xijun saw him sitting cross-legged, immersed in a bath of crimson medicinal liquid, seemingly preparing for a breakthrough. Li Xijun's heart sank, thinking to himself worriedly, No, I cannot wait any longer! If I let this continue, he might break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm in just a few years! By the time the elders return from the vast Eastern Sea, he could already be too powerful. Who knows what methods he'll have mastered by then? And if he slips away unnoticed, it'll be too late... It's better to strike now than regret later!

Without hesitation, Li Xijun waved his hand, "Everyone, gather here!"

He narrowed his eyes, activating both his perception technique and talisman qi to observe the spiritual qi flowing through the medicinal bath. He waited patiently for Xu Xiao to enter the critical stage of his breakthrough.

"When he reaches the tipping point, we will strike together," Li Xijun murmured, his hand already resting on the hilt of the sword at his waist. Behind him, the hem of Li Wushao's robe shifted with an ominous, rolling motion, while the white monkey, Chen Mufeng, and the others stood at the ready, fully prepared for battle.

Li Xijun sighed inwardly, What a mess... Ever since our family achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm and rose to dominate the lake, it has been years since we've had to assemble with such vigilance... and now, all this, just for a mere Qi Cultivator!

Xu Xiao slowly calmed his mind, his breath becoming unsteady as the medicinal liquid in the basin whirled faster and began to dissipate. With the cautionary tales of Chu Yi and the Kong Family still fresh in his mind, Li Xijun dared not be careless. He feared his guest cultivators might also lower their guard, so he repeatedly reminded them, "This person is most likely a reincarnated devil... Who knows how many secret treasures or forbidden techniques he carries? Do not underestimate him! A single lapse could cost us our lives!"

Sure enough, at these words, the expressions of those present grew serious. Even Li Wushao, who had stood stiffly with a stern face, showed a flicker of surprise and increased his vigilance in his gaze toward the figure below.

Xu Xiao's aura surged.

Li Xijun held his breath, waiting for the critical moment to strike.

————

At the Eastern Sea.

Li Yuanjiao escorted Li Qinghong back to Lake Xian, ensuring she entered the river path leading to the Yue Cultivating Sect before heading eastward again.

Being a cautious person, he did not retrace his steps but instead took a different route with Kongheng to return to Zongquan Island, adding a slight detour while staying safe.

They flew silently for a while, passing a long, pine-covered island. From afar, the skies above were filled with clashing spells and flashes of light, creating an impressive commotion.

Based on his calculations, Li Yuanjiao determined that this location aligned with the notorious Green Pine Temple Ruins. For years, Sword Gate, Chunyi Dao Gate, and Crimson Reef Island had been vying for control over it, yet no resolution had been reached.

As Li Yuanjiao looked toward the ruins, a thought suddenly occurred to him. He turned to Kongheng and asked, "Master Monk, do the records of the Liao River's teachings mention anything about the ancient gate known as Green Pine Temple?"

Kongheng pressed his palms together and replied softly, "Indeed! This immortal temple was founded before Moonlight Origin Mansion... It produced two True Monarchs. The first remains obscure but was known to cultivate in the Fire Virtue system, while the second realized the Swamp Gold attainment but was slain by the Lesser Yang Devil Monarch."

Li Yuanjiao recalled the Lesser Yang Devil Monarch, whose name was linked to Splitreed Island. He nodded and then asked, "So, the legacies of Swamp Gold and Fire Virtue lie within Green Pine Temple?"

"Correct," Kongheng affirmed.

Li Yuanjiao, however, remained skeptical.

"If two True Monarchs emerged from there, how did it fall into the hands of these mere Purple Mansion Realm immortal gates? Would any Golden Core Realm cultivator not be interested in it? Surely, there are True Monarchs attuned to Swamp Gold within the mainland?"

Kongheng nodded and explained, "After the fall of Green Pine Temple, it was plundered by many factions, leaving it a desolate ruin. There are no longer any truly valuable treasures, which is why it is now called the Green Pine Temple Ruins."

Kongheng continued, "However, even if the artifacts are gone, the records of its techniques remain in the hidden realm within it. Moreover, there are ancient spirit herbs cultivated for centuries there, which are of significant value to any sect."

As Li Yuanjiao listened, his gaze returned to the mountain. Following his glance, Kongheng continued in a calm tone, "The Sword Gate covets the Swamp Gold Dao, Crimson Reef Island desires the Merging Fire arts, and Chunyi Gate claims to be the descendants of Green Pine Temple. Naturally, all of them want a piece. The great formation protecting Green Pine Temple remains sealed and has yet to be broken... They are all waiting for the arrival of a predestined person."

"A predestined person..?" Li Yuanjiao repeated thoughtfully, his brows furrowing.

Unwilling to get entangled in the conflict, Li Yuanjiao and Kongheng flew around the mountain. As they passed it, Li Yuanjiao murmured to himself, and Kongheng added, "This is also called fate... a subtle force, inexplicable yet undeniable. Without that destined person, not even Golden Core Realm cultivators can breach it, no matter how fiercely the three sects struggle."

Kongheng paused briefly before elaborating further, "Some formations open only when the destined person passes through it. Some treasures lie buried for millennia, waiting for one specific person to claim them. And some individuals, no matter the danger they encounter, possess foreknowledge and cannot be easily killed—all due to the force of fate."

"Fate is this powerful? Does that not make one invincible?" Li Yuanjiao pondered aloud, taking note of Kongheng's words.

Kongheng responded with a serene expression, "Fate is not a tangible force, much like the metallic essence, which also has limits. Triumph and defeat alike can be attributed to fate. As one scripture puts it: Whatever lies beyond one's strength to achieve, that is fate."

The words of a Buddhist cultivator were always cryptic. Li Yuanjiao pondered for a moment before quietly saying, "In my view, fate and Metallic Essence are very much alike. Both are forces beyond control—something that defies strategy and clouds judgment."

The thought of his elder, Li Tongya, crossed Li Yuanjiao's mind. Kongheng, hands clasped in front of him, chanted softly, "It was not always like this. Back then, whether immortal, devil, or monk, they all pursued absolute freedom. Now that freedom is achieved, this is what we have become."

Ripples shimmered across the turquoise and red surface of the water beneath them. Li Yuanjiao did not respond, instead flew alongside Kongheng quietly. Before long, they arrived at Zongquan Island. The people on the island, seeing the two return, cheered loudly, their joyful voices filling the air.

Once they landed, Zong Yan stepped forward respectfully to greet them. Kongheng murmured a few quiet words before retreating. Li Yuanjiao leaned closer to Zong Yan and instructed in a low voice, "Send out a few trusted men to gather information across the various marketplaces. Choose only the most loyal ones and ensure everything is done discreetly."

Zong Yan bowed deeply and reassured him, "Rest assured, My Lord. Everyone on this island has survived the jaws of monsters. Their loyalty is beyond question."

Li Yuanjiao's tone grew serious, "There is an immortal foundation known as the Molten Metal Cave, capable of sensing artifacts and forging weapons. Investigate which of the Three Gold it belongs to and whether it has any Dao Partners. Report back to me once you know this."

Zong Yan nodded and withdrew. Now having a direction, Li Yuanjiao mulled over his next steps, "The Molten Metal Cave—Azure Pond Sect has no known Dao Partners. Yu Muxian is a proud individual who would never allow his path to be severed. If I can gather information about related techniques and tie them to the Green Pine Temple Ruins, I can surely lure Yu Muxian out."

With the initial steps in place, Li Yuanjiao retreated to a secluded chamber. Activating the room's protective formations, he still felt uneasy. He retrieved a formation plate and meticulously rearranged the setup himself. Only then did he sit down, satisfied, ready to begin his meditation.

"Time to break through to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment Realm!"
