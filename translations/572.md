# Chapter 885: Returning

The autumn dew over the lake had yet to fade even as the morning sun dimly appeared over the horizon. Li Qinghong stepped out of the great hall, and the sword-bearing Li Xijun approached her.

He said quietly, “All families may see clearly with the autumn dew filling the lake, but news of mourning should still be sent to all. Report to the Ning Family in the Azure Pond Sect, then pass word to Yi Mountain, the five prefectures, and even the cultivators along the riverbank. My lord preserved Jiangnan single-handedly, and such grace must be swiftly consolidated.”

Li Qinghong nodded and instructed him to proceed. Li Xizhi stepped forward lightly and continued, “I’ll handle the news to the Azure Pond Sect. I’ll set off in three days, after observing the proper rites...”

He paused, then shifted the topic gently, “We should also wait for Si Yuanli.”

No one showed any doubt. Li Qinghong nodded as though it were only natural. Si Yuanli, who would be returning triumphant to his residence, would surely stop by Moongaze Lake. He wouldn’t leave without presenting himself properly.

The woman then spoke softly, “Yuanqin is held as a hostage in Yi Mountain, and there was no hope of seeing him. But now that the Azure Pond Sect is in sudden chaos, we must seize this chance to summon him back at once. If we hesitate, we may never see him again.”

Though the Chi Family had suffered severe damage to its core and most of its direct descendants had perished, there could still be ambitious ones among the collateral branches. Li Yuanqin’s closeness to the Chi Family was well known, and Li Qinghong feared a shift in the situation could lead to unforeseen troubles.

“I’ll send someone there overnight.” Li Xijun replied softly. Just then, the formation let out a burst of sound, and a towering elder descended from within it, his back slightly hunched.

His voice was low and deep, “My lords, Li Wushao and Li Minggong have returned from the North. They are waiting outside the formation.”

“Quick, bring them in!” Li Xijun felt a chill run through his heart and quickly gave the order. Moments later, several figures descended from the formation and knelt before the hall.

Li Minggong was in front, and bowed at the base of the steps, “Greetings to all elders...”

Her face was slightly pale, but her clothes were still neat. She was clearly in the best condition among them all. The grim-faced Li Wushao, an elderly man, stood behind her with a burly figure. Both of them were at the ninth stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

The elderly man had a full white beard, a smooth, bald scalp, and was missing an eye. He knelt blankly on the ground. The burly man was physically intact, but his face was the color of gold paper. He was also swaying like a teetering iron tower, as if he could collapse at any moment.

Li Qinghong lowered her eyes slightly and spoke softly, “The upheaval at Chengshui Tomb that broke Mount Yan Pass was part of a larger shift, it is not your fault. Go on and speak.”

Li Minggong, a bright and gracious woman from the first lineage who had always been fond of smiling, now spoke with a choked voice, “Less than half a day had passed from when the lords had entered Chengshui Tomb when the devil cultivators arrived. A devil general rode in on a wave of violet aura, holding Yu Su’s severed head. He activated several talismans and breached the pass in under fifteen minutes.

“The cultivators collapsed like a landslide, fleeing south in panic, fearing only that they weren’t running fast enough. They trampled over the rear formations, and half of them abandoned their posts. Midway, I encountered Master An, who was gathering the scattered forces under his banner. We made our way toward Aunt.”

The Aunt she referred to was naturally Li Yuexiang. Regret colored Li Minggong’s face, and she choked up for several breaths before continuing, “The scene was complete chaos, with a grey and overcast sky. We couldn’t tell which experts were above us. The hearts of the people had scattered, so we rushed toward the rear. Soon we saw Aunt Yue, wielding her sword and controlling fire, locked in battle with a devil cultivator...”

At this point, she was overcome with sobs. Behind her, An Zheyan, who resembled a lifeless corpse, crawled forward a few steps on his knees and took up the tale in a hoarse, grating voice, “I sought only to aid, and led the cultivators to support her. When Yuexiang saw us, her expression changed. She rebuked me... and said...

“Master An, are you here to harm me as well?!”

At those words, Li Qinghong slowly closed her eyes. Li Xizhi lowered his head. Li Xijun’s hand gripped his sword hilt so tightly that his knuckles turned white.

An Zheyan’s forehead knocked hard against the ground as he went on, “Then a Buddhist cultivator descended from the sky, calculated with his fingers, and smiled with delight. He looked around and said, ‘I nearly missed a fine delicacy.’”

Li Xijun dared not look at Li Xizhi. He stood alone as An Zheyan continued, weeping, “Only then did this old man recall that Buddhist cultivators relish esteemed blood, it was already too late. That bald demon struck Li Qin dead with a single palm, plucked out his heart for inspection, then sneered. All the cultivators were shaken with fear...”

“My son Siming charged in with his sword but died in five exchanges. That bald monk killed several others, and was about to strike me when Li Wen threw his hammer to stop him...”

Li Minggong had regained her composure and continued softly, “Aunt Yue took my hand and said urgently, ‘If I must die today, I will not drag others with me.’ Then she relinquished her spiritual essence, summoned a talisman, and looked at Master An, saying, ‘Escort them home, do not waste my life in vain.’

“We fled several miles, while Aunt Yue used a Foundation Establishment Realm talisman to protect herself and headed north. She was cloaked in pheasant fire; it must have been self-immolation.”

There must have been quite a few survivors back then, yet only the two with the highest cultivation made it out.

An Zheyan merely kept knocking his head to the ground. “I am incompetent. Please execute me to atone for my crimes.”

An Zheyan collapsed to his knees like a corpse. Li Yuexiang, An Siming, Li Qin, nearly everyone had died because of him. How could the old man not be driven nearly mad? Inwardly, he repeated to himself coldly, In the past, I was reckless and caused my eldest son’s death. Now, I’ve caused the death of my second son, and brought ruin upon my lord’s family and fellow cultivators out of stupidity. A man more useless than me does not deserve to live. Better to die early, so I harm no one else!

Li Qinghong gazed quietly at the old man before her. He had served faithfully since the time of Li Tongya, through four generations. His two sons had both given their utmost, and even now, An Siwei was still guarding below the mountain. How could she say anything more? The hall fell into heavy silence.

At last, Li Wen spoke. The honest man had already discarded his golden hammer and said in a deep voice, “The situation then was urgent. Had I been leading, I too would have gone to help. Master An merely happened to be there in the moment... I ask to be punished along with him.”

Li Minggong also stepped forward to accept punishment. Only Li Wushao remained in the rear with a sour expression, lost in his own thoughts.

All of Jiangbei was in chaos at the time. If they saw their own kin locked in battle with devil cultivators, anyone not exceptionally sharp would have struggled to react in time. The elders above said nothing, their expressions heavy.

Li Qinghong waited for a while before Li Xizhi finally spoke, his voice quiet, “Were any belongings left behind?”

At last, Li Wushao stepped forward. He held up a broken sword and a small box with both palms. Li Xizhi took them gently, glanced briefly inside the box, then quickly turned his gaze to the sword.

The wooden talisman tied to the sword’s end swayed gently. Li Xizhi examined the script, then put the sword away. He handed the small box to Li Qinghong before finally speaking, “Deliver lenient judgment.”

Chengshui Marsh.

The gloom over Jiangbei had gradually faded away. Bright light reflected across the surface of Chengshui Marsh. The Converging Water had also thinned, and one could vaguely make out the wreckage at the bottom.

The air trembled faintly as the pitch-black great void revealed itself. An elderly man in green robes emerged, holding a talisman. He stood suspended in midair, his complexion slightly flushed, and began coughing, Cough... cough...

His cough stirred ripples across the water’s surface, causing it to flash with a hint of golden light. A young man, also in green robes, appeared behind him and stepped forward cheerfully.

“Uncle, are you feeling better?”

The elder kept a stern expression, his voice slightly hoarse as he replied, “Mount Changhuai is, after all, the leading sect of Wu State... not so easily dealt with...”

This was none other than Daoist Master Yuan Xiu, Si Boxiu. He glanced at Chi Buzi before him and frowned. “And yet you didn’t even make a move? Three strands of Metallic Essence. If you’d truly given it a go, you might have seized one for yourself.”

Thinking back, he still looked regretful and said with a sigh, “That was the Metallic Essence left behind by the True Essence and Divine Fiend True Monarch Tianwu... That Fruition Attainment is still unclaimed. The essence itself is a thing of beauty. Even if True Monarch Tianwu had some scheme, he acted with honor. At the very least, he would have risen to a subordinate station...”

“Haha...” Unexpectedly, Chi Buzi laughed twice, glanced northward, shrugged, and replied, “Uncle, you know I’m the most suspicious sort. Just looking at that thing gives me the creeps. I’m no saint; if I really tried to attain True Essence, who knows if I’d even succeed? I fear the lord’s backup plan would send me off to the afterlife before I got there.”

Si Boxiu burst into laughter, shook his head, and sighed, “You overthink it. If the True Monarch hadn’t perished, the three strands of Metallic Essence in Anhuai Heaven wouldn’t look like this. The Fruition Attainment remains unclaimed simply because our lord has no use for it. He certainly wouldn’t fake death just to leave it vacant.”

The old man paused for a moment before replying, “At most, it’s like the moon and sun not responding. There’s no way a True Monarch could exist while the Fruition Attainment remains vacant.”

Chi Buzi curled his lips, activated his divine ability, and calculated with his fingers. He shook his head and said, “I’ve nothing more to say. I still need to divine something, I don’t have time to waste here.”

Daoist Master Yuan Xiu squinted slightly and said suspiciously, “You’re not going back to the sect? Zhiyun is in closed-door cultivation, trying to break through. I fear no one is left to oversee the larger affairs.”

“Forget it!” Chi Buzi waved his hand disinterestedly and said, “Isn’t Uncle still around? If worst comes to worst, there’s always Lord Suiguan. What’s there to worry about?”

Chi Buzi had no intention of returning to manage the Azure Pond Sect on behalf of Pristine Water. Ever since Chi Wei's death, he had gradually come to see the flaws in the pursuit of Metal essence. Every moment spent in the Azure Pond Sect felt like torment. Why would he return at all?

Si Boxiu furrowed his brow, his voice growing solemn, “You know well what Lord Suiguan is like. The Chi Family was never populous to begin with, and now there isn’t a single Purple Mansion Realm cultivator left. How can they hold the ground? With Zhiyun in seclusion and you refusing to return, the Chi Family may not endure.”

Heh!

Chi Buzi sneered inwardly and thought to himself, I’ve been gone for years, and he’s the one who’s been thrilled! He’s coveted the Moon Glazed Tree for ages, and now he’s finally getting his wish! He’s probably praying I die out here!

Chi Buzi, being extremely cunning, fully understood Si Boxiu’s true intentions. He knew the kind-sounding words were mere pretext, so he simply smiled and said, “I was born into this world to follow my nature and cultivate my fate. My parents gave me life, but they never forced me to do anything. I cared for them without obligation. They died early, and I’ve since changed bodies multiple times, so what bloodline could I possibly speak of? ‘Chi Buzi’ is just a name. What has the Chi Family to do with me?

“An immortal ought to cast aside worldly burdens, thinking of family, then sect, then all beings, and finally the cosmos... but the cosmos follows natural law. What does that have to do with me? A Daoist Master has but one truth, the ‘self.’ To follow nature and fate, succeed and one ascends, fail and one dies.”

Si Boxiu looked at him deeply, as if slowly beginning to understand why this man could cultivate with such speed, breaking through barrier after barrier. He only shook his head silently, He bears no concern for morality, family, or all living beings, only the word 'immortal' remains in his heart.

Chi Buzi had no interest in mincing words. He was eager to seek out Purple Mansion Realm demonic creatures. He said everything he needed to in one breath, then entered the great void and vanished without a trace.

Left behind, Si Boxiu stood in silent thought, running several things through his mind, There were only three strands of Metallic Essence to begin with. Zipei struck unexpectedly, caught Zhelu off guard, and forced the essence out. In the end, the Buddhist cultivators didn’t get a single share. How satisfying!

But this was also Kan Xuyu’s final move. Once she returns, she’ll be attempting to attain Purple Essence... how incredibly difficult that is. Once she succeeds, this entire North–South contest will come to an end.

Si Boxiu gathered his sleeves, stepped into the great void, and with a turn, disappeared as well.

————

Mount Bianyan.

The sky above Mount Bianyan was completely empty. The vegetation on the mountain was torn and scattered. Even the hundred spirit cords embedded into the mountain as formation anchors had cleanly been dug out. Si Yuanli stood at the summit, quietly gazing into the distance.

Clad in a flowing Dharma robe and bearing a sword at his waist, he appeared otherworldly in posture, yet his brows were knit with concern. Behind him stood his nephew, Si Tongyi, his most trusted aide.

Most of the Chi Family’s direct descendants, as well as the peak masters and guest cultivators, had all died here. The resulting phenomena had been utterly suppressed, leaving behind only devastation, as if nothing had ever occurred.

He had no need to feign sorrow or sigh in lamentation in front of his confidants. He simply stood in the night air, lost in silent contemplation.

His other companions had been sent off to search for Chi Zhiyan’s whereabouts, but the white-robed middle-aged man knew his fate full well in his heart, The Mahas and Purple Mansion cultivators of Jiangbei have dissipated together. The larger confrontation between North and South has vanished as well. Everything can now be calculated piece by piece. The soul lamps on Azure Pond Peak must have gone out in swaths like a storm passing through. There’s no way to hide it.

Every move Si Yuanli made in the limited time left would shape the fate of the Azure Pond Sect. The faces of each family head and each peak master flashed through his mind. Alone, facing the biting winds, he exhaled deeply.

After turning it over in his mind, something struck him. He turned quickly toward Si Tongyi. He flipped his hand over and produced a white jade command token.

He said with solemn urgency, “Take my seal and rush back to the sect tonight. Deliver a secret order to Li Yuanqin. Tell him to go to Moongaze Lake to see his father one last time. This must not be made public.”

“I fear it may already be too late...” Si Tongyi said thoughtfully,

But Si Yuanli shook his head. “Whether he makes it in time doesn’t matter. It’s just an excuse to send him back to the Li Family. Let them talk, and see what he’s made of.”

Si Tongyi rose at once and rode the wind southward at full speed. Only then did Si Yuanli relax slightly and return to his thoughts, looking for any missed details.

After a while, divine light surged before him. Si Yuanli looked up thoughtfully, as a familiar aged figure appeared. Joy lit his face and he felt a sense of relief as he bowed respectfully.

“Ancestor!”

Daoist Master Yuan Xiu swept his gaze over the ruined Mount Bianyan, his eyelid twitching. He said nothing, and merely flicked his sleeve. Si Yuanli’s surroundings instantly dimmed, he was now walking within the great void.

“Daoist Master... the Huai River Map guarded the riverbanks. Li Xuanfeng used the Monarch Calling Golden Talisman and died in fierce combat... We followed orders and used every hidden card the Daoist Master had left behind...”

Si Yuanli swiftly reported everything, only to see Si Boxiu standing silently, expressionless, hands clasped behind his back. There was no hint of praise on the old man’s face, only wordless stillness.
