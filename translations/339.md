# Chapter 402: Soul Searching

Listening to Xiao Guiluan's explanation, Li Yuanjiao felt a chill in his heart, his mind racing with countless thoughts.

Where is Buzi now? Has he heard anything about our family?! Xiao Guitu had just been hit by his divine ability, and Guiluan immediately went to see him... Wouldn't Buzi misunderstand this?

Should I replace the immortal mirror with Qingche Sword?

Li Yuanjiao believed that if he quietly placed the bronze immortal mirror in the woods or a river, even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would not find it. No one would suspect a thing if he replaced it with the Qingche Sword on the stone platform.

He pondered, his legs stiffening as another possibility crossed his mind.

The speed of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator far exceeds that of a Qi Cultivator... If Buzi has already reached Moongaze Lake, he could be watching from the Great Void right now!

If Buzi was indeed at Moongaze Lake and used the Great Void to bypass the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation, any action he took now would be under Buzi's watchful eye, and attempting to retrieve the mirror would be suicidal.

But I can't just sit by and wait to be killed! A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator wouldn't waste time idly watching from the Great Void! With a single sweep of his divine ability, he could learn everything... Buzi shouldn't be at the lake!

Li Yuanjiao knew that a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could travel in an instant, much faster than Xiao Guiluan's return. His thoughts spun rapidly, but his actions did not stop. He suddenly called out in a deep voice, "Guiluan, return to Mount Wutu at once!"

With that, he headed to the backyard. Xiao Guiluan, understanding the urgency in his tone, left swiftly like the wind. Li Xuanxuan's face also changed drastically, wanting to speak but stopping himself.

Li Yuanjiao stepped out, feeling a sudden warning in his mind. The Profound Pearl Talisman Seed in his Qihai acupoint trembled, sending chills through his body as though he was being watched by something sinister.

"Oh no!"

He stopped abruptly, only to see the space in front of him darken. Slowly, the image of a green-robed cultivator appeared, standing with his hands behind his back.

The green-robed cultivator had a small smile on his face. He looked to be around twenty-seven or twenty-eight, dressed in a flowing robe. His long hair fluttered in the wind as he stared at Li Yuanjiao quietly.

Daoist Master Buzi...

Li Yuanjiao felt a bitterness in his mouth as Buzi raised his head. The sleeve of his green robe moved as he held up a small, exquisite white jade bottle in his right hand.

"What is this?" Buzi asked casually, but his question made Li Yuanjiao break out in a cold sweat.

The jade bottle in Daoist Master Buzi's hand came from the Li Family's treasure vault, containing a talisman pill that the immortal mirror had condensed!

Buzi has been to our treasure vault...

Li Yuanjiao hurriedly bowed, feigning a terrified demeanor, and said in a trembling voice, "Junior Li Yuanjiao from the Li Family under the governance of Azure Pond greets Daoist Master Buzi!"

His voice was neither too loud nor soft, but it was enough for Li Xuanxuan, who was standing guard outside, to hear clearly. Li Xuanxuan was so terrified that he almost went to retrieve the mirror.

Just as he took a step, Li Xuanxuan realized that the spiritual sense of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could easily cover the entire Mount Lijing; going to the backyard now would be like doing so right in front of Buzi.

Outside, Li Xuanxuan was like an ant on a hot pan, while inside, Li Yuanjiao tried to buy time, quickly making a judgment in his mind.

Buzi broke through the Great Void and immediately went to our treasure vault, attracted by the talisman pill, and is directly asking about it...

Although a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could easily bypass most formations via the Great Void and enter it, their spiritual sense could not penetrate the formations; they had to go in person to sense what was inside.

The Li Family had five mountains with over twenty formations, and with the small formations protecting the spirit fields, there were likely over a hundred. Buzi could not possibly check each one.

Even Mount Lijing had five separate formations, three for spirit fields, one for the ancestral hall, and one for the family vault.

He only went to the treasure vault at the mountaintop and has not been to the ancestral hall yet!

Countless thoughts flashed through his mind as Chi Buzi watched him.

"You recognize me?" Chi Buzi asked.

Li Yuanjiao bowed again and respectfully said, "I have seen portraits of the four Daoist Masters of the upper sect. Daoist Master Yuanwu and Daoist Master Yuan Xiu are both white-haired cultivators, only you and Daoist Master Yuan Su are young men in green robes. Daoist Master Yuan Su is stationed in the southern border all year round, so it must be you..."

"Not bad."

Chi Buzi smiled and looked at him. Among the remaining four Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of Azure Pond, Tang Yuanwu, Si Boxiu, and Ning Tiaoxiao were all of the same generation, serving as the left and right arms of Chi Wei, hence using Yuan as their Daoist title.

He was from a later generation, and by the time he reached the Purple Mansion Realm, the Azure Pond Sect no longer followed the custom of using Daoist titles. Hence, he was simply called Buzi. Seeing that Li Yuanjiao could name so many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from Azure Pond, his smile broadened as he repeated, "What is this thing?"

Of course, he was referring to the talisman pill. Li Yuanjiao responded promptly and respectfully, "This item was obtained by our clan in a cave dwelling, along with the Supreme Yin Moonlight of that year. The clan could not identify this pill or discern its quality, and we feared possessing a valuable item would bring disaster, so we did not dare reveal it..."

Chi Buzi waved his hand to interrupt him, smiling brightly as he remarked, "This pill has excellent boundary-breaking effects and is quite rare... It seems to be made with an ancient method. I see that your clan's fortune is not shallow!"

Just as Li Yuanjiao was about to reply, he suddenly felt a wave of panic overwhelm him. The world before him turned gray and dark, shrouded in a misty gloom as if draped in a veil of darkness, making everything hazy.

Divine ability!

A cramping pain shot through his stomach, and his face felt damp. His consciousness splintered into fragments, with large sections of text and images drifting through his mind.

With the last vestiges of his awareness, he clamped his mouth shut, his lips trembling. The talisman seed in his Qihai acupoint emitted a slight coolness, keeping his consciousness intact but not fully awakening him to avoid revealing any abnormalities.

Outside, Li Xuanxuan was also affected by the divine ability. Fortunately, Buzi focused on Li Yuanjiao alone, so Li Xuanxuan only felt slightly dizzy and immediately recognized it as a divine ability.

Feeling his mind growing increasingly muddled, Li Xuanxuan, knowing his will was weak, slapped the Shenyang Mansion between his eyebrows with his palm before collapsing with a thud.

Chi Buzi paid no attention to Li Yuanjiao's reactions. He waited for Li Yuanjiao to kneel and become dazed, then gently placed a hand on Li Yuanjiao's Shenyang Mansion. Pressing the spot between his defiant brows, he performed a hand seal with his other hand.

"Yin Quarters Nine Hills Heart Questioning Spell!"

This technique was a pure soul-searching spell from the Daoist sects, far superior to the crude methods of devil cultivators. Once a forbidden spell hindering the Dao path, it had now become a useful immortal method.

Li Yuanjiao's act was flawless, but Chi Buzi had no interest in guessing the origin of the pill. Whether Li Yuanjiao told the truth or lied, he did not care to listen to the details. A soul-searching spell would reveal everything.

Chi Buzi focused intently, closing his eyes slightly. He has used this spell many times with unfailing success. His spiritual sense smoothly entered Li Yuanjiao's sea of consciousness, guiding all his memories to the surface.

The origin of this pill!

He manipulated the spell and colorful lights appeared in his hand. These then entered Li Yuanjiao's Shenyang Mansion, transforming into pale gray runes that danced in his sea of consciousness.

Chi Buzi's vision darkened for a few moments before a dimly lit secret chamber appeared, cold and icy, with one or two flickers of white mana light.

This is... a cave dwelling?

Chi Buzi's gaze shifted, noticing the floor, intricately patterned, with osmanthus trees bearing ethereal white flowers that were fragrant yet chilling.

What is this... it looks somewhat like the Moon Glazed Tree, our sect's Purple Mansion Realm spirit root.

Given that this was the place where Supreme Yin Moonlight was obtained, some anomalies were expected. Chi Buzi quickly looked away, then saw a stone platform ahead which was shrouded in a white mist, exuding an aura of mystery.

This is...

Chi Buzi's heart stirred, but then he heard rustling noises. Golden and white osmanthus flowers fell, their golden stamens and pleasant fragrance particularly striking in the misty moonlight.

Rustle, rustle...

Several lively, adorable toads and rabbits hopped out from the dark corners, trampling on the fallen osmanthus petals.

Li Yuanjiao finally straightened up, allowing Buzi to see what was on the platform.

Suspended on the stone platform was a small grayish-green sphere, inscribed with ancient and profound runes. Suddenly, a pair of eyes appeared on it.

They were gentle yet indifferent and majestic.

On the peak of Mount Lijing, Chi Buzi's hand, which was hidden in his sleeve and performing the hand seals of his spell, began to tremble violently. Tears of blood streamed from his eyes that were closed tightly, trailing down his cheeks and making him look especially terrifying.

Drip, drop.

Two droplets of blood tears fell to the stone floor, shattering two bricks, then rolled like beads, producing crisp, echoing sounds.

————

Buzi's arrival was too sudden, a consequence of his reckless pursuit of Supreme Yin Moonlight for Li Chejing's Dao foundation years ago.

Although Si Yuanbai had claimed to have obtained the moonlight himself to protect the Li Family, deceiving the various Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, no one had anticipated that the matter would resurface years later. Eventually, some greedy individuals took a chance and personally visited the Li Family.

"I guess there's no running away this time..."

The immortal mirror had not regained its full power, but its inherent rank was exceedingly high. Once it was used for calculations, it was equivalent to predicting the fate of those above the Dao Embryo Realm. Lu Jiangxian had borrowed its power back then and was well aware of its capabilities.

Whether it was Master Monk Minghui or Maha Jinlian, they were merely following Li Qinghong's trail. When Lu Jiangxian directed them to the mirror, they immediately suffered significant losses.

The talisman seed of the mirror was even more domineering. Those in the Li Family who bore the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed had their souls, fates, and cultivation all linked to it. As long as Lu Jiangxian willed it, no one could touch them.

Now, with Buzi searching Li Yuanjiao's soul, he should have found nothing. Seeing Buzi's persistence, Lu Jiangxian grew increasingly fearful. If Li Yuanjiao's soul search failed, it would only raise more suspicion and complicate the situation. Ultimately, he might be exposed.

The Supreme Yin Profound Light was only at the Foundation Establishment Realm, but it was powerful enough to instantly kill a peak Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator or even threaten a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. However, Chi Buzi was not a stationary target and could escape into the Great Void, making it impossible to hit him.

Seeing Buzi initiate the soul search and about to reach the mirror, Lu Jiangxian gritted his teeth and thought to himself, I might as well use the talisman seed as a bridge and connect to Chi Buzi's spell immediately.

Although Lu Jiangxian was not skilled in soul-searching techniques, his proficiency in shamanic talisman had grown considerably over the years. Moonlight surged as it connected to fate, and the immortal mirror lit up, forcefully crashing into Chi Buzi's sea of consciousness.

Although I have not recovered, my divine sense far exceeds ordinary spiritual senses! Only by using this technique to counterattack can I hope for a chance at survival...!

————

Li Yuanjiao's consciousness drifted in a haze for a long time before suddenly clearing. A cool sensation rose from his Qihai acupoint, and he snapped his eyes open. Before him was Chi Buzi's hand, pressed against his forehead.

All around him was pitch-black and gloomy, the corners shrouded in darkness, and the atmosphere was oppressive. It was the time of day when baleful qi was at its peak.

The sky had already darkened, indicating that nearly two hours had passed. The blood-red setting sun, accompanied by dark red clouds, flowed on the horizon, signaling an ominous portent.

He glanced around and saw that the ground was covered with glittering red jade beads, lying quietly and reflecting dazzling colors in the dim light, creating a rather beautiful scene.

"Daoist Master..?" Li Yuanjiao called out cautiously, unsure of what Chi Buzi had done to him with his divine ability. He bowed his head in silence.

I am still alive... Chi Buzi must not have discovered anything.

Chi Buzi gave no response.

A sense of unease rose within Li Yuanjiao. After a long moment, he began to step back slowly. Chi Buzi remained silent, his sleeve hanging limply. When Li Yuanjiao finally looked up, he saw that the Daoist Master's face was grim, and his eyes were tightly shut.

The darkened twilight illuminated Chi Buzi's face, revealing two streams of blood tears. The sight struck Li Yuanjiao like a thunderclap, leaving his mind blank.

Chi Buzi! What is this..?!

Drip, drip...

Blood flowed down continuously Chi Buzi's cheeks, dripping from his chin as two blood beads hit the ground, transforming instantly into sparkling red jade beads. They collided with the ones on the ground, creating a series of crisp clinking sounds.

Li Yuanjiao now understood how the jade beads had come to be. Though he felt somewhat relieved, he was also horrified and took a step back. Chi Buzi remained motionless like a statue in the dim twilight.

Li Yuanjiao cautiously extended his spiritual sense to scan Chi Buzi, only to find nothing but an empty shell where the previous oppressive aura had been.

The jade bottle containing the talisman pill had fallen from Chi Buzi's sleeve and shattered on the ground. The pill rolled out and settled in a crack between the bricks.

Silently, Li Yuanjiao moved out of the courtyard. His father, Li Xuanxuan, lay stiffly on the ground. Li Yuanjiao checked his breathing, which was steady and long, then spotted a bloody wound on his head, indicating that he had been knocked unconscious.

Li Yuanjiao immediately took to the air, his spiritual sense sweeping the area. The two clan guards outside the courtyard seemed to have been affected by a spell and were sound asleep, snoring loudly.

Seeing that some were beginning to stir, Li Yuanjiao hurried back into the courtyard. He closed the gate hurriedly and helped Li Xuanxuan to his feet, using a spell to awaken him.

Li Xuanxuan gradually regained consciousness, groggy and bewildered. Upon seeing Li Yuanjiao, he asked in shock, "Where is the Daoist Master?!"

Li Yuanjiao gave a bitter laugh, shook his head, and helped Li Xuanxuan up to his feet. Opening the courtyard gate, he saw the two clan guards standing straight, showing no signs of their earlier slumber.

"Go fetch Qinghong and Yuanping!" Li Yuanjiao ordered.

After the guards left, Li Yuanjiao led Li Xuanxuan to the backyard.

The sky grew darker, and Chi Buzi remained standing there, tears of blood continually dripping from his stoic face. Li Xuanxuan felt dizzy at the sight. The red jade beads covering the ground gleamed brightly.

"Jiao'er..."

Li Xuanxuan trembled as he scanned Chi Buzi with his spiritual sense. The man stood like a jade pillar, and it was hard to believe what he saw. He checked repeatedly.

The colorful light of Chi Buzi's divine ability and overwhelming aura had vanished. The oppressive presence that once traversed the Great Void was gone, leaving only his thin green robe on his jade-like body.

Chi Buzi's face showed slight pain, but still, the bloody tears continued flowing.

"...Is he dead? ...Is he really dead?"

Li Xuanxuan's face turned pale, and he staggered back a few steps, filled not with relief or satisfaction, but with trembling fear.

"The Azure Pond Sect... how many years has it been since a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was killed..."
