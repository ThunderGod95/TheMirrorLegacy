# Chapter 848: The Calamity of the Exiled Qi

Li Ximing's gaze swept over the crowd of cultivators below, and a frown creased his brow. Too many of them knew he was in seclusion here. It was becoming a liability. Today's commotion could easily become tomorrow's interruption, forcing him out of his meditation. The situation was slipping from his grasp.

'It isn't a matter of mistrusting Xiukui or the people of Nine Mounds,' he mused. 'White Sand Island can remain a point of contact, but I can no longer cultivate here. It's time to find a new sanctuary.'

With that thought, any desire to remain on White Sand Island vanished. He glanced at the motley assembly of cultivators, his frown deepening. 'But if I just wave my sleeves and depart, this place will be plagued by disaster within a few years… Whether it's the immortal gates of the West Curtain Sea or other nearby powers, they might be hesitant for a time, but their probing is inevitable.'

If he remained, the situation would only escalate. It wouldn't just be the Dragon-kin. Even the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour from the neighbouring Peacock Sea would hear of a new Purple Mansion Realm power in the area and would surely send someone to investigate. Those monks were a cunning and troublesome lot; complications were certain to arise.

After a moment's pause, he finally spoke, his voice carrying over the crowd. "I was travelling the various seas when I chanced upon this island. I never intended for you all to gather here, but you did, and you received my protection. Now, I must depart from this sea. Our fated connection has run its course."

Hearing his words, the assembled cultivators breathed a collective sigh of relief, grateful they weren't being held accountable for the disturbance. But their relief quickly turned to fear at the news of his departure. Many began to weep as they prostrated themselves before him.

Li Ximing simply said, "The East A-Wang Sea is plagued by Demon beasts. Since I have come here, I cannot simply turn a blind eye to their misdeeds…"

If Li Ximing were a formation master, the ideal solution would be to upgrade White Sand Island's defensive arrays. Unfortunately, he knew nothing of formations. Gifting them potent pills would only sow discord and lead to infighting. Instead, he drew several jade slips from his sleeve.

These contained several cultivation methods and spell arts from the mainland, far superior to the common fare these cultivators relied on. He tossed the jade slips onto a nearby table and shook his head. "Such a hodgepodge of inferior techniques. It's no wonder you can't contend with a few mere Demon beasts. Circulate these among yourselves. For the next ten or twenty years, no Demon beast will dare to cause trouble here. It will be up to you to rely on your own cultivation to pass down a proper Daoist tradition."

"This Daoist Master will first make a trip to the West Curtain Sea," he declared. "When I return, I shall offer guidance to the few of you who have a chance of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm. After that, I will continue my travels across the seas."

The cultivators were both stunned and ecstatic. The old man at the front crawled forward a few steps, his voice thick with tears. "May we be so bold as to ask for the Old Master's esteemed name? The people of the East A-Wang Sea… will be forever in your debt…"

'My name?' Li Ximing scoffed internally. He had no intention of giving these people a powerful name to misuse, nor did he want any future troubles traced back to him. Could he really expect this ragtag group of rogue cultivators to produce a prodigy who could reach the late Foundation Establishment Realm, let alone the Purple Mansion Realm? It was a fantasy. Leaving his name would only forge a karmic tie and invite future trouble. He turned to depart, saying casually over his shoulder, "What need is there for a name? If you wish to repay me, refrain from using those blood qi arts. That would be thanks enough."

He vanished into the Great Void, leaving the crowd still prostrated, not daring to lift their heads. His final words sent a chill down the spines of more than ninety percent of the cultivators, and their eyes darted toward the man at the front, Daoist Wu.

The old Daoist, however, simply continued to kowtow, his body finally relaxing now that the crisis had passed. ‘Excellent… a crisis averted,’ he thought, a cunning light in his eyes. ‘The younger members of my Wu family are at the perfect age, and that young brat Han has already gone west for his training… In the end, my Wu family stands to gain the most…’

***

The spiritual qi was thin in the outer seas, which made traversing the Great Void exceptionally fast. In just half a day, Li Ximing had crossed several oceanic regions and arrived at the domain known as the West Curtain Sea.

The seabed here was unusually high, averaging less than a hundred zhang from the surface. In the shallower expanses, he saw numerous islanders wading through the water, digging at the reefs. They were a sturdy folk, clearly well-fed. Occasionally, one would slip and drown, their body bobbing to the surface, yet those nearby reacted not with deep sorrow, but with expressions of wistful regret or mild surprise.

To maintain such a standard of living under the rule of the Immortal Dao was no small feat. Judging by the people's demeanour, life under the Panorama Immortal Gate was not one of great suffering. This gave Li Ximing some reassurance. He continued west, and soon, a celestial mountain surrounded by several islands rose from the sea ahead.

He had no need to waste time announcing his presence; the cultivators on the island were already in a flurry of motion, gathering below him.

‘How astute…’ Li Ximing mused, his brow furrowed in thought. ‘This is no ordinary Daoist tradition, nor is it one established by some overseas rogue Daoist Master. Their reaction speed alone rivals that of the great Daoist traditions on the mainland…’

Just as he predicted, several streaks of light shot out from the celestial mountain, rapidly approaching his position. The lights resolved into two young men in elegant, flowing robes. They bowed in unison, their voices respectful. "The Zhao Clan of Jishan greets you, Daoist Master!"

"We do not know what brings your esteemed presence here… but do you have any instructions for us?"

Li Ximing was slightly puzzled, assuming they were a vassal family of the sect he was looking for. "Is the Panorama Immortal Gate located here?" he asked.

The two youths exchanged a look, a flicker of surprise in their eyes. One of them replied deferentially, "Daoist Master, if you seek the Panorama Immortal Gate, then you have found it in our Zhao Clan of Jishan."

Before Li Ximing could respond, a figure emerged from the Great Void. He was an old man dressed in a white feathered cloak over a short, turquoise robe. Though aged, he seemed far from the end of his years, unlike Li Ximing's current appearance. His cultivation was merely at the early stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, not even on par with Li Ximing's.

An elder who had achieved his breakthrough so late in life was naturally polite. He cupped his fist with a smile. "So it is Daoist Master Zhaojing! This humble one is Lin Yi of Jishan. Please, let us speak inside!"

Hearing the man speak his Daoist title, Li Ximing paused, then asked probingly, "Fellow Daoist… you are remarkably well-informed."

Daoist Master Lin Yi immediately chuckled. "It was a Daoist Master from Nine Mounds who gave me your title. I heard you were cultivating in the East A-Wang Sea and went to take a look. When I came across the situation on White Sand Island, I was almost certain it was you."

At the mention of Nine Mounds, Li Ximing's guard lowered a fraction. The reputation of Nine Mounds was far more reliable than that of Purple Smoke or Xiukui. He gave a slight nod. "A nearby place to sit will suffice."

The old Daoist Master understood. The two teleported through the Great Void, landing in a nearby pavilion. It was clear Lin Yi had a favour to ask; he was exceedingly courteous, ordering tea to be served. A serving girl approached with a crystalline tray, upon which sat two small, purple fruits.

"Zhaojing, please…" Lin Yi said with a smile.

Li Ximing, who had not formed a favourable impression of the man, gave a perfunctory nod. "Fellow Daoist, if there is something you need from me, let us speak of it plainly."

The Daoist Master's expression turned serious. "There's no need for Daoist titles. My family doesn't bother with such formalities. Besides, you and I share a common history. My surname is Yan, and my given name is Dushui. You can simply call me Dushui."

Seeing the sincerity in his expression, Li Ximing asked, "And what is this common history you speak of?"

Yan Dushui nodded. "You are a descendant of the ancient Wei, and I am a descendant of the ancient state of Yan. In ages past, our imperial families were joined by marriage. I can still imagine it… the grand procession of carriages leaving the Yan Mountains, stretching endlessly as it travelled south…"

This was unexpected. Li Ximing studied the man anew. "The ancient state of Yan…"

Unsure if he was believed, Yan Dushui looked up with a melancholic sigh. "Yan and Wei were steadfast allies. After Wei unified the north, my Yan state stood guard at the pass, holding back the sixteen barbarian tribes. But later, both our nations were shattered by the Jie barbarians and the Buddhist cultivators. My family fled with what remained of our Daoist tradition, wandering until we finally settled here. It has been hundreds of years since I have met a descendant of Wei… My family constantly reminisces about the past. We've even named these islands and mountain ranges after places in our lost homeland. A great many of our clan members have even changed their surname to Yan in remembrance."

Hearing all this, Li Ximing felt no stirrings of kinship. Instead, he inwardly shook his head. The first half of Yan Dushui's story might have been true, but the latter part rang false. The Wei state had been re-established, after all; descendants of the Wei-Li lineage surely scattered far and wide. It was impossible that he hadn't encountered a single one in all these years. The descendants of Yan were clearly not as close to his line as the Cui clan, and it was likely they resented submitting to Wei's rule back then. Now, with Li Ximing having reached the Purple Mansion Realm and appeared on his doorstep, Yan Dushui had conveniently learned of his identity from Nine Mounds and was rushing to establish a connection. There was little genuine sentiment to be found here.

He merely cupped his fist and said politely, "It is often said that my family are remnants of the Wei-Li, but in truth, we are ignorant of our own ancestry. It was only when my kinsman, Minghuang, achieved his Dao that these speculations began to circulate."

"I understand!" Yan Dushui nodded sagely. "My family is not ostentatious about our past either. When our kingdom was destroyed, we fled with a host of other immortal sects. By the time we reached this place, nearly all who remained were of the royal bloodline. We've borrowed the names of those sects to get by, presenting ourselves to the outside world as the Panorama Immortal Gate…"

The name of Yan clearly carried less weight than that of Wei, which involved far greater karma. It was obvious they had been living cautiously all these years. Seeing Li Ximing fall silent, the old man quickly pressed on. "The reason I have invited you today, an old kinsman, is because I am truly in need of your help."

His expression grew solemn. "My family discovered a certain treasure many years ago. We have been waiting ever since, as we require the aid of a Bright Yang Life Divine Ability to retrieve it. We had previously approached Daoist Master Yangya of the Cui Clan in the Western Sea… but his stance was firm. He said he would no longer meddle in the affairs of the Eastern Sea or the mainland, as he wishes to sever the karmic debts of his ancestors. Since our matter is related to his ancestry, he refused to act."

Li Ximing had heard of this Daoist Master Yangya. He was a member of the Cui clan, but from a branch that had relocated to the Western Sea and had little contact with the main lineage. He hadn't realized the division was so absolute. After a moment's hesitation, he asked, "What is this treasure?"

Yan Dushui's voice dropped to a near whisper. "A wisp of Exiled Qi."

Li Ximing was perplexed. "What sort of treasure is that?"

Yan Dushui paused, then sidestepped the question with a smile. "You would only need to lend a minor assistance, Fellow Daoist. Afterwards, we ask only that you keep this matter confidential. My Jishan clan will reward you handsomely!" He smiled again, adding, "The item grows upon a piece of Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood. Once our task is complete, I will take the treasure itself, but the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood it inhabits can be yours. We are open to negotiating any other requests as well."

Although Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood was only a Foundation Establishment-level spiritual material, its extreme rarity made it exceptionally precious. It was typically only found within grotto-heavens and mystic realms, with small quantities occasionally appearing in the Southern Borderlands. Its primary use was in crafting soul lamps of the highest quality, which were highly resistant to the divinatory effects of a Purple Mansion cultivator's divine abilities that could otherwise reveal a person's life or death status. This was the very material used for the soul lamps of the three great sects.

Li Ximing recalled that Minghui of the Lotus Temple had once asked him to search for this very material. If he had some to spare, he wondered if the monk would still be interested. However, his general distrust of monks made him cautious. For now, he simply stroked his beard, remaining silent.

After a few moments of silence, Li Ximing spoke deliberately. "I must insist that you explain more clearly, Fellow Daoist. If I am to act without even knowing the nature of this treasure, how can I be sure I won't be entangled in some unforeseen trouble? How could I possibly agree under such circumstances?"

Whatever the people of Nine Mounds had told Yan Dushui, it seemed to have earned his trust. The old man hesitated for a moment before nodding. "Very well," he said in a low voice. "I shall hold nothing back."

"The twelve primordial Qis arose from the 'Clear Qi.' Under the primordial Profound Wind, all other forms of qi were born. Yet, there was one whose Fruition Attainment was entangled at the very moment of its creation, causing it to plummet into the boundless Underworld, where it became a hazy and imperceptible Dao. This is a matter of extreme antiquity. With this Qi bound and its Fruition Attainment lost to the Underworld, its presence in the mortal realm grew increasingly scarce. Only a few practitioners of the ancient Immortal Dao still cultivated it. But as the Qi merged further with the Underworld, it began to nourish that realm in turn. Its presence in the mortal world diminished until its Daoist tradition was completely severed.

"In primordial times, this Qi had a proper name. But as it vanished, the event came to be known as the Calamity of the Yin Exile. Its true name was buried in the scrolls of history. By the time of later antiquity, it was simply called the Qi of the Exiled, and to this day, even those who know of its existence can only refer to it as the Exiled Qi."

His eagerness for Li Ximing's help was palpable as he continued to elaborate, his expression wistful. "The Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood and the Nine-Refined Spirit of today… they are both products of this Qi. One might say they belong to the Immortal Dao, but to be precise, only the faintest traces of its original nature remain… Furthermore, the very principle that allows shattered jade talismans and tokens to serve as warnings can be traced back to the Fruition Attainment of this Exiled Qi… The Calamity of the Yin Exile also provided a shortcut for a certain Revered One to seize another Fruition Attainment, and it touches upon the secrets of several great Daoist traditions. Alas! The entanglements are complex, and the closer they are to the present, the less I can speak of them. Please forgive my reticence…"

Yan Dushui fell silent. Li Ximing then asked quietly, "If that is the case, then Fellow Daoist must possess great fortune to have access to something from the Underworld."

Yan Dushui shook his head with a heavy sigh. "The matter is not so simple. When my ancestors fled to this place, after generations of hardship, they had the good fortune to form a connection with a personage from the Underworld. This treasure was something he left behind when he departed. Unfortunately, my family lacks the means to move it… It was not until I achieved the Purple Mansion Realm that there was hope. I made several pilgrimages to Nine Mounds, respectfully begging for guidance, and was finally granted a method of retrieval. However, it requires either the Bright Yang Life Divine Ability known as World's Radiance, the ancient divine ability Imperial Response, or the aid of the Sheji Daoist tradition. A mere manifestation of the ability is all that is needed."

Li Ximing remained outwardly calm, his initial suspicion abating. ‘If this were a trap,’ he considered, ‘the bait is hardly irresistible. Moreover, it requires World’s Radiance, a divine ability that is still a distant goal for me…’ From this angle, it truly seemed to be a matter of a simple favour.

Still, he smiled and said, "Fellow Daoist, you think too highly of me. World’s Radiance is a profound Life Divine Ability. Not only have I yet to cultivate it, I do not even possess the manual. How could I possibly be of assistance?"

Yan Dushui shook his head, a carefree smile spreading across his face. "The Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven has manifested in the world. Manuals for Bright Yang techniques should be readily available. With a talent like yours, having mastered a divine ability at such a young age, how could World’s Radiance be a distant goal? It matters not. This old man has another century of lifespan remaining. I should live to see that day. If not… then we can discuss alternatives."

Li Ximing instantly understood the source of his confidence. In the old man’s view, it was a certainty that Li Ximing would use the Art of Rebirth; possessing the Foundation Establishment Realm manual was all that was needed. Faced with the three divine abilities of the Purple Mystery Immortal Threshold, it was inconceivable that he would not cultivate the corresponding Life Divine Ability. Therefore, mastering World’s Radiance was merely a matter of time.

After a moment of contemplation, Li Ximing replied, "Since you have already waited for so many years, there is no rush. I have a few pills I have yet to finish refining. How about I first make a trip to Nine Mounds and return to find you afterwards?"

Yan Dushui was not surprised by the request. He smiled and nodded. "That is perfectly fine. I will wait here for your return. As for Nine Mounds… there is no need for you to make such a long journey. Senior Lingdu is nearby. Fly a short distance west, and you will be able to meet him yourself."

"Oh?" A flicker of interest sparked within Li Ximing, and his smile broadened. "Haha… Since the Senior himself is here, it would be terribly impolite of me to run off to refine pills."

The moment Yan Dushui finished speaking, a new suspicion bloomed in Li Ximing’s mind. ‘I’m beginning to think it isn’t Yan Dushui who wants this Exiled Qi,’ he mused. ‘More likely, it’s Nine Mounds… for Senior Lingdu to be here right now is far too convenient.’

Yan Dushui chuckled. "There is a remarkable hidden treasury in the West Curtain Sea. Nine Mounds sends disciples to this region for training every year. This year, the Senior himself is leading the group, and they have arrived at the opportune moment."

Li Ximing smiled and nodded, then took to the air, following the directions. He sighed internally. ‘So, is this the West Curtain Sea of Jishan, or the West Curtain Sea of Nine Mounds? Forcing them to have outsiders come and claim treasures from their own territory… what a grievance.’

It was obvious that while the Jishan clan was not as destitute as the Cui family, they had survived by submitting to a greater power. They had likely been a vassal of Nine Mounds for many years. If not for Yan Dushui successfully breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, their circumstances would surely be far more dire.

‘So the reach of the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition extends this far,’ he reflected. ‘Then again, Daoist Master Yuandao’s lifespan seems practically limitless. Against such a being, what real waves could Yan Dushui or any other vassal ever hope to make?’

He flew onward in silence, and soon, a pillar of light that pierced the heavens came into view. Standing on a flying vessel at its base was an old man with a gentle smile. When he saw Li Ximing, he raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Zhaojing? Fancy meeting you here, Fellow Daoist."

"Greetings, Senior!" Li Ximing called out respectfully.

Li Ximing actually had a rather good impression of this senior, Lingdu. Seeing him now, he temporarily pushed aside his suspicions, bowed properly, and explained, "This junior was entrusted by the Jishan clan with a task to retrieve a certain Qi. They mentioned that the information came from you, Senior, so I dared not act rashly and came to inquire directly."

Lingdu's expression showed immediate understanding. He beckoned Li Ximing aboard the vessel and shook his head. "He pleaded with me about this matter for a very long time. I considered that it would be of great benefit to you as well, so I revealed a tiny bit. I merely mentioned that you cultivate the Bright Yang path. I never imagined the fellow would be so sharp as to piece it all together and find you so quickly."

Li Ximing nodded slightly. Lingdu sighed. "You have met him, then. I imagine he told you quite a sob story. He may seem overly eager, but if he cannot retrieve this item, his descendants will likely have no future to speak of." He glanced at Li Ximing, seemingly understanding his hesitation, and added with a smile, "You must understand, if that item falls into his hands, he truly has no way to deal with it, nor can he publicize its existence. It must ultimately be delivered to my Nine Mounds. But from our perspective, the item isn't going anywhere. It makes no difference whether he retrieves it for us now, or if we retrieve it ourselves in the future."

With those words, everything clicked into place for Li Ximing. Nine Mounds had not known about this treasure before. Yan Dushui's desperate plea had inadvertently revealed its existence. While the item was precious, its acquisition was not an urgent matter for a powerhouse like Nine Mounds. Yan Dushui was old; if he retrieved it, he would dutifully hand it over. If he failed, then after his death, Nine Mounds could simply take it themselves. But for Yan Dushui, the difference between offering it as a tribute and having it seized from his clan after his demise was the difference between survival and extinction.

Li Ximing stroked his beard, nodding slowly as the last of his doubts dissolved.

Lingdu let out another sigh. "We have had dealings for many years, after all. I couldn't bear to see him end up in such a predicament. Putting aside my position in the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition, on a personal level, I truly hoped he could find a path forward. That is why I let slip a hint. I hope you can forgive me for the imposition, Zhaojing."

"This junior understands," Li Ximing replied, his mind clear.

With Lingdu being so transparent, it was clear that he placed a high value on Li Ximing. And by receiving this information, Li Ximing now had a direct understanding of their bottom line. It meant he could ask this powerful Purple Mansion cultivator for assistance, provided his requests were not outrageous.

If Daoist Master Yuandao's previous aid could be seen as a display of Nine Mounds' magnanimity, then Lingdu's deliberate assistance felt far more personal. The Nine Mounds Daoist tradition never spoke of offering aid and disliked deep entanglements, yet their bias toward their own allies was ever-present, sometimes overt, sometimes subtle. This realization filled Li Ximing with a mixture of joy and apprehension.

After all, help from a premier Daoist tradition rarely came without strings attached. Even so, every interaction thus far had been marked by goodwill. He nodded silently and bowed once more to the Daoist Master from Nine Mounds, his voice filled with sincerity.

"Many thanks, Senior!"
