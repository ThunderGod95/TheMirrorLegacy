# Chapter 1252: Qing Feng

Great Song, the Imperial Palace.

As evening fell, the sun set and the stars emerged, casting a soft glow upon the land. Darkness surged within the Great Void, where the faint sound of a moving door could be heard. The bronze grand hall was suffused with a wondrous, profound light, vibrant with myriad colors.

After an unknown amount of time, the hall's door began to tremble, slowly sliding open. A man in black with an ordinary face walked out at a leisurely pace, his body surging with divine abilities. He stood before the hall, looking bold and triumphant.

'The 'Locust Shade Ghost'... it's done!'

A Great Daoist Master of four divine abilities!

This person was none other than Yang Ruiyi!

The Locust Shade Ghost held no small amount of fame in the current world, and Yang Ruiyi, hailing from the Underworld's Yang family, naturally did not underestimate it; he even considered this art a crucial step for him to cross into the Purple Mystery!

'Its ancient name was World-Hindering Miasma, a first-rate divine ability, but like Fading Sundown Abyss and Gully-Hiding Skiff, it had fallen into obscurity because of its masters' fruition attainments...'

He felt refreshed and invigorated, his gaze sharp, yet he did not linger.

Stepping out of the Great Void and onto solid ground, he made his way toward the palace complex. Partway there, he saw a minor official waiting before a great hall and said quietly:

"I am Yang Ruiyi, here to see His Majesty. Please announce my presence."

The young attendant recognized him at once, dropped to his knees with a thud, and exclaimed in alarm:

"Grand General... Grand General... His Majesty... His Majesty has left the Dragon's Tail Path and is summoning his ministers in the front garden..."

"Oh?"

Having just emerged from seclusion, Yang Ruiyi was rather perplexed, but he simply gave a casual nod. His steps seemed slow but were deceptively fast as he crossed the palace road traversing the complex. He passed by fountains and extinguished braziers, the sound of golden plates clanging, and could vaguely make out a pavilion. There were no guards on either side, only the Emperor standing within, his hands clasped behind his back.

Yang Ruiyi's heart sank.

He knew, of course, what this place was… Yang Zhuo rarely indulged in leisure and went to the front garden even less. On the rare occasion he did, it was to meet with family or ministers, and he was particularly unaccustomed to standing in a pavilion that was covered from above but open on all sides.

There was only one exception.

'This was the place... where he met King Wei back then.'

'Who is he meeting?'

Even though Yang Ruiyi had stepped into the Purple Mystery and become one of the most venerated Great Daoist Masters in the mortal world, he remained perfectly deferential at this moment. Arriving before the pavilion, he bowed low and said:

"Your servant, Yang Ruiyi… pays his respects to Your Majesty!"

The person in the pavilion turned, his gaze sweeping over him dispassionately as he said:

"Congratulations, Grand General!"

Yang Ruiyi hurriedly gave a respectful smile and said in a low voice:

"Your Majesty's immortal might is boundless. It was only by basking in your celestial virtue that this servant was able to cross this profound threshold..."

"Enough!"

His Majesty was clearly uninterested in such words. He cut him off with a wave of his hand and said:

"The 'Locust Shade Ghost'… now that this path is complete, the 'Upper Shaman' lineage has gained significant stature. You are more than capable of holding your own!"

Yang Ruiyi nodded repeatedly and said with great solemnity:

"Since this servant wields the treasure of 'Exiled Qi,' commands the light of 'True Qi,' and has now entered the Purple Mystery, the likes of Touba Qiye and Gao Fu are of little consequence. The only cultivators in the world who could secure a victory over me are Wei Xuanyin and Touba Qitian."

Although Yang Ruiyi's cultivation talent was not astonishing, his divine abilities and spiritual treasures were all top-tier. Back when he commanded the power of Martial Cultivation, he could already withstand a Great Daoist Master; now that he had become one himself, further enhanced by Martial Cultivation, he was formidable indeed!

The Song Emperor was not surprised to hear these words. With his hands behind his back, he said:

"Your emergence from seclusion... is timely."

"We intend to move the capital."

These four simple words were like a clap of thunder, leaving Yang Ruiyi stunned on the spot. The Great Daoist Master was speechless for a moment, staring blankly at the steps before him. He raised his head and said hoarsely:

"Your Majesty said... move the capital?"

The monarch of Great Song took two steps, walked up to him, and finally showed a smile:

"To the old northern capital, by the river."

The stunned look in Yang Ruiyi's eyes grew stronger, instantly turning into horror. He said in a low voice:

"Your Majesty! The Northern Zhao cannot be underestimated! We have only slain a single Qi Lanyan! Once we are by the river, if the north marches a great army south and threatens the capital, what then? A wise man does not stand beneath a crumbling wall! Just now... who gave Your Majesty this idea? Your Majesty!"

His gaze sharpened instantly as he said in a heavy voice:

"This person must be a treacherous villain! He should be executed to uphold the laws of the nation!"

Yang Ruiyi had never imagined that after he came out of seclusion, the Song Emperor would suddenly want to move the capital!

'Don't be fooled by how easily and gloriously Li Zhouwei killed Vast Cicada and Qi Lanyan... this is a completely different matter. The power hidden beneath the surface in the north is unfathomable, not something a single Yang family can withstand!'

'Jiangnan, no matter what, is the Underworld's territory! No matter what happens, there will be support from the higher-ups. But once we go north, if something happens and ruins the great matter of True Qi, not even Judge Yang could bear that responsibility. The entire Yang family would be buried with him!'

For a moment his voice trembled, but unfortunately, the person before him seemed very relaxed, shaking his head with a smile:

"This was Our own idea, it has nothing to do with them... As for the person from just now..."

"It was Li Jiangchun."

The Song Emperor, with a rare hint of playfulness, said:

"He's not so easy to execute."

Hearing this name, the expression in Yang Ruiyi's eyes softened slightly. He quickly calmed down and asked softly:

"Your Majesty... to which prefecture do you wish to move the capital?"

Yang Zhuo stared at him quietly and said:

"Guzhou."

'Jingchuan Prefecture…'

A look of understanding gradually dawned on Yang Ruiyi's face.

This Guzhou was, in fact, a place of great significance. Even the character for 'Gu,' meaning hub, was a renowned name among the great Daoist traditions.

Back then, when the Human Emperor established his dynasty and founded the first capital under Heaven, he sent Taishu Kuangyi to measure the land and enfeoff the feudal lords. This great figure of ancient times, who had attained the Dao, drove a horse-drawn chariot, cracking his whip. Wherever he passed, the wheel ruts were crimson red, circling the city walls. He drove for three days and three nights.

These ruts connected head to tail, demarcating the capital's territory. The great city built upon it was called [Rut Capital] and [Hub City].

At the time, it was mostly called [Rut Capital]. Later, when True Monarch Yuanxia attained the Dao, his personal name was Zhe, so to avoid the taboo of using it, the latter name was gradually adopted, becoming [Hub City], and eventually developing into the [Hub Prefecture] of that era.

And [Hub Prefecture], as the only central metropolis in the north at that time, gathered talents from all under Heaven. The Wang clan of Comprehending Profoundity's first disciple, the Jiang surname of Encompassing Profoundity, and even his own Yang family all originated from this prefecture!

Back then, the Yang family's ancestor cultivated under the Heaven-Governing sect. This ancestor was a Daoist Master of the Attendant Mansion. Later, they traveled south. When the great families established prefectural cities in their new homes, his Yang family and the Liu family hit it off and naturally established a Guzhou as well.

This Guzhou was the nine-generation capital of Chu, and also the capital of the Yue State. It is the present-day Jingchuan Prefecture of Sword Gate!

He faintly breathed a sigh of relief.

'This way... it's at least on the edge of Jiangnan.'

The old capital that Yang Ruiyi first thought of was the Great Ning capital, Jiangling! If it were located in Jianghuai, that would be delivering their own vital point into the hands of others... If any party had dissenting thoughts, it would absolutely be a great threat that could shake the foundations of the state!

But even so, it did not mean Yang Ruiyi was supportive.

He bowed sincerely and said in a low voice:

"Your Majesty! The north's wolfish ambitions cannot be underestimated. Simin has the five-hundred-year foundation of an Immortal Sect before it and the aura of our Yang family's state-founding after it. It is encircled by mountains and can secure the nation... Although Jingchuan is an old prefecture, it has no strategic terrain to defend. If the north were to rebel one day, the chaos would be at the Emperor's doorstep!"

"In all matters, one must consider defeat before victory. This servant does not dare speak rashly, but with the capital in the south, the lands on both shores are merely grounds to maneuver, allowing for free advance and retreat. With the capital in the north, we can advance but not retreat. I fear we will be plotted against!"

Yang Zhuo listened quietly and said with a smile:

"Jianghuai is already pacified, and how could Baihai be without mountains to defend? Guzhou is situated at the nation's gate, and it was the capital of Yue. Simin is deep within the mountains, merely a barbarian prefecture... The ancestral foundation of Great Chu was in the south, yet they dared to abandon Lingqiu for Guzhou. The old capital of Great Song's former state is in the north; how can we reside remotely in the deep mountains?"

This emperor of Great Song was elegant and composed, a smile on his face, but his words were filled with a bone-chilling cold:

"The Guzhou Cauldron... the Guzhou Cauldron. If we do not go to Guzhou, how can we place the cauldron? How can one rule all under Heaven from a capital in Nanling?"

These words left no room for argument. Yang Ruiyi was speechless, his heart finally sinking into an abyss. He felt a chill creep up his spine, as if something invisible was staring at him.

As the Song Emperor, Yang Zhuo's every move was significant. Once certain words were spoken, there was no taking them back! Regardless of whether these words aligned with the Yang family's interests, Yang Ruiyi had no right to object!

He could only bow deeply and say respectfully:

"The imperial will is firm. This servant can only obey."

The person above was not surprised and said indifferently:

"Now that you have emerged from seclusion, there is no need to let others know. There will be a time for your use. It is just that Jiangliang is not here at the moment. We do not feel at ease entrusting the matter of moving the capital to anyone. Do you have any candidates to recommend?"

Yang Ruiyi instantly shifted his mindset and said softly:

"The Marquis of Ping'an is loyal and scrupulous, pure and humble. Cheng Jiuwen has managed many regions and understands the bigger picture. The Marquis of Anyang is sincere, respectful, and modest, treating his superiors with propriety and his subordinates with harmony. They are capable of this great responsibility."

"We should act under the pretext of repairing the old palace and honoring the ancestors. First, send these three to construct the palace buildings and organize the spiritual qi of the earth veins in preparation for any unforeseen needs. Once the overall situation is settled and the time is right, we can move the Imperial Palace north."

Clearly, this Grand General was no fool and immediately began to probe. The Song Emperor, however, nodded calmly:

"Ruizao is of imperial descent, Zhouluo is of a royal clan, and Cheng Jiuwen is from a prefectural clan. The local factions will be harmonious. We are still short one capable minister—let Sima Xun go as well. He is eloquent and resourceful, and can be of use."

Yang Ruiyi lowered his eyes and bowed, a glimmer of understanding dawning in the depths of his heart.

'Li Zhouluo... Li Jiangchun... I fear this is related to the Li family...'

Yang Ruiyi waited for a moment. Seeing the emperor wave his hand dismissively, he finally rose and withdrew. As he walked out of the Imperial Palace, the reverence on his face gradually turned to anxiety.

He pondered deeply, his steps gradually slowing. He stepped into the Great Void, and in but a moment, the great bronze hall appeared, arrayed within the void.

Yang Ruiyi landed before the hall, staring at the bronze doors without a word for a long time. After an unknown period, he finally pushed the doors open and entered.

The great hall was dim and obscure. The bronze platform was empty, with no figures to be seen, nor any letters or jade slips—only endless darkness.

'No orders.'

'No orders... is also an order.'

Their silence was as soundless as the darkness in the hall. Faced with the Song Emperor's so-called "unauthorized decision," what else could they do but remain silent?

Yang Ruiyi vaguely understood, staring quietly at the empty bronze platform:

'Only we... the Yang family must bear this alone.'

---

The Great Desert.

Inside the grand hall, crimson flames surged as the brilliance of Li Fire spilled forth. A youth in crimson robes sat cross-legged in the center, his eyes tightly closed. His hands were clasped before his chest, and the color of Li Fire could be faintly seen between his fingers.

This illusory radiance was like a layer of golden gauze draping over him, or like a golden mist, ethereal before the eyes. It reflected the various other lights, revealing a magnificent righteousness!

'Concordant Conquest!'

He opened his eyes and sighed softly:

"Finally... I've forged my immortal foundation!"

Without much thought, he decisively stood up, rose on a stream of fire, and headed toward Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

Fierce flames raged in the mountains. A golden cauldron hung in the sky, with Molten Fire dancing at its base. The Daoist Master on the stone platform had his hands in a seal, seemingly manipulating the flames, but when Li Jiangqian drew closer to look, a smile appeared in his eyes.

This 'Li Ximing' had red lips and white teeth, and though his eyes were slightly closed, they held a strange glint.

Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body!

And on a jade pillar to the side, the real Li Ximing was slowly opening his eyes, looking at him with a smile:

"Changli has arrived!"

Li Jiangqian bowed and asked doubtfully:

"Why is Senior Ji'an not here?"

Li Ximing chuckled lightly:

"He saw me using my unique secret technique and felt it improper to watch, so he went down the mountain to wait. Then he felt it wasn't right to just wait idly, so every so often he raises an immortal terrace by the shore to preach the Dao to the disciples, which also supplements my own nourishing efforts."

With the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body, Li Ximing was just cultivating as usual. Li Jiangqian nodded in understanding and said softly:

"This junior has come... to request a pill!"

Li Jiangqian's foundation was already considered profound, and he cultivated by absorbing spiritual qi. Yet, it had taken him more than two full years to forge this immortal foundation—this was not a short time, especially with a plentiful supply of medicinal pills. For Purple Mansion Realm cultivation, more time was spent later on perfecting the immortal foundation and on repeated failures.

'Concordant Conquest is truly not simple…'

But now, perfecting the immortal foundation was a matter of slow, patient work. His cultivation speed was ultimately far inferior to his father, Li Zhouwei. Li Zhouwei might have succeeded in three years, while he might need more than five. Under such a time constraint, his situation felt even more pressing.

Because of this, Li Jiangqian had to consider the issue of time.

'Even with the help of Talisman Qi, the remaining time to achieve two divine abilities still seems tight.'

His eyes were filled with resolve:

"I have come today to boldly ask Grand-Uncle... for one Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder and one Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill..."

To Li Ximing, the Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder was not a big deal. Many were left over from before, and the Li family rarely used them, so there was a surplus. But the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill was quite precious; he still had three left from his trades with Sima Yuanli.

But this Daoist Master Zhaojing was not surprised.

'After all, counting the days, it has been nearly twenty years since he reached the Purple Mansion Realm!'

Twenty years!

In twenty years, Li Zhouwei would have already gone from newly reaching the Purple Mansion Realm to perfecting two divine abilities and preparing to seek a third!

Although from the perspectives of Dao-profundity, resources, and even bloodline lineage, Li Jiangqian had the capital to achieve two divine abilities, the coming great war was hard to predict, and he simply could not afford to fail!

'And in the twenty years since he reached the Purple Mansion Realm, at least half of his time was spent on family matters. From the perspective of shortening his cultivation time and assisting in the attainment of divine abilities, this pill is the most suitable for him right now!'

Li Ximing silently took out a jade box and said:

"This is the time to use it! Those northern cultivators should still have more. When we attack the north, there will naturally be spoils. There is no need to miss your opportunity just to save one or two of these!"

Li Jiangqian nodded gravely, accepted it with thanks, and was just about to rise when he sensed something and looked up. He vaguely saw a streak of crimson light shoot into the sky amidst rolling flames, and an enraged voice echoed through the Great Void:

"Who dares to spy here?!"

An old man in a crimson robe appeared, his beard and hair standing on end. The pale tips of his hair floated in the Li Fire like an old lion, and his eyes shot out beams of Li-Light, staring fixedly at the distant sky!

It was Ji'an!

Although Ji'an was preaching on the shore, more than ninety percent of his attention was still on the lake. He was naturally aware of Li Jiangqian's arrival and had paid it little mind, but he suddenly sensed someone else's prying gaze, and his resulting fury was immense!

The two Daoist Masters on the mountain exchanged a glance and looked up together. The moment Li Jiangqian connected his spiritual sense with his Spirit Probe, he heard a respectful and puzzled voice from the sky:

"This humble one is Qing Feng Cui Jueyin... Having successfully formed my divine ability, I have returned to the lake. May I ask who senior is..."

Hearing this voice, Li Ximing's face lit up with joy, and he immediately stood up from his seat. Li Jiangqian's eyes also brightened with surprise. He connected his spiritual sense and indeed saw a figure standing atop something like a profound staircase of interweaving gold and white light in the Great Void—it was an elegant and noble youth!

Cui Jueyin!

Both were shocked and delighted, but Cui Jueyin in the Great Void was truly perplexed.

He had been in the Dragon Palace for a year and a half. After coming out and receiving news, he was escorted all the way to the mainland by Lu Xu. Without a moment's pause, he had rushed to the lake. Upon entering familiar territory, he naturally did not dare to rashly enter the Purple Mansion's grand array, so he immediately came to Gardenia Scenery Mountain to pay respects to the main family.

Who would have thought there was a Daoist Master preaching at the foot of the mountain, seemingly a friend of the Li family? But the moment he approached, the man's expression had changed instantly, as if he had stepped on his tail. Three Li Fire divine abilities shot towards him, making him feel a strong sense of threat:

'Is this really necessary?!'

"A misunderstanding! A misunderstanding!"

Fortunately, the standoff lasted only a moment. Li Ximing had already stepped out from the Great Void, placing himself between the two. He grabbed Cui Jueyin's hand, overjoyed, and said:

"Jueyin... good lad!"

The Cui clan were an immortal clan for generations, their ancestors officials and nobles. Their appearances and bearing were all exceptional, and Cui Jueyin was a standout among them. Now that he had reached the Purple Mansion Realm, his bearing was even more extraordinary, like an immortal's. A black ink brush hung from his waist, adding to his scholarly elegance.

When Cui Jueyin saw Li Ximing's face, his eyes instantly reddened. He was one to remember kindness. When he left home as a young man, it was this Daoist Master he followed. Whether it was guidance or protection, in the entire great Li family, no one had ever dared to give him trouble…

If Cui Jueyin's feelings for Li Zhouwei were of extreme reverence, then what he felt for Li Ximing was genuine affection for an elder. He turned his head slightly and said hoarsely:

"Jueyin... relied on your grace and was fortunate enough to succeed!"

Li Jiangqian deliberately slowed his pace and arrived a moment later. He smiled and clasped his fist at Cui Jueyin, then turned to Ji'an and said seriously:

"This is a Guest Retainer of my family. I apologize for disturbing you, Senior!"

"Not at all."

Ji'an actually understood very quickly. He had also spent many years overseas. Hearing Cui Jueyin's name, he immediately knew he was from the Cui clan of Chongzhou. A smile quickly spread across his face as he said:

"The Cui clan... I was wondering what was missing by King Wei's side, so it was the Cui clan! My apologies for the offense!"

He didn't say much more, just gave a meaningful smile and descended on his fire. Li Ximing was overcome with emotion and didn't even have time to tend to the old senior's mood. He quickly invited Cui Jueyin inside and sighed:

"With Jueyin's achievement, King Wei is like a tiger that has grown wings. He has gained a capable and trusted minister!"

This was no exaggeration. After all, they had a master-disciple relationship. Cui Jueyin to Li Zhouwei was like Li Jiangliang to Yang Zhuo. He could be called a retainer from his master's early days as well as a capable general. In terms of both loyalty and ability, he was unmatched by others!

Cui Jueyin, however, did not dare accept the praise and repeatedly demurred. Taking a moment, he returned Li Jiangqian's bow and said:

"Congratulations, Your Highness!"

Li Jiangqian smiled and said:

"Now, I should call you... Fellow Daoist Qing Feng!"

Cui Jueyin was clearly not used to such an address. He gave an awkward smile and explained:

"After my achievement, the Daoist Masters in the province found the lineage records of the old Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate. Following the Dao lineage, they found this character 'Qing' for me."

"So you are following the lineage of the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate!"

Li Jiangqian nodded and sighed:

"Your voice is clear and resonant, your posture is graceful. You possess the virtue of a gentleman and magnificent talent. This character 'Feng' (Phoenix) is fitting for Jueyin to use!"

Cui Jueyin looked rather ashamed and said:

"Sparrows are caught in nets, and whales are trapped by snares. How is this an era for being a gentleman? The Daoist Master and King Wei have shown me their sincere hearts; Jueyin is merely repaying their kindness!"

Li Ximing also knew of Chongzhou's difficulties, and he even had a rough idea of their situation. He shook his head silently. Cui Jueyin, however, did not immediately bring up matters concerning Chongzhou, but said after some thought:

"Could I first see... King Wei."

Li Ximing sighed:

"It is not the right time..."

Cui Jueyin astutely ended the topic and nodded silently. Li Jiangqian smiled and said:

"It's the 'Eternal Brightness Steps,' isn't it!"

"Indeed!"

Cui Jueyin bowed deeply, a hint of a smile finally appearing as he raised his brows and said:

"Eternal Brightness Steps: the emperor embodies heaven and earth, and the subject reverently looks up to him. As a subject, one has the merits of pacifying barbarians, selecting officials, quelling chaos, and receiving enlightenment, thereby illuminating the celestial book to have an audience with the emperor."

He turned to Li Ximing and said with a smile:

"With the Daoist Master's 'World's Radiance,' it has the virtue of a monarch and his subject!"

Li Ximing was quite interested. He pinched his fingers together slightly, and a point of rolling Light of the Six Harmonies appeared at his fingertips.

The Light of the Six Harmonies possessed the virtue of promotion and advancement and could be used to empower the cultivators on the lake, but this wondrous effect was useless for the Purple Mansion Realm. Yet now, as it danced on Li Ximing's fingertips, it unexpectedly gave him a faint stirring.

The Light of the Six Harmonies could link with Li Ximing's 'Audience with the Celestial Gate,' but the golden-armored cultivator it condensed was merely a Merciful One, and it consumed two divine abilities to do so. It was truly useless, so he had never used it. He mostly used it for his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body. But now, holding this light, he felt a strange sensation.

'It seems... it can link with his 'Eternal Brightness Steps'...'

The Cui Jueyin before him seemed able to contain the Light of the Six Harmonies just like his 'Audience with the Celestial Gate'!

He just loosened his grip slightly, and it was as if a portion of the power of the Light of the Six Harmonies in his palm was drawn away. The youth was already smiling as he formed a hand seal for his divine ability. A phantom image flashed behind him, brilliance appeared in his palm, and purple flames rolled. The faint image of a celestial gate built of white bricks emerged.

The moment this color appeared, Li Jiangqian's expression changed dramatically!

This power, this aura, although slightly different, was already similar enough!

"Audience with the Celestial Gate?!"

This was the first divine ability he himself had achieved! Li Ximing was simply too familiar with it, so familiar it was unbelievable, and for a moment he was stunned.

"Precisely!"

Cui Jueyin's face was full of a hopeful smile as he nodded and said:

"As long as the Daoist Master leaves a wisp of the Light of the Six Harmonies with me, and we both ensure the Great Void is not cut off between us, I can borrow the Daoist Master's divine ability for six breaths at a critical moment!"

There was a hint of regret in his eyes:

"With my current divine ability and Dao-profundity, it's only for six breaths, and the borrowed divine ability will only have fifty to sixty percent of its power... but when my divine ability improves, there should be progress..."

But the mountain remained silent.

Li Ximing stood stunned, while Li Jiangqian stared blankly at his palm.

'Fifty to sixty percent of Grand-Uncle's divine ability, and only for six breaths... even if it suddenly emerged from him, it wouldn't be enough to decide a great battle... but if... in the future, it were...'

'Father—a White Qilin who has perfected his divine abilities and possesses all five methods?'
