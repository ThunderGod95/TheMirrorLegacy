# Chapter 179: External Cultivator

An Zheyan cupped his fist, then answered in a calm tone.

"To kill Yu Mugao."

"Hmm." Li Tongya chuckled inwardly, maintaining a slight smile on his face. He then softly said, "If Brother Zheyan has come for this matter, then please leave."

"Ling'er, please see the guest out," Li Tongya called out. Right away, Li Xuanling, who had been silently standing in the corner, stepped forward.

An Zheyan hurriedly waved his hand, hastily saying, "Brother Tongya, please hear me out!"

Since Li Tongya did not plan to dismiss him so unceremoniously, he turned his head at his plea.

An Zheyan quickly continued, "Brother Tongya! Although your family is protected by a Sword Immortal and no one dares to look down upon it, the Yu Family has long harbored intentions to sweep across Moongaze Lake... Even if they dare not openly annex your family, they will certainly not refrain from acting in the shadows! Yu Mugao wouldn't dare target Brother Tongya directly, but it's entirely possible for him to hire a few foreign cultivators, rogue cultivators, and outer sect disciples to secretly assassinate your clan's disciples! They'll only be at ease when all your family's promising juniors meet untimely ends."

"Though the Sword Immortal's cultivation is profound, he is far in the southern border. The Yu Family also has backing within the sect... As long as they leave no evidence, the Qingsui Sword Immortal can't possibly cross thousands of li to act for one or two mysteriously deceased juniors."

An Zheyan laid out these points bluntly, causing Li Tongya to frown deeply.

"Brother Zheyan seems to know quite a bit about the Yu Family," he remarked with a grave tone.

Rather than persuading Li Tongya, An Zheyan's words only raised more suspicions in his mind. Living as neighbors for so many years, both sides had their spies in each other's territories, and Li Tongya was somewhat aware of An Zheyan's actions.

Yu Mugao is indeed ruthless enough to do such a thing, but An Zheyan has always been selfish and stingy, not someone who typically thinks in such grand terms... Why is he suddenly speaking like this today?

Seeing Li Tongya silent, An Zheyan thought he had swayed him and pressed on. "Even if one does not provoke the tiger, the tiger may still harbor the intent to harm. Although your family resides peacefully on its land, if the Yu Family wishes to monopolize the Moongaze Lake, they will inevitably need to suppress your family. Unable to find a way to deal with Brother Tongya directly, they will certainly plot against the younger generation in your family."

Li Tongya shook his head, finding an excuse to reply in a stern voice, "Both Yu Mugao and Yu Mujian are of good talent. Not to mention Yu Xiaogui who is at the Foundation Establishment Realm, several members of their generation of Xiao are also at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm. There is no need for them to fear my Li Family. I will say it again, Brother Zheyan, if you have come for this matter, there's no need to speak further. Please leave."

An Zheyan, seeing that Li Tongya was indeed unmoved, did not panic but spoke softly, "Every word I've spoken is true, and Brother Tongya knows it. If your family doesn't believe me, just wait a few more years, and you will understand the value of my warning."

After cupping his fist, he rode the wind away, leaving Li Tongya standing there for a while. Li Xuanling approached hesitantly, whispering, "I find his words quite reasonable; we should be cautious."

Li Tongya, with a furrowed brow, sat back down. He was feeling increasingly uneasy. After pondering for a moment, he responded, "Those words aren't something An Zheyan would come up with on his own... This must be An Jingming's idea."

He then recalled Yu Mugao's character and thought about the close relationship between the An and Yu families. Li Tongya felt somewhat troubled and spoke after some time, his voice soft.

"Given Yu Mugao's nature, he would indeed do such a thing... I'm sure he'll target not only our family. An Jingming must also be on his mind, hence An Zheyan is rushing to find someone to deal with Yu Mugao."

Li Xuanling, who was standing by, frowned and replied, "But that man is always guarded by peak Qi Cultivators when he leaves home... he's not easy to kill. Doing so would just offend the Yu Family for no reason."

Li Tongya nodded and advised, "This is an impractical matter. For now, let's ensure our younger family members don't leave our territory, and wait until the Xiao Family finishes executing their plans. By then, we may be able to borrow the Xiao Family's strength and no longer allow the Yu Family to dominate unchecked."

Li Xuanling noted his words. Li Tongya looked at the sky and instructed, "Now that we have Snake Essence Pills, I can try to break through to the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Although it's been only two to three years since my last breakthrough and it's a bit rushed, there's no other choice. I must try to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm before turning sixty..."

Li Xuanling clenched his teeth, his eyes filled with deep worry. After composing his thoughts for a long while, he finally spoke with unease, "I have heard that the breakthrough from Qi Cultivation Realm to Foundation Establishment Realm is fraught with danger, almost a nine in ten chance of death. With Father being a late-stage Qi Cultivator, you are the pillar of our family. I'm afraid..."

His voice trailed off.
ùíªùëüùò¶ùò¶ùò∏‚ÑØùí∑ùëõùò∞ùìã‚ÑØùò≠.ùò§ùò∞ùòÆ

Li Tongya was initially startled, then sighed deeply. Looking at his son, now a father himself with a fully grown beard, he felt somewhat comforted and responded, "I have only consumed three pills and one talisman qi in my cultivation journey, relying solely on diligent practice without taking any precious medicines or spirit items like those in the three sects and seven gates do. This breakthrough indeed carries a high risk of death..."

Seeing Li Xuanling's worried gaze, Li Tongya reassured him with a warm smile, "But I have been earnestly cultivating day and night, aiming to reach Foundation Establishment Realm before I turn sixty, even if it's just a slightly better chance. If our Li Family wishes to advance further, we must have a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. In this vast Moongaze Lake, only those at the Foundation Establishment Realm can truly make their voices heard. With the prestige of your fourth uncle, our Li Family will be worry-free for the next fifty years... It's the perfect opportunity to attempt the Foundation Establishment Realm. If I fail and perish, the Yu Family won't trouble us too much and lower their guard instead."

"I understand."

Li Xuanling cupped his fist, and Li Tongya nodded slightly before stepping out of the courtyard and flying toward Meiche Peak in the south.

Li Xuanling watched with concern, hoping that the day Li Tongya's attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm would come later rather than sooner.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

In Lijing Town, the biggest and most lavish residence was not that of Li Xuanxuan at the foot of the mountain. Compared by size and splendor, Li Xuanxuan's residence would likely be ranked lower. The residences of clan uncles and elders are among the top, followed by the Chen, Liu, Ren, and Tian families, with Li Xuanxuan's coming last.

Chen Donghe, who had been guarding Mount Huaqian for years and cultivating with the aid of the spirit spring on the mountain, rarely returned home. To his surprise, the Chen Family's estate had expanded significantly, now housing over three hundred family members. Without a map listing names, it would be almost impossible to find someone.

As he approached the courtyard, firecrackers sounded. He noticed that people lined both sides. His only surviving brother, now over fifty and considered the head of the household, waited respectfully at the entrance.

A boy in a padded jacket stared at him intently, recognized by Chen Donghe's spiritual sense as the special child the family had called him back for.

"How old are you now?" Chen Donghe asked the child.

"Eight," was the reply.

Chen Donghe scrutinized the boy. He was biting his lip and staring back at Chen Donghe innocently, and he asked his next question.

"What is your name?"

"Chen Mufeng," the boy answered.

Standing up, Chen Donghe noticed his brother approaching respectfully, speaking in a tone of unfamiliar deference.

"We've asked the Immortal Master here in the hope that he might mentor the child... The Chen Family would be eternally grateful!"

After finishing his words, with a thud, he fell to the ground on his knees. The crowd around him followed suit, their pleading voices swelling like a tide.

Chen Donghe, focusing on the boy and ignoring the surrounding people, pondered to himself.

I cannot personally mentor this child, as it would recklessly leave traces... I'll find him a good family instead. This is the least I can do for the Chen Family.

Helping his brother up, he said solemnly, "I cannot mentor this child personally but I can find him a good teacher..."

His brother's expression shifted with uncertainty, and he was momentarily stunned. He hesitated. "Will this teacher be someone from the Tian... or Liu Family?"

Chen Donghe, not often interacting with external cultivators at the foot of the mountain, paused at this question.

A realization struck him.

The Li Family has accepted thirty to forty external cultivators over the decades, most of whom are at the first or second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. However... there are also three or four at the fourth stage, and there might be factions involved which also concerns the Chen Family's position.

Seeing Chen Donghe's reaction, his brother became somewhat flustered, squeezing out a smile through his wrinkled face. He responded hurriedly, "We do not doubt the Immortal Master's decision nor wish to choose shamelessly; we just need to know the name of the teacher to understand whom the child will be mentored by..."

Chen Donghe, smiling warmly, reassured his brother.

"Don't worry, brother. It'll be someone from the Li Family."

"The Li Family?!"

His brother was immediately overjoyed, smiling broadly to reveal a few decayed teeth. He exclaimed, "That's excellent! Excellent indeed!"

With a hearty laugh, Chen Donghe took Chen Mufeng's hand and soared into the sky, leaving a group of envious onlookers on the ground.

Flying over the town for a while, Chen Donghe descended into a spacious courtyard with the trembling child in his arms. Chen Mufeng stumbled a few steps upon landing.

Chen Donghe released his hand and saw a person standing in front of the stone door with gray hair and a straight posture. He looked somewhat surprised to see him and greeted, "Greetings, Brother Donghe... This is quite rare. Are you here looking for that Shamoli?"

"Not at all."

Chen Donghe returned the greeting with a warm smile, pulling the child closer and softly adding, "I'm here looking for Brother Qiuyang."

Li Qiuyang stepped forward and took a seat on a stone bench in the courtyard, sweeping his spiritual sense over the area while keeping an eye on the stone door to the room where Shamoli had retreated for seclusion.

He smiled.

"Brother Donghe, just speak your mind."

Chen Donghe nodded, speaking seriously, "I returned to the Chen Family recently, and we have a child with a spiritual orifice. They wanted me to mentor him, but I felt it wasn't right for me to take him under my wing... I was hoping to entrust him to you."

"Oh?"

Li Qiuyang lowered his head but did not immediately agree. He observed Chen Mufeng for a while. Seeing the boy was well-behaved, Chen Donghe transmitted his voice.

"I've heard Brother Qiuyang's sons are without spiritual orifice, which will be troublesome in the future. Why not take this child as your disciple and later marry him to one of your daughters? When you pass away in a hundred years, your descendants will have someone to shelter them..."

This suggestion struck a chord with Li Qiuyang, who immediately brightened up and began nodding vigorously. He then said solemnly, "Since brother has put it this way, I will take the child under my wing."

Chen Donghe laughed heartily, patting the boy's back and beaming.

"Call him Master."

"Master!"

The boy obediently did so and Li Qiuyang warmly took his hand, asking for his birthdate and name.

After they had spoken, Chen Donghe then spoke softly, "I have a question for Brother Qiuyang..."

"Go ahead," Li Qiuyang replied as he looked up.

Chen Donghe took out two small cups and a gourd from his storage pouch, filled the cups with clear wine, and then said softly, "Having practiced on Mount Huaqian for many years, I'm not very familiar with the external cultivators of our home... Could Brother Qiuyang enlighten me?"

"Ah, that matter!"

Li Qiuyang was about to sip from his cup but set down the jade cup, looking toward the closed stone door before letting out a loud, hearty laugh.

"There are twenty-eight external cultivators of the Embryonic Breathing Realm in our family now, and six from the Ye Family have changed their surname to Li. Most are at the first or second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, hardly worth mentioning... However, a few early cultivators with decent talent are noteworthy."
ùëìùëüùëíùò¶ùìåùëíùëèùëõùëúùò∑ùëíùò≠.ùí∏ùò∞ùëö

Li Qiuyang glanced at Chen Mufeng next to him, who was all ears. He nodded slightly, and continued solemnly, "The first‚Äîat the fifth stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm‚Äîis surnamed Tian, related to the... Family Head, the Great King's wife's family."

Li Qiuyang's mention of "the Great King'' silenced them both. Both of them had been through thick and thin with Li Xiangping and everyone called him the "Great King" while they were in the territory of Mount Yue.

"The Great King passed away in the lands of Mount Yue, and his mother followed in sorrow within a few years. The Tian Family has declined quite a bit, but this man's talent is decent; now at forty, his likelihood of breaking through to the Qi Cultivation Realm isn't high, but still possible. He's currently in charge of managing the cultivation of the Spirit Paddies in town with quite a few people covertly supporting him, and can be considered a leader of one faction. Following them are the Liu and Ren families, both at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm but mostly without a chance to break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, each leading a faction."

Chen Donghe sipped the clear wine, frowning slightly, and asked in a low voice, "Is this known to the family?"

"I wouldn't know..." Li Qiuyang said as he shook his head, his spiritual sense sweeping inside and outside the courtyard before whispering, "Such matters should be managed by the Clan Affairs Courtyard... I avoid these affairs as much as possible. Who in the Li Family doesn't fear the Clan Affairs Courtyard?"

Realization struck Chen Donghe and he quickly apologized. After a moment of thought, he asked, "Is the struggle intense?"

"It used to be manageable."

Li Qiuyang's voice had grown even lower, the shallow wrinkles at the corners of his eyes becoming even more evident in the dim light.

He softly continued, "After all... each family has its interests, and the output of each spirit field differs; so does the stipend provided. These people used to vie for the better fields to skive off, and no one was willing to take the barren ones... Since the Young Master Xiu took over, the factions have become increasingly antagonistic. Many people have been squeezed into the barren lands due to their disputes, having no choice but to toil thanklessly."

"I see," Chen Donghe responded as he nodded slightly, pondering deeply to himself.

This matter probably needs to be reported to the family for Li Xuanling and others to decide, to prevent long-term issues from brewing...

After bidding farewell to Li Qiuyang, he flew away from the courtyard and headed toward the mountain, leaving Li Qiuyang in the courtyard silently watching his departure direction. He then eventually smiled and chuckled to himself.

"He'er never changes!"
