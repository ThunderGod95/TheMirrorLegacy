# Chapter 1263: Before the Pass

The earth-shaking sound made Jiang Toushou's colossal Dharma Body snap its head up, his gaze turning grim and his heart ice-cold.

‘The Myriad Malice Golden Qi Umbrella…’

Golden qi roiled through the sky as streams of white qi like bolts of silk descended, and the pupils of the general holding the blood axe slowly widened as he stared intently at the great white umbrella; he seemed to want to cry out, but the breath caught in his throat and finally emerged as a heavy sigh.

‘It's Changyun… they're already here…’

As if in answer to his words, the golden qi filling the sky crashed down. Changyun soared high above as countless points of golden light converged between his brows, forming a colossal golden pillar of light that swept across the battlefield.

This light was vast and boundless; it had once contended with Li Zhouwei's Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, shattering that heavenly light with unstoppable force and suppressing even Li Zhouwei himself!

That previous attack had been cursory, but now, having accumulated power over a long time, it smashed squarely into the various Buddhists who were focused on their own full-powered attacks, instantly scattering their tightly linked auras; and just then, Yin Juexi's figure decisively appeared, his hands pressed together as an invisible white light enveloped the four directions.

Assistance in Usurpation!

Once this Cultivation Transcendence divine ability was unleashed, it unexpectedly resonated with the Geng Metal qi dancing in the sky. They connected and aided one another, reaching a powerful accord that instantly isolated the four directions. 

Not only were the auras between the various cultivators severed, preventing them from forming arrays, but even the Great Void showed flickering, ribbon-like signs of tearing.

‘Good!’

Changyun was no common cultivator, being secretly affiliated with the Golden Feather family and possessing a profound background, and now he pushed the long-accumulated power of his Spiritual Treasure to its limit; currents of golden-white qi stretched from heaven to earth, not only enveloping the two incomparably massive golden bodies but also continuing to expand outward, isolating each and every Buddhist cultivator!

Changyun stood at the center of this golden-white storm, his spirits soaring, and bellowed,

“Daoist Friend Yu, cut off their retreat!”

His voice, infused with a divine ability, echoed throughout heaven and earth.

An endless tide of white qi surged forth, forcing a white-haired old man to stroll out from the Great Void, holding a white jade vase of exquisite color that seemed connected to another world as it endlessly spewed forth white qi.

‘Yu Xi!’

‘Yu Xi has surrendered!’

Shock and rage filled Jiang Toushou's heart, but having no time to concern himself with the old Daoist Master, an even deeper chill rose within him as he stared at the fearless, high-spirited Changyun, his voice laced with both shock and hatred.

“Do you really think you have us cornered!”

Jiang Toushou and Xiaodisa were both six-life Mahas, and reaching the sixth life made one a great personage in the Buddhist Lands capable of governing an entire region; in earlier years, either one of them leading a force south would have shaken two nations, and in terms of combat, even Yang Ruiyi could not have easily defeated him before crossing into the Purple Mystery realm!

With Zanmen at their backs, their power was terrifying, and even with a Great Daoist Master present and having already lost the first move, Jiang Toushou should have felt no fear!

‘Even if Li Zhouwei himself were here, along with those two mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, we could still turn and retreat with ease!’

Changyun appeared to be in a magnificent position, but standing alone before two six-life Mahas, he should have been the one retreating immediately; Jiang Toushou truly had no idea where his confidence came from—he had even casually played a potential trump card like Yu Xi just to cut off their escape route.

‘Could Yang Ruiyi also be here… Although he's crossed into the Purple Mystery realm, isn't he clearly on the eastern front holding off Touba Qiye!’

But he had no time to think, as the surrounding scenery was submerged in a boundless water mist. Jiang Toushou merely sneered and thought to himself,

‘What a beautifully crafted plan!’

Changyun cultivated Geng Metal and used his Spiritual Treasure to stir the winds of change, hoping to throw the Buddhist lines into disarray so they could not support each other, but wasn't his ambition a little too great!

‘If he had only enveloped the two of us, then with the help of that Cultivation Transcendence cultivator, it might have been somewhat difficult, and we would have had to deal with that early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator first; but now he's cast his net so wide it blots out the sky, how could it possibly withstand a focused breakthrough! At most, it will only affect one or two of the Merciful Ones.’

Unclear on the situation, Jiang Toushou and Xiaodisa naturally released their Buddhist light in unison to break through the golden wind. Just as their radiances were about to merge, a streak of crimson suddenly flowed through the vast white mist!

This crimson streak closed the distance between them in an instant, bringing with it the rolling sands of a great desert. A darkness so thick one could not see their hand in front of their face engulfed the two of them. A massive setting sun crouched on the horizon, but a golden glint shone from the sky above!

A young man in ferocious black armor, a glittering golden halberd in his hands, descended from the heavens!

Li Zhouwei!

The White Qilin, wielding the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, having prepared for this moment!

Jiang Toushou was obstinate and conceited, while Xiaodisa was arrogant and immodest; neither of these two Buddhist cultivators had a good reputation in the north, both being veritable villains, but when this familiar scene appeared, both Mahas' expressions changed.

Such a blood-red sunset, such a halberd descending from the sky; the image that appeared in their minds was surprisingly identical.

‘Baixiang Valley!’

Vast Cicada!

The Buddhist cultivators below might not know how Vast Cicada had died, but these two knew perfectly well.

When those Merciful Ones had fled from Baixiang Valley back then, they were escorted to Mount Dayang, where their souls were surveyed to reproduce the scene; Jiang Toushou had been sitting high in a side seat, and Xiaodisa had been standing behind Liangli of the Sea of Desire Mahas, Tian Langzhi. They had seen it all most clearly!

‘Although Vast Cicada couldn't contact the Precious Tusk, his death wasn't unjust. Never mind that he had only cultivated for five lives, under that halberd strike… even a six-life Maha like us would only have one path: grievous injury and imminent death!’

Back then, he, Jiang Toushou, had constantly spat the words 'that Wei scourge'! 

Why was it that later, every time he said it, he felt a little less confident… until after Qi Lanyan fell, he simply did not dare say it anymore?

Li Zhouwei could kill him, and he would dare to kill him!

To see this scene now was a vision of utter slaughter, of supreme terror.

Although the two Buddhists' brands of tyranny differed, they fled in exactly the same manner; one leaped north, the other was forced south. Two dignified six-life Mahas, and not one dared to receive the blow!

In the distance, Gongsun Bei was also startled, but he frowned and watched closely, and in a mere instant, what he saw made him sigh in silence.

Li Zhouwei had already slowed his movements, casually hooking the King's Halberd back onto his waist, a faint smile in his eyes.

‘The effect was rather good.’

It was nothing complicated; how could the scene of Vast Cicada's death be so easily reproduced? In truth, once the Radiant Sun King's Halberd was used in a sneak attack, its power diminished. It was only because his reputation for killing Vast Cicada and Qi Lanyan was so great, and because these two had never fought him before and were not of one mind…

With the Buddhist cultivators' nature of 'let my Daoist friend die, not me,' it was certain that neither would dare stand before him!

As he expected, the two instantly tread upon multicolored light to pull away, and Yu Xi took the opportunity to descend from the sky, blocking Xiaodisa's path with a grim expression.

Xiaodisa, however, recognized him and said faintly,

“Daoist friend, why must you be a running dog for the Song?”

But no one answered him. Instead, a sense of danger continuously assaulted his mind. Xiaodisa abruptly turned his head, and a multicolored light flashed in his eyes.

A brilliant light of Harmonising Metal, as if from beyond the heavens, came crashing down on his head!

Heavenly Harmonising Fullness.

Liu Changdie!

Yu Xi also stepped forward; he had received only one order: to hold Xiaodisa back at all costs!

Xiaodisa and Jiang Toushou were difficult to separate in terms of strength, but Xiaodisa's will to fight was certainly extremely low. Yu Xi had little offensive capability and was weaker than him, but he was more than capable of stalling. With the Valley Water divine ability augmenting him, he was impossible to kill and impossible to shake off. As long as Yu Xi was willing to go all out, Liu Changdie likewise had the ability to retreat, advancing and withdrawing as he pleased. If Xiaodisa's desire to provide aid was not firm enough, he could very well be tied down!

This was also why Li Zhouwei, sensing something was amiss, had insisted on making a personal trip to Ruzhou; no matter who came out of the pass, Yu Xi's Valley Water divine ability would be of great use.

At the same time, the light of the Supreme Yang descended from the sky. Lin Chensheng arrived on the wind, first subduing one Merciful One, while a black cord shot from his other sleeve to block a Merciful One attacking Kuang Hong. The two of them acted together to hold back the group of Merciful Ones.

Jiang Toushou landed on the other side, his expression dark. He looked at Changyun, who had landed before him on the wind, a hint of ridicule in his eyes as he spoke.

“Daoist Master, you think… you can hold me for how long?”

Changyun laughed heartily.

“Longer than Daoist Friend Gongsun, and that will be enough!”

Indeed, Li Zhouwei, who was not at the center of the battlefield, did not go after Jiang Toushou. The blood-red desert had already extended forth, latching onto another person on the horizon.

Gongsun Bei.

The moment this general met the gaze of that black-armored figure, he found himself in a blood-red desert of fading light, broken armor, and severed arrowheads. A massive setting sun lurked on the horizon as the young man alone strode through the air.

Gongsun Bei was not surprised, even finding it to be expected, and he only slowly raised the blood-red long axe in his hand.

Before he had even left Zanmen, he knew that in this battle, Li Zhouwei would be intent on killing him. If not now, then not long from now. Otherwise, why such urgency?

‘There is no room for maneuver!’

There was no need to even speak of minor skirmishes. When the great Song was founded, during the great battle on the river, it was he, Gongsun Bei, who had suppressed him with a Spiritual Treasure, grievously injuring Li Zhouwei. Later, at the White River, it was also he who had laid in wait with his Spiritual Treasure. He had even gone to the lake and injured Li Ximing…

If there was a ranking of the various cultivators who had offended the Li clan during the struggle between north and south, his name, Gongsun Bei, would surely be emblazoned upon it.

Thus, he did not dodge—Yu Xi's Valley Water spiritual qi had already enveloped the area, and Changyun's golden winds were swirling secretly about. At this distance, it was impossible to break through and return to Zanmen in a single step. Being far from Jiang Toushou and Xiaodisa, he would only die faster.

Watching the Li Zhouwei of the past stroll toward him, becoming King Wei before his very eyes, his killing intent surging, Gongsun Bei no longer even had the Spiritual Treasure bestowed by the Profound Governance Pavilion. He did not fear this divine ability, but instead laughed aloud.

“Li Zhouwei! Have you come to capture and kill me!”

His tone was ice-cold, causing the young man to spin his halberd, killing intent boiling in his heart.

‘I must kill this man quickly!’

This was not just about the enmity between the two of them, but also about the situation on the entire battlefield—Changyun was capable, and Xiaodisa had no will to fight, so they could hold on. The real problem was those few Merciful Ones!

Jiang Toushou held a respected position, and those he kept by his side were from under the lotus seat; compared to Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, they only lacked divine abilities, and there were a full four of them… Although Lin Chensheng and Yin Juexi had many treasures and a noble background respectively, both had only recently broken through. Once those four decided to trade injury for injury, Lin Chensheng might be fine, but Yin Juexi would surely be in trouble!

‘The moment Yin Juexi's divine ability is broken and he loses the world-shaking, chaos-sowing Assistance in Usurpation, those four from the lotus seat, who have followed him for years and have an exceptional rapport, will be able to connect with the Buddhist Land and form an array, causing their strength to skyrocket. The two of them will be in mortal danger in an instant!’

Li Zhouwei's Dao-Profundity was extremely high, and his judgment of the battlefield's trajectory was accurate. Although two of his own from Xiangxiang were also heading this way, under his Spirit Probe investigation, there was a third-life Maha hiding atop the distant Zanmen!

This nun seemed not to have received Jiang Toushou's order yet; though she rode upon rolling multicolored clouds, she was slightly hesitant, clearly being held back to change the situation at a critical moment. Once this person entered the fray, the scales would surely tip.

‘I didn't expect he could even call out a six-life Maha from the Way of Great Desire…’

The battlefield changed in an instant. Li Zhouwei was never one to complain. At this moment, his killing intent was at its peak, the Sovereign's Perilous Tread was pushed to its extreme, and the glittering golden qilin pattern on his face pulsed as his long halberd shot across the sky like a dragon!

The sunset vanished in a flash; the person before him was on the horizon one moment, and in front of him the next.

Bright Yang cultivators admired the strong, and facing a Li Zhouwei of equal cultivation going all out, the first thing Gongsun Bei felt was a thick sense of powerlessness. The only thing he could rely on was his own Dawn Qi divine ability.

His face shone with radiance, and facing the illuminating heavenly light, he finally activated the divine ability he had hidden for many years.

Discourse of the Eight Evasions.

Since he had cultivated this Dawn Qi divine ability, he had used it only a handful of times, not even employing it in several major battles, thinking it could be useful at a critical moment—but now there was no time.

If he didn't use it now, there would be no other chance to use it!

The divine ability finally manifested, making his face shine with a noble light. Facing the pouncing golden edge, he merely closed his eyes.

The Grand Ascension passed through his body like a golden dragon, as if crashing through a wisp of cloud and smoke, flying past his body without causing the slightest harm. Gongsun Bei let out a grunt, then suddenly raised his hand and plucked a point of light from the air.

Unending Dawnfire!

This light shone down like molten iron being poured onto Li Zhouwei, scalding the heavenly light and causing it to cascade in all directions. Li Zhouwei turned his face to avoid looking directly, and calmly began to form a hand seal.

Southern Emperor's Profound Snare.

A sheet of Li Fire fell like a golden lock, causing Gongsun Bei's half-step to freeze. Li Zhouwei had already reversed his halberd, and a dark hole appeared between his brows.

Emperor Qi's Light!

Tens of millions of black-gold streams of light gushed out. The light of the setting sun in the sky suddenly fell, converging all the streams into a single torrent that poured down upon the Daoist Master.

"Pfft!"

His face turned a pale shade of green and white, and he finally spat out a mouthful of blood, falling like a star!

The King of Wei's eyes flickered.

‘The Discourse of the Eight Evasions… cannot defend against the light of the Bright Yang in opposition…’

Gongsun Bei, however, showing a hint of wanting to escape while he could, still forcibly maintained the Unending Dawnfire, dissolving the divine ability and relying on the suppression of his Dawn Qi over Bright Yang to resist the injury!

These three attacks came with almost no interval. Gongsun Bei's face was slightly pale, and only now did he manage to catch his breath, but what unfolded above his head was a vast landscape of heavenly light and water.

The Huai River Map!

Gongsun Bei was inferior to Li Zhouwei in more than just divine abilities and Dao-Profundity, but also in treasures!

He had no choice but to cross his hands before his chest, his eyes bright, as he activated his third divine ability.

Plea to Supplant the Night.

‘The Shadowy Concealment Escape Art!’

Li Zhouwei had been cultivating year after year, so how could he, Gongsun Bei, sit idly by? He had long ago sought a profound art of Dawn Qi, to be used on this very day!

‘I shall replace the deep and distant, be one with shadow and night, I now beg for darkness, to ensnare the other.’

His brow was shrouded in darkness, and he was cloaked in a dusty wind that blocked out the sun, reversing heat and cold. He gathered all the enveloping heavenly light, along with the Li Fire draped over his body, transforming it all into an azure-blue color, which was then utilized by his spell art to help him take a step away, straight toward the heavens!

He had been waiting for this very moment, turning hindrance into aid, making a straight dash for Zanmen!

‘The brilliance of the heavenly light becomes the wondrous method for my escape!’

He erupted forth from a desperate situation, yet there was not the slightest hint of a smile on his face.

‘Li Zhouwei's silent appearance in Xiangxiang must have a reason; there may be enemies hidden beneath Zanmen, blocking my path back to the pass!’

The young man in the sky, however, was calm and unhurried, a faint smile on his lips, his gaze serene. Gongsun Bei only saw an endless darkness submerge the sky, vaguely chasing along his escape light, dragging him into heaven and earth at a speed even faster than before.

Then came the young man's cold, calm voice.

“Be one with shadow and night, to ensnare the other… to be able to control fire and the sun, that is indeed some skill. If this were the first time I saw your divine ability, you might have gotten away. But unfortunately… Gongsun Bei, you already used Plea to Supplant the Night once before…”

“The Crimson Severing Arrowhead is not found in fire and sun, but in shadow and night.”
