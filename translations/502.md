# Chapter 753: The Immortal Bow Of Bianyan

Li Qinghong rode thunder as she descended into the cave dwelling, forming hand seals to cast a spell that concealed the blood on her back. She still had sixty percent of her mana. She quickly swallowed a few pills to suppress her wounds.

The Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow inside her was still silently circulating, keeping her injuries in check. The demonic energy that had invaded her wounds would normally force ordinary cultivators into emergency seclusion, but her thunder mana dispersed it within five minutes.

After she downed two more pills, a hint of color returned to Li Qinghong’s face.

Helian Changguang was likely a core disciple of a devil cultivator sect. His devil techniques and spell arts were more refined than his partner’s, and he wielded one dharma artifact after another. However, her cultivation was above theirs, and as a lightning cultivator, she could suppress them both.

She had gauged the pair's strength at a glance and had taken an interest in several of their dharma artifacts. But devil cultivators’ escape arts were notoriously tricky. Though she could easily overpower the two, Helian Changguang would flee at the slightest sign of trouble, making it hard to wipe them both out at once.

But Li Qinghong was clever and cunning. When the fight started, she never used her full strength and held back just enough to lull the couple into lowering their guard. Then she suddenly exploded in a single instant, obliterating Liu Qiao in one strike, and then turning her attention to Helian Changguang. She had almost managed to kill the devil sect descendant as well.

But Helian Changguang does have some skill, he still managed to injure me...

She frowned lightly and pressed her forehead. The mana inside her still surged restlessly. Purple light flickered faintly on her cheeks and shoulders, emitting a soft crackling sound.

In the past, Li Yuanjiao had always watched over her, so Li Qinghong was rarely injured. This was perhaps the worst she'd been hurt in decades. The Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow’s circulation boosted her combat power by twenty percent.

So, she had gone all out in the final clash with Helian Changguang. She used the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow’s boost to attack with overwhelming force, stunning Helian Changguang in just a few moves. If he had not followed his instincts to flee immediately, he would’ve died there and then...

As she pondered this, Li Minggong quickly approached and bowed, saying respectfully, “Congratulations...”

Li Qinghong merely waved her off and said softly, “Just listen.”

She took out a purple jade pendant from her robes and handed it to Li Minggong, “Though we’ve repelled the devil cultivators here, I need to check how things stand elsewhere. This jade pendant holds power for three days. If any devil cultivators attack, crush it, and I’ll come immediately.”

Li Qinghong still felt uneasy and reminded her, “Only tell the subordinates that I’m recovering in seclusion, don’t let this matter spread. I'm afraid it may shake morale or lead to an information leak.”

“Minggong understands.” Li Minggong nodded in agreement, then hesitantly said, “But aunt, your wounds haven’t been treated yet, and you’re rushing off to reinforce another location...”

“It’s nothing serious.” Li Qinghong had already suppressed her injuries with pills. There was only a tightness in her chest now. She smiled and said, “I’m at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. One of them was just mid-stage, and the other early stage, what could they possibly do to me?

“Li Wushao’s strength is lacking. I don’t know if he can hold the line. I must see for myself, if we lose that ground, it may cost him his life, as well as Li Wen and An Siming.”

Li Minggong was at a loss for words, and could only respond respectfully, “My cultivation is shallow. I cannot see the full picture. I only hope aunt will prioritize your own safety.”

“Don’t worry.” She instructed Li Minggong to stay vigilant, then rode lightning out of the formation.

Countless lights burst forth in the far northern sky. Blinding golden brilliance and red flames surged violently.

The black clouds in the sky were torn apart for six full seconds before slowly converging again. Li Qinghong looked closely in the direction of Mount Bianyan and saw that water and fire fell together, while gold and wood energies surged. It was likely that several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had fallen simultaneously.

Closer to Mount Bianyan, iIn the western forest, she faintly saw a haze of blood mist. There were crimson droplets of rain drifting down.

“Mount Bianyan has also been attacked... Family uncle and Xizhi might be there...”

Her heart was full of worry. She scanned the scene and, seeing no sign of golden rain in the omen, comforted herself with a few words. Then she flew east for another fifteen minutes. Explosions thundered from a checkpoint where a giant serpent darted through the sky. There, five figures were locked in battle.

Two of them were Azure Pond Sect cultivators, each locked in combat with a devil cultivator. Li Wushao had already assumed his original form, a deep black giant serpent. Twin hooks on his tail howled through the air, as he struggled to resist the golden light unleashed by the buddhist cultivator before him.

There’s even a buddhist cultivator!

Li Qinghong had arrived a bit late; the battle was already at its most intense. Her side was being pushed back and was on the verge of full retreat. Li Wushao’s body was covered in golden seals, and he let out repeated cries of pain.

She brushed her black hair behind her ears and advanced with her spear, unhesitatingly choosing to aid her fellow cultivators. But after flying just a few kilometers forward, she suddenly frowned.

Kongheng is here too...

A new thought sprang up in Li Qinghong’s mind. She concealed her presence and vanished from sight.

Li Wushao was utterly miserable, since he was being thoroughly beaten down by the buddhist cultivator. His body was covered in golden palm prints. Black smoke hissed from them as they burned into his scales. He had to counter with twice as much mana for every bit of mana the opponent used.

The kindly-looking old man was a master monk of the Great Desire Sect. He arrived with gentle words, calling himself Master Monk Yu Xin. He had even complimented Li Wushao’s physique at first sight.

Li Wushao hadn’t believed a word of it. To him, all master monks, except for Kongheng, were lunatics. He’d usually avoid fighting them at all costs, but now, he had no choice but to confront the monk head-on.

Yu Xin fought barehanded, smiling all the while, but his strikes were merciless. A single golden palm had nearly taken half of Li Wushao’s life. Hatred now burned in the snake’s venomous eyes.

If I hadn’t undergone the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique twice... and if Xijun hadn’t used that powerful spirit item to temper my body... I’d have already died at this old bastard’s hands...

But before Li Wushao could feel any relief, the kindly old monk looked at him and began chanting with a low, buzzing tone.

“You!” Li Wushao suddenly felt as though his heart had been shattered by a falling stone. His thoughts stuttered and illusions rose before his eyes. He quickly flicked out his tongue and muttered to himself, “Kongheng told me back then that these guys use Respected Cultivator's Subduing Words. They really do love messing with a demon’s mind. I owe him a thanks when I get back!”

He flicked his tongue again and recited a string of incantations, slowly steadying his mind.

Yu Xin’s eternally benevolent expression finally shifted, and he exclaimed in alarm, “The Dao of the Northern Revered One?! Little serpent, who taught you this?!”

Li Wushao was filled with delight when he saw the old monk lose his composure. He hissed, “Your dad taught your grandpa!”

Yu Xin’s face shifted slightly as he said softly, “Insolent beast... such a foul mouth! Let me subdue you...”

Yu Xin seemed to have lost his temper. Golden light surged from his body, and he thrust his palm forward, forming a golden seal that slammed down on Li Wushao. A terrified Wushao’s scales bristled; only now did he realize that the monk hadn’t even been using his full strength.

“Damn it...”

Li Wushao wanted to curse him even more, but he hastily dodged backward. His body shrank rapidly, slithering downward, but the golden seal shrank as well, trailing closely like a shadow.

Clang...

A crisp sound rang out in midair. Li Wushao began cursing again but felt no pain. He quickly turned around and saw a narrow-eyed monk holding a bronze staff, calmly blocking the attack.

Kongheng!

Li Wushao froze for a moment, then realized Kongheng must have defeated the devil cultivators at his post and rushed over to assist.

He immediately shouted, “Yu Xin! Your dad’s here!”

Kongheng glanced at him with a faint smile and offered a courteous greeting.

Yu Xin’s expression grew solemn as he said reverently, “So it’s a fellow of the ancient path... Yu Xin greets the elder.”

“I dare not claim such a title. I am Kongheng. Greetings to a cultivator of the Great Desire Sect,” replied Kongheng.

Yu Xin, a Master Monk of the Great Desire Sect, gazed intently at him as he said, “A meeting is fated. I only hope to engage the elder in a thorough scripture debate and perfect my Dharma.”

Kongheng responded warmly, “This little monk is no good at debating scripture. Better to leave it be.”

Kongheng had encountered monks of the Great Desire Sect before. They were cultivators who pursued desire as selfhood, mastering the will of their heart. He knew he couldn’t out-argue this old monk, so without another word, he raised his staff and brought it crashing down.

The two clashed in midair, sending golden light flashing all around. Li Wushao, understanding the situation, went to help the two Azure Pond Sect cultivators instead.

Devil cultivators were selfish and cunning by nature. When they saw the tide turn, the two put on a brief show of resistance, then immediately turned to black smoke and fled. Their survival abilities far outstripped those of immortal cultivators. Despite being surrounded, both managed to escape without leaving so much as a single dharma artifact behind.

When Li Wushao turned back, he saw Kongheng and Yu Xin casting spell arts and reciting sacred verses. Golden flowers filled the sky, fluttering down with waves of fragrant scent.

His serpent eyes narrowed. In the yellow dust below, wolves sat silently amid swirling smoke, ignoring the rotting flesh nearby, ears tilted to listen.

The two men and demon beast exchanged a glance and rode the wind to encircle the old monk.

But Yu Xin wasn’t a fool, he had already anticipated it and called out his farewell, “A fortunate meeting today. If time permits, I shall seek the elder again...”

His hollow voice echoed in the desert air. A spell art he had long prepared activated, transforming his body into golden petals that fluttered away and reformed several kilometers away. He was making his escape.

After a full hour of battle, nearly everyone on Li Wushao’s side was injured, and they hadn’t even managed to seize a single Foundation Establishment Realm storage pouch. How could they just let him go? All of them took to the wind in pursuit.

Yu Xin, however, shifted forms repeatedly, flying faster and faster, secretly nodding in satisfaction, “Good old Kongheng. If I could speak with him at length, my cultivation would surely advance. As for this pack of fools... if they keep chasing me, they’ll just be throwing away their lives!”

He arched his long white brows, savoring his success, but his satisfied expression slowly faded. His spiritual sense suddenly stirred, and he gritted his teeth, shouting, “Which fellow cultivator?!”

A figure clad in white, crackling with purple lightning, appeared in front of him, blocking his path with a long spear. The female cultivator said coldly, “Master Monk, where do you think you’re going?”

Yu Xin glanced at her eyes and brows, his heart stirring slightly. He took another look and murmured, “A thunder cultivator...”

Li Qinghong made no attempt at courtesy. Though she asked a question, her lightning spear had already pierced forward.

Yu Xin raised his palm to catch it, utterly dismissive. “The Great Desire Sect is not like the devil sects. I’ve no real fear of your lightning...”

But then thunder boomed. Bright-white sparks burst from Yu Xin’s palm. He cried out in pain and instantly snatched his hand back. When he examined it, he found that his palm had been scorched black.

He immediately grew serious, golden light flaring once more as his expression darkened. Behind him, the Azure Pond cultivators and Kongheng were already closing in.

“Damn it.”

————

Starlight glittered over Moongaze Lake as Li Zhouwei landed atop Qingdu Peak.

The household had emptied out, and Qingdu Peak felt even more deserted. He walked forward a few steps, only finding the elder, Li Xuanxuan, seated within the main hall.

The Li Family had deployed a great many people. Li Xuanxuan had come out of seclusion to find the house mostly empty. He had rushed out to seek Li Xijun, only to find that the young man had already gone out to patrol the lake.

At the moment, he was holding a registry list, frowning as his aged finger traced name after name, counting which branch each belonged to and who their ancestors were.

When Li Zhouwei entered the hall, the old man’s tense wrinkles finally eased upon seeing the treasured heir. His spiritual sense swept over him and said, “Fourth stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm already... Good...”

He pointed to the registry and said, “This... your father decided this? Why wasn’t I informed of such a major matter? Why was Yuexiang sent out?!”

“It was Qingdu's direct order.” Li Zhouwei’s broad shoulders sank heavily into the seat as he responded.

Li Xuanxuan simply muttered, “That child, Xijun...”

Li Zhouwei understood; it would only burden Li Xuanxuan with worry to get involved. But the elder continued, “You lot... none of you have pity for your own kin...”

Li Zhouwei quietly listened to the old man’s complaints. Then suddenly, Li Xuanxuan remembered something and said, “Since the Eastern Sea is in such chaos, why not call your uncle Chenghui back?”

Li Zhouwei nodded but did not reply. After holding his breath for a moment, Li Xuanxuan exhaled and asked, “And what’s with that Ning Family fellow pulling so many of our people? I heard the Azure Pond Sect only asked for fifty percent, but he’s taking whatever he pleases... If I were there, I’d show him some real attitude!”

Li Zhouwei cupped his hands and answered simply, “Azure Pond Sect can’t be fully trusted. I’ve only heard that Uncle Xijun received the Radiant Snow Pine Ridge. His cultivation is rising steadily. Ever since then, he doesn’t get angry. As long as the interests are clear, it’s fine.”

Li Xuanxuan paused for a moment, sipped his tea, and sighed repeatedly. Suddenly, a broad-faced middle-aged man at the eighth stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm hurried forward from below, carrying a long spear on his back.

This was An Siwei, son of An Zheyan. His younger brother An Siming had gone north, while he had stayed at Li Xijun’s side. He knelt and saluted hastily.

His usually calm face was filled with excitement as he said, “My lord! There’s news from Xu State!”

Li Xuanxuan quickly stood, his old face full of anxiety. He even forgot to put his teacup down and hurriedly asked, “Speak! Wait—where’s Xijun?!”

An Siwei said, “He captured several southbound devil cultivators. He’s interrogating them on the lake and sent me ahead to report!

“Both devil and buddhist sects are moving south, Dao of Great Desire, Dao of Compassion, Dao of Emptiness... The Tuoba and Murong families, major demon tribes, even the Helian family of Tiefu and the other branch of the Li Family... All the minor families have joined in. Demonic energy surged, and golden light filled the skies...”

An Siwei spoke in a deep voice, “The Murong family and Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of the Great Desire Sect were ambushed midway by the Golden Feather Sect. Azure Pond’s Li Xuanfeng led his forces out of seclusion, intercepted the reinforcements, and routed the northern cultivators...

“My lord drew his bow and, in just fifteen minutes, killed Murong Wu of the Murong Family, wearer of the Black Xuan Armor and Elder Yu Qian of the Buddhist sect... Murong Wu was obliterated, body and soul, and Yu Qian forced into reincarnation...

“After slaying the two, my lord coughed up golden blood and the immortal bowstring snapped. A Great Desire spirit beast lunged in that moment, but my lord sneered, caught it barehanded, and tore it in half... Blood rained across the skies, terrifying twenty-one high-ranking devil and buddhist cultivators into complete silence...

“They say the silence lasted a full six seconds. Not a soul dared speak until the last drop of blood fell...”

An Siwei finished in one breath, his voice trembling with both awe and joy, “Now... now the entirety of Xu State knows of the immortal bow at Mount Bianyan!”
