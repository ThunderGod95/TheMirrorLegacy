# Chapter 944, Auspicious Success

‘The heart of this Mystic Hoard Gold-Winged Bat isn't just heavy as a mountain; it's harder than most spiritual minerals and iron…’

The half-finished pill had only just settled down, but the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron had no intention of letting it rest. The runes covering its body lit up in unison, casting a soft black light upon the pill.

Bathed in this black radiance, the already-quiet pill became utterly still. Where moments before there had been a faint tremor, it now ceased to move entirely. The stubborn medicinal liquids that had resisted refinement were suddenly swallowed by the pill and assimilated, one by one.

Li Ximing understood.

‘The Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron must have a corresponding divine effect, but alas, I am not its master. I'm only borrowing it. It only reveals a fraction of its power when stimulated.’

Li Ximing intensified the True Fire by another degree, scorching the iron-like pill for another full month. At last, all the shimmering golden medicinal liquid was refined into it. The entire process, from start to finish, had taken nearly half a year.

One had to remember, the flame beneath the cauldron was the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire, a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual flame. Furthermore, Li Ximing had been pouring his divine ability and dharma power into it, enhancing its might even further. By all rights, any metal or stone in that cauldron should have been reduced to liquid by now. Yet all this effort was just barely enough to fuse the medicinal liquid into the pill. The sheer expenditure of divine ability and dharma power was the greatest Li Ximing had ever experienced in his history of alchemy.

He nurtured the pill for a quarter-hour. Then, wisps of golden cloud billowed from the cauldron's opening, transforming in mid-air into tiny golden bats. Each was no bigger than a thumb. They fluttered about, seeking places to cling—some hung upside down from the ceiling beams, others from the pillars, and some even crowded the cauldron's small opening, jostling for a place to hang.

Qingyan, standing to the side, had long since returned to his original form. His pupils reflected the tiny, flitting golden bats.

"That is Auspicious Qi," he said. "It signifies 'Continuous Advancement'—a steady, accumulating fortune, not a sudden leap that invites calamity. It likes to cling and hang upside down, gathering near seats of power and Spiritual Treasures... It is a joyous sign. The pill is a success!"

His expression grew distant, and he continued in a low voice,

"Relying on fate to accomplish things is, in itself, an art of hanging upside down and climbing. A pill of Auspicious Qi, though lacking intelligence, is influenced by this principle. It will try to cling, which means it should attach itself to the lid rather than emerging from the opening. It seeks to deceive the Alchemist, to prolong its own existence..."

Li Ximing nodded with a smile and let out a light breath. The restorative power of a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability was truly formidable; in that single breath, his slightly pale complexion turned ruddy once more. He struck the cauldron wall with his palm, causing the lid to fly open.

He used his divine ability to seize the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron's round lid. He glanced inside the cauldron—it was pitch black and completely empty. He then inverted the lid. Sure enough, a plump, round, golden bat the size of a fingernail was hanging upside down from it. Its wings were wrapped tightly around itself, forming a perfect sphere.

Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill!

"What an auspicious pill!"

Li Ximing exclaimed in admiration. The golden bat opened its eyes. They were bright white and perfectly round, completely devoid of pupils, and they swept their gaze around the room.

Fearing any unexpected complications, Li Ximing wasted no time. He produced a jade bottle, collected the Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill, and sealed the stopper tightly. Still feeling uneasy, he formed a hand seal and placed a seal of Bright Yang spell arts upon it.

"Many thanks for your help, Daoist Friend Qingyan!"

Li Ximing beamed, but the Demon King before him merely shook his head.

"Mine was nothing, merely a blessing. It is your pill art and fire control techniques that are truly astonishing. I have never seen their like in all my life!"

Li Ximing offered a few humble words in return. He swept his spiritual sense inward and discovered that a significant amount of Eastern Life Flowing Water still lingered within his Juque Palace, circling the spiritual aperture and emitting a brilliant glow.

The Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill was exceptionally difficult to refine. An ordinary cultivator might struggle with it for three to five years. But Li Ximing possessed True Fire and an extremely high level of fire control. With the Demon King's blessing, he had immediately compressed the timeline to under two years. He hadn't expected the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron to be so effective on top of that, reducing the projected timeline of over a year to less than one.

It seemed Qingyan had prepared the blessing assuming a three-to-five-year refinement. Thus, even though the pill was finished, a large amount of the Eastern Life Flowing Water remained in his Juque Palace.

Li Ximing asked about it with some hesitation. The Demon King realized what had happened.

"Ah, the Eastern Life Flowing Water was not fully consumed!"

"Rest assured, Daoist Friend... this substance has no other effects. A simple pulse of your divine ability will disperse it... However, it is, after all, blessed water. If you plan to refine any other pills in the near future, this water can still provide some benefit, even without my presence."

Li Ximing was delighted.

"Is that true?! How long can it last?"

Qingyan replied with a serious expression,

"It cannot last long. If left undisturbed, it might persist for two months or more. But the moment you refine another pill or use any spell arts within your Juque Palace, it will not last more than a few days. Is your True Fire stored in your Juque Palace? You should move it elsewhere to avoid consuming mental energy to control it."

"Excellent!"

Li Ximing was still visibly pleased. He possessed Talisman Qi, so he wasn't concerned about mental energy expenditure. He smiled.

"Your divine ability is magnificent, Daoist Friend! I am truly impressed."

Having successfully refined this pill, Li Ximing had immediately tasted the benefits. 'If this pill could be aided by Qingyan's blessing, other pills surely can as well. If I need to refine a truly great pill in the future, this Demon King might prove invaluable!'

Thus, he was keen on building a good relationship. He chatted with him for a moment before asking,

"May I ask where your sect is located, Daoist Friend? If I encounter more trouble on the path of alchemy in the future, I may need to ask for your assistance again!"

Qingyan smiled and replied,

"Around the West Sea, among the foreign states. If you come personally, Daoist Friend, just look for the Great Tazi. However, the distance is great. If you wish to send an envoy, just have them find Fuxun and inform him."

"Wonderful!"

Li Ximing agreed cheerfully. The two of them exited the main hall together. Outside, auspicious clouds had gathered in the sky, a tapestry of interconnected golden drifts. In the mountains below, the cold had vanished, the snow had melted, and a hundred flowers were in full bloom. The world teemed with vibrant life.

"A single great pill can truly cause such a phenomenon!"

He had barely stepped out of the hall when Houfu rushed over from the sky. He cupped his hands toward them both, congratulating them.

"Congratulations to you both!"

Li Ximing had just started to reply when the black-robed man hurried before them. Before Houfu could even speak, a ray of purple light shot through the air and materialized as a woman with slender eyebrows.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

"Daoist Friend Tinglan..."

Li Ximing recognized her at once. The purple-robed woman looked extremely anxious.

"Zhu Gong's injuries are worsening... I don't know how much longer she can last... I tracked you here, but I saw you were in the critical stage of refining a vital pill and dared not disturb you... I've been waiting for some time. Please, come with me!"

Houfu nodded repeatedly. The man had been eager to build a connection with Qingyan and immediately saw his opening.

"Zhaojing, you go ahead. I will host Daoist Friend Qingyan... We have much to discuss."

Li Ximing's heart skipped. He glanced back at Qingyan. The Demon King nodded slightly and exhaled, bidding them farewell. Li Ximing stepped into the Great Void and turned to Tinglan, who was beside him.

"How bad are her injuries?"

Ever since the great war between the North and South, Tinglan seldom wore her favored autumn-yellow robes, opting instead for the purple robes of the Purple Smoke Gate. They made her seem much plainer. Her brow was tightly furrowed.

"I shouldn't have involved you in this," she said. "We first sought Daoist Master Shanbai from the north. He has already examined her and given a diagnosis. I have come looking for you several times over the past half-month. Finally, I've caught you..."

"Her dharma body sustained the heaviest damage. The initial wounds never healed, and then she was besieged by several Merciful Ones. Thankfully, we had my Spiritual Treasure to help at Xiaoshi Mountain, so it wasn't a total disaster... After Xiaoshi Mountain fell, I received her distress signal. We pretended to retreat south... but actually went north to rendezvous with Kui Qi..."

"That's when it all went wrong... The situation was chaotic. I was distracted, and she ran into the northern demon cultivator, Zhu Kui. That man is venomous. He saw her dharma body was injured and still used insidious methods against her."

Tinglan paused, then added in a low voice,

"After all, Wenqing is watching over the river..."

Li Ximing frowned. The situation at the time had indeed been chaotic. It wasn't wrong for Tinglan and the others to think of returning to the Tangdao Mountain Range first. His own Heir's breakthrough had prevented that from becoming a major disaster, but he had never felt it was his place to bring it up. Whether Kan Ziyu was actually present, or whether she would have intervened, was another matter entirely.

In two steps, they had arrived at Shanji Prefecture. As they entered the sect gates, Tinglan continued,

"When she returned, her injuries were still manageable. I gave her pills and told her to recuperate. But looking at it now, in that chaos, she must have been secretly struck by Wei Xuanyin's Spiritual Treasure as well. Veiled Yin is inherently difficult to detect, and we didn't realize she'd been hit by his divine ability."

Li Ximing felt a chill run down his spine.

'There were so many Daoist Masters present at the time. Why not target someone from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition? Only killing a direct descendant of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition would count as an effective blow. Why go to the trouble of attacking Zhu Gong, a relative nobody? I fear he was sending a warning... making an example of her!'

Judging by their expressions, the injury was clearly severe. Li Ximing followed Tinglan into a cave residence. As expected, he heard the faint, scurrying sound of rats, much like what had happened with Kui Qi. His expression turned serious.

"The taboo that Senior Kui Qi had... am I permitted to see her?"

"It's fine," Tinglan replied. "Senior Shanbai has it under control. We were just discussing a solution."

They entered together, pushing open a stone door. They saw a white-haired old man off to the side, channeling his divine ability to grind herbs. He held a small, cyan jade mortar that pulsed with a faint glow. He was a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

'That must be Daoist Master Shanbai. A rare cultivator of the Horn Wood Dao!'

Li Ximing greeted him. The old man responded with a cheerful chuckle, and Tinglan, her face etched with worry, led Li Ximing further inside.

In the main hall, a jade bed rested on a high platform. Below it, red stones of all sizes were piled up like a small mountain, casting the room in a crimson hue. The cracks between the stones were stuffed with dense red flower petals, creating a sea of flowers that flowed from the bedside all the way down the steps, almost burying the bed itself.

A young woman who looked sixteen or seventeen sat leaning on the jade bed. Her eyes were slightly downcast, her skin tender and white. She was draped only in a thin red gauze, tied tightly at the collar and cascading down over the red flowers. A pair of jade-white legs emerged from the gauze, her delicate feet resting on the petals.

Her cheeks were flushed pink from her injuries, but her eyes were jet black. When she saw them enter, she managed a strained smile.

"Greetings, Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing recognized Zhu Gong. Compared to her former high spirits and boundless arrogance, the woman before him now seemed utterly frail. In the dimly lit cave, her eyes even held a trace of panic.

"Daoist Friend Zhu Gong..."

Li Ximing cupped his hands. Although the young woman's cheeks were flushed crimson and she didn't exude an aura of death, he could still keenly sense the erratic divine ability fluctuations coming from her body.

Tinglan sighed.

"Zhaojing, please take a look?"

Li Ximing murmured an apology and took Zhu Gong's wrist, which was as hot as burning charcoal. He sent a trace of his divine ability into her and felt his blood run cold.

A damp, cold divine ability permeated her body, surging and ebbing, hiding within her meridians and flesh. It resonated faintly with the Great Void and was constantly traversing her many Profound Acupoints. Whenever his divine ability tried to suppress it, it would immediately vanish, only to reappear elsewhere.

'Such a venomous Veiled Yin divine ability…'

Li Ximing's brow furrowed. He had dealt with such lingering injuries before.

"I, too, suffered greatly from Changxiao's Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art," he said in a low voice. "These types of injuries are the most insidious. They either take ten or twenty years to resolve, or they utterly destroy your dharma body."

A flash of hatred crossed the young woman's eyes, but it quickly faded. "What can be done? That Wei Xuanyin is the Grand Preceptor of Zhao State, a Great Daoist Master. He used his Spiritual Treasure to strike me secretly while I was injured and vulnerable. Of course I was fooled... From the looks of it, he clearly wants to destroy my dharma body so I'm forced to flee overseas to heal."

Tinglan remained silent at her words. Li Ximing shook his head awkwardly. Zhu Gong studied him, her eyes flickered.

'I only heard about his affair with Changxi and thought him rigid and easy to plot against. I never imagined that after just a few years, he would be the one to gain the most. He is, after all, a character who achieved the Dao on the mainland. I cannot underestimate him.'

After probing for a moment, Li Ximing became thoughtful.

"I once refined a pill using Valley Water for internal injuries. I'm not sure how effective it will be here. Allow me to consult with the old senior. He can make the diagnosis, and I will find a way to refine the pill."

He appeared completely earnest and dedicated, which brought a flicker of gratitude to Zhu Gong's eyes. She thanked him, and he excused himself.

Tinglan let out a breath of relief and sat down beside her.

"Having him here makes things much easier. A targeted pill makes all the difference, especially one refined by a Bright Yang cultivator... If it truly cannot be cured, Hengxing has better methods. At worst, I will go and beg her!"

Zhu Gong's expression turned troubled.

"She has always looked down on me... That's the way it is overseas. I grew up there. It's kill or be killed. I hate that man-eat-man world. After my master fell, I only broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm with the help of my patron, and I managed to pacify a sea. But suddenly, I'm the one at fault."

Tinglan shook her head, remaining silent on that topic.

"Just focus on healing... Overseas... something has happened again."

Zhu Gong's expression immediately turned serious.

"Overseas? The Xinyu Archipelago?"

Tinglan nodded and sighed.

"Ever since someone intentionally created that phenomenon nearby, I've brought back our key disciples. I've also personally inspected the earth veins. It's no small matter. That thing beneath is growing restless. If this continues, others will inevitably find out."

Zhu Gong's expression shifted rapidly. Finally, she let out a heavy breath, as if in resignation.

"If we truly can't control it, let it go... Something from the Sheji Dao is not for the likes of us to protect. My master warned me when she was alive... if all else fails, we must abandon it."

Tinglan's face darkened.

"How can we let it go? The consequences would be endless! First, you must heal. Once this is over, we will discuss it... Now that Wenqing has broken through, as long as we can extract ourselves from this northern quagmire, we can surely spare one person to go and suppress it."

A complex look flashed in Zhu Gong's eyes. She mumbled something under her breath, but ultimately left it unsaid,

'How can there possibly be time? They have been scheming for so long, meticulously... Their plot against you wasn't hatched in a day! Those caught in the middle truly cannot see clearly...'
