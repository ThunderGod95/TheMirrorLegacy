# Chapter 723: A Fulfilling Return

Amidst the respectful farewells of the Cui clan, Li Ximing departed the island. Cui Jueyin stood bathed in the heavenly light, a touch of melancholy in his eyes, but Li Ximing had no time for him. He was engrossed in reading *The Art of the Body That Breaks a Hundred Formations* over and over, gaining a deeper understanding of the secret art.

'It's like a small fragment torn from the full "Art of Returning Fold,"' he mused. 'As if eight out of every ten words have been removed. It's incomplete, yet it resonates with the *Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass*, making it just barely possible to cultivate.'

'If I were using a different Immortal Foundation… one for Audience with the Celestial Gate, for instance, this would be impossible to learn.'

His mind was already racing with calculations.

'*The Art of the Body That Breaks a Hundred Formations* can't be used with Audience with the Celestial Gate, but my family's complete "Art of Returning Fold" is likely compatible with any Immortal Foundation. Once I have all nine secret arts in hand, I can choose any cultivation method within the Bright Yang Dao, and my family will have nine corresponding arts to master!'

'Even the imperial clans of old could boast no more than this!'

He felt a flash of embarrassment, recalling his earlier complaints about the secret art being too simplistic. He retrieved a jade slip from his robes. To Cui Jueyin, his expression was solemn and profound, as if he were contemplating a pivotal move involving a great divine ability. The younger man didn't dare to speak.

But inside, Li Ximing was muttering to himself, 'What even is this?'

The jade slip contained nearly a hundred thousand words detailing his understanding of the secrets of Yang Origin. Comparing it to the profound art he now held, his lengthy treatise was less like grinding wheat and more like teaching someone how to swallow a pastry without choking.

He winced, cringing at the thought.

'Back then, the family's legacy was incomplete, and my understanding of the Bright Yang Dao was hardly better than a rogue cultivator's. If I left this in the clan archives, I wouldn't dare sign my own name… Future generations would see it and wonder how the great Daoist Master Zhaojing, the first of his rank in the Li family, could have written almost a hundred thousand words of utter nonsense.'

He wanted to toss it away but felt it was a waste. Instead, he found the signature line and casually inscribed the name "Daoist Master Gufeng." Only then did he tuck it back into his sleeve. Seeing his calm and resolute expression, Cui Jueyin sighed internally.

'The thoughts of a Daoist Master are truly impossible to fathom… Our clan's support must have given him even greater confidence.'

With that small matter settled, Li Ximing finally turned his thoughts to the origins of the *Radiant Essence Scripture*.

'Nine secret arts, yet it's only a fifth-grade cultivation manual! The Immortal Mirror's gifts… what is the principle behind them?'

The *Radiant Essence Scripture* had been bestowed upon Li Zhouwei. That White Qilin, a talent the Li family might see only once in a century, was clearly the reason for the nine secret arts. And yet, the scripture itself was only fifth-grade.

'Based on the examples of Jiangqian and Quewan, it seems the cultivation method and the secret arts are granted separately… Minghuang's destiny is unique, so he received the ultimate number of nine secret arts…'

He hazarded a guess, a rough calculation forming in his mind. As he flew onward, the winds over the sea grew stronger, and the waves swelled. A few fish darted across the surface, and when the occasional demonic beast emerged, the heavenly light beneath his feet would graze it, instantly turning it to ash.

Li Ximing was no longer the man he once was. The light between his brows pulsed, connecting him to the Great Void and allowing him to perceive the subtle shifts in the spiritual qi.

'The spiritual qi is growing more volatile toward the southeast…' his calculations revealed.

'The fall of water and the rise of thunder are the affairs of True Monarchs. Meddling will only lead to disaster. Even with a divine ability, one cannot simply go wherever one pleases.'

He triangulated the position, which seemed to be near the World's Navel island. The Eastern Sea was the domain of dragons, and he had no intention of wandering into their territory without a guarantee of his safety. He steered his course back toward the mainland and Moongaze Lake.

'Still,' he thought, 'the spring water on that World's Navel island is said to have some miraculous properties. When my other affairs are settled, it might be worth a visit.'

The Great Void was a turbulent expanse, and this was Cui Jueyin's first time witnessing it as described in the records. He observed his surroundings with great curiosity. Li Ximing, pleased with his new subordinate and the renewed progress on his cultivation path, was in high spirits. Not wanting to waste time, he took out the scroll Changxi had given him, *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire*, and began to read.

The name alone suggested it was no modern creation. The incantatory, insight-driven naming convention was similar to the *Six Chapters on Seeking Immortality* and other texts his elders had recovered from the Green Pine Grotto-Heaven. It likely hailed from at least that same ancient era.

Li Ximing skimmed the contents. It mostly described profound and wondrous methods involving high-platform rituals, various spiritual materials, Li Fire, and Baleful Earth Qi. A number of cultivators were required to assist in refining a spiritual embryo over a great many years.

He looked closer at the description of these assistants: "Their seas of qi show a floating light, yet to reach Shengyang; possessing some minor wonders, but not yet divine abilities."

'So, Foundation Establishment cultivators… The ancients really had a grand way of speaking.'

Li Ximing scoffed inwardly. It seemed the ritual required twelve Foundation Establishment cultivators, working in two alternating teams of six. Furthermore, their Immortal Foundations could not conflict with the spiritual embryo. For example, when refining a Bright Yang artifact, cultivators of the Veiled Yin or Radiant Essence paths were unsuitable, and it was best to also avoid Pit Water from the Water Virtues.

'Thankfully, our family doesn't practice those first two paths.'

He paused, his attention caught by the mention of Pit Water. If there was one potential conflict, this was it. His family possessed quite a few Pit Water cultivation methods, and he had practiced them himself. Logically, there was no inherent conflict between Bright Yang and Pit Water. With his current level of understanding, he made an educated guess.

'Li Fire and Bright Yang are of the same Dao. Li Fire and Pit Water are opposites. That must be the reason.'

Dismissing the thought, his mind turned to selecting a spiritual embryo.

He didn't have many Foundation Establishment-level Dharma Artifacts. The Sun Seeker Ring was inscrutable, and it bore the name of a Green Pine Temple cultivator, so he couldn't use it. Aside from a few lesser items, the only ones worthy of being a spiritual embryo were the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner, and the Profound Pattern Vase.

The Chongming Profound Insight Screen was mysterious; he was almost certain it was fundamentally an artifact of the Supreme Yang Dao. It was one of the few confirmed ancient artifacts in his family's possession, and he had always treasured it, believing it held a profound secret.

The other ancient artifact was the Profound Pattern Vase. While it lacked overwhelming power, its marvelous versatility had long been valued by the Li family. They had never seen another artifact that could change and adapt along with its wielder, as if its wonders were limitless—a testament to the supreme skill of the ancients.

'Since the Profound Pattern Vase was part of the Wei-Li inheritance, it's very likely it can be used as a Bright Yang artifact. It's worth a try. Even if this method fails, the Azure Pond Sect's Purple Mansion cultivators have entered the Dongli Grotto-Heaven. It wouldn't be too difficult to trade for a top-tier Bright Yang artifact from them.'

***

Inside the world of the Immortal Mirror.

The Saintly Palace of the Supreme Yin's Luminous and Primordial Purity.

Within the obsidian hall, the power of the Supreme Yin surged. Golden osmanthus and silver cassia patterns adorned every surface. Moonlight lamps cast a cold glow upon constructs of sculpted snow. Everywhere one looked, there were images of jade rabbits and moon toads. A few snowflakes drifted down from the ceiling. A figure walked through the palace, hands tucked into his sleeves.

The young man had a broad forehead and a thick head of hair and beard that cascended down his cheeks. His face was pale, his eyes a light shade of teal. His sleeves were embroidered with crashing waves. He walked into a courtyard, found a spot, and sat down. When he saw another official from the palace take a seat nearby, he asked:

"Lord Liu, do you have any connections in the lower realm? When will Lord Li be returning?"

The other man, an immortal official in white robes, simply shook his head.

"Time flows differently in the lower realm. We have no sense of the years there. If he has taken up cultivation, it could be a thousand years for all we know. He won't be back so quickly."

"A thousand years? Ugh! This is going to kill me!"

The news struck the young man like a physical blow, and he slumped in his seat, dazed.

This was, of course, Dangjiang. He had been here, transcribing techniques for who knows how long. He studied day and night, his mouth dry from the endless work, while the cabinets continued to spew forth an inexhaustible supply of jade slips.

Dangjiang was not a diligent person by nature, and compiling techniques was grueling labor with no rest. Having finally earned a short break, he had come out to ask for news of the Li Immortal Official, only to be met with this crushing reality.

He sat there for a long time, in no mood to appreciate the snow falling in the courtyard. Suddenly, the immortal official beside him, Lord Liu, shot to his feet and bowed respectfully.

"Greetings, my Lord!"

Dangjiang quickly looked up to see a stern-faced immortal general in silver armor standing at the edge of the courtyard. The general's features were sharp, as if carved from stone. The young man scrambled to his feet and sighed.

"Greetings, Immortal General!"

The man was none other than Zhengao, the Supreme Yin's Luminous Immortal General. Ever since Dangjiang had arrived, Zhengao had dumped him in this forsaken place to toil endlessly. The people here were few and far between, all of them elusive and taciturn. Finding Zhengao himself was next to impossible. Dangjiang was about to burst from frustration.

Finally seeing his superior, he was overcome with emotion. "It has been a long time, my Lord!"

Zhengao replied coolly, "A trip to the lower realm. It was not so long."

In the world within the mirror, everyone but Dangjiang was an illusion. Zhengao was, of course, a puppet controlled by Lu Jiangxian. Even Lord Liu at his side was the same. The reason they were so quiet was simply that Lu Jiangxian couldn't be bothered to respond to the talkative fellow.

During Li Ximing's breakthrough journey, he had visited several powers: the Azure Pond Sect, Mount Xianyou, the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate, the Xuanmiao Temple, the Profound Peak Gate, and the Cui family's Chongzhou Island.

Lu Jiangxian hadn't watched constantly, but the Immortal Mirror's gaze had followed from the Great Void, collecting every technique and secret art it could. However, most sects had their secret arts locked down, making them difficult to decipher. The harvest was thus neither large nor small.

Chongzhou Island, the Sword Gate, and the Azure Pond Sect each had specialized secret locks on their cultivation manuals. For any high-grade method, the decryption keys seemed to be passed down through individual peaks or bloodlines, not recorded in the jade slips. The gains there were minimal.

As for that old fox Xiao Chuting of Mount Xianyou, he had locked every single one of his cultivation methods from beginning to end. From the entire, vast Mount Xianyou, Lu Jiangxian had come away with nothing.

Only the Xuanmiao Temple and the Profound Peak Gate had shallow foundations and lacked a grand heritage. The decryption arts for their techniques were recorded on jade slips. Profound Peak was slightly better; the keys for their Purple Mansion methods were likely in Changxi's storage pouch. But everything else was laid bare. As for the Xuanmiao Temple, which had only been in Jiangbei for a little over a decade, its systems were incomplete. The decryption method for their Purple Mansion technique was right behind the statue of their patriarch, True Monarch Suxiang, allowing Lu Jiangxian to sweep the place clean.

'Most of it is just miscellaneous arts and Foundation Establishment techniques. I got a good number of third and fourth-grade sword arts from the Sword Gate. The Xuanmiao Temple had the fewest techniques overall, but they did have one fifth-grade Purple Mansion method, the *Sutra of the Majestic Jeweled Visage and Treasured Earth*… a rare technique of the Treasured Earth Dao.'

These were all expected gains. But as Li Ximing sped across the Eastern Sea, Lu Jiangxian had unintentionally scanned a grotto-heaven that seemed to belong to some ancient cultivator.

The grotto-heaven's formations were flawless. Even if Li Ximing had been standing right in front of it, he wouldn't have noticed a thing. Lu Jiangxian didn't bother wasting effort to break them; his divine sense simply passed through the arrays for a quick tour. The space inside was quite large, but held nothing of exceptional note. He simply read the formation plates and committed them to memory.

All the other cultivation methods were dumped into the Scripture Pavilion on the mountain, left to gather dust. These techniques bore the distinct signatures of their parent sects. Without being modified by Dangjiang or himself, they couldn't be used freely and could only serve as references.

Now, however, an idea began to form in his mind. He didn't want Dangjiang just altering minor arts day after day. The number of techniques in the pavilion was becoming absurd, and bestowing them upon the Li family one by one was too inefficient. He wanted to find a way to use the connection between the Talisman Seeds to let the Li family members choose for themselves.

'If I do that, I'll need someone in the pavilion to manage things and guide them. In the future, if there's more information I can disclose to the Li family, this would also be more convenient.'

'Take that grotto-heaven, for instance. If I had a point of contact, I could invent an excuse and bestow it upon them, rather than letting it go to waste at the bottom of the sea.'

In any case, it made no difference to Dangjiang where he worked. And if he wasn't in this palace, Lu Jiangxian wouldn't have to constantly manifest illusions to deal with him. Possessing memories from generations of the Li family, Lu Jiangxian had no intention of ever meeting them directly. This was all just proactive planning.

Thus, inhabiting the body of Zhengao, he had sought Dangjiang out. He nodded. "Although I was on a trip to the lower realm, Lord Liu informed me that you have been diligent and hardworking, burning the midnight oil. I have also reviewed the techniques you've modified. Most are useful. Although some were sent back for revision, I can see that you put your heart into it."

"This… Thank you for your understanding, my Lord!"

Dangjiang was overjoyed to hear this and shot a grateful look at Lord Liu.

Zhengao continued, "Since you are so dedicated and capable, I will arrange an official post for you in the heavens. What do you think?"

This was the moment Dangjiang had been working so tirelessly for. He was ecstatic and bowed low.

"My lord's grace… is etched upon my very soul… I…"

Before he could finish, Zhengao waved his hand. "I have already spoken with the Ministry of Merit. I have found a pavilion for you at the edge of the heavens. We are short-staffed, and that pavilion has been abandoned for a long time. It was originally the official post of Immortal Official Li. Now that he has returned from the lower realm, he is certain to receive a fine new position, leaving this one vacant. Since you are so skilled in Daoist arts, I will dispatch you there to manage the cultivation techniques and secret arts. You will hold the post in his stead for now."

'Huh?'

Hearing that it was the same soul-crushing work, Dangjiang nearly cried out. He lamented internally, 'What do you mean, "skilled in Daoist arts"? What else have I been allowed to do? You could have sent me to meet people, to patrol a pavilion, to stand guard in the heavens, or even to slay demons in the lower realm! Anything would have been better… Why is it "skilled in Daoist arts" again?!'

Lu Jiangxian knew he was a chatterbox by nature and not suited for the quiet work of modifying techniques. But where was there a heaven for him to patrol? Where were there demons for him to slay? He asked coolly, "Are you suggesting the post is too humble?"

The question sealed his fate. How could Dangjiang dare to argue? He shook his head repeatedly, spouting words of gratitude. Lu Jiangxian found it amusing and, controlling Zhengao, turned to leave.

"Pack your things. I will take you to the edge of the heavens."

After Zhengao left the courtyard, Lord Liu was no longer a respectfully silent attendant. He came to life at once, clasping his hands in congratulations.

"Congratulations, congratulations!"

Dangjiang was torn between joy and sorrow. He was happy to finally have an official post in the heavens, but he despaired at having to continue this exhausting work, which would likely now come in even greater volumes. Lu Jiangxian, inhabiting Lord Liu, drew on the management-speak of his past life to console him.

"This position is quite good, you know. We are colleagues now! Which of the immortal officials didn't start this way? Just keep your head down and work hard! You'll see the light at the end of the tunnel eventually!"

Dangjiang gritted his teeth and replied, "When I finally make something of myself and get a chance to go to the lower realm, I'm going to have a long, long talk with Daoist Friend Li… This is hundreds of years of work he's dumped on me!"
