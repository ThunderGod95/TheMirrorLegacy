# Chapter 1033: Becoming Immortal

The spring breeze swept across Moongaze Lake, carrying with it the fresh scent of rain. A young man in white robes, a sword hanging from his waist, descended with the wind, a pensive look on his face.

‘Spring has returned,’ he thought. ‘By my calculations, it’s time I went to see my younger uncle.’

Time had flown by. Li Suining was now at the fifth level of Qi Refining, his ability to ride the wind and manipulate light drawing envious stares from those around him.

‘At this time in my past life… I was still in seclusion, struggling just to reach Qi Refining!’

On the surface, Li Suining was a student pursuing the Dao. In reality, he was unlike any other member of the Li Clan’s direct line. He paid no attention to array Daos, esoteric lore, secret methods, or movement techniques. For years, he had focused on only one thing—cultivation.

There was no need for anything else. He had already mastered those subjects in his previous life. As a former Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator and one of the last pillars of the Li Clan, his Dao-Profundity surpassed that of almost everyone on the lake.

His cultivation progress was even more terrifying. With the experience of his past life, he advanced at an astonishing rate. He was now just a step away from the sixth level of Qi Refining, the Illusory Core within him growing brighter with each passing day, eagerly anticipating the formation of his Immortal Foundation.

Having reached the Foundation Establishment Realm with the Li Clan in his past life, he knew well that once he crossed the next two hurdles and reached the seventh level of Qi Refining, the clan's spiritual pills and wondrous medicines could propel him straight to the ninth, right to the threshold of the next realm.

‘I’m only twenty this year. If I take that step, I could very well reach the ninth level of Qi Refining around the age of twenty-two… That’s far too conspicuous!’

The clan's two Daoist Masters were one thing, but King Wei was in a league of his own. A Foundation Establishment cultivator in his early twenties was a rarity seen only once in many years. Daoist Master Zhaojing had reached the realm at thirty-two or thirty-three, which meant he would have been at the ninth level of Qi Refining around twenty-eight or twenty-nine.

And so, Li Suining decided to rein himself in. He would linger at the sixth level for a while, using the time to reconnect with certain figures on the lake, leveraging his memories to forge relationships ahead of time.

Lost in thought, Li Suining suddenly halted mid-flight. He looked into the distance and saw a man in a conical straw hat rowing a small boat through the spring rain.

He took one look, and his expression grew complicated.

‘So… So Fifth Grand-Uncle is here.’

Since his rebirth, Li Suining had actually seen Li Zhouming once before, during the entrance ceremony for the island. Li Zhouming had made a brief appearance, but his restless nature got the better of him, and he left after hearing only the opening words.

Li Suining had been preoccupied with finding a cultivation manual. Later, he met with Li Jiangchun, but by then, Li Xuanxuan had sent Li Zhouming into seclusion as punishment for watching plays all night, so they missed the chance to meet properly.

After returning to the mountains, he found that the Daoist Master was consuming a spiritual treasure. He should have been diligently cultivating on Gardenia Scenery Mountain, but he waited and waited for Li Ximing, only to run into King Wei several times instead. The delay had lasted until today.

He never would have guessed that Li Zhouwei had also sent Li Ximing into seclusion. He simply assumed that the movements of Daoist Masters were unpredictable. In any case, with the dense spiritual energy on Gardenia Scenery Mountain, his cultivation hadn't been hindered in the slightest.

Anxiety fluttered in his chest as he flew closer through the rain. He saw the so-called Fifth Young Master wielding a crudely whittled stick, apparently trying to spear fish. The man noticed him, raised an eyebrow, and grinned.

"What a handsome young man!"

‘…This…’

‘Is this really Fifth Grand-Uncle?’

Li Suining knew his grand-uncle had a history of scandalous behavior in his youth, so much so that he had once spoken ill of his own ancestor, Li Xixuan. But in his previous life, Suining had very little interaction with him on the lake. Seeing this dignified Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator spearfishing was utterly bizarre.

"This junior is Suining…" he said.

"Heh."

The man lifted his wooden stick, seeming to study Suining's expression. He plucked a fish from its tip and laughed. "As if I wouldn't know! Come on in, have a seat!"

Li Suining looked at his noble air and playful smile. How could this be the same man as the pale, immortal-foundation-damaged Family Head from his past life? Still, accustomed to obeying his orders, he instinctively landed on the boat.

Li Zhouming swept aside the curtain, and a wave of warm air rushed out. Inside, a copper stove burned with red-hot coals. A young woman sat within, holding a pipa, her head bowed in waiting.

"This…"

Startled, Li Suining pulled back the foot he was about to step inside with and stared blankly at Li Zhouming.

Li Zhouming’s expression was wistful as he shook his head. "She comes from a humble background, displaced and homeless. I happened to run into her. It's a chilly spring, so I'm letting her warm up."

"..."

Li Suining wanted to speak but stopped himself.

‘That’s a bit hard to believe… Grand-Uncle.’

Li Zhouming, however, seemed completely oblivious. He hung the fish on a hook, turned back, and grinned.

"Don't mind her. She's a poor child; she wouldn't know how to play something so elegant. She came aboard empty-handed, and I'm a vain man who likes to feign culture, so I had her hold a pipa for decoration."

Li Suining didn't know what to say. His throat felt dry. He watched the man for a moment before taking a seat at the edge of the cabin. As Li Zhouming poured wine, his mind drifted.

The last time he had drunk wine, it had been with Li Zhouda. That grand-uncle of his had been a man of fiery temperament and cruel methods, with the blood of countless people on his hands. When Wang Quwan led his army south to battle the Song, Li Suining had held a farewell toast for him, watching as he marched off with heroic resolve, only to fall in battle on the northern bank.

_Gurgle…_

The clear, fragrant wine was poured. Li Zhouming raised the cup to his own lips, took a sip, and then poured a cup for Suining. Li Suining watched silently as Li Zhouming let out a soft, slightly sheepish laugh.

"It's a good thing I ran into you today. Anyone else… I couldn't be bothered… It's just… just…"

He refilled the cup. "Let's make sure our Lady Xia doesn't find out about this…"

Only then did Li Suining recall that his grand-uncle was henpecked. On the lake, Li Zhouming could never win an argument against his wife. Things were different in the Southern Borderlands, where Xia Shouyu had softened into a capable and supportive partner. But by then, no one was in the mood to joke with her anymore, and those peaceful times hadn't lasted long.

Li Zhouming just looked at him, smiling. "I've met your younger brother. He's incredibly clever. His great-grandfather… that Li Chengzai, doesn't understand a thing. I dislike him immensely, so I can only make things difficult for the boy!"

The man’s words were sharp. Li Suining was taken aback and quickly replied, "The East Residence has its faults, and the elders may be foolish… but you can't blame the younger generation…"

He couldn't bear the thought of Li Suikuan suffering. In his past life, his brother had been plagued by melancholy because of their ancestors’ deeds. He would not see that happen again. He gritted his teeth and said in a low voice, 

"The matters of the East Residence's ancestors are not my brother's burden alone…"

Li Zhouming continued to watch him quietly, a smile playing on his lips as he drank, his gaze never wavering.

"I said I'd make things difficult for him, not that I'd torment him. You're far too protective."

It was then that Li Suining had a sudden epiphany. He was accustomed to the decisive and ruthless Li Zhouming of his past life, the one who suppressed rebellions with an iron fist. He had forgotten that the man before him was, at this moment, nothing more than a profligate dandy on the lake. Even if he were displeased, why would he waste his time tormenting a junior?

The delayed realization brought a wry, relieved smile to his lips. He apologized profusely, but Li Zhouming just laughed and praised him, though a hint of confusion lingered in his eyes as he joked,

"Some people on the lake are afraid of me, but you're the first in the direct line… What's there to fear about a useless person like me!"

Just as Li Suining was about to say more, his vision filled with a blinding golden light. Dizziness washed over him. His True Qi churned violently, he felt the faint trickle of blood in his nose, and the Illusory Core in his sea of qi bobbed up and down, resonating with some unseen force.

Li Zhouming was already on his feet and out of the cabin. Forcing down his discomfort, Li Suining stumbled out after him and looked up at the sky.

In the middle of the heavens, a brilliant radiance bloomed as a dazzling star suddenly rose!

‘The Martial Cultivation Star… The Song Emperor has ascended the throne! That’s right, it was around this time. But I was in seclusion back then, and my cultivation method wasn't so sensitive to the Great Void…’

That familiar sense of powerlessness, as if being watched by gods and immortals, surged through him, making him clench his jaw. He had replayed this scene in his mind a thousand times over the years, never able to forget the events that followed.

‘Can the Great Song be trusted? The alliance between the Li and Yang clans, how much friendship is truly there?’

Yang Zhuo and the Yang Clan cannot be equated. Yang Zhuo was merely Yang Zhuo of the Yang Clan, never rising above equal status even in the end. The Li Clan, however, _was_ King Wei's Li Clan. Any alliance or conflict between the two clans was ultimately a matter between the Yang Clan and King Wei.

‘The Underworld is using my family, and they could just as well be using Yang Zhuo. With the immortal methods of that entity in the Underworld, even if a True Monarch Tianwu were to appear, it would be difficult to escape His grasp. But to the Underworld, Yang Zhuo is more reliable than King Wei, no matter how you look at it.’

And that was why, even after the Li Clan was defeated and had retreated to the Southern Borderlands, even after Li Zhouming fell in battle and was transformed by the Pristine Water, Yang Zhuo remained the emperor. Right up to the day Li Suining himself died, he never learned the final fate of that emperor and his virtuous crown prince.

One thing was certain: the relationship between the Great Song Emperor and King Wei was poor, even cold. Publicly, there were countless rewards and titles bestowed, but the two sovereigns met only a handful of times.

‘The Great Song… for my family, it is both a pillar of support and a chain…’

He could only take a shallow breath, turning his gaze toward the lake surface to mask the storm of emotions within him.

"The Era of Conquest, Peace, and Martial Glory... is upon us."

Towering mountains pierced the heavens, wreathed in light clouds and flowing streams of purple qi. Palaces and pavilions rose in tiers among them.

At the highest point, the Purple Terrace glowed with a brilliant, golden light. A waterfall of purple qi swirled and coalesced, forming the figure of a woman in purple robes.

She appeared young, as if she had only recently achieved her divine ability. Her gaze, fixed on the horizon, was filled with anxiety. After a moment of hesitation, she thought:

‘The moon sets and the sun rises. The moment just before the dawn.’

She stared intently, the reflection of a tiny point of white light in the sky captured in her pupils. After a long silence and much deliberation, she finally drew a purple talisman from her sleeve. Holding it between two fingers, she waved it gently and stepped into a world of purple light.

This Blessed Land's Mystic Realm was saturated with a dense, boundless purple mist. Within the haze, there was only a jade throne and a small platform. As the Daoist Master took two steps forward, a figure in autumn-yellow robes was revealed.

It was a woman, kneeling in the purple qi. She had delicate green markings at the corners of her eyes, and her beautiful face was tinged with weariness. Her hands were clasped before her chest as she silently circulated a divine ability.

It was Daoist Master Tinglan.

Hearing the footsteps, the woman turned her head slightly.

"Wenqing?" she asked.

The purple-robed Daoist Master knelt beside her, positioning herself a respectful step behind.

"A bright star in daylight, a shift in the spiritual aura," she said in a low voice.

"According to the ancient texts, this is the Vast Profound Suspended Void… That star… must be the Martial Cultivation Star."

Daoist Master Tinglan was silent for a moment before she let out two soft coughs, a faint flush rising to her cheeks.

"It's not surprising, but it shows their impatience!"

Daoist Master Wenqing lowered her head, her voice laced with growing unease.

"I wonder… I wonder where the Great Daoist Master is… In this situation, we truly need a—"

Before she could finish, Tinglan shook her head, cutting her off. She covered her lips with her hand and swallowed a pill, causing puffs of white mist to swirl around her.

"Behind this Immortal Throne, there's an inscription from the Patriarch. Do you know of it?"

Wenqing paused, then nodded. Tinglan’s voice was hauntingly soft as she recited: 

"‘Cultivate the truth to attain immortality, be neither impatient nor boastful, seek the ultimate state of Purple Qi, and sleep embracing the Valley Water.’"

Wenqing looked up as a pale smile touched Tinglan's lips. "After returning from the north… I finally understood, and now it's clearer than ever. The so-called 'Cultivate the truth to attain immortality'—this 'truth' doesn't refer to the truth of the Dao, but to True Qi. And 'attaining immortality' isn't about reaching the Golden Throne, but about attaining the Immortal Origin—it refers to our Dao's 'Heavenly Cultivation Purple Qi Immortal Origin Metallic Essence'."

She coughed again and looked up. "Only after mastering the 'Tianwu True Qi' is the path to 'Heavenly Cultivation Purple Qi' opened… Martial Uncle… Martial Uncle is sleeping, embracing the Valley Water, just waiting for that day…"

Wenqing stared at her, dumbfounded, as Tinglan lowered her gaze.

"Therefore, be not impatient… therefore, be not boastful!"

A sliver of hope died in Wenqing’s heart.

"Then what do we…" she managed to ask.

Tinglan was already standing.

"According to the Daoist treatises of the various sects," she said faintly, "the two Qis of Tianxiu (Heavenly Cultivation) and Tianwu (Heavenly Martial) should revere the 'Taihua Classic'. The Classic says: 'Tianwu balances yin and yang on the left, Tianxiu governs light and dark on the right.' It not only balances yin and yang but also exists within them. When the two stand together, Tianxiu is yin, and Tianwu is yang."

She turned her gaze to the younger Daoist Master and coughed.

"It's unavoidable. Tianxiu and Tianwu are closely related. True Qi favors my cultivation. Now that Tianwu is ascendant in the world, holding the position of honor, our Purple Smoke Blessed Land can no longer afford to be ignorant of the times."

Wenqing’s eyes shot up in alarm, the gravity of the situation finally dawning on her. She rose from the ground, her brow furrowed.

"How can this be!"

"We've already surrendered all of Jiangnan. Isn't… isn't that enough? Must we dissolve the sect and submit to the Yang Clan's authority? How is that any different from the sect's destruction!"

With such a grave matter at stake, the purple-robed Daoist Master could listen no more. A look of grim resolve settled on her face.

"Our Dao is the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition! Even if we are to be destroyed, it must be with the sect's gates shattered and its Daoist Masters dead! We will never disgrace our ancestors!"

Putting aside the fact that the Purple Smoke Gate was controlled by the Kan and Wen families, the pride of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition—its ancient lineages, its sacred arts, its numerous disciples—would never allow Daoist Master Wenqing to yield.

But Tinglan shook her head, her tone placating. "‘True Qi’ is not ‘Bright Yang.’ It has no reason to drag you out from the mountains to demand loyalty and filial piety. Besides, the 'Heavenly Cultivation Purple Qi Immortal Origin Metallic Essence' is a free and unfettered within the Immortal Dao. Our Purple Smoke Gate itself is a symbol of good fortune. They want an immortal sect; they won't have us destroyed."

"Tianwu and Tianxiu are kin; they won't destroy us without reason. It will just be a matter of opening our gates and respecting the Monarch's decree. The Tianwu are extremely tolerant of the Immortal Dao. Have you not seen the Wanling Upper Sect?"

Wenqing slowly let out a breath of relief, though she still looked utterly lost. Tinglan’s gaze, however, was filled with a hollow coldness.

‘And with this… the dignity of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition is preserved?’

Wenqing knew it as well. She closed her eyes tightly and knelt on the ground for a long time, murmuring,

"My… my Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition… We gave them Jiangnan… and it still wasn't enough. Now they demand our submission."

Tinglan shook her head, her voice low and her gaze growing colder. She helped Wenqing to her feet.

"One Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition after another… Haven't you heard? The Supreme Yang Radiance is no more. Everything is achieved through submission. The Sima Clan, the Li Clan, the Chen Clan… none of them ever thought anything of it. In fact, they were ecstatic for the chance to submit…"

"Ultimately, you've all been standing on high for too long, fond of distributing spiritual resources to display the nobility of the Supreme Yang. You've forgotten how to bend your knees."

A faint flush crossed the face of the woman in autumn-yellow robes. She stabilized the divine ability within her body and said quietly,

"He knelt to me last year; this year, I bow to him in return. Even one as noble as the son of a True Hornless Dragon can be slain by the Profound Snare! If even a True Monarch cannot escape his fate, what is there to resent about being spared from death today, with our whole sect granted amnesty?!"
