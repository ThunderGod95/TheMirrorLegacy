# Chapter 1062: The Profound Casket

In his youth, the ancestor Li Tongya witnessed the sacking of the Pingya Island market. He later infiltrated the site and, using a water-control art, retrieved a jade casket from the eye of the array. The casket was pale azure, covered in dense, profound markings, but it was empty.

Though the ancestor found no treasure within, he sensed the casket's unique quality for storing precious items. He carried it with him, and it was eventually passed down, later serving as the vessel for the Sword Codex.

Li Ximing was no swordsman and had rarely handled the casket, so he should not have recognized it. However, back when the Li clan unified Moongaze and dismantled the Great Prohibition Array on Pingya Island, Li Xijun had taken this very casket out to study the island's formations. Li Ximing had been present and caught a glimpse, searing it into his memory.

Watching a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator now present this very object with such cautious stealth, how could Li Ximing not be astonished? It wasn't the right moment for questions. He formed a hand seal, activating 'World's Radiance'. The intangible Light of the Six Harmonies immediately gathered at his fingertips as he began a careful divination.

Yan Dushui didn't notice Li Ximing's brief stupor. He retrieved a black jade slip from his sleeve and handed it over, whispering, "Fellow Daoist, please press this talisman to your brow. It's the only way to see the spiritual item. This thing is incredibly bizarre. If it weren't anchored here by this piece of Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood, it would have drifted off long ago."

"Just... lifting it... it might shave off a bit of your destiny. I won't take any of the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood. It will all be yours as compensation!"

Li Ximing could already see everything clearly with his Immortal Mirror, but he accepted the jade slip with grim gravity, applied the talisman, and fell into thought.

The spiritual item was truly mystical. When his spiritual sense, mighty for a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, swept over the area, the wooden stake appeared utterly empty. He detected nothing. Only when the Light of the Six Harmonies grazed it did an anomaly flicker into existence.

The Light of the Six Harmonies was the Bright Yang Dao's only Life Divine Ability, its purpose to 'balance heaven and earth, interrogate the cosmos.' On a normal day, it sensed the energies of fate and destiny that saturated the world, filling every void. If spiritual sense perceived the world as an empty room containing various objects, the Light of the Six Harmonies perceived it as being submerged in a vast ocean, with those same objects resting on the seabed. The distinction was usually subtle.

But here in this cavern, his spiritual sense perceived only emptiness. The Light of the Six Harmonies _also_ perceived nothing but a void above the stump. This was a critical distinction. An ocean with no water? The anomaly was glaring.

'Exiled Qi can devour all energy signatures. If this were forged into a weapon, it could pass right through an enemy before they even knew they'd been hit!'

He marveled silently, opened the jade casket, and pushed it forward. He obviously couldn't touch the spiritual item directly with his divine ability; he could only use the Light of the Six Harmonies to nudge it, ever so gently, and lift.

The divine ability and dharma power within Li Ximing's body instantly hemorrhaged at a terrifying rate, as if he were trying to lift a mountain of blackest stone. The Light of the Six Harmonies wavered violently, yet all it accomplished was to make the feather flutter faintly.

But that faint flutter made Yan Dushui's eyes widen, his heart thumping in his chest.

'The master was right! This thing cannot be lifted by divine abilities or detected by spiritual sense. Only the fundamental order of heaven and earth, the ultimate destination of all spirits, the union of the cosmos and man, can interact with it... Thank heavens 'World's Radiance' is effective!'

Yan Dushui was overcome with joy, but Li Ximing's expression twisted.

As he moved the feather, his own Life Divine Ability was rapidly decaying. The Light of the Six Harmonies was being consumed, actively eroding his cultivation in that specific divine ability!

'Such a terrifying speed!'

His scalp prickled. He dumped his divine ability and dharma power into the effort like a raging waterfall, and the feather finally, _finally_ drifted down into the jade casket. Strangely, the moment the object—which had felt heavier than a mountain—settled inside, it became as light as its feathery appearance suggested, possessing no weight at all.

Li Ximing's face was now chalk white. The talisman on his brow dissolved into ash. He pushed through the exhaustion, using the last of his Light of the Six Harmonies to gather some of the cavern's black qi, sealing it in the casket to nourish the feather. He stood breathing deeply for several moments before a hint of color returned to his cheeks.

'Too close. If that talisman hadn't absorbed most of the backlash, I would have suffered internal injuries.'

After confirming he was internally sound, he sealed the casket and presented it to Yan Dushui.

"Congratulations!"

Yan Dushui's eyes were bloodshot. He nodded heavily, gestured to the stake on the platform, and said,

"The Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood. It's all yours, Fellow Daoist."

Even though the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood could be taken normally with a divine ability, Li Ximing scanned it cautiously several times before reaching out to collect it. He then surveyed his surroundings, memorizing the various runes, and thought to himself:

'This place is long and narrow. It feels like a coffin.'

He suspected the black qi drifting in the air was valuable, so he began to bottle some. As he did, he watched Yan Dushui. The old man looked deeply conflicted, gazing around the room with a mixture of reluctance and hesitation, before finally stepping forward.

In the front hall, the incense stick still burned, though it was now slightly shorter. The darkness in the chamber seemed to have deepened, so thick you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.

Li Ximing took careful note of this and also spotted a second passage on the far side of the hall. When it became clear Yan Dushui had no intention of exploring it, Li Ximing's mind raced. He appeared to walk forward at a leisurely pace, but he was secretly activating his Immortal Artifact once more.

In an instant, the oppressive gloom vanished from his sight. The patterns on the walls became perfectly clear. Down the other passage, six stone lamps appeared, illuminating a path deep into the rock. At the passage's end stood a smooth stone wall.

Faint markings were etched upon the wall, outlining what looked like a small, sinister array. It pulsed with the profound mystery of the Shaman-Register Dao.

'This place isn't very large... no bigger than a house.'

Li Ximing had no time to study it further. The two men crossed the threshold and stepped outside, the cavern immediately vanishing behind them in the impenetrable black mist. When they had both fully exited the location and stepped back into the Great Void, they turned to look back, but the cavern was gone, as if it had never been.

Li Ximing's expression was carefully neutral, but he had already memorized the cavern's location. He turned to Yan Dushui. The old man was oblivious, listlessly clutching the casket and muttering,

"An ancestral treasure, passed down for a thousand years... and it ends up in someone else's hands."

Li Ximing knew the casket was destined for Nine Mounds; they had orchestrated this entire event. But what choice did Yan Dushui have? His lifespan was nearing its end, and his descendants were failures.

"Ancestral treasures exist to protect the clan," Li Ximing offered. "It doesn't really matter whose hands it falls into. Besides, this opportunity to build a relationship with Nine Mounds... other families would kill for it."

But these were just polite platitudes. Even Li Ximing, standing right beside him, felt little pity. His gaze was fixed on the jade casket. After a few more empty comforts, he allowed a trace of envy to show on his face and asked,
\
"This journey has been truly eye-opening. But... that casket... what is it? How can it so easily contain an object of Exiled Qi, something said to be completely undetectable?"

Yan Dushui was still agitated. He glanced back at Li Ximing, forcing a smile.

"This casket was lent to me by Daoist Master Lingdu of Nine Mounds, prepared specifically for this task. It's not just you who can't discern its origin, Fellow Daoist... I can't either."

Li Ximing nodded and pressed no further. The two proceeded in silence, walking by tacit agreement toward Nine Mounds Mountain. Only when the sea of crimson leaves covering the mountain slopes came into view did Yan Dushui speak again, his voice desolate.

"You were right, Fellow Daoist. My ancestors tried for generations, but not one could retrieve that thing. Without this jade casket, it was like entering a treasure mountain only to return empty-handed. It was all pointless, just leaving it there..."

They entered the mountain, and Li Ximing saw Lingdu sitting just as they had left him, quietly engrossed in a Daoist text. He seemed not to have moved an inch, simply waiting for their return.

Yan Dushui bowed respectfully before the table and smiled. "Master... This one, Lin Yi, has come to pay his respects. The item has been retrieved for you."

Li Ximing had known the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition held a high status, but he'd never imagined it was _this_ high. He was secretly speechless. Lingdu, however, acted as if this was perfectly normal. He smiled, invited them to sit, and placed the jade casket on the table.

"You've both worked hard," he said, raising an eyebrow.

The old man didn't open the casket. Instead, he drew a clay coin from his sleeve. It was barely two fingers wide and as thin as a cicada's wing. He placed it atop the casket. The side facing up was a glossy black, inscribed with four characters:

Treat Death as Life

As he set it down, the clay coin, moved by some invisible force, flipped over by itself, revealing the four characters on its other side:

Supreme Obscurity Becomes Sacred

Apparently, the jade casket could not be opened outside of that 'ghost-house'. Lingdu had to use this special method to confirm the spiritual item was inside. Content, he put the coin and casket away and turned to Yan Dushui.

"I have asked on your behalf. In addition to the pure essence you were promised, Zhiyan Peak is willing to form a bond. They will support three of your descendants, spanning from you to your grandchildren. As for whether any of them can awaken a divine ability... that will depend on your family's own fortune."

Yan Dushui nodded silently, offering his thanks again and again, before falling into a long silence. Lingdu then turned to Li Ximing with a smile. 

"Congratulations, Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing's gains from this trip were immense. While he had sacrificed a significant amount of his cultivation, that could eventually be restored with medicinal pills. A piece of Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood the size of a tabletop, however, was a treasure he might never encounter again.

His thoughts had been completely stuck on the jade casket, but this reminder sent a thrill of joy through him.

'Zhouwei... me... Jiangqian... Que'Wan... this is more than enough for all our soul lamps. It's barely a fraction of the wood! I can cut off two palm-sized pieces for Minghui, and the rest will be more than enough to use freely. I can even start researching life-saving or body-splitting consumables...'

Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood was exceedingly precious. He had only heard that a few of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition possessed any, passed down from their ancestors specifically for their Purple Mansion Realm experts. He recalled that Changxi of Profound Peak Gate had used a 'Jade Seat Gold-and-Silver-veined Soul Lamp'. That lamp was merely a large life-jade, crafted from Still Earth and other jade treasures. Its only advantage was that a divine ability could be infused into it for a long period without needing constant nurturing, making it convenient for a Purple Mansion cultivator.

Li Ximing was in high spirits, but Yan Dushui remained silent and mournful. Seeing this, Li Ximing returned to his previous question, asking once more about the mysterious casket. Lingdu smiled and shook his head, his expression gradually turning serious.

"If we are to speak of its true origin... it once belonged to True Monarch Taixu."

Li Ximing froze. Even Yan Dushui's head snapped up, his face a mask of disbelief.

"It is truly so... so revered?"

Lingdu sighed softly.

"At that time, True Monarch Taixu had not yet achieved the Dao. He was cultivating in the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven, known colloquially as the Green Pine Mirage-Realm. After all, the Green Pine Daoist Tradition has risen and fallen three times; its lineage has been fractured and rejoined. The Green Pine Temple alone is not its sole inheritor."

"Legend holds that there were several 'seats' within that realm. At each seat, a certain immortal left a jade casket for his disciples, corresponding to Cultivation Transcendence, Changhuai, Hengzhu, Sword Gate, Purple Smoke, and Azure Pond."

"This object is one of those. It is the very one that belonged to True Monarch Taixu."

He gave Li Ximing a heavy look.

"Your family has entered that realm before. You should have seen it."

'Green Pine Island!'

Li Ximing was reeling.

'If that's true... then the casket in _my_ possession... which one is it?!'

Li Ximing's mind raced, but he only nodded silently.

Lingdu continued, "When the True Monarchs opened that realm, there were six caskets inside. The Changhuai and Hengzhu ones were empty. The Azure Pond and Purple Smoke caskets were lost. The Sword Gate casket was recovered, and the Cultivation Transcendence one went to the Kui Cultivating Sect."

He deliberately said 'Kiu Cultivating' and paused. Seeing no surprise on Li Ximing's face, he understood that Li Ximing also knew of Xiukui's history. Stroking his beard, he went on.

"One of the lost caskets ended up with a certain cultivator. He was a man blessed by a fire-virtue destiny and possessed outstanding talent. Our Great Daoist Master thought very highly of him, looking after him and offering much guidance. Eventually, our Great Daoist Master acted as an intermediary to return the Purple Smoke casket. Great Daoist Master Zimu accepted the contents, but entrusted the jade casket itself to our Daoist Tradition for safekeeping."

Hearing this, Li Ximing was thunderstruck and momentarily speechless.

The Li family had been involved in that jade casket incident! The cultivator Lingdu mentioned... it was almost certainly the self-preserving Tu Longjian, who was now in hiding overseas!

'It was Senior Junjian!'

'Senior Junjian had deep ties with the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition! And not just that—it was on the guidance of this Great Daoist Master of Yuandao that he had left Jiangnan so early to hide in the Northern Sea!'

All the clues snapped together, and his expression grew grim. His heart pounded.

'When did this happen? Does this mean he was a pawn for the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition all along? When the other Daoist Masters sealed the Great Void, how did he escape? It must have been this Great Daoist Master who saved him! Only someone with his immense divine ability and Dao-Profundity could have spirited a man away from right under the noses of all those Daoist Masters!'

'And was this Great Daoist Master's motive all for this jade casket?'

He bit back his questions. His first instinct was to wonder if the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition's favor toward him was due to his connection with Senior Tu Longjian. But when he glanced at Lingdu, the old man seemed completely oblivious, offering no subtle glances or hints at the mention of Tu Longjian's name.

The old man continued on seamlessly.

"The casket itself isn't priceless. It was an ordinary thing, but it was present for the enlightenment of those True Monarchs and carries the symbolic weight of being passed from master to disciple. Because of this, it absorbed a sliver of their transcendent aura, becoming extraordinary. Storing rare and unusual treasures is, of course, no problem for it."

He seemed nostalgic, shaking his head.

"A Purple Mansion expert has already awakened a divine ability. Most objects permitted to circulate in this world cannot hide from such power. When you find something that even a Purple Mansion cultivator cannot identify the materials of, cannot guess the origin of... nine times out of ten, it is connected to a True Monarch. And ninety-nine percent of _those_ items are simply things a True Monarch once used..."

He sighed again.

"These things were never truly valued by those great beings. They don't have any specific, wondrous powers. In the hands of a low-level cultivator, they're useless, apart from being durable. Even in the hands of a figure with the heaven-shaking Dao-Profundity of a Great Daoist Master, its only use is to store a bit of Exiled Qi."

Listening to these secrets had eased Yan Dushui's dark mood. He couldn't help but ask,

"But what if such an item _was_ valued by them? What if it _does_ have some wondrous power?"

Lingdu turned to him and laughed.

"You can't outrun destiny. Your life would be over. At that point, what could you do but kneel and kowtow? You'd have to seriously consider if your life is worth more... You think you could actually _take_ such a thing?"
