# Chapter 1197: A Step Down

Li Que'wan didn't know where the technique had come from, but she guessed Li Ximing had obtained it and gave it no further thought. Meeting her brother's questioning gaze, she explained,

"This 'Spring Morning Drizzle,' while unremarkable, is exceptionally rare. It should be of some use for King Wei's alchemy."

The letter had, after all, come from Li Ximing, establishing a connection between him and Situ Huo. Neither Li Que'wan nor her brother wished to overstep their authority. Seeing that the item was indeed useful, they exchanged a look.

"I'll go inside and ask great-granduncle about it," Li Que'wan said. "If he approves, I can bring this to him for his pill refinement as well."

"Good," Li Jiangqian nodded.

"That settles that," Li Que'wan continued. "The only pressing matter, then, is the Blessing of Divinity. It requires an immense infusion of spiritual resources—and I don't mean the low-grade kind. From what I gather, great-granduncle believes Li Wushao is the most suitable candidate. He cultivates Mansion Water, and our family possesses the 'Neck Feathers,' a perfect spiritual resource for it. Supplemented with the 'Profound Minister Moon Essence,' the compatibility is ideal." She paused. "Do you have any other candidates in mind, brother?"

Li Jiangqian considered it for a moment.

"The primary purpose of this Blessing of Divinity is to act as an extension of our will—refining Spiritual Artifacts, inscribing formations, traversing the Great Void—so we don't have to trouble Daoist Master Guo for every little thing. The candidate's power is secondary to their loyalty. Besides Li Wushao, I have one other person in mind: the Elder White Ape."

A shadow of worry crossed his face.

"These worldly affairs are never certain. We need a backup in case something goes wrong during the process. My proposal is this: we perform the bestowal on Li Wushao first, but have the Elder White Ape recuperate and prepare his destiny as well. On one hand, it will help advance his cultivation. On the other, he will be ready as a contingency."

Li Que'wan smiled.

"An ordinary person might face the risk of failure, but I have this under control. Both are esteemed elders to us, and this Blessing of Divinity is a great honor, a step toward something greater."

She understood what her brother was really implying—the possibility of Li Wushao falling or being gravely injured in some future Purple Mansion Realm battle. But his cold rationality sent a shiver of unease through her.

'No,' she thought firmly. 'Elder Wushao has protected our family for generations. I can't let anything happen to him. I won't send him into actual battles.'

She issued the command and waited in the mountains, pouring herself a small cup of spiritual tea. With a flick of her sleeve, a feather-like object—the Neck Feathers—appeared in her palm. Channeling a divine ability into her other hand, she flicked a finger, sending the spiritual resource dissolving into the tea. Before long, the old demon ascended the mountain path. He bowed respectfully. 

"Greetings, Daoist Master."

"Elder, there is no need for such formality."

Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow.

"Your nature-spirit has been returned to you, I trust?"

Li Wushao looked confused but answered,

"Yes... Young Master Zhouluo took pity on me. My cultivation had stagnated, shackled as I was. Considering I could still be of use on the lake, he released my nature-spirit before sending me back."

Li Jiangqian frowned. At that moment, Li Wushao's vision flared. A silver radiance descended beside the empty stone table, coalescing into the form of a breathtakingly beautiful Daoist Master. She smiled gently.

"Released or not, it makes no difference."

She raised two fingers and tapped the old demon lightly between the eyes. A point of pale white light drifted out and floated softly into her slender hand.

After nearly a century, Li Wushao was intimately familiar with the hollow feeling of having his nature-spirit stripped away. Yet this time, though he could see the wisp of essence that was like his own flesh and blood hovering in her palm, he felt no sense of loss at all. It was as if nothing had happened.

This was the power of 'Awaiting the Supreme Divine'.

He barely had time to process it, his mind reeling, before he finally recognized the woman.

"The... the Eldest Young Miss?!" he stammered in shock.

"Indeed. Please, Elder, dispense with the courtesies." Li Que'wan rose and gave a smiling nod, her expression turning serious. "I have invited you here today to offer you a great opportunity."

"An opportunity?"

Li Wushao was still stunned. The crimson-robed Daoist Master beside him personally offered him a jade cup. Overwhelmed, he hastily accepted it and, at Li Jiangqian's urging, drained the tea in a single gulp.

A cool sensation rushed down his throat, and a surging spiritual energy erupted within him, threatening to tear his mortal frame apart. A feeling of extreme peril seized his heart, but then the woman before him turned her hand over, revealing a finger-sized Mystic Pill, silver with crimson markings. Her voice rang out like a decree:

'Mountain demon, by this blessing receive, let deviance be purged and righteousness conceived! Ascend now, and touch the Profound Truth—accept this fate!'

The Mystic Pill began to vibrate, its crimson markings glowing one by one, bathing it in a slowly spreading golden light. With incredible speed, she channeled her divine ability, driving the point of light—the nature-spirit—into the pill.

"Focus your mind!" she commanded.

Having ingested a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resource, the demon's face was already contorted in agony. His stomach churned as if being torn apart, and his body uncontrollably reverted to its true form. A dense coat of black scales covered his skin, and his serpentine jaw gaped open, revealing rows of sharp, uneven white fangs, poised to devour.

Li Que'wan simply extended a single finger, pinning his writhing form to the ground. With a flick of her wrist, she sent the Spiritual Treasure plunging into his Shengyang Acupoint. The old demon let out a final, agonized shriek as his corporeal form dissolved into a dissipating cloud of black light, leaving nothing behind. Only the Mystic Pill remained, suspended in the air, pulsing faintly with a life of its own.

Suppressing the Spiritual Treasure with her divine ability, Li Que'wan's expression grew solemn.

"It will take me over half a year of nurturing to refine his nature-spirit within the treasure. Once he is released to cultivate again, it will likely take several more years. He will require the aid of Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resources and items. Most critically, the final spiritual item we infuse will bind itself to him within the treasure, almost single-handedly determining the upper limits of his potential as a bestowed spirit."

Li Jiangqian understood her implication.

"The... spiritual essence?"

She nodded gravely.

"It is an incredibly precious substance, but not difficult for our family to acquire. great-granduncle has no use for it at present, so we shouldn't be stingy. I will report back to him. For now, brother, I leave the family's affairs in your hands."

---

Purple light converged and golden clouds cast their sheen. Amidst layers of immortal vapor, the Purple Jade Terrace stood tall and proud. Though weathered by the ages, it shone with a brilliant luster, as if its greatest moments were still to come, imbued with an aura of eternal permanence.

Upon the terrace, a woman in purple robes stood with her hands clasped behind her back, pacing thoughtfully. Opposite her, a woman in white, a sword upon her back, stood as if sculpted from wind and snow, poring over a scroll. After a long while, she looked up.

"All of these are viable," she said. "The only issue is that wisp of Li Baleful Qi; it's a bit deficient. We'll need to supplement it with some Li Fire, but there are methods for everything else." A flicker of envy crossed her eyes before she continued, "They've only just begun their rise, not even a century has passed... and now they're establishing another pillar. It's almost unheard of. By my count, that's three divine abilities now. It just goes to show, you need a powerful figure at the helm to unify everyone's strength."

Tinglan, the woman in purple, wore a complex expression. 

"I believe there's more to it. The Li Clan is in a unique position. The threat from the north has been resolved, but they still have enemies in the west, watching like tigers. They won't rest easy until that mountain is secured. Otherwise, they might as well spend their time and energy renovating their old formation rather than building a new one from scratch."

"That mountain is the very heart of the problem," Ning Wan, the woman in white, said seriously. "I've heard it's called the Western Mountains—a mortal range. It may possess earth veins, but it certainly has no spiritual veins. Where could they possibly anchor a formation?"

The purple-robed Daoist Master mused, "They could either build it beyond the mountains, near Guyan, or across from them, on the western bank. But that's not for us to decide. In any case, after careful comparison, the 'Trinary Yang Annual Radiance' is the most suitable component. My Dao lineage is centered on Purple Qi, which venerates the Three Yin; we have little involving the Lesser Yang."

Ning Wan thought for a long time.

"I have a technique here, passed down from my ancestor. It originated from the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition. It's both new and effective, designed to simulate the Sundering of the Lesser Yang. It can be used as an art, or as a Dao in itself. Take a look, sister."

She produced a golden scroll.

"The Golden Oneness Tradition is formidable, after all. They were on good terms with the Supreme Yang in their day. Daoist Master Qiushui was also close to my ancestor, so this technique is genuine."

The two sat together, delving into the intricacies of the scroll, formulating a plan around the spiritual item. Time flowed differently on the mountain; three months passed in the blink of an eye. When they had finally fleshed out their ideas, Tinglan shook her head with a helpless air.

"I hear the one presiding over the lake now is King Wei's eldest son, Daoist Master Changli—Li Jiangqian. How the world turns... Less than a century ago, the Li Clan depended on the Supreme Yang, and now things are so different."

"An alliance forged early. It's a fine story," Ning Wan remarked.

Thanks to Daoist Master Yuansu's arrangements, her relationship with the Li Clan was built on a deep, unspoken foundation, even if it wasn't outwardly warm. Seeing Tinglan's worried expression, she asked,

"Personal feelings aside, you've taken two of their own as disciples. Isn't your connection with them as stable as it could be?"

Tinglan sighed. "They were promising pair of children, both cultivating at Purple Smoke. But that disastrous defeat drained my fellow Daoists, and even my own blessed land was sealed off. I entrusted one of them to Kuang Yu, and now I'll surely never get her back... As for the other..."

She shook her head bitterly.

"She was a brilliant child, but far too young and naive. She's been coddled all these years, and it has made her proud and arrogant. It's true that this temperament makes her exceptionally suited for her cultivation method—she's advanced a thousand miles a day—but as her power has grown, she has distanced herself from the family even more."

"Why?" Ning Wan asked, puzzled. "Is she not needed at the lake? Did she offend someone? With three or four members rising to the divine ability level, what reason could she have to stay away?"

"Neither, actually," the purple-robed Daoist Master replied. "Wenqing asked her. She feels that while the family is glorious and ascendant, they only provide her with a standard allotment of spiritual resources. No one truly cares for her. She doesn't know who she could possibly approach without feeling like she's just chasing influence, so she's too proud to even try..."

Ning Wan smiled, a hint of doubt in her eyes.

"If you ask me, she's a stubborn one, chasing after some notion of 'sincerity.' What is sincerity, really? Family sticks together. You meet a few times, and if you can't get past the pride, a bond exists. Stay apart too long, and it vanishes. What does she expect? For Zhaojing to personally go to the Bureau of Immortal Rites and beg her to come home?"

The worry on Tinglan's face deepened. She paced a circle on the terrace. 

"Sister, let me be frank. I have certain secret arts tied to this terrace. A few days ago, Qianli's aura became highly unstable. She's drifting further and further away... By my judgment, she will likely perish within the next year or two."

Ning Wan's head snapped up. 

"Qianli? The one with the Han Family bloodline?"

Tinglan nodded grimly.

"She is my most prized disciple. The Bright Yang incident destroyed her clan, the Han Family, which was a branch from a northern prefecture. Her bloodline is strong, and she inherited Bright Yang's karmic ties, which is why she came to study under me."

"But the 'Treasured Reservoir' technique she practices is inherently Yin. The truly potent versions are held only by the great powers, and her path is even more specific. It has a secret requirement: the cultivator must be a virgin. She was close with Chu Yi, and she was already a bit old when she joined my lineage. She missed that crucial step."

She pressed her fingers to her temple, a look of weakness on her face.

"She is also Li Quexi's master. With her gone, of all those in seclusion, only Wen Wu has any chance of advancing. The generations below them were all severely impacted by the Supreme Yang's decline; their numbers have dwindled. Picking the best of a poor lot... there is only Quexi."

"This is my dilemma. If we elevate her, in a few decades, King Wei will undoubtedly be a Great Daoist Master. If she is foolish then, things will become ugly. Yet, if Bright Yang's radiance fades by that time, she will be dragged down with it."

Attaining the Golden Core was difficult, and the Li Clan's list of enemies grew by the day. Yet even in this predicament, neither woman considered the clan's extinction. Their fear was of the northern powers coming to settle old scores. Ning Wan frowned.

"I don't find her particularly outstanding."

"There is perhaps a ten or twenty percent chance," Tinglan said. "It all comes down to whether we find that spiritual item for her or not."

"Then it would be better to have her accept her limits and stop here," Ning Wan said flatly.

"I wish it were that simple," Tinglan said with a sigh of resignation. "But you know the directives from the Bureau of Immortal Rites. We are all one under the 'True Purple,' and the Yang Clan is desperate for my Purple Qi Dao lineage to produce more successes. They want to use the flourishing of immortal arts to bring glory to their Martial Cultivation. Qianli was our best hope!"

"Now Qianli is lost, and Quexi is frequently at the Bureau. The Yang Clan knows she is of Li blood; how could the Emperor not have taken notice of her? If I were to request it, the Yang Clan would spare no expense in providing spiritual items and resources! If I hold her back now, it will only invite more suspicion."

Ning Wan considered this.

"Her chances of a breakthrough are slim anyway. Let her try. Everyone has their own destiny. You can't possibly stand against the tide of the world and snuff out her potential to reach for a divine ability, can you?"

Tinglan was silent for a long time. The white-robed immortal rose to her feet with a small, wry laugh.

"In that case, I have a solution. You simply gather the spiritual items and resources, and let her attempt her breakthrough with a clear mind. If she fails, then all is for naught. If she succeeds, you watch the political landscape. Should Bright Yang remain powerful, you tell her the spiritual items were a secret gift from the Li Clan."

She winked.

"She's searching for sincerity and is too proud to make the first move. Give her that step down, an honorable way out—the story that her family was helping her in secret. Then, you quietly inform Li Ximing. After all, you will have helped bring a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator closer to his family. Why would he refuse? He would even owe you a favor."

"And when Bright Yang begins to wane and the situation shifts, you reveal the 'truth'—that you worked tirelessly to mend the rift between her and her family, but the Li Clan continued to ignore her. Once again, you give her a moral high ground to stand on..."

Tinglan stared, stunned. She studied the woman before her, speechless for a long moment before finally managing,

"You... you frighten me."

Ning Wan shook her head, a trace of melancholy flickering across her beautiful face.

"Don't forget my origins. My former sect used such schemes constantly. It is only that I now disdain to use them myself."

Having found a solution to a problem that had plagued her, Tinglan's mood lifted considerably. Intrigued by this new side of her friend, she couldn't help but ask,

"It makes me curious. If something truly were to happen to Bright Yang, would you lift a finger to help?"

Ning Wan picked up her teacup, her eyes clouding over. She avoided a direct answer.

"I am merely a piece on the corner of the board. What use could I be? This plan is just idle talk. For all we know, when you secretly ask Zhaojing, he may not even want the favor."

Tinglan's reaction was swift, her own expression dimming. She set down her cup and sighed.

"You have a point. Zhaojing is not a man who lacks magnanimity. One more cultivator means little to him, but to lose one is to lose a life. Quexi cannot see this, but Zhaojing... perhaps he truly is making contingency plans... a way to shelter some of the Li Clan if the worst should come to pass."

Ning Wan, however, remained pessimistic.

"He may have it in him to become a Changxi," she said quietly. "But I do not have it in me to become the Moongaze Li Clan."
