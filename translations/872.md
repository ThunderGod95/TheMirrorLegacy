# Chapter 872: Crimson Light

Yan Hu stood in the light, gazing at the pitch-black Great Void, which he had never seen before. He couldn't help but worry:

‘According to my fellows, being captured by a Daoist Master means being forced back into your original form to serve as their mount... If I maintain this human body, am I being disrespectful?’

‘But this person’s movements are unpredictable. I’ve never heard of him before, so I don’t know if he already has a mount... If I’m ridden back, I might offend a others before I even reach the lake...’

He knew he wasn't irreplaceable, which only made him more cautious. He glanced around nervously. The Profound Light beneath his feet didn't even seem large enough for his true form to stand on. Yet, in the time it took for these thoughts to cross his mind, they had already broken through the Great Void, and a shimmering lake surface appeared below.

In the middle of the lake was a great island—Pingya Island. Pillars of purple-gold, covered in intricate patterns, stood upon the land. They varied in height, projecting an air of solemn dignity. Cultivators flew back and forth across the island, creating a bustling scene.

Li Ximing's spiritual sense swept the area. The island's main hall was currently under construction. He flew directly toward the Viewing Pavilion Platform.

Spiritual flames raged upon the Viewing Pavilion Platform. Golden and purple fires intertwined. A ceaseless torrent of Li Fire and Baleful Qi poured into the conflagration, causing it to surge in violent waves. Six Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators sat cross-legged on the platform, circulating their dharma power to refine the spirit embryo.

Witnessing this magnificent sight, Yan Hu, standing to the side, shrank his neck. He felt the suffocating pressure radiating from the flames and dared not make a sound.

As Li Ximing expected, Li Jiangqian was there. Seeing Li Ximing arrive, he stepped forward and bowed.

"Greetings, Daoist Master! Reporting to the Daoist Master... Senior Chu has arrived at the Viewing Pavilion Platform!"

Chu Minglian was old, but his arms were powerful, and his build likely rivaled Ding Weizeng's. He wore red robes, with iron tools hanging from his waist. He walked to the front and bowed.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Chu Minglian was truly an old senior of the Li family, having seen several generations pass. In the past, when they met on the river, Li Ximing would have had to call him senior. Now that Li Ximing was a Daoist Master, it was naturally Chu Minglian who bowed to him.

Li Ximing simply used his divine ability to lift the man. "Old sir, there is no need for such courtesy."

Chu Minglian seemed overcome with emotion. He spoke softly, "When I was young... I forged artifacts right here on Pingya Island. I never thought that after more than a hundred years, the world would be turned upside down. Divine abilities mastered, capable of shifting the tides... and yet, when I return to this lake... it is still to forge artifacts!"

Li Ximing smiled in response. He retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve—one recording the concepts he had formulated long ago—and handed it to the old man.

"Old sir, please take a look at this first."

This was naturally not *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire*. That text was far too difficult for the Foundation Establishment Realm. Instead, this slip contained Li Ximing’s own calculations. He signaled Li Jiangqian over, casually handing the wolf-demon to him.

"Send the twelve people over... This Tiger Demon is one I brought back from the Quanwu Mountains. He will be of great use later. Use the Six Dams Matched Life Method to secure him first, and give him some spell arts to study."

Li Jiangqian immediately nodded and led the Tiger Demon away. Li Ximing turned back, speaking softly:

"I invited the old sir here this time for this spirit embryo. Others may not be familiar with the Chu clan’s artifact forging techniques, but my family understands them well. They are the finest we have ever seen... Back then, Daoist Master Tianque ...also had He Ting forge his spirit embryo. Since the old sir's skills are even greater, I trust there will be no issues."

Besides that point, the spirit embryo Daoist Master Tianque had forged was complex. He began refining it right after he broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm. It was nurtured by the immortal foundation of forty-five Daoist traditions plus a century of time from a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. In the end, it even consumed He Ting himself. This showed how much effort was invested... They were the Golden Feather Sect, after all. It was clearly not something a technique like *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire* could compare to. The difficulty of the Li family's current endeavor was naturally much lower.

Chu Minglian stroked his beard while reading the jade slip, nodding silently.

"Daoist Master, the ingenuity of this platform's design... leaves this lowly one utterly astounded... If it is a matter of refining Li Fire and adding Baleful Qi, this lowly one can manage those tasks... But this Bright Yang spiritual essence... I fear I am not competent to handle it."

Li Ximing nodded. "This part will naturally be handled by my divine ability. However, I do not understand artifact forging; I am relying on the mysteries of the ancient method and the augmentation of this high tower. You will remain nearby, adding the fire and baleful qi, guiding the tempering process. I will assist you with my divine ability. Together, we will perfect the spirit embryo."

Chu Minglian visibly relaxed. Although he had accumulated significant wealth over the years, he could not afford to compensate them if the spirit embryo was ruined. Li Ximing, however, was full of anticipation. He rode the light upward and took the ink-black, jade-like round stone from his sleeve.

Within the round stone was a swath of brilliant golden color. Li Ximing explained its origin to Chu Minglian. The old man was stunned at first, then sighed deeply. Unexpectedly, he replied:

"May the Daoist Master not laugh... This old man... saw the Shield of White Sun in my early years... I have some experience with it."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing reacted quickly, understanding immediately. He thought:

‘Chu Yi... That’s right. This old master is the same as Qian Lizi... They are both part of the legacy left behind by the previous generation's 'Great One'. When the various families divided the spoils, Purple Smoke took Qian Lizi, and this old master was acquired by the Ning family...’

This was a significant matter. Li Ximing nodded, listening as he continued:

"That 'Great One'... his weapon at the time was... forged using Celestial Yang Radiant Copper as the body, integrating both Radiant Sky Stone and the Shield of White Sun, and etched using White Dew Blood..."

"In the very beginning, it was just a piece of spirit copper. He acquired a piece of the Shield of White Sun about the size of a fingernail and asked me to merge it... At the time, I was shocked by his profound fortune, but I did not know the true extent of it."

Li Ximing had heard from Li Zhouwei that Chu Yi was also the Wei Grand Ancestor. He was inwardly alarmed, but since both Qian Lizi and Chu Minglian had been employed by their respective families without issue, he listened in silence.

Chu Minglian merely smiled. "He has gone to Mount Luoxia now... There has been no news for so many years. I understand he wishes to sever his mortal ties and does not want to see us. If the Daoist Master happens to see that Great One anywhere, I beg you to ask after his cultivation. If you could just give this lowly one a single word... how many divine abilities has he achieved? When this lowly one offers incense to the ancestors... it would add to the joy..."

Li Ximing remained silent, answering in a low voice: "He is, after all, a 'Great One' of Luoxia, one of the figures at the very pinnacle. I fear I will not have the opportunity to meet him..."

Chu Minglian waved his hands hastily. "My apologies... My apologies."

Li Ximing lightly tossed the ink-jade stone in his hand. The brilliant light within flowed like water, falling into the flames. Layers upon layers of Profound Light emerged. The twelve auxiliary towers lit up, and the guest cultivators who had been channeling their power were instantly cut off and forced to withdraw.

The fire was momentarily suppressed, revealing the artifact-ruler within.

Even when used only for nurturing, the power of a True Fire could not be underestimated. Yet the Shichuan was indeed of exceptional quality. After being nurtured by the True Fire for so long, it was only glowing faintly red. As the spiritual essence landed on the ruler, it emitted a sizzling sound.

Immediately, multicolored clouds ascended, shimmering with golden light. The sounds of cicadas chirping and beasts roaring echoed across the sky. Li Ximing felt a pang of heartache watching this:

"I can only hope that consuming such a precious spiritual essence does more than just increase its speed!"

Chu Minglian pressed two fingers together, spitting out his own True Fire. Li Ximing glanced at it, then used his divine ability to wield the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire. He advanced with it, joining the artifact refining. The twelve Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the auxiliary towers also took their seats and began circulating their dharma power.

"RUMBLE!"

Only because the spirit embryo existed in a state between a dharma artifact and a spiritual artifact could they utilize such a shortcut. Instantly, streams of golden runes materialized, landing upon the Shichuan and embedding themselves into it, one by one.

Chu Minglian’s skill was truly profound. Though he spoke humbly, his ability was obvious the moment he acted. Augmented by Li Ximing’s divine ability and True Fire, he was like a fish in water, drawing the runes with complete mastery and zero hesitation.

As light and shadow flickered across the platform, the runes on the jade ruler solidified one after another. Li Ximing released his control and retreated. Chu Minglian remained in the air, directing the dharma power of the others, focusing intently on the nurturing process. The Li family members had long prepared ample Bright Yang spiritual items and Baleful Fire Qi, sending them up along with pills to restore dharma power.

These spiritual items weren't priceless, but some were extremely difficult to find. Only a family as deeply rooted as the Li, with connections to all the surrounding houses, could acquire them so quickly.

Li Ximing brushed his sleeves. Just initiating this process had cost him the better part of half a month, but the gains were significant:

‘Chu Minglian’s status is different, after all. His techniques far exceed my expectations... Coupled with the spiritual essence, and assuming the lake provides sufficient resources... it might not even take two years... The quality will be even better than I originally estimated!’

"In a few more days, we can pull the people back and resume rotating between two shifts."

He entrusted the Viewing Pavilion Platform to Chu Minglian, feeling greatly relieved. He turned and rode his light back toward Qingdu.

Li Ximing had originally come to deliver the good news to Li Xuanxuan. He landed on the Talisman Peak at Qingdu, only to hear the sound of laughter. Raising an eyebrow, he saw a young master dressed in red robes standing outside the courtyard.

This young master held an ornate fan, striking a refined and dashing pose, though his face was powdered, and his posture affected. He was bowing with both hands, calling out:

"Old Master! Old Master! Please listen..."

Li Ximing glanced over and recognized this grandson of his. After all, when the various Li family members had recounted the events of the past years... this kid had helped Zhouluo out once, earning Li Ximing’s rare approval. He wasn't in a hurry, so he paused to listen.

Li Xuanxuan stamped his way down the stairs, holding a staff. "Going to the flower boats again! I told you yesterday, age sixty is a life-and-death threshold! You must cultivate these last few levels of Qi Refining, whether you want to or not. You absolutely must break through!"

Zhouming’s talent wasn't exceptional, about on par with his older brother Zhoufang. Zhoufang had already stagnated, but Zhouming could still cultivate. That he didn't treasure this opportunity truly made Li Ximing frown. He paced forward silently, listening as Zhouming tried to curry favor:

"Not at all... not at all! Old Master, you misunderstand. There is a new play being performed on the painted barge, it’s about Yu Mugao... It’s rare to see such a bold drama! The family isn't short on those few talismans today! I invite you to watch it, sir. It's much better than just sitting stiffly in the courtyard..."

Li Xuanxuan was about to rebuke him when he suddenly spotted Li Ximing. His face lit up with joy, and he descended the steps. Zhouming, realizing his mistake, hurried forward to support him, only to hear a respectful voice call out:

"Grandfather!"

A platinum-gold figure had already moved first, supporting Li Xuanxuan down the steps. Zhouming immediately dropped to his knees with a thud, kowtowing.

"Greetings to the Daoist Master!"

Li Xuanxuan’s eyelids twitched, terrified that Li Ximing would become angry. He took a step forward and snapped, "Get back down and cultivate!"

Li Ximing watched with his hands clasped behind his back, showing no particular temper. He walked inside with Li Xuanxuan, and they sat down in sequence. But Zhouming refused to give up. Having finally gotten a rare chance to see Li Ximing, he shuffled forward on his knees, kowtowing at the courtyard entrance.

"Daoist Master... The Daoist Master's movements are unpredictable, you are so rarely seen... This junior waited at Gardenia Scenery Mountain for a long time, but the Daoist Master never appeared. Father... Father has not seen the Daoist Master in so very long!"

At the mention of Li Chengzhi, his eldest son who lacked a spiritual aptitude, Li Ximing’s demeanor turned cold. A servant brought tea. He accepted the cup, set it down, and said only, "What matter are you begging me for?"

Li Xuanxuan sighed, folding his hands into his sleeves. Zhouming began to weep.

"Father... Father’s health has been failing recently... He relies only on cultivators to extend his life, and I fear he does not have many years left. When the Daoist Master leaves, it is always for three or five years at a time. This junior... this junior only hopes that the Daoist Master might grace him with his immortal presence, to see my father just once!"

Li Ximing seemed to associate this with something else. He shifted his gaze away, staring down at the steps, and sipped his tea. Li Xuanxuan, however, softened considerably. He waved his hand.

"You are dismissed."

The boy retreated unwillingly, his red robes disappearing into the mountain pass. Li Xuanxuan said, "Even if that child is deficient in ten thousand ways, he is at least filial. His mind is also firm and decisive. He’s likable, and with you around, no one below dares to slight him..."

But Li Ximing shook his head. "Who *isn't* decisive? Look sideways, there is Li Chenghao. Look down, there is Zhoufang. There are many children in the primary branch; they all have their own opinions... What is difficult is maintaining one heart. Furthermore, occupying such a position, if he doesn't even have the chance to assail the Foundation Establishment Realm, then there is no need to indulge him."

"He was right about one thing, however. Grandfather, you should indeed watch some plays, listen to some songs, and labor less."

He seemed unaffected by the news of Li Chengzhi. He recounted the recent events, causing Li Xuanxuan to jump to his feet and sit back down repeatedly. Finally, the old man slumped into his chair, weeping tears of joy, his old tears streaming.

"The ancestors are truly protecting us! If not for Qinghong, I fear our family would have just become an Immortal Clan... only to fall straight to the bottom..."

The old man stroked his beard for a long time before finally composing himself. He said solemnly, "Only a few people need to know of this. It is not suitable for a wide announcement."

Li Ximing stood up and paced the courtyard. He hesitated for a long time. Ultimately, feeling that the lake was too close to the north, he decided against mentioning the True Monarch. Just then, a loud clap of thunder erupted, and a storm began to howl outside.

He sensed something. Taking a step forward, he gazed far to the north. He discovered that the gloomy weather was confined only to Jiangnan. The sky over Jiangbei was bright, glowing with a hazy red.

This red light shot straight to the heavens, scattering faint crimson radiance, like blossoms falling. The sound of thunder grew louder and louder. In an instant, Li Ximing’s form dissolved into Profound Light and reappeared on the northern bank.

He remained cautious, not even approaching the riverbank proper, yet he could see the hazy red light enveloping the entirety of Jiangbei. It stood in stark contrast to the violent storm over Jiangnan. A youth cloaked in flame stood in the clouds, emitting boundless radiance.

He held a longsword, pointing it arrogantly toward the firmament. The black-robed cultivator before him was trapped, immobilized by the roiling crimson light. A thunderous roar echoed through the sky:

"Hall of the Locust Soul! I truly have you to thank for this! I have achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm, and for all the humiliation I suffered before, I will repay it a hundredfold today!"

Hearing these words, a suspicion Li Ximing had long held was finally confirmed. He sighed heavily in his heart:

‘To make such a vicious vow just upon achieving Foundation Establishment Realm... To demand hundredfold repayment from the Hall of the Locust Soul all by himself... Who else could it be but that Great One?!’
