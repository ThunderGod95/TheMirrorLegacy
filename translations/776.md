# Chapter 776: Thunderstorm

After resting for some time to meticulously tend to her wounds, Li Minggong felt as though a great deal of time had passed before Li Chenghuai finally entered the hall. His expression was heavy, a complex mask of relief and worry.

“Elder Sister,” he began in a low voice, “Situ Mo has fallen. Word is the Family Head took action above Lake Xian. He first killed Situ Mo, claiming vengeance. Then, while facing six cultivators from Changxiao, he also slew Yunan Zi, forcing the Changxiao contingent to withdraw.”

Li Minggong immediately looked up, her expression flashing with vindicated hatred, only for it to be replaced by anxiety. “What happened next?”

“It is said he was received by members of the Cheng family,” Li Chenghuai replied, “and has retreated to Myriad Radiance.”

Li Minggong let out a visible sigh of relief, the weight in her heart lifting considerably. “As long as he escaped, that’s what matters. Both fronts are secure now. Just remind him, while he is out there... his priority is to preserve his life.”

Li Chenghuai nodded. Li Minggong coughed, then continued, “I cannot hold on much longer; I must enter seclusion soon. First, organize your brother's funeral rites. Don't let the elders bear too much of that burden. Afterward, I need you to watch over the family. Help them make the decisions. What... what are your intentions?”

Li Chenghuai immediately hesitated. “I wish to share the clan’s burdens,” he said. “But my father is the Master of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, and my mother is an immortal scion of the Azure Pond Sect. If I were to take charge, I fear it would not look proper... Our branch has always cultivated at Azure Pond. My appointment to Mount Qingdu was already an exception; there is no precedent for someone like me overseeing the prefecture's affairs or acting as the clan head.”

Li Xizhi was the Pavilion Master and highly regarded by the Si family; he was unequivocally an Azure Pond cultivator. The Yang family were also an imperial clan affiliated with Azure Pond. Li Chenghuai’s status was indeed sensitive. But Li Minggong had no one else to turn to.

She could only sigh. “Just manage things quietly. You don't need to be the public face. Now that things have settled, the other families won't move rashly. My only fear is that someone might use your status to drag Third Uncle into this, giving the Azure Pond Sect an excuse to interfere. With the clan’s Purple Mansion cultivators absent, we would be powerless to resist and would surely fall into a disastrous, muddled outcome.”

Li Chenghuai said softly, “Father was involved too deeply in the destruction of the Chi family. The True Monarch has not returned, and Chi Buzi is still out there, his fate unknown. This is precisely why Father and the Daoist Master decided against returning to the family... We must remain cautious.”

Li Minggong finally nodded. “This matter isn't insurmountable. After all, we still have Cui Jueyin. His cultivation is profound, his Dao attainment is deep, and his character and ability are both of the highest caliber. With him watching over the clan, nothing truly disastrous should happen.”

Just as they concluded their discussion, Qu Bushi appeared at the hall's entrance seeking an audience. Li Minggong quickly asked, “Have you found Ding Weizeng?”

Qu Bushi wore a strange expression and shook his head repeatedly. “Guan Lingdie of the Capital immortals Dao is here to see you.”

Li Minggong froze, hesitating for a moment before replying, “Then… let her come up.”

Li Chenghuai frowned, taking a step forward to stand beside his elder sister. Li Wen also hurried back, and the two flanked the injured woman protectively just as the lady in the colorful dress entered the hall.

Guan Lingdie had not come alone. The guest elders escorting her remained outside the hall; only Gongsun Bofan, still wearing his straw cloak, followed at her side. For once, the woman showed some propriety, stopping at a distance. Looking rather awkward, she offered a greeting that was half-soft, half-rigid:

“Greetings, Daoist Friend Li.”

“Daoist Friend...?” Li Minggong suppressed the exhaustion in her features, replying with her usual courteous tone. “What is this about?”

Guan Lingdie stated her purpose directly: “My sect has a Capital immortals Dao Bell currently in your esteemed clan’s possession. I am here today to exchange for it.”

Given how fickle and erratic the Capital immortals Dao had proven to be, Li Minggong had absolutely no intention of offending them now; reconciliation was the priority. She only said gently, “Daoist Friend, please speak your terms.”

The moment she said this, Guan Lingdie, who retained the temperament of a little girl, immediately dropped her defensive posture. Her tense body relaxed. “Years ago, during a sparring exchange, Situ Mo delivered one of your clan's guest elders to us. The Capital immortals Dao has provided him with good food and drink ever since. Now, we thought to return him, as a token of gratitude for the return of the Capital immortals Dao Bell.”

‘An Siwei...’

Relief flooded Li Minggong’s heart. She raised her eyebrows in hope. “Is this true?”

Guan Lingdie paused, then recited fluidly, “Many past frictions and misunderstandings were mostly instigated by the Profound Peak Gate or forced upon us by Changxiao. They were unavoidable circumstances...”

She continued speaking for some time. Li Minggong, noticing how smoothly the words flowed and realizing Guan Lingdie didn't seem like the sort of person who could formulate such a speech, surmised she had likely memorized it from Guan Gongxiao. She waited patiently until the woman finished, then retrieved the dark, lacquered bell from her sleeve.

“The Dharma Artifact is here,” Li Minggong said softly. “Please proceed.”

Guan Lingdie was overjoyed and quickly gave Gongsun Bofan instructions. He departed, and not long after, Qu Bushi returned. The old man warily circled Guan Lingdie before approaching Li Minggong and whispering:

“The Capital immortals Dao people below have released Guest Elder An. His aura is stable, and he appears unharmed. His previous wounds have all been healed.”

Li Minggong handed the artifact over. Guan Lingdie inspected it, sighed in relief, and without another word, departed on the wind.

A few breaths later, An Siwei finally entered the hall.

His aura was stable and his clothes were clean. The long spear was strapped to his back, looking identical to how he was when he left, save for one detail: his eyes were rimmed with red. In the span of merely a year or two, his face had aged significantly. Though he had no white hair, his entire bearing had decayed, worn down by an invisible weight.

The truth was, the Capital immortals Dao cared little for An Siwei. In Guan Gongxiao’s eyes, he was just trash who had relied on spiritual atmosphere and the Jade True lineage to luckily reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. They had nearly forgotten him in the dungeon. Yet for An Siwei, the internal struggle and anxiety had intensified daily, tormenting him relentlessly.

To now be exchanged for a peak-grade Dharma Artifact by the Li family was utterly sudden. Abruptly released, An Siwei still felt a deep unease. He bowed deeply. “Many thanks, my lady.”

As such an old veteran, An Siwei was treated more like a senior relative. Li Minggong urged him to rise. “Please go and rest. Minggong still has many affairs to handle and cannot keep you. The Old Master has been deeply worried; this counts as good news. Please, let him hear it.”

An Siwei bowed once more and quickly withdrew.

Li Minggong forced herself to stand, stepping down from the main seat. She stared somewhat blankly at the thunder rumbling in the sky above. “Brother Huai, go capture some of that lightning... seal it in a vial. It is time to inter it in the clan tomb.”

Li Chenghuai retrieved a small, dark copper vial from his sleeve. “I already captured some yesterday…”

Li Minggong sighed and followed him out of the hall. A young man was waiting by the main gate—golden-eyed, dark-haired, with a plain face. It was the Second Young Master, Li Jianglong.

Li Jiangqian had already passed down the necessary orders; the arrangements were complete. The group silently flew toward the lake.

They crossed the river. On the north bank, the Fei family had already hung white mourning gauze. Li Chenghui had defended the north bank for years, saving many members of the Fei family from the Floating Cloud Cave. He had spent most of that decade there, and the Fei family knew him well. The sounds of distant weeping carried on the wind.

Beyond the north bank, the entire lake island was draped in white. Despite Li Chenghuai’s request for simplicity, sheets of white fabric were everywhere. The area was shockingly silent, a quiet that held until they reached the main island settlement, where the air erupted with chaotic wailing.

The ceremonial hall was hung with white banners. On either side stood many respected elders, while youths and children knelt below. The spirit-coffin rested in the center, surrounded by low sobbing, awaiting the arrival of the symbolic remains.

Li Minggong, now changed into white mourning robes, stepped into the great hall.

The instant she appeared, the sound of grief detonated. Every last person began to howl. Those who had just been whispering or exchanging glances saw her and immediately began to wail at the top of their lungs, forcing out cries whether they had tears or not. The sheer spectacle of it caused Li Xuanxuan, standing in the center, to finally shed tears.

Before the coffin knelt a youth, crying with particular, agonizing grief. Li Minggong moved silently to the side as the spiritual item representing the bones was presented. Li Xuanxuan began to conduct the rites. The youth cried as if his world had ended, nearly fainting from the exertion.

Li Minggong waited for a long time. All eyes kept glancing toward her, clearly awaiting the announcement of the inheritance. She felt utterly sickened by the scene. She turned and went back outside the hall.

Only when the sun began to set did Li Chenghuai emerge with the Old Master. The three of them finally began their discussion.

Li Minggong still found the reality hard to accept, but the inheritance had to be settled to prevent future trouble. She suppressed her pain and asked quietly, “Younger Brother was unmarried, let alone had children. Treasures like the Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman must return to the clan treasury. But his other possessions—spiritual materials, his Foundation Establishment Dharma Artifact, his Qi Refining robes—they must all be passed down according to the laws of succession. They are immensely valuable. Are there candidates?”

Having managed Mount Qingdu, Li Chenghuai answered immediately. “Elder Brother had considered this. Having no son of his own, he thought of adopting the youngest son of one of his clan-brothers. However, the Old Master felt that since he was still young, he might have a natural-born son later, which would create conflict. So, he forbade it.”

No one could have imagined Li Chenghui would fall so soon. Li Xuanxuan, his tears spent, just clutched his sleeves and said nothing.

Li Minggong asked, “Who are the closest relations now?”

“There are three,” Li Chenghuai reported. “The first has the closest blood relationship: the young son of that clan-brother, the one originally intended for adoption. He is thirteen. He never once met Brother. He is the one you saw in the hall, crying himself to death. That clan-brother dragged the child here at dawn and forced him to kneel there, just to claim the position…”

Li Minggong’s brow furrowed in worry. “I thought that might be it... He cries too forcefully. I fear he is skilled at deception, feigning grief for appearances. If we allow such a one to inherit the lineage, I am afraid it will ruin our brother's good name.”

Li Chenghuai continued, “There are two others. The older one is also very close in blood. He is excellent in all respects, but he possesses a hot, straightforward temper. He was kneeling in the hall just now, but he did not cry.”

“The third is younger and more distantly related. But there was a time when he often visited Brother’s residence, and I heard Brother was quite fond of him... However, he is currently stationed at the East Bank defense and has not returned.”

Li Minggong was silent for a moment. “Looking at the scene in the hall, it seems most of this generation care only for their own small families and branches; even more care only for themselves. Very few look toward the clan as a whole. They behave like sect disciples. This sickness isn't unique to our family; the Xiao and Chen clans are the same. It is a common ailment of aristocratic clans.

“It is not technically wrong,” she mused, “but... secure the Dao lineage for these three. We will observe them all carefully in the coming years... only then will we speak of the inheritance.”

She hesitated, just as Li Xuanxuan spoke, his voice hoarse. “Gong’er... bring all three to the main island. Do not let them cultivate other ambitions out there. It will become ugly later.”

Both Li Minggong and Li Chenghuai nodded in agreement.

Just then, a slight commotion rose from below, followed by hurried footsteps in the corridor. A man in red robes arrived late, still pulling on white mourning clothes as he flew. His face was groomed to be rather handsome. The Old Master saw that face, and his heart turned to ice. His lips began to tremble.

Li Chenghuai glanced over. It was, as expected, Li Ximing’s direct grandson, Li Zhouming. He had been conspicuously absent earlier, and both Li Chenghuai and Li Minggong had tacitly avoided mentioning him. Now, the boy had walked directly into the line of fire.

“Bastard!”

Li Xuanxuan was, after all, a veteran of the ninth level of Qi Refining. The old man swept his sleeve, and an invisible force plucked Li Zhouming right out of the air. The young man had been trying to sneak into the crowd, never imagining the three highest authorities of the clan would be waiting at the entrance. He was terrified.

Trembling, he didn’t dare struggle, collapsing to his knees with a heavy thud.

“You... YOU!” Li Xuanxuan was overcome with grief and rage. “Your uncle died serving this clan, and you... the sheer audacity! You dare to arrive late for his funeral rites!”

As the direct grandson of a Purple Mansion cultivator, Li Zhouming was supposed to be a pillar of his generation alongside Li Zhouwei and Li Zhouluo. Instead, he had turned into this useless degenerate, a sight that made the old man’s vision darken.

The youth remained kneeling, the golden longevity lock Li Xuanxuan had gifted him at birth dangling and flashing brightly. His face was a mask of terror. He scrambled forward and grabbed Li Xuanxuan’s leg, wailing, “Old Master, don't be angry... please, don't be angry! Worry for your health!”

He wasn't ugly; in fact, he was rather refined and well-dressed. If he weren't groveling on the ground, he might even possess a certain dignity. But with his grandfather Li Ximing only recently missing, Li Xuanxuan couldn't truly strike him, and only stared with a frigid expression.

Li Minggong had always despised him. She turned her head away, refusing to watch as Li Zhouming pleaded with the old man.

‘Sigh…’

In the end, it was a funeral. Li Xuanxuan gave him a kick. “Get inside!”

Li Chenghuai, ever the diplomat, never commented on such matters and even offered the youth a few quiet words of admonishment.

Li Minggong merely nodded wearily, glancing back into the hall. The moment the three leaders had stepped out, the volume of the crying had instantly diminished, though many were still forcing desperate sobs. The sight filled her with disappointment. She couldn't help but mutter:

“I only fear that the ambition of our six generations... will ultimately be inherited by a pack of...”

“Minggong!”

The old man struck his wooden staff against the stone, cutting her off. Though Li Xuanxuan’s eyes were filled with tears, his voice was powerful and aged. “When a family grows this large... useless descendants are inevitable. They will cry here, and then they will go home... The island's selection process for talent remains clear and fair. Several in the Jiangque generation are quite promising. Do not speak such hopeless words.”

Li Minggong quickly nodded.

Li Chenghuai stood by silently, though he held his own thoughts back, sighing internally. ‘If not for Zhouwei, the Zhou generation would already show signs of exhaustion. And if not for Zhouwei producing good children... how many in the Jiangque generation would truly be presentable? The Old Master always prefers to see the bright side of things…’

The three fell silent. The rain in the sky grew heavier, churning the lake surface.

Suddenly, Li Minggong raised her eyebrows in astonishment, her gaze snapping toward the heavens. Her voice was raw. “Someone is breaking through!”

Li Chenghuai looked up as well, his expression one of immediate delight. He stepped forward, probing the shifting spiritual energy, and met his sister’s eyes.

“The Jing Dragon King!”

“Chen Yang! He has been in seclusion these few years and has finally broken through! It makes sense... he must have borrowed the power of the Inward Heart Surging Profundity.”

The lake surface rippled violently. Li Chenghuai nodded to his sister and soared into the air, vanishing into the storm. As expected, he saw a coiling, gray flood dragon rising above Mount Qingdu. It bared its fangs, its gaze fierce, its whiskers impossibly long.

A young man in black robes rode atop the dragon. He had broad shoulders, long eyebrows, and pupils the color of pale gray ash. His black hair whipped wildly in the downpour. He circled once before landing gracefully in front of Li Chenghuai. He smiled and clasped his fist.

“Greetings, my Lord!”
