# Chapter 889: Submission

Si Yuanli entered the mountain with a stern expression on his face and noticed that every family had sent people to the lake. However, aside from several obscure small families he had never heard of, only the Fei Family’s contingent was somewhat presentable.

However, the Fei Family members were being exceedingly humble, seemingly not having fared well in recent years. Si Yuanli sighed inwardly at the sight and didn’t spare them another glance.

Everyone bowed as a chorus of voices respectfully called out, "Greetings, Emissary!"

Under the watchful eyes of all, Li Xijun brought out the talisman and placed it flat on a jade plate so every clan could see it clearly. Li Qinghong received it first and said softly, "The Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman is here. We will return it to you first, Senior."

Si Yuanli sighed as he accepted the talisman, secretly inspecting it closely. He circulated his mana through it twice and confirmed it was genuine. He said apologetically, "Brother Xuanfeng stepped forward to preserve Jiangnan for my Azure Pond Sect. It is an unprecedented merit. Your family also suffered great losses of vital qi in this struggle; I have seen it all..."

His words were vague, but Li Qinghong shook her head and replied, "Before my second uncle perished, he said that Daoist Master Yuan Xiu saved him from Maha's hands, and prevented the traitor Tang from being offered to the Merciful One. He not only preserved the lord's life but also safeguarded our family's security. The favor is immense; fulfilling our duty is only right."

The two had not had much prior contact, and Li Qinghong had only spoken a single sentence when he had come to persuade them. Now that both had exchanged pleasantries, she feared Si Yuanli might say more about stepping forward.

So she lightly stepped aside and said softly, "Please."

Si Yuanli nodded, rode the clouds through the formation, glanced over Mount Qingdu, and said with a smile, "The immortal peak is serene, and isolated in the lake. It’s a fine place for cultivation."

Although Mount Qingdu was fairly decent among the peaks of Moongaze Lake, it was rather unimpressive in the eyes of a Purple Mansion Realm immortal descendant like Si Yuanli. He managed to force out a compliment before heading toward White Gauze Hall.

Everyone waited outside the hall as he went in to pay respects to Li Xuanfeng. When he came out, he wore a deeply sorrowful expression. A trusted aide of the Si Family stepped forward to support him, and the middle-aged man sighed, "The sect has suffered a major loss of vital qi, and now Xuanfeng is dead. The sect master is in seclusion, with no sign of when he’ll emerge. You and I held the demons at bay along the riverbanks, but we didn’t expect Chi Zhiyan and the others to vanish. Now we return with our people, yet we have no idea what to do next."

Si Yuanli’s time was indeed extremely limited; he could not afford to linger. As soon as the rites were complete, he immediately began to speak. The members of the Li Family all lowered their heads in silence, as if they hadn’t heard a thing.

Only Li Xizhi spoke softly, "You overthink things, my lord. Your achievements are clear to me and the other peak masters. With Master Yuan Xiu suppressing the sect, no petty man would dare stir trouble. Now that you return, all that remains is to reward merits and achievements..."

He exhaled and said solemnly, "As for matters of the upper sect and immortals, they should not be revealed before the noble clans. I ask that the Li Family be excused."

Li Xizhi’s words made Si Yuanli pause for a moment before he sighed. "You all stood with me defending the riverbank. We share the bond of comrades in arms... There’s no need for such formality..."

Li Xizhi, of course, refused and cupped his hands respectfully, "In times of sect unrest, you have returned triumphant. Though your prestige is well-earned, favoritism is inappropriate. We must still abide by the rules."

What a joke! The Li Family’s Foundation Establishment Realm strength was now ranked among the top families, and they had considerable achievements to their name. How could they possibly throw their entire family under Si Yuanli’s command just like that...?

Admittedly, the Li Family and Si Yuanli were naturally aligned in position, but the man had been on the lakeshore for less than fifteen minutes and hadn’t offered a single benefit. Li Xizhi had already shown enough goodwill and courtesy.

Si Yuanli was merely making a gesture; he had never expected others to pledge their entire households just because he spoke a few words. He walked out of the hall with Li Xizhi, saying warmly, "Xizhi, your cultivation has advanced swiftly. You once governed the marketplace and managed Green Pine Island, I’ve heard of your name long ago. It’s just a pity... alas... even Qingsui Peak has long voiced grievances on your behalf!"

Li Xizhi cupped his hands and replied, "Many thanks, my lord... But Qingsui Peak originally belonged to the Yuan Family. The sect had its reasons for arranging things as it did. The sect master compensated me with Changtian Peak, so consider it balanced."

"Oh?" Si Yuanli paused and glanced at Li Xizhi.

The elegant young man was composed as he said softly, "The Yuan Family, after all, is an ancient family with a long legacy, and has had ties with my family since the early days. In the end, it’s all about interests. There’s no need for conflict or enmity."

His words carried a subtle implication, stirring something in Si Yuanli’s heart. Stroking his beard, he thought to himself, It seems the Li and Yuan Families haven’t become completely hostile yet...

He’s right... How much favor has the Yuan Family really received from the Chi Family? They may lack standout figures, but the Mushroom Forest Plain is larger than an entire province. If we can draw them in along with the Li Family, that’s far better than making them enemies.

His eyes lit up, and he looked at Li Xizhi with newfound appreciation, thinking, A family that rose from such a harsh land within barely a century, with strict upbringing—of course they’d produce talented heirs... Good, good... this Li Xizhi will save me quite a bit of trouble!

Just as he was about to offer praise, a streak of light rapidly flew in from the distance. Only when it drew close did he see it was his own junior, Si Tongyi. The Li Family opened the formation to let him in. Si Tongyi landed beside him and stepped close, sending a whisper through a secret sound-transmission technique.

Si Tongyi’s lone arrival already made Si Yuanli’s expression shift slightly, but the words that followed made him turn grim, Li Yuanqin isn’t in Yi Mountain City... Chi Fubo has also vanished. Ning Hejing has mobilized all forces from Yuanxing Peak. I tried to fly over with the cloudliner, but he seized control of the Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner...

If not for Yuanxing Peak being understaffed due to years of inactivity, I might not have been able to leave the Azure Pond Sect at all... I fear we can’t afford any more delay!

"Ning Hejing..." muttered Si Yuanli.

The Chi Family had six branches. The brothers Chi Zhiyan and Chi Zhiyun were born of Chi Wei’s main line and were Purple Mansion Realm immortal descendants. They were always considered prime candidates for the sect master position. Meanwhile, Chi Fubo, whom Li Yuanqin was close to, belonged to the secondary branch, which, while competent, was not as strong.

Only those two lines had ancestors who reached the Purple Mansion Realm. The other four were not worth fearing. However, the main branch had nearly been wiped out in the north. Si Yuanli’s face grew darker as he listened.

Standing beside him, Li Xizhi seemed to sense something and said softly, "Since your lordship has finished the rites, it’s unwise to linger. Allow me to accompany you back to the sect and report in."

"Very well." Si Yuanli let out a deep breath, not even sparing time to bid farewell to Li Qinghong and the others, and said gravely, "With Xuanfeng’s passing, his great merits must be honored. I will return to the sect and deliberate on it thoroughly."

Several of them boarded the cloudliner and activated it with mana. They left streaks of white mist in the sky as they sped southward under the gaze of the crowd. The other peak masters followed behind and soon disappeared into the distance.

Si Yuanli had departed in such haste that he stayed for less than fifteen minutes. Li Xijun watched the large group of cultivators depart, silent and contemplative as his fingers rested on his sword hilt.

Li Qinghong moved to face him, and the young man spoke in a cool voice, "Aunt, the men we sent to fetch Uncle Yuanqin will likely return empty-handed."

He had immediately deduced from Si Yuanli’s unceremonious departure that something had almost certainly gone wrong at the Azure Pond Sect. No matter how fast the Li family moved, they couldn’t outrun the Si Family, and the result would inevitably be failure.

"The Azure Pond Sect reacts quickly."

Li Qinghong did the math. Though the demonic smoke in Jiangbei was slowly dissipating, the jade talismans tied to the lives of their guest cultivators had not yet shattered. The Azure Pond Sect’s soul lamps might be far more refined, but couldn’t be much faster.

It would have taken ten days for Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators to travel from the riverbank to Mount Azure Pond with intermittent flying. An ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator would need three days without rest, relying on pills to recover. Even the fastest escape spell user among the Li family, Li Qinghong, would still need a full day.

The message brought by the Si Family was at least a day old, meaning the Azure Pond Sect had taken action the day after, or even the same day, that Li Xuanfeng had slaughtered the Buddhist cultivators. In a world without transmission spells, that kind of speed was terrifying.

"Chi Zhiyun might have made arrangements." Li Xijun speculated briefly, then shook his head, "No matter what he planned, he couldn't have predicted things would deteriorate to this level... The last Purple Mansion Realm battle was at Moongaze Lake four hundred years ago."

The aunt and nephew returned to the peak, where Li Ximing was reading a letter. His brows had relaxed slightly. He placed the letter on the table and said, "Aunt, the Fei Family has arrived in full and is waiting respectfully at the riverside, requesting an audience."

"Hmm?"

Li Ximing’s words made Li Qinghong slightly raise an eyebrow. Li Ximing straightened his Daoist robe and met Li Xijun’s inquiring gaze, then nodded. "Almost certainly."

The three of them flew out together, and sure enough, they saw a densely packed crowd on the lakeshore. As the three descended from the sky, men and women alike lowered their heads and fell to their knees en masse with a rustle.

Li Qinghong landed at the front and saw an elderly man leading the group. His face was covered in ghastly bruises of a purplish hue, and his left hand was missing three fingers.

Upon seeing the trio, he bowed deeply and said respectfully, "Fei Tongyu of the Fei Family greets the three lords!"

Li Qinghong naturally recognized him from when she had trained in spear techniques at the Fei Family in her youth. Back then, Fei Tongyu had been elegant and refined. When she visited again after she had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, he had already begun to show signs of age.

Now, however, he looked startlingly horrific. Li Qinghong was taken aback but quickly understood the source of his injuries. Though he was indecisive, he had always been devoted to the family. Naturally, he wouldn’t have hidden behind the younger generation; he must have gone north himself.

Fei Tongyu bowed deeply, lifting his scar-covered hands high. He held up a jade plate that displayed a green seal and a storage pouch.

He said respectfully, "The Fei Family of Northern Shore Glacial Cloud, humbly prays for your grace and earnestly requests to become a subordinate household."

As Fei Tongyu knelt, the crowd behind him echoed his words loudly and in unison, "We humbly request to become a subordinate household!"

The shoreline erupted with thunderous voices, shaking the waters of the lake into turbulent waves. Members of other families looked up as three figures floated in the sky, Lightning flashed around the central figure, radiant brilliance to the left, and drifting frost and snow to the right.

Someone murmured softly, "Truly the bearing of an esteemed family."

"The Li Family's Foundation Establishment Realm strength has already surpassed the Jiang Family of old. This lake ought to bear the Li name now."

Within the mirror.

"Three strands of Metallic Essence; Mount Changhuai took one, Zipei took one, and one escaped."

The world remained calm, but a great battle raged on in Anhuai Heaven. Lu Jiangxian stood aside, watching everything clearly.

Mount Changhuai had dispatched four Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. As the strongest faction, they rightfully took one portion. The three Buddhist cultivators and Mahas had tied each other up in battle, giving Zhelu a chance to seize it. But as Zhelu emerged from Anhuai Heaven, he was promptly ambushed by Zipei, who had been lying in wait.

Zhelu clearly could have escaped with the Metallic Essence, but Anhuai Heaven’s formation was designed to target Buddhist cultivators. Getting in was already troublesome, and getting out even worse. Zhelu was then besieged by the other two Mahas and, caught between advance and retreat, had no choice but to surrender the treasure.

The final portion of Metallic Essence became the most fiercely contested among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. However, through a twist of fate, it ended up in the hands of Daoist Master Chengyan of Changxiao Gate, who was only in the early Purple Mansion Realm.

Though he had stepped into the Purple Mansion Realm years ago, he had made no progress since, spending his days in seclusion cultivating a single divine ability. How could he dare hold onto this hot potato? There was no joy in his heart, only fear...

Though his family's Daoist Master Changxiao was formidable, he had not come to Anhuai Heaven. Chengyan himself was not from some prestigious immortal family. When he saw the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators closing in on him, he gritted his teeth and sent the Metallic Essence beyond Anhuai Heaven. He would rid himself of the hot potato, and hope that Changxiao might be waiting in the Outer Heavens.

The moment he did this, the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators began cursing aloud, and they were forced to rush to the Outer Heavens to fight for it. Everyone except for the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master Hengli of the Hengzhu Dao Gate, who turned back to chase after Chengyan, swarmed outward.

Someone even cursed bitterly, "This is a disaster!"

But Chengyan had calculated correctly, Changxiao was indeed waiting in the Outer Heavens. Overjoyed at the sight, he was about to unleash his divine ability when suddenly a black alms bowl flew across and blocked him.

The Metallic Essence moved with such incredible speed that Changxiao missed it by a hair’s breadth. Once the True Essence, the Metallic Essence left Anhuai Heaven, it began to transform. At first, it was just a treasure being pursued by Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. After a few seconds, it expanded within the great void, turning into a radiant, shining golden stone.

Half of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators turned and fled immediately. The rest, either confident in their strength or clinging to hope, refused to give up. After another dozen seconds, the Metallic Essence transformed into a stone bird. It turned around and absorbed one early stage Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master. Already spent and drained of his divine powers, the Daoist Master was caught off guard and devoured in a single gulp.

And so, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators could only scatter in all directions, curses against Daoist Master Chengyan erupting from all sides. Meanwhile, the stone bird, having developed a taste for flesh, turned around, laughing wildly, to chase and devour more people. Fortunately, the creature was clearly unnatural. After licking its beak in lingering hunger, it soon vanished.

Lu Jiangxian thoroughly enjoyed the spectacle. Once he returned to the mirror world and fell into deep thought, he took out the Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence and pondered silently, If this thing were to descend into the world, it would surely be something terrifying... That Daoist Master Chengyan of Changxiao Gate probably won’t dare show his face for the next hundred years.

Standing among the clouds, he suddenly raised his head as if sensing something. The layered mists parted in the sky, and a sparkling stream of light flew toward him from afar, coming to rest before him.

The talisman seed glimmered faintly with golden light. He picked it up, finding the mana within it to be extremely thin. It was barely at Qi Cultivation Realm.

"Xuanfeng..."

Li Xuanfeng had expended nearly all his cultivation, leaving little behind. Yet in contrast, the talisman seed was filled with an incredibly dense and alluring store of fate, all tightly bound within it.

When Li Xuanfeng had taken the Human Pill, the talisman seed should have extracted all his cultivation and detached itself. But Lu Jiangxian had forcibly suppressed it. During the battle on the riverbank, when Li Xuanfeng drew on mana, it was Lu Jiangxian again who restrained the talisman seed, allowing him to accomplish his task and then retreat.

Upon Li Xuanfeng’s death, his fate should have dissipated with him. But talisman seeds had never followed reason. They wouldn’t yield what they didn’t want to, yet when taking, they took everything. It had consumed all his fate and brought it back into the mirror.

Lu Jiangxian silently gazed at the talisman seed, sighing inwardly, He had resolved to die long ago!

Li Xuanfeng had already made his resolution to die the moment he took the Human Pill. He had simply been waiting for the right moment. He simply wanted to take down a few more enemies before he fell.

"Taking Eighteen Master Monks with him... that fulfilled a hero’s ambition," muttered Lu Jiangxian.

He held the fate-rich talisman seed but did not absorb it into himself immediately. Instead, he hesitated.

There was no other reason. The mirror was currently stuck at this stage. Without a breakthrough into the Purple Mansion Realm and feedback from his divine ability, it would only slightly enhance the strength of his profound light at most.

"That would be far too wasteful," muttered Lu Jiangxian.
