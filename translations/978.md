# Chapter 978: The Chamber of Doubt

Li Zhouwei put away the items. After reading the jade slip, he finally understood that the jade gourd in his hand contained the 'Mystic Banquet Nectar' of the Upper Rite. The 'Bright Heart Feast' of the Essence-Gathering Profound Origin Art required 'Mystic Heart Essence Qi,' which could be extracted from this gourd.

'This could be a chance to revitalize a Dao lineage.'

A thought then sparked a question in his mind.

"Treasured Vase... Merging Nine... Back then, when Changxiao pursued my grand-uncle, he left a powerful spell art on him called the Sangyu Merging Nine Profundities Art. There's also the Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art..."

"Changxiao's rise began in an Encompassing Profundity Daoist Tradition somewhere in the Eastern Sea. It's Encompassing Profoundity again. There's a very high chance it's closely tied to the Daoist Tradition here... If I can find some clues from this, things might get a little easier down the line."

With this realization, he grew inwardly cautious.

"Since Changxiao comes from an Encompassing Profoundity background, he'll be like a fish in water in Wanling Heaven. He couldn't possibly miss this place. He's within this Heaven, and he's a cunning person, so I must be on my guard..."

As he left the cave dwelling, he scanned his surroundings. He felt a sense of pity. Everything within Clear Rite Peak was a good treasured artifact. Although he didn't care for them, if he were to take them and set them up, it would be enough to give his own family a cultivation ground of the highest standard.

After a final glance, he dismantled the golden-character screen dharma artifacts on both sides of the cave dwelling. With a flick of his finger, he detached the two spiritual cabinets as well. He quickly gathered them, not wasting any time, and exited the cave dwelling at top speed.

The sky and earth within this heaven were a brilliant gold. He changed direction and headed east. After a hundred-li sprint, his gains dwindled. The area was a mess. Many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had already taken the treasures, smashing the cave dwellings etched with Daoist principles and cultivation techniques. The beautiful immortal palaces and celestial pavilions were now scattered ruins, with billows of spiritual smoke and only streaks of multicolored light soaring through the air.

He feigned a search, but in reality, he was secretly using his Spirit Probe ability. Everything before his eyes constantly blurred, revealing the wonder of the Heaven and Earth's confining and collecting properties. It was like a thin veil draped over the ground, yet one particular area showed a gradual fading of color.

'This...'

He observed for a while, then followed the path forward. All the while, he activated his Heavenly Light, putting on a show of searching. As he drew closer, he saw a high platform made of silver.

On the platform stood a dilapidated ceremonial gate. The three-door, four-pillar structure was still faintly discernible. It was carved with intricate bas-reliefs, with patterns flowing from top to bottom, incorporating water, fire, earth, and wood. The central gate was the tallest, but it had been so badly damaged, as if it had been scoured by a divine ability, that the patterns were unrecognizable. It was covered in sharp sword marks.

These sword marks held a profound, ancient aura. They clearly weren't made by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who had entered. Each mark still emanated a heart-stopping power. Li Zhouwei paused for a moment, his spiritual sense picking up something.

'The divine wonder of the Heaven and Earth's confining and collecting... seems to have weakened here. And by this ceremonial gate, it's almost as if it's completely gone...'

Li Zhouwei took a step forward and closed his eyes slightly. As the suppressive force weakened, the range of his spiritual sense expanded considerably. Upon closer inspection, he could faintly connect with the boundless, pitch-black and tranquil Great Void.

'As expected, it's an exit!'

Before this Heaven opened, the suppressive force must have been much thicker. It was only now that it was possible to enter or leave...

He made a mental note of this location so he could use it as an escape route in the future. He didn't linger, continuing his flight. He sped up, his gaze constantly sweeping the ground, secretly operating his Spirit Probe. He sensed an anomaly ahead and approached it silently.

Soon, he saw a divine ability erupting, carrying a rolling, brownish-yellow light that streaked through the air, leaving a trail of dust. It was a Profound-Guarding Spirit Statue.

This particular Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, dressed in a black robe, looked young. He was a cultivator of unknown origin. Judging by his attire, he was likely a Daoist Master from the Outer Sea who had come to Jiangnan specifically for this Heaven.

What drew Li Zhouwei's focus, however, was the Profound-Guarding Spirit Statue, which was much larger and more powerful than the one at Xinhu Palace. It looked exceptionally fierce. Li Zhouwei simply circled around it and left, not wanting to meddle. With a flash of his golden eyes, he took advantage of the cultivator distracting the statue and headed directly toward the direction he came from. After flying for a while, he did indeed begin to sense a fluctuating spiritual energy in the air. His heart secretly rejoiced.

'Just as I thought... it's the same as Xinhu Palace. The key locations must have a spiritual statue guarding them. That Daoist Master must have gotten a treasure and was fleeing from this direction!'

'The smaller places have mostly been picked clean... the good stuff still needs to be fought for!'

He sped on. As he got closer to the location, he felt the Heaven and Earth's confining and collecting wonder suddenly increase by a level, reaching the same intensity as the one he felt at Xinhu Palace. Thick black light and dark clouds appeared in the distance.

Unlike Xinhu Palace, this place was engulfed in a terrifying downpour. The sky was pitch black, devoid of any light. Every drop of rain was a thick, greenish-blue color, making a sharp sizzling sound as it struck the dharma bodies.

The torrents of rain made him look up. His spiritual sense moved, and his heart instantly understood.

"The Pristine Water surging with Clear Dusk Rain... there's an artifact of Pristine Water here, most likely!"

The endless azure rain almost obscured all light. The ground below had also become a vast ocean, with remnants of broken walls and dilapidated structures faintly appearing and disappearing on the water's surface, emitting a weak glow.

He didn't need to use his Spirit Probe. He simply activated his golden eyes, seeing through the Clear Dusk Rain and taking in the entire situation.

"Hmm?"

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow slightly, thinking to himself.

'An old acquaintance is here!'

Within the churning Pristine Water light, a person was flying, fighting and retreating. This person was clad in a dark blue dharma robe, with a small face and a slightly pointed chin, giving him a handsome, spirited look. His body was bolstered by a divine ability woven with purple light. It was none other than Daoist Master Yehui!

This Daoist Master had defected to the North, and he seemed to be doing quite well for himself these past few years. He was now standing in the rain, steering the purple water, holding a luminous, round pearl. Although he was fighting three others, he seemed relaxed and not at all flustered.

In contrast, the other three Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who had been chasing him were hesitating, already showing signs of retreat.

Just as Li Zhouwei was about to grip his Grand Ascension halberd, a powerful white light erupted from the distant rain. A stream of light broke through the churning, greenish-blue ruins and shot up into the sky!

The white light shimmered like a flowing waterfall. Even the obscuring Clear Dusk Rain couldn't block that blinding white light. Just by its appearance in the air, various brilliant auras rained down, causing the mist to disperse and the Pristine Light to recede.

"A Spiritual Artifact!"

And following closely, also breaking out of the rolling Pristine Water, was another person. She was clad in a python robe, short in stature, and her body was surrounded by a surging white light. She wore a triumphant smile as she raised her hand and fiercely snatched the blinding white light into her palm!

It was Zong Chang of the Great Zhao Dynasty!

This person's appearance made Li Zhouwei silently raise an eyebrow.

'A Veiled Yin cultivator, a Buddhist... a junior disciple of Taixi... a natural enemy then!'

He silently added this person to his list of enemies. He raised an eyebrow and looked at the white light. With a blink of his golden eyes, the light gradually faded, revealing intricate patterns. He understood what he was seeing.

'It's a restriction. It should contain various treasures. I'll take a look with Spirit Probe.'

Although Zong Chang's face was filled with joy, there was no hesitation. She immediately activated her Yin Qi and sped away, leaving a luminous white trail behind her. At the same time, she turned and fiercely waved a sleeve at the figures behind her.

Immediately, a torrent of white energy poured out, transforming into various white prisms, multicolored but with a biting coldness. The man behind her, with a dark expression, wore a robe of dark-colored feathers and a jade gourd at his waist. He was stepping on a misty golden fog as he sneered,

"Zong Chang! How unprincipled!"

The white prisms rushed at him, causing him to instantly raise a hand. A surging golden aura rippled out, swallowing all the white light and constantly dissolving it. The woman smiled alluringly.

"Unprincipled? So what! You're just a demonic cultivator from the Outer Sea who got a foothold in Jiangbei through the Golden Feather Sect. How dare you lecture me about principles!"

The golden and yin energies clashed, exploding into a brilliant cascade of light in the air. But then another person soared out, clad in a gauze robe, with a pure and innocent face. She was stepping on surging Valley Water. This made Li Zhouwei slightly stunned.

It was Daoist Master Xiang Chun!

She was one of the first few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators Li Zhouwei had met. She was the mistress of Changliu Mountain and the woman of Dongfang Lieyun, the Dragon King of the Beihai Sea. She was no simple character!

Daoist Master Xiang Chun stood in the air, a treasured pearl appearing behind her, scattering Valley Water light. She finally spoke, her voice cold and clear.

"Friend, you should see if you have the ability to take everything for yourself first!"

Zong Chang's expression changed subtly. She didn't react to the threat, but instead gave her a slightly provocative look, saying,

"Ah, the Dragon King of the Beihai Sea's 'madam'."

A woman's insult to another woman always hits hardest. This phrase made Daoist Master Changyun's expression change slightly. The watching Purple Mansion cultivators secretly clicked their tongues. Daoist Master Xiang Chun's face changed drastically. She said in a deep voice,

"You..."

After reaching the Purple Mansion Realm and forging a divine ability, the dharma body is a condensation of that power and can be male or female. Aside from the Maha cultivators in the North who enjoy changing back and forth, claiming they have seen through the physical world, most Purple Mansion Realm cultivators retain their original gender and appearance. However, Daoist couples at this level are still rare, with most unions occurring within sects. Such relationships between humans and demons are not mentioned openly, but everyone holds some reservations about them.

The true wife of the Dragon King of the Beihai Sea was also Dragon-kin. Although she had no territory, she was a proper, dignified Dragon. This phrase, "Dragon King of the Beihai Sea's 'madam'," was both a precise insult and a source of extreme embarrassment for Xiang Chun!

For a moment, various divine ability lights intersected, but Zong Chang was well-prepared. She threw open her sleeve, revealing a thousand-hundred illusions.

Yin Grand Three Palaces Enchanting Light

This light was murky and malevolent, like a clouded moon. A thousand-hundred sinister auras, hinting at scenes of withering plants and copulating beasts, created a maddening divine ability that severed dharma power, causing the two in front of her to halt.

But how could Changyun be ordinary? The light in his eyes flared, and the gourd at his waist bobbed slightly, as if being blown on. A turbulent golden wind, capable of pulverizing bone and reducing flesh to ash, emerged from it, blowing away the Yin Grand Three Palaces Enchanting Light.

Daoist Master Xiang Chun was equally formidable. The treasured pearl behind her spun, releasing a clear, lustrous light that swept away the bewilderment. Zong Chang knew they were not to be trifled with and never expected a single Yin Grand Three Palaces Enchanting Light to stop them. She used the momentary delay to activate her divine ability.

'The Chamber of Doubt'!

A cold, yin aura billowed behind Zong Chang, spontaneously creating a mysterious palace. The main hall and side wings were complete, with a courtyard in the front and a sundial at its very center.

The woman fell into the depths of the palace, as if plunging into an endless darkness. She vanished, disappearing completely with the 'Chamber of Doubt' into the rolling Pristine Water.

Changyun sneered. With a gentle shake of his hand, a mysterious mirror slipped from his sleeve.

"Where do you think you're going!"

The mysterious mirror released a brilliant light, layer after layer, a total of sixteen streams. They swept through the downpour like white chains, searching everywhere. Suddenly, a jolt was felt in the distance, revealing a streak of Veiled Yin white light.

Before the two could act, Zong Chang's head snapped up. She shrieked,

"Who!"

The Pristine Water Clear Dusk Rain parted to both sides. A golden halberd tore through the air, carrying Heavenly Light and colorful clouds, and struck the Veiled Yin white light first.

"Boom!"

Zong Chang's reaction was swift. A pair of long shuttles, about a foot long and as slender as silver daggers, appeared in her hands. She held them up and blocked the strike!

Veiled Yin and Bright Yang were inherently in opposition and could inflict damage on each other. For a moment, the light and dark energies separated. The Pristine Water rippled, and the scorching light illuminated Zong Chang's face, making her grit her teeth.

"Li... Zhou... Wei!"

"Clang!"

The Grand Ascension halberd twisted, causing white smoke to billow from Zong Chang's shuttles. This woman, who had been nourished by the Great Zhao court for many years, had a formidable cultivation technique and powerful strength. She managed to block the Grand Ascension halberd and exhaled a puff of white energy.

Before the white energy could change, the power of Attachment suddenly activated. The golden light leaped up, the halberd sweeping through the white energy and piercing toward her eyes!

"Hah!"

Zong Chang let out a sharp cry. The skin on her face stretched and tore open, turning into a thousand-hundred empty holes from which white energy surged out. It revealed a skeletal form beneath her beautiful skin, her flesh turning into a swarm of white bees that scattered like the wind.

A torrent of golden sand swept in. Changyun had already arrived before her!

Changyun now had two divine abilities. Xiang Chun was a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Although Xiang Chun's Daoist Tradition wasn't specialized in combat, she was still troublesome enough. Earlier, Zong Chang had wanted to take everything for herself, relying on the wonder of her divine ability for movement, but with too many enemies... it was a dangerous game.

Now, with the addition of the White Qilin Li Zhouwei, who also had two divine abilities, Zong Chang knew that even if she won, it would be a pyrrhic victory. Without any hesitation, she immediately gathered her divine ability, gently raised her hand, and flung the ball of white light at the rushing Changyun!

Changyun's expression was grim.

Among the three, his cultivation was only slightly higher than Li Zhouwei's, but when it came to a fight, he wasn't at all confident he could win against this White Qilin. He even secretly made an estimate.

'He's a mortal White Qilin. It's not an exaggeration to consider him a three-divine-ability cultivator... Xiang Chun isn't good at fighting. In a one-on-one fight, without using the trump cards given to her by the Dragon-kin... she might not be a match for him!'

While he, Changyun, had his own trump cards, so did others. His own strength might even be the lowest among them. Faced with the heavy treasure thrown at him by the enemy, he showed no hesitation or greed. The surging golden wind passed over it without mercy.

A flicker of regret crossed Zong Chang's eyes.

'How cautious. It seems it's impossible to take everything for myself now!'

"Boom!"

A blinding white light erupted, so powerful that even the surrounding Pristine Water Clear Dusk Rain was unable to stop it. It dispersed the clouds and mist, causing people in the vicinity to turn their heads. The hidden Purple Mansion Realm cultivators also silently revealed themselves, casting greedy glances.

"Clang!"

As expected, several streaks of multicolored light flew out from the center. They were full of life, dragging colorful trails behind them, each streaking off in a different direction. The four closest cultivators' expressions all changed. They simultaneously flew up, each lunging toward one of the streaks!

Li Zhouwei seemed to choose randomly, flying up on a streak of Heavenly Light, but his gaze was already fixed on one of them.

This object was filled with brilliant, multicolored light, like water and like gold, swirling like a rainbow. It constantly changed its form in the air, with faint traces of Cinnabar and mercury emerging and interchanging within it, seemingly containing the philosophical essence of various Transformations—it was a Whole Pill Spiritual Artifact, a rare treasure in the world today!
