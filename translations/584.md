# Chapter 907: Moongaze Li Family

Li Xijun had remained on the peak for several months as the formation on the lake gradually neared completion. He sat within the hall, reading the Law of the Sexagenary Cycle Sword Manual while Li Qinghong sat with her eyes closed in silent concentration. She was holding the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens in meditation.

She had long since refined these six silver command tokens. Their six streaks of silver radiance had merged into one, forming a misty silver halo in her palm. Thunder rumbled faintly within them, giving them an aura of profound mystery.

The Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens were excellent dharma artifacts, but they hailed from a bygone era, when spell arts still retained elements of formation techniques and shamanic arts. Li Qinghong had limited innate talent in either path, making her study of them quite arduous.

But she was never one to shy from difficulty. She simply held the token and focused her spirit.

On the other side, Li Ximing sipped from a teacup while flipping through a pill manual. Aside from one line of inheritance from the Xiao Family, he did not possess a truly distinguished pill dao legacy. His progress in the field had long since stagnated, and he was merely passing the time.

He had been summoned by Li Xijun early that morning. The date of ascending the island was nearing, and coincided with an ancestral rite, so it was a significant occasion that he could not possibly miss.

After a long moment of thought, Li Qinghong slowly opened her eyes and said softly, "Jun’er, have you invited their family to witness the ceremony?"

Li Xijun promptly replied, "The unification of Moongaze is a joyous event, but it should not be overly publicized. Of the Three Sects and Seven Gates, we only invited Senior Kong Tingyun from Profound Peak Gate, and sent envoys to Mount Yu and Xianyou. As for the Xiao Family, they’ve sealed their mountain, so we’re not sure if we can reach them."

He added in a quiet voice, "Inviting Senior Kong Tingyun serves two purposes. First, we can discuss the matter of the northern shore, and second, we can inquire about affairs in the Eastern Sea."

All three in the hall knew full well what affairs in the Eastern Sea referred to. It concerned the cultivators from Changxiao Gate, which was a source of much consternation for the Li Family. After all, they were Daoists of the immortal sect, and it was impossible to simply kill or rob them. No matter what, some form of negotiation would be necessary.

As he was speaking, a guard outside the hall reported that Li Chengliao had arrived to deliver his report.

"Let him in."

Li Xijun set down the jade slip in his hand as the man entered. Li Chengliao had already removed his heavy cloak. His pleated robes were also black and red, but in a darker shade. A sash was tied at his waist, and he wore a white outer robe. All in all, he looked quite neat and sharp.

Li Xijun had always been someone with a keen eye for detail. Just a few days ago, he had taken note of the indigo ceremonial robe worn by Li Chenghuai.

Now, seeing that Li Chengliao wore the same formal design, he relaxed his grip on the jade slip and said pleasantly, "It seems our family’s new fashion is these pleated ceremonial robes. They certainly have a refined air about them."

Li Chengliao had just finished paying respects to the three Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the hall. He hadn't expected Li Xijun to take notice of such a detail, and broke out in a cold sweat.

He bowed and replied, "Uncle, the family has grown considerably in recent years, and with the many peaks and branches, the daily wearing of long robes, though elegant, lacks proper form. When we receive guests from the various esteemed families, especially from Jiangbei and beyond, they more often wear pleated garments, which are much more orderly than flowing robes..."

He offered repeated explanations, clearly uneasy.

It wasn’t that Li Xijun was overly strict; it was the Li Family’s own laws that were notoriously harsh. The family was known for oppressing its own branches and strictly disciplining the direct line. Even indulging in luxury could be considered a crime. The more closely related one was to the direct lineage, the more they were scrutinized. Over the years, many had fallen into the hands of the family chief’s court.

His father, Li Xicheng, had led by example. When he died, his last words were 'Our family has no excess wealth,' which had been recorded in the family’s history. Li Chengliao could not bear for Li Xijun to misunderstand and tarnish his father’s legacy.

"It’s fine." Li Xijun nodded. "Being orderly isn’t a bad thing. Draft a proper regulation for attire. Once that’s settled, it’ll save us a lot of trouble in the future."

He furrowed his brows inwardly. The family rules were indeed too strict, if even the family head Li Chengliao was this afraid. He added a word of caution, "Set a clear line in the family chief’s court as to how far the privileges of each branch’s disciples may go. We may be strict, but our kin should not be wronged without cause."

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly in agreement beside them. Li Chengliao acknowledged the order and produced a jade slip, reporting, "The western shore has been fully reorganized. There are fifty-seven families in total, with fourteen Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, thirty-one small peaks and valleys, thirty-two towns, and more than six hundred and ten thousand people."

He placed the jade slip with the records on the desk and asked doubtfully, "The minerals on the western shore had all been sent away for artifact forging, leaving the region poor as barren land. We found very few spirit items; seven families didn’t even have a single one among them. Yet, we uncovered three hundred and eighty-seven cultivation manuals, with only seven being for Qi Cultivation Realm. The number of Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques exceeds the combined total of the other three shores!"

Li Xijun had already heard the inside story from Li Xizhi and wasn’t surprised. He nodded and said, "It was a remnant from the Golden Feather Sect. I’m aware of it."

Li Chengliao relaxed and continued, "Nine Gates Peak has average spiritual qi. Three other peaks are also usable. The western shore could support four prefectures to govern the various families."

Li Xijun examined the records closely. Aside from Nine Gates Peak, which specialized in artifact forging, only the six hundred thousand people and the three hundred cultivation manuals held any real value. The spirit fields there were scarce. Naturally, nothing of note was left.

After checking the time, he had Li Chengliao wait to the side and read through the jade slip carefully. Then, rising to his feet, he addressed Li Qinghong, "Aunt, after a hundred years, the four shores of the lake are now in our family's hands."

He declared loudly, "Our Li Family currently has nine hundred and seventeen Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, one hundred and eighty-five with various unrefined qi, thirty-one in the Qi Cultivation Realm, and six in Foundation Establishment Realm.

"The western shore’s four prefectures hold six hundred and ten thousand people. The southern shore, including Mount Yue and West Pool, has one million and two hundred thirty thousand people. Wutu, Lijing, and Huaqian prefectures together hold eight hundred and ten thousand people. The eastern forest’s vital qi has yet to recover, but still contains five hundred and ninety thousand people. Lastly, the northern mountainous region holds three hundred and twenty thousand people.

"A grand total of three million and five hundred sixty thousand people!"

Li Xijun added an explanation in a soft voice, "The forest has fertile plains, and is the most bountiful region around the lake. Though years of war have left its population sparse, with a few decades of cultivation, exceeding two million inhabitants won’t be a problem."

Li Qinghong finally showed a hint of joy and responded with a soft sound. Li Xijun handed her a jade slip and continued, "The prefecture and peak system has now been reorganized. We have five prefectures and one mountain in the Eastern Milin Prefecture; four prefectures under Nine Gates in the west; and five prefectures in the southern former lands. The Fei Family governs five peaks through two prefectures in the north, while Qingdu and Yuting each form their own independent units. In total, sixteen prefectures, two peaks, and one mountain are all accounted for."

He drew out a map from his sleeve, with Moongaze Lake roughly oval in the center and a slight dip in the south. The sixteen prefectures were neatly divided and labeled in fine script.

Li Qinghong studied the map for a while, her heart gradually settling. She glanced at the others present and asked softly, "Has the island at the heart of the lake been given a name?"

"Not yet." Li Xijun shook his head. He didn’t care much for naming and thought continuing to call it the island at the heart of the lake would be fine.

But Li Qinghong smiled gently and said warmly, "A name like this is not without weight."

Though her voice was gentle, her feathered robe and silver spear gave it a subtle authority. She said softly, "Our family has spent a hundred years on this lake. All four bloodlines have advanced one after another, giving their all. But it was two individuals who laid the foundation of our dominion. First, Uncle Xiangping, and later, my father.

"This island will eventually be reshaped by moving mountains, raising its geomantic lines to rise above the water. We might as well call it Pingya Island."

Li Xijun nodded lightly. At that moment, Li Chenghuai stepped forward to report, respectfully glancing at Li Chengliao before speaking, "The grand formation on the lake, the Pure Essence Harmonization Formation, has been established. I have sent the formation masters back, and the cost came to two hundred and twelve spirit stones."

An ordinary Qi Cultivation Realm formation typically cost a little over a hundred spirit stones, but the island was simply too vast, requiring over two hundred. Fortunately, the family had not paid tribute in recent years and had ample reserves. Even after funding this formation, they still had over two hundred spirit stones remaining.

Li Xijun nodded and had him wait to the side. After another fifteen minutes, An Siwei entered the hall and bowed, reporting respectfully, "The great boats are ready. All the branches are boarding from Lijing, Huaqian, and Huazhong, heading to the island."

After An Siwei finished speaking, Li Qinghong rose from the main seat and descended the steps slowly. "Go and invite the elders and lords. Moongaze is now unified, it’s time to ascend the island."

Lijing Town.

The lakeside dam bustled with activity as the great ship docked at the shore. Bathed in sunlight, it cast a wide shadow that enveloped the crowd below. Everyone on the ground looked up at it.

An old man stood before the ship, extending his one remaining arm. His aged face was relaxed as he watched the people boarding. Cultivators nearby were all busy seeing others off, but no one urged him.

It was only when everyone had boarded that a white-robed cultivator descended from the sky on a breeze. He carried a spear on his back, and his striking features made him stand out.

Landing on the ship’s prow, he cupped his hands toward the old man and greeted, "Elder Qiuyang!"

Li Qiuyang waved his one arm, signaling An Siwei not to fuss. He gave a slow smile and said in a hoarse voice, "Your father is due to return from the desert around now. It’s a good occasion for a reunion."

An Zheyan’s punishment hadn’t been severe. He had merely been sent to the desert, and the fine of spirit stones and spirit paddies had been burdensome but not crippling for the An Family. An Siwei nodded respectfully, clearly pleased.

The two spoke for a while before a few cultivators aboard the ship approached to greet them. They were originally there to report to An Siwei, but upon recognizing him, they became especially courteous.

"So it's the elder!"

Li Qiuyang stroked his beard with his single arm. Though he seldom spoke, his status was by no means low.

Each of Li Qiuyang’s wounds had a story. They were injuries from the market, strikes from devil cultivators, and scars from subduing demons. Every one of them was the result of loyal service to the family. He had lost his arm to Merging Fire while intercepting Xu Xiao. An Siwei understood all this well and stood respectfully at his side.

The sail rose, and the ship headed out onto the lake. Li Qiuyang stood up and looked over the railing. Three streaks of light flashed across the sky in succession.

He chuckled quietly and said, "I remember patrolling this lake with Uncle Tongya. Back then, the area was shrouded in thunder and fire. The Yu and Fei Families were at their peak, and both had Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators overseeing things. How mighty they seemed!

"Yu Mujian even dared to provoke Uncle Tongya publicly. The Yu Family only showed our family courtesy because of the Sword Immortal's face. Who would have imagined we’d see a day like this!"

The old man had seen much in his time and remembered every perilous moment along the way. Among all those boarding the island, he was unexpectedly the most emotional. When the great ship finally docked and he saw the lush grass and fertile land, he turned and laughed, "What a fine island this is!"

An Siwei dispatched attendants and followed him closely onto the island. Overhead, a woman in Xiang-style robes rode a golden mountain through the sky, leaving a trail of brilliance.

The old man said with a sigh, "There are several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the sky... Boy from the An Family, take a look and tell me who they are."

His aged eyes were sharp and he could instantly tell that the figures above were no ordinary cultivators. But An Siwei didn’t have the knowledge to identify them by family, so he said softly, "Our family only invited the Xiao Family and the Profound Peak Gate. As for those Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators' true identities, I too am unsure.

"Judging by her Xiang-style robes, that female cultivator might be from Profound Peak Gate."

Li Qiuyang let out a quiet oh of acknowledgment. When he saw a tall platform within the island, he shuffled over to its base. An elder in gray-blue robes rose on the wind to greet him. A sword hung at his waist, and he appeared silent and reserved.

"Donghe!" Li Qiuyang called out, and Chen Donghe nodded silently before leading him inside.

Just then, Li Xijun descended on drifting snow with two others in tow and greeted softly, "Honored elders."

Before he could finish, a middle-aged woman stepped forward from behind him and said quietly, with a trace of melancholy, "Father!"

Chen Donghe quickly raised his head to look and stood frozen for three full breaths before he murmured, "Qingxiao..."

The woman before him, now in the late stage of Qi Cultivation Realm, was none other than his daughter, Li Qingxiao. In his memory, she had still been a child, but now, she had passed fifty.

Father and daughter stood in a daze at their reunion. Li Qingxiao pursed her lips, and the young man behind her stepped forward. His eyes were bright and spirited, and his cultivation had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm.

He bowed and said respectfully, "Greetings, Grandfather. I am Muyun."

Chen Donghe didn’t recognize him at all, but he understood that this Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was Li Qingxiao’s son. He responded with a couple of dry, stiff words. Li Xijun stepped in with a few words to ease the mood and led the group up the ceremonial platform.

Li Qiuyang remained visibly emotional. As a clan elder of the Li Family, he naturally had a place of honor at the high platform during the ritual. Watching as two demonic creatures were dragged up in chains to await the ceremony, he thought to himself, This marks our first year on the island, our family traditions are continuing!

Li Qinghong stood atop the platform, observing the two creatures being dragged into place with a faint smile of satisfaction. Below her, Li Chengliao had just finished the ceremonial rites and was now lifting a jade blade.

As far as the ritual went, this year’s was not especially grand. Many of the Radiant Lure generation had fallen, and the children of the Crimson Palace generation had not yet come of age. As in past years, they had only procured a few Qi Cultivation Realm demonic beasts for the rite. It was considered a modest and proper offering.

The symbolism outweighs the substance this time.

It was her first time participating in the ritual as the most powerful figure in the Li Family, both in authority and cultivation. It hadn’t been as difficult as she imagined, perhaps even too simple, but her heart was far from light.

Watching the rites conclude, she quietly exhaled, Fortunately, today’s talisman pills did not form instantly. They condensed within the ritual mirror and must be sought before being granted. Otherwise, if Chengliao didn’t know the truth, the aftermath would’ve been difficult to manage.

She should have explained the situation to Chengliao. But only those who had received talisman seeds through the Immortal Mirror were immune to divine abilities. The Li Family had gradually entered the gaze of various Purple Mansion Realm sects. If Li Chengliao were to learn the full truth, it might stir unwanted trouble in the end.

The Xiao Family already had a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator back then, and Chi Buzi still dared to question Xiao Guitu with divine abilities. We must be even more cautious ourselves!

Having finished her role in the ceremony, she rose on a bolt of lightning and hovered over the island at the heart of the lake. Below, the northern shore lay covered in snow, with towering peaks while the west was densely populated with cultivators coming and going. The east held immortal mountains and vast fertile plains while the south was a lush jungle teeming with Mount Yue tribes. All these were visible in her gaze.

The azure waters rippled endlessly below her feet. Mist rose over the vast lake, reeds stretched in all directions, and white vapor poured over the landscape. Five hundred kilometers of lake and marsh lay before her eyes.

Li Qinghong thought to herself, This is Moongaze Lake, ours, the Li Family’s.

She stared intently for a while. Then, a streak of golden light flashed toward her. Kong Tingyun, clad in Xiang-style robes, descended from the sky. She first offered condolences before smiling and offering congratulations, "From now on, your esteemed family should rightly be called the Moongaze Li Family!"
