# Chapter 1157: Withdrawal

A torrent of violet light surged from the horizon as the verdant wind swept across the heavens. Its pure essence coalesced into ethereal currents that veiled the sun and sky, while its turbid dregs churned into abyssal gales that scoured all illumination away. The entire surface of the lake was not only severed from the Great Void, but even visibility was reduced to near zero.

Yet everyone on the lake knew exactly how this verdant wind had been born.

"Qi Lanyan… has fallen!"

Even though Qi Lanyan’s demise had been orchestrated by the assembled cultivators, their original intent was merely to see him grievously wounded. Many had never truly believed he would fall.

'He was a disciple of Comprehending Profoundity, an heir to the Guanhua Dao Lineage, the de facto commander of all northern powers in Jianghuai... The Immortal Dao followed his commands, and even the Buddhist cultivators had to show him deference!'

A figure of his stature should have had countless trump cards. Even if cornered, a powerful backer should have appeared to save him.

'To die just like that, right here on the lake!'

Only when the verdant wind erupted into the sky, drawing every gaze, did the reality sink in. A mixture of disbelieving horror and grim satisfaction reverberated through the crowd like the tolling of a great bell, shattering the northern cultivators' defensive line in an instant.

The conflict between north and south had been constant since the founding of the Great Song. Lost territory and injuries were common, but the fall of a true divine ability master or a Maha was an exceedingly rare event. The last major loss had been the death of Vast Cicada.

Even then, the death of Vast Cicada was attributed to a Dharma Master's miscalculation and the schemes of preeminent figures. Apart from that, not a single Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, not a single Maha, had been lost.

But today was different.

The battle on Lake Xian had reached a fever pitch. Cultivators from both sides knew there was no room for retreat; every trump card was on the table. With the fighting having reached this point, disengagement was nearly impossible. Now that Qi Lanyan had truly fallen, the opportunity to withdraw had vanished entirely.

Myriad divine abilities bloomed across the sky, their colors flickering and fading within the raging verdant wind.

Yet at the heart of the storm, where Qi Lanyan had perished, there was an oasis of perfect calm, a space seemingly isolated from the world where no divine ability could penetrate. A Great Daoist Master stood there silently upon the water's surface, clad in white robes and holding the Crystalline Jade Branch.

With his arrival, the oppressive darkness of the night sky began to brighten. A brilliant sunset blazed into existence, only to sink swiftly below the horizon, accompanied by visions of collapsing golden towers and scattered imperial armies. A scene of crisp winds, white snow, and an otherworldly immortal forest enveloped the two men, drawing them into what felt like a realm of profound yin, filled with drifting, peaceful mist.

Wherever this newcomer passed, the Bright Yang scattered, its crimson light dissipating, leaving only the tranquil, unified radiance of Veiled Yin.

The Domain of Non-Duality.

As this strange light fell, the Celestial Gate shimmering behind Li Zhouwei began to dim. The young man, however, showed no sign of faltering. The kaleidoscopic cracks crawling across his face shifted and flowed as his eyes remained fixed on the Grand Preceptor of the Zhao State.

'So, this is Wei Xuanyin.'

The man was tall, with handsome, gentle features. He wore a silver robe that shimmered like the feathers of a bird, dotted with motes of light like fireflies. He stood upon a roiling mass of dark white clouds that took on the shape of beasts, one hand held behind his back, his bearing as ethereal as an immortal's.

Li Zhouwei, who stood facing him, was covered in the multicolored fissures left by the Crystalline Jade Branch. Forget escaping; a single wisp of Veiled Yin light would be enough for him to follow Qi Lanyan into death.

But despite his grievous injuries, the King of Wei remained poised in the air, a faint, knowing smile gracing his lips as he regarded the Great Daoist Master.

'He doesn't dare act. Not Wang Ziya, not Qi Lanyan, and not the man before me now, Wei Xuanyin. Willing or not, their hands are tied.'

Because of this, Li Zhouwei had the presence of mind to study this contemporary Great Daoist Master, this paragon of the Veiled Yin Dao who had reached the Purple Mansion Realm. Yet, as he looked, a flicker of doubt crossed his features.

It wasn't that the man was too strong, or too weak.

It was that he was utterly different.

Li Zhouwei had encountered Veiled Yin cultivators before. Zong Chang, whom he had fought in Wanling Heaven, was a classic example of a Veiled Yin demonic cultivator. Her divine abilities had been sharp and insidious, pressing down on him like a treacherous courtier bent on his utter ruin.

This man, however, exuded an air of transcendent grace that felt nothing like Veiled Yin. If not for the unmistakable signature of his Dao Lineage, Li Zhouwei might have mistaken him for a practitioner of Lesser Yin.

Zong Chang had possessed an art called the Chamber of Doubt, a wicked technique that fostered suspicion between ruler and subject to sow chaos from within. It was born of immense malice toward the Bright Yang Dao Lineage. Li Zhouwei sensed that the divine ability Wei Xuanyin now wielded shared the same origin as the Chamber of Doubt, yet it possessed a completely different character.

Both sought to dissolve the Bright Yang and dismantle imperial authority, but the seething hatred, the desire for total annihilation, was gone. In its place was a righteous conviction, one that sought to benefit its own Path without being beholden to imperial favor.

'This... this is the true Guanhua Dao Lineage!'

The swirling verdant wind cordoned them off from the outside world. The successor of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao wore a placid expression as he, too, studied Li Zhouwei. There was no grief or anger in his eyes. His grip on the Crystalline Jade Branch was perfectly steady as he waved a sleeve, collecting the various Spiritual Artifacts and Spiritual Treasures left behind. A glimmer of relief even surfaced in his gaze.

'Thank the heavens… For the sake of the Crystalline Jade Branch, the Yang family must give us face. And the powers that be held no particular dislike for Martial Nephew Qi. Otherwise, the moment the Exiled Qi descended, his soul would have been utterly annihilated!'

Wei Xuanyin had seen all of Qi Lanyan's actions.

'The reason for his death wasn't just Li Zhouwei… it can also be attributed to the Yang Clan. His actions truly infuriated them. Yang Ruiyi… or rather, the influential figures in the Underworld who have vested interests with the Yang Clan, had come to despise him.'

Someone had evidently been guarding the Hall of Profound Spirit-Cleansing, delaying Wang Ziya for more than ten exchanges. This had left Qi Lanyan to face a Reflecting Metal Sword Immortal—who was also a Great Daoist Master—and King Wei, Li Zhouwei, completely unprepared, resulting in the terrifying sword wound that ultimately claimed his life. At the same time, the Exiled Qi in the sky had grown unprecedentedly dense, cutting off all avenues of escape and even barring Wei Xuanyin himself from intervening.

Wei Xuanyin had received word the instant Wang Ziya made his move at Baiye Creek and had rushed from the capital, intending to oversee the situation personally.

But his status was different, and the timing was exceptionally sensitive. He had barely entered the Baihai Creek region when an emissary from the Underworld appeared to intercept him. Their words were polite, but their stance was unyielding. The battle at Lake Xian had spiraled beyond even his predictions—he never imagined his martial nephew would be so decisive, so resolute in pushing the situation to such an extreme.

That Qi Lanyan’s soul had survived at all was, in Wei Xuanyin's eyes, a stroke of immense fortune.

His handsome eyes swept over Li Zhouwei.

The man’s body roiled with multicolored light, the first signs of the Wu Light disaster already emerging. Yet his face was as placid as water, only the knuckles of the hand gripping his halberd were white. In Wei Xuanyin's perception, however, the aura radiating from Li Zhouwei was a pillar of power that pierced the heavens, something the shimmering lights could never conceal.

His gaze was complicated. After a long moment, he spoke.

"Greetings, King Wei."

Li Zhouwei’s expression was unruffled.

"I have long heard of your great name, Daoist friend."

Wei Xuanyin’s gaze faltered for an instant. He let out a long breath.

"My martial nephew's karmic debts are paid. Bright Yang has claimed his body, and with it, peace comes to Jianghuai. The accounts are settled."

The colored light in the young man's eyes wavered, spilling down his cheeks and tracing crack-like black marks that his flesh quickly healed. His voice was calm and cold as he replied,

"Only Bright Yang's debt is settled."

Wei Xuanyin's expression shifted. His gaze grew complex as he realized just how many people Qi Lanyan had offended. The image of the newly ascended Daoist Master with the treasure pouch flashed through his mind. After a brief silence, he said,

"In the karmic tides of this world, much is beyond our control. More often than not, it ends in mutual destruction. So it is for you and Lanyan today."

Li Zhouwei did not reply.

The vast aura of Veiled Yin lingered between heaven and earth. Wei Xuanyin gave him one last, profound look before his form dissolved into streams of white qi, scattering like smoke. All the otherworldly radiance receded with him, retreating northward like the tide.

Li Zhouwei had already retrieved an item from his sleeve.

It was the size of a finger, as round as a Golden Core, and shone in his palm like a miniature sun. It was the Pill of the Second Manifestation's Vast Yang.

After swallowing the pill, the tension in his face eased slightly, but the colored fissures remained, and the dense, kaleidoscopic light in his eyes did not fade.

His dharma body was in a state of chaos.

The physical damage from the Crystalline Jade Branch was secondary. The true danger was the torrent of green, purple, and yellow light surging within him, weaving through every limb and bone.

The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth!

These three lights were not a profound energy or a remnant of some technique; they were a calamity of an extremely high order. It manifested ceaselessly, filling him inside and out, bringing with it the peril of a trapped mind and a confounded spirit, the tribulation of having his own divine abilities pierced and scattered.

The moment it struck, Li Zhouwei had lost all sight and sense of direction. His vision dissolved into chaos, and his spiritual sense felt as though it had sunk into a murky pool, heavy and inert. Only the thrum of his Talisman Seed had shocked him back to awareness.

Even so, his spiritual sense was still pitifully weak, its connection to the world almost severed. His eyes were dark and sightless. In the preceding moments, he had been reduced to fighting by sound alone.

As for his dharma body, the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth had all but consumed it. The unique power of having his life-mandate anchored in his Purple Mansion Realm allowed him to just barely command his divine abilities and react. But it was a world of difference from his prior state. Qi Lanyan had been right: Li Zhouwei was a spent force. He had never suffered an injury this severe in his entire cultivation journey.

Compared to this, the physical agony—like being flayed by knives, scorched by fire, and drowned in water—was a trivial matter. But Li Zhouwei could feel it keenly: the calamity was still intensifying, grinding against the divine power he was recovering through his Perilous Tread technique.

'The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth… how vicious.'

As the colors of Veiled Yin abruptly withdrew, Li Zhouwei finally heard the howl of the wind. The roiling verdant wind still raged across the sky, obscuring sight. The chaotic clashes of divine abilities were gradually dying down, replaced by the faint sounds of shouting and slaughter.

'It seems some people… didn't manage to retreat.'

His expression remained unchanged. He took out several spiritual medicines and pills, consuming them all, but they had little effect. Raising a hand, he produced another.

This pill was a deep violet, wreathed in an aura of Supreme Yin. It was small and delicate compared to the others—the Hundred-Night Heart-Glimpsing Elixir, which Li Ximing had once obtained from a mystic realm that fell from Wanling Heaven.

Its purpose was to dispel illusions and clarify the spiritual sense.

The moment it passed his lips, it dissolved into a current of Supreme Yin and Pure Qi, flowing downward to suppress the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth.

The elixir was a product of a grotto-heaven, after all, and possessed the power of Supreme Yin. It finally caused the raging calamity within him to recede. The colors in Li Zhouwei's eyes faded a fraction, and his spiritual sense could once again extend three yards from his body. His connection to his divine abilities strengthened. Yet, he felt little joy.

The reason was simple: the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth was self-perpetuating and constantly growing stronger. The effects of the Hundred-Night Heart-Glimpsing Elixir were finite and would not last.

'But it's enough to clean up the mess.'

Though he still could not see, he possessed the Spirit Probe. With a mere thought, the entire panorama of the lake appeared in his mind's eye.

The Supreme Yang Radiance Treasure Pouch hovered in the sky, its light pinning down a colossal golden body. The figure had six arms and six legs, and its various golden artifacts were shattered. Its neck was a mass of weeping faces. The treasure of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition clearly had a unique power that prevented the creature from taking its own life to escape.

It was Nuzi, the lapdog of the Peacock from the Way of Great Desire.

Li Zhouwei's expression held steady as his focus shifted. The remaining divine abilities on the lake were now concentrated in another area.

Beneath the barrage of techniques stood a middle-aged man.

He had handsome features, appearing to be in his late thirties or early forties, with a high-bridged nose and deep-set eyes. His former dashing air was gone. Disheveled and bare-chested, his lower body was mangled, and the sword in his hand was snapped in two. Blood trickled from his lips, but his expression remained grim and unyielding.

'The Ruler of the Tiefu Kingdom.'

'Helian Wujiang.'

---

Eastern Sea.

Mist drifted over the waves as a white-bearded old Daoist flew north on a gourd, his expression desolate. He lifted a sleeve, revealing two clean, smooth gashes in his supposedly vajra-indestructible robe.

'Those Sword Immortals are certainly skilled.'

Though his words were complimentary, his spirit was clearly flagging. As he traveled, he saw the white-robed Great Daoist Master approaching on beast-like clouds of white qi. Wang Ziya cupped his hands in a gesture of regret and sighed.

"It was my failure."

Wei Xuanyin looked up and shook his head.

"Disciple-brother, you did all you could. If it had been Touba Qiye, Yangfeng would have been annihilated, body and soul, without a trace remaining."

Wang Ziya replied, "There is no need to spare my feelings, junior brother. I’ve spent my life as a priest in a grotto-heaven. I can preach the scriptures and discuss the Daoist arts well enough, but I am ill-suited for wielding Spiritual Treasures to harm others. It is a pity for our martial nephew. For the next century or two, he can only live out his days peacefully as a mortal."

Wei Xuanyin smiled faintly.

"Perhaps this is for the best. His karmic slate is wiped clean, his tribulations are passed."

The Great Daoist Master paused, then lowered his gaze.

"When he first entered the grotto-heaven, he was not chosen and was cast aside by his clan. He held a grudge ever since. He never had the temperament to achieve the Great Dao. Now that he has passed through this trial of life and death, it is the perfect time for him to return to the grotto-heaven to cultivate. In a way, his wish has been granted."

"My master left a favor for me and prepared a profound medicine. I must trouble you, disciple-brother, to retrieve it so that he may be reincarnated."

Wang Ziya was stunned.

"You… that is the only one of its kind in the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao," he said in disbelief. "Since Martial Uncle left it for you, how can you part with it? What will you do? Such things are treasures even on the mountain…"

Wei Xuanyin gave a deep bow, placing the Crystalline Jade Branch in the other man's hands.

"I no longer have a use for it. It will serve as compensation for him. I entrust this to you, disciple-brother."

Wang Ziya was speechless for a long time. Just as he was about to argue further, the Great Daoist Master before him smiled.

"This is a good thing. It fulfills his destiny, and it fulfills mine. With the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao having suffered such a grievous blow, we have the perfect excuse to withdraw from Jianghuai and cease our interference with Bright Yang. Martial Nephew Qi has already paid with his life… and since he died acting on the will of that personage, there is even less that can be said."

Understanding dawned on Wang Ziya. He stared at the Crystalline Jade Branch in his hand and murmured,

"You planned this all along?"

Wei Xuanyin shook his head, a strange complexity in his voice.

"Yes," he said softly, "but it happened far sooner than I had planned."

Wang Ziya continued to stare at him, finding it hard to believe. Long after the Grand Preceptor of Zhao had bowed and vanished over the horizon, the face of Qi Lanyan suddenly appeared in his mind. In that moment, he finally understood the true reason his martial nephew had been willing to sacrifice everything to oppose Bright Yang.

'Was it to pave the way for Disciple-brother Wei? Yes, and no.'

'The Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao's position in Jianghuai was likely intended to obstruct Bright Yang from the start. If that were to come to pass, someone from Guanhua would have to step forward as the obstruction. If it wasn't Qi Lanyan, it would have to be Wei Xuanyin.'

'Qi Lanyan acted with such desperation, such blatant malice toward Bright Yang, to ensure both the south and the north understood his intentions. His true goal wasn't to hinder Bright Yang or achieve some grand result. It was to prove he was the sharper, more willing blade—and in doing so, to shield Wei Xuanyin from that fate.'
