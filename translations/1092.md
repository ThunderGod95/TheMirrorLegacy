# Chapter 1092 Probing

The cave residence was pitch black.

On a green jade table sat a round jade disk, roughly the size of a human head. Emerald light flickered across its surface as intricate, thread-like patterns emerged one by one. A young man held a jade knife, his focus absolute as he meticulously carved.

Formation disks were a fusion of artifact refinement and formation arts. This was precisely why they were so rare and precious, especially at higher grades. To master even one of these Daos was a remarkable achievement; finding an individual proficient in both was exceedingly difficult.

Even though Li Suining was a man living a second life, he had never considered attempting it. Carving this jade disk now was merely a special training exercise.

'It's now... the tenth month of Martial Cultivation Year Nine.'

'I wonder how Suikuan and the others are doing...'

As the spiritual qi flowed through the cavern, the white-robed man anxiously set down the jade knife and let out a long breath. He stood and paced a few steps before stopping at the doorway. He hesitated for a moment, but did not step outside.

Li Suining had been here for more than three years, a situation that amounted to house arrest. He was growing unbearably restless.

"Little Uncle said he was also under house arrest... forbidden from leaving. But in the spring of Martial Cultivation Year Ten, the Touba family invades Huai, Western Shu sends out its feelers, and he joins the battle, revealing his Sword Intent... Does that mean they're waiting until the enemy is at the gates before they let him out?"

"If that's the case, why bother with this house arrest at all!"

Li Suining truly could not understand. With the Martial Cultivation Star shining, and with those at the divine ability level holding back, a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was more than capable of contributing on the battlefield without being easily killed. Why all this secrecy!

Most importantly, if he was stuck here, how could he alter the course of events? The 'Touba invasion of Huai' was one thing, but what about the 'Battle of Baihai' in Martial Cultivation Year Eighteen? Or even further out, the Changhe Rebellion that would claim his Little Uncle's life? If he was still powerless to act, what room to maneuver did he have!

His heart tightened with anxiety as he secretly calculated.

'That great battle injured his Lordship. I wonder if he's recovered. When the Touba family invades this time, will King Wei... also fight Touba Lan?'

As he was lost in thought, he noticed the door to his cave residence tremble slightly. The surrounding silence was absolute, and his heart leaped into his throat.

A low hum...

Brilliant Heavenly Light suddenly spilled in. A man in ink-black robes had appeared. Though his golden eyes held no malice, their gaze pierced Li Suining like a blade, making his heart tremble. In the next instant, he was filled with overwhelming joy!

'King Wei is out of seclusion!'

He prostrated without hesitation, his voice full of respect.

"This junior pays his respects to King Wei!"

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes focused on him.

"You're a sensible one."

Although Li Zhouwei was the King Wei, most clansmen within Ting Province still referred to him as Daoist Master. It was typically the Daoist Masters from surrounding territories, those who had taken over Yang Song's position, who addressed him as King Wei. Li Suining's choice of address was, therefore, proper.

He studied the young man for a long moment, then paced forward until he stood before him. He glanced at a letter on the table.

"It seems Jiangchun is quite fond of you."

Li Suining, already on edge, suddenly understood the precarity of his situation. A cold sweat broke out on his back. He scrambled to reply,

"Little Uncle... cares for all us juniors... not just me."

The Daoist Master nodded, his eyes fixed quietly on him.

"The clan was already monitoring the Weizeng affair. You played your part well. Zhoufang escaped a calamity by chance when he was young, and now, by another 'chance,' he saves Guest Retainer Ding. Now all eyes are on him."

'Daoist Master... has he realized something?'

The words were spoken flatly, but they plunged Li Suining into an icy abyss. His heart sank. He remained kneeling for a moment before answering,

"This junior... doesn't understand. I lost my father when I was young. I only have a few elders to rely on."

"It matters not."

This King Wei of Great Song was merely probing; he already had his own conclusions. He gave Li Suining a look that held a trace of a smile. The only sound in the cave was the hollow echo of his boots on the stone floor. Li Suining kept his head bowed, silent.

Ever since Li Ximing had returned from the Chunyi Dao Gate and seen Chi Buzi, he had been speculating about the illusory colors he had witnessed in the Immortal Mirror's vision. The Li clan had seen countless geniuses; Li Zhouwei had even met the famed Xueyang of Mount Luoxia!

But not even that Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia had drawn the slightest favor from the Immortal Mirror. And the fact that Chi Buzi had been possessed was something Li Xuanxuan had witnessed with his own eyes. It could not be wrong.

'Today's Chi Buzi is likely just someone else wearing that skin-bag. It's highly probable that what triggered the Immortal Mirror was the possession technique itselfâ€”one from the heavens!'

And Li Suining's unparalleled talent in the Dao of formations, combined with his extraordinary mind, served as the perfect proof!

'How could anyone be born with such knowledge... It must be possession!'

But even knowing that the person inside Li Suining's body was likely one of "their own" from the heavens, Li Zhouwei would say nothing to expose him. He wouldn't even hint that they were on the same side.

He even had to help Li Suining maintain his cover.

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes rested on Li Suining. He gave a slight wave of his hand, cutting off the words the young man was about to speak.

'Whichever Lord is backing you... you've clearly gone to great lengths. You can't reveal the plan, so don't bother saying it.'

A bitter taste filled Li Suining's mouth. His own thoughts were the complete opposite.

'I can't hide it from these powerful divine ability experts!'

What he, Li Suining, needed most was the trust of Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing. In this day and age, without the backing and resources that came from the trust of a Purple Mansion Realm expert, what influence could he possibly have on the world? King Wei's current attitude left him completely uncertain.

But then, Li Zhouwei took a step toward him and smiled.

"Whatever you need, just report it directly to me. I'll take care of it. There's no need to go through Zhoufang and the others. Their words... are often useless."

'What?'

Li Suining was completely floored. He froze, stammering,

"This..."

Li Zhouwei helped him to his feet. The King Wei's golden eyes glinted with a probing light.

"However... before that... I need to take you on a trip to Mount Dali."

"Are you willing?"

Though his mind was clouded with doubt, Li Suining bowed deeply.

"This junior will obey your Lordship's every command!"

This was a move Li Zhouwei had planned long ago.

'The Fox-kin... their stance is still ambiguous. Li Suining is the perfect test!'

Li Ximing's hint about Chi Buzi had suggested a figure from the heavens. But Li Zhouwei, who had been part of the Dragon-Fox Pact, couldn't help but feel it referred to the powerful being behind the Fox-kin.

The Fox-kin had protected the Li clan for generations, acting on an entrustment from some ancient immortal. This itself was likely an arrangement from the heavens. Li Suining's anomaly was, without a doubt, the perfect touchstone.

The golden-eyed young man was perfectly calm, his thoughts clear.

'This is a two-way verification. There is a great power behind the Fox-kin. If Li Suining isn't one of their agents, the Fox-kin will almost certainly sense something is off.'

'And if Li Suining _is_ an agent from the heavens, he can be used to probe the Fox-kin's attitude. From the information about Chi Buzi, it's possible the Fox-kin have their own connection to the heavens!'

He summoned a beam of light, murmuring inwardly.

'By observing the reactions on both sides, I can learn so much.'

'If... this all works out, Li Suining... will be immensely useful!'

...

The sky was a leaden gray, weighed down by heavy, dark clouds.

Beyond the great plain that formed the Jiangbei heartland, along the banks of Baijiang Creek, stood an imposing mountain. Its thick earth was a sallow-yellow, and its massive boulders were menacing. Palaces and halls were scattered across the barren slopes, but not a single tree was in sight.

Tangdao Mountain had once been a treacherous peak. It had been corrupted by a cache of Primordial Magnetism, destabilizing its earth-qi. Then, a convulsion of Proclaimation Earth had transformed the Primordial Magnetism, hollowing out the mountain's core. Situ Huo had immediately seized the location and unleashed a torrent of Metal Malice. Like a terminally ill man taking a final, desperate dose of medicine, the mountain had finally died, becoming a desolate, barren waste.

Viewed from the northern plains, the mountain was a study in shadows, its colors heavy and dark.

A man stood against the skyline. He appeared to be in his thirties or forties, with a high-bridged nose and deep-set eyes. His gaze was gloomy as he stared at the mountain, silent.

It was Helian Wujiang.

Before long, a young man in snowy-white-feathered robes descended from mid-air. He carried a long-hafted blade that shimmered with light. He was handsome, save for a small scar on one cheek, and his expression carried a shadow of gloom.

Helian Wujiang looked at his junior.

"The Touba have arrived?"

Helian Wumeng replied in a low voice, "Word has come... The Touba family is camped at Luoxia, led by Touba Lan himself. The Li and Ni families from Western Shu, who were lingering near Liang Province, have also pulled back. Now they're just hovering outside the Western Mountains."

"With their support gone, Murong Yan immediately conquered that position. I hear... Murong Yan has successfully cultivated the 'Spring of Rebirth'... He's already at the mid-Purple Mansion Realm."

Hearing this, Helian Wujiang shook his head.

"Don't waste your anger on Touba Lan. He may be of my generation, but he has the entire Touba family at his back. If he wants to stir up trouble, let him. For now, we endure."

Helian Wumeng raised a cold eyebrow.

"If it weren't for his name, what would he be? Uncle, you and he reached the Foundation Establishment Realm at the same time. He used every priceless resource imaginable and still lost to you. He's a dishonorable man, and he still resents that loss to this day!"

Helian Wujiang had been born during the Helian family's darkest hour. He had not only reached the Purple Mansion Realm at a young age, but his pace had been no slower than that of Golden Core scions like Touba Lan, who cultivated in grotto-heavens. He had been a top-tier genius. It was only after reaching the Purple Mansion Realm that the gap between them slowly widened, but he seemed utterly unbothered, his expression placid.

"I hear King Dai has already mastered all five methods, and the Young Lord is also at the Purple Mansion Realm. Don't provoke him. You've only just integrated the Iron Edict Elixir; you haven't mastered the other two treasures. You should be biding your time."

The young man shook his head.

"Situ Huo is holding the mountain, and Great General Yang can reinforce him at any moment. Jiangjuan has no big movements. However... there is news from the north bank of Ting Province."

Helian Wujiang raised an eyebrow as his junior continued with a cold laugh.

"Sima Yuanli went over with Great General Yang's orders. It seems his talks with Li Ximing didn't go well. He went twice in three days and came back disappointed both times. He couldn't give the general an answer... and was left cooling his heels outside the main hall for quite a while."

Helian Wujiang was a natural schemer; how could he miss the meaning behind this? He shook his head.

"They're desperate to get Li Zhouwei out of seclusion. It seems Li Ximing's stance is firm. They were forced to send Sima Yuanli to persuade him, but Sima Yuanli doesn't want to offend either side, and he doesn't have the backbone for the task. How could he possibly persuade him?"

"But if they sent someone with backbone," Helian Wumeng interjected, "they'd just offend the Li family..."

Helian Wujiang shook his head again.

"You're overestimating the Li clan. Without Li Zhouwei, the Li clan is no better than the Lingu family. Don't you see those two Li family princes... that Jiangxia and Li Jianglong? They're being forcibly transferred to the north right now. And for what? Isn't it just to force Li Zhouwei out of seclusion?"

"Those two are guarding Baijiang Creek, and the danger is mounting. Last time, Jiangxia was heavily injured. What will happen next time? You must not underestimate Great General Yang."

Helian Wumeng was pensive. He looked up at the sky, at the mass of rolling black clouds to the south. A streak of light shot through the darkness and landed in his palm.

The fierce general of the Helian family read the message, his eyes widening slightly.

"News from the Touba!"

Helian Wujiang turned his head instantly.

"Touba Lan and his men laid siege for several days," Helian Wumeng reported.

"They used their treasures to surround the mountain and have confirmed a fluctuation of Exiled Qi within Tangdao Mountain! Yang Ruiyi... has almost certainly arrived to reinforce the north and is now trapped inside!"

This new information made Helian Wujiang's eyes narrow.

One had to understand that with the arrival of the Touba family, the allied armies of Zhao State were now strong enough to suppress Great Song. With Western Shu on the sidelines, eager to stir up trouble, any escalation would mean that Great Song would be at a severe disadvantage on the main battlefield.

The only reason for the long delay was Yang Ruiyi.

"That man relies on his Exiled Qi Spiritual Treasure to come and go like a ghost. If he ambushes and suppresses someone, he could kill them without a sound, reversing the entire situation. That's why everyone has been hesitating..."

But as Western Shu's forces had slowly pulled back, Helian Wumeng knew that Profound Governance had long been planning a major southern invasion.

"Now that the Touba family's occult barrier is in place... if they can confirm that a large contingent of divine ability experts is pinning down Yang Ruiyi and Situ Huo at Tangdao Mountain, the other flank can launch a direct invasion. The only one left to fight is Liu Bai. This isn't just an advantage; it's a heaven-sent opportunity!"

Helian Wujiang's expression darkened.

"Touba Lan wants to... press the attack on Tangdao Mountain and force Yang Ruiyi's hand."

Helian Wumeng just laughed, his voice light.

"I think it's more than that. He's just riding the wave. So what if he has a conspiracy? The current strength of Zhao State... is more than enough to fight him head-on. In fact, we're waiting for a major conflict!"

His gaze was filled with disdain.

"Li Zhouwei hasn't shown his face in years. That group of Lords must be getting anxious. Qi Lanyan is fanning the flames, and he'll certainly never let Li Zhouwei heal his internal injuries completely. As for casualties? Who cares?"

He dismissed the glowing message in his hand and lowered his gaze.

"I haven't seen him in years, either. This order is perfect. I'm going to cross the river and see what he's capable of now!"

Helian Wujiang's eyes hardened.

"It's time you went. But be careful. Your divine ability may be on par with his, but a single Iron Edict Elixir isn't enough to guarantee your escape from him."

The younger man took a deep, excited breath, his hand drifting up to the scar on his-face.

"Don't worry... Clan Uncle. If I can face a trial of life and death under his halberd, it will force me to improve. Besides... in truth, he and I... we're the same."

His handsome face twisted with a dark, sinister energy.

"I will avenge my ancestors, and I will turn the world upside down to do it. Having an opponent like him is the perfect chance to refine the Iron Edict Elixir in the crucible of battle. If I can't even survive against Li Zhouwei, then your nephew will only die a more pathetic death later on..."

"And to be blunt, they can't stand to see me wield the Helian family's three king-artifacts. They'll try to kill me sooner or later. To die under his halberd... not only might it win a sliver of pity from those Lords, it would be a satisfying end."
