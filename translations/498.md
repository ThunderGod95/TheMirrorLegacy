# Chapter 746: Parting

Li Xijun felt a chill rise in his heart. This single conscription request would nearly empty out the Li Family. After calculating carefully, he realized the numbers had been set with precision, exactly seventy percent of their available cultivators.

He almost instinctively reacted, unable to hide his displeasure, and blurted out, "What?!"

Zhao Tinggui could only respond with an awkward chuckle. Li Xijun quickly composed himself and said softly, "Forgive my rudeness."

Zhao Tinggui quickly waved it off with a faintly apologetic look. He didn't want to offend the Li Family, but these people had to be taken. With lives and legacies on the line, no amount of courtesy or sentiment could change that. He simply drank his tea in silence.

Seeing his stance, Li Xijun had no choice but to speak up himself, softly, "Honored Emissary... There's truly no justification for this. Even the average esteemed family wouldn’t face such a sweeping draft. Our family stands guard over Moongaze Lake, bearing the brunt of impact and serving as a barrier for Azure Pond Sect... I ask that you consider this carefully."

Though Zhao Tinggui was Moon Lake Peak’s senior disciple, he came from a humble mortal background and had only been taken as a disciple by Ning Wan through a stroke of luck.

Now a loyal follower of the Ning Family, he feared no ordinary esteemed family but even so, facing the Li Family, he felt some apprehension and simply said, "I am merely carrying out orders..."

The two sides remained at an impasse for a while. Though Li Xijun hadn’t known exactly which peak would send an envoy, he had done his homework on the likely candidates. Recognizing Zhao Tinggui, he sensed hesitation in the man which meant there was room to maneuver. He thought, He came from humble roots, and it was his talent and disposition that earned Ning Wan’s favor. He’s smooth with people and not without kindness. If I apply the right pressure... there may be room to negotiate.

Li Xijun gradually fell silent. Zhao Tinggui pondered a moment, then finally gritted his teeth and said, "Our two families do have a long-standing bond... so I’ll speak plainly. There are two conditions..."

He spoke in a low, serious tone, "Your family’s core bloodline, especially those of your own generation should accompany the expedition."

The moment these words left his mouth, Li Xijun understood, So that’s what this is really about...

Zhao Tinggui’s calculations were focused here. If the Li Family’s core bloodline went to the battlefield, then should anything happen, the Li Family would be compelled to intervene. And those not under Moon Lake Peak’s control, like Li Xuanfeng and Li Xizhi, would be even less likely to stand idle. And once those two were drawn in, if the situation escalated further, it could even prompt the Yang and Xiao Families to intervene as well...

Li Xijun saw the situation clearly and sighed inwardly. If Zhao Tinggui had come prepared, then his intentions were all the more evident. He thought, It seems Yuexiang must go as well...

Li Yuexiang was Li Xizhi’s younger sister, and from how Li Xuanfeng had acted during the Yuan Family incident, it was clear she held a special place in his heart. Zhao Tinggui had surely calculated this and was aiming to ensure she went along.

After a moment’s thought, Li Xijun nodded silently and gave the order, "Go, summon Yuexiang."

Seeing Li Xijun’s action, Zhao Tinggui’s expression brightened slightly as he continued, "There is another matter. I’ve heard your esteemed family possesses a herb called the Wanglin Blossom that soothes sorrow and extends life. If your family could provide it for six of my junior brothers, I would be deeply grateful."

It wasn’t an unreasonable request. Li Xijun had already reserved some for his direct lineage. Though it would be a bit tight to give some away now, their stock could still last a year or two. He nodded slightly.

Zhao Tinggui looked genuinely pleased and said, "On behalf of my junior brothers, I thank your esteemed family!"

Li Xijun’s thoughts, however, were still on the arrangements for his family. Zhao Tinggui paused briefly, then continued, "Back to the matter of personnel, if your family is strained, you needn’t send quite as many at once.

"Four late-stage, four mid-stage, nineteen early-stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, and eighty Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators... how does that sound?"

Li Xijun understood this was the result of dual compromise and could only sigh, "If the sect has issued the order, the Li Family shall naturally obey."

As they spoke, a young woman entered the courtyard. She had willowy brows and almond eyes, wore a flowing white dress, and carried a longsword at her waist. She seemed to have just finished a cultivation session as traces of golden-red flame still flickered across her form.

Li Xijun said softly, "This is my younger sister, Li Yuexiang.

"This is the emissary of Moon Lake Peak, Senior Zhao Tinggui."

Zhao Tinggui glanced at her and returned the gesture with a formal salute. Though Li Xijun already knew her answer, he still turned to his sister and asked, "Our family is to serve under Moon Lake Peak, but we still lack a strong enough core bloodline representative. Yuexiang, would you be willing to take on this duty?"

Li Yuexiang simply smiled and said, "I’ve been idle at home long enough. It’s good to finally be of use. Arrange as you see fit, brother."

Li Xijun let the two formally exchange greetings, then turned to Zhao Tinggui with a smile and said, "Do not underestimate the women of our family, Emissary. Yuexiang is not some delicate lady of the boudoir, she will be of great help in the north."

Zhao Tinggui quickly agreed. Li Yuexiang, after hearing their arrangement, responded gently, "I’ll go now to assemble the people."

She left swiftly. Zhao Tinggui took a glance at her departing figure and sipped his tea. Li Xijun, deep in thought, spoke softly, "Yuexiang is our youngest sister. We brothers all cherish her dearly. I ask that the Emissary look after her."

After all, Li Yuexiang’s presence already signaled the Li Family’s intent to support. Naturally, they would intervene if something happened. Li Xijun had no intention of letting this man treat her like a mere pawn. His words carried a subtle warning as he said, "My little sister is in your hands, Daoist Friend."

Zhao Tinggui simply replied, "Rest assured, Xijun. I am not such a base man. If anything happens to Daoist Yuexiang, you may hold me personally accountable."

"Good. Then I ask that the Emissary go with her to choose people from the family," said Li Xijun.

Zhao Tinggui nodded and took his leave, leaving Li Xijun alone in the hall. After a moment’s contemplation, he refilled his teacup and murmured, "Zhao Tinggui is still unmarried, and he’s only thirty-nine... The Ning Family has reportedly broached marriage talks several times, but he declined each time, citing cultivation as his priority."

He did not believe for a moment that Zhao Tinggui's glance had been one of lust. Nor could he imagine that someone who had risen from a humble mortal household, who had boarded the Ning Family’s vessel and carved his way to become the head disciple of Moon Lake Peak through sheer talent and tenacity, would pine for beauty in his presence. It was, at most, a signal, nothing more.

If one seeks background and temperament, or beauty and talent. My little sister is indeed a match for him...

A flicker of coldness passed through his handsome eyes as he recalled Zhao Tinggui’s subtle message, thinking, He's striking the mountain to shake the tiger, advancing and retreating with control, killing three birds with one stone, and balancing personal and political matters. A capable man indeed. But it all depends on what Yuexiang thinks. Once she's spent time with him and sees his true character... she’ll know where she stands.

News of the Celestial Sect’s decree had spread earlier, and the Li Family had received word internally as well. Now that the Dawn Cloudliner had arrived and several esteemed family leaders descended the mountain, the message was perfectly clear.

Li Yuexiang descended the mountain to meet Li Chengliao, who was overwhelmed with tasks. Only when his aunt landed gracefully did he hurry forward to greet her.

"They want nineteen early stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, and they have to be orthodox cultivators... can’t be substandard..." said Li Yuexiang.

After reviewing the numbers, Li Chengliao realized that even if they filled the list with outer surnames, a few of their own brothers would still need to go. Not to mention, they needed to leave some power behind for the esteemed house. If there were too few cultivators with the Li surname, Zhao Tinggui likely wouldn’t be satisfied.

"An Zheyan, Li Chengchu, Chen Mufeng, Li Wen... these will cover the late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators...

"Li Minggong, Li Chengyou..."

He finished the list. Li Yuexiang reviewed it and found the arrangements sound. An Siwei from the An Family was being left behind, and their own core line had contributions. She asked, "With these people sent out, what strength remains in the family?"

"Elder Chen and others remain... As for the Radiant Lure generation, only Chenghuai and Chengxi, who is stationed at the Eastern Sea, are left. Most others with decent cultivation will be sent out."

Li Yuexiang replied softly, nodding, "Your arrangements are sound. Go ahead and summon them."

Li Chengliao nodded. Then Li Yuexiang said softly, "In my view... the northern campaign won’t be easy. As time drags on, more rounds of conscription will follow. They won’t rest until all the major families are hollowed out. Watch over the household, we may need to send more later."

Li Chengliao understood and took out several storage pouches, saying, "All provisions and pills are prepared here. Take care, Aunt."

As the two were speaking, those summoned had gathered outside the hall. Li Yuexiang stepped out of the inner hall and saw Zhao Tinggui descending on a breeze.

Just as Zhao Tinggui left Mount Qingdu, thoughts had already begun stirring in his heart, I’ve seen Li Xizhi before. He is refined, noble, undeniably worthy of an esteemed family’s core bloodline. We never spoke. But Li Xijun... he’s truly a hard man to deal with.

Zhao Tinggui had met many people in the sect, including the likes of Yu Muxian and couldn’t help but sigh inwardly, Moongaze Lake really is a land of talent and destiny. How many figures have emerged from here over the past century? Nearly every storm of the era seems to touch this place.

Returning to his senses and looking at the two, Zhao Tinggui, always courteous in speech, simply said, "Greetings, Daoist Friends."

Li Yuexiang replied respectfully. Zhao Tinggui immediately looked over the gathered cultivators below, pointed out a few to be replaced, added new ones, checked the list twice, and asked, "Your family has very few who cultivate wood or earth Dao but quite a few thunder Dao cultivators."

He smiled and continued without waiting for a response, "It matters little, I have two junior brothers who specialize in wood and earth. They’ll fill the gap. Thunder cultivators, however, are rare and valuable."

Li Yuexiang smiled faintly. Zhao Tinggui said nothing more, only spoke softly, "Then let it be settled. Submit the list to me, boarding begins in four hours."

"Please allow the family's disciples time to bid farewell to their families..." Li Yuexiang turned and looked at the disciples below, most wore complex expressions, though a few seemed eager. She addressed them, "This journey is a matter of life and death and of opportunity. Go now and bid your families farewell. In one hour, gather at the Dawn Cloudliner in Milin Prefecture."

The crowd responded in unison and dispersed. Li Yuexiang went to the peak to pay respects to her parents and bid farewell to her brother. Li Xijun handed her a few talismans and said quietly, "Above all, protect your own safety first. I’ve spoken with Zhao Tinggui, he will see to your well-being."

Zhao Tinggui gestured for her to proceed. After bidding farewell, Li Yuexiang left with him toward the cloudliner. The area was filled with mourning and gloom. On the vast vessel, few faces looked pleasant.

Moon Lake Peak had shown courtesy to the Li Family but to the smaller families, they had simply taken people by force. After all, asking these minor families one by one would take until tomorrow, and the ship didn’t have the manpower to spare.

The area echoed with weeping. These people practiced crude techniques. Among a whole group of elders, they couldn’t muster three proper spell arts. For them, heading north likely meant working to death.

As for killing enemies and earning treasures, not only was it unclear if they could kill any, even if they did, whether they’d be allowed to keep what they got was uncertain. All they could hope was that Moon Lake Peak acted with fairness.

Zhao Tinggui, seeing all this clearly, deliberately raised his voice, "Fellow Daoists, Xu State is not like Jiangnan. Do not despair... Xu State is unlike any other region, it is filled with opportunity."

As the highest-ranking figure present, once he spoke, all eyes turned to him. He smiled and said, "Xu State is a land of constant strife, filled with countless spirit husk cave dwelling and chaotic spiritual aura. The demonic, buddhist, and immortal Daos clash endlessly. The Great Void itself is a storm, its aura shifts multiple times a day, triggering countless opportunities...

"Now, neither the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators see it clearly nor Maha can divine it. Omens everywhere. Grotto heavens open and close, ancient ruins rise... Rain falls as jade, the earth rolls with gold and stone... Pristine water shimmer."

As he spoke, many faces changed and greed began to show. Zhao Tinggui smiled and added, "You’ve all come, why wallow in gloom? Better to strive with all your might and seize your chance. Perhaps after a year, you’ll return riding the wind... as Foundation Establishment Realm or even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators!"

Li Yuexiang quietly shook her head. Reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm was still possible but reaching Purple Mansion Realm just from a trip to Xu State was pure fantasy. Yet many below were tempted, murmuring questions about spiritual aura, which they didn’t even understand.

Zhao Tinggui, hearing a few confused questions, explained, "A region's spiritual aura is the flow of its spiritual energy. Its scope may be vast or narrow and often aligns with symbolic essences like metallic essence allowing it to resonate with certain grotto heavens or cause fated opportunities to manifest... The more chaotic the area, the smaller and more frequent the changes..."

"For instance, in a condition like Falling Water Rising Storm, it’s easier to connect with a thunder arts grotto heaven. Xu State now changes three times a day, with nine types in one region. Naturally, there will be many pportunities."

The crowd stirred with chatter. Some began asking what metallic essence was. Zhao Tinggui realized this line of explanation could go on forever, but the atmosphere had improved so he stopped speaking.

Li Yuexiang watched quietly. A few of the younger cultivators showed promising talent and bright, eager eyes tinged with hope.

When the times change, all hope to be the dragon or serpent that rises from the land... thought Li Yuexiang.

Not just the young, though sorrowful, few among the gathered lacked some sliver of hope. Each dreamed of perhaps being the one destined for greatness in this era.

At Mount Bianyan, danger and opportunity walked hand in hand. Who knew what spells, dharma artifacts, resources, or pills one might stumble upon?

After a while, her family members gathered. The cloudliner began to move, and Mount Qingdu slowly disappeared from view.

Soon, the scenery beneath began to shift. Desert villages, jagged stones, fields full of bones, and flickering dharma light could be seen from above. Only when the great river appeared below did Li Yuexiang begin to feel she had truly left home.

Just as Zhao Tinggui had described, the world grew misty. To the east, the fog shimmered gold like a blazing sun. To the south, it was heavier. It was cold and ominous, with no visible boundary.

My brothers always sought to shield me, leaving no place for my hand. At last, I have a chance to contribute.

She felt no fear, only a quiet sense of peace. She gazed silently northward until Mount Bianyan appeared on the horizon. Then her expression grew complicated, thinking, There should be a Zhenhui Temple on that mountain...

Zhenhui Temple was not well known, and now reduced to ruins but in the hearts of the Li Family, it stood equal to the southern border. In the mists of a mountain ravine, she thought she could just make it out and stared for a long time.
