# Chapter 734: Traversing the Great Void

'So he wants to kill Kong Haiying.'

Li Ximing scoffed inwardly. In truth, there was no irreconcilable conflict between the Capital immortals Dao and the Li family. But he didn't believe for a second that Yehui's goal was merely Kong Haiying.

'If all your moves were aimed at Kong Haiying, why give my family such a sour look earlier?'

Since Yehui was putting on an act, Li Ximing decided to play along. A look of surprise flickered across his face.

"Daoist Yehui, didn't Kong Haiying fall some time ago? The disturbance in the Profound Peak's earth meridian before Senior Changxi's death—that was the omen of his passing!"

Yehui was momentarily stumped by the blatant lie. He stared grimly at Li Ximing. The man was supposed to be Fu En, but if he was actually Kong Haiying, it would make sense for Changxi to have deliberately misidentified him. He paused.

True or not, Li Ximing's words had completely disrupted his prepared script. Yehui's voice turned cold. "Oh? Is that... true or not... No matter. Let me witness your Bright Yang divine abilities."

As he spoke, the Great Void trembled. A vast expanse of dark purple iridescence above and below began to hum with a solemn, heavy resonance as a damp, watery vapor began to rise.

The next moment, a multicolored fish the size of a calf emerged from the iridescent light. Its scales were ethereal, shifting between deep and light shades of purple. But its head was a skeletal human skull with two hollow, quiet dark eye sockets.

The purple fish arched in the air, and countless more of its kind swarmed out of the purple haze. They converged into a torrential river beneath the Celestial Gate and surged upward. Seeing that Yehui was serious, Li Ximing’s Profound Light flared from between his brows, and the Celestial Gate behind him rumbled in response.

A battle cry shook the heavens. The countless figures in golden armor and robes on the Celestial Gate suddenly came to life. They descended with spears and swords in hand to meet the charge, clashing with the purple river and holding it back.

But with another deafening roar, Yehui exhaled a puff of white qi. This qi seemed to weigh a thousand tons, sinking instantly and causing the Great Void to congeal. Li Ximing and his entire Audience with the Celestial Gate were caught as if in a quagmire, sinking slowly, finding it difficult to advance or retreat.

'No wonder Changxi didn't dare fight him. Just with this Eastern Feather Mountain... this old fox has considerable control over the battlefield in the Great Void.'

Li Ximing knew this was Yehui's second divine ability, Eastern Feather Mountain. He was thankful that the Bright Yang lineage was formidable in combat. Intending to test his own capabilities without resorting to a Dharma Artifact, he opened his mouth and unleashed a torrent of Bright Yang Purple Fire.

This purple fire, normally nurtured in the Juque Palace, now poured out in an unending stream. It was no ordinary flame. The brilliant blaze pulsed with the power of imperial union and generation, crashing against the solidified Great Void.

Li Ximing didn't need to fight the suppression of Eastern Feather Mountain head-on. He focused the entirety of his purple fire onto a single point. No matter how powerful the opposing divine ability was, it couldn't withstand such a focused assault and a pinprick-sized hole was easily burned through the barrier.

A single point was all he needed.

In the Great Void, a point could be a plane, or it could be a doorway. Li Ximing, along with the Celestial Gate behind him, vanished, effortlessly breaking free from the lockdown of Sorrowful Southern Water and Eastern Feather Mountain. He reappeared in another section of the Great Void and transformed into a streak of Profound Light to flee.

And so, Yehui, a dignified mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator, had failed to put any real pressure on a newly advanced cultivator in two exchanges, allowing him to escape.

'So this is the Great Void...'

Li Ximing finally understood just how difficult it was for Purple Mansion cultivators to kill one another. The Great Void was a net riddled with holes. Every cultivator could be as massive as a mountain or as small as a speck of dust. How could one possibly lock down another's escape?

Yehui was not surprised. His own divine ability activated, and his figure reappeared at the edge of the purple light. He brought the entire expanse of light with him, once again enveloping Li Ximing. The suppressing pressure of Eastern Feather Mountain descended anew, bringing back the feeling of being trapped in a mire.

But this time, Yehui's hands formed a seal. The instant Eastern Feather Mountain manifested, the Great Void beneath Li Ximing twisted and hollowed out, causing him to misstep and fail to shift away. Li Ximing remained fearless. With flames held in his mouth, he spat them directly at the ritual sword in Yehui’s hands.

The sword momentarily blocked the flames, but an incredibly sharp aura rose from within the Great Void. Li Ximing knew it was his opponent's Dharma Artifact. Forcing down the impulse to draw his own, the Profound Light between his brows pulsed as he shouted, "Hah!"

Flickering Profound Light illuminated the entire expanse of the Great Void, finally revealing a brilliant golden glint. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light erupted from between Li Ximing's brows and smashed into the weapon.

Li Ximing hadn't cultivated Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light for very long, but with the foundation of his Purple Mansion cultivation and the synergy with his innate Profound Light divine ability, the combined power was actually enough to stall the Dharma Artifact for a moment.

'I can't beat you head-on, but I can certainly leave.'

Familiarity bred confidence. Purple flames surged before Li Ximing, and he slipped away once more. But Yehui took another step, reappearing right behind him, ritual sword stabbing forward. Li Ximing immediately raised his Celestial Gate to block with his divine ability. He felt a chill as a streak of purple light shot up the back of his hand.

The blow was blocked without serious injury. Li Ximing used the opportunity to pull away. After flying for several breaths, his opponent closed the distance again. Having learned his lesson, Li Ximing simply spat a mouthful of purple fire at the sword. This move countered Eastern Feather Mountain and the weapon simultaneously, allowing him to escape unscathed.

But as he shifted sideways this time, he felt the Great Void suddenly grow steeper and more difficult to navigate. A sweep of his spiritual sense revealed the distinct presence of a Pit Water formation. Glancing down at the physical world, he saw towering mountains encircled by a stream below. It was Mount Xianyou.

Li Ximing had no intention of asking the Xiao family for help; they had simply stumbled into the Great Void above Mount Xianyou during their fight. The Great Void here was like a vast mountain range, difficult to traverse. It wasn't because of a technique or a formation, but a matter of spiritual qi. Mount Xianyou was the primary spiritual hub of Lixia Prefecture, which made the local Great Void exceedingly steep.

Yehui had obviously noticed this as well. With his Sorrowful Southern Water divine ability and the aid of that crow spirit technique, he was much faster here. He closed the distance in an instant. Li Ximing blocked with a blast of purple fire and vanished, reappearing in the physical world.

'If it's hard to move in the Great Void, why can't I just travel through the physical world?'

He burst through, leaving his opponent to grasp at empty air. His eyes lit up. Below him were several spirit mountains belonging to a small family. A few cultivators were battling in the sky. Li Ximing’s divine ability flared, and in a flash, he recognized the emblem on their robes.

'The Wu family of southern Lixia. So I've already reached the southern part of the prefecture.'

The Wu family cultivators appeared to be locked in a desperate struggle with some demonic cultivators. The moment Li Ximing stepped out, the sky instantly changed from a light drizzle to a bright, clear spring day. The raindrops hanging in the air never hit the ground as the heavens filled with radiant light and colorful clouds.

'A Purple Mansion...? Huh?'

The sudden appearance of a Purple Mansion cultivator overhead froze every cultivator on the battlefield like statues. The demonic cultivator in the lead felt his mind might just explode. A single thought echoed in the blank void of his brain:

"Huh? It was just a batch of spirit rice... Was this really necessary?"

The pitched battle instantly descended into a farce. One man swinging his sword sent it flying into the sky. Another casting a spell nearly bit off his tongue. The demonic cultivator, who had half-raised his shield, didn't dare complete the motion, letting a sword chop into his head. His opponent from the Wu family was in no better state, having lost all mind for fighting and nearly plummeting from the sky.

Xiao Chuting was likely not here, and Li Ximing couldn't care less about them. He didn't pause for a moment. The Profound Light at his feet flashed, and he vanished, flying toward the distant horizon.

Yet even as he passed at a considerable distance, the demonic cultivator was caught off guard by the after-effect of Li Ximing's escape light. He felt a surge of purple flame and brilliant light wash over him. A stuffiness filled his chest, and in an instant, his hair and beard were incinerated. With a *whoosh*, his robes burst into flames.

Had he been an ordinary cultivator, it might have been better. But as a demonic cultivator, his very flesh began to burn along with his robes. The surrounding fighters watched, dumbfounded and too terrified to flee.

Fortunately, Li Ximing had only been there for a split second and had paid him no mind. He was already miles away, but the demonic cultivator's agonizing screams continued as his Dharma robes burned to ash.

Before anyone could feel relieved, the Great Void tore open once more. The sky, which had just cleared, was instantly filled with dark, heavy clouds. A solemn, prayer-like hum filled the air as Yehui's figure appeared. The Daoist Master, dressed in deep blue robes, swept his sharp, intelligent eyes over the area.

At this moment, Yehui's Sorrowful Southern Water was operating at full power, nearly half his body dissolved into a purple halo, and he was still augmented by Eastern Feather Mountain. That single glance was like a thunderbolt from a clear sky. The next moment, Yehui too had vanished. Only then did the six cultivators react, crying out in pain as they fell from the sky, trailing streaks of purple light.

Li Ximing hadn't even left the vicinity of Mount Xianyou. The moment the spiritual qi felt a little less oppressive, he ducked back into the Great Void. Yehui's purple light immediately followed. The speed of Sorrowful Southern Water was indeed impressive. Li Ximing was forced to take another hit as he saw the gates of the Profound Peak Mountain up ahead.

Yehui arrived at the same time.

He held his ritual sword, and every one of its deep blue runes was glowing. After the long chase, Yehui's face was grim. He formed a seal and chanted, and another wisp of white qi leaped from his lips.

As the white qi flew out, Li Ximing not only felt his feet grow heavy, but the very Great Void before him changed. The glow of the Profound Peak Gate's Still Earth formation was instantly extinguished, veiled by a hazy white light. Even the fabric of the Great Void became uneven and distorted.

'Eastern Feather Mountain has this kind of power?!'

Li Ximing’s spiritual sense swept out. The Great Void around the Profound Peak Gate was deathly still, and the entrance to the Purple Mansion formation had become indistinct, shifting from near to far. He knew Eastern Feather Mountain could influence the Great Void, but he never realized it had such a wondrous application.

He spat fire, broke out of the Great Void, and entered the physical world of the Profound Peak Mountain. He saw a layer of purple light, like smoke and mist, covering the vast mountain. It drew the gazes of cultivators from all over Shanji Prefecture. Yehui was seated upon it, mounted on his dark crow.

"No wonder Yehui was confident he could tie me up for three to five years... If he keeps pestering me like this, it will be truly difficult to get away. Even if he can't kill me, he could definitely wear me down to a lightly injured state over three or five years."

Li Ximing couldn't enter the gate, but he wasn't discouraged. As long as Yehui was determined to entangle him, entering the gate would just mean being trapped in a different location. This simply meant continuing the fight outside.

But he had already planned his escape route. He hadn't come all this way just to be blocked at the door. He watched coolly as the purple light circled above the Profound Peak Gate.

'But... can Daoist Master Sumian really sit still for this?'

With a cold laugh, he plunged back into the Great Void. Though he couldn't enter the gate, he led Yehui on a chase, circling again and again around the perimeter. He took a few hits from divine abilities, but after a full half-incense stick of time, the purple aura still hung over the Profound Peak Gate.

Li Ximing knew Sumian cared for his reputation, so he deliberately prolonged the stalemate with Yehui. As more and more cultivators gathered in the vicinity, Li Ximing entered the Great Void one last time and finally saw Daoist Master Sumian appear in the distance.

The old Daoist Master sighed. "Daoist Yehui... please stay your hand! This old man... promised Daoist Changxi I would protect the Profound Peak. I cannot sit by and do nothing..."

Daoist Master Changxi had died at Sumian's Xuanmiao Temple—his body had been delivered to its very doorstep. Was there any cultivator in the north or south who didn't know? Lake Xian might be under the Xuanmiao Temple's protection only because the Capital immortals Dao hadn't bothered to attack it. But now Yehui was fighting right at the mountain gate, and while Li Ximing fought back, Sumian was nowhere to be seen. This was the kind of thing that would get him scorned...

Sumian had cultivated his reputation for centuries, much of it with an eye toward his own legacy. He couldn't afford to lose it. Forced to intervene, he simply stood in the Great Void, and Yehui finally stopped.

"So it is the venerable Daoist Master Qi."

Yehui chuckled. "I was merely sparring with Daoist Master Zhaojing. I didn't expect to cause such a commotion and disturb you, venerable master. In that case, we shall stop here."

He seemed to be on decent terms with Sumian. He gave Li Ximing a deep look, then turned with a smile to Sumian. "May I ask for how long the venerable master promised Changxi his protection? I plan to visit you in a few days, precisely to discuss the matter of the Profound Peak!"

"If conflict can be turned into friendship, that is naturally for the best," Sumian replied.

Li Ximing, ignoring Yehui, calmly brushed the enemy's lingering power from his wrist and spoke directly. "I recall the Daoist Master said he would treat the wounded of the Profound Peak Gate. One of the Kong family was crippled, three others were maimed. I will have them sent to you later. I'll have to trouble you, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing couldn't be bothered with pleasantries. Since Sumian had appeared, it meant the man valued his reputation and wouldn't go back on his word. With the Profound Peak members heavily injured, why should he handle it himself when he could trouble someone else?

Sumian simply nodded as he watched Li Ximing give a perfunctory salute and depart. Yehui flicked his sleeves and left as well. The old master suddenly felt a massive headache coming on.

'I have to find a way to resolve this. There's less and less time, and I need to focus my energy on that demonic embryo. I don't have time to babysit these two...'

Sumian sighed and headed back toward the Xuanmiao Temple, his mind already racing.

'I must find a way to open the Xiaoshi Mountain treasury and settle this matter quickly. Better than having these two idle masters drawing all eyes this way, catching me in the crossfire and tying my hands...'
