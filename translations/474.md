# Chapter 692: The Fall Of A Purple Mansion Master

Azure Pond Sect, Yuanwu Peak.

The news that Daoist Master Yuanwu was about to pass away had gradually spread. This Daoist Master at the Purple Mansion Realm was constantly shuttling in and out of the sect, and all the disciples understood the situation tacitly, not daring to bring it up.

Yuanwu Peak stood tall, shrouded in mist, with fire veins surging. This peak was Azure Pond Sect’s sacred mountain dedicated to artifact refining. Usually, cultivators came and went in a bustling scene but now it appeared rather desolate, as if people were deliberately avoiding it.

After all, Yuanwu was now the most unreasonable person in and outside the sect. Even if he encountered someone he found unlucky on the road and killed them with a wave of his sleeve, no one would dare seek justice.

Tang Shedu stepped out of his cave dwelling. With the sound of his armor clanking, he was looking rather troubled.

Tang Shedu had not gained any benefits in the grotto heaven. Instead, he had suffered serious injuries. Knowing that Yuanwu had been prone to madness these past years, he used the excuse of recovery to keep delaying, staying in seclusion on the peak for over a decade.

Now, however, he had reached a point where he could no longer avoid meeting Yuanwu. If he continued to hide, Yuanwu might one day remember him and slap him to death, tearing through the great void in the process.

Before he even reached the mountainside, he saw a young-looking man standing at the mountain entrance. The man startled Tang Shedu, who quickly said, “Greetings, Daoist Master Yuan Su.”

Yuan Su held a jade flask, seemingly still drinking. He waved his hand lazily, as if swatting away flies and said softly, “I’m just here to watch him die. It has nothing to do with you.”

Seeing Yuan Su’s carefree demeanor, Tang Shedu broke into a cold sweat, nearly crying inside. Yuan Su was sharp-tongued and would never miss such a golden opportunity to mock Yuanwu, only making things harder for them.

He hurried up the mountain and saw another person standing in front of the grand hall. This man did not wear the sect’s blue robes but was draped in a brocade robe. He had short facial hair, sallow skin, a thin and long face. His lifeless eyes were filled with extreme fear.

This man was Yu Su, another key figure on Yuanwu Peak who was notorious for his greed.

The two exchanged glances, both wearing mournful expressions. The grand hall, which was usually gleaming with golden light, was now dim and lifeless. The ever-dominant Yuanwu was nowhere to be seen. Instead, a white-haired old man sat kneeling at the hall entrance, his hair was disheveled as he stared blankly.

Tang Shedu’s legs trembled as he listened to the clanking of metal from within the hall. He wished he could gouge out his own eyes at that moment. He lowered his head to his chest as he stammered, “Master…”

Yuanwu, dazed and groggy, squinted his eyes to look and said in surprise, “Cheng’er, Xiuxian, you two are here.”

The two of them immediately turned pale, kneeling in silence.

Tang Shedu and Yu Su naturally understood these two names. One was Tang Yuanwu’s son, Tang Shecheng. The other was their former senior brother, Yu Xiuxian.

Tang Yuanwu was ruthless and unfeeling, yet the only ones he had ever cared about were these two. Back when they were alive, Yuanwu Peak had a completely different atmosphere and Tang Yuanwu still had a smile on his face.

Back then, Tang Shedu had merely been a collateral disciple, following Tang Shecheng around like a lackey. Yu Su, due to his greedy nature, was often strung up and beaten by his elder brother, Yu Xiuxian, wailing through the night.

Later, Tang Shecheng perished when he failed to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, and Yu Xiuxian was killed by Guo Er of Crimson Reef Island. Yuanwu had been powerless to change their fates. From then on, his temperament grew increasingly extreme which led to his current state.

The two of them knelt there, too afraid to speak. Tang Yuanwu, hair disheveled and eyes vacant, took a step forward. He reached out to pull Tang Shedu closer, asking, “Ah… Cheng’er… why are you wearing armor? How many times have I told you… wear a Daoist robe… look more carefree… Ah… wearing a Daoist robe is better…”

Though Tang Shedu both feared and resented Tang Yuanwu, his feelings for Tang Shecheng ran deep. He couldn’t help but shed tears. Yu Su was also moved as he listened. Tang Yuanwu then reached for Yu Su, asking, “Why are you dressed so extravagantly!… Xiuxian, you’re finally thinking about yourself… Your younger brother was useless… Ah… learn more Daoist spells… don’t just cultivate…”

Yu Su had already been holding back tears, but when he heard this, he could no longer contain himself. The notoriously greedy and ruthless Jinmao Xi burst into loud sobs.

That cry was a mistake. It instantly snapped Tang Yuanwu out of his moment of tenderness and confusion. The coldness and madness returned to his eyes, and a fiery brilliance reignited in him as he erupted in fury, “You worthless wretch! What are you crying for? I’m not dead yet!”

Yuanwu struck Yu Su’s chest with a palm which sent him spewing blood across the floor. He tumbled down from the high platform and rolled over and over. His brocade robe was soaked in blood as he struggled to get up, kowtowing in anguish. “Master!”

That single cry caused Yuanwu to lower his raised hand. His gaze averted, as if avoiding Yu Su, before landing coldly on Tang Shedu.

Tang Shedu’s lips were deathly pale as he stared straight at him. Yuanwu flew into a rage and cursed, “Rebellion! Everything is in revolt!”

He kicked Tang Shedu squarely in the chest. A series of sharp cracking sounds echoed as bones shattered. Tang Shedu fell from the high platform like a bird with broken wings. Yuanwu coughed up a mouthful of golden powder and spat, “Worthless wretch!”

The sky churned with storm clouds and a massive spiral was gradually forming. At its center, the sky was blank and cloudless, leaving only a deep golden radiance shining directly upon the floating figure of the white-haired old man.

Yuanwu’s hair was in disarray, his eyes bulging as he gazed at the torrential downpour of golden grains and iron dust falling from the heavens. He let out a wail that no longer sounded human.

All of Mount Azure Pond was engulfed in the metal storm, blinding everyone within it. Each person was as if stranded on an isolated island, unable to distinguish those around them. Daoist Master Yuan Su’s expression grew solemn as he raised his jade cup and made a distant toast toward the sky.

“Senior brother… go well.”

In the seventh month, Tang Yuanwu of Azure Pond perished through self-dissolution. Golden rain fell like a waterfall, iron dust descended like sand, his spiritual sense shattered beyond measure. When the rain finally subsided, stepping outside, one could see that the green peak had turned to gold within ten meters radius.

Green Pine Island.

“I will go with you to that market and take a look at where exactly it lies within the Qunyi Strait.”

After saying this, Li Xizhi paused for a moment. Both he and his companion’s expressions changed as they sensed the violent fluctuation of spiritual energy in the heavens and earth. Without hesitation, they rose into the sky, one following behind the other.

Green Pine Island was home to many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, and soon, numerous figures could be seen gathering in the sky. They were all turning toward the south in unison. Their expressions ranged from complicated to mocking to cold sneers as they whispered among themselves.

“Yuanwu has fallen!”

Li Xizhi’s expression was somewhat conflicted. Though Yuanwu had never had a good relationship with his own faction, he was still a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. With a soft sigh, he slightly bowed to show his respect.

After a brief moment, the golden-metal storm in the distance quickly subsided. Li Xizhi turned back and summoned a disciple from Azure Pond Sect, instructing him in front of Han Shizhen, “I have obtained a lead from the peak master and will make a trip to the Han Family. Inform the others to avoid them coming one after another for instructions, only to waste their efforts.”

Han Shizhen lowered his head in silence. The disciple responded and left. Only then did Li Xizhi offer an apology, he said, “The sect has many rules, I ask for your understanding.”

Han Shizhen dared not say much and hurriedly responded, “I wouldn’t dare… wouldn’t dare… it is only proper.”

Without further delay, they rode the wind together. After two days, they descended into the market city. As soon as the market’s grand formation opened, the Han Family cultivators hurriedly approached and called out for their family head.

“Daoist, please take a look! This is our Tu Liu Market.” Han Shizhen ignored them, falling half a step behind Li Xizhi, smiling as he introduced the place in a soft voice, “Daoist, please follow me to the main hall for a short rest while I inquire about the whereabouts of those rogue cultivators.”

Hearing this, Li Xizhi furrowed his brows slightly and sensed something amiss. He followed Han Shizhen into the grand hall and took a seat at the side. Han Shizhen took two steps back, exited the hall and his smile quickly faded.

A burly man stepped forward with a heavy expression. Han Shizhen spoke in a low voice, “What did those men say?”

The burly man simply replied, “We searched one man’s soul. The others are beyond recognition.”

It turned out that although Han Shizhen claimed to have released them, he had long since skinned, dismembered and extracted their souls. The Demon Subduing Copper Rods had already fallen into the Han Family’s hands. But now, he regretted his actions and murmured, “If I had known Li Xizhi was this perceptive, I wouldn’t have taken that Demon Subduing Copper Rods. Now I can’t explain things properly. If any of them said something wrong, he might detest my family. I can only claim they escaped…”

Yuan Chengdun’s weapons were Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts, and a pair at that. Naturally, Han Shizhen had been tempted. Now, he could only go along with his lie. After waiting outside for a moment, he stepped back inside. Putting on a smile, he said apologetically, “Daoist! It was my carelessness. Those men sold their goods and immediately scattered in all directions without staying for a moment… As for the Demon Subduing Copper Rods, it is beyond our reach.”

It seems Yuan Chengdun truly has perished. Li Xizhi sat at the head of the hall, holding his teacup, but he did not believe a word of it. He thought in his heart, Han Shizhen, you’ve established yourself in the Eastern Sea, you're no benevolent figure. Upon learning of a Foundation Establishment Realm inheritance, you must have fabricated an excuse to capture those rogue cultivators. You just wanted to keep that pair of Foundation Establishment artifacts for yourself.

Li Xizhi had no desire for those artifacts, so he didn’t bother exposing him. Instead, he casually waved his hand and asked, “Is there any news about that location?”

Han Shizhen immediately answered, “Fortunately, my men asked beforehand. We already know its location.”

“Then let us depart.” Li Xizhi rose and said softly, “In that case, I must trouble you to collect those Demon Suppressing Stones. My family had some ties with Senior Yuan Chengdun. Sending them to Mushroom Forest Plain would at least fulfill a portion of that bond.”

Having already taken the Demon Subduing Copper Rods, Han Shizhen was feeling uneasy and dared not say more. He nodded repeatedly and led the way as they rode the wind, heading toward the Qunyi Strait.

Li Xizhi pondered along the way, flying far into the Qunyi Sea. The vast ocean stretched before them, with the golden crow sun hanging high, its scorching rays blazing down. Below them, on the scattered islets, the sea tribes looked up one by one.

Han Shizhen, accompanied by a burly man, flew straight toward a location within the vast seascape. He came to a slow stop above the water without even surveying the surroundings before cupping his fists and saying, “Family Head, Daoist, this is the place!”

Han Shizhen’s expression flickered, while Li Xizhi suddenly understood, thinking to himself, So they searched their souls… Those rogue cultivators must already be dead.

Han Shizhen carefully observed Li Xizhi. Seeing his expression remain unchanged, he finally gestured and said, “Daoist… please proceed…”

The three of them split up, flying down in different directions. After searching for several days, Han Shizhen finally came to a slow stop on the ocean floor and found nothing.

He paused several times, gradually losing motivation. Li Xizhi’s matters had nothing to do with him as he was only acting out of self-interest. He had his eyes on that secret realm, which was the only reason he had been willing to assist.

Now, waiting idly, he sat down beside a reef. Suddenly, a pair of long boots appeared before him.

The boots shimmered in a deep blue hue, silver-bright, their intricate craftsmanship and ornate patterns revealing them as anything but ordinary. Han Shizhen had no time to marvel, his initial surprise instantly turned into sheer terror.

This is…! His thoughts flickered like lightning in his mind. He hurriedly looked up, meeting a pair of emerald-green eyes and was so terrified that he immediately pleaded, “This humble one greets… greets the great demonic beast, Muhai…I…”

He stammered a couple of words, but suddenly, all sorts of illusions surged before his eyes. The water and sky around him trembled violently before he plunged into a deep and overwhelming darkness.

----

Li Xizhi naturally found nothing except for a few pieces of Demon Suppressing Stone on the seabed, which he collected one by one before pausing in the depths of the ocean.

With a secret realm like this, how could a mere Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator possibly find it without a specialized method?

He settled atop a reef, closing his eyes to cast a spell to summon his Immortal Mirror. But suddenly, his scalp tingled and his entire body trembled. The core within his qihai acupoints quivered slightly, forcing him to stop.

Li Xizhi hesitated momentarily before reopening his eyes, only to meet a pair of emerald-green pupils directly.

Standing right in front of him was a middle-aged man with sharp, narrow eyes and wild, flame-colored hair. His robe shimmered in gold, resembling the glimmer of scales. He was so close, barely a fist's distance, that Li Xizhi could feel the cold radiating from him.

Those emerald-green pupils stared at Li Xizhi icily, reflecting his own gray-black eyes within them.

In his hands, he held two severed heads, their empty eyes staring blankly at the sky. Their expressions strangely carried a hint of joy. One had neatly combed hair, while the other’s beard and hair were wildly disheveled.

“It’s Han Shizhen and his retainer!” muttered Li Xizhi.

It had only been a few days since they had separated, yet both men had met a violent end. Li Xizhi’s hair stood on end as he watched the radiant energy of the opponent’s divine powers flow like liquid from his feet, spreading like lightning and enveloping him instantly.

“A Purple Mansion Realm… cultivator…” said Li Xizhi.

He was completely immobilized and could only meet the cold gaze of this Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. The man narrowed his eyes slightly, but when he spoke, his voice was clear and bright, it was utterly unfitting for his fierce appearance. “Who sent you… Si Boxiu or Tang Yuanwu?”

Li Xizhi watched as the divine energy swirling around him turned a deep azure, casting a brilliant blue glow over his face. His thoughts flickered like lightning, and he quickly answered, “Reporting to the Daoist Master! It was none of these two.”

The Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master slowly halted, revealing a strange expression. His emerald eyes blinked slightly, their hue deepening as if he had gleaned a great deal from Li Xizhi’s body. His red hair floated in the water as he sneered inwardly, Quite the audacity!

His gaze darkened, making it impossible to discern his true thoughts. As if suddenly amused, he chuckled and asked, “Was it Sui Guan?”

Li Xizhi, however, shook his head and respectfully replied, “This junior came of his own accord. My master has been missing for over a decade, yet the sect has remained unresponsive. It was my duty to seek him out personally. I had no intention of offending you, Senior.”

The Purple Mansion Daoist Master listened to his words, his gaze gliding coldly over Li Xizhi. His golden robe shimmered as he responded, “Someone wants you dead.”

Upon seeing the severed heads in his hands, how could Li Xizhi fail to grasp the situation? Green Pine Island had been given to him to guard, it was a prime location, conveniently granting him access to the Eastern Sea. Someone in the sect must have been waiting for this very moment! As long as he died swiftly, Qingsui Peak would inevitably fall into the hands of the Yuan Family!

Clearly, those rogue cultivators came and went without issue, there must be some kind of restriction or agreement in place! Chi Zhiyun must have suppressed the information, keeping it secret, just waiting for me to walk straight into this trap!
