# Chapter 1046: Variables in the Path of Cultivation

Li Zhouwei’s words reached Li Jianglong, who looked up and replied, “Thank you for your high regard, my lord. With turmoil stirring in both the north and south, it is my good fortune to be able to alleviate the burdens of my royal father, of Ting Province, and of the Song Court…”

Yang Ruiyi listened with a smile and shook his head, helping the young man to his feet. He then turned to Li Zhouwei, his expression growing serious.

“King Wei is injured and should not be disturbed,” he said. “However, the matter of the Song Court is of great importance. The Emperor holds you in high esteem and sent me personally to discuss the affairs of the Purple and Gold Palace… I was concerned that if you were to enter seclusion to heal… a celestial decree from the court would arrive and disturb you yet again.”

“His Majesty is most considerate. Ting Province is deeply grateful for his favor.”

Li Zhouwei offered a polite reply, then glanced at Li Jianglong, who stood quietly to the side. He nodded. “When you go to the Imperial Capital… you can see your brother as well.”

Li Jianglong’s eyebrows rose.

“Yes, Father,” he replied respectfully, saying nothing more.

Since Yang Ruiyi did not intend to stay long, Sima Yuanli and the others prepared to return and report on their mission. After they all took their leave, the mountain peak fell silent, with only the soft whisper of the wind remaining.

Li Zhouwei remained seated at the table, lost in quiet contemplation. After a while, a subordinate came up the mountain to report that the old master had arrived to see him.

“Show him up.”

Li Xuanxuan, who usually wore ink-blue robes, was now dressed in white with a simple cloak. He hurried up the mountain path, his expression hesitant as he saw Li Zhouwei.

“Daoist Master,” he asked, “how are your injuries?”

Whether it was Li Ximing or Li Zhouwei, Li Xuanxuan rarely used their given names, almost always addressing them as Daoist Master first. Li Zhouwei smiled faintly.

“It’s nothing serious.”

Moongaze Lake had suffered heavy casualties, and Li Zhouwei’s prolonged absence had left people unsettled. His injuries were a highly sensitive topic, and only Li Xuanxuan was in a position to come and ask directly. After listening to Li Zhouwei gravely recount his conversation with Yang Ruiyi, the old man finally sat down at the table, his face a mask of shock.

“A Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace…”

Everything Yang Ruiyi had said was a heavy blow, one destined to unleash a tempest across the Yue State, upend the existing order, and draw out countless ambitious souls. After hearing the full account, the old man offered an explanation of his own.

“If the Song Court truly possesses the ability to bestow such titles, granting a divine empowerment like that of the Merciful One, I fear ninety-nine percent of cultivators would be unable to resist the temptation.”

Li Zhouwei closed his eyes, his voice thoughtful. “Yang Ruiyi’s meaning was quite clear. The matter of the Purple and Gold Palace is already decided. He was showing me respect by bringing it to the mountain to discuss with me in advance.”

The old man considered this as Li Zhouwei continued.

“If he had kept this from me and waited until I was in seclusion, with no one here to make decisions, he could simply issue a decree granting titles to Jiangxia and Jianglong and summoning them to Simin. We would have no room to maneuver. He wasn't worried they wouldn't go; he was worried about making things too ugly.”

Although Li Zhouwei had not spent every day with his sons, he knew the temperament of those with the golden eyes. No matter how their personalities differed, they were all naturally ambitious and power-hungry. The title from the Purple and Gold Palace was too prestigious to refuse. Once the order was given, Li Jiangxia and Li Jianglong would surely go.

“He specifically mentioned Jiangxia. If nothing changes, a position will be waiting for him sooner or later.”

His golden eyes glinted.

“With them gone, the lake will be easier to guard.”

Faced with Li Zhouwei, Li Ximing was often silent. But the old man, Li Xuanxuan, seemed more at ease than Daoist Master Zhaojing. 

He sighed.

“Minghuang… Moongaze Lake is too shallow to hold them. You alone are already constrained, unable to move freely. How could it possibly contain all those brothers, especially with a father such as you?”

“I understand.”

Li Zhouwei’s expression was calm, the flicker of hopeful disappointment having long since vanished, replaced by a cold clarity. 

“Both Li Jianglong and Li Jiangxia possess an independent streak. They despise being restrained. It is only my divine ability that keeps them in check, forcing them to suppress their friction as if they were in a cage.”

He spoke quietly.

“Emperor Gong of Wei had a reputation for benevolence, yet he still couldn't avoid subjugating his own brother, gifting him a bracelet as one would a slave. The descendants of the Bright Yang are bound to resent one another. They cannot coexist peacefully under their father's rule. The more powerful the Sovereign Father, the more they will feel compelled to fight to the death.”

“It’s not obvious now, but once they attain their own divine abilities, I won't be able to suppress them any longer. They are bound to cause trouble. Perhaps this matter with the Song Court is a good thing—let them go and make their own way.”

The higher Li Zhouwei’s Dao-Profundity grew, the deeper his understanding of the Bright Yang became. His words left the old man speechless. But Li Zhouwei’s expression turned grim.

“Especially Qian’er… He harbors resentment for his two younger brothers as well. If he didn't cultivate the Radiant Fire, their relationship would have already been irreconcilable. There can only be one Sovereign Father, and his descendants will scheme to be his only true son. Only then can they hope to one day replace him. The bright golden eyes… they all represent the same ambition.”

“To supplant and replace.”

He set down his cup.

“I am the same,” he whispered.

Li Xuanxuan’s lips parted several times, but no words came out. He was silent for a long moment, suddenly understanding why Li Zhouwei had been reluctant years ago to let Li Jianglong and the others be officially entered into the Li Clan’s generational records. Anxiously, he pushed his cup forward.

“Jiangqian… Jiangqian should be better!”

Li Zhouwei knew what the old man meant.

“He believes himself to be unique, that I have only one true son and the others are false,” he said quietly. “Otherwise… he wouldn't be the way he is today. But the root of his nature, the core of his heart—that cannot be erased.”

The two sat in silence for a time before Li Zhouwei changed the subject.

“What of the casualties by the lake?”

Li Xuanxuan let out a long sigh.

“The losses were tragic, but not enough to shake our foundation.”

The old man’s voice was low.

“This time was different from the attacks a few years ago. Most of the fallen were at the Embryonic Breathing stage or were mortal soldiers. The Buddhist cultivators and the Zhao army from the north were more interested in people. They either took them captive or killed them on the spot to harvest their blood. We only lost a dozen or so at the Qi Refining level, and about thirty with mixed Qi. Four at the Foundation Establishment Realm fell… two of them were men from the Song Court stationed in the Wilderness.”

“Of the remaining two, one was a rogue cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Realm who was training by our lake on the north shore. The other loss was more significant: Chen Yang’s own son, the eldest of the Chen Clan’s direct line, Chen Jinxi.”

“As for the heavily wounded, Qu Bushi and White Ape have been saved. Zhouda is able to walk again. Ding Weizeng and Li Minggong suffered only minor injuries…”

Li Zhouwei raised his eyebrows in surprise.

“Chen Jinxi…”

The Chen Clan’s prestige rested solely on Chen Yang. Chen Jinxi had been their great hope, and his death was a crippling blow to their strength. For Moongaze Lake, however, as long as the core family members were alive, their foundation remained unshaken.

He nodded. “The Chen Clan will need to be appeased. With Li Jianglong leaving the island, the family will need a pillar of strength. Do you have anyone in mind, old master?”

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard, pondering.

“By my calculations, Jiangzong should be coming out of seclusion soon. But the north shore is drenched in blood, and the turmoil in the family cannot wait… We’ll need Li Minggong to hold things together temporarily. Zhouming can be reckless, but his wife Shouyu is capable. Let Chen Yang and Jiangxia assist them.”

In truth, even if Jiangzong were already out of seclusion, he would still need to consult Li Minggong in a situation like this, so it made little difference. Li Zhouwei understood and nodded.

“My injuries prevent me from dividing my attention with family matters. I must ask you, old master, to guide them.”

He closed his eyes for a moment. The profound rhythm of the Dao was still flowing through his spiritual sense, seeming to resonate with something in the Great Void, further solidifying his Dao-Profundity.

He raised a hand and produced a Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill. He dropped it into a teapot, tapped it lightly with a fingertip, and intoned an incantation:

“Give rise to the three yang, bring forth the light of spring. Let the Heart-Sutra blend with the medicine, to purify Qi and nourish the spirit.”

The clear tea in the pot instantly transformed. The generative power of the Bright Yang descended, coalescing into a pure white medicinal liquid. Li Zhouwei passed the pot to the old man.

“This brew is a concentration of the Bright Yang’s life-giving force. Within a day, it can regenerate limbs and restore Qi and blood. Take it down and distribute it among them. Have Sun Bai administer it according to the severity of their injuries. If any of the medicine’s power remains, it can be vented through intercourse. But they must not consume more than a single mouthful, or they risk the danger of their vital essence draining away.”

After this great battle, especially with the deaths of Taixi and Chiluo providing him feedback, Li Zhouwei’s Dao-Profundity, which had been just short of a breakthrough, finally took that crucial step. He had now surpassed the likes of Helian Wujiang and stood second only to the Great Daoist Masters!

‘My Dao-Profundity is already comparable to a Purple Mansion cultivator of average talent who has spent their entire life in diligent study. I even have some ability to make my words become law through intent! Back then, my great-uncle needed to find Sumian to heal Ding Weizeng, but now, I have no such need!’

He could now manifest all sorts of wondrous items imbued with the nature of the Bright Yang, though they would only last for a day at most. As his Dao-Profundity grew, the power of his divine abilities had subtly increased, and his healing and Qi circulation had become more efficient.

Beyond that, the speed at which he could master spell arts had risen dramatically, and he could faintly touch upon a much higher threshold of understanding.

‘If I advance one more step, reaching the realm beyond the Purple Mystery, where my divine abilities are truly my own—perhaps even the level of Chi Buzi or Changxiao—every move I make will be as powerful as a common third or fourth-grade Dharma Art. With careful study, I could even write my own third-grade arts. Only techniques of the fifth or sixth grade would be worth my time to cultivate…’

Though a third-grade Dharma Art might not seem high-level, it was a clear dividing line. The Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao was born from the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature. Its cultivation methods and Dharma Arts all had ancient origins, most of them modified from older Daoist Traditions by later generations. Some arts were even used without any modification at all. For modern cultivators, their very foundation was built upon the work of their predecessors, a structured path designed to lower the barrier to entry. How could they possibly forge a new way? Writing one's own methods and arts was astonishingly difficult. A third-grade art was already an incredible achievement. People like Chi Buzi and Changxiao were all candidates for pursuing the Golden Core realm!

As Li Zhouwei made this assessment, his mind cleared.

‘Only cultivators with the Dao-Profundity and comprehension of Chi Buzi or Changxiao would be qualified to practice the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature from childhood. And even then, nine times out of ten, they wouldn’t achieve as much as they would with the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao.’

‘It’s a pity that the Illuminating Sun and Moon technique requires me to vanquish divine ability masters and defeat demonic Buddhists, and I let Mingxiang and Gongsun Bei escape… But no matter. A day will come when they cannot run.’

As he pondered this, he gave his instructions. Li Xuanxuan, naturally prioritizing his recovery above all else, did not linger and hurried back down the mountain. Li Zhouwei saw him off with a final reminder.

“When I enter seclusion, place Jiangxia on the eastern shore. If any envoys from the Song Court arrive, let him make his own decisions. He need not report to the clan.”

The old man scurried away. Li Zhouwei then activated his divine ability, his eyes flaring with sudden light. A torrential wave of dharma power surged through him as roiling umbral flames ignited, suppressing the Dawn Qi within his body. Strands of Pure Qi began to emerge, repairing his wounds.

The battle had brought an unexpected boon.

‘The Profound Qi truly is effective at dispelling Dawn Qi. It helped me a great deal… Perhaps it’s because the Great Qi, the source of the Dawn Qi, was destroyed by the Great Liang, and the Profound Qi is from the Great Liang’s Daoist Tradition…’

He frowned, deep in thought.

‘It seems the origins of the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts are far from simple. It must be a secret art of the Touba Family. If it’s so precious, how did it fall into the hands of a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator in my grandfather’s domain back then… and how did it happen to be the perfect method for suppressing Dawn Qi?’

Li Zhouwei did not believe in coincidences. Since he had obtained it in the Eastern Sea, the most likely culprits were the Dragon-kin. But he had been just a newborn at the time. The only power that could have reacted so quickly… was the Underworld.

But these matters were no longer important. With the help of the Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body, his Perilous Tread ability resonated with his Talisman Qi, and when amplified by the Profound Vastness Art, Li Zhouwei was confident he could shorten his healing time to less than a year. If he also used the spiritual resources from Yang Ruiyi, he could likely be fully recovered in just over six months.

The damage to his Primal Summit Armour was also of no concern. The armour was forged from the Qilin-Crow Spirit Slough and possessed a miraculous ability to escape, which had been locked down by the Dawn Qi platform. It also had self-healing properties; he just needed to toss it into the baleful spring on Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

And though he hadn’t focused on cultivating his Sovereign's Perilous Tread these past two years, it had neared perfection on its own, growing stronger with each danger he overcame, his deepening connection to the White Qilin’s fate, and the rise of his Dao-Profundity and Talisman Qi!

“Give me a year or so, and not only will I have healed all my injuries, I can begin cultivating the Crimson Severing Arrowhead!”

The recent battle had instilled in him a profound sense of crisis. Li Zhouwei had come to a grim realization:

‘With Luoxia watching from the sidelines, the pressure from the north is only going to grow. This ferocious siege was likely just a probe. If I can't achieve a breakthrough in my divine abilities soon, the lake will become a river of blood!’

Although the Illuminating Sun and Moon technique was incredibly potent, there was a world of difference between slaying an opponent, merely suppressing them, or even being suppressed yourself. Li Zhouwei had gained little advantage against Mingxiang and Gongsun Bei this time. His cultivation would certainly continue to rise until he perfected his divine abilities, but the outcome of his Dao-Profundity would be completely different if the Buddhist cultivators calculated his strength and escaped every single time, versus if he managed to kill some of them in each major battle. The difference in the end would be as vast as heaven and earth!

‘With Luoxia refusing to intervene, the northern Buddhist cultivators will do everything they can to shorten my time to rest and cultivate… This last battle showed that they will never underestimate my strength. I must make them miscalculate… only then can I secure a kill.’

‘If that's the case, then according to the Song Emperor’s—or rather, the Northern Buddhists'—predictions, I should need five to ten years to heal. If I can break through to the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm in that time, I’m certain to gain the upper hand in the next major conflict. A victory, a kill, would further advance Illuminating Sun and Moon, allowing me to quietly accumulate enough Dao-Profundity… to increase my chances of pursuing the Golden Core.’

‘And both Jiangqian and Que'Wan have Talisman Seeds; their breakthrough times will be unexpected. If they both succeed, it will buy us more breathing room… If my great-uncle can advance further, to the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm… or if any of the talented juniors can reach the Purple Mansion… these are all variables…’

With a flick of his finger, he summoned a golden storage pouch from a nearby pillar. A waterfall of spirit rice poured out, vanishing into the demonic flames that blazed around him, continuously feeding his Dharma Body.

In that instant, he lowered his gaze, a different thought taking shape.

‘Luoxia’s refusal to participate is, in itself, a form of participation. It forces me to increase my cultivation level faster, which in turn shortens my preparation time… The north will not fear me until I become a Great Daoist Master. But the moment I do, I might have to face an eighth or even ninth-reincarnation Maha, or even masters who have perfected their divine abilities, like Changxiao and Wei Xuanyin! They want me to ascend to the throne in perfect form.’
