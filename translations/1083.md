# Chapter 1083: Crescent Moon

"Of course!"

The old man before him agreed readily. His words made Li Suining's expression darken. He began to pace back and forth in front of his immortal cave, his mind heavy with a single thought: 'Li Jieyi.'

Li Suining knew of Vast Cicada; he even knew his secular name was Li Jieyi. And any mention of Li Jieyi inevitably led to the Undefeated King of Brightness.

The Undefeated King of Brightness had been a major figure in the Great Liang, presiding over a small Buddhist Land. Although this Buddhist King was often associated with the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, he was never truly one of the Seven Aspects. He held a certain affinity for the ancient Buddhist cultivators and served as a crucial pillar of support for the Touba family.

When the Touba family claimed the imperial throne, he was the seventh-generation Maha. He achieved the rank of Dharma Master just before the fall of the Liang. Combined with his legendary small Buddhist Land, his power was nothing short of terrifying. Yet, his demise also came with the Liang's end.

'The last Liang Emperor drowned, but that was essentially the fall of their Emperor Wu... The Undefeated King of Brightness perished along with him. Could it be... they touched upon the Bright Yang Dao?'

The Undefeated King of Brightness was said to have fathered five "demon-sons," all monstrous fiends whom the Buddhist King personally slew and purified. This Li Jieyi was the descendant of the fifth of those sons. His ancestors had hidden within a great family during the fall of the Liang and managed to survive.

Li Suining knew these details so clearly because, in the future, Li Jieyi's reputation would become immense.

'Logically, he shouldn't have come south yet. He was supposed to appear as an opponent for King Wei during the northern campaign... until he appeared. The Great Peacock from the Way of Great Desire, the one known as "Yayoi's Rebirth"!'

Li Suining grew silent. Recalling it now still left him with an indescribable feeling. The Way of Great Desire, which had been consumed by internal strife for a millennium, suddenly erupted in a terrifying civil war. The chaos shocked the world, reaching a point where all restraints were abandoned and multiple Dharma Master-level figures openly revealed themselves!

The Way of Great Desire instantly rose to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Compassion Dao, contending for the supreme position among the Seven Aspects.

While this turmoil didn't directly involve the Li family, it completely shattered the existing power balance within the Seven Aspects.

The Maha Sparrow Carp Fish of the Way of Great Desire emerged from seclusion, his cultivation perfected. He brought three Buddhist Scions—born from the power of "Yayoi's Rebirth"—south with him, shaking all of Jiangbei. The event so alarmed the Compassion Dao, which had originally been content to watch, that they were forced to move south as well. This was the prelude to the great terror that became the Changhe Rebellion.

'And the part most relevant to the Li family... was one of those three Buddhist Scions: the Maha Antelope Trample, bearer of the Left Seat of Fear, whose secular name was Li Chengpan!'

Sparrow Carp Fish brought Antelope Trample south to confront Li Jieyi directly, intending to seize his small Buddhist Land. This move indirectly forced the Great Adoration Dharma Realm to throw its full support behind Li Jieyi, which was what ultimately elevated the man to his position as the Maha Vast Cicada.

'And now... he's come south this early!'

Li Suining mulled this over, but on the whole, he wasn't overly panicked. He had a theory:

'The change isn't because of Guest Retainer Ding. It's because of Daoist Master Zhaojing. He wasn't trapped in the Western Sea; he made a clean retreat. The situation changed from King Wei guarding the lake to the Daoist Master guarding it. Now, the northern cultivators who want his life won't just probe cautiously as they did in my past life. They'll launch aggressive, all-out assaults!'

'But with the Great Song providing cover, things won't get too out of hand. He wasn't stalled in the Western Sea, and the World's Radiance is already achieved! This is... a full decade earlier than it should be.'

Escaping the Western Sea had certainly drawn more enemies, but as long as Li Ximing was safe, it was all worth it. When he heard that Li Ximing had reached the Southern Borderlands unharmed, his heart finally settled.

'Overall, the major pieces haven't changed... This acceleration might not even be a bad thing!'

He had just calmed down when a new doubt surfaced.

'But this sealing of the mountain...'

This was not good. Li Suining had weathered countless storms in his past life, but he had never heard of such a drastic measure, one that amounted to confinement.

'Could it be... it happened in my past life, but wasn't as conspicuous, so I simply never heard about it?'

He silently entered his immortal cave and paced twice before his meditation cushion.

'In my past life, Uncle Jiangchun did keep a low profile... but I could still go and see him. This... this feels different. It's as if _I'm_ the one no one is allowed to see...'

A chill crept into Li Suining's heart. He stood frozen for a long moment before his brow furrowed. 'Could it be... something went wrong? Does the Daoist Master suspect me?'

He immediately took a silk cloth from his sleeve, dipped a brush in ink, and after a moment's thought, penned a long, flowing letter of greeting.

In the letter, Li Suining mentioned his own breakthrough and then casually inquired about the mountain being sealed. This wasn't a difficult gambit. He might appear to be a reclusive Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, but with the experience of his past life and his keen understanding of the current political climate, he could easily discern the truth, no matter what excuse he was given.

He called the old man back in.

"Old Du, do you happen to know where my youngest uncle is?"

Although Li Jiangchun was a genius rarely seen in a generation, he was always extremely low-key and cautious. The old servant, Du Dou, replied,

"I only heard he is in the inner formation, sir. I do not know his exact location within it."

Li Suining instructed, "Take this letter. Place it in a storage bag and do not remove it. Go directly to the inner formation and have someone deliver it to him."

Du Dou nodded quickly and hurried out, leaving Li Suining to pace anxiously. He let out a silent sigh. 'I hope I'm just overthinking this.'

Du Dou took the letter and hurried down the mountain. He crossed the lake, reached the main island, and stopped a respectable distance from the entrance to the inner formation. He bowed deeply.

"Lord Chen, I request your assistance in delivering a letter for my master."

The cultivator guarding the formation entrance had a stern expression. His hair was completely white, and he sat cross-legged with his hands in a meditative seal, like an old monk lost in trance. Despite his advanced age, his back was ramrod straight. A longsword was strapped to his back. This was the elder, Chen Donghe.

Chen Donghe was a veteran of several generations and a son-in-law to the branch lineage, giving him terrifyingly high seniority. He should have been enjoying a peaceful retirement, but ever since Li Qiuyang's passing, the old man had grown restless and insisted on taking up duties. Li Jiangzong dared not slight him, and after much deliberation, had assigned him to guard this formation entrance.

His voice was a low rumble.

"You're from Suining?"

"Yes, Elder!"

Chen Donghe took the letter and meticulously inspected it, even using a wisp of the formation's power to scan it for threats. He then turned his gaze to Du Dou, noting his plain mourning clothes.

"So, the news of Li Jiman's passing has already reached you."

Du Dou, hearing this sudden statement, answered cautiously, "Reporting to the Elder, yes. The master has passed."

The "master" he referred to was Li Jiman. His cultivation had been low, but he was the Lord of Eastern Mountain Yue. He was, in fact, one of Li Xuanxuan's maternal grandsons, a political piece once used to stabilize the Eastern Yue region.

He possessed half Li-family blood and had enjoyed a full measure of mortal wealth and glory. He sat on his throne for nearly a century, so long that his own sons and grandsons were plotting rebellion, before he finally stepped down to pursue cultivation. Now, having failed in his attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, he had finally perished.

Because he was from the main branch, Li Jiangzong had arranged a funeral of high standard. The Dili family of the Northern Yue region even hung white mourning banners in distant solidarity.

Chen Donghe stroked his white beard, his aged face twitching.

"He should have tried sooner," he said, his voice raspy. "He waited far too long."

He tucked the letter into his sleeve, hesitated for a moment, and then turned and stepped into the great formation.

Chen Donghe had been guarding this post for some time, but he had rarely entered the formation himself. Those qualified to go inside came and went as they pleased, and they all politely greeted him. He made a point to memorize their faces, thinking proudly, 'All of them... the chosen geniuses of my family.'

Stepping inside now, his vision was filled with a zenith of swirling purple mist and brilliant golden formation-lines underfoot. The sheer power made him flinch. He walked between tall, dark-golden pavilions, passed through three successive array gates, and finally arrived before a pool.

The pool was roughly ninety feet long. Its water was tranquil and clear, appearing no deeper than his knees. Nine bright lamps stood at its edge, casting a pale white light that seemed profoundly distant in the surrounding gloom, inspiring a sense of awe.

He looked up and saw a vast waterfall of pale purple mist pouring from the zenith. As it fell, it didn't splash but landed like soft cotton, piling up on the pool's surface. The circular jade platform in the center was empty.

But there _was_ a gleam of sword light.

The light drifted and bobbed, flashing in and out of sight. One moment it was a full moon, the next a waning crescent. One moment it was obscured as if by dark clouds, the next it was a field of pure radiance. Then, three streams of light, like flickering fish, merged into one within the cold lunar glow.

_Clang!_

The purple mist-fall was instantly severed. The top and bottom portions continued to flow, but a section in the middle had simply vanished. A crisp sword-hum echoed out, so sharp it made the old man dizzy.

"What is that!"

Chen Donghe stared, realizing the Li family was rising so fast that he, an elder, could no longer comprehend their methods. Suddenly, a soft voice called out nearby.

"Elder Chen!"

Chen Donghe spun around. A young man stood behind him, a pleasant smile on his face. He wore a white-feathered robe, green boots, and carried a cyan-bladed sword. The sight stunned the old man.

Chen Donghe was utterly terrified. A shivering cold pierced his very bones. He was suddenly lost, swept away in a turbulent river... He was squatting by dark, damp earth, a rough arrowhead clutched in his hand, the cold wind of early spring biting at him... The young sword immortal had only glanced at him, and his mind had been lost to the memory.

"Elder Chen?"

Li Jiangchun quickly steadied him and asked again. The voice pulled Chen Donghe back from the metaphorical river. He was drenched in a cold sweat, stammering,

"This junior... came to deliver a letter."

Li Jiangchun looked at him, surprised. He raised a hand and gently brushed it past the elder's face. The touch was like a spring breeze and a soft rain, instantly washing away the heart-pounding fear.

"Senior," he said warmly, "you should ask for some medicine to calm your heart-qi."

Chen Donghe nodded, still dazed. Li Jiangchun added reassuringly, "It is a common ailment of old age. Please don't worry."

The elder finally planted his feet firmly, gave the young man a deep bow, and handed over the letter. He retreated in a flurry, taking several steps back before glancing over his shoulder one last time. His heart ached.

'No wonder Li Xuanxuan favored him so much!'

Li Jiangchun watched him go, puzzled. He held the offered box, stepped forward into the drifting purple mist, and let out a long, heavy breath.

Only when his breath was fully exhaled did the purple waterfall resume its flow, crashing down with a roar and transforming into a dense, swirling purple cloud that billowed around him, making his feathered robes rustle.

From within the mist, three motes of agile moonlight emerged, circling him like living things. The lights were tapered at the front and round at the back, like bright feathers rippling with cyan-white light. In unison, they flipped and transformed into three bright, spiritual sparrows, alighting on his shoulders.

This was his Sword Origin—Crescent Moon.

In terms of Way of the Sword inheritance and Daoist Tradition dharma power, Li Jiangchun was the descendant most similar to the ancestor known as Moon Pavilion. His own dharma power was, however, ultimately different. It was Lesser Yin, not Supreme Yin, and thus possessed a more reserved, not-quite-full quality. For this reason, he had named it Crescent Moon.

Li Jiangchun had possessed his Sword Origin for some time now. In the intervening years, he had not only refined it and mastered the Autumn Moon's Accord, but most importantly, he had advanced his Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record—a technique for which he had painstakingly laid a foundation before Foundation Establishment—to the point where he could actively cast its arts!

Just using the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record was no simple feat. A cultivation art this profound and revered was typically something one only began to study upon reaching the Purple Mansion Realm.

'Once the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record is active, its two core components, "Treading the Mansion Water" and the "Long-March Pheasant Flame," operate automatically. They complement each other, generating wondrous effects and cultivating on my behalf. That's not even mentioning their myriad divine uses in combat!'

He had cultivated this art early for good reason. First, his primary cultivation method was an ancient one, leaving him at a severe disadvantage in terms of secret arts; he _needed_ the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record to compensate for his Dao-Profundity. Second, he was aiming to comprehend Sword Intent. He would likely be remaining in the Foundation Establishment Realm for a long time. The sooner he mastered this art, the more time he would save in the long run.

Even more incredible was the very pool at his feet.

It had been refined from the Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew and was infused with Supreme Yin Moon Radiance. This meant that his Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record was perpetually benefiting from a pool of spiritual resources equivalent to the Lesser Yin of a Purple Mansion Realm expert!

Even with Li Jiangchun's considerable worldliness, he couldn't help but marvel at his circumstances.

'Even a Golden Core-level power could offer little more than this. That Qiushui and Qing Jifang... they probably have this exact level of treatment. Being here is like constantly cultivating in a Mystic Realm. For years, I've focused only on my spell arts and haven't actively cultivated at all, yet I've already reached the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm.'

If he wished, he could take a Talisman Pill right now and instantly break through to the late-Foundation Establishment Realm.

He knew this was all possible due to the Immortal Artifact and the Nine Mounds Daoist Tradition—a lineage already approaching the level of a Golden Core power. The luxury was extreme, and Li Jiangchun felt a tremor of anxiety.

'My only fear is that I will fail to meet the family's expectations.'

He silently lifted his sleeve and opened the box. As he read the letter, a look of delight crossed his face.

'Good news! He's already broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Such speed...'

But as he read on, his expression turned strange.

The matter concerning Li Suining had been a direct order from the Daoist Master. At the time, with the trouble on the island, Li Ximing had left in a hurry. But later, the old patriarch Li Xuanxuan had also come to him, clearly nervous. The truth was, Li Jiangchun trusted Li Suining a great deal.

But trust was one thing, orders were another. He took out a brush and, after a moment's thought, smiled and began to write his reply.

His own letter was also filled with confusion. He claimed he, too, was confined to the inner formation, unable to leave, and that his suffering was terrible—he didn't even have a single attendant. He finished by tactfully asking: "Since you, Suining, still have people at your disposal, I must ask you to gather any news and inform me!"

He put away the brush. One of the sword-sparrows on his shoulder immediately snatched up the reply and darted out of the formation. Li Jiangchun took up his sword again and moved through his forms. He practiced for a while before stopping abruptly, as if struck by a sudden insight.

'That's it. I never leave this place. No wonder my Sword Origin is progressing so slowly! My ancestor either slew powerful experts, pacified the Southern Sea, or slaughtered countless Demons. I'm just here, trying to build a chariot behind closed doors. I'm lucky to have made any progress at all!'

He instantly sheathed his sword, letting it rest in the heavy purple mist. He then took out the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record to cultivate.

'The Way of the Sword... it needs to see blood.'
