# Chapter 446: Li Fire Spear

Li Qinghong had just arrived at the courtyard when she noticed a female cultivator standing quietly there, holding the hand of a little girl. Her face was veiled with spirit gauze. Upon seeing Li Qinghong, she greeted him with a warm smile.

"You're here, Qinghong!"

The woman, Xiao Guiluan, appeared to be in her twenties despite her actual age being over forty. It was no surprise as the Xiao Family was an immortal clan and she was at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

"Hello, Sister-In-Law," Li Qinghong replied with a gentle nod as a smile involuntarily appeared on her face. The generations of Yuan and Qing were all very close to each other. Xiao Guiluan, both tactful and capable, had always maintained a harmonious relationship with her in-laws.

The little girl, Li Yuexiang, was Li Yuanjiao's youngest daughter. She affectionately hugged Li Qinghong and called her auntie sweetly.

"Have you been studying well, Yuexiang?" Li Qinghong asked gently.

Xiao Guiluan turned to Li Qinghong with a smile and asked, "You've reached the eighth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm at just forty-two or forty-three, right?"

"That's correct," she responded with a nod.

"You might establish your foundation by fifty then... you truly are a prodigy," Xiao Guiluan praised.

The later stages of Qi Cultivation demanded substantial time, often at least five years. Unfamiliar with talisman pills, Xiao Guiluan estimated that Li Qinghong would reach the Foundation Establishment by fifty. However, Li Qinghong herself believed that she could achieve it by forty-five.

The women conversed for a bit before Li Qinghong frowned and said, "I don't understand why my brother went into seclusion without saying a word... It's unlike him."

Xiao Guiluan shook her head and began, "In the Xiao Family history, out of 376 Qi Cultivators breaking through to Foundation Establishment, 170 did so abruptly, without prior notice. When one's spiritual energy is ripe, unless suppressed by secret techniques from immortal sects, it's often best to break through immediately."

Li Qinghong furrowed her brow, prompting further explanation from Xiao Guiluan.

"Our elders are baffled too. After years of investigation, they learned of a rumor circulating among the three sects that may be tied to the activity of Metallic Essence. Within the same Dao lineage, it's common for several members to establish the same immortal foundation within a few years. Yet, curiously, after some more years, several among them may fail..."

Li Qinghong nodded gently, her keen intellect evident as her eyes lit up. She then spoke thoughtfully, "Mastering the activities of Metallic Essence could significantly enhance the chances of our disciples' breakthroughs. If one could cultivate Metallic Essence effectively then that means..."

They could control the Dao lineage at will? To determine who achieves breakthrough...

She suddenly fell silent and looked at Xiao Guiluan, only to notice a subtle shift in her expression. The two exchanged a silent, knowing look.

No wonder the prestigious clans of the Xu State were decimated by a reincarnated being... Just the sight of a hint of Metallic Essence instills terror in anyone...

The two stood quietly in the courtyard, listening to the soft flowing sound of spring water flowing nearby. Xiao Guiluan continued in a gentle voice, "Those are probably just false rumors... In the ancient texts, no sect within the first three hundred years has mentioned any Dao lineage that could control foundation establishment."

Looking at the shimmering water ripples in the cave dwelling while engaging in their speculative conversation, they were startled by a sudden loud explosion.

BOOM!

The sky outside the courtyard burst into a brilliant display, with clouds turning a radiant gold. Streams of light danced through the air as numerous mana lights streaked across the sky. Li Qinghong looked up and swiftly ascended, riding the wind upward.

The golden lights in the sky merged into the distant red hues of sunset and the brilliance in the east shone intensely for several moments before gradually fading away.

More mana lights appeared, belonging to cultivators of various sizes and colors, all converging toward the east.

Li Qinghong hovered and observed for a moment before a cultivator in the early stages of the Qi Cultivation Realm approached. Li Qinghong stopped him with her spear raised, prompting a look of annoyance from the man. However, upon recognizing her advanced cultivation realm at the eighth heavenly layer, he quickly softened his tone.

"What assistance may I offer, fairy?" he asked.

"If I may inquire, fellow Daoist... What is happening in the east?" Li Qinghong asked.

The cultivator, impatient yet respectful, responded swiftly, "Senior must have been in seclusion for a long while. This spectacle marks the collapse of a grotto heaven, likely the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven in Yufu Prefecture that has been the recent talks. If you're heading there, perhaps you could bring me along."

"Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven?" Li Qinghong pondered aloud.

Li Xuanxuan often relayed the news from Kong Yu to everyone in the family. When Li Qinghong learned that the disturbance originated from Yufu Prefecture, she shook her head slightly and quickly made up an excuse.

"This sounds too good to be true! The three sects and seven gates have probably claimed everything... As long as the grotto heaven's forbidden mechanisms remain intact, we are just pawns being used as scouts."

The rogue cultivator shook his head and replied, "You must be joking, Senior! How could we simply enter the grotto heaven? The spiritual energy released upon its fall scattered various essences like spiritual qi, spirit water, and spirit fire across Mount Dongli. There's plenty to go around for those who simply wish to gather spirit materials and depart."

Li Qinghong frowned slightly but allowed him to pass. Xiao Guiluan caught up and gazed toward the east, then explained, "It must be Chu Yi, the Li Fire Spear, who opened the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven... That incident had indeed caused quite a stir. Judging by the date, this was expected."

Puzzled, Li Qinghong asked, "Where did this Li Fire Spear come from? I've never heard of this Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator."

For someone like Li Qinghong who had a passion for spears, it seemed improbable that she would be unaware of a notable spear-wielding Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator.

Xiao Guiluan explained, "You may not know, Qinghong, but this person only rose to fame recently. He received the legacy of the Dongli Sect at a young age and achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm by thirty-one and is considered a top-tier genius."

"Chu Yi was originally a rogue cultivator from Yufu Prefecture. After his legacy was exposed, he was framed by the Han Family of the local clans. Within just a few years, he achieved a breakthrough and eliminated two Foundation Establishment Realm ancestors in Jiangnan. His reputation has resonated throughout the region, earning him the nickname Li Fire Spear."

She paused briefly before adding, "Now, all of Jiangnan is aware that he has the legacy of Dongli Sect... It's also widely rumored that he will soon enter the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven."

After absorbing this information, Li Qinghong mused internally, Such a genius! He must be a True Monarch...

As she contemplated this, an elderly man with a wrinkled face and white hair ascended hastily. His expression was anxious as he called out, "Hong'er, you must not go!"

Li Qinghong flew toward him and smiled reassuringly.

"Uncle, you worry too much! Qinghong is not one to be blinded by greed," she replied.

Xiao Guiluan also approached, respectfully greeting the man.

"Father!"

Li Xuanxuan sighed softly and said, "Indeed, you are not one to act rashly, but you'll never know if any divine ability is at play. I fear you might be led astray, just like Yu Yufeng was."

With concern on his face, he continued, "The moment I heard Chu Yi is Li Fire Spear, I was shocked. Despite all the news we've received, we never dared to interrupt your seclusion..."

The three then descended and seated themselves in the courtyard. Xiao Guiluan brought Li Yuexiang away as Li Xuanxuan continued speaking.

"As Guiluan mentioned, this Wander Fire Spear, Chu Yi, is likely the True Monarch awaited by the Azure Pond Sect. The Han Family's actions are merely a repeat of what the Kong Family faced."

"Outside of the three sects, seven gates, and a few immortal clans, most other families remain in the dark, clueless about the current state of affairs..." he added after a brief pause.

Li Qinghong stared at the mana light streaking across the sky, shaking her head skeptically.

"You're saying those are disciples from the three sects and seven gates that are heading there? Those lights seem enhanced by their escape spells... I don't think there are so many clans practicing escape spells..."

Li Xuanxuan paused when she said this, observing intently. Realizing that Li Qinghong was right, he grew puzzled too.

"But Kong Yu didn't look like he was lying," he said with a frown.

Li Qinghong reflected a moment before saying, "Kong Yu mentioned that disciples from the three sects and seven gates were barred from entering for three years... Now, those three years have elapsed."

Li Xuanxuan exhaled, grasping the unspoken implications, and responded, "You mean... Chu Yi is most dangerous before completing his foundation establishment...? Once he completes it and opens the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven, things will stabilize...?"

Li Qinghong nodded slowly, adding softly, "I've considered Kong Yu's story. I find it hard to believe that this reincarnation is merely the Golden Core True Monarch's amusement... Just consider the Daoist Masters of Jiangnan‚Äîall of them are insightful and cunning. Do you think the Golden Core True Monarch, above the Purple Mansion Realm, would truly descend to the mortal world for amusement? Isn't such a reincarnated form inherently fragile?"

Li Xuanxuan nodded thoughtfully as Li Qinghong continued, "From a Qi Cultivator's perspective, things may appear one way, but from the vantage of the Purple Mansion or even the Golden Core Realm, it's entirely different..."
ùòßùìá‚ÑØùëíùìåùëíùëèùìÉùò∞ùò∑ùò¶ùò≠.ùí∏‚Ñ¥ùìÇ

"Although there are Purple Mansion Realm immortals, none established sects. Why was the Kong Family destroyed overnight, allowing Daoist Master Changxi to swiftly establish the Profound Peak Gate and secure a position in Yue State?" she added.

Chills ran down Li Xuanxuan's spine as he stammered, "Could it be Changxi... T-That's..."

Li Qinghong replied softly, "This situation is a disgrace in the eyes of the Kong Family... How do you know if it isn't Daoist Master Changxi's maneuvering?!"

Li Xuanxuan broke out in a cold sweat but urged, "Carry on..."

Li Qinghong hummed in response and continued softly, "I suspect that although the meteoric rise of the Li Fire Spear is portrayed as the True Monarch's reincarnation among the mortals, he's actually orchestrating something beneath the surface. The Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven likely serves as the reward he promised to the three sects... Meanwhile, the seven gates are merely kept informed, privy to the knowledge but not the power."

Li Xuanxuan nodded in realization and sighed.

"As for the rogue cultivators, they only see the surface, believing it to be Chu Yi's genius ascent... Had Kong Yu not informed me, my family would also remain oblivious..."

After piecing together their thoughts, Li Qinghong pursed her lips and added, "As for why Kong Yu confided in you, uncle... it seems he was extending an olive branch to our family. The Kong Family of Profound Peak Gate clearly harbors favorable intentions toward us."

Li Xuanxuan hesitated before whispering, "But still... Is there any way for our Li Family to profit from this?"

Meanwhile at the Azure Pond Sect...

The bamboo forest on Qingsui Peak swayed gently in the breeze. Standing amidst it, Li Xizhi's true essence radiated a faint purple-red glow, casting its hue on the bamboo shoots around him.

He practiced the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique, a Grade Four technique including six spells and three secret arts, ranging from the intricate footwork of Dawn Imperial Movement to the powerful spell Gold In Cloud, along with other escape spells and various techniques.

Although it had only been two years since Li Xizhi broke through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, he was already capable of beating three or four early-stage rogue Qi Cultivators single-handedly.

"So, this is the foundation of the three sects..."

Chuckling to himself, he re-read a letter from home.

"My family is prospering this year; they've even moved a mountain and named it Qingdu Peak. Surely, it wasn't Father who chose the name! I wonder when I'll be able to return to see it..."

As he mused on, a voice from the forest interrupted his thoughts.

"Senior Brother!"

Turning around, Li Xizhi saw a young lady dressed in black looking at him. She appeared to be seventeen or eighteen years old, with a warm smile on her delicate face. Li Xizhi cupped his fist and greeted her.

"Junior Sister Yang..."

This was Yang Xiao'er, a match made by Yuan Tuan from the Yang Family for Li Xizhi. With Imperial Cloud Peak's master, Yang Tianya, in seclusion, their planned meeting never materialized. In the end, she was sent over.

Her talents were modest and her looks were ordinary. She was usually quiet, but during the few times they met, she spoke warmly and adorably. As Li Xizhi often secluded himself for cultivation, they did not get to spend much time with each other.

Li Xizhi's response was tinged with unfamiliarity, but Yang Xiao'er seemed unperturbed. She continued smiling and said, "Senior Brother often cultivates in seclusion... It's rare for Xiao'er to see you."

Li Xizhi nodded slightly in agreement.

Yang Xiao'er stepped closer, saying, "Recently, there have been disturbances outside the sect. Have you heard about the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven?"

Li Xizhi's eyebrows rose in surprise the moment he heard this.

"Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven? Well, I've heard a little about it. There's talk of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator named Chu Yi the Li Fire Spear... Is this real?"

Yang Xiao'er nodded gently and replied, "Chu Yi must be a truly remarkable genius to be able to turn Yufu upside down as a rogue cultivator! My father warned that this man is quite unusual and should not be provoked, suggesting he must carry a special fate on him."

Li Xizhi nodded as he thought about writing home to his family about this matter.

Yang Xiao'er continued, "When the immortal gates of Wei State fled south, one of them established the Dongli Sect. The Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven is well-known, and its recent appearance has alarmed the cultivators of Wu and Yue States. The three sects and seven gates have already secured the grotto heaven, poised to break through its formations and enter... Yet, Chu Yi has already accessed it using secret techniques..."

As Li Xizhi sat quietly on the rock, listening to Yang Xiao'er's stream of news when she suddenly paused and asked, "I wonder how many of us from Qingsui Peak are here?"

After a brief calculation, Li Xizhi replied, "Probably just you and me."

"I see..." Yang Xiaoer said as she nodded, her expression turning resolute as she gazed directly at him.

Though not particularly striking, Yang Xiaoer had made an effort with her appearance, managing to look quite pretty. She raised her eyebrows and spoke with a hint of nervousness, "Senior brother, being from the sword immortal clans, you are handsome and talented. Xiao'er fears she isn't a suitable match for him. Although I've considered it... I don't wish to waste time."

Taken aback, Li Xizhi listened as she continued softly, "Xiao'er has been on this peak for two years... Senior Brother has never truly seen me... My talents are modest and my looks are plain. If Senior Brother is interested, I will dedicate my life to supporting him. If not, I will ask my father to annul our marriage."

Li Xizhi, surprised by her frankness, stared at her in silence before responding in a serious tone, "Xizhi is not such a person. Since we have shared our wedding wine, we are bound as husband and wife for life, with no second thoughts. The past two years were solely to strengthen our cultivation..."

He smiled shyly and added, "Moreover, I feared you might think... I was too frivolous."

Yang Xiao'er had braced herself for a range of reactions, but she had not anticipated such a response. Stunned for a moment by his sincerity, she stepped forward and kissed him on the cheek.

Without hesitation, she pulled a white dharma robe with black patterns from her storage pouch and offered it to him.

"This is the robe I requested from my clan. It can protect my life in critical moments. Please accept it, Senior Brother..."

Li Xizhi's face was tinged red and before he could recover from the surprise, a snowy white robe was presented to him.

"How could I possibly accept such a lavish gift... and this is a mid-quality Qi Cultivation Realm feather robe?!"

Feather armors were rare treasures. The Li Family possessed only one piece of Embryonic Breathing Realm jade armor, which was long since bestowed upon Li Qinghong as a treasured heirloom.

Now, holding such a precious dharma robe, Li Xizhi felt as if he was clutching a fortune in Spirit Stones.

This is worth two hundred Spirit Stones! No... possibly three hundred?

Yang Xiao'er gently pushed the robe into his hands and said with a smile, "This was part of my dowry from my father..."

"You..."

Li Xizhi looked into her eyes, which sparkled with joy, yet he felt a pang of melancholy.

She's so innocent and genuinely devoted to me...
