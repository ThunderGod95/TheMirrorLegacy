# Chapter 675: The Demon-Subduing Plot

Of all the world’s orthodoxies, Li Ximing despised the Northern Buddhists the most.

The stories of his ancestors, Li Xuanling and Li Tongya, had been repeated by his grandfather Li Xuanxuan hundreds of times, and the resentment still festered. Li Xuanfeng had also died besieged by monks, and even Li Xijun had nearly lost his life at their hands.

It had been the same during the northern and southern conflicts. He had only been cultivating for a short time when some Buddhist cultivator would show up at his door, screaming:

"Your family nearly killed mine back then! What now?"

And now, seeing Kongheng immobilized by this old monk's white light, the scene felt hauntingly familiar.

‘The Li clan of Wei brought about a golden age for the Bright Yang, only for it to be overthrown by the barbarians of the Northern Path,’ Li Ximing recalled. ‘It involved Golden Cores and Revered Ones. From that moment on, our fates became intertwined, a law of nature. Wherever the Bright Yang flourishes, a Buddhist master is sure to follow…’

Though he understood the reason for it all, he couldn't suppress the fury welling inside him. He had heard the monk’s overbearing words from a distance and knew better than to engage with their bewitching rhetoric. Letting the words go in one ear and out the other, he simply raised his Radiant Origin Pass and smashed it down.

Caught off guard, Fu Xia took the full brunt of the brilliant light. His face darkened for a moment before he raised a single hand to block the massive gate. The searing white bricks turned his copper-toned hand glowing red. The old monk’s eyes narrowed, and he spat, "Just as I thought! The Bright Yang path of rigid hierarchies and social order!"

The instant he spoke, Kongheng was freed. The Six-armed Vajra Guardian behind him opened its wrathful eyes, and a multitude of shimmering golden chains shot out to bind Fu Xia. Only then did Kongheng have a moment to catch his breath.

But as he recovered, Li Ximing’s attack slammed into its target. It felt like hitting a cold, unyielding stone. A wave of nausea washed over him, and he almost coughed up blood.

‘Tough old monk!’

Fu Xia, despite his casual appearance, had braced himself. A single punch from him sent a tremor through the immortal foundation of Li Ximing's technique. He squinted, studying his attacker for a moment before realizing.

'This is Li Ximing!'

Finally able to speak, Kongheng used his spiritual qi to re-form the scattered chains. The blast of white light had left his voice slightly hoarse, but he maintained his calm composure. "Venerable senior," he began softly, "you say that suffering creates a Revered One. Do the temple serfs, who toil their entire lives, truly become Revered Ones? And which Revered One do they become? They have no affinity for cultivation, no karmic wisdom from past lives. They rely solely on hardship and chanting a name to achieve the Dao, yet tens of thousands perish from hunger and exhaustion. I have never seen the scriptures mention a new Revered One of hardship and mercy, or a new Maha of chanted names!"

His voice, though quiet, carried the deafening force of spiritual law. "This Buddhist paradise you've built in the lands of Yan and Zhao—is it all just a colossal lie?"

An expression of utter disbelief spread across Fu Xia’s face. Kongheng’s words seemed to root him to the spot, stunning him into immobility.

Seizing the opportunity, Li Ximing’s eyes blazed with celestial light. The Radiant Origin Pass materialized in full, its white bricks perfectly laid, its crenellations exquisitely carved. The seventy-two ridges on its corner towers shone like the gates of heaven itself, and the base of the gate was covered in intricate, dazzling patterns.

Fu Xia had been arrogant, using only one hand to block the gate. But the Radiant Origin Pass was renowned for its power to grind down and suppress its targets. Li Ximing’s own cultivation was profound, and he had even mastered two secret arts to augment it. Now, pouring every last ounce of his strength into the attack, it was as if a sun had risen over Moongaze Lake.

*BOOM!*

With a deafening roar, Fu Xia was forced to use both hands to hold back the Pass, and he was completely engulfed in the overwhelming celestial light. The brilliance reflecting off his body pierced the lake below, vaporizing the water into clouds of white steam.

*Clang… clang…*

The golden chains from Kongheng’s technique flew out, wrapping around the monk in dense layers. The Six-armed Vajra Guardian pulled the chains taut, and a shower of sparks erupted from the sphere of white light. Cultivators hovering over the lake dove for cover, frantically searching for protective formations.

The old monk’s voice, a furious, thunderous roar, boomed from beneath the gate. "You… You dare to question the fundamental law of my righteous path?! You dare to question our fundamental law!"

Beneath the pass, the monk had transformed into a shining golden statue. His eyes were unnaturally large, the whites like jade and the pupils like copper, striking terror into anyone who met his gaze. His body began to swell, growing larger and larger as he gritted his teeth and pushed back with both arms.

*CRACK!*

Li Ximing felt his spiritual qi draining away as if being devoured by a whale. The Radiant Origin Pass began to wobble. In all his years of cultivation, he had rarely worried about exhausting his power; his recovery had always outpaced his expenditure. Gritting his teeth, he swallowed two pills and muttered, "Bring it on!"

Kongheng, though engaged in a debate of doctrine, was relentless with his techniques. While Fu Xia was pinned by the gate, he layered chain after golden chain onto the monk, even conjuring more out of thin air to bind him.

But Fu Xia paid the chains no mind. He stared blankly at Kongheng and snarled, "What did your master teach you?! Those people cannot cultivate. They endure a lifetime of hardship so they may go to Maha’s Pure Land… where they can enjoy eternal bliss!"

An incredibly complex expression crossed Kongheng's face, and for a moment, he was at a loss for words. Li Ximing watched, frustrated, and yelled, "If this bliss is so wonderful, why aren't you there enjoying it? Why do you linger in the mortal world? If being a temple serf is such a good thing, why did you start cultivating?"

Fu Xia let out a cold laugh. The celestial light was so bright his face was no longer visible, but his voice boomed, "Did you know that I was a temple serf in my youth?! My ancestors were serfs for generations, and they entered the Pure Land long ago. Back before the domain of the Warthful Subduer of the Four Demon Emperors was shattered… I even went to see them… and now you devils have killed them all!"

He continued, his voice ringing with conviction, "As for why I don't go to that paradise… what would a heretic devil like you know of our aspirations? When a cultivator like me is found to have a spiritual root, it is a calling from the Revered One himself! We cannot go to the Pure Land like common mortals. We are condemned to remain in this world and suffer, precisely to prevent devils and heretics like you from defiling our sacred lands!"

Li Ximing was stunned, unable to tell if the monk was lying or truly believed his own words. He glanced at Kongheng, only to find the young monk with his eyes shut tight, muttering sutras and focusing solely on his technique. He had stopped responding entirely.

'What is this… A renowned practitioner of the ancient Buddhist path can’t win a debate against him? Kongheng always tries to see the good in others; he’s far too honest…'

Li Ximing didn’t know that while Kongheng appeared calm, his mind was in turmoil. If they weren’t in the middle of a battle, he would have been drenched in a cold sweat.

Kongheng’s lineage was anything but ordinary. Though Liaohe Temple had fallen into decline, it was a place where a Revered One had once cultivated, and its status in the great desert was not low. When his master was still alive, he had dealings not just with the Merciful Ones, but with Mahas themselves.

Kongheng had been to the Pure Land. He had seen its jeweled pools, its lapis lazuli stairs, its lotus canopies, its thousands of birds and beasts, and its tens of thousands of souls living in contentment, able to travel outside when summoned. The experience, in his youth, had shaken him to his core, making him secretly question his own path.

'I’ve been able to read the hearts of others since I was a child. Those people were all filled with genuine joy… and Fu Xia is utterly devout… This…'

After Liaohe Temple fell, Kongheng traveled south and witnessed a thousand different tragedies across the lands of Yan and Zhao. Only then did he begin to grasp his master’s teachings. But Fu Xia’s words had stirred up all his old anxieties, leaving a knot of unspeakable conflict in his chest.

'Their methods are just too extreme, too tyrannical… Of the seven paths, if only they all had the same restraints as the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and the Path of Precepts and Austerity…'

The Great Adoration Dharma Realm and the Path of Precepts did not internalize paradise but used a method of conversion through holy light. They would chant sutras and preach, waiting until the common folk had accrued sufficient merit and were filled with yearning before accepting them. For this, they were known as a righteous path.

The other five paths, however, often didn't bother asking. They simply devoured the populace whole, a method that seemed horrifically cruel. It was this that gave Kongheng pause. If not for that, his faith might have already been shaken.

"Kongheng!" Li Ximing’s shout snapped the slender-eyed monk back to reality. The golden chains binding Fu Xia were stretched taut, and the Radiant Origin Pass was shaking violently.

While Kongheng was faltering, Li Ximing’s mind was racing.

He knew his own strength perfectly well. His prowess in a direct fight was one thing, but the grinding, suppressive power of his Radiant Origin Pass was another. At full power, even a direct disciple of the Three Sects would be in for a world of hurt.

Even if he were fighting Li Qinghong, her best strategy would be to avoid getting trapped beneath the gate in the first place. And here he was, with Kongheng at his side. The young monk’s Buddhist arts were anything but simple.

'The two of us, working together, have him pinned down and bound by countless chains. What Foundation Establishment cultivator could possibly withstand this?'

The pass was already pushed to its limit, yet the old monk hadn't budged. Though the celestial light burned his skin red, he endured it, seemingly using the pain as a form of ascetic practice.

Li Ximing’s spiritual qi surged as he sent a message to Kongheng's ear, "Master… this monk is incredibly powerful… Can you tell what’s going on?"

Kongheng murmured, replying with a secret transmission, "I fear it is what remains of the Merciful One. When the Wrathful Maha fell, this thing lost all its divine abilities, leaving only this Merciful One's Dharma Body…"

"A Merciful One's Dharma Body!"

Li Ximing had considered the possibility, but hearing it confirmed still sent a jolt of shock through him.

No matter how weakened, a Dharma Body was not something a Foundation Establishment cultivator should be able to face. Though its powers were gone, how could it be suppressed by ordinary means? The only reason they hadn't been crushed already was that the monk was likely focused on his own ascetic training; otherwise, he would have thrown off the gate and come at them with his staff long ago.

As they hesitated, Fu Xia exhaled a torrent of golden light. "Kongheng!" his voice boomed. "Wake up! Your spiritual root is unparalleled. Why lead yourself astray? I have allowed you to suppress me without resisting because I wanted more time to persuade you!"

A pillar of golden light shot from his body into the sky. The chains now encased him in a solid golden sphere, but the old monk was unafraid. He formed a lotus seal with his fingers, spat out a cloud of pink mist, and yelled, "Go!"

His deep yellow kasaya suddenly came to life. It fluttered like a scroll caught in a gale, and with two quick turns, the monk vanished from beneath the pass. A violent explosion of golden light bleached all color from their vision.

'It’s over!'

Being a Buddhist cultivator himself, Kongheng recovered from the flash far more quickly. His eyes cleared, and the Six-armed Vajra Guardian behind him surged forward, just in time to block a long staff that was sweeping down from mid-air. The collision created a brilliant flash of light and forced a trickle of blood from Kongheng’s lips.

As his vision cleared, he saw a dark-striped tiger pinned beneath the bright, patterned gate.

The tiger was magnificent, with a deep yellow coat and stripes as black as ink. It had white eyebrows and the same copper-colored pupils as Fu Xia. A short, black horn grew from between its brows, pulsing with a mysterious light.

"A horned tiger…" Kongheng’s face went pale, his voice laced with a bitter resignation. "Senior, you are a Dharma Protector at the Demon-Subduing Temple in the north. With your orthodoxy in peril, you should be guarding the mountain and teaching the people. Why travel thousands of miles to come here? If something were to happen to you, what would Abbot Fuyan do?"

The blow had temporarily robbed them of their sight and spiritual sense. Fu Xia’s staff was already in mid-swing, a strike that would have crippled or killed them. But Kongheng's words stopped him.

"You are indeed deeply connected to my northern Demon-Subduing Temple…" he said, his voice heavy.

Li Ximing’s vision finally returned. Fu Xia stood nearby, bare-chested. Though the tiger under the gate wasn’t struggling, the arcane light from its horn made Li Ximing's mouth taste like bitter herbs.

'Damn it…'

Fu Xia alone had been difficult enough. Now that he was free and standing nearby with his staff, how could they possibly keep the tiger pinned? The brilliant gate flew up and returned to Li Ximing’s hand.

The moment it was released, the horned tiger sprang up and landed at Fu Xia's side. The old monk mounted the beast, his skin coated in a golden sheen, his copper eyes fixed on Kongheng as he held his staff in silence.

The entire lake fell quiet, the air thick with tension. Li Ximing squinted at Fu Xia, a strange feeling rising within him.

Kongheng was an honest monk. He was young and bound by too many precepts to engage in schemes. But Li Ximing had seen his share of conspiracies and had been taught from a young age to be wary. Suspicion began to dawn.

'He's preying on Kongheng's honesty, constantly trying to sway him with words… He must be after something.'

'According to Kongheng, the northern Demon-Subduing Temple is in dire straits. Why would he come all this way? I don't believe for a second that he's just out for a stroll after the Wrathful Maha’s death… He has a reason for being here.'

The young man watched Fu Xia warily. The old monk ignored him, his gaze locked on Kongheng. "Kongheng," he said calmly, "since you know our temple’s abbot, you must also know that our path is a righteous one. This old monk does not wish to kill, which is why I allowed you to make your moves."

Kongheng finally opened his eyes. "I am aware of the senior’s great virtue…"

Fu Xia nodded. "Leave this place," he commanded from atop the tiger. "Join my order and return with me to the temple."

'So that's what this is about?'

Li Ximing lowered his gaze, carefully studying the monk's expression and replaying the events in his mind. Something wasn't right. Kongheng was already showing signs of hesitation, but Li Ximing sent a spiritual transmission.

"Kongheng, this monk talks too much. I suspect there’s something wrong with him."

Kongheng didn't see it. As he silently considered how to placate the older monk, he replied, "He wants to convert me to his path. Of course he needs to use many words to persuade me… If I refuse, I fear people will be harmed…"

'No… the Path of Wrath is reviled right now, like rats in the street… Why would he be so arrogant? His actions have been highly suspicious. Did he really just endure the full force of our attacks purely for the sake of ascetic practice?'

Li Ximing felt that Fu Xia was deeply suspicious, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it, his thoughts a frustrating haze.

'If only Xijun were here!' he thought with a pang of resentment. 'This old fox wouldn't stand a chance! He'd see through him in an instant!'

But Li Xijun was gone, and Li Ximing had no one to fall back on. He stared coldly at the monk, his spiritual qi flowing as he sent another secret message.

"Since he's made his intentions clear, he’s here for you. He certainly won’t harm you. We've only exchanged a few moves with him. Why should we surrender so easily? Let's test him again! It’s not too late!"
