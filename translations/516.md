# Chapter 780: True Essence

Thoughts raced through his mind like lightning. Since no one from the Li Family had spoken, Miao Ye had no choice but to continue and said quietly, “I came this time to resolve a certain misunderstanding...

“My family uncle... encountered a fairy from your esteemed family in the Eastern Sea and, upon suddenly seeing a senior’s dharma artifact, became overwhelmed with emotion.

“He’s reckless by nature and when he saw the spear, he couldn’t restrain himself. I heard he had a dispute with one of your seniors... I came precisely because of this.”

Though Miao Ye looked rough, his words showed a shrewd mind. His phrasing was tactful, but the Li Family wasn’t so easily misled. Everyone knew whether Miao Quan had acted on impulse when he encountered Li Qinghong in the Eastern Sea or had ulterior motives. Li Ximing showed no reaction, and both Li Xuanxuan and Li Chengliao’s expressions only had the thinnest veneer of politeness.

Miao Ye let out a quiet sigh and said solemnly, “My family uncle was cut down by the head of the Shen Family and nearly lost even his demonic core. He has already paid the price. May your esteemed family take some satisfaction from his miserable end, and perhaps not pursue the matter further...”

Li Ximing stared at him silently and only spoke after Miao Ye had finished, “These words are better said to my aunt. Surely, fellow Daoist, you didn’t come all this way just to apologize. Speak your true purpose.”

Miao Ye could only lower his head and reply, “To speak frankly, the spear known as Duruo once belonged to our Thunder Island... Long ago, one of our elders left to train in the mainland and ended up with enmity against Azure Pond Sect and Golden Feather Sect.

“This grudge... was rather convoluted. The Golden Feather Sect accused our elder of stealing cultivation techniques, while Azure Pond Sect claimed he harbored remnants of the Lingyu Gate and helped a direct descendant of the Chen Family escape...”

Miao Ye smiled awkwardly. “Heaven bears witness that our Miao Family has practiced thunder arts for generations. At most, we know a few spells for summoning and directing lightning... Though some later called it demonic, who among us uses blood arts or shamanic spell arts? Let alone any high-level thievery! Surely someone was stirring trouble behind the scenes!”

Uncertain of the Li Family’s stance toward Azure Pond Sect and Golden Feather Sect, Miao Ye chose his words carefully. Though he was polite on the surface, his implication was clear. They had falsely accused and persecuted his family.

The smiling man didn’t dare speak harshly before the Li Family, but he had undoubtedly cursed both sects behind closed doors.

For now, he simply said, “I came here today to ask about the origin of that spear. I hope your esteemed family might be willing to share some information... If it came from somewhere else, was my elder’s body perhaps found with it?”

Li Chengliao snorted noncommittally and quietly asked Li Xuanxuan beside him, “This matter goes far back... Elder, do you recall anything?”

Miao Ye immediately grew nervous as he looked at the elderly man. Yet he found it reasonable and thought, That’s right, only by asking these senior elders of the family can I hope to learn anything.

Li Xuanxuan naturally refused to speak first. Instead, he first asked, “I wonder what Immortal Foundation your elder possessed, and what protective treasures he carried? I may have some memory of this. If you could share a few details, perhaps I might recall more.”

Miao Ye quickly nodded. “My elder’s name was Miao Dushan, a man of extraordinary talent. He merged thunder arts with devil techniques through his own efforts and established the current Dao lineage of Thunder Island. He likely carried several precious devil techniques, and his mount was a creature called the Kanxiu Python. It was large in size and skilled in manipulating water currents.

“He also had a spirit artifact called the Heavenly Crimson Pearl, blood-red in color... it should be no larger than a palm. The records of it have long been lost. I can no longer recall its exact form.”

Though the speaker had no special intent, the listener paid close attention. Li Xuanxuan, who had witnessed the events himself, grew alert. He clearly remembered that the Duruo Spear had been found in a snake demon’s cave.

That very demon cave lay beneath their feet and was connected to Mount Qingdu. It was precisely where the Qingdu Cave Dwelling now stood!

Back then, we acquired several items, two manuals, one spear, and a single pearl... The Blood Dharma Manual was claimed by Zhang Yun of Golden Feather Sect, while the River Mountain Sutra still rests unread in the treasure vault. As for the blood-red pearl... it was found on the snake demon’s remains. Zhang Yun claimed it was a demon core and left with two items.

Li Xuanxuan’s pupils widened, and his mind roared like thunder, It wasn’t a demon core! How could it possibly be a demon core?!

Waves of shock surged through his heart. The truth he’d suddenly uncovered left a bitter taste. He had heard the account directly from Li Tongya, and even remembered the exact conversation between them.

“Zhang Yun and my uncle each chose one item. Zhang Yun, being slightly stronger, picked the ‘demon core’ first...”

At the time, the Li Family had barely owned any dharma artifacts. Li Tongya was merely a novice cultivator then, with a battered artifact of his own. How could he have recognized the worth of a Foundation Establishment Realm artifact?

A demon core from a Foundation Establishment Realm creature... How could that possibly compare to the Duruo Spear?!

Later, as the Li Family acquired more Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts and saw Li Wushao’s demon core, they knew it merely emitted a cold aura. It was never on par with a real dharma artifact. The family often explained its uniqueness as the result of a failed Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough. But after hearing Miao Ye’s words, how could Li Xuanxuan not understand now?

Of course... No wonder Zhang Yun was so composed. He quietly walked away with a Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact! The things in that cave weren’t left by a snake demon at all, they were remnants of Miao Dushan, guarded by the Kanxiu Python!

Even the claim that Zhang Yun had come to retrieve the Blood Dharma Manual, it likely wasn’t Golden Feather Sect’s at all! It was Miao Dushan’s personal manual! He took the most valuable item and left behind the Duruo Spear, which clearly pointed to their identity. Of course the Miao Family would eventually come looking for answers...

If not for Qinghong’s overwhelming strength and fortunate timing in encountering Miao Quan, she likely would’ve been attacked outright. Her life would’ve been in danger. And once a grudge like that took root, who would care about right or wrong anymore?

If we had clashed with the Miao Family’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivators... there wouldn’t even be a chance to speak...

A fleeting thought flashed through his mind, and he couldn’t help but feel a heavy gloom settle over his heart, Zhang Yun wasn’t even the foremost among Golden Feather Sect’s younger generation back then, nor was he yet one of the cultivators closest to Purple Mansion Realm. But his methods were already clear to see... He surpassed Chi Zhiyun by a good margin.

As Li Xuanxuan’s thoughts circled, he noticed Miao Ye still staring blankly at him.

Li Xuanxuan hesitated, then asked first, “Has your esteemed family come for the Duruo Spear?”

Miao Ye hesitated for a moment before answering, “Not exactly... We’ve searched for our elder for centuries. Our first wish is to retrieve his body and spirit shell to return them to the island. Second, we hope to find the whereabouts of the Heavenly Crimson Pearl. As for the devil techniques and dharma artifacts, those are merely a regretful loss.”

After all, it’s a Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact. No family would easily give that up...

Li Xuanxuan fell silent for a while, unsure how to respond. He could only say quietly, “Fellow Daoist, I cannot say.”

Miao Ye didn’t seem surprised. His eyes stayed fixed on the elder as he spoke quietly, “I understand your meaning, elder, but I cannot report back to my family without some cause or context. They will inevitably grow suspicious of your esteemed family.”

Fearing that Li Ximing might erupt in anger from his seat above, he deliberately emphasized urgently, “A Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact! Our Daoist patriarch greatly values it. Were it not for the North-South conflict, the other families’ watchfulness, and poor timing, the old master would have come in person long ago!”

Li Ximing’s eyes narrowed. Sensing the tension, Li Xuanxuan hurried to interject wearily, “Are you familiar with our family’s Celestial Moon Sword, fellow Daoist?”

Miao Ye nodded. “I’ve heard of it, slightly.”

“Duruo was won in a wager by one of our elders in the Qi Cultivation Realm... As for the rest, our family dared not lay hands on them.”

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard gravely. “If you do not believe me, I have no proof to offer... Duruo is currently in the hands of Qinghong. She is in the north, on assignment to exterminate demons... so naturally, we cannot hand it over to your esteemed family.”

Miao Ye fell silent for a moment before replying softly, “I understand. I cannot give my family a full answer for now. Let me investigate further. In time, I will surely return with worthy gifts to exchange for Duruo.”

The Li Family members all responded politely. Miao Ye’s expression was heavy as he backed away.

Then he suddenly asked, “This concerns a blood feud of a hundred years. My family has lived in doubt and suspicion for far too long. I ask sincerely, after leaving Moongaze Lake, should I cross Mount Xiping and head west, or descend through the Mushroom Forest and go south?”

Li Xuanxuan fell silent for a breath, then finally sighed. “The desert scenery to the west is quite beautiful.”

Miao Ye thanked them twice before riding the wind into the sky. Li Ximing, who had been sitting upright, leaned back slightly. The atmosphere among them grew heavy.

Li Xuanxuan said quietly, “If this matter isn’t handled well, we’ll have offended Thunder Island again... The grudge was already formed the moment we obtained Duruo.”

Li Chengliao was just about to speak, when he suddenly looked up, sensing something.

Li Ximing’s eyes lit up at once. “This!”

Outside the hall, a surge of blue-green light rippled and wove into several serpent- and flood-dragon-like strands in the sky. It intertwined with rising golden-green spiritual energy across the heavens in a brilliant display.

After a brief moment, everyone stepped out of the hall. Sparkling strands of clear energy began to descend from the sky, spinning as they fell. When they touched the lake’s surface, they bounced like spirits, each trailing a white flame as they leaped one and a half meter into the air, only to fall again. Clear light danced and shimmered all across the water’s surface.

“Someone has reached the Foundation Establishment Realm...” Li Ximing looked up in surprise at the celestial phenomenon. For a moment, he couldn’t tell what type of Immortal Foundation had formed. After a moment of scrutiny, he murmured thoughtfully, “Not one of the Five Virtues, not Yin-Yang, nor the Ancient Types. It must be one of the Twelve Essences.”

No sooner had he spoken than a beam of pure light rose from the lake, followed by a leaping ape.

The ape had white fur and gray eyes, and its gaze was ancient and sharp. Its muscular and agile body shimmered with flowing light. It was the size of a grand hall, and its fists as large as tables. Its back and belly were covered in dense white hair, and two white auras coiled around its wrists. The beast radiated an imposing presence.

As soon as it leapt from the water, it rapidly transformed, donning a white battle robe and taking the form of a three-meter-tall elderly man.

He landed before them. His voice was rough and deep, like stones grinding together, “This old ape greets the honored sirs.”

The White Ape!

Li Xuanxuan was stunned for two full breaths before he reacted. The elderly man before him had a simple, honest face, with eyes deep-set with age and tightly pressed lips. He was even taller than the towering Li Ximing.

He’s formed an Immortal Foundation! Li Xuanxuan truly hadn’t expected it. The White Ape was, after all, merely a spirit beast from a minor sect. Years ago, he had been wandering, wounded and scarred, before he had been rescued by Li Xuanxuan during the devil plague. Back then, his body had been riddled with fire poison, and not a single patch of fur had remained intact.

Back then, he didn’t look like he would even survive to the natural end of an ordinary demonic creature’s lifespan, let alone reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. When the White Ape entered closed-door cultivation a few years ago, his chances of success were even lower than those of Li Xicheng back in the day. Li Xuanxuan had truly been prepared for the worst.

Now, when he saw the old ape transformed into human form, silently standing before him, Li Xuanxuan felt a surge of emotion.

The elder simply took his hand and asked, “Old ape... it's enough that you’re still alive... Foundation Establishment Realm demonic creatures live even longer.”

The White Ape, as always, disliked speaking. He bowed deeply to the three of them and rasped, “This old servant, by bloodline inheritance, has cultivated the Immortal Foundation Stone Embrace Slumber, True Essence of the Twelve Essences.”

His voice was deep and hoarse, but it was steady and weighty. He fell silent again, but Li Ximing followed up with a question, “This is my first time encountering it. What are the effects of this Immortal Foundation?”

“Stone Embrace Slumber grants extended vitality, and restores flesh and bone to their truest form. The body merges with True Essence, pierces illusion, and gains insight into hearts. The longer one lives, the stronger the foundation becomes,” replied the White Ape.

Li Ximing grew intrigued and couldn’t help but ask, “How old are you now? And how many years of lifespan remain?”

“I spent two hundred and eleven years in the mortal stage, sixty-five years in the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and one hundred seventy-seven years in the Qi Cultivation Realm. I am now four hundred and fifty-three years old.” The old ape’s voice was like a stone dropping into an empty valley. “My species is naturally long-lived. Now that I’ve cultivated this Immortal Foundation, by rough estimate, I still have over four hundred years remaining.”

A look of envy crossed Li Ximing’s face. Glancing at the others beside him, he sighed, “That’s nearly three times the lifespan we have...”

But his expression quickly brightened. He took a jade token from his robes and handed it joyfully to the White Ape. “Now that you’ve reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, the task of patrolling the lake falls to you! If anything happens, crush the jade token immediately. I’ll come out of seclusion to help.”

Li Ximing looked as if a great burden had been lifted from his shoulders. Li Xuanxuan chuckled as he pulled the White Ape closer, studying him with satisfaction before laughing hoarsely, “Old friend... you’re truly blessed by fortune!”

Seeing the weight in his gaze, the White Ape nourished Li Xuanxuan’s aged body with his own clear qi and spoke gently, “This old servant pounded medicine for three hundred years, witnessed many calamities, and survived mostly through helpless luck. Now that I’ve finally achieved the Dao... it’s hard to say whether it’s a blessing or curse.”

————

Mount Bianyan.

In contrast to the brightness and joy within Mount Qingdu’s great hall, Mount Bianyan was shrouded in gloom. Heavy clouds drifted across the mountain, and cultivators crept through its shadowy ridges.

Silence reigned in the central-left great hall. Two lines of cultivators stood inside the vast ceremonial chamber, while the white tiles at the center lay empty. All present kept their heads down, not daring to speak.

The oppressive atmosphere stretched on. Beads of sweat dotted Ning Heyuan’s forehead. He glanced across the hall at his brother-in-law, Li Xuanfeng, who had just emerged from seclusion. The elder’s expression was calm, and there was no visible sign of injury. Yet he emanated an overwhelming pressure simply by standing there.

I don’t know if he’s aware yet... damn it... why did Tuoba Chongyuan come in person?! It’s clearly not time yet... What are the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators thinking...Baixiang Valley...

At the head of the hall, Chi Zhiyan remained silent. At last, Ning Heyuan couldn’t endure the silence any longer and spoke, “Reporting, my lord... The second young master of the Tuoba Family, Tuoba Chongyuan... personally led an assault on Baixiang Valley...”

As soon as he finished speaking, the elder across the hall slowly raised his head. Though his face did not look fierce, his eyes were like two arrows of dark light, piercing through the hall and silencing everyone within.
