# Chapter 820: The Deng Clan

Yuan Hu'e froze, rooted to the spot, utterly speechless.

Zhou Boyun, standing beside him, was still processing the old man’s aggressive stance. He had been anxiously looking for an opening, sensing a perfect opportunity to impress Yuan Hu'e. If Li Zhouwei hadn't immediately exposed his identity, Zhou Boyun would have already jumped in to support the elder, but doing so now might bring disaster upon his own brother. All he could do was steal glances at Yuan Hu'e’s face. The old man’s beard trembled violently as he stammered:

"So... so it is Your Excellency... Please, forgive my disrespect! What ridiculous nonsense I was spouting, daring to speak of Your Excellency's own elders..."

All the false bravado evaporated, replaced by a mixture of deep embarrassment and terror. "This old man was blind... Back when Lord Li Xuanfeng was stationed on this island... this humble one admired him immensely. I often sought his guidance and have always carried that gratitude in my heart. To think that Your Excellency would arrive today... not only did I fail to welcome you properly, I failed to even recognize you. A terrible sin... a terrible sin..."

The reversal was so abrupt it left Zhou Boyun stunned. But he heard every word clearly, and a cold dread washed over him.

'My heavens... Li Xuanfeng was a Li. Li Xizhi is also a Li. They are one family! This Li Zhouwei is from the Moongaze Immortal Clan!'

Only now did Zhou Boyun grasp the severity of the situation, cursing his own foolishness. The old man, however, had already turned on him.

"You, surnamed Zhou!" Yuan Hu'e barked. "When such a distinguished guest arrives, you don't even bother to investigate clearly? You just send a messy report about some 'dangerous man at the door'... I ought to punish you severely for this!"

'Ah?'

Zhou Boyun broke out in a cold sweat. Even the Yuan family couldn't withstand the Li family's current power, let alone a mere rogue cultivator like himself. Li Xuanfeng’s reputation in this region was immense; several cultivators had even tried to mimic his mastery of the bow. Zhou Boyun didn't dare utter another word, standing rigid and silent as a mute.

Li Zhouwei watched the old man twist the narrative, blaming his own transgression on "failing to recognize him in person" while shoving Zhou Boyun forward as the scapegoat. Li Zhouwei said nothing, letting his silence amplify the pressure.

Yuan Hu'e continued to ramble, but seeing that Li Zhouwei offered no reply, he finally let out a long, trembling sigh.

"Ai!"

Yuan Hu'e had always held Li Xuanfeng in both respect and awe; he'd never had the slightest intention of offending him. But he was stationed overseas, a cultivator originally promoted by the Ning family, making his position sensitive. He had no authority in Yuan family matters, only the privilege to listen.

When he first heard that Yuan Hudu and Yuan Huyuan were playing both sides, he knew disaster was coming.

As it turned out, Yuan Chengzhao, back in the sect, was just as unreliable. The relationship between the two families had been excellent, built on the friendship between their seniors and generations of goodwill. They had even been discussing a marriage alliance. Instead, those two old fools and one shortsighted junior sold out Yuan Chengdao, creating the irreparable feud that existed today.

Now, Yuan Hudu had died when his old injuries relapsed, and Yuan Zibin had taken control of the family. Yuan Zibin was an arrogant, perverse tyrant. It was clear that over three generations, the Yuan family had rotted to the core. This decay had implicated Yuan Hu'e, marking him as an enemy of a Purple Mansion Realm power. With that power now standing right in front of him, Yuan Hu'e felt as though his heart were bleeding.

"The juniors back home... they don't know any better..." he whispered.

The grudge between the Li and Yuan families could not be resolved with a few simple words. Li Zhouwei felt he had neither the qualification nor the inclination to mediate this grievance on behalf of his elders. He waved his hand dismissively.

"Tai'e Island Lord, there is no need for explanations. I am only passing through. I will leave as soon as I have traded for the spiritual items I need."

He gestured to the jade box on the table. Only now did Yuan Hu'e properly inspect its contents. He carefully took the items out, appraised them, and reported nervously:

"Your Excellency, Tai'e Island currently has a white-skinned fan named the [White Yin Fan]. It is a Dharma artifact of the Profound Qi dao, capable of stirring clouds of black and yellow energy. It is quite rare. It was consigned here for sale by a Peak Lord from the Azure Pond. It should be of suitable value."

Li Zhouwei finally heard something interesting. Dharma artifacts of the Profound Qi dao were uncommon, and his own **Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts** catalyzed an Obsidian Flame that was derived from that very path. This fan would be a perfect fit.

"Which Peak Lord is this, and what do they require in exchange?"

Yuan Hu'e wiped a bead of sweat from his brow. "He is the former Peak Lord of Sever Peak, also a Mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. His surname is Deng, given name Yuzhi. He is over a century old and cultivates in this region, so he left the item here for consignment..."

He shot a look at Zhou Boyun. Looking as though he had just received a pardon, Zhou Boyun scrambled out of the room to fetch the man. Li Zhouwei’s interest sharpened, and he nodded to himself.

'So, he's from the Deng family.'

Yuan Hu'e’s gaze returned to the table, locking onto the long staff. He studied it for several moments, clearly tempted, yet wary of personally using an item belonging to the Changxiao Gate. He hesitated.

"As for this long staff," he said, "this old man can make the decision to keep it on the island for consignment."

He fumbled inside his sleeve for a moment before producing a lustrous, pure white pearl of light. He offered it tentatively.

"This is a protective artifact, the [Aegis of Mystic Light], from the Clear Qi path. It is compatible with all cultivation paths. Perhaps Your Excellency would take this for now? We will leave the staff here to be sold. Once it finds a buyer, we can compare the values. If there is a shortfall, I will deliver the difference; if there is an excess, you may repay me. We can settle the matter later on the lake..."

Li Zhouwei needed only a single glance to understand. The old man coveted the staff. Life-preserving items were invaluable to aging cultivators like him, but he feared the methods of the Changxiao Gate and wanted time to have the staff inspected by others first.

The [Aegis of Mystic Light] was indeed versatile, but defensive barrier artifacts were typically expensive. Since Yuan Hu'e was offering this as a simple exchange, it likely offered meager protection. Still, the long staff was useless to Li Zhouwei, and he had no desire to waste time running around various marketplaces. He pushed the wooden staff across the table and accepted the white pearl.

"Your Excellency, please look... this is the catalog of treasures currently curated on the island."

Yuan Hu'e took possession of the wooden staff, stroking it lovingly. He was clearly ill at ease in Li Zhouwei’s presence. Making an excuse about needing to verify the staff and make inquiries, he quickly departed.

Li Zhouwei picked up the catalog and began to read. Before long, he heard Zhou Boyun’s respectful voice from the doorway.

"Your Excellency, please come in!"

A middle-aged man entered. His hair was graying and he was exceptionally thin, with shifty, rodent-like features. Despite his appearance, his expression was calm. His small eyes swept the room and settled on Li Zhouwei. He offered a slight bow and sighed.

"Family Head Li... we finally meet. I am Deng Yuzhi, of the Deng Clan of Simin..."

The Deng Clan was a minor family. Although they possessed a Foundation Establishment cultivator to hold the line, they had been forced by the Chi Clan to practice a bizarre cultivation art that caused successive generations to go mad and perish. Only after Chi Wei fell and Chi Zhiyun intervened to ease relations did the Deng Clan’s situation improve. Their disciples finally stopped practicing that technique. Deng Yuzhi was the last survivor of it.

The Deng family had established a friendship with the Li family long ago. Deng Yuzhi’s older brother, Deng Qiuzhi, was reportedly a close friend of the Sword Immortal Li Chejing. Years ago, Li Zhouwei had even used the Deng family as an intermediary to send a letter to Li Quantao. Though they rarely interacted, the bond was solid. Li Zhouwei rose and invited him to sit.

Although Deng Yuzhi was unsightly, he carried himself with an unexpected grace. He produced a jade pot and matching cups, poured the tea, and smiled. "Congratulations, Family Head."

Li Zhouwei nodded slightly. "Greetings, Senior. Is your family faring better these days?"

Deng Yuzhi revealed an unpleasant smile. "We have been well for the past century. Once Chi Wei died, we could finally breathe. Those who held the deepest malice toward my family, like Ning Hejing and Chi Zhiyan, are also dead, which eased things further. When Chi Zhiyun fell some time ago, my family even mourned him extensively..."

Li Zhouwei frowned. "Chi Zhiyun fell? Your clan... what are your intentions toward the remnants of the Chi Clan?"

Deng Yuzhi replied, "When the Chi Clan Head was assassinated, I drew my sword and set out immediately. I intended to seize the opportunity to slaughter his entire remaining family, from the elders down to the children. Halfway there, my own sons and daughters stopped me..."

"Perhaps it is because I spent all my years running between Mount Yi and Azure Pond, leaving me no time to raise them properly. They do not recognize the sins our ancestors suffered, generation after generation of being butchered. Chi Wei has been dead for over a hundred years. Who cares about some distant uncle from a branch family who died that long ago? They only see me as cruel. They fear my rage will bring disaster upon them, worried that Chi Buzi will return one day to settle the score."

He sipped his tea. "When I was in my twenties, my brother was murdered. I have hated for over a hundred years. I felt my Deng family was being devoured, generation after generation, and that this blood feud was carved into my very bones. I always believed that if the day for vengeance ever came, every member of the Deng family would fight to the death... But when I returned home, it seemed no one remembered. Or if they did remember, they felt no hatred. They only felt that Chi Zhiyun had saved them, sparing them from being devoured for the last century."

He pursed his lips, his harelip trembling grotesquely. "My very appearance is the consequence of my father practicing that wretched art. My face is ugly. When I returned home after a hundred years, they discovered that my heart is also ugly. They believe I only want to commit this act—an act that would bring endless calamity to our family—purely as revenge for my own hideous face. They don't realize that I *could* change my appearance now; I deliberately keep this face to remember."

"I went back three times. I walked the lands for ages. Gradually, I felt it was all meaningless. Perhaps I don't even hate them that much anymore. So I left Simin and came here."

His tone was flat as he asked, "What about your clan? Your family deserves great credit for the Chi Clan's destruction. The Chi Clan still has mortals who haven't died out. Does your clan ever think of exterminating them to finalize your revenge?"

Li Zhouwei remained silent.

Deng Yuzhi continued, "This whole affair is impossible to unravel. Your family lost a Sword Immortal. My family lost an unknown, worthless Qi Refining cultivator. On the surface, your family's hatred seems more justified. But didn't we both lose a family member? Because yours was a Sword Immortal, he is easier to mourn, his vengeance easier to justify. As for an unknown nobody... no one cares that he was murdered. Who cares?"

"It's just... he was my brother. So I hate a little more."

He laughed self-deprecatingly, his harelip clamping shut. He retrieved a brocade jade box from his sleeve. "Back when I visited the Li family, I met Senior Li Tongya and Fellow Daoist Li Xuanling. It is rare to see someone from those days, so I ran my mouth. I heard you want the [White Yin Fan]... It is just as rare to find a buyer so perfectly suited for it."

He placed the box on the table and gently opened it. Inside lay a pure white ivory fan, only the length of a forearm. Its surface was smooth and delicate. The fan’s handle was forged from pure, lusterless Dark Iron.

With a single glance, Li Zhouwei recognized it as a superior Dharma artifact. He was immediately tempted and nodded. "May I know the artifact's origins? And what does Fellow Daoist require in exchange?"

Deng Yuzhi smiled. "This was one of the artifacts my ancestor obtained while serving under the Great Liang. When the Great Liang fell, my ancestor crossed the river and fled south. This spiritual hoard was thus preserved. Unfortunately, later descendants were unfilial and squandered most of it. This artifact eventually fell to me. It should have been returned to the clan, but I was... greatly disappointed. I left hastily. I never imagined the heavens, seeing the hardship of my first half-life, would take pity on me. I unexpectedly had a new son late in life."

His gaze softened, a warmth that made his harsh features seem less unpleasant. He clearly adored this new child.

"An artifact of the Profound Qi path is not a good fit for my own techniques, and I am preparing to establish a property in the Hetian Sea Region for my heir. He cultivates Pit Water. Since the nature of the energy is such that 'Profound Qi transforms to Pit Water and expels Li-Fire,' this fan is even less suitable for him. I was hoping to find my son something reliable to protect his life, and I took a liking to that gourd of yours."

"The path of Water Mansion," he concluded, "is highly suitable, both for myself and for my young son."

Li Zhouwei had heard that the Deng family technique was a rare dual-attribute art, requiring both [Frigid Night-Moon Qi] and [Sinking Heart of Falling Rain]. The former was of the Supreme Yin, and the latter belonged to the Water Mansion path. It was indeed a perfect match.

Slowly, Li Zhouwei shook his head. "That is truly a pity. First, this gourd still contains a tracking imprint left by the Changxiao Gate. If you were to leave it to a junior, it would be an endless source of future calamity. Second, it is, after all, stolen property. I fear that one day, it will be recognized."

Zhou Boyun had clearly failed to explain the risks; middlemen like him always hid half the truth to secure a deal. Hearing Li Zhouwei's warning, a chill ran through Deng Yuzhi. He offered a grateful smile.

"Many thanks for the warning, Fellow Daoist... That is one issue. The materials in your storage pouch are also needed for a formation I am building, but without the gourd as the main trade, it is difficult to exchange for them."

He didn't even mention the artifacts from the Golden Tang Gate. Not only were they of inferior quality, but they were obviously incompatible with the cultivation paths of both him and his son.

Li Zhouwei nodded thoughtfully. He truly desired the [White Yin Fan] and could not let it pass by. In comparison, the Water Mansion gourd was significantly weaker, and with the unresolved imprint lowering its intrinsic value, the decision was clear.

"I am extremely interested in the [White Yin Fan]," Li Zhouwei stated. "I see that Senior is not in a desperate hurry for a day or two. I must travel to the far seas to visit a senior, and my route will take me through many places. This journey will provide the perfect opportunity to handle the gourd—perhaps alter its appearance, and ask a high-level cultivator to wipe the imprint clean. Then it will be whole and complete."

Deng Yuzhi nodded slightly.

Li Zhouwei added, "The original owner of this item was surnamed Zhuang. He was one of those who ambushed me. It will be much safer for everyone once it is properly cleaned."

They exchanged a few more pleasantries, but Deng Yuzhi still looked hesitant. He stood and went outside. Just then, Li Zhouwei saw Zhou Boyun re-entering and stopped him.

"Do you know of the Lie Sea? Are there any maps of it for sale in the marketplace?"

The Lie Sea was supposed to be the new Dragon-Attribute Sea Pasture. Zhou Boyun just shook his head, completely lost. Li Zhouwei had to recall the description given by Dongfang Heyun: the Chain of Seas lay east of Crimson Reef Island, past the Hetian Sea, bordering the Outer Sea.

"In that case," Li Zhouwei said, "bring me a map of Crimson Reef Island."

Zhou Boyun hurried off again. Li Zhouwei returned to studying the secret arts manual alone in the pavilion. After some time, the man returned, handing the map over with utmost respect.

Li Zhouwei smiled. "Gongsun Boyun... your elder brother serves the White Ye Immortal Sect, correct? Why would he bear to let his younger brother remain a simple rogue cultivator here in the Hetian Sea?"

The man stiffened, his face flooding with terror. He was not completely ignorant of affairs in the mainland; he knew Moongaze Lake had fought the White Ye Immortal Sect before. He could only bow deeply.

"My brother established his Immortal Foundation many years ago. He spent his entire savings to push this foolish and inept younger brother into the Foundation Establishment Realm, but he was unwilling for two birds to roost on the same branch. He feared that if disaster struck, both brothers would perish together."

"He told me that although the mainland is rich, it is far too dangerous. He forbade me from going there, and he forbade me from using our family surname, Gongsun. But he sends resources overseas to me every year... He hopes one day I will have enough to start my own family and create a small sect... Only then, he said, can he finally rest easy."
