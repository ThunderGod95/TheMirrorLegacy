# Chapter 811: Chimen Difu

Yu Yuwei’s voice was low, but it echoed through the cave dwelling, causing the young man to pause. Li Quantao’s lips trembled, and a blush rose to his still-recovering face.

He turned his head slightly and said softly, “None of them are good people. My father was ruined by Chi Wei, trapped on the mountain for life and unable to take a single step out. He was forced to refine pills like a drug slave. Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have always been the most heartless of all.”

The group sat in helpless silence inside the cave. Yu Yuwei coughed twice, his expression unreadable, and replied quietly, “Quantao, we might not make it out alive this time. I don’t have many years left either, so let me be frank. If the one who had been injured and trapped in the secret realm back then had been Li Encheng, and he had formed his Purple Mansion Realm, he would have been even more terrifying than Chi Wei.”

Li Quantao already held some resentment toward the old man. When he heard this, his expression froze, and anger surged up. He abruptly stood up. The entanglement between Li Encheng and Chi Wei was old history.

Forcing himself to restrain his anger, he spoke coldly, “What are you talking about, senior?! What about how Yu Yuxie was harmed? This is heartless and unjust! Even if you bear no hatred toward him, how can you speak well of him? My father had his faults, but it is not your place to judge!”

Yu Yuwei sighed and replied, “You are nothing like Li Encheng... There’s no point dredging up these old, moldy matters. I have long come to terms with it. And let’s be honest, when you and I look upon those in the Qi Cultivation or Embryonic Breathing Realms, do we treat them any better? From our position, if sacrificing a few unrelated cultivators meant gaining treasures like the Qi Wang’s Profound Heaven Hearing or the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal, would you take the chance or not?”

Li Quantao opened his mouth but fell silent. Yu Yuwei chuckled. “Don’t talk to me about how heartless the Purple Mansion Realm is. The esteemed families whip tenant farmers, cultivators trample those in the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and human blood becomes fine spirit medicine. Immortal Foundations consume it to unlock divine arts... It has been nothing but blood and tears for over a thousand years. Ruthlessness is the true path of the immortals.”

The old man sat in the cave with arms folded, his words drawing a sideways glance from Li Xizhi. Veteran cultivators like Yu Yuwei had witnessed three centuries of rises and falls, so he must have many stories.

“It’s just... not the time for such talk yet.”

Li Xizhi glanced twice at the map in his hand and said solemnly, “Mount Yan Pass likely won’t hold. This place has become too devil-infested, and more devil cultivators will surely follow. As dangerous as it is, the earlier we leave, the greater our chances of survival.”

Li Qinghong nodded in agreement, pondered for a few breaths, and said softly, “I once cultivated here. If you head directly east from this place, there should be a cave dwelling situated within the earth veins to the east of Chengshui Tomb. That cave dwelling connects to a water vein that leads all the way to the Eastern Sea.

“Though this land is now tainted by demonic forces, if we follow the water vein and emerge in the Eastern Sea, we can ride the wind all the way to Splitreed Island and return via the Shallow Sea.”

Li Xizhi checked the location she indicated; it was only a quarter-hour’s flight away. He looked at the other two and asked, “What do the two of you think?”

Yu Yuwei and Li Quantao naturally couldn’t think of a better plan and both nodded in agreement. As the group left the cave dwelling, Li Quantao muttered, “It’s a pity we don’t have a single stealth dharma artifact among us... otherwise, we wouldn’t need to go through all this trouble...”

His words reminded Li Qinghong. Under Li Yuanjiao’s control, her Profound Patterned Bottle could conceal traces, but in her own hands it could only emit thunder and store arcane lightning.

“Unfortunately, none of us possess the Boundless Ocean technique. Still, it would only be enough to hide one person anyway.”

Since she had lightning beneath her feet and her cyan feathered robe, the Cyan Sparrow Plume, enhancing her, she was the fastest among them. Li Xizhi traveled with Heavenly Glow and was nearly as quick, but they still had to slow down to wait for Li Quantao and Yu Yuwei.

They had barely flown a dozen kilometers when the scenery turned grim. Demonic energy rolled like mist, and the original black locust trees and white-stone tombs had vanished. Murky waters spread out below their feet, and skeletal remains floated faintly on the surface.

“Chengshui Tomb... it should be called Chengshui Swamp from now on...”

Two beams of demonic light rose from afar and dove into the swamp. White smoke rose with them, and people came and went. They did not resemble a patrol, but more like panicked cultivators.

Several devil cultivators streaked northward through the clouds on wind. They passed just half a kilometer from the group, leaving thick black mist in their wake.

Li Xizhi’s heart stirred at the chaotic scene. He exchanged a glance with Li Qinghong; both of them had noticed something unusual about the devil cultivators, and thought, A good opportunity...

They skimmed across the water’s surface, weaving past the tips of locust trees jutting out, covering most of the distance before finally encountering two Qi Cultivation Realm devil cultivators.

“Did a few lords arrive just now? For Murong En to die like that... and for there to be not a single whisper of news...”

The two devil cultivators were flying east while conversing intently. One looked suspicious, and the other replied, “Hard to say. All I heard is that Tuoba retreated, and someone from the Helian Family arrived. Even the lord from the Shilou Family showed up despite the tough situation... Don’t you think it’s almost certain that there’s another treasure involved.”

The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had concealed themselves, of course, so these low-level Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators didn’t sense a thing. Li Quantao glanced at them and sent a voice transmission through mana, Shall we capture them for questioning?

Yu Yuwei gently shook his head. They were deep in hostile territory, and were only a few kilometers from the cave dwelling. They didn’t need unnecessary trouble, so they flew past without drawing attention.

The dark water rippled as Li Qinghong came to a stop at one spot and examined it carefully. Though Chengshui Tomb was now completely flooded and the terrain unrecognizable, her spiritual sense probed the depths and quickly confirmed it against her memories. She had found the cave entrance.

The place was a wreck. The stone steps and stele at the entrance had been shattered and submerged. The black water concealed the bottom, so there was no telling if any devil cultivators were inside.

Li Qinghong and the others closed their eyes to probe further, only to sense that the two devil cultivators they had passed earlier were slowly catching up and hovering over the same stretch of water.

One tall and one thin, the two were chatting animatedly. The taller one, who had first spoken, looked puzzled and asked, “Which lord from the Shilou Family came?”

“Supposedly the Bo Lie King, Shilou Fu...”

The short devil cultivator responded with a nod, and the other man's expression immediately changed, showing caution as he asked quietly, “Apologies for troubling you, fellow cultivator... I was sent on an errand earlier and haven’t had a chance to ask around. I just wanted to know, does this lord consider himself a Hudi tribesman, or does he align with the northerners?”

The other devil cultivator raised his head, smiling faintly. The first cultivator immediately understood and hurriedly passed something over, at which point the other chuckled and said, “That’s easy enough to answer! Bo Lie Prefecture lies within Qi State. All of this lord’s trusted aides are northerners.”

“I see.”

The devil cultivator's eyes lit up as he replied, “Then we should respectfully refer to him as Gao Fu, and definitely avoid mentioning the Shilou Family...”

“You’re right... It all depends on his temper, but it’s best to err on the side of caution...”

When he heard the nervousness in their exchange, Li Xizhi needed no further confirmation. This Bo Lie King Gao Fu was very likely a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Tension stirred in his heart as he thought, More and more powerful cultivators are arriving from the north... It’s vast up there, nothing like Jiangnan...

Everyone exchanged glances, then looked to Li Xizhi. After all, capturing techniques were a specialty of his Heavenly Glow Art. No one present could match him in that regard. Even if they were just Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, it was still best to act decisively.

Li Xizhi understood at once. Two streaks of rainbow light leaped forth with a flick of his sleeve, diving into the water and darting forward like swimming serpents.

The two devil cultivators were standing still when suddenly, rainbow light surged from beneath their feet. Startled, they shot upward, but there was no escaping Li Xizhi’s preparation. The rainbow lights captured them in an instant.

A white mist immediately enveloped the two devil cultivators. They were both tossed about and their dharma artifacts knocked from their hands by Heavenly Glow. When their vision cleared, four daoists stood before them.

Four Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators!

The two were so terrified the world spun around them. They exchanged a glance and began kowtowing frantically, begging for mercy. But Li Qinghong had no intention of wasting time. Two bolts of lightning danced in her hands and locked onto their brows. She was ready to strike in an instant.

Ignoring their panicked faces, she waved her hand to separate them and asked sternly, “How many cultivators are in the cave?”

“My lord...”

The two devil cultivators couldn’t see each other, preventing any chance of coordinating answers. Faced with a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator skilled in thunder arts, and already missing six of their seven souls, they didn’t dare lie.

They quickly answered, “My lord... the cave dwelling houses followers of Ancestor Difu... We don’t know what mission he accepted, but he’s stationed here. We’re just minor subordinates... We haven’t committed any killings... We just beg to live...”

Their answers were mostly consistent so Li Qinghong pressed further, “There’s only one devil leader? Any reinforcements nearby?”

She questioned them thoroughly. Although there weren’t many major devil cultivators in the area, this Ancestor Difu appeared to be a formidable one. He was an old devil cultivator who had wandered through Xu and Yue States for years, with unfathomably deep demonic arts.

However, with four cultivators on her side, Li Qinghong wasn’t afraid of a single devil cultivator. But if a fight broke out and drew the attention of others, that could be trouble.

After a moment of thought, she asked, “What else do you know about this devil? Where is he originally from?”

“Ancestor Difu’s surname is Chimen. He’s a devil cultivator from Zhao. Word is, he offended someone powerful in Zhao, so he’s been roaming around Xu and Yue States ever since...” replied one of the devil cultivators.

“Chimen.”

Li Qinghong pressed them with a few more questions. Chimen wasn’t a renowned clan in the north, which put her a bit at ease. Li Xizhi asked softly, “That Bo Lie King... has he already entered the great void?”

“Reporting to my lord, he most likely has...” replied one of the devil cultivators.

Yu Yuwei made a swift decision and said gravely, “We can’t delay any longer! Strike now, kill him, and flee toward the Eastern Sea. If we hesitate, we’ll surely lose our chance!”

With their decision made, two bolts of lightning tightly bound the captives. Li Qinghong took them and descended first on lightning, with the other three cautiously following her.

Glimmers of light quickly rose from the dark waters. Li Qinghong soon spotted the glow of mana-based illumination and, on closer look, realized it was merely a low-tier Qi Cultivation Realm formation.

She had brought the captives down with her in case the formation was tough and required deception to bypass. Unexpectedly, this Chimen Difu, despite being a longtime Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, was so penniless he still used an early stage Qi Cultivation Realm formation.

Then again, it makes sense... If he’s just using a temporary spot to rest for a month or two, why waste high-grade formations?

Reflecting on it, Li Qinghong realized that even she, with a notable background, was still using Qi Cultivation Realm formations. Chimen Difu wouldn’t be any better off.

It’s just that I’ve seen too many direct descendents, it seems I’ve gotten used to a higher standard.

Since they were no longer needed, two lightning bolts burst forth and reduced the devil cultivators to ash. Li Qinghong raised her Duruo Spear, and struck directly at the formation with one thrust.

Boom!

A white bolt of thunder exploded underwater, sending the black swamp water rushing in with a deafening roar. Behind her, Li Xizhi summoned a beam of Heavenly Glow to hold back the waters, then swept his sleeve to erase all noise.

Thus, the surface of the swamp remained still, mirroring the dark clouds above like a mirror. There was no trace of Foundation Establishment Realm activity that could be detected.

“Who’s there?!”

An old voice rang out in alarm and confusion; it was clearly Chimen Difu. Fierce black wind surged along the earth veins as the formation shattered like an eggshell, alerting the old devil.

As a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Chimen Difu clearly hadn’t built the formation for defense. It was only an alarm. Once the group broke through, a vast subterranean chamber came into view.

Two devil cultivators had been guarding the gate, but now they leaped to their feet in terror. Their blood-colored light hadn’t even turned into escape light before Li Qinghong’s group was already upon them.

Boom!

Two blasts of dharma light shot toward them. A purple flame dragon roared and obliterated one into black smoke, while a bolt of lightning struck the other, turning him to ash.

Huff...
𝑓𝑟ℯ𝘦𝓌𝘦𝘣𝑛𝑜𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝑐ℴ𝓂

As dark clouds rolled through the cave, the remaining Qi Cultivation Realm devil cultivators screamed and fled inside. Li Qinghong’s feathered robe lit up, streaks of blue-white light and thunder falling with her spear. She was blazing bright and unstoppable.

Yu Yuwei also understood the moment’s urgency. Water and fire lights surged from his body, and a violet-red cauldron flew out, summoning two purple dragons that swept through the black mist.

Li Quantao’s Water Wall Pearl lifted a curtain of white water that instantly dispersed the black fog, revealing an old man with a dazed expression.

“Ah?”

With Li Qinghong and Yu Yuwei striking in tandem, and Li Quantao and Li Xizhi assisting from the flanks, their combined strength was enough to shock even a newly reincarnated Tuoba Chongyuan. Though they were all injured, they had prepared well. Their assault was enough to shake the whole cave dwelling, sending stones crashing down.

Chimen Difu, garbed in black with snow-white hair, looked every bit the aged devil he was. He held a strange black ring in his hand, and his robes glimmered faintly with black light. His aged eyes were filled with terror and confusion. He nearly coughed up blood on the spot.

Purple flame dragons and crackling lightning intertwined before him. One side was blazing fire, and the other dazzling thunder. Either one demanded his full strength, yet they came at him without warning...

The spell he had just activated was instantly scattered. Though he had wandered Xu and Yue States for years and seen much, even he was caught utterly unprepared and nearly froze on the spot.

What... what esteemed Purple Mansion Realm bloodline have I offended?! Or have I fallen into someone’s trap... how did it come to this?!
