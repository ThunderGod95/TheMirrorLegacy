# Chapter 827: Chang Yun

As his lips parted, a streak of golden light emerged and rippled outward like waves. Luejin retreated a step, coughing up two droplets of blood, and a small hole appeared on his chest.

Li Xuanfeng frowned slightly. His last arrow’s strength had clearly weakened. As he drew his bow again, he saw Luejin retrieve a scroll from his sleeve. He held it with both hands and gently shook it open.

Countless shimmering golden runes burst from the scripture, scattering through the air like rain and filling the sky before him. But Li Xuanfeng had already struck him twice and paid it no mind as he loosed the golden light from his bowstring.

Buzz...

Luejin’s dharma body trembled, and he coughed up more blood. Realizing his technique was ineffective, he hesitated for only two breaths before opening his lips to chant a spell.

Li Xuanfeng felt a murmured chant stream into his ears, causing his mind to twist in pain. The Profound Pearl Talisman Seed floating above his qi sea did not stir and release a cool current as it once had. It remained still, and was trembling faintly in the air.

"Just as I thought..."

Li Xuanfeng had already sensed something was off back in the Pristine Heaven’s Pool Below of the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal. When Maha Pi Jia attacked, he had never felt the cooling sensation of the talisman seed. Instead, he had been fully exposed to the multicolored light.

He had only vaguely realized it then, but now the truth was clear in his heart, I consumed the Human Pill. Although the talisman seed didn’t immediately vanish due to certain reasons, it has already detached from my qi sea. All my current cultivation stems from borrowing its power. To seek its protection again... would be difficult.

His head throbbed with pain and his eyes narrowed, but his grip on the bow remained steady. A flash of golden light burst outward, aimed once again at Luejin.

Master Monk Luejin observed him closely, but couldn’t tell if his spell had taken effect. However, the more intense Li Xuanfeng’s headache grew, the less he delayed. He nocked five arrows on the string in an instant, and their buzzing echoed swiftly through the mist.

A strong sense of danger welled up in Luejin’s heart. He formed a hand seal, and the scattered golden light condensed into a kasaya of glittering light that draped over his body.

As their duel reached a critical moment, the other battle was also heating up. Gao Fangjing nearby was engulfed in golden-red True Flame. His cavalry lance swept forth, creating arcs of red light that forced his two opponents into retreat. Golden-red brilliance blazed from his eyes, and the searing True Flame boiled mist from beneath his feet.

Zhong Qian’s spear had turned red-hot from the heat. The Golden Feather Sect cultivator beside him was wreathed in black smoke, and the golden sword in his hand was already warping.

He urgently transmitted using a secret technique, “Senior masters, please help us... This man is truly difficult to handle!”

True Flame was among the top-tier spiritual flames for refining artifacts, and known for melting dharma artifacts with ease. Gao Fangjing was used to rendering enemy gear useless halfway into a fight.

He chuckled darkly, “You cultivate Geng Metal, yet foolishly draw in both metal and water qi to have it both ways. Running into my blazing True Flame? That’s just your bad luck!”

Boom!

Just as he finished speaking, an explosive crack burst out beside him. Luejin’s kasaya had been shattered, sending golden streams of light flying everywhere. His entire dharma body was covered in cracks as it flickered with multicolored lights.

One hand clutched the massive hollow in his chest, while the other was pressed against his lips. His eyes gleamed startlingly bright, and his voice echoed through the air like a grand bell. Li Xuanfeng's fist was clenched pale, the markings on his face flickering in and out of visibility.

Luejin’s incantation didn’t just cause pain, it seemed to carry the power of awakening and repentance. It was clearly targeted specifically at Li Xuanfeng. As the chanting grew faster, the Heavenly Gilded Helm within his qi sea suddenly stirred, showing signs of unrest.

However, he stared coldly at Luejin, slowly raised his longbow, and a golden-red arrow rose into the air to gracefully settle onto the string.

Buzz... Buzz...

The golden-red radiance shone so brilliantly that even the fiercely battling Gao Fangjing turned to glance to the side. The golden brilliance swept across Li Xuanfeng’s face and shoulders, flowing behind him as his eyes stayed locked on Luejin, whose complexion grew increasingly pale.

Clang...

Light flashed past and the grand bell-like resonance finally faded, replaced by rapid and forceful chanting. A golden kasaya appeared on Luejin’s body once again, but it was already too late.

Boom!

A heavy glow flickered, and the golden-red brilliance was suspended in midair, revealing the true form of the arrow. It was densely inscribed with glowing runes. The arrow had been caught between two fingers. An old monk had appeared in front of Luejin, his long eyebrows tinged with white, as he carefully examined the arrow in his hand.

Li Xuanfeng waited for two seconds. As expected, Yuan Xiu’s stern and disapproving voice came from beside him. “Daoist friend, you’ve broken the rules.”

This figure was likely The Merciful One of the Great Mahayana Dharma Realm. Unlike the usual three-headed, six-armed depictions, he looked like an ordinary monk.

He pulled Luejin back a step and said in a hoarse voice, “Indeed.”

Their figures quickly faded. Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow slightly and saw Daoist Master Qiushui now standing before the cultivators of the Golden Feather Sect. After waiting a moment, a rich golden aura surged into the sky, coalescing beside Zhong Qian.

“Thank you, fellow Daoists.”

The Daoist Master beside Zhong Qian stood shrouded in a golden mist and nodded slightly. Zhong Qian appeared to know him already and stood respectfully by his side. The devil cultivator entourage also quickly gathered at his feet.

“No need for courtesy, Daoist Master Chang Yun,” Yuan Xiu replied.

Master Chang Yun’s voice was crisp and efficient as he smiled. “I’ve spent many years in the Eastern Sea, always hoping to found a sect on the mainland. But until now, I hadn’t found a place to settle. Xu State is truly a fine land.”

Daoist Master Qiushui nodded with a smile, “It was your well-laid preparations that turned the tide for us. From today onward, our Golden Feather Sect and your order share the bond of founding sects together. The north-south contention is nearing its end; may you steward Xu State’s treasured lands well. Your sect may rival any other.”

So that’s how it is!

Li Xuanfeng exchanged a glance with Lingu Rao, both seeing realization in the other’s eyes. These devil cultivators weren’t truly joining the Golden Feather Sect, they were backed by an overseas Daoist Master!

These devil cultivators would soon establish sects under this Daoist Master’s command in Xu State, allowing the Cyan Plume Sect and the Azure Pond Sect to remain clean of association. Even Li Xuanfeng and Lingu Rao were merely ‘investigating’ the area and had only acted accordingly.

After all, founding sects as devil cultivators—, we can’t afford to appear too close... Lingu Rao chuckled coldly in his heart, But give it a hundred years, and they’ll be washed clean—just another orthodox sect in Xu State...

“Hahahaha!” Daoist Master Chang Yun laughed heartily, his gaze pausing on Li Xuanfeng. Just as he was about to speak, he jerked to the side. The other Daoist Masters turned in unison toward the center of Chengshui Tomb.

A shimmering light was descending from the sky, radiating an alluring glow. Li Xuanfeng stared at it for a moment and thought, It must be the Great Ning Palace... Judging from the Daoist Masters’ tones, the ultimate goal of both the northern and southern Dao lineages is this Great Ning Palace!
