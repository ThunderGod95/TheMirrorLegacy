# Chapter 926: Chivalry

While Hengxing and her companion whispered within the great void, another section of the void glowed dimly with firelight. A black-robed youth sat cross-legged in the void, a small golden hammer in his palm. He looked up and nodded slightly.

The void then shimmered with biting frost and howling wind. A middle-aged woman stood quietly within, watching. Below, Li Xijun had already ridden off on the scorching wind. She shook her head and said with a faint smile, "Quite formidable."

Tu Longjian could not tell whether she was mocking Guo Hongyao or praising Li Xijun, and simply said in a low voice, "Greetings, Senior Tianwan."

"I’m unworthy of the title," Daoist Master Tianwan's tone was as cold as ice and snow. Frost trembled throughout the great void with each breath as she replied curtly.

She was Guo Shentong’s wife, and a direct descendant of the Golden Feather Sect. Years ago, she had eloped with Guo Shentong in the Douxuan Sky, led Crimson Reef Island to its peak, and laid the foundation of its present legacy. She was now the island’s only Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who appeared openly.

Tu Longjian’s voice was clear and earnest as he replied, "The Li Family harbors no hostility toward your island. It was only a necessary act of self-defense... Thankfully, Hongjian is unharmed. I ask for your understanding, Senior."

Now that Tu Longjian had spoken, Daoist Master Tianwan’s form was surrounded by swirling frost. She said coldly, "Guo Hongyao acted rashly and was slain by Li Xijun. Since Junjian owes the Li Family a favor, that matter can be overlooked for your sake. But he also killed Guo Hongkang and stole a treasured item. How do you propose we resolve that?"

Tu Longjian knew full well that Li Xijun’s slaying and looting was likely orchestrated by Hengzhu Dao Gate and was meant to force him down. Everyone watching, especially the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, surely understood this. Moreover, Hengzhu Dao Gate had acted under the guise of aiding the Li Family, which made it hard to denounce.

If he brought this up directly, he would be rejecting Hengzhu Dao Gate’s entire faction and siding with Crimson Reef Island, an Eastern Sea faction. How could he agree to that?

So he replied softly, "Your island acts with great force. In his panic, he may have overreacted..."

"Panic?" Tianwan was not willing to let it go. She shook her head and said, "Empty words, Daoist friend... I ask just one thing. You want to protect both Li Xijun’s life and the Radiant Sky Stone? There’s no such bargain in this world. Hand over the Six Ding Merging Fire Token, and we’ll let everything go. From that moment on, you’ll be an honored guest of Crimson Reef Island, and all matters between the Li Family and us will be cleanly severed. Perfect harmony for both sides."

Tianwan had deliberately sent Guo Hongyao and coordinated with Hengzhu Dao Gate—one stoking the fire, the other adding fuel—all for the sake of making this demand. How could Tu Longjian not see through it?

He looked calmly at Tianwan and finally replied, "The Six Ding Merging Fire Token is of great use to me. I cannot hand it over just yet, Senior."

Daoist Master Tianwan’s expression turned cold. Tu Longjian stood quietly facing her. She was a late-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with four divine abilities, while he was only at the early-stage. Yet Tu Longjian showed no fear.

There was only one reason. If Tianwan made a move, Hengzhu Dao Gate, who had been fanning the flames all along, would surely take Tu Longjian’s side. And that was precisely the outcome Hengzhu Dao Gate had been waiting for.

Daoist Master Tianwan continued observing him carefully and spoke softly, "In the past, I sent Guo Hongyao to Moongaze Lake to investigate Xu Xiao, hoping to use his destiny to elevate that useless junior of mine. But unexpectedly... Xu Xiao was slain by some other Daoist ahead of us, and the entire plan was thrown into chaos. The Six Ding Merging Fire Token... ended up in your hands instead.

"Though the divine ability has been refined and the past can be forgiven, the Six Ding Merging Fire Token is an ancient spirit artifact. It is no trivial matter, and there’s no rush. Daoist friend, take your time to consider."

Although her tone was icy, her words were not forceful. Clearly, Crimson Reef Island’s current position was not entirely ironclad. This Daoist master, who cultivated the Cold Essence divine ability, had no intention of offending him outright.

But she still has something to rely on... thought Tu Longjian.

Tu Longjian paused slightly. His eyes, burning with hazy flame, peered through the great void into the manifest world. Li Xijun had flown several hundred kilometers but could no longer suppress his injuries. Merging Fire had attacked his heart, and he had collapsed on a distant island.

Daoist Master Tianwan also looked toward the manifest world and spoke gently, "Tu Longjian, my husband bore fate as well. People like you are born noble, with the strength to act righteously, and are always rewarded for your deeds. I’m curious, when ordinary people do good, are they ever repaid?"

Tu Longjian frowned and asked softly, "Senior, you mean..."

Daoist Master Tianwan looked at him quietly and said, "My divine ability tells me that two rogue cultivators will soon arrive at that island. They are from Jiangnan and were once favored by the Li Family. Let us both refrain from using divine abilities. Will those two save him?"

"This..." Tu Longjian ran the scenario through his mind several times. Tianwan’s approach was wild and unexpected, leaving him momentarily silent.

Logically, he practiced the Molten Fire Dao, and Tianwan the Cold Essence Dao, so neither of them were skilled in divination. Their divine abilities clashed within the great void. Since Li Xijun was directly below, any calculation was near impossible.

After long moment, he thought to himself, The Li Family is close to more Purple Mansion Realm cultivators than just me. Besides, I have support, there’s no need to fear her.

If these two remember past kindnesses and choose not to help, then I’ll still have the upper hand...

Having settled his thoughts, he nodded and said, "Then let us wait and see."

————

Eastern Sea.

The Falling Water Rising Storm lingered over the Eastern Sea year-round. A brief moment of clear skies had just passed, and now the skies darkened again as thunder rolled and fine drizzle veiled the air.

Li Xijun flew several hundred kilometers. Merging Fire had already pierced through his eyes, slowly suppressing the effects of the Radiant Snow Pine Ridge. It was only by sheer force of will that he managed to fly beyond the furthest island within the reach of the Qingzhou Reefs.

But when he reached that point the lingering dark force on his body suddenly seemed disrupted, then vanished. The taut string in Li Xijun’s heart snapped with a thud, and he plunged headfirst toward the sea.

Just before hitting the sea, he jolted awake. The ocean below belonged to the Dragon Clan, and teemed with shrimp soldiers and crab generals. In his current condition, falling into their hands would spell near-certain capture. He had no choice but to force himself to fly a little farther.

But there were no islands in sight. In his daze, he spotted a reef and struck it with a sleeveful of mana. A faint cracking sound followed, instantly freezing a block of solid ice upon it.

As he fell, he barely managed to fling out a talisman, enveloping himself in its protection. Li Xijun finally lost consciousness and collapsed with a splash onto the ice.

Rain veiled the world in mist, pattering rhythmically onto the ice.

After a short while, two streaks of flight light approached from the north, trailing faint black tails. Two rogue cultivators in Daoist robes rode the wind to the reef, circling twice before cautiously landing nearby.

One looked over seventy, hunched and stooped as he held a long wooden sword with a cold, stern expression. The other was broad and younger, wielding an axe in each hand. He was thick-browed and sharp-eyed as he warily scanned the area.

The cold-eyed elder glanced at the red-robed man collapsed on the ice and swallowed hard before whispering, "Fellow Daoist Rui, take a look at this..."

The brawny man surnamed Rui frowned and glanced sideways at the flame surrounding the red-robed man. He replied, "That's some intense flames. This cultivator looks seriously wounded and on the verge of death... Wait ten hours or so, and he’ll be in deep trouble."

The old elder swallowed again and murmured, "Fellow Daoist Rui, you have keen eyes. How can we let someone die before us? Let’s save him quickly."

The two exchanged glances and clearly saw the greed in each other’s eyes. The burly man surnamed Rui responded, "Don’t you see the light from that talisman on him? If we don’t deal with that first, how can we ‘save’ him?"

The old elder hesitated for a moment and muttered, "But the Clearing Art Talisman is so expensive... it’s a life-saving treasure. I only have three left..."

But when he was glared at by the burly man surnamed Rui, the elder had no choice but to pull out the talisman from his sleeve. He cast a spell, muttered incantations, and finally pinched off a wisp of blue-green light from his fingertips, commanding, "Go!"

The bluish light burst apart with a pop, but the shield on the man's body only dimmed slightly. The two were stunned and thought inwardly, What a treasure!

Neither of them could recognize the talisman’s type. They were startled when it hadn’t shattered, but the red-robed man remained motionless and their eyes lit up.

The cold-eyed elder said, "We’ve struck gold!"

They now knew the man before them had to be from a wealthy background. The elder hurriedly pulled out two more talismans and got another two from the burly man, drawing all four together into a single point on his fingertip.

Still uneasy, he exchanged a glance with his companion. The two simultaneously drew out their dharma artifacts, gathered their spell force, and shouted, "Break!"

The combined dharma light—everything they owned—slammed into the shield, creating a loud boom. The shield dimmed to the brink of collapse, yet still held. Terrified, they raised their dharma artifacts and started bashing it madly.

After a long struggle, both were panting heavily and their mana was nearly depleted. At last, the light shield shattered with a crack.

The elder, drenched in sweat, collapsed onto the ground and panted, "What a cursed disaster..."

The burly man swept the body with his spiritual sense, only for his hair to stand on end. He jumped back in place and cried out, "Damn it! Foundation Establishment Realm!"

He fled like he’d been stung by a scorpion. The elder froze for a moment, his legs shaking like leaves. He immediately leaped up into the air as the two fled north one after the other.

Sea wind brushed past. After seven minutes, the two returned sneakily, flying in and landing some distance away.

One said, "If he had even a sliver of strength, he could’ve killed us both with a breath."

Emboldened by their own logic, they moved forward again. Once they were nearby, the cold elder reached out his dharma artifact with a trembling hand, his sword shaking as though it would fall. It took two tries before he finally hooked the storage pouch.

He squinted and inspected the pouch closely. An image of a familiar large lake floated on its surface, stamped with a single large character, Li.

"The Qingdu Li Family!"

The two had been in the outer seas recently and were unaware the Li Family had unified Moongaze Lake. They were momentarily speechless as they glanced at each other.

The elder muttered a few words, then looked hesitantly at the burly man, "Back on the riverbank, it was Li Qinghong who saved us with thunder. The one in the sky with the bow was Li Xuanfeng... They did us a favor after all."

The burly man frowned, but the elder had already made up his mind. He said quietly, "Let’s carry him back to the lake. Would the Li Family treat us poorly for it?"

They flew in again, landing near the ice with more composure this time. The burly man surnamed Rui glanced over, then suddenly stopped in his tracks, his face turning fearful as he whispered, "You’ve forgotten what kind of technique we practice!"

The elder frowned in confusion and replied, "What’s the matter? Even beyond the Eastern Sea, there are people secretly cultivating devil techniques in Jiangnan..."

The burly man said fearfully, "You don’t understand! The Li Family is a righteous lineage, and they despise cannibal cultivators above all. We’ve practiced blood-devouring devil techniques and consumed over a hundred lives. How could their elders possibly spare us? You think we’ll get a reward for returning him? He’ll kill us with a single strike!"

The elder was shocked and frightened. After a moment of hesitation, he said, "Then... we can only leave him here... Let’s flee while we can!"

The burly man glanced at him secretly and said in a sorrowful voice, "We already broke his shield and touched his storage pouch. Do you think these families with countless immortal arts won’t notice? If he truly dies and we don’t help, they’ll never forgive us!"

"You—!" The cold elder suddenly felt caught between a rock and a hard place. He muttered, "What are we supposed to do now?"

Seeing his hesitation, the burly man grew greedy again and said through gritted teeth, "Why don’t we just steal his storage pouch and flee north? We can try our luck at Foundation Establishment Realm! Isn’t that a stroke of fortune..."

The elder was tempted. He weighed the storage pouch in his hand, torn with indecision. He murmured, "Fine! We’ll do it your way..."

The burly man stepped closer and examined Li Xijun’s face. After staring blankly for a moment, a chill ran down his spine. He muttered almost inaudibly, "Look at him, he's like a banished immortal. If he looked dim-witted, maybe it’d be fine, but someone this elegant must be a Li Family sword cultivator... who knows how divine his sword arts are..."

"What exactly are you trying to say?!" The elder, now truly uneasy, demanded.

The burly man only whispered, "He must have divine sword skills. Either way, we’re already offending the Li Family. Why not gamble it all on the Foundation Establishment Realm? We’re going to die someday anyway, better to kill him now and have one less threat later...

"Besides, the flames are already killing him. We just need to add two discreet sword thrusts and they’ll never tell how he died. As long as it looks like he was burned to death, they’ll assume it was done by someone who uses fire. But if he survives, he might just come after us for the storage pouch."

Despite being only half-literate in cultivation matters, the burly man made it sound so convincing that it completely bluffed his companion. The elder had always followed the burly man’s lead. Now confused and shaken, he could only watch as the man bent down and picked up the icy sword, hiding in the corner with a lowered head.

The burly man tried drawing the sword twice, but Han Lin refused to leave its sheath. Its cold radiance flared, slicing open his palm and causing blood to gush. He cried out and flung the sword away, clutching his palm with a furious glare.

"Damn it!"

He snatched the elder’s longsword and stabbed down at the man, but it was blocked by the Dharma robe’s fabric. The sword wouldn’t penetrate.

Though he had been full of bravado, his hands trembled as he cried out in panic, "What is this thing?!"

He stabbed three more times, but it was all in vain. Taking a deep breath, he searched the edges of the Dharma robe for a gap and drove the sword toward the youth’s abdomen.
𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑛𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮

It felt like stabbing into cotton. The blade made no clear wound, only a series of scraping and grinding sounds as if something rock-solid lay beneath the flesh.

"Ah!" The elder beside him saw clearly the heart and lungs glowing red with a stony hue. The sight burned his eyes, and he leaped back like a startled toad, crying out, "Stone—his organs are made of red stone! Fellow Rui... let’s run! Forget the storage pouch... forget Foundation Establishment Realm!"

The burly man’s face turned red as if he was about to bleed, and he muttered, "Cowardly old man. So what if we die? Foundation Establishment Realm is glorious!"

He focused on the youth’s exposed neck, raised his sword, channeled mana into it, and swung with all his might, striking the youth’s throat.

Sparks flew through the air as the longsword got stuck at the throat. His hands trembled as it took him three tries to pull it out. He struck twice more before finally severing the youth’s head.

The sullen old man’s legs trembled as he stared blankly. The burly man surnamed Rui let out a breath of relief. When he was just about to put away his sword, he saw the severed head shift downward an inch on its own and reattach seamlessly to the body. The skin was smooth and flawless, showing no trace of a cut.

"Ah!"

A cold chill surged through his body. His legs gave way, and he collapsed onto the ground. His teeth chattered uncontrollably as the world spun around him. His eyes couldn’t leave the neck.

All color drained from the old man’s face, leaving him pale as a corpse. When he heard Rui’s teeth chatter, he stammered, "What... what is... going on?!"

"How... How would I know?!" Rui snarled. The old man inched away, his hand outside his robe shaking violently, lips trembling. Rui faltered, "I... I’ve never killed a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator before..."

But seeing that the youth had not awakened, the burly man gradually regained some courage and muttered, "What’s done is done... what’s done is done..."

He actually picked up the longsword again, measured the position, changed to a vertical grip, and struck the center of the brows three times until he split the head in two with a sharp clang.

"Are you trying to get yourself killed?!" The old man’s paper-white face regained a hint of color. Already hunched over, he leaped up like a startled toad and cried out in alarm, "You’re going to die! You’re going to die!"

The old man immediately rode the wind and sped northward, his escaping light tinged with streaks of red. He had clearly used a blood escape technique, as if something terrifying were chasing him.

His light bobbed erratically through the sky, accompanied by howling cries echoing through the heavens, "You’re going to die!"

The burly man surnamed Rui was nearly scared into wetting himself by those crazed shrieks. The severed head had somehow rejoined the body again.

Stars danced in his eyes as he stared at the handsome face before him and muttered, trembling, "It’s not like I haven’t practiced devil techniques... reattaching a head... what’s so strange about that..."

He tried to reassure himself, but knowing the Li Family was a righteous family made the scene before him even more terrifying. The burly man raised his sword for the third time and struck at the neck again.

It took Daoist Rui three slashes to open the neck again. This time, he was ready. He lunged forward, lifted the head, and moved it away from the neck, intending to toss it aside.

But then he froze. The head in his hand had its eyes open. Those pale grey pupils stared quietly at him. That handsome face, paired with those eyes, exuded an eerie sanctity. Despite the colorless hue, Daoist Rui clearly sensed an icy chill within them. His heart felt like it would shatter; his head felt like it had been plunged into icy water; and every part of him shivered from the cold.

The next moment, the youth spoke.

A burst of snow-white sword energy surged from his lips and teeth, transforming into countless blades of frost and snow that blasted forward. Daoist Rui’s scream caught in his throat, and he was obliterated from head to toe. Only swirling snowstorms remained, stirring waves across the sea.

Splash!

Two storage pouches fell to the ground and rolled twice. The head floated back to the body and fit perfectly onto the neck once more. The youth let out a breath, and only then did his pale grey eyes close.

————

Great void.

Tu Longjian had already sensed something was wrong when Daoist Rui entered the game. The situation had turned out completely contrary to expectations. Hengzhu Dao Gate clearly hadn’t made a move to assist. They had not even sent a single message.

Tianwan was not surprised. Tu Longjian’s gaze swept across a certain place in the manifest world, and he too came to understand.

"Changxiao!"

Changxiao, who had previously been delayed by Chengyan’s matter, had clearly been feigning ignorance all along. Now he suddenly struck at Wang Fu, going with the flow and tying up Hengzhu Dao Gate's cultivators.

With this, the Hengzhu Dao Gate could no longer pull Tu Longjian to their side. His only means of saving Li Xijun was to hand over the Six Ding Merging Fire Token. But after bungling the situation, Hengzhu Dao Gate, though they killed Wang Fu, had now made an enemy of Tu Longjian...

So Daoist Master Tianwan stood before him, holding the winning hand, waiting for Tu Longjian to yield the Six Ding Merging Fire Token. Yet Tu Longjian remained unmoved, and thus Li Xijun was beheaded three times.

But Tu Longjian remained calm, seemingly unconcerned. He didn’t even open his eyes to look at the scene in the manifest world. He only gazed quietly at his opponent, in stark contrast to his prior behavior.

Daoist Master Tianwan stared fixedly at him silently sitting in the void, seemingly in disbelief. She sighed deeply and said, "Junjian, you are truly patient and calculating."

Tu Longjian’s voice was calm and steady as he replied, "Senior flatters me. I owed the Li Family a favor. This Radiant Sky Stone repays it in full. From now on, we are even. The rest is none of my concern."

Daoist Master Tianwan glanced at the frost and snow on the sea, shook her head softly, and murmured, "Everyone calls you a chivalrous man, Tu Longjian, but in the end, this is all there is to it."

Having said that, she suddenly felt disinterested.

I had hoped to use the currency of favor to gain the Six Ding Merging Fire Token in a deal without cost. But who would’ve thought he’d be so cold when it came down to it. I’ll have to come up with another plan.

She sighed in regret. After waiting so long with nothing to show for it, and with Changxiao only able to buy limited time, dragging things out would only put her into a passive position. She glanced coldly at Tu Longjian, then vanished in the great void.

Tu Longjian revealed himself above the sea, looked down at Li Xijun, formed a hand seal, and commanded, "Scarlet Sparrow, bear fire and deliver my order."

A hazy flame flew from his sleeve, transforming into a huge sparrow the size of a tiger or leopard. It circled him once, then opened its beak and inhaled. The Radiant Sky Stone, the storage pouch, Li Xijun, and everything else on the sea surface all flew into its belly.

Tu Longjian said softly, "The Radiant Sky Stone is here. Now we’re even."

The bird took his words into its belly as well and rode the wind southward. Tu Longjian glanced around, aware that many were watching from the great void, then turned and left.

He returned all the way to his cave dwelling, where a young man in blue and white robes was already seated. He was handsome with slightly feminine features, and was examining the collection within the cave.

Tu Longjian showed no surprise as he said calmly, "Thank you, Senior Pu Yu."

This man was none other than Daoist Master Pu Yu, his long-time friend. Pu Yu took a seat by the jade table and said casually, "I’ve preserved the soul. After all, he hasn’t learned divine abilities and his name isn’t on the rolls, so he was easy to catch. A few old fellows have died. In all the mainland, I doubt anyone knows more about this than I do. They won’t be able to tell! But you... going to all this trouble, you really thought it through."

Tu Longjian’s handsome face revealed a wry smile as he replied, "There were too many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators watching. If I’d protected him directly, I’d never have peace with the Li Family from then on... It would only convince those scheming against me to go deal with the Li Family instead!

"Only now do I understand Daoist Master Xiao’s way. He wanted to protect, but couldn't be close. Know when to let go... or else you end up harming the very ones you try to help!"

He sighed softly and continued, "Now that’s settled. Li Xijun ‘died’ in front of them, and my debt to the Li Family is cleared. I no longer need to stand openly behind them. They also know now that trying to scheme against the Li Family won’t work on me... It’ll be much easier to maneuver things moving forward."

The black-robed youth shifted the topic and spoke solemnly, "Senior, you master Yin and Yang, life and death. As for Xijun... I leave it in your hands, Daoist Master!"
