# Chapter 1131: Xinyu

A downpour lashed the mountains.

A biting chill hung over Mount Qusi. Li Ximing arrived on the wind, only to find the mountain slopes conspicuously empty. The icy rain, laced with sleet, hammered the trees, raising a deafening racket. The Daoist Master was seated cross-legged on the summit, absorbing the mists and morning dew. He snapped his eyes open, a smile spreading across his face.

"Fellow Daoist, you've arrived!"

Li Ximing held a long halberd, its long blade curved like the moon, radiating a brilliant light. It was precisely Grand Ascension. He presented the weapon. Liaoluo nodded slightly, his gaze sharpening as he examined it.

"What a fine ancient artifact!"

Grand Ascension had been obtained from the Green Pine Temple grotto-heaven. Though it was merely an ancient dharma artifact, it possessed a unique charm. It had followed Li Zhouwei for many years, and now that it had been refined into a spirit embryo, its wondrous qualities were even more pronounced. Liaoluo's eyes were fixed on it, unable to look away for a long moment.

"A fine treasure... a truly fine treasure..."

Li Ximing smiled.

"We had agreed on three hundred days, but I was unexpectedly delayed by a trip to the Western Sea."

All the spoils Li Zhouwei had taken from Vast Cicada were in Liaoluo's hands. Aside from two items to be combined into Li Zhouwei's new weapon, there was also an exceedingly potent Valley Water lotus that required three hundred days to refine. Li Ximing had come, first, for the weapon, and second, to eagerly claim that portion of Valley Water!

Liaoluo finally, and reluctantly, tore his gaze away.

"It has been prepared for you, Fellow Daoist."

He dismissed the women attending him. Once they were alone, his expression turned serious.

"This spirit embryo is magnificent, but it has completely disrupted my plans..."

Li Ximing blinked, raising an eyebrow. Liaoluo sighed.

"That portion of gold embryo I formed from the spiritual materials... I had already beaten it into the shape of a halberd, preparing to refine it for King Wei. I drafted five or six different blade designs, but the Great Daoist Master was never satisfied. Only now, after seeing this spirit embryo, do I realize I nearly ruined a treasure!"

The man, usually so carefree and relaxed, now had an excited, piercing glint in his eyes.

"This treasure is of ancient Wei design and was wielded by King Wei for many years; it could not be more suitable. The Great Daoist Master possesses the [Void-Rim Pure Treasure Furnace], which contains the [Displacement Refining Art]. It is a perfect match for this spirit embryo! It's a hundred times better than anything I could have devised!"

This weapon being forged for Li Zhouwei was no small matter; a vast amount of spiritual materials had been invested. Li Ximing valued it highly. His expression grew solemn as he asked:

"Please, elaborate."

Liaoluo explained, "This treasure furnace in the Great Daoist Master's hands is an artifact of ancient cultivators, a legacy from Encompassing Profoundity's Aegis of the Transverse Dam. It was forged using spiritual materials of the Geng-Metal and Blazing Fire paths. Within it burn three types of Blazing Fire and three types of True Fire. The [Displacement Refining Art] can purge a specific spiritual material from a Spiritual Artifact without having to melt the artifact itself down to liquid... It was originally used by those half-immortal, half-Buddhist cultivators to refine Enlightened Artifacts..."

'I thought my family was wealthy enough... but compared to these people, we're still a step behind. We lack their deep foundations...'

Hearing this, Li Ximing sighed inwardly. His mind raced as he grasped the implication.

"I see... You intend to use the form of Grand Ascension, purge its impurities, and refine new spiritual materials directly into it."

Liaoluo shook his head.

"That would be settling for less. The goal is to preserve Grand Ascension itself—especially the talismans, conceptual imprints, and even the nurturing aura left by the ancient Wei artifact smiths, cultivated from King Wei's many years of wielding it..."

"The method you mentioned can be done by any ordinary refinement art, but the weapon would essentially be a different one. If you refine a Spiritual Artifact possessing spirituality in that way, its spirituality will be lost. But with my family's method, it can be preserved."

Li Ximing knew nothing of artifact refinement, but he could certainly tell a superior method when he heard one. He nodded repeatedly.

"Let us proceed with your method, Fellow Daoist!"

As they spoke, an attendant approached, holding a jade tray covered with a red cloth. When the cloth was lifted, it revealed a bottle and a piece of gleaming gold, both radiating a brilliant light.

The gold had a deep, somber base, yet it shimmered with a dazzling radiance. Li Ximing recognized it—his family had once acquired a piece of this Converging Water's Sinking Savage Aged Gold. It was later presented as a congratulatory gift to the crown prince of the Dragon-kin's White Dragon Shrine.

Liaoluo, however, pointed to the bottle.

"The thing in this bottle is good stuff! It's one of the 'Valley Waters', called [Returning Creek Valley Water]. This water upholds the transfer principle of Valley Water, governed by the Dao of the Profound Mystery Heaven. It cannot be consumed or used for alchemy, which is why it's called Valley Water and not 'Pure Origin'. Of course, many Daoist traditions have been lost, so the terms are often conflated. But its effect is not the least bit inferior. Fellow Daoist, you must try it!"

Joy sparked in Li Ximing's heart. He took the bottle. Inside, a pale gray liquid surged restlessly. He sighed inwardly:

'[Grotto Egret Origin Water] is far too precious; I haven't dared to use it. This Valley Water is the second true spiritual water I've managed to get my hands on!'

He studied it, captivated. Liaoluo smiled.

"I remember Fellow Daoist also possesses a piece of [Long Yue Variable Gold]. It is exceptionally compatible with this [Returning Creek Valley Water]. You could try refining them into a treasure to preserve your life-mandate and avert calamities!"

Li Ximing nodded eagerly. Before Liaoluo could even introduce the piece of Converging Water gold, Li Ximing pushed the jade tray back toward him, his expression serious.

"For all these matters, Fellow Daoist, you have been the one laboring. The subsequent refinement of the Spiritual Artifact will be an even greater trial of mind and body. How can I let you work for free? Please, accept this piece of [Sinking Savage Aged Gold]!"

As a Converging Water cultivator, how could Liaoluo not covet this spiritual material? He hesitated, his face conflicted.

"I was only tasked with solving a few problems for you. How could I dare claim credit for it?"

Li Ximing's expression hardened.

"If Fellow Daoist does not accept, I will surely not dare to seek your help in the future!"

Li Ximing's reasoning was sound. 'Converging Water' items were the most unsuitable for his family. Neither Jiangqian nor Que'Wan cultivated Dao paths that favored Converging Water. It was perfect for repaying this favor; otherwise, he would only have to trade it away later. His attitude was unyielding, practically forcing Daoist Master Liaoluo to accept.

Only then did he press two fingers to his Juque, lightly drawing out a golden object.

Long Yue Variable Gold!

This item had always been stored in his Juque, reserved for cultivating the [Emperor Qi's Light]. But Li Ximing's Dao-Profundity was pitifully low compared to Li Zhouwei's. He barely practiced his few Li Fire spell arts, let alone the [Emperor Qi's Light]. Now, he was decisive, retrieving it without hesitation.

A refusal was one thing, but Liaoluo's attitude was now visibly more cordial, even tinged with the slight embarrassment of one whose hands have been tied by a gift. After all, even without his connection to Diyan, acquiring a spiritual material of Converging Water was an immense boon.

He swiftly stored the Returning Creek Valley Water and the Long Yue Variable Gold, then said with great solemnity,

"Leave this matter to me. I will ensure it is handled perfectly for you!"

Li Ximing smiled.

"The Valley Water is not urgent, but the weapon must be. It won't do to leave King Wei empty-handed."

Liaoluo nodded grimly. But just as he was about to reply, a disciple rushed in.

"Reporting to Daoist Master, a divine ability cultivator has arrived at the mountain's foot. He calls himself the Western Sea rogue cultivator Xie Hu, and is here to find... Daoist Master Zhaojing."

'Xie Hu?!'

Li Ximing's brows shot up, his initial disbelief replaced by a flash of suspicion.

'He actually found this place... It seems he went to the lake... Don't tell me he still wants to settle this score with me!'

Liaoluo fell silent, glancing at him. Li Ximing calmly sipped his tea.

"Are those his exact words?"

The disciple bowed low.

"Yes."

"Then please invite him up."

The mountain rain intensified, blurring the world outside the pavilion into a gray-white curtain. Yet, through the deluge, the crisp sound of colliding jade could be heard. A man in a rain-soaked straw cloak and bamboo hat stood before the hall, a silent, downcast youth behind him. The man drove a long staff, from which hung numerous jade swords, into the ground. His voice was deep.

"Is it Daoist Master Li?"

Li Ximing activated his Life Divine Ability. He saw the rain was saturated with a sharp, piercing aura. He descended from the hall.

"Indeed!"

Xie Hu looked up, his face finally visible from beneath the brim of his hat. He studied Li Ximing for a moment before retrieving a jade box from his robes.

"Senior Yan's lifespan ended. He passed away in the West Curtain Sea, nourishing his ancestral land. I was entrusted by him to come see Fellow Daoist—this is his descendant, Yan Ruzhe."

'Yan Dushui has fallen!'

A wave of desolation washed over Li Ximing. He glanced at the youth. He was not handsome, but he was tall with a resolute face. The boy smartly dropped to his knees and kowtowed several times.

"Junior greets Daoist Master!"

"I will remember you."

Though Yan Dushui was dead, he had burned the last of his life's radiance to its fullest. These simple words represented the favor of a Daoist Master. The youth was overcome with gratitude, kowtowing repeatedly. Li Ximing rewarded him with some spiritual materials and helped him to his feet.

He pinched his fingers, performing a quick calculation and recalling the last time he'd seen him.

"This... is a bit early."

Xie Hu nodded.

"Before his death, he crafted three final talismans to leave as his legacy, and then he passed on. He asked me to deliver a message to you, Fellow Daoist."

"The Zhao and Yan surnames, hidden in the West Curtain, have long forgotten their clan's past connections and Yongjing's wealth. Fearing the clan's extermination, they only wish that for generations they will never return... We hope Zhaojing will, for the sake of private friendship, show mercy... Lin Yi is overwhelmed with panic, fear, and tearful gratitude."

Li Ximing fell silent, grasping the old Daoist Master's intent.

'The Wei and Yan families ultimately have a karmic connection. His family can't even produce a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator now... They truly do not want their descendants involved in the affairs of Jiangnan.'

He let out a long sigh, accepted the jade box, and opened it. Inside, he saw a jade slip, likely concerning the mystic realm. He stored it away and gestured.

"Please!"

But the middle-aged man's expression remained stern. He returned the salute.

"No need, this Xie still has important matters."

Without another word, he walked straight down the mountain, stepping into the Great Void and vanishing.

Li Ximing watched him depart, another weight lifting from his mind. He returned to the hall, where Liaoluo commented,

"A decisive person."

They finished their tea. Liaoluo paused, listening as Li Ximing spoke, his tone grave.

"Does Fellow Daoist have any Pristine Water?"

Liaoluo started.

"This is..."

Li Ximing smiled.

"I don't need to trade for it. I just promised a Fellow Daoist to refine a pill, which needs Pristine Water as a medium. I just need to use it!"

The pill he spoke of was, of course, for Daoist Master Dao Mian of the Western Sea. The pill required Pristine Water for its transformation and Water Mansion for assistance. He already possessed Water Mansion; only the Pristine Water was missing.

But the Daoist Master looked troubled, his brow furrowing in thought. A moment later, his expression cleared, and he smiled.

"I don't have any on hand, but Kuang Yu has a portion of [Tangyi Pristine Water], also called [Clear Tangyi Water Pool Origin]. It's exceptionally wondrous. You can certainly borrow it from her!"

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. He nodded to himself, a plan already forming.

'It's a good time to visit Xinyu... That child Queyi has also been guarding the overseas territories for many years. I can visit her on the way.'

---

The sea was a vast azure, dotted by circling eagles and sparrows.

A light rain drifted over the island. A woman in a purple dress, her face somewhat pale, paced atop the grand defensive formation. She gazed down at the scenery, her voice calm.

"This is the fourth time... If I had been a step later, this thing might have broken out. The entire Xinyu Archipelago might have turned into filth and sunk, and no one could have stopped it."

Her features were lovely, though etched with worry. It was Daoist Master Tinglan.

Tinglan was not particularly tall. The woman beside her, however, was, clad in a pale cyan Daoist robe. Her features were gentle, her eyes a striking blue-purple, and she shared the faint worry in her expression.

"It's good that there's no movement. If something really happened, this place wouldn't be for us to manage."

Kuang Yu's worry was justified. Tinglan simply frowned.

"Have you reported this matter to Daoist Master Diyan?"

Kuang Yu let out a long sigh.

"You, and Sister Hengxing, have both mentioned this is the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's private affair. I am half a Hengzhu cultivator, only helping out here. How can I ask?"

Tinglan seemd surprised by this. She paused before speaking.

"Then let's wait. The day it truly can't be held back, bring it up then... Your divine ability... has there been any progress? If you can break through, you should be able to buy more time."

Kuang Yu hesitated.

"It's been slow. I failed again a few years ago. Although my immortal foundation is restored, I still have no confidence... The 'Cultivation Transcendence' path has appeared, but it's not easy to cultivate."

The two women descended on the wind, returning to the palace. Rain dripped steadily within the hall. Seeing they were alone, Kuang Yu lowered her voice.

"Fellow Daoist Zhu Gong... how is she?"

At the mention of Zhu Gong, Tinglan's expression grew complicated, tinged with guilt.

Private failings aside, during this era of the Supreme Yang's decline, her close friend from overseas had done more than enough. Yet, she had gained nothing for it. Instead, Tinglan felt she had used her as a pawn...

She sat, her gaze falling.

"I went to see her a few days ago. Her injuries are slightly better, but the deficit is still huge... decades won't be enough, perhaps over a hundred years... When she is slightly better, we can discuss other things..."

Kuang Yu lifted a jade pot, pouring a clear, bright liquid.

"That's right. No matter what, she is still a Purple Mansion Realm. As long as she holds on, doesn't show her face, and waits until the great war between north and south turns... once Kong Tingyun loses her backing, she can escape this deadly predicament!"

Tinglan didn't reply at first. She took a sip, then raised an eyebrow.

"Wine?"

Kuang Yu smiled.

"It's wine refined from the [Feast Blazing Flower] that Nanwu just acquired. He hides it like a treasure. I finally managed to get some, so I'm letting sister have a taste."

"This thing is normally poison; only Blazing Fire cultivators can consume it. But a method from our Daoist tradition uses it to refine wine. The two elements clash and harmonize. Though the wine is strong, it can stabilize one's cultivation and increase dharma power."

Hearing this, Tinglan drained the remaining half of her cup. But at the mention of Guo Nanwu, her expression turned solemn.

"I see Nanwu frequently visiting Ting Province, and he was also in that fight in the Western Sea a year ago. And that kid Ximing often runs to Qusi. What is the Great Daoist Master thinking?"

At the mention of Diyan, Kuang Yu immediately lowered her brows.

"Qusi is surrounded by wolves, and the elder's life-mandate is failing. They are borrowing Wei's prestige for protection."

Tinglan hesitated, then sighed.

"I daren't say much, but you must think clearly. Although Ning Wan's life-mandate is not her own to command, she uses it to barely wear the tiger's skin, intending to protect a branch of the Li clan. But she truly has no confidence, and she doesn't want you dragged into it."

Ning Wan and the Li clan were old acquaintances, a friendship spanning generations from Li Chejing to Li Xuanfeng, and now to Li Ximing. Li Yuanqin was Ning Hemian's biological son. Tinglan could see Ning Wan's intention to protect them, but her pessimism was palpable, leaving Tinglan deeply uneasy.

Kuang Yu merely smiled.

"Sister worries too much."

Tinglan was not one for many words, so she said no more. Kuang Yu silently lifted the green jade pot and refilled her cup.

"The True and Purple paths are two sides of the same coin. Sister, you are in the Purple Smoke blessed land, so you will certainly be safe. After all, Lord Zimu is there, is he not?"

Surprise flashed across Tinglan's features. She raised her cup.

"You... who taught you?"

Kuang Yu smiled.

"The arrangements for the True and Purple paths... the people above see it all clearly. The Purple Qi has not manifested for a long time because it is waiting to ascend to Truth. How could the Great Daoist Master not understand? The elders always understand more than you or I."

Tinglan silently lowered her cup. Kuang Yu, however, drank her own fill, her eyes turning slightly red.

"Sister, you have also experienced what it means to be constrained. The Supreme Yang is in decline; think of the blood and tears. It was only because Lord Zimu was present during the upheaval at the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter... that they were willing to let you return..."

"That time is finally past. No matter how the two sides struggle, they won't touch Purple Smoke. But Qusi still has a calamity to overcome. Being in the thick of it, one is never at ease, always fearing disaster... The Great Daoist Master... this is his only chance."

Tinglan saw how heavy Kuang Yu's thoughts were, but she didn't dare press for details. She remained silent. After three rounds of wine, her face was flushed. She finally spoke.

"The world is in turmoil. How many places are truly at ease? Look at this State of Song. Xianyao is dying, but not yet dead. Cheng Qian, having lost his backing, is restless. Chen Yin has lost all his capable descendents. Ning Wan is trapped in Jiangnan. Chensheng's family fortune has declined. Tingyun sits on a bed of needles."

"Sima Yuanli has no title and no reward. He appears carefree, but in truth, he is a running dog, a servile hound, sharing in the nation's anxiety. He lives in fear of the day the True Qi is verified, and the Great Song, having outlived its usefulness, is overthrown. Lingu Lanying has a flawed origin and her divine ability is lacking; no one values her. She has two masters above her, lives in terror of Xiukui stealing her treasure, and is consumed by anxiety..."

"Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing are brilliant today, but they, too, are walking a dangerous cliff path, a road with no clear end. They are just counting the days, fraught with anixety..."

Kuang Yu sipped her wine, the vibrant color in her blue-purple eyes dimming.

"I understand sister's meaning."

Tinglan sighed softly, shared a few more cups, and then rose to her feet.

"Since the crisis here is resolved, I shall return to the blessed land."

She paused, adding with some concern,

"This wine is too strong. You should drink less of it."

Kuang Yu, lost in thought, had been drinking quickly. She watched Tinglan leave, feeling dazed. She frowned at the wine pot, pouting.

"Sister is really something... This whole pot is worth a portion of spiritual resources. Since she already drank a dozen cups, wouldn't it be a waste not to finish... And she dumped it all on me!"

Once the purple-robed Daoist Master had left, the large grotto-mansion felt suddenly empty. Kuang Yu propped her chin on one hand and used the other to pour more wine into her jade cup.

The clear liquid pooled, revealing a faint, tender red. The pale hand set the pot down and, with a flick of her wrist, produced a jade talisman.

The talisman was half a palm long and two fingers wide, glowing with a warm light. It was tied to a red string that snaked around her long, delicate fingertips, dangling and swaying at her wrist.

The dharma lamp flickered. The blue-purple in Kuang Yu's eyes deepened. She was still hesitating when she heard hurried footsteps outside, followed by a joyful female voice:

"Daoist Master... Daoist Master Zhaojing is here!"

"Ah."

Kuang Yu, startled from her reverie, gave a small cry. Whether from wine or panic, the jade talisman slipped from her grasp and clattered onto the table.

A man's smiling voice followed immediately.

"Fellow Daoist Kuang Yu!"

Kuang Yu scrambled to her feet and hurried to the grotto entrance, just as a man in white and gold Daoist robes was stepping inside. Polite as ever, he offered a formal greeting.

"A sudden visit. I fear I've disturbed Fellow Daoist's peaceful cultivation!"

"No matter..."

Kuang Yu, whose nature was normally warm and generous, quickly composed herself. She glanced at him, then turned away with a smile.

"You've come at the right time... I opened a pot of good wine. I was afraid of getting drunk alone. I'll share a sip with you."

Li Ximing had noticed her face was slightly flushed when he entered; now he understood she had been drinking. He found it rather amusing and cupped his hands.

"This is..."

Kuang Yu grinned.

"Wine refined from spiritual resources!"

Li Ximing's brow rose. His tone shifted immediately.

"I can indeed try some."

They moved deeper into the grotto. The jade table was slightly cluttered. A long-necked, emerald-green pot sat upon it, along with two jade cups—one full, one empty. Beside the cups lay a jade talisman.

Kuang Yu's face flushed. She darted forward and snatched the talisman, hiding it in her sleeve. Li Ximing, however, was staring at the empty cup.

"This is..."

She turned back, an impish smile playing on her lips.

"Sister Tinglan was just here. Drank a few cups, got scared, and ran off."

Kuang Yu's personality was a rarity among Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Hearing her tease, Li Ximing smiled helplessly.

"I'm afraid my arrival... interrupted things."

"Oh?"

Kuang Yu motioned for him to sit. She deliberately cleared away the empty cup and replaced it with a new one, smiling. "I'm afraid I interrupted _your_ business! You and Sister Tinglan are old friends. True Yang, Purple Yin, Tianxiu mediating light and dark, in ancient times the three Yins assisted... Your Bright Yang's little affair..."

Li Ximing had just raised the cup of pale red wine. He took a sip, and its strong kick shot straight up his nose. Hearing her bizarre string of words, he nearly coughed, freezing in place.

"Ah?"

Having just spouted nonsense, Kuang Yu saw him put the cup down and look up. No matter how bold her personality, she couldn't bear the scrutiny. She quickly ducked her head, hastily refilled his cup, and said through gritted teeth:

"Please!"

Li Ximing downed the cup in one go. A pleasant heat spread through him. He knew this was potent stuff; drinking it was no loss. He smiled and raised his cup to toast her. But the moment he finished, she refilled it.

The woman had moved closer, her face near his. The blue-purple in her round eyes seemed to glow. She held the pot, bit her lip, and put on a fierce expression.

"Sister Tinglan tricked me into drinking a lot... I can't drink anymore. No wasting allowed!"
