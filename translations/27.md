# Chapter 28: Wan Family

Atop Qingsui Peak, nestled amidst clouds and mist, sat a beautiful pavilion. The soft morning sunlight streamed over the structure, casting a golden glow across its walls.

Li Chejing, seated on a rock in front of the building, slowly exhaled a breath of pure air and opened his eyes to the vast sea of clouds spread before him.

A look of satisfaction crossed his handsome face as he quietly murmured, “I’ve finally managed to condense the Azure Essence Chakra!”

“What an amazing technique my family has! This isn’t your typical Azure Essence mana. I’ve cultivated the Moonlight Azure Essence. Not only that, its effect surpasses those of ordinary techniques.”

Rising to his feet and smoothing out his blue robe, Li Chejing entered the pavilion and retrieved a cold, gleaming sword from the wall. With a flick of his wrist, he gracefully executed a series of sword movements.

“This Profound Water Sword Technique given by my senior brother is a good start. Though it’s a Grade Three technique requiring the Qi Cultivation realm, it’s not difficult to learn.”

“I wonder how Father is doing. Have my older brothers managed to condense the Celestial Whirl Chakra? The Golden Tang Sect’s recent unrest in the west is quite concerning, especially with our families sharing a border.”

Lost in these thoughts, Li Chejing’s focus on sword practice waned. He rested his chin on the table and half-heartedly flipped through a jade slip, his mind wandering back to his distant home.

“Junior brother!” His contemplation was interrupted by a cheerful shout.

It was Xiao Yuansi, a man with thick eyebrows and huge eyes. He entered the pavilion and grinned at Li Chejing. “Guess what good news I’ve brought!” he asked.

“Don’t tease me, senior brother,” Li Chejing shook his head and smiled wryly. He set aside the jade slip and turned his full attention to Xiao Yuansi.

“I’ve been asked by our Master to run an errand at Lixia Prefecture,” Xiao Yuansi revealed, his eyes twinkling. He then inquired, “Do you have a letter for home you’d like me to take?”

Overjoyed, Li Chejing responded enthusiastically, “Yes, yes, thank you so much, senior brother! You’re too kind!” He quickly fetched writing materials and began to write a letter.

Xiao Yuansi smiled and said, “Take your time writing. Just hand it to me by tonight.”

As dawn approached, Li Xiangping emerged from his meditation.

Reflecting on his progress, he thought, My Qihai is nearly full. With another half year of cultivation, I should be ready to attempt condensing the Celestial Whirl Chakra.

He realized that he had been stuck in this stage for almost four years, a pace he considered painfully slow. Jing’er was likely already working toward condensing the Azure Essence Chakra.

As he stepped outside, he found Tian Yun basking in the morning sun at the entrance of the house.

Spotting Li Xiangping, she attempted to rise to her feet, only to be stopped by him.

“Take it easy, especially now that you’re pregnant,” he cautioned.

Tian Yun smiled softly. Looking at her husband’s eyes, she confessed gently, “I’ve been feeling rather sluggish ever since I got pregnant.”

With a yawn, she continued with a tinge of concern, “I’ve heard that Qiuyang is making quick progress in cultivation. I can’t help but worry that if our child doesn’t possess a spiritual orifice, the main family might weaken over time and the side family will grow stronger. That could be detrimental to the future of our family.”

Li Xiangping was taken aback by her confession. He stroked her head affectionately and laughed heartily. “Rest assured, our child will have a spiritual orifice too. I’ll handle everything in the house, so you don’t have to worry about a thing. As for Li Qiuyang, his early condensation of the Profound Scenery Chakra is no cause for concern.”

Reassured by her husband’s words, Tian Yun nestled into his embrace and murmured, “Whatever you say.”

Their moment was interrupted by Liu Linfeng rushing into the courtyard, stopping abruptly upon seeing them. He stood awkwardly with a red face, unsure whether to stay or leave.

Tian Yun, with a gentle smile, excused herself with the help of Ren Ping’er.

Li Xiangping, a little surprised by the interruption, asked Liu Linfeng cheerfully, “Uncle, what brings you here in such a hurry?”

“One of the children from the Liu Family ventured beyond Lidaokou Village, traveling along the Guli Road for miles. He came across a wary farmer there who hastily fled at the sight of us. The child did not dare to chase after him, so he marked the location and returned to report it,” Liu Linfeng delivered his message to Li Xiangping while gasping for breath.

Li Xiangping, knitting his eyebrows together, was about to respond when another figure hurried into the scene. It was Li Yesheng, who appeared just as breathless and flushed.

He had raced all the way from the village entrance and, without pausing to catch his breath, blurted out, “A message from Lichuankou Village—an immortal cultivator, claiming to be from the Wan Family under the Azure Pond Sect’s governance, has arrived for a visit.”

“Dang! He must have found his way here by following that child!” Liu Linfeng cursed under his breath and rebuked himself for not foreseeing this.

Li Xiangping rubbed the bridge of his nose. He exhaled deeply and said, “Let’s not panic. The visitor is also under the Azure Pond Sect’s governance. It’s unlikely that he’ll act aggressively.”

He looked around and then asked, “Where’s Second Brother?”

“The Immortal Master went up the mountain early this morning and hasn’t returned.”

“Uncle, please head to the mountain and inform Second Brother of the situation. Tell him to stay there, and there’s no need to come down. Yesheng, come with me to Lidaokou Village.”

Liu Linfeng acknowledged his order and promptly set off toward the mountain.

Li Xiangping, accompanied by Li Yesheng and a few guards from Lijing Village, hastened along the rural path toward Lidaokou Village.

Upon reaching Lidaokou Village, they encountered Xu Wenshan’s men.

Li Yesheng immediately inquired, “What did that immortal cultivator say?”

The man replied calmly, “That Immortal Master barely speaks and is calmly seated in the boss’ courtyard. He seems to be meditating with his eyes closed.”

At that moment, Li Xiangping and the others reached the entrance of the courtyard. He straightened his clothes and stepped forward to observe the man seated in the courtyard.

The visitor appeared young, likely in his teens, with a decent-looking face and clad in a pristine long white robe. He opened his eyes and looked at Li Xiangping.

Since Li Xiangping had not cultivated the Jade Capital Chakra yet, he lacked the spiritual sense to gauge the young man’s strength.

He cupped his fist respectfully and introduced himself, “I am Li Xiangping, under the governance of Azure Pond Sect,”

To Li Xiangping’s surprise, the young man reacted with evident relief, quickly standing up to respond with due respect. “I am Wan Yuankai, under the governance of Azure Pond Sect. I am honored to meet the head of the Li Family.”

“Oh, please, there’s no need for such formalities. I’m just a humble cultivator in the Li Family. My father is the head of our family,” Li Xiangping replied, waving his hands in denial. Seeing the young man’s deference, Li Xiangping felt a sense of relief and a smile crept onto his face.

“Recently, my father learned about Qingsui Peak’s deployment to the West of the Guli Road and was quite pleased. He sent me to explore the area and establish connections with the local families. It was a mere chance that led me to your village. Please forgive my unannounced visit.”

Wan Yuankai seemed rather excited. After politely apologizing, he then added with a smile, “My father also instructed me to bring a gift for the Li Family.”
