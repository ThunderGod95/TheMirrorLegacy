# Chapter 1175: The Golden Book

'Awaiting the supreme divine…'

As the clear, bright light of the Supreme Yin rained down, Guo Nanwu was left speechless. His Lesser Yang divine ability was quite remarkable, and after a moment of daze, he immediately grasped the situation.

"This is a transformation of the Whole Pill," he asked, "to be able to manipulate the very properties of matter and seize an artifact's abilities for yourself!"

Li Que'wan had already withdrawn her divine ability. She lowered her gaze and, with a flip of her fingers, the small, jade-like ring reappeared in her palm. The young woman returned it with a smile.

"It's merely a minor application."

'A minor application?'

Guo Nanwu felt a thousand retorts die on his tongue and could only manage an awkward smile.

They were all in the Purple Mansion Realm; which of them didn't understand the immense utility of such a divine ability?

'Any Spiritual Artifact whose Dao Lineage doesn't clash with the Whole Pill would, in her hands, exhibit power nearly rivaling its original path. She barely needs to choose her artifacts—she can use whatever falls into her hands!'

'Paired with the Li family's immense resources, couldn't she do as she pleased? She could practically wield the Five Virtues or the Twelve Qi at will...'

Guo Nanwu had always been exceptionally confident in his own divine ability. Heretical Seeking excelled in traversal, perception, and seeking the Dao. While its raw power wasn't the highest, its miraculous utility was certainly top-tier among divine abilities. The only thing that could truly stir his envy was the Whole Pill!

Beside them, Lingdu looked on with surprise, though his expression soon softened with understanding.

"A fine divine ability indeed!"

He rose to his feet with a smile.

"This quality of the Whole Pill cannot be achieved without extraordinary resources. Its miraculous transformations are myriad, so possessing such a divine ability is hardly surprising. Still, it makes one quite envious."

Li Que'wan accepted the praise with grace. The Whole Pill Prime Virtue Theory had, after all, originally come from this very Nine Mounds Dao Lineage. She smiled and offered a respectful bow.

"Senior is too kind. A minor skill, hardly worth displaying before the masters of Nine Mounds…"

Lingdu understood her unspoken meaning and shook his head.

"Our Daoist tradition originated from Changtang, and our founding patriarch cultivated in Jielin. He once left his grotto-heaven to wander the world and had a dear friend who cultivated at Green Pine, one who was exceptionally skilled in the transformation of material properties. This esteemed senior met our patriarch while searching for treasures in the sea and imparted his methods, from which we gained a divine ability or two…"

"It's nothing remarkable. The Dao of the Whole Pill, with its complete and wondrous arts, was immensely popular in ancient times. Most Dao Lineages with deep roots would have some version of it prepared. The number and grade of divine abilities one possesses is a matter of family skill, but whether any disciples can actually take up the practice—that is a matter of family fortune!"

"Unfortunately… for hundreds of years, few have succeeded in attaining the Dao with even these one or two divine abilities."

Li Que'wan was somewhat surprised. She had cultivated the Whole Pill for many years and, compared to the Shamanic Talisman Dao which required mastering a divine ability just to begin, it had always felt simple to her. She fell silent, and Lingdu sighed.

"It is said: With no cause and no path to cultivate one's true nature, one finds shelter and protection in the Purple Yin. Read through the fourteen prefaces of the Golden Book, and ride a carriage of dragon and tiger to question the Plain-Hearted."

"This speaks of the common person's journey of seeking the Dao. 'Cause' refers to opportunity. Cultivators from humble origins, lacking cause and path, who delight in cultivating their true nature, can find spiritual items submitting to them as they sense their life-mandate and forge it into an art. In those days, there was also the unfailing Dao of the Purple Emblem Palace, an offshoot of the True Dao Sect. They were fiercely protective of their own and beloved by junior cultivators…"

"But even those two paths could not compare to the fourteen profound outlines of the golden books released by the Prime Virtue Daoist tradition. They were placed upon the Dragon Tiger Platform for any and all to peruse. The texts varied in difficulty, but as long as a cultivator seeking the Dao could read one through, someone would immediately arrive to receive them. If one of the highest volumes was stirred, a mystic carriage would descend to carry the person directly into a grotto-heaven…"

Lingdu's gaze grew complex as he looked at Li Que'wan, his voice dropping.

"Our Daoist tradition has Prime Virtue transformations and a Whole Pill inheritance… yet this divine ability of yours, I have never heard of it. I fear it was an unteachable secret, even in ancient times!"

Hearing this, how could Li Que'wan fail to understand his unspoken suspicion?

'He thinks our family's Dao Lineage is simply too profound!'

But as the thought crossed her mind, how could she not feel a jolt of shock and doubt herself?

'The fourteen prefaces of the Golden Book…'

The true name of the Dao Lineage she had received from the Talisman Seed was the Golden Book of Divine Attendance!

She paused for a moment before asking softly, "I wonder, what were the names of those Golden Books?"

Lingdu shook his head in regret. Li Que'wan could only set the matter aside. Still anxious about the situation at the lake, she changed the subject.

"Now that I have the Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure, this junior must hurry back to treat King Wei's injuries!"

"Wait a moment."

Lingdu, however, was in no rush. He held up a hand to stop her and retrieved two small, pitch-black bowls from his sleeve, placing them on the jade table. The old man's expression turned serious.

"Years ago, your family's Daoist Master Zhaojing left behind a spiritual fire called Radiant Crimson Fiendfire. He asked our Daoist tradition to dissolve a century's worth of refined Buddhist radiance from within it. It took some effort, but the task is complete."

"He does not wish to take the fire back. Instead, he wishes to trade it to our Daoist tradition for Radiant Fire. So, I have selected a few items from the Nine Mounds Daoist Treasury for you to choose from and take back."

Li Que'wan glanced down. The contents of one pottery bowl glowed crimson; it had to be some form of Radiant Fire. She heard Lingdu stroking his beard as he spoke.

"This is Mountain-Levelling Radiant Fire. Its power is not great, but it is tinged with the essence of Blazing Fire and possesses the power to break through chaotic restrictions. Ordinary vessels cannot contain it; only a pottery bowl coated with Returning Earth can hold it."

Beside the bowl were glazed boxes containing spiritual water and spiritual wood. Li Que'wan paused. As a cultivator of the Whole Pill, her understanding of the paths of water and fire was not shallow. A single glance was enough for a preliminary judgment.

'This Mountain-Levelling Radiant Fire… its power is truly lacking. Among all Radiant Fires, it can only be considered low-grade…'

When Li Ximing had brought the Radiant Crimson Fiendfire, he hadn't provided Nine Mounds with adequate compensation, but he had mentioned that the quality of the Radiant Fire did not matter. Nine Mounds was honorable in its dealings; the Mountain-Levelling Radiant Fire they offered was weak, but its disruptive quality made it a decent trade.

She was also familiar with Li Jiangqian's art, the Great Radiance of White Brilliance. It required Radiant Fire to gather Li-Light, so having more was always beneficial. After a moment's hesitation, she asked,

"Senior Guo, since you've come from the mainland, have you heard any news of my elder brother? I wonder if he has made his breakthrough…"

Guo Nanwu nodded in praise.

"Your esteemed brother achieved the status of a Daoist Master of the Radiant Fire nature some time ago!"

Breaking through to a divine ability was a trial of life and death. Even with cultivation resources no worse than those of a Golden Core direct heir and possessing immense talent, the danger of failure was ever-present. The worry on Li Que'wan's brow finally eased, replaced by a touch of joy.

'Excellent! With his talent, ascending to the Purple Mansion Realm was never in doubt.'

Since Li Jiangqian had succeeded, their family certainly wouldn't mind more Radiant Fire. But Li Que'wan thought a step further. While committing the offered items to memory, she said hesitantly,

"A matter decided by a senior is not for this junior to change. However, King Wei is injured, and we do not know what spiritual items he urgently requires. Why not allow this junior to take these back first? Once I have news, I can send a letter at an opportune time."

Seeing her eagerness to return, Lingdu did not detain her further. He rose and walked her to the mountain gate. Before she departed, the old Daoist Master said,

"Since you attained the Dao here on Nine Mounds Mountain, there is a strand of fate between us. The great Dao Lineages guard their Whole Pill inheritances closely and do not lend them out. If you find no better options, prepare sufficient resources, and Nine Mounds can help you continue your path."

She had cultivated and broken through on his mountain, and the old master had treated her with a care rivaling that of his own disciples. Li Que'wan was already deeply surprised by his generosity. Hearing this offer now left her feeling somewhat overwhelmed.

"Nine Mounds has shown me immense kindness. This junior is already ashamed and dares not ask for a Dao Lineage…"

Lingdu simply smiled and watched as she departed, disappearing into the Great Void. Only then did he gather the spiritual items and turn to Daoist Master Fu Chi, who had been waiting patiently at his side.

Stroking his beard, he said, "The Mountain-Levelling Radiant Fire was originally for you. The Radiant Crimson Fiendfire is a form of Blazing Fire, which is even better. We will keep it and give it to you. If the Mountain-Levelling Radiant Fire is returned, that will be yours as well."

Daoist Master Fu Chi bowed deeply. Before he could speak, Lingdu waved his hand gently.

"You are heading to the mainland, where King Wei's protection will be crucial. Que'wan is no small fish, either. A good relationship with the Li family could save your life at a critical moment!"

"Senior's great kindness… Dantai Jin… can never repay it!"

Daoist Master Fu Chi's expression was complicated as he bowed his head low.

"Years ago," Lingdu said softly, "Great Daoist Master Yuanxiu chose that Blazing Fire, which rectifies wood qi, for you. Firstly, it was a casual move on the board as he sought his own Dao. Secondly, it was to cultivate you. He intended to use your superior talent with Blazing Fire to support Sima Yuanli's path of Upright Wood…"

Dantai Jin lifted his head, his eyes clear and pure.

"The Great Daoist Master is my master and like a father to me," he said in a low voice. "Yuanli is my dearest friend, closer than a brother. I feel nothing but affection for them. How could I begrudge his intentions after so many years of care?"

Hearing this, the old Daoist Master fell silent for a moment before letting out a long sigh.

"Pack your things. It is time to go to the mainland."

---

In the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

White qi swirled through the lower levels of a pavilion. Dharma lamps shone brightly, their light flowing like a gentle stream over the face of a young man seated at the center.

The colorful patterns on Li Zhouwei's face had faded, leaving only a network of cracks, dark as shattered porcelain. His tightly shut eyes twitched, then slowly opened.

The accumulated colors within them were gone. Fractured shades of gold and black swirled deep within his eyes, like pale golden sand scattered across a dark earth, as if a pavilion had collapsed into ruin within their depths.

"Hoo…"

He exhaled a final, thick cloud of Wu Earth qi. As his pupils gradually focused, he stood, clenching and unclenching his fists, feeling the splintering pain that radiated from every corner of his body. A hint of surprise touched his expression.

Under the protection of the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth had become like water without a source, its terrifying power no longer amplifying. But as a Flawless element, the resilience of Wu Earth was formidable. Purging the residual Wu Light was still a task requiring patient effort.

This was especially true for Li Zhouwei, a cultivator of Bright Yang.

Yet now, streams of white qi were surging forth, rising to the occasion. Like a spring breeze melting snow, they swept through his body, steadily driving the Wu Light out.

The Profound Vastness Art!

This wondrous method of Pure Qi originated from the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. Li Zhouwei had begun practicing it upon entering the Purple Mansion Realm and it had since become quite effective, playing a significant role in his recovery on several occasions. Yet, it had always been reliable, never remarkable.

If Bright Yang's speed at resolving residual Veiled Yin injuries was a ten, unrelated Dao Lineage injuries a five, and Dawn Qi injuries a torturously slow one, then the Pure Qi of the Profound Vastness Art was a constant four, regardless of the injury.

The art was incredibly consistent, never wavering. Even against the Flawless Wu Earth, it maintained its unhurried pace. For an injury like this, however, that was considered extremely fast.

'Two months…'

Only two months had passed since the victory at Baihai Creek, yet the residual Wu Light in his body was completely gone.

Though the light had receded to reveal a body ravaged by wounds, it meant that Li Zhouwei could finally begin the true healing process.

'But not only is the root of the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth still lodged in my body, these grievous wounds are far worse than any I have suffered before.'

His duel with Qi Lanyan had been a one-on-one affair, so the White Qilin's connection to his fate hadn't been deeply triggered. Furthermore, all the divine ability and dharma power fed back to him by Illuminating Sun and Moon had been spent suppressing the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth during the pacification of Jianghuai and the slaying of Maha. He was utterly depleted and would have to rely on pills to recover, like any ordinary cultivator.

He straightened up, stretched, and walked towards another room in the pavilion. There, he saw a man with ruby-red lips and a face as pale as porcelain, sitting before a white gauze screen. His vacant pupils were fixed on a Daoist scripture in his hands, his expression blank.

"Grand-uncle!"

Li Zhouwei's voice hung in the air. The light in the man's eyes immediately dimmed. His hands went slack, and a jade slip tumbled to the floor. The gauze screen behind him fell away as the Daoist Master, clad in white and gold robes, rose from his mat, a pleased look on his face.

Li Zhouwei smiled.

"Grand-uncle, your esoteric art has crossed the threshold!"

Coming from someone with Li Zhouwei's high standards, "crossed the threshold" was no small compliment. Seeing that the vibrant, unhealthy colors on his grand-nephew's face had vanished, Li Ximing grew even more pleased.

"It's just a minor trick, refined with Valley Water. I figured that using a gauze to conceal my true form would align with the essence of Valley Water. I added a few other items of the same nature, and it truly is much more comfortable!" He paused, his gaze sharpening. "You've… purged the Wu Light?"

When Li Zhouwei nodded, Li Ximing offered a word of praise before picking up a pill formula. His expression turned serious.

"Over the past few days, I've studied these three recipes. They vary in difficulty and wonder. I've been trying to figure out how to refine them with the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art…"

"The Yin Solemn Treasure Body Powder, which Daoist Master Che Hong of Chunyi called the simplest, is actually the least suitable. The Mystic Shore Spirit-Guiding Pill has a peaceful nature, grand and bright, so it's worth a try. The Azure Step Flawless Pill, however, places the most importance on one's intrinsic position and contains a faint echo of the Dao of Transformations, making it the most compatible."

"But even with the most suitable one, the Azure Step Flawless Pill, success is not guaranteed with the Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art… The difficulty lies in…"

The Daoist Master's own injuries were not yet healed, but he seemed to have forgotten them completely. He hesitated.

"Because it is an ancient art, and a grand pill formula I have never attempted, I must alter the methods of the ancient cultivators—transforming a pill that refines nature and life-mandate as one into a pill that uses nature to supplement life-mandate. My confidence… is not high. I fear it may take several failures…"

Failure in alchemy was common, but this was the first time Li Ximing had ever sounded so uncertain. A single failure meant the spiritual resources invested would be lost, and the accompanying secondary herbs would likely be destroyed as well.

Li Zhouwei, however, was unconcerned. He glanced down at the faintly warm jade talisman at his waist. A thought stirred in his mind, and he nodded.

"Let's not rush this. Allow me to make a trip outside first."
