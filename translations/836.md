# Chapter 836: A Meeting of Two Sects

"On the twenty-first of mid-spring, Daoist Master Yuanxiu of the Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition attempted his ascension at Stonetang Atoll in the Southern Sea. Heavenly thunder roared and colossal waves surged, but he failed. As the elements raged, malevolent forces emerged, and he was ultimately bound and slain by the Underworld."

"Three days later, the winds died, the rains fell, and the spiritual energy of the Southern Sea was forever altered."

Li Jiangqian stared at the letter, his mind reeling in disbelief. He read the words again, but they made no more sense than the first time.

'So abrupt…' he thought. 'There was no decree, no invitations sent to observe the ceremony. He just… suddenly went to the Southern Sea for his breakthrough. I wonder how his tribulation compared to those of the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.'

He clutched the letter, his thoughts racing.

'Then again, it's hard to say. News might have circulated among those at the Purple Mansion Realm, far beyond the reach of a minor cultivator like myself. I heard Daoist Master Yuanxiu cultivated the path of Upright Wood. That would explain the recent period of abundant resources in the Southern Sea.'

He turned the letter over and read the next line:

"Fairy Autumnlake has broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, achieving the Frigid Animus Divine Ability."

Though the message was brief, its implications were immense. Ning Wan’s cultivation method was far more well-known than Yuanxiu’s. The Daoist Master’s Upright Wood path was a rarity, unlike any conventional cultivation of the wood element, so few understood his divine ability. Ning Wan, however, had been famous even during her Qi Refining days. The Frigid Animus was a common Daoist tradition in Jiangnan; its power evoked blizzards, and even whispers from the Azure Pond Sect spoke of its might.

'The Azure Pond Sect is about to change hands.'

The Si family had few descendants, and their grip on the sect was already tenuous. Now, with Yuanxiu dead and Si Yuanli in seclusion, Dantai Jin and Tongyi would have no choice but to take their cues from Ning Wan.

At his side, Li Xuanxuan understood immediately. He smiled, stroking his beard. “Send a congratulatory gift at once,” he urged.

This was excellent news for the Li family. Li Jiangqian’s spirits soared as he summoned an attendant. “I recall we have a portion of Pinefrost Dew in the treasury,” he began. “Though it’s only a Foundation Establishment Realm spiritual item, it aligns perfectly with her cultivation. Also…”

He paused, considering. Most of the family’s valuable assets were currently with Li Ximing, leaving them with little to offer that was truly impressive. Yet a gift like this could not be delayed; its timeliness was as crucial a sign of sincerity as its value.

“Years ago, Father brought back a basket of Riverstream Pearls. They’re quite precious. We planned to refine them into a set of Dharma artifacts, but the sheer number—a full sixteen of them—made it too difficult, so they’ve remained unused. Why not... send those as the gift?”

Li Xuanxuan winced at the suggestion. There was a reason that basket of pearls had never been refined: it was a set of sixteen individual Foundation Establishment Realm spiritual items, all with interconnected auras. The frugal old man couldn't bear the thought of giving away something so valuable. “That gift is far too extravagant,” he said, hesitating. “It’s on par with something a Purple Mansion Realm master would give personally. And it would be a terrible shame to break up the set. Let’s think of another way…”

Li Jiangqian nodded. He had hoped to put the Azure Pond Sect further in their debt, his thoughts secretly drifting to Li Xuanfeng’s heirloom, White Lightning. The artifact was likely a spiritual artifact in its embryonic stage, but whether anyone could wield it was another matter... Still, since Li Xuanxuan had spoken, he would naturally defer.

“Then transcribe a copy of the *Frigid Pine Dewy Snow Art* and send it to the Daoist Master,” Li Xuanxuan instructed. “Also, make it clear that our family’s Daoist Master is cultivating abroad and is unaware of matters on the mainland. He cannot pay his respects in person but will certainly make amends in the future.”

Li Jiangqian added, “We should have Li Chengpan lead the delegation, with Master Cui accompanying him, to show the importance we place on this.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded slightly. “And summon that rascal Zhouming and Li Chenghao as well!”

Li Chenghao was one of the few remaining Qi Refining elders of the main family branch and the paternal uncle of the Li Zhoufang brothers. He had once made things difficult for Li Zhouluo and been demoted to managing affairs in Milin Prefecture, but he was recalled the moment tensions with the Capital immortals dao rose.

Li Xuanxuan’s reasoning was clear. Of the Xi generation, their family had one Purple Mansion Realm master: Li Ximing. Below them, in the Chengming generation, Li Chenghuai was set on going to the Southern Sea. That boy had the heart of a true seeker and couldn't be held back. That left only Li Chenghao and Li Minggong. Li Xuanxuan had summoned him now precisely so that Li Jiangqian would entrust him with more responsibility.

The three were all on the island, and they arrived soon after being summoned. Li Chenghao was at the front, his expression stern and his robes immaculate. Li Zhouming, dressed in vibrant red, was his complete opposite, sauntering along behind him. Bringing up the rear was Li Chengpan, his head bowed.

When Li Jiangqian explained the situation, Li Cheng’s face lit up. “A truly joyous occasion! You can leave the matter to me!”

Years ago, Li Chenghao had caused trouble for Li Zhouluo while trying to protect Li Chengpan. His heart was fiercely loyal to his kin, and he had always felt the clan’s leadership was too harsh, a sentiment that had kept him from positions of power. Yet he was also the one who cared most for the family’s reputation. If an outsider dared to slander the Li name, he would be the first to fly into a rage. His competence was not in question, making him a suitable choice for this task.

'Besides,' Li Xuanxuan sighed internally, 'there aren't many left in the family who can properly represent us.'

His tone, however, was stern as he spoke. “Zhouming, you will go with them. Listen to your elders.”

As the direct grandson of a Purple Mansion Realm master, Li Zhouming’s presence would show adequate respect. The young man in red nodded repeatedly, a cheeky grin on his face. “Old Master, what are you saying? When have I ever disobeyed? It’s always been whatever the masters say, goes!”

Li Zhouming had once put Li Chenghao and the others in an incredibly awkward position, and Li Xuanxuan worried there was still a rift between them, hoping more contact might mend it. Fortunately, the boy showed no signs of embarrassment, smiling broadly as if nothing had ever happened, addressing the others warmly as ‘Uncle’ and ‘Master.’

Li Chenghao, for his part, would not dare show him disrespect. Li Ximing, the Daoist Master who had single-handedly elevated their family to the status of an Immortal Clan by reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, rarely appeared, but his prestige among the clan was absolute. If Li Ximing suddenly demanded a new palace built for his leisure, Li Chenghao would be the first to start digging the foundations. He bowed with great solemnity. “Greetings, Young Master... Please, after you.”

Once the three had departed, Li Jiangqian couldn’t help but sigh in admiration. “Old Master, your painstaking efforts are truly something this junior respects.”

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard and shook his head. “Our goals are merely different. You focus on the clan’s worldly interests, while I only hope to mend the rifts between our branches. If we are not united within, any external gains are meaningless.”

Li Xuanxuan paused, about to ask about the situation in the north, when a purple mist began to suffuse the air over the lake, flanked by billowing clouds. A female attendant in purple robes approached and knocked on the hall doors. “Reporting to the masters of the Moongaze Immortal Clan,” she announced. “Daoist Master Tinglan of the Profound Grotto of Taixu Purple Qi Gate has come to visit.”

Li Jiangqian froze for a second, realizing that Daoist Master Tinglan, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, was visiting in her official capacity representing the Purple Smoke Gate. He immediately descended the side steps and bowed. “Greetings to the emissary of the Taixu Purple Qi dao. Our humble clan awaits the Daoist Master.”

At his words, the purple mist before the hall coalesced, and a female Daoist Master in autumn-yellow robes stepped out of the Great Void. Two faint, yellow floral markings at the corners of her eyes glowed softly. Li Jiangqian respectfully ushered her inside.

As she was a Purple Mansion Realm master, he led her directly to the seat of honor. The great doors swung shut behind them. Tinglan first offered a nod to Li Xuanxuan and engaged in some polite conversation—inquiring about the old master’s health and the clan’s prosperity. Li Xuanxuan was, after all, Li Ximing’s grandfather, and she paid him the respect he was due. Only then did she get to the point.

“I have already met with fellow Daoist Ximing in the east,” she began. “I have returned for two reasons.”

She inclined her head. “First, the spirit pill that fellow Daoist Ximing promised me has been successfully refined. The Purple Smoke Gate is not a tradition that goes back on its word. Our business overseas is largely concluded, so I will be bringing my people over to construct the defensive array for your clan.”

Li Jiangqian had no idea what kind of precious pill the two masters had concocted, but it must have been of monumental importance for her to repay the favor with an entire clan array. He cupped his fists respectfully. “We are grateful, Daoist Master!”

Tinglan smiled, clearly pleased. “The second matter,” she continued, “concerns Jiangbei. Daoist Master Qiushui of the Golden Feather Sect had originally sought Senior Yuanxiu for aid. However, the senior declined, citing his imminent breakthrough. Soon after, he staked his life in pursuit of the Dao and ascended. We are all part of the Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. To keep Jiangnan from descending into chaos, and to respectfully see the True Monarch off on his journey north, we must now turn our attention to the situation in Jiangbei.”

Li Jiangqian could only bow his head in deference. “Thank you, Daoist Master!”

Tinglan’s intentions were clear. The factions of Jiangnan wished to avoid being dragged into the unfolding chaos, and the collective of Supreme Yang Dao traditions had chosen her to manage the Jiangbei situation. Her presence at Moongaze Lake was a tacit acknowledgment that the Li family was considered part of their alliance.

'A blessing or a curse?' Li Jiangqian wondered. He knew well enough that the cultivators of the Supreme Yang Dao were an arrogant lot. They had held their territories in Jiangnan for centuries, their positions unshakable, and they looked down on both the Eastern Sea cultivators and rogue cultivators. The Li clan was only afforded a measure of courtesy because they held the title of Bright Yang and had been acknowledged as a righteous sect by the Immortal Mansion long ago. But for them to be truly accepted? Li Jiangqian didn't believe it for a moment.

'This must be a personal gesture of goodwill from Tinglan,' he concluded. The Jiangnan sects wanted the True Monarch’s activities to remain far from their borders, but the exact location of that border was flexible. By choosing Moongaze Lake as her base, Tinglan was subtly extending her protection over his family.

He waited for several moments, but Tinglan didn't press for details about Jiangbei. He was just about to broach the subject himself when a sound like falling snow rustled outside. Through the doors, he saw a woman in white step out of the Great Void. She wore a simple white dress, cinched with a delicate silk sash that accentuated her slender waist. Her features were gentle, almost demure, but her eyes held an icy clarity. The moment she set foot on the ground, a palpable chill descended upon the grand hall.

It was Fairy Autumnlake, Ning Wan!

'So, they were waiting for her!' Li Jiangqian realized. 'Even the Azure Pond Sect has to take a hand in this…' He quickly banished the thoughts from his mind, bowing respectfully to the newly arrived master before stepping back.

Tinglan rose to greet her, her expression polite but tinged with surprise. “Who could have been so foolish as to provoke such anger in my dear sister?”

Tinglan was only perhaps twenty years older than Ning Wan, and since both their families hailed from the Supreme Yang Dao, the familiar address was appropriate.

“Senior, you are too kind. You can just call me Wan’er,” Ning Wan replied. “And I’m not truly angry. It’s just… since I cultivated Serene Listen, dealing with the people in my own sect has become quite unsettling.”

Tinglan’s expression shifted to one of understanding. “Of course. Serene Listen is a Life Divine Ability. The power to hear the thoughts of others… it is bound to cause complications.”

Ning Wan offered Li Jiangqian a faint, kind nod, but with another Purple Mansion Realm master present, she did not speak to him further. She took a seat to the side and said quietly, “When my elder was alive, he had many strange moods I could never understand. Now that I have my own Life Divine Ability, I realize he was an exceptionally patient man. The stray thoughts one happens to hear... they can be profoundly disappointing.”

“It’s not that I actively pry into people's minds; Serene Listen doesn't work that way. But the moment someone harbors a malicious thought, the ability alerts me as a warning. It’s a protective instinct, much like a defensive Dharma Art that activates on its own to block an attack. But the things I heard… By the time I left the Azure Pond Sect, I nearly lost control and killed someone.”

Her face was grim, her normally gentle features frozen in a mask of cold anger. It was clear she had overheard a great deal within her sect, and the sight sent a fresh wave of fear through Li Jiangqian, who stood rigidly, staring at his own feet.

Tinglan gave a complex sigh. “The Azure Pond Sect is already in good shape, having been thoroughly cleansed by Senior Yuanxiu once. It would be far worse in a place like the Eastern Sea, where the moral climate is rotten. That senior I mentioned… he also possessed Serene Listen.”

Ning Wan had no desire to speak more of her own ability. She changed the subject. “Senior Yuanxiu… Daoist Master, were you able to observe his tribulation?”

“I was. I rushed back from the east and almost missed it,” Tinglan said with a long sigh. “Daoist Master Zimu of my Purple Smoke tradition was also there to witness it. He watched for a long time before simply shaking his head and uttering a single phrase.”

Ning Wan would not let such a chance to grasp a profound insight pass her by. Her eyes lit with anticipation. “And what did the Great Daoist Master say?”

Tinglan nodded. “The old falcon’s body is heavy; where can it find a branch to rest? A mountain chamber is easily shaken, but the Upright Wood cannot be moved.”

Ning Wan mulled over the sixteen words, but she could only grasp the most literal meaning: 'the Upright Wood cannot be moved.' She looked at Tinglan and said, “The Great Daoist Master’s cultivation has reached the level of heaven and earth. As expected of one who cultivates the Heavenly Purple Qi, his grasp of profound truths is far beyond our own.” After a slight pause, she added quietly, “I saw Daoist Master Chi.”

There was only one Daoist Master Chi she could be referring to: the long-missing Great Daoist Master, Chi Buzi.

Tinglan considered this for a moment. “A seeker of the Dao, so detached by his very nature. A true pity.”

Ning Wan seemed to have her own suspicions and didn’t press for an explanation of why it was a pity. Tinglan nodded with a smile, a faint purple light swirling in her hand. “Our meeting here today at the Li residence shows that we are of one mind. About the situation in Jiangbei…”

At last, she turned her gaze to Li Jiangqian. “What news does the Li clan have?”

Li Jiangqian dared not let his focus waver for a second, concentrating entirely on the matter of Jiangbei. “Reporting to the two Daoist Masters,” he said respectfully. “Jiangbei is currently in a state of chaos. Most of the sects have withdrawn their influence and sealed their mountain gates. The Xuanmiao Temple has taken the most drastic measures. They controlled few prefectures to begin with, but now they have activated their defensive arrays and recalled all disciples from abroad, as if intending to seal off their mountain entirely. The northern sects are pushing further north, and the southern sects are retreating south, leaving sixty percent of Jiangbei’s heartlands completely vacant. In many of these abandoned territories, demonic cultivators and Demon beasts are already on the rise, plaguing the land!”
