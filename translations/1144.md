# Chapter 1144: The Bright Yang Assault

Maha Nuzi was by no means a low-ranking figure among his kind. His deep ties to the Peacock had saved his skin on several occasions, leaving him unscathed to this day.

And yet... his status and importance were nothing compared to Vast Cicada's in his prime. Even Nuzi's own master, Sparrow Carp Fish, had only been Vast Cicada's equal before purging his wicked roots.

So when a curtain of absolute, lightless black descended upon the sky, the terror in the Maha's heart was palpable. A frigid dread flooded his mind, and his Dharma Body trembled, unleashing streams of radiant light.

His first instinct was to defend against the Audience with the Celestial Gate.

'Killing me won't be nearly as troublesome as it was for Vast Cicada,' he thought. 'The moment the Audience with the Celestial Gate pins me down, the Radiant Sun King's Halberd will be coming for my throat!'

The thought flashed through his mind like lightning as the Enlightened Artifact in his hand—a jade vase—shot forth to intercept the streaking golden light.

Only then did a glint of gold emerge from the darkness. The royal halberd was like a sliver of Heavenly Light hidden in the night, thrusting forward with a blade of light so dense it had condensed into a solid white edge.

BOOM!

The jade vase was Nuzi’s new Treasured Artifact, designed specifically to suppress anything that got too close. It unleashed a cascading torrent of brilliance, a waterfall of light meant to overwhelm the Heavenly Light of the halberd.

But the long halberd erupted with power. A dense, pale-white Heavenly Light rippled out from its crescent blade. The light, like a lone beam in the night, touched the edge of the jade vase and spread with lightning speed, freezing the entire waterfall of brilliance—a cascade that resembled the heavenly rivers—in mid-air.

[Bindling Light]!

'He... what new technique has he acquired?!'

Radiant light erupted from Nuzi's entire body like a volley of a thousand arrows, meant to drive back any encroaching light. But the golden-eyed young man's gaze remained calm as faint golden scales materialized on his face.

Sovereign's Perilous Tread.

BOOM!

A massive, iridescent white light surged upward, rushing into the endless darkness of the sky. Just as it began to expand amidst a piercing scream, a torrential storm of black-gold light descended, slamming the white light back down onto the desert.

Amidst the earth-shattering crack, King Wei spun his halberd. His golden eyes flickered to the side, catching a flash of pink light soaring in from beyond the immediate battlefield. In that instant, the desert illusion vanished, and rows of golden figures reappeared between heaven and earth. Then came the furious roars.

"The Qilin is here!"

BOOM!

As the desert faded, Nuzi’s colossal golden form struggled back to its feet, still towering in the sky. But to the shock and fury of his brethren, his face was now a web of cracks. His form was rapidly fading, and his eyes, flickering between light and dark, were vacant and dazed.

"You despicable coward!"

Maha Nuzi couldn't muster a curse. He forced a brilliant light to shine from his eyes, barely maintaining the dignity of a Maha. In truth, his head was spinning, and he couldn't even process the strange looks from his brethren. He felt the Heavenly Light that had pierced his Dharma Body and his heart shook.

'Is... is he even human?'

He, Nuzi, wasn't the strongest of the Buddhist cultivators, but he was a Maha nonetheless... and yet he couldn't even block a single blow from this White Qilin! The wound itself wasn't severe, but it was an incredibly dangerous sign—Li Zhouwei had done this with just his halberd.

Nuzi's mind went blank with terror, but the expression on Zhelu, the thousand-eyed Maha, was even uglier. As a veteran Maha, his insight was far more discerning.

'Li Zhouwei's weapon has changed... It's not that useless spirit embryo anymore... it's an exceptional Spiritual Artifact, nearly on par with a Spiritual Treasure!'

In the next instant, the thousand-eyed Maha's gaze turned to ice. A thick cascade of golden energy poured down as Situ Huo appeared, his long blade razor-sharp and radiating boundless, ferocious power.

Zhelu, however, was not surprised.

Among all the cultivators present, he was the only sixth-life Maha, his divine abilities the most profound. He was also a Maha of the Liangli rank. Neither Li Zhouwei nor Situ Huo would ever allow him to act freely, so it was only natural that Situ Huo would be the one to face him.

'Li Zhouwei is a Bright Yang, after all...'

The 'Bright Yang' path disdains the weak and revels in overpowering the strong. While Li Zhouwei and Situ Huo possessed similar divine abilities, when it came to slaughtering these first and second-life Mahas, the White Qilin's speed was nothing short of terrifying.

The thousand-eyed Maha's expression was grim. He knew he should have intervened to stop Li Zhouwei and prevent further losses, yet he remained inwardly calm and made no move to act.

'I don't care what trump cards you have, Qi Lanyan... if anyone's going to get hurt, it'll be one of your people from the Way of Great Desire. As long as they're not killed outright, it doesn't matter...'

Zhelu remained unhurried, but terror seized Nuzi's heart. King Wei’s figure materialized before him once more, halberd leveled, its tip gleaming. The interplay of darkness and sunset across the king's face jolted the Maha to a terrible realization.

'That bastard Zhelu!'

BOOM!

Without hesitation, Nuzi erupted in a blaze of light, transforming into a sky-filling cascade of sand and wind as his figure vanished into the distance. At the same moment, another golden figure stepped forward, willfully meeting Li Zhouwei’s golden blade.

This new combatant was built like a bear, clad in resplendent golden armor that radiated a heavy, imposing aura. His four eyes, multicolored and seemingly forged from metal, watched intently. With two crossed clubs, he blocked the halberd's advance.

It was Maha Bashan.

Advancement among the Buddhist cultivators was all about patronage. Nuzi had once been Sparrow Carp Fish's "Merciful One," and Bashan, in turn, had been Nuzi's. Seats were limited in the Buddhist Land; there were countless cultivators like the Five-Eyed and Chiluo. Only those with connections could ascend the ranks.

Maha Bashan himself was a prodigy of the Buddhist path, born with immense strength. He was unskilled in spell arts, having spent untold ages tempering his Dharma Body. Now, as his golden clubs met the attack, their sheer force sent the royal halberd flying high into the air.

"Oh?"

A look of keen delight, like a hunter spotting his prey, crossed Li Zhouwei's face. The royal halberd in his hand became a blur, moving like the wind and casting light in all directions as it rained down blows. The Spiritual Artifact was incredibly heavy, each strike landing like a falling mountain, littering the golden body with sparks and dents.

Bashan had strength in excess but lacked agility. His Dharma Body shuddered under the assault, fine cracks spreading across its surface as he bitterly endured. Finally, he saw an opening. He thrust his twin clubs into the halberd's crescent blade, locking it in place. An explosion of Radiant Fire erupted, and the halberd's shaft bent under the strain.

But King Wei's smile only widened.

The halberd's radiance intensified to its absolute peak. All the ambient white light converged, transforming into brilliant white patterns that spread across the blade.

[Bright King]!

'If I had been using my full strength... would you have dared to keep taking my hits, letting me build up the light of my [Bright King]?'

The mirth in his golden eyes flickered for just a moment. The golden patterns on his face flashed as he tightened his two-handed grip on the shaft. With a surge of force, he rotated the moon-like crescent blade.

A grinding screech...

Bashan’s face fell. The power—both divine ability and raw strength—surging from the blade suddenly multiplied several times over. His golden body began to tremble, forced sideways at a slow but inexorable pace. The brilliant light of their struggle grew ever brighter until it burst like a collapsing dam. Maha Bashan’s expression twisted in alarm.

King Wei released one hand, holding the halberd with casual, single-handed ease.

Shock filled Maha Bashan's eyes as Li Zhouwei’s free hand reached for his waist and unfastened a battle-axe, its golden head gleaming brightly.

The ever-stoic Bashan finally lost his composure, his face paling in horror. His grip slackened for a fraction of a second, and with the force of a landslide, he was sent crashing to the ground at a terrifying speed.

CRASH!

A beam of light descended from the heavens, and Bashan’s mount—a ferocious tiger—stepped out of the void, revealing its true form. The ground shook as, with a surge of profound power, it lunged for King Wei's back.

'Excellent!'

Far from being angered, King Wei was delighted. He spun around, his uncanny golden eyes meeting the tiger’s. The sky drained of all color, replaced by an encroaching darkness from which a lone sunset bled. And then, the vast Celestial Gate descended from nothingness.

The Audience with the Celestial Gate!

'I've been waiting for you!'

A mournful cry shook the heavens. The magnificent Celestial Gate landed, and the Crimson Severing Arrowhead vanished like a fleeting dream. Li Zhouwei had already drifted forward, the profound power of his Sovereign's Perilous Tread neutralizing a volley of incoming attacks. He leveled his halberd once more, targeting Bashan as he struggled to his feet.

CLANG!

A light bloomed in the darkness. An intricately patterned, demon-quelling lotus, seemingly forged from dark gold, materialized to block the vicious halberd, erupting in a brilliant flash of shattering light upon impact.

[Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions]!

The appearance of this famed Enlightened Artifact—one Zhelu had spent nearly a century refining, the very same one that had once heavily wounded Daoist Master Zhu Gong's Dharma Body in a single blow—finally brought a momentary halt to the collapsing situation, forcing Li Zhouwei to pause.

But across the battlefield, the terrified Buddhist cultivators felt no trace of joy.

In just a few short exchanges, King Wei had torn through them like a tiger among sheep, his assault shaking the very earth. The Buddhists who had been maintaining the siege were thrown into chaos, afraid to advance and afraid to retreat. Even Zhelu, locked in combat with Situ Huo, felt his expression genuinely change for the first time.

Zhelu had been there when Vast Cicada fell. While Li Zhouwei’s battle-axe had been what drove him back, his true fear stemmed from the Dharma Master's miscalculation. Today, that weight on his heart felt even heavier.

'In terms of pure combat, Li Zhouwei's divine abilities are second to none in the entire Song Kingdom! Even Yang Ruiyi... would be at a disadvantage without resorting to his hidden aces.'

But in the next instant, that heaviness turned to shock.

The dark gold lotus bloomed in the sky, but it brought Bashan no comfort. The halberd that had struck the [Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions] dissolved like a reflection of the moon in water, only for the real weapon—now covered in swirling white patterns—to bypass the Enlightened Artifact and press against the throat of his Dharma Body!

CLANG!

As expected, Nuzi hadn't fled far. He unleashed a thick beam of golden light he had been gathering. King Wei simply flicked a hand, sending out a streak of his own light.

'The Pure Yang Bracelets!'

Bashan's vision filled with a dim, yellow haze, as if a dark light had exploded before him. A metallic ringing filled his ears. The lotus that had just saved him was gone.

The halberd plunged through as the battle-axe erupted with blinding light.

The new halberd, the [White-Forged Rekindled King], was the final piece of his assault, like adding wings to a tiger. From the restorative power of the Sovereign's Perilous Tread to his White Qilin Dharma Body, from the [First Strike] that could bypass Enlightened Artifacts to the imprisoning [Binding Light]—he had constructed a series of techniques that were incredibly costly to counter.

Anyone who couldn't overcome that threshold would have no choice but to take the blow.

The desperate radiance Bashan unleashed was like a dim ripple against the Sovereign's Perilous Tread; instead of helping, it seemed to weaken him. The imprisoning power surged once more, locking Nuzi's rescuing Treasured Vase in place. Dazzled by the lights, Bashan finally understood Nuzi's utter helplessness.

'He is the White Qilin, after all...'

Yet Li Zhouwei's golden eyes were bright and sharp, showing no trace of triumph. His attention wasn't even on the man before him.

'Still not going to show yourself?'

BOOM!

A shower of pink light descended. Zhelu, having forced his way through the golden energy, finally arrived, his expression hideous.

'Bashan and Nuzi can be wounded,' he thought grimly, 'but they cannot be sent back to the Buddhist Land after just a few exchanges!'

The Maha of the Liangli rank swept the area with his spiritual sense. Bashan’s brilliant golden body was now dim, covered in cracks, and his massive head was gone. The sunset colors in the sky had just begun to fade as the [Lotus of Three Worldly Retributions] tumbled down and vanished into the Great Void.

"Hm?"

Zhelu was slightly startled.

'That battle-axe... he didn't use it?'

His gaze darted over to King Wei. The battle-axe was already hooked back onto his robes. The king simply stood holding his halberd, frowning as he squinted into the Great Void.

The atmosphere between Li Zhouwei and Zhelu froze. Situ Huo, however, failed to notice. He had been fighting Zhelu for some time, and it was humiliating enough to be suppressed, but to allow Zhelu an opportunity to reinforce his allies was a disgrace. His expression hardened, his pupils turning an autumnal yellow as a powerful golden energy gathered in his hands. Zhelu’s expression turned grave.

Engraved Stone!

Streams of pale gold Metal Malice descended from the heavens, converging upon his long blade. The blade then shot across the sky with immense power, but its advance was met with laughter.

"A fine battle-axe indeed!"

The Great Void shimmered, and a doll-sized porcelain gourd popped out. With a quick spin, it absorbed all the golden energy from the sky. Only then did a white-bearded man in Daoist robes step out of the void. He paid no mind to Situ Huo or Zhelu, his entire focus on a piece of green stone he was juggling in his hands.

The green stone was scalding hot, forcing the Daoist to toss it from hand to hand like a hot potato. An axe-shaped mark on the stone glowed faintly before rapidly fading away.

Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes slightly.

'So you've finally shown yourself...'

For a moment, all was still. Zhelu didn't recognize the newcomer, but he knew this had to be Qi Lanyan's hidden ace. In an instant, every eye on his body glowed with a violet light, all of it directed at Li Zhouwei.

Situ Huo, who was closest to the Daoist, felt a chill run down his spine. He instantly grew wary, taking a step back. He pursed his lips and blew out a puff of golden dust, a vast divine ability that was accompanied by a sky full of autumn dew.

The Daoist ignored him completely, tossing the scorching green stone into his sleeve. Only when the golden energy was upon him did he speak.

"Absorb!"

The porcelain gourd spun once more. Without a moment's pause, it cleanly absorbed all the golden dust in the blink of an eye. Situ Huo stared as if he'd seen a ghost, sheer horror about to spill from his eyes.

'This is bad!'

He, Situ Huo, had cultivated the Metal Virtue for hundreds of years; his Dao-Profundity in this path was anything but weak. If the sky-spanning Metal Malice he had just summoned with his Body Divine Ability hadn't been powerful enough, then this mouthful of [Throne-Toppling Metal Malice] was something he had cultivated for many years. An unprepared cultivator, even one in the Purple Mansion Realm, would suffer greatly from a direct hit.

Having it neutralized wasn't what was frightening. What was frightening was that it hadn't even lasted for a single breath in the air, and his opponent had dealt with it so effortlessly.

For a moment, he was frozen, unsure how to react, as if plunged into an icy abyss. The Daoist, however, ignored him completely, casually stroking his beard as he smiled.

"This humble Daoist came down from my Grotto-Heaven and was just admiring this mountain here. I seem to have interrupted Your Highness's sport—my apologies, my apologies!"
