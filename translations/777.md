# Chapter 777: Xia Shouyu

The Sea's Cape.

The sky was a deep azure. A streak of escape-light shot past, drawing a brilliant red arc across the heavens as it sped toward a region where the spiritual qi was thin. After flying for the better part of a day, the light finally descended upon an island, resolving into the figure of a woman.

She wore a wide, brown Daoist robe, over which an ornate Kesi silk cloak had been rather abruptly hung. On her feet were cotton boots dyed an autumn yellow. The ensemble barely looked like a matched set.

She identified her bearings for a moment before flying toward the island's center. As she flew, she observed the masses of savages covering the land and nodded grimly to herself.

‘After I inspect the situation, I can take this group away. They can be brought back to the temple to cultivate the barren mountains. I only need to leave a few thousand behind as breeding stock...’

She flew to the heart of the island and found exactly what she was looking for: a massive, churning, green-water hot spring. The spiritual qi was surprisingly abundant, and she was instantly delighted.

‘After I collect the item, if this spring eye is still functional, I can certainly put it to good use.’

Her expression turned thoughtful. ‘Then again... according to that demonic cultivator, there is a core of flame beneath it. If I move the primary item, this entire spring will probably vanish.’

At this thought, she sneered.

‘That bastard surnamed Feng certainly had a clever plan. How dare he steal *my* Lishu Fire-Averting Cover? Using the Wuting Talisman Brush as collateral is one thing, but the Cover is still *mine*... Where did he possibly think he could run with it?’

With a light toss, the Lishu Fire-Averting Cover bloomed into a protective red halo. She meticulously probed the hot spring, and only after confirming there were no traps did she dive in.

This woman's cultivation was significantly higher, and her speed was nothing the two minor cultivators from before could compare to. She quickly reached the bottom of the spring and followed the earth meridian downward. After a quarter of an hour, she plunged into the heart of the blazing inferno.

Xia Shouyu's Dao attainment was not shallow. Her face lit up with immediate, joyous surprise.

‘There really is fire beneath the grotto-spring water!’

She cupped a handful of the flame, observing it closely, and her surprise grew. ‘This is *artifice fire*... it is not natural. There truly might be the remains of a cultivator down here! To possess such lingering might after death... he must have reached Foundation Establishment at the very least.’

As the woman moved cautiously forward, the pair of eyes watching from within the flames narrowed in hesitation.

‘Why is it only a ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator...’

Li Ximing had waited here for another half a month. His luck, it seemed, was outstandingly good; a second person had already arrived. After observing her for only a few moments and hearing her muttering, he immediately grasped the situation.

‘The previous killer who stole the treasure was himself killed. And it seems his killer was the item's original owner, the creditor. He must have exposed his tracks in a market square or some other place. The Eastern Sea is just as chaotic as they say... another life snuffed out.’

Li Ximing quickly dismissed the thought, a bitter taste in his mouth. The Sea's Cape simply couldn't compare to the rich lands of Jiangnan, the center of the world. This godforsaken place was an absolute backwater. After all his efforts at luring someone here, he couldn't even attract the shadow of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

This Xia Shouyu was likely a top figure in this specific territory, a true "local snake" given that she could so easily track down her own Dharma artifact.

‘It makes sense... Anyone capable of reaching Foundation Establishment definitely wouldn't waste their time in this forgotten corner. They would head to the coastal seas, perhaps the Hetian Sea, and pledge allegiance to a major power. Why would they stay here and "eat dirt" in a desolate wasteland with thin spiritual qi?’

Ninth-level Qi Refining would have to do. This cursed place wasn't going to offer anyone better. Li Ximing gritted his teeth and accepted it. As he watched her move step by step through the flames, he found himself facing a dilemma.

‘A minor Qi Refining cultivator from the Eastern Sea... she undoubtedly wants nothing to do with the affairs of the Purple Mansion realm. If I reveal a righteous identity, she will never trust me. It seems I truly must adopt the demonic cultivator persona. If I use threats and promises, she will, paradoxically, feel much safer.’

Li Ximing reflected that if *he* encountered some old ghost trapped in the Eastern Sea claiming to be of the righteous path, demanding he fetch a demon beast for a blood sacrifice in exchange for a heavy reward, he wouldn't believe it for a second. He would run as far and as fast as possible!

Furthermore, judging by her mismatched, cobbled-together attire, even if she was a local tyrant, she couldn't have any significant background. She probably didn't even understand the political stances of the major Purple Mansion powers.

‘Besides, to lure a Foundation Establishment demon beast here, you don't necessarily *need* a Foundation Establishment cultivator to do it. There are countless ways to trick a beast to this location. A Qi Refining cultivator isn't guaranteed to fail. Since she’s at the ninth level, she'll even have an easier time finding one.’

While he plotted, Xia Shouyu was already going mad with joy. If the time and place weren't so inappropriate, she would have started dancing on the spot.

‘The legacy of a Foundation Establishment cultivator! That’s Foundation Establishment! If there is just one Foundation Establishment Dharma Artifact in there, my family is set for generations!’

She hurried forward, bracing against the flames while cautiously scanning her surroundings. She sent out several talismans to probe ahead, ensuring everything was safe. Only then did she finally walk up to the withered skeleton and send forth a beam of Dharma light to retrieve the storage pouch lying on the ground.

*Paff!*

The instant her light extended, the surrounding flames swarmed like starving beasts, instantly devouring the beam completely. It vanished into smoke without a trace.

Xia Shouyu hesitated for a second, then had no choice but to bend down, extending her own arm to cautiously pick it up by hand.

*Kacha.*

An extremely faint sound of friction drifted into her ear. Terror seized Xia Shouyu's heart. She tried to yank her hand back like a bolt of lightning, only to find she couldn't pull it free. Her arm was locked in an icy grip, grinding against her bones with agonizing pressure.

A skeletal white arm had risen from the ashes, its five fingers clamped precisely around her wrist.

Every hair on Xia Shouyu's body stood on end. Her Dharma power surged frantically into her trapped arm as the movement technique she had practiced for years erupted. Her free hand simultaneously shot toward the storage pouch at her own waist.

She couldn't move.

Her spiritual qi vanished as if poured into a bottomless black hole. Every motion she attempted failed. Xia Shouyu froze in place, a perfect statue of terror.

Li Ximing forced her down into a sitting position opposite him. Controlling a mere Qi Refining cultivator was utterly effortless. Slowly, flesh materialized over his skeletal face. He certainly wasn't using his true appearance. Instead, he deliberated, trying to choose the visage that looked the *least* like a good person.

As he pondered, a sinister face instantly flooded his memory: long eyebrows, gray eyes, a visage both fierce and venomous, looking perpetually ready to devour someone whole.

Li Yuanjiao.

"Second Uncle..."

Li Ximing froze, just for the briefest of moments.

Memory always strikes so suddenly, arriving like an unreasonable, brute force—a hurricane without origin or warning, smashing violently into his mind. This was Daoist Master Zhaojing. He had been hunted by a late-stage Daoist Master, had nearly lost his life in the Eastern Sea, and had not shed a single tear even when balanced on the edge of oblivion. Yet now, in this fiery pit, his eyes turned red.

Li Ximing had always been terrified of Li Yuanjiao. Strangely, he had cried when Li Yuanjiao fell, but his grief had been nothing compared to his father, Li Yuanping. In the years that followed, he rarely thought of his uncle, save for paying respects on his death anniversary. But now, in this fleeting instant, it was like seeing him again. This sudden vision was like lightning, and with it, he found he was not only unafraid—he missed him terribly.

‘Damn it.’

Li Ximing cursed inwardly. The face flickered rapidly before finally resolving into a complete, terrifying blank. It was a smooth, featureless void. Though it lacked any conventionally fierce expression, this empty visage was more horrifying than any face could ever be.

Opposite him, Xia Shouyu made no sound.

After all, she was completely immobilized; she couldn't have made a sound even if she wanted to. But her eyes were dilated to their absolute limits, as if she would lose consciousness in the very next second.
