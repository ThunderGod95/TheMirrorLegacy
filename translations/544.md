# Chapter 830: In The Demonic Smoke

Li Xuanxuan glanced at Li Ximing, and then at Li Xizhi. He took in the expressions of both brothers, and drew out two jade boxes from his sleeve.

He said, "These are the broken Copper Cache Sword and the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens."

The Copper Cache was Yu Mujian’s dharma artifact. Its quality was decent, but unfortunately, the refinement techniques of Buddhist cultivators couldn’t compare to those of the immortal or demonic Daos. The material was fine, but the ritual refinement was rather crude.

The sword had been severed by the Qingche Sword, but Li Xuanxuan brought it out and placed it in his palm. The yellow-gold cross-section was smooth, but whether The Merciful One had left behind any contingencies was unclear.

But the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens were altogether different. Though far inferior to the Sixfold Quaking Profound Thunder Tokens, their craftsmanship was still top-tier. They were clearly not ordinary items.

Li Qinghong opened the jade box to find six shimmering palm-sized silver-white command tokens. Their engraved scripts lit up, emitting a soft crackling thunder.

Li Qinghong picked one up and weighed it in her hand. A stream of silver lightning surged into her palm, prompting her to exclaim in admiration, "What a marvelous treasure!"

She examined it attentively, gently stroking the engraved script. The remaining five tokens immediately lifted into the air, swirling around her wrist like streaks of light.

Li Qinghong closed her eyes and softly said, "Such a pity... it's 'Profound Thunder.'"

Li Qinghong’s Dao foundation was the Profound Thunderpool, derived from the ‘Winter Thunderclap.’ Though it bore the name Profound Thunder, it belonged to the category of Celestial Thunder and wasn’t a perfect match.

Still, it was a thunder-type dharma artifact. The mismatch merely resulted in minor inefficiencies when channeling mana. After playing with it for a while, Li Qinghong flipped her hand and stowed it away, saying quietly, "This is a top-tier dharma artifact, yet I’ve never used this type of celestial token artifact before. I’ll need to study it thoroughly."

After storing the token, she unfastened the Profound Patterned Bottle at her waist. The dharma artifact glowed with a rich violet hue and was covered in thunder patterns.

The bottle radiated brilliance on the table as Li Qinghong softly said, "This dharma artifact originally belonged to Brother Jiao. It came from within the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven. Its effects vary depending on the wielder’s immortal foundation.

"In Brother Jiao’s hands, it had some unique effects. But in mine, it merely functions as a container, absorbing and storing spirit thunder."

She lifted the bottle and tilted it with one hand, pouring out small bursts of radiant lightning. Each stream of thunder was guided into her palm; some wild, some agile, but each with its own unique character.

Li Qinghong took several small golden bottles from her storage pouch and stored them one by one, seven in total, before handing the treasured bottle to Li Xizhi. "It was always meant to be yours."

"Aunt, how can you say that?!" Li Xizhi examined it briefly. The Profound Patterned Bottle was only three fingers wide in his palm, with delicate carvings and a shimmer of violet light. He lifted his hand and placed it into Li Ximing’s grasp, saying, "Since it came from the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven, it should be in your hands..."

Li Xizhi quickly closed Li Ximing’s fingers around the item in his moment of distraction. He turned anxiously to Li Qinghong, uneasily saying, "Aunt, Xiang’er is still in the North!"

Li Xuanxuan had been sitting at the edge of his seat for some time, wanting to speak. When he saw his grandson finally bring it up, the old man rose and said in a low voice, "Qinghong... about this matter..."

The only one in the Li Family now capable of crossing the river and returning unscathed was Li Qinghong. She nodded gently and replied warmly, "I understand. I’ll return to the North at once."

"Thank you, Aunt!" Li Xizhi responded with deep gratitude. Li Ximing stood beside him, understanding full well, and opened his mouth to speak—only to feel warmth in his palm.

Li Xizhi still had his hand over Li Ximing’s, pressing the Profound Patterned Bottle firmly into his palm. All words of protest stuck in Li Ximing’s throat, and finally he only uttered, "Be careful, Aunt..."

Li Qinghong nodded and replied, "Time is of the essence. Ximing will come with me to the North. Xizhi, recover with Li Quantao and follow us in a few days."

"I’ll head back to Qingdu to prepare!" Li Ximing stood up, and the aunt and nephew soared away on the wind together. Li Xizhi escorted them to the courtyard gate, and then wandered restlessly around the ancestral house before returning to his seat.

Li Xuanxuan was sorting various spirit items, his aged face drooping but otherwise unreadable. He lifted his gaze and, seeing the somber look on Li Xizhi’s face, said hoarsely, "Ximing spent years in seclusion and saw Yuexiang only a few times, how deep could his affection be? Don’t take it to heart. He is a bit cold... but not heartless to such an extent..."

"Grandfather..." Li Xizhi sighed softly, his lips trembling. Only now did the pain show on his face. He replied, "I don’t want Aunt to take risks either... I understand Ximing’s mind, and I know Yuexiang’s chances are slim. But what if there’s still a sliver of hope?"

His remaining words turned to ash in his mouth. He hadn’t known Li Yuexiang had gone north; only later did he learn it had been arranged by the family.

He wasn’t the only one who lacked feeling.

***

Mount Yan Pass.

Demonic smoke rolled thick across the ground, with scattered motes of dim light rising through the gloom. Fragments of collapsed white stone lay all around the darkened ruins. The bloodstains had long since dried, leaving only a few shards of bone strewn across the wreckage.

The ruins were utterly deserted. But a flicker of black light slithered out from a crack in the rocks, transforming into a black serpent that glided silently through the desolation.

Li Wushao's black serpent eyes stayed on the demonic smoke as he slithered forward. It had been months since he had fled from Chengshui Tomb, and this was his first time reappearing at Mount Yan Pass.

The war between North and South had plunged the skies into chaos. Li Wushao had seen Chengshui Tomb flood with Pristine Water and immortal radiance collapse. Thus he had reverted to his true form without hesitation, shrank down, and dove into the underground waters, fleeing southward without a glance back.

As a native Hooked Serpent of the Eastern Sea, Li Wushao was no stranger to survival. Having lived so long in such perilous waters, escape was second nature to him. Once he was within his element, the water, he easily shook off pursuers and fled ever southward.

But Li Wushao hadn't expected Mount Yan Pass to fall. Demonic smoke cloaked the land all along his path, and he'd been attacked three times in his blind flight. He had almost lost his life in those battles.

The only reason I blend in with this demonic smoke is because I was born in the Eastern Sea, am covered head to tail in demonic qi, and never trained in any orthodox sect’s true path or technique. If I were like those other sect mount beasts glowing with righteous light, I’d have been slain long ago!

Just as Li Wushao was slithering over the ruins, a sudden streak of black light fell from the sky and landed before him, transforming into a black-robed man who stared at him in suspicion.

Caught red-handed, Li Wushao did not panic. He lifted his snake head and looked straight at the man, only to hear him speak in a cold tone, "Fellow Daoist, which unit are you from... and why are you loitering here?"

Since Li Wushao was covered in demonic qi and prowling the ruins, the man couldn’t determine his allegiance. Who would guess a defeated straggler from Chengshui Tomb was still wandering the demon-blighted land?

The thick demonic aura on the man clearly gave him away as a northern devil cultivator or rogue, so Li Wushao flicked his tongue and answered, "I am a protector under Master Monk Kongheng of Yan State! And what about you, what unit are you from to be prying this much?"

The snake demon spoke with conviction, but inwardly grumbled, Damn it... using that monk's name again. I’ve practically been his mount these past months! What a disgrace...

The man hesitated. Though most Buddhist cultivator forces were now centered around the Way of Emptiness, Way of Compassion, and Way of Virtue, representatives of all seven northern sects had shown up. Who could say where this Kongheng fit in?

Still, seeing the snake demon so confident, he replied coldly, "I’ve never heard of any Master Monk Kongheng!"

"Blind, are you?!" Li Wushao cursed aloud, slapped the ground with his tail. He pointed directly at him, and roared, "My master is someone even Master Monk Yu Xin of the Great Desire Sect begged in vain for a single debate! And you, a petty devil cultivator, dare bark at someone of such stature?"

Yu Xin had indeed led the initial assault on Mount Yan Pass as a master of the Dao of Great Desire, only to be repelled by Li Qinghong and others. The tale held truth, and with the black serpent holding his head high, his bearing was indeed quite intimidating.

This snake's mouth is vile, thought the devil cultivator.

The devil cultivator was already half-convinced once he heard the name Yu Xin. But being cursed so thoroughly still left him displeased. A trace of doubt lingered in his heart as he said coldly, "If you truly serve such a great master, you must be well-versed in scripture!"

"Hah! You asked for this!" Li Wushao sneered in response and began rapidly reciting the Respected Cultivator's Subduing Words that Kongheng had once taught him. The cryptic and profound incantations echoed through the air. Combined with his earlier claims, it immediately made the devil cultivator in front of him flinch and panic.

“Plagued fool of a snake!” Buddhist cultivators’ scriptures were notoriously strange and unpredictable. The devil cultivator didn’t want to risk getting converted mid-interrogation, so he hurled an insult to save face and quickly took to the wind, vanishing into the black mist.

“Pah!” Li Wushao spat in the direction of his retreating figure and slithered back into the ruins. The man was likely one of the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators stationed here. After that little farce, it seemed he wouldn't be facing any more interference.

Most of the devil cultivators stationed here withdrew after the incident at Chengshui Tomb, and that master monk also returned to the north... otherwise that guy wouldn’t have been so easy to fool...

Li Wushao had also seen the shimmering lights descending from the north. He wasn’t surprised, but muttered inwardly, Humans are so obsessed with appearances. If you want to kill, then just kill, why the need for so many pretenses and disputes? They fight and struggle until they die, all for some hollow display.

Li Wushao had seen plenty of this in the Eastern Sea. Whenever some dragon son from the water palaces needed an Immortal Foundation for alchemy or forging, the local demonic creatures simply lined up to be slaughtered. There was no need for wars or disputes, none of this endless back and forth.

That said, Li Wushao still envied the refinement of inland cultivators. Even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had to feign civility when killing those at Foundation Establishment Realm, and senseless slaughter was rarer. Life was far more comfortable that way.

He lowered his head and moved through the ruins. Before long, he reached the place where he had once been stationed. After digging around for a bit, he unearthed a halberd.

The halberd had a simple design and was remarkably light. Inscribed upon it were the words, Li Family of Qingdu, Chen Family of Lijing, Chen Mufeng.

So the kid died here after all.

Li Wushao had met this man before, back when he was captured and brought to the Li Family. Chen Mufeng had still been a boy then, and they'd crossed paths.

“Damn it...” The snake demon scowled and pried up a few large stones. Sure enough, he found half of Chen Mufeng’s skull. He dug up the other half from the soil. It was already rotted, so the snake demon wiped them clean, pieced them together, and stashed them in his storage pouch.

Humans have a tradition of burying the dead. I’ll bring it back for Chen Donghe to give him a proper burial, thought Li Wushao.

He blinked a few times, searched the area twice, and dragged out a few corpses of Li Family members. Thankfully, he didn’t recognize any of them.

He stowed them all away and cursed, “Damn it, dying right on the spot!”

Now in human form, his eyelid twitched as he scanned the area again. He silently let out a breath of relief when there was no sign of An Zheyan’s corpse. That guy had once worked alongside him mining beneath Moongaze Lake. He had always been smiling under his bald head, with a hearty appetite and a tendency to slack off—though he could run surprisingly fast.

He looked around once more. There had also been a burly man wielding a golden hammer, probably named Li Wen, who was also missing. It was quite likely he had been reduced to ash, with his hammer taken by someone.

As he made his way back, he found a few more corpses along the way and quietly gathered them up, thinking to himself, Those guys from Moon Lake Peak of the devil gate... they probably ran the moment things turned bad, maybe not even fast enough to escape.

He walked barefoot through the field, spotting familiar faces now and then, or what remained of them. Sometimes it was a nose he recognized, or half a rotted ear that looked vaguely familiar, lying discarded on the ground.

Each time Li Wushao saw one, he swore under his breath. His muttering continued as he wandered through the gate, the curses growing quieter, until at last, the old snake fell silent.

In all his years in the Eastern Sea, Li Wushao had never truly had friends. His kin considered his bloodline too lowly to speak to, and the other demon clans didn’t even dare look him in the eye.

It was only after arriving at the Li Family that Li Wushao came to understand the concept of acquaintances and friends. Despite his foul mouth and gruff demeanor, people like An Zheyan and Chen Donghe didn’t mind him. Perhaps there had been some mutual benefit, but they treated him with camaraderie nonetheless.

Li Yuexiang had been just a little girl; she was sweet and well-behaved. Xiao Guiluan’s children were all sharp and clever. Back then, Li Wushao had been assigned to guard her by Li Yuanjiao.

Li Yuexiang had always liked white dresses since she was young. She once told Li Wushao, "I usually stay on the mountain. Uncle Wushao, you don’t have to wait on me all the time. If you come from the lake, I won’t be waiting too long."

In the blink of an eye, more than twenty years had passed. When Li Yuanjiao had died, Li Xuanfeng had asked whether he wanted to stay with the Li Family. Li Wushao hadn’t dared make a peep in front of that man then. But if he were honest with himself, he had grown used to this kind of life, one where he didn’t have to be constantly afraid and could speak his mind.

Now his acquaintances had become corpses, scattered in pieces across the ground. Even in the cold weather, they were rotting badly. For the first time, Li Wushao furrowed his brow over a few mere Qi Cultivation Realm humans.

The old snake wandered all the way to the collapsed formation’s center. His spiritual sense swept the ruins, and after rummaging for a bit, he suddenly caught sight of a broken sword.

The broken sword was just over a foot long. A wooden charm dangled from its hilt, one palm long and two fingers wide, stained in dried black blood. Delicate and graceful words were written on it, I’ve long awaited your return.

Devil winds howled as the old snake glanced at the charm, then at the charred marks on the stone and the dark bloodstains. He stared for two seconds, then turned back to the charm, and let out a raspy hiss—the choked, guttural sound unique to grieving serpents.
