# Chapter 359: Testing the Horse

A group of direct descendants discussed for a while and decided to keep Li Tongya's funeral private, only hanging white silk on the mountain. The few direct descendants paid their respects individually before dispersing.

The news of Li Tongya's passing had already been known to a few direct descendants, who had completed their mourning period three years ago. Now, they merely felt a brief moment of sorrow before quickly returning to their respective duties.

Li Xuanxuan stayed at home for a few days, which was a rare opportunity for him to see Li Yuanping every day. He held Li Ximing with a smile, playing with him as he asked gently, "Ming'er, how much have you read from the alchemy books?"

"I can already summon the Pill Flame!" Li Ximing responded happily as he nodded obediently, bringing his hands together to summon a pure white flame. It was as gentle as jade and as cool as water, quietly dancing between his palms.

Li Yuanping happily took Li Ximing in his arms and looked at the smiling Li Xuanxuan, whispering, "Father, since you rarely return, you should stay home for a bit longer. Let the others in the family handle the market affairs..."

"No." Li Xuanxuan's expression immediately turned serious as he replied, "I am old and have long lost my drive. Second Uncle saw this clearly, which was why he sent me to the market."

His usually stern face showed a hint of remorse as he continued softly, "Your granduncle understood well. I am not truly talented at overseeing the family; at best, I am just a caretaker. I had made many mistakes while overseeing the family over those years..."

He sighed with a hint of guilt in his voice as he continued, saying, "Back then, the family had only a few members, and my father died young. My uncles always felt like they owed me, so they left the family's responsibilities on my shoulders."

With a tinge of regret on his face, he added gently, "Xuanling is actually far more capable than myself. Second Uncle's favoritism toward me kept him in the background. Even though my father died young, he was still beloved by the villagers and respected by many."

"And me... what about me...?" Li Xuanxuan sighed deeply, his voice hoarse, "A hundred years from now, how will people speak of me...?"

It was the first time Li Yuanping saw his father like this, feeling a pang of sadness in his heart. Just as he was about to speak, Li Xuanxuan smiled slightly and continued, "Fortunately, the family is thriving and orderly. You are better than I am, so do your best!"

With a proud smile, he patted Li Ximing's head, then stepped out of the courtyard and flew away.

Li Yuanping chuckled quietly and looked down. Li Yuanjiao entered the hall just in time, seemingly having waited outside to avoid interrupting their conversation. He sat down, and soon, a person came forward, bowing.

"Family Head, the lord of Eastern Mount Yue, Shamoli, has come alone with a horse, saying he has broken through to the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and wishes to ascend the mountain to cultivate, and is no longer seeking status and power."

"Shamoli?"

Li Yuanping raised an eyebrow and looked at Li Yuanjiao, whispering, "I remember Shamoli has a son named Li Jiman, raised in our family... He is part of our Li Family branch. A few years ago, he went to Mount Yue to manage a city."

"Correct." Li Yuanjiao simply responded as he swirled his cup slightly, indicating that he had already considered this matter. Li Yuanping flipped through the documents on his desk and upon finding a small letter, he frowned as he read it.

"The assessment of the Clan Affairs Courtyard is that he is courteous and possesses the demeanor of a gentleman... What does Brother think of this person?"

Li Yuanjiao, who had spent years cultivating in Eastern Mount Yue, was familiar with these matters. He shook his head upon hearing the question.

"Outwardly, he appears respectful, but inside, he is combative and far less compliant than Shamoli. However, the influential families in Eastern Mount Yue are powerful, and using him as a weapon is not a bad idea," he said thoughtfully.

"Oh." Li Yuanping put away the small letter and took a sip of tea.

At this moment, Dou Yi, who had been waiting for an opportunity to speak, finally found his chance. He spoke softly, "Family Head, Shamoli has tamed a demon horse. It is at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, just a notch below the one from Jianixi. It is said to leave no tracks in the snow and moves like a ghost."

"Oh?" Li Yuanping looked up upon hearing this and exchanged a cheerful glance with his brother.

Li Yuanjiao asked warmly, "Is it a good horse?"

"Of course!" Dou Yi replied fawningly.

However, Li Yuanping shook his head and said, "A good horse must be tested. One that is too wild can harm its rider, while one that is too docile cannot travel a thousand li."

Dou Yi nodded while visibly looking confused, and Li Yuanjiao chuckled as he said, "Then I will leave it to you, Brother Ping..."

"Rest assured, Big Brother!"

Li Yuanping read the letter in his hand and nodded firmly, then said in a deep voice, "Let him in!"

The person at the lower end of the hall responded and left. Soon, a man dressed in fine clothes and a jade crown entered, bowing respectfully.

"Shamoli greets Family Head!"

This was none other than Shamoli, the ruler of Mount Yue, now at the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Although he practiced various unrefined qi, his high-grade technique made him comparable to cultivators of pure qi.

Li Yuanping looked at him and spoke warmly, "Since you wish to renounce your position and cultivate on the mountain, will you follow my brother to Mount Wutu?"

"I could not ask for more!" Shamoli readily replied as he kneeled down on one knee.

After the formalities were completed, Li Yuanjiao stood up and said with a smile, "Then I shall return to the mountain first!"

"Alright!" Li Yuanping nodded, watching his brother and Shamoli leave. He then waved to Li Ximing, who had been crouching quietly by the side observing everyone. He then said with a smile, "Go and change into your riding clothes."

Li Ximing's eyes lit up instantly as he asked, "Father, where are we going?"

Li Yuanping removed his cloak and said warmly, "To test the horse!"

————

The climate over Moongaze Lake had always been stable, with extreme droughts and floods being rare occurrences. This year, the rain arrived as expected, falling steadily and marking the end of summer as the evening breeze grew cooler.

Recently, Li Yuanping had been in high spirits. Dressed in riding clothes, he rode his horse at full gallop, his usually pale face now flushed with excitement. His son, Li Ximing, nestled against his chest, giggling continuously.

"Hyah!"

Li Yuanping urged his horse forward, galloping down the road and leaving the convoy of carriages, adorned with black flags, far behind them. Normally found reclining on a soft couch, he now exuded a rare heroic aura, laughing heartily and looking carefree.

The Li Family had grown quite prosperous. The horse under Li Yuanping was a tribute from Mount Yue, named "Zhongsuo". It moved silently like a ghost and possessed the strength of someone at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, having been personally tamed by Shamoli and presented to Mount Lijing.

Thrilled with his new steed, Li Yuanping raced from the outskirts of Lijing Town to the outskirts of Wutu City in Mount Yue, with Li Ximing enjoying every moment. His black hair flew in the wind as he asked, "Father! Where are we?!"

"This is eastern Mount Yue," Li Yuanping replied, his spirits high. He suppressed a cough in his throat, reined in his horse, and pointed his whip toward the northern mountain range.

Smiling, he explained, "Beyond these mountains lies Wutu. Legend has it that Lord Xiangping once led his troops through here, only two li from Mu Jiaoman's army. He held his breath and reined his horse, narrowly escaping disaster."

Li Ximing listened intently. Li Yuanping continued in a gentle voice, "These mountains descend into Wutu City, the border city of Mount Yue. It is quite prosperous, and Li Jiman has been managing affairs here for ten years."

"Li Jiman..." Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then said, "Son of Shamoli, heir to the throne of Mount Yue... Soon to inherit the throne."

"Indeed," Li Yuanping agreed with his son's words. As he glanced around, he saw rain dripping from the leaves and knew that the Jade Court guards and several guest cultivators were closely protecting them. Relaxing, he let the horse follow the road at a leisurely pace.

He rode absent-mindedly, his ears twitching slightly as he spoke with interest, "Li Jiman is a clever man, but he is belligerent and treacherous... outwardly respectful but inwardly deceitful."

The horse snorted and climbed a high slope, revealing a panoramic view of the scenery. Screams and roars echoed through the air, mingled with the sight of blood-stained ground.

On the plain below, the walls of Wutu City were visible in the distance. A group of emaciated Mount Yue villagers, trembling and wielding hoes and pitchforks, had surrounded a gray wolf. The wolf, which appeared to have a low level of cultivation, snarled and roared incessantly.

On a nearby hill, a brown carriage fluttered with flags, and long spears were arranged in a row. A group of soldiers sat idly, laughing and joking with each other. At the top sat a young man who was holding a fruit and laughing heartily.

"That must be Li Jiman!" Li Yuanping remarked casually.

In his arms, Li Ximing frowned and whispered, "Father, what is he doing?"

"Watching a show," Li Yuanping replied coldly. He watched as a blueblood below laughed loudly and threw a fruit, hitting the wolf demon on the head, provoking it. In its anger, the wolf howled and tore a nearby man to shreds in an instant.

The peasant, frail and small, was quickly reduced to a pile of remains, further inciting the wolf's fury. It continued howling madly.

The other nobles and Li Jiman on the hill watched intently and burst into laughter as the body fell apart, guts and blood spilling everywhere. Li Ximing could not bear the sight and turned his head away.

"Watch carefully," Li Yuanping patted his shoulder gently and said, "Remember this scene... It will teach you what the prominent families might do behind your back if the laws are not strictly enforced."

He paused and then continued, "When cultivation stagnates and the future seems bleak, when they tire of their luxuries and possess power and strength far beyond ordinary people, they will always come up with new ways to entertain themselves."

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully. Li Yuanping then sneered and said, "Bring me my bow!"

A Jade Court Guard quickly handed him a longbow. Sitting steadily on the horse, Li Yuanping exhaled, nocked an arrow, and aimed at the people below. He said softly, "Watch closely, my son."

Whoosh—

The arrow shot through the air, its runes glowing with bright white light, descending like a meteor to the ground.

Li Jiman, stretching his arm and holding a fruit, felt indifferent to the scene before him, and seemed to be merely going through the motions. Tian Rong, who was standing beside him, stepped forward and said with a smile, "Jiman, how about this? Quite amusing, is it not?"

"Very amusing!" Li Jiman responded as he glanced at him with hidden disdain, thinking to himself, The Tian Family controls the politics of Eastern Mount Yue... With the old man about to step down, how can I be a puppet like Shamoli? But Tian Zhongqing is cautious. To get leverage on them and negotiate, I must start with Tian Rong...

He seemed to be watching the wolf demon's desperate struggle, but his mind was preoccupied with figuring out how to seize control of Eastern Mount Yue's politics. Just then, a blinding white light descended from the sky.

Boom!

The wolf demon, barely at the first stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, could not withstand the arrow and exploded into pieces, with its blood splattering everywhere. Tian Rong, who had been laughing, looked as though he had been slapped in the face. He jumped up at once and roared,"Insolence! Who dares to disrupt my entertainment!?"

Li Jiman had already risen and looked up. With his peak Embryonic Breathing Realm vision, he instantly recognized the person on the mountain as his mind went blank with fear, his heart pounding in his chest.

"Li Yuanping..."

He fell to his knees with a thud, prostrating himself on the ground, his forehead pressed tightly against the earth. A surge of panic and terror washed over him, his back soaked with sweat instantly, his eyes bloodshot.

The Family Head despises those who oppress and harm commoners... I am finished! Who set me up... Tian Zhongqing... yes, it must be the Tian Family... Tian Zhongqing... Damn it! No wonder he wanted me to come to this remote place for a feast! I'll remember this, Tian Rong!

A wave of unease swept over the gathered Mount Yue lords, and they all kneeled on the ground. Tian Rong stood there in a daze for a few moments. After attempting to pull some of the kneeling people up, he too realized what was happening and kneeled, bewildered.

Halfway up the mountain, Li Yuanping, clad in riding attire, held the delicate Li Ximing in his arms, his expression calm as he quietly observed them.

"Father... They are so afraid of you! Are you going to kill them?"

The boy's clear voice echoed through the mountain, sending chills down the spines of those below. Li Jiman clenched his eyes shut, wishing he could tear Tian Rong and the Tian Family to pieces.

Li Yuanping steadily held the reins, leaning close to his eldest son's ear and whispered, "No. Li Jiman is a smart man, but Tian Zhongqing and the Tian Family are even smarter."

He handed the bow to one of the Jade Court Guards without looking at the people kneeling below with their foreheads touching the ground, and whispered to Li Ximing, "Father will now teach you how a wise man controls a group of wise men."

"All right!" Li Ximing answered expectantly.

Li Yuanping then smiled coldly, tugged the reins, turned the horse around, and Zhongsuo began to walk quietly, its hoofbeats silent, slowly disappearing into the forest they had come from.

The Jade Court Guards on both sides glanced coldly at the people below before following the horse and vanishing as well. After several breaths, Li Jiman finally raised his head and shouted, "Family Head, you have unparalleled insight! I am grateful beyond words!"

Only the whistling wind answered him, and hatred almost overflowed from Li Jiman's eyes.

"The Tian Family... I, Li Jiman, will never coexist with you!"

He stood up, glaring at Tian Rong with hatred and cursed, "You brat, you are good at pretending! Tricking me to watch this show must have taken you a lot of effort! I knew it! I knew it!"

Li Jiman was convinced that Tian Rong had received orders from Tian Zhongqing, intentionally luring him here to be seen by Li Yuanping. He drew his sword with a clang and shouted, "Scoundrel! How dare you deceive me!"

Tian Rong looked utterly confused, unable to grasp what had just happened. Li Jiman's expression changed rapidly, restraining the urge to strike. He kicked Tian Rong in the shoulder, sending him flying over some distance, rolling on the ground with a pained cry.

"Get lost!"

Watching Tian Rong flee in panic, Li Jiman's face darkened. Unlike the other Mount Yue lords, he was of Li Family blood and subjected to the Clan Affairs Courtyard's discipline. Even if Li Yuanping did not punish him, it would not be long before someone came to investigate.

Thinking about the trouble ahead, Li Jiman felt a chill in his heart.

"Damn it!"
