# Chapter 1013: Trouble

Daoist Zhuang’s pupils froze.

He knew who the figure in the sky was. That face—the one that had haunted his meditations a thousand times over, filling him with a terror so deep it shattered his focus—was more familiar to him than to almost anyone else in the Changxiao Gate.

Li Zhouwei.

Years ago, when he and his disciple-brothers had surrounded and tried to kill him on the lake, Zhuang had not only studied that face up close but had wounded him with spell arts, coveted his treasures, and hurled curses at him… Tallying up his sins, he had earned death a hundred times over.

With a soft thud, the old man below the main seat sank to his knees. His gaze remained fixed, unable to look away. Even with the scene unfolding before him, his mind was a chaotic blur.

'What… what is happening…'

From Daoist Zhuang, the man the Changxiao Gate had tasked with guarding this place, down to the members of minor families and their relatives at the banquet, no one had ever imagined such a scene. The thought of the White Qilin appearing before their gates had never crossed their minds; even seeing it now felt impossible.

'The White Qilin? What is he doing here? Visiting a friend? A friend… in the Changxiao Gate? What?'

Their confusion was understandable. The Changxiao Gate had known peace for too long, and the unwritten rule of restraint within Yue State had held for ages. For centuries, conflicts had been fought by proxy overseas; how often did a battle ever reach a sect’s very gates? Even when it did, it was only after all its Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had been annihilated!

What a joke! The Changxiao Gate had a living Great Daoist Master!

Though no one said it aloud, in this era where the Azure Pond was in decline and the Supreme Yang had lost its brilliance, the Changxiao Gate, for all its claims of being the foremost immortal sect, truly had no equal in the current Yue State.

'Then… what is this? If he isn't here to visit a friend…'

The night was silent, the lamplight soft. Wine trickled across a tabletop, reflecting the phantasmal colors in the sky. The sound of each drop was jarringly loud, and in an instant, everyone lowered their heads, their eyes turning to Daoist Zhuang at the head of the hall.

'Then he must be here for revenge.'

Daoist Zhuang’s eyes were vacant. His body went limp, slumping into the main seat like a statue, his neck rigid. His pupils dilated to their limits, all expression vanishing from his face, leaving only despair.

The divine ability in the sky gave them little time to think.

It all happened too fast to react. Daoist Zhuang’s legs were still jelly when the night sky dissolved into an endless expanse of white. It flooded their vision, so blinding they couldn't see their own hands before their faces. There was only white.

With a deafening roar, the formation overhead shattered like an eggshell, annihilated by the white light. The light continued to descend, yet it felt like a gentle breeze, brushing past everyone’s faces without causing the slightest harm.

The entire pavilion beneath their feet shuddered, and all its inscribed patterns went dark. Everyone on the platform broke out in a cold sweat. Whether they wet themselves or cried out in fear, they were all frozen in place, unharmed but bound by the surging radiance, unable to move.

The great formation, lauded as endlessly profound and one of the best among those of the Foundation Establishment Realm, was a complete joke before this divine ability. The Heavenly Light in the sky was like a colossal beast that had merely breathed, and the formation on the ground had been swept away. It had even held back its strength, for fear of crushing the entire marketplace to dust.

Only then did the youth in the sky shift his gaze slightly, his eyes falling upon the Daoist on the ground. It was the look of a god peering down from an immense distance.

The next instant, the searing Heavenly Light surged into Daoist Zhuang’s seven orifices. He didn't last a second. His body, cultivated for years and tempered by Li Fire, suddenly swelled and, without warning, exploded.

A violent boom echoed out.

Blazing Li Fire erupted as his blood ignited into a roaring inferno. The fiery gore splattered outwards, raining down on the terrified guests. A chorus of muffled cries went up as people felt a spreading dampness beneath their robes. They could only tremble where they stood, too afraid to look up.

A massive flying vessel descended from the heavens. Armored soldiers disembarked, rushing into the marketplace and cutting down all who stood in their way. The sound of running feet filled the air, but the cultivators on the pavilion dared not move, held fast by the shimmering white light.

The white light surged upward, pinning them in place. The countless streams of light that had rained down now flowed back into the sky, converging on a single point. Dragon banners and phoenix chariots emerged, and swirling multicolored clouds enveloped the entire Helin Prefecture. The winds churned, revealing the barest glimpse of a colossal structure.

It was a Celestial Gate, covered in profound patterns, so vast it blotted out the sky.

---

The Changxiao Gate.

The mountains were majestic, dotted with countless palaces. White mist billowed and danced, rising from the peaks. Before the highest Profound Palace, two white vases shimmered, spewing forth a dense spiritual energy that cascaded down the steps. But down in the golden palaces of the Changxiao Gate proper, chaos reigned.

Cultivators in flowing white robes with gold trim darted about. Banners of cloud and rainbow whipped erratically in the wind. Elders and Guest Retainers flew between the peaks, their faces masks of terror and rage. Cries echoed everywhere.

"Sect Master!"

The sect master’s ornate robes looked even more distinguished under the multicolored light, but the old man himself was trembling, his face a canvas of fear. He stood frozen on the mountain peak, surrounded by kneeling cultivators who all stared up at him.

"Sect Master!"

The group of cultivators surrounded him, their faces flushed with anger, their voices a clamorous din.

"The Li clan… they're nothing but a family governed by demonic heresies! To think one of them reached the Purple Mansion Realm… and now he dares provoke our glorious righteous path!"

"The audacity! What does he take the Changxiao Gate for? We are the Dao Lineage of a Great Daoist Master! How dare he act so presumptuously!"

"We implore the Sect Master to ask the Daoist Master to emerge from his seclusion and subdue this demonic fiend!"

Rage was etched on every face but one. The white-templed sect master was utterly distraught, his pupils wide and unfocused. His attention wasn't on their words at all; his hands and feet were ice-cold, and he trembled uncontrollably.

'The Li family has brought an army… they can't have come all this way just to destroy a marketplace!'

His gaze was fixed on the dense swarm of light trails in the sky, and a deeply ominous premonition took root in his heart. He could sense the multicolored clouds rising higher. The immense divine ability was being pushed to its absolute limit, visible across the entire plain. Wherever the multicolored clouds spread, cultivator and mortal alike looked up in terror. The eyes of millions were fixed on the sky, filled with nothing but profound unease and dread.

"What is he doing?"

Before the eyes of millions, the Celestial Gate plummeted downward. Wreathed in roaring purple flames and Heavenly Light, it smashed into the magnificent, palace-studded mountain of the Changxiao Gate!

As the divine ability descended, an overwhelming suppressive force washed over them. The timid cultivators who had been watching from the periphery instantly lost control of their light trails and tumbled from the sky like a meteor shower, their white light falling like rain.

The entire Changxiao Gate was enveloped in multicolored light. A brilliant silver radiance flared across the sky as the sect’s protective formation activated on its own!

Celestial Harmony Grand Spirit Formation!

Profound patterns materialized from the Great Void, weaving together to form the array that enveloped the mountain. But before its light could reach its peak brightness, the Celestial Gate slammed into it.

A deafening clang reverberated through the entire mountain range. Disciples were thrown off balance, tumbling down the slopes. Panic finally set in, and they flew about like headless flies amidst the endless clamor as a blinding white light spread across the great formation…

The white-templed sect master collapsed to the ground, his heart frozen. The angry shouts around him died instantly, replaced by whispers of disbelief.

"He… he means to destroy the Changxiao Gate! How is this possible…"

"Where is the Great Daoist Master?!"

The white-templed one’s mind went blank. As sect master, he knew the Great Daoist Master of Changxiao’s true disposition, which only deepened his terror.

'Forget the Great Daoist Master, I don't even know where the other Daoist Masters are… And even if they were here… could they possibly win against the combined might of the White Qilin and Zhaojing?!'

Another thunderous impact. The forests swayed and the mountains trembled. Spiritual energy churned violently. The white-templed one slowly climbed back to his feet. He glanced around and saw fear on the faces of the surrounding cultivators.

Looking out from the sect gates, the sky was nothing but a blinding white light. Within that light stood the towering Celestial Gate, from which descended an endless torrent of purple flames, burning everything to ash.

There was nothing else.

"Daoist Master… Daoist Master…" The white-templed one stared at the light outside the formation, his face slick with cold sweat. He fumbled inside his sleeve but couldn't seem to find anything.

He had already crushed the jade talisman Cheng Yan had given him. He had to know! Even if he didn't, how could a Daoist Master not notice such a world-shaking commotion?

The white-templed one stood rooted to the spot, staring blankly at the horizon. Suddenly, the clamor around him ceased. At the same moment, the old man’s eyes widened in shock.

Within the boundless white light, the lone Celestial Gate had changed. A young man now stood beneath it, a halberd in his hand, his gaze fixed coldly upon them.

He had long brows and cold eyes, and his aura was utterly transformed. The long hair he once tied up now flowed freely, stirred by the churning divine ability that swirled around him. The towering, radiant Celestial Gate at his back framed him like a Monarch.

In the past, with his gaze lowered, he had been steady, calm, and impassive. Now, with his head raised, he was entirely different—ferocious and menacing, his eyes gleaming with a golden light so demonic it seemed ready to devour someone whole.

Those golden eyes seemed to pierce through the great formation’s veil, gazing down upon everything without hindrance. This terrifyingly direct and palpable connection—as if he were staring face-to-face with a Purple Mansion Realm expert—made the white-templed one's heart skip a beat. A surge of heat rose in his chest, and he nearly vomited blood in panic.

It wasn't just the sect master. The moment the White Qilin of the mortal world appeared in the sky, all curses and shouts on the mountain fell silent. The man’s presence seemed to drain the courage from everyone, replacing it with a rising panic. No matter which corner of the sect they hid in, every cultivator felt the same strange mix of terror and intimacy.

'It feels… it feels like he’s looking right at me…'

They stared at the sky, mesmerized and unable to resist.

A soft thud broke the whisper of the mountain wind as someone fell to their knees. The sound was like a spark landing in dry tinder, setting off a chain reaction. One after another, the sounds of kneeling echoed across the peaks. More and more disciples fell, prostrating themselves in terror. Those with higher cultivation levels fared better, but the weaker ones were already kowtowing. A strange atmosphere began to spread.

The white-templed sect master forced his eyes shut, feeling the defenses in his mind on the verge of collapse.

'Impossible… The formation even isolates us from the Great Void! How can his divine ability penetrate a Purple Mansion Realm-grade formation… How can it affect them through the formation…'

He had personally experienced the White Qilin's power back then, but the pressure he felt now was on an entirely different level.

'Daoist Master… where are you?!'

Under that gaze, every second felt like a year. As his hands and feet trembled, a brilliant brown light finally shone forth, blanketing the mountain gate and revealing endless profound radiances.

A man in brown robes appeared, standing silently on the solitary peak. His expression was grim and unsettled as he stared at the Heavenly Light outside, clearly agitated.

It was Daoist Master Cheng Yan!

In contrast, the white-templed one let out a breath he didn't realize he was holding. He collapsed to his knees and cried out.

"Daoist Master!"

Whatever Cheng Yan was thinking at that moment, his appearance meant a glimmer of hope for the sect master. His greatest fear was that the Daoist Master wasn't in the sect at all, that some deal had been struck to sell them out. That would have truly left him with no path to heaven and no gate to the earth!

His cry was filled with immense relief, but Cheng Yan had no time for him. Forget the disciples and elders—even Cheng Yan himself was filled with shock and suspicion!

'What… the hell?'

'For no reason at all… to show such killing intent… Are the other sects just going to ignore this? Changxiao told me my Dao was brilliant, that all I had to do was wait for the Yang family to recruit me… That Lord Yang was perfectly courteous. What is this Li family thinking, going mad like this?!'

He was both furious and bewildered, but the Li family had real power. Without Changxiao's help, he figured he would struggle just to fight Li Zhouwei, let alone with Li Ximing added to the mix… Most importantly, for the Li family to attack with such confidence, they must have some kind of ace up their sleeve!

The Daoist Master scanned his surroundings, his face as dark as the bottom of a pot. With a heavy flick of his sleeve, a wave of Wu Earth radiance erupted across the mountain, knocking over the elders and disciples who had been standing there.

The strange atmosphere on the mountain instantly eased, but no one dared to speak. They silently picked themselves up. Cheng Yan, meanwhile, extended his senses and felt his heart sink.

'The Audience with the Celestial Gate is right outside… that suppressive divine ability has always been disgusting. There's no way to slip away unnoticed…'

His expression grew uglier as the great formation beneath his feet continued to shudder. Cheng Yan looked up and saw the man beneath the Celestial Gate raise his eyes slightly and speak.

"Cheng Yan."

The voice was calm, yet it resonated with the divine ability, carrying through the formation. Daoist Master Cheng Yan's expression shifted, and for a moment, he dared not meet the gaze, slowly looking away.

But those words snapped the last taut nerve in the white-templed one’s mind. The old man staggered back as if stricken, collapsing to the ground. His lips trembled as he shrieked in horror.

"He can see us! He can see us!"

His shrill cry echoed through the mountains, sowing panic. The low-level cultivators who had just managed to get back on their feet were cut down like a field of wheat, bending over and collapsing. The weak-willed among them even began to kowtow again.

In truth, Daoist Master Cheng Yan knew better than anyone in the sect just how terrifying the man in the sky, wreathed in Bright Yang, truly was. This was the figure that even Shilou Yingge couldn't capture! The sect master’s scream sent a chill down his spine.

He forced himself to remain calm and looked up. Through the radiance, he saw the long halberd rise, pointing at the mountains below. Its tip was sharp and dazzling. The young man issued his command.

"Come out of the formation and accept your execution. I will spare your disciples."

Cheng Yan never expected such a blunt ultimatum. It was a complete loss of face. Though a knot of fear tightened in his stomach, his expression remained as placid as an ancient well, his eyes cold and severe. Before he could speak, he saw Li Zhouwei's palm begin to glow even brighter. A sliver of silver-white brilliance leaped from it.

This sliver of light was incredibly dense, sometimes scattering, sometimes coalescing. It darted about his palm like a playful carp, yet its movements stirred up dazzling arcs of lightning that pulsed with a destructive aura.

Understanding finally dawned on Cheng Yan, and his face went deathly pale. With his Purple Mansion Realm vision, he could clearly see what that silver light was.

It looked like a single sliver, but it was actually a dense swarm of thousands upon thousands of sesame-seed-sized silver-white sparks of lightning. The number was impossible to estimate, and each tiny spark that manifested was in truth a silver-white, sword-shaped wedge of lightning!

The young man’s voice, thoughtful and even tinged with a faint smile, echoed from all directions and entered his ears:

"As for breaking the formation to kill you… Minghuang doesn't mind the trouble. The only trouble is that you, fellow Daoist, will perish and turn to soil."

"When that happens, the Wu Earth will fall upon your mountain gate. The casualties will be countless, and it would be a shame to defile your spirit veins."
