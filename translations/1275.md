# Chapter 1275: The Settled Relocation

"Greetings, King Wei!"

Yang Ruiyi, though now a Great Daoist Master, treated Li Zhouwei with even greater gravity. He descended from the void and clasped his fist in salute, his manner familiar yet respectful as he said with a smile,

"You and I laid our plans in Ting Province, and in merely a few days, you, King Wei, have shattered Luoxia and slain Gongsun Bei at Boye. You made the heavens below Luoxia fall like a rain of stars, with endless purple fire and boundless clouds of dust..."

He paused, then added in admiration.

"The Xiang lands were easily overcome, yet they are besieged on all four sides. Should disaster strike, any invader would be hard-pressed to hold the territory... Kui Zhao's assault on Ru failed, the Yu Clan was unsuccessful, the King of Liang pacified Xiang only to lay a long siege to Mount Liangchuan, and Shi Qi's invasion of Luoxia was thrice defeated at Han Pass. None can compare to you, King Wei."

Yang Ruiyi's eyes crinkled with a smile, his admiration profound.

Just as Yang Ruiyi had said, the lands below Luoxia were not difficult to invade; the challenge lay in swallowing such a precious, fertile territory in a single gulp. He had assumed either Boye or Mount Liangchuan would be lost, but never imagined both would fall into their grasp!

'This will surely be another mark of merit to my name.'

Faced with such praise, Li Zhouwei simply smiled and shook his head, replying casually.

"Kui Zhao was rash, and their expeditionary force was crushed. The King of Liang was a placeholder, and the Xia people were ashamed of the barbarians. Shi Qi entered Xiang while still fearing the old emperor. It was all merely a matter of a changing situation. The lands below Luoxia are now but scattered sand; sending a few clay chickens and pottery dogs to their aid was enough to ensure their collapse."

He was being modest, which caused Yu Xi and the newly arrived Yang Xuancai to flush with shame.

'Clay chickens and pottery dogs... At least he isn't scolding us!'

Scattered sand was a kinder term than clay chickens and pottery dogs, but on reflection, the role they, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, had played in this great war was hardly any better. They had all been preoccupied with self-preservation, scrambling over one another to pledge their allegiance.

Yang Ruiyi laughed heartily and, with a welcoming gesture, said,

"Let us proceed to Xiangxiang to speak in detail."

After all, Yinling was still the territory of the Tao clan, and the Yang family maintained a respectful attitude. For now, they prepared to establish their seat of governance in Xiangxiang. The group traveled west, and soon they saw a sky filled with purple fire, where an old man and a young man were already waiting in the Great Void to receive them.

Jia Zan had managed to save his clan's younger generation, and he showed no sign of dejection even though his mystic realm had fallen. His face was wreathed in smiles, but he hesitated to speak. Li Jiangqian stood at the forefront and performed a salute as he listened to Yang Ruiyi's praise.

"Congratulations, Changli!"

Li Jiangqian returned the courtesy with thanks. With his father presiding, he maintained a composed demeanor, quietly leading the assembly into the great hall.

Once they had all taken their seats, leaving the seat of honor vacant, the King of Wei and the Grand General sat to the left and right respectively. Only then did the others take their seats according to their level of cultivation, listening as Li Zhouwei began.

"Since the Grand General has come from the west, what are the arrangements for the eastern front?"

Yang Ruiyi appeared perfectly at ease and smiled.

"The far east is difficult to press. We have the Yue Cultivating Sect, the Gao family, and the Lotus Temple... We've occupied Duanchen, creating a line all the way to Changhe. As long as there is no turmoil in Changhe and our flank is secure against the Yue Cultivating Sect, we need not worry about the White River..."

"As for the central region... we pushed eastward and seized a great deal of the Lotus Temple's territory. We've established a position at Huai Province and demarcated our borders with them. Further west, at Bòshān on the lower reaches of the Ru River, we have invited people from the Sword Gate to garrison the area."

He spoke reservedly, but it was likely he had also invited that renowned Sword Immortal; how else could he have extricated himself so easily?

'As long as Lingmei takes action, there is no need to worry about the entire eastern front.'

The power of a Sword Immortal was beyond question, to say nothing of a Great Daoist Master with four divine abilities and a Dui Metal Sword Immortal at that!

Still fearing Li Zhouwei might feel the situation was unstable, Yang Ruiyi stated solemnly

"His Majesty has already moved the capital to Jingchuan."

These few simple words instantly caused the silent Xuanwei's expression to change dramatically. His brows shot up, his pupils filled with utter shock!

Yang Ruiyi, as the embodiment of the will of the Great Song and the Yang family, had arrived by carriage. From beginning to end, his gaze had remained fixed on Li Zhouwei, not sparing a single glance for the surrendered officials. Xuanwei had remained impassive until now, but at these words, he was frozen to the spot.

The Great Song was moving its capital!

He stood in the great hall, overcome with emotion, sighing silently in his heart. The next to react was Yu Xi!

The old man was stunned for a moment, then a flash of ecstasy ignited in his eyes.

'Moving the capital to Jingchuan? Since the national capital will border Jianghuai, the benefits for us in going to Sanjiang will be countless!'

Li Zhouwei merely nodded. He produced a golden scroll from his sleeve, held it quietly, and said:

"This King wishes to invite the Grand General to jointly submit a memorial for consideration, to request the True Yang Emperor's decree for the disposition of the Xiang lands."

As he spoke, all eyes turned to them. Yang Ruiyi nodded.

"King Wei, please speak."

Li Zhouwei rose to his feet and said softly:

"First, we will relocate the populations of the Louxia to populate the lands between the Huai."

These words, though spoken calmly, carried immense weight. Even though the assembled cultivators had anticipated this, they could not help but sigh inwardly.

The lands below Luoxia were prosperous. Setting aside the great families, the populace alone numbered over ten million. It was only because of the presence of so many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and the vast divine abilities of the Great Song that such a relocation could even be contemplated!

'After a millennium of toiling in the lands of Luoxia, we must finally leave our homes...'

Of course, for these tens of millions of people, the benefits ultimately outweighed the drawbacks. Great wars were certain to erupt in the lands below Louxia in the future, conflicts that would likely not be the small, gentle skirmishes of today. Should a situation arise that a few Purple Mansion Realm masters had not foreseen, millions of corpses would surely litter the ground!

'It is better to relocate them completely. The wars between the Huai have just ceased, leaving thousands of miles of uninhabited land. This can be considered boundless fertile fields.'

Yang Ruiyi nodded with a smile, while Li Zhouwei glanced around and continued:

"Second, with the submission of the Xiang lands and the compliance of all the Louxia region, this King will petition the True Yang to bestow boons upon the houses of Louxia. Each will be granted land between the Huai, and their most talented scions will be chosen to enter the Purple and Gold Palace!"

This point also posed no major problems. Yang Ruiyi finally turned to the Purple Mansion Realm masters and said with a smile.

"The region below Louxia is not only vast in territory but also home to tens of millions of people and the great families of Louxia. If Martial Cultivation were to acquire it, it would warrant at least four positions in the Purple and Gold Palace!"

This number surprised Li Zhouwei. He had originally expected only three: one for the Tao clan, one for the Yu clan, and perhaps one for the Jia clan or another family. He paused for a moment before continuing,

"Third, the Jia and Yu families have rendered great service. This King will petition Martial Cultivation to grant them fiefdoms, perhaps even a kingdom between the Huai, to complete their Profound Foundation and allow them to forge in the Great Void."

As soon as he said this, absolute silence fell upon the Great Void. Yu Xi shot his head up, his eyes wide with shock as the King of Wei's words echoed in his mind:

'Such a place might not be impossible to have again!'

This was not a token gesture to soothe resentment, nor a casual remark to acknowledge their earnest hopes. This was a promise that could be realized in the blink of an eye!

The Yu family had suffered for a thousand years, their singular misery being a mystic realm that was not their own. Yu Xi had agonized for a century, his only regret being his lack of autonomy. Now, just as that dream had been shattered like a clod of earth, a memorial was to be submitted to truly establish a mystic realm for his family!

Even if this mystic realm no longer possessed the many spiritual resource sites of the past, once obtained, it would be a legitimate realm, enfeoffed by Martial Cultivation. There would be no need to fear unauthorized entry. More importantly, this realm was a gift from the Song court. It might even be possible, upon the Song Emperor's attainment of the Dao, for it to link to a grotto-heaven, connect with True Qi, and become the very foundation of their existence!

The significance of this was entirely different! In Yu Xi's view, this could very well allow the Yu clan to ascend to a grotto-heaven, and even to form a connection with the Yang family, which was poised to rise meteorically and see its influence in the Underworld burgeon.

Yu Xi had already lived for four hundred years, yet at this moment he was shaken with utter shock and delight. He stood there, stunned and speechless, a thousand thoughts racing through his mind.

If he reacted this way, what then of Jia Zan?

The old Daoist Master had never imagined a mystic realm would have anything to do with his family. He had secretly thought that if there were any compensation, it would go to the Wei clan. Hearing this, he felt a jolt run through him, and a flush of heat rose in his cheeks.

'Can this be true... this...'

Although Jia Zan had surrendered faster than anyone, he had rushed about, causing the destruction of the Wei clan's mystic realm, a clan that had been like family. Deep down, he had felt a secret guilt. Had his desperate pleas for the divine abilities of the Wei clan's junior not been born of this remorse?

In that instant, his feelings were transformed:

'Surrendering was the right choice!'

'My, Jia Zan's, decisiveness and foresight shall be recorded in the annals of history and spoken of for a thousand years!'

Then, all eyes shifted to the other side of the hall, where Yang Ruiyi had fallen silent, his expression peculiar.

Li Zhouwei watched him with a smile, unconcerned.

With the founding of the Great Song, what sort of spiritual aura had been born?

The Era of Conquest, Peace and Martial Glory—also known as the Vast Profound Suspended Void!
This spiritual aura's two energies, coordinating with yin and yang, caused stars to appear in daylight and allowed grotto-heavens to ascend. It was perfectly suited for elevating mystic realms, making the process in the south far less difficult than in the north, where one needed to find an anchor. As long as a family was willing to exert some effort, they could elevate a mystic realm.

The mystic realms of the Yu and Jia families had previously fallen, bringing down with them many of the spiritual items used in their initial establishment. The families themselves were exceedingly wealthy, and with the aid of the spiritual aura in the south, re-establishing a mystic realm was far simpler than starting from scratch. All that was needed was to supplement their resources and spiritual items and expend some effort and divine ability... The only things lacking were the method for forging a Great Void and the years of calculations from a cultivator skilled in this Dao.

Coincidentally, neither of these two things posed much difficulty for the Li clan, let alone the Yang family. The resources Yang Ruiyi could command were by no means scarce!

And Li Zhouwei had his own reasons to be confident that the Great Song and the Yang family would be willing to make such an effort!

'The matter of spiritual auras is a manifestation of the world's grand trends. A spiritual aura empowers cultivators, and cultivators, in turn, reinforce the spiritual aura. They mutually promote each other. The Vast Profound Suspended Void makes it easier to elevate mystic realms, and in turn, cultivators elevating mystic realms will nourish the Vast Profound Suspended Void!'

The duration of a spiritual aura was often tied to such major events. The Upper Evil Spirit Storage of the past had been shattered by the spiritual flux created when Daoist Master Zipei of the Purple Smoke Gate fell during her breakthrough. 

And the Vast Profound Suspended Void was inextricably linked to the Song Emperor!

'From this, it is clear that Martial Cultivation's path to immortality lies in the Quest for Gold and seeking the Dao, in the light of the Martial Cultivation Star, in vanquishing demons, and also in forging the Great Void!'

The establishment of mystic realms in Jiangnan and the rise of the great families would in itself enhance the prestige of the Song Emperor!

'Furthermore, these families must now rely on the Song Emperor's grace to achieve their ascension!'

Li Zhouwei had long considered this, and he secretly understood that the Song court must have similar plans. Yet, looking across the great families of the Great Song, the situation was rather awkward.

'The Lingu clan advanced mostly through sheer luck. The Sima Family's divine abilities are incomplete. The Xiukui Dao's wounds have not yet healed. The Azure Pond Sect is an empty shell. The Chen Clan has strength, but their foundation is too shallow, and they cannot be rewarded without merit. As for the new nobility between the Huai, Changyun's conduct is bizarre, Yehui has no sect and no heirs, and the Situ clan harbors ill intentions—they've vanished without a trace, and must be plotting something...'

The only ones with the qualifications to elevate a mystic realm were the Purple Smoke Gate, the Sword Gate, and the Li clan!

Under his smiling gaze, the Grand General of the Yang family smiled in understanding. He shook his head, his tone a mixture of emotion and admiration as he said,

"I will naturally submit a memorial together with King Wei!"

Instantly, the various cultivators stepped forward. Some were joyous, others envious, but all offered their thanks in unison. Li Zhouwei remained silent, while Yang Ruiyi smiled and waved his hand, his gaze sweeping over them, growing more satisfied by the moment.

'The fighting strength of the lands below Louxia has been preserved to the greatest possible extent; holding it is now a possibility. And with the mystic realms fallen, the various Buddhists have lost their greed, which is a great help.'

Unlike Li Zhouwei, who had come with a clear objective, it was only now that the Grand General truly felt the resolve to defend this place. He felt he had won a great victory, and his heart swelled with pride.

When the clamor subsided, the King of Wei asked:

"Who does the Grand General intend to leave in defense of Xiang?"

The lands below Louxia were anciently known as Boye, and together with a stretch of land to the east, belonged to the Xiang region. Yang Ruiyi, with his deep heritage, was accustomed to the name "Xiang" and found it more familiar. He simply said,

"When King Wei returns with your army, which masters will you be taking with you?"

Although Li Zhouwei had conquered the lands below Louxia, they were ultimately to be handed over to the Great Song. The two began the transfer of authority with a tacit understanding. Li Zhouwei's eyes swept the hall.

"My old wounds have not yet healed. I emerged from seclusion in haste and, though I slew Gongsun Bei in battle, it has aggravated some lingering ailments. I fear I cannot delay any longer. I request that you deploy Daoist Master Cheng Qian to help defend the great desert. Changli and Suyun will return with my forces to the lake to recuperate before defending the lands below Louxia once more."

That he would take Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan was no surprise to Yang Ruiyi. The Li family's geographical position was a natural buffer for the Great Song. The Western Shu might make a move, so their return to guard the west was opportune. He simply smiled and said:

"I think... perhaps we should invite Daoist Master Zhaojing to make a trip."

Li Zhouwei shook his head.

"My grand-uncle is nearing the completion of his pill refinement and cannot leave for some time... After a year or so of probing attacks has passed, the Grand General may no longer need him."

Yang Ruiyi stroked his beard and had no choice but to concede.

"In that case... I find Daoist Friend Liu's divine abilities to be rather unique. I would like to borrow him from you, King Wei..."

Li Zhouwei then said,

"He is not skilled in combat. I must ask General Yang to look after him."

"Naturally!"

Yang Ruiyi agreed. The atmosphere in the hall was excellent, and Li Zhouwei was in high spirits as well.

'The gains from this campaign... are the greatest in many years!'

After all, he had shattered the mystic realms of several Purple Mansion Realm families. It was doubtful that any future campaign in the north could yield a comparable harvest. Li Zhouwei rose to his feet and strode to the front of the hall like a gust of wind. He turned slightly and said with a smile:

"Grand General, relocating the people of Louxia is not a task for a single day. Should we lose these lands, the people will be plunged into misery, and that will be a karmic crime upon us both!"

Though he was smiling, his words carried an intense authority that made the hall fall silent. Yang Ruiyi rose solemnly and declared,

"The Yang family will ensure that the lands below Louxia are safe."

Several of the Daoist Masters from Louxia exchanged glances, visibly relaxing. Li Zhouwei, meanwhile, smiled and stepped into the Great Void, his eyes sharp and bright amidst a chorus of respectful farewells.

'This arrangement should be enough to secure the lands below Louxia for several years.'

From the easy capture of Mount Liangchuan to accepting the surrender of the Louxia region, from striking down the mystic realms to turning the land into a blank slate, and finally, to using the righteous cause of the civilian relocation to compel the Great Song's full commitment—Li Zhouwei had exhausted his mind and energy, meticulously planning every step to ensure the Yang family could hold the lands of Louxia while he was in seclusion...

'The resources are in hand. I have done all that is humanly possible. The rest depends on the flow of the grand tide.'

He trod upon the Heavenly Light, crossing the Great Void step by step. Behind him, the crimson-robed youth was lost in thought, a look of deep understanding in his eyes.

'Brilliant... This way, the surrendered generals are all rewarded, ensuring their allegiance was not in vain. My Dao-Profundity is lacking; I had not considered the Vast Profound Suspended Void...'

Just as in his conversation with Li Ximing, Li Jiangqian was confident his father could find a way to "uphold both virtue and reputation," winning the hearts of the people even while pacifying the lands of Louxia. He followed quietly, absorbing the lesson.

Only after crossing the great lake did he dispel his divine ability and say with a smile.

"Father, Grand-uncle's Dao of alchemy is astounding. The Grand General sending him away likely betrays a desire to control him, and I can't help but feel it's a shame... For someone with such mastery of the Dao of alchemy to have only taken a single nominal disciple, Nantanchen, who learned but a fraction of his art, is truly a pity."

A corner of Li Zhouwei's mouth lifted.

"And your point is?"

Li Jiangqian chuckled.

"I've heard there is a genius of the Dao of alchemy in Boye named Qiao Yue. He is a Molten Fire cultivator, possessed of both virtue and talent. Daoist Master Cui holds him in high regard and wishes to introduce him to Grand-uncle—he is, after all, a seed for the Purple Mansion Realm, someone who could truly inherit the legacy!"

Li Que'wan appeared thoughtful, her beautiful eyes darting about, while Li Zhouwei laughed in spite of himself.

"You may arrange it as you see fit."

Li Jiangqian smiled to himself and said,

"Then I shall have to test him."

He began to scheme.

'The Yu clan has benefited the most; it would not be an overstatement to call it a great kindness. There is no need for further concern there. The Jia and Wei are intertwined; Jia Zan received a great boon, so his mouth is sealed. If the Wei clan rises in the future, harmony will prevail. If not, looking back on today, with the Wei fallen and the Jia ascendant, who is to say the Jia clan didn't sell them out for their own glory? The resentment will naturally be directed inward among them.'

'That only leaves the Qiao clan of Boye. We brought down their mystic realm, but because they have no Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, they received few benefits... They are isolated and helpless in their southern migration. Let them struggle for a time, then offer them the status of master and disciple. They will have no choice but to rely on us. Then we can arrange a marriage alliance or two, and even hold their Spiritual Artifacts for safekeeping. If one of them reaches the Purple Mansion Realm, we can return everything...'

The Li family was long past its former days; they had no shortage of Purple Mansion Realm Spiritual Artifacts. For such items, quality was far more important than quantity. Using mediocre artifacts was clumsy and inefficient, far inferior to wielding a single Spiritual Treasure. They had no greed for the few items that family possessed.

Li Jiangqian was secretly making his calculations as they quickly reached the mountain's peak. He saw vibrant clouds drifting across a bright sun, with crimson flames roiling in the sky. An old man in red robes hurried out to greet them. He stared at Li Zhouwei in awe and said respectfully:

"Greetings, King Wei!"

...

The Zhao Court.

Crows cawed mournfully. A customary chill pervaded the Zhao palace, cold and desolate. The colors in the great hall were muted, and the seven Profound Pavilions of the Buddhist cultivators sat silent in the darkness, appearing dim and lifeless.

'Gongsun Bei... it's Gongsun Bei...'

'He killed Gongsun Bei!'

A dense flurry of whispers, some light, some heavy, filled the air with restless anxiety. The emperor on the high throne watched coldly as he heard the rustle of a crystal curtain to the side, where a female Daoist Master had taken her seat.

Zong Chang.

This Veiled Yin Daoist Master had been at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm for many years. A recent failed breakthrough had left her complexion somewhat pale. Her eyes were downcast, her gaze sweeping almost imperceptibly over the steps.

She had always been caustic, her words often laced with sarcasm. When Gongsun Bei had departed, she had pricked him with a cool, measured barb. Now, with the news of his death, there was no smile on her face, only a long silence before she finally curled her lip.

"Useless."

Yet, a subtle complexity flickered in Zong Chang's eyes.

In truth, Gongsun Bei had understood, as did she, that as the Bright Yang grew stronger by the day, their lives were like meat simmering in a cauldron. Once the water evaporated, they would first be scorched until they coughed up blood, and then their lives would be forfeit.

Faced with the ever-approaching crisis of death, Gongsun Bei had ultimately chosen to test his edge against the tide. She had considered the possibility of his utter defeat, of his fall after grievous injury, but she had never imagined he would perish on the spot between two sixth-generation Mahas.

"So quickly."

Perhaps her turn, Zong Chang's turn, would be next.

Truth be told, she, Zong Chang, at least had the option of seeking refuge with the Buddhists, which could have been considered a line of retreat. But now she felt even more listless—was it truly a retreat? Even Vast Cicada with the Golden Land was dead. Between surrendering to the Buddhists and clinging to the demonic path, who could say which led to a quicker death?

By cultivating the demonic path, she could at least maintain her autonomy for now. Even if it meant merely waiting for death, drinking poison to quench her thirst, Zong Chang continued to wait, quietly, watching as a monk with a face like frost entered from outside the hall.

Jiang Toushou.

The monk's face was as foul as ever, but there was a subtle shift in his expression, his heart a tangled mess.

'Excellent... So decisive, so utterly without scruple. He's brought down every last mystic realm and swept them clean... severing my last avenue of command!'

Making his way to the head of the hall, he finally saw a figure on the lotus throne of the Way of Joyful Bliss, chattering away with those on either side:

"Alas! The mystic realms are all lost! They've taken everything, even the people are being moved away day by day! What's the point of the lands below Louxia now? Let it go... just let it go..."

"You want to die? Well, I don't!"

Several others nodded in firm agreement.

"Mingmeng."

While he had been outside, deep in thought, the Mahas behind his back had been whispering amongst themselves, undermining him at every turn. The glare Jiang Toushou shot them was filled with a rage like a Merging Fire burning in his belly.

Mingmeng, however, was now on solid ground and spoke without courtesy, sneering:

"Lord Jiang, after your great defeat at Zanmen, there's no need to vent your anger on me! My eldest disciple-brother had been in seclusion for a long time, yet you summoned him with an unsubstantiated order, and he still obeyed you, traveling all the way to Ruzhou... To think that instead of an apology from Lord Jiang, we should receive a scolding."

He said coldly:

"We await an explanation from Lord Jiang—for me, for my master, and for the Lotus Temple!"

Somehow, in a daze, he felt as if he were back at Zanmen, standing in Gongsun Bei's place. Gazing out at the chaotic scene, the anger in his heart drained away like water, leaving only an empty frustration.

'This is truly not a job for a human being!'

He, Jiang Toushou, had advanced on the path of cultivation at a divine speed, climbing to his position in less than three hundred years, an exceptionally rapid ascent among the Buddhist cultivators. He had set out in high spirits to contain the Seven Aspects, but now he was truly powerless. He silently took his seat, not even bothering to rebuke Mingmeng.

After a long while, a Maha from the station of the Way of Compassion finally spoke:

"Lord Jiang, news from the east. The Exiled Qi has vanished. Zanmen must be defended, ready to provide support at any moment..."

'The Exiled Qi has vanished?'

At these words, the assembled Buddhists exchanged shocked glances, their hearts pounding.

'Yang Ruiyi has come to the lands below Louxia!'

Hearing this, Jiang Toushou felt an even greater emptiness. Yang Ruiyi was now a Great Daoist Master, wielding the earth-shattering treasures of the Exiled Qi. It was the Guzhou Cauldron that had isolated Vast Cicada from his Precious Tusk all those years ago...

'Since the lands below Louxia have been emptied, and Yang Ruiyi has arrived with the Exiled Qi, from this moment on, we can forget about Zanmen sending any aid to support Jiang Fuwang at Mianchi!'

He understood that he was now completely helpless. He could only sit in his seat, his mouth shut, still not speaking. Only when the voices below quieted slightly did Jiang Toushou's voice drift out faintly:

"Fellow Daoists, I, Jiang, came down from the mountain to take command. I am not one of the Seven Aspects; I have no territory or foundation to speak of. I originally had no conflict with that White Qilin. It was only to protect the interests of our Buddhist Dao that I exerted myself..."

"We fought from Sanjiang to the lands north of the Huai, then retreated from there to Guanzhong, and now we cannot even leave Zanmen. How much effort each of you has put forth, I am sure you know in your own hearts."

He was utterly disappointed. He rose to his feet and sneered,

"I see that the White Qilin's momentum is now unstoppable. From this day forward... let each family sweep the snow from their own doorstep, and we shall see who is the first to suffer misfortune!"

His words landed with resounding force, causing the one attentive Maha from the Way of Compassion to frown secretly. He then looked to the lotus throne, where Mingmeng also gave a cold laugh and shrugged.

"Well, well, now you know to call him the White Qilin!"
