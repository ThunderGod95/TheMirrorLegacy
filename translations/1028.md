# Chapter 1028: The Demon Lair

Guo Nanwu bowed and departed with Sima Yuanli, vanishing into the Great Void. Li Ximing, still a bit surprised, invited Kuang Yu to sit at the table. He poured her some tea and asked, "Daoist friend, what was that about?"

Kuang Yu shook her head with a faint smile.

"With the Daoist Master from the Sima Family present, there were things I couldn't say," she replied. "After all, he is close with the Dantai, and we have no real rapport. It's best to be cautious."

She accepted the tea with a graceful lift of her hand, smiling as if completely unconcerned about Li Ximing's own relationship with the Sima Family.

"He now calls himself a Sima, so he must bear the Sima Family's karma. Furthermore, old senior Yuanxiu has already built a network for him in the Southern and Eastern Seas. If the Yue State intends to exert influence over the two seas, both he and Daoist Master Zhusheng will be unavoidable. They… will have much to deal with then!"

"By then," Li Ximing mused aloud, "one will be called Daoist Master Sima, the other Protector-General Liu."

He wasn't surprised to hear the name of Daoist Master Zhusheng. He sighed, and Kuang Yu continued,

"I couldn't speak freely before, but I need to be clear with you about this. The Guo family did indeed leave during the end of the Liang, that's true. But the chaotic final years of the Liang dynasty lasted over three hundred years. The central plains fractured into one hundred and twenty-seven states, and the Guo clan was actually one of the feudal lords. Their state was called Yong."

"Feudal lords?"

Li Ximing paused, his expression growing complex. "I had heard that a thousand years ago, the Jie barbarians poured through the passes in the north, leading to an era of many rival states. I just never realized it lasted for three centuries…"

"A centipede with a hundred legs may die, but it won't topple over," Kuang Yu said softly. "The Great Liang was a colossus, after all. Its control over the north was lost after the Emperor of Liang drowned and the military governors rebelled, but its authority lingered. Each governor used the imperial name as their seal of legitimacy, clinging to a dying power. We call this era 'Liang's Fall and Zhao's Rise.' It began with military revolts that shattered the emperor's authority, followed by the Jie barbarian invasion which truly destroyed the Great Liang. Only then could the Zhao dynasty rise… and it all began the day the Emperor of Liang drowned."

A strange look crossed Li Ximing’s face. He had already heard about the emperor's drowning from Kongheng.

"The Great Liang modeled itself after the Great Wei. The Emperor of Liang, no matter what, would have been a high-level cultivator… Drowning? Does this imply… Water Virtue?"

A flicker of fear touched Kuang Yu's features.

"That is something beyond our knowledge. There was no radiance of Water Virtue to be seen. Instead, a comet blazed across the sky, marking the return of Cultivation Transcendence to its place. The Great Liang'sDepartment of Celestial Oversight collapsed—this was the very day the curtain rose on the chaotic end of the dynasty. It was also at this time that travel through the Great Void experienced a surge in speed, and formation plates became widespread…"

'Cultivation Transcendence returning to its place…'

Li Ximing lowered his gaze and sipped his tea, hiding his astonishment. A quick mental calculation told him that this True Monarch had held their position for over a thousand years.

Kuang Yu clearly dared not discuss True Monarch Taiyue further. She forced a smile and changed the subject.

"The king of Yong was named Guo Wusi. He was killed by Qi Wang, the ancestor of the Qi family. Their withdrawal from the mainland signaled the Guo family's complete exit from the stage of that chaotic era. You need not worry about his ties to the north. Don't trouble him with these matters; he has no thoughts of revenge. He wouldn't dare touch that past now!"

'True Monarch Taiyue… is deeply connected to the fall of the Great Liang,' Li Ximing thought.

'She dares to hint at True Monarch Taiyue, yet she avoids talking about the drowning and won't mention that Water Virtue… It's highly likely one of the three great families was involved.'

He nodded silently, lost in thought.

Looking up, he said, "I have one more question. Since that Daoist Master recognized the peculiarity of the Long Yue Variable Gold, would he be willing to share what he knows?"

Kuang Yu sighed. "There's no great secret to it. Nanwu asked about it when he achieved the Purple Mansion Realm. He simply dislikes the Sima Family, which is why he refused to speak. That was him being tactful, considering he wants to sever his family's past karma but also needs something from them."

The woman took a sip of tea. "This item has an aura of radiance and is a 'variable gold.' Naturally, it's inextricably linked to that Lord Taiyu from long ago!"

Li Ximing fell silent for a moment before asking, "To speak frankly, I have some understanding of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. Things here… don’t add up. The Fruition Attainment of Reflecting Metal has only ever been a singular seat. I’ve never heard of splitting it into past and present eras. If it was divided, then why? For what purpose?"

Kuang Yu seemed anxious. After a long pause, she finally said,

"Let me put it this way, Daoist friend. The one who sits upon the golden mountain in the great desert is an evergreen tree of Metal Virtue, an insurmountable peak. Throughout history, there have certainly been figures more powerful than him, and he has met them all. But a figure like him, one who could reshape the world itself, is rare indeed…"

"Perhaps his path to becoming a Monarch may not compare to the Empty Attestation mighty ones of antiquity, but it surpasses more than sixty percent of all other True Monarchs. Even the Fruition Attainment was renamed because of him… which naturally created this distinction between past and present!"

She was piling on the praise, but the more she did, the more unsettled Li Ximing became.

'No matter how much she praises this person, the alteration to Reflecting Metal can't be erased. This isn't praise at all; every word is an accusation!'

A knot formed in Li Ximing’s stomach.

"I have heard of their prowess," he managed to say.

Kuang Yu shook her head, seemingly breathless. His expression clearly told her he didn't grasp the full story.

"This Long Yue Variable Gold is the 'past's gold.' The best way to handle it is to refine and polish it into a small mirror, which can be used to reflect light-based baleful qi. This is what the old Daoist Master said himself, and he spent his entire life forging artifacts. His advice is worth heeding."

"As for other uses…" Kuang Yu paused, a peculiar look on her face. "Giving it to the Golden Feather or the Sword Gate would both be viable options… but doing so would deeply offend the other party."

Li Ximing silently pressed his hand on the jade box, deep in thought. After a long while, he asked, "May I ask the name of the Fruition Attainment?"

Kuang Yu was quiet at first, but soon replied, "When I was studying the Dao at Hengzhu, I read an ancient book, the Five Lectures on Reflecting Metal. It contained some errors. It recorded the Dao of Reflecting Metal as 'the Dao of the White Lightning Reflecting Metal of Shen-You,' claiming it was the orthodox position of Shen-You metal."

"The orthodox position."

Li Ximing seemed dazed, murmuring to himself, "'The orthodox position of Shen-You metal… I was asked to wield the metal… the very Reflecting Metal of this orthodox position…'"

"Daoist friend Zhaojing?" Kuang Yu raised an eyebrow.

Li Ximing shook his head with a small laugh. "It just reminded me of a treasure from the Sima Family."

Kuang Yu nodded.

"Aside from Nanwu's affairs, I have some good news for you. A few years ago, you asked me to find Cold Cloud Heart-Iron. I have news. Daoist Master Xuanyi came across some by chance, and I've brought it for you."

She placed a silver iron box on the table. A layer of frost condensed on its surface, from which flowed a thick white mist. Within the mist lay a palm-sized piece of cold iron, pulsing with a soft white light.

Li Ximing’s eyes lit up.

"What would you like in return?"

The woman hesitated, looking at him for a moment before straightening her posture.

"I once heard that Daoist friend Xuanyi possessed a piece of Shangxiang Silver. My Dao requires it, and I hoped to trade for it… but the matter is… somewhat inappropriate."

"Shangxiang Silver has long since vanished, while spiritual resources of Cold Qi are still relatively common. I would be taking advantage of you."

Li Ximing smiled. "You've put so much thought into Queyi's cultivation methods, and I've seen how you've cared for her all these years. There is no need to be so formal!"

Li Queyi had been cultivating on her island, and the advanced technique she now practiced was thanks to Kuang Yu's efforts. Though she had never mentioned it, Li Ximing had kept it in his heart, unwilling to let himself owe her a favor. He took out the requested treasure and placed it in her hand.

"In fact," he said earnestly, "I feel this is still not enough."

"I am fond of the child," Kuang Yu said, smiling and shaking her head. "It wasn't to earn a favor from your family."

Li Ximing didn't seem convinced, but he let it pass. He escorted her out of the mountain, pressing the Cold Cloud Heart-Iron back into her hands.

"Then please have Nanwu make a trip to deliver this to Dingyang Zi," he said with a smile.

"And while he's there, have him ask for me… how is the progress on that suit of armor for my family?"

"Of course!" Kuang Yu bowed.

"When your esteemed family receives its good news, we will certainly come to offer our congratulations!"

Li Ximing knew she was referring to his enfeoffment as a king. He shook his head with a sigh and returned to the mountain, thinking to himself:

'I'll consolidate my immortal foundation for another year, then attempt to master World's Radiance.'

Hetian Sea, Yinzhou Island.

Yinzhou Island was vast, with rolling mountain ranges steeped in a grim, bloody aura. White bones littered the mountain paths, and Demon beasts were everywhere. It was a world apart, yet it was a frequent stop for those with divine abilities or wreathed in Buddhist light, who traversed the Great Void to land upon its shores.

The water at the island's edge shimmered blue and white. In the Great Void, lotus flowers bloomed, and a golden-robed monk materialized. The rippling light of the sea danced across his head.

His face was as placid as still water, his bearing extraordinary. With a flicker, he transformed into a black-haired Daoist with a long beard and landed in the mountains. Immediately, a green-scaled beast bounded over a peak, slammed the long spear in its hand into the ground, and demanded, "Are you Great Master Minghui?"

Minghui Maha's expression was calm.

"I have come at the invitation of Ping Yan," he said evenly.

"Please lead the way, Demon General."

The green-scaled beast gestured for him to follow.

"Hurry up. Don't keep the Great King waiting."

Anywhere else, upon encountering such a Demon beast, Maha Minghui would have certainly subjugated it as a mount. How could he allow it to speak to him in such a way? But this time was different. Not only did he feel no anger, he even quickened his pace.

'That devil Ping Yan, honestly! He didn't even give me a timely warning… Does he not realize it takes time for me to travel from the mainland?'

At the mountain's peak stood a pavilion. Two figures sat within: one old, one young. The old man had a sallow face and drooping eyebrows, his white beard drifting as he stroked it and spoke. The young man, clad in a long robe with gold-embroidered sleeves, nodded as he listened.

The moment Minghui stepped onto the summit, his eyes fell upon the young man, and he felt his vision burn. Looking closer, he saw a blazing aura of light surrounding the man, a sign that his destiny had reached its zenith. On his neck, scales faintly emerged, traced with white patterns. A chill ran down Minghui's spine.

'So this is the big shot.'

"Minghui of the Lotus Temple, greetings to you two Daoist friends!"

Li Zhouwei looked up at the sound, his gaze falling upon the Daoist. With a flash of his golden eyes, he saw through the disguise to the monk beneath. He heard Ping Yan chuckle.

"Please!"

The monk took his seat, first adjusting his sleeves.

"Daoist friend has achieved the Purple Mansion Realm," he said in congratulation.

"I heard the news even in the north. On behalf of Moongaze, I offer my felicitations!"

Li Zhouwei held no goodwill for Buddhist cultivators. If not for the fact that the Lotus Temple had always maintained close ties with immortal cultivators, and that Minghui was the only one who could handle the items in his possession, he would not be inclined to sit and talk with one. He merely replied,

"You're too kind."

As Li Zhouwei had journeyed across Yinzhou Island, a deep sense of wrongness had settled upon him.

This place, known to outsiders as a celestial mountain on a celestial island, was in reality overrun with rampant Demon beasts. The ground was littered with white bones, feasts were made of piled meat and rice, and pools were filled with crimson blood. A ceaseless stream of human resources from across the Hetian Sea was funneled to this island, allowing the mountain's inhabitants to feast to their hearts' content. Grinning and laughing, their bellies full of food and wine, they would depart the island to patrol the seas as ordered, already looking back with longing.

This scenery was hidden in the forests and tucked away in palaces, but he saw it all with perfect clarity.

'Whether it was Huiyao, a few other Demon beasts, or even the high-ranking figures of the Dragon-kin, they were surely sitting among them, feasting on flesh and drinking blood.'

The title "Dragon-kin's Shepherding of the Seas" was not just for show. Even a family like the Cuis had to obediently hand over spiritual items. They were high-level enough not to have to offer up their own kin for the demons to devour, but the Dragon-kin were not so courteous to the other cultivators of the Eastern Sea!

'Over the years… the white bones on Yinzhou Island could be piled into mountains, enough to pave the sea floor and form reefs.'

And the “Daoist” Ping Yan was no Daoist. Lowering his gaze, a single glance pierced him: beneath the skin-bag lay only bleached bone, reshaped into a skeletal frame. His robe concealed roiling demonic vapor and blood light.

The Daoist before him now was no Daoist at all, but a portly monk. The radiance of the Way of Joyful Bliss shone from his body, but the Way of Joyful Bliss was no righteous path. This mountain of Ping Yan's, this great island of the Dragon-kin—to call it a den of demons and devils would be no exaggeration at all.

'This is the true face of the Hornless Dragon lineage.'

His face remained a mask of cold indifference. Minghui, not at all awkward, smiled and took a seat to the side. Only then did Ping Yan speak, his voice deep and resonant, like that of a highly accomplished cultivator.

"Apologies for keeping you waiting, Great King!"

But in the reflection of Li Zhouwei's golden eyes, it was merely a skull opening and closing. Without a word, Li Zhouwei reached into his sleeve and produced a clattering cascade of golden artifacts—rings, kasayas, cups, lotus thrones—that piled up on the ground, radiating a brilliant light.

Minghui stood up in astonishment, his eyes scanning each item. But Ping Yan’s gaze was fixed on Li Zhouwei.

"Great King, your arrival from so far away was quite unexpected. My mountain is a humble place; I fear we have been poor hosts."

"It's of no concern," Li Zhouwei said, shaking his head.

Ping Yan’s eyes flickered. He could feel the surging aura of Bright Yang Qi, which made his demonic cultivation technique slightly uncomfortable. A dark color swirled in his pupils.

"Great King… I have heard… that you possess a treasure called the Pure Yang, a gift from the White Dragon Crown Prince. Is this true?"

"Oh?" Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, his gaze suddenly turning sharp as a blade.

"Indeed. What business is it of yours, Daoist friend Ping Yan?"

"Hoh." Ping Yan lifted an eyebrow and smiled, the expression looking stiff on his sallow face.

"Some days ago," he said in a low voice, "there was a great banquet in the sea. A demon brought up this matter, challenging the Crown Prince and provoking the great anger of the Dragon King of Beihai Sea. Although I was not present, I received several instructions… A certain lord from the Black Dragon shrine… would also like to meet the Great King!"

Li Zhouwei’s gaze was probing, sweeping over Ping Yan's face as he tried to determine which Dragon King he served. But before he could answer, he heard the faint sound of soft footsteps.

Li Zhouwei's body relaxed further. Leaning against the table, he said casually,

"Be my guest."

But before the words had even left his mouth, a cold wind whipped through the pavilion, and a man in black was standing just outside it.

The man was tall, his face as if carved by a knife and axe—fierce and powerful. His expression was savage and cold. Two locks of black hair fell across his pristine forehead, fluttering gently in the wind. A long saber was tied at his waist, its scabbard made of white bone and adorned with jewels, rolling with a deep demonic qi.

The man bared his teeth in a cold smile. Bristles began to emerge from his neck, releasing a torrent of demonic qi into the air that formed a black, baleful wind swirling around his body.

"Guangfou, of the Black Dragon shrine."

Li Zhouwei raised his eyes to meet the man's gaze. The dragon eyes were brimming with churning demonic qi and killing intent, which instantly triggered a cold, wary smile in his heart.

'Good… He truly wants to kill me.'

Ping Yan was already bowing respectfully, having left his seat. Minghui was terrified, looking back and forth in a panic, sweat beading on his forehead. Only the golden-eyed young man remained standing calmly in the pavilion.

"Minghuang. Li Zhouwei." he said coldly.
