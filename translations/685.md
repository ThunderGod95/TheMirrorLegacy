# Chapter 685: Seclusion

On Mount Wu, a white mist of spiritual qi drifted through the air, flowing along the intricate patterns carved into the jade structures. At the highest point, atop a jade pillar where all the energies converged, the celestial light was brilliant.

Li Ximing sat cross-legged upon it, his pale white Daoist robes with their golden trim fluttering gently. His cultivation had reached its peak.

'The Jewel Steps technique was difficult,' he thought, 'but as I delved deeper, I found I could constantly cross-reference it with my memories of the Huai River Map, that ancient Purple Mansion spiritual artifact. It made things much easier.'

After many years of cultivation, aided by several flashes of insight from that long-ago opportunity, his progress had not been slow. Now, as the morning light shone and the pure qi was at its clearest, he had finally mastered the secret art.

'Jewel Steps is a secret art that tempers the will and strengthens the spiritual sense. By using the Radiant Origin Pass as a focal point, I can project its light over the entire mountain. Wherever the light touches, a cultivator’s dharma power will be clarified, protecting them from the peril of inner demons.'

The manifestation of the Jewel Steps technique appeared upon his immortal foundation. He knew that if he were to unleash the Radiant Origin Pass now, illusory, treasure-like steps would materialize by the two corner towers and the central gate. He kept the power contained.

'This is troublesome… I don’t know how much the other sects know about the Radiant Splendor immortal foundation. These Jewel Steps are clearly unique. If any records from the old Wei-Li family still exist, they might be able to tell I’ve cultivated this technique.'

With a quiet sigh, he concluded, 'It’s probably best if I avoid any more fights.'

He exhaled slowly and raised his gaze to a jade water clock on a nearby pillar. In the basin below, fifty-four perfectly round jade beads were piled together.

'I estimated it would take ten years to master, but it only took about half that time.'

That, at least, was a good thing. Li Ximing looked away and retrieved a light purple jade slip. With a turn of his hand, he began to read about the next secret art: the Great Fissure.

This technique was related to ocular arts. The text was far more extensive, and nothing about it felt familiar. As he scanned it, his heart sank.

'This is several times more difficult than Jewel Steps… and that’s not even accounting for the mutual repulsion between the different secret arts. The time it will take is almost impossible to calculate!'

Furthermore, he suspected the Huai River Map had been a Purple Mansion spiritual artifact corresponding to both the Radiant Origin Pass and another technique, which was why it had been so beneficial for his Jewel Steps practice. The Great Fissure was clearly unrelated, so that advantage was gone.

'I'll have to cultivate this one honestly, step by step. It will take at least twenty or thirty years! And if I run into any parts I can't comprehend, who knows how long it will be delayed!'

Having made his assessment, Li Ximing put the jade slip away. He rose from the jade pillar, light gathering around him, and flew out through the formation. The morning sun was bright as he soared toward the center of the island. The cultivators before the main hall all bowed their heads in greeting.

He strode into the hall but did not see Li Zhouwei. Instead, a young man in black robes and silver armor stood in the center of the room. Six slender, elegant, silver-white ancient tokens hung from his waist.

The man was not particularly tall, but the armor made his shoulders seem broad. His features were sharp and clear, his eyes like polished lacquer, exceptionally captivating. A faint purple mark was imprinted on his brow as he stood bathed in the brilliant morning light.

'He looks so familiar!'

Li Ximing paused. Though the young man was only at the initial stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, his bearing was anything but ordinary. The young man looked up, his eyes filled with joy. He had recognized Li Ximing at once.

"Chenghui pays his respects to Uncle!" he said with a bow.

"Chenghui! Good…"

Li Ximing’s eyes were fixed on the six tokens at the man’s waist. He had guessed his identity, and now it was confirmed. Overjoyed, he nodded repeatedly, took two steps forward, and pulled him by the hand to sit down.

"Excellent, excellent," he praised. "With you breaking through to Foundation Establishment, the Radiant Lure generation has a worthy successor! You're only in your early fifties, aren't you? Opportunity is a hard thing to predict. I once thought few among you would be able to reach this realm, but you managed it with the tide of the world, without even needing an Essence Gathering Pill!"

This was the first time Li Chenghui had spoken so informally with this elder. He perched on the edge of his chair and answered respectfully, "Uncle, Brother Huai has also entered seclusion on the island, and First Brother Chengliao should be emerging soon. I was merely reckless and seized an early opportunity."

But Li Ximing shook his head.

Though Li Chenghui was among the most talented of his generation, he had received few resources throughout his cultivation. When the spiritual tides of the Eastern Sea rose, he had gone to the islands to train. But he had been caught up in one turmoil after another, at times even losing contact with the family, let alone using any of their resources.

When it was finally time for his breakthrough, he hadn't even been given one of the family’s Essence Gathering Pills. Although Li Chenghui was of the direct line, his resources had been less than those of An Siwei and the others. It was almost as if he had been exiled. Li Ximing wasn't in charge of the family, but he had heard Li Xuanxuan lament it dozens of times, so he was well aware of the situation.

"You have been wronged all these years!"

"Uncle, you speak too seriously."

The words made Li Chenghui anxious. The light in the young man's eyes dimmed as he said gravely, "My brothers went to war, and eight out of ten perished. I, meanwhile, sat peacefully in the sect's spiritual font, focusing solely on cultivation. How could I dare feel any resentment? To receive the Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman right after my breakthrough… I feel it is far too great an honor."

Li Ximing’s heart relaxed. After a few more words with him, he looked into the young man's eyes and found them unusually dark, with a strange, captivating quality. "Have you cultivated an ocular art?" he asked.

Li Chenghui nodded quickly. "Uncle has a discerning eye. I spent decades overseas and came upon a small opportunity, mastering a technique called the Yin-Bright Profound Eyes. I have already sent the manual home."

Li Ximing nodded, satisfied. Li Chenghui then added, a little awkwardly, "This ocular art requires a spirit liquid called Scaled Wood Profound Liquid to master. It’s usually only found in the Admirable Sea. When I found my opportunity, I used that portion myself and had none left for the family…"

Li Ximing gave him a surprised look. "What is there to apologize for? It was your opportunity; of course you should be the one to use it."

Apart from Li Zhouwei, no one in the Chengming or Zhouxing generations had received a Talisman Seed, and their performances had been mostly unremarkable. He hadn't expected Li Chenghui to have changed so much. Highly pleased, he encouraged him, "Lord Tongya was in his thirties before his true talents began to show. Continue to work hard."

He ignored Li Chenghui's modest deflections and asked, "Where is Zhouwei?"

Li Chenghui replied softly, "Uncle, the family has found a spirit jade vein in the Helin Mountains. The patriarch had it surveyed, and the reserves are sufficient to build the White Jade Grand Court required for the 'Courtly Red Dust Qi' technique from the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra*."

"However," he continued, "since jade has become more common, a demon of the True Jade lineage has occupied the mountain and is commanding a host of lesser demons. The patriarch had to go deal with it."

Li Ximing frowned. "Just tell him to be careful not to fall into a trap."

"Don't worry, Uncle!" Li Chenghui replied reassuringly. "It's not far, and with the matter at the Azure Pond Sect settled, the way is quite safe."

Hearing this, Li Ximing’s brow furrowed. "What happened at the Azure Pond Sect? Did Si Yuanli make his move?"

Li Chenghui smiled. "He did. Years ago, Chi Buhua was killed in the Sea of Reefs by Third Uncle, who is now Peak Master Changtian, 'Heavenly Pavilion Heavenly Glow.' His Excellency escaped with ease on a Dawn Rayfish, and the six pursuers couldn't even catch his shadow."

"Then, 'Scorpion Child' Lingu Rao attacked Green Pine Island. Fei Luoya opened the grand formation, and Ning Hejing was killed. 'Azure Flash Sword' Si Yuanli then appeared in the main hall, captured Chi Fubo and his faction who had controlled the sect and mistreated the other families, and rescued the Sect Master…"

He paused, then explained, "The Sect Master is now in seclusion for his breakthrough. Si Yuanli is managing the sect in his stead."

"Oh…"

The amount of information was staggering. It took Li Ximing more than a dozen breaths to process it all. "Then what about Uncle?" he finally asked.

Li Chenghui understood who he meant. "His Excellency endured great humiliation, feigning compliance with the Ning family and Chi Fubo. He was handsomely rewarded by Si Yuanli and is now also in seclusion to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm."

"Good!"

Li Ximing finally felt a sense of relief. After a few moments, he smiled. "Brother Zhi has become truly formidable!"

"Indeed!" Li Chenghui said in a low voice. "I hear His Excellency's magical arts are incredibly profound, even surpassing those of Lingu Xia back in her day. He's called the number one spellcaster in the Azure Pond Sect and is now in charge of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, making him one of the most powerful figures there!"

"Furthermore, I've heard that he always carries a longsword but has never drawn it, fighting only with his arts. A rumor says his swordsmanship far surpasses his spellcasting. If someone could force him to draw his sword, they would witness the true grace of a family of sword immortals as his blade split the sky."

As Li Chenghui spoke, a look of shared pride and joy lit up his face, his eyes shining with a smile.

"Is that so!"

Li Ximing was half-incredulous. He thought to himself, 'I always used to hear him say that Xijun's sword Dao was superior. I never imagined that his swordsmanship and his magical arts would advance in tandem to such a degree! He has already far surpassed me!'

He chose to believe it for the moment and smiled. "Good! With Third Brother's great prestige, he will be able to support the family should anything happen in the future."

Li Chenghui agreed. Just then, a set of footsteps approached the hall. Li Xuanxuan entered hurriedly from outside. The old man was dressed in a light blue robe, his white beard flowing. An old talisman brush, which he had used for nearly a century, hung at his waist, his gaze full of concern.

"Ming'er."

"Grandfather!"

Li Ximing stood to greet him. He saw two more people behind him, a boy and a girl, both just over ten years old. The boy had a slightly pointed chin and a warm smile. The girl was very polite, bowing her head and offering greetings.

Though Li Ximing was often in seclusion, he recognized Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan. He smiled at them, then asked his grandfather in a low voice, "Is there any change in Aunt's fate jade?"

"None."

Li Xuanxuan checked it day after day; he might as well have been living in the ancestral hall. "She has been gone for years," he said, his voice hoarse. "Though the jade's luster has waxed and waned, there are no signs of cracking. It is currently warm and bright. It seems she is in no danger."

"Good…"

In truth, both grandson and grandfather knew that with her by the Dragon Monarch's side, the fate jade was most likely useless. But it offered a sliver of comfort, something to hold on to.

Li Ximing sat quietly, listening as they recounted the events of the past few years. The sun eventually set, and the celestial light in the hall grew dim. Magical lamps flickered to life, illuminating the space with a bright glow.

When they had finished, Li Ximing let out a soft laugh. He took the old man's hand and said gently, "Grandfather, my cultivation has reached a bottleneck, and the family is prosperous and thriving. I will enter seclusion to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm."

Li Xuanxuan froze. He looked at the young man in Daoist robes before him. The old man lowered his eyes, and for a moment, he was speechless. He finally said in a low voice, "You all may leave."

Li Chenghui's expression turned solemn as he led the two children away.

Li Xuanxuan had lost his father at birth and had buried two elders. After Li Xuanfeng's death, he had watched his peers pass away one by one. And as the Yuanqing generation faded, Li Ximing was the only one of the Xiyue generation left in the family.

He was at a loss for words. A heavy silence fell over the hall.

"When I was young, I was foolish and caused Grandfather, Father, and my uncles much worry," Li Ximing began softly. "When my father was on his deathbed, I did not see him even once. That was the height of unfilial piety… For all these sins, the fault lies with my own cowardice."

"In terms of selfless devotion, I am not as good as First Brother. In courage and bearing, I am not as good as Third Brother. In intelligence and wit, I am not as good as Jun'er. Even in facing danger with calm and self-respect, I am not as good as Yuexiang."

His expression held no hesitation, no self-pity, only a quiet statement of fact. "If any one of them had been in my position, there would not have been so much sorrow. It would have been best to let me be an alchemist, rising with the sun to absorb qi and sleeping in the mountains at dusk."

"But I was the one who took that breath all those years ago."

"Why must you say such things!" Li Xuanxuan whispered.

Li Ximing gave a faint smile. "Grandfather, do you remember when I went to the Xiao family and was led astray by wine and women, causing Father great disappointment?"

Li Xuanxuan could only nod silently. His grandson’s raw confession had thrown him into disarray. He couldn't help but suspect that this attempt at a breakthrough was a form of suicide, but the words were caught in his throat.

Li Ximing, however, sipped his tea as if recounting some amusing anecdote after a meal. "That woman was actually a proper lady," he said quietly. "Every time I went to see her, my heart would burn with passion. But every time I went to loosen my belt, I would freeze. A coldness would rise from the soles of my feet, and I would be seized by a fear I couldn't control. I would arrive full of excitement and leave in utter defeat."

"But I kept going back to her, and every time, I was paralyzed by fear. In the end, I stopped even trying to undo my belt. I would just touch her for a bit and then leave. She grew impatient and plied me with spirit wine. When I awoke, I found the situation irreparable."

"That was why, when Jun'er asked me what happened, I said I didn't know."

"Later, after I broke through to Foundation Establishment, my old memories became clear. The events of that day replayed in my mind. In my terror, even while drunk, I had clutched my belt so tightly that I refused to let go. She tried, but she couldn't pry my hands away."

"The spirit cloth was tough. She couldn't cut it with scissors, so she had to stage the scene by taking off her own clothes. Whether it was her own idea or someone else's direction… since nothing happened, no one cared to investigate."

Now a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator, he spoke of this without a trace of fear. "Grandfather," he said softly, "I never got the chance to explain it to him."

Li Xuanxuan was stunned into silence. He stared blankly at his grandson. "Why didn't you tell me…" he finally managed.

"It wouldn't have mattered anymore." Li Ximing turned his head to the side. "I am a man of ambition but no courage. I have been a coward for most of my life. But not anymore. Ximing has nothing left to lose. Our family has never had anyone perish while attempting to reach the Purple Mansion Realm. Today, let it begin with me."

The young man rose from his seat. Li Xuanxuan, his expression a storm of emotions, was led by him to the front of the hall, still unable to process what he had heard. The old man's voice trembled as he spoke.

"Ximing… Ping'er… he never blamed you."

Li Ximing paused at the words but did not reply. He reached the entrance of the hall and performed a grand, formal rite to his grandfather. After three full bows and nine kowtows, he said with utmost respect, "Grandfather, please take good care of your health."

He straightened up and transformed into a ray of brilliant light, not daring to look at the old man again as he flew toward Mount Wu.

Li Xuanxuan was left collapsed on the steps, his white beard trembling. He took several deep, shuddering breaths before he could calm himself.
