# Chapter 791: Molten Fire Dao

Li Ximing secluded himself atop the peak for several months, comprehending the contents of the Radiant Essence Scripture. It contained a total of nine secret techniques that would be planted into his Immortal Foundation to nurture divine abilities.

At present, I have only managed to cultivate one... thought Li Ximing.

Once he cultivated the first secret technique, Bright Yang, a golden mark appeared on his Radiant Origin Pass, enhancing his mana circulation by half and slightly boosting his overall strength.

Though the nine secret techniques differed slightly, there was no fixed order; any of them could be cultivated first. Since Bright Yang could solidify his mana and was broadly useful, Li Ximing chose to cultivate it first.

While successfully cultivating a secret technique was a good thing, Li Ximing did not pause and immediately started on the second, but his expression soon turned grim.

When he tried to condense the second secret technique into his Immortal Foundation, it clashed with the first, Bright Yang, making the difficulty soar by a full fifty percent!

I thought it would take just over a century to complete all nine... but even centuries may not be enough.

His heart sank. He finally understood why so few reached the Purple Mansion Realm in the mighty Azure Pond Sect, and why cultivators like Li Encheng delayed their breakthroughs until the brink of death...

What's worse, as more secret techniques are cultivated, the repulsive forces will compound, making it nearly impossible to complete even one more! Then I’ll have to bet on a mere five or ten percent chance to break through...

He ceased his spell arts and rose from the jade throne within his cave dwelling, where the spiritual energy was the densest in his entire family. The throne, brought back from Mount Wu, was the finest cultivation artifact.

Its radiance illuminated his face, but made Li Ximing squint slightly. Time had flown like a snap of the fingers, and though he was nearing sixty, his face, lit by the luminous jade, still looked like that of a young man.

Li Ximing examined his train of thought twice before pulling out a jade slip. This jade slip contained nearly a hundred thousand words of insights he had gained while cultivating the Bright Yang secret technique. Li Ximing had initially been greatly ambitious and hoped to master seven or eight techniques, record each carefully, and compile them into a volume to leave behind even if he failed to break through...

But staring at the contents of the jade slip now, he could only mutter, "Reaching the Purple Mansion Realm is not the achievement of one generation. My family rose too late. After several generations of climbing, we’ve only now reached the starting point that the Xiao Family had long ago..."

Li Ximing needed no further thought to understand that countless secret technique cultivation experiences must have been compiled over the generations in the Azure Pond Sect’s Dark Floating Compliant Cloud Sutra and Lucid Marsh Profound Cave Sutra. Figures like Chi Wei, Chi Buzi, and the earlier Chi Family members had long documented all the crucial details.

Zhang Yun and Qing Jifang surely had similar resources. Xiao Chuting’s breakthrough into the Purple Mansion Realm was no accident. Xiao Xianyou must have schemed thoroughly and even acquired legacies from the Lingyu Gate to achieve success.

But time waits for no one! Now is the best opportunity...

Li Ximing was not blind to the situation. The Golden Core Realm cultivators of the Three Sects had yet to reappear. Whether the strife among them had ended was unknown, but all were likely wounded and would not show themselves. The Azure Pond Sect, in particular, had been drained by Chi Wei’s exploitation, resulting in five centuries without fresh talent.

It was even more rare that the Chi Family’s Purple Mansion Realm line was almost extinct, and Suiguan, neither fully human nor ghost, cared nothing for the family's interests. It was the perfect time to ascend to the Purple Mansion Realm, since such chances would vanish once the Three Sects recovered!

He did not believe himself as cunning as Xiao Chuting, who had seized a gap between sects to ascend to the Purple Mansion Realm, leveraging conflicts and sacrifices to force Azure Pond’s consent. Xiao Chuting had risen to become a leading figure among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, and Li Ximing thought himself not even a fraction as capable as that elder.

"Zhouwei is now only at the mid-stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Though he is exceptionally talented, he is not like Chu Yi, a True Monarch reincarnated. It will take at least another twenty or thirty years for him to reach the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm... How much time will the great battle at Mount Bianyan leave us? By then, the situation may no longer be favorable...

"I once thought that with diligent cultivation and ignoring worldly matters, there would be at least a fifty percent chance of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm. But now... unless I can obtain a Bright Yang spirit item, there is only a slight chance to fight for it.”

Li Ximing's gaze grew somber, his expression no longer reflecting the usual focus of cultivation. His posture and demeanor shifted, revealing a heavy sense of worry.

"If only I could refine some pills..."

He could be considered a master of alchemy. Although he focused mainly on cultivation and seldom refined pills for others, he had seen and studied many pill recipes, including numerous rare and wondrous formulas.

Li Ximing sat silently, gazing at a wooden slip for a while, until he heard knocking on the door of his cave dwelling. He rose as if waking from a dream when a servant came to report that Li Zhouwei requested an audience.

He stepped out of the cave and saw a youth in a black cloak standing solemnly before the hall. His tiger-like eyes were fierce and his presence imposing. Li Ximing could not help but admire him inwardly, My son should be grown by now. In my race against time for cultivation, I've only seen him three times in over a decade. I feared he has become a spoiled wastrel.

After hearing Li Zhouwei's report and asking a few more questions, Xu Peiyu was brought into the hall. Li Ximing examined the young woman carefully, sweeping her twice with his spiritual sense, and frowned. "Her vitality is severely damaged."

Having refined pills for many years under the tutelage of Xiao Yuansi, he was deeply knowledgeable in this field. After a thorough inspection, although he found nothing obviously wrong, he still took out two pills for Xu Peiyu to consume, which considerably improved her spirits.

"These Vitality Returning Powder and Clarity Settling Pills must be taken daily. Also, bring some spirit items from home so I can concoct a formula to treat her as if she were born with innate deficiencies."

When he saw the unease on Xu Peiyu's face as she timidly peeked at him, Li Ximing reassured her, "Our family possesses an abundance of spirit pills and medicines, rest assured, we can certainly safeguard both mother and child."

Li Ximing then dismissed Xu Peiyu with a wave, raising his brows as he looked at Li Zhouwei and said in a low voice, "I can't fully grasp the situation. We may need to consult Kongheng.

"Firstly, matters concerning unborn children fall more within the expertise of the devil and buddhist Daos. Kongheng has traveled extensively in the north and likely holds insights into such cases. Secondly... his temple once worshiped the Undefeated King of Brightness, who was part of the Bright Yang Dao Lineage. There are many records, and it's necessary to inquire further."

Li Zhouwei gave him a thoughtful glance and responded solemnly. Li Ximing continued his questioning, "Any other news from the family?"

Li Zhouwei naturally understood what Li Ximing was concerned about. He pulled a letter from his sleeve and replied, "A letter from the north, uncle. Please take a look."

Li Ximing took the letter, glanced over it briefly, and his eyes immediately lit up. He exclaimed, "Good, good, good... Finally, some news! Though difficult, it's far better than having no trace at all!"

This letter was naturally penned by Li Qinghong, who reported that the Radiant Sky Stone had fallen into the hands of Yu Fuzi of Changxiao Gate. Li Ximing was filled with immense joy.

Li Zhouwei had already read the letter earlier and now spoke in a low voice, "Indeed, the Radiant Sky Stone was obtained by Yu Fuzi in Dongning Palace. The spiritual energy in Xu State is chaotic and difficult to predict, making it hard even for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Maha to manipulate. It might actually be safer because of that."

Li Ximing nodded and saw golden light flickering in Zhouwei’s eyes as he continued, "With a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator stationed at Changxiao Gate, we cannot recklessly offend them. We might fall into a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's scheme. We can only rely on another Purple Mansion Realm cultivator to secretly plot from within.

"Currently, Changxiao Gate and Hengzhu Dao Gate are locked in endless conflict. Their hatred runs deep. We could exploit this. Whether by allying with Hengzhu Dao Gate or trading with them, we must find an opportunity to obtain the treasure."

Li Ximing listened for a while and nodded. Zhouwei stood tall and said, "No matter what, we must first investigate Yu Fuzi, find out his cultivation and what treasures he possesses, as well as his temperament and preferences. As long as he is not hiding within his sect without stepping out, there will be an opportunity. The only problem is that our senior members are stationed guarding the northern borders and cannot act freely. Future movements will be hard to coordinate..."

After Zhouwei finished analyzing the situation, Li Ximing stroked his beard and nodded, dispatching people to investigate. Then he smiled at the younger man and said gently, "I've encountered a bottleneck in my cultivation recently and just emerged from seclusion. I thought about refining some pills, partly to enhance our cultivation, and partly to clear my thoughts. A change of pace might bring about a breakthrough."

Li Zhouwei asked, "Uncle, you mean..."

"I wonder if there are any Bright Yang-type demons in the Eastern Sea. We could capture one and use it in alchemy for supplementation..." said Li Ximing.

Li Zhouwei was slightly surprised and replied, "Such creatures are rare in the Eastern Sea, but I will investigate immediately. There may have been no news of them in recent years."

He gave Li Ximing a careful look, sensing that his uncle was somewhat different today. But an unaware Li Ximing simply nodded in agreement.

Li Zhouwei poured some tea and suddenly spoke, "Uncle, there is one more thing we might try."

Li Ximing looked at him in confusion, and Zhouwei continued softly, "Uncle, do you still remember the Aged Courtly Path Scripture?"

Of course, Li Ximing knew of it. The technique had once been cultivated by the Jiang Family. Its grade was unknown, but it was extremely powerful. Sadly, its Qi-gathering method had long become obsolete. Yet, the Yu Family’s ancestor Yu Yufeng had managed to master a preserved portion of it, earning great fame and the title White Jade Hand.

Though he had been gravely wounded for many years, Yu Yufeng had forced three Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators and a grand formation to work together just to slay him. His fall had marked the beginning of the Yu Family’s decline.

Seeing Li Ximing nod, Li Zhouwei straightened and said seriously, "It’s my suspicion that this technique most likely originated before Heaven's Change. It only failed later. Now that the True Jade has returned to its place, perhaps it can be tried again. If the Qi-gathering method works, our family will gain another Purple Mansion Realm technique!

"This is a high-grade technique, so it would be perfect to bestow upon the younger generation of the family!"

Thanks to the fortune of Mirage Mirror Heaven of the Green Pine Grotto Heaven, the Li Family's Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques now ranked among the best of all families. They boasted two fourth-grade Six Chapters Seeking Immortality manuals and the Scaled Beasts Inquiry Technique, as well as the impressive fifth-grade Insights of Taihua.

However, when it came to Qi Cultivation Realm and Foundation Establishment Realm techniques, the family was less well-stocked. The fifth-grade Radiant Essence Scripture was vital and could not be handed out casually. Apart from the fourth-grade Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique, the rest of the manuals were only third-grade.

Li Ximing started to nod repeatedly. Matters of the family were already largely entrusted to this younger generation. Knowing Zhouwei wouldn’t mention this without reason, he asked, "What needs to be done?"

Li Zhouwei replied, "We need to collect Dust of the Court. A grand courtyard of pure white jade is required, preferably jade imbued with spiritual power, bathed in radiance, guarded by a thousand, and surrounded by ten thousand residents. Each year would yield a wisp and ten years to gather a portion."

Li Ximing’s eyelids dropped as he answered, "This would indeed exhaust our resources and burden the people... Where would we even find so much spirit jade? Though jade is flourishing now, assembling enough for a grand courtyard would require a whole small mountain’s worth..."

"In the end, I fear we will have to trouble you, uncle..." said Li Zhouwei.

Just as Zhouwei was about to speak, he suddenly sensed something and snapped his head westward. He saw a patch of fiery clouds about five thousand kilometers away, a vague crimson hue floating at the horizon like a rising star.

A brilliant light swept across the sky, dispersing distant clouds and leaving only the flickering bright hue on the far horizon. A solemn young voice emerged, "I, Tu Longjian of the Slaughter Jun Gate, have today achieved the Purple Mansion Realm and attained the Molten Fire divine ability! I shall rebuild the Slaughter Jun Immortal Gate at Kuijun Mountain! Three months hence, I will consolidate the Wu Kingdom and establish a county capital. Fellow cultivators are welcome to attend the ceremony!

"All cultivators of the Slaughter Kui Dao lineage are welcome at Kuijun Mountain to aid in the reconstruction of the sect!"

Although the voice had faded by the time it reached them, its vibrant and confident tone remained clear, with the fiery glow at the horizon pulsing in response to his words.

Tu Longjian has attained a divine ability... how magnificent...

Li Ximing suddenly lifted his head to look at the hazy Fire Virtue glow of Molten Fire at the horizon. Since Tu Longjian’s words could reach here, Kuijun Mountain must not be far from Moongaze Lake and was likely near Yue State.

His heart surged, and he said gravely, "It’s a rare instance of Molten Fire even within Yue State and the Eastern Sea... It will likely stand unparalleled across all Jiangnan. From now on, whenever Molten Fire is mentioned, everyone will think of the Slaughter Jun Gate."

Li Zhouwei found it rather interesting. The Li Family had once received teachings from the Slaughter Jun Gate; even the white ape had once refined medicine there. Traditionally, the Slaughter Jun Gate’s techniques leaned toward Yin and cold energies such as Cold Qi, Veiled Yin, and Lesser Yin types of cultivation.

But now, rising from decline, Tu Longjian had acquired the Six Ding Merging Fire Token, transforming the gate into one associated with Molten Fire and Merging Fire instead.

We must send someone to offer congratulations!

Li Ximing’s expression lit up with joy. After all, Tu Longjian had formed ties with the Li Family as early as his Foundation Establishment Realm and Qi Cultivation Realm days, and he greatly respected Li Yuanjiao. He was, without doubt, a natural ally.

Li Zhouwei only allowed An Siwei to step forward. Li Ximing hurriedly said, "Go to the treasury and pick out a few precious spirit items... Ah, for a Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough, especially with such a close Daoist Master, we ought to send treasured panaceas! What else do we have in the treasury?"

"Uncle, please wait a moment." Li Ximing had barely finished speaking when Li Zhouwei stopped him, his heir's golden eyes glinting with a trace of a smile as he said, "In my opinion, whether or not we send lavish gifts, we should definitely have the white ape deliver them personally."

Li Ximing was momentarily stunned upon hearing this, but then immediately understood, his face blooming into a broad smile as he said, "Exactly! Exactly! You’ve thought of everything. Having the white ape deliver congratulations would be perfect. If the Daoist Master recognizes the white ape, it would be even better... Without you, I would have nearly made a blunder!"

Li Zhouwei had heard the white ape mention this person long ago and knew that the white ape was acquainted with Tu Longjian. Hence, he had carefully made this suggestion.

He flicked his black cloak, cupped his fists in return, and said with a nod, "I will arrange it immediately."

Li Zhouwei rode the wind and immediately departed. Li Ximing sat quietly in his cave dwelling for a while, pondering inwardly, Yu Fuzi, the Bright Yang demonic creatures, and Spirit Jade Mountain... It's a pity the timing is off, otherwise going out to the Eastern Sea to gather information would have been most convenient.

He took out his pill furnace, thinking to himself, Xijun’s injuries will take a long time to heal. Once the white ape returns from delivering congratulations, I’ll send him out... That old demon is still the most reliable.
