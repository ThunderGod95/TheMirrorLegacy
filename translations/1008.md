# Chapter 1008: Yang Tianya

A hush fell over the room after Li Zhouwei spoke. Li Ximing, restless with anxiety, rose to his feet. He hesitated, pacing for a moment, but ultimately decided against mentioning the matter concerning Xiao Yuansi.

Li Xuanxuan furrowed his brow. “At the very least… no consequences have manifested yet.”

“Whatever the truth of the matter, we must be mentally prepared,” Li Zhouwei said. “Regarding the Ancestor’s affairs, and the events of a century ago—no matter how much they know, we must be on our guard.”

Li Ximing nodded and offered his own counsel. “The situation in the north… their message is quite clear. Luoxia doesn’t particularly care about us; they’ll use us if we’re useful, and discard us if we’re not. Since the Underworld is a power on the same level as Luoxia, their decision-making in this regard might be quite similar…”

Li Zhouwei studied both of their expressions carefully before looking away and nodding in silent agreement.

“Furthermore,” the old man said, his voice deep and resonant, “we were born because of our lord’s will, and we shall die for it. The entanglement with the Bright Yang Dao is not without reason.”

The “lord” he spoke of could have been Luoxia or the Underworld, or it could have referred to the Wei-Li heritage. But Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing both knew exactly who he meant.

From their beginnings at Moongaze Lake, no matter which faction they sided with, the Li family’s true backing had never changed. Others might be ignorant, but the three of them understood with perfect clarity that a great “lord” stood behind their clan.

Yet, facing one of the most powerful forces in the world—the Underworld, a behemoth that rivaled Luoxia and held sway over the entire south—Li Ximing felt his confidence waver. Unlike their dealings with Luoxia, their family had risen step by step, right under the Underworld’s watchful eyes.

The three men lapsed into silence. Just as Li Ximing was about to get up, Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze.

“Granduncle should remain at home and focus on his cultivation. This time… allow me to meet with them.”

### Simin Prefecture

The sky was clear and bright.

Sunlight streamed into the pavilion, illuminating the fine dust in the air. A woman with a refined appearance, dressed in black robes, hurried up the stairs. She paused at the door to straighten her clothes before stepping inside.

_Creak._

The room’s furnishings were stark and simple. A dark wooden chair sat in the center, a cup of hot tea steaming upon the table beside it. An old man, sleeves folded, occupied the main seat, engrossed in a scroll.

Though advanced in age, he possessed a formidable, broad-shouldered build. His imposing aura was palpable, even with his eyes downcast. He was like a sleeping tiger; one look was enough to inspire awe and fear.

The woman bowed low. “Junior Tianyou greets the Ancestor!”

This was none other than Li Jiangliang’s wife, Yang Tianyou, an imperial descendant of the Yang Clan.

“Rise.”

The old man’s gaze remained fixed on the black-covered scroll in his hands, its faint golden characters shimmering in the sunlight. His voice was deep and heavy.

“Tianyou… where is your husband?”

Yang Tianyou lowered her head respectfully. “He is in the prefecture, overseeing the rites for the founding of the new state.”

The old man chuckled softly. “I have observed that boy. He is not of the Bright Yang Dao. Born a son of nobility, yet he shows compassion for the common folk. That is hardly the way of the great clans, nor is it a path to self-preservation.”

Yang Tianyou kept her eyes lowered. The elder finally shifted his gaze to her.

“Tell me,” he said with a smile, “the Ning State had endured for a long time. The Great Ning is close, while the Wei-Li are distant. The Li and Jiang families have been joined by marriage for generations, which is how a figure like Li Jiangqun, favored by the Supreme Yin, came to be. What connection do they truly have with the Bright Yang Dao anymore? In my view, you operatives are far too cautious. A mere trace of a bloodline, and you insist on keeping it under constant watch.”

Yang Tianyou dropped to her knees, her heart seized with fear. “Ancestor… this junior believes that caution is never a mistake. Eliminating future troubles is always for the best.”

The old man finally looked away, his smile vanishing. He set the scroll down.

“Oh?”

His voice was calm, but it made Yang Tianyou tremble. “Ancestor,” she whispered,

“Qingyu Qian and Lord Xuan'an, after all, control an immortal formation and wield the Moon Laurel’s Transmuting Radiance, and they are protected by an Immortal Artifact. The chaos now is already great enough. Once things stabilize, they should be eradicated together to prevent any unforeseen complications!”

The elder sighed. “Your considerations have merit. But if something happens to Xuan'an, that fox demon won't have much time left to cause trouble. What good does their constant scheming do? How many times has this been now?”

“Xuan'an is no Zhang Yuanyu, nor is he Su Xikong. Even those two had to align with the greater situation to achieve their ambitions. What can a cornered rat hiding in a prefecture hope to accomplish, no matter how clever his schemes? He once believed himself a master puppeteer, but the one pulling the strings was never him; it was Senior Yingze.”

“Tang Shu has his eyes on him. Whatever tricks he has, the moment he appears on the list, he will be cast into the Underworld and vanish without a trace. What is the point?”

Yang Tianyou quickly bowed her head in agreement. “This junior understands. When the Prefecture Lord was first reincarnated, he carried the air of one who could command the world, but that aura belonged to Lord Yingze. Afterward… all his pawns, from Duanmu Kui to Li Jiangqun, were exercises in futility. Qingyu Qian is timid and indecisive. He made three attempts, stooping so low as to target minor cultivators and mortals, and each time his plans backfired spectacularly. It’s laughable.”

“Without a great lord’s support, Qingyu Qian is powerless, even with his lake. He thought he had succeeded, but he never knew that a certain lord lost the Sun Seeker Ring, which ended up at the lake, drawing the attention of the Bright Yang Dao. Now they can never wash themselves clean of the association. That group of Ning-Li descendants is now seen as the orthodox lineage of the Wei-Li, and in the end, the world will demand their deaths! He has lost everything!”

She spoke with a slight laugh, all the while cautiously observing the old man.

“Now that the Heaven–Governing Rank Designation has been relegated to the Underworld, they are trapped in their own small world, utterly useless. It’s best to eliminate them sooner rather than later. What if that fox demon backing Qingyu Qian actually succeeds in its breakthrough?”

“Hmm…”

As Yang Tianyou fell silent, the old man spoke casually. “You are naive. The Sun Seeker Ring may well have been a ploy by the fox. We should not underestimate them, but some cuts must be made with a gentle blade. Even if the fox succeeds, so what? We would simply no longer covet their possessions and would welcome her to the table to share the spoils. They have no desire for their monarch to return, either.”

“For us, Luoxia and the Dragon-kin are what truly matter. Once the grand situation is settled, these minor issues can be dealt with all at once. After all… there is still one loose end, hiding in the Southern Sea…”

He smiled, looking at Yang Tianyou with renewed interest. “There is no need to probe me further. You state your position with such conviction. Are you truly certain you hold no desire to preserve even a fraction of that bloodline?”

“This junior would never dare to have divided loyalties!” Yang Tianyou exclaimed in terror.

The old man withdrew his gaze. “Across the entire world, perhaps only my Yang family and Judge Jiang have both the motive and the means to protect them… but we can only ensure their deaths are dignified, not that they live. We can protect the individuals, but not their lineage.”

His tone grew colder. “Qingyu Qian’s little lake is Judge Tang’s affair, outside our jurisdiction. We will use them as we see fit. If the pieces can be played, they will be. If not, they will be discarded. What truly matters is the success or failure of our enterprise in the Great Song. The Ten Halls are watching. If we fail, there will be consequences for us all.”

Yang Tianyou kowtowed repeatedly, cold sweat beading on her brow. Suddenly, the door creaked open and a man entered.

He had an ordinary, unremarkable face and was dressed in black robes. It was Yang Ruiyi of the Yang Clan.

The Daoist Master entered the pavilion and saw Yang Tianyou kneeling on the floor. A flicker of pain crossed his eyes, but he moved swiftly, kneeling beside her without hesitation.

“Ancestor! Someone from the lake has arrived!”

“Oh?” The old man took a sip of tea. “Is it the White Qilin or that Purple Mansion Realm cultivator?”

“It is the White Qilin,” Yang Ruiyi replied respectfully.

A hint of doubt crossed the young man’s face, but the elder merely waved a hand.

“It’s a rare occasion for him to visit the mortal realm. Let him come up.”

Only then did Yang Ruiyi dare to rise. He helped Yang Tianyou to her feet, whispering for her to go downstairs, and then stood respectfully by the old man’s side. The elder stood up, vacating the main seat.

“Sit.”

Yang Ruiyi was momentarily flustered. “Junior… Junior…”

“I said, sit.”

The old man gave the order casually and seated himself in a secondary chair by the window, his gaze fixed on the scenery outside. He waited in silence. A few breaths later, the sound of steady footsteps approached.

_Creak._

The door opened again. Yang Ruiyi’s expression was once again calm as he looked up and smiled. “White Qilin has arrived.”

The pair of golden eyes were particularly striking within the pavilion. Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod. “From the Moongaze Li Clan, Minghuang, Li Zhouwei.”

Yang Ruiyi stood and returned the courtesy with a smile. “From the Simin Yang Clan, Lutao, Yang Ruiyi. Please.”

Li Zhouwei smiled and nodded, a faint golden light glinting in his eyes.

‘Mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, with a profound cultivation base…’

He followed the other man’s lead and took a seat, his eyes turning to meet the gaze of the old man by the window.

The elder’s gaze was calm yet powerful, tinged with a scrutinizing quality as he watched him in silence.

Li Zhouwei’s smile remained unchanged, though he allowed a perfectly measured hint of confusion to show on his face. “And this is…”

Yang Ruiyi quickly rose. “This is my clan’s Ancestor, of the ‘Tian’ generation. His name is Ya, and his Daoist title is Guanxuan!”

A look of sudden understanding dawned on Li Zhouwei’s face. He spoke with neither arrogance nor humility. “So it is Senior Guanxuan!”

‘Yang Tianya…’

The name the Li family had pondered for so long belonged to the man now before him. A ripple went through Li Zhouwei’s heart, a tension that pulled it taut. The first thing to react was, surprisingly, the Great Fissure Golden Pupils he had long since cast to the back of his mind, which now warned him that this person was different.

He looked straight ahead, but a chill was slowly spreading through his heart.

It wasn’t because of the man’s placid demeanor, nor was it due to his own anxiety about the coming conversation. It was because when Li Zhouwei raised his eyes and connected his spiritual sense to the Immortal Artifact, the scene before him abruptly changed.

The sun was still bright, but the table and chair were empty.

There was no old man, no Yang Tianya—only a vacant seat.

Li Zhouwei’s expression remained composed as he stared at the spot. A wave of dizziness washed over him. The world around him flickered, an illusion on the verge of shattering. A single point of blackness descended upon the chair, instantly consuming his vision.

Within this darkness, tides rose and fell in a cycle of life, death, and silent annihilation. All things faded into nameless oblivion, losing their unique essence. Countless shadows sank into its depths, and from the void, a mesmerizing weariness was born.

A cool, clear sensation rushed into his mind, pulling him back from the brink. In that instant of clarity, a single thought dominated his mind:

‘Is he truly Yang Tianya?’

Forcibly suppressing the terror in his heart, Li Zhouwei averted his gaze and said respectfully, “I have long heard of your great name.”

Yang Tianya’s expression was serene. He nodded, his eyes seeming to peer directly into Li Zhouwei’s own. His smile became more genuine, yet tinged with regret. “Remarkable… truly remarkable…”

Li Zhouwei collected himself and returned the gesture. Yang Tianya watched him casually. “Daoist Minghuang, I have heard all about how your esteemed clan has ascended to the status of an Immortal Clan! My congratulations, though they come late.”

Li Zhouwei smiled, but the other man gave him no chance to speak, continuing in a leisurely tone, “I also remember when your clan’s ancestor first made a name for himself in the army. Later, I heard your family was seeking to leverage its position, so I offered some assistance.”

At these words, realization struck Li Zhouwei.

‘Leverage its position, offered some assistance.’

Yang Tianya definitely knew about his ancestor, Li Mutian.

Li Zhouwei sighed, affecting a troubled expression. “In the early days… my clan was beset by endless slaughter and persecution at the foot of our mountain. We were too weak then, living in daily fear of disaster. Our ancestor was but a mortal, yet he somehow caught your lordship’s attention. Relying on this fateful connection, he falsely claimed to be at the Foundation Establishment Realm to protect the clan. This junior is eternally grateful…”

He replied smoothly, expressing his gratitude while deftly shifting the focus back to the other party. But Yang Tianya simply lowered his head and sipped his tea.

“A descendant of a noble immortal cultivator, appearing in the army,” he mused. 

“How could one not take notice?”

He was speaking the truth, of course, but he was also concealing half of it, deliberately omitting which family’s descendant he meant. He looked up with a smile, but his eyes were intently focused on Li Zhouwei, as if probing his emotions. “Pure Qi is the source of all Qi and the foundation from which all spirits are born. The basis of cultivation lies in one’s spiritual aptitude. Moongaze Lake was once a place where spiritual energy was severed, devoid of any sign of Pure Qi, making it naturally difficult for spiritual aptitude to manifest. Your family’s rise coincided with the spiritual meridian’s revival. In truth, it was a matter of natural course!”

Uncertain how much of this was genuine, Li Zhouwei sighed. “This foundation lies in our bloodline, but without senior’s help, our ancestor would have had nothing to build upon! He often spoke of you before he passed, lamenting that he did not know your whereabouts. Otherwise, he would have brought his sons to express their gratitude in person. That would have been a fine thing…”

“To gain three from four… also a rare feat.” Having said this, Yang Tianya offered no further response, simply smiling as he drank his tea.

Li Zhouwei turned his attention to Yang Ruiyi and offered a congratulatory remark. “Congratulations!”

Yang Ruiyi was already smiling. “My Yang clan has been blessed with a True Qi Qilin-child. Things are going smoothly, a truly joyous occasion… However… it hardly compares to your renowned reputation, Daoist. There is still much we must rely on you for.”

Li Zhouwei took a sip of tea, appearing quite at ease. “You are too kind, Daoist,” he said, shaking his head. “Your esteemed clan has hidden its strength so deeply; this junior is truly impressed! As for relying on me, I am unworthy of such a thing!”

After the hollow pleasantries were exchanged, Yang Ruiyi chuckled. “My clan has had a few fortuitous encounters, but we are nothing compared to the likes of the Profound Governance Pavilion. Our power is weak. How could you be unworthy? In the future, we will have matters to work on together, so we should communicate more often.”

Li Zhouwei understood immediately.

‘So they don’t have absolute authority. Not only that, but they are lacking by a considerable margin… It seems the one valued by the Underworld is that Judge Yang, not the entire Yang family!’

Yang Ruiyi’s words were tactful. Saying they were “nothing compared to the Profound Governance Pavilion” was a veiled way of stating their position. The Yang Clan was analogous to the Profound Governance Pavilion; just as the Pavilion represented Luoxia’s will, the Yang Clan was merely an agent upholding the Underworld’s interests.

On the surface, this seemed standard, but the implications of this admission were significant.

‘People often say the Profound Governance Pavilion is Luoxia’s dog. A dog is still a dog. It can throw its weight around at the foot of the mountain, but it has no place at the summit. It can be ordered about at will but can never truly be a part of Luoxia… If the Yang Clan corresponds to the Profound Governance Pavilion, then that is not a comfortable position to be in!’

‘This is exactly why the Yue State fell into such a state back then!’

‘Besides the Profound Governance Pavilion, Luoxia also has the Seven Ministers. So, what other families serve the Underworld?’
