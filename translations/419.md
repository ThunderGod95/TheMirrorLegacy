# Chapter 554: The Hornless and True Dragon

Li Xuanfeng led the group across Lake Xian, finally arriving at the coastal waters. The waves surged as the sea stretched in endless blue, and Ning Dingbo, the elder Ning brother, stepped forward to gather the disciples.

Once the Azure Pond disciples had assembled, Ning Dingbo flashed a smile, revealing his white teeth as he explained, "This area is called the Shallow Sea... The water here is not very deep; it got submerged during the great battles of ancient times. Most of the islands you see now were once immortal mountains, while the remaining few were later transported here to fill the sea."

Li Xuanfeng stood with his hands behind his back, listening silently. Understanding his nature, Ning Dingbo continued with the introduction on his behalf, "In those days, this area was home to the six most densely populated southern prefectures, all of which were swallowed by the sea... leaving ruins beneath the waves. Since the water is shallow, cultivators have already scoured it clean over the years."

Ning Dingbo continued to explain patiently, "If you travel further, toward the Scarlet Pristine Sea and the Qunyi Gorge, you will reach what was once the Eastern Sea... Dragon Palaces cover the landscape, with flood dragons and serpents roaming freely. Going deeper, you will encounter many dragon kin; do not offend them!"

The disciples reacted with mixed expressions. Those dressed in fine robes seemed unaffected, already familiar with this knowledge, while the more simply dressed disciples looked enlightened.

Ning Dingbo continued, "The Scarlet Pristine Sea was named after the eighth child of the True Hornless Dragon, which involves the ancient Pristine Converging Water. The sea is filled with demons and treasures, most of which are controlled by the dragon kin. If you go in, proceed with caution."

A young man with a finely tailored robe and slender brows suddenly spoke up, respectfully asking, "May I ask, Instructor, why is it that... while the ruling beings here are of the dragon kin and hold the Converging Water Fruition Attainment, it is referred to as the True Hornless Dragon? Why not call it the Hornless Dragon?"

"Well..." Ning Dingbo hesitated, casting a reluctant glance at Li Xuanfeng before shaking his head, replying gravely, "That is an ancient matter... few would know the answer."

The group looked slightly disappointed, but then Li Xuanfeng stepped forward and spoke softly, "If not for the Pristine Converging Water, the True Hornless Dragon would have become a True Dragon."

Having spent years in the Southern Border, Li Xuanfeng had come across one or two of these ancient secrets.

He knew that Li Chejing had fallen victim to an old flood dragon in the Southern Border, so whenever he encountered snake or flood dragon-type demons in battle, he always tried to capture them alive and interrogate them for any information about the old flood dragon.

This old flood dragon, a well-known demon king in the Southern Border, was named Cen Lufu and cultivated the divine ability of Pristine Water. Supposedly also of dragon kin, Li Xuanfeng himself had harbored the same question as the young disciple, and he had eventually uncovered the answer through careful questioning.

As he began to speak, the young disciples looked up to him in admiration. The refined young man appeared somewhat bashful as he respectfully requested, "Daoist, may I trouble you for your explanation..."

Li Xuanfeng replied softly, "The True Hornless Dragon dominated the Eastern Sea, achieving Fruition Attainment for hundreds of years, and reportedly reached the peak of the Dao Embryo Realm. It believed itself to be the most perfect creature under Heaven, and called itself the Demon Emperor, establishing the Eastern Sea Demon Palace."

"It journeyed westward until it reached a small mountain temple and encountered an Immortal Lord..." Li Xuanfeng continued, "The True Hornless Dragon asked, Is there any creature under Heaven with a form more perfect than my own? The Immortal Lord replied, The dragon kin rise and fall in size, soaring through the universe, diving beneath waves, and transforming with the times. You are merely a demon dragon; you must transform into a true dragon."

Li Xuanfeng paused, then continued softly, "The Hornless Dragon carefully questioned the Immortal Lord about the characteristics of true dragon kin, then returned to the Eastern Sea, gathering forces and consuming a feathered serpent."

"With two Fruition Attainments in one body, it was impossible to manage both Converging Water and Pristine Water simultaneously. It eventually met a hasty end, its powers divided among its nine offspring, throwing the Eastern Sea into turmoil and an era of extreme chaos."

Li Xuanfeng gazed into the distance, a hint of reverence in his voice as he added quietly, "Only then did the world's demons understand the difference between the Hornless and True Dragon, as well as those between flood dragons, snakes, and vipers‚Äîknowledge that later spread from the Dragon Palace itself."

"The Hornless Dragon may have been devoured by its nine offspring, but its descendants now call themselves dragon kin and have established the Eastern Sea Serpent Dragon Palace."

As Li Xuanfeng finished relating the story, not only were the disciples in awe, but even the Ning brothers were hearing this for the first time, marveling at the tale.

Li Xuanfeng shook his head.

"It is just a tale spun from the mouth of a mere snake; take it as a story for entertainment."

"Thank you, Daoist, for your teaching!" the disciples said in unison as they respectfully offered their thanks.

Li Xuanfeng waved it off, his eyes glinting with a cold light as he stared at the shadow approaching on the northern wind, murmuring, "Speak of the devil... here they come!"

Indeed, two streaks of light approached in the distance, one large and one small. The creature in the lead was snake-like, with a twin-hooked tail in a pale white hue, trailing a streak of blood across the sky. The one following closely behind it was nearly twice as large and was covered in bluish-gray scales, with a body resembling a tiger's but with an unusually elongated torso and belly, gliding in a prowling stance.

The bluish-gray creature had four strong legs, with an elongated torso and a long tail trailing behind, giving it an unusual appearance. It followed the white snake ahead of it with an air of ease, almost like a cat toying with a mouse.

Ning Dingbo glanced over and quickly directed his brother to steer the jade ship further away, lowering his voice as he said, "That is a dragon scion... Quickly move away... Do not disturb it."

Li Xuanfeng studied the scene closely. The creature in front seemed to be of the feathered serpent clan, with a twin-hooked tail. It was likely a hooked serpent.

Its scales were broken, blood that was a pale blue hue dripped from its body, and its window-sized eyes were filled with despair, emitting pitiful howls.

"It looks like it has been injured by Converging Water! Even if it escapes, it will not live much longer..."

Everyone watched, entranced, as the Ning brothers hastened to put distance between them and the scene. Yet, they could not help but look back in curiosity as the dragon scion closed in on the white hooked serpent, delaying the kill to toy with it instead.

Ning Dingbo's expression shifted slightly, muttering a quiet curse and silently quickening their pace, thinking to himself, Truly typical of dragon kin... The Converging Water lineage loves playing such games... Regardless of kin, they always have to test each other.

The group of cultivators watched the scene with rapt attention, awestruck, as the hooked serpent wailed miserably. After a few breaths, a faint green rain began to fall from the sky.

The rain was translucent and a delicate shade of blue-greenish hue. Though its color was light, it drenched the area and cast the world into a misty haze.

A finely dressed young disciple activated his mana to shield himself, remarking, "This is the vision of a fallen Converging Water Foundation Establishment Realm... So this is the Eastern Sea, where a Foundation Establishment Realm expert can fall on any stretch of ocean just like that."

Li Xuanfeng, meanwhile, was reflecting on the aura and appearance of the dragon scion they had just seen, thinking to himself, Indeed, they are unique. The dragon kin of the Eastern Sea must have various spells at their disposal; defeating them would likely be no easy task... If I could lure one into a wide enough sea area, perhaps I could exhaust it to death.

Naturally, he would not provoke a dragon kin, but he was calculating the strength of both sides, forming a solid understanding of the two.

Ning Dingbo moved a step closer and whispered, "Boss, I doubt that dragon scion's appearance here is just a coincidence; it is likely here to see who Azure Pond has sent to oversee Splitreed Island."

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly. His task was not only to escort but also to stay on the island for a year or so to manage affairs. Splitreed Island's situation was complicated, so a dragon scion's curiosity was understandable.

As one of the largest markets in the sea and one of the most prominent immortal islands, Splitreed Island housed many natural resources. Its unusual terrain made it difficult to set up formations, leading to constant unrest.

And for reasons unknown, Purple Mansion Realm cultivators rarely appeared in the area. Each sect avoided assigning a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator for oversight, relying mostly on Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

Li Xuanfeng gave his assent. Soon, the majestic island appeared before them as the Ning brothers introduced the island's background while steering the ship down toward the water.

About ten li from Splitreed Island, a massive light shield shimmered across the seabed. Li Xuanfeng produced a jade token and guided them through the barrier.

The scene below was indeed radiant, with houses of all sizes nestled within the shimmering barrier. As the Ning brothers docked the jade ship, a cultivator approached them on a gust of wind.

Dressed in a green robe, the approaching man's storage pouch and sword glinted in the sun. His cloak was made of spirit silk, his robe of spirit cloth, and even the jade adorning him was of the highest grade‚Äîtruly extravagant. He glanced at Li Xuanfeng and nodded, greeting, "Brother-in-law."

This man was Ning Heyuan, his wife's younger brother and the authority over the market on the island. With early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation, he was not unfamiliar to Li Xuanfeng, who gave him a brief nod in acknowledgment.

Ning Heyuan was of the main Ning Family line, but he had been taken in by the Chi Family at a young age and returned to the Ning Family only upon reaching adulthood. His position in the Ning Family leaned more toward the Chi lineage.

However, with Chi Wei's death and Daoist Master Yuan Su relocating to Yi Mountain City, many of the Ning Family had shifted their focus to the southern territories. Even though Chi Zhiyun was the sect leader, he dared not give orders to a senior like Yuan Su, who now acted independently in the Southern Border without taking directives or heeding summons.

This slight rift between the Ning and Chi families had placed Ning Heyuan in an awkward position. Li Xuanfeng had met him once more than ten years ago when he had been quite boastful. However, after hiding out at sea for over a decade, he now seemed far more subdued in character.

Bringing along several guest cultivators for introductions, Ning Heyuan quickly assigned tasks to the disciples and then pulled Li Xuanfeng aside, saying, "Brother-in-law... this is my first time working with you directly. If there is anything I overlook, please guide me."

Li Xuanfeng found his attitude somewhat unexpected and gave a polite nod. Ning Heyuan led him to his cave dwelling, explaining that he needed to meet with some of the disciples before departing. Meanwhile, Li Xuanfeng wrote a letter and handed it to the elder Ning brother to be delivered to the Li Family.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Great Jueting.

This was an ancient city, grand and majestic. At its height, it had a population of a hundred thousand, but under Fu Daimu's rule for several decades, only about ten thousand remained. Fei Luoya had reclaimed it and, after years of nurturing, had restored the population to thirty or forty thousand.

The stone bricks of the old city were mottled with the marks of time, and Li Family soldiers hurried through the narrow streets. The Mount Yue townsfolk hid inside their houses, peeking out with hope in their eyes.

Just as the people of Eastern Mount Yue envied the prosperous lives of the Easterners, the inhabitants of Great Jueting longed for the affluence of Eastern Mount Yue. Having heard of the Li Family's reputation, they now eagerly anticipated the Li Family's takeover.

Clan cultivators and Jade Court Guards patrolled the skies while Li Xicheng rode the wind with his younger brother Li Xijun by his side. They both studied a map, deep in discussion.

"The Liu and Xu families cannot be allowed on new lands... As for those from the prestigious family, it would be best to restrict them and promote common families to settle along the western lakes and establish villages."

Fei Luoya had chosen to take a hands-off approach, handing over his territory to the Li Family before entering secluded cultivation. The Li Family had sent people to inspect the area twice, discovering that it was divided into two major sections.

One part was Mount Yue's grand city of Great Jueting, a rare ruin with a vast expanse, while the other was a fertile plain with no significant mountains.

The Li Family focused their efforts on the ancient city of Great Jueting, an old and distinguished place within Mount Yue, second only to Mount Wu. Li Yuanjiao had visited it once, but his attention had been consumed with dividing the spoils of war, so he had not been able to take a closer look.

As the two juniors explored, they found it rich in age-old elegance. The palace walls still bore many murals, though most had been damaged by years of warfare. Some still depicted scenes of cataclysms, darkness, and despair.

Li Xijun stepped inside, admiring the artwork. The recent murals depicted the rise of the Li Family, the east bursting with blossoms and the brightness of flames atop oil.

But, as he moved deeper, the murals took on a bleaker tone, showing fields overrun with locusts, drought in every direction, foreign invasions, and the death of the king... Li Xijun paused to look, then turned back and commented, "This must be the legendary Jianixi."

The two brothers continued through the palace halls, passing one scene after another of the heavens collapsing and landscapes withering, only to later reach depictions of people thriving and living in abundance.

The later murals were worn beyond recognition, but after searching for a while, they found another complete one.

This mural depicted a figure dressed in black whose face was obscured. In one hand, they held an object resembling a book, while in the other, a staff. Many people were painted kneeling before this figure, while beside them, a sun hung in the sky, casting its light downward.

"That must be Duanmu Kui..."

Both Li Xicheng and Li Xijun were familiar with their family's history and many recorded stories. Li Xijun remarked, "Duanmu Kui dominated his era, even daring to suppress the gates of Azure Pond Sect... but in the end, he could not break through to the Golden Core realm. And... that immortal text he possessed vanished without a trace, with no clues left to its whereabouts."

"As for the sun..." Li Xijun paused, then sighed, "Perhaps it has something to do with the Wei-Li lineage."

He had complex feelings about Wei-Li. Many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, including some Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, had assumed that the Li Family was of the direct line of Wei-Li. Li Xuanfeng had passed along information, and Li Xijun had done his own research, forming some theories.

Daoist Master Yuan Su believed our family to be of Wei-Li blood. If the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' divine abilities are accurate, then we are indeed descended from Wei-Li... which explains the family's numerous connections to monks. But as for whether we are direct descendants... that is hard to say...

Li Xijun knew the truth about his family. Despite the recent streak of exceptional Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, he understood that it was not due to their bloodline.

The Li Family's rapid cultivation progress was primarily due to the talisman seeds each main branch member possessed, which accelerated their cultivation speed. They had also received multiple boosts from talismans and a talisman pill, creating an aura of distinction around them.

Piecing these insights together, Li Xijun quickly came to a conclusion, Our family is likely a side branch of Wei-Li, merely appearing as direct descendants due to the support of these immortal artifacts, thus attracting such complex connections.

As he pondered these thoughts, he gazed at the grand and unadorned palace, then stopped and turned around abruptly.

"Elder Brother, I will return for now; the rest is in your hands."

Li Xicheng, puzzled but compliant, nodded, while Li Xijun took to the wind and rode swiftly back to Mount Qingdu, entering the ancestral shrine. Activating the protective formation, he stepped into the hidden chamber.

The altar of cold iron emitted a faint glow, carved with osmanthus patterns that added a mysterious, serene air. Li Xijun bowed deeply and spoke with respect, "I, Xijun, the descendant of the Li Family, humbly request the mirror to pierce through the mysteries, perceive the hidden truth, and illuminate all directions, capturing spirits and discerning the divine..."

Li Xijun had observed the supposedly ordinary Great Jueting, which, despite the multiple inspections by Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, seemed to reveal nothing remarkable. He thought to himself, The Immortal Mirror should reveal something different.
