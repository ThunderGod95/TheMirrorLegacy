# Chapter 405: Mansion Water Immortal Official

Azure Pond Sect.

Azure Pond Peak was enveloped in swirling clouds and mist. Within the cave dwelling on the mountain, a dark golden bell with intricate patterns hung in the center. It was only rung upon the death of a Daoist Master or the ascension of a sect master.

Chi Zhiyun landed on the peak hurriedly, followed by a group of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. As soon as he landed, a tall young man approached, cupping his fist in greeting.

"Sect Master!"

"Hejing."

Chi Zhiyun waved his hand urgently, not stopping, and stepped into the stone cave, asking, "How is it?"

"The flame is dim and turned bright white... The lamp oil is rising, the nine lines are flickering. This has never happened before." Ning Hejing's voice was grave.

Chi Zhiyun's expression grew increasingly grim as he muttered, "Bright white...? How could that be?!"

He dismissed the others and quickly stepped deeper into the cave dwelling. Several soul lamps rested on lotus seats carved from wood, burning quietly.

The wood sculpture was made from Soul-Tuning Mulberry Wood, which could foretell blessings and disasters, was impervious to the five elements, and feared only thunder. The lamp oil used Nine Refined Soul Essence, once a precious treasure was now no longer particularly valued.

Chi Zhiyun focused his gaze, and indeed, Daoist Master Buzi's flame was noticeably smaller. It has changed from a pale gray to bright white, with the patterns on the lamp base interweaving between dark and light.

Only Chi Zhiyun and Ning Hejing were in the cave, both looking grim. Ning Hejing spoke in a low voice, "I have already inquired; the Daoist Master left the sect earlier without leaving any message."

Chi Buzi was Chi Zhiyun's great-grandfather, and Chi Zhiyun's lineage was the maternal family of Ning Hejing's branch. The two grew up together, their interests closely intertwined, making them almost like real brothers.

As soon as Chi Zhiyun became sect master, Ning Hejing was appointed as the peak master of Yuanxing Peak, gaining significant influence within the sect. Now that there was an issue with Chi Buzi, he was naturally worried.

"Do Daoist Masters Yuanwu and Yuan Xiu know of this?" Chi Zhiyun blurted out suddenly.

Ning Hejing shook his head and replied, "Rest assured, Clan Brother. I have sealed off this information immediately. The two disciples guarding the lamps are trusted members and will not leak this news. As of now, only Daoist Master Yuan Su is aware."

"Good." Chi Zhiyun praised him and speculated in a low voice, "Now that devil cultivators are running rampant, without the Man On Creek, they cannot be contained. Xiao Chuting is trapped in the Eastern Sea, and the Daoist Master must have gone to find him."

Chi Zhiyun tapped the edge of the table anxiously and muttered, "Could it be Zhang Tianyuan? What is his Golden Feather Sect thinking? Do they not fear ruining things?!"

"That is not necessarily so!"

A clear voice echoed through the cave.

Chi Zhiyun and Ning Hejing both relaxed, respectfully stepping aside as they greeted the newcomer.

"Welcome, Daoist Master."

Daoist Master Yuan Su, dressed in green, his robe looser with a small white seal at his waist and a slightly rounded face, spoke softly, "Zhang Qiushui of Golden Feather Sect has mastered the Moistening Radiant Lead life divine ability, which can also attract these devil cultivators... just not as effectively as Man On Creek or Heavy Murk. The matter of the True Monarch is crucial; it will not be entirely entrusted to the three of us."

Chi Zhiyun and Ning Hejing both bowed their heads respectfully. Daoist Master Yuan Su continued, "However, without at least five or six Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, it is impossible to detain Buzi. Zhang Tianyuan cannot orchestrate such a formation; at most, he would cause Buzi some trouble."

Daoist Master Yuan Su appeared unconcerned, smiling as he continued, "Buzi is just like my senior brother was in life, now having reached the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. Over the decades, he has become arrogant and conceited, yet also inherently greedy... Though he is calculating, it is rare for him to suffer setbacks. It will not be a problem!"

Chi Zhiyun and Ning Hejing, not daring to interrupt, shrank back like quails. After a moment, they finally suggested, "Daoist Master, maybe you should deduce it..."

They only dared to ask due to Daoist Master Yuan Su's mild temperament. Daoist Master Yuan Su merely shrugged and replied, "He is cautious, leaving no traces in the Great Void, and his cultivation is high. I possess the divine abilities of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, not the fate-determining power of a Maha... what could I use to deduce?"

He shook his head and joked, "If he is dead and his divine abilities dissipate, I might be able to deduce something."

Chi Zhiyun and Ning Hejing exchanged glances, clearly not amused. Daoist Master Yuan Su shrugged, reached out to trace the air in front of him, and stepped into the Great Void, his voice still echoing in their ears.

"He most likely got caught up in something while rescuing Xiao Chuting in the Eastern Sea. I will go check it out."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Lu Jiangxian's divine sense was even more formidable than expected, forcefully entering Chi Buzi's sea of consciousness, and disorienting his soul. Chi Buzi, being from an immortal sect with considerable experience, quickly realized he was facing a highly skilled cultivator.

Activating a secret technique, he gathered his spiritual sense and called out, "I am a disciple under the Pristine Water Origin Talisman True Monarch... I do not know which senior is before me, but if I have offended you, please forgive me!"

Despite being several hundred years old and seasoned, Chi Buzi was not intimidated by Lu Jiangxian's overwhelming presence. He observed closely and discerned that Lu Jiangxian was all bluster. If it were not for his high intrinsic rank, Chi Buzi would not have felt threatened.

He spoke politely while thinking to himself, This old man appears to be an ancient cultivator who has fallen on hard times... if I could kill him, the rewards would definitely elevate me to greatness!

Lu Jiangxian, however, remained silent, his divine sense ruthlessly overwhelming Chi Buzi. Although Chi Buzi's spiritual sense was not as strong, he had a large quantity of it, and he resisted stubbornly, continuing to shout out, "May I know which metallic essence the senior cultivate?"

No matter how Chi Buzi inquired, Lu Jiangxian did not respond, relentlessly pursuing him. Chi Buzi had not anticipated that Lu Jiangxian's divine sense would be so unyielding, causing him to retreat repeatedly.

After about an incense stick's time, Chi Buzi began to grow anxious.

"Senior, be cautious... I am known to the True Monarch, and if something happens to me, it will surely alarm him!"

Ignoring him, Lu Jiangxian continued his aggressive assault, finally grabbing him tightly as he sighed with relief, If this were within the world of the mirror, eliminating him would be a matter of a single thought... but here in his Shenyang Mansion, it took so much effort!

Seeing Chi Buzi still struggling, Lu Jiangxian made up his mind. Using the backlash from the Yin Quarters Nine Hills Heart Questioning Spell, he began to read Chi Buzi's memories.

Just as he had this thought, Lu Jiangxian felt uneasy, and a clear pool appeared hazily before his eyes, startling him.

"Of course, there is still the Pristine Water!"
ùïóùï£ùêûùêûùòÑùêûùöãùöóùóºùòÉùó≤ùóπ.ùöåùï†ùöñ

He was in Chi Buzi's sea of consciousness; not within his own mirror world. Lu Jiangxian knew that reading Chi Buzi's memories would alert the True Monarch of the Azure Pond Sect...

I can't kill him... Since I can't erase his memories, I'll plant a shamanic spell in his spiritual sense!

Lu Jiangxian waved his hand, condensing the dense moonlight and setting up a backlash monitoring spell. He reluctantly extracted a string of talisman qi.

I'll tie you to my boat so you can't go running to Pristine Water to tattle!

After setting up several layers of precautions to ensure that Chi Buzi would be utterly destroyed if the spell activated, Lu Jiangxian had a sudden inspiration. He used his divine sense to bring forth an object.

This was a piece extracted from the soul of Maha Jinlian, purified numerous times by Lu Jiangxian's moonlight. It was now blank and shining white.

A bold idea arose in Lu Jiangxian's mind, almost making him quiver with excitement.

Why not... replace him with a substitute... make him one of my own...

After careful consideration, Lu Jiangxian shook his head. Chi Buzi, after all, was associated with Pristine Water. If the sect discovered something was amiss upon his return, it would spell disaster for Lu Jiangxian.

Then a compromise‚Äîcreate a friend out of him!

He took the glowing orb and embedded it with fabricated memories, including various exalted immortals and immortal courts from past lives, checking everything thoroughly.

Satisfied with his work, he also altered the shamanic spell in Chi Buzi's Shenyang Mansion, linking it to the soul fragment of Maha Jinlian. After reviewing it, he was extremely pleased with his handiwork.

"It's flawless!"

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

On Mount Lijing.

The continuous sound of blood tears falling from Chi Buzi's body had stopped, leaving an eerie silence that made even the faintest sound audible.

"Hmm..."

Daoist Master Buzi pushed open the door and stumbled forward, a strange smile on his face. He leaned against the doorframe, taking another step out.

Buzi!

Li Yuanjiao's mind was racing with alarm bells.

The Daoist Master in green robes stepped forward, his eyes closed, the blood tears having ceased. Buzi then exhaled deeply, stiffly turning his head toward the members of the Li Family.

Li Yuanjiao felt his legs go numb and a chill run down his spine, raising the hair on the back of his neck.

At that moment, Buzi's face was divided; one side was clean and sharp-featured, while the other side was distorted and covered in fine white fur with the muscles twitching slightly. His ears were elongated and drooped downward.

His eyelids moved slightly, and he slowly opened his eyes, revealing empty black sockets with bulging green veins around them, the red-purple eyelids struggling to open.

"G... Greetings, Daoist Master!" Li Yuanjiao's hoarse voice echoed in the courtyard.

Buzi stared blankly at him for several breaths before speaking, "What Daoist Master? I am an Immortal Official under the command of the Immortal Lord at the Mansion Water of Dangjiang Creek.... What era is this? Where is the Immortal Court? Which is the nearest Mansion Water?..."

Buzi took a moment to examine his body before exclaiming, "After waiting so long to obtain a Purple Mansion Realm body, why is it still a damn devil cultivator?! How can devil cultivators run rampant in broad daylight in this era?"

The Li Family stared at him, dumbfounded. Buzi looked at them impatiently and asked, "Are you recipients of the talisman? Which sect do you belong to?"

Li Yuanjiao was still processing Buzi's words when Buzi suddenly stepped back, muttering, "No, I need to find a Mansion Water and reclaim my immortal position!"

He shouted, "You little yellow hats, quickly open this broken formation before I break it with a single palm, making you cry all over the place!"

Li Yuanjiao, observing Buzi's behavior, felt a sudden jolt of fear in his heart as his mind raced with thoughts.

Could it be that Chi Buzi has been possessed by some being with Metallic Essence? This entity keeps talking about a Mansion Water; who knows how ancient it is... no wonder Chi Buzi looks so disheveled! But... why isn't this being using the Great Void to travel..?

Since Chi Buzi was possessed, Li Yuanjiao wanted this disaster to leave as soon as possible. He quickly deactivated the formation, revealing the dark night sky.

"Good! You little yellow hats are sensible!"

The Metallic Essence spirit was overjoyed and flew away like a shooting star, leaving a loud laugh behind.

"Visit my Mansion Water of Dangjiang Creek another day, and I will surely reward you with merit!"

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Chi Buzi then left the Li Family, flying south. As Lu Jiangxian's residual power waned, his expression grew increasingly bizarre. He suddenly stopped, shouting aloud, "What Metallic Essence fiend is this?!"

As soon as he spoke, he became furious and slapped himself on the face with incredible force, shouting, "Audacious! The Daoist Lord is an Immortal Official of the Mansion Water of Dangjiang Creek, not some fiend!"

Chi Buzi was shocked, raising his hand to press against his Shenyang Mansion. Halfway through the motion, his hand stopped in mid-air, as if struggling against an invisible force. Chi Buzi warned, "I am a disciple under the Pristine Water True Monarch, you fiend... stop this! I will find you a good body!"

"Body? I want yours!"

The soul remnant left by Lu Jiangxian, infused with Maha Jinlian's personality, was chaotic and unruly, spewing profanities endlessly.

But Chi Buzi ignored him, focusing on controlling his hand toward his Shenyang Mansion. As the original owner of the body and a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, he was slowly gaining the upper hand.

Seeing itself losing, the immortal official laughed coldly, and a bright spell mark rose within Chi Buzi's soul.

Try moving again! I'll detonate this spell and escape with Metallic Essence, then I'll see what you can do!

Chi Buzi looked down in disbelief, muttering, "How is this possible..?!"

What's impossible? What did you think I was doing when I took control of your body earlier? You can try, see if you can exterminate me faster than I can detonate this formation!

The immortal official, thinking it was a remnant of metallic essence, felt triumphant, no longer controlling Chi Buzi, allowing him to land by a stream.

It continued, I've waited in that yellow hat's mind for decades, finally using that Supreme Yin Moonlight to lure you! A pity that you're a devil cultivator... why didn't you hide properly instead of wandering around seeking death? I won't hold it against you devil cultivators as long as you take me to a Mansion Water and send me to the Immortal Court... maybe I'll even petition the Immortal Court to give you a chance at survival.

Chi Buzi suddenly laughed maniacally, angered. He immersed his spiritual sense into his Shenyang Mansion, cursing at the white glowing circle, "What nonsense! What Immortal Court? What Mansion Water?! You are full of ancient, unheard-of nonsense! What kind of era is this? Stupid... fool!"

He cursed angrily, then suddenly paused, greed rising in his heart.

Before him, several objects that were neither talismans nor seals, floated within the glowing circle, glowing dully. A sweet fragrance of fate, blood qi, and incense filled the air.

What... What is this?
