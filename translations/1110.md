# Chapter 1110: The Demon Body

A light snow, as fine as catkin fluff, drifted through the cold spring air. Below, the earth was a hazy expanse of yellow and white. A man in white, feathered robes sped onward with the wind, watching settlements of all sizes pass beneath his feet across the flat plains.

This land lay north of the Prefectures governed by the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. Beyond an ancient city wall rose a magnificent citadel. Its myriad palaces were all built in hues of yellow and white, and banners of two colors—representing Profound Yellow Qi—fluttered from every corner.

Its name was Shengle.

The city's history was ancient. It was originally the territory of the Touba Xianbei. Their ancestor, Touba Xige Yi, first settled this land. Only after Touba Changming received the surname 'Yuan' and was granted rewards by the Wei state did this city truly rise, remaining a towering presence to this day.

Touba Ci had ridden the wind to this spot, the very edge of the traditional Xia frontiers. This land was not ruled by the Great Zhao, but was instead the domain of his Touba clan: the State of Dai. Shengle still served as its capital.

He descended into a great hall adorned with the Profound Yellow Qi banners. A cultivator immediately came forward to pay respects. Touba Ci, his face a mask of impatience, asked,

"How much longer until we can enter?"

The cultivator, whose cultivation was clearly not low, was nonetheless deferential. He bowed quickly.

"The grotto-heaven's Profound Foundation has only shifted six-tenths of the way and is just now aligning with the Gloom position. It will be some time yet..."

Touba Ci let out a breath, his expression remaining dark.

The death of Vast Cicada had little impact on Touba Ci. The reason he had rushed all the way from Jianghuai to Mobei was something else entirely:

The Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body.

Li Zhouwei's Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body wasn't particularly strong, and it didn't look as though it had been nourished with much blood-food. While the Dao lineage of Profound Qi was now only prominent within the Touba clan, it had been widespread in ancient times. If Li Zhouwei had truly stumbled upon the technique in some forgotten corner, it wouldn't have been _that_ surprising.

But Touba Ci could never mistake the familiar aura radiating from that Dharma Body. He knew with chilling certainty—Li Zhouwei was cultivating _their_ family's specific version.

This was a terrifying prospect. After his initial shock, Touba Ci had immediately feigned nonchalance, his heart sinking. He had lost all interest in the remainder of the battle, his mind consumed by suspicion.

The Touba clan's inheritance was sealed within their grotto-heaven, Shengle Heaven, which had been isolated from the world for years. The rare instances when it was opened to receive someone were conducted with extreme secrecy, aided by an ancestral Dharma Treasure that prevented all communication with the outside world. The techniques for these Dharma Body divine abilities were hidden _within_ that Dharma Treasure. It was impossible for them to have been stolen!

He fell silent for a moment before asking,

"Has my father returned?"

The cultivator nodded repeatedly.

"Yes... Lord Wei has arrived."

Touba Ci had only asked in passing. This was an unexpected development. Somewhat surprised, he quickly straightened his robes, strode forward, and pushed open the doors to the main hall. Sure enough, two men were seated at the head of the room.

The one on the left wore white and had an extraordinary air. The one on the right, dressed in black, looked solemn. A chessboard lay between them, black and white pieces locked in a fierce battle.

Touba Ci laughed heartily and strode inside.

"Lord Wei! What a fine day for a leisurely game!"

Wei Xuanyin glanced at him. Before he could speak, the man in black shot Touba Ci a look and chuckled.

"You brat... I trust you've learned there's always someone stronger out there?"

Touba Ci immediately played along. Whatever gloom he felt was masked by an air of easygoing acceptance.

"It was incredible! Absolutely incredible! That White Qilin cleaved Vast Cicada in two with a single strike!"

The father and son put on their little show, but Wei Xuanyin didn't seem annoyed. He simply shook his head with a faint smile.

"It has been many years, Daoist Friend Qiye. You are now a man who has stepped across the threshold of Purple Mystery. Why resort to such theatrics? It seems my time overseeing Profound Governance has made us grow distant."

Wei Xuanyin's words made the man—Touba Qiye—laugh as well. As the biological brother of the current King of Dai, his status was immense, and with his divine abilities having advanced, he no longer felt he had to fear Wei Xuanyin.

"And Lord Wei isn't heartbroken? The Tao family... they're just going to let this go?"

Wei Xuanyin, pinching a white stone, replied,

"I warned him three times. The Tao family was present for the first two. The last time, he still insisted on returning to Jiangbei, so I let him be. I thought I might have a fourth chance, but it seems I've waited too long. As for being heartbroken... I am not the one who should be."

He continued, "The Tao family still felt some connection to him. They might cause trouble for Lanyan. But you expect them to seek vengeance for a disciple who abandoned them to join the Buddhists? The Tao clan has held itself to a righteous standard for too long. They won't do such a thing."

Touba Qiye understood.

"Does this mean the matter is dropped? Surely the Great Adoration Dharma Realm will at least make a sound?"

Wei Xuanyin placed a piece.

"Fachang has been sent out again... The meaning is clear. The Great Adoration Dharma Realm has no immediate solution. The situation in Jianghuai... they and Mount Dayang have also begun to pull back, waiting for an opportunity. In any case, the business with the Way of Great Desire is wrapping up."

Touba Qiye shook his head and sighed. Wei Xuanyin looked past him, his gaze settling on Touba Ci.

"I came this time because I have a question for you, Daoist Friend."

Touba Ci stiffened. Suddenly, the Great Daoist Master's features sharpened, his calm, watery eyes staring straight through him.

"You fought him personally. The demon body on King Wei... does it belong to your noble clan's Dao lineage?"

The question struck like a boulder thrown into a placid lake, sending a chill through Touba Ci. The words were too sharp, and for a moment, he dared not speak.

Only after the man in black—his father—gave a slight nod did Touba Ci answer, his voice tight with reluctance.

"Reporting to you, my lord. It is... the Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body!"

He had been intentionally vague, but Wei Xuanyin's expression, while not fierce, held an unyielding, tranquil authority.

"I am curious. How did your clan's highest Dao lineage fall into his hands?"

Touba Ci's eyes narrowed.

"My lord, you are not the only one who wishes to investigate! Otherwise, this Daoist Master would not have rushed back from Jianghuai to the Northern Lands!"

Touba Qiye, seeing Wei Xuanyin's expression darken, sensed where this was going. He quickly interjected in a low voice,

"The Touba clan's Dark-Soul Mara is not of the same origin as the current Great Pass Azure-Soul. The Lesser Yang Demon Monarch himself cultivated the Great Pass Azure-Soul Dharma Body."

"While the 'Dark Flame Mara' Dharma Body is one of our clan's fundamental arts, it was an accidental acquisition by the Martial Emperor before he achieved the Dao... Other versions have spread throughout the world. How can you be so certain our Touba clan secretly gifted him _our_ method?"

"Certain?" Wei Xuanyin laughed coldly. "I know that version circulated. But after the Martial Emperor attained the Dao, did he not refine the art and establish a new inheritance? Your family's lineage is _different_ from that ancient Mara Dharma Body. The one he possesses is _your_ version. Why play these games with me?"

The two men froze, stunned that their secret techniques were known so clearly. The Great Daoist Master from the Profound Governance Pavilion stood up, pacing with his hands behind his back. His gaze turned icy.

"You two had best think clearly before you answer. This inquiry does not come from Profound Governance."

He stated quietly, "Xuanlou is here on orders."

It was rare for Wei Xuanyin to use the name Xuanlou.

In that instant, the color drained from Touba Qiye's face. A Great Daoist Master, a man of immense divine abilities among the world's pre-eminent cultivators, was visibly flustered. He took a step back, bowing his head.

"Qiye... I... I have only just learned of this," he pleaded. "I beg the Upper Emissary to be lenient... grant us some time..."

Touba Ci's reaction was just as swift. All pretense vanished, replaced by pure panic. He dropped to his knees simultaneously, pressing his forehead to the floor without a word.

A single name. In one breath, the dignity of Touba Qiye, of Touba Ci, of the entire Touba clan—descendants of the Liang, heirs of a True Monarch—was shattered, leaving not a shred behind.

Wei Xuanyin was not surprised. From his elevated position, he looked down.

"Since you've had time to think, speak."

Touba Qiye, after a moment's hesitation, gritted his teeth.

"Reporting to the Upper Emissary... this subordinate truly does not know. But why would my family help Bright Yang? Even if we wished to, why would we give him our fundamental art and let him parade it around? What benefit is that to the Touba? We must have been framed!"

His expression shifted.

"I fear the inheritance was stolen... But even so, even if he learned one or two levels of the Dharma Body, surely it isn't... _this_ serious?"

Wei Xuanyin knew that Touba Qiye, a Great Daoist Master, would not be truly convinced unless the full stakes were laid bare. He'd just think this was an overreaction.

"Not serious?" Wei Xuanyin said softly. "Profound Qi is the Ancient Demonic Dao. It is the _only_ Great Dao that stands equal to the paths of the Immortals and the Buddhists. You dare let such a thing fall into King Wei's hands? Lord Yao is already losing sleep over the possibility of him joining the Buddhists. Now we must worry about him joining the Demons?"

"We have heard King Wei may be cultivating the _fundamental_ art. Lord Yao was on the verge of coming out of seclusion himself over this!" Wei Xuanyin raised his eyebrows, his tone frigid.

"If I had not personally volunteered for this task, the one standing here now would be Yao Guanyi. And given his attitude toward your clan, Daoist Friend Qiye, you wouldn't be explaining anything at all."

The great hall fell silent. Touba Qiye kept his head bowed. After a long pause, Touba Ci stepped forward.

"The Dark-Soul Mara has three transformations. He has only shown the first, and it is still weak. Unless it is cultivated to its absolute peak, it cannot connect to the Great Dao of Profound Qi. It's... possible that during the Liang chaos a thousand years ago, a heart-method or two leaked out. But the remaining two transformations are locked within the imprint. They cannot be obtained without personal, physical contact. I ask the Upper Emissary to see the truth of this."

This was an explanation, but it was also a concession, a tacit acceptance of responsibility. Hearing it, Wei Xuanyin's expression softened fractionally. He waved a hand.

"It is precisely because I know these details that I volunteered, to give you a chance."

He paused.

"But telling _me_ isn't enough. I'm afraid, Daoist Friend, you will have to return with me to Profound Governance."

"Many thanks, Upper Emissary," Touba Qiye, silent for so long, finally spoke. He rose, shot Touba Ci a deep, meaningful glance, and then made a 'please' gesture for Wei Xuanyin to lead the way.

Just like that, they departed, one following the other, without time for another word.

Touba Ci remained, standing alone in the hall, his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles were white. His expression turned frigid.

'Who was it!'

His words had been a strategic ambiguity, a way to give both sides an exit. But the Touba family rules were ironclad. The clan's Dharma Treasure, the magical imprint, was still secure. Anyone who had ever received the art from the imprint was magically bound; they _could not_ write it down or transmit it to another. Not even the first transformation!

'The only way... is soul-searching. But the imprint is a Dharma Treasure... Who has that kind of power? A True Monarch? Would they even need to? One word from them could destroy my entire clan!'

A cold fear washed over him. He sat heavily in the main seat, staring blankly at the half-finished chess game.

'Could it be... they're just trying to scare us?'

But it had already happened. He had to consider the consequences.

'We've already handed over two Dharma Treasures. Wasn't that enough? Are they using this as an excuse to seize our clan's ancestral treasure imprint?'

The darkness in his eyes deepened. He stared south, toward the distant horizon, until a streak of Heavenly Glow, flashing past like a bird, seared his vision. Touba Ci lowered his head, eyes shut tight.

'Yao Guanyi…'

...

"Tenth year of the calendar, spring. The Touba clan entered Huai. King Wei led a strike against them. The Zhao general, Vast Cicada, launched a failed ambush. The armies clashed at Baixiang. A great victory. The heavens ran red, mountains fell. Vast Cicada died."

"At that time, the State of Song bordered the Heluo region."

The black ink lay starkly on the bamboo slip. The young man stared at the desk, utterly dumbfounded. A long moment passed before he finally murmured,

"Vast Cicada... died?"

_Huh?_

Vast Cicada was just... dead? Li Suining was speechless.

'What... What is this? Is this because of me?'

'I gave a single warning, and a dignified Fifth-Generation Maha was slain by His Majesty?!'

Who was Vast Cicada? He was the Great Adoration Dharma Realm's primary agent in Jiangbei. According to the history of his previous life, Vast Cicada should have only just been making his first major moves around this time. He was supposed to break through to the Sixth Generation and spend years countering the Way of Great Desire and the Dao of Compassion...

It wasn't that the man was immortal. In the original timeline, he was _still_ slain by King Wei, at a place called White Horse Mountain.

'I remember hearing that when he died, a great sun appeared in the sky and the Buddhist Land itself faltered. The Great Adoration Dharma Realm didn't even seem that sad, claiming he had gone to reincarnate and that his Dao was complete.'

In the end, he died, just with more fanfare.

But his dying _this_ early changed everything. Who could possibly replace him in Jianghuai? Could the Great Adoration Dharma Realm just find a second Li Jieyi?

Li Suining paced twice around his cave-residence, staring at the map again. A strange look crossed his face.

"Although... the overall situation hasn't changed much... the battle lines are almost identical to how they were before."

He was lost in thought when the door to his residence shimmered. A man in an ink-black robe strode inside. He glanced at the map on the desk and smiled.

"Did the news frighten you?"

Even though Li Zhouwei's tone was familiar, Li Suining's first instinct was still one of reverence. He hurried down from his platform.

"This subordinate greets Your Majesty!"

He bowed deeply before rising. Li Zhouwei waved him up. Li Suining replied,

"Vast Cicada's death... it's just, it's very early!"

"This King knows." Li Zhouwei smiled, clasping his hands behind his back. "This was a miscalculation on the part of the Dharma Masters. It is precisely because _your_ premonition was correct that his death feels early to you."

A thoughtful light flickered in his eyes.

"This isn't a bad thing, and it was unavoidable. But I came today because there is something I must ask you."

Li Suining raised an eyebrow. Li Zhouwei nodded.

"Do you know of the Heavenly Element?"

Li Suining frowned slightly and shook his head.

Li Zhouwei was silent for a long time. He hesitated, the words of Qingyu Qian echoing in his mind.

'Back then, that Liu Changdie visited the lake once and his connection to the Book of Elements was severed by the Azure Insight Origin Mirror. He went from being an anomaly only a True Monarch could sense to a beacon that drew the attention of all divine abilities... and the miracle upon him was stripped away.'

That was Qingyu Qian's explanation. But as Li Zhouwei studied Li Suining, a strange feeling rose again. Wasn't Li Suining just like Liu Changdie?

And yet... Li Suining had shown _no_ abnormality when faced with a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability!

That meant the Azure Insight Origin Mirror had _not_ stripped away the miracle he possessed.

'The Azure Insight Origin Mirror that the fox-kin can't control... it must be in the hands of the "Heavens" Above. And Suining must be carrying some failsafe from those same "Heavens," which is how he walked away from the mirror undetected!'
