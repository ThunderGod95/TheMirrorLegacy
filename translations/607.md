# Chapter 953: Junior

"Descendants." Daoist Master Tianwan muttered the word with a trace of mockery and said quietly, "So what if they are? What are descendants? Are they descendants because I watched them grow up and thus feel affection? Or because they revere me? None of that. I emerged from seclusion after breaking through, only to be greeted by a group of old men calling me ancestor... What does that have to do with me?"

Tanyun let out a sigh. He still held some lingering bond of master and servant in his heart, and tried to persuade her, "But blood ties can never truly be erased. Even if you feel no affection for them, they are at least closer than strangers..."

"Closer?" Daoist Master Tianwan spoke through gritted teeth, her voice full of fury and icy disdain, "I possess divine abilities! I can see directly into human hearts. I see their every thought with crystal clarity, Tanyun! The women think only of hating and envying me... What closeness is there to speak of! As for Guo Hong'er... and Guo Hongjian..."

Her expression grew even colder as a trace of cruelty rose. She spoke softly, "Fine... at least they weren't as stupid as Guo Hongyao. They knew I could read hearts, so they dared not think such things when facing me. But once I entered seclusion, they secretly indulged in lustful thoughts, fantasies of domination, and sordid repayment... What closeness could there possibly be!"

Tanyun was left speechless. He murmured, "This... this... But still!"

Daoist Master Tanyun truly didn’t know how to defend them anymore. Even Guo Shentong would have to bow his head in shame if he were here. He could only mutter, "After all, several hundred years have passed. It’s hard to expect any real familial bond... You are pure and untarnished, a stunning beauty among mortals cultivating a Dao of untouchable frost and snow... so they harbored filthy thoughts..."

His voice grew quieter as he spoke, and inwardly he wished he could drag those Guo bastards out and kill them all. Yet he still tried to reason with her, "My lady... the ancients once said, 'To glimpse a man's heart is to witness his demons.' Back then, cultivators who attained divine abilities feared visiting the mortal world, for a single glance with their divine ability would fill them with despair and rage... One's inner thoughts are the hardest to condemn... Who doesn’t harbor desires of lust and greed deep within?"

Daoist Master Tianwan merely gazed at him in silence. Her entire being exuded an aura of frost and snow, with only a faint trace of her elegant eyes visible. She spoke softly, "The old texts say that once the Life Divine Ability is mastered, one sees evil in all the world. That is why those of the Purple Mansion Realm are without emotion and slay without hesitation. It's because they see sin in every soul. I understand now."

Zongquan Island.

Li Qinghong and Kong Tingyun arrived at Zongquan Island by spirit boat. Li Zhouwei approached them aboard the Radiant Light and cupped his hands in greeting, "Greetings, ancestor!"

Seeing him brought a rare smile to Li Qinghong’s face as a gentle warmth bloomed in her expression. Li Zhouwei then turned to Kong Tingyun and offered her a cupped-hands salute, "Greetings, Senior!"

Kong Tingyun smiled and nodded, her round eyes examining him briefly before giving a slight nod of approval, thinking, Not bad...

Li Qinghong had never allowed Li Zhouwei to kneel in her own household, and had previously kept him from meeting outsiders for a reason. If he had failed to reach Foundation Establishment Realm, encountering Kong Tingyun, the Sect Master of Profound Peak, would not have warranted a simple salute. According to cultivation etiquette, he would have had to kneel.

Kong Tingyun was also sharp. Had he not bowed, she might have grown suspicious. But now that he had advanced to the Foundation Establishment Realm, both were cultivators of equal realm, so bowing was no longer required, thus avoiding unnecessary trouble.

Li Qinghong stepped aside with a smile and said, "Kong Tingyun, Sect Master of Profound Peak Gate, this is my family’s heir."

"I’ve long heard of your name!" Kong Tingyun looked at him for a moment before slowly averting her gaze. Though Li Zhouwei’s looks were merely above average, he possessed a charm that made it hard to look away. She chuckled inwardly, I’ve heard that the Wei's Li lineage is known for its beauty. No wonder, seeing Qinghong and Xijun is proof enough...

But Li Qinghong was wary of lingering too long, fearing unexpected mishaps, and thus said, "Let’s board the boat first."

The two women boarded back on the boat. With Kong Tingyun present, Li Zhouwei decided not to bring up the matter of Dingjiao. Once inside, Li Qinghong, visibly worried, asked, "How is Cheng’e doing?"

"He’s still in seclusion, no news so far..." Kongheng, standing nearby, answered in his stead.

After some small talk, Li Zhouwei got a better sense of Kong Tingyun’s temperament and finally asked, "Senior Kong... I’ve always had a question. Items like the Six Ding Merging Fire Token or the Six Xin Harmonising Metal Token seem to be part of a set. Where exactly did they come from?"

Kong Tingyun hesitated for a moment before replying, "These spirit artifacts are fairly well known. They’re likely connected to some Immortal Mansion, but I don’t know much beyond that..."

Her answer was vague, and was clearly lacking certainty. Sea winds howled outside the boat as the group continued heading north. After several days, they arrived at Yuezhou Island, home of the Profound Peak Gate.

This was the Kong Family’s ancestral stronghold. Kong Tingyun smiled and pointed north, saying, "I forgot to inform your family that the Golden Tang Gate has sealed its mountain and lost Golden Sack Island. It now belongs to our family."

"Congratulations!" Li Qinghong offered her congratulations. A disciple from the Profound Peak Gate came up with a message, which Kong Tingyun read carefully before speaking softly, "Daoist Master Zipei has truly fallen!"

Li Qinghong wasn’t well acquainted with the Daoist Master, but the deceased had a respectable reputation, so she sighed in response.

But Kong Tingyun chuckled, "She might not actually be dead."

Li Zhouwei raised his eyebrows and asked doubtfully, "Reincarnated?"

"Exactly." Kong Tingyun said in a low voice, "Do you all remember how the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators vanished for a time during the North-South conflict? It was because signs of Anhuai Heaven appeared within the great void, and among them were fragments of the Tianwu True Qi Divine Fiend Essence!"

Li Zhouwei’s heart trembled as something struck him like lightning, True Essence! The old ape also possessed True Essence... and his breakthrough happened around that same time!

The white ape’s breakthrough was one of the most unexpected events for the Li Family. His body was riddled with old injuries, many of which had damaged his foundation. Both Li Xicheng and Xiao Guiluan had far better chances of success, yet he alone had succeeded.

Thinking back now... it was truly a stroke of fortune! At that very time, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were fighting within the great void, and the appearance of the Tianwu True Qi Divine Fiend Essence allowed him to seize that celestial opportunity.

Li Zhouwei had long harbored doubts about the matter. Though he trusted the white ape, he had always suspected someone might have tampered with him in the past. Now, he felt much more at ease.

Across from him, Kong Tingyun continued, "The Metallic Essence was taken by Daoist Master Zipei. According to our family’s Daoist Master, possessing Metallic Essence allows one to reincarnate freely. She’s likely already slipped away."

Mount Wu.

Moongaze Lake’s Mount Wu was where spiritual energy was the most concentrated. However, at present, a grand formation had sealed it off completely, isolating all fluctuations of qi. White mist flowed down the jade steps of the mountain in thick, milky streams like liquid jade.

The blood pool at the summit had been transformed. Now, it held a small pile of spirit stones, and was soaked in gurgling spirit springs. Wisps of spiritual qi escaped the surface, flowing across the ancient jade floor.

Jade pillars stood in rows. Li Ximing, dressed in his Daoist robe, stood atop the tallest one. With each breath, dense spiritual qi gathered from all directions and flowed into his acupoints. He slowly opened his eyes and exhaled a stream of heavenly radiance. It glimmered brightly amidst the mist before vanishing.

A serene lantern lit up within his qi sea, floating above his Immortal Foundation. Its radiance flickered, illuminating everything within the qi sea.

"Heavenly Lantern—successfully refined!"

The Radiant Essence Scripture contained nine secret techniques: Yang Origin, Heavenly Lantern, Jewel Steps, Great Fissure, Reversal, Hundred Arms Arsenal, Imperial Edict, Golden Scales, and Red Cicada, each with its own unique ability. Through secluded cultivation and aided by the Huai River Map, Li Ximing had now refined the second one.

There was no denying Li Ximing’s astonishing talent. Just over sixty years old, and he had already mastered two secret techniques. Now that the Heavenly Lantern was refined, his Immortal Foundation underwent further transformation.

The method of Heavenly Lantern pierces through darkness and purifies the spirit platform, doubling efficiency in scripture reading and spell art cultivation...

Li Ximing was struck with sudden insight, It would be best to start with Heavenly Lantern. Even the simplest Yang Origin technique doesn’t take much time. Focusing on these two first was the right choice... But these secret techniques...

Li Ximing stared at the radiant lantern shimmering within his qi sea and thought to himself, These are truly exquisitely designed. Even among the three sects and seven gates, secret techniques of this caliber are exceedingly rare.

The more he practiced, the more he realized how precious these secret techniques were. Even the most basic Yang Origin contained mysteries that no other spell he had learned could rival.

Except for the immortal arts Reception Method and Sacrificial Ritual Method.

No one in the Li Family had ever understood these two arts. They showed no obvious profundity, produced no spiritual energy, and felt more like calling for rain. Somehow, repeating them simply... worked.

None of the Li Family’s other spell arts aside from those two even came close. Each time Li Ximing practiced one of the secret techniques, it felt like sailing through a vast, boundless ocean. It was so immersive he often forgot to return.

He exhaled deeply. After another half-month of stabilizing the Heavenly Lantern within the formation, he began cultivating the next spell. Suddenly, the formation flickered, and a small message appeared on the jade pillar.

Li Ximing picked it up and glanced over it, Reporting to the lord: The Xiao Family has come to visit. If you have emerged from seclusion, we humbly request your presence.

Li Ximing pondered for a moment. Since the message had been sent to him, it likely meant his aunt was not at home. The Xiao Family could not be neglected, so he ascended in a beam of light and soared out of Mount Wu.

He descended into the island’s main hall and saw that many people were already gathered there. His grand-uncle Li Xuanxuan stood smiling to one side, while the white ape stood on the other like a stone statue.

A middle-aged man with a kindly face and graying temples stood in the center of the hall. Two strands of medicine pouches hung from his shoulders. A gentle smile rested on his face as he looked at Li Ximing with calm, relaxed eyes.

"Master!" Li Ximing knew this face better than anyone. It was none other than his master, Xiao Yuansi!

He had always looked gentle and kind, but age now weighed heavily on him. His eyes carried weariness; his complexion was pale; and it seemed he had recently suffered some minor injuries.

Li Ximing hadn’t expected him to come in person and hurriedly performed a disciple’s salute, standing respectfully to one side.

The man took his hand, his eyes warm. His voice still carried the same rich gentleness it had all those years ago, "You’ve grown so much, Ming’er."

After Li Xijun’s death, Li Ximing had wept only once, and since then had had no room in his heart for mourning. But those words made his eyes sting. He said in a low voice, "Disciple Ximing greets Master!"

"Good..." Xiao Yuansi, though aged, still bore a middle-aged appearance from years of taking medicinal pills. He smiled at Li Ximing, then turned toward Li Xuanxuan and said, "Xuanxuan, we’ve talked enough for now. Why don’t you rest for a bit? I’d like to speak with Ming’er alone."

Li Xuanxuan was the highest in seniority within the Li Family, so only the man before him could address him so casually. Stroking his white beard, he quickly took his leave.

Xiao Yuansi turned to the young man before him, coughed twice, and said with a smile, "Ming’er, come. Let’s go talk at your Mount Wu."

Li Ximing quickly moved to support him, but Xiao Yuansi only chuckled and shook his head. Li Ximing felt nothing but gratitude for this elder. They descended together toward Mount Wu, landing atop its peak.

Xiao Yuansi looked around and said with a smile, "You... you’ve always had the finest things. This Mount Wu is even better than my cave dwelling atop Mount Xianyou."

Li Ximing nodded silently. The two of them sat down at a jade table, and Xiao Yuansi spoke softly, "Your family has not been using the blood pool. Good. My efforts at Tongya weren’t for nothing."

Li Ximing just kept nodding. Xiao Yuansi looked at him and continued, "In this lifetime, I’ve only ever taken you as a disciple. Everything I know of the alchemic Dao, I’ve passed on to you... Ming’er... I know you. Perhaps even better than Xuanxuan does. That’s why I came."

He said gently, "Ximing, if you plan to attempt the Purple Mansion Realm, why didn’t you tell your master first..."

Li Ximing raised his head and saw the familiar smile on Xiao Yuansi’s face. He said, "Xuanxuan might have refused to give you the Radiant Sky Stone. Don’t blame him for that."

"Master... I wouldn’t dare!" Li Ximing stood up in alarm, but Xiao Yuansi pulled him back into his seat, then took out a jade bottle from his sleeve and placed it in his hand with a smile, "Take a look."

The bottle felt warm in his hand. Sweeping it with his spiritual sense, Li Ximing discovered a single brilliant pill inside, etched with five claw-like golden patterns. It was brimming with radiant light, and the entire jade bottle shimmered with concentrated golden brilliance.

Li Ximing cultivated the Bright Yang Dao and was well-versed in alchemy. How could he not recognize it? This pill brimmed with intense Bright Yang mana, with a pure and tranquil aura. Who knew how many Bright Yang spirit items and treasured panaceas had gone into refining it!

"Mas... Master...!" Li Ximing stood frozen in place. Xiao Yuansi chuckled twice, then coughed and said softly, "You... I’ve always known your ambition was great. I had started paying attention to Bright Yang spirit items when you reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. I thought I’d collect them gradually, but you advanced faster than I expected. I could barely keep up.

"Fortunately, I’ve built some connections over the years and have some knowledge of Bright Yang spirit items. I secured two treasured panaceas, the Bright Sea Lotus and the Triple Yang Radiant Qi Fruit. I rushed to the Eastern Sea and, with much effort, finally gathered what I needed."

Xiao Yuansi continued gently, "Spirit items for the Purple Mansion Realm are far too rare, and I don’t have the means for that. But I do have some skill in alchemy. Though I lack a formula to aid in breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, this is pure Bright Yang Origin. It’s called the Radiant Violet Pill, and it should benefit you greatly."

He looked at Li Ximing and said warmly, "It’s a valuable item... I was afraid others might overhear, so I called you into the formation to talk. I kept this from my family’s Daoist Master and did it myself... He’s off in the Northern Sea, so he won’t interfere... you can use it without worry."

Li Ximing couldn’t meet Xiao Yuansi’s gaze. He could only reply, "With all Master has done... this disciple has no way to repay you..."

"Repay?" Xiao Yuansi shook his head, a nostalgic look crossing his face. He laughed heartily for a few moments, then patted Li Ximing on the shoulder. The old man said no more, as if those few pats had conveyed all he wanted to express.
