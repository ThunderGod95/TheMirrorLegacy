# Chapter 382: Profit From Chaos

Li Qiuyang's spell ignited in his hand instantly, flaring into a stream of light that split the air as it flew toward the unsuspecting man. Focused on the group of Xiao Family's cultivators in front of him, the man felt his skin crawl and turned just in time.

"Damn it!"

The devil cultivator saw the fire spell barreling toward him and hastily shifted his stance to block it. Despite his experience and strong martial prowess, he was forced to brace himself and counter the spell.

Meanwhile, the Xiao Family's cultivators reacted swiftly and grasped this opportunity to attack. They positioned themselves behind the man now, seizing the opportunity as they swung their dharma artifacts.

Their leader commanded, "Men, reposition yourselves! Shift the formation to the offensive!"

The golden light, long gathered in his palms, was bursting forth. The Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators behind him had been channeling their mana to empower the spell all this while, making it blaze ever brighter, transforming into a prismatic golden missile that hurtled toward their foe.

"SHIT!"

An ordinary Qi Cultivator caught between these attacks would have had no chance of survival. However, this devil cultivator was not ordinary. A brilliant blood light flared around him, and a small red shield emerged behind him.

CLANG!

He raised his large axe, its blade aglow with sinister blood light. With a single sweeping blow, it had already shattered Li Qiuyang's spell. However, an unyielding streak of golden light struck him squarely in the back.

The shield lasted only a moment before vanishing under the onslaught of the golden light. It was a brief respite, but enough for the cultivator to adjust his position and narrowly avoid a fatal blow.

A muffled poof was heard before blood splattered everywhere. The devil cultivator's body was cleaved all the way from his left shoulder to left hip, and his organs spilled out gruesomely.

He gritted his teeth and cursed, then quickly performed a hand seal. The blood and flesh in the air quickly transformed into a swirling blood mist before touching the ground, and just like a whirlwind, the remnants of his body vanished into the depths of the alley.

Li Qiuyang, having never before encountered a devil cultivator of such resilience, stood frozen in shock for a moment before exclaiming, "How can he still escape in that state? How can this be possible?!"

"Brother Qiuyang!"

The Xiao Family cultivators had already broken their formation and approached him with gratitude.

"Thank you for your help, Brother Qiuyang!"

"No problem," Li Qiuyang replied, but he was still a little dazed from being surprised by the devil cultivator's maneuver.

"Are we going to just let him go like this?" he asked.

Noticing Li Qiuyang's surprise, a member of the Xiao Family smiled bitterly and said, "You may not know about this, Brother Qiuyang, but devil cultivators are masters at preserving their lives. Among all cultivators, those who followed the path of Diverse Mansion Unified Cauldron were notoriously difficult to defeat."

"What's more, devil cultivators like him generally disregard their physical bodies, just like the Buddhist cultivators. While their bodies aren't as disposable as the Buddhists, they certainly don't hold the same value to him as to us. Do not be fooled by his injuries; a few days of absorbing blood qi and devil qi will see him fully restored," he added bitterly.

While the Xiao Family's cultivator was explaining, the white formation in the sky above them suddenly rumbled, revealing cracks all over. The faces of those around him immediately turned ashen with fear.

"Then we should leave quickly! If this devil cultivator gathers reinforcements and attacks, we'll be as good as dead!" Li Qiuyang urged hastily.

The expression of the Xiao Family's cultivator darkened as he said gravely, "You're right, the market seems to still be surrounded by devil cultivators... It's impossible to escape now. There's still a major formation atop the Cloud Crowned Peak, why don't you come with me to the market's center? There's a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator on Cloud Crowned Peak, and with the grand formation's protection, I think we can hold out until my family sends help..."

Li Qiuyang shook his head, pulling a jade pendant from his storage pouch and sensing its direction before replying, "Brother Xuan from my family is still in the marketplace. I must go help him... Forgive me, but I cannot accompany you."

"Ah!"

A look of disappointment appeared on the Xiao Family's cultivator's face as chaos reigned around them in the city. He knew Li Qiuyang, an unrefined Qi Cultivator, might struggle even with self-protection, let alone find someone in the marketplace.

But seeing Li Qiuyang's solemn, determined expression, he could only cup his fist respectfully and say in a subdued voice, "Take care of yourself, Brother!"

Flying was not an option as such ascent would make them easy targets for the lurking devil cultivators, so the cultivators activated their Divine Movement Spell and swiftly parted ways.

The Xiao Family's cultivator led his group down an alley, while Li Qiuyang clutched the talisman in his sleeve with one hand and held the jade pendant in the other, racing toward Li Xuanxuan.

————

Meanwhile on Cloud Crowned Peak...

The wind blew gently across the frigid mountaintop where Xiao Ruyu stood, his expression as somber as the murky clouds rolling endlessly beyond the protective formation.

On the jade platform before him lay a formation plate with complex patterns. Six of its points still shone brightly like stars, while the other six were dull and cracked, having clearly been tampered with.

Contrary to Li Xuanxuan's assumptions, Xiao Ruyu was still on Cloud Crowned Peak. He stood there, unprepared and brooding, his teeth clenched.

"I'm afraid... I've fallen into a trap."

The jade in his hand emitted a faint red glow as light flowed across the six engraved names.

"Cloud Crowned Market, Mount Yu, Xianyou Peak, Yuyuan Market... I don't think our family can save them."

A chill settled in Xiao Ruyu's heart. The devil plague was wreaking havoc, not just on the fringes of Cloud Crowned Peak but at almost every Xiao Family stronghold, including the main peak, Xianyou Peak.

"The Old Ancestor has been gone for months, and with the devil plague intensifying, I fear my family will suffer great losses!"

BOOM!

Lost in his grim thoughts, Xiao Ruyu did not immediately notice two more points on the formation plate flicker and die. Clutching his dharma artifact, he looked up to find several black-robed cultivators outside the formation, silent yet clearly hostile, leaving him puzzled.

They said the devil plague would spread north from the Mushroom Forest Plain, through Lixia Prefecture to the boundary of the Purple Smoke Gate... Why the sudden change? Could the Azure Pond Sect... be against us now?

Having led his family for three years and managed the Cloud Crowned Peak town for five, Xiao Ruyu was no longer the impulsive youth who had once sought revenge at the Golden Tang Gate together with Li Xuanfeng. His knowledge of hidden secrets and his tactical acumen had evolved immensely.

Impossible... impossible... How could the Azure Pond Sect turn against us now, with at least fifty years until Daoist Master Shangyuan breaks through?

His thoughts were in disarray as the formation points shook violently before finally being extinguished. The cracks in the large white formation above widened, and devil qi began seeping through like billowing smoke, emitting a shrill whistle.

Xiao Ruyu watched on with a calm look on his face, but a tense voice beside him quickly broke the silence.

"Young Master!"

A swordsman with an ethereal aura landed on the peak, his body encircled by two serpent dragons with bared fangs. In a grave voice, he said urgently, "Please descend the mountain quickly, Young Master. I will handle things here!"

He was Chen Taojing, once an ally in the siege of Yu Yufeng alongside Li Tongya. His Dao foundation was the Boundless Ocean, and the light green serpent dragons around him looked extremely formidable.

"Uncle Taojing..."

Xiao Ruyu hesitated, his eyes flickering between the faltering grand formation and the stalwart figure beside him.

"My Boundless Ocean prowess is the strongest here; I can control many with one. I've also prepared pills for this. Please leave quickly now, Young Master!" Chen Taojing urged.
𝘧𝓇ℯ𝑒𝓌𝑒𝑏𝓃𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘭.𝒸ℴ𝓂

Gritting his teeth, Xiao Ruyu cloaked his figure and hurried down the mountain, leaving Chen Taojing standing alone, sword in hand, facing the silhouettes outside the crumbling grand formation.

Li Xuanxuan waited in the street for a bit. He saw no one, only the stark red blood that had seeped into the earth and stained it. He retrieved a jade talisman from his storage pouch and focused on it intently for a moment.

"Qiuyang's position is still changing... I can't tell if he's alive or if someone has taken his talisman..." he murmured to himself in worry.
𝕗𝐫𝐞𝕖𝕨𝐞𝗯𝚗𝕠𝘃𝐞𝚕.𝐜𝗼𝚖

The fact that Li Qiuyang was an unrefined Qi Cultivator made him vulnerable, especially amidst such widespread calamity. Li Xuanxuan clung to hope for his safety, though his certainty waned.

Anxiously, Li Xuanxuan watched the direction indicated by the jade talisman and began to move toward it.

After a moment's hesitation, he crammed the talisman into a crack in the wall. His hand glowed with mana light as he quickly wrote a few lines of words on the wall:

Qiuyang, if you're reading this, then wait for me here.

He secured the message with their family's encryption method before swiftly departing.

Walking down the street, Li Xuanxuan passed by a gruesome scene—bodies young and old lay scattered, their ends evidently violent. Amidst the debris, he noticed fragments of a jade bottle and two blood-stained white pills emitting a faint glow.

Years of experience working in the store allowed him to quickly identify them as Clear Mind Pills. These were used by cultivators to clear their minds and stabilize their qi to enhance cultivation. He promptly approached the pils and scooped them up. He wiped them on his robe first before casting a spell to remove the remaining bloodstain and squinted closely at them.

The pills had smooth surfaces and were well-made; clearly produced by a prestigious clan. Despite being stained with blood, their efficacy was only slightly diminished. Relieved, he sealed them in a jade bottle and resumed his search.

The corpse in the blood pool was desiccated, with its life force completely drained. However, Li Xuanxuan was undeterred. He searched the body, only to find that the storage pouch had already long since been robbed clean by the devil cultivators.

He rubbed the sleeve of the clothes that the corpse was wearing and realized that it was made of high-quality spirit cloth, suggesting that the deceased cultivator had a notable background. Without hesitation, he stripped the robe from the body and stowed it in his storage pouch.

After looting the corpse, Li Xuanxuan looked up and saw a shiny store sign across the street that read Elixir Pavilion.

His heart surged with excitement. Staring at the deserted entrance which reeked of blood, a greedy thought crossed his mind.

The devil cultivators must have raided this place in haste... perhaps they left something behind!

Elixir Pavilion was owned by the Yu Family of Cloud Crowned Peak. Just days before, Li Xuanxuan had purchased various items there. The selection of elixirs was extensive, and he could have easily spent all day browsing through their offerings.

Snapping back to reality, Li Xuanxuan immediately cast an Aura Restraint Technique on himself before quietly approaching the pavilion.

At the entrance, a cultivator dressed in brocade kneeled with his head drooped downward. Blood flowed down the steps from his hollowed chest—his heart had been stolen. Recognizing the man as the Yu Family's shopkeeper, Li Xuanxuan shuddered at the sight.

If I hadn't recognized that Thunder Pearl and acted swiftly, my family's store might have suffered the same fate... or worse!

Li Xuanxuan moved past the corpse and quickly searched the counter. Despite a thorough search, the grim reality was that it had been completely looted. The devil cultivators, fond of Spirit Stones, had evidently taken them all, leaving nothing behind.

The Elixir Pavilion was shrouded in darkness, littered with broken fragments of jade bottles and bloodstains. Using his spiritual sense, Li Xuanxuan managed to salvage five robes and seven pills—six of Embryonic Breathing and one of Qi Cultivation Realm.

He glanced back at the disrobed corpses. Feeling a twinge of remorse and guilt, he decided to cover them up with other fabric he found in the store before stepping into the pavilion's backyard.

The backyard was even dimmer and partially collapsed. The bare stone slabs underfoot glowed a dark red; though they were not hot, the pungent smell of the smoldering ground was sharp and acrid, stinging his nostrils.

"Warm yet not searing—it's a fire vein... The Yu Family must have been planning to build an alchemy room, so they had drawn the fire vein here..." Li Xuanxuan murmured thoughtfully.

Although the Li Family did not have an alchemy room, Li Xuanxuan was able to identify the baleful flame used in one. The devil cultivators had likely ransacked the area and stolen the furnaces. Without the furnaces and their suppressing formations, the fire vein had erupted, scorching the ground around it.

Casting a protective spell over his nose and mouth, Li Xuanxuan cautiously advanced, pushing aside the debris of a pillar to reveal the smoldering dark red flames beneath it, confirming his suspicion that the furnaces in two rooms had indeed been stolen. What was left behind was only the fiery veins that were exposed and glowing intensely.

"What a waste..." he sighed.

The Yu Family must have expended many Spirit Stones to harness these fire veins as it required a lot of work.

As he turned to leave, a faint groan caught his ear.

"Hmm..?"

He paused, listening intently. Following the sound, he spotted a furry arm poking out from beneath the rubble. A hand with sharp, black nails was struggling to push aside a boulder.

Li Xuanxuan's first thought was alarm.

Is it a demonic creature?!

How could a demonic survive in Yu Family's marketplace, at the heart of the city?!

Yet as he observed more closely, the creature showed no signs of demonic qi but instead radiated pure mana.

This can't be a demon... It must be one of the Yu Family's spirit beasts! Perhaps one that guarded the storehouse or served them!

Relieved, Li Xuanxuan stepped forward and struck the boulder with his palm, shattering it instantly. The creature pinned beneath flipped over, revealing a monkey's face.

"A spirit monkey..?" Li Xuanxuan wondered aloud.

The monkey appeared exhausted, its eyes red and face deeply wrinkled, yet its gaze was lucid, brimming with worldly wisdom. Tears filled its eyes as it looked at Li Xuanxuan with great emotion in his eyes. Each breath it took was labored, resonating like air wheezing through a broken furnace.

Li Xuanxuan held the monkey's furry hand and was taken aback to discover that this spirit beast was stronger than him. It had reached the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, but despite its strength, the monkey was suffering from fire poisoning and had sustained numerous injuries, teetering on the brink of death.

Li Xuanxuan gazed at its tear-stained face which was filled with gratitude, and felt a tug at his heartstrings. He reached into his sleeve and produced two healing pills, offering them to the monkey.

"Here, take these," he said warmly.

The hunched spirit monkey eagerly accepted the pills and swallowed them. It then began gesturing animatedly, moving its body to generate a clattering din akin to clanking iron.

It was at this moment that Li Xuanxuan finally noticed a cold, heavy collar around the monkey's neck. Nearby, a jade green mortar and pestle lay discarded, its edge chipped but still glinting like a precious treasure.

He picked it up, recognizing it as a Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifact used for grinding herbs—a rare find which was highly prized among alchemists and worth even more than any elixir.

Overjoyed, Li Xuanxuan exclaimed, "Good monkey, with these treasures, many of Ming'er's problems will be solved!"

Trying to contain his excitement, he carefully stored the dharma artifacts into his storage pouch. The monkey kneeled and parted its charred fur, revealing several puncture wounds of varying sizes. The wounds oozed black blood, presenting a startling and grim sight.

Realization dawned on Li Xuanxuan as he quickly retrieved a bottle of ointment and applied it to the wound, then cast three spells to heal the monkey's wounds. Looking at the creature, he speculated, This spirit beast likely tended to the Yu Family's fires. I wonder where it was hiding during the devil cultivators' attacks... its survival is nothing short of miraculous!

As he tended to the monkey's blistered skin and singed fur, horror struck him at the realization of what it had endured.

It must have hidden itself in the fire vein! Such a smart and resilient monkey... Its mental fortitude is impressive!

The fire vein, fraught with toxic flame and chaotic energy, could disrupt spiritual senses. It was a perilous hideout, yet the monkey had endured the suffering silently...

Still in disbelief, Li Xuanxuan watched as the monkey dug through the debris, retrieving a charred body. From the sleeve pocket of the corpse's robe, it pulled out a shiny jade piece.

Click.

In just the space of two breaths, the monkey had used the jade piece to unlock the spirit iron collar around its neck. It presented both items to Li Xuanxuan, then crouched on the ground and began to meditate.

Li Xuanxuan had only taken a brief look at the items when the monkey's eyes suddenly snapped open. Its ears twitched as fear flickered in its eyes. It began making silent gestures, miming the motions of pounding herbs.

Sensing the urgency, Li Xuanxuan quickly stowed the items and retracted his spiritual sense as much as possible as he huddled in the corner, not daring to move. The monkey anxiously alternated between bowing and miming the action of pounding herbs but did not dare to make any noise.

Li Xuanxuan watched it quietly for a moment before taking out the mortar and pestle from his storage pouch and handing it back to the monkey. In an instant, the creature gratefully grabbed the dharma artifacts and disappeared into the ruins like a wisp of smoke.

Meanwhile on Wutu Peak...

Li Yuanjiao exhaled deeply. The scale pattern of the longsword named Dragon Coiling Pillar in his grip shimmered with an azure sheen as it caught the light. With his other hand, he held a light purple-colored manual titled the Law of Celestial Moon.

Now thirty-three, Li Yuanjiao stood at the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, just a step away from achieving the seventh heavenly layer. His progress, fueled by the Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit Talisman and the considerable resources of the Li Family, was already regarded as extraordinary.

By comparison, Li Tongya was already fifty when he reached the seventh heavenly layer, and Li Xuanfeng was nearly forty. Li Yuanjiao's rapid ascent definitely positioned him as an exceptional cultivator among the other disciples of the Li Family.

"I should break through to the seventh heavenly layer by the end of the year! The late stages of Qi Cultivation Realm are about accumulation... With seven or eight years of effort, followed by a talisman pill, I should be ready to attempt a breakthrough to the most difficult ninth heavenly layer. Just two more years, and I might attempt to build the Immortal Foundation."

If everything went according to plan, Li Yuanjiao should be able to seclude himself to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm in his early forties.

He stowed the manual away and retrieved a white jade slip, titled the Law of Sexagenary Cycle Sword Manual—a commentary written by Li Tongya. Compared to the complicated Law of Celestial Moon, it was much easier to understand.

After carefully reading the content twice, he thought to himself, Granduncle's swordsmanship is exceptional, having been mentored by the Sword Immortal himself, yet he only grasped the sword element at the age of eighty... That shows how difficult it is to master the art of killing. I wonder how many swordsmen and Sword Immortals there are in Jiangnan...

Currently, only I can match my granduncle in sword talent. Qinghong and Xicheng prefer spears, and the next best swordsman in our family, Zhi'er, has gone to the sect. Xijun shows promise, whereas Ximing treats his sword merely as a tool, lacking the true spirit of a swordsman.

Deep in thought and stroking his chin, Li Yuanjiao was interrupted by a middle-aged man with slightly tanned skin, high eyebrows, and huge eyes. He approached and cupped his fist.

"Peak Master, there's been an incident on Guli Road!"

He was none other than Shamoli, a Qi Cultivator of the fourth heavenly layer who had given up on ruling Mount Yue State and now cultivated alongside Li Yuanjiao.

Despite being an unrefined Qi Cultivator, he consumed spiritual qi that had been mixed with water and purified. Skilled in the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique, he stood on par with regular Qi Cultivators.

Taken aback by the news, Li Yuanjiao rose on the winds. As he ascended, he saw smoke billowing from Guli Road, drawing cultivators from various families who also rose to investigate. Several white lights stayed in the air, signaling hesitation.

"Something happened at Cloud Crowned Peak!"

Thanks to the Xiao Family's efforts in renovating Guli Road, complete with stationed cultivators at newly established relay posts, news from Cloud Crowned Peak reached them swiftly.

Li Yuanjiao's expression darkened.

Oh no... How could this happen?! Father and the others are still at the marketplace!

"Let's go!"

He quickly descended, summoning Li Qinghong and An Zheyan, along with other seasoned Qi Cultivators before flying eastward together.

————

Li Xuanxuan watched the monkey vanish, his mind swirling with doubts and a nagging sense of fear that the creature might not return, which stirred a vague regret within him.

Splat.

Before he could dwell on these thoughts, a subtle flipping sound set off alarms in his heart. Unfortunately, the baleful flames in the backyard from the fire vein suppressed his spiritual sense, confining it to a mere few inches around him and preventing any investigation of his surroundings.

After waiting in the fire-enshrouded backyard for some time, Li Xuanxuan finally glimpsed a tall, dark figure with a halo of red light around him emerging from the baleful flames.

While Li Xuanxuan was waiting, he already had the most powerful fire talisman in his clutch. His eyes were fixated on the figure, carefully contemplating his next move.

Dressed in black and exuding blood qi, he must be a devil cultivator. I need to strike first! Even if I can't defeat him, I can at least escape...

While this person was busy looking around, Li Xuanxuan quickly acted. The talisman in his hand glowed a fierce red as he hurled it toward the figure while he drew a large ax from his storage pouch with the other hand, swinging it with a swift twist.

The devil cultivator, whose spiritual sense was suppressed by the baleful flames, had not anticipated such a sudden ambush from the shadows. Caught off guard and struck by a talisman of mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm, his face and body were instantly engulfed in flames.

"OWWW—!"

The baleful flame in the backyard and the fire spell sparked a chain reaction, boosting the fire intensity by thirty percent and casting a brilliant, red glow over the ruins. In this fiery light, Li Xuanxuan's ax gleamed menacingly as it descended upon the cultivator's neck.

Snap...!

A gruesome noise was heard as the devil cultivator's neck split into two like sugar cane, blood spurting everywhere violently.

Li Xuanxuan felt a moment of relief—until the headless body of his enemy staggered forward, its pale hands striking Li Xuanxuan's chest with surprising force.

"What?!"

The impact sent him flying, and he crashed into a crooked beam causing a loud noise. Ash and smoke billowed as two large pillars collapsed onto him.

Gasping and spitting out two mouthfuls of blood, Li Xuanxuan dared not continue staying on the ground. He struggled to rise to his feet, and the world was spinning around him. Meanwhile, the devil cultivator had somehow managed reattached his head, his face pale and his eyes filled with vivid anger and fear.

He cursed loudly, "I knew something was off! To think an immortal cultivator nearly killed me outright!"

Despite his exclamations, his actions were swift. He drew two short blades, their edges slick with blood. He was lightning fast and closed the distance in a blink, blades poised to strike.

Thankfully, Li Xuanxuan had held onto his dharma weapon through the pain. Twisting the handle of his ax, he used it like a shield to block the incoming attack, though the impact still sent a shock of pain through his chest.

With his free hand, he retrieved yet another talisman, releasing streams of golden light that formed a protective barrier around him. This allowed him a moment to catch his breath.

The devil cultivator, having missed his blow, quickly retreated, gasping for breath. Clearly still reeling from the earlier talisman attack, he cursed vehemently, "You motherfucking bum... How dare you sneak up on me?!"
𝑓𝓇𝘦ℯ𝘸𝘦𝑏𝓃𝑜𝘷ℯ𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝓂

Li Xuanxuan rose to his feet silently and carefully assessed the situation. His enemy was probably a mid-stage Qi Cultivator, now slightly weakened by his sneak attack.

This man is a lot faster than me... I can't afford to rush my escape; I need to seize every opportunity to get out of this alive!

In any case, Li Xuanxuan was secretly grateful that his foe was not as formidable as the previous devil cultivator with the thunder pearl, and their cultivation paths seemed quite different too.

I should strike while he's weak!

With that thought in mind, he swung his ax directly at the cultivator's face. The devil cultivator glared at him furiously and quickly crossed his blades in response to block the ax. He then moved his lips and spat out a mist of blood qi.

This blood qi mist was most likely some vile technique from devil cultivation. Unfamiliar with such means, Li Xuanxuan could only grit his teeth and back down.

What should I do?!

Li Xuanxuan was not adept in combat and lacked powerful strategies. The dharma ax that he wielded was more ornamental than practical, chosen only because it was an unused weapon in his family.

The devil cultivator began slicing away chunks of flesh, leaving a bloody, gaping wound in his thigh. As Li Xuanxuan watched the devil cultivator regain his composure and use his superior speed to fight, anxiety gripped him.

With gritted teeth, he pulled out a dozen talismans from his sleeve, muttering quietly to himself.

"I'm reluctant to use these... but my life depends on them."

The devil cultivator's expression paled at the sight of Li Xuanxuan reaching for another talisman. Scrambling about desperately, he managed to produce only two talismans of his own.

Meanwhile, several talismans in Li Xuanxuan's hands were already glowing fiercely before being hurled straight toward the devil cultivator.

"Such madness!"

In the narrow confines of the backyard, the combined might of the talismans was overwhelming. The devil cultivator emitted a sharp whistle as half of his body transformed into a cloud of blood mist. In the pitch darkness of the courtyard, they stood merely three or four chi apart when Li Xuanxuan issued a command.

"RELEASE!"

The talismans burst into brilliant red light. Li Xuanxuan had selected fire spells since the room was filled with baleful flames, and could be used to his advantage. The darkness in the room was instantly replaced by a vivid crimson glow as flames surged, engulfing both figures.

BOOM!

The Elixir Pavilion could no longer withstand the onslaught and collapsed under the fiery assault, but fortunately, fires raged throughout the marketplace, making the destruction less conspicuous amidst the chaos.

The shield around Li Xuanxuan shattered instantly, flinging him backward. He rolled twice before coming to a stop, coughing up a mouthful of blood. Several of his ribs were broken and his left leg hung limply, likely broken too.

Flames blazed all around him, searing his skin into blisters. Despite the excruciating pain, he forced himself to stand. His left calf, though badly injured, was still attached to his thigh by the tendon—indicating that the wound, while painful, was not severe.

After casting a healing spell on his leg, Li Xuanxuan staggered to his feet, feeling drained of all energy. The mana shield had saved his life, but at the cost of depleting his mana reserves.

"Where is that person...?"

The baleful flames roared, further fueling the burning fire and spreading it from the broken wooden beams. It twisted through the air like serpents, warping his vision. Through the distorted haze, Li Xuanxuan saw the devil cultivator rise to his feet unsteadily, his skin seared and emitting a burnt odor. His hands, reduced to bare bone, were still holding the two short blades. He moved toward Li Xuanxuan steadily, clearly in a far better condition.
𝓯𝙧𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝒗𝒆𝓵.𝓬𝓸𝒎

"You..."

The devil cultivator fixed him with a spiteful glare and managed to squeeze out a single word before a smaller figure burst forth from the flames. A turquoise jade pestle, as thick as an adult's arm, swung through the air and struck the cultivator's head with a sickening crack.

The devil cultivator's head burst open like a watermelon instantly, splattering the scene with a gruesome mix of white and red—almost like fireworks. Teeth scattered around like rain, a few of them even hitting Li Xuanxuan's face and with two rolling into his sleeve.

Thud.

Li Xuanxuan finally fell to his knees, blood spilling from his mouth.

Bam!

The monkey continued swinging the pestle, striking the fallen devil cultivator's chest. Flesh and blood flew everywhere, staining the monkey into a gory red. Yet, it showed no sign of stopping.

Li Xuanxuan swallowed a pill and paused to meditate, quickly restoring his mana. He then cast several healing spells upon himself, still focusing on his recovery. Nearby, the fire intensified, painting the surroundings in ominous shades of red while smoke billowed around him.

Li Xuanxuan called out, "Good monkey... Burn him with the fire! Burn him..."

Before he could finish speaking, he saw the devil cultivator's finger twitch ominously.

Aware of the threat this man posed, Li Xuanxuan dared not let his guard down. Despite tearing up from the smoke, he kept his eyes on the devil cultivator and immediately noticed this subtle movement. He yelped in fear and quickly grabbed his large ax at the ready.

However, the devil cultivator's stomach suddenly swelled up massively before exploding. A thin, frail and bloody child jumped out from within, eyes wide with terror. As soon as his feet hit the ground, he immediately started sprinting toward the flames.

Fortunately, Li Xuanxuan had already raised his ax. With a powerful swing, he heard a sickening crunch as the emaciated child fell to the ground limply, cleaved into two. However, he continued pleading, "Mercy, Immortal Master! Forgive me, please! I've made a mistake! I..."

While Li Xuanxuan was still gasping for breath, the monkey turned around in terror and swung its green jade pestle, pulverizing the child's remains into unrecognizable masses. Without further delay, Li Xuanxuan performed a hand seal and unleashed a fire spell.

The flame of the spell roared, reducing the devil cultivator's body into mere charcoal. Li Xuanxuan grabbed the monkey's bloody hand and whispered hoarsely, "Let's go!"

His voice was so raspy that even he could hardly hear it, but the monkey quickly understood his words, nodding and handing over the black and gold-colored storage pouch that belonged to the devil cultivator to Li Xuanxuan.

"Good monkey!"

After collecting the pouch, Li Xuanxuan and the monkey dashed from the fire, seeking refuge in a nearby house that was untouched by flames. They collapsed onto the ground and began meditating to heal their injuries.

"Shit..." Li Xuanxuan cursed.

It had been so many years since he last cussed. The word scratched his throat as it came out, bringing tears of relief. His cultivation which had been stagnant for years suddenly stirred to life.

After a few moments, he rose abruptly in alarm and instructed the monkey, "You stay here and heal first."

Li Xuanxuan placed two bottles of pills in front of the monkey before carefully stepping outside. He navigated two streets and spotted someone anxiously waiting near where he had concealed the jade pendant earlier.

With the Elixir Pavilion now collapsed and the fire spreading, everyone's spiritual sense was dulled on the street. Squinting through the flames, Li Xuanxuan could barely discern the figure. However, their eyes met, sending a jolt of fear coursing through him.

"Is that Brother Xuan?!"

Li Qiuyang was equally shaken, but gritted his teeth and called out to the man in the distance, his voice trembling.

Overwhelmed with relief, Li Xuanxuan cried out hoarsely, "Qiuyang!"

Li Qiuyang took a step forward, then recoiled in shock again.

"Brother Xuan?!" he exclaimed in disbelief.

The man limping before him had a gaunt face and a skeletal frame. His eyes were clouded, his skin was smeared with blackened blood and covered in blisters. His hair and eyebrows were completely singed off, leaving his scalp bare. Blood dripped from his sleeves, giving him the eerie appearance of a corpse freshly retrieved from a blaze. If he had not called out his name, Li Qiuyang would not have recognized him at all.

Li Qiuyang stared at him blankly. Just when Li Xuanxuan was about to say something, the ground trembled beneath them.

Rumble!

Cracks began forming on the surface of the grand formation's barrier in the sky, causing the expressions of both men to change.

"Brother Xuan, let's go!" Li Qiuyang urged anxiously.

As if remembering something, Li Xuanxuan stopped him.

"Wait... Wait!"

He shook off the dripping blood from his sleeves, then swiftly flew deeper into the street. Li Qiuyang stomped his foot in frustration, then quickly hurried after him. As soon as he took a turn, he saw Li Xuanxuan rushing toward him again, this time with a monkey.

"Ah...?!"

Li Qiuyang froze, staring at the monkey in disbelief and shock. Its fur was matted with pitch-black blood and its exposed skin was covered with blisters. Startled by Li Qiuyang's gaze, the monkey bared its teeth menacingly, raising the jade pestle in its hand as if ready to strike him.

"Ah?"

Li Qiuyang stumbled back, baffled.

Li Xuanxuan quickly yelled out, "He's with us!"

The old man's shout seemed to calm the monkey instantly. Together, the two men and the monkey rushed against the wind.

Li Xuanxuan instructed urgently, "This formation is about to break... We must escape through the Elixir Pavilion! Once the formation collapses, the devil cultivators will swarm in. The baleful flames can disrupt spiritual senses, and the chaos will conceal us!"

As soon as he finished speaking, realization dawned upon him. He quickly retrieved the black and gold storage pouch and emptied it, using his robe to catch the contents. A myriad of colorful and glowing items came tumbling out, including several sharp dharma weapons that sliced through the fabric of his robe and pierced his skin.

Wincing in pain, Li Xuanxuan quickly transferred the dharma weapons and jade slips into his own storage pouch. With a swift motion, he discarded the remaining useless items, scattering them across the ground, along with the emptied pouch.
