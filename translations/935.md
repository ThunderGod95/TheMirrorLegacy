# Chapter 935: The Dawn Guest

His voice, ethereal and deep, echoed across the Pristine Merging Owl Pool. The surging aura of Pristine Water rose and fell with his tone, transforming in the air into streaks of shuttling Azure Crow Qi.

‘How... how has he returned! Is the Outer World conflict over?!’

Ning Wan kept her head bowed, her mind still reeling, utterly blank. She was silent, at a loss as to how to face the terrifying figure before her. The air was frighteningly quiet.

*Pat.*

At this critical moment, the sound of footsteps gradually approached from outside the cave mansion. The two cultivators guarding the entrance readily parted way. The footsteps grew more urgent, and Lin Wuning, in his brown-black robes, arrived at the entrance to the pool area.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, another letter has arrived from Daoist Master Tianwan."

Ning Wan felt a chill shoot to her brow, cursing silently. But the handsome face of the man on the throne broke into a smile of great interest, his eyes filled with mirth.

"Come in," he replied.

Though it was clearly not Ning Wan's voice, Lin Wuning responded with a natural and respectful "yes," lifted his robes, and stepped over the threshold.

He acted as if the prostrated Ning Wan was invisible. At his closest, he passed within an inch of her white robes, yet seemed to see nothing at all. He walked straight to the main throne, bowed, and respectfully presented the letter with both hands.

"Daoist Master, please see!"

Suiguan did not take the letter, but a single glance was enough to read its contents. His face erupted in unrestrained mockery, his expression suddenly animated.

"Hahahaha..."

"What a joke! Daring to ask for the position of Cold Qi!"

His laughter echoed through the cave. Lin Wuning's expression froze, as if he had been turned to stone the moment the laughter began, fixed in place.

The peak Purple Mansion Realm Great Daoist Master laughed for a while, then patted his seat.

"The Three Yangs command the Dawn; theirs is the bond of Monarch and minister. The Three Yins give birth to Cold; theirs is the title of Adjutant Envoy. Dawn Qi was only able to stage that little drama of a minister slaying his monarch because it rode the east wind of the collective will after the Bright Yang Monarch fell. Only then could its symbolism be altered, allowing it to gain some prestige and produce a Shi Chang. What are you, Tianwan? A cultivator of the fifth Dao, yet you still wish to cultivate Cold Qi? You dare make a claim on Cold Qi itself!"

He withdrew his gaze, having quickly lost interest. Ning Wan, meanwhile, bowed her head in thought. Seizing the opportunity while Suiguan had mentioned Si Boxiu, she said respectfully, "Senior Yuanxiu failed in his attempt at Fruition Attainment and perished in the Southern Sea."

Suiguan sat quietly upon the mount, one hand resting on the jade-like throne, his fair fingers tracing its patterns. A smile touched his bluish-purple eyes.

"What audacity. To dare leverage Du Qing's path to enlightenment. In the seven hundred years of the Azure Pond, he is the first."

‘What?’

Hearing him speak Pristine Water's true name so casually, Ning Wan felt her courage fail. Rooted to the spot, she felt the overwhelmingly oppressive aura of his divine ability and dared not raise her eyes or utter a word.

But Suiguan seemed amused.

"Of the so-called Three Yuans back then, the one named Tang had the worst talent. He was already fifteen, yet only at the second level of Qi Refining. But he had the most courage and the most ruthless heart. Looking back now, that's not quite right. Chi Rui was mistaken. This Si Boxiu was the most ruthless of them all."

"Seeking Gathering Wood... A fine idea... A profound Dao-Profundity!"

The Dao-Profundity, cunning, and courage Si Boxiu had displayed in his attempt to attain the Dao were worthy of praise even from Suiguan, far surpassing Chi Wei. It made him narrow his eyes.

"A pity that the shamans have vanished and the Wood Virtue is in decline. The position of Gathering Wood hangs vacant. Otherwise, had he truly attained the Dao through this, it would have been quite an interesting event!"

Ning Wan knew there had to be a reason for Yuanxiu's actions before his death, but her own Dao-Profundity was not high enough to see it clearly. It now seemed he had tried to leverage Du Qing's status—an act akin to provoking a tiger. She dared not interject. She saw Suiguan sit up straight, the smile gradually fading from his face.

"Unfortunately, the Chi family was still of use."

The entire aura of the Pristine Merging Owl Pool instantly congealed, as if plunged into the depths of winter. Despair crept into Ning Wan's heart.

‘The Si family and the Lingu family joined forces, fanned the flames by various other families, and the Li family dug the grave that buried the Chi family. And now I am the one who must face the consequences!’

She gently raised her head and said respectfully, "The Chi family was annihilated in an act of revenge by several families... By the time this junior emerged from seclusion, their entire clan was already wiped out..."

The man above her smiled faintly, and his face took on a demonically handsome quality. He rose from the main throne and clasped his hands behind his back. The entire Pristine Merging Owl Pool seemed to thaw, filled with the warmth of a spring breeze.

"No matter. As long as they can be made to serve. It will just mean a few more deaths."

"However, there is a Chi Buzi who has now fled to the Eastern Sea. Not only to the Eastern Sea, but to Penglai. He has courage too, attempting to cultivate Mansion Water."

Suiguan's gaze was profound as he continued, "Your Azure Pond Sect is full of ambitious and astute individuals... I've observed Golden Feather, and it produces many who are masters of diplomacy, unpredictable, and skilled in subterfuge. It's all due to the influence of Zhang Yuanyu's status. It seems you are all a product of your environment as well, influenced by Du Qing's legacy!"

Ning Wan kept her eyes lowered, sighing inwardly.

The man, however, descended step by step from the high throne, drawing closer. "The vastness of Mansion Water has been lost, and the Auxiliary Position no longer responds. But the Intercalary Position is still worth a try. He is a clever one, of course. Whether it's available or not, to at least attempt its cultivation is timely in this age. It's just that the Dragon-kin are unlikely to allow it."

As he spoke of the Dragon-kin, a deep coldness flashed in his eyes, though a smile played on his lips.

"The hearts of those wretched hornless dragons are smaller than the eye of a needle. The Northern Sea Dragon King's heart is a bit larger than his brothers', but not by much. He has difficult days ahead of him..."

Hearing him speak so casually of Zhang Yuanyu, Du Qing, Shi Chang, and the Dragon King, Ning Wan was already terrified. The names alone felt blasphemous to her ears. When the topic finally shifted back to Chi Buzi, she hastily said, "This man is devoted to the Dao. After Chi Wei's death, he vanished without a trace..."

"Mm," Suiguan grunted faintly. "He is cleverer than Chi Wei."

With that, the man with bluish-purple eyes said no more. He slowly closed his eyes, and the aura of Pristine Water above the Pristine Merging Owl Pool grew calm. The only sound was the dripping of a spring within the cave. Ning Wan waited for a long while before finally hearing the man speak again, his tone flat.

"Accompany me to the Pristine Speech Heaven."

The heart that had been caught in Ning Wan's throat finally plummeted. Despair filled her. Even Yuansu himself would not have had the power to refuse, let alone her. After a moment's hesitation, she could only force out a single, powerless word.

"Yes..."

As she spoke, the rolling aura of Pristine Water began to permeate the pool. A fine, drizzling rain started to fall within the cave, gradually obscuring the two figures until they vanished without a trace. The space became empty and silent, leaving only Lin Wuning kneeling by the pool's edge.

*Drip!*

As the rain dissipated, the pool's surface returned to its tranquil state, clear once more like a mirror. It reflected Ning Wan's white robes and her beautiful face, her head slightly bowed, rendered with exceptional clarity in the pure water.

Ning Wan's reflection was still in the Pristine Merging Owl Pool.

And on the reflected main throne, Suiguan's reflection had also appeared. His bluish-purple eyes were downcast, gazing silently at Ning Wan.

Soon, he rose gracefully. The reflected Ning Wan also stood, a hint of unease in her movements, and followed closely behind him until they disappeared beyond the edge of what the Pristine Merging Owl Pool could reflect.

...

Moongaze Lake.

The late autumn frost had descended. The trees along the shore were rimmed with white, and the road was coated in ice. The wheels of a carriage crunched as they passed over it. The crack of a whip mingled with the hushed whispers of passersby.

"The turmoil in the north has been going on for some time. It's only getting worse lately."

"Isn't that the truth... So many have died... Didn't a Daoist Master fall just the other day?"

The snippets of conversation drifted through the carriage window. The young man inside lifted the curtain and turned with a smile.

"It's not often Fourth Uncle emerges from seclusion. It just so happens the Dawn Guest Tower has a new play. I thought this would be a nice way to reconnect, and also... I've always heard the scenery along this lake is magnificent. A chance for you to enjoy it."

Beside him, Li Zhouluo smiled. "So that's why you were so keen on a carriage ride... As for the play... since Zhouming went into seclusion, there are fewer people trying to curry his favor, and fewer still who would spend a fortune for his amusement. A new play is a rare treat."

The young man was, of course, Li Jiangzong. He was much more diplomatic than his father and didn't share his deep attachment to their grand-uncle, Li Chenghao. This outing was clearly an attempt to smooth things over—Li Zhouluo was not only a Foundation Establishment cultivator but also came from a prominent line. Offending him was unwise.

Li Zhouluo understood this as well. On that day, he had instinctively sided with Li Zhoufang, telling him not to rashly disturb the Daoist Master. But after a day or two back at the lake, he had begun to regret it. Setting aside the clan elders, Li Zhoufang himself had always treated him well.

Now, with the intent to apologize, he was being very accommodating. The two made their way to Lijing Prefecture, a place filled with ancient residences.

Many of the families that had originated here were now high and mighty cultivators. Every house in this ancestral land was a monument, and they still returned every year for ancestral worship. Though it looked old and worn, it was the most distinguished area by the lake, more so than even the dense forests.

After winding through the blue-bricked houses, they stopped before a large tavern. The proprietor was already waiting outside, his eyes bright as he led them in, as deferential as a servant.

"Honored sirs... this way, please!"

Many onlookers turned to stare. Those who recognized the two couldn't help but feel a jolt of shock and quickly lowered their heads.

Li Zhouluo paid them no mind. Unlike Li Zhouming, he only came out for leisure once in a great while, and with his status as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, no one dared to say a word. They were led to the highest floor, where a stage was set in the center. The sound of singing, melodious and captivating, drifted down from it.

The proprietor had naturally reserved the best seats. The two sat at a central table, and Li Jiangzong eagerly poured him wine, offering many pleasantries before lowering his voice.

"My father was simply overcome with grief that day. His words were improper. I hope Fourth Uncle can understand..."

"It was I who was reckless!" Li Zhouluo said with a hint of sadness. He took a sip of wine and spoke at length, reminiscing about the camaraderie of their youth. The noise around them grew louder as the audience cheered. He glanced up at the stage and heard the actor sing:

"In chaotic times, millions upon millions were slain... Of my whole clan, only I remain, a fate so cruel, by heaven's decree~ a fate so cruel, for all to see..."

Li Zhouluo frowned. "What is this about..."

Li Jiangzong felt a bit awkward. He was always busy with clan affairs and had no time for plays, having only heard a summary to use as a conversation starter. He quickly smiled. "This is 'Lament for the Fleeting River.' It's about a young master whose entire family is murdered. Destitute, he kneels in a chaotic forest, ready to end his life, but his brother, who had become an immortal, finds him and raises him to the heavens... It's about brotherly devotion..."

Unsure, he added with another smile, "This play was commissioned by Uncle Zhouming. He found it in a neighboring prefecture and had it performed. He used to watch it privately, and I heard he even brought the Old Master to see it... It's only recently been shown to the public."

Li Xuanxuan had never been interested in such things, but after Li Ximing mentioned it, he had gone once or twice. In recent years, as his health failed and he could no longer draw talismans, he had found these performances novel.

"Ah!"

Li Zhouluo fell silent and nodded, turning to watch. But he had never had a taste for such things, and his gaze soon wandered. To his surprise, it landed on a middle-aged man standing by the side of the stage.

The man was dressed in common clothes, with a long, narrow face and phoenix eyes that, contrary to expectation, gave him an air of dignity and grace. He wore a Daoist crown on his head. Standing amidst the bustling crowd, he seemed to possess a clear, otherworldly presence. Though no cultivation could be detected from him, he had a unique bearing that made those around him instinctively give him a wide berth.

Tied to his waist with a purple cord were two small, quaint gourds, each no bigger than a fist. On the other side hung six small, decorative daggers, arranged in a neat row.

"A single clan ruled the prefecture... how many storms have now passed? North and south, heads rolled like gourds... the common folk suffer and are cast~ an injustice that will forever last!"

The crowd roared with applause and discussion. The man also nodded and smiled, his eyes filled with admiration.

‘What a remarkable individual.’

Li Zhouluo watched him for a few moments, nodding to himself. Cultivators often stood out, but temperament and bearing were innate. Unless one had altered their appearance, some things were hard to change. He doubted that even many of the cultivators he had met could compare to this man.

"Fourth Uncle!"

Li Jiangzong's voice brought him back. Li Zhouluo chuckled. "This is our ancestral land, after all. It's no surprise to find such a graceful person here."

Li Jiangzong looked toward the stage thoughtfully. They both took a sip of wine. An old man had now appeared on stage, dressed in tattered robes, singing:

"In years past, this forest was a realm of ghosts... where even great demons hid their boasts... a ghostly wind would sweep men high..."

Li Zhouluo shook his head. The imagination of these low-level cultivators was certainly wild, but from his higher cultivation perspective, it all felt too much like ancient tales of ghosts and immortals. He had little interest. He was about to speak when he heard a soft sound. A man was now standing beside their table.

Their table had the best view in the house, reserved long in advance by Li Jiangzong. For someone to suddenly appear uninvited displeased him. He was about to look up and speak when Li Zhouluo turned his head, his pupils instantly dilating as if in shock.

The man by the table wore armor with fine, scale-like plates. He was tall, with broad shoulders and a narrow waist. His face, framed by strong brows, was not handsome in a conventional sense, but it possessed an intimidating aura that made it difficult to look at him directly. His mere presence exerted a palpable pressure on the two of them.

‘A Daoist Master?!’

It was Li Zhouwei.

Li Jiangzong had only seen him a few times, but how could he not recognize his own clan's Daoist Master? His entire body tensed. A cold shock shot from his spine to his head, leaving him gaping, unable to speak.

Yet everyone around them seemed completely oblivious, their attention fixed on the stage. Li Zhouwei's expression was calm, his hands clasped behind his back. His brilliant golden eyes were also focused on the front.

Li Zhouluo's mind went blank. For a moment, he wanted to leap from his seat and bow, but he couldn't move. He could only feign composure. After a long, hesitant pause, he managed to speak, his voice filled with dread.

"Greetings... Daoist Master!"

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod. His golden eyes remained fixed on the middle-aged man below the stage. The man seemed utterly unaware, his expression turning sorrowful as the actor on stage wept with envy.

"Tossed about, with no path to take, how can a ghost compare to an immortal's make? But he who became an immortal! The four islands revolve, mountains and rivers bright~ all at his command. The five ghost envoys command wind and thunder~ all by his order..."

As the drawn-out notes of the song soared through the air, a change flickered in Li Zhouwei's eyes. He tilted his head slightly and said softly, "Move further away. Protector Ding is waiting for you outside."
