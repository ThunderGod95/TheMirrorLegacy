# Chapter 559: Journey to Purple Smoke

Li Xijun parted ways with Li Ximing, returning alone to his cave dwelling to rest. Having missed his opportunity to break through to the seventh heavenly layer, he knew it would take some time before he could attempt it again. Sitting in the cave with his hand resting on his sword, he fell into deep thought.

The Bright Yang Dao Lineage might be on Mount Luoxia, but it's unlikely I'll ever have access to it. The techniques granted by the Immortal Mirror are unpredictable and only last through the Foundation Establishment Realm. It seems I can't rely solely on external resources...

Li Xijun had hinted to Li Ximing about the situation to gauge his response, as he knew Li Ximing prioritized cultivation above all else. When he reached a bottleneck in his path, there was no telling what actions he might take. Li Xijun himself felt uncertain about his own Foundation Establishment Realm breakthrough, fearing he might not survive it.

If that day truly comes... without me here to mediate, things might get ugly.

This worry weighed heavily on him. Li Yuanjiao remained fixated on the jade buckle, and though Li Xijun could not assist him with it, he understood that Yu Muxian would not be easy to deal with. Should things come to a crisis, Li Yuanjiao's decisive nature would not wait for Yu Muxian to achieve the Purple Mansion Realm.

With a sigh, Li Xijun set these thoughts aside for now.

He bore no resentment toward Li Ximing over this. Li Ximing had been exceptionally gifted since birth, and if he could acquire the right cultivation method, he showed true potential for being the first in the family to achieve the Purple Mansion Realm. The allure of divine abilities was powerful, and it was natural for him to pursue his aspirations with all his focus.

"After all, the allure of roaming the Great Void, divine abilities to reflect the mysteries, living for five centuries, with honors from the immortal sects, freedom to toy with the mortal world, and insight into hidden secrets‚Äîsuch temptations surpass all else!" Li Xijun sighed, convincing himself of such great temptations.

To possess his own Bright Yang divine ability, to traverse the Great Void freely, embracing beauty and warding off calamities without being a pawn to be sacrificed at will... to witness the rise and fall of clouds and to be honored wherever he went, no matter whom he met‚Äîsuch a vision was irresistibly enticing.

The temptation Li Ximing faced was on a different scale altogether... While the rest of them could spend some time on mundane affairs and only circle around the Foundation Establishment Realm sooner or later, Li Ximing's choices could determine whether he ascended to that level. Faced with such a decision, his indecisiveness was understandable. For Li Xijun, it left little room for blame.

As he sat in contemplation, there came a gentle knock at the door of his cave. A young girl entered, dressed in a white dress who was around fifteen or sixteen, with an attractive pair of phoenix eyes. She spoke softly, "Elder Brother, Brother Ming asked me to bring over a dharma artifact..."

This girl was Li Yuexiang, now at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing realm. She did not like to travel, preferring to spend her days on Mount Qingdu. Li Xijun glanced at her and saw that she was offering him a jade bead.

The bead was a rich blue-green and tied with a red string; it was the Azure Manifestation, an exceptional dharma artifact at the Qi Cultivation Realm, just shy of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Li Yuexiang then continued, "Brother Ming mentioned that he has already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, so this artifact, which can summon a peak Qi Cultivation Realm green deer, is of no further use to him. He asked me to bring it to you."

Li Xijun looked at the jade bead and replied softly, "Take it and use it yourself... "

"I spend my days on the mountain and have no need for something this valuable. Let us save it for Chenghuai," Li Yuexiang replied.
ùíªùëü‚ÑØ‚ÑØùë§ùëíùëèùëõùò∞ùìãùëíùìÅ.ùí∏ùëúùòÆ

Li Chenghuai, sent back by Li Xizhi, was now studying on the mountain, though he had not yet reached the age for cultivation. Li Yuexiang, strong-willed as ever, firmly declined and placed the bead on the table. Left with no choice, Li Xijun nodded and asked gently, "Have you chosen a spiritual qi type? What technique are you planning to cultivate?"

Li Yuexiang answered, "I plan to consume the Long Marching Pheasant Flame and cultivate the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique."

Noticing she had not consulted Li Yuanjiao on her choice, Li Xijun felt a slight headache coming on but nodded silently. Li Yuexiang added, "Brother, you should think more about yourself."

Li Xijun simply nodded, waving her off, then spread out the registry on the table. Several of the Cheng and Ming generation were close to the Qi Cultivation Realm, and he needed to make proper arrangements for them.

Now, the Qi Cultivation Realm itself was no longer significant; only the Foundation Establishment Realm could bring someone into the Li Family's core decision-making circle. Li Xijun reread the names of the dozen or so disciples, thinking to himself, Who knows how many will fall along the way, or how many will reach the Foundation Establishment Realm...

On Mount Yuting.

Time passed as Li Qinghong continued her cultivation for several months. She opened her eyes and, as usual, circulated her Immortal Foundation, enveloping herself in a field of purple light.

It's time to perform the spell and call upon the lightning again!

Casting the spell and reciting the incantation, powerful purple light surged forward, and lightning flickered. The statues on her right began to light up one by one, and a wave of information flooded her mind, "March 23rd, north of Wintersweet City in Yue State... Mystic Thunder descends on Mount Douxuan... October 6th, Mount Fenkuai in Yue State... Celestial Yin Thunder descends... December 2nd, Goose Lake Island off the Qunyi Cape... Towering Thunder descends..."

A succession of messages unfolded, with over a dozen in total, ending with a hazy, broken phrase, "Flood Dragon kin... forbidden to attain Converging Water... now returns to Heaven and Earth... Falling Water Rising Storm in Eastern Sea."

Li Qinghong processed the information, feeling an inner shock growing within her as realization dawned on her.

A demon king has fallen in the Eastern Sea!

The message from the altar confirmed that a demon king at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm had failed in their Golden Core Realm breakthrough, resulting in death and the dissolution of their Dao. This failure triggered a cascade of celestial phenomena, including the Descent of Thunder and Falling Water Rising Storm.

The news, unexpected as it was, could not be immediately capitalized on, but knowing something of this magnitude put her a step ahead. She could not help but feel a spark of excitement, This altar has this kind of function! Now, with Heaven and Earth in turmoil and even communication talismans failing, its usefulness is immense! If I can know of these events in advance, I can help the family prepare better.

The Dao of thunder shortened one's lifespan. Li Qinghong had already lost about thirty percent of hers in pursuit of it. She did not mind, but she did not wish for other family members to tread the same path. However, seeing it now, there was no alternative.

This altar requires someone who has cultivated either Profound Thunderpool or Winter Thunderclap to operate it... Without someone after me to continue this path, it would be lost.

Turning these thoughts over in her mind, another issue surfaced in her mind, This technique came from Lingyanzi of the Purple Smoke Gate... and I never clarified its origins. I cannot delay this any longer... Regardless of whether this was arranged by a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, I must visit Purple Smoke Gate!

Li Qinghong pulled a token from her storage pouch. The token shimmered with a beautiful violet hue, and she gazed at it for a moment.

"Lingyanzi left this token with us back then, allowing my family's disciples to be admitted into the Purple Smoke Gate... This is the perfect opportunity to use it! This time, I will head to the Purple Smoke Gate, pay a visit to Lingyanzi, and then make my way to the Eastern Sea to gather thunder."

Having made her decision, she stood, gathering the few letters by the altar. She casually glanced through them, a faint smile forming as she thought, Second Uncle has finally left the Southern Border!

She then rode a thunderbolt up to Mount Qingdu, where Li Xijun had just finished his cultivation and was having some water in the courtyard.

After Li Qinghong explained her plans, Li Xijun nodded thoughtfully and said in a low voice, "With Situ Mo confined on Golden Sack Island, now is an opportune time to go out. Since you are headed to the Eastern Sea, Aunt, you can also meet Second Granduncle."

"As for the Purple Smoke Gate..." Li Xijun asked, "Which younger family member will we send?"

Li Qinghong pondered briefly, then replied softly, "Most of the Cheng and Ming generation have average talent. Chenghuai needs to remain at home... Yuexiang may be the only one with enough aptitude."

Li Xijun shook his head, "Without Uncle Yuanjiao's approval, it will not work. Let us set this aside for now. Aunt, go to the Eastern Sea and consult Uncle Jiao first, then return at your leisure."

"Very well."

Seeing his reasoning, Li Qinghong nodded in agreement. She gathered her things and set out alone, riding the wind. Li Xijun escorted her to the edge of Moongaze Lake, then returned to his cave dwelling to review his sword techniques twice more before sealing the stone door to resume his cultivation.

On Mount Qingdu, the spring breeze lingered, the grass and trees grew lush, and the immortal towers and pavilions stood with only scattered figures, soon swallowed by the deepening night.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

As Li Qinghong left Mount Qingdu, a light rain began to fall, and looking out, she saw endless dark clouds stretching across the sky. The rain itself was gentle, but it was unrelenting. She rode the wind through it for a long time and still could not find the edge of this cloud cover.

Had she not received that message from the altar earlier, she would have thought it was just a heavy, lingering rainstorm. But now, she suspected it was the aftermath of a failed Golden Core Realm breakthrough‚Äîan ominous celestial phenomenon.

Continuing on her journey, she flew over Yufu Prefecture and Mount Dongli and soon spotted the territory of the Purple Smoke Gate in the distance. There, a female cultivator was standing in midair, dressed in the robes of the Purple Smoke Gate, staring up at the sky with a furrowed brow.

As Li Qinghong approached on a flash of lightning, the female cultivator quickly noticed her and politely bowed, greeting her in a soft voice, "Disciple Shen Yanqing of the Purple Smoke Gate greets the honored elder. May I know..."

"Li Qinghong of the Li Family from Mount Qingdu," Li Qinghong answered promptly.

The female cultivator, who appeared to be around Li Xijun's age and at the seventh heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm, looked surprised.

"Ah, so it is you! Yanqing has long admired your name," the girl praised, beaming.

Li Qinghong was not well-known, so she assumed this was merely polite flattery, but then Shen Yanqing stepped forward, speaking sincerely.

"I heard recently that you successfully reached the Foundation Establishment Realm... Female cultivators who practice the way of thunder are already rare, and those who achieve Foundation Establishment Realm are even fewer! I greatly admire you."

Li Qinghong looked at her with some interest and asked, "You also practice the way of thunder?"

"I do!" Shen Yanqing replied with a warm smile as she continued,"I come from the Shen Family in Yue Cultivating Sect, and our Daoist Master once acquired a thunder technique early on. Thus, we have a long-standing tradition of thunder cultivation."

"So... you are a direct line of an immortal clan, then...?" Li Qinghong muttered softly.

The Shen Family was a long-standing immortal clan of the Purple Mansion Realm based in the Xu State's Yue Cultivating Sect. Shen Yanqing was as esteemed as the Xiao Family's Xiao Yuansi. Despite her high status, she showed no arrogance. She enthusiastically guided Li Qinghong down toward the Purple Smoke Gate's territory, asking, "What brings Senior here?"

Li Qinghong replied, "I have come to pay my respects to Senior Lingyanzi."

Shen Yanqing nodded in understanding, producing a purple token to lead her inside. Towering peaks rose into view, and countless summits lay shrouded in dense violet clouds, which coiled and wove in strands, forming various shapes that gave the entire place an ethereal, fairy-like atmosphere. The pavilions and towers stood exquisitely against the scenery.

The Purple Smoke Gate had claimed this wondrous land, gathering many techniques related to it over the years, transforming the mountain into an immortal sanctuary. Cultivators from various regions and even overseas often traveled great distances to gather qi.

Shen Yanqing introduced, "The Purple Smoke Blessed Land is well-known far and wide. It is said that six or seven parts of the world's violet qi flow from here, and all Dao lineages based in violet qi regard this place as a sacred land. If Senior is fortunate, you might even catch sight of the immortal landscape when the morning sun rises!"

Seeing Li Qinghong taking in the breathtaking beauty, Shen Yanqing continued with a smile, "The old peak master used to boast often about his friendship with your clan... I suppose he has finally been proven right."

Li Qinghong recalled that Li Tongya had described Lingyanzi as somewhat eccentric and gave a slight smile in response. Shen Yanqing then softly added, "I myself cultivate Celestial Thunder through the Celestial Cloud Thunder Technique. If I achieve Foundation Establishment Realm, it will become the Lightfall Thunder... May I ask which technique Senior uses?"

Not sure why Shen Yanqing was asking, Li Qinghong still politely replied, "Profound Thunderpool."

Profound Thunderpool... Shen Yanqing pondered this for a moment, frowning slightly. After a brief pause, she muttered quietly, "I have not heard of that one..."

"It originally stemmed from Winter Thunderclap," Li Qinghong added.

Understanding dawned on Shen Yanqing, and she smiled brightly.

"Ah, so it is also a form of Celestial Thunder! If there is ever a chance, I would love to see the senior's thunder altar in action!"

This comment from the girl revealed quite a bit of information, and Li Qinghong felt a spark of insight, thinking to herself, So, it is a form of Celestial Thunder... It seems Celestial Thunder techniques have an affinity for altar-based spells. With the Shen Family's ancient heritage, perhaps I can learn something useful!

Seeing Li Qinghong nod with a smile, Shen Yanqing beamed, her eyes brightening as the conversation drew them closer. She added with a nod, "Our three thunder lineages differ from others; we avoid all blood qi. Because of this, we tend to be especially close to one another. Once I reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, I will be honored to demonstrate the thunder invocation technique for you!"

Li Qinghong paused, a little stunned, realizing for the first time that thunder cultivators should not consume blood qi. In an instant, many doubts in her mind unraveled, bringing her mind a sudden clarity.

No wonder... No wonder there are no thunder Dao lineages in Jiangnan! Thunder techniques faded in both the overseas regions and Jiangnan... That explains why this girl is so warm and friendly with me!

Most pills circulating in Jiangnan were made with blood qi, and if consuming such substances indeed harmed thunder cultivators, then it was inevitable that thunder Dao lineages would decline. Among the Three Sects and Seven Gates, there were few with thunder lineages, much less any capable of cultivating to the Purple Mansion Realm. Meanwhile, most clan cultivators and rogue cultivators did not fully understand this, making it even harder for thunder techniques to be cultivated successfully.

As Shen Yanqing continued, she explained, "There are certain pills, and I am sure Senior knows this as well, that will cause a thunder cultivator's progress to initially surge after consuming blood qi. But soon after, progress slows, and those unaware often take more, causing them to stagnate and face difficulty breaking through, eventually shortening their lifespan..."

Li Qinghong felt a surge of relief. When she was young, her family had been impoverished, without many pills to take. Later, she was sent to the Fei Family, where she similarly had no access to such resources.

By the time she reached the Qi Cultivation Realm, Li Yuanjiao had received the white talisman, and what little the family had went to him. Li Qinghong had taken only one or two pills, likely sourced from the Xiao Family, and somehow avoided further exposure. Years later, when Wang Xun revealed the truth, she had stopped taking them entirely.

Even so, Li Qinghong now understood why her cultivation had slowed around the third and fourth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm‚Äîit was likely due to those few pills.

She exhaled slowly, feeling a deep gratitude for her grandfather Li Tongya. She even began to wonder,

Could it be... that Grandfather suspected something and arranged everything so carefully?

Lost in thought for a moment, she quickly adjusted and gained another insight, No wonder this girl is so close to me. If thunder Dao lineages cannot touch blood qi, then they also cannot rely on Shared Dao for cultivation speed or divine ability training... This naturally removes many of the usual reservations.

Shen Yanqing continued to politely introduce the various sights of the Purple Smoke Gate up ahead, while Li Qinghong, now carrying a newfound appreciation and sense of relief, walked through this sect bathed in violet clouds with a lightened heart.
