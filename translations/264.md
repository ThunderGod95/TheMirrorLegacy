# Chapter 290: Receiving the Bride

Meanwhile on Mount Lijing...

The side courtyard was meticulously cleaned, and Li Jingtian set up a wooden frame to air out the wooden tablets under the clear weather. As she carefully arranged them, a little girl of about seven or eight years old, dressed in a festive red dress with gold patterns, hurried into the inner courtyard. She held a brocade pouch in her hand and asked cheerfully, "Mother! When is Brother Jiao going to pick up the bride?"

Li Jingtian lifted Li Qingxiao into her arms as she looked at the sky. "It's almost time. Get ready and we'll go down the mountain together," she replied with a gentle smile.

"Oh..."

Li Qingxiao was already eight years old. Earlier in the year, it was discovered that she possessed a spiritual orifice, much to Li Jingtian's delight. They quickly had her begin cultivating and many people had come to congratulate them. Even Chen Donghe was quite pleased. The couple closed the courtyard and watched Li Qingxiao cultivate for a while, but quickly noticed that something was off.

Given Chen Donghe's talent and the fact that the Li Family descended from Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, Li Qingxiao's talent should be rather remarkable. However, after observing her for a while, they found her aptitude to be lacking.

The Profound Scenery Chakra required the condensation of eighty-one wisps of spiritual qi, but it took Li Qingxiao nearly half a month to condense just a wisp.

At this rate, it would take Li Qingxiao over three years to even have a chance at forming the Profound Scenery Chakra, similar to the descendants of external cultivators from the foot of the mountain.

Moreover, Li Qingxiao was cultivating the Supreme Jade Meridian Nourishment Technique that Li Tongya had brought back from Lingyanzi. It was specifically reserved for their own cultivators who did not receive a talisman seed, which was better than what those external cultivators practiced. Otherwise, it would be even slower.

The couple sat facing each other, pondering for a long time. Looking at the other members of the Yuan and Qing generation, Chen Donghe began to feel guilty. He was convinced that his Chen Family's inferior lineage had hindered Qingxiao's progress.

Hearing Li Qingxiao's acknowledgment, Li Jingtian reminded her, "When the Xiao Family's boy hands the jade ring to Brother Jiao, give him the brocade pouch and say something nice. It's just a custom, but remember what you need to do so you don't embarrass yourself."

Li Qingxiao nodded obediently. Li Jingtian picked up a wooden box beside her and explained, "The journey will be long, so I prepared some pastries for you to eat in the carriage so you will not be hungry."

Li Qingxiao took the wooden box in her hands and blinked her eyes innocently.

"Mother, I heard that I will have to marry into the Xiao Family like sister-in-law someday..." she said suddenly.

Li Jingtian paused, her expression complex and rather strained. She gave a vague and simple response to her daughter.

"It's still too early to talk about this... There's still over ten years until that happens, who can say for sure?"

Li Qingxiao nodded with a smile. "If I have to be married into the Xiao Family, you must choose someone who will treat me well, Mother..."

Li Jingtian merely held her daughter's hand in response, her voice tinged with sadness.

"Go on now... Don't keep your brother waiting."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The foot of the Li Family's mountain was bustling with activity. Lanterns and festive decorations were everywhere, creating a spectacle grander than the Lu Family's wedding years ago.

Red silk was hung all around, and the sound of suona music echoed joyfully along the roads. The mountain and its base brimmed with a festive atmosphere of joyful celebration.

After conquering Mount Huazhong and Mount Yuting for over half a year, the Li Family's territory had nearly doubled. Li Xuanxuan planned to establish seven towns below Mount Huazhong and Mount Yuting, adding to the four towns under Lijing and the three under Huaqian, making a total of fourteen towns.

This expansion would bring about a surge of both land and labor, providing ample opportunities for the previously crowded townsfolk, and rejuvenating the Li Family.

Similar to the golden era brought on by the conquest of Huaqian, the Li Family's lower-ranking members once again found opportunities to rise. The seven towns were teeming with ambition and progress.

As long as one was not a lazy idler, hard work would always yield land or a fortune. The people didn't ask for much; they simply longed for survival. Hence, these opportunities were great luxuries to them.

The stagnation and deadlock caused by the increasing number of Li Family descendants and prominent families had been thrown into oblivion. The wealth and military merits brought by external conquests allowed more talents and prominent families to emerge.

"The wind is rising, and changes are bound to come... Five prominent clans have emerged from the seven towns, and another seven towns have sprung up in the north. Many are striving to make a name for themselves..."

Li Yuanjiao, at the center of it all, adjusted the gold patterns on his red sleeves. As the head of the Clan Affairs Courtyard, he was well aware of the Li Family's movements. Adjusting his wedding robes, he smiled contentedly.

"Good times are ahead."

Since Li Tongya had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and the marriage alliance with the Xiao Family was confirmed, defeating the An Family in the north had become inevitable. From the Foundation Establishment Realm ancestor and Qi Cultivators to the prominent families and common folk, everyone eagerly anticipated this.

With all levels of society benefiting and the Xiao Family personally marrying off their daughter, support and reverence for the Li Family grew. Li Yuanjiao noticed this and felt delighted. The clan uncles around him assumed he was happy about the wedding and offered their congratulations, while only his half-brothers exchanged silent smiles.

As the time approached, Li Yuanjiao and his group mounted their horses, following tradition to welcome the Xiao Family. Fortunately, the Xiao and Li families were not too far apart, and the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators had remarkable stamina. If the distance had been greater, they would have had to send someone to fly Xiao Guiluan over.

The Guli Road had been renovated twice, with the Xiao Family preparing relay stations and smooth roads along the way. Due to him being at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, Li Yuanjiao did not need to rest, however, many of the Li Family men were ordinary mortals, so they had to take several days to reach Lixia Prefecture.

Xiao Guiluan had descended the mountain and was waiting in the prefecture, sitting in her sedan until word came that the groom had arrived.

The group arrived to receive Xiao Guiluan, waiting at the foot of the mountain. The Xiao Family's procession finally appeared in the distance. Red flower petals were scattered everywhere. Li Yuanjiao waited patiently, watching as the lavish bridal sedan approached.

A boy of about ten, also dressed festively, jumped down, holding a round jade disk as he announced, "The phoenix sings, thriving through five generations with radiant peach blossoms, a perfect union for a thousand years... May your home be prosperous, your union harmonious."

After the boy had finished speaking, Li Yuanjiao thanked him before taking the jade disk. A little girl then emerged from the group behind him.

It was Li Qingxiao.

The child seemed a bit weary from the long carriage ride but remained well-behaved, not crying or fussing at all. She smiled and handed a brocade pouch to Xiao Xian before leading him into the carriage, leaving Xiao Guiluan alone in the wedding sedan.

Li Yuanjiao dismounted, offering incense and wine, performing all the Xiao Family's rituals meticulously for two hours. Finally, with a nod, he mounted his horse and rode beside the bridal sedan leisurely toward the Li Family.

Finally having a moment to himself, Li Yuanjiao glanced briefly at the sedan, refraining from using his spiritual sense. He carefully observed the graceful silhouette projected on the curtain and spoke in a soft voice.

"Fortunate to meet you."

The silhouette paused as the figure raised a round fan. A clear, bright voice came from behind the curtain, light and gentle.

"I have been waiting."

Li Qingxiao pulled Xiao Xian into the carriage, and then finally let go of his hand. She slumped into the seat, her small face showing signs of discomfort as she muttered quietly to herself.

Xiao Xian, his palms still sweaty from being held all the way to the carriage, asked awkwardly, "What else do I need to do?"

"My mother said we just need to return on this carriage," Li Qingxiao replied with a frown. The bumpy ride had made her feel unwell, so she lay down and endured it silently with her lips pressed tightly together.

Xiao Xian could only sit next to her quietly as well, leaning against the carriage wall. After having been up since early in the morning and kept busy for hours, he felt hungry. He reached for the pastries he had brought, but to his dismay, found that they had been crushed and scattered during the commotion. Sighing, the boy leaned back and closed his eyes, soon drifting asleep.

When he awoke, it was dusk. Xiao Xian noticed that Li Qingxiao seemed much better now, and was peering out the window. Seeing him awake, she nudged him and said in a childish voice, "My name is Li Qingxiao."

"I am Xiao Xian from Mount Yu," Xiao Xian replied. The girl nodded and lay back down as the boy's face twisted in discomfort from his hunger.

"Lady... do you have anything to eat?" he asked shyly, a flush creeping up his neck.

Li Qingxiao was momentarily stunned but then nodded. She retrieved a wooden box from under the carriage seat and handed it to Xiao Xian. He gratefully took it, unfastened the wooden latch, and opened the lid to find neatly arranged pastries. All of them bore small red flower marks on them, making them look extra appetizing.

Xiao Xian, feeling famished, quickly ate three pieces, savoring their fragrant sweetness. "Delicious!" he mumbled in sheer delight.

He continued to eat, but after three more pieces, the lid of the box snapped shut. Li Qingxiao's small, fair hand rested on the box, her brow furrowed. She said in a childish voice, "The road to Mount Lijing will get bumpier. If you eat too much now, you might throw up later. There are still several hours to go, so save some."

Since it was someone else's food, Xiao Xian could only nod obediently. Li Qingxiao giggled and then asked in a low voice, "I heard that our families are related by marriage... Brother Xian, tell me, do you have any good brothers in the Xiao Family? I would like to hear about them."

Xiao Xian looked at her, feeling a strange stir in his heart. "Brother Guitu is the oldest in my generation. He is exceptional in everything... and condensed the Profound Scenery Chakra at just eight years old," he replied thoughtfully.

Li Qingxiao's expression darkened slightly as she responded, "My cultivation is very slow... I have not even condensed the Profound Scenery Chakra yet."

Xiao Xian, whose talent was also not exceptional, felt a sense of camaraderie. He sighed as he said, "I am the same. All the elders focus on those born prodigies... everyone wants to be a genius. They were just lucky! Life is really unfair... Doesn't help the fact that I'm dumb. Unlike my older brothers who can get things right on their first try, I need to hear the same instructions twice, sometimes even three times, only to barely understand them."

After he finished, Li Qingxiao simply snorted and said, "We are born into prestigious clans, with many people below us. How can we possibly complain about unfairness? Likewise, I was born to marry into your Xiao Family; there's nothing I can do about it either."

Xiao Xian was momentarily stunned before he laughed awkwardly, scratching his head. After this exchange, the two began chatting, discussing everything from sword immortals to the Purple Mansion Realm, and from the Purple Mansion Realm to Wu and Yue States.

Xiao Xian grew more familiar with Li Qingxiao, calling her "little sister" at every turn which made her laugh joyously.

As the mountain road became increasingly bumpy, Li Qingxiao fell silent from discomfort, and Xiao Xian had nothing more to say. They both endured the ride quietly, both eventually falling into a deep sleep.

Half-asleep, Xiao Xian found himself holding Li Qingxiao who was swaying back and forth with the carriage. He could not help but grumble, "Your Li Family really doesn't know how to enjoy a good life... I don't expect having fabric cushion on this carriage to block the summer heat, but how is there not even a formation to absorb the shocks? We are supposed to be cultivators, yet we are being tossed around like mortals..."

Li Qingxiao cleared her throat and replied through gritted teeth, "Our family does not go for that sort of thing. Seeking comfort is considered a crime and will get you dragged to the Clan Affairs Courtyard for a whipping!"

Xiao Xian was taken aback and simply responded, "Being born into your family is truly unfortunate..."

"Hmph!" Li Qingxiao snorted, and they both fell silent. After about two hours, Xiao Xian, still drowsy, felt his palm grow warm. Li Qingxiao had laid her head on his hand. Before he could react, he felt a sudden wetness on his palms‚Äîshe had vomited... on him.

"Damn it..." Xiao Xian swore groggily, opening his eyes to see Li Qingxiao's face heavily flushed as she tried to clean up hastily.

He looked at her and teased, "How old are you to still be drinking milk?"

"Shut up!" Li Qingxiao grumbled, though her voice was as soft as a mosquito's buzz.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The carriage moved leisurely along the path. Li Yuanjiao, unaware of the discomfort Li Qingxiao and Xiao Xian were experiencing inside, rode his horse beside Xiao Guiluan's bridal sedan.

Glancing at the woman inside, he asked softly, "Are you familiar with the situation within my family, my dear?"

"I know a bit about it," Xiao Guiluan, conversing with her husband for the very first time, answered earnestly. She continued, "I have just one question for you, dear husband."

Li Yuanjiao, catching a glimpse of sharp, intelligent eyes, felt a slight stir in his heart as he replied, "What is it?"

"Do you have any intentions of vying for the position of the family head?" Xiao Guiluan asked.

Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes slightly, his left hand tugging at the reins in irritation as replied, "I have no such intentions."

Xiao Guiluan paused for a moment before simply saying, "I see."

Li Yuanjiao replayed the earlier rituals at the Xiao Residence in his mind and caught on to many subtle details. He then asked gently, "Why wasn't your father present?"

He was naturally asking why Xiao Guiluan's father was not there to see her off. This caused her to pause again before she answered finally, "My father and I have no affection for each other. He resents that I did not marry locally and bring a son-in-law into the family, but instead, sought connections through marriage in the west. In his fury, he refused to see me off."

Li Yuanjiao was secretly pleased by this news. Nodding, he smiled as he continued testing the waters, saying, "What a fool."

Xiao Guiluan chuckled softly and replied without hesitation, "He is indeed... a fool."

Then, in a gentle tone, she added, "Only my older brothers care for me. With this marriage, I have severed ties with my family. If anything happens in the future, I fear I will not be able to seek their help."

Li Yuanjiao understood her clearly.

As long as Xiao Yuansi was alive, with the connection through his fourth uncle, Li Chejing, there would be no need for Xiao Guiluan to seek aid from her family.

Her words indicated that she had no paternal backing, preventing interference from her maternal family. Mentioning her brothers was likely to make it clear to Li Yuanjiao that she was not without support and should not be mistreated after marriage.

He smirked, thinking to himself, What a clever woman!

He then reined in his horse and gently reassured her, "Don't worry. As long as I am here, no one will dare to bully you."

"Hmm," came the warm response from inside.

The girl was in the carriage, and the boy was on horseback. As night fell, illuminated by the gentle moonlight, Li Yuanjiao couldn't help but laugh quietly to himself.
