# Chapter 419: Compassionate Appearance

Located in the desert, the street of Smoke Valley Market was paved with sandstone. After walking for a bit, Chen Donghe and Li Yuanjiao heard the calls of merchants hawking their wares. As they raised their gaze, a sea of people stretched before them.

During their walk, Li Yuanjiao shared the news of Li Xuanfeng's breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm with Chen Donghe, who looked slightly better upon hearing it, though his tone suggested that he had already expected this.

"Xuanfeng has always been extraordinary since young. He's the most talented among all his brothers, so his achievement was to be expected," Chen Donghe had remarked simply.

After walking a little more, Chen Donghe had pretty much returned to his usual self. He pointed at the bustling crowd and explained, "Despite the barrenness of Smoke Valley Desert, it is rich in spirit resources and ores. Cultivators from all directions flock here, making the number of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators here far surpass those at Cloud Crowned Peak."

He looked around cautiously, his voice diminishing to a whisper before shifting to mana transmission.

"Ultimately, it's due to the Golden Feather Sect's lax control over the temples and their handling of rogue cultivators. This balance allows many lower-ranked cultivators to thrive peacefully here, their numbers dwarfing those at Azure Pond."

Li Yuanjiao observed the crowd around them and nodded in agreement. "The Azure Pond Sect has the largest number of Purple Mansion, Foundation Establishment, and Qi cultivators though. It sees less return from the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators than it could gain from regular annexations and purges... This also ensures that the incapable naturally yield to the more capable and talented. Thus, valuable resources aren't squandered on mediocrity."

After serving the Azure Pond Sect for such a long time now, the Li Family had naturally developed deep connections and insights over the years. Li Yuanjiao elaborated, "The many Embryonic Breathing Realm families in the region can only cultivate Spirit Paddies and must contend with others... They will never be able to compete with Foundation Establishment prestigious clans with high-ranking cultivators in their ranks."

His gaze lingered on the market stalls briefly as he sighed.

"Yet, I must admit that the Azure Pond Sect's systems and strategies are more ruthless and sophisticated, enabling them to evolve from a minor sect on Mount Azure Pond to the formidable entity that they are today."

Chen Donghe fell silent. The atmosphere grew somber, prompting them to shift the conversation. Li Yuanjiao furrowed his brow.

"Uncle Donghe, I brought a bottle of Minor Pure Spiritual Qi with me. It's a common item, yet I've seen none for sale. Why is that?" he asked.

Chen Donghe pointed at the pervasive yellow sand and explained, "Minor Pure Spiritual Qi can only be collected from mountains and forests, which are absent in the desert. The people have found various ways to resolve this issue since ancient times. Historically, the locals have devised various alternatives... Nowadays, most have adopted Minor Quicksand Qi as a substitute. Minor Pure Spiritual Qi is now rarely seen and not worth much."

Chen Donghe's explanation enlightened Li Yuanjiao. The two then searched for a shop and traded the Azure Blades for fifty Spirit Stones.

Although the Azure Blades were mid-quality Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts, it was unfortunate that the curved dual blades were rarely seen. After several rounds of negotiation, it managed to only fetch a moderate price.

Li Yuanjiao accepted the Spirit Stones with a sigh of relief.

No wonder most Qi Cultivators wield Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts... Fifty Spirit Stones will take an ordinary Qi Cultivator over ten years to save by just gathering qi without active cultivation. If they are actively cultivating, they will also need to buy supplies and rations, which can easily triple or quadruple this period... That's about forty years of savings for a single dharma artifact. How many such forty-year spans does one have in a lifetime?!

He then retrieved a devil cultivator's sledgehammer that he had gotten from Li Qinghong from his storage pouch. This inferior Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifact was worth only thirty Spirit Stones. After selling the remainder of the Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts, including Li Qinghong's nine Spirit Stones, Li Yuanjiao managed to amass nearly a total of a hundred Spirit Stones.

With Minor Pure Spiritual Qi being both cheap and rare here, Li Yuanjiao decided to keep it for now. Chen Donghe pushed six Spirit Stones into Li Yuanjiao's hands, rounding out the majority of the sum, leaving just over a dozen Spirit Stones unaccounted for.

Xizhi's letter mentioned that Yuan Tuan could provide some Spirit Stones, but relying on a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator's favors for just a few stones really isn't worth it.

Having gathered all their items, the two exited the market and flew across the vast desert. Li Yuanjiao hesitated slightly before asking Chen Donghe, "Is there a way to earn Spirit Stones in the desert?"

Chen Donghe pondered briefly before replying, "There are ways, but most would take years, and it's unlikely you could gather more than ten Spirit Stones."

Upon hearing that, Li Yuanjiao could only perish this train of thought. He handed over the few pills in his possession to Chen Donghe, then asked, "Uncle Donghe, how's the progress with the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi?"

"It's about 80% ready," Chen Donghe replied as he pulled a jade bottle from his storage pouch and added, "It'll be ready in another year and a half!"

"Good," Li Yuanjiao acknowledged with a nod of approval, "I'll head back to the clan first. Take care, Uncle Donghe... After some time, I will come find you again."

After exchanging a few parting words and promising to pay respects to Li Tongya on Chen Donghe's behalf, Li Yuanjiao rode away on the wind.

The Yu Family of Linghai Prefecture had been a prominent clan for generations. Its descendants pledged allegiance to various immortal peaks within the Azure Pond Sect, often competing fiercely among themselves for power and influence.

In the abandoned city, streets and alleys lay dry and deserted, save for the faint sounds of conversation emanating from the great hall at the city's highest point. Here, a few of the Yu Family's Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators stood in an awkward line.

Historically, the heads of these family branches rarely met, communicating instead through messengers even for internal discussions. Yet this time, they found themselves together in this desolate city, their expressions both a mixture of respect and tension. They were all clad in distinct attire.

At the end of the hall sat a black-robed monk, his belly protruding as if he were six months pregnant. His face, gleaming with grease, shifted between broad grins and labored gasps for breath.

"Are you satisfied, Master Monk?" asked the eldest of the Yu Family, stepping forward with a smile.

"Absolutely! I have no complaints! Your family has always been the most generous... offering up sixteen thousand souls! Truly, the Yu Family possesses the greatest wisdom in not clinging to mortal coils," Murong Xia responded with a huge grin.

"Hahaha! I'm glad to hear that, Master Monk!"

The old master of the Yu Family laughed as a gust of wind swept through the empty streets, a sense of satisfaction welling within him.

This one is about to become a Maha! Without the exchange of interests between the immortals and the Buddhists, how could the Yu Family have ever connected with such a powerful figure? Now is the perfect opportunity to earn his favor before he attains the Maha status!

With a broad, obliging smile, he continued with forced sweetness, "Is this city sufficient for you, Master Monk? If not, I can find more people of great virtue and wash them well before sending them into your belly for a good time!"

The monk, half reclining on a grand golden seat, hummed a few notes. His protruding belly was exposed, and it was visibly marked with blue and purple veins.

He simply laughed off the offer.

"No need... no need! I've already gathered 106,756 people... Any more, and they might rupture my blessed land."

He winced, grappling with the discomfort in his belly briefly. After several labored breaths, he added with a broad grin, "Since embracing the Virtuous Benevolence Zen Dao, I've abandoned The Merciful One's feeble ways... Now, having realized the way, I will soon ascend to Maha! Then, I shall reclaim the cultivation of my previous lives and reach even greater heights!"

Murong Xia was the Master Monk who had once passed through the Li Family's territory over a decade ago. While traveling and consuming humans, he eventually found himself in Linghai Prefecture. Sitting in the golden seat with his swollen belly, he smacked his lips and proclaimed loudly, "This old monk is about to be enlightened... This old monk is about to be enlightened!"

Those from the Yu Family naturally began congratulating him. Blood began flowing out from Murong Xia's lower body. He flipped over as if trying to adjust his posture before exclaiming suddenly, "ALAS!"

BOOM!

His enormous belly burst open, emitting a strange fragrance and radiating bursts of colorful light. The sounds of whistling wind, a pleasant melody, and the laughter of men, women, and children erupted powerfully from within him.

From the bloody remains of his body, a baby emerged from Murong Xia's stomach. He rapidly aged into a seventeen or eighteen-year-old figure with an androgynous and serene face. He had fourteen arms, each wielding a dharma artifact.

As he moved, shimmery golden powder fell from his body, instantly transforming into animated figures that scurried about in excitement.

The Yu Family, witnessing this surreal scene, recoiled in horror with their eyes wide open in shock. The androgynous being picked up Murong Xia's lifeless torso and consumed it as if it were a cucumber, devouring it in just four or five bites.

"Delicious."

Blood trickled from the corner of the Maha's mouth as his figure began to swell dramatically. In mere moments, he had grown to the size of a hill, his massive form blotting out the sun. As he towered over houses and cities, crushing them beneath his feet, he parted his lips slightly and spoke in a soft, mysterious voice.

"I, Murong Xia, have today attained enlightenment as the Ninth Maha Reincarnate. I have connected with the Six Paths of Compassion World View and gained great divine ability... In seven days, I invite all fellow cultivators to join me at the religious assembly..."

His voice rippled through the air smoothly like water, garnering echoes of congratulations. Cultivators from various sects in the north and south voiced their praises as Murong Xia stood silent and proud in Linghai Prefecture.

Murong Xia moved his gaze and was about to say something when the void before him suddenly tore open. A man in white emerged, cradling a sword and regarding him silently.

His face, obscured by mist, remained unseen, halting Murong Xia's attempt to speak immediately. The celebratory sounds vanished too, leaving only a deadly silence around them.

"S-Shangyuan..."

A flicker of fear crossed Murong Xia's androgynous, compassionate face, and he lowered his fourteen slender arms.

Daoist Master Shangyuan, clutching his sword, stared coldly at him and gave a simple command.

"Return to Yan State."

Arrogance immediately left Murong Xia's face as he looked visibly deflated. He shrank until his body became the size of a normal human again before he quickly scurried off into the void and vanished without a word.

The remaining Yu Family members were still kneeling in terror. They watched as Daoist Master Shangyuan also disappeared into the void without sparing them a single glance, leaving behind an empty city marked only by two large footprints.

Phew!

The Yu Family members wiped the sweat from their foreheads, exchanged glances with each other, and then snorted coldly before dispersing.

Meanwhile on Mount Yuting...

Li Qinghong had said her farewells to Li Yuanjiao before settling into a period of cultivation on Mount Yuting. However, she soon felt the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow within her becoming restless. With frustration in her heart, her progress was slowed.

"How could this be...?"

She set her spear down horizontally, her brow furrowed in deep thought.

Could it be that a devil cultivator has trespassed on my grounds, or perhaps there is a disturbance in the blood qi that has affected my talisman qi...? It might also be that I haven't had a proper fight in too long... All these years, the battles have been swift, decided within a few moves.

Li Qinghong was not one for a peaceful life of quiet cultivation; she thrived in the heat of battle, only making progress when her spear was stained with blood. Now, having spent nearly a decade on Mount Yuting, practicing sporadically, her progress had naturally begun to slow down.

After offending that demonic creature, I dare not enter Mount Dali recklessly. The demons in Moongaze Lake lurk in its dark undercurrents, elusive and well-hidden...

She missed her family, but knowing she could not venture far, Li Qinghong decided to settle on Mount Yuting. Cradling her spear, she watched the sunrise silently. Suddenly, her thoughts were interrupted by a loud noise and the crunching of snow underfoot.

"Auntie!"

Li Xijun approached, walking on the snow. He cupped his fist respectfully and said, "There's a monk by the lake, and he has constructed a hut at the mountain's base to meditate."

"A monk..?"

Li Tongya's incident had left Li Qinghong with a deep-seated hatred for monks. She frowned immediately, gripping her spear tightly as she asked in a cold voice, "What is his cultivation realm?"

"Appears to be just a monk," Li Xijun replied, raising an eyebrow with concern, fearing his aunt's impulsiveness.

He quickly added, "Auntie, this person traveled south under the guise of a mere monk, so he must have powerful backing... Please exercise caution and avoid unnecessary risks."

"I know," Li Qinghong replied, her almond eyes narrowing as she clutched her spear.

"Yet, we cannot allow him to stay at the base of our mountain. What if he is lying in wait for Brother Jiao's return? Send someone to inquire why this bald cur has come," she instructed.
ùëìùìáùò¶‚ÑØùò∏ùò¶ùëèùìÉùëúùò∑‚ÑØùëô.ùëêùëúùìÇ

After a brief pause, she continued, "Ensure that those at Lijing are aware of the situation... and ready to act anytime to suppress this threat."

"The Family Head has been informed," Li Xijun replied with a nod.

Together, they approached the formation plate. Li Qinghong reached out with her delicate hand and pressed on it, sending her spiritual sense through the device to survey the surroundings. As expected, she found a monk seated amidst the grass at the foot of the mountain.

The monk was clad in a brown robe with wide sleeves, his head marked with ordination scars. His face was round and his features were unassuming, though not unattractive.

He sat cross-legged with a bronze-ringed monk staff resting on his knees, his eyes firmly shut.

After Li Xijun issued instructions, the formation soon stirred slightly. An Siwei approached warily with a spear in hand and said softly, "I am An Siwei of the Li Family... Venerable monk, what brings you from afar? Do you have any questions?"

The monk opened his small eyes and replied, "I am Kongheng of the Liao River Temple in Yan State... I wish to meet with the peak master of Yuting. Could you kindly convey my request?"

An Siwei, having received Li Xijun's instruction before descending the mountain, nodded and inquired, "May I know what you would like to find out, Master Kongheng? At least, that will make it easier for me to relay it to the peak master."

Kongheng paused gently before replying, "I come with no ill intentions. My journey is merely dictated by the path of Buddhism and the workings of fate, thus I have traveled far to wait here for the peak master."

An Siwei, unable to return empty-handed, pressed further, but the monk's replies circled back to his initial statement. Reluctantly, he returned up the mountain to report his words.

Li Qinghong, typically wary of Buddhist cultivators, shook her head upon hearing this and said, "We know nothing of this monk's background, and it wouldn't be right to kill him outright... Let him wait if he so wishes. Additionally, send someone to the Xiao Family to inquire about this Liao River Temple."

The two boys departed right away to carry out her orders. Li Qinghong, finding her cultivation progress stalling, retrieved the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique manual and began studying two of the secret techniques in it.

After several days of studies, An Siwei returned, bearing his spear and speaking gravely.

"Peak master, this monk initially claimed to be treating ailments. However, the townspeople, still traumatized by Murong Xia, have ignored him. Undeterred, he has now settled in a hut at the mountain's base, continuing his cultivation alone!"

Li Qinghong set aside her jade slip and asked softly, "What did the Xiao Family say?"
