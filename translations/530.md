# Chapter 805: Turning Point

Tang Shedu thrust his halberd forward, a hazy golden light flashing in midair as dark clouds rolled back and forth. The halberd was reflected in Li Xuanfeng’s pupils, yet his heart instead calmed.

"So it really was you."

All doubts had been dispelled. The reason why Tang Shedu’s forces had been wiped out so quickly must be because he had revealed all their arrangements, perhaps even what dharma artifacts or Immortal Foundations they possessed. The devil cultivators only needed to follow the plan and kill them in order.

"Quick to defect, weren’t you..."

Tu Longjian broke through to Purple Mansion first, and Tang Shedu defected to the northern side right after. The man must have received a promise from some devil or buddhist cultivator. He truly was resolute and ruthless. Even now, he had a calm, composed expression, as though everything were under control.

Li Xuanfeng’s gaze was cold as a spark of golden light lit up on his chest and climbed up to his neck. It slowly transformed into a white suit of armor as it reached his jawline. Radiance burst forth as the light spread from his chest to his limbs, finally tracing a ring of gold behind him.

It was the Heavenly Gilded Helm!

Dark-golden patterns surfaced across his body. Since he had been prepared, Li Xuanfeng flipped his longbow, reached over his neck to grip the bow, and held the long golden weapon between them to block the Changtian Halberd.

Boom!

A thunderous boom echoed through the air. A few golden ripples flashed past, and Li Xuanfeng’s figure reappeared several kilometers away, golden aura surging around him. Blood glinted once more in his pupils as he coughed twice.

Tang Shedu was not weak at all, and his innate ability for cultivation was top-tier. If it hadn’t been for Yuanwu blocking his techniques and preventing him from reaching Purple Mansion Realm, he would have been far more formidable by now. Even so, his years of accumulation were by no means trivial.

Even with preparation, Li Xuanfeng suffered a light injury from that charged blow. Two mouthfuls of golden powder spilled from between his lips and teeth, drifting through the air, scattering in a hazy golden shimmer.

Tang Shedu did not pursue him immediately. He gazed at Li Xuanfeng deeply, his voice a little hoarse as he said, "Fellow Daoist, listen again."

Murong En transformed into billowing black mist that surged forward. Devilish light eagerly followed as a demonic roar echoed through the sky, "Tang Shedu! He doesn’t want to run!"

Li Xuanfeng surged upward in golden light, shooting into the sky before anything became clear. One hand held his bow while the other drew back an arrow. Mana surged as his deep voice rolled through the clouds, "Tang Shedu! You’ve joined the northern devil Dao and ambushed me! Are you not afraid that the Daoist Masters will settle accounts with you later?"

Li Xuanfeng had no interest in a war of words, he merely needed to make sure the message was heard by all the cultivators on the battlefield. Above all else, the priority was to spread word that Tang Shedu had defected to the devils.

Tang Shedu rode a stream of light as he gave chase, his cold gaze fixed forward. His halberd thrust forward, and his voice was low and indistinct, "Li Xuanfeng, I joined the Northern Dao; only Yuan Xiu bears me hatred here."

His words made Li Xuanfeng’s heart jolt, but a golden arrow had already been released. Tang Shedu’s halberd swept up to parry the arrow, causing it to explode into a shower of golden sparks in the air.

Still, he heard Li Xuanfeng murmur, "Trying to bargain with a tiger!"

Tang Shedu’s expression grew complicated. When he saw the flowing radiance of Li Xuanfeng’s Heavenly Gilded Helm, it was as if he was looking at a version of himself with a different fate.

He didn’t hesitate as his halberd thrust out, but his voice was heavy, "If I hadn't joined the North, I’d have ended up like you—like this! No more chance of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm! How is that any different from death?!

"You think I can’t see it clearly? The Chi Family did this very thing in the past!"

His halberd was flowing with white radiance, fusing with the boiling mana surging from his body. He seemed like a descended god as he roared, "Of course I know bargaining with tigers is futile! But if I’m destined to be a pawn refined by the Azure Pond Sect, why not gamble for backing and a Dao? What can Yuan Xiu do to me alone if I head north?

"And more than that... more than that... this is a supreme buddhist fate!"

Thunderous words burst from Tang Shedu’s mouth. He swept his halberd before him, shattering the golden light flying at him. His face was blasted full of holes by shards of Astral Qi, but they rapidly closed again as he raged, "I know you’re calling out! Good! Let the world know! Let them all aid me! If they speak my name once, grant me one strand of destiny!"

His voice was stifled and full of fury, as if venting the frustration of being denied the Purple Mansion Realm for decades. Golden light swirled in his pupils as he sneered coldly, "Li Xuanfeng, you consumed a Human Pill. Do you even know that? You and I both committed blood-debts for the demonic sect. Don’t talk to me about falling into devilry. The North sucks marrow, while the South carves flesh—how are they different?!"

While they argued, Li Xuanfeng had already fired dozens of arrows that turned into countless golden-white streaks. His two Immortal Foundations surged to the limit, as he relied on his own strength to suppress both Tang Shedu and Murong En, painting a vast stretch of sky gold in the process.

Murong En remained unhurried, silently activating the spirit artifact within his body to influence Li Xuanfeng before him. His voice echoed in Tang Shedu’s ears, "Tang Shedu! Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing has rung thrice. The killing karma is dense and the demonic seed revealed; the chance to transform karma and rise is right before you! For just a dozen of the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators deaths, Lord Jinlian’s promised seat of The Merciful One is near!"

But he did not expect Tang Shedu to cast a resentful and vicious glance at him as he snapped coldly, "Shut up."

"You—!"

Murong En froze for a moment, only to see Tang Shedu glaring at him like a venomous snake, "You think I don’t understand? This kind of turn is a great karmic opportunity for the buddhist Dao. What Maha wouldn’t want me? Hmm?"

Layers of golden light exploded from his body as all kinds of emotions flashed through his pupils. His halberd could now intercept arrows at a greater distance, even though the shock left cracks across both hands.

Still, he extended his arms and slowly walked forward. A dark-golden hue appeared in Tang Shedu’s eyes, streams of radiance flowing across his body. Murong En’s expression grew grim as he let his hands fall to his sides, watching coldly as Tang Shedu climbed step by step.

Tang Shedu rasped, "Tu Longjian... Tu Longjian was born with destiny. Fine then. Thirty years of cultivation, and he drives me to desperation. Fifty years of struggle, and he becomes a Daoist Master. His fate is good...

"I began cultivating at six years old. I schemed tirelessly to please Tang Yuanwu for mere scraps of secret techniques. I’ve carved flesh from my own body for the sake of cultivation, endured sword and blade piercing my meridians every day under Yu Muxian... Still, I never once thought of becoming your enemy."
𝒻𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘸ℯ𝒷𝘯𝘰𝑣ℯ𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝘮

His halberd shone with dazzling white light. Li Xuanfeng calmly broke Tang Shedu’s halberd arts with two arrows. Unfazed, Tang Shedu pushed through the golden Astral Qi, and asked softly, "But why? Li Xuanfeng."

As those words left his lips, golden light burst from him like flames, burning away the devil mist. Tang Shedu swept his halberd forward, knocking aside the golden bow, while his other hand suddenly reached out to grab Li Xuanfeng’s throat.

Boom!

The platinum glow of the Heavenly Gilded Helm on Li Xuanfeng’s arm burst forth. Li Xuanfeng caught Tang Shedu’s wrist. His piercing gray-black eyes met Tang Shedu’s gaze, and he said nothing. He simply held his breath and locked his hand in an icy grip.

Tang Shedu slammed into a hardness as cold as iron. His breath wouldn’t settle as it swelled chaotically in his chest. Li Xuanfeng felt no fear, but Tang Shedu, on the verge of ascending to The Merciful One, grew increasingly frantic.

In Li Xuanfeng’s eyes, the Tang Shedu now turning to Buddhism began to resemble someone else entirely. Much like his time at Zhenhui Temple, those same questions echoed across time and slithered into his ears once again.

Li Xuanfeng’s hatred was a cold, still thing. Increasingly intricate profound lines began to glow on the arm gripping Tang Shedu’s wrist. Strength to Move Mountains no longer offered a great boost by itself, but with both Immortal Foundations operating together, and with Heavenly Gilded Helm enhancing his physical cultivation, his strength continued to rise steadily.

Crack... crack...

The snap of bones echoed audibly in the air. Li Xuanfeng squeezed until Tang Shedu’s face twisted in agony. The malice in his eyes sharpened, but in the end, he said no more, and only murmured, "Li Xuanfeng... all I wanted was to continue my Dao... to stand before them as an equal!"

Li Xuanfeng did not respond. Golden light gleamed in his eyes, and the Heavenly Gilded Helm on his body matched them in brilliance. Sharp, dazzling mana flowed from the Engraved Stone, and golden light shone behind him.

He had served as abbot of the Ning Family for many years. He had snuffed out countless lives with his own hand. He had no lack of secret techniques. When he ignited his essence and lifespan, his two Immortal Foundations erupted with radiance. His sheer might had reached terrifying heights.

Yet, Tang Shedu’s aura kept climbing. His shattered wrist turned to pulp between Li Xuanfeng’s fingers, yet it quickly reformed into a jade-like hand. His pupils flickered like stars in the dark clouds. He freed his halberd from the golden bow and swept it across his body. Li Xuanfeng leaped backward into the air, raised his bow, and notched several golden arrows.

Whummm... whummm... whummm...

Tang Shedu only watched him draw his bow, making no move to stop him. He allowed him to gather strength. Meanwhile, the white glow of his own halberd grew ever sharper as it rose to point into the sky.

Li Xuanfeng was now in the best condition of his life, the strongest he had ever been. Five golden arrows rested simultaneously upon his bowstring. The piercing hum of the arrows, amplified by his mana, traveled dozens of kilometers. The entirety of Chengshui Tomb fell silent.

"Hyah!"

Tang Shedu refused to back down, thunder bursting from his mouth as profound sounds echoed across the sky. Though karma now clung to him and he was tied to many buddhist connections, he had never specifically cultivated those spells, so he ultimately fell short by a fraction.

But this shortfall was only in comparison to Li Xuanfeng, who had ignited his life force and essence qi to fire an unprecedented, fully-empowered arrow. Instantly, every Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators below bled from the ears and their eyes filled with blood. Devil and immortal cultivators alike tumbled to the ground together, and even Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had to catch themselves. The battlefield paused for a moment.

Dang...

Tang Shedu’s halberd arced upward in a sweep of platinum light, piercing into the skies. The five golden arrows above converged into one and fell from the thick clouds like a celestial meteor.

Clang...

The halberd in Tang Shedu’s hands bent like it was bearing the weight of a golden mountain, creaking under the strain. A split second later, it lost the battle and was sent flying away like a bolt from a heavy crossbow, slamming down into the ground with a resounding crash.

Boom!

Golden light pierced through Tang Shedu’s chest, chasing the clouds down into the tomb below. He coughed up golden blood, yet he held his head high. Both of his eyes had blasted from their sockets by overpowering Astral Qi. The shards of Astral Qi spiraled through the air behind him, trailing strings of bead-like golden blood.

Tang Shedu let out two peals of laughter. His eyes had disintegrated, yet two new ones sprang from his sockets, rolling once before flashing with a savage gleam, "Yuan Xiu planned this carefully. It must be that long-missing Situ Jun he chose, a late stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. You took that pill and now stand at the pinnacle of Jiangnan's Foundation Establishment Realm. Quite formidable!

"With such might, perhaps only a few in the grotto heavens could surpass you. But alas... alas... it came at the cost of your path to the Purple Mansion Realm!"

Murong En's face burned under the brilliance of the two men before him, his heart filled with gloom. Though he wasn’t a prince of the Murong Family, he had always considered himself exceptional. Never before had he been left on the sidelines like this, unable to intervene. He could only look up at them.

The clouds above were now in utter chaos. Demonic flames billowed as immortal light barely held on. Suddenly, Murong En spotted a middle-aged man flying through the wind. He held a small jade seal in both hands and tossed it into the sky.

"That is..."

Murong En was briefly stunned, but the Qi Wang's Profound Heaven Hearing on his chest began to throb wildly, as though reuniting with an old friend. It pulsed and jumped in his chest, transmitting a thought, Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal.

"Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal?"

He watched as the man hurled the dharma seal upward. The unassuming jade seal soared into the churning black clouds and the man’s voice suddenly rang out, "Pristine Heaven’s Pool Below!"

Li Xuanfeng was fully focused on his opponent as he stood with bow drawn, when he saw a small seal rocket into the skies. That spirit artifact was unmistakable, it was Yuan Su's Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal!

Li Xuanfeng’s heart sank slightly as the drifting artifact descended before him. The feathered serpent engraved upon it was so vivid and lifelike and its eyes so domineering and arrogant, that it felt as if it would leap out the next moment.

Hua-la-la...

The gray mist ahead receded, the demonic aura scattered, and a sound like rushing rain filled the air. Tang Shedu gazed skyward with a grim face as azure rain poured down. The sky had turned a hazy blue and misty ice rain fell. A pool of blue water spread beneath their feet.

The rippling pool spread outward, revealing faint, hazy reflections. Murong En, along with all the devil and immortal cultivators, vanished from sight. Only Li Xuanfeng and Tang Shedu remained within this blue-tinted world.

The great seal expanded to the size of a desk. Where the surface had once been blank, four elegant azure seal script words now appeared—delicate and graceful, with soft, flowing brushstrokes.

Eastern Sea Pristine Plume.

A beam of blue light poured down from above like a pillar, drenching the unarmed Tang Shedu. It froze him like a statue. Countless strands of azure light crept along his garments, flowing down into the illusory pool beneath his feet.

The stern man in platinum armor stood before him. With an effortless motion of his ape-like arm, a golden-red rune-carved arrow leapt from his quiver and settled obediently onto the bowstring.

Brilliant red-gold radiance gathered upon the string, like the convergence of ten thousand rays of light. Yet all of it flowed into that single arrow, which was aimed steadily at the center of Tang Shedu’s brow.

Tang Shedu lifted his head in panic, staring at Li Xuanfeng. No matter how the situation had turned, his opponent’s eyes had always been as cold and unyielding as stone. Now too, there was no triumph and no pity. There was only a look of focus.

The crisis of death loomed in his heart. Tang Shedu could even hear a myriad of quarrels buzzing in his ears. Water and fire intertwined before his eyes while gold and stone clashed in brilliance. Seven rainbow-colored mountains hung in the sky, and five divine ladders descended into the blue light to receive him.

Just a little faster...
