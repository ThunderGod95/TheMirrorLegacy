# Chapter 814: Marriage

Li Jiangqian dismissed Wang Quwan to tend to his injuries. After a while, a woman emerged from a side hall, dressed in white robes over a pale cyan skirt. Seeing her, Li Jiangqian finally offered a genuine smile. "Greetings, Aunt Xinghan. And congratulations."

Li Xinghan had only just emerged from her seclusion. She noticed her grand-nephew had already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm and returned his smile with a nod. "I should be the one congratulating you. I just came out and heard what happened with the Sacred Writ Gate... How utterly arrogant."

"Not entirely," Li Jiangqian said, shaking his head. He dismissed the surrounding cultivators and secured the doors. A slight smile touched his lips. "This incident proves the Sacred Writ Gate will never be a significant threat. Daoist Master Zhu Gong might be competent in cultivation, but she is useless at managing a sect. Her followers are nothing but wine-sacks and rice-bags. At their core, they remain overseas demonic cultivators; they don't understand the rules of Jiangnan, nor do they know how to play by them."

"I can tell Zhu Gong is trying to imitate the Chengyun Gate's playbook. But she is not Daoist Master Changyun, and she doesn't have a Zhong Qian working for her. Why was the Chengyun Gate able to transition to the righteous path so quickly? Because Daoist Master Changyun’s demonic cultivators were those who surrendered during the North-South war. As a Daoist Master, he killed as he pleased, utterly ruthless, and thus commanded fear. Daoist Master Zhu Gong, however, dragged her entire household over. Her subordinates are disciples of many years; this one is a junior relative, that one is family. Can she execute them on a whim? A large ship cannot turn easily. Even our Li family must deliberate endlessly just to alter a single system. What hope does the Sacred Writ Gate have!"

Though the Xuanmu Dao lineage was currently ascendant, he clearly held the Sacred Writ Gate in contempt. "They haven't cleansed themselves of their demonic cultivator habits. They are just going over there to stir up trouble. My only concern is that she'll exhaust the resources of the Eastern shore, or that one of her peak lords will go mad and provoke our family. That would be an ugly affair."

Hearing his analysis, Li Xinghan visibly relaxed. With Li Zhouluo gone, Li Zhouming indifferent to clan affairs, and Li Chenghuai returning to seclusion after a brief appearance, she was the only high-generation cultivator left to manage things, and the stress had been weighing on her. If Li Jiangqian was confident, she felt much calmer. "It is good you have a plan... I did have another thought, however. The Sacred Writ Gate is recruiting disciples indiscriminately. I heard both the Yuan and Yu families sent people to join. Should we...?"

Li Jiangqian shook his head slightly. "They still have Foundation Establishment cultivators managing the sect; they won't run it like a sieve. Any people we send won't reach the upper echelon, especially not spies from a family known to have a Purple Mansion cultivator. There is no need to send anyone from the direct lineage and hand them leverage. See if anyone from the branch lineages is willing to make the trip."

"Anyone we send now couldn't compare to Queyi or Quexi; they probably fall far short of Ding Mu. I sent people to Purple Smoke a few days ago to deliver resources to him. I hear that Daoist Cao is treating him quite well, even selecting a top-grade Embyronic Breathing cultivation method for him."

After sighing, he suddenly recalled something else. "Aunt," he asked, a knowing smile playing on his lips, "during the years you were in seclusion... a certain man surnamed Zhuang has been cultivating on the Western shore. He frequently sends letters requesting an audience. Are you aware of this?"

At the mention of this, Li Xinghan looked rather awkward. "I... I am aware," she admitted. "His name is Zhuang Pingye. His father, Zhuang Cheng, is a famous rogue cultivator in the Guyan Great Desert, renowned for his Talisman-Sword techniques. I encountered him that day I went to the desert to eliminate demons. We spoke a few words on the road, and I politely said perhaps we'd meet again. I never expected him to actually follow me to the lake..."

Chasing someone from the desert all the way to the lake—the intention was obvious to everyone. Li Jiangqian hesitated. "I heard he is considered exceptionally handsome, and his appearance and family background are both outstanding. His family’s inherited sword Dao is also said to be unique. In your opinion, Aunt... what is his character like? And... do you find him bothersome?"

He was asking her true feelings. She raised an eyebrow slightly. "He is very polite in all matters, so he isn't bothersome. His family background isn't bad, and he certainly seems sincere at the moment. However, my uncle asked Elder Donghe to write to his acquaintances in the desert. They say his reputation there is merely average. While he can't be called fickle or a womanizer, he is a frequent patron of the flower houses and taverns... But the general atmosphere in that place is like that... so it’s hard to judge."

"He is, after all, a young master from a cultivation family who has achieved Qi Refining. It's inevitable he would indulge in such things while roaming..."

Li Xinghan shook her head. "My assessment is that he sees me as a suitable match. I am not unattractive, my innate talent is comparatively high, and my family status would be beneficial to him. As for genuine affection... I doubt there is much. When I traveled the Northern shore and the desert in the past, I met others of his sort, just none with such an illustrious background. My family members, on the other hand, are quite taken with him."

Li Jiangqian hadn't anticipated this response. "Then what is your intention, Aunt?"

Li Xinghan smiled, pursing her lips. "He appears sincere for the present. Let him continue cultivating on the Western shore. Ultimately, the pursuit of the Immortal Dao is the true path. I am not inside his mind, so I cannot say his thoughts. There is no need to assume the worst of him. Given enough time, the truth will reveal itself."

Li Jiangqian couldn't help but study her again. "I expected you to be somewhat flustered by this. You are taking it very calmly."

"You, child..." Li Xinghan shook her head and laughed. "You underestimate me. Years ago, when I was on the Northern shore cultivating my sword techniques, several 'talents' from the Fei family arranged to 'coincidentally' encounter me. After I rejected one of them, the Fei family supposedly broke his legs. It was horribly embarrassing for me."

Just as they were discussing matters, a messenger rushed in from outside the hall, his legs trembling. He collapsed to his knees. "Family Head! Daoist Master Houfu of the Great Xiukui Monastery... has appeared on the island! He requests an audience with you and the Old Master!"

"What?!" Li Jiangqian froze, exchanging a look of pure shock with Li Xinghan.

'A Daoist Master from the Great Xiukui Monastery... We have no friendship, no connection... why would he come seeking us out?!'

Li Ximing was not known for having a wide circle of acquaintances. This sudden, unexpected visit almost certainly signaled bad news rather than good. A chill settled in Li Jiangqian’s heart.

'This is trouble...'

But a Purple Mansion cultivator had arrived on their island. They had to pay their respects immediately; a moment's delay was unacceptable. Protocol dictated they couldn't simply invite him in; Li Jiangqian and the others had to go out themselves to greet him, as befitted their junior status. While a minor detail, Li Jiangqian knew that to someone like Houfu, who valued appearances, such etiquette was critical.

He hurried from his seat and exited the main hall with Li Xinghan, making for the side palace. Entering the hall, they saw a young man in black shamanistic robes seated in the host’s chair. Standing beside him was a woman dressed in a white blouse and a grey skirt. A gemstone of unknown origin was set upon her brow, accentuating her extreme beauty.

Li Jiangqian led the greeting, bowing low. "This junior, Li Jiangqian of the Moongaze Immortal Clan, the unworthy acting Family Head, pays his respects to Daoist Master Houfu!"

Perhaps because his etiquette was flawless, Houfu seemed polite enough. "Rise," he said with a nod.

Li Jiangqian rose but did not take a seat, standing respectfully to the side. Li Xuanxuan soon rushed over from Qingdu. After the old man paid his respects, Houfu raised an eyebrow. "While this Daoist Master was walking the overseas territories, I chanced upon Daoist Master Zhaojing of your clan, and we journeyed together for a time. Before we parted ways, he heard I was returning inland and entrusted me with a message."

"Thank you, Daoist Master!"

Hearing these words, Li Jiangqian bowed repeatedly in thanks. Li Xuanxuan looked as if a great weight had been lifted from him; realizing Li Ximing was not in grave danger, he was moved almost to tears. Li Xinghan let out a quiet sigh, the worry visibly melting from her expression, replaced by joy. Houfu gestured toward the woman, Xia Shouyu.

"This junior was also entrusted to me by Zhaojing. He said she is to be wed to one of his descendants. She is, herself, the progeny of a high cultivator from overseas."

Li Xuanxuan had already been observing Xia Shouyu. He originally assumed she was some expert from the Great Xiukui Monastery and had been admiring her remarkable bearing. When he heard Houfu's words, his eyes instantly lit up.

'Zhouming is well past the usual age... I thought Ximing wasn't paying attention to the matter... so he had already made arrangements! Excellent, excellent... Now that he has reached the Purple Mansion realm, his planning has become so thorough...'

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian finally felt assured that Li Ximing's condition must be stable, and his own confidence returned. Houfu, however, looked eager to depart.

"My conversations with Zhaojing were amicable," he stated calmly. "He will not be able to return to the lake for some time, but he sent Shouyu back with his instructions. The clan merely needs to remain disciplined and keep a low profile."

"This Daoist Master has urgent matters to attend to in the west. The war on the Great Western Plateau rages unabated. The Shu territories have suffered drought for nine straight years. Months ago, the local clans collapsed, sects have fled, and the people are resorting to trading children for food everywhere. Every moment I delay, thousands more die. I will not waste time with idle talk."

Before they could reply, he stepped into the Great Void and vanished.

As the group offered respectful farewells, Li Jiangqian was already analyzing the Daoist Master's words, his sharp eyes calculating.

'A great drought in the Shu lands means no rain is falling. When the land is this parched and the springs run dry... this is a sign of the Pristine Water Fruition Attainment.'

While he was contemplating the status of Pristine Water, Li Xuanxuan had already stepped toward Xia Shouyu. "This old master is Li Xuanxuan. Miss..."

"I wouldn't dare!" Xia Shouyu quickly curtsied, retrieving two scrolls from her sleeve—one red, one gold. She held them in her palms, presenting the golden scroll to Li Xuanxuan first. "Old Master, this is what the Daoist Master instructed me to deliver to the family. The golden scroll is for the clan here at the lake. The red scroll... is my marriage contract."

She showed no trace of shyness, speaking with perfect composure. "It is for the clan disciple of the 'Zhou' generation. His name is Ming."

Li Xuanxuan saw his guess had been largely correct. Accepting the golden scroll, he nodded and beamed. "Miss... that child is the Daoist Master's own direct grandson. His only one."

A flicker of surprise crossed Xia Shouyu’s eyes. She paused for a beat, then the corners of her mouth lifted in a smile. Stepping forward slightly, she requested, "Has he emerged from seclusion? I hope the family might arrange a meeting..."

Li Xuanxuan was already holding the scroll. Li Jiangqian extended a hand toward the main hall, smiling. "Please..."

Houfu’s visit seemed to have banished the oppressive gloom hanging over the Li clan leaders. Even their steps felt lighter as the group returned. Li Xuanxuan followed behind, unable to resist unrolling the scroll to read.

Li Ximing mentioned no urgent crises. He stated that his injuries were largely healed and the clan should not worry. He was cultivating externally and could not return for some time, instructing Ding Weizeng and Cui Jueyin to watch over the clan.

He did, however, specifically mention the Capital immortals Dao, ordering Li Jiangqian and the others not to let relations with the north become overly hostile. They were to ease tensions where possible:

'Changxiao is currently scheming from the sidelines, and the situation remains unclear. There is no need to drag Yehui into this, lest we find ourselves facing a wolf at the front gate and a tiger at the back, caught in an impossible dilemma.'

Li Xuanxuan rolled the golden scroll closed just as they entered the main hall. Li Jiangqian accepted it to read while they awaited the return of the messenger sent to fetch Li Zhouming.

A long time passed with no reply. Li Xuanxuan began to feel a sense of dread. Sure enough, the messenger finally returned, looking deeply embarrassed. He approached Li Jiangqian and whispered, "We could not retrieve the Young Master... he went out for leisure... and has not returned from the lake perimeter..."

Given the Li family's current control over both Qingdu and Yuting mountains, it was impossible that they *couldn't* find Li Zhouming. It only meant he was indulging in debauchery again, leading the messenger to phrase it as "could not retrieve." Li Jiangqian felt a flush of secondhand embarrassment.

Xia Shouyu, however, proved exceptionally sharp. She smiled lightly. "It is no matter. This is the perfect time of year for an outing. I shall accompany you. There is no need to disturb the Young Master's enjoyment."

Her words immediately told Li Xuanxuan that this woman had her own mind. She had covered for Li Zhouming's absence now, but the issue would have to be faced eventually. It was better to just be open about it. He sighed internally. "Indeed... It is best we go together."

Li Jiangqian, having just finished the scroll, put it away with a thoughtful expression. "If I may ask," he inquired, "your esteemed Dao... from which immortal mountain or pavilion overseas does it hail? That we might pay our respects to its name."

Xia Shouyu offered a tactful smile. "My elders merely cultivate upon an immortal mountain; it is not worthy of being called a great pavilion. Daoist Master Zhaojing has shown immense kindness to both my family and myself. The three Daoist Masters were discussing the profound mysteries when the topic of matrimony arose, and thus this match was bestowed..."

"As for the lineage my elders follow... this junior worries that revealing it might compromise the Daoist Master’s location. For the moment... it is not convenient to disclose. When the Daoist Master returns or sends word, then I can speak clearly. My apologies."

It was a watertight deflection. Li Jiangqian smiled and nodded. "Not at all. Although the rites are not complete, you are practically a member of our senior generation. How can you apologize to a junior? You honor me!"

The group left the main island together, taking to the air. Just as they ascended, they saw a streak of heavenly light racing in from the lake's edge. It was Li Zhouming, dressed in a flamboyant red robe with his signature fan dangling at his waist, flying frantically back toward the island.

Li Jiangqian spotted him instantly and knew the next few moments were going to be excruciatingly awkward.

Li Xuanxuan had tried reasoning, pleading, and scolding, but he was utterly helpless against this particular descendant. His anger began to simmer again, but with Xia Shouyu present, he decided to grant the boy a sliver of dignity and simply turned his head away.

Xia Shouyu appeared entirely unbothered. She inclined her head slightly in a formal greeting. "Greetings, Young Master."

Li Zhouming had been looking guiltily at Li Xuanxuan, wondering why the old man wasn't already screaming at him. Before he could puzzle it out, his gaze landed on the stunning woman before him. His eyes lit up with delight. "Greetings, Miss..."

As he drew closer, he realized Xia Shouyu was already at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Despite his own noble status, he was only a Qi Refining cultivator casually addressing a Foundation Establishment expert as 'Miss.' He suddenly felt insecure, but Xia Shouyu merely smiled and nodded, appearing somewhat shy and endearing, which immediately caused him to lift his chin a fraction higher.

Li Xuanxuan shot him a warning glare—though it was doubtful the boy understood it—and announced in a gruff voice: "This is Fairy Xia, the beloved daughter of an overseas immortal cultivator. She possesses outstanding talent, profound cultivation, a gentle temperament, and beauty like a celestial. This... is the marriage your Grandfather arranged for you. She came today specifically to meet you... and just which gutter were *you* playing in!"

"Huh?"

Li Zhouming was completely stunned. While his grandfather, Li Ximing, had provided him with an esteemed status, he had offered little actual attention; Li Xuanxuan had been the one to raise him. Hearing this sudden news, a delighted grin split his face.

'So it was Grandfather! Grandfather’s divine power is truly vast... what magnanimity, the true bearing of a Daoist Master! Wonderful, wonderful! He actually found me such a gentle and adorable wife! I will never curse him in my heart again... Never! And I won't let Father curse him either! I'll praise him to everyone I meet... What a good Grandfather, hehe.'
