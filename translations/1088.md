# Chapter 1088: A Dream

The colors of the sky had bled into a muddy slurry. The white of the Supreme Yin and the frost of the Cold Qi were churned into layers of somber gray, like a shattered porcelain salt cellar, bright flecks and dull chips scattered in a chaotic mess.

The battle had already raged for two hours.

Perhaps the pill had been exceptionally effective, or perhaps Daoist Master Yuanshang's foundation was simply that deep. In any case, the demonic creature was incredibly powerful. It had repeatedly tried to tear free, smashing its head into Seajade Peak on Chunyi Island. It struck the mountain with such force that the peak split in two, triggering massive landslides and sending tsunamis crashing into the shores.

But in the end, it was subdued.

Heavy black shadows gathered in the sky, coalescing into a great, oppressive hall that pressed down upon a single point of white light. Within the light stood an old man, his hair unbound, a look of utter confusion on his face. Heavy, pitch-black chains were wrapped around his body, weighing his very form down.

The demonic creatures that Duanmu Kui and Si Boxiu had become, while capable of speech, were arrogant and wild. They felt no fear of death, no complex emotions. Even when an agent of the Underworld appeared, they had cackled and attacked, right up until the moment they were seized and dragged down to the Underworld.

This creature, however, merely stood silently within the great hall. It dragged its heavy chains, stumbling like a frail, sick old man, its head darting left and right. Its mind seemed trapped in a storm of overlapping phantoms.

"My lords?"

He suddenly lurched three steps to the left and looked up at the sky, but his vision met only crushing blackness. He stumbled back to the right, glancing around frantically, and cried out, "My lords! I am innocent!"

He seemed to have lost his sanity, growing rapidly agitated. He dragged the heavy chains back and forth, slamming into the walls of the hall, shaking the entire structure with deafening rumbles. His heart-rending roars filled the air.

"My lords!"

"Come out! Why won't you see me! Come out!"

"Five hundred years! It's been five hundred years... I'm no different! I'm just another Guanyu, aren't I? Why? Why do you humiliate me this way!"

His words... they were identical to Daoist Master Yuanshang's!

"My lords!"

His voice was so desolate, so terrifying, that it echoed through the hall and rattled the great doors. The prison couldn't seem to contain the light of the Supreme Yin radiating from him. His cries seeped through the cracks of the doors, thundering before the steps.

"I have achieved the Dao! Why won't you see me? I have achieved the Dao!"

But no matter how he roared and struggled, the heavy chains held him fast. With every inch they tightened, a sickening, teeth-grinding crunch echoed from his body.

The demonic creature collapsed to its knees, face tilted to the sky, as if to shout a name. But the name dissolved the instant it left his lips, dissipating into plumes of gray-white qi. He suddenly bowed his head and began to vomit violently.

_Retch._

He spat out a snow-white magpie. The bird had red feet, black eyes, and feathers like a sliver of the moon. It hopped twice, as if relishing its freedom, and vanished.

Next came white jade, bright as the moon. Then profound books covered in runes, followed by spirit lotuses of deep blue and white. One by one, fragments of bright white palace halls were expelled from his mouth. But within the impossibly vast, dark hall, these visions were no bigger than a fist. They rumbled as they fell, shattering into pools of white light on the floor.

When he finally vomited a vision of a swaying osmanthus village onto the ground, the eye-catching Mystic Pill at last came tumbling out, clattering onto the floor. The creature raised its head one last time.

"My lords! Chunyi is innocent!"

His wail was swallowed by the rolling black qi, fading into nothing.

_BOOM!_

As the Mystic Pill hit the ground, the great, heavy doors of the hall slammed shut. The hall vanished from the sky without a trace. The oppressive clouds retreated, the moonlight dimmed, and the stars grew faint. All the colors of the world seemed to scatter like smoke, as if the entire ordeal had been nothing but a dream.

The top half of the peak, shorn clean off, had already sunk into the sea, leaving only a jagged stump on the island. The earth veins and the fire vein, which should have erupted in a frenzy, were nowhere to be seen. The baleful qi within the mountain had frozen solid, transforming into a pure black, metallic stone.

Only then did the lone sword cultivator standing in the ruins become visible, his gaze fixed quietly on the night sky.

The bustling crowd of Daoist Masters, who had come from all corners of the land, had vanished like a flock of swallows returning to the sky. Not a trace remained. The mountain and the Great Void were utterly empty, save for the low, icy wind. Daoist Master Fuxuan, Xi Lingjiao, stood frozen in place like a statue.

Faint, hurried footsteps broke the silence. A young man walked forward, his face streaked with tears. He bowed low.

"The Great Daoist Master... has undergone Feather Transformation!"

_RUMBLE!_

It was as if his words had startled the very mechanisms of the world. A muffled thunderclap rolled across the sky, and fine snow began to fall. Xi Lingjiao turned his head to look at him.

"Che Hong... Master took a pill."

The young man just covered his face and wept.

"Martial Uncle! He did! It was one of Daoist Master Zhaojing'sâ€”a mystic elixir!"

Xi Lingjiao stumbled, taking an unsteady step. He squeezed his eyes shut as tears streamed from the corners.

"So, it's true."

_RUMBLE!_

The winter thunder grew louder, and the blizzard intensified. Goose-feather snow began to blanket every inch of the ruined courtyards and pavilions. Cultivators of the Chunyi Dao Gate emerged, walking silently over the snow. They exchanged no words, merely lowering their heads to begin clearing the rubble.

Xi Lingjiao stood motionless in the wind. Soon, he saw a beam of Heavenly Light approaching. The Daoist Master in the white-gold robe was the first to return. His expression was complicated as he cupped his hands from afar.

"Daoist friend, my condolences."

Xi Lingjiao regarded him quietly before speaking.

"Many thanks, Zhaojing. If not for this pill, Master's final wish to achieve the Dao... could not have been fulfilled."

Li Ximing looked as if he wanted to speak, but he held his tongue, his expression heavy. Others might have fled, catching only glimpses with their arts or hearing fragments from afar. But he, Li Ximing, possessed the Immortal Mirror. He had seen everything. The scene inside that spectral hall had made his blood run cold.

His expression deeply conflicted, he said,

"The Great Daoist Master's... Dao-Profundity was truly superb. Even when... afflicted by that Golden Malignance, he seemed exactly as he was in life..."

Xi Lingjiao's footsteps faltered. He turned his head, as if trying to discern whether Li Ximing was genuinely ignorant or mocking him. After a long moment, he said,

"That was the Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic, the root method of our Dao. It is also the source of the Woven Jade Radiance Chapter's arts. By using this Dao to seek Gold, one can advance to become a True Immortal who has attained the Supreme Yin Dao. As a fallback... there is a one-in-ten-thousand chance of becoming a Supreme Yin Woven Jade Vassal."

He closed his eyes briefly.

"The Golden Malignance it became possessed his memories, but it was not him. If you must have a comparison, Zhaojing... it is in the same category as an emissary of the Underworld, only far higher in status."

Li Ximing was stunned.

'In that case... why would the Underworld capture him?'

Xi Lingjiao seemed to read his mind. His heart was filled with desolation, and his voice turned to ice.

"The Underworld is a supreme Immortal Department. The fact that they acted means Master failed even in his retreat. He truly failed, becoming a true demonic creature. That is why he was taken."

He spoke the words evenly, but the hand behind his back was clenched stiff. Beside him, Che Hong turned even paler, biting his lip in silence. A chill ran down Li Ximing's spine, and he found himself unable to reply. An oppressive silence fell, broken only by the soft shushing of the snow.

Xi Lingjiao shifted his stance. The sword cultivator seemed to wrestle with himself for several moments, his expression conflicted.

"Zhaojing, you are from the Ning Li... Have you heard any rumors? Do you have any idea... what my Master meant by 'retribution' as he died?"

How could Li Ximing possibly know? He was still struggling with his own thoughts. He shook his head firmly.

"The Great Daoist Master's intentions were profound. It is difficult for us to fathom..."

Fuxuan lowered his gaze.

"Che Hong told me of your request, Zhaojing. We agreed to an exchange, and we will not break our word. Che Hong!"

The young man immediately stepped forward and gestured for Li Ximing to follow, leaving Fuxuan standing alone in the snow, utterly silent.

Li Ximing bowed to him, his own heart feeling frozen. The Immortal Artifact in his possession was from the Immortal Mansion, a fact he dared not reveal. The Chunyi Dao Gate were staunch supporters of the Immortal Mansion, yet they had suffered such a grievance. A profound chill settled in Li Ximing's heart.

'It seems,' he thought, 'they truly believe Daoist Master Yuanshang died in the process of becoming some Supreme Yin Vassal...'

_Vmmm..._

The hum of a great formation activating snapped Li Ximing from his thoughts. He looked up to find he was already inside the Chunyi Dao Gate's inner sanctum. The ground was paved with white bricks, and groves of Moon Laurel trees grew everywhere. Before them stood a small, pure white pavilion.

Che Hong visibly composed himself, though his voice remained hoarse.

"Seajade Peak has collapsed, so we have few places to host an honored guest. Please, enter the pavilion and take a seat."

Li Ximing quickly bowed and nodded.

The pavilion was spartan, with few decorations, containing only a couple of jade tables. After the two Daoist Masters were seated, Che Hong asked,

"Daoist Master... is there a particular item you urgently require?"

Li Ximing pondered for a moment before asking, "Do you have any spirit items suitable for a Whole Pill?"

Li Ximing had received word from Liu Changdie some time ago. Liu Changdie had been making inquiries for him at the World's Navel and found a Whole Pill spirit item called Vermillion Temple Golden Sand.

Unfortunately, the owner, Cang Tiaozi, was driving a hard bargain. He refused to trade it for anything other than Liu Changdie's One-Qi White Globe Stone, so the deal had stalled. Li Ximing had even asked for a list of other items Cang Tiaozi might accept, but they were all things he had never even heard of. The chances seemed slim.

Hearing this, Che Hong raised an eyebrow and shook his head.

"Back then..."

As soon as Che Hong spoke those two words, Li Ximing knew what was coming. It had been traded to Daoist Master Qiushui. And sure enough, that was the case. The Golden Feather Sect's wealth and influence were terrifying, and Daoist Master Yuanshang had been on good terms with Qiushui. Of course he would agree to a trade.

However, Li Que'wan had given him good news when she arrived for the ceremony. Her cultivation speed with the secret art was horrifyingly fast. She had already completed the Rainbow Throne technique, and the final 'Plain Pill' stage wouldn't take much longer. Her seclusion was imminent!

That meant his most urgent task... was still acquiring the spirit item for Li Que'wan!

After a moment's thought, he retrieved Liu Changdie's letter from his sleeve. He copied the list of items Cang Tiaozi wanted and handed it to Che Hong.

"I require one of the items on this list, to trade with another Daoist Master..."

Che Hong took the list, and his brow furrowed slightly.

"This is for Senior Cang Tiaozi, is it not?"

Li Ximing was surprised, but then he considered that the number of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the world was, after all, finite. It was reasonable for them to know each other. He cupped his hands and nodded.

Che Hong clasped his hands.

"This will be simple. Senior Cang Tiaozi is a good friend of my Martial Uncle. Furthermore, the Great Daoist Master once saved his life. Leave it to me. If all goes well, I can complete the exchange for you within a few days."

Cang Tiaozi wasn't holding the Vermillion Temple Golden Sand for any particular purpose; he was just hoarding a rare commodity to trade for something he truly wanted. Li Ximing was overjoyed.

"Excellent!"

Che Hong was clearly still shrouded in the grief of his master's passing. He offered no smile and wasted no time on pleasantries. After a brief, clipped exchange, he hesitated and then said,

"Zhaojing, you are also an expert in the Dao of Alchemy, so I will be direct. The spirit items used for that Mystic Pill were of an extremely high grade, worth more than the Vermillion Temple Golden Sand. However, those items were not used for just one pill... Time was short, and I did not examine it closely, so I cannot be sure of its remaining medicinal strength. But I will not wrong you. We will consider it an exchange for our island's specialty, the 'Nightshade Spirit Grass.' I will have it delivered to the lake!"

Li Ximing naturally had no objection. He bowed, and taking care not to intrude further, he exited the inner formation and departed. As he flew up from Chunyi Island, he could still see Fuxuan below, standing silently, watching the heavy snow fall.

Xi Lingjiao stood motionless in the snow, clutching his sword. He took a small box from his sleeve and caught a handful of the thick, falling snow, his gaze lost in the distance. The snow piled up on the ruins of the broken mountain. After an eternity, the sword cultivator finally murmured,

"Master... you kept this from me... how bitter a secret..."

---

The world was dim, lost in a gloomy twilight.

A grotto-heaven of pale blue and white appeared, adorned everywhere with delicate, pale osmanthus blossoms. Jade tables and desks were arranged neatly. In the center lay a large, clear pool, its surface rippling with a rolling white radiance.

Inside the grotto-heaven, a middle-aged man knelt respectfully. He held up a jade box and said,

"Master ordered me to present the 'White-Hair Moon-Sprout Mystic Pill' and the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity, to repay the Great Daoist Master's kindness!"

His voice echoed. From the depths of the grotto, a man with his hands clasped behind his back turned around. His skin was fair, his features handsome, and on his brow rested a silver osmanthus mark. He wore a magnificent robe and carried an air of grace, the very picture of an immortal. He casually helped the kneeling man up, shaking his head.

"What is the meaning of this? I have told you before... I have no designs on the Supreme Yin."

The middle-aged man persisted.

"Senior, you saved us from dire straits... and you are also on the quest for Gold. Master recalled that our Dao possesses a Mystic Pill and a spirit item left by the Ancestor, which could be of great benefit to you! With the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity paired with the 'White-Hair Moon-Sprout Mystic Pill,' you can surely emulate the Dao lineage of our predecessor and achieve the Dao!"

_Vmmm..._

The entire scene rippled and dissolved, reforming as an image within a mirror held in a pair of pale hands. With a light brush of those hands, the memories scattered, reflecting the peerless scenery of the immortal pavilions surrounding them.

This was the world within the Immortal Mirror.

Lu Jiangxian stood up, his expression distant.

'The Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity... The Chunyi Dao Gate's ancestor, Jiequn, never used it.'

'And the three strands of Longaeva Harmonizing Light White Hair that Yuanshang mentioned... the one that was used was not consumed by Jiequn, but by... the Great Daoist Master from the Ning Li who aided the Chunyi Dao Gate all those years ago: Great Daoist Master Guanyu!'

This affair had to be traced back to Daoist Master Yuanshang's own master, Yanyi.

Yanyi had been a minor cultivator in the Chunyi Dao Gate with mediocre talent. But he had an unexpected fortuitous encounter. In a divine Immortal Palace realm, a deity appeared in his dreams and gifted him a casket. Inside were three items:

'The Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity, the Longaeva Harmonizing Light White Hair, and the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness.'

What exactly the deity said, Yuanshang never knew. Even this backstory was something he had pieced together from his master's fragmented dying words.

Yanyi took the three items and consumed the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness. From that day, he rose through the ranks, quickly becoming the leader of the failing Chunyi Dao Gate. He then integrated the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity into the sect's Dao lineage, claiming it was a lost art passed down by the Ancestor.

It was then that master and disciple met Great Daoist Master Guanyu of the Ning Li.

This Great Daoist Master had already cultivated four divine abilities and was preparing to cultivate Lesser Yin as his final one, to seek an Intercalary Position. But Yanyi's heart was stirred. He tempted Guanyu with the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity. In the end, he used one of the strands of Longaeva Harmonizing Light White Hair to refine a 'White-Hair Moon-Sprout Mystic Pill,' convincing Guanyu to change his path and seek the Supreme Yin instead.

In the end, Great Daoist Master Guanyu was utterly defeated and perished. Yanyi, for some unknown reason, found himself stuck at the Purple Mystery stage, unable to advance. He finally died in a battle while gambling for a new opportunity.

'In his youth, Yuanshang had assumed his master Yanyi wanted to seek the Supreme Yin himself and had simply used Guanyu to test the waters. But as he slowly uncovered the truth of the past, Yuanshang realized something was wrong.'

'The entire scheme had been set for Great Daoist Master Guanyu from the very beginning. His master Yanyi had mediocre talent; the "lords" above had never even considered him capable of achieving the Dao! Even the deity from the dream... had simply instructed him to pass off the opportunity as Jiequn's lost legacy and present it to Guanyu!'

Yuanshang's suspicion didn't come from any great insight gained by interacting with disciples of powerful factions. It came almost entirely from his master's dying words:

"The deity bestowed the Dao, but I cannot achieve it. The remaining merit now falls to you. If the day comes when you attain the Dao... you will be taught by the deity personally... You must attain the Dao! You _must_ attain the Dao!"

'If Yanyi had any "merit" to speak of... it could only have been his role in convincing Guanyu to pursue the Supreme Yin.'

This history remained a secret locked deep in Yuanshang's heart. His master had other disciples, and the lie about the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity was already deeply entrenched. In the end, he remained silent and upheld his master's deception. It was, after all, still a legitimate method for seeking the Dao.

But as the affair with Li Jiangqun sent ripples through Jiangnan, Yuanshang received some unexpected information. Doubt began to creep into his heart.

'Is the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity truly a path to achieve the Dao? Or... could it merely be a tool used by some great power to probe the Supreme Yin's Fruition Attainment?'

It was precisely because of this that when Chi Buzi delivered the Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch, he was already deeply suspicious. All that remained was a final shred of uncertainty. He pretended to refuse the branch... and then Li Ximing arrived, offering a Supreme Yin Mystic Pill. This final act shattered his last doubts.

'It was all an arrangement! A deliberate plan just to probe the Supreme Yin! Alas... they had turned him into a weapon to be used against his own side!'

To make matters worse, Li Ximing was from the Ning Li, just as his master had offered the 'White-Hair Moon-Sprout Mystic Pill' to Guanyu... And... his own disciple, Fuxuan, was already in the mid-Purple Mansion Realm, just as he himself had been!

At that moment, Yuanshang, though ignorant of who was pulling the strings, saw the entire scheme clearly. Yet he dared not speak. How could the entire Chunyi Dao Gate suffer for his personal will? Did the one seeking the Supreme Yin _have_ to be from their sect? Fuxuan's temperament was outwardly gentle but inwardly unyielding; he was fierce. If a single word slipped, who knew what disaster it would unleash?

'In the end, all that awaits is suppression... "Personally taught by the deity"... it was all just an idle fantasy, a petty scheme!'

Lu Jiangxian's gaze was complex, his hands clasped behind his back, his heart heavy.

But was his own situation not also part of a calculation? Both of those "moon radiances" had come from his own hand.

'When Li Ximing obtained the Moon Orchid back then, it was indeed a spirit item that possessed a high "position" but lacked substance. I intended for it to complement the Pure Qi pill within him, adding a Supreme Yin grand pill to his foundation while minimizing my own exposure. But with that complement, his life-mandate became whole. By leveraging my own "position," the result was naturally comparable to a Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch!'

In other words, by consuming this pill, Yuanshang had already fulfilled the requirements of the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity. He had successfully queried the Supreme Yin!

And not only had he queried it, Lu Jiangxian himself had felt it!

'What Dingjiao told Chi Buzi was also a half-truth. It's not that the Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch allows one to deduce the reality of the Supreme Yin after achieving the Dao.'

'This kind of query must be performed five times to calculate the location of the Donghua Heaven that is anchored to the Supreme Yin's position. Counting Guanyu and now Yuanshang... Fuxuan would only be the third!'

He had pondered this for a long time, and clarity was setting in.

Lu Jiangxian had also seen the full extent of Yuanshang's "achievement." With a flick of his wrist, a jade slip appeared in his hand. On it, colorful, runic characters shifted and changed:

Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic!

This was the root method of the Chunyi Dao Gate. The reason Lu Jiangxian knew all these details was precisely because of this text.

Lu Jiangxian had watched Yuanshang's breakthrough from the sidelines. The moment Yuanshang circulated the Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic, Lu Jiangxian had felt a sudden connection. The path of "advancing" to become a Supreme Yin True Monarch was vague, but the path of "retreating" to become a Supreme Yin Woven Jade Vassal... it was pointing directly at him.

Had he been willing, he could have revealed his true form on the spot and inducted the man.

Lu Jiangxian had been profoundly shocked. Upon closer inspection, he had even detected the distinct 'flavor' of a sacrifice. The offering, in this case, was Yuanshang's own life-mandate.

The Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic was, in essence, a Moon-Ascension art. It was also a complete, ancient immortal cultivation method that Lu Jiangxian had obtained. By following this text, a cultivator could not only forge divine abilities but also use their very life-mandate to seek Gold.

However, the "gold" one sought was not to attain a formal position. Instead, it was to sense the Great Void and entrust one's Metallic Essence to the aspect of the Supreme Yin. In doing so, one would attain a 'side-door' Dao, much like an Adjudicator of the Underworld. This path had its own unique title: Woven Jade Immortal!

The idea of the Chunyi Dao Gate cultivators was to merge their own cultivation methods with the Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic. While their path resembled the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, this classic gave them an option. At the final moment of sensing their life-mandate, they could take a gamble and switch paths to become a Woven Jade Immortal. Because of this, the Chunyi Dao Gate cultivators secretly referred to their path as the 'Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao,' though they never spoke of it publicly.

'The idea is actually brilliant. Perhaps the ancestor Jiequn studied the Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic and left this path for his descendants. The modifications are quite elegant... it's just that the difficulty is astronomically high.'

It was because of this intimate connection between the two paths that Yuanshang, supported by the grand pill, was able to complete every step of the Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic. His life's work was infused into his True Spirit. When he perished and his True Spirit emerged, it was instantly illuminated by the Name Ascending Stone and drawn into the Immortal Mirror.

'His life-mandate twisted into a demonic creature and was taken by the Underworld, but his True Spirit... it arrived here!'

And that was why the entire truth behind the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity, the complete, unabridged text of the _Wall-Below Woven Jade Dao-Classic_, and even the full history of the Chunyi Dao Gate and Great Daoist Master Guanyu... all of it had fallen into Lu Jiangxian's hands.

Lu Jiangxian slowly raised his hand. In his palm rested a tiny speck of brilliant light.

"The True Spirit and the life's work of a Great Daoist Master of the Supreme Yin, one who had completed all five methods and attained Metallic Essence... At last, I no longer have to rely on Dangjiang to put on a front. And certain... hypotheses... now have a foundation!"
