# Chapter 1243: Divergent Paths

The water and sky were one color, the tide was calm.

Chongzhou Island was a great island in the overseas regions, once a fiefdom of the Dragon-kin before it was bestowed upon the Cui Clan. After many years of cultivation, it had become a land of plenty, and its area had expanded even more after the celestial rift in the Northern Sea and the receding waters of the Eastern Sea.

Cultivators came and went, riding beams of heavenly light, their brilliant radiance a well-known sight overseas. Yet, along the white stone steps leading up to the peak, figures were sparse. In the highest hall, a grand immortal throne stood, upon which sat a Daoist Master.

This man had a full head of white hair, and his divine ability felt gentle and refined; it was none other than the Cui Clan's Purple Mansion master, Cui Changfu.

Although Cui Changfu had only recently broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, he had been far too old when he first began his pursuit of the Dao. Thus, even though he had now attained a divine ability, his appearance was that of an old man, with a full head of white hair and a worried expression as he quietly held a jade cup.

There was no other reason for it; his path on the Dao was fraught with worry!

His, Cui Changfu's, innate talent was not considered high. He had relied on his strength of character, on the lingering grace of his ancestors, and one might even say on the path paved by that White Qilin to attain the Dao. He had long heard that the divine abilities of the Purple Mansion Realm were difficult to cultivate, but only when he began cultivating one himself did he truly understand the meaning of difficulty!

When he consumed the pills gifted by Li Zhouwei, his dharma power had been truly scorching, and his divine ability billowed, giving him the distinct impression of great progress. He had even felt a little smug. But once those pills were gone, Cui Changfu felt as if he had plunged into an abyss… The sheer difficulty of this grinding work was such that the Dao-Profundity he had built in the first five years of taking the pills took him another thirty to match. All told, his divine ability was still less than halfway to true mastery!

‘This divine ability… without the support of spiritual resources, this is simply impossible for a person to cultivate!’

He, Cui Changfu, had attained the Dao late in life and was now, in the blink of an eye, approaching three hundred years old. Everyone said the Purple Mystery was a difficult threshold to cross, and he estimated that even if he cultivated for his entire life, he wouldn't even be able to glimpse its shadow!

In truth, he knew that if he could gather enough spiritual resources, exchanging them for pills from Moongaze would not be a problem… But when he truly became a Purple Mansion master, and the Dragon-kin came to stand on his island, what was the first thing they asked for?

Purple Mansion spiritual resources!

‘The Dragon-kin are demon beasts; they don't bother with the Daoist traditions and decorum of the Three Profoundities on the mainland. With two Dragon Monarchs presiding over everything, do these dragon princes and grandsons truly lack for Foundation Establishment baubles? They're just exploiting us who wield divine abilities.’

‘They come once every decade or so. Last time it was for this lord's birthday, this time for that one's longevity celebration. They come and demand things, and if you have nothing, it's held against you… The overseas regions are already barren, so where am I supposed to find so many spiritual resources? Am I even supposed to continue my cultivation?’

He had also inquired around and learned that the Purple Mansion demon beasts under the sea were not nearly so prosperous; his Cui Clan was receiving special treatment… Otherwise, how could he, Cui Changfu, still sit here so leisurely on this island? He could even attend banquets and sip spiritual wine to recover some of his losses… He would have long ago been dragged off to patrol the four seas!

It was only at this moment that he finally understood why Cui Yushan had distanced himself from the Cui Clan after attaining the Dao, refusing to be entangled in the slightest bit of karma, remaining in the Western Sea year after year without ever returning.

‘If we don't align ourselves with the mainland, when will we ever hope to turn our fortunes around?’

He was infinitely worried, his brow furrowed in silence. Beside him, another old man sat in a chair, a smile in his eyes.

“Daoist Master, since your achievement, all the various factions have become so docile these past few decades… They’ve all come to offer congratulations, and even the envoys from the Dragon-kin have become more courteous…”

He let out a deep sigh.

“If Grandfather were here… he could finally rest in peace!”

Cui Changfu quietly held his teacup, the sorrow in his heart not showing on his face. It was only when the old man mentioned their ancestor that his expression shifted, and he shook his head.

“It's only natural for the factions to be docile, now that I am a Purple Mansion master. But the change in the Dragon-kin's attitude… that's not because of a minor master of divine abilities emerging from this backwater of ours! Let alone an old man with a single divine ability, even if a Great Daoist Master were to appear, when they choose not to show respect, they are utterly ruthless!”

Cui Changyan was momentarily at a loss for words, and he silently bowed his head.

“It’s still because of that one…”

“That is natural.”

Cui Changfu’s expression was complicated as he spoke.

“If Jueyin had failed, do you think the envoys who came would have cracked even the slightest smile? To say nothing of how relaxed things have been these past few years, with our tributes greatly reduced.”

Cui Changyan lowered his head as the Daoist Master sighed.

“For every day Jueyin does not emerge, my heart is filled with a day's worth of panic.”

Upon careful consideration, Cui Jueyin’s foundation was actually far superior to Cui Changfu's. First, he was a prodigy of his generation, having reached the Foundation Establishment Realm at a young age. He was also an important minister who had assisted King Wei—that same King Wei who had just crushed the northern cultivators, shaking the entire world! It could be said that at this critical juncture, as the grand design of Bright Yang neared its zenith, the likelihood of this direct heir of the Cui Clan breaking through was terrifyingly high!

‘This is the final test; we will see if he can pass it… Although he is brilliant and his experience is far broader than that of the disciples on this island, it is for that very reason that he alone has witnessed the might of the Wu Light with his own eyes… and that's hardly a good thing.’

‘For him, this is a trial of the heart. As long as he can overcome his fear and pass through it, there will be nothing left to fear in the future.’

After all, how was he, Cui Changfu, any different? The Cui Clan had failed time and again over the years, and the greatest reason for it was that the pain and fear brought upon them by the matter of Bright Yang over the past millennium was simply too deep!

‘Born here and raised here, how could we be without fear? Even a heart unhindered by the Dao requires certain qualifications…’

He sat quietly in the main seat. An unknown amount of time passed before he heard a stir from the Great Void. A sheet of golden light descended, and a middle-aged man appeared before the hall.

The man had a rather refined bearing. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, a smile on his face as he spoke.

“Is the Daoist Master on the island? Yangya of the Western Sea's Cui Clan has come to visit.”

Cui Changfu's expression changed, a look of shocked suspicion in his eyes. He rose to his feet and said softly:

“So, Clan Uncle has come.”

“Hah.”

Yangya strode forward, the aura around him billowing, and said with a laugh:

“I wouldn't dare claim such a title!”

The meeting of the two was palpably awkward. Cui Changfu had already prepared himself to never see the man again in his lifetime and certainly never expected him to return any spiritual items or Spiritual Artifacts to the clan. He never imagined the man would one day set foot on the island again. His face expressionless, he said:

“In that case, what brings the Daoist Master here unannounced?”

The same old man who had once been so deferential was now challenging him, yet Yangya showed no change in expression. His face impassive, he said:

“I was in seclusion cultivating my divine ability these past few days and was unaware such a momentous event had occurred. Congratulations, Fellow Daoist, but there is a matter I must address.”

“When the family split all those years ago, the assets were divided fairly. However, Chongzhou had no Purple Mansion master. Out of consideration for our shared ancestry, I worried the spiritual items of our Dao Lineage would be stolen, so I held them for safekeeping. Now that a Purple Mansion master has arisen, it is only right that I return them.”

Cui Changfu’s face was devoid of joy or sorrow as he replied coldly:

“Then I must thank the Daoist Master.”

Nearby, Cui Changyan knelt on the floor, watching the two Purple Mansion masters of his clan speak with such coldness, as if they were on the verge of turning on one another. Hearing them, his heart felt as if it were being twisted by a knife, and his old eyes reddened. He dared not speak, and could only remain kneeling.

Yangya, however, was far more composed. He swept a casual glance at him and said:

“One of the spiritual items was delivered long ago. Though I don't know which of you used it, my memory is clear. There are still two portions of spiritual resources, which I will return for now. Another spiritual item was lent out by me, but I have found its trail and will have it returned within two years.”

“However… there is also a Spiritual Artifact, which originally belonged to Chongzhou, that I will return today.”

He was then seen taking a stone box from his sleeve and placing it gently on the table. Indifferently, he said:

“Second, the mainland and overseas regions are in turmoil. The eastern and western seas are far apart, and my lifespan wanes. I do not know when I might fall. It is too dangerous for my descendants to travel here alone. This trip, I have come to take the ancestral tablets of our line.”

As soon as these words were spoken, even Cui Changfu fell silent. The old man stared at his clan uncle, a man of similar age to himself, and clenched his jaw without saying a word.

“Thump!”

It was Cui Changyan at the side who could bear it no longer. He shuffled forward on his knees, grabbed the Daoist Master's leg, and cried out:

“Why must it come to this! Why! Clan Uncle Yushan… back when you had not yet attained the Dao, we traveled to the Western Sea to visit Granduncle, and we spoke with you so warmly. How did we reach this point today!”

“Both our branches have Purple Mansion masters! We should be of one heart and mind, advancing and retreating as one. It is bad enough that we face our own difficulties in the east and west… must it truly come to severing all ties!”

Cui Changfu turned his head away, his expression dark and unreadable. A flicker of emotion crossed Yangya’s eyes, and he spoke through gritted teeth:

“What is the use of bringing this up with me? The matter of Wei-Li, did I not warn you? We finally managed to call Jueyin back, yet you insisted on walking this path to ruin, stubbornly clinging to your views and interfering. Now that things have come to this, you have the gall to ask me why!”

Cui Changfu’s face flushed with anger as he demanded:

“Yangya! Have you forgotten the Oath of Xixiao?!”

Hearing this, the eyes of the middle-aged Daoist Master before him turned fierce and hard. He said:

“Good! So you haven't forgotten! When Jianghuai guided the Wei Emperor, did I see you lift a finger? Let me tell you, Cui Changfu, if Bright Yang still remembered that oath, then in the thousand years the former emperor has spent reincarnating in the mortal world, you and I would have died ten thousand times over! And for helping that man commit regicide, you can die for the ten-thousand-and-first time!”

Cui Changfu’s heart seethed upon hearing this, and he laughed out of pure rage.

“To act or not, who was to decide! The White Qilin was on our island, and the Dragon-kin's envoy stood upon the waves—who could have refused? It certainly wasn't you, Yangya!”

His sharp retort plunged the hall into silence. Cui Changyan, shaken by the fury radiating from the two masters of divine abilities, felt the world go dark, as if the sun and moon had lost their light. He clung to Yangya’s leg, pleading with all his might:

“Clan Uncle… I am just an old man with a meager cultivation. I know nothing of Fruition Attainment or divine abilities. But my brother is right—even if you wished to stay out of it, how could you possibly decide that on your own!”

Daoist Master Yangya, however, grew agitated. He took a step forward and declared:

“You think I have forgotten? On the contrary… Cui Changfu, you are wrong!”

“I attained the Dao a century before you; I have considered these things far more than you ever have! What of the Oath of Xixiao? At the time, I was the only one in the Cui Clan with a divine ability. The eyes of the world were upon me. If I could not refuse, it wouldn't have mattered whether I was a worthy subject of Bright Yang. When all was said and done, I would have just met my end and been done with it!”

“At worst, in the matter of Bright Yang, only I, Yangya, would have died! And only the Western Sea branch of the Cui Clan would perish with me!”

The Daoist Master laughed in fury, gnashing his teeth as he cursed:

“But you—on one hand, you concealed your breakthrough to the divine ability realm from me, and on the other, you sent our direct heir to that lake, terrified I would stop you. You dared to play both sides, and now how will you resolve this! You tell me, how will you resolve this?!”

“You old fools, how many times have you lost? Yet you still dare to wager our thousand-year foundation!”

The middle-aged Daoist Master seemed to be overcome with rage, his eyes slightly bloodshot. Yet, he only gently pulled his leg from the old man's grasp, flicked his sleeve, and strode to the front of the hall, seething:

“To hell with you! You people don't want to live, but I, Cui Yushan, intend to live!”

His words were left hanging in the hall as his figure transformed into heavenly light and vanished, leaving Cui Changfu standing stunned in place, his face alternating between ashen and pale, his emotions a complex storm.

He, Cui Changfu, had cultivated on the island year-round. Unlike Cui Changyan, he had not traveled the world in his youth. His interactions with Yangya had only begun after the man reached the Purple Mansion Realm, and he had always been forced to act subserviently, swallowing his anger. He harbored a great dislike for the man… but he had never imagined he would utter such words!

Cui Changyan likewise knelt on the floor, looking utterly lost. But then, hurried footsteps sounded from outside. Someone rushed in, fell to their knees in the hall with a thump, and said urgently:

“Reporting to the Daoist Master, the Dragon-kin have arrived!”

One storm had yet to settle, and another was already brewing. Cui Changfu's expression changed drastically. He hurried out and respectfully met the guest in the Great Void. Only then did he see a one-armed man standing in the gloomy expanse, his eyes radiating a fierce might as he stared off into the distance.

Cui Changfu said hurriedly:

“Greetings, Lord Xu Shui!”

This person was none other than Dragon King Beihai's most capable general, the Xu Water Demon King, Lu Xu!

Behind him stood another demon beast, born exceedingly ugly, yet he stood with a ramrod-straight back. It was Huiyao, muttering something malicious under his breath.

The Demon King had lost an arm, but his aura seemed even more dangerous than before. He did not answer the Daoist Master's greeting, instead cocking his head as if listening to something, his gaze fixed intently on the distance. 

Indifferently, he said:

“Cui Yushan came.”

Cui Changfu was slightly startled. He quickly bowed and said with a respectful laugh:

“That fellow saw that the Dragon-kin have been on close terms with my family recently and was immediately struck with fear. He scrambled to return the spiritual items and treasures he took long ago as a show of respect, then turned and fled. Your Excellency is magnanimous; there is no need to trouble yourself with him!”

“Oh?”

After these words were spoken, Huiyao awkwardly tucked his hands back into his sleeves, a look of sheer exasperation in his eyes. He had clearly just been speaking ill of Yangya. Lu Xu, meanwhile, turned his head and gave Cui Changfu a faint glance.

To be honest, this demon general was now truly afraid of anything concerning Bright Yang. Even though Cui Yushan did not seem to be on good terms with the Li Clan, he wanted no part of it… He was mostly afraid that Yangya would be imprudent and dare to cause trouble on Chongzhou. For now, he just nodded slightly and said:

“Let us go inside.”

“Yes.”

Cui Changfu secretly sighed in relief. He diligently welcomed his guest into the main hall, invited him to take the seat of honor, and said with a smile:

“I wonder what good news has brought the Demon King himself here!”

Lu Xu knew of the apprehension in his heart. His presence carried far more weight than that of an ordinary visitor; his arrival signified something unusual was afoot. He casually set aside the offered tea and said:

“You need not be nervous. It is indeed good news, but it is good news for your family.”

“Hm?”

Cui Changfu was slightly stunned, then startled. An indescribable feeling welled up within him as he said:

“The Demon King means…”

Lu Xu let out a hoarse laugh. It was clear he was trying to be friendly, but his fearsome aura was still overwhelming.

“His Highness went to pay a visit in the sea a few days ago and met the Eldest Princess. According to her calculations… today—is the very day that King Wei's loyal minister, that direct heir of the Cui Clan, is to attain the Dao!”
