# Chapter 877: Tian Sanglin

Li Ximing settled himself at the table. He could naturally tell this demon elephant was not simple. He waved his hand and said, "Most of the sea's demon beasts are under the command of the Dragon-kin, especially those at the Purple Mansion Realm. Yet, Daoist Friend, you seem entirely unrelated to the Dragon-kin. You are on good terms with Buddhist cultivators, yet you do not appear to cultivate their heart-methods. This is truly rare."

After all, Buddhist cultivators were known for their fondness for so-called 'spirit beasts'. Any demon beast they encountered, if it could be captured and taken to the Buddhist Land as a mount, would not be spared. The demon beasts, in turn, despised them for this; it was impossible for them to be on good terms.

This demon elephant was both a helper to the Buddhist cultivators and yet showed no sign of practicing their ways. When Li Ximing asked, he sighed.

"Naturally, it is because of my ancestors!"

Li Ximing remained noncommittal. 'Given this one's temperament, resources, and predicament, it's highly unlikely he's related to any great figure. He's just borrowing a name.' He feigned surprise.

"And who might that be?"

The demon beast glanced at him, hesitated, and then sighed.

"Since Daoist Friend has asked... it would be rude to refuse. My ancestors served under the Qi State. Later, we lived in the Great Desert. I broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm twenty years ago, left the north, and drifted here. The Qi State has been destroyed for who knows how many years; there is no backing to rely on. The Dragon-kin aren't willing to bother with me... but I was fortunate to find a place to cultivate."

"I practice in the Si Sea area, and I don't get along with Thunder-Hearing Island. On most days, I stay close to the Great Konghai Temple, but only for support."

Li Ximing found this strange.

The four northern dynasties were Wei, Qi, Liang, and Zhao. The Qi State was founded when the Jie clan invaded and replaced Wei, only to be slaughtered later by the Tuoba family. 'My own family is often called the Wei-Li. We certainly aren't on friendly terms. No wonder he was so tense.'

'It's a good thing he isn't a Buddhist cultivator, or he would be obsessed with this karma.' Whether the elephant's words were true or false, Li Ximing didn't much care. He nodded and said, "You reside overseas, so close to the Buddhist Land. Isn't that like striking a bargain with a tiger? Are you not afraid of losing your independence and being absorbed into the Buddhist Land?"

Tuodu noted his calm tone and the absence of any intent to attack. The tension in his heart eased slightly. "What choice is there? Fortunately, the one at the Great Konghai Temple cannot move easily. He sends monks every day, which is extremely annoying, but it's far better than being forced to flee for my life."

"After all... not everyone is as reasonable as you, Daoist Friend. The Tuoba family still remembers me. There are several others eager to 'enlighten' me, and even that Chunyi Dao Gate..."

He stopped abruptly, shaking his head. Li Ximing understood. He sized up the elephant and asked cautiously, "In that case... do you cultivate Radiant Essence?"

Radiant Essence could dispel Bright Yang. 'Luckily, this Daoist tradition is just as rare nowadays. I have never seen it. If he cultivates the Qi State's Radiant Essence, this could be troublesome.'

Tuodu shook his head repeatedly. "I have no such fortune... I cultivate whatever my ancestors did. At present, it is Baleful Qi."

Li Ximing felt a sense of relief and stroked his beard. "That is also rare."

'If this Tuodu cultivated Radiant Essence and then fell to the Buddhist Land, he would undoubtedly become a great enemy.' Seizing the opportunity, he asked, "What was the name of the Qi Emperor?"

"The Qi Great Ancestor, Qiji Tanluo, whose court name was Shi Chang."

Though clearly a descendant of the Qi State, the demon beast spoke of the founding emperor with marked casualness. He looked at Li Ximing with some confusion and said hesitantly, "Daoist Friend should be more familiar with this than I. Qiji Tanluo defeated the Wei Crown Prince, Li Xunquan, and granted the Hetao region to the Helian family, establishing the Tiefu Kingdom. After generations of rise and fall, it is still on the border of the Zhao State."

Li Ximing was in Jiangnan, and news from the north was almost completely cut off by the Buddhist cultivators. It was rare to meet someone from there, so he took the chance to sit down and ask, "What is the current situation in the north?"

At this topic, the demon beast's expression became animated. It was clearly not the first time he had explained this to someone. He sneered and replied, "What could it be? Ever since Fu Qiyan fell, the Zhao State has become a plaything. The Seven Dao are above it, the Four Kings control the regions, and the court is full of eunuchs cultivating Veiled Yin. It's nothing but an empty shell. Fu Qiyan thought he was invading to become an emperor; he never imagined his descendants would become puppets."

"The Liangqiang in the west are in total chaos. The Yan State in the east is just the Murong family. A little south of them is the Gao family's King Bolie, who has already unified the former Qi lands. You could call him the King of Qi and it wouldn't make a difference. Above them, you have the Tiefu Kingdom and the Tuoba family... officials, the court, nobles, and the Maha are all tangled together. It is far more chaotic than the south!"

The demon beast's expression finally held some sincerity as he let out a deep sigh. "This chaotic world... it's no place to make a name for yourself. Even after I reached the Purple Mansion Realm, all I can think about is fleeing further and further away. If you don't have a True Monarch at your back, a Golden Core ancestor above you, or a Daoist Master for a father, how can you dare to stand out in this mess?"

"And what's more... there is still a Mount Luoxia."

Li Ximing was stunned. He knew the situation in Zhao was suffocating, but he had not imagined it had reached this point. The white elephant, having tested him enough, felt Li Ximing bore him little malice and quickly added:

"Daoist Friend Li... I have heard of your reputation... They say your Alchemy Dao is unmatched. My Baleful Qi has formed a divine ability, but my core is flawed and malformed. I cannot even nourish a spirit embryo for a Spiritual Artifact..."

"Most cultivators on the mainland follow the Supreme Yang Dao... They all look down their noses at people. The few factions around here ignore me, and the Great Konghai Temple is full of Buddhist cultivators... I was hoping that if there is a chance in the future, I could trouble Daoist Friend to refine some pills for me..."

They were strangers who had met by chance. Li Ximing was extremely cautious, especially since Tuodu was aligned with the enemy, which could lead to many unnecessary misunderstandings. He frowned. "We will speak of this later. Daoist Friend, you should focus on your own situation. If you fall to the Buddhist Land, the next time we meet, we will be enemies."

The two sat at the bottom of the sea, talking for some time. The demon beast tactfully inquired about Spiritual Artifacts, spirit pills, and spirit formations, while Li Ximing subtly fished for information about the north. It was a tacit understanding. Finally, a jade pendant in Li Ximing's sleeve flashed. The situation to the west was resolved.

"Farewell!"

Li Ximing waved his sleeve, wasted no more words, and vanished into the Great Void. The demon beast also let out a deep sigh and returned to his island, a hint of schadenfreude on his face.

When Li Ximing emerged from the Great Void above the sea, he saw the western horizon flashing with magnificent light. The radiance of the Buddhist Land shimmered in a vast expanse of pink. Zhusheng and the others had succeeded.

'These cultivators from the Southern Sea and the Southern Borderlands are reliable... As expected, picking a side and putting on a show is much easier than fighting oneself.'

Feeling quite at peace, Li Ximing summoned his light and flew straight toward Songzhou.

The islands of Songzhou were many, varying in size, with archipelagos stretching on endlessly. The main body, however, was divided into three parts. Southern Songzhou Luoshe was at the far southeastern corner, directly south of his current position and very close. Li Ximing rode his light across the strait and arrived.

As a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, he was already near the apex of worldly power. It was common for such experts to carve out a small Island for themselves and rule as a king. As he descended, he noted the land was covered in dark forests and low mountains. Large swathes of territory were sectioned off but devoid of people. Only when he reached the very center did he see densely packed black palaces.

'This faction does not look virtuous.' Li Ximing carefully guided his light downward. His gaze swept over the palace roofs built around the central hill, revealing heavy chains and a pervasive black qi.

It was said the Southern Songzhou King Luoshe had a mid-Purple Mansion Realm cultivation and practiced the Dao of Shamanic Arts and Talismans. He was naturally not to be trifled with. Li Ximing paused in the air and projected his voice with his divine ability:
"I am Li Ximing of Zhaojing, here to visit Southern Songzhou Luoshe. I humbly request the Great King to grant me an audience!"

A Purple Mansion Realm expert from Southern Songzhou Luoshe was supposed to have joined the fight against the Buddhist cultivators, which meant one should still be on the island. Regardless of which one it was, Li Ximing addressed him as 'Great King'. After a moment, a cultivator in black armor rose on the wind.

"Daoist Master, please come in!"

Li Ximing descended, passing through the heavy layers of black qi. Atop the mountain stood an enormous dharma throne, easily the size of a courtyard. A massive dharma body sat upon it, one hand holding a flower, the other forming a mudra. It was as tall as a mountain, with eyes as large as carriages, looking like a world-ending demon amidst the black qi. On its knees, palms, and fingertips, black-robed cultivators sat cross-legged, meditating in silence.

Li Ximing's Profound Light, though brilliant, seemed insignificant before this dharma body.

'What a powerful Purple Mansion Dharma Body...'

'He doesn't cultivate the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, so I can't count his divine abilities. But Daoist Master Lingmei mentioned his strength is at the mid-Purple Mansion Realm. I fear most of that power resides in this dharma body.'

'From this one glance, I suspect this dharma body is no weaker than that of any Maha.'

A black light coalesced before him, forming an old man in black robes with a white beard. He nodded. "Please!"

This was a body condensed from a divine ability. Li Ximing had a request, so he naturally nodded with a smile, adopting the attitude of a junior as he followed. Once inside the palace, the old sorcerer spoke. "This King was just using my dharma body to observe North Dan from the Great Void, in case a great war breaks out in the west. My apologies for the poor reception."

"Not at all!"

The place was gloomy. They passed through dark palace halls lined with high-backed jade thrones. Li Ximing took a seat as motioned. The old man spoke in a low, ethereal voice:

"This King's surname is Dilu Tian, and my common name is Sanglin. I was originally one of the Eastern Yue from Yue State. Traveling abroad proved inconvenient, so I took the 'Tian' from my name. You may simply call me Tian Sanglin."

"Your esteemed clan's reputation... I heard of it long ago. Jiao Zhongzi and Huo Luo'e both cultivate on my island. I knew of your Li family even back then."

Li Ximing was stunned. The names were extremely familiar, and then it hit him.

'When Duanmu Kui died, the Mount Wu group scattered. The strongest among them was Jiao Zhongzi. When the Li family campaigned west against the Eastern Yue, Jiao Zhongzi vanished, having gone off to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. By the time we had fought our way to the westernmost territory of the Eastern Yue, the only remaining Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from Mount Wu, Huo Luo'e, had also fled and disappeared.'

'The Li family has encountered many factions and visited many places over the years, but we never heard any news of those two. We assumed they had fled to the Sea's Cape to live freely. I never expected them to be here at Southern Songzhou Luoshe.'

"You are also from my Yue State!"

After this thought, Li Ximing hesitated slightly and asked, "Senior Duanmu... was..."

Tian Sanglin said flatly, "I received a favor from Senior Duanmu. Although he cultivated the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, his mastery of shamanic arts could be called the greatest of all time. In my early years, I often visited him on the mountain. Jiao Zhongzi and Huo Luo'e are a bit younger; they didn't know someone like me existed."

"However... I had a junior, Dilu Tianfu, who cultivated on Mount Wu and was good friends with them. He told them of this escape route. So, when disaster struck Mount Wu, those two came to visit me, one after the other. Ironically, it was my own junior who perished on Mount Wu while attempting his breakthrough."

"So that's how it is!"

Li Ximing nodded inwardly, a realization dawning.

'Back then, Master also visited Mount Wu once, specifically to retrieve Dilu Tianfu's belongings. It probably wasn't out of any friendship with Xiao Chuting. Rather, this man couldn't go to Mount Wu himself and entrusted Daoist Master Xiao to retrieve the items for him!'

'That means the [Bone-Carving and Skin-Shedding] technique we obtained also came from Southern Songzhou Luoshe...'

But as soon as his doubts were resolved, a chill ran down his spine. He asked, "The cultivator from Southern Songzhou Luoshe who recently broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm... is it Jiao Zhongzi?"

A harsh, grating laugh came from the old sorcerer's throat. He looked up slightly and replied, "Correct!"

Li Ximing's heart sank.

'It's exactly what I was afraid of...'

'The Li family's relationship with the Eastern Yue was far from amicable. Seizing their territory means nothing to a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, but Jiao Zhongzi had left a subordinate and a mount behind on Mount Wu. It's possible he had some attachment to them. This... this doesn't look good.'

Li Ximing's brow locked in a deep frown. But Tian Sanglin made a sound and said softly, "He has already severed his former karma. The affairs of Mount Wu no longer have anything to do with Jiao Zhongzi. He cannot accept that karma, and he does not dare to."

Li Ximing understood. The only thing a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would not dare to touch... it had to be that immortal book from back then. Duanmu Kui had received it directly from an immortal, so he could be reckless. But who after him would dare touch that thing? Who would dare touch the Daoist tradition of Mount Wu?

Li Ximing sighed. "Business is business. My family did offend him in the past. I will offer two spirit pills as compensation to show my sincerity."

As they were speaking, an old man walked up carrying a jade tray, bowing respectfully. "Your Majesty... the treasure has been brought from the palace!"

Li Ximing's heart leaped. He looked over. The jade tray was as large as a desk, colored a deep cyan-green. In its center rested a golden halberd.

The halberd had a long handle, about three chi in length. The two corners of the blade curved like a crescent moon. It did not look crude; on the contrary, it appeared exquisite and delicate. Qilin-beast patterns rippled across its surface, which glowed with a heavy, thick, bronze-gold color that faintly reflected a shimmering silver light.

'A Spiritual Artifact!'

'These overseas cultivators are far less formal than those in Jiangnan. On the mainland, we would have had to exchange pleasantries, I would state my purpose, and only then would he have brought it out. The Southern Songzhou King Luoshe was chatting casually while already having someone send it over!'

Li Ximing examined it closely. Apart from the beast-shaped Qilin carvings, the weapon was devoid of other patterns, save for two small, simple star charts etched on its flat faces. The lines were shallow, as if not to disrupt the heavy, powerful aura of the surface.

He was extremely familiar with this diagram. It was the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Chart. The two charts were inverses of each other, one on each side, indicating this Spiritual Artifact was meant to be hung and had a distinct front and back.

Li Ximing was deeply moved and asked, "Senior... may I ask the name of this Spiritual Artifact?"

Tian Sanglin leaned back on his throne, his voice ancient. "The Radiant Sun King's Halberd. It is an artifact of the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven. It shatters evil and corruption, punishes the disloyal, illuminates the rivers and mountains, and watches over the people. Its divine ability is the 'Crimson Rupture Cluster'. It can bear the weight of an empire and sweep away all calamities."
