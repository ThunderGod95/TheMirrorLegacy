# Chapter 911: Meeting Again

The sky was dim. Figures hurried across Cold Cloud Peak. Cultivators in white armor carried weapons, led by a black-robed youth. His expression was dark, seemingly furious, yet the hand resting on his sword hilt was almost light, tapping gently.

'I've finally waited for this day...'

The Fei Clan had been on the Northern Shore for so many years, always in a state of semi-independence. Chen Yang had advised the peak more than once, with only one goal: to abolish every last bit of the Fei Clan's autonomy.

'My Chen Clan has served with merit for five generations! We haven't even secured a position as landlords, our descendants toiling in service. What are you, Fei Clan? A bunch of pathetic cowards who surrendered midway, and you think you're worthy of holding land and raising people?'

As for Fei Qing'yi's desperate gamble, Chen Yang felt no animosity. On the contrary, his previous impression of him as a meek and honest person changed. He found himself admiring him a little, shaking his head in secret:

'Even a cornered rabbit will bite. His timing was just unlucky. Otherwise, he might have actually succeeded. A pity, a real pity. In the end, he was devoured by demonic cultivators. If it had been me... I wouldn't have been so clumsy as to charge in like this...'

The Fei family had always been cautious, enduring until now. Li Ximing and the Great Xiukui Monastery had already agreed to relocate the Fei clansmen. Both sides had even begun the handover. Once they reached the Great Xiukui Monastery, where governance was laxer and they had backing from above, their lives as landed gentry would naturally be much better.

But the Fei family had fallen on the eve of this new dawn.

Right now, the mountainside was filled with the sound of weeping and endless wailing. To Chen Yang, it was like celestial music. His hand caressed the hilt of his sword. He watched the woman being dragged before him like a dead dog, and a few chuckles escaped his throat.

"You're in for a world of pain now."

The Fei family members on the ground cried out about the injustice, but no one paid them any mind. Cold Cloud Peak had always been famous for its snowy vistas. The white snow glimmered with a dim, yellow light in the dusk. Chen Yang turned and strode away without a shred of pity. Outside the courtyard, the two pots of plum blossoms were still swaying in the wind and snow.

A crimson-robed youth stood in the snow, a woman in a feathered cloak at his side. The youth's gaze was fixed on the plum blossoms. Chen Yang bowed deeply and said respectfully:

"Young Master! All members of the Fei family have been detained and are awaiting your judgment!"

He finished his report, but when Li Jiangqian didn't respond, he added obsequiously:

"These plum blossoms are growing well. Should we move them to the island..."

"No need. They still have some vitality growing here. If we move them, they certainly won't survive."

Li Jiangqian retracted his gaze and said softly, "This courtyard was once an ancestor's residence. Preserve every single part of it... I won't permit even the slightest damage. As for the Fei family members..."

He trailed off. Chen Yang paused, confused, and raised an eyebrow. He then realized the entire courtyard was brightening. The once-dim snow was now illuminated by a brilliant Radiance, shining brightly as it melted into thin slush.

"Drip!"

Only then did he notice a drop of red land in front of him. It looked like dark red blood.

The blood had just hit the ground when it instantly vaporized into a cloud of cold mist. Everyone nearby looked up at the sky in unison, only to be met by blinding waves of light.

The gloomy clouds in the sky scattered, replaced by a convergence of colorful clouds. A figure stood above the lake. The setting sun dipped toward the horizon, draping him in a brilliant crimson light that made it impossible to look at him directly. All that could be seen was a silhouette, rendered dark by the intense light surrounding it.

A familiar, long-handled halberd was held horizontally in the air. A man in white robes was draped conspicuously over it like a corpse. A stream of red blood trickled down his white clothes, turning into snowflakes as it fell.

"Father!"

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

In an instant, everyone in the courtyard dropped to their knees. Chen Yang's mind felt as if it had been struck by lightning. His thoughts went completely blank, leaving only a single idea:

'It's not Daoist Master Zhaojing? He... he succeeded! The Li Clan has a second Purple Mansion Realm expert?!'

The thought was fleeting. In the next instant, he understood who the man in white was:

'Fei Qing'yi! He's been captured and brought back!'

"Thud..."

The halberd was inverted. The white-robed man tumbled from the sky, landing on the ground with a heavy thud. He let out a groan, dragged his body over, and began to kowtow. Not a single person in the courtyard dared to make a sound, leaving only the dull *thud, thud, thud* of his forehead hitting the ground.

Li Jiangqian was not surprised at all; he had clearly already met with Li Zhouwei. He flicked his sleeves, turned in a new direction, and bowed deeply.

"Congratulations, my-lord, on achieving your Divine Ability!"

At once, the crowd bowed again in congratulations. But the Daoist Master in the sky was already gone, leaving only a faint command:

"Handle this, then come and see me on the island."

The brilliant light receded, and the world returned to the dim, dark-red hues of the setting sun. Before the crowd could even recover from their stunned silence, Chen Yang lunged forward, shouting:

"Fei Qing'yi fell to the demonic path! The Fei family colluded with the Northern Buddhists, intending to bring a wolf into our house and endanger Jiangnan! Their crimes are monstrous! The Daoist Master is wise and powerful, turning the tide against this disaster! But Fei Qing'yi still caused countless deaths and injuries on the Northern Shore! We demand he be paraded through the streets for three days, then executed by a thousand cuts and his head put on display..."

Li Jiangqian waited until he had finished his loud proclamation, ensuring every cultivator and Fei family member on the ground had heard clearly. A clamor immediately rose from all around. Only then did Li Jiangqian wave his hand and say:

"That's letting him off too lightly. First, gather our men and watch everyone closely."

The crowd reported and retreated, huddling together and whispering amongst themselves. Li Jiangqian frowned and said in a low voice:

"The Fei family caused disastrous casualties among the common people of the Northern Shore. We can't be lenient. But Fei Qingya is still at the Great Xiukui Monastery. What are your thoughts on how to handle her?"

Li Que'wan understood his meaning. The joy in her eyes slowly faded, replaced by a glint of coldness. She replied in a low voice:

"I don't see it being difficult. Fei Qingya holds little affection for the Fei Clan. We just need to write her a letter. She's like a character from a storybook; her sense of right and wrong is more self-righteous than anyone's. The Great Xiukui Monastery will be happy to see this outcome... This is a critical time. We cannot be lenient. Exterminating the entire clan might be too much, but for Fei Qing'yi's branch, even annihilating three generations of his family wouldn't be enough to atone for his crimes. Aside from Fei Qingyi, who is beyond our reach... I see no need to leave any others alive."

Li Jiangqian nodded, though he seemed somewhat unsatisfied. The Fei family was large. Although many mortals with the Fei surname had died in the recent battle, uprooting them completely would still result in tens of thousands of deaths. He mused, "Fei Qing'yi still holds a position at Tangdao Mountain, nominally under the command of the Great Xiukui Monastery. In my opinion, it would be best to round up his three generations and let the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition handle them. As for the rest... we'll deal with them based on the situation."

Fei Qingyi, after all, is part of the Si Clan now. She had gone over to the enemy and was in no position to interfere. Even if this woman couldn't bear it, she had no right to speak. It's not that she didn't warn the Fei family, but with things as they are, what could be done?

The two of them settled the matter, gave their orders, and quickly departed. The sounds of mournful crying faded into the distance. At last, Cold Cloud Peak was empty, leaving only the white snow drifting in the night, falling silently on the sealed roof of the nearby hall.

The high pavilion stood peacefully in the wind. The white paint on its doors was slightly faded. The sound of falling snow was a soft whisper. The two wintersweet trees bloomed quietly in the snow, as if nothing had ever changed.

...

Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

Li Zhouwei descended on a beam of light. The climate here was utterly different from the icy desolation of Cold Cloud Peak. Radiance blazed, gardenias bloomed in abundance, and a wave of heat rolled through the air.

The man in the white-gold Daoist robe was pacing anxiously by a table. When he saw Li Zhouwei enter, his eyes smiled, and he looked relieved, though anxiety still lingered. Li Zhouwei cupped his hands in greeting.

"This junior greets you, my-lord!"

Li Ximing picked up the pot from the table, his expression, weary from his injuries, softening. Although he had managed to retrieve his ruined body from Helian Wujiang in time, the baleful aura was still wreaking havoc within his dharma body. The injuries left from fighting a Daoist Master with Three Divine Abilities were clearly not light.

'This trip to Tangdao Mountain, I have to get some medicine from them... I really staked my life this time.'

Returning from the north had given him a considerable fright. He had sensed Helian Wumeng stopped at Baijiang Creek from a great distance. If Helian Wumeng had decided to head south and slaughter, it would have been truly risky for Li Ximing to intervene. But when Li Zhouwei appeared, he breathed a sigh of relief. He had been observing silently from the Great Void and had returned a step earlier.

Now, he asked:

"When did you get back?"

Li Zhouwei relaxed his hand, and Grand Ascension vanished. He bowed deeply, walked to the table, and accepted the tea Li Ximing had poured, saying respectfully, "In truth, I had ample time. It's just that the phenomenon was concealed by the Dragon-kin, and the stone talisman I left for you, my-lord, was rendered ineffective, so no one knew. After breaking through, I made a trip to the Dragon Palace. By the time I returned, several days had passed. I saw Xiaoshi Mountain collapse and the situation escalating, endangering the lakeshore, so I stationed myself on the Northern Shore. I hope you, my-lord, can forgive me for not rushing to Caishan's aid..."

"That's hardly a transgression."

Li Ximing laughed and set down the jade pot in his hand. His expression turned serious. "I knew you would succeed! I just never imagined it would be this fast. It seems that having fate on your side truly brings benefits that ordinary people can only envy."

On any other day, Li Ximing would have been overjoyed, wanting nothing more than to host a grand banquet and celebrate for three days. But the situation was too uncertain, and his injuries were not light. This cast a shadow over his joy. After just a moment, the cloud of worry returned to his heart. He sighed, his happy expression fading, and said in a low voice, "I can't clean up this mess. I can only go with the flow. We've already grown too close to the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. It seems this conflict between north and south is completely different from those in the past. Kui Qi has treated me well; there's no easy way to back out now."

"I rushed back this time to save someone and happened to meet with you. I was originally heading to Tangdao Mountain..."

Li Zhouwei shook his head and was about to say more, but Li Ximing continued, "You don't need to come with me. Right now, everyone is on edge. You can play the 'bad cop' and just guard our home. If we both appear too friendly, there will be some obligations we can't refuse."

Li Zhouwei naturally understood this point. His expression was just a bit complicated as he replied, "My trip to the Dragon Palace took up this exact window of time. Their words were full of hints. The long and short of it is, they don't want me getting involved in the great battle at Luoxia. It seems all parties have already reached a consensus on the outcome of this war."

Li Ximing's heart skipped a beat when he heard this. "What else did the Dragon-kin say?"

Li Zhouwei first shook his head silently, then answered, "Dingjiao is in seclusion. He only left something for me in the underwater Dragon Palace, instructing me to take it without fail... I was met by another White Dragon. We only spoke a few words."

He raised his hand and took a jade box from his sleeve. As soon as the lid opened, an item was revealed: two small, glittering rings.

"Spiritual Treasure! The Pure Yang Bracelets!"

Li Zhouwei had dared to confront Helian Wumeng and four of the Merciful Ones on the river; naturally, he had an ace up his sleeve. Li Ximing had used the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass before, so how could he not know how powerful these treasures were? His eyes lit up, and he said in pleasant surprise,

"A Spiritual Treasure? As a gift?"

Li Zhouwei looked slightly awkward. "Yes... I couldn't refuse. I was worried it was because of trouble back home that they specifically gave me the Pure Yang Bracelets. So I brought them back."

These two Spiritual Treasures didn't look remarkable. At first glance, they were just a pair of gold rings, perfectly sized for wearing. But looking closer, one could see them faintly shimmering with a white-gold luster that faded in and out of view.

Li Ximing examined them closely, but in the end, he closed the box and pushed it back into Li Zhouwei's hands. He instructed, "With these in your possession, you'll have more protection. I'll also feel more at ease leaving you to guard the lake. I still need to make that trip."

As he spoke, he took out a jade slip and a token from his sleeve, saying in a low voice, "In the years you've been in seclusion, the clan's great formations have been repaired. This token will grant you access to both the inner and outer formations."

"This jade slip contains my experiences from practicing 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' these past few years. Take it and read it. Destroy it after you're done..."

He rummaged through his storage pouch and immediately dumped out a pile of itemsmedicinal pills, cultivation techniques, Spiritual Qi, dharma artifactspushing them all into Li Zhouwei's hands. It felt incredibly ominous, making Li Zhouwei's eyelids twitch.

After leaving the items, he summoned a beam of light and flew into the Great Void, disappearing from sight. Li Zhouwei was left holding the items. He stared at the jade box on the table and quietly sipped his tea, his expression gradually darkening.

'We're all just pawns... Who isn't a pawn? Of those who refuse to be pawns, who refuse to bow and scrape like dogs, how many haven't been carved up, bled dry, and had their very marrow sucked out? Even the Purple Mansion Realm is full of constraints! The only way out is to harden your heart, abandon everything, and flee overseas. Then you might preserve a few hundred years of freedom... In this world, as long as you have the slightest ambition to climb, you can never escape being someone's dog!'

'As for me... I probably don't even have the right to leave their sight!'

A sarcastic smile touched his lips. He lowered his head, picked up the jade slip, and extended his spiritual sense into it. He read it carefully. As expected, it was mostly a treatise on the Bright Yang Dao. But as he read to the very end, he found an incantation.

Li Zhouwei only gave it a single glance, but his heart shook. With a calm and indifferent expression, he crushed the jade slip in his hand. His eyes flashed with a bright light. He looked up and said coldly,

"Who's there?!"

The Great Void rumbled, and two figures drilled their way out onto Gardenia Scenery Mountain!

One of them was short, with horns on his forehead, an ugly face, and eyes on the sides of his head. He clutched a brush as long as a pestle. The moment he emerged, he bowed.

"Emissary from the Underworld Bureau of the Netherworld... Wang Long, greets you, fellow Daoist! Congratulations on achieving your Divine Ability! From this day on, your fate is your own, and you are beyond the cycle of life and death!"

The other person, holding a large book, had also been here before. It was Zhang Gui!

Both of them were beaming with joy, their gazes fervent as they looked at him. Li Zhouwei had heard Li Ximing mention these two before. He inwardly shook his head.

'This time, they don't dare wish me success in avoiding the great calamity, attaining Fruition Attainment, and reaching Truehood...'

Wang Long, however, didn't know what he was thinking and said with a smile, "Apologies for intruding, fellow Daoist... We've been to this place before... We just didn't expect to be back so soon! Fellow Daoist truly has the talent of a celestial... Throughout history, not many have been able to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm in under ten years. Now, we've finally seen it! The last time we... the last time..."

The time it takes to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm always involves a bit of luck. Wang Long was just saying it to be auspicious. The nearby Zhang Gui slowly picked up where he left off, "The last one was Jiang Boqing, another figure of extremely high cultivation."

"Yes, yes!"

Zhang Gui studied his expression and said gleefully, "Even the great one praised this person, saying his 'talent exceeds the rules, his fate is worthy of Mount Shi.' He was especially appreciated. If he hadn't made a move, how could that fellow Jiang have had any room to maneuver? He would have long since been..."

It was as if he had no filter on his mouth. He stopped abruptly, then smiled and said, "Fellow Daoist is surely a renowned figure, one destined to master the Five Dharmas!"

Li Zhouwei heard the hidden meaning. His eyes gleamed, and his hand, resting on the jade cup, rubbed it slightly. He secretly filed the information away and said with a smile, "After I broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, I rushed home in a hurry and completely forgot that you two fellow Daoists would be coming to register my name... I've made you wait for so long. My apologies!"
