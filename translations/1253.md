# Chapter 1253: Hall of the High River

The two were aghast, a sentiment Cui Jueyin could somewhat understand. He offered a bow and said with a smile,

“The Eternal Brightness Steps was never a natural creation. It evolved from High Radiance True Monarch’s Memorial on the Completion of Rites at Mount Taishi in the Northern Lands. It is an external manifestation of the Bright Yang nation’s system, so it naturally possesses such a divine effect…”

“The cultivators of ancient Wei also possessed various secret methods to aid in borrowing power, thereby emulating a divine ability. Within their national system, there was a corresponding structure for this, called ‘receiving’. It was often bestowed upon officials who received imperial command to inspect the provinces…”

Li Jiangqian’s thoughts ran deeper. He said pensively,

“That’s quite a useful divine ability… I fear just a few more cultivators who practice the Eternal Brightness Steps would be enough to suppress all corners of the land…”

Li Jiangqian’s line of reasoning was crystal clear. If Cui Jueyin could cultivate the Eternal Brightness Steps, why couldn’t Li Ximing? This divine ability allowed one to borrow power. If the two Bright Yang Daoist Masters each cultivated it, wouldn’t they be able to provide aid across the land and shake the world with ease when a critical moment arrived?

Li Ximing met his gaze and understood his meaning in an instant. He stroked his beard, remaining silent.

He, Li Ximing, now possessed World's Radiance and Audience with the Celestial Gate. For his next divine ability, he truly had a wealth of options. Sovereign's Perilous Tread, Crimson Severing Arrowhead, and Imperial Observation of the Origin—all three had complete Dao Lineages. Not a single one was weak!

Yet the problem lay with Li Ximing himself. Aside from Sovereign's Perilous Tread, the other divine abilities were genuinely difficult.

‘My second divine ability was a fluke. I obtained an exceedingly rare Purple Qi spiritual item and barely managed to succeed. If my next one is a difficult divine ability like Imperial Observation of the Origin or Crimson Severing Arrowhead, being stuck for sixty or seventy years is entirely possible!’

But if the Eternal Brightness Steps possessed such a divine effect, it would become an extremely rewarding choice!

“There are limitations, however…”

Cui Jueyin pondered for a moment before speaking softly,

“In ancient times, only emperor-level cultivators could practice World's Radiance, and those who lent their divine ability were almost exclusively figures of the emperor’s rank. Thus, they always acted under imperial command. Secondly, since the Daoist Master has lent his wisp of the Light of the Six Harmonies to me, he cannot simultaneously give it to another…”

“It can only be a one-to-one correspondence…”

With this, if Li Zhouwei lends his Light of the Six Harmonies to Cui Jueyin, it would leave Li Ximing with no power to borrow. Li Jiangqian secretly shook his head, lamenting,

“That makes sense. If one person with World's Radiance could lend it to multiple people, a few early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would be enough to pacify the realm.”

Cui Jueyin smiled faintly and said,

“Your Highness, what you say is both right and wrong. There are those who can lend a single World's Radiance to several people. In fact, never mind several people—lending it to everyone in the world is not out of the question.”

Li Jiangqian said with a smile,

“The Wei Emperor?”

“Precisely!”

Clearly, from the Cui family’s perspective, the establishment of the entire Wei-Li Immortal Dynasty was undoubtedly linked to the power of the Wei Emperor’s World's Radiance. The young man nodded silently. Cui Jueyin seemed to notice Li Ximing’s pensive expression and lowered his voice.

“Daoist Master, if you wish to cultivate the Eternal Brightness Steps… I’m afraid it would be inappropriate…”

Li Ximing was not surprised. He raised an eyebrow.

“How so?”

Cui Jueyin said softly,

“World's Radiance has always been exclusive to emperors and is often cultivated as the final divine ability. According to my family’s records, in most cases, only the emperor and the crown prince are permitted to cultivate it. In fact, in many situations… bestowing the method for World's Radiance is almost equivalent to bestowing the title of Wei Crown Prince…”

“World's Radiance is compatible with Imperial Observation of the Origin, but it has almost never been cultivated alongside the Eternal Brightness Steps… I fear their imageries conflict, which would lead to trouble…”

Li Ximing did not find this strange and nodded thoughtfully. Li Jiangqian, however, nonchalantly changed the subject, a smile gracing his features.

“Now that Jueyin has returned, many matters will be much more stable…”

Li Ximing also nodded, contemplating.

“Jueyin is also of Bright Yang. It would be unsuitable for him to go to the great desert, so… he should remain on the lake for now…”

But as he spoke, he found himself hesitating.

It was simple: the current Moongaze Lake truly could not accommodate a growing number of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators!

‘Gardenia Scenery Mountain is where I attained the Dao. For me, with my two divine abilities, it is barely adequate for cultivation. Ji’an is here seeking pills, so it matters little whether he cultivates. Jiangqian and Yuanbian are staying in the great desert… and this is without those other two having arrived yet…’

The Li family still had the vast Pingya Island, which could also accommodate people. However, Li Que'wan and Li Zhouwei were supposed to be cultivating within the inner formation, so it was naturally impossible to allow Cui Jueyin inside.

“In that case, after all this, I’ll still have to trouble you to return to Milin!”

A prefecture in Milin could accommodate a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator without issue. As for how much it would benefit one’s cultivation, that was naturally out of the question. It was far inferior to the Seeking Evil Stage, let alone something on the level of the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance!

Liu Changdie’s path of cultivation had already been severed, so he was content to go there. But Cui Jueyin was considered a genius of the Cui clan, and Li Ximing, who treated him as a junior, was naturally reluctant to send him away.

Cui Jueyin, however, showed no signs of being troubled. Instead, he smiled.

“I was in charge of Milin for many years. It is only right that I should go back for a look!”

The young man had not seen Li Zhouwei, and surprisingly, he made no mention of the Dragon-kin or the affairs of Chongzhou. Li Ximing was unaware of the changes that had occurred and simply took out a Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill, saying with great magnanimity,

“Use it as you please. If it’s not enough, just ask me for more!”

Cui Jueyin had only just reached the Purple Mansion Realm, and his mindset had yet to adjust. Moreover, Cui Changfu treasured these pills dearly, an impression that was deeply ingrained in him. He tried to refuse, but Li Ximing shook his head.

“I have a large reserve of these pills. There’s no need to be polite. Just use them!”

He touched his sleeve and produced another box. Inside, nestled on a bed of yellow silk, lay four brilliant Qilin's Radiant Unity Pills. Their scale-like patterns shimmered, making them look especially tempting. The great alchemist said solemnly,

“There’s more… Chongzhou raised you for many years. Now that you’ve broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, you cannot go without a gift. These four are for Cui Changfu. Find a way to send them back through your clan.”

Cui Jueyin was even more hesitant to accept, shaking his head repeatedly.

“This junior has no merits. How could I dare accept such a gift? Chongzhou’s resources are sufficient for now. The situation on the lake is what truly matters…”

Li Ximing laughed heartily.

“You don’t have to hide it from me. I’ve been overseas; I know what things are like out there. Just send them back. Consider it compensation for your absence from the island!”

Cui Jueyin was at a loss. Even more unexpectedly, the Daoist Master stood up, took the dazzling, green-and-yellow interwoven profound ruler from his waist, and held it in his hand. He looked at it with deep emotion and said,

“This item is called Shichuan. It was the first treasure I acquired after reaching the Purple Mansion Realm. It has a long history and is made of precious materials. Back then, my horizons were narrow and I was quite ignorant, unaware of the value of spiritual items. I used spiritual essence to nurture it for the sake of speed…”

“But it was a blessing in disguise. The item was nourished, and it can be considered quite formidable among Bright Yang spirit embryos…”

Cui Jueyin stood frozen in place. How could he not recognize Shichuan? Back then, when Li Ximing had gathered Foundation Establishment cultivators to assist in refining the artifact, he had been among them.

Seeing this profound, green-and-yellow treasure before him, the Daoist Master’s intentions were clear as day. He bowed in alarm and said,

“Daoist Master! This junior has only just returned to the lake and has not a single merit to my name! I dare not accept such a valuable treasure!”

Li Ximing heaved a long sigh.

“Whether you achieve merit, and how you are to be rewarded, are matters for King Wei. This item is between you and me. I hope you will carry it with you and nurture it often as a form of self-encouragement!”

Cui Jueyin understood the concern in his words and was speechless for a moment. But the Daoist Master before him had already placed the treasure in his hands and said with a deliberate smile,

“I’m busy with alchemy and cultivation. Don’t waste my time!”

With a flick of his sleeve, he made to return to the jade pillar. Cui Jueyin couldn’t bring himself to return it, so he could only clutch it silently in his hand. Forced to drop the subject, he quickly cupped his fists.

“Daoist Master, wait! This junior has another matter to report!”

Only then did Li Ximing turn around, a smile on his face.

“Oh?”

Cui Jueyin chose his words carefully.

“When this subordinate was breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, Yangya happened to arrive…”

The moment Li Ximing heard this, the smile vanished from his face. At his side, Li Jiangqian turned to look, a faint smile on his lips.

“He dared to make things difficult for you?”

“Of course not!”

Cui Jueyin’s gaze was complicated. In contrast to the Li family’s wariness of Yangya, he had lived through the brief period when the Cui clan had considered Yangya a source of pride. He sighed inwardly, took a jade box from his sleeve, and presented it with both hands.

“He took the ancestral tablets to indicate a severing of ties, but he also returned what he took all those years ago… Daoist Master, please take a look!”

As he finished speaking, the jade box opened on its own. The inside was pristine, containing only a quiet object the size of a green jujube. It was a sculpture of a small hall, carved with lifelike detail. From the cracks in the black roof tiles to the profound patterns on the window lattices, every feature was rendered in exquisite detail, and it emanated a faint light.

Cui Jueyin said softly,

“This is the Hall of the High River. It was brought out by our ancestor on the treasure ship back then!”

Li Ximing’s gaze sharpened. Although the item’s radiance was beautiful, from his current perspective, it did not possess a particularly grand aura. He nodded slightly and asked doubtfully,

“Is it a suppression artifact?”

“Not at all.”

Cui Jueyin hesitated.

“This treasure is not meant for combat. Strictly speaking, it should be a place to assist in cultivation. Back then, when the treasure ship sailed, the imperial command was to find Penglai, but the Immortal Estate intended to select a location to establish a mystic realm. Does the Daoist Master know of Yang Governance Ridge?”

Li Jiangqian nodded. When he had gone to see Cheng Qian, he had specifically learned of the place’s origins.

“Overlook Peak.”

“Precisely!”

Cui Jueyin continued in a low voice,

“This place also has a treasure called the Hall of Sustaining Yang, which is why it is called Yang Governance Ridge. The Hall of Sustaining Yang is also a hall, but it is far more powerful. It is a main hall, worthy of being called a Spiritual Treasure. It can sustain a mystic realm, stabilize its Profound Foundation, communicate with Wei Huang Heaven, and suppress an entire region!”

Li Ximing had a sudden realization.

“So it’s a ritual vessel from the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate, used to stabilize their various mystic realms!”

Cui Jueyin nodded repeatedly.

“The elders in my family also said… items on the level of the Hall of Sustaining Yang are a type of ritual vessel, also known as a spirit pavilion. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition has one as well, called the… Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion… That one is even more formidable. Not only is it a great aid in stabilizing mystic realms, but it also has numerous other wondrous uses!”

‘Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion…’

The two exchanged a glance.

‘No wonder!’

Li Jiangqian nodded inwardly.

‘Back then, Tinglan spoke of these matters as if reciting from a family register. She was extremely knowledgeable. With a spirit pavilion like this, she must also possess the art of Great Void construction. Hiding out in that Purple Qi blessed land now, she is likely making preparations!’

Cui Jueyin presented the item, looking somewhat guilty.

“My family’s elders were not of high status. The hall they brought out is merely a side hall and can only be considered a Spiritual Artifact. When it manifests on the ground, it is eighty zhang long and can be entered for cultivation…”

‘That’s more than enough!’

Li Ximing was hardly in need of combat-oriented Spiritual Artifacts. This kind of spirit pavilion, designed for mystic realms and grotto-heavens, could not only slightly alleviate the predicament of Moongaze Lake having too many Purple Mansion cultivators and too little spiritual energy, but it might also prove useful in the future construction of the Great Void. Though it did not look particularly impressive, it was rare and exceedingly useful. For a moment, he was at a loss for words, finally sighing,

“And here you were, trying to refuse Shichuan. How can a mere spirit embryo compare to this Hall of the High River?”

Cui Jueyin shook his head.

“This belongs to the Immortal Estate. The Cui clan was merely its custodian—just like the treasure ship. The Cui clan never dared to claim it, for fear that acting rashly would bring ruin to Bright Yang.”

His words were resolute. Even Li Jiangqian glanced over, his expression complicated. Li Ximing was left speechless. He pushed the jade box back and said in a soft, gentle voice,

“Take it and use it for now. With this Hall of the High River, your stay in Milin won’t be so lacking!”

Cui Jueyin accepted it. Li Ximing patted his shoulder, then transformed into a ray of heavenly light and returned to the jade pillar, closing his eyes to cultivate. Li Jiangqian seized the opportunity to pick up the yellow silk brocade box, smiling.

“I’ll find someone to deliver this to Chongzhou.”

“Your Highness!”

Li Jiangqian’s expression immediately turned solemn, and he cut him off.

“The family has ample resources. Grand-uncle has greatly delayed his own cultivation to refine these pills, all to shorten the time it takes for us to cultivate our divine abilities. Time is the most precious thing right now; you mustn’t be coy.”

In the end, Li Jiangqian’s words had their effect. Cui Jueyin considered for a moment, then accepted the items with reddened eyes, saying softly,

“This subordinate understands.”

Li Jiangqian nodded with a smile and departed for the great desert. Cui Jueyin immediately stepped into the Great Void and landed in Milin, only to find the mountaintop already crowded with people, all kneeling in unison. The man at the front was powerfully built, his bearing both heroic and bold, and his face was wreathed in joy.

“Congratulations, Daoist Master!”

“Brother Weizeng! What is all this…?”

Seeing his old friend, Cui Jueyin’s eyes warmed. He immediately moved to help him up, pulling him to sit, but the man dared not accept. He remained standing with his back slightly bent, smiling.

“Daoist Master, please don’t make things difficult for us…”

Cui Jueyin had no choice but to let go. A golden light flickered in his eyes as he asked in quiet surprise,

“Weizeng… have you been cultivating a secret method?”

At the mention of this, a complex look crossed Ding Weizeng’s face.

“The Daoist Master’s eyes are like torches… Daoist Master Zhaojing found a secret method for me, but after all these years, I have only managed to cultivate the first stage. I have no clue about the second… I fear I have failed to live up to his great trust!”

Cui Jueyin said with a serious expression,

“To have a second stage to cultivate… is already a great fortune. We come from humble origins. How can we be greedy when it comes to secret methods?”

With a flick of his finger, a streak of golden light leaped from his sleeve. It unfurled in the sky, transforming into a grand hall with black tiles and golden lacquer. Its eaves curved sharply upwards like pecking beaks, utterly domineering. The flight of six steps leading up to the great hall was adorned with dancing qilin patterns!

[Hall of the High River]!

The Hall of the High River was an auxiliary hall, a side hall, and thus appeared somewhat long and narrow. But the Wei kingdom’s architectural style was truly domineering and magnificent. As it floated above the mountain peak, it seemed to press down on everything from east to west. The great hall rumbled, and waves of dense spiritual energy gushed forth, making the entire mountain range seem to burst with life.

Cui Jueyin’s brow was filled with emotion.

“Brother Ding, since your lifespan is sufficient, you can cultivate with peace of mind.”
