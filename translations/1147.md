# Chapter 1147: A Scheme in Broad Daylight

Shadowy clouds churned above Shanji, seeming to gestate countless wraiths within their depths. A palace of the Underworld stood upon that sea of clouds, and from time to time, streaks of light would descend from it, flying off in all directions.

Within the dark, lightless hall of the Underworld, Yang Ruiyi’s face was a mask of gloom. He stood in utter silence. Before him, a woman in pitch-black robes was equally afraid to make a sound.

"Qi Lanyan… is he trying to get himself killed?"

Even though it had already happened, he still found it impossible to comprehend.

'The Underworld and Mount Luoxia are both high and mighty. Below them are the Guanhua and the Yang clan, like ants beneath the feet of two giants. We look impressive on the surface, but we all know that in the eyes of our own superiors, we’re nothing. We’re even more terrified of the powers backing our rivals… This was supposed to be a cordial affair, something we’d wrap up with a bit of fanfare…'

In Yang Ruiyi’s mind, he and Qi Lanyan had always had a tacit understanding despite their frequent contests. They were like two young nobles playing a game of kickball; there were wins and losses, but they would laugh it off and finish the match amiably.

When it was time for the game to end, the ball was his to take home, as he had been the one to bring it in the first place.

But Qi Lanyan’s current move was like he’d inexplicably flown into a rage out of humiliation. He’d called upon his royal relatives, and just as the game was about to end, he insisted on kicking the ball back and smashing it right into Yang Ruiyi’s face.

Yang Ruiyi certainly had his own trump cards and wasn't afraid of some Numinous Treasure cultivator, but a single question filled him with doubt.

'What’s the point?'

He knew Qi Lanyan was targeting Bright Yang; it was the entire reason the man held his position. Everyone understood this, so why make a fuss with the Yang family? Did he really think he could snatch the ball away?

"After all this trouble, it’s as if Qi Lanyan is playing for keeps, truly determined to establish who’s superior!"

Hearing his furious words, Yang Tianyou whispered, "Perhaps… it's about Vast Cicada."

Yang Ruiyi fell instantly silent.

He had never anticipated the matter with Vast Cicada, nor had he ever shouldered the blame for it. For a moment, he’d forgotten that from his rival’s perspective, he was the one who had, without any reason, delivered a slap in the middle of their game.

He let out a cold sigh, a premonition stirring within him.

"Then what is his intention?"

Yang Tianyou appeared quite calm.

"He has such a powerful card to play, yet he used it on the insignificant Baiye Creek. He’s clearly not acting out of pure anger."

The words cut through his confusion like a sunbeam through clouds, and the grand general’s mind cooled. He narrowed his eyes.

"His target is still Bright Yang."

Yang Tianyou nodded grimly.

"Wang Ziya is certainly formidable, but they specifically sent a cultivator of the 'Returning Earth' Dao-path. This was clearly a targeted move. For Qi Lanyan to deploy him ahead of schedule… I fear it’s a warning."

"Whether he's bluffing with borrowed power or not, he truly does have the ability to make us retreat empty-handed for a time."

Yang Ruiyi was not a fool. He rose and paced two steps before raising an eyebrow.

"Indeed."

Yang Tianyou hesitated before nodding, her voice soft.

"He wouldn’t dare stand against the great tide of destiny. But from his position, while he cannot decide the outcome, he can influence the process. Besides… we will eventually take Shanji and the Xuanmiao Temple, but what else will we lose in the meantime?"

Yang Ruiyi was quiet for a long time, his eyes shut tight. A look of apprehension crossed his face.

"Indeed," he said. "His methods are brilliant."

Yang Tianyou lowered her head, her expression grim.

"But he forgets that Li Zhouwei is no ordinary man. Even if he can’t see the truth of this now, he will in time. This is too damaging to our relations, and I fear it is improper. Not to mention, the Emperor…"

But Yang Ruiyi’s gaze turned cold. He shook his head.

"The ones we should be considering… are the great ones."

Yang Tianyou’s pupils widened in an instant. She took a sharp breath.

'He's right… We haven’t received any new orders. We’ve been letting Wang Ziya run rampant in Baiye, which probably means the great ones, and even the Underworld, have tacitly approved. They’re remaining impartial…'

She had once spoken personally with one of the great ones. Many powerful figures cared deeply about the matter of Bright Yang.

'It isn’t just Mount Luoxia that dislikes Emperor Wei; the Underworld is no friend of his either. Even the fox-kin and the Immortal Mansions… none of them have any goodwill for Li Qianyuan! For Qi Lanyan to make such a move, he must be catering to the preferences of a certain great one in the north.'

A chill seized her heart. She looked up abruptly to see Yang Ruiyi struggling to raise a hand, his eyes still clamped shut.

"Have Lingu Lanying come up."

---

The colors above the water's surface had grown dim. Fading streaks and wisps of light receded into the distance as the great array powered down. Li Ximing retracted his divine ability and took a deep, shuddering breath, the dizzy spell that had afflicted him finally beginning to ease.

'That was a bit too close for comfort.'

Neither Touba Ci nor Gongsun Bei were easy opponents. One was a descendant of the Great Liang imperial line, and the other was a Dawn Qi cultivator wielding a Spiritual Treasure. Either one of them should have been more than enough to suppress him, and even posed a risk of serious injury.

This battle had been fought with the backing of the great array, and the divine effect of his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body had been put to great use. It was what allowed him to hold out against their combined assault. With the timely aid of two Spiritual Treasures and Li Jiangqian’s sudden strike that wounded Gongsun Bei, they had managed to survive until now.

'If anything had gone wrong by even a small margin, I might have been fine, but Jiangqian would have likely been injured…'

He scrambled to his feet and flew up to check on Li Zhouwei. The King of Wei stood atop a brilliant, shining Celestial Gate, retracting his own divine ability with a hint of regret.

Li Zhouwei had rushed here while still wounded, his momentum fearsome as he saved Ting Province. He’d had killing intent in his heart, but Touba Ci and his companion reacted too quickly. With one of his own wounded and another still young on the lake, Li Zhouwei had not pursued them deeply.

'Gongsun Bei is badly hurt. He won't be causing any trouble for a while…'

Of course, Li Zhouwei’s sudden arrival would not be for nothing. With a sweep of his sleeve, the Celestial Gate beside him rumbled, and as the lights faded, a bottle was revealed.

The bottle had a long neck and was the color of azure jade, magnificent and radiant. Coils of Dawn Qi swirled around it, and even held in his hand, it struggled ceaselessly, trying to escape.

It was Gongsun Bei’s Night Supplanting Bottle!

Though the Spiritual Artifact wasn’t forged from any exceedingly rare spiritual materials, its intricate patterns and potent spiritual aura showed that a great deal of effort had gone into its refinement. Among Spiritual Artifacts, it was certainly not of low quality.

'A pity it’s attuned to Dawn Qi. While I can’t use it myself, its greater value is in the loss Gongsun Bei has suffered… When the opportunity arises, I can trade this for some Li Fire or a Whole Pill!'

As he suppressed the bottle, his eyes met Li Ximing’s. Daoist Master Zhaojing looked deeply worried.

"How is your injury?" he asked.

Li Zhouwei knew he was referring to the piercing wound on his face. He touched it with a finger and saw it still came away with golden blood. His expression darkened slightly.

"It’s not severe…" he answered.

"The Rainbow Glow?"

"Yes."

It was the first time Li Zhouwei had been struck by a Heavenly Glow technique from a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator personally taught by a master of Comprehending Profoundity. The experience left a deep impression. Seeing the crimson-robed young man fly over on a plume of fire, he explained,

"It possesses a strange divinity. The wound is infused with Wu Light, making it feel heavy and insidious, extremely difficult to heal."

Li Zhouwei’s Emperor Qi's Light had clashed with his opponent's Heavenly Glow. The colors had flown apart, and his own technique quickly disintegrated. Nearly half the power of that Heavenly Glow had slammed into him. His Primal Summit treasure had nullified twenty percent of it, and his Radiant Sun King's Halberd and other minor abilities shaved off another five percent, leaving a quarter of the full force to land.

Thus, the wound wasn't severe, but it was deep. The trouble was the lingering Wu Light that interfered with his recovery.

Normally, his physical body was harder to heal than that of an ordinary person, but thanks to his Sovereign's Perilous Tread and Illuminating Sun and Moon techniques, his recovery rate was actually a notch faster. Even so, the injury showed no signs of lessening for the time being.

He briefly recounted the events at Baiye Creek.

"Tinglan and Situ Huo went to rescue the forces at Shanji. I saw there was trouble on the lake and folded back…"

But the news from Baiye caused Li Ximing’s expression to change.

"A master of Comprehending Profoundity? Someone from Mount Luoxia came? How can that be… From your description, if this person takes a stand at Baiye, how can the war between north and south even be fought? The Yang clan… what a headache this must be for them."

Li Zhouwei’s face was grim.

"There’s more… I don’t know if this person has cultivated some spell art or possesses a divine ability, but his body was veiled in a thick shroud, concealing his cultivation level. It was only when he used a 'Returning Earth' divine ability that I recognized his Dao Lineage."

Li Ximing sighed.

"I knew something was wrong—they were waiting for you on the north bank! If you hadn't gone to Baiye, you’d still be fighting at the White River… And if you weren't there, Baiye would have fallen. I don't know if Tinglan could have escaped, but if those Buddhist cultivators had turned toward the White River while you were still entangled, it would have been adding frost to snow. Another calamity!"

Li Ximing’s deduction was not wrong; it was highly likely this had been the north’s plan all along. This, however, only made Li Zhouwei more suspicious. A thought suddenly sank in his heart.

'The timing of Yang Ruiyi’s summons was quite clever. Was it intentional or a coincidence… Did he know this would happen?'

He hesitated for only a second before the answer became clear.

'No… Yang Ruiyi himself probably couldn’t have easily handled the situation at Baiye. If he knew about the enemy’s deployment, he should have ordered Tinglan and Situ Huo to abandon Shanji and defend their positions, or even reinforce the White River. That would have surely reduced his losses—not sent me there on a fool’s errand!'

'That Daoist master descended from a Grotto-Heaven. He was likely acting on direct orders that no one could have predicted…'

He shook his head, his thoughts heavy.

"There is something strange about this. I fear… the Yang clan was also caught by surprise."

"So… how should we proceed?" Li Ximing asked, his face clouded with indecision.

"Touba Ci and the other have retreated, but Protector-General Liu is still at the White River. If we let them leave… I’m afraid his position will become precarious."

The King of Wei fell silent for a moment, but it was Li Jiangqian who spoke, his voice quiet.

"As this junior sees it, we must not act rashly. Since Yang Ruizao is by Liu Bai’s side with the nation-suppressing Spiritual Treasure, the Guzhou Cauldron, he cannot be easily defeated. Otherwise, those two would not have crossed the river to pursue us… Now that Baiye has fallen, crossing the river ourselves would be walking right into a trap."

Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes and nodded.

"On the opposite bank, there are at least three mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Although Gongsun Bei is now wounded by my hand, the Way of Great Desire and Zhelu are still there, having come from Baiye—not to mention that Daoist master. With the Yang clan’s plans in disarray, our own safety on the lake must be our first priority."

"Furthermore…"

He sighed, but before he could elaborate, he felt a tremor in the Great Void. A patch of black clouds appeared, from which a streak of dark, turquoise light flew, materializing over the lake into the form of a woman.

It was Lingu Lanying.

Her face was slightly pale as she came to a sudden halt above the water. Her gaze fell upon Li Jiangqian’s face, and she stared for a moment in a daze. But the urgency of the situation left her no time for questions. She immediately looked up.

"Greetings, King of Wei. Lanying has come with orders… Please, Your Highness, hold Ting Province and await reinforcements!"

Li Zhouwei’s expression was grave. He didn’t answer her directly, but instead asked in a low, urgent tone,

"How is Tangdao?"

Lingu Lanying faltered.

"They are still holding on. After Baiye fell, Zhelu and the others immediately moved to the White River. Protector-General Liu received orders and retreated toward Tangdao with Yang Ruizao ahead of time. They are now defending the mountain alongside the master and disciple from Overlook Peak."

"We hear the assault is not fierce. They can hold out for a while longer."

Li Zhouwei frowned.

"In that case, Tangdao is now isolated in the north. Touba Ci and his allies are right across the river, along with Zhelu’s group, and even that Daoist master… Could they not cross the river again at any moment?"

Lingu Lanying flinched. She lowered her gaze and said softly,

"That Daoist master is from a Numinous Treasure Order; he will not cross the river. The Grand General has already dispatched fellow Daoists Chen Yin and Tinglan to reinforce you… The Grand General says… to please rest assured, King of Wei… More aid is on its way!"

She gave a deep bow and then hurried south to deliver her next message. Li Zhouwei had caught the crucial information. His golden eyes narrowed. "Western Shu has not yet made a move. I must ask Martial Uncle to keep watch over the Western Mountains."

Li Ximing could only nod. Li Zhouwei then turned to his second son.

"Protector-General Liu is a pillar of our nation. We cannot sit by and watch him be besieged. I want you to watch the northern shore. If Tangdao is breached and he attempts to break out to the south, do what you can to assist him."

Li Jiangqian understood he was referring to his Spirit Probe technique, which could see for a thousand li. He bowed. "Father, rest assured."

The King of Wei transformed into a streak of light and vanished. Li Ximing, his face etched with worry, departed as well. Li Jiangqian took up a Li-Light artifact and headed north, his mind racing.

'To have me watch the northern shore… there’s likely more than one meaning to that. Grand Martial Uncle is too soft-hearted. Is Father worried that if the north truly shows killing intent, he won’t be ruthless enough to stand his ground?'

---

The divine abilities in the sky above had long since faded, but the cave-abode remained silent. The lamplight flickered restlessly, the only sound the pacing of a man. A map laid out on the main table was covered in so many marks it had become a chaotic mess.

'At Moongaze Lake… they’re actually fighting at Moongaze Lake…'

According to his memory, the Battle of Baihai in his second life had not changed. The Way of Great Desire besieged Tangdao, while Qi Lanyan used Touba Ci, Shilou Yingge, and Gongsun Bei to attack Baiye Creek, with the Maha Buddhists defending Shanji… Forget Ting Province, there hadn't even been a major battle at Baixiang Valley on the opposite shore.

Li Suining stopped by the main seat, a chill creeping into his heart.

"Qi Lanyan… what tricks is he up to now…"

The moment he had felt the ripple of divine abilities in the heavens, Li Suining had been shaken to his core. The Battle of Baihai had indeed taken place in the eighteenth year of Martial Cultivation… but that was in the seventh month. It was currently only the fourth.

'Qi Lanyan has launched the war ahead of schedule… The Great Song… is very likely unprepared…'

This threw all of Li Suining’s own arrangements into chaos.

His eyes darted across the ink-stained map, but he only grew more confused. He looked up sharply to find the man in black and gold robes already standing before him.

"Your Highness…"

Li Suining’s gaze immediately fell upon the deep, seven-colored gash on his face. He felt a jolt and was about to speak, but Li Zhouwei simply raised a hand, his expression grave as he stared at the map.

After only two breaths, his low voice sounded.

"Someone came from a Grotto-Heaven. That is why you did not foresee this."

Li Suining felt as if all the blood in his body had rushed to his head. He snapped his head up, his eyes instantly filled with profound shock and a chilling fear. His lips parted in horror.

"Yao Guanyi?!"

Li Zhouwei looked up sharply, meeting his eyes for an instant before slowly shaking his head.

Li Suining felt the blood drain back out of his head, a wave of heat washing over his limbs. He listened as Li Zhouwei gave a concise summary. "I was ordered to Baiye Creek… We failed to hold it… Touba Ci, Shilou Yingge, and Gongsun Bei… surrounded the White River. Liu Bai held one back, while Gongsun and Touba headed south. I rushed back… and just drove them off…"

A deep chill gripped Li Suining’s heart as he listened. Hearing Li Zhouwei’s description of the mysterious Daoist master, though he felt bewildered, he gradually calmed down. He seized upon the core issue and said urgently,

"A True Monarch’s Dao Lineage must have given an order, perhaps out of displeasure over the Vast Cicada affair. Qi Lanyan is borrowing their might… All arrangements have been disrupted, even the timing of the southern campaign… is wrong!"

Li Zhouwei was not surprised. He had already gleaned much from Yang Ruiyi’s reaction. The war between north and south was, at its core, a restrained conflict. But this move by Qi Lanyan had most certainly caught the Yang family in its calculations as well.

Li Suining’s thoughts mirrored his own. He looked up and whispered,

"Although this junior does not know the north’s current arrangements… this move by Qi Lanyan is absolutely, extremely dangerous!"

He lowered his gaze, his tone rapid.

"Dangerous for himself, and dangerous for the Yang clan!"

Li Zhouwei closed his eyes in thought, then suddenly asked,

"Qi Lanyan is now completely out of control. Don't waste your thoughts on him. Tell me, what is the Underworld’s trump card?"

When Li Zhouwei went to the Wilderness, Yang Ruiyi had mentioned his own plans, all while feigning frustration with pressure from his superiors. But Li Zhouwei hadn’t believed him. That Grand General of the Underworld… absolutely had a card of his own to play.

Li Suining considered for a moment, then gritted his teeth.

"The sword immortal of the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate, the Great Daoist Master of Dui Metal—Lingmei."

Li Zhouwei’s eyebrows shot up.

A Great Daoist Master.

'He… has surpassed the Purple Mystery stage!'

In an instant, everything became crystal clear to Li Zhouwei.

'No wonder!'

What was Yang Ruiyi’s original plan?

To have Liu Bai defend the White River and protect Moongaze Lake, while Situ Huo held the line at Baiye Creek. Li Zhouwei and Yang Ruiyi would then attack Shanji together.

If that was the entirety of the plan, it would have been like drinking poison to quench a thirst. Liu Bai and Situ Huo would not only be under immense pressure, facing the risk of death at any moment, but they also wouldn’t be able to hold out for long. But if a Great Daoist Master of Dui Metal from the Sword Gate, wielding the Great Snow's Severing Edge, were to step out… the situation would be entirely different.

Without that Daoist master from the Grotto-Heaven, having such a four-divine-ability sword cultivator join forces with Li Zhouwei and Yang Ruiyi would be enough to grind Shanji to dust, even if it were made of immortal gold and profound iron. They could have killed their way to the Xuanmiao Temple in one fell swoop.

'And at that point, the Xuanmiao Temple would be defended by Qi Lanyan alone!'

At that moment, it wouldn't matter if they lost the White River or Baiye Creek, or even the entire Jianghuai region. By pulling out the nail of Shanji that was driven deep into their territory and seizing the bridgehead of Xuanmiao, they could consolidate all the forces in eastern Jiangnan. The Jianghuai region would be theirs for the taking.

Li Zhouwei raised his eyebrows.

"Does Qi Lanyan know?"

Li Suining’s voice was somber.

"He has a disciple at his side named Fan Kang, who is also favored by the Heavenly Element."

The King of Wei took a step, murmuring, "Fan… Kang…"

The gold in his eyes slowly turned to ice.

"So… Qi Lanyan launched a preemptive strike to avoid being forced out of Jianghuai. That Daoist master is his backing—a certain great one who indeed does not wish to see things overturned so quickly."

"So what is Qi Lanyan’s plan now? To pull out the two daggers of Baiye and Tangdao, consolidate his forces to protect Shanji, and drag out the war with the Great Song for another two years?"

His words made Li Suining fall silent for a moment. He looked up.

"The north’s plans are difficult to guess… But for now… I’m afraid our only choice is to defend…"

"Wrong."

Li Suining looked up to see the King of Wei’s eyes blazing with a thick, golden light.

"It’s unnecessary," he said coldly. "Qi Lanyan has no need to go to all this trouble. His mind has never been on the war between north and south. He’s schemed against me more than once; I know him."

"Protecting Shanji… does it matter if it’s a year sooner or a year later? By causing such a major shift in the grand scheme, will he not offend the Underworld? Will he not interfere with the plans of some great one?"

"That Daoist master may be there to back him up, but Qi Lanyan would never be so foolish. The process doesn't matter, but the final result does. He won’t even try to defend Shanji. He won't even try to defend the Xuanmiao Temple."

"Stalling for two years is meaningless. Baihai, and indeed Jianghuai… will be lost sooner or later. If it’s lost, it’s lost. Why did Yang Ruiyi order me to hold my ground here and await reinforcements? Qi Lanyan’s target is me. It’s Bright Yang."

"As long as I am in Ting Province, he will bring his forces to the White River, or even to Ting Province itself. Before he leaves, he is determined to suppress me, to wound me gravely, to damage my aura and destiny."

He looked up, his voice like ice.

"Ordering me to defend this place is to accept this suppression. I am to meet Qi Lanyan and his forces with all my men, and it doesn't matter if we fight until the sky goes dark and the sun and moon lose their light, or if a million corpses pile up and our divine abilities are shattered. All that matters is that we tie them down."

"Then Yang Ruiyi can leisurely take Shanji and the Xuanmiao Temple, and even swallow the whole of Jianghuai—thousands of li of territory. The lives of others are unimportant, and since no one dares to kill me, Li Zhouwei, what does it matter?"

Li Suining’s understanding of the situation was profound. He reacted in an instant, his eyes flying open as he gritted his teeth.

"The two sides have joined forces!"

Thunder rolled in his heart. He looked up, about to speak, but the King of Wei stopped him. The smile in his eyes was frigid.

"It’s fine. Understanding is enough. He will not be difficult to deal with."

---

The mountain was shrouded in dense, dark clouds, and the four realms were dim. Qi Lanyan returned on the wind, retracting his arts before the great hall. He tucked his hands into his sleeves and only then strode inside.

His eyes were bright, full of pride and satisfaction.

The lamplight on both sides flickered with the magical breeze. As the Daoist Master walked forward, the cultivators on either side, their faces alight with joy, offered their congratulations.

"Congratulations, my lord!"

"Baiye Creek has been conquered!"

"Tangdao is under siege!"

Stepping into the main hall, he saw Fan Kang hurry forward, fawning.

"Master is brilliant! Li Zhouwei has appeared in Ting Province!"

"Ting Province is good," Qi Lanyan said with a smile. "A place where the star of Martial Cultivation does not shine."

He answered as he walked, his pace never faltering as he entered the rear hall. Silence fell instantly. The long-bearded Daoist master was already standing there, watching him with a smile. Qi Lanyan knew his great task was accomplished.

"I have troubled Martial Uncle Wang," he said.

He then picked up a pot, his spirit soaring, and sat down at the table. He filled Wang Ziya’s cup before pouring his own.

"Even the Yang clan will have to bow their heads now," he laughed.

Wang Ziya glanced at him, and his smile faded. He reached out and grasped the hand Qi Lanyan had hidden in his sleeve. The palm was pitch black, its veins like a spider’s web, dark and grim.

Wang Ziya stroked his white beard, his brow furrowing in alarm.

"You fought him?"

Only then did Qi Lanyan’s expression turn serious.

"The recapture of Baiye… could not be allowed to fail. Naturally, it fell to me to intercept him personally. By tying him down early, the matter at Baiye could proceed smoothly… I just pushed him too hard, and he started fighting for real. I had no choice but to use the Thunder of the Profound Drum to suppress him."

Qi Lanyan smiled, softening his tone.

"He didn’t get away unscathed either."

Wang Ziya seemed unable to understand. He shook his head.

"I don’t have much of my lifespan left. Coming down from the mountain is no great loss, and I have no regrets. But Yangfeng… you are young, with a great future ahead of you. You are the mortal Dao Lineage of Comprehending Profoundity. Why must you act like those cultivators of the mortal realm, throwing yourself into the fray? There is no benefit, and you will only be stained by karma… a world of trouble. When the time comes, who in the grand scheme of Bright Yang will be willing to protect you?"

"Furthermore, if Bright Yang truly succeeds one day, you, and the Viewing Pavilion, will likely be turned to ash."

Qi Lanyan lowered his head, avoiding his gaze. Wang Ziya had no choice but to stop. After a moment of thought, his expression changed.

"What will you do now?"

Qi Lanyan covertly watched his martial uncle’s face. He smiled.

"All that’s left is the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple, but they are like a turtle in a jar. The Way of Great Desire will besiege the mountain, while we will head south to the White River and shake the borders of the Song!"

Wang Ziya shook his head, looking somewhat disheartened.

"And after that?" he asked. He stroked his beard, clearly not supporting Qi Lanyan’s view.

"Know when to stop… My intervention on your behalf is already enough to give the Yang family a major headache. Must you press your advantage?"

"It’s too dangerous! You are not Li Zhouwei; you are not blessed by Bright Yang. Who stands behind you? He can kill Vast Cicada and walk away free, but do you dare kill even a single member of the Yang family?"

"As the lynchpin of Bright Yang, Li Zhouwei is destined to die sooner or later. He fears nothing and dares to kill anyone. His life is already on the gambling table. You still have a future, but right now… you are betting your own life alongside them!"

"Li Zhouwei killing Vast Cicada certainly broke the rules, but my descent from the mountain today is not merely for a tit-for-tat exchange. If we truly provoke the Underworld into a real fight, neither you nor I would be enough to withstand a single breath from them!"

He had put great effort into his admonishment, but Qi Lanyan’s eyes were bright. He was not surprised by the response.

"That is precisely the point. I, Qi Lanyan, have been pushed into this position, barely managing the interests of various factions. The Underworld is determined to reclaim its ancestral lands. As long as I value my life, I must bow my head and admit defeat. It is merely a matter of sooner or later. This is the great tide of the world."

His smile turned grim.

"My initial goal was to suppress Bright Yang, but I never expected the Yang clan’s stance to be so resolute. Since that is the case, I might as well be resolute myself."

"Baihai will be lost. The initiative in Jianghuai will be ceded. This is the south’s bottom line. But I can decide the price the Yang clan must pay to claim Jianghuai! I can decide how much territory they gain after their conquest!"

"If I am willing, even if the Xuanmiao Temple is lost, I can still occupy Tangdao, Baiye Creek, and Chengshui Marsh. This gives me more room to maneuver. For every year I delay, there is another year of benefit. The longer this drags on, the less time Bright Yang will have to accumulate power in the central plains, and the more prepared the Seven Aspects will be… and the greater Yang Ruiyi’s headache will become!"

Qi Lanyan paused.

"And the smaller the impact will be on Martial Uncle Wei."

Wang Ziya had never been able to understand his obsession with fighting the Great Song to the death. But upon hearing this last sentence, the gloom in his heart deepened.

"You… so this is… no wonder!"

Qi Lanyan began to laugh.

"This is a scheme in broad daylight. I am telling Yang Ruiyi plainly that I dare not refuse to cede Jianghuai, but I am determined to crush Bright Yang! I will ensure that Li Zhouwei gains not a shred of merit from the loss of this vast eastern Huai river region. I will see him so grievously wounded that he must recuperate for ten, even twenty years, ensuring he gains no glory from the subsequent campaigns in Jianghuai or even Qilu!"

"As long as Martial Uncle watches the east for me, if Li Zhouwei is at the White River, I will fight him at the White River. If he is at Baiye Creek, I will attack Baiye Creek. And if he is in Ting Province… I will go there even if the entire world is watching! I will humiliate and persecute him, kill his descendants, and damage his destiny!"

Wang Ziya was visibly moved. He shook his head, trying to calm his incredulous heart, and whispered,

"You… you are too stubborn… you place too much importance on this grand destiny! Have you… have you considered Xuanlou? Does he truly care about this?"

But Qi Lanyan ignored him, his demeanor unnervingly calm.

"The most crucial point is that he is not the one making the decisions. The Underworld’s attention to the mortal realm far exceeds that of the mountain sects. The Yang clan will surely prefer to simply reclaim Jianghuai, rather than face me head-on in a decisive battle… This is not a matter for Yang Ruiyi alone."

"Both sides will be pleased to see this happen."

"After this is over, I will withdraw from the mortal world. I will beg to enter the mountains. Since Martial Uncle Wang was willing to come here for me, a great one will surely be willing to accept me in the future. I will vanish from this world, and no one will ever find me."

"He is already at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm; this is the time when Bright Yang is weak and obscure. This heavy blow must be struck now, preventing him from building upon the glory of killing Vast Cicada and from consolidating his merits in the central plains. He will never be able to find me afterward. Even if he later becomes a Great Daoist Master, arrives at Weidu Prefecture, and is about to ascend to the True Dao, Bright Yang will forever remember this unavenged grievance!"

Wang Ziya stared at him, stunned.

"And if you fail to retreat successfully?"

Qi Lanyan’s eyes held a smile, but it was brimming with cold cruelty.

"I know what Martial Uncle is implying. They care about face; I do not. I am not afraid of offending those great ones who wish for Bright Yang's return to its rightful position—the worst that can happen is death! If I perish, can Li Zhouwei track me down to the Underworld to seek his revenge?"

Wang Ziya’s face changed dramatically.

"Must it come to this?"

"Must it come to this?" Qi Lanyan laughed. "Martial Uncle knows I possess a Heavenly Element scion, so you know what drives me. I entered the mountains at the age of six, but after ten years, I still could not sense Qi. I was cast out. The snow fell thick and fast. My father was already dead, and my uncle deemed me a failure for wasting a decade. It was my grandmaster and Martial Uncle Wei who took me in."

"Later, my grandmaster passed away. His only regret was failing to achieve the Dao. He held Martial Uncle’s hand tightly and said… ‘To restrain the Yin and master the Yang—this is the sole purpose of Xuanlou!’ The snow was still falling heavily then. This is the dream of three generations of Guanhua!"

Qi Lanyan’s gaze was like ice as he smiled.

"He may not care, but I must!"

"‘To ride the golden path to the Three Profound Halls, without power, no monarch earns respect. To ascend requires the Mandate of Heaven; learn not from the fallen Qin and Tang.’ The great Wuguan himself lamented as much. Martial Uncle need not try to persuade me further!"

Wang Ziya fell silent again, a grave look in his eyes. He suddenly felt that the person before him was completely different from the one he remembered. A doubt began to form, and his expression wavered.

'The Grotto-Heavens of Numinous Treasures enjoy endless Dao Lineages and use lavish resources… yet for years they have produced no golden talent, suffering one setback after another… I, too, had high hopes placed upon me… yet I have fallen to the point where my Dao-path is dictated by others. The younger generation, regardless of their talent, likely cannot even match the decisiveness of this Qi Lanyan!'

'Could it be true, as Yao Guanyi said, that there are "no heroic spirits left in the Grotto-Heavens"?'

He was lost in a daze when he heard a thud. The man before him had dropped to his knees, performing a grand bow. Wang Ziya was startled and quickly stepped aside to avoid it.

"What are you doing?"

Qi Lanyan stared fixedly into his eyes.

"This junior will never forget Martial Uncle’s kindness. The fact that you came here today proves that my actions are not entirely wrong… If, for my father’s sake, you have even a sliver of desire to see me succeed… please tell me… the great one’s command!"

Wang Ziya was silent, not knowing how to answer. After a long moment, he let out a breath.

"King Wei killed Vast Cicada. I, too, must eliminate someone to consider this matter settled."
