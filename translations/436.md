# Chapter 591: Starry Night Over The Cloudy Sea

Tu Longjian, dressed in black, lowered the long hammer resting on his shoulder and stored it in his storage pouch before stepping forward. He glanced at Li Yuanjiao and thought to himself, Back then, I only saw the light of this artifact but never met this benefactor in person. It's possible he was already killed and the artifact was taken. I'll need to test him carefully to avoid any mistakes.

He stepped forward, cupped his fist slightly, and greeted softly, "Greetings, fellow Daoist!"

The figure shrouded in the Profound Patterned Spirit Mist remained highly alert, immediately putting away the jade bottle and turning toward Tu Longjian. A slightly hoarse voice emerged from within the mist, "I have gathered enough of this fire baleful qi. The rest is yours."

He seemed unwilling to cause trouble and gave a short response before turning to leave. But Tu Longjian couldn't let him go so easily. He stepped forward again, smiling as he said, "Fellow Daoist, do you recall the heir of Slaughter Jun? We met briefly on the borders of Profound Peak back then."

Tu Longjian kept his words vague, fearing the man might have killed his benefactor and stolen the artifact. The figure in the mist paused briefly and asked doubtfully, "You... are Tu Longjian? You have already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

Hearing this, Tu Longjian did not relax his guard. Many people knew his name. He cautiously replied, "Senior, do you recall the spell I carried with me back then? What kind of spell was it?"

Li Yuanjiao hesitated for a moment. He of course remembered the Yang Nourishing Technique, a spell his family had used to convert Long Marching Fire Essence into a usable Grade Four cultivation method. Using a slightly uncertain tone, he replied, "Yang Nourishing Technique?"

"Ha!" At this confirmation, Tu Longjian finally felt sure he was speaking to the right person. Genuine joy lit up his face as he exclaimed, "Senior, I have been searching for you everywhere!"

The Profound Patterned Spirit Mist around Li Yuanjiao's figure dissipated slightly, revealing his appearance. He studied Tu Longjian carefully for a moment before saying softly, "Your accomplishments now are a continuation of Slaughter Jun Dao lineage. That is a good thing."

Rather than emphasizing the favor he had done, Li Yuanjiao chose to highlight his connection to the Slaughter Jun Dao lineage. After all, the reason he had spared Tu Longjian back then was due to his ties to the Dao lineage. Hearing this, Tu Longjian's eyes reddened slightly. He nodded and said, "Indeed. If my master and elders could see the man I have become today, they would surely smile. That would be enough for me."

After a brief pause, Tu Longjian retrieved a reddish token from his robes. Black on the top and red on the bottom, its flowing lines caused Li Yuanjiao to narrow his eyes slightly. Tu Longjian gently held the token aloft, performing a hand seal as he activated it, and asked, "May I ask senior's name?"

The fire baleful qi immediately surged toward the token, pouring into it in a steady stream. Within a few breaths, the baleful qi was completely absorbed. Tu Longjian put the token away, and only then did Li Yuanjiao fully disperse the mist concealing his face.

"Li Yuanjiao," he answered.

Tu Longjian looked him over, finding that Li Yuanjiao's demeanor matched his expectations. Smiling, he asked, "Senior, are you here at Green Pine Temple hoping to enter the grotto heaven?"

Li Yuanjiao replied softly, "Just trying my luck. The grotto heaven is not something one can enter at will... If I cannot gain entry, collecting some spiritual qi would suffice."

Tu Longjian nodded and said in a quiet tone, "If senior is interested, why not join forces with me for a few days on the island? It might serve as mutual support."

Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes slightly and asked, "Do you have any companions? If we are to join forces, please introduce them."

Tu Longjian chuckled and said lightly, "This junior has traveled alone and has no companions."

Li Yuanjiao was somewhat surprised. After a brief moment of thought, he nodded and said, "Very well. I too am alone. Allow me to attend to something, and I will return shortly."

"Please go ahead, senior," Tu Longjian said with a humble fist cup. He watched as Li Yuanjiao flew off on the wind, then sat cross-legged, deep in thought, His cultivation method is rather ordinary, with nothing particularly remarkable. At most, he seems like a clan cultivator... Back then, I was just a lowly Qi Cultivator, my talents yet undiscovered. It shouldn't have been possible for someone to have schemed against me in advance.

Tu Longjian stroked his chin as he thought to himself, This is a matter of life and death. Having a helper is always good... Even if I can't escape in the end, leaving treasures or other things to repay a favor is better than letting the Daoist Masters have them.

As Li Yuanjiao rode the wind away, he too was mulling things over with some surprise.

Tu Longjian had not suggested bringing him into the grotto heaven, and Li Yuanjiao wasn't in a rush. Staying close to Tu Longjian was enough, as the young cultivator was already a focal point of many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' attention. It was only a matter of time before he entered the grotto heaven.

To Tu Longjian, Li Yuanjiao likely appeared to be just a clan cultivator. Perhaps Tu Longjian was planning to wait for the grotto heaven to manifest more clearly before pretending to enter it by chance.

But given the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' careful arrangements, Tu Longjian likely had a method to bring a few disciples into the grotto heaven. Yet, he appeared to have no companions, which was curious.

Pondering this, Li Yuanjiao soon found Li Qinghong.

The grotto heaven was incredibly dangerous, so it was impossible for Li Yuanjiao to bring the Immortal Mirror inside. Without saying much, he handed the artifact to her and said softly, "There may be Purple Mansion Realm cultivators guarding the perimeter of the island. Be vigilant."

Li Qinghong understood Li Yuanjiao's concern: using the Immortal Mirror to detect spirit treasures could appear as though she possessed foreknowledge, potentially arousing suspicion. She nodded and replied softly, "I understand."

Li Yuanjiao took off, soaring into the sky and gradually disappearing. Li Qinghong remained at her post amidst the waves for a while before returning to her temporary dwelling on the sea.

Li Yuanjiao's errand took only a few hours, and he soon returned to Green Pine Island. He found Tu Longjian holding a golden hammer in one hand and a small storage pouch in the other, examining it carefully.

A headless corpse kneeled before Tu Longjian, its body covered in green spots emitting a strong pine-like fragrance. In the brief moment since Li Yuanjiao landed, the spots had begun sprouting, growing into small branches and leaves.

As Li Yuanjiao descended, Tu Longjian cupped his fist slightly and said, "An unwise fool crossed my path earlier. I have already dealt with him."

He chuckled and added, "The grotto heaven is about to manifest, and the activity in the great void will surely be spectacular. Even if a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator dies, it will not cause much of a stir, which saves us from drawing unnecessary attention."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, glancing at the corpse. Whatever anomaly the body had caused had been suppressed, leaving no clue of the deceased's cultivation level. Tu Longjian approached with a cheerful expression and said, "Senior, why not walk with me around the island?"

————

At the edge of the island, Li Xuanfeng stood silently in midair, holding his bow without speaking. On the ground below, Zhong Qian and Kan Ziyu were carefully arranging a formation. Nearby, Lin Chensheng hovered in the air, observing quietly.

Lacking knowledge of formations, both Li Xuanfeng and Lin Chensheng merely waited. Zhong Qian and Kan Ziyu remained deeply focused on their work. Suddenly, Lin Chensheng's low voice echoed in Li Xuanfeng's ears, "Daoist Xuanfeng, are you a branch of Daoist Master Yuan Su's lineage?"

Li Xuanfeng remained unmoved, responding softly with a voice carried by mana, "That is correct. May I ask where you are from?"

Lin Chensheng's expression remained calm as he replied, "I am the nephew of Daoist Master Houfu."

Daoist Master Houfu was a rising figure of the Great Xiukui Temple, a young and powerful cultivator with the potential to lead the temple in the future. Lin Chensheng's background was not insignificant. Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly as Lin Chensheng continued, "When we enter the grotto heaven, Daoist Ziyu and I will propose that we act separately. I suggest you do the same—it is better to proceed alone."

"Hm?" Li Xuanfeng frowned slightly.

Lin Chensheng elaborated through secret transmission, "In places like this, traveling with others is not ideal. You are more likely to become a stepping stone for others than to gain anything worthwhile."

Li Xuanfeng fell silent for a moment before replying, "Thank you for the warning."

Lin Chensheng smiled faintly, "No need to be overly polite. When we are in the grotto heaven, we can look out for each other if needed."

Li Xuanfeng nodded. By this time, the two below had finished their formation and ascended on the wind. Kan Ziyu said, "The great formation is ready. Everything is in place; we just need the grotto heaven to descend."

The four exchanged a few words before entering a meditative state. The light between heaven and earth shifted several times as the day turned to evening. Finally, Lin Chensheng spoke abruptly, "It is coming."

Li Xuanfeng exhaled and raised his gaze, spotting a brilliant light appearing above Green Pine Island.

The light took the shape of a shallow arc, purple at the top and white at the bottom, slowly emerging from the great void. Five colors shimmered across the arc, which descended gradually toward the earth.

As the arc drew closer to the ground, more of its form became visible. Vast mountain ranges rose and fell within the clouds, faintly visible amidst the mist. Streams of light flickered and roamed across the terrain, casting an ethereal glow.

Boom!

A deafening thunderclap echoed through the sky as ochre-colored gold and stone fragments rained down. Out of nowhere, waterfalls cascaded from the air, transforming from purple-gold hues into blue-gold streams before landing below and swirling into violent deep-blue winds. These winds grew dense, turning fiery red as flames erupted, coalescing into crystalline formations.

The elements of earth, water, wind, and fire cycled in succession, producing countless streaks of light that shot off in all directions. The sea churned violently, its waters responding in kind by surging upward with torrents of multicolored spirit water.

A swarm of rogue cultivators leaped into the air, engaging in chaotic battles overhead. Li Xuanfeng and his group ignored the fray, shielding Zhong Qian as their formation activated with a thunderous roar.

One by one, the formation's glowing lines lit up, and with a muffled blast, all color vanished from Li Xuanfeng's sight. Everything became stark black and white. His thoughts grew sluggish as the objects before him stretched endlessly, distorting until they resolved into streams of black-and-white lines converging at a distant point.

An electrifying jolt shot through his mind, followed by a sudden shift in vision. Darkness gave way to dazzling silver and white.

The ground beneath him disappeared, and Li Xuanfeng suddenly found himself standing above an endless sea of clouds. Overhead, a boundless starry sky stretched into the distance, its brilliance unmatched. Beyond the clouds, distant mountain ranges rose and fell, shrouded in an eerie silence.

The Green Pine Grotto Heaven? Li Xuanfeng immediately surveyed his surroundings and noticed Zhong Qian and the others standing nearby, their faces filled with awe.

Lin Chensheng whispered, "This should be Green Pine Temple."

He raised his head to gaze at the stars and said in amazement, "As expected, the stars within this grotto heaven do not move."

At this, the group instinctively lifted their heads to observe. Sure enough, every star appeared fixed in the heavens, glowing like immovable points of light. Unlike the stars of the outside world, which shifted, intersected, and realigned, these stars remained static.

Li Xuanfeng's gaze fell upon a cluster of seven bright stars resembling a ladle, and he said softly, "There are no sun or moon in this grotto heaven... only stars?"

"Correct," Lin Chensheng replied, his eyes scanning the sea of clouds as if searching for something.

He exchanged a glance with Kan Ziyu before the two cupped their fist respectfully and said, "Now that we have entered the grotto heaven, let us part ways and seek our fortunes independently."

Zhong Qian was slightly surprised by their words, as though he had more to say. However, seeing Li Xuanfeng also bid farewell with a cupped fist, Zhong Qian could only nod and say, "Take care, everyone!"

Parting ways with the others, Li Xuanfeng carried his golden bow and flew north for a while. After pausing in mid-air for several breaths, he glanced down at the endless sea of clouds below him.

"I wonder what lies beneath," he murmured.

Forming a hand seal, a golden protective shield flared around his body. He cautiously descended into the clouds. A pale, moonlit mist surrounded him, and after a single breath, the dense layers of clouds began to thin and disperse.

"It seems one enters this place at a high altitude," he observed. Breaking through the bottom of the cloud layer, Li Xuanfeng finally saw what lay ahead and froze in astonishment.

Beneath him stretched another vast sea of clouds, endless and boundless. Above him remained the same endless starry sky, brilliant and infinite. In the distance, the mountain ranges rose and fell, winding endlessly—the same scene he had just witnessed.

Li Xuanfeng looked up and noticed that the ladle-shaped cluster of seven bright stars had now flipped upside down. If there was any difference between this view and the one above the clouds, this was the only distinction.
𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑛𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮

For a moment, he stood bewildered before realization struck, "There is no land here at all. Beneath the clouds is another starry night."

He carefully summoned the wind, breaking through the sea of clouds as he moved forward, a growing question forming in his mind, If that's the case, then if there's a treasure above, might there also be one below?

Suppressing the thought, he focused on the surrounding emptiness of the sea of clouds. This wasn't a place to waste time wandering aimlessly. Fixing his eyes on a distant mountain range, he directed his windborne path toward it.

Boom!

After flying for nearly an hour, a thunderous explosion echoed from the distant horizon. Li Xuanfeng glanced toward the source of the sound and saw several figures locked in a fierce battle over the sea of clouds.

The combatants wore a mix of garments, some bearing traces of mainland sects. At the center of the group was a cultivator holding two large bronze bowls high above his head. Within the bowls, purple lightning swirled, releasing strikes of profound lightning that struck his opponents.

His attackers surrounded him, each wielding different weapons—long swords, hand seals, and spells. Their robes and garb revealed their diverse origins, yet they had formed a temporary alliance to besiege him. Among them, one man in a golden robe wielded twin blades, his expression fierce as he shouted, "Miao Ye! Hand over the Hidden Cloud Orb at once! Stop wasting everyone's time!"

The central figure, Miao Ye, showed no fear. Chuckling coldly, he continued to wield the bronze bowls, intensifying the surge of purple light. Meanwhile, his opponents, though cooperating, hesitated to reveal their own trump cards, resulting in a stalemate.

The dual-blade wielder's expression grew increasingly grim. He clearly didn't want to waste more time here, but he couldn't bring himself to abandon the treasure in the other's hands. His face shifted multiple times as he wavered between choices.

Li Xuanfeng had no intention of provoking trouble and didn't want to attract suspicion by passing directly through the area. He planned to dive into the surrounding mist and bypass the skirmish from another direction.

However, the lightning-wielding cultivator with the bronze bowls laughed and taunted, "Situ Chen, you better leave now. If you wait too long, everything will already have been divided up!"

Li Xuanfeng froze in midair, narrowing his eyes as he scrutinized the dual-blade wielder, Situ Chen. A thoughtful expression crossed his face as his hand slowly reached behind him to unfasten the longbow on his back.
