# Chapter 725: Surplus Wealth

Li Qinghong’s pupils dilated slightly and the violet light in her eyes faded significantly. She had already stowed away the Duruo Spear, exhaled softly, brought her delicate hands together, and said gently, "Qinghong greets senior."

Li Qinghong remembered that day all too clearly. Chi Buzi’s soul had seemed damaged, and she didn’t know if he still recalled what happened. So she left it at that, simply calling him senior.

If Chi Buzi had indeed lost his memory, then it would be as if the two had never met. And if he was merely some Water Mansion Immortal Official, then her words would not be out of place either.

Chi Buzi, hair loose and unkempt, said nothing. He sat down on a nearby stone bench and his pale cyan eyes was fixed on her.

He had achieved the Purple Mansion Realm many years ago, and cultivated the Pristine Water Dao, which revolved around the balance of clarity and murk. Naturally, his appearance was refined and his presence ethereal. Yet in his eyes lingered something strange, something twisted and eerie. He parted his lips slightly and spoke in a low voice, "Li Qinghong, you recognize me."

Though he smiled, his words were cold like snow in the depths of winter, falling all over Li Qinghong’s body. She lowered her gaze and spoke, "Senior jests... Qinghong has cultivated for decades and never once laid eyes on a Purple Mansion Realm master. How could I be so fortunate as to witness a real Immortal’s presence..."

Chi Buzi sat quietly in the guest seat and used no divine abilities. Yet his presence was overwhelming, pressing heavily on Li Qinghong’s chest where she stood.

Dong, dong, dong...

The spring within the cave residence began to echo, its once-clear waters slowly turning a murky gray. Chi Buzi lifted his brow and said with a smile, "Li Qinghong, I can see it clearly. You're afraid of me, whether from guilt or fear itself. You may have methods to resist divine ability, but I can see it all."

Chi Buzi gazed at her calmly and continued, "That time, I likely used a soul searching technique and accidentally touched that one's Metallic Essence, that’s why I ended up like that. But this time... I won’t be careless."

The golden sash at his waist glowed faintly with spell-light. Chi Buzi rose and paced two steps atop the platform, speaking in a low voice, "I guessed it was your family, so I dared not return to Moongaze Lake. But after much searching, I found this Zongquan Island in the outer seas. So, I waited here."

Chi Buzi clasped his hands behind his back, standing with his back to the cave’s source of light. On his pale hands were two faint lines, and he spoke gently, "Now that Pristine Water has gone to the Outer Heavens and has no strength to oversee things here, I came. Li Qinghong."

He slowly turned around. From his pale cyan pupils emerged a terrifying murky qi, gathering into a mist-like haze that curled upward from the corners of his eyes. He asked, "And who’s the master? Yingze? Shexian? Or the one from the Water Mansion?"

Li Qinghong didn’t answer, only feeling the suffocating pressure in the cave intensify. She dissected Chi Buzi’s words, line by line and quickly arrived at a conclusion, 'I guessed it was your family'... 'you're afraid of me'. Chi Buzi's memory is definitely fragmented. Otherwise, he wouldn't be guessing, he'd remember what happened that day clearly.

There’s a ninety percent chance that he forgot what happened at the lake. Whether he truly forgot or merely dared not remember, it makes no difference!

Chi Buzi seemed indifferent, but those pale cyan eyes of his were clearly gauging her expression. He said, "Li Qinghong, that one left something in my soul, you must know this."

He smiled slightly, revealing sharp white teeth, beckoned with a finger, and whispered, "I didn’t dare think of it at all. I just wandered the Eastern Sea with that foolish Immortal Official, pointing everything out to him one by one, unraveling all his precious constructs. And so, his spirit wavered and he lost his foundation.

"Once his spirit wavered, he made the wrong choice. And then I consumed that foolish Immortal Official and swallowed all his cultivation. Only then did I dare to think again. You underestimated me, as did Chi Wei, Yuan Xiu and Pristine Water."

His tone remained calm, "I'm not some fool easily suppressed. The methods used to keep other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators obedient don’t work on me.

"I've already devoured the Immortal Official, it was a true tonic. It allowed me to master a fourth divine ability, one called Chougui Hidden Form. It conceals all dharmas within the body, and can do many, many things."

He walked to the head seat and slowly sat down, facing the glow of the cave, speaking softly, "The fact that you don’t dare kill me proves you’ve not yet reached the Golden Core Realm. You wish to reclaim your Fruition Attainment and to do that, Pristine Water must be eliminated."

Chi Buzi gave a faint smile and said gently, "How Pristine Water’s Fruition Attainment is dealt with, I won’t covet. I only ask for a single Golden Core, whether it’s a surplus position or an intercalary one, I ask only for that. The master will need someone like me..."

His expression was sincere, his tone gentle, "If the master wishes to reclaim Fruition Attainment or even ascend to immortal rank, you will need a capable hand. Trust me. In such a filthy world, whether for righteous path or heretical, people like me are the true sharp blades. The Immortal Official types... will only make more and more of a mess."

Chi Buzi didn’t wait for Li Qinghong to respond and said softly, "Whether Pristine Water will return gravely injured, whether Shangyuan will be struck down and retreat to Fruition Attainment. I, a mere Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, cannot see clearly. But the master surely can. If there is any command, you may stir fate itself to guide this humble one, Buzi will know."

It sounded like a pledge, yet also a subtle probe. He continued in a low voice, "But if this humble one dies, Pristine Water will surely notice. I fear it may jeopardize master’s plans."

Li Qinghong understood these words weren’t meant for her. She remained silent. Chi Buzi rose from the high seat, descended step by step, and came to stand before her, smiling and said, "Buzi takes his leave."

His figure vanished like a gust of murky wind, slipping into the cracks of stone and disappearing into the great void.

Li Qinghong remained standing in the courtyard, unsure whether the ‘master’ Chi Buzi spoke of was truly watching. She stood still for two breaths, then sat cross-legged, silently digesting everything Chi Buzi had said.

Qunyi Strait.

Chi Buzi moved through the great void, plunging deep beneath the sea. After traveling over five thousand kilometers, he stopped on a desolate, uninhabited island.

His hands, hidden in his sleeves, still trembled uncontrollably. His breath was rapid, and the calm, composed demeanor from earlier had long since vanished. His vision darkened with lingering panic.

"Damn it... That was a True Monarch or maybe even an immortal..." Chi Buzi panted as he tried to steady himself. The fact that he hadn't yet exploded into a puddle of blue water meant the True Monarch had at least partially accepted what he said.

"To bargain with a tiger... It's a desperate move, but the only one I have..." Chi Buzi’s expression darkened gradually as he muttered, "Pristine Water must know that the current Dao requires blending purity and turbidity to be successful. Yet he deceived Chi Rui and Chi Wei completely, handing down that Five Elements Command Metal Technique. He clearly just wants to keep them from breaking through!

"Right... Muhai said it himself, he’s strained everything to suppress the dragon nature of his Fruition Attainment. How could he possibly allow anyone else to attain a surplus or intercalary position? He fears being usurped more than anything!"

Chi Buzi’s gaze was steeped in shadow, like a venomous serpent. He muttered to himself, "If I want to reach the Golden Core Realm, staying under Pristine Water only leads to death! I’d be thrown into that Pristine Gui Pool eventually... If I can’t reach the Golden Core Realm in this life, what’s the point of living? Better to die now!"

He had nothing to lose. He didn’t fear being struck down by the Li Family’s True Monarch, or being discovered by Pristine Water. If he couldn’t break through to the Golden Core Realm, it was only a matter of time before he died anyway.

Let it be death then. I’ll try it anyway! Chi Buzi’s thoughts churned as he considered, That one is likely Water Virtue too, it’s able to navigate both sides. If I get a clear read on them, and they falter. Then, once things are done with Pristine Water’s backing, I might still have a chance at Golden Core Realm...

Mount Qingdu.

Li Xijun rode the wind back from the lake’s edge and landed atop the mountain. He had seen strange phenomena in both the north and east. Not only the Li Family, but the entire Jiangnan region was in turmoil, with everyone anxious and afraid.

Li Ximing had long since entered seclusion to cultivate, but Li Xijun had to stay alert to the situation. The Li Family’s forces in Milin Prefecture were gradually being reinforced, and a few branches had been transferred in as they were preparing to establish several peak offices.

After all, Milin Prefecture was quite vast, it was even broader than the family’s original territory. Distributing several peaks across it was more than feasible.

Just as Li Xijun entered the main hall, he saw a young man standing within. The young man was graceful and noble, clad in white robes, with an extraordinary presence. Li Xijun’s eyes lit up and he said with a smile on his face, "Brother Xizhi!"

The visitor was naturally Li Xizhi. Though he had stayed the night at Xia Mountain, in the end, he couldn’t rest easy. He flew back alone, leaving Yang Xiao’er safely behind at the mountain.

He nodded to his younger brother and spoke softly, "True Monarch Shangyuan has now successfully broken through in the Northern Sea, you must’ve heard."

Seeing Li Xijun nod, he gave a rough overview of the situation across the Four Seas. Just then, Li Chengliao flew up to the peak. Upon seeing Li Xizhi, his eyes lit up, and he bowed, "The family branches in Milin have all been settled. We’re surveying the earth veins now, and selecting several mountains to establish new peak offices."

Li Xijun replied in a low voice. Outside, the sound of a gentle drizzle began. Li Chengliao seemed uneasy and gave the falling rain a slight glance.

Li Xijun also felt a faint chill in his heart. Strange omens had been appearing frequently in recent days. He couldn’t help but worry for his elder brother Li Xicheng, who was in seclusion. While he was still processing the thought, someone came up from below.

The woman who approached was graceful and striking. It was Li Minggong, eldest of the Radiant Lure generation. Her cultivation wasn’t high, still only at the early-stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and her face carried sorrow as she cupped her hands and said, "Reporting to Eighth Uncle... Eldest Uncle’s life jade has shattered."

Li Xijun froze in place for a moment, so this was the reason for the rain. Beside him, Li Chengliao’s eyes turned red upon hearing news of his father’s death. He stood there, stunned.

Li Xicheng was Li Xijun’s elder brother. Both of them had lost their father young, and the bond between them ran deep. Though he had a faint premonition, Li Xijun still stood frozen in place. Li Xizhi, unaware that Li Xicheng had been in seclusion attempting a breakthrough, showed a faint expression of grief and asked quietly, "What happened!"

The group swiftly rode the wind, descending like lightning into the underground Water Mansion of Mount Qingdu. Only then did they notice the dampness of the cave. When they reached the stone door where the seclusion chamber lay, droplets of water covered the surrounding walls.

Seeing this, Li Xizhi immediately understood. He lowered his gaze in silence, while Li Xijun hesitated for a moment before ultimately instructing Li Chengliao to open the chamber. At the same time, he turned to Li Minggong and ordered, "Elder Brother has many children, go summon them here."

Li Minggong nodded. With a sword at her waist and graceful bearing, she replied, "Messengers have already been sent. They’ll be arriving shortly, along with several elders from the chief’s court."

Years ago, when Li Ximing abdicated his position, Li Xicheng had been appointed in his place and later became head of the family. That role was then passed to Li Chengliao. His death was no small matter, it warranted the presence of the family elders.

By custom and courtesy, it fell to Li Chengliao to handle his father’s remains, while the other matters were left to Li Xijun. He quickly composed himself, observing as several youths entered the Water Mansion. They were nervous and reserved.

These were Chengliao’s younger siblings, some with low aptitude, others mere mortals. The Li Family's system was harsh in this regard. Most of these children had never even been to Qingdu, and every action they took was scrutinized because of their birth. All of them stood in silence.

Li Xijun took the time to ask their names, noticing their clothes were worn and modest. Before he could inquire further, the family elders arrived. Led by Li Xuanxuan, most of them were white-haired elders. Li Xuanxuan’s beard trembled slightly as he sighed in sorrow.

A few members of the chief’s court stood behind the current chief, Li Zhouwei. The heir stood quietly, head bowed, tightly gripping the jade slip in his hand, his fingertips slightly pale.

Having observed everyone carefully, Li Xijun finally spoke in a soft voice, "According to custom, the contents of Elder Brother’s storage pouch and cave residence go to Chengliao. The remaining spiritual assets and treasures shall be distributed among his children. We are all present to witness. You may begin the reading."

With that said, he waited for Li Zhouwei to handle the division. But the young man cupped his hands slightly and replied, "Grandfather left one residence, two meditation cushions, and a single incense burner. They are valued at three Spirit Stones. It's insufficient for division, so it was converted into three hundred jin of spirit paddy. Fifty jin for each child."

At these words, Li Xuanxuan froze. The elders all looked to one another, expressions shifting. Li Xizhi exchanged only a glance with Li Xuanxuan and both understood what the other was thinking, Chengliao and Zhouwei aren’t the type to covet wealth... so why are they making such a poor show of it?

After a moment of silence, one man stepped forward. He was Li Xicheng’s second son who was now married, with a grown beard. He bowed respectfully and said, "Honored elders, my grandfather left behind no remains. My father endured hardship since youth and disdained luxury. The things he acquired in life were all gifted to struggling cultivators, both inside and outside the family. While cultivating in Qingdu, his residence held not a single spirit item."

His words left the hall in silence. Li Xijun nodded slightly. Beside him, Li Zhouwei added, "Honored elders, Grandfather governed the household for seventeen years and he left behind no surplus wealth."

Li Xizhi listened in silence, and suddenly remembered the year he left home at twelve to enter the sect. He remembered how his elder brother Li Xicheng had used his savings to buy him an Embryonic Breathing Realm jade pendant.

That year, Li Xicheng had insisted on placing it in his hand. Coming from the Xiao Family on his mother's side, and with his father then the family head, Li Xizhi had grown up in luxury. Holding that jade felt like grasping burning coal.

The jade pendant wasn’t even as refined as those issued to Azure Pond Sect disciples. Yet he had worn it for years, fastened to his wrist until he no longer noticed it.

Now, he felt the cool touch of the pendant against his skin, its presence suddenly sharp. Hearing the words ‘no surplus wealth,’ an ache welled in his chest.

Li Xijun, who had spent many years with his elder brother, felt it even more deeply. His heart grew heavy, Elder Brother always believed he had stolen Ximing’s rightful place... He treaded as if on thin ice. Though called a young master, he never received a young master's due... Not even from himself.

As he was lost in thought, several family elders began murmuring among themselves. Li Xizhi turned his head toward Li Xijun and spoke gently, "Elder Brother was never one for words, only action. When Ximing emerges from seclusion, someone must tell him... That burden he threw down at eighteen, our elder brother carried all of it and he carried it well."
