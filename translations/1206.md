# Chapter 1206: Zhonggong

'Cheng Qian.'

The Li Fire surged, its brilliance like a mist. The Daoist Master concealed himself within the Great Void, pondering.

'This man is no simple character either. It's just that his hand is forced in all matters, and he has no choice but to go with the flow. The Whole Pill is good, but it has its drawbacks.'

If his sister hadn't cultivated the Whole Pill, Cheng Qian's importance would be truly extraordinary. But with Li Que'wan's success, Li Jiangqian now found it inconvenient that Cheng Qian shared her Dao lineage; when the time came to divide resources, the situation would become unpleasant.

'As for the family's most critical matter—the Supreme Yin spiritual essence—it's impossible to let him get involved.'

Still, even if his role was somewhat diminished, the daily applications of a Whole Pill cultivator were far greater than those of other Dao lineages. After a moment's thought, Li Jiangqian mused:

'Let him shoulder some of my sister's other burdens. Once the great formation is about to be established, I'll find an excuse to summon him here for three to five months in preparation for any moves from the Western Shu.'

Li Jiangqian arrived at the Chengyun Gate riding a plume of fire, where he was met with a dazzling scene of brilliance. The immortal sect was vast, with white qi cascading like a waterfall. The entire mountain range was shrouded in an awe-inspiring, pure energy that shone with a clear light amidst a kaleidoscope of colors.

"What a grand scene... Watersign Ridge... this is likely the most peaceful and untouched land in all of Jianghuai."

It was a rare and marvelous thing. This group of demonic cultivators from across the sea had established a sect and passed down their traditions, and despite encountering the greatest upheaval Jiangnan had seen in a century, the common folk living under their rule were the most prosperous. They were even more at peace than those on Moongaze Lake. Li Jiangqian swept his gaze over the scene and sneered inwardly:

'This Daoist Master Changyun really picked a good spot. His fist is strong, and his backing is deep...'

He descended on his fire, and disciples from below immediately came to greet him. They respectfully led him inside the formation, where he saw golden thunder rolling within a palace hall, water floating as fire was born, and furious winds sweeping through, revealing a man dressed in black!

The man's features were ordinary, with a touch of refined handsomeness. His eyes, however, burned with a brilliant light, pulsing with divine ability. An imposing, iron-colored black spear was strapped to his back. He clasped his fists and said:

"Greetings, Your Highness!"

This man was none other than Chengyun's Daoist Master Zhonggong—Zhong Qian!

Since the destruction of the Thunder Palace, the three thunder daos of the world had gradually faded into obscurity. Back then, when Li Qinghong cultivated a path of thunder, she couldn't even find a low-grade spell art. The divine abilities of the three thunders were even rarer, and the few that existed all belonged to the Left-Hand Path. This was the first time Li Jiangqian had ever seen a Primordial Lightning cultivator, and he carefully savored the experience:

'The lightning is gentle yet not fierce, constantly changing, possessing the miraculous ability to dispel metal and support earth—this is the Primordial Magnetism that Whole Pill cultivators fear most…'

The moment Li Jiangqian laid eyes on him, his heart jolted. A faint palpitation surged through him, and the Talisman Qi within his body trembled slightly in constant response.

Greedy Snare of Profound Li!

His strand of Talisman Qi had the effect of capturing insubstantial things and governing destinies, yet this was the first time it had given him such a persistent warning. It was almost blatantly telling him that the man before him possessed an incredibly weighty life-mandate and was no ordinary person.

Correspondingly, the man before him had just broken out of his cultivation and had not yet restrained his aura. His divine ability was newly consolidated and his aura was complete. It was clear his power was still overflowing; he had achieved his second divine ability!

'What a fine seedling for cultivating the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature…'

The Li Clan and Zhong Qian shared a bond of friendship. Zhong Qian had even assisted their elders within the grotto-heaven. After he achieved his breakthrough, the gifts the Li Clan bestowed upon him were particularly generous. Li Jiangqian offered nothing but praise:

"Senior, you are truly formidable!"

Zhong Qian naturally knew what he was referring to. His expression was very polite as he replied:

"Your Highness is of noble status, there is no need for such humility. You may treat me as a peer. Besides, my pursuit of this divine ability has cost me many years; how could I possibly compare to you? This second divine ability... has already cost me one immortal foundation."

Had he not said anything, it would have been one thing, but his words made Li Jiangqian regard him with even greater esteem.

'Such a blistering pace of cultivation.'

One had to understand that when Zhong Qian broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, the Great Song Dynasty had yet to be established. Not even twenty-eight years had passed since then. In that time, Zhong Qian had already perfected his first divine ability, failed once in his attempt to attain a second, and had now successfully formed and elevated another immortal foundation. All told, he had achieved his second divine ability in less than thirty years!

The Li family, with their Talisman Pills and Talisman Qi, didn't have a deep appreciation for this feat. Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing could both be described as unnaturally fast.

In reality, however, the time it took to polish a divine ability to perfection after first advancing to the Purple Mansion Realm was considerable. Sima Yuanli had made his breakthrough six or seven years before Zhong Qian and had used resources with absurd extravagance, consuming several spiritual items in a row to refine his pills, yet to this day he remained at a single divine ability…

'He is a true talent in his own right…'

Zhong Qian had certainly been forged by the Bright Yang phenomenon, but the number of talents it had produced was at least eighty, if not a hundred. Fortune and calamity were self-inflicted.

The Li family had encountered quite a few of them. The high-fliers, like Tu Longjian, had limitless prospects, but there were many who fell short. To say nothing of that certain Mr. Xu who died a violent death on the lake, causing the Xu and Liu families to vanish from their lofty positions forever.

And the Overlook Peak that Li Jiangqian had just passed—that Daoist Master Xianyao… was his fate not also a result of the Bright Yang?

He said with a serious expression:

"Fellow Daoist Zhong, you are truly remarkable."

Zhong Qian shook his head. His previous words had not been a subtle boast; he genuinely felt it was nothing extraordinary. He sighed.

"Among all the Daoist Masters of Moongaze Lake, which one is not more formidable than I?"

With that, he led him into a pavilion and smiled.

"May I ask why Your Highness has come today…?"

Li Jiangqian returned the smile and replied:

"I have come to trade for some spiritual resources."

He was, after all, an old acquaintance of the family, so there was no need for excessive ceremony. He took out a list and presented it to Zhong Qian. After the black-robed Daoist Master finished reading it, his expression remained neutral. He first asked:

"How many items is Your Highness still missing?"

Li Jiangqian was slightly taken aback, and then a realization dawned on him:

'I've misjudged him. This is the one who is truly wealthy!'

Thus, he stated seriously:

"I am still missing four… If Fellow Daoist can find them for my family, you will certainly be well-compensated!"

Zhong Qian smiled, his eyes crinkling with vitality. He poured some tea and replied:

"This Zhong also has a request. I should have sought out Your Highness sooner, but I am exacting in my cultivation. It felt wrong to proceed when my immortal foundation was just shy of perfection, so I have delayed until today."

Li Jiangqian accepted the tea and listened as Daoist Master Zhonggong continued:

"Helian Wujiang possessed a Myriad Malice Gold-Piercing Blade. It should still be in the hands of your esteemed clan, correct?"

Li Jiangqian understood immediately and smiled.

"That's right… It is a fine treasure."

The Helian family's most valuable possessions had been on Helian Wumeng. Of the three Spiritual Artifacts in Helian Wujiang's possession, the Myriad Malice Gold-Piercing Blade was the most valuable, and the only one worthy of being kept by the Li family for their own use. How could Li Jiangqian not know of it!

'Situ Huo was a step too slow. Now someone else is going to trade for it!'

Sure enough, Zhong Qian said earnestly:

"Your Highness may not be aware, but the divine ability I used to step into the Purple Mansion Realm is called the Baleful Lord's Rite. It was born from malice itself and is the most suitable Primordial Lightning divine ability for this breakthrough. Before the ability was fully formed, it contained not a shred of Primordial Magnetism, only roiling Demonic Malice. Though I have been thoroughly remade, I still retain the power to command malice."

"In this day and age, Primordial Lightning is difficult to find. A treasure that combines malice and metal like this is exceptionally suited for me."

Only then did Li Jiangqian nod. Zhong Qian continued:

"My second request…"

He stood up, his tone tinged with a hint of supplication.

"I hope… to borrow your esteemed clan's Profound-Name Dao-Malice Sword."

The Profound-Name Dao-Malice Sword he mentioned was indeed one of Helian Wujiang's relics. Li Jiangqian understood his intent, took a sip of tea to collect his thoughts, and said:

"Fellow Daoist, you may not know, but my family has already found someone to reforge that sword. If what you desire is the portion of Profound-Name Dao-Malice, you will have to wait for some time."

In fact, if he calculated the days, the Profound-Name Dao-Malice was nearly in their grasp. Li Jiangqian had even considered it when planning his formation. 

However, he had long heard of the item's immense value, and seeing someone appear so promptly to trade for it, he immediately grew cautious. He was unwilling to agree rashly without first clarifying its intended use.

But his excuse was perfectly natural, prompting Zhong Qian to nod and say:

"In that case, there is no rush."

The two steered the conversation back to the spiritual resources. Zhong Qian said seriously:

"Four types of spiritual resources are not enough for such a treasured blade. However, I heard of a certain matter some time ago, and I wonder if Your Highness might be interested."

"Oh?"

Li Jiangqian sipped his tea, watching as the other man spoke with a note of reminiscence.

"During the war between the North and South, the Supreme Yang lost its brilliance. Luoxia and Lake Xian suffered repeated, devastating defeats. Divine abilities were extinguished, and treasures were lost. A sword technique called the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword, and a mystic cord called the Eight-Ghost-Faced Frontier, both fell into the hands of northern cultivators…"

"Of those, the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword was obtained by the northern cultivator Zhu Kui. The Eight-Ghost-Faced Frontier was gifted by Qi Lanyan to Daoist Master Shangdong of the Han Family."

Zhong Qian paused for a moment before continuing:

"I have an old friend who is a disciple of Daoist Master Shangdong. He can trade for the Eight-Ghost-Faced Frontier on my behalf."

As soon as he said this, Li Jiangqian set down his cup and smiled.

"The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass?"

"Precisely!"

The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass had shone with spectacular brilliance during the battle at Lake Xian. His own father had made no secret of his admiration for it, and cultivators from both North and South had gained a new appreciation for this treasure disc. Though it had been famous since the time of the Ning State, it had always been regarded as a mere ceremonial artifact. 

To put it bluntly, the Li family was determined to acquire it!

Unfortunately, the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass was also one of the Great Xiukui Monastery's most prized treasures. Not only was it incredibly valuable, but giving up certain items made it difficult to face one's ancestors.

The two families had an excellent relationship, and while the Li family was keen to make a trade, they were privately wrestling with the dilemma. If the Li clan made the request, the Great Xiukui Monastery would likely agree, but the cost to their friendship and dignity was another matter entirely.

Zhong Qian had clearly come prepared. This Eight-Ghost-Faced Frontier was the very bargaining chip he intended to use with the Li family.

'Although this item isn't as valuable as the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, it is a relic of Daoist Master Kui Qi. Only this item could make the Lin clan feel that a small loss is acceptable! This move perfectly satisfies the demands of both personal sentiment and dignity!'

Li Jiangqian found this rather interesting.

'Changyun… so this was his doing. My ancestors once suspected he had ties to the Golden Feather Sect… Looking at it now, his diplomatic skill really does have the air of the Golden Feather about it!'

But a new problem immediately arose. Li Jiangqian paused briefly, then smiled.

"But surely the Eight-Ghost-Faced Frontier, the Myriad Malice Gold-Piercing Blade, and the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass cannot be compared to one another!"

Although the Eight-Ghost-Faced Frontier had been personally refined by Daoist Master Kui Qi, it was superior to the Myriad Malice Gold-Piercing Blade, perhaps even approaching his own family's Valley Water Lotus. Meanwhile, the efficacy of the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass in Li Zhouwei's hands was nearly that of a Spiritual Treasure, likely comparable to the Xiukui's ancestral heirloom, the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword!

If the Li clan wanted to trade with the Lin clan for the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, using the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword would be an exchange of equal value. For Zhong Qian to use the Eight-Ghost-Faced Frontier to trade for the Myriad Malice Gold-Piercing Blade, the Li family would actually have to add spiritual resources on top.

But Li Jiangqian's thoughts had already moved to a deeper level:

'The Xiukui also possess the Un-harming Stone, which I hear is a supreme treasure of the Whole Pill path. If I could obtain the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword and offer it with another generous gift, couldn't I procure a Spiritual Treasure for my sister?'

And so he asked:

"Why don't we inquire about the whereabouts of the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword?"

Zhong Qian's expression shifted slightly as he answered:

"It is in the hands of Daoist Master Zhu Kui. He… treasures it dearly… Unlike the Eight-Ghost-Faced Frontier, in the hands of certain cultivators, this sword's utility can truly rival that of a Spiritual Treasure. Once an item like that falls into someone's possession, it is almost impossible to trade for."

Li Jiangqian nodded to himself. His own family possessed many treasures, and they would never consider trading anything of the Spiritual Treasure grade unless it was damaged. He sighed with regret, sorted out the details in his mind, and said:

"The Xiukui and my Li clan are very close; my family will naturally not let this opportunity pass. I will hold onto the Myriad Malice Gold-Piercing Blade. Once you have obtained the Eight-Ghost-Faced Frontier, Fellow Daoist, we can discuss the details. I am not in a hurry to use the four spiritual resources… When the time comes, I will visit to inquire about the few I still lack. I must ask that you keep this in mind, Daoist Master."

Zhong Qian said:

"If I am in seclusion, I will leave the spiritual resources within the sect."

This was a clear sign of favoritism. Zhong Qian didn't even seem to care much about what he was trading for. Being able to help the Li clan was, to him, the forging of a friendship. This prompted Li Jiangqian to praise him:

"You are too kind, Fellow Daoist. This favor, Changli accepts!"

He hadn't forgotten that Cheng Qian was still collecting spiritual items for him. Since the formation's foundation was not yet complete, these seven items could wait. He didn't want to owe too many favors. But with Zhong Qian as a guarantee, it was now highly unlikely that he would fail to gather the remaining four.

With this matter settled, a great weight lifted from his heart. He praised inwardly:

'When your ancestors leave behind favors and help other families, getting things done is so much smoother!'

In this brief encounter, Li Jiangqian had already gotten a very good sense of this Daoist Master's character. After chatting for a short while longer, he raised his hand and asked:

"May I inquire about Senior Changyun…?"

Zhong Qian smiled.

"He has gone to visit a friend."

The response was vague, and Li Jiangqian didn't press the matter. He immediately rose from his seat and gave a deep bow. The gesture startled Zhong Qian, who quickly moved aside.

"What is the meaning of this?"

Li Jiangqian's eyes were heavy, his gaze intense as he said:

"There is one matter… for which I must ask for your aid, Fellow Daoist!"

Zhong Qian stared at him, dumbfounded. The eldest son of King Wei spoke in a low voice:

"My father is gravely injured and has been in seclusion for many years. He is afflicted by a severe ailment, and all manner of pills and resources have been but a drop in the ocean… Meanwhile, the military might of the Western Shu is at its peak, and I fear… they intend to move against the islands of the lake!"

A contemplative look appeared in Zhong Qian's eyes. He said:

"If the Western Shu marches, the Song court will surely respond!"

Li Jiangqian raised his head, his gaze boring into him as he replied:

"I only fear that Jianghuai, being on guard against the northern cultivators, will be unable to send aid."

Hearing this, a look of comprehension dawned on Zhong Qian's face. He asked:

"I heard that the Western Shu are making moves, intending to attack the state of Zhao. Turning back from that won't be a matter of a year or so; I'm afraid it will take three to five years…"

A trace of astonishment entered his eyes. He said:

"I had heard that your esteemed clan was visiting all quarters, seeking medicine for his injuries, but I never imagined that this Wu Earth calamity would be so troublesome… to think it could trap King Wei for a full three to five years!"

Grasping this point, the young man's expression changed distinctly. The lightning in his pupils flashed and leaped. He helped Li Jiangqian to his feet, pondered for a moment, and then said:

"If war breaks out in the west, and my Master is in the sect, I will certainly ask him to come. If he is not, then even if it is only me, this Zhong will come to the lake and lend his aid!"
