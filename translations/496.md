# Chapter 741: Returning To The Family

As soon as he said this, it truly startled Li Qinghong.

The Duruo Spear was the first Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact she had obtained, very handy in use. In all the years it had been in Li Qinghong’s hands, it had never been inferior to any weapon held by her enemies.

The spear had no name inscribed on it. When Li Tongya obtained it back in the day, he couldn't use it and didn’t know its name, so it was kept in storage until Li Qinghong formed a bond with it, at which point she learned it was called Duruo.

But this was the first time someone had called out the name of her dharma artifact.

Miao Quan who was in front of her, now wore a look of both hatred and shock. He didn’t make another move but instead hovered mid-air on a beam of white light and asked, "Are you from the Golden Feather Sect? Or the Azure Pond Sect?"

Li Qinghong withdrew her spear and stood calmly, replying softly, “Senior, you’re mistaken. I’m from neither.”

Miao Quan’s expression shifted several times before he ground his teeth and said, “Doesn’t matter whether you are or not, or whether you admit it. Once I capture you, I’ll find out everything by asking!”

He spoke in haste, unable to hold back a couple of coughs, which made Li Qinghong secretly pleased, Looks like that sudden Profound Thunder strike did affect him, he’s just forcing himself to hide it.

Now that Li Qinghong was in the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, she could condense three Profound Thunders in his Thunder Pool. Having only used one so far, she felt confident and wasn’t overly afraid.

Miao Quan once again summoned white lightning into his hands and gripped the axe handle with both hands, his eyes flashing white light. Li Qinghong also quietly activated her lightning arts, preparing for battle.

Just then, several soft cries echoed as a figure appeared between the two like a gentle breeze. It was a middle-aged man in a green robe, with a jade flute at his waist softly glowing.

He wore a Daoist crown and stood with his hands behind his back, coldly staring at Miao Quan. The shirtless, burly man’s lightning gradually dissipated, his face stiff and grim.

“Daoist Shen,” said Miao Quan.

Hearing this, Li Qinghong realized a senior from the Shen Family had arrived. She calmed the surging thunder in her Sea of Lightning. Shen Yanqing let out a breath of relief and said joyfully, “Father!”

But Shen Yanqing quickly came to her senses, pulled Li Qinghong along, and said softly, “Let’s quickly retreat, for fear that if a fight breaks out, Father will be hindered...”

Li Qinghong nodded, summoned her lightning, and slowly withdrew with her. She glanced back from a distance and saw Miao Quan still staring at her from afar.

His eyes were filled with white light, burning intensely, as if silently saying to Li Qinghong, “I will come for you...”

Li Qinghong felt a slight headache and followed Shen Yanqing across the sea. The girl oriented herself and said softly, “Sister Qinghong, we’re close to Green Pine Island. It’s safe there, let’s rest a while.”

Li Qinghong nodded, and the two flew together for a while. Soon, Green Pine Island came into view.

The island was now completely different from before. Large reefs and beaches had emerged, its territory expanded several times over. Faint traces of old structures could be seen on the rocks and sand, even a few toppled stone steles.

Shen Yanqing beside her seemed to be seeing it for the first time as well and exclaimed in awe, “I’ve heard that in ancient times, the Shallow Sea was a fertile land, and Green Pine Island was once Green Pine Peak... It’s just as they said!”

The two landed together at the Shen Family’s cave residence on the island and activated its protective barrier. Only then did Shen Yanqing step forward with a smile and say, “This time, it’s all thanks to your help, Sister!”

Li Qinghong modestly replied, “I was merely passing by... Even without me, he wouldn’t have been able to do anything to you... I only interfered unnecessarily.”

“You’re too modest, Sister.” Shen Yanqing shook her head and smiled as she said, “The Eastern Sea is known for Falling Water Rising Storms. Thunder cultivators from across the seas and inland all flock to the Eastern Sea... The Miao Family was originally a thunder cultivation family from the Southern Sea. Who would’ve thought this guy would end up all the way here?

“I too came to cultivate here because of the Falling Water Rising Storms of the Eastern Sea. I’ve been training on the island in recent years. When a major upheaval occurred, I returned by lightning and didn’t expect to run into him.”

Li Qinghong hesitated slightly and asked tactfully, “I was just thinking... for your esteemed family, a Purple Mansion Realm immortal family, traveling between the inland and the outer seas, surely you should have a reliable escort...”

Shen Yanqing lowered her gaze at once, a trace of concern appearing between her brows, and said softly, “Sister Qinghong, you may not know... The Yue Cultivating Sect has sealed its mountains and opened to the sea, leaving a vast territory behind. Devil and Buddhist cultivators are migrating south en masse, and my family, being under Yue Cultivating Sect’s domain, has taken quite a blow.

“With the island’s cultivators needing to hold their posts and the family’s cultivators unable to spare the strength to come... Our family’s master is likely entangled between The Merciful One and devil lords, unable to attend to all matters...”

She explained calmly, never bringing up the matter of the Profund Thunderstone again. Li Qinghong didn’t ask either, such things were beyond her reach. What concerned her more was the Duruo Spear.

Li Qinghong considered for a moment, then asked, “Fairy, do you know anything about the Duruo Spear Miao Quan mentioned?”

She had expected Shen Yanqing to know its origin, but after a moment of thought, she replied, “I’ve never heard of it... The name is unfamiliar. But judging by that Miao familyman’s reaction, there seems to be some connection.”

As the two conversed, radiant light once again flowed across the western sky. Several streaks of multicolored light swept by, and Li Qinghong observed them clearly and said softly, “Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliners.”

Shen Yanqing nodded and said, “Azure Pond, Golden Feather, the Buddhist sects and the devil factions, they’ve likely already begun fighting in Xu State. These Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliners are probably transporting conscripted cultivators...”

These words struck right at the heart of Li Qinghong’s worries, and she felt uneasy, If Azure Pond Sect is going to conscript cultivators, my family will surely be included. Several of our juniors... Xizhi is most likely still at Xia Mountain, Ximing absolutely cannot be sent to battle, and if Xijun returns home, it’ll all fall apart again... I may be the only one suited for this role.

Who knows how the Shen Family will handle things next... best to hurry home while they keep Miao Quan occupied.

The more Li Qinghong worried about her family, the less she could sit still. She spoke gently, “Since we’re now out of danger, I must hurry back home to check on things. I won’t stay here any longer, please give your father my regards...”

Shen Yanqing understood her concern for home. With her own father locked in a battle that might drag on, she nodded and said, “Then Sister Qinghong, please head back first... If there’s a chance in the future, I’ll visit to thank you properly.”

After a few polite exchanges, Li Qinghong left the Shen Family’s cave dwelling. She didn’t take to the skies right away but thought to herself, “Xizhi has gone to Xia Mountain, but Yuexiang is still on the mountain. Who knows how the people of Azure Pond Sect treat her. It’s better to bring her home.”

She immediately took the path to the other side. The Azure Pond Sect was not something the Shen Family could compare to, she had her own peak there. She simply gave her name, “Li Qinghong of Qingdu, please ask Yuexiang to come down.”

The Azure Pond Sect cultivator guarding the gate heard her surname was Li and responded with great respect. Before long, Li Yuexiang descended on a gust of wind. Upon seeing Li Qinghong alone at the foot of the mountain, her face instantly turned pale as she asked, “Aunt, my brother! Someone came looking for him the other day... They even said he abandoned his post without permission...”

Li Qinghong shook her head and spoke gently, “Your brother is fine. Pack your things, we’re heading home. I’ll explain everything on the way.”

Li Yuexiang nodded at once, and even gathered Li Xizhi’s belongings from the peak as well. Together, they headed west.
