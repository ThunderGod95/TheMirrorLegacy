# Chapter 1256: Lu Fu

Li Zhouwei had already calculated everything in his mind and was confident, but Yang Ruiyi frowned and said:

"In terms of strength, these people aren't considered powerful; they have no Great Daoist Master, the cultivators of the Profound Governance Pavilion are absent, and they lack the foundation to resist a common enemy. The only issue is on the other side… Touba Qiye is stationed outside Chengyun Gate at Duanchen Village, and we must be wary of him."

He simply said:

"King Wei… do you have a plan?"

Li Zhouwei looked at him and said thoughtfully:

"Grand General… how many men do you think we'll need to dispatch from Jianghuai to pin down the eastern reinforcements?"

When it came to intelligence, the Yang family, with their connections in the Underworld, was certainly far better informed than those on the lake. Yang Ruiyi hesitated only for a moment before saying:

"The State of Yan is the domain of the Compassion Dao; they have never liked Luoxia or submitted to the great families of Gu Prefecture, so if conflict arises here, it's ninety percent likely they'll sit on the mountain and watch the tigers fight… and Gao Fu, having already become a Great Daoist Master, hasn't been seen in years, so without an order from the Profound Governance Pavilion, they most likely cannot be mobilized either."

"But the most troublesome part is still the Lotus Temple…"

His brows furrowed as he said:

"The Lotus Temple has someone named Jinlian… he can be considered extremely resourceful. Although the Dharma Master backing him hasn't responded in many years, judging from the situation back then, he is definitely still around."

"Moreover, he himself is a master of both the Immortal and Buddhist paths with astonishing Daoist insight, having bested Immortal cultivators in discourse several times despite being a Buddhist cultivator. His disciples are each skilled in their own right, and if we threaten his home at the Lotus Temple and force him to intervene, the situation will inevitably take a sharp turn for the worse!"

This point was well-made. The situation in the eastern part of the Great Zhao was exceedingly complex; the State of Yan, the Gao family, the Lotus Temple, and even Gu Prefecture virtually ignored the Great Zhao's commands, each with their own interests and taboos. Any cultivator with divine abilities entering this region without a thorough understanding of each faction's schemes would very likely be ganged up on and forced out of the Zhao State...

Across the entire Great Song, besides Yang Ruiyi with his backing from the Underworld, likely no one else dared to touch this region where so many powerful factions vied for supremacy!

He said with a frown:

"If the Lotus Temple only sends a few people, I'm confident I can hold my ground and keep Touba Qiye and the others occupied. But if Jinlian comes in person, I can only defend a single location and let the Touba family pass..."

An idea gradually formed in Li Zhouwei's mind, and he said softly:

"I only ask the Grand General for three people."

"Oh?"

Yang Ruiyi's eyes narrowed slightly as he said:

"Please, King Wei, go on."

The young man rose and said in a low voice:

"First… Daoist Master Changyun."

Yang Ruiyi was not surprised by this. He gave Li Zhouwei a meaningful look and said:

"Daoist Master Changyun's divine abilities may be great, but he keeps his talents hidden and prioritizes self-preservation above all else. If you wish to use him, King Wei, it likely won't be easy… I was just thinking… that you would ask for old Daoist Master Chen."

Li Zhouwei's expression remained unchanged as he said:

"If the Grand General is willing to give him to me, then this king can make use of him."

In terms of dedication, Chen Yin was of course far superior to Changyun, but with armies at the gates of Luoxia, how could a great battle like this be handled by Chen Yin alone?

Yang Ruiyi shook his head with a smile and said:

"The eastern front is also strained; among our mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, he is likely the only one we can spare."

Li Zhouwei nodded and continued:

"Second, Daoist Master Cheng Qian."

To this day, Cheng Qian was still one of the Great Song's men; if Li Zhouwei didn't ask for him, he wouldn't be able to deploy him…

As for why he wanted this man, it was not that he could play a significant role on the battlefield, at best coordinating a little with Li Que'wan—what Li Zhouwei feared was that the Great Song's main force would battle the Lotus Temple, with the Compassion Dao waiting for an opportunity on the sidelines, and in the chaos, they would lose this divine ability cultivator from one of Guanlong's six great families!

At this name, Yang Ruiyi simply nodded. It seemed unexpected, yet reasonable, and he said softly:

"He has already reached the Wilderness; he can come over immediately."

Li Zhouwei continued:

"Third… I want Daoist Master Jingzhao."

From the Great Xiukui Monastery, Daoist Master Jingzhao, Lin Chensheng.

There was a definite reason for Li Zhouwei's choice. Although Lin Chensheng's cultivation was not high, he was at least of one mind with the Li family and possessed numerous treasures; though only at the initial stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, his usefulness far exceeded it!

Yang Ruiyi stood up abruptly, hesitating for a moment. Though he could understand the reasoning, he had his reservations and said with lowered eyes:

"King Wei… you must keep him safe."

The member of the Yang family looked very solemn as he said:

"The Lin Clan has no Holder of the Profound, and he is the only Daoist Master of theirs serving the court. If he were to fall at Luoxia, I would have a difficult time explaining it to His Majesty, and their family would have to be wronged once more."

Hearing this, Li Ximing couldn't help but frown.

"The Lin Clan… should also have a Holder of the Profound."

Yang Ruiyi looked slightly embarrassed and raised an eyebrow, saying:

"It's difficult to speak much on this matter. The Lin Clan was supposed to have ties to Wanling Heaven. Though they are now willing to enter the court and guard Jianghuai, their only talent, Lin Ya, has already inherited the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and cannot change paths to become a Holder of the Profound. The others are not particularly remarkable…"

He looked troubled, clearly this matter bothered him privately as well, and he said:

"There is one with the surname Fei who is quite capable, considered rather outstanding. I heard she has been in seclusion for a long time. Besides, she is not a Lin, after all—I need someone from the Lin Clan, not just a Xiukui cultivator. That point is very clear."

A glimmer appeared in Li Ximing's eyes as he said:

"Fei Qingya?"

Yang Ruiyi paused for a moment before saying:

"That is her name."

This stirred Li Ximing's memories. Back then, that woman had also been touched by the fortunes of the Bright Yang and was sent by the Li family to the Xiukui. Counting the days, it must have been her.

'Her chances of a breakthrough weren't low either. To think that by a twist of fate, I would see her on the verge of becoming a Daoist Master of the Xiukui!'

But Li Ximing no longer cared about it now. He felt he hadn't wronged her back then—the entire Fei family had been sent away completely unharmed.

'She shouldn't hold any resentment, lest it damage the relationship between my family and the Xiukui.'

The two sides had settled on a time, but Li Zhouwei was unwilling to wait any longer. He turned his hand over, producing a jade talisman, and said softly:

"I must ask the Grand General to take this talisman to Daoist Master Changyun and inform him that when it lights up, he is to advance up the Jianghuai and attack Ruzhou to the east."

'Ruzhou…'

Hearing that the target wasn't Xiangxiang, the southern gate to Luoxia, Yang Ruiyi felt a sense of awe. He understood that this King Wei must have other plans, and he nodded silently and said:

"When Daoist Master Changyun makes his move, I will attack Zhao!"

He transformed into a streak of dark light and departed. Only then did Li Zhouwei turn around and say in a low voice:

"Kuang Hong!"

"Your subordinate is here!"

The Daoist Master immediately stepped forward and bowed. Li Zhouwei said softly:

"Take my command token, gather the cultivators, and proceed to Tangdao Mountain. When my jade talisman lights up, leave the mountain immediately and head for Xiangxiang!"

Yin Juexi nodded solemnly and accepted the order at once. Only then did Li Zhouwei say:

"Que'wan, take the Spiritual Treasure and come with me. We'll go on ahead."

Li Ximing had been listening all this time and felt he had nothing to add. He just touched his sleeve, and an urn appeared in his palm as he said hesitantly:

"Since that Jiang Yan is a 'Returning Earth' cultivator, taking the Heavenly Nurture Urn should be of great use. And there's also this Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire…"

Li Zhouwei did not refuse. He accepted the Spiritual Treasure, then shook his head and laughed.

"I am not skilled with fire, so it's best I don't take the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire. Besides, the lake is not completely safe; with this fire for protection, Grand-Uncle, this junior can set out with more peace of mind! However…"

After all, if Li Ximing gave up the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire, he would lose nearly half of his direct offensive capabilities, and Great Radiance of White Brilliance required a rare opportunity to be used.

After saying this, a look of anticipation appeared in his eyes, and he smiled.

"One day, when this Imperial Observation of the Origin is complete, I will have to borrow your spiritual fire, Grand-Uncle."

As his voice fell, he swept up a heavenly light, and with Li Que'wan, leaped into the air and shot toward the horizon. As they crossed the glittering lake, Li Que'wan kept her hands clasped before her dantian, her eyes shut tight.

The moment before they left the lake's domain, she suddenly opened her eyes. The bright moon within her pupils sharpened into focus, and an invisible power of the Supreme Yin radiated out, enveloping them both in a dim, shadowy light.

The Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure, the Profound Bestowal Glazed Talisman!

Li Zhouwei stood quietly, his expression serene. As time passed, they gradually crossed over the lands of the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter, and before long, a majestic mountain came into view.

Tangdao Mountain.

The light in Li Zhouwei's eyes shifted slightly.

'Still not here…'

The Military Commissioner and Daoist Master, Situ Huo, had been missing for a full ten years.

'Yang Ruiyi still doesn't mention him. Without Situ Huo, it will be difficult for him to block the northerners, and yet he seems so confident…'

'Or could it be that the old fox has already secretly surpassed the Purple Mystery realm?'

The pair did not pause in the slightest. His golden pupils finally shifted away from the mountain as the terrain before them rapidly flattened out. They could see mountainsides covered in lush, crimson flora, with a few simple, large formations standing on the plain, flying the banners of the Great Zhao.

Years ago, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had fought a battle to the death here. The Hengzhu Immortal Dao attacked, and a crimson rain fell like blood. Though this place was protected, the ceaseless crimson rain lasted for months, in the end dyeing all the mountain's vegetation red.

Strolling as if in a courtyard, the two Daoist Masters crossed the border between the states of Zhao and Song with ease. A majestic city slowly rose from the horizon, and a dense spiritual qi washed over them, along with the faint sight of multicolored light glinting in the Great Void.

The southern gateway to Luoxia, Xiangxiang.

This was the advantage of the Purple Mansion Realm. They could walk through the Great Void, silent and traceless. The cost of a grand formation capable of detecting them was too high. Just as the Li Clan only established formations over the great desert and the lake island, the great families of Xiangxiang could only afford to establish one on the central immortal mountain. Now, under the power of the Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure, all manner of detection and warning measures were rendered useless, leaving the prefectures below the mountain exposed before the two of them as if completely undefended!

Standing within the heavenly light, Li Que'wan impassively observed the lands below. She could feel the abundant spiritual qi; immortal pavilions and terraces dotted the landscape, and though she couldn't see every cultivator coming and going, it was clear they all belonged to proper Daoist traditions. Out of ten, she could not find even two or three rogue cultivators.

"How prosperous!"

After she spoke, she suddenly tilted her head as if listening, and sure enough, she could faintly hear a voice echoing between heaven and earth:

"Geng represents the seizure of baleful energy and the revolution of slaughter, the transformation of form and sublimation into the bridge of transmutation…"

Surprise flashed in Li Que'wan's eyes. Li Zhouwei descended step by step through the air and chuckled.

"To think there's a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator giving a sermon here."

The great King Wei, a key figure capable of inciting a war between north and south, simply stood on a bustling street, casually walking toward the center of the prefecture. He soon saw a Jade Terrace that soared into the clouds. From top to bottom, it was packed with cultivators of all cultivation levels, each one listening with rapt attention and focused expressions. Not a single one dared to cause a disturbance.

At the very top of the Jade Terrace, a Daoist Master in traditional robes sat cross-legged.

This man had a long beard that flowed past his cap and wore a long gown that reached his ankles and simple cloth shoes. Though his face was that of a middle-aged man, it held a handsome and gentle quality, giving him the true appearance of an eminent cultivator from a monastery.

One hand formed a seal before his dantian, and with his eyes slightly closed, he spoke in a soft, low voice, seemingly at the peak of a torrent of inspiration:

"My Dao follows the path of the Tongxuan Immortal Palace. As a blood descendant of the two Lus and a disciple of the Azure Step, I have come to this understanding—Geng. To know damage is to know destruction; to know deficiency is to know loss; to know compliance with revolution is to know transmutation; to know what can be done and to act upon it. Thus, it is called 'World's Revolution'; thus, it is called 'Present Departs Old'."

A golden light flowed within his eyes, and his voice rose and fell with a powerful cadence as he proclaimed:

"The Commentary Before the Seat of Observing Momentum states: This is how Metal attains the Dao, and also how it loses the Dao."

After speaking, he paused for three breaths to observe the faces of the cultivators below. Finding them all with their heads bowed, none able to comprehend, a look of disappointment secretly crossed his face.

Yet, as these words drifted out into the sea of people surrounding the Jade Terrace, the woman raised an eyebrow and whispered:

"So he's a descendant of the two Lus. That must be Lu Fu."

Surprise appeared in the young man's eyes, but his attention was focused elsewhere as he smiled and said:

"A descendant of the two Lus, after all. These Daoist scriptures may not be world-shaking, but they are precious nonetheless. It would be difficult for anyone without a Metal Virtue divine ability to grasp such details… yet he speaks of them so casually… just to select disciples."

The Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure was truly formidable. The two of them were merely a few dozen yards from the Daoist Master, yet he remained completely unaware. Lu Fu stood up, stroking his beard with a smile as a speck of azure light appeared in his palm, and said:

"Who can explain this? There will be a reward!"

At these words, a stir went through the crowd on the terrace. Even Li Que'wan's expression changed as she said:

"A spiritual resource of the Purple Mansion Realm! These people are truly extravagant!"

Lu Fu stood up and said calmly:

"I know Luoxia has enjoyed three hundred years of peace, with countless resources and a constant stream of new talent, but surely not to the point of looking down on this Jade Dissolving Marrow."

But his question was simply too profound. Even though there was no shortage of scions from great families below, they could only look at one another helplessly. The Daoist took a gentle step forward, shook his head, and said:

"Do you cultivators know of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead?"

Li Que'wan shot him a strange glance and saw the young man before her raise an eyebrow with a smile. Below, someone answered:

"King Wei used it to defeat his enemies. Everyone under heaven knows of it."

This reply was somewhat unexpected for Li Que'wan—she hadn't realized that despite the tense relations between north and south, these northern cultivators still spoke of King Wei with such a tone, one far more respectful than that of the Buddhist cultivators.

Lu Fu also smiled and said:

"Correct. The Crimson Severing Arrowhead is the nexus of yin and yang, the auxiliary wing of revolution. With it, a king can command ten thousand chariots. Where metal is severed, there is slaughter. This divine ability possesses an aura of revolutionary slaughter, assists the 'World's Revolution', and is constrained by 'Present Departs Old'!"

"When the Northern Qi dynasty replaced the Wei, the crown prince of the old Wei was surrounded at the Tao River and was executed by the Qi general Xiangli Changshi's 'Present Departs Old'!"

His gaze swept across the cultivators. Below, someone had already stepped forward and said with considerable excitement:

"According to Master Lu's meaning, if a great cultivator were to use 'Present Departs Old' to guard Duanchen, they could single-handedly stifle the Wei's momentum!"

Lu Fu shook his head with a smile and said:

"That remains to be seen… It is a pity he was heavily injured and has not shown himself for many years. He may not even appear in the next great battle, so there is no opportunity for verification!"

Li Que'wan listened for a while, frowning to herself. She offered a silent prayer for the man before her, then glanced at the young man beside her, only to find that Li Zhouwei had already opened his hand. A spot of gold emerged from his palm, its light flowing up and down like water as a majestic, domineering, yet elegant long halberd slowly materialized.

This King Wei smiled and said:

"What he said isn't wrong."

Li Que'wan started, then shook her head with a laugh, listening to the deep, resonant voice of the King Wei beside her:

"Luoxia is a thousand leagues of fertile land, teeming with powerful cultivators and countless spiritual resources and items… In truth, I had another purpose for coming to Luoxia this time."

The King Wei looked thoughtfully toward the horizon, showing no anger at the offense. But golden qilin patterns had already begun to slowly emerge on his face as he said quietly:

"To plunder three hundred years of treasures from Luoxia's great families, to serve as the stepping stone for you and your brother's divine abilities."

His voice faded away dispassionately. The Supreme Yang light around him swiftly receded, and the entire city's brilliance dimmed in an instant, as if shrouded in an endless, impenetrable darkness.

Crimson Severing Arrowhead

The darkness enveloped the face of every person on the Jade Terrace, causing their figures to fade away. It crept up to Lu Fu's face, and in a single instant, he was left standing alone in a vast desert of blood and smoke.

"Fellow Daoist Lu."

Lu Fu raised his head in a daze, as if in a dream, and looked toward the far end of the endless darkness. He saw a bright, setting sun that crouched upon the ground like a colossal beast, and…

a white qilin in rustling, ink-black robes, standing in the light of the setting sun.

"It is not too late to verify it now."
