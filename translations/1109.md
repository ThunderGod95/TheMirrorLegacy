# Chapter 1109: The Outer Extreme

The purple water chimed softly.

Inside the great hall, purple light swirled in profound unity, casting myriad colors. Gongsun Bofan stood terrified outside the cave residence, not daring to lift his head. In all these years, he had never even approached the front door, let alone entered Yehui's abode.

The golden-eyed youth, however, paced casually. He swept his gaze around, coming to a stop beside a small purple pond, its surface as smooth as a mirror.

This was Deep Purple Spirit Water, a spiritual resource of the Capital Guard Dao. Low-level cultivators often mistook it for Purple Qi or Mansion Water. While precious, it wasn't particularly rare.

As the Daoist Master watched, the pond water rapidly boiled. Dark springs surged from deep underground, only to be vaporized into sheets of purple spiritual mist. Li Zhouwei stepped forward once more and gave a light stomp.

"Crack!"

It sounded as if something deep within the earth had collapsed. All the purple water instantly vanished, sinking away. A single point of green light leaped up, breaking through the air and riding the wind in an attempt to flee, but it was constrained by the Heavenly Light and forced to fall into the Daoist Master's hand.

The first thing that caught Li Zhouwei's eye was the talisman sealing it. It was a sheet of brilliant purple-gold, its runes flowing like liquid gold. Four large characters had been written upon it with a vermilion brush: "Capital immortals Great Dao."

He casually peeled the talisman off. It was as flexible as paper, draping limply over his hand. The light dissipated, revealing the object's true form.

The item was about the size of a palm, made of a strange, delightfully deep green material. Its edges were irregular yet possessed an unconventional beauty. It felt like a token in his grasp. Five profound runes adorned its surface: one golden dot in the center, with four round, silver-purple dots at its periphery.

The back was flat, inscribed with four golden characters: Sun-Honoring Grand View.

'It's... some kind of storage treasure.'

The item's material was exceptionally special, capable of storing spiritual items. It seemed some refining method had even been used to transform it into a spirit embryo. If he hadn't torn off the talisman, the karmic ripples and fate stirred by the sect's destruction outside would have continued to empower it.

His spiritual sense swept over it, and he paused, slightly startled. The space within was a field of light green, rippling water. It was crystal clear, with all manner of multicolored light shimmering within. It was clearly some kind of spiritual water, and submerged within it lay a single white jade slip.

Of all things, it was a pool of Wall-Sinking Water.

Li Zhouwei's expression became intriguing. He did not retrieve the slip, but instead cryptically put the green token away. He paced down from the dais and led Gongsun Bofan out of the hall.

The golden-eyed youth, dressed in white and purple robes and wearing a cloak of black cloud-silk, was already waiting outside. Seeing Li Zhouwei emerge, he quickly bowed and reported,

"Father, General Yang requests an audience!"

Li Zhouwei wasn't surprised. He nodded and stepped forward. Father and son stepped into the Great Void, drifting onward. Li Jianglong waited a moment before speaking in a low voice,

"Thank you, Father... for displaying such divine might. Your son and my two younger brothers... we are all endlessly grateful and overjoyed."

The Capital immortals were conquered. Jiangxia had been dispatched to sweep up the remaining forces in the territory, while Jiangliang was taking two Merciful Ones back to the capital. Only he had been ordered to receive Li Zhouwei. The matter he referred to was, of course, Vast Cicada.

He kept his gaze lowered. Li Zhouwei, his expression neutral, neither smiling nor angry, simply nodded.

"The Buddhist cultivators are full of schemes and are plotting against you. You must remain cautious."

Li Jianglong quickly swallowed the words he had been about to say and nodded obediently.

But the White Ye Immortal Sect was very close to the Wilderness. Just as he finished hearing that sentence, Li Jianglong realized they had already descended from the Great Void. He saw a great hall, glittering with an ominous light. The black-robed imperial descendant of the Yang clan was standing at the very entrance, personally waiting to greet them.

"Congratulations, King Wei."

"The same to you, Great General!"

Li Jianglong could only halt his steps once more, watching his father stride into the hall and disappear into the gloomy, bronze-fiend palace.

Yang Ruiyi's complexion was ruddy, and he looked extremely pleased. He warmly led Li Zhouwei forward. The King Wei of Great Song swept his gaze across the room and saw his uncle, Li Ximing, standing to one side with a smile. The tea on the nearby table was half-drunk; they had clearly been talking for some time.

Yang Ruiyi said,

"King Wei, that single strike of your battle-axe echoed from north to south. Its might shook Jianghuai. It was truly... unexpected!"

Li Ximing's eyebrows twitched. He caught the hidden meaning.

'For Yang Ruiyi to use the word "unexpected," it seems the Underworld was also unprepared! So... even the great figures in the heavens can be caught by surprise!'

His mood brightened instantly. He listened to Yang Ruiyi's lavish praise, and Li Zhouwei had only politely demurred twice before Yang Ruiyi smiled and continued,

"King Wei, your great accomplishment has already been reported to the Emperor. The Emperor is greatly pleased! In front of all the court officials, he personally lauded you, calling it an unprecedented achievement since the founding of the dynasty, the foremost merit in slaying an enemy general!"

"In a few days, an order should arrive summoning you to the capital for an imperial audience and to receive a generous bestowal of immortal items!"

At these words, both Daoist Masters of the Li family looked surprised. Li Ximing's expression shifted, revealing a trace of hesitation. The smile on Yang Ruiyi's face also wavered, and he watched Li Zhouwei's expression with hidden concern.

Li Zhouwei, however, smiled.

"The imperial grace is paramount. This king shall return to the lake, remove his armor, and purify himself with incense to prepare for the audience with His Majesty."

Hearing this, Yang Ruiyi seemed to let out a silent breath of relief, even showing a hint of gratitude. His voice softened considerably, and he dispensed with the pleasantries, saying hurriedly,

"Excellent... excellent. I will not disturb you further, King Wei..."

He watched the two Li family members bow and retreat. Yang Ruiyi let out a full breath, walked quickly back to the main seat, and irritably pushed his teacup away.

'The Emperor... what exactly is he thinking...?'

If the Vast Cicada affair was an accident, summoning Li Zhouwei was an accident beyond accidents. From Yang Ruiyi's perspective, at his level, the Yang clan had never intended for the Emperor and the King to meet.

Not because such a meeting was taboo... but because it was completely unnecessary!

'Those two are the greatest variables. One represents Bright Yang, the other True Qi. They are already impossibly difficult to control, and now they're meant to collide?'

'Every action they take is symbolic. If the Song Emperor makes an unexpected move, trying to suppress King Wei, wouldn't he be offending him for no reason? And that's the _good_ outcome. What if... what if by some million-to-one chance, the Emperor is instead outmaneuvered by the King? How humiliating would that be for the Underworld!'

But Yang Zhuo was not Emperor Zhao. When he gave a direct order for a summons, who would dare refuse?

This only deepened his anxiety, leaving him torn between joy and worry.

'And that's not even mentioning the Vast Cicada affair...'

The joy, of course, was that the north would be unable to stir up trouble for some time. He had wanted to break the stalemate, but he had never imagined Li Zhouwei would just cleave the man to death with a single blow!

Li Zhouwei slaying Vast Cicada was a majestic display, allowing the light of Martial Cultivation to shine brightly. The matter was a mixed blessing. The Song Emperor was overjoyed, but what about the Underworld? The powers in the Underworld despised anything that altered the status quo!

'Anyone managing the grand situation despises variables, even beneficial ones. One variable leads to a second. Who knows what will change next? Better to have no change at all!'

Of course, a man like Li Zhouwei was a variable in himself. The higher his cultivation, the more likely he was to upset the balance. But this all felt... premature.

He mused for a while longer before forcing the thoughts down, consoling himself.

'Fortunately, this isn't my problem to manage. At least, from the perspective of Yang Ruiyi, this is unequivocally a good thing.'

'What's more, the Emperor and King must meet eventually. Meeting now, before Li Zhouwei has surpassed the Purple Mystery, is for the best. If they were to wait until both were at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm, their divine ability complete... I fear the great lords themselves would have to descend personally to oversee it!'

The thought of that scene sent a shiver down his spine. He sighed deeply. This position truly felt like sitting on the edge of a blade. It was agonizing.

...

Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

Beams of Bright Yang light descended. Li Ximing straightened his robes and smiled.

"It seems the Underworld miscalculated."

Li Zhouwei took a step, hands clasped behind his back, and sat at the jade table. He poured the teapot full of clear tea and said,

"It's only the beginning."

"Besides..." He took a sip of tea. "I wouldn't call it a miscalculation. The only one who truly lost was the master of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. The Underworld was fanning the flames. Today's events, as well as Sparrow Carp Fish heading south to take a guest position in the lands of True Qi... that could not have happened without permission from a great figure in the Underworld."

Li Ximing fell into thought. Li Zhouwei, however, laughed. His face was naturally stern, and the rare expression swept away his usual ferocity.

"But this is also a good thing. A Dharma Master is still a figure on the level of a True Monarch. Regardless of whether he borrowed power from another faction, his defeat is real."

"This is a good omen." He paused, his expression growing bold. "If a Dharma Master can miscalculate, so can a True Monarch. For centuries, They have done nothing but exchange favors and conspire. What if the position I hold, the Golden Position I seek, is one that cannot be exchanged or conspired for? How would they break that stalemate? The figures high above are not omnipotent. That alone is enough."

Li Zhouwei's smile deepened.

"Uncle, why do you think the Song Emperor is so happy? Because I killed Vast Cicada? No!"

The words were like a sudden awakening. Li Ximing's heart filled with shock and terror.

He murmured, "So that's how it is!"

He pondered for a long time, still struggling to grasp Li Zhouwei's thoughts.

"The Song Emperor... if he just follows the proscribed path, he is guaranteed a position unattainable by anyone else in the world. Why would he do this?"

Li Zhouwei refilled his tea.

"He holds the Tianwu. How could he be willing to remain beneath others? As for the Underworld's schemes... if Granduncle could figure them out so easily, they wouldn't be the ones residing in the Underworld, observing the mortal realm."

Li Ximing nodded, then said hesitantly, "As for... the imperial audience."

Li Zhouwei smiled.

"Let him have his way. A momentary whim is harmless. The light and dark know their own. In the century-long struggle, it is not yet known who will become the Imperial Monarch."

His golden eyes were brilliant, the deep gold within them churning. Li Ximing was left speechless for a long moment before he let out a heavy sigh.

"Good!"

With the matter settled, Li Zhouwei hadn't even spoken again before Li Ximing was beaming. He hurriedly pulled a pile of items from his sleeve, first lifting a glittering golden pagoda.

"We've struck it rich!"

"I just made a trip to the Wilderness and specifically asked around. This pagoda of Vast Cicada's was forged from Radiant Sky Stone blended with the Chongming Golden Essence of Li Fire. It looks like a Buddhist cultivator's tool, but its true value is extraordinary!"

He quickly set it down and held up the long spear.

"And this Li Fire spear is just as impressive. The shaft used half a portion of Heavenly Li Crimson Gold, and the spearhead contains a sliver of Tianyang Radiant Copper. It's a minuscule amount, but it's there!"

Li Ximing said solemnly, "Back then, the Li Fire Spear used by the Imperial Monarch's reincarnation was forged from Tianyang Radiant Copper! This material is comparable to the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness."

Li Zhouwei merely watched with a smile.

"His equipment was better than mine."

The smile on Li Ximing's face widened.

"Yang Ruiyi also mentioned that Vast Cicada was a very strange man. The foundations of these items were never fully converted to the Buddhist way. He only built a framework, then used his own Immortal Dao Dao-Profundity to harmonize them with Buddhist cultivator techniques. If we spend some time breaking down the golden pagoda, we can recover eighty to ninety percent of the raw materials!"

"This spear's materials have already achieved profound unity. Smashing it won't help. It will take a good while to re-refine it properly."

Li Zhouwei was taken aback.

"That monk... why go through such convoluted trouble?"

Li Ximing sneered.

"Yang Ruiyi saw through him at a glance. He said the man was still thinking of returning to the demonic path, so of course he prepared an escape route!"

Li Zhouwei grew pensive. The glazed Valley Water lotus throne had shrunk to the size of his palm, and Li Ximing held it up.

"This is also a good item. It was modified from a Valley Water spiritual item. It's a pity the modifications run too deep. It was likely a gift from another Buddhist cultivator. The materials have already reached profound unity. Unless we find a true saint of artifact refinement, it will be nearly impossible to revert it."

Finally, he took out the kasaya and the white-skinned, gold-edged profound drum.

"These two are a slight step down, and you damaged them besides. Still, even among Buddhist cultivators, they'd be considered fine treasures!"

Li Zhouwei glanced over them and smiled.

"This shouldn't be difficult. The old Daoist Master of Mount Qusi is a grandmaster of artifact refinement. I'll have to trouble you, Uncle, to make a trip to Mount Qusi and discuss it. A solution will present itself."

Li Ximing nodded.

"My thoughts exactly. And it's not just the old Daoist Master. Daoist Master Liaoluo is also highly skilled in this path. If we cannot disturb the old master, we can seek him out instead."

Li Zhouwei's smile faded. He took a jade box from his sleeve, placed it on the table, and said,

"Uncle has shared his harvest. Coincidentally, this junior's own gains were not small."

He then recounted his trip to Mount Dali. As he spoke, Li Ximing looked as if he wanted to interrupt several times, and the smile slowly faded from his face.

After a long silence, Li Ximing finally said,

"Senior Liu may have allied with us for his own benefit, but who doesn't? We have generations of friendship and he has offered his help many times, not to mention his current duty guarding the Eastern Sea. None of that can be erased. He showed his true feelings; it did not seem faked."

"This junior understands."

Li Zhouwei gave him a moment before pushing the jade box forward.

"As for this... Qingyu Qian called it Final-Tower Sinking Primal, also known as Outer-Extreme Yin Qi."

"Final-Tower Sinking Primal?"

Li Ximing looked closer as Li Zhouwei continued, his expression complex.

"The Supreme Yin Moon Radiance is the pinnacle of yin. This item... is the yin _beyond_ that pinnacle. It is found in the place where the Supreme Yin falls and goes into seclusion. It is a thing of absolute yin. Because it is a manifestation of sinking, killing, ultimate yin, it cannot be absorbed. To swallow this qi means instant, violent death."

Li Ximing silently mulled over this. Li Zhouwei continued,

"However, if this item encounters both yin and yang qi, it manifests a symbol of the 'yin-extreme seeking change,' and transforms into another path entirely. Its applications in alchemy and artifact refinement are immense. In Qingyu Qian's words: 'Ancient cultivators would flock to it. To obtain even a sliver, one would spend a lifetime devising a formula for it, seeking to have their name passed down to be revered by all posterity!'"

Li Ximing's eyes lit up.

"What do you mean, 'transforms into another path'?"

Li Zhouwei still looked awed as he replied, "Qingyu Qian gave me the most famous example. There was once an ancient True Monarch known as Left Wall. Before attaining the Dao, he studied the Supreme Yin Dao Lineage, but he lacked the requisite divine ability. He retreated to pursue the Veiled Yin instead, but lacked a suitable weapon. As luck would have it, he obtained a portion of Final-Tower Sinking Primal."

"He sought out the era's most renowned grandmaster of artifact refinement, Sikong You. The moment that man saw the Final-Tower Sinking Primal, he knew his chance to be remembered for a hundred generations had come. He martyred himself for his craft and, for the True Monarch, he forged the Second-Aspect Great Bow Star."

"This artifact was said to be neither extreme nor veiled, neither full nor deficient. It existed in the space between Supreme Yin and Veiled Yin, yet could harness the aspects of both. Its unpredictable transformations stunned the world. Daoist Master Left Wall used it to ascend to the Veiled Yin position and achieve the rank of True Monarch!"

Li Ximing listened, gradually sinking into thought. Li Zhouwei sighed.

"It's said the Golden Position this True Monarch attained was exceptionally strange. He clearly ascended to the 'Veiled Yin' position, yet his place in the heavens was not far from the 'Supreme Yin' celestial domain. To repay Sikong You, He hung the Second-Aspect Great Bow Star in the sky as a small, trailing star, a testament for all the world to see."

"Ever since, the Second-Aspect Great Bow Star has been one of the stars worshipped by artisans. They often use it to divine the creation of their life's masterwork. Its importance cannot be overstated."

Li Ximing was silent for a long time, pondering the implications. At last, he said,

"I understand! It's such an incredible treasure! To use it properly... the requirements for one's craft, and even one's Dao-Profundity, must be astronomically high."

His expression was complicated as he eyed the small jade bottle in the box. 'Such a supreme treasure... and there are still four more bottles of it in the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance!'

They exchanged a look, both realizing the terrifying implication.

'With just one portion of this, one has a chance to strike for a Golden Position. How much immortal merit would that be worth?!'

'That great figure, the one suspected to be Li Jiangqun... had five full bottles. This is just the half-box that was left. Where did the other half he used go?'

They fell silent, simultaneously pushing the topic from their minds. They didn't even dare place the item in a storage bag, instead stowing it away carefully, preparing to send it back to the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. Only then did Li Zhouwei take out his second prize from the mountain, a brilliant golden, exceedingly heavy spiritual scroll, the Great Void Primal-Order Profound-Office Construction Method!

The scroll was immensely long, densely packed with golden characters. A single rune, when touched by spiritual sense, would blossom into ten thousand words of profound text. Li Ximing, a dignified master of the Purple Mansion Realm, found it dizzying to behold. He had to augment his senses with his Life Divine Ability just to read it clearly.

Li Zhouwei sighed.

"I've read the general outline. It is precious beyond measure. Accepting that Pure Qi spiritual item from Si Boxiu was the right move. This can solve a great trouble for us, but it only addresses one or two-tenths of the core problem."

Li Ximing solemnly put it away

"I know how precious this is. Just gathering the spiritual resources will take an unknown amount of time. This matter must wait for Que'Wan to emerge from her seclusion so we can discuss it together."

Their family's resources were considerable, but there was still a vast gap between them and the ability to construct a mystic realm in the Great Void. With two juniors on the verge of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, another massive expense was looming. Li Zhouwei didn't press the matter. Instead, he took the green jade token from the Capital immortals Dao from his sleeve and handed it to Li Ximing with a smile.

"Uncle, look at this. I found it in the Capital immortals Dao. It was hidden deep in the earth veins, being refined by the chaotic fortune stirred up by the sect's destruction."

They were in a secure location. Li Ximing flipped his hand, retrieving the jade slip from within the token. One glance at it made him start in surprise.

"Cloud Capital Dao-Entry Secret Manual? This is..."

Li Zhouwei shook his head, smiling.

"Read it carefully, Uncle."

Li Ximing spent some time reading it through. He was silent for a long while.

"It seems to be... a secret method for entering a grotto-heaven... but it's only half of it. It also relies on some 'profound token.' It's far too complex. This half-fragment is useless to us."

This made Li Zhouwei laugh.

"Yehui... he actually enjoys these little tricks. It seems he understands the current situation quite well... and has many of his own plans."

Li Ximing fell silent again, studying the token.

"What... what does this mean?"

Li Zhouwei smiled.

"Yehui's Dao-Profundity is high and his scheming is deep. Why would he risk leaving something behind in the mountain? And why would this item just so happen to be discoverable by my Dharma Body? I was suspicious from the start. But when I saw that pool of Wall-Sinking Water inside, I understood. This man... he left this for me, specifically. What was the 'catch'? The Wall-Sinking Water itself. It's a hint, and a demonstration of his foresight."

"He knew I would conquer the Capital immortals Sect! And he knew our family is desperately in need of Wall-Sinking Water!"

Li Ximing was quiet for a beat.

"This half of the Cloud Capital Dao-Entry Secret Manual... is his gesture of sincerity?"

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"Uncle, do you remember how he first rose to prominence?"

Li Ximing's eyes widened in realization.

"Encompassing Profoundity Mountain—Chuyi Heaven! This token in my hand... this is the 'profound token'?"

But his expression quickly clouded with doubt again.

"But... for Yehui to offer such a temptation... he must want something in return. What could our family possibly have that he would value so highly?"

Li Zhouwei shook his head, smiling.

"Our family has nothing he covets. But the grand alignment of North and South... that offers plenty to covet. Situ Huo is thinking of defecting to their side, so why wouldn't someone from their side think of defecting to ours? This man is proud. He would never submit to the Buddhists. Yet the Buddhist cultivators covet his power. How can he possibly rely on them?"

"The northern Seven Aspects have numerous Dharma Masters, and they already occupy the foundation of the Capital Guard's path: Radiant Qi. They would never let him covet the Capital Guard's authority. The Capital Guard path, with its Dushan Spirit-Summoning, often deals with ghosts and spirits. Wouldn't defecting to the Underworld be a perfect fit?"

Li Ximing was instantly, completely enlightened.

"So that's it... that's it! The sheer audacity of the man!"

The Daoist Master was still incredulous.

"I heard... I heard Wei Xuanyin treated him exceptionally well, entrusting him with great authority. And he... he just ignored all that friendship and plotted to betray him from the very beginning!"

"Friendship? How can that weigh more than a Golden Position?"

Li Zhouwei smiled.

"He wants to curry favor with the Underworld, not True Qi. To do that, he needed to force a major change in the situation. He's been planning this since the day he first joined the North. I always wondered... if he was going to join the North, why did he come save you, Uncle? Why did he come to our gates and say all that? His talk of 'mutual aid' was nonsense. He was signaling his ambition... signaling that he would _not_ submit to the Buddhists. It was all laying the groundwork for today."

"Yang Ruiyi is a defender, not an attacker; he won't lead the offensive for long. Situ Huo is unreliable and might sell him out. Only our family was on his radar early on. He knew we would inevitably end up on the southern side. Making this play in advance... it was the most secure move."

"Furthermore, we are a clan. We provide for our juniors. This grotto-heaven is perfect for elevating the next generation, and it even comes with the Wuguan Legacy. He knew we wouldn't be able to resist."

Li Zhouwei's eyes shone like stars.

"Of course, there is one more thing. He doesn't know if his defection is part of the calculations of the great powers on either side. Is Yang Ruiyi reliable? Is he willing to accept such a variable? But _I_ am a certainty. This King Wei will never pass up a chance to shatter the North, and I absolutely welcome variables."

"But you were right about one thing, Uncle." A note of admiration entered the voice of Great Song's King Wei. "This man's audacity, his ambition... they are truly rare in this era."
