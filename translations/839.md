# Chapter 839: Chaos Stirs

Although Li Zhouwei’s tone was calm and even, Wen Wu was no fool. How could he not sense the dissatisfaction when the man refused his tea, skipped the pleasantries, and opened with a comment about things not being ‘peaceful’?

This was no good-tempered master before him. Wen Wu had been stationed in the Eastern Sea years ago and had met Situ Mo, secretly considering him a formidable figure of their generation, a shoo-in for the Purple Mansion Realm. Yet, in the hands of the White Qilin standing before him, Situ Mo had been as helpless as a chick. How could Wen Wu not be terrified?

This wasn't just a matter of offending a peak Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator; this was clearly offending a future Purple Mansion Realm expert!

Ziqi Peak had made this mess, yet he, Wen Wu, was the one left to deal with it. As the intermediary, he did have some obligation to see to things. A bitter taste filled his mouth. Desperately searching for a solution, he began to speak, trying to stall for time.

“Ziqi Peak… it was once quite glorious. But after certain events, it fell on hard times. It holds little standing in the sect now, and they’ve grown accustomed to hardship. The peak itself is not very tranquil… ahem! My fellow disciples there are not the most steady individuals. It’s true that things aren’t always peaceful…”

He quickly tried to mend the situation. “However, training in the overseas territories is a sect assignment. Your clan’s Li Quexi is a junior disciple of my Mu Zuo Peak. She is currently in seclusion, breaking through to the next stage. In a few years, she too will need to come out and experience the Eastern Sea, lest she become too sheltered. Li Queyi can complete her two years first, and then she won't have to venture out anymore.”

He adjusted his robes, the movement causing the two Spiritual Talismans on his lap—one white, one gold, both glowing with a soft light—to settle on his thighs. Li Zhouwei glanced at the bowing Li Queyi and understood.

‘So Wen Wu’s Mu Zuo Peak took on a disciple specifically to foster good relations between the Li Clan and Purple Smoke. Ziqi Peak was never the priority. For Purple Smoke to devote resources to one direct descendant of the Li family is already giving us considerable face; any more would not benefit their future. And Queyi isn't the type to fight for it…’

‘Besides, if I were in Purple Smoke’s position, I’d also be more inclined to take a hands-off approach with a cultivator who values their family so much… It might not be intentional. With Quexi already there, and Queyi being so gentle and unassertive, it’s a convenient outcome for them.’

He lowered his hand and replied, “Queyi is the daughter of my eldest brother, Li Zhoufang, a direct descendant of our Yuandu branch. Senior Ling Yanzi is a good friend of our family and naturally looks out for her. But he is getting on in years, and it's normal for him to lose track of things sometimes. I am simply concerned that if these disciples of yours stir up trouble, it will harm the stability of Purple Smoke.”

Wen Wu shifted, embarrassed and uneasy. He knew the man before him was phrasing his words diplomatically only out of respect for Purple Smoke’s background. There was no avoiding this. “You are right,” he conceded. “The supervision of those peaks has been lax. The discipline has indeed gotten poor, and it needs to be corrected…”

Li Zhouwei chuckled and shook his head. “That would be difficult for you to manage, wouldn’t it, Daoist Wen? I am not familiar with the internal affairs of your peaks, but I doubt it has reached the point of needing a full-blown rectification. There’s no need to make a scene. Queyi doesn’t care for commotion; she is fine here in the overseas territories. Let things proceed as they should…”

Rectify the discipline? Li Zhouwei had no intention of making Li Queyi the target of everyone’s resentment. The girl had never mentioned this to the clan, precisely because she feared ruining the relationships within her peak. He wouldn't put her in such a difficult position.

“Besides,” he added casually, “Purple Smoke follows the Supreme Yang Dao. How could its culture be anything but righteous? Even the cultivators of Jiangnan wouldn’t dare to underestimate a blessed land like yours. My family’s Daoist Master also has a good relationship with Purple Smoke. Queyi being in the Eastern Sea is for the best. The Daoist Master is nearby and can look after things.”

At these words, a genuine sweat broke out on Wen Wu’s brow. He understood Li Zhouwei’s meaning perfectly.

‘*Today, it’s me, Li Zhouwei, who has come, and I’m willing to give you some leeway. But Daoist Master Zhaojing is also in the overseas territories. If, on a whim, he were to stumble upon this… wouldn’t you, Wen Wu, lose a layer of skin?*’

Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing, was known to be good-natured, but that was his attitude toward fellow Purple Mansion Realm masters. If Li Ximing had come today and personally witnessed a direct descendant of his clan doing menial qi-gathering work, and if Li Queyi had burst into tears and knelt before him, Wen Wu would have had to remove his own cap, bind his hands, and kneel before the master of Tinglan Seat!

But was today any better? Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes were fixed on him, and they held no shortage of frost.

Wen Wu no longer felt like he was riding a tiger; a chill was creeping into his heart. He immediately said, “This isn’t about the sect’s disciples. It was my negligence. I was busy with other matters, which led to you having to come and ask… It is truly…”

Li Zhouwei, still showing no sign of anger, replied, “You misunderstand, Daoist Wen. I simply came to see my junior, check on her, and browse the market…”

He waved a hand, leading Li Queyi out. The tea on the table remained untouched. Wen Wu hurried after them. “What about Queyi’s arrangements going forward…”

Li Zhouwei smiled. “A Daoist Master wishes to see her. She will remain here among the reefs. No need to transfer her.”

Wen Wu could only nod, escorting them down from the main hall. When Li Zhouwei politely declined his offer to accompany them further, Wen Wu could only turn back, his heart weary and bitter.

‘That bunch of idiots from Ziqi Peak…’ he cursed internally. ‘I just got assigned here, and they dropped this huge pot of blame right on my head! If it weren’t for the respect I owe to old Senior Ling Yanzi… I’d have given those bastards a sound thrashing!’

Still uneasy, he thought, ‘I must send a letter to my master… and inform the Daoist Master in advance… These powerful figures don’t listen to reason when it comes to family. When the time comes for blame, I won’t even have a chance to explain…’

*

As Wen Wu departed, Li Zhouwei led his junior into the market. He enveloped them both in a soft glow, separating them from the bustling crowd. Only then did he speak in a low voice.

“Queyi, you handled this matter incorrectly.”

Li Queyi, who had been on edge the entire time, bowed in apology. Before she could voice her regrets, Li Zhouwei stopped her with a gesture. The man in white and gold armor said, “You are a direct daughter of a Purple Mansion Realm Immortal Clan, yet you are far too gentle. Forget immortal sects, anywhere you go, if you are merely polite and kind, gentle without a hint of authority, people will always doubt you… You take one step back, and they will see you as a pushover. Then they will take a step forward, certain you won’t bare your fangs and bite. The most they expect is a reprimand, so they will kneel and beg. If begging doesn’t work, they’ll cry. As long as they see you might soften, the benefits they can squeeze from you are worth more than a little lost pride.”

Li Zhouwei casually surveyed the many spiritual items in the market. “You must carry yourself with an air of authority. You must learn to frown. These cultivators, once they have a status that makes you care about their feelings, will hope to suck a little blood from you. Even if they can’t, they’ll resort to petty tricks. Today, they claim an urgent matter and have you help gather qi. Tomorrow, they can go into seclusion, and when you come looking for them, they’ll be nowhere to be found.”

Li Queyi knew he was talking about her senior sister on the island. She nodded silently and murmured, “We are all from the same sect. Some of them knelt and wept while they begged… They said they had families, old and young, depending on them to make a breakthrough. I just wanted to help where I could, to soothe my own conscience.”

Li Zhouwei glanced at her. He knew that while she was intelligent, her nature was fundamentally gentle, making her easy to read. She lacked any sense of superiority. “Don’t think that by giving them some spiritual items, these senior brothers and sisters will remember your kindness. And don’t mistake them for being important. Maybe they’re just acting shamelessly, maybe they have grand ambitions… so what? What does that have to do with you? Why should you have to use your resources to support them?”

He took a silk pouch from his sleeve, one containing the wealth he had taken from Situ Mo’s body and exchanged for resources suitable for her cultivation level. He tossed it into her hands.

“Today, I was able to stand up for you, but that is only because our families have a relationship. Purple Smoke has an obligation to guide you, and they certainly shouldn’t stand by and watch you suffer. But once you leave this blessed land, once you are far from Moongaze Lake, no one will be watching over you every moment. If you are harmed somewhere, the most the clan can do is avenge you after the fact.”

“These resources are enough for you. Cultivate well. Your own strength is all that is real.”

Li Queyi nodded and replied respectfully, “I will remember your teachings, my lord.”

This was all Li Zhouwei could say. In Li Queyi’s generation, most of the Li family had been born into privilege and had grown up without vicious struggles. Such a disposition was inevitable.

‘It’s not a bad trait,’ he thought, ‘just ill-suited for the times.’

He finished his business in the market, having exchanged most of the goods he’d plundered. Soon, Wen Wu returned with others to invite him back. Li Zhouwei sent his junior away and suddenly asked, “Daoist Wen, you mentioned before that Ziqi Peak was once glorious… How did it fall to its current state?”

Wen Wu’s expression immediately turned awkward, as if the topic were difficult to broach. But after the earlier unpleasantness, he was here now to smooth things over. Hiding the truth would only seem insincere. He had no choice but to explain in a low voice.

“Daoist Li… Ziqi Peak once had a master who committed a dishonorable act. He later died… and his lineage declined. Senior Ling Yanzi knows why, so he never complains about the sect’s favoritism. Many in the sect are aware of the story…”

Li Zhouwei nodded thoughtfully, clearly waiting for more. Wen Wu shook his head, looking pained. He dismissed the people around them and whispered, “This… this master’s Daoist name was Ting Qian. He once instigated an internal rebellion and was later suppressed and slain by Ling Shu… The details of the incident were contained within the blessed land, so the other major families don’t know much about it, only that a period of turmoil occurred… Ziqi Peak is his legacy. And Senior Ling Yanzi… is not only his martial grand-disciple but also his great-grandson.”

Li Zhouwei frowned. He sighed inwardly and said, “Senior Ling Yanzi has no heirs and recruits almost exclusively rogue cultivators. Surely the resentment from that rebellion ends with him?”

Wen Wu nodded repeatedly, hinting, “That was the sect’s intention in having Queyi join him. After all, his other disciples were raised by him from a young age, but their talent is limited, and none are suitable to inherit his position. Queyi can step in perfectly, and while she’s at it, give the peak a new name. Then the matter will be considered closed.”

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod. ‘This Ziqi Peak is certainly interesting…’ he mused.

Wen Wu was unwilling to say more. Li Zhouwei exchanged a few more pleasantries, then rose into the air on a beam of light and departed from the market, heading for the sect’s spiritual spring to cultivate his secret arts in seclusion.

He had perfected his Imperial Command. Along the way, he had also progressed with his Great Fissure, bringing it to sixty percent completion, while his Myriad Arms Prefecture was at thirty percent. He estimated it would take him two or three years to master both.

As for his other secret arts, they would not progress as quickly, though he figured Primal Yang wouldn’t take too long. All in all, Li Zhouwei calculated that mastering four secret arts would take him at least three or four years.

“Four secret arts, and it only increases my chances by twenty percent. Time is tight.”

Not only was time a concern, but Li Zhouwei also had no Radiant Sky Stone to use. Though he was hailed as a future Purple Mansion Realm expert, cultivation was a personal journey. The more secret arts he could master, the better.

‘I fear the family may not be able to cope. I must also consider breaking through sooner.’

The Southern Sea, Shitang North Dan.

After Daoist Master Yuanxiu, Si Boxiu, failed his breakthrough here, the skies over Shitang had remained overcast for three days. The winds grew chaotic, blowing north one moment and south the next. Erratic gales swept across the regions, rising and falling without warning. At times, the winds were so strong that even low-level cultivators couldn’t control their flight, let alone the mortal fishermen at sea.

Muffled thunder rumbled intermittently within the clouds, entirely different from the downpours and rising thunder of the Eastern Sea years ago. Not a single drop of rain fell, leaving the entire sea region oppressively hot and humid, a place that made all who approached turn back.

The Ginseng-Timber Wood on the various islands ceased to sprout. Their leaves fell, leaving them bare, their hard bark exposed and dripping with condensation.

Amidst the raging winds in the clouds, a point of rainbow light hovered in the air. The figure within stared into the distance at the water vapor that was thick enough to condense, sighing deeply. He was trapped before an array, unable to leave.

In these recent days, cultivators found themselves with an abundance of spiritual resources, but life for the common people had become difficult. The damp heat seeped into their bodies, causing countless deaths.

Li Xizhi had been working on this problem for a long time. He had dispatched all the cultivators under his command, but their eyes were all fixed on the newly emerged spiritual items, their minds elsewhere.

Worse, with Yuanxiu’s death, Li Xizhi had lost his protector and now had to be constantly on guard. Although the Purple Mansion Realm masters of Thunder-Hearing Island might hesitate to act against him personally out of fear of Li Ximing, he could not afford to let his guard down.

Azure Pond finally had Ning Wan, another Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, but she was tied up with matters in Jiangbei. She couldn't possibly remain in the Southern Sea. She had only sent a letter, telling him not to leave the island.

Li Xizhi could only gaze out at the ocean and sigh, knowing in his heart that all his years of effort to save Shitang had been undone by the death of Daoist Master Yuanxiu.

‘Dantai Jin also came to North Dan, likely to witness Yuanxiu’s breakthrough. He was deeply grieved but will soon return to the Azure Pond mountains. Based on the messages he’s sent me these past few days, he intends to recall me…’

With the Azure Pond Sect having suffered several heavy blows, Li Xizhi was now one of its few remaining prominent figures. The recall was not unexpected. He could have ignored the world outside his island, but he wanted to save whom he could before he left, and the thought exhausted him.

“Grandfather!”

As Li Xizhi was lost in thought, a youth in black robes approached and bowed respectfully. Just as he was about to speak, Li Wushao rushed over from the side, followed by a horrified Quan Yuduan. Before either could say a word, Li Xizhi looked up, his expression turning grave.

Golden light pierced through the layers of clouds overhead. One by one, bare-armed Master Monks appeared, standing in the air with palms pressed together and pious expressions. Seated in their center was a golden effigy as large as a mountain!

“The Merciful One?!”

The entirety of Shitang North Dan had been surrounded by Buddhist cultivators. Dozens of Master Monks stood faintly visible among the clouds, while an incalculable number of monks stood upon the sea below, supported by some unknown artifacts. A serene, solemn atmosphere descended upon the entire area.

Quan Yuduan gritted his teeth, staring at the golden light above. “Master!” he said in a low voice. “It’s the monks from the Great Konghai Temple on Songzhou to the south! They have entered the sea!”
