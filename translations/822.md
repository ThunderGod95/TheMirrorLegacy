# Chapter 822: Preserving Truth Through Martial Might

Li Zhouwei pondered this deeply before replying, "The cultivation manual you acquired, my lady, spans a hundred years of history. It began in the sea and later moved to the lakes. Everything was meticulously arranged. Dragons cannot walk the land, and Mount Luoxia cannot control the seas. If some divine ability connects these events, who could possibly wield such immense power... Perhaps, my lady, you truly bear the weight of Fate."

Though Li Zhouwei seemed merely to be expressing his awe of Li Qinghong, his words landed differently on his two listeners.

'Who could possibly wield such immense power?'

Both held the answer in their hearts, yet they dared not speak it, dared not even truly think it. Since the suspicion had been planted, they could only cling to the explanation of Fate, refusing to broach the other possibility.

Li Qinghong immediately softened her voice. "This matter... must be traced back to the Conflict of North and South. In those years, the Grotto-Heavens of the True Qi path opened wide. Publicly, it was said the True Monarchs had traveled beyond the heavens, leaving the various Purple Mansion Realm masters to their own devices. In truth, the Golden Feather Sect took the lead, acting on a Celestial Decree from True Monarch Taiyuan, to probe the status of the True Qi path’s Fruition Attainment."

"When the Grotto-Heavens opened, three portions of the Martial True Qi Malignance Essence emerged. It was rumored that all three belonged to True Monarch Tianwu himself... and thus, everyone understood... True Monarch Tianwu was in peril."

Li Qinghong retrieved some tea leaves from a white porcelain jar nearby, shaking a measure into the pot. Her slender hand and the Jade vessel complemented each other perfectly.

Li Zhouwei asked skeptically, "They could confirm the status of a True Monarch based solely on three portions of Metallic Essence?"

Li Qinghong lowered her voice. "In the years Anhuai Heaven was established, True Monarch Tianwu’s authority shook the region, and all Demons and fiends retreated before him. He brought out three suits of armor and placed one in each of the three major territories of Anhuai Heaven. He left behind a single sentence, and then he departed beyond the heavens."

"That sentence was..." Her expression turned reverent. "‘When the armor lives, the Malignance stands. When the armor dies, the Martial Truth Qi hangs vacant. I invite later generations to ascend.’"

"In the decade that followed, those three suits of armor sequentially grew skin and flesh, becoming two men and one woman. Their faces, features, and voices were indistinguishable from living people, and all three attained great divine abilities. They guarded Anhuai Heaven until the day it was sealed and the Kingdom of Ning was destroyed. After that, they vanished without a trace."

"During the Conflict of North and South, the Purple Mansion Realm masters stormed into Anhuai Heaven, only to find it utterly deserted. The armor was gone. All that remained were those three portions of the 『Martial Truth Qi Malignance Essence』."

She shook her head. "This ended up fattening Jiangbei. One portion was obtained by Mount Changhuai in the Kingdom of Wu. Purple Smoke acquired another. The final portion, however, escaped and vanished due to the negligence of Daoist Master Chengyan. As a direct result of that failure, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Southern Sea perished."

"All three portions are critically important. The general cultivators... well, the Purple Mansion masters aside, *especially* the Golden Feather Sect, which gained nothing... they are intensely dissatisfied with him. Even Mount Changhuai and the Dragon-kin, who *did* obtain the True Qi, show him no courtesy whatsoever. Those with shorter tempers... like Hengli of Hengzhu, or Ping Yan of Yinzhou Island... they practically scream for his blood."

Li Zhouwei shook his head repeatedly. "No wonder it is said Daoist Master Chengyan cannot travel freely, nor dares he leave the known Seas. So this is the reason."

Li Qinghong continued, "That escaped Metallic Essence also became a Demon-fiend. That thing is ferocious. Because it was left behind by True Monarch Tianwu, it retains a sliver of the True Monarch's essential status. With the Fruition Attainment currently unoccupied, it is even more terrifying. Even Purple Mansion Realm masters must give it a wide berth... And worse, it was transformed from one of those three suits of armor, so its intelligence and cunning are certainly not inferior to any man. Right now, it’s hidden who-knows-where and absolutely refuses to emerge."

Li Zhouwei let out a long breath. "To think even a single suit of armor possesses such might. To achieve Fruition Attainment as True Monarch Tianwu did... leaving his armor to watch over the world while he sought higher truths... one could face death without regret."

Li Qinghong nodded slightly, clearly holding this True Monarch Tianwu in high regard. "He was a genius of the near-ancient era, and a magnanimous figure. It is said that when his own younger sister perished, her name appeared on the registry of the Underworld. Honored as a True Monarch, he easily could have used his divine abilities to detain her soul, yet he respected the order of the Underworld and refused to interfere for personal reasons. Later, he personally traveled to the Underworld to negotiate her return."

Li Zhouwei sorted through the information, but a doubt suddenly arose. "True Monarch Taiyuan holds an illustrious position in the current era and is highly active. Cultivators from the Golden Feather Sect can even enter the Grotto-Heavens to train. Since Golden Feather gained nothing, and that Metallic Essence has twisted into a Demon-fiend, why doesn't the True Monarch personally intervene and recapture it?"

Li Qinghong had clearly pondered this long ago. After all, True Monarchs still exist both within and beyond the seas. There was no reason they would allow something coveted even by Golden Core cultivators to roam free as a Demon-fiend.

"I already asked about that," she replied. "It concerns the Underworld. Once the Metallic Essence transformed into a Demon-fiend, the Underworld gained sole jurisdiction over its capture. If the Underworld does not dispatch agents to retrieve it, not even a True Monarch has the authority to interfere... This falls squarely within their jurisdiction. If True Monarch Taiyuan *were* to intervene, it would be an act of profound disrespect."

She frowned, her willow-leaf brows knitting as she searched for the words to describe the severity. She offered an analogy: "It would be like traveling to Mount Luoxia, standing at its base, and intercepting the forty-eight rays of twilight that fly across the firmament, stopping them from returning to the summit... and then stealing one or two of those rays for yourself."

"Ah..."

Li Zhouwei understood immediately. Both Mount Luoxia and the Underworld were entities in a league of their own. Mount Luoxia was more visible in the mortal world and thus inspired greater awe, but the Underworld, which held sway over all the fiends of the world, was no less tyrannical.

Just as Li Qinghong finished speaking, the water in the pot boiled, and the Jade lid rattled softly. She poured Li Zhouwei a cup, revealing a tea that was surprisingly pale purple. "This is a tea plant someone gifted me, Winter's Echo. I planted it here in the Lie Sea. This is the year's first harvest."

Li Zhouwei offered his thanks. He first inspected the cup. The veins of the tea leaves shimmered gold and silver, while the leaves themselves were snow-white. He took a delicate sip, only to feel an intense numbness spread from the tip of his tongue all the way down to his stomach. An instant later, a dense wave of spiritual energy surged upward, sweeping his fatigue away entirely.

The taste, however, was purely and solely *numb*. It was, frankly, not pleasant. Li Zhouwei swallowed and replied, "Excellent!"

Li Qinghong, however, was quite enthusiastic. "This is the very first thing I've ever grown myself. Although my sense of taste is vastly different from a mortal's now, I can hazard a guess at the flavor... It should be quite good."

"Mm, yes, absolutely."

When the tea was first poured, it was just ordinary spiritual tea water. But this Thunder Pool was an exceptionally mystical place. The ambient power of thunder in the world was drawn by the tea water and rapidly converged. Li Zhouwei felt a distinct tingling at his Baihui acupoint on the crown of his head. It felt as if lightning was about to descend from the heavens.

'I cannot hold this cup...'

Li Qinghong, naturally, was fine; no lightning in heaven or earth would strike her. Li Zhouwei, however, calmly but quickly set his teacup down. Seeing Li Qinghong purse her lips in a smile, he shook his head, slightly embarrassed.

Her pale purple, almond-shaped eyes blinked. Her crimson lips parted in a smile. "If it tastes bad, just say it tastes bad. You cannot tell a lie in this place. When the ancients swore oaths to the heavens, retribution always came as lightning. Lies are forbidden in the Thunder Pool. You are only safe because Fate shields you. If anyone else had sat here and said that, the lightning would have already struck."

"If you insist on praising it, I'll end up serving it to other guests, getting them all numb, and then they, too, will be forced to say how 'excellent' it is..."

Li Qinghong couldn't help but laugh. She refilled his cup. "If Xizhi were visiting, I’m sure he would also praise it. When the lightning struck... Xizhi could probably endure it. But poor Wushao’s tiny frame certainly can't take a bolt of thunder. Although I would be here to prevent him from being turned to ash, he would, at the very least, become a roasted snake."

Li Zhouwei nodded awkwardly. Seeing Li Qinghong adding still more tea to his cup, his tongue began to tingle preemptively. Unsure if he was expected to drink it, he quickly changed the subject. "Grand-Ancestor, have you heard any news of the Daoist Master?"

Li Qinghong finally set the Jade pot down. "That day he was pursued all the way here, giving me a justifiable reason to intervene. I intercepted Changxiao. Changxiao is extremely cunning. The instant he saw me, he feared offending the Dragons, and his attacks immediately became hesitant and restrained. If I had tried to circle around him, Ximing would have vanished."

"We did not fight for long. He possessed little true will to battle from the start. The longer we clashed, the more he sensed things were amiss, and he fled in a single breath. He is now hidden in some unknown corner observing the situation. He remains a significant threat."

Li Qinghong’s expression turned serious. "He already considers our family a mortal enemy. This is now a blood feud that ends only in death. While he may not dare to harm you directly, he will have zero scruples about harming Ximing..."

"As for Ximing... he was struck by a Mirrored-Mirage Dharma Art. I was quite worried at first, but who knew that only a few years later, he’d be alive and kicking again? He already sent a letter home, and he has even managed to connect with the Dantai Family!"

Li Zhouwei breathed a sigh of relief. He thought for a moment, then said, "I do have one matter that I must trouble you with, my lady."

He retrieved a Jade box from his sleeve and placed it on the table. "I successfully ambushed Situ Mo, and during that time, I also seized a Dharma tool from a disciple of Changxiao Gate. It follows the Water Mansion path and is of excellent quality. I have studied it and sought advice for some time, only to discover an imprint left by the Changxiao Gate deep inside it. The technique used is advanced, allowing any Changxiao disciple within a certain radius to detect it..."

"This specific Water Mansion Dharma tool is somewhat well-known, and I fear being discovered if I carry it. While I myself may be fine, I cannot pass it on to the younger disciples of the clan, and attempting to trade it significantly diminishes its value. I currently have my eye on another Dharma tool, but this issue has delayed the transaction."

He looked up, his hand hovering over his teacup before pulling back again. "If my lady happens to have a suitable Dharma tool here to exchange, it would be the most convenient solution."

Li Qinghong glanced at the box. "Let me take a look. It will save you the trouble of running around. Since you already have your eye on something else, neutralizing the danger from this item is the best course."

She smiled, her tone shifting. "Of course, this place was also established quite hastily. It’s not as if I have a stock of Dharma tools lying around to trade you."

Li Zhouwei nodded and opened the Jade box. Inside sat a small, glimmering azure gourd. It radiated a brilliant, precious light, yet it seemed suppressed by the ambient Profound Thunder in the sky, causing it to appear somewhat dim.

Li Qinghong extended her slender hand. Pulled by a primal magnetic force, the gourd immediately flew into her grasp. She scanned it for two beats.

*Boom!*

A bolt of Firmament Thunders descended from the sky, striking the gourd with a deafening crash. Purple lightning washed over the artifact, and a thick plume of pitch-black smoke erupted from within it, only to be instantly annihilated and dispersed by the dense lightning of the mystic realm.

The small azure gourd immediately looked brand new, even the original owner's imprint scrubbed clean. Li Qinghong nodded. "This item truly is rather mystical. It must be an antique. It appears they were originally attempting to refine it into an extremely high-grade Pristine Water Dharma tool. But somewhere mid-process—perhaps they ran out of materials, or perhaps some accident occurred—it was converted into a Water Mansion tool."

She paused briefly, then called softly, "Yuanzi!"

The same white-robed female attendant who had guided him inside entered the pavilion, kneeling firmly on the floor. She accepted the gourd from Li Qinghong with both hands.

Li Qinghong instructed, "Take this Dharma tool down to the Lustrous-Head clan on the seabed. Instruct them to alter the artifact. Ask if they can change its color and external appearance while increasing its power, or at least not diminishing it. Then, return to the Thunder Pool with their answer."

"Zhouwei... do you have any specific requirements?"

Yuanzi nodded respectfully, holding the Dharma tool as she stood aside. Only now did Li Zhouwei truly feel the authoritative atmosphere of a domain belonging to the Dragon-kin. He quickly replied, "Not many requirements! Just ensure the final item does not clash with Supreme Yin or Pit Water!"

Li Qinghong shook her head with a smile. "The Lie Sea was originally just an insignificant part of the outer ocean. It had no reputation; it was merely considered a vassal territory of Crimson Reef Island. Crimson Reef Island only ever sent their subordinates here to exploit the populace. The local Demon beasts and cultivators led bitter lives."

"After this Thunder Pool was established, they all submitted to my authority. With that parasitic middle layer of exploitation removed—and since I demand very little of them—they are all immensely grateful. Just send the Dharma tool over. I guarantee they will re-forge it to your complete satisfaction."

Li Zhouwei offered a genuine smile and nodded. "Oh, there’s no need to go to *that* much trouble. Ultimately, it’s destined to be traded away. If they spend too much effort on it, I won’t be able to bear parting with it."

Only then did Li Qinghong turn her head. "No need for extravagance. Just follow the young master's wishes."

"Yes!"

Yuanzi bowed and exited with the Dharma tool.

Li Zhouwei then returned to their topic. "Based on your earlier words, the Metallic Essence portions are currently held by Mount Changhuai and Daoist Master Zipei. But Daoist Master Zipei has already reincarnated..."

He hesitated at this point, showing his confusion.

Li Qinghong interrupted him. "Daoist Master Zipei of the Purple Smoke Gate acquired a portion of the True Qi, but she did not use it for her reincarnation. In the end, she gave it to the Dragon-kin. Purple Qi and True Qi are conceptually very close, yet she refused it... According to the Dragon-kin, there were two reasons. First, she was aiming to assail the Purple Qi Fruition Attainment and refused to leave herself any mental fallback, fearing it would compromise her ascent. Second, she *had* to give it up. Even if she had taken it into reincarnation, she would not have achieved her desire. Any ordinary Metallic Essence would be one thing, but *that* particular portion... it would have compelled a Dragon Monarch to intervene personally! It might even have unleashed boundless karmic slaughter."

Li Zhouwei nodded in understanding. Li Qinghong’s expression, however, grew uneasy. "However, according to the Dragon-kin, that exchange Zipei made seems to have been what perfected my Thunder Body. If not for her contribution, it is highly likely that nothing at all would have remained of me after swallowing the thunder. They... they hope that if I encounter cultivators from the Purple Smoke Gate in the future, I will look after them..."

"If our family has the opportunity, we must try our best to foster good relations with that sect... At the very least, we must avoid any conflict. It doesn't just put me in an awkward position; I also fear that those with ill intentions might exploit the situation."

Her words took Li Zhouwei by surprise. His expression turned solemn. "I will immediately find an opportunity to relay this to the family... Was that portion of Metallic Essence truly so critical? Enough to compel a Dragon Monarch to intervene?"

Li Qinghong replied, "Today... the re-establishment of the True Qi Fruition Attainment is already a foregone conclusion, so that Metallic Essence is naturally vital. A few years ago, the Dragon King of the Admirable Sea came to visit, and he mentioned an even more critical point..."

Her expression grew complex. "The True Qi... the Dragons do not merely *hope* to get a piece of the pie. They *must* secure a piece of the pie. Even Dragon Monarch Xiyang’s intervention in the affairs of True Monarch Shangyuan was, in part, to ensure this True Qi could descend upon the world..."

Li Zhouwei hesitated, processing this, before asking, "Could it be... that the True Qi is essential for the Dragon-kin to advance further?"

Li Qinghong nodded, leaning forward slightly. Though her voice remained soft, her words landed with the weight of thunder:

"The Martial True Qi Malignance Essence. Its divinity is profound and clear within; its ferocious might overflows externally. Its righteous nature halts depravity; its benevolent authority is infinite. It does not dwell alone, nor does it live in isolation. It intertwines with the serpent as its companion; its heart is the perfect balance of Yin and Yang—It annihilates Demons and fiends, preserving Truth through Martial Might!"

"True Dragons... True Dragons..."

"How can they possibly lack 'Truth'?"
