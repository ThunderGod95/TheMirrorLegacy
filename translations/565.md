# Chapter 873: Kongsijiang Demon Bowl

This man was dressed in typical Fei Family attire, and the spear in his hand was scarred and broken. Decades of managing the household had worn away all the color from his face, yet he still retained a trace of the nobleman's bearing.

This was none other than Fei Tongyu, the current head of the Fei Family on the north bank of Moongaze Lake!

The Fei Family had fallen into silence and decline over the decades. Fei Tongyu's days had been the most difficult, and that illusory sword light would always appear before him whenever he closed his eyes at night.

The sight of that man casually slaughtering his grandfather, Fei Wangbai, like a dog, would always play in his mind. From that day on, the Fei Family could no longer restore the Patterned Brocade that had been passed down for generations. A century of accumulation had evaporated, and starting anew plunged them into endless torment...

He had truly awakened from nightmares too many times to ever mistake it! It was definitely that person in the sky! Fei Tongyu's current position was so humble that he didn't even have the qualifications to know that person's name, yet he was not anxious.

He murmured, "Such a big matter... Qingyi can find out... good... good..."

The man who had always been as hesitant as a white weasel calmly gazed at the vast rainbow light in the sky. Clearly, even a single thread of that force could tear him to shreds, yet he felt no fear.

He murmured, "As long as there is a place for vengeance to go, I fear not its disappearance. You beheaded my grandfather and left his corpse lying in the snow under the eyes of all. The body could not be joined back together for three months...

"The Fei Family still has three thousand people who hate with their ancestor's weeping blood. Even a three-year-old child in the peaks draws talismans with wooden sticks. Just wait... just wait..."

Those eyes sank into the black smoke and disappeared into the darkness. Meanwhile, the golden light in the sky brightened again. Si Yuanli remained fully focused, and didn’t show the slightest sign of discovering him.

His blue robe fluttered as he danced through the sky, forcing the two Master Monks to retreat again and again with his ethereal and unrestrained swordsmanship. Si Yuanli had been sealed away by Yuan Xiu for many years, and he reveled in the satisfaction of displaying his sword.

The Pinewhite Full Essence Sword Art had a profound heritage that could be traced back to Sima Jun, who once defended the riverside of Wei State. The sword energy in his hand was snow white, resonating with the Huai River Map beneath his feet and growing ever sharper. The Master Monks' roar only gave him momentary pause, and the jade ring on his wrist flashed bright and dim. He immediately disengaged and glanced up at Li Xuanfeng.

Li Xuanfeng had already exchanged several rounds with the Master Monks, filling the sky with thunderous booms. Their battle was now at a critical juncture.

High in the sky, the six Master Monks glared with round, furious eyes as their Buddhist chants grew louder. Some had three heads; some had six arms; some had burning eyes on their chests; and others had four ears that trembled on both sides, each revealing their true form.

Once they reached the level of Master Monk, apart from two special Dao lineages, most highly cultivated Master Monks were both male and female in form. Their faces shifted between male and female, intertwining in a rather eerie way.

Their arms were strong and graceful, glinting with gold powder. They tightly gripped their dharma artifacts, all bearing down on the golden bow that was interwoven with brilliance. The fierce golden bow had hooked onto the blades of all the weapons, holding them steadily back in midair.

Li Xuanfeng was being restrained by six Buddhist cultivators. His Astral Qi rolled like clouds, materializing from intangible to tangible as countless sharp lights that gradually interwove in the air. They spiraled upward along the edges of his Heavenly Gilded Helm, and coiled around his body.

The hand that braced the golden bow was as steady as a mountain, yet streams of golden light flowed out from between his fingers. A white scroll unfurled beside him, drifting like a long snake, and Li Xuanfeng suddenly vanished.

The six Buddhist cultivators’ dharma artifacts simultaneously dropped down before they caught themselves. Six pairs of eyes, seemingly cast from the same mold, all turned in unison and caught sight of the man in platinum armor manifesting in the south. His longbow was drawn like a full moon and aimed straight at them.

Clang...

The three golden rings in the air suddenly leaped in place, bursting with a dazzling light as if they had seized a fiercely struggling foe. They emitted a frenzied metallic clashing sound, but Li Xuanfeng’s bowstring did not pause.

Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang...

The three Buddhist cultivators holding the golden rings paled as they simultaneously spat out blood. The remaining nine hurriedly formed seals and cast their spells, chanting deep, complex incantations that bewitched the mind, murmuring in the air, "We respectfully summon the 'Kongsijiang Demon Bowl'!"

The grand formation trembled as the great void cracked open with a roar. A point of golden light darted through, falling right in the middle of the twelve. It rippled outward like a small stone dropping into water, swiftly gathering and solidifying into a large purple bowl.

The purple bowl was encircled by two black bands. It bore no inscriptions, yet it was mysterious and solid. Its black mouth swallowed and held countless incoming golden lights.

A treasure of the Purple Mansion Realm!

Si Yuanli’s expression instantly sank, and he grew wary. He secretly sensed some terrifying news.

This Kongsijiang Demon Bowl was unmistakably something a Maha had bestowed. It had undoubtedly been summoned at the directive of one of the Seven Dharma Forms. Its descent here signified that at least one Maha was currently paying close attention to them!

"Hahahahaha!"

Si Yuanli grew extremely vigilant. These twelve had summoned a dharma artifact specifically meant for Li Xuanfeng. The frustration they had felt in failing to defeat a single man earlier dissolved a little, and they all began to laugh loudly, their voices overlapping and resounding through the sky, "A mere tribe from the southern barbarian Mount Yue dares to test the holy laws of our orthodox sect? The Revered One is merciful, but we will make sure you fall here today."

This voice roared like thunder, causing many cultivators to turn their heads.

No matter how powerful Li Xuanfeng was, he was only one man. He was facing twelve orthodox Master Monks of the Way of Emptiness! Each one was at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. They were not just capable of borrowing power from higher forces but also possessed extremely sophisticated formations. How could one person possibly stop them?

At that moment, Li Qinghong's expression creased with worry as she considered how to abandon her current foe and rush forward to help. She almost convinced herself that by fully activating her Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow, she could still pose a threat to the cultivators even if she took a few more injuries

But Li Xuanfeng's expression did not change. He said softly, "Just watch!"

As soon as Li Xuanfeng finished speaking, the golden string in his hand flickered. The scroll at his side leaped into the air and unfurled in midair, twisting and turning like a swimming dragon. A brilliant silver light shone from it.

Countless golden rays surged from his hands. It was like a dam bursting as a flood gushed forth. In an instant, countless beams of profound light flew into that clear silver light.

When the golden rays touched the silver light, they immediately split into gold and silver, then split again, and again until they leaped into the clouds high above.

Clang!

The sky was filled with profound light rushing toward the heavens. However, before it could fall back down, the silver light swept down first. The purple bowl held up somewhat better, but the three golden rings were jolted askew as if struck by a speeding comet, wobbling crazily.

Clang, clang, clang, clang...

The three Buddhist cultivators controlling the golden rings turned pale, but with the help of the formation balancing their mana, their complexions quickly warmed again. Yet all twelve Buddhist cultivators hesitated for a brief moment.

This grand formation had a long heritage and was incredibly wondrous. The twelve of them could not only balance their mana and distribute damage evenly but also connect their minds. They instantly started communicating through the array, "This demon is formidable. The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl can only hold so much; how can we waste it so easily? Better to put it away first and use the formation to respond!"

None of these Buddhist cultivators were simple; they refused to give Li Xuanfeng a chance to test the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl.

The purple bowl vanished, and the twelve returned to their formation, intoning in a booming voice, "Mi!"

A massive golden formation spanned the banks, with countless golden incantations flowing through it. It manifested in the shape of a slightly tilted circular array that was as large as a mountain. It scattered clouds and demons alike with an overwhelming presence.

"What an incredible formation."

By this point, the cultivators on both sides of the battlefield were gradually losing their fighting spirit. But they were all bound by orders from above, so none dared to stop. When they sensed the commotion, they all looked up but had no time to examine the formation closely; they vaguely saw a flickering behind it.

Si Yuanli finally lost his composure, and the light of his sword wavered slightly. Luckily, his opponent had long been beaten to the point of being unable to retaliate, so this slip caused no consequence.

Yet his heart was filled with terror, and he muttered in a low voice, "Thirty-two thousand seven hundred sixty-eight..."

As his words faded, a sky full of stars appeared above him, intertwined in gold and silver. They flickered uncertainly as they slowly grew larger in the pupils of the onlooking cultivators, transforming into a sea of profound light that fell from the sky. But the heavenly downpour was preceded by an aggressively sharp aura.

"Wh-what is this?!"

"Is this Foundation Establishment Realm?!"

The cultivators below had all lost color in their faces. Li Qinghong's eyes turned slightly red as she thought silently, Second Uncle must have used a secret technique that burns his own lifespan for Yuan Xiu...

The sky full of profound light fell like a torrential rain, and the many lesser cultivators on the ground immediately ran for cover. Fortunately, the light gathered on its own halfway down and slammed down on the central formation like a falling river of stars.

The twelve Buddhist cultivators were all pinned inside the formation. Their eyes were filled with gold and silver light. The formation wavered like a lotus leaf in the rain, tilting this way and that, but in the end, there were twelve of them. Every so often, one of them would cough up blood, yet the formation remained unbroken.

The twelve Master Monks were temporarily suppressed, and the profound light filling the sky had not hit the ground. Yet the lesser cultivators on both sides retreated to either bank. The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators also had no intention of stopping them...

The torrential rain of profound light and golden mist forced the offensives on both the north and south sides to temporarily cease. The cultivators on both sides lost their will to fight. Those at the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realms withdrew one after another, leaving only the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators still locked in a stalemate.

By now, almost everyone on the field understood clearly that the outcome came down to Li Xuanfeng and these twelve Buddhist cultivators...

Either Li Xuanfeng would kill all twelve, forcing the north to retreat, or the twelve Master Monks would slay Li Xuanfeng. Once Li Xuanfeng died, the Huai River Map would naturally collapse, and the northern cultivators would have a chance to advance south!

As tens of thousands looked on, the golden string in Li Xuanfeng's hand was drawn back to its full length. His eyes shone with astonishing brightness. Even with the boost from the ancient spirit artifact, it was still not enough. Two streams of his Immortal Foundation within him began to evaporate recklessly, giving off a thin golden mist.

Over the years, Li Xuanfeng had naturally learned methods to burn his essence qi and lifespan. He had studied the Foundation Sacrifice Stabilizing Technique, a secret of the Ning Family. He had already used it once back when he killed Tang Shedu.
𝒇𝒓𝙚𝒆𝔀𝓮𝓫𝒏𝓸𝙫𝓮𝓵.𝓬𝙤𝙢

This secret technique came with extremely severe aftereffects, often overdrawing thirty to forty percent of one's Immortal Foundation, leading to a collapse of one’s cultivation. Although he had used this technique once to kill Tang Shedu, he had remained stable in the Great Ning Palace thanks to Yuan Xiu’s intervention and his current state.

His cultivation was largely stored in talisman seeds, and nearly half separated from his body. Thus, he was effectively always borrowing power from the talisman seeds. This unexpectedly had its advantages where his Immortal Foundation was supported by the talisman seeds, and unless he exhausted it all at once with the secret technique, his cultivation would not collapse no matter how he drew on it.

Thus, now he wielded the technique again without hesitation, seizing the moment while the twelve were tied down. The golden-red arrow in his hand grew ever more solid, with surging mana and Astral Qi condensing in his grip.

Buzz...

The sky full of profound light lasted dozens of breaths. When that gold-and-silver brilliance finally faded, the golden-red light in Li Xuanfeng's hand also disappeared at the same time. The twelve trembled as one but had no time to summon the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl.

Only the three golden rings floated up alone and suddenly grabbed something. The three circular rings paused for a moment, and buckled. An instant later, the dharma artifact let out a sharp tearing sound in the air.

Ka ka....clang...

The three dharma artifacts exploded, scattering golden fragments that fell with a rustling sound. The three Buddhist cultivators had severed their connection with the dharma artifacts in time, yet they still coughed up blood, their faces pale as gold paper.

Fortunately, it had bought them enough time. The purple-gold bowl reappeared in the air, swallowing the freed golden-red arrow. It shook twice, then flickered bright and dim.

The twelve Buddhist cultivators seized the moment, and decisively leaped from their positions. They put away the bowl, and the remaining nine Buddhist cultivators shifted positions, reforming the grand formation.

They shouted in unison, "We beseech Suxikong! True path to subdue the demon!"

The sky vibrated with a roar. The remaining nine Buddhist cultivators' bodies shone brightly. A pair of cold, emotionless eyes opened on their chests in unison. Golden lines erupted all over their faces. They no longer looked human.

The strange eyes all turned toward Li Xuanfeng. There was no colorful light or golden brilliance, no sign of anything tearing through the air. But the radiance beneath his feet trembled, causing the cultivators' footing to sway.

The bright light on Li Xuanfeng's body dimmed for an instant, and he was frozen in place. The nine Buddhist cultivators all leaped forward together. The formation beneath their feet dissolved instantly, and they attacked together, empowered by Suxikong's true form.

Boom!

In that instant, gold clashed with stone, like the meeting of a landslide and a tsunami. All the brilliance in the sky dimmed, and both the northern and southern banks froze simultaneously.

Ten Buddhist cultivators struck together, empowered by Suxikong's true form that had been summoned by the grand formation. Their combined strength had reached a terrifying level.

Si Yuanli stood to the side, a sense of impending doom rising in his heart. He exclaimed in horror, "I underestimated them!"

The radiant pass beneath his feet wavered. Si Yuanli broke into a cold sweat. Panicked, he searched the intertwining golden and multicolored lights of the various weapons and saw a hint of red.

Ting ting...

The scattered droplets of blood were like shattered strings of jade pearls, each round and crystal clear, scattering in all directions. When they struck the dharma artifacts stacked by the Master Monks, they actually rang with a sound like jade beads.

Clatter clatter...

Blood dripped and turned into a golden rain in the dim sky. Under the gaze of countless anxious or relieved eyes, both the golden bow and Li Xuanfeng’s figure vanished.

"Where is that fierce man?"

"Could he have turned to ashes and smoke...?"

Si Yuanli stared as the blood rain fell. Suddenly, he heard a crisp clash of metal on metal, and an icy, hoarse voice echoed in the sky, carrying all the way to the ears of the northern and southern cultivators.

"When the Heavenly Stem meets Ren and Gui[1], gold is used to its utmost..."

The crisp clash of metal grew even louder, almost louder than thunder itself. The cold, hoarse voice grew even deeper, "Invoke the proper position of the Metal of Shen and You[2], grant me dominion over metal!"

1. Ren and Gui refers to the Heavenly Stems where Ren is the ninth stem and Gui is the tenth. ☜

2. Shen and You refer to the Ninth and Tenth Earthly Branches ☜
