# Chapter 1146: Lost Territory

'That must be the Qilin's heir.'

Touba Ci glanced at the man's face and felt a certainty settle in his heart. His grip on the long, demonic-flame-wreathed halberd tightened, a flicker of shock and horror crossing his eyes.

'He's already in the Purple Mansion Realm...'

As one of the most critical figures in the conflict between north and south, Li Zhouwei had shaken the world not just with his divine abilities, but with his terrifying cultivation speed. The man had already mastered three divine abilities and reached the middle stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, yet he was barely over ninety years old!

Such speed was almost unheard of.

Touba Ci's own uncle, a proud descendant of the Great Liang and the current regent king, had been one hundred and twenty-two when he'd mastered his third divine ability. The now-famous Wei Xuanyin had been even slower, set back by the decline of his Veiled Yin. Even Jiang Yan of the prestigious Gao Pingwang clan, renowned in recent years for his rapid cultivation, had taken one hundred and ten years.

Even setting aside tales of reincarnation, few of the high masters on Mount Luoxia could claim to be faster. Touba Ci knew this for a fact—when the Liang fell, Wei Kan, the True Monarch's own direct disciple, had been ninety-six when he first descended from the mountain, and he too possessed only three divine abilities!

If Li Zhouwei was not yet a century old, how old could his heir possibly be? Seventy? Eighty? The pure blood of the Wei lineage flowed through his veins. While he couldn't be compared to the likes of Wei Kan or Yao Guanyi, his chances of one day touching upon the Purple Mystery were far from small!

He cast an incredulous glance at the young man's golden eyes, feeling the indescribable coldness that flowed within them.

'Give him time, and he'll be another Great Daoist Master!'

In the moment Touba Ci was stunned, Li Jiangqian had already clasped his hands together and slightly opened his eyes, his heart on high alert.

'Formidable...'

His Great Parting Scripture was amplified by his mastery of traversing the Great Void. From the instant he'd leaped from the lake to the moment the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument had unleashed its power, the interval had been infinitesimally short. Gongsun Bei had been utterly unable to mount an effective defense, yet Touba Ci had gone from detection to activating a Spiritual Artifact in the blink of an eye. It was inhuman!

Without a shred of hesitation, the Li Fire in the crimson-robed man's hand flared. The archaic, amber-like flame leaped from his pale palm, streaked across the sky, and lunged straight for Touba Ci!

The Northern Barbarian turned his gaze. Before Li Jiangqian's solemn eyes, the light of Veiled Yin swirling around his feathered robes suddenly transformed, becoming a churning, pale gray torrent of Pit Water that surged forward.

In that instant, water and fire collided in a burst of pearlescent white light. Touba Ci, who had just raised his halberd, froze and forcefully changed its trajectory to block the attack.

"Oh?"

To his astonishment, the flame burned straight through the wall of Pit Water and rushed him with unabated fury. It slammed viciously against his halberd, erupting in a sheet of fire.

Touba Ci's Dao-Profundity was considerable; he could naturally identify his opponent's Li Fire. But he could also see that Li Jiangqian's divine ability was faint, a clear sign of a recent breakthrough with little time to nurture it. His own Substituted Hindrance, on the other hand, was a divine ability of Profound Qi that he had cultivated for many years!

'Profound Qi is meant to suppress the weak, to transform into Pit Water and extinguish Li Fire. My Substituted Hindrance manifested that very Pit Water. The combined effect should have suppressed his Li Fire to a terrifying degree!'

Though the flame was not strong and quickly dissipated like smoke under the assault of the Profound Qi, it had managed to extinguish a small patch of the roiling demonic flames. Touba Ci's expression shifted as a realization struck him.

'Supreme Yang!'

Even as his mind raced, his hands moved without pause. The halberd lunged forward like a dragon, stirring the Profound Yellow Qi that filled the air as it shot toward its target!

Li Jiangqian’s eyebrows shot up. He pulled his hands back, conjuring a wave of rising Li-Light that resembled a thousand crimson clouds tinged with gold. It swirled within a hazy Li-mist before crashing down.

The Great Parting Scripture.

"Dong!"

A cacophony of shattering sounds erupted, like blades striking a cavern of porcelain. Faced with the churning Profound Qi, the Li Fire scattered and retreated. The crimson-robed man was forced back a step, summoning the Southern Brightness Heart-Fire to counter.

But just then, Touba Ci's lips moved. An ancient, time-worn incantation tumbled from them in overlapping layers. His eyes blinked once, turning a pure, profound yellow as he stared straight at Li Jiangqian.

Calamity of the Shrouded Sky!

Li Jiangqian felt a piercing shriek erupt in his ears, as if a chain of golden rings was being smashed right in front of his face. His vision bleached white!

The familiar coolness from his Shengyang Acupoint flooded his senses. His vision cleared after only a moment's darkness, but he found the dharma power in his body erupting into chaos. His smoothly circulating divine abilities were thrown into disarray, leaving him paralyzed.

The halberd was already upon him!

This divine ability of Profound Qi was so tyrannical that it sent shockwaves through his own arts. In the Great Void, the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, which had been locking down the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform, flickered and dimmed.

Worse, the dust in the distance had settled, revealing an approaching expanse of greenish-white light. Gongsun Bei was riding it toward them!

The man had taken the full force of the Great Parting's White Brilliance. His face was deathly pale, and the perfectly circular hole in his chest pulsed with layers of Li Fire. The glow of Dawn Qi repeatedly tried to smother the flames, only to be scattered each time.

Even with Touba Ci's intervention and a moment to meditate and take medicine, his power had been slashed by a full thirty percent. But it was more than enough.

Despite his high estimation of Touba Ci's power, Li Jiangqian felt a profound chill seep into his heart, and a cold sweat broke out across his body. Fortunately, the Great Void rumbled at that moment. A hand grabbed his collar, and stepping on roiling flames, pulled him sideways in a single step!

From one side, a brilliant Celestial Gate rose to suppress the halberd. From the other, a greenish-yellow ruler descended to barely hold back the Dawn Qi. A sharp command rang out in Li Jiangqian’s ears.

"Edict!"

The vast Light of the Six Harmonies flooded his body, purging the Profound Qi divine ability. Li Jiangqian coughed out a puff of black gas and looked up just in time to hear Gongsun Bei's booming laughter. The Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform in the sky above was rapidly expanding as it plummeted toward them.

Gongsun Bei laughed.

"Perfect! We'll capture them all at once!"

His face was wreathed in smiles, but Touba Ci's expression changed slightly as he took a step back.

The Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform hung frozen in mid-air, bound by countless threads of fine golden light that rendered it immobile. A layer of bright, dancing Li Fire covered its surface, constantly neutralizing the brilliance of its divine ability.

An infinite darkness had spread across the sky. Below, the great desert rolled on, the setting sun lying like a dying tiger between heaven and earth. A golden-eyed young man stood with a halberd in one hand. He held his other hand before his lips, where a flickering flame the size of a soybean—the flame of his life-mandate—danced.

Golden blood still dripped from the halberd's blade. A spectacular, seven-colored gash ran across the young man's cheek, deep enough to reveal the bone beneath. But his golden eyes were filled with a placid coldness that made Touba Ci narrow his eyes in vigilance and Gongsun Bei grit his teeth in hatred.

'Li Zhouwei...'

'Where did he come from? Something's wrong... something is definitely wrong... What was he guarding?'

'Baiye? Don't tell me it fell that quickly!'

Li Ximing showed no surprise at all, using the brief pause to reposition himself. As he moved, the darkness in the sky vanished. In Gongsun Bei's eyes, the image of the golden halberd swelled rapidly.

Li Zhouwei was before him!

Once, wielding the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform, Gongsun Bei had pinned this Qilin to the lake's surface. Even without the Spiritual Treasure, he had been confident in his ability to suppress the so-called King Wei.

But now, the man before him had mastered three divine abilities at a speed worthy of a reincarnated master. He charged forward, his fearsome, majestic face illuminated by the shining white Qilin patterns on his skin, and for a single, terrifying moment, Gongsun Bei felt his courage fail him.

A rain-patterned vase instantly lit up. The light of the Plea to Supplant the Night followed, diminishing the Bright Yang's illusory radiance, before releasing a stream of jade-like, emerald droplets.

In an instant, a heavy gloom descended. The sun and moon vanished, heat and cold were inverted, and the flow of qi stagnated. The halberd's dazzling light was steadily diminished by this strange radiance, even as the Binding Light technique shone down to counter it.

Gongsun Bei was skilled, after all. Though his humble origins meant his Spiritual Artifact was not particularly powerful, the profound might of his Plea to Supplant the Night still greatly weakened the Binding Light. One technique leveraged the suppressing power of its Dao lineage, the other drew upon the noble might of a superior Spiritual Artifact; in the end, they canceled each other out.

But the halberd, empowered by Sovereign's Perilous Tread, was already at his throat!

Unending Dawnfire!

A brilliant flash of Dawn Qi washed over the young man, but it failed to slow him in the slightest. The halberd crashed down upon Gongsun Bei, exploding in a wave of Heavenly Light.

Only then did the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform break free from the Southern Emperor's Profound Art and return to suppress its master's foe!

The platform was, after all, an Ancient Spiritual Treasure. In comparison, the Li family's Heavenly Nurture Urn suffered from a weakening Dao Lineage, and the Pure Yang Bracelets were merely ceremonial artifacts. Only the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument could truly compare. Now, as the platform descended with the suppressive power of the Bright Yang Dao Lineage, even Li Zhouwei was forced to take a step back.

Gongsun Bei, however, was coughing up great mouthfuls of Heavenly Light. His already grievously wounded dharma body was beginning to collapse. He watched in horror as the darkness began to envelop him once more, and the white Qilin brought two fingers together, conjuring that terrifying, soybean-sized flame again.

'I have to get out of here!'

...

The sky was a dreary gray, crisscrossed by streams of light and qi.

A thick, abyssal qi rose into the air like a hidden black sea, dissolving every divine ability it touched. On the other side, the air flickered between light and dark, faint, silvery-white cracks appearing in space.

A small drum floated in mid-air, its long golden tassels fluttering. A small silver mallet rhythmically struck the drumhead, causing the sky to pulse with colorful, alternating light.

The light seemed faint, but it caused the underworld carriage submerged in the Exiled Mist to tremble violently. Its delicately carved, dark windows rattled as if battered by a hurricane, threatening to burst open at any moment.

A terrifying divine ability stretched across the heavens. The Exiled Qi sealed off the Great Void, cutting off inside from out. The master of the underworld carriage raised his head, his voice sharp and cold.

"Qi Lanyan... how many lives do you have to waste on me?"

A corner of the black clouds parted, vaguely revealing the icy face of the Daoist-robed man within. He adjusted his crown, raised an eyebrow, and spoke calmly.

"Daoist Friend Yang, we simply serve different masters. Whether I return to my mountain to pursue the Purple Mystery or die here in this northern storm, what need have I for multiple lives? You, on the other hand..."

"You are merely waiting to accomplish your task and retire. You still have one life left to you."

His words were placid, but they made the carriage window rattle even more furiously. Yang Ruiyi's voice was low and heavy.

"Qi Lanyan... do you think anyone is fooled by the banner you fly? The great tides of this world cannot be turned by a single person or a single family."

Qi Lanyan merely smiled, estimating that the time was near.

"And how do you know," he said softly, "that a greater power does not stand behind me?"

In that instant, the golden silk ribbons of the drum leaped into the air. Three small mallets inscribed with profound patterns struck the drumhead in unison, shaking the very heavens. An impossibly dense, silver-white thunder erupted from within the Exiled Qi, blasting through the blockade with a roar that echoed across the world!

"BOOM!"

The dark, profound carriage emerged from a blessed land churning with purple qi. The man inside watched the streak of light vanish into the distance, then stood motionless, a strange look on his face as he silently swallowed a mouthful of blood.

'Thunder... is ultimately tyrannical.'

With Li Zhouwei heading to Baiye, Yang Ruiyi had naturally made for his long-desired destination of Shanji at top speed, only to be intercepted halfway by Qi Lanyan himself.

The northern and southern forces had clashed many times. Yang Ruiyi had often taken to the field personally, coming and going as he pleased. Yet his counterpart, Qi Lanyan, had always remained aloof in his mountain sanctuary. The only time he had acted was to lead his people away from Baiye to prevent the situation from escalating.

This was their first true confrontation, and it left Yang Ruiyi feeling wary and disheartened.

'The Drum of Annihilating Profound Thunder... he wields it with such ease. No wonder the Viewing Pavilion faction took him in. Qi Lanyan... is a capable man indeed. In this, the south is still lacking.'

Unlike Comprehending Profoundity with its many inherited Dao Lineages, the southern Underworld had long ignored the mortal realm, leaving it with no noteworthy traditions to speak of. The Yang clan they now relied on was itself a fallen house with few members. They had possessed some foundation when they migrated south and established their various prefectures, but after the rise and fall of the Yang-Yue, they were a shadow of their former selves.

It was precisely because of this decline that he, Yang Ruiyi, had been granted his current opportunity. But it also meant that when men like Qi Lanyan wielded Dao Lineages and dharma artifacts of a comparable level, he found himself struggling.

'The threshold to the Purple Mystery... I've waited too many years. I can't delay any longer...'

His gaze was like ice, but he had no time to catch his breath. Since Qi Lanyan had intercepted him here, the northern cultivators emerging from Shanji would surely press their advantage and head for the Linhai prefectures.

'If I let them penetrate our heartland and cause chaos in Simin, ten lives wouldn't be enough to pay for my failure!'

Although his situation was similar to that of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao—with both the Yang and Guanhua families bearing the responsibility for their own fortunes—neither dared to cross the other's fundamental boundaries and threaten the foundations of the Underworld. Still, he couldn't afford to gamble his life on that assumption. He immediately began to retract the Exiled Qi that filled the sky, preparing to form a seal for communication, when he saw a woman riding the wind toward him. Her figure was unsteady, her face ashen. She stopped before him and spoke in a low voice.

"Great General... the south has held! Linhai Prefecture is intact... Lord Lin has performed a great service!"

A wave of relief washed over Yang Ruiyi. He let out a sincere sigh of relief, a smile touching his lips.

"Xiukui is as reliable as ever!"

But as his finger traced a pattern on his palm, the expression of the Grand General of the North of Song suddenly changed. An icy dread washed over his face.

'Baiye? It's lost...'

He was horrified. He had disregarded the eastern front and sent Li Zhouwei to Baiye, and they had still been defeated.

He turned his head, his gaze dark, just in time to see a strand of golden light streak across the Great Void. He opened his mouth to curse, but when he saw the old man covered in roiling True Fire and riddled with wounds, he swallowed his anger and asked coldly,

"What happened!"

The Great General had always presented a benevolent front. Seeing this expression for the first time, Situ Huo knew they must have fallen into a northern plot. He immediately feigned weakness and cried out in distress.

"It was someone from Comprehending Profoundity! They cultivate Returning Earth!"

Yang Ruiyi's gaze was grim. His adversary's last words echoed in his mind. He listened intently to the memory, then closed his eyes, gritted his teeth, and took a deep, shuddering breath.

"A Dao Lineage of Numinous Treasure... it truly is Tongxuan Palace..."
