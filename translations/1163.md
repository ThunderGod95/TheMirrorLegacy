# Chapter 1163: Father and Brothers in the Hall

The Imperial Palace of the Great Zhao, Jingzhao.

Dynasties had risen and fallen across the northern heavens, and this city, situated at the heart of the world, had served as the imperial capital for nearly all of them. In the time of the Zhou, it was known as Fenghao; to the Wei, it was Changyang. After the Qi burned the Wei palaces, they dared not occupy the city, establishing their capital in the east instead. It was not until the Liang dynasty that the Touba clan returned, re-establishing the imperial capital. When the Zhao Emperor Zhaowu took the throne, he simply occupied the Liang palace, and so it had remained through the generations.

Within the palace's labyrinthine walls, snow fell upon the golden halls. A winter crow perched on a crossbeam, its raucous caw echoing through the grand chamber. From the distant watchtower at the gate, the crack of a horsewhip split the air.

"A report..."

"A crushing defeat at Lake Xian! Daoist Master Qi has perished!"

"The pretender Song has seized... Jianghuai!"

The voice echoed from one pavilion to the next, relayed by a succession of purple-robed eunuchs, its message surging ever upward until it reached the great hall itself.

Inside the hall, magnificent golden pillars soared toward the ceiling, their bases carved with the images of suppressed Fenglin and Flood Dragons. The chamber should have been a scene of brilliant golden splendor, yet it was inexplicably dark, a gloom so profound one could not see their own hand.

Flanking the main hall were seven high-backed lotus pedestals, each supporting a towering, ornate pagoda. Intricate carvings of wondrous, sacred lotuses adorned the structures, while beneath them, various immortals and demons were depicted in states of subjugation. A flickering radiance at the peak of each pagoda was the only source of light in the oppressive dark.

But only six of the lotus pagodas were lit, and only five had monks seated in meditation below them. Some drank wine and tore at meat, while others chanted sutras with hands clasped. Beyond these towering structures, down the steps, stood the court officials, their heads bowed low. Their black ceremonial caps seemed to melt into the shadows on the floor.

On the main throne, the Emperor of the Great Zhao sat clad in magnificent robes, cutting a majestic figure. But his face was hidden behind layers of veiled curtains, and he remained utterly motionless. To his left and right were two small tables, occupied by a monk and a Daoist.

The eunuch's report traveled up the ranks until it reached the ears of the purple-robed Daoist Master. A soft laugh escaped her throat.

"Even the Profound Governance Pavilion miscalculates sometimes."

The monks below showed varied expressions. Seated on the emperor's other side, Jiang Toushou raised an eyebrow, his cold gaze sweeping over the monk from the Way of Great Desire who was still drinking and eating.

"Tian Langzhi is a master of his craft, isn't he!" he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "What, does he think the Numinous Treasure Order is full of dead men? He knew the man's surname was Liu, yet he still had to test the waters?"

Jiang Toushou had been schemed against and sold out by Tian Langzhi during the loss of the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain, and the Maha had clearly not forgiven him. His eyes were full of ice and fury. The monk below, however, just chuckled.

"Oh? It seems you, my lord, think everyone in the Way of Great Desire is already dead. We knew Cheng Xunzhi had surpassed the Purple Mystery and that the Yang clan was protecting him. Who could our Way have sent south without risking life and limb? Had Lord Tian Langzhi gone himself, who knows what kind of earth-shattering battle would have erupted, completely derailing the situation in Jianghuai. Who would have shouldered the blame then? Was sacrificing a single subordinate not enough?"

"Since the Yang clan already laid the prize out for us, their stance was clear. What was the harm in testing the waters at Tangdao Mountain? If we had succeeded in converting him, the benefits would have been immense! The Numinous Treasure Order is just too petty, unwilling to lose even a shred of face!"

The monk's rhetoric was sharp, leaving Jiang Toushou speechless. The latter shot him a disgusted look.

"This was a catastrophic defeat. The Profound Governance Pavilion must be held accountable!"

At this declaration, no one, from Zong Chang on high to the monks below, would support him. Zong Chang even laughed.

"Accountable? Do you think Wei Xuanyin will even acknowledge you?"

The cultivators were disdainful, but the emperor on the throne dared not ignore the matter. After a moment of deliberation, he spoke.

"The south is rife with schemes. The Grand Preceptor is burdened with countless duties and cannot oversee everything... This should not be held against him..."

His voice was timid and hesitant. Jiang Toushou ignored him. Having made his position clear, he turned to the others below and said flatly,

"Since Jianghuai has been lost, the pretender Song's armies are now at Chengyun, pointing like a dagger at the central plains. We must select a person of high prestige to integrate the Immortal and Buddhist Daos and lead an expedition south to prevent a sudden northward advance."

A dead silence fell over the hall.

'Qi Lanyan, a master of his caliber, perished there in an instant. Who else would dare try to stop them?'

Seeing that no one responded, Jiang Toushou continued as if he had expected as much.

"The Valiant King, Gao Fu, has a reputation for virtue and has surpassed the Purple Mystery. He should be summoned. And the Lotus Temple, being adjacent to Chengyun, should also act... to mount a coordinated defense."

He had named two of the most unpopular choices, and the assembled cultivators immediately nodded in agreement. Only Mingmeng, the Maha seated beneath the pagoda glowing with lotus-pink light, looked up to object, but he was silenced before he could speak.

"As for the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain..."

This great mountain overlooked the Luoxia Plain, a position of undeniable strategic importance. The expressions of several monks shifted as Jiang Toushou continued,

"...the Way of Great Desire and the Great Adoration Dharma Realm will make arrangements to contain it... and the great clans of the Luoxia region... cannot simply stand by and watch."

He turned to Zong Chang.

"This will require your efforts, Lady Zong!"

Hearing that she would have to deal with the great clans, Zong Chang's expression soured. This was a task that should have fallen to Gongsun Bei, but with him seriously injured, the burden fell to her. Despite her reluctance, she could only give a curt nod of assent.

Only then did the pagoda of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm flicker faintly. The monk below it clasped his hands together.

"The Song State has also lost a number of powerful Daoist Masters. They have no energy for a continued fight. As long as we make a strong showing, they will not press north."

"But... that Wei scoundrel..."

The moment the name was spoken, the entire court fell silent. Each faction wore a complex expression, and for a moment, no one spoke. Only Mingmeng broke the silence with a dramatic, feigned sigh.

"Are we all still calling him the 'Wei scoundrel'? Wouldn't 'King Wei' be more appropriate?"

"My disciple-brother was just gravely injured, and now I'm being sent to face the enemy. Whose turn will it be next? A little courtesy wouldn't hurt!"

His words left the hall simmering with a mixture of anger and speechlessness. The emperor on the throne was at a loss, looking first to his left, then to his right. After a long moment, Jiang Toushou rose to his feet, his face a cold mask of fury.

"You... you people from the Lotus Temple have the least courtesy of all, and you dare lecture us!" he spat.

Mingmeng sighed.

"How can you call it a lecture? It's about King Wei..."

"It's the Wei scoundrel!"

Jiang Toushou's roar of fury cut him off, startling the emperor behind the curtains into a violent shudder. Mingmeng simply looked to the heavens and sighed again.

"Your determination to oppose the Bright Yang is truly admirable, my lord!"

Jiang Toushou had never intended to make an enemy of the Bright Yang! The accusation was like a bucket of ice water dumped over his head. His expression changed drastically.

"Slander!"

Mingmeng shrugged.

"Then let's just call him King Wei."

...

The darkness in the sky rapidly receded. On the ground below, dense formations of troops were arrayed. The surrounding mountain forest was stained with blood. A young man walked forward on a path of True Qi, his gaze complicated.

'The Baiye region has been devastated.'

The lands of the former Xu State, anciently known as Jianghuai, were now also called Sanjiang and Sanxi. The cataclysm at the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter had ruined the White River. Now, after the Zhao and Song armies had contested the Baiye region three times, sixty to seventy percent of the population was gone. Ironically, the last territory to be recovered, Baihai, was the only one with a semblance of its former population.

'Jianghuai finally has a master... but the lands of my homeland are left in ruins.'

Li Jiangliang traveled through the air, moving swiftly until he reached a ravaged mountain peak. His two elder brothers were already there, seated amidst roiling torrents of water and fire. One was bandaging a wound on his waist, the other wiping blood from his sword. The scene was surprisingly harmonious.

While the other divine ability masters had been conquering various mountain strongholds, their two armies had entered Baiye. With the fall of Jianghuai, even the Mahas were struggling to survive, let alone the Merciful One. The enemy had fled completely, allowing them to sweep through unopposed.

In the battle of Lake Xian, not only had the two brothers avoided serious injury, they had each gained considerable merit relying on their command of water and fire. Having subsequently conquered numerous territories, they were now resting their troops, an air of justified pride about them.

"Elder brothers!"

Seeing Li Jiangliang, Li Jiangxia stood up with a smile.

"Fourth Brother must have good news!"

Li Jiangliang smiled back.

"Tangdao Mountain is secure!"

Both men were seasoned commanders and understood the strategic importance of the Tangdao Mountain pass. They both broke into smiles. But Li Jiangliang's brow was furrowed with worry.

"How are Father's injuries?"

The question made both of them pause. Li Jianglong chose his words carefully. 

"We heard King Wei slew another Maha at Chengyun. He should be fine."

Li Jiangliang let out a breath of relief. His brother then asked,

"Are there any orders from the palace?"

Li Jiangliang nodded to his two brothers, a pleased look on his face.

"Tangdao is secure, Baihai is pacified, and the regions of Chengyun and Baixiang have surrendered after witnessing King Wei's might. Only Shanji is putting up a desperate resistance. I have been ordered to have all divisions gather at Baihai to regroup and receive their assignments... By my calculations, Father should be arriving in Baihai soon as well. We can go together."

He paused for a moment before continuing in a solemn tone,

"Securing Jianghuai is the top priority. As for Shanji... the Grand General will return to take it personally."

Li Jianglong nodded in agreement. Shanji had been temporarily set aside by Yang Ruiyi for the sake of the bigger picture. Even if that weren't the case, as the supreme commander of the southern campaign, it was only right that he claim the most important victory. Still, a trace of regret crossed his face.

"It's a pity... the Shu army has occupied the White River. The Sanjiang region is no longer whole..."

Li Jiangliang offered a faint smile but said nothing, merely gesturing for them to proceed. The three of them rode their True Qi into the sky, heading toward Baihai. As they neared the Xuanmiao Temple, the Grand Emissary of the Profound, a man second only to one and above ten thousand in the Song court, finally raised an eyebrow.

"The Song State will reclaim the lands of our homeland. Our armies are at the peak of their strength, and the north is unable to interfere. The matter of the White River... we will negotiate if we can. If not... we will fight."

His eyes gleamed, his entire demeanor transformed.

His two elder brothers exchanged a look, their hands itching for a fight. Each lost in his own thoughts, they fell into a shared silence as the Xuanmiao Temple appeared before them.

The temple had once stood on a perilous cliff, but now it was a scene of utter devastation. The most striking sight was not the temple itself, but an enormous mountain landscape that seemed to have fallen from the sky, pinning a mountain-sized black tiger in the sea below. The beast's body was shattered, suppressed alive in the Baihai Creek, bound by heavy chains, unable to move.

Its four limbs were broken, its teeth smashed, and it had been dragged all the way from the north. Unable to live and unable to die, it was sunk in the Baihai Creek like a trophy displayed by King Wei.

The three brothers felt a mix of emotions as they descended from the sky. They were met by a man clad in copper armor, crackling with lightning and electricity. A large bronze bell was tied at his waist, and his face was split by a hearty grin.

"Welcome, my lords!"

The greeting startled all three of them. Li Jiangliang quickly stepped forward. 

"Clan Uncle... you are too kind!"

The man guarding the location was none other than Li Zhouda, and the armored soldiers covering the mountain were all troops from Ting Province.

Li Zhouda was clearly in high spirits. He laughed loudly.

"You have all grasped the Profound. You are either Founding Dukes or Emissaries of the Profound. You've earned the title of 'my lord.'"

After a few polite exchanges, they followed him up the mountain, passing through a temporary defensive array. The view opened up before them. The once-pristine white mountain gate lay in ruins amidst a field of rubble. The two brown characters for 'Xuanmiao' were smashed to pieces, ground under a pair of spiritual boots.

Situ Huo.

Sand filled the air, and the ground was littered with pink lotus petals. The battle at Xuanmiao Temple had raged for a long time, yet the old man stood there with his hands behind his back, his expression grim. Clearly, he had failed to capture the Turbid Emptiness Liangli Maha.

On the other side, a youth in blue robes was smiling as he spoke with a Daoist Master in white and gold robes. Although Li Ximing appeared composed, the faint pallor of his face and the way his eyes kept glancing south revealed his anxiety.

Seeing the three brothers, Li Ximing visibly relaxed and hurried forward.

"Have orders arrived?" he asked urgently.

Li Jiangliang quickly returned the courtesy.

"We have received the Emperor's orders. We request an audience with King Wei!"

"He just returned from Chengyun," Li Ximing said quickly. "He's resting in the main hall. His injuries are severe. You should deliver the orders as soon as possible."

A knot of anxiety tightened in Li Jiangliang's chest. He cast aside formalities and nodded, stepping forward. But he was representing the Song Emperor. Li Jiangxia and Li Jianglong reacted instantly. One stood to the side, while the other stepped forward to push open the doors for him.

The darkness in the hall was instantly dispelled by light.

This had been the main hall of the Xuanmiao Temple, filled with Dharma lamps of all sizes. Now, all of them were extinguished, leaving only their dark bronze posts standing in the gloom. A tattered gold-patterned black robe, shredded in battle, was draped over the high seat at the head of the hall, seeming to breathe with the faint stirrings of air.

For once, King Wei was dressed in white. His eyes were closed, his long eyebrows tightly knitted together. He was leaning against the left side of the throne, one hand supporting his forehead, the other resting at his side. His chest rose and fell with powerful, even breaths, as if he were asleep.

But the half of his face turned toward the hall entrance was covered in a dense network of fractured, multicolored lines that pulsed faintly with each breath. He looked like an old, ailing suanni, dozing in the midst of its pain.

The White Qilin, who was the center of attention wherever he went, now seemed to have faded into the fabric of the hall. The palpable aura of the Bright Yang's monarchical power, that ambitious force that always surrounded him, was gone. The hall was intensely quiet, filled with a profound sense of security.

But as Li Jiangliang's gaze fell upon this scene, he froze where he stood.

Amidst the tranquility and peace, standing silently on the steps below the throne like a ghost, was a man.

He was clad in crimson-gold Daoist robes, his black hair unbound and flowing freely, giving him a dashing, unrestrained air. His long eyebrows slanted up toward his temples, and his narrow eyes held a hint of wickedness that made his calm smile seem ruthless.

He was like a venomous snake, perfectly blended with the atmosphere of the great hall. Yet his eyes, the same brilliant gold as his robes, stared directly at them, devoid of emotion but tinged with a vicious crimson hue—the sole point of terror in this sea of tranquility.

Li Jiangliang knew who he was, of course. So did his two brothers behind him.

The powerfully built, dignified general in armor suddenly tightened his grip on the hilt of his saber, his expression rigid. The calm, gentle-faced commander in robes and feathers swiftly bowed his head, his eyes filled with disbelief.

'Elder Brother.'

In the dim hall, it felt as though only that crimson light was moving. The composure of a man who commanded the court and established the rites of the state was gone. The dominance of a man who pacified regions and rode roughshod over Baiye had vanished. The three Holders of the Profound lost their presence, reduced to their former selves. It was as if they were back in the golden hall on the lake, with this elder brother standing so naturally before their father, and them, standing below.

But things were vastly different now.

Before, Li Jiangqian had stood before their father, facing him, showing them only his back, a figure they could gaze upon freely. Now, with their father injured, Li Jiangqian had turned around. He stood guard by the bedside, his back to his father, standing squarely in the center, silently watching them.

This watchfulness, now without the oversight of Li Zhouwei, filled Li Jiangliang with an uncontrollable fear. The weaker their father behind his elder brother seemed, the more he blended into the hall's serenity, the stronger that fear became. It terrified Li Jiangliang, who had never known such self-doubt.

'What is happening?'

Even more unsettled were his two brothers behind him.

Third Brother Li Jiangxia's courage began to falter. The five fingers gripping his saber hilt tightened until his knuckles were white. Second Brother Li Jianglong shut his eyes tightly, as if trying to bury his head in his chest. This had nothing to do with bravery; neither brother would have bowed their head so easily even before a Great Daoist Master. But this moment was profoundly strange.

Li Jiangliang stood there, frozen, until the ailing suanni on the throne slowly opened its multicolored eyes.

"Cough..."

Li Jiangqian flicked his sleeves, turned, and knelt respectfully.

"Father... your sons are here."

As their elder brother turned away, the terrifying pressure that had filled the hall suddenly vanished. The past few moments felt like a dream. The sounds of wind and people returned, and only then did Li Jiangxia realize the hall hadn't been silent at all. His hand relaxed its grip on his saber.

King Wei's eyes were so full of color that it was impossible to read his expression. His voice was steady.

"Are there orders?"

Li Jiangliang stepped forward and said respectfully,

"There is a verbal edict. For the matter of Jianghuai, King Wei is to act at his own discretion. If you have the strength to spare, you may request the Ting Province army to surround Profound Peak to bolster our position. If your illness is severe, we hope King Wei will focus on recuperation and return to his duties as regent soon."

He paused slightly before kneeling on one knee and producing a gold and jade box from his sleeve.

"The Emperor heard that King Wei was afflicted by Wu Earth. Considering the difficulty of curing such a flaw, he has personally bestowed a piece of Chuchun Hanging Wood, in the hope that Your Highness recovers swiftly and may once again campaign against Zhao and Shu."

Clearly, the Song Emperor had kept his word, even granting him immense freedom and offering aid. This brought a measure of peace to Li Zhouwei's features. 

"Jianghuai is not yet pacified; I am unworthy of His Majesty's grace," he said politely. "For now, we await the Grand General's return to pacify Shanji together."

Li Jiangqian raised his sleeves and took the jade box from Li Jiangliang, presenting it to his father. Li Jiangliang then added,

"This son also has the edicts for the enfeoffment of the various surrendering ministers. Does Father wish to..."

Seeing King Wei wave a dismissive hand, Li Jiangqian nodded and stepped forward.

"Father is unwell. I shall oversee the ceremony in his stead."

Li Jiangliang nodded, as expected. This brought a slight smile to Li Jiangqian's face. But then his fourth brother looked up, hesitating for a moment.

"Congratulations, Elder Brother... on achieving your divine ability!"

Li Jiangqian's gaze lingered on his face for a moment before shifting to his other two brothers. They both clasped their hands in a salute. 

"Congratulations, Elder Brother!"

"Haha."

Li Jiangqian let out two short laughs without any further comment. He ushered them out and shut the hall doors firmly, leaving Li Zhouwei alone on the throne. The king closed his eyes once more.

A mysterious Daoist rhythm resonated in his heart.

Illuminating Sun and Moon!

The gains from this battle had been immense. He had been resting here for nearly half a day and was still caught in the dizzying, profound rhythm of the Dao. He had no choice but to keep his eyes closed.

'Qi Lanyan, a direct disciple of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao with three divine abilities... Helian Wujiang, the ruler of the Tiefu Kingdom, also with three divine abilities... just these two alone represent an unprecedented harvest. Compared to them, Bashan was merely a bonus.'

Although the power levels Chen Yin had outlined years ago were imprecise, with heaven-and-earth differences between each level that grew to absurd proportions later on, it could not diminish the sheer scale of his current gains.

His Dao-Profundity had long since crossed the Purple Mystery threshold—a chasm in the eyes of the world—and surpassed that of ordinary Great Daoist Masters. By Li Zhouwei's own estimation, he had far exceeded most of the cultivators on the lake. Figures like Touba Ci and Gongsun Bei were left far behind in his dust. Even based on his brief exchange in battle, a disciple from a major sect like Qi Lanyan was a notch below him.

At this level, the number of cultivators in Jiangnan whose Dao-Profundity surpassed his could be counted on one hand.

His peers would have to be Great Daoist Masters from Golden Core Dao Lineages like Changxiao or Chi Buzi, or perhaps figures from legacies like Penglai.

'So this is what it means to be a Great Daoist Master... but I've fought too few of them. I've never crossed swords with Chi Buzi or Changxiao, the examples Chen Yin gave me, and they wouldn't have remained stagnant. It's hard to gauge the gap between us...'

The immediate effect, however, was a significant increase in the power of his many spell arts and a more natural flow in the operation of his Spiritual Artifacts. And, of course—the divine abilities in his body.

The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass at his brow glowed faintly. The light of the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' circulated with greater freedom and brilliance. A dark world manifested, but it did not expand, remaining tightly contained within three inches of his body. A setting sun, golden and crimson, hung behind him.

The suppression of the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' had become more effective and subtle. Li Zhouwei breathed a sigh of relief and slowly closed his eyes, sensing the profound Daoist rhythms continuously welling up in his mind. The world before him seemed to be slowly lifting a veil, becoming ever clearer. Yet when he looked within, the calamity inside his body appeared even more complex.

When Li Zhouwei had arrived, Li Ximing, hearing he was injured, had rushed over immediately. With Li Ximing's skill in the Dao of alchemy, he could devise a solution for most injuries as long as there was a breath of life left. But faced with this calamity, he was helpless.

Ultimately, it wasn't like an injury at all. It was more like a kind of resonance, a catastrophic fate that had descended upon his body, constantly generating destructive Wu Light, seemingly without end.

'A little over a day left.'

He had pacified the north and then rushed back here. As long as he could stabilize himself and suppress the calamity within his body, he could temporarily halt the increase in its power...

'In that case, I just need to suppress my injuries here and wait for Yang Ruiyi to set up the northern defense line and withdraw the army. There should be more than enough time...'

Li Zhouwei exhaled and opened the jade box. Looking at the gleaming piece of Horn Wood resting inside, he felt a strange emotion.

'Truly worthy of being called the Flawless Wu Earth. The tenacity of this calamity is ranked among the highest in the world. Even someone as esteemed as the Song Emperor has no perfect solution and can only choose the best of the lesser options, offering a piece of Horn Wood.'

But something was better than nothing. A spiritual item like Horn Wood was precious. It would have to be given to Li Ximing to maximize its effectiveness. He put it away for now and raised an eyebrow slightly, his gaze drifting toward the hall's window.

The colors in the distance were dim and heavy, but he could still see the jade-white radiance continuously falling, reflecting the multicolored light in his own eyes. King Wei's lips moved.

'Cut from the same cloth.'
