# Chapter 1182: Registered

Li Que'wan and Li Ximing emerged from the grotto-heaven together, riding the wind away from the Purple Mansion's grand array. After activating a Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure, they descended toward the mountains. There, they saw the two bizarrely shaped Underworld emissaries waiting for them. One was squatting on a jade pillar, staring at an alchemical cauldron; the other lay sprawled in a patch of flowers, yawning endlessly in a state of utter boredom.

The two emissaries were truly hideous. Their bodies were pitch-black, devoid of any pure energy, making them look for all the world like a pair of demons. Their expressions, however, were surprisingly animated. Upon spotting Li Ximing and his companion, the horned one immediately shot to his feet.

"Esteemed Daoist Masters, you certainly took your time!"

These two were old acquaintances, both confidants of the Yang family. Li Ximing clasped his hands in response.

"After passing through the crucible of life and death, there were some private matters to discuss. My apologies for keeping you waiting."

"Not at all, not at all."

The horned creature clutched the massive brush in his hand and grinned.

"The members of your noble clan are all prodigies. I'd be happy to make a dozen more trips like this! What's a little waiting? I consider it an opportunity to admire these immortal mountains!"

He then turned his head, his gaze landing on Li Que'wan with fervent enthusiasm.

"I heard long ago that the gold and mercury were stirring and that Pit Water and Radiant Fire were in flux. I knew a fellow cultivator was on the verge of a breakthrough! I even made a wager with those poor souls who died unjustly down below, and it seems I was right. Congratulations! May your alchemical works culminate in the perfect pill, your heart remain true, and your name ascend to the immortal registers for a thousand years of prosperity."

Li Que'wan offered her polite thanks. Wang Long chuckled, attempting to build rapport.

"Cultivators of the Whole Pill Dao used to be frequent clients of mine. Back then, they would often carry vessels for the Lower Rite into the Underworld to gather energy. I knew quite a few of them. Although times have changed, I hope you'll look out for me."

Beside him, Zhang Gui stood with a simple expression, silent, just holding his book and waiting. Wang Long, however, was exceptionally talkative. After a moment of careful observation, he exclaimed in praise,

"It's the 'Awaiting the Supreme Divine' path... truly marvelous."

Though these figures from the Underworld lacked great divine abilities, their eyes were exceptionally sharp. After a single glance, Wang Long lifted his brush, let out a sly chuckle, and said,

"I've heard of King Wei's tremendous accomplishments. The Underworld is in an uproar; all the ghosts and spectral judges are discussing it. Some of the long-dead from the old Wei-Li line are even running through the capital city, spreading the news. It's quite a scene."

Li Ximing was rather surprised, even a little awkward, and didn't know how to reply. He simply folded his sleeves and shook his head, glancing over at Zhang Gui. The simple-looking ghost kept his head down, flipping through the scroll in his hands. After a long moment, he looked up and shot a subtle glance at Wang Long.

Wang Long, in the middle of his friendly chatter, caught the look and shook his head, glaring back with raised eyebrows.

'How many times has it been? If we can't find a name, we'll just write it in ourselves. Do we really need to find someone to hold us accountable?'

How could the two from the Li clan fail to understand the exchange of looks between the two ghosts?

'They must be unable to find her name again.'

Li Que'wan had no great destiny attached to her, nor did she have her breakthrough over the lake. It was almost certainly the influence of the Talisman Seed. To ease the awkwardness, Li Ximing immediately smiled.

"This is the second time we've had to trouble you two to register a name only after we've returned to the mainland. Does this mean the lands overseas are not under your jurisdiction?"

This made the two ghosts laugh. After exchanging a look, Zhang Gui spoke slowly.

"You misunderstand, fellow Daoist. It's not that the overseas territories aren't under the Underworld's authority. Be it the Yuandao or the Tianwan, we keep them all in mind. It's simply that for those overseas, there is no need for us to make a personal trip. We just make a note in the scrolls; there's no need to inform them. Only when we can't find someone in the registers do we investigate their background..."

"When a Daoist Master from a noble clan returns to the mainland and establishes their Dao here, either by transmitting profound teachings or receiving an immortal mandate, then we must pay a visit to show our respect. Of course, some of the great Daoist traditions overseas are quite prestigious and have dedicated personnel in the Underworld to handle their affairs!"

Li Ximing finally understood.

'So, their willingness to come register a name is actually a sign of respect!'

Having clarified the matter, Wang Long's expression turned serious as he recited the customary, authoritative question:

"State your name!"

Li Que'wan's voice was soft.

"Li Que'wan of the Li clan. The 'Que' of a celestial palace's gates, the 'Wan' of reconciliation."

The moment she spoke, ink surged from the tip of the massive brush, which was as large as a spring-powered pestle. Wang Long lifted it and added her name to the register. After a long moment, he bowed, then changed the subject with a smile.

"Actually, there is a small favor I'd like to ask of you, Daoist Master."

"Please, speak freely," Li Ximing replied, slightly surprised.

Wang Long looked embarrassed.

"I am aware that King Wei's eldest son has already attained the Dao and should be recorded in my register. However, your clan is too revered and its ways too profound for us to investigate. There was no celestial phenomenon, no name appeared on any list, and the gates to the Underworld refuse to open for him... so we could only wait."

"Now that a Whole Pill cultivator from your clan has achieved the Dao, I was hoping you might do me the favor of letting me add his name as well, so that I may report back to my superiors."

'So this is about Jiangqian... I hadn't even had a chance to ask, and he brought it up himself!'

The boons from the Chunyi Dao Gate had been immense. He had received the Vast Desert Li Flame, and given Li Jiangqian's refinement speed, he had likely mastered it long ago and already consumed the Radiant Si Apricot Fruit. When Li Que'wan had first returned, Li Ximing had activated a jade talisman in his sleeve to contact him but had received no reply. He was clearly at a critical stage of refinement.

This was turning into a complication. Li Ximing sighed.

"It is truly unfortunate timing. Changli is in seclusion cultivating a secret art and cannot easily show himself. Is it possible for me to register him on his behalf?"

Wang Long looked both awkward and hesitant.

"Normally, a wisp of his aura would suffice, but the lake is protected by a powerful treasure. He must answer in person, or this brush will not produce any ink... Never mind, never mind. We will simply come again next time!"

"Thank you for your understanding, emissary."

The promise of a "next time" was reassuring, and it brought a knowing smile to Li Ximing's face. Still, it was the first time he had seen the emissaries in such a bind. He retrieved a jade box from his sleeve and casually handed it over. Wang Long accepted it with a familiar ease and smiled.

"My lord's abilities are truly great, to be able to acquire even golden texts. It seems your relationship with the Golden Feather is excellent indeed. We won't trouble you any further. We wish you all success!"

With that, they spun on the spot and dissipated like smoke. Li Ximing, however, remained, pondering Wang Long's words. He turned to Li Que'wan and saw that she, too, wore an expression deep in thought.

---

The two returned to the Purple Mansion's grand array in silence. Li Que'wan spoke with concern.

"This junior believes it would be best to inform the Golden Feather about my breakthrough. If the timing is right, a personal visit would be even better..."

Li Ximing sighed and nodded.

"I understand... Wang Long might have his eye on the Metallic Essence, or perhaps he's trying to earn some goodwill for the future. He clearly favors our family, and that was his way of reminding us... The problem is, he isn't sure if someone backing our family has already reached an accord with the Golden Oneness... so he couldn't speak plainly."

"Think of how the Xinggong Terrace in the Western Sea was left with only a single, heavily injured Dao Mian. That is a lesson we must heed. Even with the protection of the Bright Yang, we must at least send a letter."

"As for a personal visit... we are technically of two different domains now. They are a True Monarch's Dao Lineage and can come and go as they please, but it is not so suitable for us."

Li Que'wan nodded gravely. Li Ximing entered the main hall and retrieved an object from his sleeve. Changing the subject, he smiled.

"Here, take a look... What do you think this is?"

Li Que'wan started, her eyes fixed on the silver pill with crimson patterns resting in his palm. She felt a resonance deep within her life-mandate, a call from her divine ability. A powerful impulse surged through her, setting her heart ablaze.

"A Spiritual Treasure?!" she asked, stunned.

"Hahaha!"

Li Ximing laughed, a mix of joy and wistfulness in his tone.

"When I reached the Purple Mansion Realm, my eyes would light up at the sight of a single measure of spiritual resources. Now, in your generation, you are gifted a Spiritual Treasure the moment you ascend... How things have changed!"

It was a casual remark, but Li Que'wan took it to heart. Her eyes reddened with emotion as she cradled the infinitely profound Spiritual Treasure, filled with an eager desire to refine it at once. Still, she spoke with reverence.

"Without King Wei and yourself, Daoist Master, there would be no Suyun today. This junior will not betray your faith!"

Li Ximing smiled and waved his hand, his expression turning serious.

"Refine this first and see what marvels it holds. As for your Talisman Qi... it now contains a mystic tiger."

"However..." he hesitated. "This Mystic Tablet Edict Pill has the effect of commanding spirits. We have yet to determine the extent of its power, its limitations, and whether it can be used to control this tiger. Furthermore... we just refined your brother's Azure Talisman with great fanfare, attracting a lot of attention. It would be unwise to let anyone draw connections... For now, prioritize refining the Spiritual Treasure."

The moment she had emerged from seclusion, the clan had a Purple Mansion realm demon beast ready for her. She hadn't even had time to familiarize herself with the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron in her hands, a cauldron that currently held a most peculiar spiritual water!

Cultivators of the Bright Yang and Radiant Fire Dao, like Li Ximing and Li Jiangqian, could refine spiritual flames. It was only natural that cultivators of the Veiled Yin and Pit Water Dao could refine spiritual waters. Her own Whole Pill Dao was one of the few that regulated both water and fire; aside from Converging Water and Merging Fire, she could refine all others!

Now, she held a Spiritual Treasure. With so many benefits yet to be assimilated, she was like a prospector sitting atop a mountain of treasure. Her heart swelled with anticipation.

"Leave it to me!"

Li Ximing said no more. He sent her off to refine the Spiritual Treasure and finally let out a sigh of relief. Returning to his cauldron, he prepared the spiritual resources and tossed in the portion of Treasurefall Water, his mind filled with calculations.

'Refining a Spiritual Treasure takes time, but there will be breaks. This cauldron of Horn Wood pills will take two or three years to complete. It won't be too late to think about eradicating that calamity then... If these next few years go smoothly, I should have several portions of Profound Minister Moon Essence by then.'

---

While the Li clan lay low on their island, digesting the spoils of the north-south conflict, the two ghosts who had departed flew on dejectedly, constantly glancing back. Wang Long was deeply troubled.

"The superiors specifically instructed us to get that other name recorded. How are we supposed to explain this when we get back?"

Zhang Gui shook his head and said in his simple tone,

"It'll just be a few harsh words. The blame doesn't lie with us. It's not as if they can demote and execute us for it!"

He was quite composed, but Wang Long was frustrated by his attitude.

"You're used to it. I finally managed to catch the eye of a few of the higher-ups. A promotion was within my grasp! This failure might just ruin my prospects!"

Wang Long grumbled on, regretting that he hadn't been more forceful. Zhang Gui listened in his usual foolish silence. The two of them seemed to be using some wondrous art, for they traveled at incredible speed. Soon, they reached the Grave Abyss and plunged into its oppressive gloom, where a bone-chilling wail soon began to echo.

The sound was sharp and piercing, as mournful as a specter's cry, reverberating endlessly through the abyss. The two ghosts were long accustomed to it and paid it no mind. One continued to complain while the other remained silent. They traveled on until an infinite darkness descended, and a crimson hue seeped through a sky as thick as layered storm clouds. Only then did they see a figure.

The man was tall and reed-thin, his form withered and his face twisted like a bamboo pole. A long, white talisman was plastered to his face, bearing two golden words:

[Supreme Lower Rite Nature].

Seeing this person, Wang Long reacted as if he'd met a dear friend. He grabbed the man's desiccated hand and launched into a rambling complaint before hesitating.

"I've heard the Yang and Li clans are on good terms. Perhaps I should just cover this up for now and report to my superior first?"

The other emissary shot him a look and said icily, "Whether or not a task assigned to you by the higher-ups can be completed is already determined by fate. Why worry? Report it as you must. Merit or punishment, what is yours is yours. You cannot escape it."

Wang Long pleaded for a while longer, but seeing the other was unmoved, he asked,

"Where are you headed, big brother?"

The dry, shriveled face finally showed a flicker of emotion. The ghost squeezed out a smile that looked more like a grimace.

"A Daoist Master in the Eastern Sea is about to pass on. His Dao Lineage is a mixed bag—he cultivated the Wu Earth Virtue but also dabbled in the 'Eastern Feather Mountain'. The domain of the Capital Guard is rife with mountain ghosts and monsters, and with Wu Earth involved, it can't be ignored. It's in my jurisdiction, so I have to oversee it."

He added, "It's a rotten job. Thankless, profitless, and a complete waste of time."

Wang Long looked at him with pity, then noticed a porcelain bowl in his other hand filled with murky water. His expression changed, and he sighed.

"You... did that fellow Cui run into you?"

The tall, thin ghost's face was stiff.

"Cui E is always there, guarding the gates of the Underworld," he said faintly. "The moment the death gate opens, he kneels before it, listening to the wretched screams from beyond while waiting desperately for an emissary to pass. He hopes someone will take this bowl of 'River of Wrongful Life Water' to his Prince of Wei for just a sip, to ease his pain and grant him a moment's peace."

"He spends twenty years of his spectral existence refining each bowl of that water. It's why he remains a wrongfully dead soul, yet he never seems to tire."

Wang Long sighed and glanced at the bowl, offering a tactful reminder.

"That's a bowl of foul water."

The ghost emissary shook his head, the white talisman on his face fluttering. He turned his hand over, and the murky river water cascaded from the bowl's rim, transforming into a roaring, white-capped river that crashed into the darkness below.

Twenty years of Cui E's spectral effort vanished in an instant, lost to the gloom for nothing. The ghost emissary's voice was like ice.

"Myself, our few soft-hearted colleagues... we all pour it out the moment we're out of sight. No one dares go near that Prince of Wei. We just show Cui E the empty bowl when we return to give him some small comfort."

Wang Long fell silent. The tall ghost continued.

"I see how you fawn over them, one moment 'Bright Yang,' the next 'Whole Pill.' You think even a wrecked ship has a few good nails left? You hope to leech some merit, catch a True Monarch's eye, find yourself a patron for a future promotion? Is that it?"

Wang Long was speechless. After a long pause, he admitted,

"I didn't at first, but after seeing that Whole Pill cultivator today, I thought she might ride the winds of fortune into an Auxiliary Position... I see my petty schemes are an open book to you, old brother..."

His words were met with a cold laugh.

"Let me ask you," the tall ghost said, "if the Bright Yang fails, will the Li clan be slaughtered or not? Will that imperial bloodline be extinguished? Golden Oneness may think the chance of a Whole Pill gaining an Auxiliary Position is a good thing, but will certain people on the mountain ever let her embark on the Quest for Gold?"

"Those you so diligently court are prominent now, but a hundred years pass in the blink of an eye. When their story is over, I fear your Radiant Fire will become the next Prince of Wei, and your Whole Pill will become the next Cui E."
