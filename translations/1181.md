# Chapter 1181: Suyun

Hearing the gravity in his tone, Li Que'wan knew this was an urgent matter. She took the jade slip and closed her eyes to read its contents. Within moments, her expression grew solemn, her eyes glinting with a strange light as she asked doubtfully, "The Intercalary Sun Art?"

"It's the counterpart to that art. You could call it the Art of Demoting Yin!"

Li Zhouwei, who had been listening for a while, finally spoke up. He recounted what he had learned from Li Suining about the Six Elucidations, explaining it clearly for the two of them. Li Ximing then shared his own idea of expelling yin to acquire spiritual resources, a concept that stunned Li Que'wan into silence.

The woman pondered for a breath, her eyes shining brightly.

"Senior's method is truly unconventional. Even as a cultivator of the Whole Pill path, I never would have thought of such a thing. But after careful consideration, it has great potential!"

She didn't waste words. Raising a hand, she accepted the jade box from Li Ximing and drew out a measure of brilliant Supreme Yin Moon Radiance, locking it in her palm before producing a small cauldron.

The cauldron was not as large as an alchemy furnace, fitting neatly in her hand, but it was exquisitely crafted. Li Que'wan had commissioned it during her Foundation Establishment Realm, using materials from the family's stores, and it possessed its own unique qualities.

First, she drew upon the Spiritual Qi within the grotto-heaven, pouring it into the cauldron until its Profound Patterns lit up, suffusing it with a radiant divine ability. She then selected one or two cool, yin-aspected spiritual items suitable for the Foundation Establishment Realm. For a long while, she manipulated water and fire, observed the balance of yin and yang, and compounded the materials, until finally, a bright moonlight shone from within the vessel.

Li Ximing was mesmerized by the countless complex mudras she formed, sighing inwardly.

'These strange arts really are best left to those with specialized divine abilities. If I tried to study this myself, I could waste a year or two and not even grasp the basics. I doubt I'd have even a ten or twenty percent chance of producing a single successful batch!'

This wasn't an exaggeration of his own slowness. Even a master like Dao Mian, a cultivator of the Whole Pill path, had spent a great deal of time using a Spiritual Artifact, the Verdant Profound Sarcophagus, to refine the Profound Coffin Crimson Water for the Li family. It had taken him until the third year to finally deliver the finished product.

Of course, for other cultivators, spending even ten years to convert useless spiritual materials into useful ones was a worthwhile endeavor, something many would desperately seek. But the Li family needed a continuous, flowing production, so they couldn't afford to wait.

Li Ximing watched with anticipation. Soon, the gentle moonlight within Li Que'wan's small cauldron gradually faded, sealed entirely within the vessel. The woman inspected it carefully, and seeing no issues, she handed it over.

Li Ximing looked at her in disbelief.

"How long did that take… a dozen breaths?"

"It's not quite that fast…" Li Que'wan's expression was a mixture of joy and worry.

"There's good news, but also a problem…"

She parted her lips. "The conversion has two stages. The first is the harmonization I just performed. An ordinary Whole Pill cultivator would need to spend at least three or four months on it, carefully managing every step. But with the grotto-heaven's energy to bypass the initial balancing, and with the harmonizing techniques of the Shamanic Talisman Dao, it really only takes a dozen breaths…"

"The second step is nurturing. This art is extremely sophisticated, and since this is my first time using it, I'm not yet proficient. I estimate this cauldron has a seventy percent chance of success at best… The bigger problem is that this batch… must be nurtured by my divine ability for a full year."

She called it a problem, but to Li Ximing's ears, the first part sounded like wonderful news. Only the latter part made him frown. He shook his head.

"That is indeed a problem… A year in exchange for spiritual resources isn't a loss, but your time is precious. How can it be wasted on this?"

His high hopes evaporated, leaving a bittersweet feeling in his heart. He could only sigh.

'I suppose I was being too optimistic!'

His words seemed to startle Li Que'wan. A faint smile graced her lips.

"Daoist Master, you misunderstand. This isn't like the Feather Transformation Pool for incubating Neck Feathers, where there's only one pool… This cauldron may be precious to a Foundation Establishment cultivator, but for our family, it's nothing special!"

Her smile didn't annoy Li Ximing; instead, it brought him a flash of joyous realization. He watched as Li Que'wan raised her brow and said humbly,

"This is fundamentally a process of Spiritual Qi. The harmonization doesn't take much time. My Awaiting the Supreme Divine is skilled in the Dao of nurturing material properties. While nurturing twenty at once might be a stretch, five or six is certainly possible. If I were to carve a shamanic array beforehand, I could even manage eight or nine."

Li Ximing's face lit up instantly.

"It was the Feather Transformation Pool that had me stuck! I didn't think of it that way!"

Li Que'wan nodded in agreement.

"For now, it's eight or nine cauldrons. Once I've cultivated a few more divine abilities and can truly set aside a year for this, what's to stop me from managing twenty or thirty!"

"Even in the worst case, refining a few cauldrons without it affecting my cultivation is still an excellent method. Just like this one—I can nurture it while I cultivate, and it won't slow me down much at all!"

The thought of eight or nine cauldrons had already made Li Ximing ecstatic; the prospect of twenty or thirty was almost too good to be true! His joy was overshadowed by shock. He shook his head and sighed,

"The Whole Pill path may not excel in combat, but this Dao of material transformation… it practically looks down upon all other divine ability cultivators!"

Seeing the old and the young so overjoyed, Li Zhouwei smiled as well and interjected,

"We should still wait a while to see the quality and quantity of this Profound Minister Moon Essence. Only then can we say for certain that this path is truly viable."

Li Ximing nodded in agreement, though in his heart he was already eighty to ninety percent sure of their success; Li Zhouwei was just being cautious. He held the cauldron as if it were a priceless treasure before returning it to the young woman's hands.

"We'll have someone forge more of these small cauldrons," he said seriously. "Better yet, we should acquire a proper Spiritual Artifact cauldron for you, something you can keep on hand to practice the Dao of material transformation."

"I have another, more important treasure I need to entrust to you for transformation, and I fear a lesser vessel might damage it!"

He was, of course, referring to the Final-Tower Sinking Primal. After all, spiritual resources alone were not enough; it would be best if they could also extract some Supreme Yin spiritual items. Hearing this, Li Zhouwei smiled.

"Grand-Uncle, your words aren't quite right. With Awaiting the Supreme Divine, a cauldron of the Whole Pill path isn't necessary. The solution isn't far away; it's right before your eyes."

Li Ximing paused, then slapped his forehead. He immediately reached into his sleeve, and a small, emerald-green jade cauldron appeared in his palm.

It was the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron!

This Spiritual Artifact was quite peculiar. Dao Mian had described it as 'a treasure of Gathering Wood, yet possessing the efficacy of the Whole Pill.'

His admiration had been plain to see. In the end, it had been sent back along with the Profound Coffin Crimson Water, and both were now in Li Ximing's possession.

As expected, the moment Li Que'wan laid eyes on it, her own eyes began to sparkle. Li Ximing didn't keep her in suspense, cleanly transferring ownership and letting her take it.

The moment she did, the silvery, mercury-like light in her palm flared, seeping into the cauldron's patterns. An aura of vibrant, all-encompassing profundity immediately emanated from it.

"A fine Profound Cauldron!" Li Que'wan praised.

With the enhancement from Awaiting the Supreme Divine, this artifact would serve Li Que'wan well until she reached the realm of Purple Mystery. Li Ximing, having unexpectedly saved a major expense, couldn't help but smile.

But just then, a jade talisman at his waist flashed, and his expression shifted. His figure vanished from the grotto-heaven. A moment later, he reappeared before Li Que'wan's worried gaze.

His expression was one of slight exasperation.

"My subordinates report that two emissaries from the Underworld are waiting on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. They're here for Que'wan, to register her name."

"They certainly arrived quickly," Li Que'wan remarked.

Despite his exasperation, Li Ximing had a hint of a smile.

"The Underworld's emissaries also know how to treat people according to their status. I've heard that when they visit other mountain sects, they just swagger right through their grand arrays without much courtesy. Toward our family, however, they show a measure of respect."

"They don't dare to get entangled in karma," Li Zhouwei answered. "When I had my breakthrough overseas, the Underworld emissaries only sought me out after I had returned to the lake. It seems to be their standard procedure. It shows that while the Underworld's reach is long, they only register figures from the mainland. Your Spiritual Treasure is excellent, but it can't compare to the Azure Insight Origin Mirror; you can't hide from the Underworld's methods…"

"Besides, the Nine Mounds are likely within their sight as well."

At this point, a hint of doubt entered Li Zhouwei's expression.

"However… the matter with Jiangqian managed to fool the Underworld. Although they eventually found out after we made our move, several months have passed, and still no emissary has come for him. This is something worth asking about."

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly. Li Que'wan, however, was thinking of something else. She hesitated for a moment.

"Since I am to be registered, I should have a title."

Hearing this, the Daoist Master beside her turned his head and smiled.

"Your brother chose a fine name, Chang, incorporating the Li trigram. It has an excellent meaning. What do you think?"

Li Zhouwei, however, shook his head decisively, cutting in.

"I've said it before. Since our family has generational names, there's no need to follow the Daoist ranking. Choose your own; you don't need to emulate him."

Li Que'wan added, "The Whole Pill path places great importance on imagery. As I mentioned before, I cannot wield the authority of yin and yang. The character 'Chang' is too fierce; I fear it would overwhelm me."

Their words left Li Ximing feeling a little shaken, and he didn't press the matter. Li Que'wan smiled.

"I cultivate the Golden Book of Divine Attendance. The author of this book possessed vast divine abilities but left no name. The text is incomplete, as if it were a private gift to a loved one. At the very end of the book, there is a song."

"Alas, the seekers of Gold in the mortal world,
A thousand wonders, myriad paths, all in discord.
Only in reversal is harmony restored.
Mercury from the sun's pure essence must be drawn,
Lead from the moon's bright radiance at dawn.
Kan and Li, Kan and Li! Water and fire, not in strife, know no breach.
Within the coffin of bone lies the true life-mandate's reach,
Divinity is held within a plain heart, this I teach.
My dear, a hair's breadth of deviation, and the Monarch's throne you'll never reach!"

A complex look entered her eyes.

"The line 'Divinity is held within a plain heart' is the core principle of Awaiting the Supreme Divine—to harmonize the feminine and masculine, to perfect the yin while awaiting the yang. I shall take my name from this. Let me be called Suyun."

"Suyun…" Li Ximing mulled it over and nodded.

Li Zhouwei, however, smiled faintly and murmured,

"A hair's breadth of deviation, and the Monarch's throne you'll never reach. Excellent…" He looked up, shaking his head slightly. "You've chosen a good Daoist name. Go."

As he watched the two of them depart, Li Zhouwei let out a long breath, much of the pressure lifting from his brow. He stood and walked up the floors of the pavilion.

The spiritual energy was rich and mellow. Sun and moon shared the same sky, and ethereal white mist drifted past the windowsills. The small, bronze-like stone platform came into view again, the purplish-black wooden slip inlaid upon it, its golden characters shining brilliantly.

He reached out and tapped it lightly. A line of numbers materialized.

'Seven hundred and seventy-six immortal merit!'

The amount of immortal merit in the High Firmament Pavilion had increased by nearly six hundred, reaching an unprecedented peak!

The Li family had gained the most from the great battle. The Merciful One had suffered injuries and casualties, which should have accounted for two or three kills, worth eighty or ninety immortal merit based on past experience. Among the Maha, even though Lingmei had killed one of their own first, Li Zhouwei had still slain Bashan and heavily wounded another, netting at least a hundred immortal merit.

'Even subtracting those two, that still leaves over four hundred immortal merit… from Qi Lanyan and Helian Wujiang…'

But Li Zhouwei felt something was off.

Calculating the merit from Qi Lanyan and Helian Wujiang was far more difficult. In his view, although Qi Lanyan's divine abilities were greater, the merit gained from him shouldn't have been much more than that from Helian Wujiang.

'The requirement for gaining immortal merit is to offer sacrifices to demons, eliminate devils, and suppress heterodox Daos… Qi Lanyan is, by all accounts, an orthodox cultivator from a distinguished background. He was suffused with a pure light, showing no demonic aura…'

'An ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator is worth fifty or sixty. Back then, Vast Cicada, as the master of a blessed land, was far beyond a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator and was worth over two hundred. Helian Wujiang couldn't possibly be worth that much. One hundred and fifty would be a generous estimate…'

'There must be another source… offer sacrifices to demons, eliminate devils, and suppress heterodox Daos…'

A thought stirred in his mind.

'Sacrifices to demons… the sacrificial Azure Talisman! That strand of Purple Mansion Talisman Qi should also increase immortal merit!'

This was a pleasant surprise, and one that would be easy to verify. Li Que'wan was about to receive her talisman. Whether it granted merit or not, he would know simply by checking the pavilion afterward. He made a mental note of it, glancing at the golden characters on the purplish-black bamboo slip with satisfaction.

'With seven hundred immortal merit on hand, I'll have plenty of leeway for a long time!'

Li Que'wan's Awaiting the Supreme Divine had solved a major problem for the Li clan. Li Ximing was overjoyed, and Li Zhouwei was even more invested, his mind brimming with new ideas.

'Que'wan's divine ability, while it grows differently from Jiangqian's continuous enhancement of his life-mandate connection and may not increase her combat strength significantly, offers a comprehensive improvement to the entire family.'

'The Whole Pill path is known for its rare and difficult top-tier Dao Lineages precisely because it is founded on the application of profound mysteries. The gap between higher and lower mysteries far exceeds that of other lineages. Among all the Dao lineages in the world, there is no other divine ability that can bring about such a qualitative leap for an entire Immortal Sect or Immortal Clan…'

'Her divine ability and Dao Lineage are worthy of being ranked at the very top. And what our family lacks least are legacies! I must find the absolute best for her!'

King Wei immediately reached out and tapped the wooden slip. The bright characters began to flow rapidly, revealing line after line of dense, moving text.

Among the arts of the Whole Pill path, aside from the Golden Book of Divine Attendance, the most supreme lineage was a scripture called the Chapter on Fusing Mercury, Returning to Lead, and Restoring the Life-Mandate!

The High Firmament Pavilion contained mostly ancient arts, the majority of which were unranked. Li Zhouwei was no expert in the Whole Pill path; the only reason he could identify this as a top-tier lineage was its price—a staggering two hundred and ninety-one immortal merit, far more expensive than even his own Myriad Chariots Annihilating Radiance Emperor Scripture!

Yet Li Zhouwei wasn't concerned in the slightest. In fact, he found it a pity.

'It's a shame this is the only one in such a high price range…'

There were many Whole Pill Dao Lineages in the High Firmament Pavilion, including the Art of Water and Fire's Mutual Engagement and the Art of Profound Mercury Seeking Lead… but they were all priced around one hundred immortal merit. Apart from the Chapter on Fusing Mercury, Returning to Lead, and Restoring the Life-Mandate, the most expensive, The Wondrous Art of Azure-Gold Trust, was just over one hundred and ninety.

'What's even more of a pity… is that there are no others that end with the title "Golden Book"…'

'According to the Nine Mounds, there are at least fourteen Golden Books. It's impossible that only one belongs to the Whole Pill path. There must be two, or even more. The lineage must still exist somewhere in the world, and the most likely suspect… is the Golden Feather Sect…'

That Daoist Master Qiushui had been in seclusion for a long time, rumored to be cultivating the so-called Dao of Mercury Transformation. Now, having heard about the divine corpse method of Li Que'wan's Awaiting the Supreme Divine, how could Li Zhouwei not be suspicious?

'Her divine ability will advance faster after receiving the talisman. The Chapter on Fusing Mercury, Returning to Lead, and Restoring the Life-Mandate will only be sufficient for a time. Sooner or later, I will have to negotiate with the Golden Feather Sect…'
