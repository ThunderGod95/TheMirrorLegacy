# Chapter 1091: Counter-Calculation

Li Ximing slowly emerged from his meditative state. The golden-eyed youth was already sitting in his seat, one hand raised, the other resting on his opposite wrist, lightly turning the Pure Yang Bracelets. Seeing Li Ximing finally awaken, he relaxed his hand, and his gold-patterned black robes fell, completely concealing his wrist.

Li Ximing felt as if he were waking from a dream. There was a film of cold sweat on the back of his neck, yet his mind felt incredibly clear and refreshed.

"I understand..." he said, his voice brimming with discovery. "So that was the key! So that's how it is! That's how it is!"

"I obtained Cui E's Radiant Qilin Refining Art and the six Bright Yang pill arts. I studied them one by one... but the Fading Sun Armor-Break Pill, the one that follows the path of evasion, always felt awkward and clumsy. It turns out its true application is here..."

His eyes were bright, his mind overflowing with new thoughts. He muttered to himself, pacing anxiously around the hall for two steps before continuing.

"And the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body... If an aspect of yin is placed upon it, it could greatly reduce the risks faced during reincarnation and the recreation of a new body!"

Li Zhouwei listened to it all, then smiled.

"The Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body? When I saw you arrive, Grand-Uncle, your body had a heavy shadow, and your life-mandate was incomplete. So you were using an external object to preserve your life-mandate!"

Li Ximing gave a bitter smile.

"Your eyes are sharp. Just before I returned to the lake, I was beaten into a pathetic state by Helian Wumeng. His divine ability has grown, and he swallowed some unknown iron pill. Even my Merging Fire couldn't burn him!"

He very naturally took a small figurine, carved from mulberry wood, from his sleeve and handed it to Li Zhouwei, letting the youth inspect it closely.

"This is rather interesting."

Li Zhouwei studied it for a moment, then couldn't help but offer a warning.

"Grand-Uncle, you must be extremely careful. Whatever you do, never let Merging Fire burn this. This kind of thing damages one's essence and harms the life-mandate. Worse, it is bound to wood, which means the harm will be magnified exponentially. It will truly be fatal."

He then changed the subject.

"You were in meditation for nine days, Grand-Uncle. Aunt Minggong came by once but was blocked outside the hall by your divine ability."

Li Ximing finally understood. He flicked his sleeve and sighed.

"I know what it's about... It's just Yang Ruiyi looking for me again. He's in a hurry to use you!"

"Oh?" Li Zhouwei asked, intrigued.

"You've been in secluded cultivation for these past few years," Li Ximing said, "but the north's movements have become increasingly urgent. The chaos in Jiangbei back then was a great humiliation for Mount Dayang, and it also made Western Shu red-eyed with envy..."

"As time has passed, not only have the figures from the Profound Governance Pavilion thrown all their forces into the fight, but the stakes Mount Dayang has on the table have also grown heavier and heavier... What's more troublesome is that Qing Jifang still isn't satisfied after taking Xiaoshi. He's deployed men to the Great Western Plateau, forcing Profound Governance to pull its forces out of the Long region one by one, which now threatens Tangdao Mountain!"

Li Ximing's brows were tightly furrowed, clearly under immense pressure himself.

"There's one more point, and it's an extremely fatal one. The current Liangli of the Great Desire Dao is Tian Langzhi. His strength is terrifying, far beyond that of Vast Cicada."

"That beast was pursued by True Monarch Shangyuan with a sword until he had no path left. Not only was his Dharma body destroyed, he nearly lost his life-mandate. He was forced to swear an oath under the mediation of a great figure from the north that he would never advance south. But now, the Great Song has pushed deep into Jiangbei, even crossing the mountains and approaching the Central Plains. We don't know the exact wording of the oath, but it's highly likely he's now free to act."

"Because of this, Situ Huo dares not leave the mountain even more. He can only defend it day after day. The situation has deteriorated to the point where the northerners have bypassed the mountain and struck at the river, right across from the Wilderness. Although the White River hasn't been lost, Jiangxia was badly wounded."

The eastern part of Jiangbei, which included areas like Chengshui Marsh, had never been fully reclaimed in the first place, so it wasn't surprising that a retreat would easily push them back to the river. After hearing all this, Li Zhouwei looked doubtful.

"If the northern line is so tight, how did you have time to come back, Grand-Uncle?"

Li Ximing sighed.

"I didn't... Not only that, but the south specifically requested mediators. Jiangxia and Cheng Qian were both transferred to the north. Jianglong and Yang Ruizao were also temporarily pulled to Holder of the Profound to help watch the riverbank. Almost eighty percent of the Great Song's entire military strength is pressed against both sides of that river."

"The border I guard isn't considered the front line, but it was still breached several times by Helian Wumeng and his men. My Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body is perfectly suited to absorbing his spell arts, which is why I look mostly fine... I just... injured my Dharma body a little..."

"The reason I was able to return... is because General Yang personally summoned me to come and ask you to emerge from seclusion!"

Although in the eyes of the public, Li Zhouwei was still at the second divine ability level, the current him, armed to the teeth, was in no way inferior to an ordinary mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. He was also an extremely important target for the enemy, making him exceptionally useful.

Li Zhouwei pondered this for a long time before asking,

"This Situ Huo... what kind of person is he?"

Li Ximing hesitated for a breath before answering.

"Yang Ruiyi values him highly. He selected and promoted several people from the remnants Situ Huo found. The old bastard is a cunning and despicable sort. Yang Ruiyi having him defend Tangdao was the right call... It's just... Ning Wan is having a hard time. Yang Ruiyi had no choice but to send her to Tongmo to guard the west."

Hearing Li Ximing call him cunning and despicable, Li Zhouwei was somewhat surprised.

"For you to have such a high evaluation of him, Grand-Uncle... If he's a smart man, then he certainly won't make things difficult for you right now..."

Li Ximing nodded. Li Zhouwei relaxed his hands.

"I still need to make a trip to Mount Dali," he said. "As for my emergence, Grand-Uncle, you can use that to handle Yang Ruiyi. We don't need to be wary of him for now. After all, we saw from the last battle for the mountain that he is a man of deep strategy who loves surprise attacks. If we want to get rid of those monks, we will definitely need him."

"As for the two children... Que'Wan's spiritual item..."

When Li Zhouwei mentioned Li Que'wan, a proud smile spread across Li Ximing's face.

"Que'Wan mastered the secret arts long ago! I've already used a great pill to trade with the Chunyi Dao Gate for the other Whole Pill spiritual items she needed. I sent her into seclusion! It's been..."

He pinched his fingers, calculating.

"It's been about two years now!"

"That speed... is almost catching up to me!"

A look of surprise crossed Li Zhouwei's face. He nodded in satisfaction and retreated from the room. Li Ximing watched his junior quietly conceal his aura and depart, and he couldn't help but laugh secretly in his heart.

'This is going to be a good show!'

...

The Wilderness, Jiangjuan Prefecture.

The surging river glittered. Before long, a streak of brilliant light shot over from the north, appearing colorful and extremely dazzling.

The figure, dressed in black robes, had a somewhat honest face. He rode on fire and rain, passed through the clouds, and stopped before the main hall. He walked inside, bowed deeply, and called out,

"Your subordinate greets the Great General."

Yang Ruiyi, who had been standing at the head of the hall with his hands behind his back, immediately strode down.

"What did you find?"

The man replied, "I scouted all the way north. Helian Wujiang has already arrived at Helian Wumeng's camp. Shilou Fangjing has also left the Qi Lands. But... Qi Lanyan, his whereabouts are unknown..."

"Further past the mountains, there are vast expanses of banners. At times, demonic flames rage; at others, the light of the Lesser Yang manifests. There are also the clouds of Converging Water, churning endlessly. The rumors of the Touba family moving south are likely true!"

He hesitated for a moment before continuing, "There were abnormal movements in the Great Void in that area. I was afraid of being discovered, so I didn't dare get too close. But from a distance, I could see a string of heavy, sinking light. Your subordinate suspects... I suspect it's some kind of treasure."

Hearing this, Yang Ruiyi's expression immediately darkened, but he still nodded at the man, his tone polite.

"Thank you for your hard work, clan cousin!"

This man was none other than Li Chenghuai's maternal uncle, Yang Ruizao!

Yang Ruizao bowed and shook his head, voicing his doubt.

"I sense... the Touba family has some unusual methods."

Yang Ruiyi was silent for a moment before speaking in a low, heavy voice.

"Back then, Touba Changming surrendered to Wei and was granted the royal surname Yuan, officially becoming Yuan Changming. He received one of the Twelve Profound Talismans, and the Wei Emperor assigned him a Daoist Traditionthe Daoist Tradition of Demon Monarch Lu Xi of Azure Profoundity. However, the Azure Profoundity Daoist Tradition has always been astonishingly difficult to obtain. Yuan Changming only got his hands on some scraps before he died, and it wasn't passed down. He only left behind that one obscure Great Honored Book of Xuanxi, which the Touba family has always claimed was lost with the fall of Liang."

"This Monarch was one of the four ancestors of the Demon Dao, the master of one of the Four Demon Legacies... You should understand what this means. Among the four ancestors, Demon Monarch Chang Su taught the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch, and Demon Monarch Lu Xi enlightened the demon head Ting Shi. Both of them were figures who played with souls and the Great Void to the absolute extreme."

"This means that the Daoist Tradition and inheritance of two of the Four Demon Ancestors are in the Touba family's hands. This is how they were able to become the agents of the orthodox Demon Dao, and how they ensured that Shengle Heaven has not wavered, surviving to this day."

His expression was grim.

"When Father and the others jointly shrouded fate to plot against Tuoba Chongyuan, it wasn't to kill him in his cradle. There was another calculation. It was to use the Dragon-kin as a blade to test the Touba family's methods. In the end, we timed it just right to let Touba Lan come over, and he truly did just flick his sleeve and collect that remnant soul."

Yang Ruizao had also lived through that turmoil and had even lent a talisman to save Li Xizhi. The memory came back to him instantly.

Yang Ruiyi continued, "We were suspicious back then. We feared that after the fall of Liang, they no longer dared to cultivate the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch's Daoist Tradition and had instead secretly begun studying the Great Honored Book of Xuanxi they'd kept hidden... Otherwise, how could a complete novice like Touba Lan have been capable of collecting a remnant soul?"

"The scene you saw in the Great Void must be the power manifesting from the Xuanxi Demon Legacy. For them to display it so openly... Profound Governance must have compromised. They are using the Touba family to check Exiled Qi!"

Yang Ruizao found this hard to believe.

"Demon Monarch Lu Xi... even if he was one of the Four Demons, he has been dead for many years. How can he possibly stand against the supreme Exiled Qi!"

Evidently, Yang Ruizao was used to the omnipotence of the Underworld. To accept that the legacy left by a Demon Monarch dead for countless years could counterbalance Exiled Qi... how could he not be horrified!

'My own Lord is a figure of what stature! What is a Demon Ancestor? Even he would have to bow his head upon seeing Him!'

Yang Ruiyi, however, turned, his hands clasped behind his back.

"Now you're being shallow!" he said in a low tone. "Demon Monarch Lu Xi was a personal disciple of the Azure Profoundity Master! Do you know what kind of figure that is? Even the Great Sage True Hornless Dragon, who constantly thought and proclaimed himself a member of Azure Profoundity... would have to curry favor and call this Demon Monarch disciple-brother!"

Yang Ruizao had never cultivated in the Underworld and knew very little of these matters. He was rooted to the spot in shock. Yang Ruiyi had clearly been suppressing this for days and was now venting.

"And it's not just Demon Monarch Lu Xi. Wuguan goes without saying, but the other two Demon Ancestors could also come and go freely in the face of Exiled Qi. Those were the ancient Demon Lords! In the age when Immortal Lords stood side-by-side, who dared to call themselves a demon head? At the very least, they had to achieve 'Heaven and Earth cannot control, karma cannot bind.' How many people back then dared to make such a claim?"

Yang Ruizao wiped away his cold sweat and repeatedly agreed. Yang Ruiyi stopped himself in time, gave him a long look, and turned to ask,

"Is there still no news from Ting Province?"

He had expected to hear more of Li Ximing's excuses. He didn't expect a commotion from the men outside. One man stepped forward, bowed, and reported,

"General! Daoist Master Zhaojing has arrived in Ting! This lowly one did not dare to disturb important military matters!"

"Quickly, have him come up!"

A flicker of hope ignited in Yang Ruiyi's eyes. He gestured for his clan cousin, who cultivated in Jiangnan, to retreat, while simultaneously schooling his anxious expression. He sat in the main seat, and sure enough, he saw Li Ximing stride in quickly.

Yang Ruiyi smiled.

"Brother Ximing!"

Li Ximing, however, looked haggard, his eyes filled with sorrow. He looked like a man utterly lost. He stared at Yang Ruiyi for a long moment before replying,

"Great General..."

How could Yang Ruiyi not see his expression? His heart sank, and true anxiety began to set in.

'I sent him that Horn Wood spiritual resource. It should have been enough for his injuries... How can this be? Is Li Zhouwei's injury even worse than I thought! So bad that it's made him this distraught?... Or... after I took such a risk to protect Ting Province, is Li Ximing still playing games with me at a time like this!'

His face hardened.

"Brother Ximing, this is..."

Li Ximing looked left and right, then sighed without speaking. Yang Ruiyi immediately waved his sleeve, and the doors and windows of the great hall slammed shut. A thick, spiritual light suffused with Exiled Qi began to circulate, sealing off the chamber and even isolating it from the Great Void.

Who would have thought that the moment the doors closed, Li Ximing's back straightened, his sighs ceased, and his weary eyes filled with brilliant light. His entire demeanor changed in an instant. He faced Yang Ruiyi squarely and gave a formal bow.

"Congratulations, my lord!"

Yang Ruiyi was genuinely stunned for a second. Joy surged through his heart, but before he could even process it, he found himself looking at the man before him in a new light. His expression was peculiar.

'I still underestimated him. He truly is a Li family scion... so proper, so honest-looking... he can actually act!'

He wasn't angry. Instead, he looked almost amused.

"Ximing, what is this?"

Li Ximing smiled.

"I heard the General mention that there is a Daoist Master on the other side... one with extremely sharp eyes. Since I've left the front lines and have been running between the lake and the Wilderness for days, how could he not know?"

How could Yang Ruiyi not understand? Li Ximing was helping him plot against the northerners!

These past days, more and more northern cultivators had been gathering, slowly forming an encirclement around Tangdao Mountain. Situ Huo was sending him a new message every three days. The pressure on him was terrifying. Receiving good news was already a joy, but seeing Li Ximing's actions made him want to clap and cheer.

The man immediately shot to his feet, laughing.

"Good!"

He praised him, then immediately fell into thought, his voice deepening.

"Then we can't wait... Now that King Wei has recovered his strength, we will immediately form a surprise force and lift the siege on Tangdao Mountain!"

But Li Ximing just looked at him with a smile, and shook his head slightly.

Yang Ruiyi paused. He watched Li Ximing extend his hand and hold up three fingers.

"It's good news!"

The black-robed man stared blankly at him, then understood instantly. His heart seized.

"What?!"

'This... this is what kind of speed?! Is this just a blessing of fate? Don't tell me he's Li Xunquan reincarnated!'

But the intense shock flashed through his mind for only an instant. Yang Ruiyi immediately realized this was a perfect, heaven-sent opportunity. He felt completely refreshed. He paced twice on the high platform, his mood entirely different. His eyes were burning.

"Good... good... I understand."
