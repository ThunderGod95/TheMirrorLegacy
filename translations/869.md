# Chapter 869: The Viewing Pavilion

As Li Ximing considered the implications, the black-robed Daoist approached. This time, the jade tray held a round, ink-black stone column, no bigger than a palm, with a concave center that shimmered with a brilliant light.

This was the primary reward from the Great Xiukui Monastery for taking Fei Qingya.

Kui Qi nodded. "I acquired this myself some time ago in the Southern Sea. It was originally a spirit stone called the Shield of White Sun, but it was damaged during the fight to claim it. A corner broke off, and its essence began to leak away rapidly…"

"When I brought it back, I watched it weaken day by day. I had no choice but to have it refined, combining it with numerous spiritual materials to stabilize it. In the end, I obtained a pool of spirit extract. This is a portion of it," he explained. "It can be considered a spiritual resource and retains many of the original stone's properties. Beyond its conventional Bright Yang divine abilities, it is one of the rare Bright Yang materials that can be used to inscribe talismans. The only Bright Yang resource with superior effects in this regard is likely the Radiant Sky Stone."

He paused, adding a pointed reminder. "Zhaojing will need Bright Yang resources when he returns to refine his spirit embryo. He can make good use of this."

Li Ximing was in no position to be picky. He noted the generous portion, nodded repeatedly, and stored it away with a flick of his wrist. After the three of them had discussed the Dao for a while and finished the pot of tea, they prepared to depart.

Li Ximing summoned Cui Jueyin, who bowed to the four Daoist Masters before taking his place behind him. Lingmei, being the highest in status, spoke in a gravelly voice.

"Qiuhu has just been rescued, and Zhaojing has only now returned. We all have territories to govern, and I cannot be away from my Sword Gate for long. If there is any news, we can gather again at Tiger's Frontier."

Kui Qi smiled and bowed, seeing the three of them off. As their figures vanished into the vast expanse of white snow, he let out a sigh of relief. He turned to the black-robed Daoist, his voice low.

"The Black Spider Grotto is suffused with dark energy. Although it is suppressed by Mount Buding… the other grottos can see it. Has there been any reaction?"

The Daoist replied in a hushed tone, "None… However, we received word today that the Lingu Family has come asking about Lingu Lanying and Lingu Rao…"

Kui Qi sighed, a touch of regret in his voice. "I warned Lingu Rao back then. The next few decades were not suitable for a breakthrough. He was determined to press on, so there was nothing to be done… Send his remains back to the Lingu Family."

"For now, we will see what Lingu Lanying can do," he continued. "One can look down on the Northern Buddhists as individuals, but not as a power. If she succeeds, we will have another card to play…"

"Yes!" the black-robed Daoist, Huiyu, replied with his head bowed. "Lingu Lanying is of a close bloodline and greatly resembles the Lady from back then, which is why the Great Daoist Master favors her. He did grant her a spiritual item, after all. I also heard that the Great Daoist Master once held her hand and taught her the wonders of various spiritual artifacts. And the painting he made during his conflict between the north and south… he has been nurturing it all this time, and it, too, is for her."

"I understand," Kui Qi said, a shadow of melancholy crossing his features. He paced a few steps in the snow and sighed. "Master is a sentimental man. Otherwise, he wouldn't have watched over the Lingu Family for hundreds of years, elevating them to their current status. It reached the point where, worrying about his own dwindling lifespan, he resolved to raise a Purple Mansion expert for them…"

"Lingu Rao was doomed to die when he entered the grotto-heaven back then; it was Master who intervened to save him. In the end, that one proved useless. Now, only Lingu Lanying remains."

As the foremost figure of the Great Xiukui Monastery, Lou Xing had traveled a thousand miles to that grotto-heaven just to save a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator of Eastern Yue blood. The extent of his favoritism was clear. The two men exchanged a silent, knowing look, leaving their other thoughts unspoken.

‘The Lin family has plenty of Purple Mansion cultivators, yet he rarely sees them. Meanwhile, he has propped up one member of the Lingu Family after another, and is finally about to succeed in creating a Purple Mansion expert. But will this new Purple Mansion belong to the Azure Pond Sect or the Great Xiukui Monastery?’

The Daoist traditions of the Supreme Yang Dao were deeply interconnected. The Great Xiukui Monastery was teeming with talent and at the height of its power. Kui Qi, a man of integrity, wasn't overly concerned about one Purple Mansion expert ending up with the Azure Pond Sect—it might even be a good thing. But from what he understood of Lou Xing's intentions, the Great Daoist Master, who had grasped Sword Intent… would likely hand over a significant number of spiritual artifacts to the Lingu Family…

For the Great Xiukui Monastery, this would be a devastating blow, cutting to the bone! A conservative and steadfast man like Kui Qi could not sit by and watch it happen.

Not only did Kui Qi have to worry about Lou Xing's lifespan and secretly search for life-extending treasures, but he also had to manage the favoritism of this Great Daoist Master, who grew more willful and indulgent of his whims with age. And the worst part was, he couldn't speak a word of his troubles to anyone, leaving a bitter taste in his mouth.

If he, Kui Qi, were truly ruthless, Lingu Lanying would certainly fail her breakthrough the moment Lou Xing died. But out of respect for his master and his own pride, he buried these thoughts deep within, letting out only a sigh.

‘It’s common for the elderly to show favoritism… But… but… Lingu Lanying… she has no attachment to Tiger's Frontier. Once she gets the spiritual artifacts, she’ll be even more wary of us. She will definitely stay with the Azure Pond Sect… Even if Ning Wan were willing, why would the Lingu Family, or she herself, give up the rich lands of Simin and the Azure Pond Sect? Why would she abandon her autonomy to come here and submit to us…’

***

Li Ximing and Ning Wan traveled north, with Cui Jueyin following quietly behind. They crossed into the territory of the Azure Pond Sect. Having cultivated a divine ability, the foremost beauty of the Azure Pond Sect was now breathtakingly beautiful with every glance and gesture. She sighed.

"The spiritual atmosphere near the shore feels strange… I just hope nothing has happened to the Great Daoist Master."

Li Ximing had heard of this Great Daoist Master Lou Xing many times; even Yuandao had expressed concern for him years ago. He naturally offered words of comfort.

"If something were truly wrong with the Great Daoist Master and his time was short, Zhelu would never dare to provoke you. It is precisely because the Great Daoist Master is fine, merely pressed for time to cultivate his divine ability and unable to risk injury, that Zhelu feels bold enough to make a move."

There was sound logic in his words. A dying Great Daoist Master was the most terrifying foe. From the way Yuandao had spoken, he had not seemed overly anxious, making this the most credible assessment. Ning Wan nodded and smiled.

"Senior Kui Qi is a warm person, but he is also very meticulous. Though Zhaojing is not deeply versed in the Dao of talismans, the spirit extract from the Shield of White Sun can be used to forge your spirit embryo. You can find a Daoist Master of refinement or even do it yourself. It will be very useful."

Her expression flickered slightly as she added, "After all, the sooner it’s forged, the better."

As soon as Ning Wan said this, Li Ximing understood her meaning. He now stood on the side of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Kui Qi's repeated warmth, even sharing information about Bright Yang spiritual artifacts so freely, was clearly aimed at raising Li Ximing's strength as quickly as possible.

This spirit embryo was part of that plan. The Great Xiukui Monastery might not have any Purple Mansion-grade Bright Yang spirit treasures, but with the legacy of the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven, they surely had no shortage of Purple Mansion-level Bright Yang cultivation resources. So why specifically choose the spirit extract of the Shield of White Sun? Was it for drawing talismans?

If it was for talismans, wasn't that a specialty of the Great Xiukui Monastery? They would surely cherish something they excelled at. Why give it to him?

It had to be because the spirit extract of the Shield of White Sun was better suited for enhancing a spirit embryo! The sooner his spirit embryo was forged, the stronger he would become. This was a method that would yield results in a short time, unlike cultivation resources, which would take at least a decade or two to show any effect.

Li Ximing signaled that he understood. Though he was not skilled in refinement, he possessed the *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire*. Adding the spirit extract of the Shield of White Sun meant he wouldn't have to trouble Jinyu or Hengzhu, which was a great relief. He smiled.

"I hear the Ning Clan has a guest elder named Chu Minglian, who also cultivates Radiant Fire. I have constructed a ritual platform to forge this spirit embryo. When I am not present, I will need a master skilled in refinement to oversee it."

Ning Wan understood immediately. "I will send him over," she said softly.

Li Ximing thanked her. He had rarely encountered so much good fortune since reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, and a smile remained on his face. After crossing the Wilderness, he and Ning Wan exchanged communication jades for emergency alerts, and she departed toward Lake Xian.

Li Ximing rode the Profound Light back with Cui Jueyin. Flying over the lake, he could feel the joy and awe of the cultivators below. They chattered in hushed tones, and smaller local families had sent representatives to offer their respects, their eyes filled with envy and wonder.

Groups of people flew about on streaks of light, dotting the sky above the lake. Li Ximing, however, traversed the Great Void, appearing silently and unnoticed on the edge of a high formation platform. Only then did he get a chance to properly examine the formation array before him.

‘Broad Valley Purple Visage Light.’

He gently raised his hand. Strands and wisps of purplish-yellow light descended from the sky, most no larger than willow leaves. They swirled and gathered in his palm. Behind him, Cui Jueyin felt a suffocating pressure, as if a single touch from one of those tiny beams of light could incinerate him completely.

‘Its power is impressive,’ Li Ximing thought. ‘It has an entangling, imprisoning quality, and it feels relentless. Though it can't compare to the killing power of a Bright Yang light, it's superior to most spell arts. If a Merciful One were caught off guard by this, he would be injured. As for dealing with other Purple Mansion experts… it can only be used for containment… I can’t rely on it to kill.’

‘A pity. This is a Purple Mansion-grade grand formation, after all. With its help, the Foundation Establishment cultivators can defend against other Purple Mansion experts when I am absent. But without the ability to traverse the Great Void, they can't use this profound light offensively. It’s even questionable whether they can control such a marvel properly.’

The gulf between the Purple Mansion and Foundation Establishment realms was a heavenly chasm, difficult to cross. Li Ximing casually dispersed the light and turned. "Have the Foundation Establishment cultivators on the lake meet me at the Viewing Pavilion Platform."

With that, he dissolved into Profound Light and vanished.

The Viewing Pavilion Platform stood below the Inherited Clarity Gate, composed of one main stage and twelve auxiliary towers. It was the foundation for the *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire*. The construction had been an immense undertaking and had been completed years ago, heavily guarded and fortified with formations. No one had ever set foot upon it.

Li Ximing traversed the Great Void and appeared at the apex of the main stage. It was dawn, and a cold wind blew. The black and red banners on the twelve surrounding towers fluttered. In the center of the main stage was a celestial altar. He walked up its steps, from where he could perfectly see the pavilions on the distant lake.

‘The Viewing Pavilion Platform… the name is quite fitting.’

In that brief moment, Li Jiangqian and the others had already sped over. They bowed from the stage, their faces alight with joy, and said in unison, "Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing scanned the crowd, counting the numbers. His eyes fell upon a very excited Ding Weizeng kneeling at the front, and he nodded. He then saw Li Que'wan, Xia Shouyu, and the others, feeling a stir of emotion.

‘To think I have so many Foundation Establishment cultivators under my command now.’

But the matter of the spirit embryo was urgent; the sooner it was forged, the sooner it could be used. Li Ximing wasted no more time and immediately began to make arrangements.

The *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire* required twelve Foundation Establishment cultivators, corresponding to the twelve auxiliary towers. They would be divided into two alternating groups of six for the ritual forging. Of course, if manpower allowed, twenty-four towers could be built to speed up the process even more.

He began to call out the names. "Li Wen of 'Jade True', An Siwei, White Ape of 'True Qi', Cui Jueyin of 'Bright Yang', Li Minggong of 'True Fire', Ding Weizeng of 'Hengzhu', Sun Bai of 'Horn Wood', and Xia Shouyu of 'Blazing Fire'."

A quick survey showed that, aside from his two Talisman Seed successors who shouldn't spend their time here, he had eight cultivators whose arts did not conflict with Bright Yang, and in fact, would even benefit from the process. Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then asked, "What is the status of the two Foundation Establishment cultivators from back then, Wen Yi and Wen Shan?"

Wen Yi and Wen Shan were demonic cultivators from the Eastern Sea who had been captured by the Li family. Li Ximing had subdued them with his divine ability and locked them on the west bank, forcing them to refine artifacts with their dharma power day after day. Many years had passed. Li Jiangqian answered respectfully, "The two brothers are just grateful to be alive. They have been docile and diligent all these years."

"Then bring them over for now…"

The two of them were of 'Asura Ridge', not a perfect match, but they would suffice to make up the numbers, bringing the total to ten. For the remaining two, Qu Bushi was needed to gather information in the north. After some thought, Li Ximing could only choose Fei Qing'yi of 'Cold Qi' and Miaoshui of 'Converging Water'.

Although these two were not ideal and their effects would be less than the others, he needed to assemble all twelve. The secret technique specified that besides a few types like 'Veiled Yin', 'Pit Water' was also unsuitable, which meant Chen Yang could not participate.

With their orders given, the Foundation Establishment cultivators took their positions on the platforms. Li Ximing reached into his sleeve and drew out the Shichuan.

The Li family actually possessed several other treasures. One was the Sun Seeker Ring, whose grade was unknown. But since it had once caused the Immortal Mirror to resonate, the family had never dared to bring it out again, leaving it locked away at the bottom of a chest.

The second was the ancient magical artifact, the Profound Pattern Vase, which could manifest different effects based on different Daoist traditions. It was incredibly wondrous, but whether it could be forged into a spirit embryo was another question. Its ability to produce different wonders with different dharma powers didn't seem very 'Bright Yang'. If it were forged and then couldn't be nurtured, it would be a huge embarrassment. In any case, Li Zhouwei had taken it, so it wasn't here.

After considering everything, the safest and best option was the Shichuan.

Under his Bright Yang divine ability, the Shichuan had long been refined. Now, it emitted a soft Profound Light as it descended gently onto the central celestial altar. Li Ximing then flicked a finger.

"BOOM!"

Flashes of red and white erupted as gleaming golden flames mixed with Bright Yang purple fire, boiling into a spherical ball of light on the altar. The intense heat made the Shichuan blaze with dazzling brilliance. The twelve Foundation Establishment cultivators channeled their arts in unison, and twelve ley lines lit up on the main stage, stabilizing the flames.

With the platform activated, six of them could wait their turn to rotate, ensuring the manpower wasn't stretched too thin. Li Ximing first used the Profound Light from between his brows to measure and calculate the required amount and timing for the Radiant Fire and Baleful Fire Qi over the next three days. He handed a jade slip to Li Minggong, who had flown down, and gave her some instructions. "I'm leaving this Viewing Pavilion Platform in your care. Among everyone here, you cultivate True Fire and have some understanding of refinement. You can manage the timing and replenish the Radiant Fire and Baleful Fire Qi. For now, you will be in charge."

Once Chu Minglian from the Ning family arrived, Li Ximing could almost wash his hands of the matter entirely.

‘Although Minggong cultivates True Fire and can attempt refinement, her talent is not high. Chu Minglian has had a connection with our family for many years. Perhaps this time, he can gain some insight into our Daoist tradition…’

Having arranged matters for the spirit embryo, he rode the light with Li Jiangqian and the other towards Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

In the span of a few days, the Li family had erected a grand formation and begun forging a spirit embryo. The clan's atmosphere was completely renewed. Li Jiangqian seemed to have something to say but held his tongue due to the rapid succession of events. He first bowed.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master… the Viewing Pavilion Platform requires a great deal of manpower, drawing nearly all the Foundation Establishment cultivators from the lake. May I ask how many years this forging will take?"

A spirit embryo was less troublesome and demanding than a spiritual artifact, as it required constant nurturing to maintain its Purple Mansion-grade status after being forged. Li Ximing estimated that even a Purple Mansion expert without a relevant Daoist tradition could forge one in a few decades, albeit of lower quality. The *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire* was an ancient technique, and with twelve Foundation Establishment cultivators, the time should be reduced to under eight years.

More importantly, there was the spirit extract from the Shield of White Sun that Kui Qi had given him. Although he hadn't used it yet, the fact that Kui Qi had specifically mentioned it suggested it would be of great benefit to the spirit embryo.

As for Radiant Fire and Baleful Fire Qi, Gardenia Scenery Mountain had no shortage of them, and with the boost from his own Purple Mansion True Fire, Li Ximing simply replied, "Wait a while. It will take a few years at most. Bring out the family's Bright Yang resources so we can finish it as soon as possible."

Li Jiangqian acknowledged the order. Li Que'wan then said softly, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, the sixteen pillars of the island have been demarcated. The earth veins have shifted, and the original spirit fields and spiritual energy flows are completely different. The immortal caves and palaces can no longer be used. We are currently remeasuring the spiritual and earth veins to design new residences."

Li Ximing nodded. Li Jiangqian then reported on the cultivation progress of several family members, mentioning that Li Xinghan, Li Zhouda, and his own two younger brothers, Li Jianglong and Li Jiangxia, were all in seclusion for breakthroughs. Li Ximing was pleased.

"The secrets of the Essence Gathering Pills are no longer hidden from our family, and the quality of our direct bloodline is improving. The probability of reaching Foundation Establishment is high, but we must exercise restraint. For Foundation Establishment, quality is more important than quantity. Supporting them is a huge expense, whether in spiritual energy or resources. Each step forward requires a vast amount… and it's even more pronounced for those with poor aptitude."

"Our family has sixteen prefectures and two mountains. Gardenia Scenery Mountain can barely support my own cultivation. Even with the vastness of the Milin Mountains, our territory can comfortably support thirty Foundation Establishment cultivators at most. Once the number of direct descendants at Foundation Establishment is sufficient, the bestowing of Essence Gathering Pills must be done with great care."

In truth, Li Ximing had deeper worries. The Li family's strength was expanding too quickly, which wasn't necessarily a good thing. The number of factions and branches beneath them was also growing. He said softly, "Let's wait for them to come out of seclusion… then we will discuss it further."

He flicked his sleeve and asked, "What is the situation at the Riverbank?"

Li Jiangqian reported respectfully, "The changes have been drastic. First, in Jiangnan, Daoist Master Zhu Gong has disappeared, and her soul lamp has dimmed. The Sacred Writ Gate was a poorly organized group to begin with, and with this incident, not only are the lower ranks in disarray, but conflicts have also arisen among the direct lineages. They are nearly paralyzed. Tensions between the various factions are high; I hear they are on the verge of fighting."

Li Jiangqian had never thought much of the Sacred Writ Gate. Sure enough, with Daoist Master Zhu Gong gone, they were one step away from drawing blades on each other.

"As for the Capital immortals Dao… the counties and cities under its rule are in a state of panic. They are being run in circles by an unknown group. Guan Gongxiao has been sending letters almost every other day. Now that he's heard we've erected a Purple Mansion-grade grand formation, he has likely guessed a few things and has sent several more letters, pleading for our help."

Li Ximing nodded noncommittally. "Continue."

"And then there's the Hall of the Locust Soul… their situation is even worse. We received news some time ago that the Black Rat Daoist was killed, which is normal enough. But I just received word this morning that Daoist Bai… has been murdered! Even the legendary secret token has vanished without a trace. Although his Dharma Protectors immediately locked down the news, the organization is as leaky as a sieve. Everyone knows by now!"

"Daoist Bai is dead prematurely!"

"Indeed… It's said that before he died… his soul scattered. It seems all his dharma power and vital energy were completely drained, without even the slightest phenomenon appearing. If not for his fluttering robes and fallen magical artifact… the members of the Hall of the Locust Soul would have thought he had simply departed quietly…"

Li Ximing was stunned. He frowned. "Hah… the Purple Smoke Gate's stage has been utterly smashed…"

With this, a sense of unease began to grow in Li Ximing's heart. Ning Wan's personality and her circumstances were different from Tinglan's. If he were in Ning Wan's position right now, aside from maintaining the situation and not crossing the river, he probably wouldn't be able to intervene much either.

‘As for the True Monarch… I wonder what his cultivation level is now… With the Hall Master of the Hall of the Locust Soul dead, I wonder on whom this karma will fall…’

"Wang Quwan… has any news come back?" Li Ximing asked.

Li Jiangqian silently shook his head. Seeing Li Ximing deep in thought, and assuming that concluded their business, Li Jiangqian quickly added, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, there is some good news. We heard about Father's whereabouts some time ago. He was spotted in the market of the Purple Smoke Gate. At that time, we only knew he was safe and sound in the Eastern Sea, which was a relief."

"Now that news of the Daoist Master's return has reached Zongquan Island, we have received a reply. It turns out Father was cultivating a secret technique in seclusion near Zongquan, and his location was kept hidden. Now that he has emerged and heard of your return, he sent a message home… He is preparing… to enter seclusion to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm!"

Li Jiangqian's words finally made Li Ximing's eyes light up. "It's about time we had news of him!"

Li Zhouwei hadn't said much in his message, but how could Li Ximing not understand? There was no need for Li Zhouwei to reveal his location to the family unless he wanted to see Li Ximing before entering seclusion!

The Li family was not what it once was. Back then, they needed Xiao Yuansi to toil away at alchemy. Now, Li Ximing could easily prepare all the resources Li Zhouwei needed to advance his immortal foundation to the Shengyang Acupoint! And the experience Li Zhouwei had gained from cultivating his secret technique would be incredibly valuable.

Moreover, as the two core figures of the Li family who had been out of contact for so many years, they desperately needed to meet.

‘I should have suspected it! The Eastern Sea is the safest place for him. Besides, Zongquan Island is the territory of the Dragon Prince Dingjiao, and we have our own island there. It couldn't be a better location.’

He thought it over, slightly worried that Changxiao might try to intercept him. Although the Li Ximing of today was no longer the newly-ascended, inexperienced Purple Mansion cultivator he once was, a man like Changxiao would not underestimate him.

‘As long as I use the Immortal Mirror to scout, no matter what grand divine ability Changxiao uses or how precise his calculations are, he can forget about ambushing me!’

Without a moment's hesitation, Li Ximing took out another jade talisman and handed it to Li Jiangqian. "I should have met with the clansmen to celebrate the completion of the formation, but this matter is urgent," he said in a grave voice. "I must make a trip to the Eastern Sea immediately. Traversing the Great Void is fast; I will be back before long. If there is any news, crush this jade talisman to notify me!"
