# Chapter 1060: The Five Virtues Doctrine

The waters of the Peacock Sea shimmered with myriad colors, beautiful under the glow of the Heavenly Light. Li Ximing flew on his beam of light, his expression heavy with thought.

He had left in a hurry, ostensibly to deal with the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. A trip to the Nine Mounds was necessary, true, but it was hardly _this_ urgent. The truth was, when he'd arrived back at the island, one look had made his scalp crawl. He hadn't dared to step foot inside. Thankfully, this "urgent business" provided the perfect excuse to immediately get Li Que'wan away from there.

As they traveled, he listened to Li Que'wan's account, and all Li Ximing could do was laugh bitterly.

"Life is full of unexpected turns... When I invited Senior Liu to the island all those years ago, I worried he might attract... undesirable elements. I never thought it would actually come to pass."

Hearing his transmitted thoughts, Li Que'wan worried he was blaming Liu Changdie and quickly replied, "Lord Liu has been very kind to us all these years. It's not as if he _meant_ for this to happen..."

Li Ximing saw her mistake and shook his head.

"This can't be blamed on anyone. If Senior Liu hadn't been guarding the Eastern Sea, the Wave-Suppressing Mansion would have been lost long ago. Not to mention, we would never have had such a steady supply of Neck Feathers!"

The Wave-Suppressing Mansion had been incredibly valuable over the years. The amount of Wall-Sinking Water they had collected was staggering, pool after pool of it, so much that the price for Wall-Sinking Water in the Eastern Sea had skyrocketed. If Daoist Master Kuang Yu hadn't also been collecting it under her own name, they would have drawn far too much unwanted attention.

Eventually, Wall-Sinking Water became nearly impossible to find. But thanks to that long period of accumulation, Li Ximing had been able to covertly trade with Golden Feather for Profound Shell Flower-Leaves twice more. After a total of four such trades, he _still_ had two Neck Feathers in reserve. And that wasn't even counting the other spiritual resources obtained through those exchanges, which were easily worth as much as two or three Spiritual Artifacts.

He said worriedly, "Look... his claim about finding the Dragon-kin isn't baseless. We should just do our best to satisfy his request. Let those nobles fight amongst themselves. The important thing is to get him off our island, and fast."

Li Que'wan remained anxious.

"If something goes wrong, I just pray the Dragon-kin don't take their anger out on our family. We're forced to pretend we see nothing, caught right in the middle. If they decide to blame us, there's no way to escape."

Li Ximing gave her a deep look.

"They won't dare. They will not provoke Minghuang."

Li Que'wan nodded thoughtfully. Li Ximing, however, turned the situation over in his mind, suddenly unsure what he should or shouldn't say.

The only two people in the Li family who truly understood their current predicament were Li Zhouwei and himself. Li Que'wan was resilient and gentle-natured; she could be told some of it. But Li Jiangqian... his mind was far too active. Li Ximing found he didn't dare discuss it with him. He sighed internally.

'Let Zhouwei decide for himself... I'll just keep my mouth shut.'

He pushed the thought aside, but the anxiety in his heart only deepened. Even with the excuse, he could only rush toward the Nine Mounds. After something like this, how could he possibly feel settled? Gritting his teeth, he finally made a decision,

'I didn't want to disturb Zhouwei, but this threatens the Wave-Suppressing Mansion, and possibly our very foundation... I'm afraid I have to see him.'

And so, he flew with Li Que'wan over the Peacock Sea for a time, but not directly toward the Nine Mounds. Instead, he veered toward the East A-Wang Sea. There, he dove beneath the waves, locating a hidden recess in the seabedâ€”the very same subterranean cavern where he had refined the Treasured Pill all those years ago.

He had cleaned the place meticulously, leaving no lingering aura of pills or herbs. Li Ximing casually sealed the entrance, scanned the surroundings to ensure they were alone, and instructed Li Que'wan to cultivate while she waited. Then, he rose into the air, drifting away toward the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

A moment later, his vision filled with interlocking gold and white. The familiar sight of the sun and moon shining together, and the perfectly stable spiritual aura, materialized around him. Li Ximing descended from the entrance pavilion. The entire space was bathed in radiance. He saw the man seated atop the platform in the center of the courtyard.

Li Zhouwei had removed his armor and wore a simple grey Daoist robe. His long hair, rarely unbound, spilled down his back. He sat silently cross-legged on the platform, resembling an ancient, slumbering lion coiled in its lair.

Li Ximing then recalled that Li Zhouwei's armor was being repaired in the Baleful Fire Qi of Gardenia Scenery Mountain. Strangely, without that imposing suit of profound armor, the junior before him somehow seemed even more unsettling.

Li Ximing took a single step forward. Instantly, those golden eyes snapped open, keenly alert. A pool of cold, golden light shone from the shadowed courtyard, falling directly onto Li Ximing's face.

"Minghuang!"

The soft call made the vision of the white qilin vanish. Li Zhouwei stood, gathering his long hair with one hand and tying it back as he spoke respectfully,

"What instructions does Grand-Uncle have for me?"

Li Ximing sighed.

"Trouble has found us. I'm afraid I might need you to go out and take a look..."

He quickly explained the situation. As he listened, Li Zhouwei's gaze grew heavy. He stepped off the platform, and his first question was:

"In his letters, did Liu Changdie ever mention Fuxun seeking an audience with the Dragon-kin?"

Li Ximing replied, "He did..."

This earned a slight nod from Li Zhouwei.

"The fact that my injuries have healed is a closely guarded secret. It's critical for the plans to come, so I cannot leave seclusion. If I'm revealed, it could very well trigger the war between north and south prematurely. I cannot go."

His expression was distant as he continued, "As for the Wave-Suppressing Mansion, that's not difficult to resolve. Since Liu Changdie already mentioned it, your trip now has a perfect pretext. I'll write a letter at once. Grand-Uncle, you will take it to Chongzhou and give it to Huiyao. Have him ask the Sea-Patrolling Envoy to make a trip to the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. That will solve the problem without our family getting too deeply involved."

He raised his hand slightly, drawing a piece of silk cloth from his sleeve. He conjured a brush from thin air and, using his divine ability and dharma power as ink, began to write golden characters on the cloth. His expression was stern.

"I will frame it as arranging my affairs and appointing a Demon King to look after the Li family's younger generation. The White Dragon Shrine will not refuse such a request."

Li Ximing nodded, relieved. Li Zhouwei finished the letter with a final stroke.

"As for Suining," he said in a low voice, "you don't need to worry, Grand-Uncle. Just feign ignorance. I was already planning to see Qingyu Qian; I have a plan for this. We'll just send Suining into seclusion. In five or six years, I'll have arrangements in place. If it _is_ some external influence, it won't be too late to eliminate it then."

Hearing this, Li Ximing understood Li Zhouwei's absolute determination to achieve his next divine ability. He didn't ask what would happen if disaster struck during those five or six years. His worried expression gradually calmed. He raised an eyebrow and looked at his grand-nephew.

"I will go and request a Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill for you."

Li Zhouwei paused, but finally nodded. Li Ximing silently tucked the letter away as Li Zhouwei added a reminder.

"The yin and yang in this place are perfectly balanced; that balance will leave a trace on the cloth. Since this is for the Dragon-kin, let it air out for a while after you leave. Don't be in a hurry to deliver it."

Li Ximing nodded and walked out quickly. When he reached the steps, he hesitated and glanced back. The young man was already seated on the platform again, as still and imposing as a divine statue.

...

In the cavern, the fire vein pulsed with power. Li Que'wan had been waiting for a long time when Li Ximing finally stepped out of the void and reappeared.

The Daoist Master's expression was natural, and he seemed much more relaxed. He patted her on the head and smiled.

"Don't worry. It's all been handled."

He then summoned his light and sped outward. Seeing Li Que'wan's confused expression, he began to reassure her.

"You're not at the Wave-Suppressing Mansion, so even if its Purple Mansion Great Formation is lost, it's fine. This place we're going to is the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition. The host is Daoist Master Yuandao. You must be proper and polite. Don't speak out of turn; only answer if you are directly asked."

Li Que'wan indeed looked a little nervous, but she nodded seriously. Li Ximing chuckled.

"I fled here once when I was gravely injured... You mentioned you were 'touring the east,' so we'll stick with that story. The master of Nine Mounds was very kind to me back then, even giving me a type of spiritual fire. You must make a good impression. I also plan to... probe him a little today. If anything happens in the future, if you find yourself wandering the seas alone, this is a place you might be able to come for help."

Li Que'wan's serious expression immediately crumbled. She pressed her lips together and gave a small, low sound of assent.

Decades had passed since his last visit, but Nine Mounds Mountain was still a sea of crimson and purple. Maple leaves rippled like waves in the sea breeze. Li Ximing waited before the main gate. Soon, he saw an old man descending a small mountain path and immediately smiled and bowed.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, it has been a long time!"

This old man was none other than the old Daoist Master Lingdu!

The old Daoist Master's cultivation wasn't exceptionally high, but he had the classic bearing of an immortal sage. His kind, benevolent face instantly put one at ease. Li Ximing smiled, his heart settling a bit.

"Greetings, Senior... I was ignorant in my youth and caused you much trouble..."

Lingdu just smiled, shook his head, and invited him up the mountain.

"Nonsense, nonsense..."

The two exchanged pleasantries as they walked up to the maple grove. The stone table where Lingdu and Houfu had once played their game was still there on the summit. Li Ximing sighed inwardly at the sight and deliberately took a seat to the side, rather than opposite.

Lingdu saw the gesture and shook his head, saying nothing. Li Ximing, in turn, tacitly avoided mentioning the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. He accepted the tea the old man offered.

"I came this time... to ask about your esteemed order's Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew. My family has a promising junior who cultivates the path of Lesser Yin, and I am trying to plan for his future."

Lingdu raised an eyebrow, intrigued.

"He cultivates...?"

Li Ximing replied, "All-Fragrance Sinks."

"How rare!"

Lingdu praised the fact, then set down his tea.

"That's not difficult," he smiled. "Are you looking to help him break through to a new divine ability? Are you asking to reserve a spot in the pool for your friend?"

Li Ximing had cultivated in the Shade-Cleansing Pool before and knew it could sharpen one's spiritual senses, making it highly beneficial for breaking through to a new divine ability. But he had never imagined the Daoist Master would be this generous; he had only intended to ask for a small vial of the pool's water. A look of delighted surprise crossed his face.

"Senior, that is too great a kindness! I was only going to ask for a small sample of the Wondrous Dew!"

Lingdu laughed and shook his head, his expression turning serious.

"In the Shade-Cleansing Pool, the Lesser Yin is heavy and the Pure Qi sinks deep. Not just anyone can break through in there. The very reason it can condense a spiritual resource like the Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew is to specifically aid the cultivation of those on the Lesser Yin path."

He tapped lightly on the tabletop. A cultivator hurried over and bowed to them both. Lingdu gave his instructions.

"Go fetch the Profound Urn. Have your Eldest Disciple-Brother join you. Wait for the midnight hour, and when it unseals, draw a full urn of Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew and bring it here."

He turned back to Li Ximing.

"Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew normally cannot be removed from the pool. However, our Daoist tradition has studied it for many years and made some progress. We possess a 'Cinnabar-Mark Profound Urn' crafted from treasures of Lesser Yin and Pure Qi. With this urn, the dew can be transported for a short time, though it still cannot be preserved indefinitely."

He smiled.

"The 'Cinnabar-Mark Profound Urn' is, however, a spirit embryo that my disciple is currently nurturing. After you have used it, Daoist Friend, please remember to return the Profound Urn."

"Thank you! Thank you!"

Li Ximing nodded gravely. If this had been years ago, he would have been stunned at their willingness to casually lend out a spirit embryo. But having seen more of the world, it now felt... normal. Daoist traditions like this one had been accumulating treasures since ancient times; who knew what wonders they possessed.

'It's a long journey back here,' he thought. 'I'll just have Guo Nanwu run the errand when the time comes.'

But Li Ximing had no intention of accepting such a gift for free. He immediately retrieved a box from his sleeve and presented it solemnly.

"Here is a Cangzhou Serpent Scale and a Neck Feather. Please accept them as compensation. First, as thanks for the Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew, and second, as gratitude for the kindness you showed me when you saved my life all those years ago!"

There was a reason Li Ximing had immediately apologized for his "ignorance" back then. In those days, he hadn't understood just how precious the Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew was for advancing a divine ability. Now, he understood perfectly. Sima Yuanli had used the Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder to advance his own, and that was refined from a Hollow-heart Profound Mulberryâ€”a true spiritual treasure!

By that logic, the amount the Shade-Cleansing Pool could condense must be limited. When he had used his Valley Wind Guide-Fire art back then, he had absorbed far more than a single person's share. How could they _not_ have known?

"Daoist Friend, you are truly too polite."

Seeing Li Ximing's gesture, Lingdu gave him an appreciative look, but he smiled and pushed the box back.

"The Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew only has that 'advancing divine ability' effect when one is _inside_ the Shade-Cleansing Pool. The true efficacy lies in the pool itself. Otherwise, why would I offer a full urn for a junior at the Foundation Establishment Realm? You don't need to be so concerned."

"And as for the Shade-Cleansing Pool itself, Daoist Friend, don't overestimate it. While it can certainly clarify the spiritual sense, breaking through to a new divine ability is a matter of natural law. When that state of obscuration emerges, the Shade-Cleansing Pool cannot dispel it. And if heart-devils arise, that is one's own battle to fight."

Li Ximing finally understood. He nodded thoughtfully, leaving the returned box on the table. He sensed an opportunity and, feigning a hint of reluctance, pressed on.

"This... obscuration... can it truly not be removed? With so many mighty cultivators throughout history, is there not a single precedent?"

He was clearly, if subtly, asking about his own family's situation. The question was posed naturally. Lingdu stroked his beard, pausing for a moment before he spoke.

"It is not _entirely_ so. Has Daoist Friend ever heard of... the Wuguan Legacy?"

Li Ximing raised his eyebrows, adopting a posture of keen interest as the old man continued.

"The Three Profound Daoist Traditions each have their own orthodoxies and differing philosophies. Long, long ago, in the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition, there was a great figure named Wuguan. He was the first to propose abolishing the Five Virtues Doctrine and replacing it with the Clear-Deep Six Movements Theory. He occupied the Pure Qi Intercalary Position and was one of the four ancestors of the Ancient Demonic Dao."

"He left behind a legacy, one transformed from his own Rank Designation. Those favored by this legacy can obtain many wondrous benefits. One of those benefits is precisely the power to reduce that state of obscuration and elevate the Shengyang Acupoint."

Li Ximing frowned, finding this difficult to grasp.

"Abolish the Five Virtues Doctrine? The Five Virtues are a fundamental principle of heaven and earth. How can they simply be abolished?"

Lingdu shook his head.

"Fire Virtue, Water Virtue... these are just the unified names used by the various sects. But what _is_ the true connection between water and fire? Why should the Five Elements be collectively called the Five Virtues? You yourself have heard that Earth Virtue has five earths, yet there is also a sixth earth, Azure Proclaimation. And Azure Proclaimation is _also_ classified as Ancient Merging, is it not?"

"Ultimately, these are just names people have grown accustomed to using. In the eyes of those at a higher level, Fruition Attainments are simply higher or lower, some closer, some more distant. There isn't one grand, overarching category. Or perhaps there was, but the various immortals and Immortal Lords could never fully agree on one, and so, it ceased to exist."

"In ancient times, the world was at peace. Conflicts were not over life and death, but debates between Daoist Traditions. Cultivators openly exchanged knowledge, generously sharing their own Daoist canons. Many schools of thought contended, and so these various doctrines spread throughout the lands."

He glanced at Li Que'wan, who was standing behind Li Ximing, and smiled with amusement.

"For example, the progenitor of the Whole Pill dao referred to the Three Shamans and Two Rites as the 'Prime Virtue,' placing it as a _sixth_ virtue. He claimed that the Whole Pill was the 'origin-embryo' of the Prime Virtue, and the Prime Virtue was the 'root-nature' of the Whole Pill. This teaching is still passed down today. Every major tradition has its own doctrine, created to better organize its own cultivation methods and make it easier for future generations to practice. He was another of the figures who supported abolishing the Five Virtues Doctrine. If you were a Whole Pill cultivator, using the 'Whole Pill Prime Virtue Theory' to understand the world's mysteries and the transformation of elements would certainly be more intuitive than the Five Virtues Doctrine!"

Li Que'wan looked up thoughtfully, understanding that the old Daoist Master was intentionally enlightening her as he spoke.

"The Purple-Gold Dao, on the other hand, just carelessly lumps all the many Dao lineages that exist outside the Five Virtues and Twelve Qis together, calling them 'Ancient Merging Methods.' While there's no issue with practicing them, it's a clear symbol of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao's shortsighted, shallow foundation at its origin."

"And that is why Azure Proclaimation can be both the 'sixth earth' and also Ancient Merging. There is no conflict!"
