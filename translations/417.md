# Chapter 551: Setting Out

Fei Luoya departed, hands clasped behind his back as he rode the wind, leaving the others with a relaxed view of his retreating figure. Li Qinghong had managed to appease him, and with Li Ximing and the other Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators filling the ranks, everyone dispersed, scratching their heads in bewilderment.

Li Qinghong returned to her senses and saw that only Li Wushao remained, his expression more troubled than ever. The wound on his tail stinger had yet to heal, prompting her to ask, "Is your injury serious?"

Li Wushao's hooked tail had been singed by a gray-red flame, leaving a pain that lingered, both in his body and in his spiritual sense. Occasionally, it would flare up, and the discomfort left him looking visibly pained.

Li Qinghong noticed this and inquired out of concern. Li Wushao waved his hand and replied, "Thank you for your concern, my lady... This flame appears to be Merging Fire, which merges body and spirit, harms one's essence, and even burns away lifespan— affecting the mind. All I can do is rest and recuperate."

His face was pale as he declined the medicinal pill Li Qinghong offered him, explaining politely, "Ordinary pills are ineffective against this sacred fire. During my time in the Eastern Sea, several dragons tried to devour me. They cultivate in the Converging Water method, which, like Merging Fire, worsens injuries over time with even the slightest contact. I am used to it by now and have some experience in dealing with it, so there is no need to worry."

With a grim expression, Li Wushao withdrew to heal, leaving Li Qinghong alone to descend on thunder.

"Converging Water... Merging Fire... Supreme Yin and Yang... they really do correspond one-to-one."

Li Qinghong nodded thoughtfully. Many manifestations of Metallic Essence had corresponding fruition attainments with identifiable traits. She wondered about the nature of her own Profound Thunderpool cultivation.

"Profound Thunder...? Or perhaps some kind of Celestial Thunder..."

Shaking these thoughts from her mind, Li Qinghong retreated into seclusion to train.

Half a month passed, and though Fei Luoya's subordinate, Zhu Xian, had yet to arrive, finally a group of travelers appeared in the distant sky. They were dressed in various robes and looked worn from their journey. Leading them was Li Xuanxuan, who was tugging at his beard as he rode the wind from afar.

"Granduncle!"

Li Xijun soared up to greet him, and Li Xuanxuan nodded slightly. Behind him, Chen Donghe and An Zheyan bowed in greeting.

Li Xuanxuan seemed to be in good spirits and said, "This old man went to Great Xiukui Temple and broadened his horizons significantly! That temple oversees seventy-two Dao lineages, preserving all kinds of ancient and shamanic spells, vastly different from modern techniques."

He reached into his storage pouch and drew out a few talismans. They appeared grayish with white inked symbols scrawled across them, and Li Xuanxuan beamed as he explained, "These are ancient spell talismans, infused with water essence to relieve pain and heal ailments... They will be quite useful to pass down to cultivators in the Embryonic Breathing Realm and to treat common folk."

As he spoke, he waved his hand, and the crowd dispersed. Li Xijun guided him down, while Li Xuanxuan continued speaking cheerfully about the talismans in his hand.

Li Xuanxuan's old eyes swept across the mountain, and he glimpsed the white mourning clothes draped everywhere. A momentary joy vanished from his face, which was replaced by shock. His smile disappeared, and he fell silent.

Without a word, he allowed Li Xijun to lead him to the grave, where he sat heavily on the ground, murmuring to himself, "So, it is time... he managed to hold on all these years..."

His aged eyes took in the surrounding area. To his right stood the headstone of his eldest son, Li Yuanxiu, and to his left, his youngest, Li Yuanping. One was new, the other old, and both towered above him. Sitting between them, the gravestones loomed taller than he was.

Li Xijun withdrew quietly, retreating to the edge of the mountain path before glancing back.

The elderly man was slumped between the two graves, his legs spread in the wild grass, clutching one of the talismans in his hand without realizing it, and he was staring blankly at the sky with an expression of utter smallness... and unmistakable grief.

Li Xijun could not bear to look on any longer and lowered his head as he left. Chen Donghe led a person up the path, a man in a brown Daoist robe with a vine whip tied at his waist. Chen Donghe spoke softly, "This is Senior Zhu Xian."

Li Xijun quickly composed himself. The earlier scene still lingered vividly in his memory, but he had no time to dwell on it. Forcing a smile, he greeted Zhu Xian in a soft tone, "Greetings, Senior."

Zhu Xian, one of Fei Luoya's men, had just reached the early Foundation Establishment Realm.

His cultivation lineage was weak, and although he had established an Immortal Foundation, he was still inferior to even Li Wushao before he had gained his hooked tail. The skill he cultivated, Pure Essence Wind, was an ordinary technique formed of Minor Pure Spiritual Qi.

Despite having a higher cultivation level than Li Xijun, Zhu Xian dared not act superior in his presence and spoke softly, "My senior brother has sent me here to coordinate the handover of the territory."

Fei Luoya's subordinates controlled a substantial amount of land. Although some barren areas at the edges were disregarded, the actual area was significantly larger than Eastern Mount Yue. As Li Xijun watched him spread out the map, Zhu Xian remarked, "Over these past ten or so years, my territory here has developed a population of just over fifty thousand..."

Li Xijun immediately felt a pang of surprise. On similar territory, their own Eastern Mount Yue had a population numbering in the hundreds of thousands. Such a small population in Zhu Xian's territory explained the lack of productivity.

Glancing over the map and estimating briefly, he said softly, "For this region, Senior, I propose establishing thirty towns, strategically placed along the land's spirit and earth veins. We can set up one or two immortal mountains and establish a governing system to oversee a population of three hundred thousand."

"There are two large plains here where we can establish major towns... Then, we can begin by setting up villages along the two rivers and gradually move people there."

As Li Xijun explained his plan in detail, Zhu Xian could only nod in agreement, not entirely grasping the pros and cons or understanding much of what was being discussed.

Once Li Xijun had arranged everything from start to finish, there was not much left to negotiate.

Zhu Xian had only one question.

"How much profit can this yield?" he asked.

Li Xijun calculated and answered, "After seven or eight years, annual profits could reach around twenty to thirty spirit stones, with our family taking a forty percent share."

After doing the math, Zhu Xian realized that this would meet Fei Luoya's expectations. He relaxed immediately, waving his hand in agreement, "Then let us proceed with that!"

Li Xijun then called Li Xicheng over for a thorough discussion. Zhu Xian, unable to sit still any longer, rode the wind back to report to Fei Luoya. Once Zhu Xian had left, Li Xijun asked, "Elder Brother, how much does our family have in reserves now?"

Li Xicheng replied, "Currently, we generate an annual income of over sixty spirit stones. After deducting the tribute payments, we can save less than a hundred stones every five years. Adding in the forty stones from the sale of Wanling Blossoms by Han Shizhen of the Han Family, our savings come to about one hundred and thirty spirit stones every five years."

After calculating for a bit, Li Xicheng continued, "For the past decade, we have avoided major expenses, so we have about two hundred stones in reserve after accounting for minor expenditures."

"Two hundred spirit stones—that is more than enough to set up two Qi Cultivation Realm formations... And since we are establishing these for Fei Luoya, we may even be able to extract some resources from his side."

With confidence in his plan, Li Xijun nodded and spoke softly, "Elder Brother, the expansion effort will need your coordination. We could consider moving Eastern Mount Yue westward, transferring the original dozen towns on the eastern side to be under Lijing Office. You have the insight to handle it as you see fit."

"Rest assured."

Li Xicheng's reply was steady and composed, carrying an air of authority. However, as his gaze passed over the white mourning garments, a lingering sorrow remained in his eyes.

Li Xuanfeng gathered his belongings, stepped onto his flying shuttle, and, with two Ning Family cultivators in tow, set off with his golden bow slung over his back. They flew gracefully toward the Azure Pond Sect. The two Ning Family members, having grown accustomed to traveling with him, used the journey to brief him on the clans of the nearby prefectures.

These two brothers were from a branch of the Ning Family and had followed Li Xuanfeng for over a decade, deeply respecting him. Li Xuanfeng listened absently, uninterested in lingering along the way. They glided over the landscape, arriving at the Azure Pond Sect, where he instructed them, "Go ahead and gather all those who are heading to the Eastern Sea."

He waited patiently. According to the practices of the Azure Pond Sect, most of those being sent to guard the Eastern Sea were likely cultivators with limited talents. Aside from members of the Chi and Ning families, disciples from Yuan Su, Yuanwu, and Yuan Xiu's Peaks were often assigned to the southern borders or the Eastern Sea.

He waited for a while, choosing not to enter the mountain. Instead, he seated himself in a pavilion, watching the mist drift across Mount Azure Pond. After a short time, he heard a commotion as the two Ning Family members returned, leading a group of cultivators.

The group of young men and women wore azure Daoist robes. Most of them were at the Qi Cultivation Realm, their faces filled with the fresh inexperience of novices. They lined up behind the two Ning Family members and called out in unison, "Greetings, Daoist!"

Within the Azure Pond Sect, those who held the title of Peak Master at the Foundation Establishment Realm were addressed as Peak Masters. If they lacked this title, they were simply called Daoists—after all, within the Azure Pond Sect, Foundation Establishment Realm alone was not enough to earn the title of an ancestor.

Li Xuanfeng found this a little strange. Years ago, his family had treated disciples from Azure Pond Sect with the utmost respect, not daring to defy them. He recalled his visit to Cloud Crowned Peak of the Xiao Family back then, where even a mere sect attendant could command a small clan's family head at will.

Back then, he had been a lowly archer, serving under the sect's disciples. Now, he had become a senior to the very members of Azure Pond, which made him chuckle quietly as he gave them a slight nod.

To the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realm disciples, however, Li Xuanfeng in his Black Gold Spirit Armor was an awe-inspiring sight. His armor's elegant lines and fierce expression, with eyes sharp as a hawk, seemed to emit a golden glow. Combined with the ferocious longbow hanging from his golden robe, his imposing presence was undeniable!

Just by standing there, he exuded the aura of a veteran general who had guarded the wild borders for years. His slightly hoarse voice and commanding gaze added to his formidable image, with the gleam of his golden bow making the eyes of onlookers ache.

"I heard this senior was born with immense strength, able to wrestle tigers and wolves... He comes from a distinguished sword-wielding clan, yet chose to abandon the sword and master the golden bow instead... single-handedly dispersing the clouds of demons in the Southern Border!"

The young disciples whispered among themselves, filled with admiration for the man.

Even though they were members of an immortal sect, Foundation Establishment Realm was still an uncertain achievement for many. With fierce internal competition and frequent assignments to guard distant territories, becoming someone of Li Xuanfeng's stature was no small feat.

Li Xuanfeng scanned the group; once he saw that everyone had gathered, he tapped the golden beast buckle on his belt and took out a jade ship.

Initially the size of a thumb, the spirit shuttle expanded rapidly, glowing with emerald light until it transformed into a great boat over ten zhang in length. It floated gently in the air.

"The Everflowing Jade Cloudliner."

The boat was not Li Xuanfeng's possession; rather, Ning Wan had loaned it to him. When she had heard that he had no means of transport, she had provided the ship for him to carry the dozen or so disciples across Yue State.

Since she was in seclusion cultivating her divine abilities, she had no immediate need for it and was happy to lend it to him.

The Azure Pond disciples, accustomed to seeing spirit ships, showed little surprise as they boarded. The ship was spacious enough, and the two Ning Family brothers took it upon themselves to pilot it. Li Xuanfeng stood at the front of the vessel, gazing down at the sea of clouds and peaks below.

"If only I did not have these people with me, I would not need to delay. I have to finish my current task before I can return home for a visit... Otherwise, I would have stopped by the Lake Xian area to drop by home."

He watched the clouds part and gather, light and shadow shifting as they crossed over Mount Quanwu and reached Libu Prefecture.

The elder Ning brother at the front called out, "General, up ahead is Wubu Market!"

Li Xuanfeng understood what he meant; his grand-nephew Li Xizhi was stationed there as the local guardian. However, with all the disciples on board, stopping casually could cause misunderstandings, so he replied, "Keep going... no need to stop."

"Yes!"

They obeyed and continued steering the spirit ship, while Li Xuanfeng began to adjust his breathing and focus.

He cultivated the Golden Light Edge Technique, a Grade Three technique obtained from the Ji Family, which was practiced by a branch of the Situ Family. Compared to techniques passed down among the main lineages of the immortal sects, it was somewhat lacking.

After reaching Foundation Establishment Realm, however, Ning Hemian had acquired a Grade Four manual for him from within the sect, called Golden Stone Lofty Skies Technique. It allowed him to cultivate to the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm, significantly speeding up his progress. Yet, since he had already formed his Immortal Foundation, he still could not match those who had fully cultivated the Golden Stone Lofty Skies Technique from the start.

Li Xuanfeng was rather indifferent about it; his Immortal Foundation had already been refined to its utmost limits, so a little more or less made no difference.

The Engraved Stone Dao foundation came from the Golden Tang Gate, with qi that could break through formations, split mountains, and destroy enemy artifacts. It specialized in targeting weaknesses, with its power growing stronger with each life taken, tempered by the blood qi of his fallen enemies.

And over the decades, Li Xuanfeng had slain countless foes in the Southern Border. He had suffered many wounds in his early years, but with this spirit armor, he had become even more formidable. The number of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators who had fallen by his hand had long since entered the double digits.

In his qihai acupoint, a chaotic golden-red light swirled. He had refined it to its limit two years ago, reaching a point where further refinement was impossible. His confidence came from this source, a confidence grounded in hard-won strength.

Daoist Master Yuan Su promoted me likely because of this, he thought to himself.

Over the years, Li Xuanfeng had gained insight into Daoist Master Yuan Su's intentions. Ning Tiaoxiao needed someone among the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators who was strong enough to crush any minor threats—someone who could handle matters that he himself found inconvenient to attend to.

This Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator not only needed to be exceptionally powerful and loyal but also had to be without prospects for advancement, with weaknesses Yuan Su could exploit... and perhaps even be willing to sacrifice themselves in a critical moment.

Daoist Master Yuan Su was cunning to the core—a master strategist. He had discerned Li Xuanfeng's character perfectly, not only marrying him to a woman from the clan but also placing members of the Ning Family around him, either as subordinates or as colleagues. The Ning Family members themselves did not fully realize it, yet they had already come to care for him genuinely.

"After all, he is a cultivator of several hundred years... His methods are impeccable. He does not need divine abilities or spells to manipulate people."

Clad in the Black Gold Armor that his wife had sought for him, Li Xuanfeng stood quietly, gazing deeply at the setting sun descending in front of him.

"Boss, we are leaving the prefecture!"

The elder Ning brother, his forehead slightly sweaty, turned around and grinned, flashing a set of white teeth. His younger brother looked up at Li Xuanfeng with a shy but admiring gaze.

"Got it," Li Xuanfeng replied.

The Ning brothers kept the ship steady, calling him "General" and "Boss" with utmost loyalty. Li Xuanfeng was not easily deceived, and for years, he had harbored doubts that these two were sent to monitor him. However, after several times when they had risked their lives to protect him, he had come to see them as his own people.

Now, as long as Li Xuanfeng could not, in good conscience, abandon his wife and subordinates, Yuan Su's purpose had been fulfilled. Surveying his surroundings, Li Xuanfeng saw loyalty to his clan, his wife, and his duty.

There was no other path forward but to serve Yuan Su.
