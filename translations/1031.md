# Chapter 1031: The Unfading Glory

The Heavenly Light bathed everything.

Li Ximing stood listening in the mountains for a long while without a word, hearing Li Zhouwei’s low voice continue.

"This affair is far from over. With the new dynasty established, the conflict between north and south will only intensify. The pressure on Dongfang Lieyun's side will mount, and he will need to be placated… As for the Dragon-kin… in the end, not only can they not be trusted, we may even find ourselves on opposing sides."

Finally hearing these words, a trace of helplessness flashed across Li Ximing's face.

"Does our Li Clan… truly have no place to even breathe under the Dragon-kin?"

Li Zhouwei turned his head slightly, his gaze shifting from the other man's face to the cup on the table. He shook his head.

"That's not entirely true. Success would solve everything, of course. But if we fail, the main heirs will have to be cut off. Que'Wan and the other branches, however, could still survive, just like the Cui Clan of Chongzhou."

Seeing Li Ximing’s flicker of doubt, Li Zhouwei explained, "This is why I chose to send Que'Wan away… instead of Jiangqian. She does not have the golden eyes. If we arrange things properly, and if there is even the slightest chance she might seek a Whole Pill in the future, there is profit to be made. A place for her in the Qunyi Archipelago is not impossible."

He stressed his next words, his tone heavy with conviction.

"After all, the thunder of the Lie Sea cannot be moved! I have met the Lady… she is held in extremely high regard by the Dragon-kin!"

This string of revelations gave Li Ximing pause. He considered it carefully for a time and saw the logic in it. With a sigh, he nodded.

"I can only hope that our aunt’s words carry weight before the Dragon Monarch."

"It's the Golden Feather Sect that will likely cause trouble in the future!"

Li Zhouwei didn't dwell on it, instead recounting his experiences in Chongzhou and presenting the Art of the Perfected Sleeve Residence to Li Ximing. Before Li Ximing could examine it, he suddenly frowned and asked,

"I've heard of the great prestige of that lord from the Golden Feather Sect. If he truly rose from the bones of the fallen Wei… he certainly wouldn't want to see the Wei Emperor cling to life. He might even have designs on you… as for whether he would help…"

Li Zhouwei shook his head. "One cannot overestimate that lord’s schemes. Who knows if the Golden Feather Sect's actions toward our family over the years have just been them placing their pieces on the board. As for your assertion that he rose from the ashes of the Wei… I don't think that's quite right. From the descriptions of his age, it seems more likely he was already in a position of power. The fall of the Great Wei was merely a ritual he used to legitimize his name."

"A ritual to legitimize his name…"

The bluntness of the statement silenced Li Ximing. He looked at his junior’s blazing eyes, his heart pounding.

'He means… the Geng-Dui shift…'

If a True Hornless Dragon could possess a technique like Refining Pristine Water into Converging Water, then it was highly probable that the Geng-Dui shift was caused by this True Monarch Taiyuan. A shift of such magnitude, affecting nearly all of the popular Geng-Dui spiritual materials of the current age, was a testament to the True Monarch’s profound influence on the world and his mastery over Fruition Attainment!

'The Geng-Dui shift… logically, there should be two figures involved. If this one is Dui, the other is likely Geng… I can't even imagine what era such a person would be from…'

He dared not say more and quickly changed the subject.

"You're right. Tianhuo still owes me a favor, though I can't tell if that was intentional. The more I think about it, the more it looks like a convenient excuse for him to act on our family's behalf… The attitudes of these exalted figures… the signs were there all along."

The younger man let the topic drop and smiled.

"But now, I have some good news."

Li Zhouwei retrieved a box from his sleeve and placed it on the table.

"This is Soul-Listening Purple Intent Qi."

Li Ximing lowered his gaze and saw the hazy purple qi swirling in dense layers within the box.

"I obtained this from Minghui," Li Zhouwei said.

"It can aid in achieving a breakthrough with a divine ability. I prepared it especially for you, Uncle… I estimate it's not much different from a Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill. Since you've come out of seclusion, your immortal foundation must be complete. This is the perfect time to consume it."

"This…"

Li Ximing was momentarily stunned. He picked it up to inspect it, frowning.

"This is a wonderful item, but I wonder if it can be used together with the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill. They should be combined to help you break through to the Purple Mystery stage…"

Li Zhouwei shook his head with a smile. "If the situation allows, it would be best if the immortal threshold of Purple Mystery holds me back for a while. I need more time to plan. I have no use for these things. You should take it, Uncle. Your breakthrough is what truly matters."

"I have no hope of reaching Purple Mystery anymore!" Li Ximing sighed.

"I understand your meaning, but we must watch how the situation between the two sides develops. If they conspire to bring slaughter upon the lake, and you don't break through, people will surely die."

Li Zhouwei fell silent. He watched his uncle put the spiritual item away before continuing,

"We had already agreed on an exchange. I never expected that right after I returned to the lake, a certain Daoist Master Liaoluo from Mount Qusi would arrive. The Crane-Embrace Stone was in the clan treasury, so I took the Soul-Listening Purple Intent Qi and had him deliver the stone."

With a flip of his hand, he produced a lustrous pearl. It shimmered with a golden, glass-like radiance that carried a mesmerizing power. After letting Li Ximing have a good look, the young man grinned.

"Now this is a real treasure!"

"Hm?"

Li Ximing's eyebrows shot up in astonishment.

"Blazing Fire?"

As a master of fire control, Li Ximing’s face lit up with delight. He used his spiritual sense to examine the pearl, only speaking after a long moment.

"It looks like Radiant Crimson Fiendfire. It's a derivative of Blazing Fire that has lost its harmonious essence. It's born from Earth Fire Baleful Qi—a killing flame that seizes heat, making it an excellent spiritual fire for combat. It’s quite valuable… but the Buddhist cultivators have tampered with it, adding this dazzling, disorienting aura, which has ruined its purity."

He grew suspicious.

"Minghui gave this to you? He must want something!"

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"First, there's the matter of your Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood, Uncle. Second, he wants protection for his physical body when he heads south. But he doesn't seem honest. He’s still plotting something."

This prompted the Daoist to rise and pace around the mountain clearing. He couldn't bear to part with the spiritual fire in his hand.

"Nothing good comes for free," he said seriously.

"He definitely has an ulterior motive. This whole affair with the Crane-Embrace Stone might be part of his scheme."

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"The Lotus Temple has kept to itself for so many years; they must have a plan. I've already considered it. We can't keep the Radiant Crimson Fiendfire… I'll first try the Intercalary Sun Art on it. If that doesn't work, I'll have to find a fire-virtue cultivator or two to trade it with."

Li Ximing nodded in deep agreement. He channeled a wisp of his divine ability, pinching out a tiny glimmer of flame from it. Holding it on his fingertip, he performed a quick divination. After a moment, he shook his head with some hesitation.

"The Intercalary Sun Art is primarily based on the True Conjoined Triple Fire, while Radiant Crimson Fiendfire is a type of Blazing Fire. My divination… despite the interference from the Buddhist cultivator's aura, is probably accurate enough—it doesn't seem to be something that can be handled with mere spell arts…"

He retracted his divine ability, musing, "We could have asked Daoist Master Junjian about this. He cultivates fire-virtue and has many treasures, making him the most suitable person. But I've inquired several times; he's been seeking the Dao in the Feather-Shedding Land for years and hasn't returned south… Thinking about it now, he probably wants to avoid getting dragged into the mess in Yue State."

"Now that Guo Nanwu is here, we could ask him to inquire about Poluoduo's Spirit Sparrow, Huo Yang…"

Li Ximing hesitated, then shook his head. "It’s a pity… The Buddhist cultivators modified it with their strange arts, turning it into this bizarre hybrid. If we want to change it back, we'd have to pour more spiritual resources into it. The best course of action would be to negotiate and have them take it back to refine and purify it themselves."

While he was lost in thought, Li Zhouwei asked a sharp question.

"Guo Nanwu?"

Li Zhouwei frowned as he listened to Li Ximing explain the situation, the news causing the golden-eyed man to stand up and ponder for a long time.

"So that's why the Daoist Master from Mount Qusi was so enthusiastic…"

He finally looked up after a while, a smile playing on his lips.

"A good scheme. Quite audacious."

Li Ximing shook his head with a helpless expression as he heard Li Zhouwei continue with a laugh,

"Our family is bound to have advantages in the future. They, on the other hand, have lost the Supreme Yang Radiance and are in an awkward position. They need to survive this chaotic era. Their old master certainly has a keen eye, but they will have to remain conservative for these thirty years."

"Even if I, Li Zhouwei, die while failing to attain a higher station, my ambition will last longer than a mere thirty years."

"Do you think I don't know that?" Li Ximing replied. "Kuang Yu explained it to me long ago. Their old master doesn't have much time left. This alliance is mutually beneficial. My agreement with Guo Nanwu today was a matter of necessity for both sides… At the very least, it will save us a lot of trouble."

"As for the thirty years… it's just a probe to test the waters."

Li Zhouwei nodded discreetly, then smiled.

"That's perfect. I rushed back and haven't had time to go to Southern Songzhou Luoshe. If this person is trustworthy, we can have him handle it along the way."

Li Ximing's expression turned serious.

"There is also the matter of Qingyan… but while Mount Qusi may be trustworthy, Guo Nanwu isn't necessarily so. We have no influence in the Southern Sea and no way to watch over his clan. Besides… he is a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. If he decides to cast aside all face, he could escape and hide anywhere in the world. How would we ever find him again? Let's entrust him with small matters first, to test his character."

Seeing that Li Ximing had a clear plan, Li Zhouwei relaxed. But then Li Ximing shook his head.

"There is one thing that has been bothering me… Back when I cultivated a secret art, I was able to draw upon the revelations from the Spiritual Treasure, the Huai River Map, which was of great benefit… So today, when Jiangqian was cultivating, I brought over the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument."

A look of puzzlement crossed his face.

"But… the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument offered almost no assistance to his cultivation…"

Li Zhouwei had completed his own secret art cultivation in one go and had never considered the role of Spiritual Treasures. Now, however, his Dao-Profundity was considerable.

He thought for a moment and replied, "I have also seen that Spiritual Treasure. The Huai River Map is no ordinary item. It wasn't originally a top-grade treasure, but it bears the calligraphy of High Radiance True Monarch, which grants it its profound mystery…"

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. He feigned a grin through gritted teeth. 

"Sooner or later, I'm going to get my hands on that thing!"

Li Zhouwei laughed and shook his head before asking, "Have you looked into the matter of the Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light, Uncle?"

"That is a priority. It cannot be forgotten!"

Li Ximing smiled.

"The Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light… the scrolls state that one must gather the 'Qi of Condescending Radiance.' This requires a place steeped in the aura of a clan's venerable authority or an emperor's might. It could be a place of noble defeat, where spears lie broken in the sand, or a Celestial Hall where a mandate was received to cleanse a deep-seated grudge. Then, ten thousand armored men must pay homage, and with the aid of the Bright Yang heavens, it would still take half a year to gather a single wisp."

This gave Li Zhouwei pause. He frowned. "It requires such an ordeal?"

Li Ximing's expression, however, was peculiar. "Not necessarily. I've used my divine ability to investigate and have sent men to each location. Here at our grand Moongaze Lake, there are no less than four mountains and Celestial Halls that qualify. Even… even the north shore has one."

Li Zhouwei nodded at once. "That makes sense… Moongaze Lake is drenched in a century of blood and tears. It has earned that right."

Li Ximing, lost in his thoughts, continued, "After weighing the options, I decided the imperial qi would be stronger than the others. The Grand Jue Court was the seat of generations of kings; it is nobler and more convenient than the other locations. So, I have begun gathering the qi there."

"By my calculations, it will take no more than three or four years."

Li Zhouwei was in no hurry. His cultivation speed was astonishingly fast, and he had only recently mastered Sovereign's Perilous Tread. Pushing too hard and forging one divine ability after another would be too much even for him. He simply nodded.

"Thank you for your trouble, Uncle."

A complex look appeared on Li Ximing’s face.

"Actually… the Meichi Mountain behind our ancestral land… that could also be used. But it was never a treasure ground, and its qi is somewhat stagnant. Gathering it there would likely not be smooth."

"That place… it is where Lord Tongya, the ancestor of the Second Branch… fell. It was my second uncle who received the mandate…"

This silenced Li Zhouwei for a moment.

"Minghuang has sworn to kill Can Lufu," he stated flatly.

"Ai!"

Ever since the breakthrough at Changxiao, Li Ximing's mind had been troubled. The matter of the Dragon-kin had frayed his nerves, and now this single sentence made him choke up with emotion.

"This… this situation, when will it end? It feels like we are thriving in a raging fire, yet there are gods watching from above, making things difficult at every turn. And you, my boy, you are burdened with thoughts of the Demon King in the Southern Borderlands…"

Li Zhouwei silently shook his head.

"Uncle… that's not the right way to see it. Even if I, Zhouwei, am swept up in the tides of the world, the grudges of our ancestors must be avenged! If I find myself powerless, I will face death with resolve. This vengeance will then be left for future generations to carry out."

His words seemed to comfort Li Ximing, who took them as a promise. He sighed softly, his expression even more melancholic. Shaking off the sentiment, he stood and put away the Soul-Listening Purple Intent Qi.

"I will go into meditation now. The success of my divine ability rests on this! I cannot afford to be complacent."

Li Zhouwei nodded and saw him off. Only then did he stand alone amidst a cascade of falling flower petals, a sudden silence enveloping him.

The golden-eyed young man clasped his hands behind his back and paced, his gaze turning to ice.

'In the past, I felt the my sons could not survive, so I refused them be entered into the clan registry. But now… I fear the entire clan could be annihilated in an instant!'

He gently extended a hand. His sleeves, embroidered with golden patterns, shimmered in the Heavenly Light as a few gardenia petals drifted into his palm.

'Uncle… there will be no future generations left to carry out this vengeance. I will kill Can Lufu because everything I bear, everything I hold to, must end with me. What I, Zhouwei, am fighting for is not the past, nor the present, nor for three or ten generations, but for a glory that will not fade for ten thousand generations.'

'It's been nearly two thousand years… The Bright Yang Dao is unstable, locked in a feud with the powers above. It's a Dao that Mount Luoxia has invested almost two millennia of effort into. It cannot tolerate another shred of instability.'

'I don't believe that Mount Luoxia and the Dragon-kin have no plans for Bright Yang. I don't believe the Dragon Palace and the powers above lack their own grand cultivators of the Bright Yang Dao. There is no turning back on this path. The father has fallen. If the son does not take his seat, someone else will. Even if they can't hold it securely, they will sit at its edge, waiting with ambition. Whether others can take the seat or not, as long as they still desire it, is there any hope of survival for the son?'

'After all…'

He murmured to himself with a self-deprecating smile, "As long as the throne is occupied, does it matter by whom?"

_Rustle…_

A gentle breeze swept through the mountains, carrying away the white flowers from his palm. The young man had already vanished, leaving only the swirling petals and the utter stillness of the immortal mountain under the Heavenly Light. Slowly, the great formation sealed itself, freezing everything in the past.

Within the mountains, the Heavenly Light was silent. But to the east, the clouds roiled without cease, coalescing into alternating forms of intertwined serpents, water, and fire. The glow of Merging Fire grew dimmer and dimmer, soon driven back to the north.
