# Chapter 16: Tragic Fate

Li Changhu barely had time to react as the youth lifted the leather around his waist, revealing a knife that glinted ominously with a cold light.

The youth’s eyes, fierce and sharp like a wild beast’s, were fixed unblinkingly on Li Changhu with alarming intensity.

His knife moved with lightning speed, aiming straight for Li Changhu’s throat. Li Changhu barely had time to recoil in shock, his hands moving in a desperate attempt to block the attack.

He was moving at the speed of lightning!

He had honed this particular stabbing motion for over twenty-two years and practiced on countless haystacks; it was fueled by years of repressed hatred.

The knife, gleaming like a bolt of silver lightning, nimbly evaded Li Changhu’s defensive arms and impaled his throat.

Li Changhu could only utter a few agonized groans before collapsing to the ground. His vision blurred, and the sounds of the surrounding screams and shouts of anger filled the air.

“BASTARD!” Tian Shoushui, standing behind Li Changhu, bellowed in rage and disbelief.

Tian Shoushui, obscured by the crowd due to his shorter stature, had not fully grasped the unfolding situation until he saw Li Changhu collapse.

Tian Shoushui lunged to grab the youth, his eyes burning with rage and the veins at his temples throbbing.

However, the youth, though successful in his attack, abandoned the knife and used the ensuing chaos to roll away from Tian Shoushui’s grasp. He moved with the agility of a deer, swiftly disappearing into the mass of refugees.

Tian Shoushui pursued, but the refugees scattered in panic, giving the youth just enough time to slip into the nearby reeds and vanish.

“DAMN IT!”

Determined, Tian Shoushui plunged into the reeds without a second glance, leaving behind the refugees huddled together in fear.

“Goddamn it! He brought disaster upon us!”

The middle-aged man who was previously speaking for the refugees was now cornered by the villagers.

“I have nothing to do with this! I don’t know that young man! He just came with us!” he wailed, but his protests were drowned out by the commotion.

“SHUT UP!” Liu Linfeng screamed, his face a mixture of rage and shock.

He gritted his teeth and kneeled down to support Li Changhu, who lay motionless and bleeding on the ground. Liu Linfeng struggled to contain his anger, glaring fiercely at the middle-aged man.

Seeing his nephew in such a state, Liu Linfeng’s mind raced. How would he explain this to his younger sister? To Li Mutian? His nephew had died right before his eyes!

Ren Ping’an sat on the ground, overwhelmed by grief. His daughter had married Li Changhu and was expecting their child. Now, he had to witness Li Changhu—the child he had watched grow up, dying right before his very eyes.

Panic enveloped the crowd. On the ground, Li Changhu lay with his eyes open, staring at the sky and feeling the warmth of his blood as it flowed from his chest. His consciousness started to fade.

I feel bad for Xiangping... My funeral will have to come before his wedding, Li Changhu thought despairingly as the pain and suffocation enveloped him, pulling him into an abyss of darkness.

In the midst of the turmoil, a faint silver light unseen by all rose from his dantian. It spiraled upward like a swallow soaring into the sky, circling for a moment before flying toward the Li Family’s backyard.

Not far from the scene, Old Xu stood trembling, witnessing the youth plunging the knife into Li Changhu’s throat, the blade protruding slightly from the back of his neck. A rush of blood surged to his head, blackness clouding his vision as he nearly collapsed.

“How terribly unfortunate!” Tears streamed down his aged face as he held the string of grass crickets he had intended to give to Li Changhu and clutched his chest in anguish.

“That bastard...” Gasping for breath, Old Xu wiped his tears and started running toward the back mountain, muttering to himself, “I’ve lived through too much—the death of my wife, the downfall of the main family. I’ve dealt with scoundrels far worse than you. Just you wait! This old man will make sure you pay for this!”

————

At the ancestral hall in the Li Residence, Lu Jiangxian sighed quietly.

He had awoken the instant Li Changhu was assassinated, but he was too far away to do anything about it. All he could do was watch as the tragedy unfolded.

As he observed the silver light fluttering around the mirror like a butterfly, he knew that with just a thought, this talisman seed could transform into pure essence, nourishing his divine soul.

However, since Li Changhu had not reached the Profound Scenery stage yet, the talisman seed would not do him much good.

With a sigh, Lu Jiangxian reversed his immortal technique. Using the “Profound Pearl Sacrificial Spirit Art”, he catalyzed the spiritual sense within the talisman seed. A stream of mana, extracted from the seed, manifested in the courtyard and extended toward the Li Family members.

Li Mutian had been restless, taking over two hours to drift into a fitful sleep. But then, he saw moonlight pouring through the windows and doorways, illuminating the room as if it were daylight. There, standing quietly by his bedside, was his eldest son, Li Changhu.

“What happened?” Li Mutian asked hoarsely.

Li Changhu remained silent, his gaze intently fixed on Li Mutian’s face, as if committing every detail to memory.

Li Mutian coughed harshly and asked with a furrowed brow, “What is it, Changhu?”

Li Changhu then leaned down, bowing deeply to his father.

“Take care, Father...” he said, his voice choked with emotion.

As he spoke, his figure began to disperse, fading like grains of sand in the wind. The luminous moonlight slowly dimmed, and the room, once bright as day, returned to darkness.

Li Mutian, in a state of shock, reached out desperately and shouted uncontrollably, “Speak to me, son! Changhu! Li Changhu!”

He bolted out of bed, gazing out the window in disbelief.

————

“Does cultivation also bring dreams?” Li Chejing, with tears still on his face, awoke in the side house.

He rose and walked outside, where he found Li Tongya seated at the wooden table.

Upon seeing his younger brother, Li Tongya quickly wiped away his tears and forced a smile. “What’s the matter?” he asked.

Li Chejing, however, just stared blankly at him and then looked up to ask, “Where’s Big Brother?”

“He was called out this morning by a tenant. Maybe something happened in the fields,” Li Tongya replied, trying to maintain his smile.

Just then, the door opened with a creak. Li Mutian appeared, looking visibly unsettled.

“Tongya! Go get your big brother... No. Never mind, I’ll go myself.”

Quickly slipping on his shoes, Li Mutian hastened to the front yard. As he opened the gate, he was met with a surprising sight.

A large group of villagers had gathered outside, all holding torches and with tears streaming down their faces. At the foot of the stone steps, three people knelt beside something covered by a piece of white fabric.

The sight of Tian Shoushui and Ren Ping’an’s grief-stricken expressions sent a wave of dread through Li Mutian. With shaking hands, he descended the steps, gently pushing past the tearful Liu Linfeng to lift the white fabric.

At the sight underneath, Li Mutian’s vision immediately darkened and he nearly fainted. His brothers, who had followed him out, also looked on with apprehension.

Li Chejing stepped forward, and upon seeing what lay beneath the cloth, he collapsed to his knees, crying out in anguish, “BIG BROTHER!”

He leaned over Li Changhu’s body, checking to see if he was still breathing.

Suddenly, Li Chejing jerked his head up, tears streaming down his face as he looked around at the villagers and demanded in a stern, roaring voice, “WHO DID THIS? WHO?”

His outcry, like the roar of a tiger, startled everyone, causing them to step back in fear.

Ye Chengfu, who was holding a torch amidst the crowd, paused as he witnessed Li Chejing’s youthful face contorted with anger.

He stroked his chin thoughtfully and mused, The fourth son seems like a tough character. With the forgiving leader of the pack gone and the remaining three being cunning and vicious, it won’t take long before the Li Family has complete dominance over Lijing Village!

The crowd fell silent for a moment before someone murmured in response, “Changhu was killed by the refugees!”

Li Xiangping knelt beside Li Changhu, fighting back his tears.

He turned his head to look at Tian Shoushui and asked with a trembling voice, “Uncle Tian, what happened?”

“It’s likely the descendant of the Yuan Family,” Li Mutian answered instead, squeezing the words through his gritted teeth.

He cast a glance at Tian Shoushui who hung his head in silence, as well as the gathered villagers, and shouted, “Tongya!”

At his call, Li Tongya stepped forward, wiping his tears. He cupped his fist to the villagers and announced, “Thank you for your concern tonight. Please disperse for now. There’s no need to linger around any longer.”

After his announcement, he helped Liu Linfeng up and whispered in his ear, “Please, Uncle, have your people keep an eye on those refugees. We don’t want anyone causing trouble amidst the confusion. We’ll join you shortly.”

“Right, of course...” Liu Linfeng, who was kneeling before Li Mutian, seemed overwhelmed with the weight of the moment. Gratefully accepting the instruction, he quickly led the villagers away.

Tian Shoushui and Ren Ping’an carried Li Changhu’s body to the Li Family’s backyard.

Meanwhile, cries erupted from the main courtyard. Ren Ping’er had fainted upon hearing the tragic news. Tian Yun and Liu Linfeng, holding back their tears, attended to her, with one rushing to fetch a physician.

Tian Shoushui set Li Changhu down, his eyes brimming with tears.

“Brother Tianmu...” He was about to speak when Li Mutian, visibly exhausted, waved him off.

“Ping’an, go look after Ping’er. Shoushui, accompany Liu Linfeng and keep an eye on the refugees. I fear he might be in a difficult position without direction from the Li Family.”

“Understood,” Tian Shoushui replied, wiping away his tears before leaving. Ren Ping’an nodded in a daze, then departed to care for Ren Ping’er.

With no outsiders remaining in the backyard, the remaining Li brothers sobbed quietly.

Unable to contain his anguish any longer, Li Mutian sat beside his eldest son like a wounded lone wolf, his wails low and heart-wrenching.

“Oh, Changhu...”

The brothers joined in the mourning. Li Tongya and Li Xiangping wept silently, trying to maintain composure, while the younger Li Chejing gave in to his emotions, crying without restraint.

————

In the dead of night, Lijing Village was in disarray. Old Xu, armed only with a hoe, ventured alone to the back mountain. He navigated the winding path, his gaze fixed on the overgrown weeds and the continuous stretch of tombs ahead.

Pausing, he focused his gaze and spotted a ragged youth with leather wrapped around his waist. He was leisurely seated beside a small gravestone, speaking to himself.

As Old Xu approached, the youth looked up sharply. Recognizing the visitor as an elderly farmer, he clapped his hands, tilted his head to the side, and smiled.

“Where are you from, old man?” he asked.

Ignoring the question, Old Xu moved deliberately slow, trembling as he approached. He pretended to be cautious, then knelt beside a tombstone, holding it while sobbing quietly.

The youth listened, his interest piqued by words of revenge and peace for the head of the family.

His life had been scarred by tragedy. From a young age, he lived as a tenant ever since his family was destroyed. Night after night, he had practiced with a dagger, driven by the hope of avenging his parents by taking Li Mutian's life.

Having exacted partial revenge, he was eager to share his triumph, yet had no one to turn to. Perhaps, he mused, ending this old man’s life would be a fitting conclusion to his visit.

“You’re here mourning at the Yuan Family’s tomb. Aren’t you afraid of offending the Li Family?” he chuckled.

“My days are numbered...” Old Xu replied, wiping away his tears.

He looked at the youth closely and then pretended to recognize him. He gasped and fell to his knees as he exclaimed, “Young Master!”

The youth was taken aback, wondering internally, “Has this old man seen me in the village? Maybe it’s safer to just kill him before I leave.”

With tears still welling in his eyes, Old Xu continued, “Your mother often brought you to the fields. I remember you—you have three black moles on your ankle.”

Having lived for over seventy years, Xu’s experience made him a good actor. His revelation momentarily diffused the youth's hostility.

“Do you remember what my mother looked like?” the youth asked, his voice tinged with urgency.

“Yes, I remember her.”

Old Xu fetched a branch from a nearby bush. He then used his hoe to loosen the soil and started to draw with care and attention.

Meanwhile, the youth, engulfed in a storm of emotions, observed Old Xu closely. His thoughts flickered between killing the old man and considering holding him captive to learn more about his mother.

It did not take long for Old Xu to finish his drawing. Although just a farmer, Old Xu often painted door gods and auspicious symbols for the villagers.

Over the years, he had developed a certain skill in artistry, and the figure he sketched now was surprisingly life-like.

“Mother!”

The youth rolled over and knelt to examine the drawing. Seeing the familiar yet vague features of his mother, he broke down, sobbing. Twenty-two years of pent-up anger and repression burst forth, and he wept uncontrollably.

Old Xu, standing nearby, spoke fondly of the youth’s mother, fueling the young man’s overwhelming emotions.

“I remember your father well, too. Let me draw him for you,” Old Xu offered, his words convincing the youth further.

As the youth wiped away his tears, Old Xu picked up his hoe again, appearing to loosen the soil for more drawing.

Yet, there was a flash of ruthlessness in his eyes. He raised the hoe high, its silver blade glinting in the moonlight, and brought it down violently toward the youth’s neck.

The young man, exhausted from a day of evading capture, his assassination of Li Changhu, and his subsequent escape from Tian Shoushui in the reeds, was caught completely off guard.

His emotions had dulled his agility, leaving him unable to react or escape, resulting in the hoe striking him squarely.

Old Xu, still robust from years of farming, delivered a powerful blow that left the youth crumpled on the ground, convulsing, and foaming at the mouth.

Without hesitation, Old Xu struck again and again, ensuring that the youth was dead for good.

Blood and gore mingled in a macabre scene. Once Old Xu was certain that the youth was dead, he finally ceased his assault. The youth lay motionless on the ground, with an expression of sorrow in his last moments.

Exhausted and overwhelmed, Old Xu collapsed to the ground, his hands covering his face as he cried out in anguish.

“Oh, what a tragic fate! What a tragic fate...”
