# Chapter 992: The Matter of Cultivation

Yehui had mentioned Hengzhu's situation in the past, so Li Ximing already understood. He remained silent for a moment before Xiao Chuting spoke in a gentle tone:

"Sometimes, even when success seems certain, it becomes impossible if the timing or the identity is wrong. Do you remember Duanmu Kui?"

Li Ximing nodded silently, noting the unreadable expression on Xiao Chuting's face as he continued:

"It cannot be done... The 'Shaman-Register' cannot be achieved. The master of the house may leave the grand hall, he may venture out to attend to his affairs, but he still returns to check now and then. How could he possibly allow someone else to take what is his? A seat belongs to its rightful owner, after all."

"Conversely, it is the other seats, the ones the great families are trying to destabilize... those are the ones worth fighting for."

A knot tightened in Li Ximing's chest. He couldn't decipher the man's true meaning, and a chill crept through him. He listened as the man before him continued:

"Whether it's the 'Purple Qi' adept from Purple Smoke, or the 'Whole Pill' master from Golden Feather, or even Dantai from overseas, Huangyu of the Northern Sea, Hengli from Hengzhu, and that master-disciple pair, Yuanshang, from the Eastern Sea... all of them are waiting for the day of 'True Qi'. They are all waiting for the True Qi result."

His pupils dilated slightly, and in a voice barely above a whisper, he added:

"Of course... that also includes Chi Buzi."

"Chi Buzi..."

Li Ximing hadn't thought of that name in years. Even now, its mere recollection sent a shiver down his spine. He pushed the unsettling feeling down, raised an eyebrow, and said in a low voice:

"I'm afraid you're waiting too, Senior..."

Xiao Chuting merely chuckled, offering no reply.

Li Ximing asked a few more questions, but soon signaled his intention to leave. Xiao Chuting regarded him for a long moment before finally speaking.

"Be cautious in who you befriend and who you shelter."

Li Ximing quickly agreed. He rose into the air as a streak of light and departed Mount Pai'er. He was just preparing to shift into the Great Void to return home when he spotted a flash of green on a remote, icy peak in the distance.

The green color seemed to possess a strange allure, instantly capturing his attention. Li Ximing focused on it, only to see the patch of color leap into the air and plummet like a falling star. The fall ended with a sickening, muffled thud of flesh and blood.

Finding the incident bizarre, he stepped through the air to investigate. Only then did he see that the green object was an ape. It had fallen from the ice mountain and been utterly destroyed on impact. Its skin was split open and flesh torn, and blood pooled on the ground, revealing the stark white of its bones. It was already dead.

The ape's cultivation had clearly not been shallow, yet even in death, its jaws were clamped tightly around a single, vibrant green herb. It must have been gathering medicinal plants when it slipped from the heights, falling to its doom.

Li Ximing studied the scene for a second longer, a sense of dread washing over him. He quickly turned away, schooling his features. Ignoring the corpse on the ground, he tore open a path into the Great Void and vanished.

...

Wanling Heaven.

The sky and earth were dim, the land itself fractured. Pale white storms scourged the realm. Whether it was the magnificent palaces or the fluttering feather decorations, all had faded, leaving behind only a stark, colorless white.

"Wanling Heaven... is already linked to the Underworld..."

The realm was disintegrating. Massive chunks of land, dragging shattered mountainsides with them, broke away and scattered. They tore free from the gray-white expanse, briefly appearing in the Great Void before plummeting back to the mortal world, crashing down to become new ruins upon the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter.

On the pale, barren land, a man in white robes could still be seen, moving like a tiny ant among the mountains. He stopped from time to time, his gaze sweeping the desolation.

"The Profound Foundation is shattered. Unless the original master of Wanling Heaven is resurrected, no one can save this place!"

Lu Jiangxian strode over piles of bones. His divine sense swept out, instantly collecting the crystal-clear jade slips buried deep within the ruins. He had no interest in reading the techniques and methods recorded inside, however. He continued forward, staring into the gray-white Exiled Wind and sighing inwardly:

'A Grotto-Heaven is nourished by Pure Qi in its prime. When it perishes, it is claimed by Exiled Qi. A beginning and an end.'

When a Grotto-Heaven is masterless and its Fruition Attainment does not manifest, it can hide beyond the Great Void, undetected by True Monarchs. This is firstly because it remains linked to the status of its Fruition Attainment, and secondly, because it aligns with the 'Exiled Qi' symbol of the Lord of Obscurity and Gloom, granting it greater secrecy. But when the Grotto-Heaven finally perishes, that 'Exiled Qi', no longer tempered by the Fruition Attainment, reveals its fangs. It resonates with the dying realm and drags it all the way down into the Underworld.

Once this process begins, a gray-white 'Positional Exiled Wind' emerges, draining all things of their color. Even experts at the Purple Mansion Realm cannot withstand it and are forced to flee. When they turn back to search, the origin point is gone; the Grotto-Heaven ruins, now bound to 'Exiled Qi', are nowhere to be found.

They can only see the few broken mountain peaks that fall out of the 'Positional Exiled Wind' and into the Great Void. With nothing to support them, these fragments immediately plummet into the mortal world.

This was the first time Lu Jiangxian had witnessed such a catastrophic Grotto-Heaven collapse. When Anhuai Heaven fell, no True Monarchs had interfered; its Profound Foundation remained intact, and it descended peacefully into the Underworld, leaving few ruins behind. But Wanling Heaven's fate was similar to that of the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven, only far more tragic. The assembled True Monarchs had unleashed their Dharma Treasures without mercy, shattering the realm's entire Profound Foundation. There was no telling how many new mountains of debris this would add to the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter.

His expression was complicated. He looked up, and within the roiling Exiled Wind, he saw an object. Though it was bound by layer upon layer of divine abilities, it was still faintly twitching.

"The Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book..."

The True Monarchs were combining their power, using the moment Wanling Heaven linked with the Exiled Qi. They were willing to abandon even the Lingyang Immutable Palace, all to cast the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book deep into the untraceable, unfathomable 'Exiled Qi' that resides within the Underworld!

'The Lord of 'Heaven–Governing' is a being who can turn the world upside down, and the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book is the very tool to do it. They absolutely cannot allow this thing to return to its Fruition Attainment. Once that Fruition Attainment finds a new master, it would be enough to disrupt all their current schemes! Their only choice is to suppress the book. That way, even if the 'Heaven–Governing' master returns, they will have bought enough time to keep them in check!'

'But these True Monarchs know full well that the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book cannot truly be suppressed. Even with Wanling Heaven acting as an outer cage and the Lingyang Immutable Palace as an inner one, Liu Changdie still emerged...'

Lu Jiangxian's expression was icy, his thoughts perfectly clear:

"In truth, it wasn't just Liu Changdie. There were others like him. The master of Wanling Heaven's ultimate contingency was the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book. Besides the part where I interfered, there must have been other failsafes. The moment Wanling Heaven was breached, a man named Lin Hengjiang answered the call of the book and the 'Heaven–Governing' Fruition Attainment, spontaneously awakening his Shengyang Acupoint... Not to mention the several streaks of silver light that erupted from various locations and fell upon the world."

"Although that Lin Hengjiang is no longer the man he once was, and although he is only at the Purple Mansion Realm, and although these events aren't enough to cause any major waves... they are still variables."

"And the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book will, in the end, overcome the Lingyang Immutable Palace. If they rely only on the palace to suppress it, the book will eventually calculate all its loopholes and reverse the suppression. These variables will only multiply and grow stronger, until finally, they give birth to the true Lord of 'Heaven–Governing'!"

"Neither Luoxia, the Dragon-kin, nor the Underworld likes variables—to say nothing of the various True Monarchs, great and small, who plotted Wanling Heaven's downfall. The current variables are tolerable. They can even be used to unearth more of the Encompassing Profoundity legacy. That's why they allowed Lin Hengjiang to act, and why they permitted so many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to enter. But no matter what, they cannot let the situation develop unchecked!"

Lu Jiangxian had been standing here all along, so he saw everything with perfect clarity. He watched with a cold, detached gaze.

"Not a single True Monarch is willing to sacrifice their own future or gamble their position to personally suppress this artifact. That is why they must send it to the Underworld. Only the 'Exiled Qi' Fruition Attainment can, without any outside help, completely suppress the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book of the 'Heaven–Governing Rank Designation' and prevent its escape!"

"The Underworld, which resides within the 'Exiled Qi', certainly knows of this plan. And they certainly support it."

In the few days that Li Zhouwei and the others had been fighting within the Grotto-Heaven, Lu Jiangxian had already used the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book to divine 1,891 possible futures.

One of his reasons for standing here was to use these last moments to continue those divinations.

In each of these 1,891 futures, Lu Jiangxian had silently tried to influence events, testing one possibility after another, only to be met with silence every time. He continued until the very last moment, when the True Monarchs collectively seized the Dharma Treasure, and all that remained for him was that same, grim silence.

One thousand, eight hundred and eighty-four of those futures ended in a sea of blood: the complete annihilation of the Li Clan.

There were, broadly, three paths.

First, siding with Luoxia. This accounted for 807 variations. Though the details differed, the main outcome remained largely unchanged.

Li Zhouwei is besieged in Weidu Prefecture within the Zhao State. Surrounded by armies, he is forced to make a desperate attempt to attain the Fruition Attainment. The Second Manifestation immediately appears in the heavens. He perishes three days later. A rain of light fills the sky, the Heavenly Light falls into chaos, and the Supreme Yang shines, yet gives no illumination... The Bright Yang is shaken, and the world is thrown into turmoil.

In the same year, soldiers from Shu conquer Moongaze. An immortal edict arrives, ordering the execution of three branches of the clan.

Fewer members of the Li Clan are left alive and breathing than before Li Mutian first joined the army.

In 519 of these futures, a fair number of the Li family actually survived. The turning point in these scenarios was not Li Zhouwei or Li Ximing, but someone Lu Jiangxian had not expected: Li Xizhi.

In these 519 scenarios, the Li Clan ultimately compromised with Luoxia. The north fell into chaos. Li Xizhi went to cultivate at Mount Luoxia, where his Dao-Profundity was exploited by a True Monarch. When Li Zhouwei died attempting to reach the Fruition Attainment, it wasn't Shu soldiers who arrived, but forces from the north. They came with an immortal edict, sparing a few survivors at Moongaze Lake and allowing Li Zhouming to take them to the Southern Borderlands.

Li Xizhi cultivated for many years before suddenly perishing. Li Zhouming died of illness thirteen years later. Xia Shouyu led the clan for seventy-nine years, until the day Liu Changdie and Fuxun were killed by the White Victory Palace. Then, the entire clan was exterminated.

In the other 561 futures, the Li Clan chose the Dragon-kin.

Though the Li family was trapped at Moongaze Lake, beset by difficulties, they appeared docile on the surface. They allowed themselves to be pawns in the games between north and south, offering no resistance. But secretly, they colluded with the Dragon-kin, building a great tomb in the Vermillion Sea as a contingency for reincarnation.

When Li Zhouwei, besieged in Weidu Prefecture, finally fell in battle, his True Spirit escaped. He attempted to flee to the Dragon-kin to reincarnate, but was struck by the 'Aethereal Thunder Drum'. His True Spirit was shattered. Moongaze Lake was turned into a sea of blood. A remnant branch of the family fled overseas to occupy the Qunyi Archipelago, surviving precariously under Dragon-kin rule. But within a mere ten years, the direct line withered, and the clan was extinguished, its assets carved up by the other families—just like the Jiang family's story.

In the final 523 futures, the Li Clan allied with the Great Song dynasty founded by Yang Zhuo. Li Zhouwei perishes at Gardenia Scenery Mountain during a breakthrough attempt. This buys Moongaze Lake twelve years of peace. Then, the Song and Zhao State fight for supremacy. Moongaze Lake is breached by the Zhao State's great general, Wang Quwan, and the entire clan is slaughtered. Li Jiangliang, who holds a position in the imperial court, commits suicide... they are likewise unable to escape. Seventy-six of these scenarios were slightly better, leaving only Li Ximing, who secures a decent position in the Underworld. But after secretly intervening in worldly affairs, he is executed within a few years for 'disturbing the mortal realm'.

Every single one of these outcomes, without exception, ended in blood and tears.

Of course, beyond those 1,884 futures, there were seven others.

Lu Jiangxian's expression was grim.

In these seven futures, Li Xizhi also joined Luoxia. But in these versions, he was careless, and his true body was discovered. A great war erupted in the Great Void and the realms beyond. The mainland was shattered into seven islands. The Li Clan, and everyone associated with them—their allies, their associates, their in-laws, the Sima Family, the Xiao family, the Chen Clan of Yuyang... all were annihilated. Not a single soul was spared.

'The futures calculated by the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book... whether good or bad, whether a moment of glory or a lifetime of suffering, not a single one offered a true path to survival!'

He stood silently in the Exiled Wind, his eyes reflecting the suppressed Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book in the sky, his expression unreadable.

The Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book was not like the minor divination power Liu Changdie possessed. Even bound by Dharma Treasures, it still possessed the noble status and profound mystery of a 'Rank Designation'. It might not be able to calculate the future actions of a True Monarch, but 80 to 90 percent of the past and present schemes of all the great powers were well within its calculations!

'This means that all 1,891 futures born from my hypotheses are terrifyingly close to the actual future. As long as the Dao Embryo does not intervene, and as long as I do nothing major to interfere, these outcomes are practically set in stone!'

He fell silent for a long time.

'The Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book can calculate almost anything... but there are two blind spots.'

'One is the decisions made by the Dao Embryo immortals of Luoxia and the Underworld. The second... is me!'

'In those seven futures where my true body was discovered, the world was shaken to its core. Immortals and True Monarchs emerged to join the fray, and the vision immediately dissolved into pure chaos. Nothing remained but the shattered mainland!'

'If I just let the situation unfold, I will have completely wasted the last hundred years. Wasting the time is one thing, but missing this critical, century-long phase of change is worse. After this, even if another opportunity arises, it will be impossible to reverse our fortunes!'

He once thought that, at worst, he could just lie low for five hundred years. But looking at it now, how could five hundred years possibly be enough? Besides... after more than a century together... he couldn't just sit back and watch the Li Clan be slaughtered.

'Bright Yang and Li Zhouwei... this great chaos, this world-spanning scramble for 'True Qi', is the Li family's only chance. And in truth, it's my only chance, too.'

'The Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book can calculate these 1,891 futures. But the Lord of the Immortal Mansion, the Lu Jiangxian of Green Pine Temple... did he only calculate this many? What is there that he could not foresee!'

'He made all those arrangements, even going so far as to erase his own memories to become the me I am today. There must have been a reason. If the Li family was doomed to perish while I remained safe, why would he have set up Liu Changdie? Why would he have arranged for me to see these 1,891 futures?'

Lu Jiangxian stood silently in the Exiled Wind. He slowly turned his head, all his complex thoughts gradually solidifying into a single resolve:

"Variables. I need variables. They don't want them, but I must have them. One Chi Buzi is far from enough. I need more! Even if I can't disrupt their grand scheme, I can at least fight for that one slim chance of survival!"

His eyes turned a silver-white. His divine sense continued to link and calculate, his expression serene. In his hand, out of thin air, a pale, greenish-white sword began to coalesce.

'Li Jiangchun...'

Li Jiangchun had been given the Talisman Seed precisely because his talent in the Way of the Sword was the greatest in a century, so great he might one day rival even Li Chejing.

Gifting him Li Chejing's lifetime of experience in the Way of the Sword was no waste. But this legacy... it was not something an ordinary person could receive, nor would it grant its recognition lightly. Unless Li Jiangchun's talent surpassed Li Chejing's, he would at least need to reach the realm of Sword Origin, just one step shy of Sword Intent, to even have a chance of being acknowledged by it!

Lu Jiangxian had originally planned to wait until Li Jiangchun's Way of the Sword reached a certain level before having him try to master this legacy. But now, he could wait no longer.

'It will acknowledge him, whether it wants to or not!'

Just as he had done when Li Xijun borrowed the sword, he forcibly suppressed this 'sword will'. With a flick of his finger, he sent it flying into Li Jiangchun's Talisman Seed. He, Lu Jiangxian, would dedicate a part of his mind to continuously suppressing this power, allowing Li Jiangchun to resonate with it and rapidly advance his Way of the Sword cultivation, forcing the issue until the legacy had no choice but to acknowledge him!

'The variables left behind by the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book aren't many, but they can be calculated cleanly...'

Endless silver-white vortexes swirled in his eyes as he raced against time, feeding countless new variables into his calculations at a terrifying speed.

In the endless illusions, he saw Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei, again and again. Or perhaps it was Li Jiangqian, or Li Que'wan, who would one day awaken to find 1,891 futures imprinted in their minds. Drenched in a cold sweat, they would try desperately to save themselves, only to meet a sudden, violent end...

"Using the variables themselves as a new variable..."

In that instant, the number of phantom futures exploded at a terrifying rate, repeating and replaying, over and over again.

The infinite Exiled Wind was now condensing toward a single point, plunging into the deep, bottomless Underworld. If Lu Jiangxian remained here, he could ride this gray-white 'Positional Exiled Wind' straight into the infinite Underworld.

'That place is the Underworld. The very source of the 'Exiled Qi'.'

He faced the roiling Exiled Wind as his faint connection to the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book finally severed. His figure vanished, and a shadow of gloom passed over his features.

'If all these schemes come to nothing, then I'll just have to play an open hand using the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book. I'll play the very hand they think they've seen, the one they believe is insignificant. From the very beginning, playing an open hand was the only qualification the Li family ever had.'

'I cannot personally intervene in every matter. But the Li Clan needs its own Liu Changdie. It needs a member of the Li family who believes they understand the future, someone at the very center of the storm who sees it all clearly... someone to place the pieces on the board for me, one by one...'

A massive trove of memories suddenly converged. A single point of golden light rose up, traveled down a hidden channel from the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, and vanished into an imperceptible corner of the Great Void.
