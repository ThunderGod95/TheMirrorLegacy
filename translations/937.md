# Chapter 937: Marvelous Wisdom Whisker

The noonday sunbeams spilled across the polished desk, illuminating a neat row of wooden slips. An old man sat in the courtyard, looking up with a smile.

"Daoist Master, what brings you to my humble place?"

Beside him, Li Zhouwei sipped his tea, his expression somewhat heavy. Only here in Li Xuanxuan's courtyard did he allow a trace of his anxiety to show.

"The new tune from the Dawn Guest Tower," Li Zhouwei began, "have you heard it, Venerable Sir?"

Li Xuanxuan was getting on in years. Whether facing Li Ximing or Li Zhouwei, he preferred to call them "Daoist Master." It wasn't a matter of closeness or distance; it was more for his own peace of mind. Hearing the question, he shook his head.

"Ever since Ming'er went into seclusion, I haven't gone to listen to *Lament for the Fleeting River*. I was afraid it would stir up my worries and make me overthink. However, I heard this new one is very different. The lyrics have been changed, and it has a fresh feel."

Although the old man's spirits were not high, his status ensured he knew a great deal. He sighed.

"I heard the Daoist Master went to the Dawn Guest Tower. You must have had guests..."

Li Zhouwei set down his cup, his gaze low.

"I met some people from the north. They didn't particularly care about me; they were just passing through to check my 'quality,' so to speak. They listened to one song and left."

'It's only natural,' Li Zhouwei thought. 'I am an unexpected variable, an accident. It's best if they just ignore me. If I can be of help, great. If not, no harm done. The only complication is that my name is registered with the Underworld, which makes it difficult to 'take me away,' so they'll just let events run their course.'

Li Xuanxuan picked up his cup, his expression dimming.

"On the contrary, it's the other side that becomes difficult to answer to."

Li Zhouwei understood the old man meant the Dragon-kin. Although the Qilin and the Dragons had an ancient relationship, and the Dragon-kin lived long lives, offering him some small favors, things would change. As his strength continued to grow, the day would come when he could truly challenge for Fruition Attainment. On that day, the schism and suspicion between him and the Dragon-kin would undoubtedly intensify...

'Qingyu Qian also said that the Dragon-kin have no real intention of supporting Li Qianyuan. For thousands of years, the Dragon-kin have been singularly focused on pursuing the Dao of True Dragons. They only hope to delay their own fall and, in the process, drain as much of Luoxia's energy as possible... If they truly wanted to help him escape, they would need to suppress me, prevent my cultivation from advancing too quickly, and find ways for Li Qianyuan to get to me. Whether the Dragon-kin don't dare or simply don't want to, their current actions of repeatedly helping me clearly signal a different agenda.'

'I myself am a consequence of the Fruition Attainment's instability, a clearly visible pawn that Luoxia has placed on the board. Luoxia holds the absolute advantage; they are far too cunning, and the Dragon-kin are caught awkwardly in the middle.'

'As for the four-eared man in white... he's almost certainly a fox.'

Possessing multiple ears was a distinct external trait of the Mount Dali Fox Clan's Daoist tradition. Considering the location and the other party's reaction, the answer wasn't difficult to deduce.

'First... the Dragon-kin... or rather, Dongfang Lieyun's statement, wasn't false, but it was heavily biased. The Fox Clan's words were more neutral... Luoxia's meaning—at least the one on the surface—is that *anyone* can take the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment, as long as it isn't Li Qianyuan...'

'Furthermore, by Luoxia's estimation, if they weren't actively suppressing him, Li Qianyuan's reincarnation might even try to kill me to achieve his own Dao. This not only aligns with the nature of the Bright Yang Dao, but it is also his most probable path to breaking this stalemate.'

His expression gradually turned contemplative.

'If that's the case... when I was forced to leave the lake and go into seclusion in the Eastern Sea, was that the work of a single faction? The timing of the True Monarch's reincarnation lines up perfectly with my time in the Eastern Sea... It was essential that the reincarnation was kept from ever seeing me... This was all arranged long ago.'

But the attitude of that Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia was truly fascinating, sparking Li Zhouwei's speculation:

'He didn't say a single word; he just let the opera play out... It felt like his own personal decision. He was passing through the south and felt that my interests and Luoxia's were, in fact, aligned. While he disdained the idea of ordering me around, he clearly has a bit of a temper. He couldn't stand hearing others spread idle gossip, so he used the 'actor's' mouth to make the stance clear.'

But no matter how much Luoxia disdained the situation, or how much they interfered based on their own path and principles, they had the standing to do so. Li Zhouwei, on the other hand, had no right to voice an opinion, or even the right to choose.

'On the surface, the Dragon-kin are opposed, even willing to provide me with Metallic Essence in the end. But the Underworld in the south has not yet stated its position. And what do all the other True Monarchs in the world think? According to Luoxia, the Underworld is merely interested in collecting Metallic Essence, but who can truly know if they aren't planting seeds everywhere, preparing to draw in their net!'

He watched the visitors depart, understanding his predicament. Mount Luoxia sat securely on its high perch, watching with detached interest. The Dragon-kin and the Underworld both had their own clandestine plans. Even the Buddhists in the north and the various powers on the seas had their own agendas. It wasn't just his personal fate that was adrift.

'I'm afraid it will only be at the very end, when an outcome is reached that satisfies the vast majority of these powers, that the Li family will have any future to speak of...'

He was lost in heavy thought, holding his cup in silence. Li Xuanxuan watched him, a look of understanding on his face. After a long while, he finally spoke.

"The Four Xis were the pillars of our Li family in their time, and Ximing was the most outstanding among them. He conceals his brilliance and blends with the world; he has his own measure of things. You are our family's Qilin of this century. He passed the authority of the family to you. Whatever you decide, that is the will of the entire clan."

Ever since Li Ximing had given him the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, Li Zhouwei had come to a new understanding. A light now shone in his eyes as he spoke softly.

"Minghuang has received the ancestors' trust. I only fear my considerations are not thorough enough. This conflict between north and south may still bring a calamity straight to our door. I must urge the younger generation to hone their divine abilities and advance their cultivation, until those divine abilities are perfected."

...

Kuidu Palace.

The True Fire blazed, its light shifting and changing. Golden flames illuminated the dark purple walls of the cauldron, intensifying the deep hues of its purple top and black base. On its surface, grotesque carvings of crows and owls lit up one by one, spitting black light as their profound mysteries emerged.

The five feet of the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron trembled, glowing in unison. The divine ability and dharma power within began to retract, coalescing into points of flowing light. The light was as warm and gentle as jade. The hand controlling the divine ability swiftly formed a seal, reining in the flames.

At once, the sound of a flowing stream echoed. Wisps of gray-black light shot from the cauldron's mouth, bound by the divine ability. They fell one by one into the waiting palm, forming round spirit pills, each inscribed with the winding, rugged patterns of mountains and rivers.

"The pills are complete!"

Li Ximing exhaled slowly, a look of profound satisfaction on his face.

The art of alchemy was a delicate balance. Pills that were too difficult were troublesome to refine, draining the mind and spirit. Pills that were too simple were just plain boring. The Serpent Water Dao-Hanging Powder was of medium difficulty, and the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron was exceptionally smooth to operate. How could it not be a satisfying refinement? He opened the jade box to find two full rows of pills lying within.

"A full seventeen pills!"

The Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron truly lived up to its name as a Purple Mansion Realm Spirit Cauldron. Furthermore, its Merging Owl Dao was compatible with Pit Water. This single batch had produced a full eight pills—undoubtedly the most Purple Mansion Realm pills he had ever refined at one time. If not for the mismatch with his own Daoist tradition, he might have achieved an unprecedented ten!

Of course, in alchemy, the pill count was also related to the formula. The Profound Adamant Heart-Sutra Pill, for instance, was classified as a 'medicine' meant for emergencies, so a normal batch yielded only three to five pills; the true skill lay in increasing their potency. The Serpent Water Dao-Hanging Powder also benefited from its formula:

'As the saying goes: a "Powder" is used to disperse and treat stubborn ailments; five or six pills are made for common use. A "Powder" formula inherently yields one or two more pills than average, but even accounting for that, eight is an extremely impressive result!'

The two batches combined totaled sixteen pills. Adding the one he had left over from before, he now had seventeen. This was more than enough to deliver the fifteen promised to Dingyang Zi. He glanced at the medicine box to the side. Inside, the dark, glittering Cangzhou Serpent Scale lay waiting.

'Cangzhou Serpent Scale, acquired!'

He gazed at the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron, feeling a momentary twinge of regret.

'It's a fantastic tool, it really is. Such a shame it's not mine.'

Li Ximing was not wealthy in spiritual materials. After using the Surging Li Treasure Leaf, he was left with only the Neck Feathers and Shangxiang Silver. Now, adding this new material, he carefully stored it away, thinking:

'I'll send fifteen over and keep one or two for myself. It's still a spirit pill, after all. It could be useful in a pinch.'

He then checked the jade pendant Liu Changdie had given him. It had activated three or five days ago and was still glowing faintly. Clearly, his contact had already been found. He couldn't delay any longer.

Li Ximing rose, his work complete, and walked out of the palace. The halls on either side were silent and empty, but Daoist Master Houfu, dressed in Daoist robes, approached with a smile.

"I saw the clouds of qi stirring and knew you had succeeded, Daoist Master. I never expected to catch the scent of Pit Water as well. Such fine alchemy skills!"

Li Ximing offered a few modest words in reply. "Senior, you praise me too much. I was just warming up the cauldron and testing the pill fire and the energies of this auspicious ground. It truly is a first-class location. I find myself quite envious."

Houfu replied with his own humble deflections, but Li Ximing continued,

"I need to refine a pill for that friend of mine, and I must first go and pick up an assistant. It's a good chance for you to meet him, Senior."

"Please, go ahead."

The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was weak at present, so Houfu was naturally happy to forge more connections. He stroked his beard and nodded. Li Ximing bid him farewell and took to the air, treading the Great Void as he flew toward Splitreed Island, following the connection from the jade talisman.

Soon, he passed over Splitreed Island and stopped above a patch of open sea nearby. He dove straight into the water. A silver pavilion stood upon a reef below. With flying eaves, carved beams, and painted pillars, it was a magnificent sight as fish and shrimp swam freely through its open halls.

A sweep of his divine ability told him this was merely a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, though it possessed a certain magic. It was a temporary traveling palace, built purely for enjoyment and lacking many other functions. He smiled to himself.

'He is a Formations Master, after all, and he spent so much time in the Southern Borderlands. He's certainly well-off.'

He descended into the pavilion. Liu Changdie was sitting cross-legged, his aura fluctuating unstably. It seemed he had just been in a fight or had recently used a powerful divine ability. Seeing Li Ximing arrive, he immediately opened his eyes and smiled.

"Ximing, you're here!"

Li Ximing's smile faded slightly as he raised an eyebrow. "This is..."

Liu Changdie waved his hand to show it was nothing. He stretched out his hand and pointed to the desk, where a dark metal box sat. He smiled.

"You used your Surging Li Treasure Leaf last time, and I said I would compensate you for it. I went and fetched this for you. Please, take a look. The value should be roughly equivalent!"

Li Ximing naturally remembered the conversation and knew Liu Changdie wasn't one for empty words, but he was surprised it had happened so quickly. He tried to refuse once or twice, but Liu Changdie brushed off his protests. Left with no choice, Li Ximing smiled, offered his thanks, and stepped forward to open the box.

The box was no larger than his palm. Inside, heavy, milky-white clouds swirled, looking like a bowl of goat's milk gently rippling. Li Ximing focused his divine ability at his brow and easily pierced through the mist. Floating in the very center was a yellowish-white wooden whisker. It was about an inch long, covered in minute, delicate branches, and no wider than a blade of grass.

There had to be another spiritual formation layered inside the box; even with the lid open, the spiritual mist did not disperse.

"This is a Marvelous Wisdom Whisker," Liu Changdie explained. "It's a resource for the Gathering Wood Dao. It grows on Little Mountain of Vast Jade in the Western Sea. The moment it senses the ground, it burrows and becomes impossible to find... It must be contained using the Foundation Establishment Realm spiritual object, Heart-Locking Cloud, and further secured with formations. Otherwise, it will escape at the slightest lapse in attention. A friend of mine found a few on the mountain long ago and gave me one as a resource. Now, I am passing it to you, Daoist Friend."

He smiled, though a bit awkwardly. "This item can treat the Qi Sea Juque ailment and can also dispel Profound Qi. If catalyzed with a divine ability and planted in the earth, it can sprout trees and attract birds. Its uses are... rather niche. The Gathering Wood Dao is not prominent these days, and what little we know of its uses comes from a line or two in old books. You might actually know more about it."

It was no wonder he felt awkward. The item was in a strange, borderline-useless category. What Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would ever need a spiritual object for their Qi Sea?

But Liu Changdie quickly changed the subject. "The Western Sea is, after all, extremely remote. It's the domain of the ancient master of the Water Mansion. It's impossible to cross without powerful divine abilities, and even if you reach the Abyss of the Water Mansion, it remains incredibly inconvenient. Very few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators bother to journey there. So, while this item may not be priceless, it is exceedingly rare."

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly, sighing. "Senior, your generosity is profound!"

In truth, a niche item like the Marvelous Wisdom Whisker couldn't possibly compare to a spiritual material from the ascendant Li Fire Dao. The Surging Li Treasure Leaf had countless uses for him. But sacrifices had to be made to obtain Li Fire, and a single leaf was nothing. It was only due to Liu Changdie's integrity that he even spoke of compensation. How could Li Ximing possibly object?

His own reserves were not plentiful. He sighed in appreciation, thanked him again, and accepted the box.

"Daoist Friend Qingyan has been searching for spiritual materials in this area for several days now," Liu Changdie said. "I'll go call him back..."

He looked quite emotional as he turned back to Li Ximing. "He, too, has a difficult lot in life. The True Monarch of the Azure Manifestation Dao fell in the north long ago, transforming into a mountain. I heard his state at the time of his death was... unusual... and the Dao has not prospered since. Nearly all spiritual materials and spiritual qi for that path can only be found on that mountain. They are rarely seen anywhere else..."

"To make matters worse, Azure Manifestation is peculiar. Many of its spell arts and divine abilities urgently require those specific Azure Manifestation resources. But how could they possibly dare to go to the north? He has been running all over the world for so many years. I heard he managed to find a few things in Jiangnan, but then even Jiangnan dried up, forcing him to wander even more."

'Jiangnan... The only famous Azure Manifestation practitioners in Jiangnan are the Yuan family...'

Li Ximing pondered this silently, and then his heart suddenly jolted.

'It seems that this Demon beast has been treating the treasury of the great Yuan family of the Mushroom Forest Plains as his own personal garden, visiting it good and well a few times!'

'If this Demon beast is operating like this, then the other Azure Manifestation cultivators in the world are probably in a similar, sorry state... Yuan Huyuan said the Yuan family used up all the spiritual materials left by their ancestors... Was it truly *used up*, or did it just *vanish*? We can't know for sure. And what about those ancestors who died in seclusion, or those talented geniuses who died 'prematurely'... how many of them actually ended up in its belly!'

'The Yuan family's decline was no accident... The fact that their line still thrives to this day is only because someone in Jiangnan is protecting the legacy of the Dams-Goat Temple Palace. As long as the Yuan family continues to cultivate the Azure Manifestation Dao, they will live in a state of perpetual despair...'
