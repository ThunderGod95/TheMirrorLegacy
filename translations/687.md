# Chapter 687: The Sky Brightens

The cool light flowed down, illuminating the dust-covered Shengyang Mansion once more. The primordial oblivion, like snow in the blazing sun, vanished completely. The sea began to ripple again, and the lotus flowers bloomed anew.

Li Ximing felt a crisp, refreshing sensation circulate through the Shengyang Mansion. It was like drinking melted snow, and the haze in his mind cleared completely.

'The Talisman Seed dispelled the oblivion!'

A surge of joy rose in his heart. His spiritual sense extended beyond the Shengyang Mansion, peering into an endless, empty darkness. Below, celestial light shone brilliantly. A cool energy settled under his tongue, and a sweet liquid trickled down his throat. The trial of oblivion was over.

By now, his spiritual sense had detached from his body along with the Shengyang Mansion. The "mouth" he perceived was, in fact, the mansion itself; his spiritual sense, lacking a familiar frame of reference, was simply interpreting it through his inherent senses.

The coolness in his "mouth" was his nascent divine power. Seeing that the Talisman Seed had carried him all the way to the final trial, Li Ximing's joy subsided. He dared not be careless and kept his "mouth" firmly shut.

'There are still the infinite illusions!'

Just then, something materialized from the void before him. Banners fluttered, and a golden host marched out of the darkness. The air filled with the clamor of whinnying horses and sharp commands as an army manifested.

The soldiers were all clad in golden armor, each with a distinct face, holding spears and halberds. They were shockingly lifelike. The man at their head wore a phoenix-wing helmet and a mask that concealed his features. He rode a tall steed, holding the reins as he trod upon the air. With a golden spear in hand, he advanced and pressed its tip to Li Ximing's throat.

"Halt!"

In an instant, he was surrounded by the golden-armored soldiers. They drew their swords and nocked their bows, their weapons all trained on him. Li Ximing glanced down at himself. He was dressed in simple robes, his hands empty, nothing more than a mortal man.

"Who are you!"

The scenery in the distance grew clearer, revealing that he was in a mountain valley. The general pressed the spear against his throat and barked, "Why are you here?"

Li Ximing knew his divine power was held within his mouth and refused to speak. The general's expression shifted from suspicion to anger, and the guards on either side began to press him, their thousand voices roaring like thunder.

Such a display was hardly enough to frighten Li Ximing. He remained silent. Enraged, the general wheeled his horse around and departed, his guards vanishing with him like the wind.

Li Ximing had just begun to relax when a black-striped tiger leaped from an unseen corner and sank its teeth into his calf. There was a sickening crunch as its fangs tore through flesh and muscle, exposing white bone and sinew. Blood sprayed everywhere.

The pain was excruciating. He raised a hand to drive it away, but a massive snake with a purple head shot out from behind him. Its pupils were pale yellow, its scales slick and smooth. It ripped open his chest with a single bite and made off with a piece of his flesh.

He reached to cover the wound, only to touch his own bare ribs. A viper with a triangular, flat head lunged, burrowing into his stomach and yanking out his intestines, spilling the warm, steaming coil all over the ground.

All manner of venomous creatures and wild beasts swarmed from the shadows, fighting over his body. Through a haze of agony, Li Ximing kept his mouth shut. He gradually lost track of where he was, knowing only that he could not open his mouth, for his divine power was held within.

Soon, the beasts scattered. A torrential rain began to fall, accompanied by lightning and thunder. The general returned with his men, this time dragging a great bronze cauldron, heated until it glowed red and filled with boiling oil.

"Who are you?" he demanded.

Li Ximing still refused to answer. Then, he saw a group of people being dragged forward from the distance. At their head was a white-haired, stooped figureâ€”his grandfather, Li Xuanxuan.

Two armored soldiers brought out a board, black and stained with blood. They struck the old man fifty times, then turned to ask Li Ximing again. When he didn't answer, they each took out a blood-flecked rasp and began to file down his grandfather's fingers.

The old man's shrieks shook the heavens, but Li Ximing remained silent. When all five fingers had been ground down, the general lifted his grandfather and held him over the cauldron of oil.

"Tell me your name, and he will be spared," the general said coldly.

The old man's blood dripped into the cauldron, and sizzling bubbles burst, scalding his skin. His grandfather pleaded in a hoarse voice, but Li Ximing did not respond. He closed his eyes, refusing to watch. The general finally let go and ordered his men, "This sorcerer's art is nearly complete. We cannot let him live."

Two soldiers stepped forward. One thrust a spear into his chest with a dull, wet thud. The other swung a saber. A cold sensation touched his neck, and his vision exploded into a shower of stars. Li Ximing nearly lost his resolve.

He drifted in a daze for a moment before his vision cleared to a gloomy scene. Heavy iron chains were wrapped around his arms and neck, shackling him at the waist. They were so heavy he couldn't lift his head. Two icy gazes fell upon his face.

Two figures stood beside him. One held a warrant covered in tiny, ant-like script. He could vaguely make out titles like "Ninth Netherworld Ghost Emissary" and "Tenth Generation Merciful King." Since Li Ximing wouldn't speak, the two soul-takers didn't question him, simply leading him on the path to the Netherworld.

Li Ximing saw a landscape of collapsed city walls and iron plaques scattered everywhere. Two small ghosts were using long ladles to pour molten bronze, glowing a fiery red. Without a word, they threw him into a pit and used their ladles to push him under the surface, expertly dousing him with the liquid metal.

The molten bronze seared through his chest and stomach, the pain so intense it almost wiped out his consciousness. A mortal would have screamed instinctively, a reaction beyond conscious control. But as a spiritual body, he was just barely able to maintain his silence.

After one round of pouring, the ghosts fished him out. One of them spoke. "It's rare to see a ghost so good for torturing. There probably aren't many ghosts left in the mortal realm."

"Isn't that the truth," the other replied. "The Lord Magistrate is in seclusion, and the posts of 'High Shaman' and 'Xiukui' have been vacant for ages. When people die, they just die. What ghosts are there to speak of?"

The two of them flipped him over and subjected him to a litany of tortures: being pounded with iron rods, boiled in pits, and forced through mountains of blades and forests of swords. Partway through, a soul-taker brought over a white-haired old man. One of the ghosts called out, "Sir, which fellow Daoist have you brought?"

The soul-taker stood beside the old man and answered, "This is fellow Daoist Chi Wei."

Li Ximing almost cried out. He looked up and saw the old man standing next to the soul-taker, dressed in the robes of the Azure Pond Sect, looking down on him with a superior air.

The little ghost glanced at him and sneered, "Do you have a grievance? The Great King is watching from above. He is the Tenth Generation Merciful King. If you just open your mouth, we'll cast this man down for you."

Li Ximing struggled but lowered his head in silence, not even letting out a groan. His mind was mired in a stupor. The little ghost gnashed its teeth and began to file at him with a blade, its actions growing ever more vicious. After he had endured it all, a voice from above declared, "This one is insidious and cunning. Send him to the Blue Sea to be reborn as a woman."

Li Ximing was led away, his mind numb, to be reincarnated. Finally, his vision brightened. By now, he had forgotten he was holding his divine power in his mouth; all that remained was the single, overriding thought that he must not speak.

He looked around. He had been born into a wealthy family, but was plagued by a hundred illnesses. He refused to eat or take medicine, yet somehow, his life was never in danger. But without medicine, the illnesses wracked him with constant, unbearable pain. He gritted his teeth and made no sound. His family simply treated him as a mute girl, one who was exceptionally beautiful.

They noticed she never ate. In the early days, they tried to force her mouth open, but her lips were sealed as if cast from iron, impossible to pry apart. Yet despite never eating, she grew day by day. Her parents began to fear her in secret.

Bedridden and unable to speak, her beauty was a curse. Visiting relatives, unaware of the truth, would often tease her with words and secretly take liberties. She grew to the age of sixteen in unspeakable misery.

Finally, a man from her village with the surname Lu came to ask for her hand. Her family hastily married her off. Fortunately, Mister Lu cherished her. They lived lovingly for several years, and her health gradually improved. They had a son and a daughter. But no matter how much her husband begged, she would never speak.

One day, while she was weaving at home, Mister Lu burst through the door, his face flushed and reeking of alcohol. He snatched their young son from his cradle and stared at her with cold eyes.

"You haven't eaten in three years! What kind of demon are you?" he roared. "This child may wear human skin, but who knows if he is human? An immortal master on the road told me that you sleep with me only to devour my official fortune!"

He was a large man, and in his rage, he grabbed the child by the feet and lifted him high above his head. Li Ximing was too slow to stop him.

"Speak!" Lu bellowed.

When she still didn't open her mouth, he threw the child with all his might. The boy's body hit a stone and shattered on impact, his brains splattering everywhere.

Li Ximing felt a rush of blood surge into his head. The coolness in his mouth churned, and a weak sound escaped his throat. As if struck by lightning, he managed a choked gasp. "Puh..."

His face went deathly pale. He finally spat out a mouthful of blood, along with half of his tongue. It mixed with the blood on the ground, everything blending into a deep, dark red that flickered before his eyes.

He looked up. Lu's enraged face, reflected in his eyes, began to grow more and more distant. He felt himself rising, floating away, swiftly leaving the infinite illusions behind.

The cool energy rushed straight to his mind. Everything before him faded rapidly, dissolving back into endless darkness. His memories returned, and he felt as light as air.

In his Juque Palace, the ice melted in an instant, and a powerful flame erupted, roaring through the acupoint. Li Ximing felt as if he were rising from boundless darkness toward infinite light. He saw visions of gardenias blooming and heard the ringing of camel bells. His world became brilliantly bright.

*BOOM!*

He felt himself fly up from where he stood, entering a place of infinite truth. The darkness was absolute, yet the stars in the sky seemed to shift, sometimes near, sometimes far. Countless figures seemed to be seated in meditation throughout the Great Void.

He flew to the very apex of the Great Void, where it seemed to be shrouded in mist and filled with countless remnants. The spiritual energy grew thinner, and the Great Void itself became narrow and fractured, turning a dull gray. The sight pained his eyes, and he plunged back down.

Below him was a boundless desert, and upon it stood a great pass. The celestial gate was majestic, the seventy-two ridges on its corner towers distinct, its white base covered in dazzling patterns of light.

His consciousness fell into it, plummeting with the celestial gate into the deepest depths. Finally, he fell from the vast Great Void and back into his physical body in the mortal world.

Li Ximing's eyes snapped open.

Before him was a dim, murky darkness. Sparse grasses and trees swayed in front of him. A drop of cold water from some melted snow trickled down and fell with a soft *plink*.

In front of him lay a golden table. The black jade box on top had been shattered by a surge of dharma power, its fragments scattered across the ground. As for the jade bottle that held the Radiant Violet Pill, it was nowhere to be seen.

The mountaintop was a complete wreck, as if it had been ravaged by demons a hundred times over. Jade pillars had collapsed. The tallest one lay right beside him, the words he had carved on it now faded and barely visible beneath a curtain of vines.

The formation lines on the ground that gathered spiritual qi were in disarray. The plants, nourished by the celestial light, had grown wild, nearly covering the entire summit. Small, golden specks of sand and a white-gold mist drifted through the air.

It was the darkest hour before the dawn. The stars were bright in the moonlit sky, and the pale moonlight flowed over the ground, making the white-gold mist glow faintly, creating a strange and beautiful scene.

*Rustle...*

Li Ximing stood up, and a shower of dead leaves fell from his clothes.

The celestial light was gone from the young man's pupils, and no bright aura surrounded him. Even his golden-white Daoist robes seemed ordinary. He looked younger, his skin fairer.

He seemed little changed from before, except for a new, tiny, white-gold dot at the center of his brow. It was neither painted nor tattooed, but shone with a brilliance like a point of celestial light, illuminating everything around it.

Li Ximing stood motionless for a long time. Behind his head, halos of rainbow light began to expand, one after another. The golden-white light of his Bright Yang divine power emerged from his sides, draping over him like a cloak and rising more than nine feet into the air.

He finally moved his lips and exhaled a breath of celestial light.

Before the breath could touch the ground, a purple flame ignited from thin air. It moved like a lithe flood dragon, soaring and weaving through the air. The flame was purple on the outside and gold on the inmost, its heat intense. Golden dust from the celestial light scattered around the dazzling flame, glittering as it was carried by the heat, spreading everywhere.

The purple flame spread across the ground, and in the space of a breath, it had set the whole of Mount Wu alight. As the fire spread, gardenia trees sprang from the earth, their canopies wide. In the midst of the roiling flames, pure white gardenia blossoms drifted down, blanketing the ground in snow.

The vast river of purple flames surged toward the heavens, its outer edges purple, its core gold, burning so brightly it seemed to bring the dawn ahead of time.

And then, the true, brilliant dawn began to rise swiftly in the east. Amidst the mountain of purple fire, Li Ximing stood beneath a gardenia tree, draped in the light of Bright Yang, as white petals swirled around his feet.

The first ray of morning sunlight passed through the formation and fell upon his pupils.

In the next instant, that ray of light was trapped within his eyes. They turned a pale gold, light flowing within them. His old ocular art, the Great Fissure Golden Pupils, had instantly reached its zenith.

His eyes, glowing in the firelight, slowly lifted. He looked toward the distant south. The clouds in the sky above him parted, scattering down a brilliant white radiance.

"The sky has brightened."

***

**Moongaze Lake.**

A light snow was falling. The moonlight was clear and bright, reflected in the cold surface of the lake. A late-night breeze sent ripples across the water. Streaks of light from flying cultivators crisscrossed the sky, giving the place an ethereal, immortal air.

It was the Zi hour, and most of the lamps around Moongaze Lake had been extinguished. But the many cultivators on patrol and guard duty were still awake, flying back and forth over the lake like colorful ribbons.

On the lush slopes of Mount Qingdu, in a talisman pavilion crafted from elegant, rustic redwood, an old man washed his inkstone. He carried the fresh ink inside, spread a sheet of talisman paper on his desk, and lifted his brush, pausing for a moment.

The old man was always busy. Though it was late, well into the Zi hour, he had not stopped working, painting one talisman after another. He watched as the cinnabar-red marks appeared on the yellow paper, then let out a breath, having finished another one.

Li Xuanxuan put it aside, then noticed that the room seemed unusually bright. He casually extinguished a few magical lamps, but then realized something was wrong.

"Where is that light coming from..."

He looked up and saw more than a dozen cultivators standing scattered across the lake, some near, some far, all staring eastward in a daze. They were bathed in a golden light, their shadows stretching long across the water.

The old man's gaze shifted, and he finally saw it: a brilliant, golden dawn rising in the east.

The golden radiance was reflected in his tired, clouded eyes. The talisman brush in his hand fell with a clatter onto the desk, rolling twice and smearing ink all over the paper, ruining it completely.

But Li Xuanxuan seemed not to hear. He braced a hand against the windowsill, his old face aglow with the light of the dawn. Tears welled in his eyes. He forced them shut, his breathing growing heavy.

On the twenty-second day of the winter month, at the Zi hour, the moonlight over Moongaze Lake retreated. The sky had brightened.
