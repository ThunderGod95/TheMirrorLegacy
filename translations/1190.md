# Chapter 1190: Greedy Snare

On Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

The evening sun was a deep, somber crimson, sinking low against the horizon and veiled by layers of purple-black clouds. It looked as if it might plummet below the earth at any moment. Yet atop the mountain, a blaze of firelight erupted, washing the peak in a stark white glow.

An unknown amount of time passed before a hand as fair as white jade tapped against the rim of a golden cauldron. The flames trembled and swiftly receded. The golden lid leaped into the air, revealing a vista of brilliant, jade-green light.

'It's done!'

The Daoist Master, clad in a white-gold robe, rose to his feet. He exhaled a long, turbid breath, and the exhaustion etched on his face softened considerably.

He opened his hand, and three jade-green objects hovered above his palm.

Each was no larger than a fingernail. It resembled a bird, yet it was not; it looked like a Flood Dragon, but it was not one. Great wings sprouted from its back, curling around to encase its body in a perfect sphere. It was exquisite and delicate, like a polished piece of jadeite.

'Pills formed from the Horn Wood!'

These three treasured pills had been refined using a vast quantity of healing resources, with a spiritual item of Horn Wood as their foundation. Their creation condensed the ultimate marvel of Horn Wood, and Li Ximing stroked his beard, a look of deep satisfaction on his face.

"With the help of the East Life-Mandate Water, this is a definite improvement!"

Among all the pills he had crafted in his long life of cultivation, this batch ranked in the top three. The only ones that clearly surpassed it were the Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill and a pill of Supreme Yin he had acquired through a fortunate encounter. Now, merely resting in his palm, these new pills caused the surrounding vegetation to flourish. Withered leaves regained their vigor, and white gardenia flowers took root and sprouted directly from the rocky summit.

'What a potent spiritual pill!'

Li Ximing's fervent gaze swept across the mountaintop in silent wonder. But his thoughts were on Li Zhouwei's injuries, so he did not linger. He summoned the wind and soared toward Pingya Island. After a brief moment to conceal his presence, he stepped into that land of pure radiance.

An ethereal air of perfect balance between sun and moon washed over him. Li Ximing moved swiftly through the ancient, elegant corridors and pushed open the gate to a small courtyard beneath a pavilion. He was met with a desolate scene. A sandstorm the color of blood billowed through the air, carrying with it a flurry of fine scales and delicate, shedding wings. The entire courtyard had become a killing field forged of Bright Yang.

A young man sat cross-legged in the heart of the storm, his hands pressed together in a devotional seal. His body was a lattice of cracks from which golden light seeped, rendering him as immobile as a broken statue. Only when he saw Li Ximing did he open his eyes. A hint of a smile touched his pale white pupils.

"Granduncle!"

Li Ximing pinched his fingers together, a quick divination that brought a shadow of concern to his face.

"I came to see you the moment I finished refining the pills, but it has been several days… Since this place lacks Wu Earth… why haven't your injuries improved in the slightest?"

There was no trace of weary suffering in Li Zhouwei's eyes; in fact, he seemed to be in good spirits. He managed a difficult nod.

"I knew you were refining a great pill, Granduncle. Why would I waste effort trying to heal myself? I thought it better to take advantage of this heavily damaged body, this state of being covered in fissures, to cultivate the 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead'!"

The Daoist Master stared, taken aback.

"You're this badly injured, and you can still cultivate a divine ability?"

Li Zhouwei shook his head.

"It certainly isn't easy. My physical body is damaged, but my divine ability remains stable. With my level of Dao-Profundity, working on it is not a problem."

He paused, a flicker of confusion in his eyes.

"'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' is an obscure and troublesome divine ability. The clan has never possessed anything that could aid in its mastery, and even the one pill I had for it was a poor substitute. For years, my progress has depended entirely on my own painstaking efforts… But now, with this Wu Light calamity afflicting my body, it seems I have inadvertently aligned with some higher principle. Cultivating 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' has become twice as effective…"

"Is that so…"

Li Ximing was impressed. He placed the three pills in the young man's hand while relaying Li Que'wan's recent discoveries. He then passed over a vial of Treasurefall Water he had left.

"The medicinal properties of this pill are incredibly potent," he advised. "The usual methods of consumption won't draw out its full effect. Taking it with Treasurefall Water is the ideal way."

Li Zhouwei nodded seriously.

"The clan now has a source for Supreme Yin spiritual essence, but it consumes far too much of Que'wan's energy. In my opinion, we shouldn't be frugal with that portion of Final-Tower Sinking Primal."

Li Ximing hesitated, but the young man spoke again with a grave tone.

"An item like Final-Tower Sinking Primal can't be used outside the clan anyway. We have five portions; sparing one is no great loss. Most of the spiritual essence our clan obtains is used for artifact refinement, and it remains to be seen if Supreme Yin essence can even be used in alchemy. But with the miraculous properties of Final-Tower Sinking Primal, it could very well transform into more than one top-tier Supreme Yin spiritual item…"

"Right now, our clan's great formation and our alchemical pursuits—especially the art of Great Void construction—are in desperate need of top-tier materials. To our family, time is more precious than spiritual resources. There's no need to take the long way around just to save one portion of Final-Tower Sinking Primal."

Li Ximing nodded in understanding. Only then did Li Zhouwei smile.

"Besides, the fact that I can cultivate is good news. There's no rush to resolve this Wu Light disaster. I'll focus on healing my body first, but I'll leave my eyes as they are. This will align with the principles of the Great Fissure Broken-Blade Marvelous Art. I'll be able to make good progress."

With a few words, he had turned a dire situation into an opportunity, scattering the last vestiges of gloom in Li Ximing's heart. The older Daoist Master smiled.

"We'll do as you say."

Li Zhouwei took out one of the Horn Wood pills and casually steeped it in the Treasurefall Water. Incredibly, the pill stretched as if it were a living creature, turning itself over to reveal a pattern on its belly that resembled a human face.

He swallowed it in one gulp, his expression turning serious again.

"Granduncle, you can't neglect your own injuries. I can see you've been putting it off for days. Delaying any longer could lead to trouble."

Li Ximing was indeed injured. In his haste to refine the pills, he had suppressed the damage within his lungs and tried not to think about it. Not wishing to disturb Li Zhouwei's recovery, he quietly closed the courtyard gate and returned to the pavilion. There, standing on the ethereal, mist-wreathed corridor, was another Daoist Master, this one robed in crimson.

He was remarkably handsome, with slightly narrow eyes that shone with a burning golden light. His bright, flamboyant crimson robe was embroidered with golden patterns, lending his entire bearing a sense of profound unity. One hand rested on the railing, while the other cradled a ball of fire as he seemed to be observing the progress of his own divine ability.

The apricot-colored flame spread outward, only to vanish into thin air as if it had struck an invisible barrier, unable to extend any further. His gaze was sharp and discerning. With a casual air, he withdrew his gaze and smiled.

"Greetings, Great-granduncle!"

It was Li Jiangqian, emerged from seclusion after consuming the Parting Si Apricot Fruit.

"You're out of seclusion… That was remarkably fast!"

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. He strode forward and asked, "How did it go?"

The Daoist Master Zhaojing was not, of course, asking about a mere increase in cultivation from consuming a fruit. He was asking about Li Jiangqian's Talisman Qi—the Greedy Snare of Profound Li.

Hearing the question, the golden light in Li Jiangqian's eyes wavered slightly. He smiled.

"This junior has consumed it. My cultivation has advanced tremendously, as if I had refined the fruit into a series of pills and absorbed them one by one. My divine ability is far more powerful than before!"

This benefit alone would have saved an immeasurable amount of time in cultivation, yet Li Jiangqian spoke of it as if it were a minor detail. He continued with a smile,

"As for the effect on my life-mandate…"

His divine ability flared, and the apricot-hued Southern Brightness Heart-Fire bloomed in his palm, its raging heat threatening to incinerate its surroundings.

"The Parting Si Apricot Fruit is no common treasure," Li Jiangqian explained. "It raised this junior's life-mandate by a full five percent. With the additional boost from the Greedy Snare of Profound Li itself, the power of my Li Fire has increased by ten percent."

The increase seemed small, but this was five percent of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's life-mandate—an across-the-board enhancement to everything from his divine ability to his every technique. Li Ximing sighed.

"That… that's already five percent… Though I don't fully understand the intricacies of life-mandate cultivation, it seems that with just five more of those fruits, the power of your Southern Brightness Heart-Fire could double…"

Even a minor increase in a divine ability's power represented a qualitative leap; to speak of doubling it was unheard of. A twofold increase would allow the Southern Brightness Heart-Fire to surpass Li Ximing's own Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire.

'And five apricot fruits… they're certainly expensive, but obtaining them isn't necessarily an impossible task!'

In the current age, spiritual items of Li Fire were abundant. If the Li clan was willing to invest heavily, they could surely acquire a sufficient number. And if Li Jiangqian had some fortuitous encounter and obtained a few more, his Southern Brightness Heart-Fire could very well rank among the top three in the world.

This didn't even account for the comprehensive growth the life-mandate enhancement would bring him. When Li Zhouwei had perfected his connection to his White Qilin life-mandate, its power had merely doubled!

'Doesn't this mean… if he were born into a Golden Core Immortal Clan and consumed a dozen of these fruits in succession, he'd instantly possess a life-mandate flame comparable to the Heavenly Apricot Rain? He would be a genius akin to a reincarnation of Metallic Essence!'

"This is… this is simply beyond reason!"

A few simple calculations were enough for Li Ximing to grasp the immense potential for growth, and he found it difficult to believe. Li Jiangqian, however, just smiled.

"I understand what you mean, Great-granduncle. If the Greedy Snare of Profound Li could truly do that, what would be the point of cultivation for anyone else? Having experienced it, I have a rough understanding of its mechanism. In essence, it works by supplementing my own life-mandate with the various profound aspects of Li Fire contained within these spiritual fruits."

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing.

"In other words, the more varied the spiritual items you consume, the greater the effect!"

Li Jiangqian nodded with a sigh.

"If I consume the same type of fruit again, it might not increase my life-mandate at all. But if I find one completely different from all the others I've consumed, the increase could be even greater than five percent."

Even with this caveat, Li Ximing shook his head in disbelief.

"Astounding."

Before Li Jiangqian could respond, a clear, melodious laugh sounded from behind him.

"Elder Brother!"

Li Jiangqian spun around. Standing there was a charming young woman in a simple dress. A deep, joyous surprise finally filled his bright golden eyes. He took a step forward, a radiant smile on his face.

"I knew you wouldn't be held back by your divine ability!"

With Li Jiangqian, who she had grown up with, Li Que'wan was far less reserved. She blinked, turning slightly to the side.

"Still a step behind you, Elder Brother."

A complex emotion flickered in Li Jiangqian's eyes. He recalled their school days, when he would often skip his lessons. Peeking through the window, he would always see her, hunched over her desk, studying diligently. Decades had passed in the blink of an eye. The little girl who had once discussed the craft of lacquerwork with him was now a formidable cultivator in her own right.

"I actually possess some minor divination skills," he admitted. "I considered trying to see if you had achieved your divine ability, but you carry a Talisman Seed, so I knew I wouldn't get a clear reading."

He shook his head and smiled.

"I was busy with clan affairs, and you were focused on your arts. Let's not flatter each other. Both our breakthroughs were the natural result of our efforts."

"Elder Brother knows the art of numerology?" Li Que'wan asked, intrigued.

Li Jiangqian shook his head.

"It's just a small marvel that comes with my Talisman Qi's sensitivity to life-mandates. It's nothing compared to your talent! The only part worth mentioning is a minor ability to sense danger."

Watching the easy affection between the two siblings, Li Ximing was deeply pleased. He clasped his hands behind his back and took a few steps forward, a thoughtful look in his eyes.

'The younger generation is certainly closer to one another.'

After their pleasantries, Li Que'wan turned to business. She faced Li Ximing and bowed respectfully.

"Elder, you have been in seclusion for over a year. I saw the flames burning ceaselessly on Gardenia Scenery Mountain and didn't dare disturb you. But now, I have good news to report!"

With a flick of her sleeve, a heavy, lead box inlaid with white jade appeared in her slender hand. It was exquisitely crafted and covered in profound runes. She opened it, revealing a bright, silvery liquid inside, as cold as ice and snow.

Profound Minister Moon Essence!

"This junior spent the last year using my divine ability to brew six cauldrons' worth. I was quite fortunate; five of the attempts were successful. Including the portion I made previously, there are a total of six portions here in this box."

She had once estimated her chances of success at seventy percent, so producing five successful batches was indeed a stroke of great luck. She presented the box to Li Ximing and said solemnly,

"However… by my calculations, these six portions are still not enough for the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron to condense the spiritual essence. It would take at least another round to even make an attempt. Including the time for condensation, the entire process could take another two or three years. I was afraid of delaying important matters, so I came to ask for your guidance."

"This has delayed your cultivation!"

The young woman was incredibly considerate. For the past year, she hadn't even taken the time to stabilize her own cultivation, focusing all her energy on preparing the Profound Minister Moon Essence. Li Ximing nodded repeatedly, his mind racing.

'Since Minghuang can already cultivate, there's no rush on this front…'

He accepted the box and solemnly led the two into a private room in the pavilion. Taking out another box, he cautiously picked up a bottle of Final-Tower Sinking Primal and held it out to Li Que'wan.

She took it immediately and studied it, but she couldn't detect the faintest spiritual trace. The blue-white substance within was a uniform mass, like a swirl of cloud. Unconvinced, she pinched her fingers and performed a divination for some time before murmuring in doubt,

"I… I can't even see through it…"

Even when she pushed her divine ability to its absolute limit, she could only sense that the object's fundamental rank was incredibly high, yet its spiritual signature was obscure and unsteady—utterly bizarre.

'Just as I thought…'

When Li Ximing had first examined it, he had seen nothing special about it at all. The fact that it remained inscrutable even to Li Que'wan gave him a newfound reverence for the item.

"Can you calculate… what kind of spiritual item this can transform into?" he asked.

Hearing his question, Li Que'wan understood that this was a treasure of the highest order of Supreme Yin. But her arts were unable to penetrate its secrets, and she hesitated before answering.

"How many spiritual items it can produce… I'm afraid one would have to test it to know. The Art of Demoting Yin is highly variable when applied to spiritual materials. This item… perhaps it contains more than just Supreme Yin… perhaps even something akin to Pure Qi…"
