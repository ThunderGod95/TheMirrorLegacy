# Chapter 880: Annihilation

The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl in the sky faded, and the eye-like colors at the horizon disappeared with it. The radiant lights across the heavens dimmed, gradually returning to the normal sky.

All the cultivators simultaneously looked up, pupils dilating as they collectively froze. The purple-black hue and colored lights brought by the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl had yet to completely fade. The entire sky bore a light violet tint, with flowing lights that exuded an entrancing, soul-stirring aura.

But glass-like fragments of bodies, both big and small, were scattered across this violet sky. These Master Monks' dharma bodies were immense to begin with, and now they littered the air like countless fallen statues.

All eyes traced the trail of broken corpses upward until they landed on a mountain of golden remains formed from dharma bodies. A white-armored man sat quietly cross-legged at the peak, with a white bow planted beside him.

He slew the entire assembly of monks...

The scene lasted only a moment. Now that the suppression of the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl had vanished, the fragments of dharma bodies instantly vaporized into dazzling lights, and the floral rain in the sky intensified, accompanied by cascading shards of colored glass crashing down with clinks and chimes.

The crowd still craned their necks, stunned. Though it was but a fleeting moment, the sight was so terrifying it branded itself into the pupils of every cultivator present. Most hadn’t even moved to collect the falling glass, frozen in place.

Boom!

A muffled thunder rumbled. Li Qinghong rose first, transforming into a bolt of violet lightning. She pierced through the falling dewdrops and petal rain, searching for the white-armored Li Xuanfeng.

He had already descended on the wind. The gaping wounds across his body and the hollow insides beneath them had been concealed, and he was suited in his domineering white-gold armor once again. His white bow was held with casual ease in his hand.

Li Xuanfeng’s eyes, flickering with golden energy, now appeared faintly gray. He raised a hand to silence Li Qinghong’s words. She immediately swallowed her anxiousness, stood firm with her silver spear behind him, and the uncle and niece descended toward the southern bank amid the celestial phenomena.

Below, everyone stared blankly at the wonders overhead, allowing the pink petals to reach their knees. When Li Xuanfeng stepped onto the radiant pass summoned by the Huai River Map, even the noble Si Yuanli trembled, unable to meet his gaze.

Everyone knelt in reverence from west to east. The fierce and majestic man radiated brilliance in his white armor. Families on either side bowed their heads, immortal descendants lowered their gazes, and rogue cultivators and kin alike prostrated like blades of grass.

Dew and petals rained down as a thunderous chorus erupted from the southern bank, "Greetings, my lord!"

Li Xuanfeng gave a slight nod and gently raised his left hand. A scroll slowly materialized, floating long and horizontal in midair. The white-armored man unfurled it with a soft flick of his wrist.

Splash!

The long radiant pass beneath his feet instantly vanished, turning into streams of golden light that flowed back into the scroll. Li Xuanfeng said nothing more. The scroll spun once in the air and landed in front of Si Yuanli.

Swish...

Si Yuanli stared blankly at the sky as pink blossoms spiraled down onto his face, only to be brushed aside by the dharma light shielding him.

His perception technique was among the finest. He had clearly seen the glasslike dharma bodies scattered across the heavens the moment the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl vanished from the sky. Coupled with the terrifying, hair-raising phenomena, only one thought remained in Si Yuanli's heart, All eighteen Master Monks had been executed.

Soft petals had risen past his knees. Si Yuanli cast his gaze northward, where endless pink and gold stretched before his eyes. Dew, petals, and glass covered the land like an ocean, dazzling him so much he could hardly keep his eyes open.

Who could compare to such divine might in the last five hundred years?

The names of figures like Duanmu Kui and Shangyuan surfaced in Si Yuanli’s mind. Perhaps only that incident seventy years ago, the pacification of Xu State, when Shangyuan entered alone into a gathering of monks, slain two monks and three devils, and walked away unopposed, could be considered comparable.

His gaze slowly traveled from the sky full of wonders to the cultivators along the riverbank. Some eyes held fear, some relief, and others joy. But one emotion prevailed among the family cultivators and rogue cultivators.

Reverence.

Si Yuanli looked away, dazed and confused. Li Xuanfeng slightly tilted his head and looked toward him, causing Si Yuanli to jolt upright and listen intently.

Li Xuanfeng’s slightly hoarse voice echoed through the air. It wasn’t loud, but it made all the cultivators bow and listen solemnly, "The northern monks have been slain. My duty as guardian is fulfilled. My lifespan and Immortal Foundation are all but spent. I only hope to be permitted to return to the lake and enter death."

His words made all cultivators raise their heads, stirred. Even those from the Yuan Family, who had clashed with him before, now looked at Li Xuanfeng with reverence. The entire assembly fell silent.

Though most cultivators had come to defend the river out of necessity rather than devotion, they had also fought with all their strength. After all, their families and cave dwellings lay behind the riverbanks, and who hadn’t brought their entire family?

Now, nearly all could see that it was Li Xuanfeng alone who had defended the riverbank. This fearsome man was about to enter death, and the families’ dread and fear gradually turned into relief. Along with reverence, came gratitude.

Thank goodness... truly, thank goodness...

Instead, it was the rogue cultivators and family members who exchanged glances filled with regret and gratitude, lifting their heads to look at him, at a loss for words.

But in Si Yuanli’s mind, a shudder ran through him. The ominous premonition he had been dreading was now reality. He thought in fear, He... he is going to enter death!

Li Xuanfeng dying in battle versus surviving with heavy injuries, these were two entirely different outcomes for Si Yuanli! Just moments ago, he had admired Li Xuanfeng’s imposing might and felt a touch of relief.

But now, his heart was left only with cold dread, This changes everything! This changes everything! Li Yuanqin is a close aide to the Chi Family. If he perishes in the line of duty, the Chi Family will seize the chance to exploit the situation!

At that point, it won’t even matter whether the Li Family can support us... the entire war might shift in a dangerous direction!

No matter how cold his heart felt, when the words reached his lips, all he could do was respond bitterly, "How could this be... Very well... Xuanfeng..."

Li Xuanfeng gave him a slow nod, his voice slightly lowered, "The Monarch Calling Command Golden Talisman cannot be retrieved now. Once I enter death, my family will surely deliver it."

His gaze had softened slightly. Though the man hailed from Azure Pond Sect and had committed acts better left unspoken, the survival of millions behind the river was in no small part thanks to him. As a swordsman, at least he still held to some lines he would not cross.

Meeting his gaze, Si Yuanli felt a flicker of guilt. Li Xuanfeng was about to die, ultimately due to obeying his orders. The man had not yet realized how much Si Yuanli had come to admire him in secret. He only felt pain, What a pity...

Li Xuanfeng gave a soft laugh and transformed into a gust of bone-white wind, departing. The Li Family members had no reason to remain, and all rose into the air. Everyone stood to the side and spoke in respectful unison, "Respectfully seeing the lord off!"

The voices spread from east to west, gradually merging into one. Even Lingu Lanying’s eyes revealed a trace of reverence. She turned slightly and offered a salute in the direction of his departure.

"Respectfully seeing the elder off..."

Si Yuanli felt his chest fill with icy snow, but soon realized more and more eyes were turning toward him. A woman in green robes stepped forward, her attire elegant and striking, a sword at her waist. She first offered him a bow.

"This is bad!"

Si Yuanli’s scalp tingled. Lingu Lanying’s voice rang through his mind like a great bell, sending a jolt through his whole body, "Senior Yuanli! The northern cultivators have retreated. Should we proceed to aid Bianyan?"

Si Yuanli turned his head and realized the entire southern bank was watching him with cold stares. The silence was so complete one could hear a pin drop. Every gaze stabbed at him like blades, like a rain of arrows piercing him through. Those eyes held curiosity mixed with pressure, pressing against his chest little by little.
