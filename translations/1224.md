# Chapter 1224: The Supreme Divine's Methods

The thought flashed through Qing Jifang's mind for but an instant before he raised his hand as expected. Colors coalesced at his sleeve, finally illuminating a golden alms bowl.

The bowl was a rich, mellow gold all over, its exterior unadorned with any patterns, but a purple flower was carved into its inner base. The moment it appeared, it began to spin rapidly, drawing in all the Merging Fire from his sleeve and holding the flames suspended in mid-air.

'The Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire is ultimately a flame tinged with the Supreme Yang. Even a treasure like the Golden Kite Purple-Gold Alms Bowl can't contain it for long. Too much time, and the treasure itself will surely be damaged!'

Qing Jifang's knowledge was not shallow, and without any delay, he strode forward, immediately raising his sleeve and extending his hand; his brow sank, a divine ability bloomed in his palm, endless white qi manifested, and he abruptly clenched his fist:

'Luminous Dredging.'

This man was arrogant and his talents were sparse, so he rarely used his divine abilities, preferring to suppress others with Spiritual Treasures and Spiritual Artifacts. Yet he could read the situation clearly, and after only a few exchanges, he had immediately used a divine ability!

"BOOM!"

A violent roar arose from within the clouds. Li Ximing had just wiped the grey haze from his face when an endless white qi had already gathered around him. A sheet of golden light appeared from the zenith, having already latched onto his Baihui acupoint at some unknown moment!

It was a fine, golden-brown thread.

The thread was as fine as a hair, barely visible, yet it extended from his Baihui acupoint up toward the infinite heavens. What was more bizarre was that the thread caused him no strange sensation at all, as if it did not exist!

'The aura of Manifestations Earth...'

The Changhuai Dao Lineage had always been difficult to discern, and Li Ximing's eyes were not so powerful as to see through it. However, he had once seen the Manifestations Earth Metallic Essence in the Eastern Sea, so he possessed some ability to recognize it. Though he could now see the foundation of the divine ability, he could not perceive its depth, which only gave him an even greater sense of crisis, and he immediately took a step back.

"Thud!"

As he took that step, a brilliant, towering Celestial Gate spread out from his footfall, enveloping him in its protection. Just as he completed this act, a great laugh echoed from the sky:

"Li Ximing!"

The voice was like a thunderclap, causing Li Ximing's body to inexplicably sink. In that single moment of sluggishness, a grey light was already reflected in his pupils.

"Take this!"

The two words overlapped, exploding by his ear with excruciating pain. Li Ximing finally felt a powerful, strange sensation as his divine abilities, dharma power, and even his very qi and blood surged toward the crown of his head. The heavenly light between his brows immediately shone, responding of its own accord:

'World's Radiance!'

The activation of this Life Divine Ability almost instantly reduced the strange sensation throughout his body by seventy percent. Only then did Li Ximing have time to summon the Heavenly Nurture Urn, hastily placing it before him as shock and terror filled his heart.

'What kind of damn divine ability is this!'

Before him surged a dense grey qi, like collapsing earth and stone, suffused with an endless killing intent. The Heavenly Nurture Urn instantly flared with brilliant light, its mouth turning to face the assault, indiscriminately swallowing all the grey qi that crashed into it!

It had to be said that although his opponent's divine ability was exceedingly bizarre, it was ultimately based on this thick, grey qi—precisely the type the Heavenly Nurture Urn was most adept at defending against. As soon as the Spiritual Treasure's own ability was triggered, any Dharma Art, no matter how strong, would be drawn inside. Even if the grey qi was endless, it could only be worn down bit by bit before this Spiritual Treasure.

Even so, Li Ximing was drenched in a cold sweat.

'If 'World's Radiance' wasn't already mastered, and if the Heavenly Nurture Urn didn't happen to counter my opponent's Dao Lineage, I would have been injured by that single blow!'

Qing Jifang saw this clearly as well. Within the white qi surrounding him, rope-like shapes writhed like venomous snakes, making his expression even colder.

'Protecting Wood... The Yang family really knows how to be disgusting!'

But he was not worried. As long as he could keep this Spiritual Treasure occupied, it was enough!

He immediately brought his palms together, forming hand seals to cast a spell. Li Ximing, however, raised his long ruler and tapped lightly in the air, knocking aside the white jade fan that had attacked once more, and the sense of crisis in his heart immediately skyrocketed!

In just a single breath, Qing Jifang's face began to twist, as if another face upon his own was forcefully turning to one side. An illusory head tore free, identical to his own, but its pupils were a sheet of pale white. It stared straight at him, its mouth wide open:

'Li Ximing!'

The heavy sense of stagnation struck again, several times stronger than before. With it rose the intense pain of all his divine abilities and dharma power surging toward the heavens. 'World's Radiance' responded again as dense white qi congealed at his side, sealing him in mid-air. From the Great Void, a venomous, snake-like rope finally shot out and wrapped tightly around him!

The lips of Qing Jifang's original head moved faster and faster. A golden light seemed to surge between his lips and teeth, already locked onto Li Ximing's glabella!

But a slight curve appeared at the corners of the Daoist Master's mouth, clad in his white and gold Daoist robes.

'Finally!'

In that instant, the lips of this scion of the Qing clan suddenly froze. The powerful Dharma Art he was about to unleash congealed in the air as his eyes were forced open, reflecting a beautiful face.

A woman had appeared before him at some unknown time.

The woman wore a Daoist robe that billowed in the wind, and an agile, profound tiger circled around her. The tiger's fur was gold and white, and it radiated the faint light of Bound Earth, allowing her to close the distance with the speed of lightning!

In a flash, all the spiritual senses on the battlefield focused on her face, and the minds of the various cultivators filled with confusion and astonishment.

'A Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure!'

'Who is this person?!'

'A newly ascended Daoist Master of the Li clan... a 'Whole Pill' Daoist Master!'

But Qing Jifang had no time for such thoughts.

The newcomer was now less than an inch from him, her eyes ice-cold. More fatally, her slender hand was raised high, gripping a purple-gold mace carved with the profound patterns of all manner of demons and monsters, and it was already smashing toward his face!

It was Li Que'wan, protected by the Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure!

With his ability of Spirit Probe, how could Li Ximing not have seen the snake-like rope slithering through the Great Void? His goal was to lure away the Spiritual Treasure that had been constantly protecting Qing Jifang!

The concealing power of a 'Supreme Yin' Spiritual Treasure was beyond the ken of ordinary people. Even Qing Zhuo, who had been observing the situation from the side the entire time, had not noticed a thing. At this moment, his pupils also constricted as he cried out inwardly in alarm.

But the instant he took a step, he saw the woman's cultivation level clearly. The step he had been about to take was ultimately retracted, and he relaxed slightly.

'Just a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who has just broken through, and a 'Whole Pill' one at that. Even if she stood there and let him hit her, she couldn't inflict much damage... I shouldn't personally intervene... lest I provoke the Underworld...'

Qing Jifang had no time for such considerations. He was utterly horrified!

But just as Qing Zhuo had thought, he was, after all, a direct descendant of the Qing clan, the sole heir of a Great Daoist Master who had been showered with countless treasures. Even with danger so close, he still had ways to react. A point of light appeared from nothing between his brows, thick and solid, ready to erupt at any moment.

That moment, however, seemed to last an eternity. A cold smile appeared on the gentle, beautiful face before Qing Jifang. The Daoist Master suddenly felt a faint, overlapping shadow of cyan and purple appear around that fair face, like the moon in water, constantly shifting, faintly revealing another visage.

This face seemed to be made of liquid mercury, white as snow with crimson pupils, utterly immaculate. Patches of cyan and purple patterns adorned the corners of its eyes and cheeks, while the body below the head was a churning mass of boiling lead and mercury.

Li Que'wan had been prepared!

'Awaiting the Supreme Divine.'

The Divine Corpse manifested, shaking both inside and out.

The point of white light between Qing Jifang's brows was instantly submerged, vanishing as if swept away by the wind. Even the look in his eyes became lost for a moment. This momentary lapse cost him his last chance to dodge, and the Demonbane Cleaver Mace fell.

The Demonbane Cleaver Mace was of noble origin and excellent quality, but it was made for the exclusive use of the Thunder Palace. In the hands of the Li clan disciples, it had always felt somewhat useless. Now, in the hands of Li Que'wan, it finally bloomed with radiance.

'Whole Pill' cultivators disliked thunder, with a particular aversion to 'Primordial Lightning'. The two Empyrean Thunders were more tolerable, but they could hardly be called favorites and were generally avoided, allowing only seventy percent of their power to be used, and making improvement extremely difficult...

But seventy percent was more than enough!

The Demonbane Cleaver Mace, which in the hands of Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei could only be suspended in the air to release some lightning, was now submerged in an endless purple-gold light. The fourth of its divine abilities, never before seen, abruptly manifested:

'Demonbane!'

"BOOM!"

A dense divine thunder exploded on the spot, and the world was abruptly dyed purple. A long howl shook the heavens and the earth. Under the watchful eyes of all, the mass of white qi suddenly shifted, and a figure appeared within the dissipating lightning!

This scion of the Qing clan, a Grand General of the Shu Kingdom, was covered in grey blood, yet his face appeared completely unharmed. His two eyes were tightly shut in disbelief, streaming grey, bloody tears, and the sound of gritted teeth could be heard from between his lips.

'He dodged it?'

As everyone's gaze shifted, they saw that the head that had separated from him earlier was shattered to pieces, leaving only a faint, illusory neck connected to his shoulders—it was clearly some kind of damage-substitution art!

Far away, Li Ximing was still bound tightly by the Spiritual Treasure, but a faint sound reached his ears:

"Snap!"

The golden thread connected to his Baihui acupoint, the one he could not dispel no matter how he tried to interfere, had abruptly broken!

'He wounded the divine ability!'

Indeed, the shock and rage in Qing Jifang's heart were like a tidal wave. Even though his head had not been truly shattered, even though the powerful Dharma Art was still held between his lips and teeth—his 'Luminous Dredging' had been broken, shaking his divine ability and injuring his very foundation!

But what shocked and enraged him even more was that the woman before him had not retreated at all. Shrouded in the radiance of the Supreme Yin, she appeared at his side like a shadow:

'Foolish wench!'

He laughed in his fury.

'To think my substitution art is some low-level technique that would leave me momentarily breathless! You fail to realize that the arts of my Changhuai are something a lowly cultivator like you could never fathom!'

Without the slightest hesitation, the white jade fan materialized like a phantom in the Great Void, falling from thin air to shatter the screen of Bound Earth light. Its momentum unspent, it lightly struck the woman's back.

"Cough!"

Li Que'wan forcibly endured the blow and continued forward, her face paling slightly from the impact. But unexpectedly, during this precious time, she made no move to cast a spell. Instead, she discreetly pinched a grey speck of light that was trying to flee back through the air.

'Still not leaving!'

Qing Jifang's gaze was grim.

'Then don't leave at all!'

An infinite grey-white qi emerged from his palm and suppressed downward with decisive speed. Behind him, a scene of collapsing mountain ranges appeared as his divine ability coalesced into a vast, profound mountain:

'Quaking Profundity Vista Mountain!'

A divine ability also manifested on Li Que'wan's body. Colors overlapped, and a treasured vase at her sleeve spun, unleashing a tide of cyan and white light that surged forward to block the profound mountain.

It was the Night Supplanting Bottle!

This object was a supreme treasure of the Gongsun family. Though it did not belong to any great Dao Lineage, it was far superior to the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger that Changxi had refined from a motley collection of materials and blood essence. Among rogue cultivators, it was definitely considered a fine treasure. Empowered by 'Awaiting the Supreme Divine', the brilliance it unleashed was not to be underestimated.

The profound mountain suddenly sank, its power greatly diminished, but the opponent's spell art also had its own mysteries. Riding the momentum of its unfolding transformation, its speed did not decrease in the slightest, turning into a speck of brilliant light. The instant she pinched it, the enemy's furious spell had already struck her wrist, emitting a crisp cracking sound. The fair, tender skin was immediately covered in glazed, shard-like fragments.

Yet the woman's expression did not change at all. She retreated calmly, forming a hand seal with both hands to reveal a small, crystal-clear lotus:

The Subduing Creek Splitting Light Lotus!

How could Qing Jifang remain idle? As he freed himself, he had already caught the white jade fan descending from the sky and, repeating his old trick, gave it a gentle flick.

A terrifying grey wind erupted, but Li Que'wan was unmoved. Just as the grey wind was about to fall upon her, a heavy silver light shot past from behind.

The silver light was soft, and the faint sound of a door opening could be heard. To Qing Jifang's incredulous gaze, the white jade fan, along with the vast grey wind, turned into a speck of silver light and vanished on the spot. He could only watch helplessly as the woman escaped in a flash of yin light.

This was no mere entry into the Great Void, not a divine ability teleportation, and certainly not any kind of escape art—it was simply gone. With Qing Jifang's experience, his mind went blank for a moment, anger and shock congealing into a heavy mass of confusion.

'Huh?'

'It's 'Vault Metal'!'

Qing Zhuo's faint voice sounded out. Qing Jifang's brow shot up. Sure enough, on the other side, a man in silver furs had appeared out of thin air, a radiance flickering in his hand.

The Profound Vault Invitation Letter!

This 'Vault Metal' Spiritual Treasure possessed great powers, and on its first appearance, it displayed an unexpectedly potent effect. The Profound Vault opened first, assisting Li Que'wan's retreat. Now, with a slight tremor, the white jade fan and the grey wind crashed into another part of the Great Void, creating a world-shaking boom.

Li Que'wan steadied herself, a network of cracks covering her arm, and a trace of blood at the corner of her lips.

'Good... another 'Vault Metal'!'

Qing Jifang laughed in extreme anger. He did not give chase, but instead went straight for the root of the problem. The divine ability gathering in his mouth suddenly turned toward Li Ximing, who was still suppressed by the Spiritual Treasure. The great Dharma Art, already ninety percent complete, continued to operate, his killing intent laid bare:

'Absorbing Gold's Heavenly Profound Light!'

This was the moment Li Que'wan had been waiting for. She raised her head without the slightest pause, her face pale but bearing a calm, appraising look. Her slender hand immediately opened, revealing a small, grey droplet—the very thing she had just risked her life to seize.

It was blood.

Qing Jifang's blood.

She raised her other hand and made a single gesture.

She brought two fingers together and placed them before her lips.

Immediately following, Li Que'wan's eyes lit up, staring intently into the distance. A detailed incantation in a soft voice drifted out, landing in the Great Void, composed of only a few syllables.

At the same time, the distant Qing Zhuo's expression finally changed drastically. He strode forward, his body moving, crossing the distance at a terrifying speed, his heart filled with horror:

'This is bad!'

His gaze was not on Li Ximing, nor on Li Que'wan, but fixed anxiously on Qing Jifang—the great general of the Qing clan, who was now frozen in place while unleashing his full power.

His lips and teeth were gone.

The pair of lips beneath his nose, which had been brewing a terrifying Dharma Art, vanished without a trace, replaced by a patch of smooth flesh, as if they had never been there at all. The Daoist Master's eyes were filled with horror as he stood frozen, yet the brilliant golden light only grew brighter, surging beneath his skin, seeping out little by little, unstoppably.

"BOOM!"
