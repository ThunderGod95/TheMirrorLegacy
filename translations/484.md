# Chapter 717: Jade True Unified Void

Daoist Master Shangyuan ascended the long staircase of clouds with unhurried steps. With each footfall, celestial music rang out and conch shells echoed loudly. The cloudmist on both sides transformed into immortals boys and girls. They carried baskets of flowers, scattering white jade petals like snow, trailing mist as they gently descended to the earth.

Each illusory maiden bore a unique grace that was exquisitely lifelike. Their garments were perfectly coordinated, as if they were living beings. One or two even looked up with curiosity, gazing toward the gathered Purple Mansion Realm cultivators above.

The white mist spread farther and wider in the sky. Pavilions and towers emerged within it, encircling Daoist Master Shangyuan. Nearby, a few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators watched with puzzled expressions and whispered quietly,n “What is this... no sign of water, fire, or the five elements, no convergence of qi, just white mist? Who breaks through like this...”

“They say it’s the path of illusion and reality...”

While the two whispered to each other, Yuan Su beside Li Xuanfeng also frowned. His expression grew wary, eyes narrowing as he stared into the mist. White jade petals drifted past and released faint mist as they fell into the lake below.

Daoist Master Yuan Su paused for a moment and murmured, “It truly is the Jade True Unified Void... I can’t believe Taiyue possessed such an immortal technique.”

Expressions among the crowd shifted subtly. Yet Shangyuan continued his steady ascent into the clouds. As he climbed higher, the surroundings churned violently. The white mist that was bright and dim, surged toward him from every direction.

Daoist Master Shangyuan spoke softly, “Green Jade Cliff.”

The moment he spoke, the wind and snow of the world suddenly stopped.

In the Northern Sea, where snow storms had raged for a thousand years, all fell silent for several seconds. Then, from the endless range of snowy peaks, large and small white pearls began to fall with a clatter, striking the earth in a downpour.

These white beads rolled and bounced with crisp sounds. Some broke thin layers of ice and sank into the lake, others rolled down the mountain slopes with a rushing clatter, and still others piled up in hollowed-out places.

The snow beneath his feet shifted from pure white to a soft blend of white and pale green, glowing faintly beneath the moonlight. Shangyuan exhaled slightly and intoned, “Patterned Brocade.”

In an instant, the falling beads transformed. The beads stretched and twisted into countless threads of white brocade that were dense and delicate. They drifted like cotton, blanketing the sky and blinding the view. Even a distance of one and a half meters became a vague, misty white.

The Dao lineage of the Jiang Family... Fei Wangbai’s Dao foundation...

Li Xuanfeng pushed his perception technique to the absolute limit, barely managing to make out a vague silhouette. Behind Shangyuan, a long robe had taken form, its silver-white patterns fluttering softly in the wind.

A gentle voice reached his ears, Shangyuan’s tone was light and contented, as if everything was unfolding with effortless ease, “White Jade Disk.”

Li Xuanfeng had heard of this Dao foundation before. Yu Yuxie in his day had cultivated it, but it required Supreme Yin Moonlight and Gao White Jade Essence, and the tradition had long been lost. As expected, it belonged to the Jade True Dao.

At that moment, the moon and stars in the sky dimmed completely, nearly blending into the night. In their place rose a brilliant and dazzling jade disk.

The moment the jade disk rose, the falling jade pearls and silk-like rain in the sky ceased. Daoist Master Shangyuan sat cross-legged in the air with the gleaming jade disk behind him. He was like an immortal or buddha reborn. The mist concealing his face finally dispersed.

His features were handsome, brows long and gentle. But now his eyes glowed pure white, staring unwaveringly into the heavens above.

He slowly turned his head, and white breath streamed endlessly from between his lips and teeth. Like waterfalls, the mist flowed from his hair and vanished into the air.

Yuan Su watched in silence, realization dawned in his gaze. Beside him on the clouds appeared the blue-and-white robed figure of Daoist Master Pu Yu. Pu Yu was full of astonishment as he said, “Marvelous... to think such a path exists! Incredible! This immortal art of Daoist Master Shangyuan’s could raise everyone’s chance of breaking through by at least half!

“If the ancient ways no longer apply, then one must seek their own nature. There’s no need to cling to the five elements or the twelve immortal qi. Those who seek clarity, seek clarity. Those who seek illusion, seek illusion...”

Daoist Master Pu Yu’s eyes gleamed, thoughts racing. He glanced at Li Xuanfeng beside him and murmured in praise, “He is just about to fuse his divine ability hence the signs of his immortal body’s fragmentation. A true genius... this immortal art must have been crafted precisely for the Jade True Dao. Such perfect resonance!”

On the other hand, Shangyuan did not pause. Word by word, he intoned, “True Dao Unification!”

In an instant, radiant white light surged. The cloudmist churned and rushed inward, converging around the bright jade disk behind Shangyuan, forming a vast white lake. At its heart, a luminous point of light began to take shape.

The gathered Purple Mansion Realm cultivators stared in awe at the divine light, but Daoist Master Pu Yu’s gaze passed over it and focused instead on Shangyuan himself. He secretly calculated and faint traces of blood began to rise on his fingertips.

Shangyuan subtly formed a hand seal, and streams of divine white light surged forward, striking the growing divine glow.

Above the divine light, a phantom shard of white jade emerged, slowly materializing. As it condensed, it became more solid. Then, it gradually began to fade into illusion again.

Shangyuan’s pale face regained color quickly. His eyes remained shut but glowed faintly like jade. His hands flickered between illusion and substance, and the white glow behind him surged and dimmed, struggling violently.

Jade rain began to fall once more from the sky. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators fell into silence. Some watched in envy, others in jealousy, and still others in deep unease. They were staring intently at Shangyuan.

Li Xuanfeng turned slightly. Yuan Su’s expression was filled with awe and envy as he remained stunned for over ten seconds, speechless. Beside him, Daoist Master Pu Yu stood silent, his eyes lowered, saying nothing.

Li Xuanfeng waited for a few seconds. Daoist Master Pu Yu glanced his way, then subtly pointed downward.

Li Xuanfeng looked down and saw a sea of pale green and white. Ice and stone had turned to jade and snow had become brocade. The entire Northern Sea ice peak had been utterly transformed into a Green Jade Cliff from top to bottom.

All the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators remained in an eerie silence. It wasn’t until every trace of radiance faded from Shangyuan, his form returning to that of a simple white-robed cultivator, his sword reverting to plain wood, that the silence began to stir.

He opened his eyes. He gave off a pure white aura. His body radiated a soft white glow.

The stars and moon dimmed. Shangyuan’s lips moved gently and his voice echoed from the great void into the present world, carrying far and wide, “I, Shangyuan, today in the Northern Sea have proven the Dao and attained the Jade True Unified Void Essence. I ascend to the rank of True Monarch. The foundation of jade across the world is now established. It may serve as array, as pill, as exalted immortal law, as talisman, as seal and as the cornerstone of the Jade True lineage...

“From the earth’s veins, jade shall emerge. The Jade True Dao may manifest in spirit items, spirit plants and spirit beasts. My Dao shall prosper. I leave behind a Sword Mansion and Jade Cliff as legacy for future generations.”

His voice reverberated, mingling with the soft tinkling of countless jade fragments. No matter what relationship each Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had with him. No matter friendship or enmity, envy or admiration, they now bowed in unison and said, “Congratulations, True Monarch Shangyuan!”

“We pay respects to the True Monarch of the Jade True Unified Void Essence.”

Daoist Master Pu Yu, filled with emotion, turned slightly to Yuan Su and said, “True Monarch Shangyuan... this is a proclamation of immortal achievement. A decree, as in the ancient immortal arts...”

Yuan Su gave a slight nod, lost in thought. Daoist Master Pu Yu sighed softly and muttered, “It’s time to go. With this breakthrough, many things have now been decided... Within the mainland and across the outer seas, who knows how many cultivators will now be tempted to attempt their own ascension.”

Yuan Su remained silent. He bowed quietly toward Shangyuan, then stood gazing blankly at the lingering mist.

Shangyuan tilted his head slightly, as if listening. Before him, something neither solid nor illusory faintly emerged.

It resembled many things, a robe draped over his shoulders, a stone cradled in his palm, or even a void. Shangyuan lifted his eyes and stared straight into the empty sky.

The clouds beside him parted, and two indistinct figures slowly materialized. One of them spoke, “Congratulations, Exalted Immortal.”

The second figure likewise bowed with utmost decorum, then withdrew a golden scroll from his sleeve. With a gentle flick of his arm, the scroll unfurled.

The two held the scroll between them, presenting it to True Monarch Shangyuan. The one on the left produced a writing brush from his sleeve and said respectfully, “Exalted Immortal, having transcended the mortal realm, we humbly request you erase your name yourself. We dare not commit such sacrilege.”

True Monarch Shangyuan slightly shook his head and remained motionless. The two envoys exchanged uncertain glances, unsure what to do, when Shangyuan said calmly, “I am not listed in the registry. You needn’t search.”

The two underworld officials looked at each other again, then put away the brush and rolled up the golden scroll. Only then did Shangyuan wave a hand and say, “Leave quickly. If battle breaks out, you two may be harmed.”

“Many thanks for the True Monarch’s compassion. We take our leave.”

Nodding repeatedly, as if granted amnesty, the two officials bowed deeply and vanished into a gust of ghostly wind, dissipating swiftly from heaven and earth.

Shangyuan slowly stood up. The white radiance behind him retracted into his body. He pressed his hand on the sharp green sword at his waist and said coldly, “Fellow Daoists. There’s no need to wait any longer!”

At those words, all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the sky bowed their heads in unison. None dared to move or speak. Li Xuanfeng suddenly felt his entire vision fill with deep blue-green. The entire world seemed to have shifted.

“The sky... is gone...”

The sun, moon, stars, and night sky had all vanished. In their place was a vast and endless ocean of jade-colored water. It stretched from east to west and was suspended overhead. Looking up, he could still see speckled island reefs floating above.

“This is... this is...”

The sea above mirrored the snow-peaked jade mountains beneath his feet and the Northern Sea far below. Heaven and earth were now both ocean, the boundaries of up and down completely blurred.

The endless jade sea above shimmered and closed in silently. Li Xuanfeng’s eyes throbbed in pain, golden stars flashing before his vision. He dared not look any longer. Yuan Su had already grabbed his armor and forcibly turned his head aside, facing his own.

Ning Tiaoxiao’s right eye socket was completely hollow, with emerald-green seawater pouring from it. His left eye was also sagging, half-melted, dissolving into a pale blue mass. His entire face looked as though it had been splashed with water. Liquid green flowed down in streaks.

Li Xuanfeng’s vision went dark. He barely saw a blazing comet-like star fall into the ocean and then something massive, vast beyond comprehension, like a titanic body, slithering from the sea above to the depths below. Its inky-black scales shimmered as it moved.

There was only silence in his ears. He heard nothing. The world seemed frozen in time, it was utterly still. And before him, Ning Tiaoxiao’s lips moved slowly, saying, “Pristine Water.”

Eastern Sea. Xia Mountain.

Xia Mountain, a sea mountain north of the Converging Sea. It served as a resting point for the Heavenly Glow of the Eastern Sea. Those that rose from the Northwest or Northeast would always pause here before continuing along the celestial firmament.

Sometimes, this pause lasted just a few seconds but other times, it continued for several hours. The glow from the Northwest usually flowed toward Qunyi, while that from the Northeast drifted back to the Great Western Plains of Wu State.

Being in the Converging Sea, this was naturally Dragon Clan territory. For ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, coming here was certain death. But Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were welcomed to gather glow , and the dragons would treat them with great hospitality.

As the Heavenly Glow rose, a young man flew in atop it. He was refined and dignified, with sharp brows and bright eyes. In his hand, he carried a gourd.

He landed lightly on the peak and checked the time with a frown of puzzlement. At that moment, a woman flew in on the wind, cradling a swirl of multicolored radiance in her hands. Her arched brows curved gently as she asked, “My husband, what’s wrong?”

These were, of course, the couple Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao’er. Li Xizhi was recovering and harvesting glow here, and Yang Xiao’er had come across the entire Eastern Sea to find him. She had only arrived the night before, with the help of escorts from the Yang Family. Without them, the journey would’ve been extremely perilous.

Li Xizhi was currently observing the glow. On paper, he was collecting it for Daoist Master Changxi, and he intended to perform this duty properly. After some mental calculation, he muttered, “How strange... Something must have happened in the Northern Sea. Not a single streak of Heavenly Glow has passed through. Could it be that a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator fell, disrupting the heavens?”

He calculated a little further and said, “And yet there’s no celestial anomaly in the Northwest... How can no Heavenly Glow pass through?”

Yang Xiao’er understood at once and said softly, “Husband, you’ve been secluded here. You may not know but in recent days, Daoist Master Shangyuan was to undergo his breakthrough in the Northern Sea. It must have been him... unintentionally halting the Heavenly Glow.”

Li Xizhi’s brow furrowed with worry. But since no glow was coming, he had time. He took Yang Xiao’er with him and flew down to their cave residence.

This dwelling, prepared by the Dragon Clan, was spacious. He shut the stone door tightly and asked quietly, “You came so suddenly yesterday, I didn’t have time to ask. This place is secure. We finally have a moment.”

Li Xizhi reached into his storage pouch and retrieved the feathered robe. It was tattered and torn, with a deep blue palm print scorched into the back. Yang Xiao’er’s expression turned panicked at the sight. She cried, “What happened to it?!”

Having missed her husband dearly after hearing he was at Xia Mountain, Yang Xiao’er had rushed over on the wind. She’d been puzzled when she saw he hadn’t worn the feathered robe she gave him but now, upon seeing it, her heart filled with dread.

“What happened?!” she asked.

Li Xizhi explained the situation in general terms, then asked softly, “This feathered robe of yours... it’s only at Qi Cultivation Realm, yet it held a golden light as a final defense...”

Hearing that, Yang Xiao’er first carefully made sure his injuries were no longer serious. Only then did she purse her lips and huff, “Oh, that’s all?”

She chuckled and said, “I had two feathered robes. One from the main Yang Family line, the other part of my dowry. I was worried, with you running around outside and so many enemies watching... so I made sure to prepare for that.”

Li Xizhi, quick-witted as always, immediately understood. He said gently, “So... you swapped the robes.”

“Of course I did. I’m not out there fighting for my life, no one would dare lay a hand on me anyway.” Yang Xiao’er gave a light, proud smile and said, “So the one you were wearing is the Yang Family heirloom robe... and the one I’m wearing now is the one from my dowry!”
