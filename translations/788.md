# Chapter 788: Two Letters

Pingya Island.

Li Zhouluo, dressed in black robes, was hunched over his desk, brush in hand. The lamps in the hall cast a dim, waning light. Dili Guang stood below the dais, silent as a statue.

An old man was ascending the steps, his back held ramrod straight. His features were proper, but his cheeks were gaunt, making him appear exceptionally frail. His expression was heavy, and the dark, forbidding sword at his waist inspired a natural sense of awe.

Li Zhouluo raised an eyebrow in surprise. Seeing the man arrive before the dais, he quickly set down his brush and rose.

"Elder Donghe," he said in a low voice. "Why did you come without sending word? We have troubled you to make this trip."

Chen Donghe had aged rapidly in recent years, growing thin and ever more silent, becoming a shadow of his former self. His skin seemed draped over his bones. He stood in the hall, completed his salutations, and spoke, his voice hoarse. "This old man is advanced in years. I am rigid and obsolete, and I dare not speak much in the hall. I merely came to see the Clan Head."

Li Zhouluo rarely wore the formal robes of the Clan Head, reserving them only for the most official occasions. He would only retrieve and wear that particular robe when he absolutely had to; the times he had worn it in recent years could be counted on one hand. His daily attire was, as always, his preferred black robes.

Chen Donghe’s gaze swept over him just once, taking in the precise style of those black robes.

Li Yuanjiao.

The last person in the clan who had habitually worn black robes was Li Yuanjiao, the man to whom Li Tongya had entrusted everything just before his death. He was also the man the Fourth Branch considered its founding patriarch, the one who had finally held the branch together. Although Li Yuanjiao also carried the status of having been adopted from the First Branch, he was, at that time, considered a member of the Fourth Branch.

'This young Clan Head before me,' Chen Donghe mused, 'is likely using this attire to declare his own legitimacy, to express his intent to emulate and learn from the past. As for how much ability he truly possesses... he likely cannot be compared to Li Yuanjiao.'

Just as Chen Donghe finished his assessment, Li Zhouluo spoke with a smile. "Elder Donghe is too humble. The clan is in dire need of capable hands. Chen Yang has repeatedly earned merits on the eastern shore, repelling the demonic cultivators several times. He even turned a retreat into an advance and nearly captured one of them alive. We must congratulate you, Elder."

"The congratulations belong to Moongaze Lake," the old man replied flatly, then asked, "I have heard in the last two days that Fei Qing'yi of the Fei family intends to break through to Foundation Establishment. He has come to the main hall to pay respects, hoping to acquire an Essence Gathering Pill. Is this true?"

This was a headache for Li Zhouluo, and the rumors had indeed been swirling wildly. It was true. He nodded. "Correct. Every vassal family has its eyes on this pill. He is currently staying in the side hall, waiting to see me."

Chen Donghe’s prestige within the clan was immense. For several years now, he had not held any practical positions of power, nor did he often see people. If this news hadn't caused such a commotion, it never would have disturbed him. Yet, the old man did not press for details about the Fei family. Instead, he said, "I hear... that we are short-handed on the lake. Now that Fei Qing'yi is preparing for seclusion, I find I cannot sit still. I have hurried here to see if the lake has any task for me."

Li Zhouluo was instantly overjoyed. The position overseeing Mount Qingdu was, after all, still vacant, and they lacked a suitable candidate. With Jiangxia having returned to the eastern shore, Chen Donghe, with his high prestige, was the perfect choice to reassure everyone.

"The Elder's righteousness is profound," Li Zhouluo said. "I will entrust the affairs of Mount Qingdu to you. I shall draft the documents immediately. We are troubling you, senior!"

Chen Donghe closed his eyes briefly and bowed respectfully before departing.

The stewardship of Mount Qingdu was a thankless job, one guaranteed to offend people. Chen Donghe’s willingness to support him solved an urgent crisis for Li Zhouluo.

'I fear the Old Ancestor himself had to personally persuade him to come and help me... *Sigh*.'

Li Zhouluo had no time to dwell on it; the matter of the Fei family still demanded his full attention. He picked up a letter from his desk. It was from the Pavilion Master of the Azure Pond's Heaven-Probing Pavilion—his own grandfather, Li Xizhi.

The letter mentioned many people, filled with heartfelt care. It also mentioned that Li Xizhi himself had gone to the Southern Sea to suppress demonic cultivators and could not return home often, but he had some news to pass along as a reminder.

"Fei Qingyi... within the sect, she has grown gradually closer to Peak Master Qin Xian of Siyao Peak. It seems they intend to finalize a betrothal soon..."

Although Fei Qingyi appeared to stand aloof from worldly affairs, she was no simple character. Several days ago, she had sought out Li Xizhi, stating that both her parents were deceased and she had no elders left in her family. She hoped Li Xizhi might act as her senior elder to accept Qin Xian’s marriage proposal. Her words had been utterly sincere.

In his letter, Li Xizhi had specifically noted that this Qin Xian was a trusted confidant of Dantai Jin, and the two were extremely close. And Dantai Jin had always been the primary representative of the Si family’s interests. How much of this proposed match was genuine emotion and how much was calculation was very difficult to say.

Viewed against this backdrop, Fei Qing'yi’s push for Foundation Establishment suddenly became... interesting. With Fei Qingyi having secured such a powerful connection, the entire Fei family took on a different cast. If Fei Qing'yi also became a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Li Zhouluo felt a deep sense of unease.

He mulled it over and finally gave the order. "Let Fei Qing'yi come in."

Dili Guang immediately withdrew. Before long, a man in white robes entered the hall. His face was handsome and elegant, with rounded features. The space between his brows and eyes was narrow, and his lips were red against white teeth—a sight that drew admiration. He bowed. "Qing'yi pays his respects to the Clan Head!"

This was Li Zhouluo's first time seeing him. He couldn't help but remark, "Qing'yi, what a handsome appearance. It is often said that the men of the north-shore Fei family are the most comely, and it is indeed true."

Fei Qing'yi replied respectfully. Li Zhouluo then asked about the Fei family’s recent situation: the spirit-rice harvest, and whether the cultivators dispatched by the Li family to manage their prefectural peaks were diligent.

The Fei family had only been vassals for a single generation, and the Li clan treated them gently. The stewards sent were either Fei family members themselves or individuals known to be friendly toward them. Naturally, in Fei Qing'yi’s telling, everything was perfect. After circling the topic, Li Zhouluo adopted a serious tone.

"Breaking through to Foundation Establishment is a matter of life and death. Since you are preparing for this, your family must be informed. Have you sent a letter to Azure Pond? What was the reply?"

At the mention of his sister, the young man clearly hesitated for a fraction of a second before answering, "I have sent a letter. Sister’s meaning is... that I should not rely on family connections. I must follow the standard process, report to the lake, and then submit the application to Azure Pond. As for the Essence Gathering Pill... that, too, must be handled according to the lake’s rules."

It was clear that regardless of whether his sister, Fei Qingyi, *could* procure a pill for him, she certainly did not dare to do so directly. Her attitude toward her own family was strictly professional. After hearing this, Li Zhouluo asked, "Your sister’s wedding is approaching; we certainly should not bother her. The lake will make arrangements for this matter. You cultivate Cold Qi. This Essence Gathering Pill will be allocated according to merit, but the slot must also be discussed by the peak masters. It is not a decision I can make alone. You must first go and pay respects to the Old Ancestor and hear his opinion."

Fei Qingyi nodded repeatedly, but then the young man hesitated. "Wedding?"

The look in his eyes was one of pure, unadulterated shock. That startled, disbelieving expression did not seem feigned, and seeing it, Li Zhouluo’s own heart shook.

'Fei Qingyi never even mentioned her marriage to her own family! This...'

Right now, Fei Qing'yi was staring blankly at the floor, his pupils dilated. Li Zhouluo felt a flash of awkwardness. He instantly realized that the distance and avoidance between Fei Qingyi and her vassal family was not entirely an act. And the avoidance was not just for his, Li Zhouluo's, benefit.

While handing a small missive requesting an audience—just delivered by Dili Guang—from Ding Weizeng, Li Zhouluo spoke with deliberate hesitation. "It seems my information traveled a step faster. I heard it was a joyous occasion. I only heard whispers, but it seems Fellow Daoist Qingyi and a certain Peak Master in the sect have formed a deep bond and are very much in love."

As he spoke, Fei Qingyi’s expression shifted from shock to joy. He was just about to ask for more details when Dili Guang stepped forward, bowing respectfully and interrupting. "Clan Head, Guest Elder Ding has an urgent report."

"Good! Bring him in quickly!" Li Zhouluo replied, his voice bright with relief.

Fei Qing'yi was perceptive enough to take the cue. Despite his burning curiosity, he knew he had to withdraw. Just as his hurrying figure vanished down the side-hall corridor, the look of relief vanished from Li Zhouluo's face.

"Show Ding Weizeng in," he said in a low tone.

Dili Guang withdrew, but the next sound was a chaotic rush of footsteps. To Li Zhouluo’s surprise, Chen Yang was the first to burst wildly into the hall. His dharma robes were torn and ragged, and a shallow red scratch marked his neck, but his expression was one of absolute delight. He bowed deeply.

"Clan Head! The Capital immortals Dao has retreated!"

Li Zhouluo shot up from his seat, his expression electrifying with hope. "What?! Where are the cultivators from Profound Peak? What about the territory?"
