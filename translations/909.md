# Chapter 909: The Radiant Fiend

Black qi diffused as white light rippled.

Fei Qing'yi rode the wind, sword in hand, pausing among the clouds. The black-robed youth before him paid him little mind. His gaze merely brushed past, landing instead on Cui Jueyin. With a flick of his sword, he casually handled all three of his opponents as if they were a joke.

This was nothing new. From the lake to Tangdao Mountain, whether it was cultivators from the Purple Smoke Gate or the Great Xiukui Monastery, they all looked down on him. Even rogue cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm received more respect. Despite being a guest elder of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, he was still treated like a plaything.

But today was different. The opponent’s sword strikes were all aimed at An Siwei, pressing the old man relentlessly. It seemed the youth was ignoring him, but in truth, he was secretly holding back.

But the gourd below was raised high. How long could the lake hold out?
As expected, with no one to control the demonic cultivator below, even those at the Qi Refining level had to brace themselves and advance. The first to block the red light were, naturally, his Fei family's Qi Refining cultivators. They were swept by a sleeve and instantly reduced to white bones.

The demonic cultivator laughed wildly and immediately turned. But just then, an old man rode the wind toward him, roaring, "How dare you act so atrociously!"

The demonic cultivator glanced over and saw a grey-robed old man at the Qi Refining realm, holding a sword. He instantly laughed and cursed, "And what qualifications do you have!"

At that moment, the crowd froze. In the sky, Chen Yang's expression changed drastically. "My lord, no!"

This man was none other than Chen Donghe!

Chen Yang, ignoring the demonic cultivator's weapons, swept out a wave of sword light, trying to intercept the fiend on the ground. Other cultivators immediately flew up from both sides. An Zheyan soared into the air to block him, but before the red light in the sky could even flash, a figure had already arrived, riding on flames.

This man wore a smile and held a golden hammer, treading on raging, apricot-colored flames. Who else could it be but Li Jiangqian?

The golden hammer, having built up power for some time, smashed down toward the demonic cultivator, wreathed in roaring flames. Before the dharma artifact even arrived, a wave of heat washed over him, making his expression change.
‘What potent Li Fire!’

He tried to draw a blade from his sleeve, but the man before him merely cleared his throat and spat a stream of apricot-yellow flame directly at his face.

The *Great Parting Scripture* was powerful in combat, and its flames were especially ferocious. The demonic cultivator had no choice but to form hand seals for his spell arts to resist the Li Fire. With a chaotic clang, black smoke exploded in the sky. The gourd, its black mist scorched by the Li Fire, tumbled from the air like a bird with a broken wing.

But his spell arts were cast in haste. He hadn't expected the flames to be so fierce. He barely managed to neutralize half of the attack; the rest splattered across his body, searing him until his face turned pale.

Li Jiangqian rarely took action, let alone now that he had broken through to the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. His appearance, wreathed in fire, brightened everyone's eyes, and the tense atmosphere eased. Fei Qing'yi even called out, "The Family Head is mighty!"

Li Jiangqian swung his golden hammer forward again, glancing back at him with a smile. Though it was a smile, his eyes were ice-cold, even holding a trace of mockery.

'Family Head... This must be a direct descendant of the Li family, no doubt!'

The demonic cultivator, though his face was twisted in pain from the burns, was inwardly ecstatic.

They exchanged several dozen blows. The two in the sky could no longer contain Cui Jueyin, and Li Jiangqian was fighting with increasing ferocity. Layers of apricot flame stacked onto the demonic cultivator, burning him until he howled in agony. A vicious thought formed in his mind.

'Good... very good... Even at this stage, they're only willing to send one out... Such caution!'

But before he could finish his internal curse, he saw the youth lightly shake his sleeve. A painted screen flew out, instantly sweeping away all the black qi in the air. Then, a golden blade shot out from within it, speeding toward his face.

He recoiled in sudden terror, slapping a talisman and circulating his immortal foundation. With a sharp clang, he blocked the golden blade. He was the weakest of the group, sent down as bait to harvest mortals; how could he withstand a suddenly appearing ancient dharma artifact? With all his black qi suppressed by the screen, he was powerless to defend himself as a massive hammer swung right at his face!

“Boom!”

A black cloud exploded in the sky. His entire chest caved in, burning with raging Li Fire. Terrified for his life, he instantly crushed a jade pendant in his sleeve.

Everyone on the field was stunned. Fei Qing'yi, however, could wait no longer. His expression was anxious, his heart cold.

'What are they still waiting for... It looks like the others definitely aren't coming out...'

But in that moment of distraction, he felt a sudden heat on the back of his neck. He whipped his head around in fright, only to find the golden-hammer-wielding young man had appeared behind him at some unknown time, watching him with a cold smirk.

Fei Qing'yi's heart plummeted, as if plunged into icy snow. He stammered, "Fam... Family Head..."

Li Jiangqian was unhurried. He barely moved. Those eyes that Fei Qing'yi never dared to meet stared at him, brimming with sarcasm. "Lord Fei, who exactly are you waiting for?"

That single, icy, sarcastic question plunged his heart into the deepest frost. As his mind went numb, names began to surface.

'That Daoist Master lied to me? Is Li Ximing back... or is there another Purple Mansion Realm expert on the lake?'

...

Baijiang Creek.

Helian Wumeng, clad in armor and holding a long-handled saber-glaive, watched the south like a spectator at a play. His armor glinted silver-white in the darkness. He seemed utterly at ease, clicking his tongue in appreciation from time to time.

Only when the apricot-colored Li Fire erupted did he chuckle and step forward. "The rigid ones are always so easy to deal with," he laughed. "Kill a few people, and they can't sit still!"

But he had only taken two steps before his eyes narrowed, and he stopped.

Ahead of him, the black qi receded from the clouds, revealing a man standing silently.

He was tall, dressed in golden armor that shimmered with platinum light, crafted from fine, dense scales. His expression was calm. Most peculiar were his eyes, which glowed with a complex, dark-gold color in the gloom.

Billowing white qi roared from beneath his feet, spreading out like a luminous white ocean. It rapidly transformed into various shapes—a chirping White Cicada here, a pouncing scaled beast there—dissolving all the black smoke and baleful qi in the sky.

Now that he had revealed himself, he simply stood there. The darkness in the sky rapidly dissipated, receding north like an ebbing tide. It shrank until it was a small patch of black sky behind Helian Wumeng, facing the brightness of the south.

The smile on Helian Wumeng's face slowly froze.

'Bright Yang... but not Li Ximing... The Li clan still has another trump card...'

His gaze turned cold, but he showed no anger, merely sneering, "I wonder which fellow Daoist I have the pleasure of meeting."

The golden-eyed, armored man looked up slightly. The clouds in the sky swirled, forming a scaled beast of white qi and mist. It descended, holding a long weapon in its mouth, circled him once, and delivered it into his hand.

It was a long halberd with a crescent-moon-shaped blade at its center. It was enveloped in a dense spiritual aura, emanating bright rays of light from within the roiling white qi. The rays seemed on the verge of solidifying, piercing the clouds, visible one moment and hidden the next.

He inverted the halberd, pointing it directly at Helian Wumeng. The cold edge gleamed. His voice was deep and resonant,

"Moongaze Lake. Minghuang."

Helian Wumeng was a direct descendant of the Tiefu Kingdom, a prodigy who had carved his way out of the mountains of corpses and seas of blood in the northern desert. He showed no hesitation. Instead, a feverish excitement lit his eyes. He glanced at Minghuang with a grin. "I've been fighting in the northern desert for so many years, but this is the first time I've met someone like you!"

He raised his saber-glaive. The plates of his armor flared with light, and the eighteen glazed beads at his waist lit up one by one. A fierce wind howled past, whipping up his black hair and revealing a necklace of white bone at his throat. He spoke in a cold voice, "Tiefu Kingdom. Helian Wumeng."

Before his voice had faded, the sky brightened. A halberd was already streaking through the air toward him, growing rapidly in his vision. It reflected a brilliant white light, the cold edge rushing to meet him, causing his pupils to contract.

“Clang!”

The multicolored light from the clash of divine abilities mixed with fiery sparks, sending vast ripples through the air. He held his saber-glaive in a direct block, intercepting the attack. The Grand Ascension Halberd, snow-white and marked with a scale-like pattern, stopped just an inch from his face.

“Good!”

A look of pleasant surprise flashed in Helian Wumeng's eyes. Billowing baleful qi surged up his body, empowering him with a dark, fiendish light. But in that brief instant, the dharma artifact blocked by his saber-glaive vanished. The attack changed from a sweep to a chop, descending from the sky with a torrent of white light!

“Boom!”

White mist exploded skyward. Helian Wumeng straightened his saber-glaive, planting it on the ground, and exhaled with a smile. Across from him, the scales on the golden-eyed youth's armor shimmered under the sun's light, his halberd angled toward the ground. Helian Wumeng's eyes narrowed, and his figure blurred, vanishing from the spot.

“Clang!”

The youth, however, was already holding his halberd in both hands, perfectly level. With a sharp clang, he blocked the descending saber-glaive—a weapon that was neither spear nor saber. The dark clouds in the sky were instantly scattered by the divine multicolored light that shot upward. A rapid series of ever-fiercer collisions followed. They fought for dozens of rounds. Helian Wumeng's entire body felt scorching hot, but he found it exhilarating. The demonic light from his saber-glaive gathered, growing more majestic, until it lunged like a great dragon bursting from the sea, trailing black light as it pierced forward.

Li Zhouwei immediately retracted his halberd, inverted its shaft, and sidestepped. The scales on his armor bristled under the pressure of the baleful light, emitting a piercing hum.

“Ding!”

The halberd jabbed. Its crescent-moon blade hooked the saber-glaive, tapping it lightly like a dragonfly touching water. His main body dodged, but the divine abilities collided. The force that traveled back to Helian Wumeng's hands was like a collapsing mountain, forcing him to laugh and release his grip on the deflected Spiritual Artifact.

A column of white mist shot into the sky as the Spiritual Artifact vanished. The northern barbarian's arrogant laughter echoed out. "Hahaha, good! Southerners only know the sword; they're unskilled with everything else. It's rare to meet an opponent who fights so openly, a true match for me! Let's fight!"

Billowing baleful qi erupted from his armor. Two vertical lines slowly appeared on the man's cheeks, splitting open to reveal two more eyes, both blood-red. In an instant, he transformed into a war general from the depths of hell. He reached into the void, grasped his returning saber-glaive, and lunged forward as a streak of fiendish light.

On the other side, Li Zhouwei rose on a golden light. His divine ability quickly re-covered the dharma artifact in his hand. He glanced at it. The small, crescent-moon blade on the weapon was humming as if it had been struck by lightning, clearly having sustained minor damage.

The [Grand Ascension] was, after all, only an ancient dharma artifact. Even if he protected it with his divine ability at every turn, how could it compare to the other's Spiritual Artifact?!

“Whoosh...”

A fierce wind battered his face. His opponent was already upon him, riding the wind, bringing with him a sea of baleful qi. Li Zhouwei's eyes narrowed. The space between his brows suddenly blazed, unleashing a pillar of light that pierced the baleful sea, causing the clouds to freeze and the black qi to scatter.
[Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light]!

Li Ximing had only begun to refine [Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light] after reaching the Divine Ability realm, but Li Zhouwei had already been cultivating it for over twenty years! At the same time, his Juque Palace erupted with light, and a speck of gold leaped forth.

A Purple Mansion Realm Supreme Yang spiritual item—[Concealed Plunder Gold]!

The dense golden light pierced the clouds. Helian Wumeng's face was cold, the fiendish light on his body so thick it seemed about to drip like water. He pointed his saber-glaive forward, meeting the radiance head-on!

“Boom!”

A torrent of white light surged into the heavens, illuminating the sky. The evening dusk was nearly transformed into the light of dawn. The saber-glaive froze for an instant in the golden light, shuddering left and right as if faltering. Just then, the halberd shot out from the Great Void.

“Clang!”

The crescent blade, radiating a dazzling white light, hooked solidly onto the polearm's shaft. The clash sent sparks flying with a piercing screech, exerting an immense force.

'Such nerve! He wants to steal my weapon!'

Helian Wumeng had ancestral knowledge and had heard of Li Ximing's divine abilities. How could he not know that the Bright Yang lineage's powers excelled at suppression? How could he let go? But before he could react, the golden-eyed man let go first, striking at his face with a divine ability-infused Heavenly Light.

His opponent had climbed out of a sea of blood, but Li Zhouwei had fought for countless years, standing guard at Secret Diffusion for a decade. How could he lack combat experience? His dharma artifact was inferior, so he would naturally trade his own weakness for his enemy's strength!

Helian Wumeng sneered internally. The two eyes on his cheeks rolled, transforming into two clusters of red light that enveloped his body, causing the incoming divine ability to sink as if into a swamp. He immediately tried to retract his saber-glaive.

'Trade for my strength? I won't even give your weapon back!'

A flicker of admiration passed through Helian Wumeng's eyes. Raging black flames suddenly erupted from Li Zhouwei. Four new, slender arms—two gold, two white—burst from his dharma body, each grasping an object!

The upper left held a pure white ivory fan, rolling with the fierce flames of [Profound Qi]. The lower left held a small flag painted with soaring birds, unleashing five types of boiling Li Fire. The upper right held a mountain of white jade, upon which immortal cranes danced. The lower right held a halberd of surging black flame, its power astonishing.

All four items shone with brilliant light, striking down at Helian Wumeng in unison!
[Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts]!

But that was not all. Behind the man in the platinum-scaled armor, a brilliant celestial gate rose through the clouds, ascending into the boundless heavens. Dragons and phoenixes circled it. Its two white pillars were already aimed, ready to suppress him at any moment!

Helian Wumeng's gaze, however, remained fixed on the surging black flames. The exhilaration from the intense battle froze. His pupils constricted.

'[Profound Qi]? Great Liang? The Touba family?!'

This hesitation lasted only an instant. Without a trace of doubt, he still refused to release the Spiritual Artifact in his grasp. He raised his saber-glaive slightly, blocking his chest with its pommel. A magnificent baleful qi erupted from his chest as if the gates of hell itself had been thrown open, spewing forth an endless torrent of demonic and fiendish qi.
'[Thousand-Hundred Body]!'
