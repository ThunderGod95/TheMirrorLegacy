# Chapter 752: Courtly Red Dust

Upon receiving the letter, Li Ximing recognized his brother's handwriting at a glance. As always, Li Xizhi’s tone was polite and carefully measured. It was the same courteous manner he had adopted in his letters home when he first became the Master of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion. Back then, it had seemed a sign of humility; now, even after Li Ximing had become a Daoist Master, his brother's tone remained unchanged, a testament that he was not one to ride on another's coattails.

Li Ximing read the letter, his thoughts turning inward.

'Si Xunhui... the Empty Response Dispersion.'

The Empty Response Dispersion was one of the three core Dao lineages of Xiaoshi Mountain. For the Si family to send one of their direct descendants to pursue this path, and to specifically request entry through his family’s gate, was a clear signal.

'Daoist Master Yuanxiu’s lifespan is running short. By having his own kin trained in a Xiaoshi Mountain lineage, he's likely hoping to stumble upon some opportunity. He wants a hand in their affairs.'

'This move serves two purposes. First, it gives him a way into Xiaoshi Mountain through my family. Second, it’s a gesture of goodwill. By having his descendant study under my brother, he’s securing an ally for the Si family’s future…'

Si Boxiu’s overture was not necessarily a bad thing for Li Ximing. The Azure Pond Sect was situated in a critical location, deep within their territory, and stability there was paramount. He considered the situation further.

'Si Xunhui is only at the Qi Refining realm. Wang Quwan is already on the verge of Foundation Establishment, so their paths are unlikely to cross. However, the other two lineages of Xiaoshi Mountain are still unaccounted for. Opportunities could still arise.'

He took out a brush and paper, penned a reply, and handed it to Li Jiangqian to be delivered. "You seem to be in good spirits," he remarked. "Is there good news?"

A smile broke across Li Jiangqian’s face. "The Daoist Master's insight is as sharp as ever. The Guanxie Pavilion has been completed and erected at the Inherited Clarity Gate. The Jade Court has also been built at the foot of Mount Yuting. Its palaces stretch on and on, and all the Court Guards have moved in. We have one at the Foundation Establishment realm, nineteen who have attained Qi, eighty-nine at Embryonic Breathing, and over twenty thousand elite mortal soldiers. It is truly a court in name and in fact. More than ninety-six thousand people reside at the foot of the mountain, far exceeding the conditions required for Qi gathering."

"A few days ago," he continued, his voice brimming with excitement, "Protector Li Wen went inside to gather Qi and truly manifested signs of the Courtly Red Dust Qi! The family's *Aged Courtly Path Sutra* can finally be cultivated!"

"Excellent!"

The Guanxie Pavilion was a crucial site for Li Ximing's own plans to refine a Spirit Embryo. He had been paying close attention to it but hadn't pushed for its completion due to the lack of a suitable artifact. He was pleasantly surprised it had been finished so soon.

As for acquiring the Courtly Red Dust Qi, it meant the family now had an additional Purple Mansion Dao lineage. Li Ximing was naturally overjoyed. Moreover, the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra* was an ancient technique practiced by the direct line of the Jiang family, survivors of a fallen Immortal Mansion. In this new era where jade was flourishing, its power might be far greater than imagined.

Li Jiangqian bowed respectfully. "I have come to request the Daoist Master's decree. How should we manage this cultivation method?"

Li Ximing tapped his fingers on the jade table. "The Court Guards practice the *Sutra of the Courtly Guardian*, a method designed for rapid progression. While the technique itself is unremarkable, its strength lies in the swift transition from Embryonic Breathing to Qi Refining. We typically select cultivators with lower talent from humble backgrounds to train in it. However, they are inherently suppressed by those who cultivate the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra* and would stand no chance against them. The cultivation of the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra* must be held firmly in our own hands."

There were other reasons the Li family used the *Sutra of the Courtly Guardian*. A critical factor was that gathering Qi for it was astonishingly cheap; one only needed to dig a well, requiring almost no spirit stones.

"When the Jiang family was destroyed, their cultivation method was scattered," Li Ximing recalled. "The surviving members should have all had copies, but they were later wiped out, leaving only the An family branch. I remember my father severed their connection to the technique long ago. Has this been thoroughly investigated and confirmed?"

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, I have looked into it," Li Jiangqian said respectfully. "There are still a few families with outside ties to the Yu family in Nanzhang, but during the rebellion, they failed to breach the Yu family's treasury and never obtained the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra*. However, in reading the Yu family's history, I discovered a small family on the northern part of the eastern shore with the surname Pu. They are descendants of the Jiang family. I made a special request for Granduncle Chenghuai to pay them a visit, and he found that they did indeed possess a hidden copy."

Li Ximing gestured for him to continue.

"I have invited the direct line of the Pu family here," Li Jiangqian explained. "I had the father and son swear a spiritual oath to sever their inheritance of the technique. As compensation, I established a hereditary position for them within the Jade Court to shelter their descendants. This branch will now cultivate within the Jade Court. In time, a newborn from their line will be sent back to the Pu family to inherit their title. After two generations, the technique's lineage will be completely broken."

"Well done. Although we now control the Qi, making the technique useless to others, it is wise to take precautions and prevent outsiders from prying into the secrets of our Dao lineage."

Li Ximing sipped his tea and nodded in approval, though other thoughts were brewing in his mind.

He had long known that Li Zhouwei's children were not close to one another. Over a century had passed since the clan’s founding. The three remaining main branches of the family still shared some kinship, but their numbers were dwindling.

Now, more and more of the cultivators in the region were geniuses produced by the sheer numbers of collateral branches, who would then return to the main family line. Having spent time outside, these returning members felt even more distant. With Li Jiangqian managing the mid-to-high levels of the clan's administration, outsiders and members of these returning branches were gradually becoming the majority.

'The blessings of a great man fade after five generations. The Youngest Branch, with my brother's help, at least managed to produce Chenghuai and Zhouluo. But the First Branch has been diluted by its vast mortal population. Though they have many cultivators, no true geniuses have emerged…'

Li Jiangqian had handled the matter beautifully, and Li Ximing offered no further comment. Yet, he understood the underlying politics. The An family held considerable influence in the Jade Court. Li Wen was a lone official with no faction, but this Pu family branch would undoubtedly become Li Jiangqian’s people.

He had to view every cultivator in the family not as an individual but as part of a larger web. Li Jiangqian was more than just himself; he represented the Second Branch and, through his mother, the An family. Whether it was Li Jianglong or Li Jiangxia, their innate desire for power was one thing, but the power they gained served not just them but the factions behind them.

Li Jiangqian had his own supporters: the An family, the Second Branch, and a large group of cultivators who upheld the system of primogeniture. From another perspective, wasn't this move also a self-preservation tactic by the An family, an attempt to shore up their waning influence after the loss of An Siwei?

There was nothing inherently wrong with it, so Li Ximing let it be. "This technique is powerful," he said. "Someone from the direct line must cultivate it. I recall Li Jiangliang is only at the Embryonic Breathing realm. By the time he is ready, the Qi will be available for him to harvest. Let him be the one."

"As you command," Li Jiangqian replied, but then added, "However, there was a marriage agreement for Jiangliang with the Profound Peak Gate."

"They wouldn't dare bring it up now," Li Ximing answered dismissively. He hesitated for a moment, however. If the Profound Peak Gate did produce a Purple Mansion cultivator in the next few years, the matter might not be so simple. He amended his decision. "In that case, let Jiangnian cultivate it. As for Jiangliang… let your father decide his path!"

Li Jiangqian acknowledged the order and withdrew. After a moment of quiet contemplation, Li Ximing’s form flickered and vanished into the Great Void.

***

The Eastern Sea.

Jagged black reefs pierced the sky. Waves crashed against them, not with white foam, but with an inky darkness. The surface of the sea held no reflection. Here, in the far eastern reaches of the Eastern Sea, the spiritual Qi grew thin, and the fabric of the Great Void became placid.

Beneath the surface, the water was a profound, lightless black. Occasionally, a few spirit fish would dart by, but the depths were otherwise empty. In the midst of this deep, silent vista, a young man in a green robe with a golden tassel at his waist sat cross-legged, his eyes shut in meditation.

Before him pulsed a colossal array of interwoven turquoise patterns, like a gigantic agate dome sealing the seabed. The reef below, hardened over millennia to a point where even a Foundation Establishment cultivator would struggle to scratch it, was sliced cleanly apart as if it were tofu, its severed pieces scattered across the ocean floor.

After an unknown amount of time, the young man slowly opened his eyes. His irises were a pale cyan, and the restless Pristine Water swirled around him, forming a faint turquoise halo that stood in stark contrast to the black water of the deep sea.

"Friend! What do you think of my formation?"

The young man’s cheerful voice traveled through the water, unimpeded by the crushing pressure, and pierced into the array. A second later, the sea around the formation began to boil violently, and a thunderous shriek echoed out.

"Chi Buzi! Have you lost your mind? When have I ever offended you?!"

Chi Buzi rose from the reef and descended through the water, a smile playing on his lips. "It is precisely because you have never offended me that I can trap you here, is it not? It’s only been two years of refining, and I haven’t even made my move yet. What’s the rush, friend?"

"Besides," he added, "this is the World's Navel, the domain of the True Monarch of Wondrous Transformation. My reverence and admiration for her are boundless. I would naturally not take your life in this place. You can rest assured!"

Chi Buzi’s words fell, and the demon inside the array was so incensed it fell silent for three full breaths.

He knew exactly how aggrieved the demon felt. He had laid this trap piece by piece, a late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator with four divine abilities preying on a weaker target. He had fabricated traces of ancient ruins, pretended to enter seclusion nearby, and then simply waited for her to come to him.

She had seen the formation from the Great Void but, assuming it was merely part of a Purple Mansion cultivator’s seclusion, had paid it no mind. As she drew closer, she was deceived by Chi Buzi's art of concealment and failed to notice that the array was a full circle larger than it appeared to her spiritual sense.

Even then, the demon had approached cautiously from a distance, remaining beyond the array's reach. Chi Buzi had patiently played along for nearly two years before she finally, inadvertently, stepped before the array and was ensnared by his divine ability.

Once she was trapped, Chi Buzi had used a spiritual artifact to suppress her, reinforcing the array with his arts day after day. He had waited in silence for two years, to the point where the demon almost believed the array was malfunctioning and that he, too, had been fooled.

Now, the truth was out. The demon was on the verge of coughing up blood. Her voice, surprisingly, was that of a charming young woman. "Chi Buzi! Even we beasts know of parents and kin! You, a man with no sect and no clan, who stood by and watched the Azure Pond Sect fall into new hands, you are a truly fickle villain! Not a single word from your mouth can be trusted. My only regret is believing you, never imagining you were just some unhinged madman!"

Chi Buzi laughed. "Only a beast would fail to understand. Sects use secret teachings to coerce and control you. Clans use bloodlines to establish their tyranny. The two are intertwined, a turbid current of filth. How could I allow my enlightened self to be shackled by such vulgar, mortal concerns? And you, a mere beast, can only speak of parents."

Though she was also at the Purple Mansion realm, the demon was no match for Chi Buzi, who had studied the classics since childhood. His words left her speechless. "I may be a beast," she retorted, "but you are a monster! How can you say such things?"

Chi Buzi no longer deigned to reply. He stepped into the array, and as he did, the surrounding seawater transformed from black to turquoise. It separated into two layers, turbid below and clear above, a change that extended all the way to the surface, where a downpour began to fall from the sky.

As Chi Buzi entered the formation, walking upon the Pristine Water, the Purple Mansion demon was terrified. She had only just broken through to her realm. With the Great Void sealed off, how could she possibly be his opponent? "Chi Buzi," she pleaded, "I have sworn an oath beneath the Tree of One Heart! The Luan-Phoenixes know my name. You should think carefully about what you're doing."

He answered her with a smile. "I chose you precisely for that reason! What does it matter if they know? You swore a single oath. In your current predicament, who will bother to come for you?"

In an instant, the array erupted with power. The might of the Pristine Water surged, and a brilliant Lesser Yin radiance filled the space, coalescing into countless icebergs like fields of white snow. A gloomy aura began to rise but was mercilessly crushed by the Pristine Water.

The demon had the appearance of a beautiful young maiden, clad only in a translucent blue veil. But under the crushing force of the Pristine Water, she could no longer maintain her form and revealed her true self: a spirit sparrow with brilliant blue and white feathers.

Chi Buzi had not even glanced at her human form, as if he were afraid it would dirty his eyes. But her true form made his eyes light up, and he looked her up and down with admiration. "Excellent, excellent," he sighed. "Another feathered-beast, just as the ancient texts described. Lesser Yin transforms into feathers, Bright Yang into carapaces. The latter is often considered a fallacy, but the former is almost always true!"

The spirit sparrow couldn't comprehend why this person was so intent on harming her. Hearing him ramble on about ancient books, she gritted her beak in fury. "Idiot…"

The two clashed, their battle shaking the formation and churning the sea outside. Light and shadow flickered across the surface as the rain continued to fall, unabated, for more than half a month. Several cultivators passing by were drawn to the phenomenon and stopped to observe from a distance.

"The Pristine Water flows without end. Could there be a treasure emerging here?"

Their cultivation was too low to venture into the deep sea, so their watch was fruitless. Down below, the Purple Mansion demon was nearing her limit. After a long and brutal fight, most of her feathers had been shorn off. Pushing back against the Pristine Water with all her might, she charged toward the edge of the great array.

With a desperate, muffled cry, she slammed her head into the formation's barrier. The impact was made with suicidal force. With a deafening boom, the demon's head exploded into a thick, ghastly white mist that splattered across the array.

A divine ability flared. The great array, already weakened by half a month of attacks, finally wavered under the powerful blow. In the single instant that it faltered, a sliver of the Great Void was exposed. In that instant, the demon vanished.

Chi Buzi remained unhurried. With a casual wave of his hand, the great array shrank and flew back into his sleeve. Bolstered by his own divine abilities and spiritual artifacts, he knew the demon could not have outrun him even at her peak, let alone now that she was grievously injured.

He murmured to himself, "What an obedient little demon. I said she couldn't die at the World's Navel, and she dutifully fled elsewhere to do it!"

Chi Buzi tore open the Great Void and sped through, but it was empty, as if no trace of her remained. He paid it no mind. He extended a hand, hooked his little finger, and touched his thumb to his index finger.

'From where do the clear and turbid arise?' he chanted internally. 'In the radiant pool, I see ice and scorching heat and bitter cold—these are the traces of Lesser Yin.'

His eyes flashed with understanding. He stepped through the Great Void and immediately spotted the spirit sparrow. She was fast, but not fast enough. Halfway through her flight, she gave up on the Great Void and plunged back into the physical world.

The moment the spirit sparrow emerged, she found herself above the sea, right where the group of cultivators was still gathered. There were more than a dozen of them now, scattered about, each warily eyeing the others, all convinced a treasure was about to surface. The injured Purple Mansion demon, without a second thought, devoured them all—ancestors of great families and masters of small temples alike—and flew away without a sound.
