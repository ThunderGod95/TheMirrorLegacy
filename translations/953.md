# Chapter 953: The Baleful Star

White snow drifted through the air as Helian Wumeng unleashed a rampant demonic aura. His signature long-hafted saber struck like lightning, a crimson radiance wreathing his face, displaying an utterly tyrannical power.

But Ning Wan simply stood amidst the falling snow, two fingers pressed to her lips. Twenty-eight small, immaculate white flags hovered in the air, forming a great, suspended furnace that drew in the surging bloodlight and demonic qi, sealing it completely within the formation.

Although Ning Wan had only recently reached the Purple Mansion Realm, she was already renowned throughout Azure Pond as a formation prodigy. She was especially famous for her ingenuity and adaptability in the dao of formations. With her twenty-eight flags, she conjured a new array from thin air, tightly sealing away all her opponent's baleful energy.

Several motes of immaculate snow-light danced around his saber, only to be scattered by its force. Yet, the falling snow from the sky constantly gathered to replenish them.

It wasn't that Helian Wumeng feared her techniques. The Cold Qi Daoist Tradition was not considered powerful, and besides, Ning Wan's cultivation was lower than his. He had already charged across the riverbank three times, pressing her so hard he had nearly shattered her grand formation. But that had only earned him a cold sneer as the woman drew forth the Great Snow's Severing Edge.

Helian Wumeng immediately backed down. He refused to take a single step across the river.

'Great Snow's Severing Edge...'

The reputation of this Spiritual Sword was already immense. In recent years, having been wielded by Lingmei and then Lou Xing, its fame once again resounded through the north. The great Vija, a fifth-life Maha, had been so thoroughly defeated by it that all his honored statues and clay effigies in the northern temples had shattered. Although the Way of Great Desire refused to admit it, claiming he had merely reincarnated, everyone knew he had truly fallen.

'If some hidden power remained within that blade, and I rashly crossed the river, and the formation restrained me for even an instant... one strike from that sword, and I'd be paying my respects to the Helian ancestors.'

But while he held his position, summons kept coming from the tent behind him. He pretended not to hear them. It wasn't until several phantasmal lights faintly appeared on the southern river that he leisurely descended, landing on the bank and entering the grand hall manifested by the dharma artifact in the sky.

The first person he saw upon entering was, of course, his elder, Helian Wujiang, who stood with a grim expression. On the other side was the white-robed demonic cultivator, Xindu, along with that Daoist Master Yehui, Bai Ziyu. One looked perfectly at ease, the other wore a faint smile. As for Murong Yan and Shilou Yingge, those two scoundrels were colluding off to the side, snickering about something with ill intent.

Only Qi Lanyan, who stood in the host's seat, offered him an indifferent nod, which passed for a greeting.

In this hall representing the north, you couldn't find three people who were of one mind. The Viewing Pavilion Daoist Tradition, the Scions of King-Marquis, the demonic dao rogue cultivators, and the Purple Mansion Realm masters from Jiangbei—each harbored their own agenda, scheming against who-knew-who in the shadows.

Helian Wumeng wasn't a good-tempered person to begin with. He moved to stand beside Helian Wujiang, his face cold and silent. Only then did Qi Lanyan smile and speak.

“Fellow Daoists, I must make a trip to the territory of Xuanmiao Temple to support Fellow Daoist Kong. A fight is likely. Which of you are willing to accompany me?”

He seemed to have been waiting just for Helian Wumeng to return, asking the moment he arrived, unwilling to delay another second.

Helian Wujiang's eyes narrowed. For a moment, no one responded. But the silence was quickly broken by a cheerful laugh.

“I await Lord Qi’s arrangements!”

None of the Purple Mansion Realm masters needed to look; they all knew it was the Viewing Pavilion's new recruit, Daoist Master Yehui, Bai Ziyu, who was always so obsequious. The others, however, remained silent, calculating and undecided.

Since arriving in Jiangbei, Qi Lanyan had always been polite, never putting on the airs of the Viewing Pavilion. This matter, however, was far from simple.

'The Supreme Yang may be failing, but they still have cards to play. A direct move on Shanji Prefecture... that will inevitably stir up chaos. Sword Gate is right there, and Purple Smoke and Xiukui are allied more closely than ever. If we cross the bottom line for all three... they might just decide to fight to the bitter end.'

Everyone knew that Shanji Prefecture had been Jiangnan territory for ages. This military advance was tantamount to shoving the north's power right in the faces of Sword Gate and Purple Smoke!

Although they had all been sent here with thoughts of plunder, none of their families were lapdogs for the Viewing Pavilion. Naturally, they were unwilling to be the ones to stick their necks out.

Among them, Murong Yan had the deepest background. Though polite on the surface, he often watched events with a cold, detached gaze. Now, he remained utterly silent, merely nodding with a faint smile.

Qi Lanyan scanned the room, his gaze landing on Helian Wujiang. He smiled.

“Fellow Daoist Helian?”

Despite being put on the spot, Helian Wujiang remained perfectly calm and replied respectfully:

“Years ago, when our state was in turmoil, only the Viewing Pavilion faction came to our aid. The two of us have no way to repay that debt. We await your command!”

“Good!”

Qi Lanyan laughed. The one with the weakest background, the demonic cultivator Daoist Master Xindu, still looked hesitant. Just as he was about to speak, Qi Lanyan cut in.

“In that case, I will go north to invite one more Purple Mansion Realm expert. We should have enough manpower then.”

Daoist Master Xindu wasn't trying to defy him; he was simply afraid of losing his own men. Although he had been present at the Battle of Luoxia, that had been on northern territory. How could it compare to striking deep into the south? Yet, Qi Lanyan easily overlooked his brief hesitation, turning with a smile to Murong Yan.

“I’ll be troubling you all, then!”

Murong Yan smiled and nodded, watching him depart. He then turned to Shilou Yingge beside him and said with a mocking laugh:

“What’s this? Fellow Daoist Shilou is also unwilling to go?”

Shilou Yingge had come south far less for personal gain than to secure his political standing; he desperately wanted to shed the Wei-Li label. Naturally, he was reluctant to take such a risk. Yet, watching Qi Lanyan's exit, he felt a deep unease. Though awkward, he forced a smile.

“I can’t be bothered to run around.”

As the two chatted idly, Qi Lanyan had already left the hall with his men, not looking back. He smiled all the way to Xuanmiao Temple, where Kong Tingyun rushed out, riding the wind, to pay her respects. Qi Lanyan quickly helped her up and spoke with a serious tone.

“Is the [Central Palace Mystic Brocade Pill] working well? My Junior Sister wrote to me just the other day asking about you... She’s planning when to have you enter the temple to receive your cultivation technique.”

Kong Tingyun's expression was noticeably dimmer than in the past. She understood her situation all too well now. She could only force an eager smile and reply:

“Thank you both, my Lords, for your concern... This superior-grade spirit pill... I truly don't know how I can ever repay you.”

Qi Lanyan shook his head, then pointed to Helian Wumeng and Helian Wujiang, introducing them. Kong Tingyun acknowledged them, but pointedly ignored Yehui, who stood with his hands clasped behind his back. Qi Lanyan exchanged a few pleasantries as they descended onto the mountain.

“I also came today to resolve the enmity between you two,” he said, looking between her and Yehui. “You have both achieved divine abilities, after all...”

Yehui maintained his bright smile, betraying no emotion, though his eyes were as deep as a clear pool. Qi Lanyan, however, had no real intention of resolving their conflict. After a few empty words, he made an excuse for Yehui to depart.

Kong Tingyun felt stifled. Qi Lanyan, however, merely sipped his tea. He glanced at Helian Wujiang, who was busy observing his surroundings, and said casually:

“Fellow Daoist Helian... coming to Xuanmiao Temple is a decision you certainly won’t regret.”

At these words, Kong Tingyun’s expression flickered. A chill went through Helian Wujiang’s heart. He looked up to see a mocking smile finally touch Qi Lanyan’s lips.

“Whether Shanji Prefecture can be taken or not... if you follow my Viewing Pavilion... the Helian family will not suffer any losses.”

The sky had grown dim. Xuanmiao Temple adhered to ancient customs and did not light lamps on the mountain, leaving the small courtyard shrouded in the pale purple of twilight. Only the faint multicolored light emanating from the three of them provided any illumination.

Helian Wujiang felt a mix of shock and dread. He first offered his thanks, then probed in a low voice:

“Even a setting sun retains some of its brilliance, my Lord. You must still be careful.”

“Hahaha...”

Qi Lanyan let out a low, chilling laugh.

“When it comes to foresight, none of you compare to Bai Ziyu. Even now, you still see this as a mere Daoist traditions dispute between a few families! Even Kui Qi had figured it out, yet you still don't understand the origin of this entire situation!”

He rose to his feet, turned slowly, and began to recite:

“The Cultivation Transcendence... its nature is that of the Baleful Star. It arises in times of chaos, bringing conflict between states, warfare, great plagues, and the death of ministers. When it flourishes, the hearts of men turn treacherous, law is abused, crime runs rampant, generals face execution, nobles are imprisoned, and clans suffer sudden calamity.”

“Although that figure in the north learned his lesson, do not forget what kind of being He once was! The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition weakened and never recovered. Where did the problem lie?”

Both men were silent. Helian Wujiang stared at him, his eyes burning, the question clear on his lips. Qi Lanyan smiled.

“It lies in the return of Jade True, which proved that the position was empty!”

He turned back, his voice dropping to a low whisper.

“From the moment the Jade True Six-Nine Void returned, it looked like a great victory for the righteous path, a Sword Immortal attaining the Dao. But in reality, the momentum of the Baleful Star was already set. The southern Dao paths all celebrated, ignorant that they had just placed their own necks on the executioner's block, merely awaiting the day of their death!”

...

The north bank.

Li Zhouwei was briefly watching the distant battle when a figure landed beside him. The man wore gray robes, carried a sword on his back, and had a grave expression. He bowed.

“This old man is Chen Yin of Yushui. Greetings, Fellow Daoist.”

“So it is Daoist Master Yushui.”

Li Zhouwei figured several Purple Mansion Realm masters must be in the vicinity, but he didn't know why this one had revealed himself. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, he asked a direct question. Only then did the Daoist Master smile.

“Ah, so Fellow Daoist Zhaojing is still in seclusion... I received word from Fellow Daoist Dingyang Zi. I heard your esteemed clan possesses some Neck Feathers, but I don't have any artifact-refining materials on hand, so I came to inquire.”

“I see.”

Li Zhouwei then remembered the man was a Mansion Water cultivator. He must not have been able to make a trade with Dingyang Zi, so he had come seeking him instead. Chen Yin continued with a serious expression:

“Although I lack refining materials, I do have a Upright Wood spiritual item I found in the Southern Sea: [Blameless Spirit Wood]. I would like to trade it for one or two of your feathers.”

He retrieved a jade box from his sleeve. Inside lay a fist-sized, blue-black block of wood. It looked like countless thin layers of wood pressed together, its grain clear and brimming with spiritual energy.

“This Upright Wood is extremely hard. It takes on the properties of metal, yet is not metal, so it cannot be forged into armor. However, it is excellent for crafting small accessories. As for whether it can be used in alchemy... you'll have to ask your clan's great master.”

“It’s quite a large piece!” Li Zhouwei remarked appreciatively.

Chen Yin smiled. “This piece was originally the size of two fists, but I cut a portion off to craft a sword hilt. This is the remainder. It's still a substantial amount, and I wish to trade it for two Neck Feathers.”

The Li family could produce more Neck Feathers in the future, so trading them for different types of spiritual resources was a good way to prepare for future needs. Li Zhouwei nodded in agreement.

Chen Yin was instantly delighted. “Fellow Daoist is truly straightforward!”

He smiled and offered his thanks, then asked with a hopeful expression:

“If I may be so bold... where did your esteemed clan obtain these? And how many do you have left?”

Li Zhouwei shook his head, his expression natural. “I’m afraid that is not convenient to disclose. We have few remaining. My grand-uncle is in seclusion, and I don’t know if he has traded any others away. He might have one or two left. When he emerges, Senior, you may ask him yourself.”

“My apologies, my apologies.”

Chen Yin quickly agreed. Not wanting to overstay his welcome, he soon took his leave. After he had vanished into the Great Void, the white-robed woman descended on the wind, landing steadily in the pavilion. She spoke softly.

“Greetings, Fellow Daoist Minghuang!”

Ning Wan's aura was as gentle as ever, but her brow was heavy with deep sorrow and anxiety. It was as if her heart was burdened by countless things she could not voice.

“Senior, you are too polite.”

Li Zhouwei returned the bow. The two walked toward the center of the island and took their seats in the main hall. A cultivator served them tea. After a moment's thought, Li Zhouwei asked:

“What are the Lord’s arrangements?”

At his question, Ning Wan lowered her head.

“We are to move immediately,” she replied. “The Lord’s orders were to wait for you to emerge from seclusion.”

Apparently, while Li Zhouwei had been in seclusion, several of the Supreme Yang Daoist Traditions in northern Yue State had reached a consensus—or perhaps, had been forced into one: they had to defend Shanji Prefecture.

Li Zhouwei, however, felt calm. He asked a pointed question.

“What are Hengzhu’s arrangements?”

Years ago, Yehui had visited the Li family and alluded to this southern Immortal Dao, even hinting at the Taizhu behind it. He had accused them of sitting on the mountain to watch the tigers fight, remaining hidden and uninvolved.

The information Yehui possessed might not have been entirely accurate, but it wasn't baseless. Hengzhu's actions likely held a deeper, unusual meaning.

In response to his question, Ning Wan shook her head, an unreadable smile playing on her lips.

“You haven’t heard, Fellow Daoist? It’s excellent news. A few days ago... Hengzhu’s Daoist Master Hengli successfully passed the Purple Mystery and attained four divine abilities. It’s such a pity for Senior Tinglan. If she hadn't been injured back then, given the time that’s passed, she would likely be making her own breakthrough by now.”

“Oh? That is indeed joyous news...”

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. Seeing no trace of joy on her face, he voiced his confusion. As he suspected, Ning Wan’s smile vanished. She said flatly:

“However... when our people went to Hengzhu to offer congratulations, they were informed that the Hengzhu Dao is preparing to seal its mountains. Their entire Immortal Dao is focusing on preparations for Hengli’s ascension to the rank of True Monarch.”

Li Zhouwei fell silent, unsure how to respond. Ning Wan's expression was complicated as she continued.

“Senior Tinglan and the others... they discussed it for a while. I don't know what was said. There are some matters that are no longer appropriate for me to hear. But by the same token... there are things I am no longer fit to speak about!”

Hearing this, Li Zhouwei knew it was even more inappropriate for him to comment. He could only lower his head, pretending he hadn’t heard. Ning Wan shook her head and let out a heavy sigh.

“At dawn, I must send word to Tinglan and Houfu. The northern forces are gathered on the bank. We will head north together, cross the river, and make landfall. The Lord will provide support as we move to retake Jiangbei.”

The night receded. A faint golden light rose from the horizon, heralding the dawn. It climbed the walls of the great hall with startling speed, draping itself over Ning Wan.

Her expression was filled with profound unease. Her lips trembled as she whispered:

“So... this is what it feels like to be trapped in a situation beyond one's control.”

Motes of golden light flickered in Li Zhouwei’s own eyes. He extended his hand, and the brilliance of the Grand Ascension gathered, condensing into his great halberd. He watched Ning Wan quietly and sighed.

“Senior. Please proceed.”
