# Chapter 985: Pure Yang

The Spiritual Treasure, mirroring itself in Shilou Yingge's eyes, struck him with a sudden, bone-deep terror. With a sharp mental command, he urgently recalled the four crimson-veined miniature swords to shield his front. His brow suddenly flared with radiance, and a ripple like water appeared, from which a single object leaped out, roused by the Spiritual Treasure's assault.

It was crimson and no larger than a finger, a plume from some kind of bird. Its downy filaments drifted and swayed as if alive, and a brilliant, circular arc of True Fire encircled it, shedding a magnificent radiance.

Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume!

This was a major treasure of the Gao family, originally a Spiritual Artifact that the Valiant King Gao Fu had nurtured his entire life. When Shilou Yingge was to travel south, Gao Fu, anxious for his safety, had specially entrusted it to him to preserve his life-mandate in a moment of crisis.

He had only just managed to release the radiant plume when the golden light rushed straight at him. The four crimson-veined miniature swords, despite being urged to their absolute limit, were still too late to arrive in time. They transformed into four streaks of crimson light, trailing behind the golden radiance and generating a thunderous sonic boom in the air.

"Hoooom!"

The True Fire arc of the Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume rained down, hundreds upon hundreds of filaments locking onto the oncoming golden light. The profound bracelet instantly burst with radiance, its once-unadorned surface suddenly covered in countless dazzling white profound runes!

'Crack!'

The Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume had been activated with such desperate urgency that, even as a top-tier Spiritual Artifact, its arcing light failed to lock down the Spiritual Treasure, which brutally tore through it in a torrent of golden light!

"Rumble!"

The man in the sky, like a True Fire celestial deity, paused for only an instant before plummeting like a falling star, sweeping away the roiling clouds. Heavenly Light and Bright Yang radiance erupted together, rocketing into the heavens!

"Cough, cough."

As the torrents of Heavenly Light and rainbow clouds slowly dissipated, Shilou Yingge climbed out of the rubble. The golden-red cloth on his chest was torn, revealing the coppery skin beneath, which was now like shattered jade, gleaming and covered in a dense, web-like pattern of impact cracks.

Torrents of True Fire poured from the fissures in his Dharma body, causing the air around him to visibly warp. Shilou Yingge coughed twice, spitting out a mouthful of Heavenly Light. The ring of True Fire behind his head dimmed slightly, and the flames on his body flickered.

The Spiritual Treasure's attack had been unexpected and possessed the ability to bewilder the mind. Unlike many immensely powerful Spiritual Artifacts, its hit probability was extremely high, yet its power was just as great. Even with the Pheasant Radiant Fire Profound Pillar already transformed and the Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume suppressing the attack, he had still suffered a considerable loss.

Putting aside the damage to his Dharma body, the torrential Bright Yang Heavenly Light coursing through his form was continuously disrupting his internal divine abilities. The Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume had no choice but to return to his brow to help suppress the chaos.

Shilou Yingge, however, showed little surprise, his eyes instead filled with a complex expression as the image of the Spiritual Treasure replayed in his mind.

'This is...'

Pure Yang Bracelets!

'Emperor Gong's ritual vessel...'

Others might not recognize the Pure Yang Bracelets, but the Gao family knew them well.

The Gao family possessed the scrolls detailing Emperor Gong of Wei's northern tour. The objects he bestowed upon Touba Changming and Shilou Chongyang back then were two pairs of spiritual bracelets!

These two pairs were named Everlasting Peace and Exalted Harmony. Their form was similar to the Pure Yang Bracelets that Emperor Gong of Wei had granted his younger brother, Li Guangheng. Exalted Harmony was still in the Gao family's possession; though not a Spiritual Treasure, its power was terrifyingly great!

A single glance was all it took for him to recognize the Spiritual Treasure before him, sparking even greater suspicion in his heart:

'The Dragon-kin gave it to him! It must have been the Dragon-kin! When the Wei Dynasty fell and Li Guangheng perished, the Pure Yang Bracelets were taken by the Zhaohe Dragon Princess and have been in the hands of the Dragons ever since...'

He was briefly dazed, just as the Heavenly Light and rainbow clouds before him began to dissipate, and a golden blade leaped from their midst.

The Grand Ascension had arrived!

Blood still trickled from Shilou Yingge's lips, but his eyes once again welled with a crimson True Fire radiance. A shimmering profound light poured from his eyes to meet the halberd head-on, while the four crimson-veined miniature swords arced through the sky, aiming for the man's back!

"Clang!"

The sound of profound light clashing with the halberd echoed through the sky, sweeping away all the smoke of Radiant Fire and the Heavenly Light. The man before him was covered in golden profound runes, his entire body still ablaze with Supreme Yang fire, sections of him shining brilliantly and here and there. The Supreme Yang Leveling Profound Light had yet to disperse!

Those golden eyes, however, fixed upon him with an air of pure killing intent.

"Bang!"

From the Supreme Yang fire, a dark flame suddenly erupted, and four arms manifested behind him, each grasping one of the miniature swords, carrying a wave of fierce and ominous flames. Shilou Yingge's internal divine abilities were still in turmoil; his ability to forcibly unleash a spell art at this moment was a testament to his extremely high Dao-Profundity, but he could not control the small swords. The four crimson-veined miniature swords were captured!

The Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts had been acquired from the Eastern Sea. While not low-quality, it specialized in destroying sects and shattering prefectures, and was a Profound Essence Art for demon-slaying. Li Zhouwei's mastery was not high enough to confront such Spiritual Artifacts directly, and this art was not meant for defense anyway! A light twist of the four small swords and the four arms exploded.

But that brief moment was already enough!

The searing profound light of True Fire struck the halberd, only to be sliced apart by the crescent-moon blade, transforming into a five-colored torrent of True Fire that scattered in all directions. It was intensely hot, scorching the surrounding area and causing it to burst apart. Li Zhouwei's body was also blazing with Supreme Yang fire, but a brilliant circular point suddenly appeared at the center of his brow.

Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

A pillar of golden-white light immediately surged forth. Taking advantage of the fact that Shilou Yingge's divine abilities had yet to recover, it slammed into his face with astonishing speed. The surging profound light of True Fire was abruptly severed, and the scion of the Gao family was sent flying back once more, a trail of fiery red light behind him as he crashed heavily into a nearby mountain!

"Rumble!"

The mountain peak tilted and then collapsed with a crash, kicking up a vast cloud of dust.

'Vicious enough.'

Li Zhouwei's move was not meant to inflict lethal damage with the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. It was intended to force the Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume in his opponent's brow to emerge and defend, allowing the residual Heavenly Light in his Dharma body to continue its mischief, thereby seizing the initiative. Yet, Shilou Yingge was willing to take the hit rather than fall further into passivity!

In the span of a single thought, Li Zhouwei's figure appeared atop the collapsed mountain peak. The radiance at his brow instantly turned a dark color, a solar eclipse omen emerging:

Emperor Qi's Light!

Thousands upon thousands of streams of light, golden in front and black behind, surged forth. They fell upon the mountain peak like a cascade of lightning, shattering the crumbling rock and pulverizing it completely. A coughing of blood rang out as golden light erupted from the shadows, and hundreds of Radiant Fire figures fled, gathering in the distance.

"Cough, cough..."

The flesh on Shilou Yingge's face was gone, revealing stark white bone beneath, but it was rapidly re-forming. The ring of True Fire behind his head had long since vanished. The Pheasant Li March was in effect; at a huge cost, he had finally managed to escape!

He held both hands out at his sides, True Fire surging forth. The Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume had already finished suppressing the turmoil within his divine abilities, leaping from his brow and releasing ten thousand rays of light.

"Ssssh!"

Twelve intensely brilliant, golden-red beams of True Fire descended simultaneously from the heavens!

The Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron immediately sprang from mid-air, manifesting its massive original form. A gale of wind whipped from its mouth, attempting to consume the twelve golden-red beams of True Fire.

But the Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume had been building up power for a long time, and the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron was simply not its equal. Furthermore, its Biyi Form, which possessed the ability to contain things, was not its primary function. It only held for an instant before its magical capacity was reached. The cauldron instantly transformed into a sheath of white light, shielding Li Zhouwei!

Li Zhouwei's body was already blessed by the radiance of the Radiant Sun King's Halberd. In the single instant the profound cauldron had bought him, he had already shifted his position. Although the golden-red beams of True Fire in the heavens followed him, he had enough time to turn the Grand Ascension back!

"Hooom..."

The Grand Ascension did not move to resist the immense True Fire. Instead, it gently hooked the four almost formless crimson-veined miniature swords from within the blaze. The swords' edges were brilliant, clearly having been urged to their maximum power.

But with the spiritual swords blocked, the True Fire faced no further obstruction!

"Boom!"

The intense True Fire radiance exploded across the heavens and earth. Li Zhouwei was once again sent tumbling from the clouds. A small azure jade bowl had appeared atop Shilou Yingge's head, raining down spring winds like sweet dew, both protecting his form and rapidly nourishing his Dharma body.

But no matter how much nourishment he received, the radiance of the Pheasant Li March clearly would not recover in a short time. Shilou Yingge could only silently lower his eyes, looking down at the ground.

On the ground, a haze of smoke was dissipating. Li Zhouwei slowly rose to his feet. His body was blazing with True Fire, with the flames of Supreme Yang and True Fire interwoven, causing his body divine ability to hum and buzz, subtle cracks beginning to appear.

'What a Sovereign's Perilous Tread!'

The two men stood in a tense standoff. Just as the tide of battle was about to turn, two more streaks of light appeared from far away, morphing into figures as they drew near. One wielded a spiritual sword, slashing forward, while the other suppressed the area with a magical spell art. They cried out in unison:

"Sir Shilou, we've come to help!"

Li Zhouwei had to stop catching his breath. He once again raised his halberd, parrying the spiritual sword. The radiance on his brow flashed, and the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light instantly shattered the other person's spell art. He focused on them.

One had a drooping beard and a purple-and-white robe, his bound hair held in place by a horizontal jade hairpin. This half-foreign attire belonged to the two men who had vied with him for a Spiritual Treasure in the Hall of Radiant Fire just moments ago!

'How audacious! They must have been looking for an exit from this domain, stumbled upon our fight, and decided to take advantage of my old feud with the Gao family to get greedy!'

The two men's sudden appearance startled even Shilou Yingge.

Li Zhouwei's guess was correct. These two were Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from the Xiangli clan, a relatively new aristocratic family from the Yan State with shallow roots. One, Xiangli Zhuyun, had good talent, while the other, Xiangli Shiyu, was far less gifted.

His plan had been disrupted, and Shilou Yingge secretly frowned.

He was fighting Li Zhouwei not for some spiritual treasure or object, but to save the Gao family's honor, to wound his opponent, or even better, to reach a mutual defeat. Why would he need help? Feeling a wave of discomfort, he could only watch with a frown.

At this moment, the two attacked together. Cinnabar rain poured down, and a white vapor surged up. Li Zhouwei's eyes, however, brightened. He raised his halberd and swept it forward!

"Clang!"

The Cinnabar Rain was instantly swept away by the Heavenly Light. The longsword flying through the air was suddenly lifted, and the golden radiance of the Grand Ascension shattered its divine ability. The Attachment leaped up, not advancing, but instead retreating and thrusting towards the man's body.

The scorching white radiance spell art from the side drew Li Zhouwei's attention. He gave it only a glance, holding his halberd with one hand while he raised the other high and brought it crashing down.

"Bang!"

This indescribable white radiance divine ability had no time to display its power before the Sovereign's Perilous Tread shattered it into a stream of light. The Grand Ascension only slowed for a moment, its brilliant blade still pointing at Xiangli Shiyu's heart!

A chill ran down Xiangli Shiyu's spine.

From a distance, it had seemed manageable, but in a real confrontation, the pressure resurfaced in his heart, his face grim. He felt that the man's body divine ability was terrifyingly powerful!

'Not even a Maha is this strong... and a Maha wouldn't have so many spell arts and divine abilities!'

'Damn it!'

Heavenly Light shattered in the sky, and the white radiance protection divine ability descended, enveloping Xiangli Shiyu. His sense of alarm was at its peak, yet the Li Zhouwei before him simply shifted his halberd, striking the divine ability.

The white radiance divine ability trembled violently, sending Xiangli Shiyu himself flying. Li Zhouwei did not hesitate for a second. The real threat was already materializing in the sky: the twelve profound beams of True Fire from the Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume were descending, and the onrushing Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron had been pinned in place by Xiangli Zhuyun, who was controlling the Cinnabar Rain!

"Boom!"

From within the torrent of True Fire, a brilliant celestial gate finally emerged, its floating rainbow clouds and flickering Heavenly Light illuminating the area. The colors on Li Zhouwei's face grew more intense; he coughed up a mouthful of blood, but his True Fire burned even more fiercely, and his aura was climbing!

The Sovereign's Perilous Tread was already operating at full power, and thanks to the collective assault of his opponents, its strength was constantly rising, already about thirty percent higher than before!

This thirty percent increase might not seem like much, but it was enough to allow him to stand his ground in the air under the added power of the Audience with the Celestial Gate. He could cough up blood and not take a single step back, even radiating endless radiance from within the scorching True Fire and Supreme Yang flames.

He held his halberd in one hand, pointing it slantwise to the ground, and held his other hand out in front of him. The profound bracelet on his wrist was now gripped in his palm, and he gradually tightened his hold on it. His golden eyes seemed to pierce through the boundless flames, fixing on Shilou Yingge behind the True Fire!

Shilou Yingge's expression froze. The iridescent glow of the Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume rapidly dimmed as it rushed back to defend.

He couldn't fathom how Li Zhouwei, who had been knocked down by the Crimson Li-Phoenix Plume even with the added protection of the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron, could now remain completely still amidst the profound light of True Fire, even with the cauldron held back!

"Clang!"

Before Shilou Yingge could understand, the Pure Yang Bracelets in Li Zhouwei's hand disappeared.

"Rumble!"

A crimson streak of light fell to the ground like an arrow from a bowstring. Shilou Yingge's figure plummeted from the clouds, but the golden silhouette of the Audience with the Celestial Gate was fleeting. The halberd hooked upward!

Having succeeded in his attack, Li Zhouwei immediately rushed towards the now-wielding-his-sword Xiangli Shiyu, whose face fell in shock.

The Xiangli Zhuyun at his side had just managed to hold back the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron, but he never expected Li Zhouwei to be so terrifying when fighting for his life. The Spiritual Treasure's radiance was brief, but how could he not be stunned? Seeing his clan brother being attacked, he immediately activated his divine ability, causing Cinnabar Rain to fall from the heavens, all of it condensing on Li Zhouwei in an attempt to stop him.

Xiangli Shiyu was both shocked and enraged. The divine ability beneath his feet came to an abrupt halt, and the white radiance re-condensed as he released a Spiritual Artifact to prevent the other party from activating the Spiritual Treasure.

But he never expected the fierce Li Zhouwei to simply graze past him and speed away!

Each stream of Cinnabar Rain pierced his bones and marrow, riddling the ground with countless holes, but it was too dispersed. With his Sovereign's Perilous Tread flaring, layer upon layer of power stacked up, and he vanished in a streak of golden light in the distance.

The two Xiangli brothers exchanged a look, both feeling a sense of relief. When they looked down again, Shilou Yingge had already vanished, leaving only utter devastation. In the ruins, True Fire blazed, Heavenly Light flowed, and the land was scarred and desolate.

"Who knows what he got..."

The expressions of the two men had just relaxed. They had traveled a short distance when the flickering radiance above their heads began to slowly dissipate. Xiangli Zhuyun's expression changed, filled with surprise and uncertainty:

"The Great Void?"

The suppressive force that had enveloped the heavens had abruptly vanished. The aura of the Great Void re-emerged, and a violent tremor shook the surroundings. Mountains collapsed and ruins caved in, causing both men's faces to change color.

"The Grotto-Heaven can't hold on!"

In a flash, the two men disappeared, and all the streaks of light that had been roaming this domain also flew away one by one, their figures gone. In an instant, the scene shifted from extreme motion to extreme stillness. The entire Grotto-Heaven was shrouded in a faint mist, a dark radiance rapidly shimmering and its colors growing dim.

The True Monarchs had already left.

Only the few Great Daoist Masters at the central peak were still locked in combat, their battle causing flowers to rain from the sky, strange phenomena to appear, the Grotto-Heaven to rip apart, and the Great Void to separate. A torrent of spiritual energy swept forth from the mountain peak's center, causing tens of thousands of kneeling corpses scattered amongst the dense buildings to fall over one by one, rolling everywhere in the desolate wreckage.

Only the headless corpse dressed in a crane-down cloak embroidered with sacred scriptures, standing at the foot of the mountain, remained motionless.

The rolling storm only stirred the soft down on his collar and the plumes of his cloak. The spiritual sword in his hand hummed slightly, as if it were waiting to become a prize once the Great Daoist Masters had settled their score.

The head on the ground, its eyes tightly shut, rolled gently in the storm, coming to rest face up.

A wisp of handsome black hair floated across his prominent nose. The rumbling of the Great Void grew louder, and a hazy white light enveloped the head, causing the closed eyes to tremble. His pursed lips moved softly and silently, as if whispering:

"They killed... my Daoist..."

The headless corpse draped in a crane-down cloak and scriptures slowly bent down and cupped its head in its hands. In the surrounding gloom, the purely black eyes opened, staring silently and blankly at the sky.

"And now... they plunder... my Daoist Tradition..."
