# Chapter 1032: The Dynasty is Named Song

## Simin Prefecture

The night was thick, but a faint, milky whiteness was already bleeding into the edges of the sky. In the pre-dawn gloom, the moon offered no light, leaving the stars to burn brightly, awaiting the rising sun.

The Celestial Hall's gates were sealed. Yellow brocade hung from the railings, and the green locks were etched with profound patterns that seemed to glow in the shadows. Soldiers clad in blue-black armor stood motionless before the steps. The entire palace was steeped in an unnerving silence, broken only by the occasional cry of a crane echoing between the roof beams.

A gentle breeze rustled the hanging brocade, stirring the air. Above the main entrance, a black plaque bore characters of gold that cast a burnished, yellow light into the darkness.

[Palace of Revering Martial Arts]

In the sky above, hundreds, even thousands, of white cranes circled the great hall in a unified, silent vortex. Their wings blotted out the stars. Now and then, one would drift down to land on a palace eave or beside the stairs, folding its wings and tucking in its legs to feign sleep.

Before the hall, banners like long serpents rippled in the wind. Courtyard paths, fashioned to look like intertwined serpents of water and fire, led inward. The vast, dark-red plaza was lit by lantern stands placed every ten paces, and between them knelt a multitude of cultivators. All were dressed in identical uniforms, their heads bowed to touch the ground, perfectly still.

A hundred yards out from the hall, a set of nine steps led down to a lower, broader terrace. Here knelt men and women, young and old, all clad in simple blue-black robes. They were arranged in corresponding positions to the cultivators above, yin facing yang, a mirror image of their elders. They were the descendants of the bloodlines.

Despite the thousands of cultivators kneeling in silent vigil, the palace remained profoundly quiet. As the first light of dawn began to creep up the walls of the Celestial Hall, it illuminated two figures standing near the highest point.

One was a man, his chest puffed out and his brow held high with a confident air. He wore green robes, a sealed scroll hanging from one side of his belt and a golden talisman from the other. He cradled a sword in his arms.

Facing him stood a woman dressed in a simple white robe. She held a wooden box decorated with blue-black profound patterns. Her expression was calm and serene, but the box in her arms trembled with an unnatural energy, as if something was trapped within. From time to time, jets of intertwined water and fire would erupt from it, only to slide harmlessly down her fair white arms, leaving not a single mark.

Nine steps higher, standing beside the main hall, was another man. He was tall and slender, with captivating golden eyes that made his handsome features all the more striking. He wore layers of white and patterned silk beneath a black, straight-collared robe accented with white designs. Crane feathers adorned his shoulders, making his posture seem exceptionally upright.

It was Li Jiangliang.

His expression was solemn and grave. He waited as the stars shimmered in their final moments before fading, but his patience was wearing thin. Finally, he could wait no longer. He bowed from the steps and spoke in a reverent tone.

“May Your Majesty ascend the throne, ride the transformation of water and fire, command the sign of the intertwined serpents, and rightly face the south. The people of the four seas will be endlessly fortunate.”

He waited for a moment. An official emerged from the side of the hall, listened for instructions from within, and then announced respectfully, “Lord Li, you may enter.”

A flicker of surprise crossed Li Jiangliang’s face. He offered a bow and entered through a side hall.

Inside, a flight of eighteen steps, each a deep, foreboding red, led upward. A waterfall of purple energy cascaded down, carrying with it a refreshing and profound sensation.

At the top of the stairs was a side door, black with golden patterns. Pushing it open, Li Jiangliang was met with the thick, cloying scent of sandalwood. The chamber was filled with a dense fog of incense, and through the haze, he could make out several white figures.

They were women—naked, hairless, their bodies perfectly smooth. Their faces were round and their skin was pale. Some held treasured robes of blue-gold, others held blue-black sashes. They stood or knelt in various poses, as motionless as statues.

The women were arranged in a staggered formation at varying heights. Behind the main immortal seat, carvings of dragons and phoenixes adorned the wall, flanked by paintings of two Flood Dragons whose bodies stretched out like giant pythons.

Beside the seat stood a young man in a simple white robe, his long hair unbound, his back turned to the entrance.

Li Jiangliang dared not raise his eyes. He took a step back and knelt at the threshold.

“Your Majesty’s benevolence embraces all living things, and your Dao illuminates the world,” he intoned, his voice trembling slightly. “This servant’s mortal body is filthy and unworthy. I dare not ascend to the Feng Wu Immortal Hall. I can only prostrate myself before the steps and await the immortal command.”

His voice echoed in the hall. A clear, cold voice, like ice, answered from above.

“Enter.”

Li Jiangliang had no choice but to rise and cross the threshold. The moment his foot touched the floor, he felt a sharp crunching sound. Beneath a layer of white qi, the entire floor was covered in a crystalline layer of crystallized brine mixed with frost.

Suppressing his shock, Li Jiangliang walked slowly forward until he was ten paces from the man. He stopped just before the statue-like women and bowed again.

“This servant is here.”

The man on the dais turned and descended the steps. With his movement, a purple mist materialized and white frost condensed in the air. His face was defined by short eyes, dark pupils, and exquisitely shaped brows. He fixed his gaze on Li Jiangliang.

“You there.”

Li Jiangliang, after a brief apology, immediately took the blue-black inner robe from one of the women’s hands and draped it over him. Yang Zhuo watched him silently, then spoke.

“Years ago, when We were traveling, We intervened on behalf of a few minor cultivators whose provisions had been stolen. It was then that We met you on your journey south, and so our friendship began… Thinking back on it now, it all seems so vivid.”

He smiled faintly, raising an eyebrow. “Did you ever suspect… that any of it was part of a larger plan?”

At the mention of this, Li Jiangliang lowered his gaze. “Your Majesty… this servant saw no plan. I saw only a chance to entrust my life’s ambition to a worthy cause—a chance to rise above the petty squabbles of my clan and gain the power to save the common people. That was enough for me.”

“Save the common people…”

Yang Zhuo stared at him, his lips moving slightly as if to say more, but he held his tongue. His expression became unreadable. “You have been my companion since childhood and are wed to my sister. You stand above all other officials. You deserve a share of the credit for today’s victory.”

Li Jiangliang would not dare accept such praise. He bowed deeply. “Your Majesty is the lord of ten thousand chariots, your rule mandated by Heaven. Your destiny is fixed. It is not something this servant can claim credit for. I can only serve before the throne and obey your every command.”

Yang Zhuo continued to stare at him. “That is not true. Without you, the Great Song today would have far fewer citizens and far more useless officials lining their own pockets. Though We became Emperor without achieving the Golden Core, Our power is nonetheless immense. You deserve to share in this glory.”

“I am bathed in Your Majesty’s grace.”

Yang Zhuo’s gaze shifted. “Among the kings, King Wei is the most esteemed. He contended for the fortune of the north and south and pacified the sects of the Huai River region. The various heirs must be rewarded. Which emissary should We send for his enfeoffment today?”

Li Jiangliang, now holding a white silk inner garment with a black collar and blue trim, began to dress him. “To avoid any appearance of favoritism, this servant dares not answer.”

Yang Zhuo glanced at him. “It would be awkward for you to go. We shall send Daoist Master Ning instead.”

Li Jiangliang simply assented and added the next layer of ceremonial robes. He listened as the man, a reincarnation of True Qi and a figure of unimaginable nobility, spoke again.

“In the Lixia region, when the poison of the Way of Great Desire was rampant, it was Our command that not a single person be killed. The cultivators all followed this order. Only you advised me not to let the remnants of that path flow into the prefecture. The loyal and the disloyal—the difference is clear.”

Li Jiangliang hesitated for a moment. Instead of reaching for the next sash, he knelt on the floor and said in a low voice, “This servant is ignorant and does not understand. Since Your Majesty has the power to cleanse all corruption, why not use your divine ability to resolve the situation at once? Why not eliminate the karmic evil of the Golden Lotus, rather than allowing its followers to enter the prefecture? I fear that in the future, a heretical cult will rise again in Lixia, and it will take a hundred years to restore peace.”

Yang Zhuo’s eyes were fixed on him.

“What is changed is changed. The karmic evil of the Golden Lotus now resides within them. It is as if they have been reading those scriptures for years. Even if the influence of the Great Desire recedes, their minds have still been corrupted. If a man sees a ghost, even if We command the ghost to leave, We cannot restore his mind to a state of never having seen it—not unless We were to tamper with his very soul.”

He continued, “True faith must come from the heart. If others wish to believe in the Buddhists, and you use your divine power to change their minds, you are no different from the Buddhist cultivators themselves.”

“To change the world with one’s own heart is the Dao of the Wei Emperor and the Sheji, not the way of Tianwu. When the Way of Great Desire poisoned them, the people of Lixia had no freedom not to believe. Now, under Our rule, they will have the freedom not to believe in me. Since the Way of Great Desire is gone, We want them to choose for themselves.”

Li Jiangliang could only lower his head. “This servant was reckless.”

He remained kneeling and picked up a pair of white jade boots with profound patterns. As Yang Zhuo lifted his foot, he said, “With the new dynasty established, your father holds the north, but Jiaozhi cannot be neglected. We must appoint a protector-general. Since Liu Bai is in the Purple Mansion Realm and holds the Chu State military tally, you will go to Jiaozhi and deliver the order for him to assume command.”

“As for the name of the protectorate…”

He paused. Li Jiangliang spoke respectfully, “We have discussed it. Since Jiaozhi overlooks Shitang and is responsible for pacifying the sea, under the Song dynasty, it could be called ‘Jinghai’—Pacifying the Sea.”

The words made Yang Zhuo’s pupils constrict slightly. He frowned. “Ignorant… The character ‘Jing’ for pacify is not good. It violates the naming taboo of a revered one. Replace it with the character for ‘quiet.’ Suppress it with tranquility, and it shall be settled and eternally peaceful. We shall call it the ‘Jinghai Protectorate’—the Protectorate of the Tranquil Sea.”

“Yes!”

Li Jiangliang dared not ask which revered one’s taboo had been broken. He quickly agreed, kneeling firmly as he raised the imperial crown—round in the front, square in the back, with twelve tassels of five colors—and bowed his head as low as it would go.

He was, of course, not qualified to place the crown upon Yang Zhuo’s head.

But the man about to be enthroned as the Song Emperor held the crown without moving, staring at it.

“The imperial mandate… originated with the Wei,” he said coldly.

“This crown is a copy of theirs. Round in the front and square in the back to represent the pivot of Heaven and Earth, the ultimate Yang. Twelve tassels of five colors to represent the five virtues and twelve forms of qi. The Qi and Liang dynasties were mere imitators. One claimed ‘Dawn Qi,’ the other ‘Profound Qi,’ yet each was but a single strand of the twelve, and still they wore this crown.”

“Now, ‘True Qi’ has attained the Dao. Why, then, are we still copying the Wei system?”

A chill went through Li Jiangliang’s heart.

This coronation ceremony was not his own invention; he had coordinated every detail with Yang Tianyou, and the plans could be traced all the way back to Yang Ruiyi. Yang Zhuo’s question was not necessarily aimed at him.

But even if it wasn’t, he still had to answer.

“Replying to Your Majesty, the Imperial Monarch was above worldly affairs and ruled through inaction. Though Ning followed Wei's calendar, it was established by all houses, That is why the five-colored, twelve-tasseled crown was used. Now that True Qi has been re-established, it is proper to follow the old system.”

“Imperial Monarch,” Yang Zhuo repeated, raising an eyebrow.

“Cultivators value the word ‘True.’ We seize the fortune of Heaven and Earth and take it as our truth. The Tianwu became an emperor by achieving Truth, not the other way around. Is that why He was often called a True Monarch? Is the matter of an imperial mandate not… superfluous?”

Cold sweat began to bead on Li Jiangliang’s brow. He could only say, “It is for the peace of the world!”

“Hahahahaha!”

Yang Zhuo placed the crown on his own head. Li Jiangliang fell prostrate beside him, feeling an immense wave of cloudy qi emanate from the new emperor as he strode forward from the white mist.

The Song Emperor paused at the doors of the hall. Placing a hand on the massive gate, he spoke, his voice calm. “You all call him the Imperial Monarch, but you don’t realize he sought Truth, not an empire. His talk of ‘curbing indulgence with righteous nature’ was the work of his predecessors. His ‘infinite benevolence’… who knows who it was for, but it certainly wasn’t for the common people. If the people had mattered more to him than his search for Truth, would he have ever left this world?”

Li Jiangliang did not know how to respond. He could only watch as the emperor strode out of the hall. A roar of acclamation rose from outside, and the air roiled with water and fire. The sky was a vibrant, shimmering canvas of teal and indigo, filled with countless streams of profound light.

Countless multi-colored serpents dropped from the sky, slithering and climbing up the pristine white steps. The purple mist before Li Jiangliang’s eyes grew thicker, and he felt the cold, slick bodies of snakes coiling around his arms, slithering past him from all directions.

Strangely, he felt no joy in his heart, only a profound sense of confusion and a bizarre feeling of disbelief.

Was this cold, calculating emperor truly the same heroic warrior with whom he had shared wine and conversation while escorting that convoy south all those years ago?

‘If pacifying the Yue State and founding a dynasty was never your goal back then, how did such a grand situation come to be? The Yang Zhuo of the past would never have said such things… Your Majesty… what is your ultimate goal?’

Outside, the ceremonial bells and cauldrons chimed in unison. An official chanted the rites, seemingly bestowing honors. Li Jiangliang could faintly hear the words as he knelt in the hall. The white mist around him was rapidly dissipating, revealing the female forms, still frozen in their poses.

Their bodies had already petrified into a jade-like substance, an immaculate stone, yet their skin still held a pinkish, lifelike luster and gave off a faint scent of peaches. Their eyes were bright and seemed to be on the verge of movement.

He rose slightly, his head still bowed toward the emperor, and naturally slipped out a side exit to kneel outside.

Dong!

A profound bell toll echoed. As the officials kowtowed, thousands of white cranes descended from the sky. They soared over the heads of the kneeling cultivators, their wings beating the air, and landed on the lower terrace among the tens of thousands of descendants.

The cranes were enormous, and they brought with them a gale of wind and roiling currents of water and fire. Yet the kneeling men and women seemed not to notice as the great birds landed, one by one, on the lantern posts beside them.

Dong!

With another kowtow, the massive cranes standing among the crowd lifted one leg. As the bells and cauldrons sounded, they spread their vast wings, covering the men and women on either side of them. The fit was perfect, seamless, until the entire lower terrace was nothing but an endless sea of white.

This white merged with the white of the sky, momentarily dazzling Li Jiangliang and forcing him to lower his head again.

“The Mandate of Heaven has descended upon the martial cultivators. A nation was won between the rivers to quell chaos and aid the people, enduring for many years… When the age of the Tianwu passed, the world nearly fell into ruin… This year, water and fire were overturned, and destiny came to rest in my body. Following the immortal decree, We shall cultivate the martial path once more… Entrusted by the myriad people, We establish a nation and ennoble its lords, fulfilling the hopes of every house, founding a state, and ruling as Emperor…”

The magnificent, immortal voice resounded through the air as endless streams of water and fire roiled across the heavens. Yang Zhuo took a step forward.

“The dynasty shall be named Song,” he declared, his voice calm and clear.

Dong!

Li Jiangliang looked up again. It was the darkest hour before dawn. The moon was gone, the sun not yet risen, but a single star, bright as the sun itself, suddenly blazed forth, illuminating the world like a divine eye of the profound heavens gazing down upon the earth.

The light was blinding, yet it brought tears to Li Jiangliang’s eyes.

The Martial Cultivation Star was shining!

Om…

In an instant, Heaven and Earth were filled with light. A tremor ran through the Great Void. Intertwined currents of water and fire swept across the world. Throughout Jiangnan, every cultivator looked up at the sky, their faces pale with shock and fear.

‘The celestial phenomena have changed!’

In the Great Void, the reaction was even more pronounced. Streaks of light appeared in the silent, empty darkness. Powerful beings performed divinations with their fingers or sank into deep thought, their brows furrowed in silence.

‘The spiritual aura has shifted…’

But below, in the palace, there was only awe and trepidation. Even the Daoist Masters waiting before the hall had their heads bowed in silence. Suddenly, a clear voice rang out from the side, filled with reverence and solemnity.

“The Ning Clan…”

“...presents to Your Majesty a pair of dragon tendons!”
