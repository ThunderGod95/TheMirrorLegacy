# Chapter 941: Huiyao Paying Respect

As Li Chenghuai let his mind wander, Li Zhouluo stepped forward, cupped his fist in salute and began introducing the siblings. The eldest among them, Li Zhoufang and Li Zhouyang of the first lineage, were timid and hesitant to speak, so the fourth young master took it upon himself to speak on their behalf.

Next was Li Zhouken of the second lineage. The current generation of the second lineage lacked innate ability. Though born of the first lineage, he had been adopted into the second, and was in fact the blood brother of Li Zhoufang and the others. He bowed respectfully when he was called upon.

The remaining children were all quite young, barely out of infancy, so it was hard to judge anything. After greeting each in turn, Li Chengliao turned to inspect the outstanding disciples of the sixteen prefectures. There were more than thirty in total. Naturally, the standards for selection were a notch below those for his own kin. As he surveyed them, none seemed foolish, but most were lacking in cultivation.

Seven from the An Family, two from the Chen Family, three from Western Pool, ten from the prominent families, and ten from the commoner clans...

Li Chengliao had a clear sense of things. The prominent families of Lijing, such as Chen, Tian, Dou, and Xu, were facing circumstances not unlike those of the Li Family’s main lineage. All suffered from dwindling legitimate descendants, so their numbers were understandably low.

In contrast, the newly risen surnames and humble households from the western and eastern banks of the prefectural mountains were rapidly amassing strength and securing their footing. Li Chengliao studied this night after night sitting atop the island with his red brush in hand. There were few who could claim deeper insight than him.

The era of intermarriage among the Chen, Dou, Tian, and Xu families of Lijing is coming to an end. Government appointments flow like water in the sixteen prefectures. The mortal and immortal realms grow ever more distant. There are prominent families with names but no land. Their rise and fall is a matter of a single generation, thought Li Chengliao.

He nodded as the youth below reported the customs of Wutu Prefecture, smiling in response, though his thoughts were elsewhere. The current peace and stability across the sixteen prefectures was not truly his achievement. He knew full well he had simply inherited a stable, finely-tuned Li Family ripe for manipulation.

The system of rotating appointments and prefectural authority, the Jade Court, the Qingdu enforcers; these had all been carefully devised by Li Yuanping and Li Xijun. Even when the Li Family had only held a sliver of the eastern shore, they already had a vision in place. Over time, Li Xicheng and Li Xijun had systematically eliminated the local powers in the newly claimed territories, and now that framework spanned the entire expanse of the lake’s sixteen prefectures.

However...

He still remembered the sacrifices made by the four surnames alongside the Li Family in the north. The current decline of the prominent families was not unrelated to the deaths of their political leaders. In the past, rewards like spirit items and dharma artifacts had been part of the bond, but affection and familiarity mattered just as much.

Thus, Li Chengliao gave special attention to the descendants of the four surnames, distributed spirit items to the outstanding youths of the sixteen prefectures, and allocated cave dwellings on the island for them to settle and cultivate. The cultivators then took their leave.

By the time he had completed all the arrangements, more than half an hour had passed. When he turned to check on his own family’s children, he found them all still standing silently to the side. They had been waiting all this time without a word.

Li Chengliao set down his brush and smiled. "Zhouluo, bring your brothers up here."

Li Zhouluo responded respectfully. As he and the others approached the front of the hall, they noticed a sudden warmth in Li Chengliao’s expression.

He quickly rose to his feet, vacating the seat of honor, and greeted solemnly, "Greetings, my lady!"

Li Zhouluo turned to look and saw a woman already standing in the hall. She wore a long feathered robe and silver boots. Her black hair was coiled up and pinned back with a white flower. She held a silver-white spear as she stood quietly.

A violet haze shimmered in her almond-shaped eyes. Though lightning did not manifest over her body, just her presence alone made Li Zhouluo afraid to look directly at her. He of course knew exactly who she was.

"Ancestor Qinghong!"

Li Qinghong gave him a slight nod and asked, "How long has it been?"

"My lady, it's been one year and six months," Li Chengliao responded on his behalf.

Li Qinghong hadn’t spent all her time in seclusion over the past year or so; she often went out to the sea to collect lightning. Now, her control over the Sixfold Profound Thunder Punishment Tokens had grown increasingly refined. She could store lightning within them at will and even enhance their power.

The white flower hairpin she wore was also found in the Eastern Sea. Though it was only of Qi Cultivation Realm, it was a rare Celestial Thunder dharma artifact capable of storing a small amount of lightning. It was better than nothing.

"The appointed time with Xi Zikang is drawing near. I came back to take a look," said Li Qinghong.

Since she was standing, no one dared to sit. They followed Li Qinghong down the steps of the hall. She glanced at the scenery across the island and quietly praised Li Chengliao.

Li Chengliao respectfully said, "Senior Kong Tingyun from Profound Peak Gate paid a visit a year ago. Upon hearing that you were in seclusion, she did not disturb you but left a message with me. She hopes you would write to her upon emerging, so that she may come to visit."

"I’ll go to Profound Peak and see her instead," Li Qinghong responded softly, without any noticeable change in expression.

Li Chengliao had managed household affairs well. At the very least, the island already bore the marks of an immortal family. As she took in the scenery, evening descended, and sure enough, silver-white lightning bolts began to strike the island.

Xi Zikang held a jade slip in his hand, his silver robe gleaming. He cupped his fists and greeted her with a smile, "Fellow Daoist Qinghong, long time no see!"

Li Qinghong nodded gently and exchanged a few polite words with him. Xi Zikang didn’t waste time and handed over the cultivation technique in his hand, speaking aloud, "Have a look, Fellow Daoist. This is the Bright and Clear Heart!"

Li Qinghong swept her spiritual sense through it. As Xi Zikang had claimed, the technique wasn’t particularly valuable. It was merely a second-grade technique called the Clarity of Sight and Heart Technique.

She only inspected it briefly before raising her head with a look of doubt. Xi Zikang, of course, understood the value was insufficient and immediately said, "I know this isn’t quite enough, but I have something else to make up the difference. Perhaps it will balance the value."

He pulled out a jade box from within his sleeve and said softly, "This is an escape spell of Bright Yang Dao, a third-grade technique called Flowing Sun Refraction. Together with the previous one, the value should match that of the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling."

Li Qinghong hesitated slightly. Escape spells were rare in Jiangnan. As for the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling, she didn’t fully understand its value. From the Li Family’s perspective, the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique was just an ordinary third-grade technique. It was certainly not worth a third-grade escape spell.

If she were to think maliciously, he might be trying to obtain the technique to counter her. But Li Qinghong had long switched to cultivating the Cloud-Thunder Inquiry Technique. While her Immortal Foundation remained the same, many of her internal pathways were now entirely different.

After much thought, she decided caution was still best and spoke gently, "The Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique is, after all, my own method and contains many secrets. If you’re willing, let’s exchange the jade slips first. After we return from the Eastern Sea, we can trade the unlocking incantations."

She looked carefully at the young man’s expression and saw clarity in his eyes. He answered without hesitation, "Deal!"

He readily agreed, showing the decisiveness typical of thunder cultivators from the Northern Sea. After a few more words, he took his leave without a hint of reluctance, riding the wind as he departed.

Li Qinghong watched him go and said softly, "While we’re away, be extra cautious in your actions."

Li Chengliao bowed his head in acknowledgment, while Li Qinghong thought to herself, Minghuang should be nearing a breakthrough. I’ll make a trip to Profound Peak Gate and then swing by the Eastern Sea. I’ll borrow some spirit gauze from Hengzhu Dao Gate and bring him back first.

No matter how much trouble it caused, Li Qinghong didn’t mind. If possible, she was even considering asking Kong Tingyun to come along, just in case something went wrong along the way.

Zongquan Island.

In the Eastern Sea, where waters fall and thunder rises, the skies were perpetually overcast. Rarely did the thunderclouds part, but today, radiant light poured down, gleaming brightly across the towers and halls of the island.

Whenever a heavenly breach occurred in the Northern Sea, the waters of the Eastern Sea would fall, expanding Zongquan Island by fifty kilometers. Its territory would suddenly grow, revealing numerous spirit ores. The island’s income would improve dramatically, and show signs of burgeoning wealth.

However, on a barren mountain within the island stood a small courtyard, with no guards or servants. There was only a lone monk washing clothes in the courtyard. Halfway through, he looked up at the sky and muttered, "Two years... how quickly it passed!"

Kongheng looked a little pale. He finished washing his robe, wrung out the water, gave it a good shake, and hung it to dry on the line. Outside the courtyard, seabirds chirped noisily, waiting for him to light a fire and cook.

But after changing into clean clothes, his senses stirred. He rose into the air and rode the wind straight into the clouds. Sure enough, the waters were roaring thunderously outside the protective formation. The jade-red sea surged with deep rumblings.

Woooo...

A faint conch horn echoed from afar, growing nearer. Fish and shrimp leaped across the sea under the brightening sky. Bluish-green backs breached the surface, and countless enormous beasts seemed to be stirring beneath the waves.

The sea looked as if it were boiling. One by one, demonic creatures rose from the depths and halted mid-air. Some held sabers, and the others held spears or halberds. The armored and robed creatures were lined up in symmetrical formations on either side of a path, glaring with bulging fish eyes.

"Hm?" Kongheng began softly reciting scripture as he calmly watched the sea. The ocean gradually parted, and a massive blue-scaled beast with a horse’s face and an oxen’s body rose from the depths.

Boom!

Water crashed down on either side like a waterfall as the beast stopped near the shore. Its body was as large as a small mountain and its eyes were the size of huts. It stared silently at Kongheng with dark blue-black pupils. The monk was no larger than a single scale.

Most of the island was cast into shadow by the sea beast’s form. The monk Kongheng fidgeted nervously with his prayer beads, raising his bronze monk staff, which clinked softly in his grip.

"Fellow Daoist..."

A dense swarm of shrimp and crabs prostrated themselves at the feet of the beast. Several water snakes stood upright like men, sounding conch shells with eerie rhythms. The cultivators on the shore were enveloped in the beast’s shadow, struck speechless by awe and dread.

Ding-dang...

At last, Kongheng lifted his brows and noticed bronze chains trailing from the beast’s body deep into the sea. A green-scaled fish leapt up from below.

The green fish rode the waves forward. It had a pair of scaled wings beneath its ribs and bulging eyes. When it reached the shore, it transformed into human form. It was dressed in a black-green robe, laughing heartily as it spoke, "Master Monk Kongheng! It’s been a long time!"

Kongheng’s calm expression finally cracked. He clutched his monk staff tightly, then exhaled deeply and shook his head as he replied, "You... you... Fellow Daoist Huiyao! Why all this pomp and spectacle!"

Huiyao chuckled sheepishly and said in a low voice, "Please don’t take offense, Master Monk... I was ordered to patrol the sea, so the grand display was somewhat unavoidable. I ask your pardon..."

Kongheng frowned slightly and asked, "May I ask what orders you are carrying out?"

The green-scaled fish, now in robes and appearing rather dignified, waved his hand with a grin and said, "To offer congratulations!"

Kongheng paused, lifted his head in thought, and saw the sky above clearing of clouds and fog. A great wind surged, heat rippled through the air, and heavenly light blazed with intensity.

The heir has broken through... thought Kongheng.

Huiyao’s fish-like face glistened with mucus as he laughed heartily and said, "This humble sea general offers congratulations to your esteemed family on behalf of the Dragon Son!"

Kongheng finally let out a breath of relief and nodded. Only a monk like him, with a calm temper, could settle the matter with a few chants. Had it been another Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, being startled like this would surely have earned Huiyao a few angry rebukes.

When Zhunan Serpent Dragon Palace had changed hands, Huiyao had gathered his own cultivators to help slay a demonic creature. Word had it that he had since fared well under the new lord. Kongheng assumed that thanks to that assistance, Huiyao had risen in rank, and now his presence at sea carried considerable weight.

The two waited for fifteen minutes. The plants on the ground began to wither slightly, and clouds of yellow mist swirled into the sky, each as large as a cartwheel. Kongheng narrowed his eyes and saw silhouettes moving in the clouds, with the faint cries of warhorses echoing within.

Huiyao stared fixedly at the sky. After a few more moments, the celestial phenomena vanished completely, and only then did he descend before the hall.

The monk stepped forward. Bright light burst from the windows and doors of the hall like a blade of white, illuminating both man and demon’s faces in dazzling radiance. He pushed the door open and stepped inside. Heavenly light flooded the hall, surging toward the upper seat. Huiyao followed closely and looked up.

A deep-golden halberd was planted upside-down in the center of the hall. Its shaft curved like a crescent moon, with a bright white arc etched at its center. A brilliant light flowed like water from it.

The demonic creature stared blankly as the scent of flowers brushed his nose. His gaze moved past the halberd and finally landed on a young man seated at the head of the hall.

The youth wore golden-white soft armor adorned with black profound patterns. His sleeves were tightly fastened, and he was half leaned against the chair’s back. He slowly raised his head and revealed a sharp jawline. His slightly narrow eyes were calmly open.

Huiyao had once seen Li Yuanjiao and felt this youth shared a resemblance, though he appeared more refined. But his eyebrows were longer, his eyes slightly wider, and he exuded an indescribable presence.

He does not look like a man, but rather like a dragon transformed into human form... That sly and cunning glint between his brows, it’s just like Li Yuanjiao, or perhaps even more intense... thought Huiyao.

Huiyao once knew nothing of the cunning and wickedness of humans until he met Li Yuanjiao. Only then did he understand that such traits were common in mankind. Yet, never since had he seen anyone like him—until now.

As these thoughts flickered through his mind, Li Zhouwei slowly raised his long brows. His dark golden eyes focused, and Huiyao felt a chill sweep through his body. His heart trembled slightly as he thought, He must have cultivated some kind of eye technique meant to intimidate... This must be the Li Family heir... The one the Dragon Son said was the least human. Yes, it must be him. And besides, there are no other Bright Yang cultivators present.

He felt the youth’s gaze shining like sunlight and stinging his face. He couldn’t help but lower his head. He copied human etiquette with a cupped-fist salute and said loudly, "Huiyao, patrol general of the Zhunan Serpent Dragon Palace, greets the heir!"

The youth at the top seat rose to his feet. His black boots clicked against the floor with a few crisp echoes. His voice was clear and carried a hint of a smile as it echoed through the hall, "You are too courteous, Fellow Daoist!"

But Huiyao remained bowed, swinging his robe and stepping forward with one leg. Using the grand salutation of the dragon kin, he knelt down with a thud, bowed toward the east, pressing his forehead to the floor.

He then turned and bowed to the heir. His voice was respectful and slightly high-pitched as he said, "This humble demon, blessed by the dragon’s decree, bows again and again. I speak on behalf of the Resplendent Dragon King and the Crown Prince of the White Dragon Ancestry, the Dragon Son, Lord of the Scarlet Pristine Sea, commander of the Zhunan shrimp and crab regiments..."

His tone was exceedingly respectful and drawn out, his green-black robe sweeping the floor as he chanted, " To humbly invite the heir’s immortal presence to grace our Serpent Dragon Palace!"
