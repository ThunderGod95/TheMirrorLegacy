# Chapter 1005: Righteous Nature

The old man asked the question but did not look at him. He simply picked up the other cup of tea that had already been poured on the desk and gestured for Li Zhouluo to take it. 

"Sit and talk."

Li Zhouluo had been at a loss for words, and this gave him a welcome moment to breathe and think. He took the opportunity to rise, accept the tea, and sit down again beside the old man.

"I don't know either..." he sighed. "I went to Simin, and a great personage came to see me. He told me to call him... to call him Grand-uncle... His name is Yang Ruiyi."

Li Xuanxuan's expression tightened slightly. He calculated inwardly:

'Yang Ruiyi... Rui-generation... That would make him a brother-generation to Yang Xiao'er.'

His expression cleared into one of understanding. He nodded with a smile and asked, "What level of high-level cultivator is he? How have I never met him?"

Li Zhouluo looked hesitant. "This junior can't be certain... His profound quality has a hint of Father's 'Untraceable Presence'. He just stands there, without the slightest aura, like a mortal..."

Li Xuanxuan sighed internally as he listened to him continue.

"He told me a few things and pointed out the situation in the north to me... The territory in the Wilderness. If our family still wants it, we should occupy it as soon as possible. After all, Profound Peak is watching from the side..."

"If our family doesn't occupy it, someone else will come to guard it."

Li Xuanxuan set down his cup, his expression turning serious. "The Yang Clan wants to take charge of Yue State's affairs. How will the various sects and gates be handled?"

Li Zhouluo shook his head. "You would probably have to ask Jiangliang about that. He is highly regarded by that great personage and is very clear on these matters. I was able to claim some kinship, but I don't count as one of his court."

"I only heard one thing..."

Li Xuanxuan raised an eyebrow, listening as the junior continued, "Some days ago, that grand-uncle of mine visited both the Snow Wings Gate and the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate. He even went more than once to arrange many affairs. At the very least, those two gates... should be fine."

The old man said with surprise, "The Snow Wings Gate has sealed its mountain for many years. They actually have a connection to the Yang Clan?"

Li Zhouluo's face was grave. "This junior does not know for certain. But I heard that a former master of the Snow Wings Gate was called Daoist Master Guan Xu, and it seems... he was very close to the Yang Clan."

"Oh?"

Li Xuanxuan mulled this over for a moment before raising his head, asking with some hesitation, "Yuanqin... how is he? Is there any chance he will return?"

Li Zhouluo had clearly inquired about this beforehand and had his answer ready. He replied naturally, "All those cultivators from Azure Pondâ€”not a single name on the roster or a single soul lamp was spared. Si Tongyi handed every last one of them over to be recorded by the Bureau of Immortal Rites. That elder is among them, but he has not yet come out of seclusion. He is still locked away on Azure Pond Mountain."

Li Xuanxuan had expected this. He raised an eyebrow. "Do you know what arrangements Li Quantao has... in Simin?"

Li Zhouluo paused, clearly surprised by the abrupt change in topic. He quickly answered, "I have seen him! Perhaps because both the Sima Family and Jiangliang recommended him, he is also highly regarded. He had a personal audience with the great personage, and I heard they spoke privately in the great hall for a long time. The territory he received is said to be one of the very best!"

Li Xuanxuan sighed inwardly and asked no more on that subject. Instead, he inquired about Zhouluo's cultivation and daily life. After they had chatted for some time, he finally sighed again.

"You... since you have this kinship, and the Yang Clan has sought you out... what are your arrangements now?"

This question made Li Zhouluo stand up in a hurry. He lowered his voice.

"This junior has no divided loyalties... It's just... I heard from that grand-uncle that a certain great personage wishes to protect this branch of the family that married into the Yang Clan... That's why I was granted territory in Simin. I have no desire to stay long with the Yang Clan, which is why I hurried back."

A trace of melancholy crossed his features. "The Lake is my lineage. The Yang Clan, no matter what, is only my grandmother's clan. I feel an an affinity for them, but it's hard to give them my heart. We are different, after all. What sense is there in taking up residence in Simin!"

Li Xuanxuan hesitated for a moment, then nodded.

"Sometimes, these things are not up to us. For now, cultivate here at the Lake and wait to see how things change."

Li Zhouluo nodded grimly. He gave a slight bow and was preparing to leave the pavilion when Li Xuanxuan suddenly asked:

"Linhai Prefecture... was it a breakthrough or a death?"

"Reporting to the elder, it was a breakthrough... Lingu Lanying!"

The junior replied, carefully closed the door, and silently withdrew.

Only then did motes of Heavenly Light descend, coalescing on the seat opposite. A man in white-gold Daoist robes materialized, having clearly been sitting there for a long time. Beside him stood another man in black-gold robes. They were, in fact, the two Daoist Masters of the Lake.

"Ming'er..."

Li Xuanxuan rose as Li Ximing spoke, his voice thoughtful. "Being granted territory in Simin... The Yang Clan intends to keep him there to be ordered around."

"Indeed..." The old man frowned, looking deeply troubled. "It's not just Zhouluo. Quantao has also been given an important position... And although Yuanqin is well-hidden and hasn't emerged from seclusion, he will likely be unable to avoid it in the future. The people from the south are watching very closely."

Li Zhouwei paced the hall, his own thoughts troubled. He raised an eyebrow.

"Lingu Lanying... So the old sword immortal foresaw this! The Lin Clan won't be needing anyone else to worry about them."

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully. The hall fell silent for a moment. Then, Li Zhouwei looked up and said in a low voice, "The Sparrow Carp Fish truly was ordered to go south..."

The other two looked at him. The gold-eyed youth's expression was shadowed.

"Even if he is one of the Three Dao Armors, a reincarnation of True Monarch Tianwu's Metallic Essence, he probably doesn't have the right to ascend to Fruition Attainment step-by-step through cultivation alone. Since everyone under heaven wishes to hasten this matter, it's only natural that everyone would want to help him."

"The divine mystery is bright within, a fierce might overflows without. Righteous nature halts depravity, benevolent authority is boundless. Slaying demons and fiends, upholding martial arts to preserve truth..."

Li Zhouwei raised his brow.

"Righteous nature halts depravity. If the Way of Great Desire doesn't come south, what depravity is there to halt? This matter doesn't require the Underworld or the great Yang personage to manage it at all. The north will naturally give him the opportunity to 'halt depravity'!"

...

### Quanwu Mountain

Quanwu Mountain was the northern barrier of Simin Prefecture, the number one prefecture in the heartland of Yue State. Although it was a mountain forest with no shortage of Demon beasts, it had always been the private garden of immortal cultivators. Fortunately, the Azure Pond Sect, which had exploited Quanwu Mountain most ruthlessly, had been in decline for decades, allowing the local Demon beasts to regain some vitality.

But now, this lush, jungle-covered mountain was shrouded in gray light, appearing dim and colorless. Karmic fires circled in the air, casting down countless streams of black light.

"Awoooo...!"

Howls of misery rose and fell throughout the mountains. The demon generals who usually eked out an existence here had clearly become fish on the Buddhist cultivators' chopping block. One after another, rays of brilliant light fell through the karmic fire, subjugating them one by one.

_Crack..._

The colors at the base of the mountain ridge dimmed. A giant crow was shrinking within a halo of light, tucking in its wings and transforming into a dark-faced man. He looked terrified, calling out in a low voice, "Daoist Yuan? Daoist Yuan!"

An old man scrambled over, his dharma power turbid. He was merely an impure cultivator, ancient beyond belief, and his eyes were frantic with anxiety.

"This... the heavens have changed!"

The Demon beast's expression twisted. He gritted his teeth. "Yuan Huzhong, aren't you from some Yuan family? How could you have no news of such a massive event! How do we escape now!"

"What Yuan family... Hah!"

At the mention of the Yuan family, the old man, Yuan Huzhong, raised his eyebrows but didn't dare say more. He looked down at the many points of light in the mountain ridges below, terrified.

"It's the Buddhist cultivators... They're attacking! There are at least twenty thousand of them in the forest! There's no hiding!"

"Save yourself!" the Demon beast cursed, but he didn't dare ride the wind and fly. He spat viciously, "At least you're not a Demon beast. You won't attract much attention. Take the mountain paths out of here; you have a good chance of survival!"

But the old man shook his head.

Yuan Huzhong had been passing through this place in his youth when he saved the common people from a Demon beast. He had stayed to protect them ever since, guarding them for over one hundred and thirty years without wavering. Now, his lifespan was nearly spent. What desire did he have to cling to life? Even as his lips trembled with fear, he whispered,

"They are Buddhist cultivators, not demonic cultivators. I will stay and try to reason with them, ask them... Perhaps there will be a good outcome..."

Before his voice had faded, a sound came from the mountains. Someone was stumbling through the woods. It frightened Yuan Huzhong so much he spun around, only to see children walking out from all over the forest.

"You... you..."

Yuan Huzhong had poured his life's blood into these common people. He naturally recognized these children from the village below. He knew every one of them; he could even name their parents. He became instantly tense, hurrying forward and hissing, "I told you to lock your doors and not come out! What are you doing up the mountain? Hurry back, now!"

The children were only three to five years old, walking with difficulty through the pitch-black forest. Their faces were different, but they all wore the exact same, vacant, blissful smile. They trudged numbly up the mountain, gradually passing the man and the demon.

Yuan Huzhong was stunned, at a loss. He instinctively grabbed two of them, but he couldn't stop the tide. More and more children were walking up the mountain. Cold sweat beaded on his brow. Then, he heard a _thud_ from behind.

The Demon beast, Daoist Wu, had already fallen to his knees, prostrating respectfully, not daring to move.

Yuan Huzhong looked in the direction the demon was bowing. Only then did he realize that, at some unknown time, a monk had appeared in the forest. He was tall, with extremely narrow, pale red eyes. A green silk sash was tied at his waist, glowing faintly.

The monk stood silently in the shadows of the woods, staring straight at him.

_Thud!_

Yuan Huzhong had never been a brave man. A chill shot through his body, and his legs gave out. He immediately fell to his knees, stammering, "My... my lord!"

The monk took a step forward, watching him quietly. The sound of his cloth shoes snapping twigs echoed in the forest. Yuan Huzhong trembled.

"My lord... they are just children... please, show mercy..."

"It is precisely because they are children that this is good..."

The monk smiled, stopping on the mountainside. His voice was faint.

"The world is full of stubborn ignorance. They eat flesh and sleep in skins, ignorant of the fundamental law, cultivating sin as their social order... People are born without sin. But once they enter the social order, once they tread the Red Dust, the masters oppress others, and the slaves become their accomplices. Even the most persecuted tenant farmer has a wife and child to oppress when he returns home. This is the degenerate root of your mortal world."

"Common people must endure all kinds of suffering to wash away their sins before they have the karmic reward to enter the Mountains of Desire. These children are ignorant. They have not yet fallen into the worldly bonds. They have no sin on them. By going up the mountain, they will enter the fundamental law. Beneath the Golden Lotus, all people are equal, studying the Classics, in bliss and without suffering... Is that not better than staying in this mountain?"

He raised his hand and pointed at Yuan Huzhong, smiling. "Let them go up the mountain. This is their blessing, and it is also your merit."

Yuan Huzhong was sweating profusely. He vaguely understood that the monk wanted to take these children into the Buddhist Land. He whispered, "I'm afraid... I'm afraid they must choose for themselves..."

The monk's expression gradually cooled. "This is the kind, Compassionate way... Since a child is born without sin, why let them enter the Red Dust to create bad karma, to be blinded by the social order, only to wait for karmic destiny to awaken and atone? That would be _our_ sin, the sin of us cultivators! Is it not better to directly enter the Buddhist Land my teachings offer on earth?"

Yuan Huzhong watched his lips move, and his own pupils began to fog with confusion. But the monk smiled. "You say you want them to choose for themselves... but in reality... does your social order give them any room to choose? Yet you see nothing wrong with it. It is clear the poison of this world's order runs so deep that people can no longer tell the difference!"

"Since you want them to choose, I will give you a chance. The common people below are entangled in sin and still have a lifetime of suffering to endure. I cannot interfere. I will only let them go. You will bring these children up the mountain with you."

He smiled. "If, after seeing my Buddhist Land on earth, you still feel it is wrong, I will let you all leave!"

He raised his hand, and a speck of golden light shook from his sleeve. The small mountain beneath his feet suddenly swelled. The peak erupted in ten thousand rays of light, and countless golden flowers bloomed. A thousand silvery streams of water fell from the sky, flowing down the mountain ranges as wondrous music began to play.

"You are a truly good man. I used my spell arts to observe the four borders, and there is no one more suited to the path of my Buddhist Land on earth. One hundred and thirty years of merit, born from your true heart, one hundred and thirty years of service... You formed a karmic bond with my Dao long ago!"

Yuan Huzhong's gaze toward the surrounding children was still gentle and kind, but his face now held a look of sudden, profound realization. He murmured, "I understand..."

And so, amid the brilliant light, a massive, mountain-sized golden body emerged from the blazing fire, guiding him upward, submerging him in a dense golden radiance.

The Sparrow Carp Fish stood on the ground, smiling. The six-armed, four-legged golden body descended from the sky, shrinking to the size of a normal person beside him. It was Nuzi Maha, his expression deeply respectful.

"Congratulations, my lord!"

The Sparrow Carp Fish nodded with a smile, listening to Nuzi's envious tone.

"Is he a descendant of the Dams-Goat Temple Palace?"

"Correct!" The Sparrow Carp Fish's eyes narrowed slightly, a look of triumph on his face. "Although his cultivation is not high, he is considered part of the direct lineage. What's rare is his outstanding merit. He is an excellent fit for my Dao!"

Nuzi sighed endlessly.

"The orthodox heir of [The Buddhists' Celestial Participant of the Dams]... a status that would grant a seat on Mount Dayang... and he possesses such great merit. He must be a formidable figure. My lord's karmic fortune and methods... we cannot even begin to fathom them! We can only admire and revere!"

"[The Buddhists' Celestial Participant of the Dams]... Truly a great power."

A trace of emotion flickered in the Sparrow Carp Fish's eyes. He heard Nuzi shake his head and say, "He was, after all, the master of [Celestial Enlightenment Su Xikong]. It is precisely because of him... that [Celestial Enlightenment] had the possibility of attaining his position. And he was a Dao Embryo disciple... His karma... only someone of your lord's status, combined with the current situation, could possibly dare to touch it..."

The greatest hidden objective of this trip was now in his grasp. The Sparrow Carp Fish clasped his hands behind his back, looking completely satisfied. "Tell me," he said lightly, "is his karmic affinity better... or is Vast Cicada's?"

Nuzi only offered flattery. "My lord, Vast Cicada is merely of the Wei-Li bloodline. He only seized an early advantage in cultivation and achieved his Dao a bit sooner. Give it time, and he will inevitably be crushed under this one's foot..."

The monk laughed at this. He raised his chin slightly.

"Let's go. Time to experience the power of the great Yang personage."
