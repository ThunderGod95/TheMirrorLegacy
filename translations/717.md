# Chapter 717: The Probe

With a single motion, Li Zhouwei ran his halberd through Wenhu’s trusted subordinate. He flexed his forearm, flipping the man over on the weapon’s shaft. Wenhu, his face pale and smeared with blood, continued to desperately conjure techniques, a bloody light surging around him as he prepared to fight to the death.

Li Zhouwei raised his other hand, and a brilliant radiance descended, enveloping Wenhu’s face and suppressing him. The Sun's Resonant Radiance Art was a fifth-grade art that excelled in subduing foes with its endless variations. Wenhu's Hurricane Ghost Yin foundation was not only weak to Bright Yang, but even more so to Supreme Yang. The instant the light struck him, his techniques scattered, and a wave of searing heat washed over his mind, nearly knocking him unconscious.

Yet Wenhu clenched his jaw, forcing his eyes open on a single held breath. Though the sun’s radiance had burned his eyes milky-white and scorched his face, he still reached for his storage pouch.

'Impressive. Truly impressive willpower.'

Li Zhouwei merely withdrew his halberd, then unleashed Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light from between his brows, severing both of Wenhu's arms. He bound the man in solar light, rendering him immobile.

Meanwhile, Ding Weizeng had already beaten the other two cultivators into a sorry state. His Immortal Foundation was incredibly potent, suffusing his body with a flowing red light and turning his pupils a brownish-yellow. The weaker of the two demonic cultivators was half-dead and out of the fight, leaving only the cave's second-in-command, Wang He, struggling to hold on.

After subduing Wenhu, Li Zhouwei’s gaze swept over the remaining fight, causing Wang He to break out in a cold sweat, his heart seized with fear. Just as he was about to speak, a white light flared on the horizon.

The light flickered once before appearing right in front of them, landing beside Wang He in a streak of light and revealing its true form.

"I am Song Yunbai of the Capital immortals Dao. Greetings, fellow Daoist."

A woman materialized, her hands forming a seal around a talisman. She had a slightly round face with sharp eyebrows and was dressed in a crisp white robe, her features typical of those from Jiangbei. Her sharp gaze fixed on Li Zhouwei and Ding Weizeng.

She clearly didn't recognize either of them. Her eyes swept over Ding Weizeng, pausing for only a moment before settling on Li Zhouwei.

Song Yunbai froze, a strange expression on her face. She took a half-step back, suddenly hesitant. Her bright gaze quickly shifted away, and her voice became somewhat muted.

"Dense Cloud Cave was brought to enlightenment by my Capital immortals Dao. For your clan to attack without cause… what is the meaning of this?"

Wang He and the other survivor retreated behind her. Li Zhouwei, halberd in hand, replied, "So, a friend from the Capital immortals Dao. This Wenhu from Dense Cloud Cave deceived a Daoist Master and offended the dignity of a Purple Mansion cultivator. I came specifically to apprehend him. Now that he is captured, I intend to take him away."

Song Yunbai's tone was polite, so Li Zhouwei saw no need to start with threats. He simply held his captive, creating a standoff. In the time it took for this brief exchange, thunder rumbled from behind them, and two figures arrived amidst flowing True Fire.

A radiant and graceful woman holding a lamp and a man with eyes like polished lacquer riding a bolt of lightning—it was the siblings, Li Minggong and Li Chenghui. Before they could even speak, two more streaks of light shot in from the north and south, stopping nearby.

The lights resolved into human forms. On the left stood a tall woman in a colorful dress, holding a jade-green ribbon. Her expression was one of fury. To the right was a man in a bamboo hat and brown clothes, a saber at his waist, carefully observing the scene.

"What is the meaning of this, Li clan!" the woman in the colorful dress demanded without preamble. She brandished her ribbon-like artifact, pointed at Wenhu, and raged, "This cultivator was personally guided by our Daoist Chidu! Your clan is a noble family of Jiangnan. Are you truly unaware that Dense Cloud Cave is a vassal of our Capital immortals Dao? We were already being exceedingly generous by allowing you to take the territory of Floating Cloud Cave! How dare you press your advantage and invade Dense Cloud Cave!"

"Ridiculous!" Li Chenghui wasn't about to let Li Zhouwei personally engage in a shouting match. He stepped forward and said coldly, "Since you are so aware that Dense Cloud Cave is your vassal, have you ever bothered to manage their actions? For ten years, Dense Cloud and Floating Cloud have harassed the northern shores of our Moongaze Lake. Did you ever say a single word then? You only show up now, conveniently late, and act as if you’ve been wronged?"

"You!" The woman’s fury rose, and she gave a cold, mocking laugh.

The man in the bamboo hat finally spoke, cupping his hands in a salute. "I am Gongsun Bofan of the Capital immortals Dao. Greetings to the three noble scions of the immortal clan. Now that the esteemed master of your clan has reached the Purple Mansion Realm, these past matters should be swept away. Even if you cannot let bygones be bygones, it should be a matter for Purple Mansion cultivators to discuss and resolve. There was no need to strike so suddenly and seize our interests."

He addressed all three of them, and Li Minggong replied, "Good. Since your sect is aware that our clan's master has ascended, do you know who you sent to congratulate him? And with what gifts? Given how Floating Cloud and Dense Cloud provoked us, do you think our master didn't give them a chance? Did your sect truly have no idea how this situation came to be?"

Li Minggong’s tone was not harsh, but her questions silenced Gongsun Bofan. It was not his place to answer such things, and he lowered his head in silence.

Watching the brief exchange, Li Zhouwei was already beginning to form a theory. No organization was a monolith, especially not the Capital immortals Dao, which had only been in Jiangbei for a little over a decade.

The first to arrive, Song Yunbai, was the lowest in status and weakest in power. She was only here first because she was the closest. She likely represented a local power, the White Ye Song family, holding a position in the Capital immortals Dao similar to Li Xizhi’s former role in the Azure Pond Sect. Naturally, she wouldn’t be hostile, preferring to remain detached, hence her polite words.

Gongsun Bofan was undoubtedly a guest retainer, much like An Siwei was to the Li clan. Though he defended the Capital immortals Dao, he held no real decision-making power, so he also tried to be diplomatic.

Only the furious woman in the colorful dress was likely a true core disciple of the Capital immortals Dao.

Just as he predicted, Gongsun Bofan fell silent, and the woman gritted her teeth. "If you want to condemn someone, you can always find a pretext. Just admit you covet the territory instead of hiding behind false accusations! We are in Jiangbei, you are in Jiangnan. We had no obligation to congratulate you, so why make such demands!"

Seeing her completely ignore Dense Cloud Cave's past transgressions and cling to any point that favored her, Li Chenghui's face hardened. He knew that the Chengyun Gate, another Jiangbei power, had sent their sect master to offer congratulations!

Having sorted out their identities, Li Zhouwei finally spoke. "There's no need for further talk. Dense Cloud Cave harassed my clan for ten years and nearly killed my direct kin on several occasions. This debt must be paid. My family has already taken Hongfu Mountain. You should all return to where you came from!"

Li Zhouwei had already sent Miaoshui to take Hongfu Mountain. With her access token, she would have entered the mountain by now. The woman in the colorful dress had anticipated his words and gave a cold sneer. "Do you really think you have us cornered?"

The moment she spoke, the tension snapped. Swords were drawn and bows were strung. Li Chenghui’s hand immediately went to his Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman. Gongsun Bofan also gripped the hilt of his saber, while Wang He and the others exchanged terrified glances, their faces slick with sweat.

In truth, Li Zhouwei was not afraid of them. Before Ding Weizeng arrived, he might have had to weigh his options, but now, with the brawny warrior and Li Chenghui by his side, they were more than a match for the three newcomers.

'I'm only worried about more Capital immortals Dao reinforcements…'

It was almost certain that in the Great Void, Purple Mansion cultivators were already facing off. If Li Zhouwei fought them now, a victory would be fine, but a loss would mean Li Ximing would also lose a step in his own confrontation, putting him at a disadvantage.

He weighed his options, holding his halberd ready. His eyes narrowed, his intentions unreadable, as he said coldly, "You are welcome to try!"

Just then, a loud laugh echoed from the horizon, and a voice called out, "Friend Minghuang, I've come to help you!"

All eyes turned to see a brownish-yellow spirit vessel made of profound stone speeding toward them, parting the air in its wake. Standing at the prow was a man in a patterned black robe. He was clean-shaven with a pale face and looked rather anxious. It was none other than Kong Guxi, the Sect Master of the Profound Peak Gate!

The face of the woman in the colorful dress changed instantly. Realization dawned, and she let out a laugh that was more rage than mirth. "I see now, I see! So you two families have colluded. No wonder you were so bold!"

Kong Guxi arrived in a flash. Four figures disembarked from the spirit vessel behind him—three men and a woman, two of whom were mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. The five of them stood with the Li clan, and the tables immediately turned.

Yet the woman in the colorful dress seemed utterly fearless. Her gaze shot past them to land squarely on Kong Guxi. "Kong Guxi!" she yelled. "How much of your master's lifespan is left? How dare you antagonize my Capital immortals Dao!"

Kong Guxi met her glare with a cold expression of his own.

Though he was all smiles with the Li clan, when the pale, beardless man turned grim, he possessed a chilling ferocity. "I've been sick of the sight of you for ages!" he cursed. "You cultivate some cursed, headless ghost Dao, and you strut around with more arrogance than a dragon princess!"

His words, so unlike him, came like a slap to the face. They stunned the woman into silence, her face flushing red. Just as she was about to retaliate, Gongsun Bofan grabbed her. "Watch out!" he shouted.

The woman instinctively turned her head and saw a brilliant light emanating from between the brows of the man with the halberd—a vast, majestic radiance of Bright Yang.

Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

Li Zhouwei had planned this all along, waiting for the exact moment her gaze was diverted. His ability erupted, smashing toward her. In that split second, a sharp clang rang out as a cold light flared to life.

Gongsun Bofan had drawn his saber, unleashing a wave of Geng Metal light to block the attack. In an instant, the tense silence was shattered by the roar of thunder, the surge of True Fire, the rise of earthen mountains, and the clash of Geng Metal.

***

In the Great Void.

Li Ximing stood with his hands behind his back, clad in a white and gold Daoist robe. A brilliant light shone from his brow, and the rainbow glow of his divine ability pulsed around him. Beside him, Changxi had channeled his own power to its peak, appearing as a middle-aged man with a white jade pendant on his chest.

Before them stood another man in a deep blue robe. He had a short, sharp-featured face that was rather handsome and spirited. He cradled a sword in his arms, his long hair tied back behind his head. He was seated on a crow-like beast covered in scales, its eyes like pools of ink. The Daoist watched them in cold silence.

"Daoist Yehui," Changxi said, his voice cold.

Yehui, caressing the slender, elegant ritual sword in his arms, finally spoke. "Zhaojing, what is the meaning of this?"

He seemed genuinely surprised, as if he had never expected the Li clan to erupt so suddenly, let alone take up the Profound Peak Gate's cause. He ran a hand along the blade. "I thought you were just placating the old man," he said softly. "Waiting for him to die so our two families could split the Profound Peak Gate's assets fifty-fifty. No grand campaigns, no confrontation between Purple Mansion cultivators. Wouldn't that have been better?"

The sword in his hands did not seem to be a weapon of the sword Dao, but rather a ritual instrument for casting spells. It pulsed with rings of spiritual light. Yehui smiled. "Then we could have negotiated our interests. The Profound Peak's territory would be up for grabs, its people would go to you, the mountain gate to me…"

"I never thought that while I held back, you would be the one to move on my things. Now it’s come to a confrontation between us, creating all this unpleasantness. What was the point?"

The smile faded from Yehui's voice. He sighed. "You truly want to make an enemy of me… A mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator in his prime versus a crumbling sect with no Purple Mansion master… Is the choice not obvious?"

He completely ignored Changxi, as if the man wasn't even there, speaking only to Li Ximing. Changxi’s expression darkened. "Yehui!" he growled.

Yehui glanced at him. "Do you wish to fight me to the death, old-timer? You're nothing but a divine ability. What good would sacrificing yourself do? You're already at death's door, yet you still insist on meddling and sowing discord."

Changxi fell silent.

Li Ximing finally spoke. "There is no need for such pretense, friend Yehui. Dense Cloud Cave has harmed my clan on numerous occasions, and Daoist Chidu has also acted without courtesy. If your sect had shown even an ounce of goodwill, we would not be at this point."

"Hahaha," Yehui laughed. "And what if we didn't? There is no friendship between Purple Mansion cultivators, no goodwill. If you fail to see that, Zhaojing, you will suffer for it sooner or later."

He seemed to have no desire to talk further. "Since Wenhu offended your family, you can have the rogue cultivator. I won't hold the losses in Dense Cloud Cave against you. Retreat to Floating Cloud's territory, and there is still room for negotiation between our families!"

"Retreat?" Li Ximing’s hand, hidden in his sleeve, tightened slightly. He didn't believe a single word of Yehui’s offer. Splitting the Profound Peak Gate, negotiating interests later—it all sounded tempting, but it was just his side of the story.

Besides, saving the Profound Peak Gate didn't mean he had to defend them on all fronts. Li Ximing had a favorable impression of the Xuanmiao Temple, and now he had even more leverage. Not to mention there was still Mount Jingyi across the sea.

He said coldly, "Since you were unwilling to offer congratulations for my ascension, I will take the territory of Dense Cloud Cave as my congratulatory gift!"

Yehui's brow furrowed. He stared at Li Ximing from across the Great Void, and ripples of spiritual light seemed to spread between them. The ritual sword in his hands began to tremble. Changxi stood firm, his stance making his intentions clear.

Li Ximing was not afraid of a fight. Not only did he have Changxi, who cared little for his own life, but the moment they clashed, the ones who would suffer most would be the Capital immortals Dao disciples on the ground. By the time their battle concluded days later, Li Zhouwei would have probably fought his way to the White Ye region.

"Fine, fine, fine," Yehui said, nodding. "You can have the territory. But remember this, Li Ximing: you did not win Dense Cloud Cave through some grand strategy. When that old man finally dies, I'd like to see how you handle the fallout!"

"You need not trouble yourself with my affairs!" Li Ximing replied with a smile.

Yehui sneered and turned, vanishing back into the Great Void. A single, cold parting shot remained.

"Old-timer, the Profound Peak Gate will inevitably be carved up by the other families. That day is not far off!"

Changxi remained silent. Li Ximing watched Yehui depart but offered no words of comfort. The old master had, after all, concealed the truth about Kong Haiying, and Li Ximing was still displeased with him. He was in no mood to offer consolation.

The two of them steered their divine abilities back toward the lake. Changxi finally sighed. "I have made a fool of myself in front of Zhaojing…"
