# Chapter 1099: The King Removes His Cloak

Raging black flames reflected in the sky and on the earth, but the first to hesitate was, unexpectedly, Touba Ci.

The sight of this shared aura, this identical Dao lineage, stunned Touba Ci where he stood. Even if he had heard rumors that Li Zhouwei knew this Profound Essence Art, how could he possibly believe the man possessed his own family's fundamental law?

The Dharma Body before him hadn't been refined with any heavenly materials or earthly treasures, but there was no mistaking its form. His mind went blank, and he was momentarily thrown into disarray.

'Is that... the Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body?'

But Touba Ci had no time for doubt. All the illusory black-gold light between heaven and earth converged, focusing on him. His opponent's Dharma Body surged forward, and flames of Profound Qi descended from the sky!

"Boom!"

The two colossal figures slammed into each other like collapsing mountains, igniting an inferno of limitless flames. Touba Ci felt his Dharma form shudder violently, and a dark anger rose in him.

'He's fighting so aggressively! What did the Song Emperor promise him?'

The Profound Qi was the Grand-Beginning Demonic Dao of the twelve Qis. Normally, its light manifested in all sorts of variations to overcome an enemy. But when both sides possessed Profound Qi Dharma Bodies, a direct clash like this would only burn away their respective Dao-Profundity!

He frantically tried to recall his treasured seal, only to find the Dharma Body before him scattering like the wind once more. The blood-red faded, replaced by a deep crimson. The thick darkness overhead reverted to roiling black clouds. What approached him was not his prized seal, but an expanse of brilliant white and a dazzling Heavenly Light:

Audience with the Celestial Gate!

Riding the wave of the Light of Karmic Dissolution and Pure Yin from the dissipating Crimson Severing Arrowhead, this divine ability had already reached the crown of Touba Ci's enormous demonic head!

Although Li Zhouwei had broken through Changxiao Gate and his Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body had greatly improved, there was still a definite gap between him and a great demon cultivator like Touba Ci, who had been nourished by countless treasures in a grotto-heaven since childhood. He naturally wouldn't compete in a head-on collision. The Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body had been nothing but a feint!

"Rumble!"

A cloud of bright white dust exploded across the sky. The violet-cyan radiance was instantly slammed into the ground, setting off a heaven-shaking, earth-shattering blast!

Audience with the Celestial Gate possessed the power to suppress and destroy demons. Amidst the violent tremors, the massive Demon, caught utterly off guard, immediately spat blood. It collapsed to the ground, immobilized, as roiling Profound Yellow Qi streamed from its body, flooding countless hills.

Tinglan couldn't help but shoot a glance sideways, just as a low voice sounded by her ear:

'Aid Zhaojing! Lock down Vast Cicada.'

Without a moment's hesitation, Tinglan reacted. Her hands formed a seal, and the silver mirror at her brow flew out once more. Sensing the celestial secrets, it unleashed a dazzling silver sea of lightning!

This Spiritual Artifact originated from an ancient lightning palace and possessed extraordinary power. Tinglan then waved her sleeve, flinging out two streams of blue-cyan Immeasurable Water and Fire that smashed into the divine abilities of the two Daoist Masters on either side of her. She vanished into the Great Void, stepping far away.

In that same instant, a dark black canopy unfurled across the sky, following just behind the sea of lightning, swallowing up Changyun and Gao Fangjing once again.

The surrounding landscape vanished instantly. A deep desert stretched out under wildly sweeping winds. That brilliant Celestial Gate already stood beneath the setting sun, pinning the cyan-grey Demon so firmly it still couldn't get up. The black-robed youth stood right in the center of the Celestial Gate, bathed in a radiance that pierced the heavens.

"Clang!"

The youth planted the halberd in his hand into the Demon's back, where its fumes of qi roiled. His golden eyes swept across the distance, and he let out a breath, as if he had just resolved a lingering worry.

The breath exhaled, and the youth's figure vanished.

Changyun, clad in a Daoist robe, felt a sudden chill rush into his mind. A thread of fear sprouted in his heart. He took a step back and raised his hand to form a seal, but his eyes already reflected a blinding golden light.

"Dong!"

The spirit bell protecting him was sent flying like a high-velocity arrow. Though his fingers were forming a seal before his chest, the crescent-shaped golden tip of the halberd had already, terrifyingly, appeared right between his fingers and his sternum.

"Puchi..."

Changyun felt an immense force strike him. The Dharma Art in his hands dissipated instantly as his body was flung high into the air. The golden halberd tip protruded from his back, its blade a full foot long.

Only at this moment did his spiritual sense finally register the man before him.

What black robe? Li Zhouwei was finally clad in armor and cloak. The black robe had transformed into a set of ferocious armor, etched with dark-gold profound patterns. On his vambraces, the emblems of pouncing qilin flickered. A light-purple feathered Campaign Cloak, billowing with streams of True Qi, floated around him.

Bright white markings climbed his neck like breathing veins, or perhaps like dense scales, reaching all the way to the corners of his eyes.

Sovereign's Perilous Tread.

'How can he be so fast? Even Sovereign's Perilous Tread... it shouldn't be like this!'

Changyun was no ordinary rogue cultivator. This was simply too hard to believe.

Li Zhouwei, however, was not the least bit surprised. At this very instant, he was stronger than he had ever been. Even the him from two breaths ago could not have dodged this strike.

The boon from the Primal Summit could resonate with the Crimson Severing Arrowhead; the Campaign Cloak of King Wei supplied him with True Qi; and Sovereign's Perilous Tread was empowered by the Crimson Severing Arrowhead's light. But most critically... with Tinglan's departure, the chaotic melee had finally become an organized siege. Sovereign's Perilous Tread at last sensed the White Qilin's fate. Its power surged, and a dark tide churned beneath his Dharma form.

Although he was only at the mid-Purple Mansion Realm, his opponents were far more numerous and powerful than those he had faced in the past. The boost he received from this three-on-one siege had already surpassed the one from fighting Shilou Yingge, reaching a full sixty percent.

And so, this Daoist Master, who acted as a petty king in Watersign Ridge and often ignored official summons, had no time to react at all. He hung as powerlessly from the Grand Ascension as a corpse skewered by cavalry in the thick of battle.

Changyun’s breath caught in his throat. He had time for only one reaction. His divine ability flared!

Golden Beast Plume!

Like an immortal undergoing Feather Transformation, a pair of wings unfurled from the Daoist's back. He fluttered upward, his eyes as bright as snow, his neck as long as a crane's. Transcending the mundane, he shed his Daoist robe, leaving it impaled on the halberd as the magnificent golden-feathered beast soared into the sky.

But Changyun felt no relief, only a creeping horror. Li Zhouwei's golden eyes were fixed on him, glowing in the darkness like two brilliant golden gems. The eclipse sign at the center of his brow was now complete.

The setting sun in the sky fractured again. This time, it didn't dissolve into a sky of black-gold light streams. Instead, it condensed into tangible pillars of black-gold light that rained down from the heavens, slamming into the beast's back and belly.

"Aooo..."

The golden beast let out a heaven-shocking shriek that could pierce metal and shatter stone. A Daoist umbrella materialized above it, but before it could open, a faint golden shadow followed.

The Pure Yang Bracelets.

"Dong!"

The umbrella was knocked staggering, just as expected, but it displayed outstanding quality, managing to halt the Pure Yang Bracelets and force them to return.

'But that's enough!'

The Emperor Qi's Light, condensing all the brilliance of heaven and earth, had already smashed onto the golden beast's back.

Li Zhouwei immediately retracted his gaze, his eyes narrowing slightly. He spun the golden halberd, its smooth surface reflecting another face rapidly closing in from behind:

Gao Fangjing!

The man was already upon him.

Li Zhouwei stood as immovable as a mountain. The roiling True Fire washed over him in an instant, but it only caused a flash of radiance to shimmer across his armor.

Primal Molt.

This divine marvel was born from the Qilin-Crow Spirit Slough within the armor. It was the most orthodox of Yang Cusp Arts. Empowered within the Crimson Severing Arrowhead, its power flared, causing his figure to vanish. He reappeared behind Gao Fangjing, raised an eyebrow, and brought the halberd down in a crushing blow.

'Insignificant tricks!'

"Boom!"

This Daoist Master of the Gao family had only recently broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Taking a direct hit from the Body Divine Ability that sensed fate, his own divine ability immediately collapsed. He was sent plummeting at a speed even faster than his approach, crashing violently to the ground.

"Clang!"

Only then did a waterfall of golden blood rain down from the sky. The golden beast finally let out a mournful cry and smashed heavily into the great desert. One gold, one fire, both hitting the ground at the same time.

"Hmph!"

The golden-eyed man turned his head in defiance and left, returning to his position atop the Celestial Gate. He stomped down.

The fiend, who had just managed to straighten up and push the Celestial Gate off him, immediately collapsed, falling flat on the ground once more with a world-shaking thud.

"Rumble!"

Touba Ci was again left humiliated in the dust.

Li Zhouwei felt the fiend's enraged shaking beneath his foot but didn't spare him a single glance. His gaze was fixed on the distance, his words as cold as ice.

"The Gleaming Gold Feather-Beast. It can fly up, but not down. Once it descends, it falls to earth, where it is often imprisoned and slain by the Baleful Earth."

Li Zhouwei had read about Changyun's Golden Beast Plume. Although it wasn't from Changyun's own Dao lineage, its flaws and weaknesses were identical. As long as this divine ability was knocked out of the sky in one go, its power would be drastically reduced for a long time, perhaps even becoming impossible to summon.

This was one of the reasons Li Zhouwei had targeted Changyun first.

Touba Ci was undoubtedly the strongest of the three. This Liang descendant, a king's nephew, was a ranked expert among mid-Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Although he had been a step behind from the start and repeatedly immobilized, his Great Pass Azure-Soul Dharma Body made him extremely difficult to injure.

As for Gao Fangjing—the man's surname was Gao, after all. Firstly, Li Zhouwei was showing him some face, afraid of actually killing him. Secondly... keeping him around to empower Sovereign's Perilous Tread was far more beneficial to the next phase of his plan. It was much more useful than heavily wounding him and chasing him off early.

That left only Changyun. Not only did the man lack any real fighting spirit, but while his spell arts were formidable, he couldn't withstand close-quarters combat.

'Moreover... both Touba Ci and Changyun are proud and arrogant. How can they not fly into a rage after being humiliated like this?'

As if to confirm his thoughts, an intense golden light, so bright it seemed to want to pierce the heavens, rose from the depths of the desert. Changyun's cold laugh, its sincerity impossible to gauge, echoed across the sky.

"I would very much like to ask the White Qilin for some pointers!"

The golden light flared. The Daoist-robed man was already soaring high, golden blood dripping from his mouth. The golden light at his brow transformed into a massive, sweeping pillar of light that came crashing down.

Li Zhouwei smiled.

"Good!"

He stood firm with his halberd, not retreating an inch. A brilliant radiance shot from his own brow, piercing heaven and earth.

Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

Golden light and Heavenly Light collided in the sky, scattering infinite multicolored halos across the dark canopy. Golden blood gushed from Changyun's mouth, but his expression was one of high spirits.

'The divine ability is strong, but its grade is too low!'

Sure enough, though the golden light stalled for a moment, it was steadily moving forward, its downward momentum growing faster and faster.

At the same time, bright flames erupted. As if infected by the combatants' fighting spirit, the True Fire no longer hesitated. It gushed from the desert depths, shooting upward to blast the golden-eyed man's chest.

As Purple Mansion Realm experts, who among them would not seize a combat opportunity?

The roiling demonic qi of the Dharma Body shattered, revealing Touba Ci's true form. The man propped up the Celestial Gate, his face pale. He coughed two drops of amber blood onto his sleeve. As the sunset's glow cast upon his face, his expression shifted, and a small smile touched his lips.

"Great Baleful Heavenly Radiance Secret Art!"

The Celestial Gate trembled as if a colossal force was rising from the earth, surging upward like ten thousand men joining forces to topple it.

Three pillars of light surged as one, shattering Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, and slammed into the black-armored man.

Li Zhouwei smiled. He grabbed a corner of his Campaign Cloak and held it in front of him.

"Boom!"

The great desert sky-domain finally shattered. The setting sun vanished, and the scenery of Baixiang Valley reappeared. The Crimson Severing Arrowhead was finally broken. The Great Song's King Wei fell from the sky, plummeting toward the earth.

The three men didn't hesitate for a second. They stepped forward together, each sealing off a direction. The Daoist held his profound umbrella, shining with golden light. The prince conjured a red feather, sensing the celestial phenomena. The imperial descendant devoured demonic qi, holding his halberd. Together, they activated their arts to seize the initiative, giving him no possible chance of escape.

But the man merely let the Campaign Cloak he had pulled before him fall open. On his travel-worn face, his golden eyes shone like stars. He smiled.

"Crimson Severing Arrowhead."

As if in answer to his call, the pitch-black canopy immediately enveloped the earth. The setting sun rose once more, and all the scenery fell back into the Yang Cusp. The three men's expressions changed. A flicker of doubt crossed Changyun's face.

'He released it himself!'

The Crimson Severing Arrowhead was formidable, but not to the point where it could be recast the instant it was broken. That left only one possibility: Li Zhouwei had done it on purpose.

Changyun's cautious nature magnified his suspicion. He looked down and realized that Li Zhouwei was not the only one standing beneath the setting sun—there were also five enormous, uniquely shaped golden bodies of Buddhist cultivators.

Five Merciful Ones.

This left Gao Fangjing bewildered. Touba Ci stood frozen on the spot, his battle intent evaporating into pure confusion and astonishment.

"Is he... is he suicidal?"

Li Zhouwei's Crimson Severing Arrowhead wasn't a grotto-heaven. While it was inconvenient for those trapped inside to traverse the Great Void, forcing them to calm down and break a part of the divine ability before escaping, it didn't completely sever the connection...

Five Merciful Ones in formation could easily neutralize most of Li Zhouwei's attacks. In front of all of them, Li Zhouwei was nothing but a fish on the chopping block!

But the golden-eyed man only pulled his halberd from the desert sands. His eyes flashed with an irrepressible, vicious pleasure. He laughed.

"Again!"

His laughter shattered the quiet. The five Merciful Ones snapped out of their daze, their faces twisting with greed. Sabers, swords, spears, and halberds—all descended at once.

"Clang!"

The Grand Ascension Halberd swept across the sky, parrying all five flashing golden artifacts. An endless storm exploded in the desert. Li Zhouwei held the halberd with both hands, his face turning only slightly pale.

The deliberate provocation, the designed fall into the valley, the maneuvering, the show of weakness—it was all for this very moment. In the next instant, his golden eyes turned a pure, endless, piercing white-gold.

Sovereign's Perilous Tread!

The White Qilin's fate-sense had reached ninety percent completion.

The danger of this situation was even greater than the day he faced Gongsun Bei. The connection to the White Qilin's fate surged to its absolute peak, even overflowing, pouring down in a glorious, exhilarating flood.

But what Li Zhouwei had to face in return was an overwhelming deluge of divine abilities from the Immortal, Demon, and Buddhist paths.

Under this torrent of arts, he didn't hesitate. He didn't summon a treasure or use an escape art. Instead, he made an extremely peculiar move.

He unfastened the Campaign Cloak from his body—the one adorned with light-purple feathers.

That was all.

Beneath his feet, the Audience with the Celestial Gate erupted, carrying with it infinite radiance and a sky full of golden armor and robes. The only response to the assembled cultivators was the Celestial Gate, standing tall in the air.

"Rumble!"

The Campaign Cloak, draped over the Celestial Gate, trembled violently under the barrage of divine abilities. It quickly dimmed and fell away. The bright Celestial Gate, which could suppress all things, began to tremble next. It seemed to melt within the terrifying pillars of light—where gold and fire clashed, where immortal and demon energies annihilated each other—but it held its ground, relying on the mutual cancellation of the enemy attacks and the protection of Li Zhouwei's own heavy Spiritual Artifacts and divine abilities.

But it could not last.

"Kacha..."

A crack finally appeared on the Celestial Gate, spreading down through the layers of Heavenly Light.

Li Zhouwei, however, was gone.

In an instant, the world dissolved. The sky of Baixiang Valley reappeared. The Audience with the Celestial Gate remained where it was, but the Great Song's King Wei—in his qilin-patterned black armor, his eyes a solid platinum—materialized at the very edge of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead's desert domain.

He lightly hefted the golden halberd, his arm stretching like an ape's. With a burst of strength from one hand, the Grand Ascension shot forward, whistling through the air like a sky-piercing dragon.

The colors of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead gushed forth again with barely a pause. This overloaded, unceasing opening and closing made the setting sun in the black sky flicker erratically. The divine ability itself was being damaged, but the roiling desert extended at an incredible speed. Not only had he escaped the encirclement, but the colors of this second extension gently enveloped a monk at the domain's other edge.

Vast Cicada.

The sheer breadth of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead was astounding. Even if its offensive power was concentrated at the center, any point within its reach could be used for teleportation. Two uses of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead's movement were more than enough for Li Zhouwei to land right in front of Vast Cicada.

His target—it had always been him.

His intentional provocation while trapped by Touba Ci's group was to ensure that when he dispelled the Crimson Severing Arrowhead to draw in the Merciful Ones, all three would follow him, not turn to attack someone else. Then, using their momentary surprise, when they weren't attacking with full force, he used the Audience with the Celestial Gate to take his place and bear the brunt of the assault.

All of this was to push the White Qilin's fate-sense to its absolute peak—to gain that ninety percent boon! This ninety percent boost was practically a second Body Divine Ability. Even after leaving the battle formation, its power would take time to fade, giving him ample time to strike.

He thought coldly, 'Guzhou Cauldron locks the Great Void. Precious Tusk is exiled. Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion seals the four directions and fixes the present world.'

The monk raised his head in disbelief. Above him, the Guzhou Cauldron had already locked down his divine arts one by one. To his side, the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion had sealed off his every escape route.

All that remained in his vision was the pitch-black sky, the prostrate setting sun, the roiling desert, and the dazzling, whistling halberd hurtling toward him like an enraged dragon. Behind it was a comet-like brilliance and a pair of piercing, platinum-white eyes.

In this moment of absolute crisis, Vast Cicada could only open his lips in a useless gesture.

The White Cicada in his mouth twitched. The gash from the halberd strike was still visible on its body. But no matter how he tried to sense it, he could no longer connect to the treasured land that had always watched over him.

The Exiled Qi was the Lord of Obscurity and Gloom.

If he had connected to Precious Tusk earlier, even if he was now suppressed by the Guzhou Cauldron and Precious Tusk itself was in danger of falling, he would at least have its blessing to protect his life. But the Guzhou Cauldron had appeared early, making no attempt at ambush, for the sole purpose of ensuring that from beginning to end, he could not receive a single drop of blessing from the Precious Tusk Golden Land.

Under such a crisis, Vast Cicada, who had run rampant across the north relying on the Precious Tusk Golden Land, was utterly helpless. He couldn't even rely on Precious Tusk to beg its Dharma Realm master for help.

Even his pagoda... was being suppressed by Li Ximing's Celestial Gate.

"Kacha."

The Grand Ascension had arrived.

The halberd was merely a spirit embryo, but empowered by Li Zhouwei's full strength, the resonance of Sovereign's Perilous Tread, and the White Qilin's fate, its power was already terrifying. Furthermore, Li Zhouwei had just 'escaped'—a perfect trigger for Sovereign's Perilous Tread.

The halberd seemed to have transformed into an indestructible Spiritual Treasure as it met the golden spear.

"Weng..."

The powerful Bright Yang divine ability instantly bent the Li Fire spear to its limit and violently flung it aside. The halberd pierced clean through the monk's chest, taking with it a spray of glazed, glass-like fragments. Vast Cicada's pupils dilated to their widest. His organs shattered. Cracks spiderwebbed across his brow.

A single strike. Suppressed by a top-tier contemporary Spiritual Treasure and a Spiritual Treasure of the Supreme Yang Dao lineage, Vast Cicada was already powerless.

Despair was still brewing in his eyes as the man in profound-patterned black armor, as ferocious as a qilin, descended from the desert sunset. The long halberd in his hand—the Radiant Sun King's Halberd—glowed with a thick light as it fell directly upon his smooth, shaved head.

Li Zhouwei's throwing of the Grand Ascension was not random. Regardless of whether it succeeded, the Grand Ascension's arrival served as a king's declaration of war, an edict to execute a rebel.

This follow-up strike, therefore, was no sneak attack. It was the Bright Yang Dao, openly and righteously declaring his crime before his execution.

Splitting Light!

Blinding splendor converged on Vast Cicada's head. His facial features dissolved into hollow voids, erupting with brilliant Heavenly Light. Jade and agate poured from his lips and teeth. His ten fingers, like icicles in deep winter, broke off one by one, transforming into brown-yellow bamboo tubes, the classics within them rustling audibly.

The monk seemed to be roaring, but not a single sound escaped his mouth. In this bright, infinitely murderous moment of his demise, Vast Cicada's final wisp of thought was not regret, nor resentment, but sudden, piercing comprehension.

'The King removes his cloak; the cicada sheds its husk. The Great Fissure is at the pass, the Yang Cusp is in the thrust. The White Qilin... is demonstrating the Dao for me! The White Qilin is demonstrating the Dao for me!'

He was right. Of all of them, only Vast Cicada, who also cultivated the Bright Yang Dao and possessed profound Dao-Profundity, could see Li Zhouwei's actions most clearly. Only he understood how exquisite it all was. The Campaign Cloak draped on the Audience with the Celestial Gate wasn't just a Spiritual Artifact used to block attacks and protect the gate. It _represented_ the thrust of the Yang Cusp. It _was_ the husk that the White Cicada shed.

This final halberd strike was the most perfect articulation of Li Zhouwei's Dao-Profundity and his connection to his life-mandate.

'So... so this is how the Crimson Severing Arrowhead is cultivated... I understand... Master... I can pass the Purple Mystery... I understand! Master...'

'I don't need to cultivate Buddhism... Master!'

But his last, whimpering thought went unanswered. The overwhelming tide of jade and glaze began to disintegrate. The leaping qilin pattern on the Radiant Sun King's Halberd blazed to an impossible brightness. Heaven and earth fell into absolute silence.

In that instant, even the pink illusory colors weaving through the mountains and the endlessly circulating Jade True light seemed to freeze. Everything stopped. The sky over Baixiang Valley was shrouded in black clouds, heavy with what felt like divine wrath.

The clouds roiled endlessly, an unprecedented, unseen phenomenon. They were like a thick cushion, or perhaps the fluttering hem of a celestial robe, layered and infinitely oppressive.

Yet, from a crack in these impenetrably thick clouds, a sliver of Buddhist light suddenly shot down. As if in anger, as if in warning, it pierced the gloom, passed through the Exiled Qi, and illuminated half of the Great Song King Wei's face.

The four realms trembled.

The man's golden eyes, half in light and half in shadow, gazed at the sky. Behind him, the infinite glaze of the fire prison shattered. A sarcastic smile touched King Wei's lips.

'My lord, a move once played cannot be regretted.'

The King unfastens his cloak; the cicada sheds its husk.

To step from the capital into the domain is to kill.
