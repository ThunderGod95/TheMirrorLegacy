# Chapter 1000: Karmic Fire

'...'

Taixi knew Li Ximing had consumed many treasures from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. He also knew Li Zhouwei had reaped a fortune in the grotto-heaven. That explained his mild jealousy when the Spiritual Treasure appeared. But three Spiritual Fires? He had never imagined such a thing.

'This is just too extravagant!'

Jealousy and hatred warred in his heart, but seeing the three Spiritual Fires merging so harmoniously, their aura terrifyingly potent, his vigilance spiked. His posturing vanished. He activated his Golden Body, and the overbearing, radiant power of his Buddhist Land divine ability immediately contracted, flowing back into his Dharma Body. He took a single step back, eyes flashing, and summoned a bowl from the Great Void.

The bowl was deep purple, rimmed in metallic black. Its opening was a pitch-dark void, utterly devoid of light, like an endless abyss. This was the infamous Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl!

While Taixi's seniority in the Way of Emptiness wasn't deep, he had spent many years refining this one exceptional treasure. He had begun the process long before joining the Buddhists, and its greatest strength was suppressing and absorbing elements like water and fire.

But just then, the brilliant light of the three merged Spiritual Fires suddenly split. The Li Fire leaped out, detonating prematurely before the Treasured Artifact. It erupted into a storm of raging, apricot-red flames that surged directly into the bowl.

It was the Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame.

Among all types of Li Fire, the Red Pheasant is the most sentient. The Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame possesses the power to disrupt and pacify profound energies. This Li Fire took the vanguard, surging forth and coiling around the bowl, managing to pin down the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl for a crucial moment. In that instant, the other two Spiritual Fires crisscrossed and shot past it, speeding toward Taixi!

'This...'

Taixi was already channeling his divine art when he saw this. His face darkened, and he stared, stunned in disbelief.

'‘It... it just split apart? Just like that?’'

Li Ximing's counter to the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl looked effortless, but Taixi himself was a student of fire arts! The principles involved were terrifyingly profound.

'‘To effortlessly merge Spiritual Fires into one, then just as easily split them apart and control them individually with no interference... this is absurd...’'

He had to understand, Li Ximing was simultaneously controlling True Fire, Li Fire, and Merging Fire!

These were three distinct Spiritual Fires, each one more tyrannical and fierce than the last! Harmony between different Spiritual Fires was practically unheard of. A Daoist Master's spiritual sense was finite, limiting the number of Spiritual Artifacts or Spiritual Fires they could control. How could anyone withstand such internal conflict? Even a Daoist Master cultivating the path of Fire Virtue could, at best, handle two or three Spiritual Fires from the same Dao Lineage in actual combat!

Taixi understood this difficulty perfectly. When he was refining the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl, he had no Spiritual Fire. He had to spend five full years blending True Conjoined Triple Fire within the bowl just to produce a single wisp of flame. It was so pathetic that, despite his thick skin, he had been too embarrassed to give it a name, simply calling it 'karmic fire.'

'‘Li Ximing isn't even a Fire Virtue cultivator! At best, his Li Fire has some affinity with Bright Yang. Three Purple Mansion Realm-level flames from different Dao Lineages, merging and splitting at will... how is that possible? Even Gao Fu could hardly do better!’'

But now, his Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl—which was meant to counter fire arts—was itself being countered. He had no choice but to shoot blinding, resplendent light from his eyes. A stream of white light instantly leaped forward to meet it. It was Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!

Li Ximing's Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light was not on par with Li Zhouwei's, but he had still practiced it for decades. It formed a solid barrier against the resplendent light. In that same instant, the flickering Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire leaped out once more, a flash of bright golden-red that shattered the golden light emanating from the lotus seat beneath him.

Taixi pressed his palms together, urgently recalling his dharma artifact. But there was no response from the Great Void.

'‘What?’'

Li Ximing's gaze was glacial. The five layers of golden silk around the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument in his hand had vanished. Far in the distance, within the roaming Li-Light, the Profound Snare activated, locking tightly onto the Treasured Artifact. Taixi instantly lost contact with the treasure lamp he had kept hidden for protection!

The Maha's expression changed drastically as a searing white light filled his vision.

"Boom!"

A white light so bright it was agonizing—the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire—slammed down, exploding against Taixi's arm. A formless, pale-grey flame shot skyward, driving back the Li-Light, incinerating the iridescent clouds, and forcing all other light to recede.

"Rooar..."

The intense white light faded, revealing the Maha roaring in agony. The arm he had raised to block had turned a searing, incandescent white. The Merging Fire blazed, melting his golden skin to reveal a cross-section of flesh that looked like jade and polished glaze.

His Golden Body was splattered with innumerable sparks of the Merging Fire. These bright motes of flame danced like stars, clinging to him like a tenacious plague. They pulsed, spreading rings of grey fire that swirled around the bright contact points, and these points were steadily growing brighter!

Taixi was caught completely off guard and had suffered a grievous blow. The pain was excruciating. His gaze was a vortex of infinite hatred and terror, yet his lips twisted in a jealous sneer as he hissed:

'‘Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire!’'

The Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire was renowned among all Merging Fires. It was said to burn the life-mandate itself and reveal ultimate radiance. It possessed the aspect of "feeding on power" and the ability to smelt even metal. This wasn't just talk. Once it landed on a body, it would spawn this pale-grey 'Flame-Following Merging Fire'!

If this 'Flame-Following Merging Fire' was left unchecked, it would feed on the victim's dharma power and divine abilities. Once nourished, it would allow the root flames of the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire to spread further. It was an utterly vicious cycle. The fire should have been easy to recognize, but he had never dreamed Li Ximing would possess such a treasure!

'‘The Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire... how could it be the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire? That's something Li Ximing couldn't afford even if he sold himself!’'

The other two Spiritual Fires were gone; this was the power of the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire alone, yet it had still burned him severely. His pupils dilated from the agonizing pain until the glazed, jewel-like irises consumed his entire eyes. The lotus seat beneath his feet shot backward as waves of resplendent light surged up his body, desperately trying to suppress the injuries before the flames spread further.

'‘I’m here doing the Way of Great Desire's dirty work, and they just sit back and watch me get wounded... Outrageous!’'

The ponderous, furious intent in his heart spread outward, infusing his resplendent light. This wave of anger washed over the three Merciful Ones, who were intentionally holding back within the Li-Light. A chill shot through them, and they cursed their luck.

Nu Xiao, having no backing, felt it most bitterly and seethed:

'‘We’re being blocked by the Li-Light; it’s perfectly normal to take some time! It’s not like we’re slacking off... Li Ximing’s divine ability is Audience with the Celestial Gate. If he really has reinforcements, whoever charges in first will die fastest. Having an excuse to delay is the smart play! ...Who the hell could have predicted that you, a third-life Maha, would get wounded in just a few exchanges?!’'

Cursing inwardly, the three Merciful Ones, drenched in cold sweat, finally burst out of the Li-Light. Led by Nu Xiao, the strongest among them, they launched several beams of resplendent light. But the death throes of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition all those years ago had not been in vain. Taixi’s retinue of Merciful Ones had been decimated. The three remaining today were mediocre at best. Forget attaining the Golden Lotus Seat; even Nu Xiao, the strongest, was only at the Developing Wisdom level.

Li Ximing's figure drifted up within the Li-Light. His Audience with the Celestial Gate, held in reserve until now, was waiting for this exact moment. He unleashed it without hesitation, suppressing Nu Xiao. The Spiritual Treasure floating between his brows flared, and the immense drain of power made his face go white.

Swarm of Light!

The Spiritual Treasure’s power to suppress different Dao paths activated. The other two Merciful Ones, who had split wide to avoid being caught by a single divine ability, froze in mid-air. Li Ximing's fourth divine art, Double Radiance, flared. A red light swept out, resonating with the Li-Light. In coordination with the Swarm of Light, it locked both of them in place.

'‘A Spiritual Treasure is a Spiritual Treasure, after all!’'

The two Merciful Ones were completely pinned, their hearts seizing.

Behind them, Taixi finally breathed a sigh of relief. He momentarily stabilized his Dharma Body, the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl hovering over him to absorb and suppress the rampant spiritual flames. With a vicious grunt, he finally tore an object free from the Li-Light.

It was the treasure lamp, which had been completely immobilized by the Profound Snare!

This treasure lamp, which he had only just acquired, had been pinned in the Li-Light by a single divine art for more than ten exchanges. If he hadn't personally freed it, Taixi suspected it might have remained trapped for the entire battle. The power of his opponent's Spiritual Treasure was one thing, but this lamp's performance left Taixi so disappointed he almost laughed in fury. Silently, he blew on the wick, and the lamp flared, casting its resplendent light.

This resplendent light, at least, was mystical and shockingly fast. Li Ximing was already overextended, channeling multiple divine arts to lock down several opponents. His dharma power and divine abilities were strained to the limit. The lamp's sudden pull nearly caused the spell arts in his hands to dissipate. He was a beat too slow. The Sun's Resonant Parting Light flaring around him failed to block the beam, and his defenses were instantly extinguished!

'‘A mistake...’'

Li Ximing felt his chest tighten as searing, fiery light bored into his heart. Fortunately, his reflexes were sharp. The Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron instantly appeared at his side. A rolling, blue-green light poured from it like water, absorbing the beams of resplendent light.

He coughed twice. His gaze dropped, and with the aid of the Immortal Artifact, he perceived another Golden Body still watching from the Great Void. He wasn't surprised in the slightest. Sneering inwardly, he gathered his focus. Under the protection of the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, he closed his eyes, and all the radiance from his body converged. The golden-red True Fire flashed beside him, then shot into his Sea of Qi.

Taixi had just formed another Dharma Art of resplendent light, but the Merging Fire coursing through him caused it to falter. Before he could recover, the wide-area Swarm of Light finally reached him. It descended along with a ripple of mountain-and-river patterns, striking his hands and shattering the Dharma Art completely.

He had no time for anger; a sudden, intense feeling of danger spiked in his heart. A talisman had appeared in mid-air. It was covered in complex, glowing sigils, its brilliant colors coalescing into a profound light that poured down!

The Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman!

Li Ximing was floating above the lake. His Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman had long since linked with Moongaze Lake. Thanks to the power of the Yue State's greatest lake, its might was nothing to scoff at. Because the connection was long-established, it activated instantly, striking Taixi across the distance. It exploded in a shower of shattered light, anchoring him to the physical world and preventing his escape.

'‘He has another killing move!’'

Taixi was a veteran; how could he not see his opponent's intent? But the treasured ring he had spent years refining had been lost at the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter while binding Li Zhouwei, only to be interrupted and lost due to Suiguan's sudden arrival. This new lamp was a poor substitute, and now it was even being suppressed by the enemy's Profound Cauldron. All he could do was glare, his divine abilities trembling, and roar in fury:

'‘Nuzi!’'

Li Ximing’s eyes snapped open again. His hands, which had been forming seals in front of him, pushed forward, revealing an object.

It was no larger than a thumb—a single point of iridescent gold, densely covered in runes. It spun and danced with fluid agility. The dim, heavy red light of its past was gone, replaced by a bright, soaring radiance.

Great Parting's Golden Radiance!

In the past five years, Li Ximing had cultivated diligently, condensing this spell art. He had already achieved the ninth strand of Red Radiance. Now, by recalling the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire, he had added the final, most difficult strand. Ten strands converged, transforming into the Golden Radiance!

The iridescent gold light blazed, and the Great Void resonated. The six-armed, four-legged Golden Body finally appeared. Maha Nuzi descended amid a swell of celestial music. A golden bell shield manifested, blocking the Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman for Taixi. Another of his hands projected a beam of light to defend as his majestic voice boomed:

"Benefactor... lay down your butcher's knife!"

But the instant his divine light descended, a purple-gold radiance erupted from the dim Li-Light. Thirty-two beams of spiritual light, long lying in wait, merged into one. They formed a massive pillar of light that slammed down onto Maha Nuzi.

The Buddhists had advanced deep over the lake, placing themselves squarely within the range of the Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array!

Nuzi froze, his face bathed in purple light. His expression changed.

'‘Good!’'

Taixi was overjoyed. He didn't care one whit what happened to Nuzi. Seizing the moment the Mountain-Overseeing Spirit Talisman was blocked, he turned to flee, leaving the golden Great Parting's Radiance to speed toward Nuzi.

"Dong!"

A manifested Treasured Artifact vibrated and was swatted aside by the radiance. Nuzi had only recently become a Maha; he certainly didn't possess a treasure on par with the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl. He had just neutralized the array's purple light when the golden radiance was already upon him. Alarmed, he could only shift his body halfway and brace for impact.

"Boom..."

Resplendent light shattered and Li Fire dissipated. The light of Audience with the Celestial Gate still flickered, but there was a sharp cracking sound. Nuzi Maha snapped his head up, blood trickling from the nose of his Golden Body as he coughed up fragments of Li Fire.

"Pfft!"

All six arms and four legs of Nuzi Maha's Golden Body erupted with Li Fire, engulfing him in a bright conflagration. He instantly stabilized himself and began fighting the flames, but his burning eyes filled with a mix of ferocity and joy.

'‘The foundation of that Dharma Art is shaking... its power is greatly reduced. His dharma power and divine abilities must be exhausted!’'

'‘He used Taixi's miscalculation to force back the Way of Emptiness... but that was his limit!’'

His mood shifted rapidly from grim to gleeful, and then to sharp malice. But just as a new radiance began to shine from his body, he heard a sound from the Great Void and an explosive roar:

"Tonsured donkey!"

'‘Someone's coming!’'

He was shocked. He no longer dared to speak of "laying down butcher's knives," nor did he dare harbor any malicious thoughts. With visible regret, he shot into the sky, riding a beam of light northward.

A streak of light sped toward them, materializing over the lake to reveal a man in blue-green robes with a sword strapped to his back. He had just arrived. He landed on the lake's surface, coming to a stop beside Li Ximing.

It was Si Yuanli.

The blue-robed man was exceptionally sharp. Seeing the Buddhists retreat, he paused only for a moment. He tossed a scroll from his waist, which instantly manifested countless golden lights. Without even revealing its true form, the scroll’s power gently pressed down on the flickering, collapsing light of Audience with the Celestial Gate. It not only pinned the Merciful Ones beneath it but also allowed Li Ximing to let out a long, ragged sigh of relief.

'‘A pity...’'

Li Ximing's face was still pale. He regretfully caught the returning radiance. The golden light immediately shattered into several strands of red light, which fell back into his hand, their brilliance diminished.

He extinguished the lamp's fire burning on his chest, feeling only a scorching heat in his mouth as his divine abilities dimmed.

'‘At the last moment... my divine abilities and dharma power couldn't sustain the Great Parting's Radiance...’'

In that brief exchange, Li Ximing had simultaneously wielded Spiritual Fires, Spiritual Artifacts, a spirit embryo, and a spirit array. Both the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument and the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire were incredibly taxing on his mind, divine abilities, and dharma power, to say nothing of the Great Parting's Radiance.

Even with his Purple Mansion Realm cultivation and his divine abilities recovering at high speed, his aura was still unstable, his chest tight. When that lamplight had struck him, he had nearly blacked out.

'‘This won't do... I must be more meticulous in the future. My use of Spiritual Artifacts was full of errors, and I made too many mistakes in this fight... Quality over quantity, that's the truth...’'

He had no time to dwell on it. He immediately turned to Si Yuanli and asked urgently:

"What is going on?"

This Daoist Master Qinghu's expression was grim. The attack from the north had been sudden. If Li Ximing didn't know the cause, how could he? He could only raise his head, look ominously toward the Karmic Fire in the east, and reply:

"I fear they've come for the Azure Pond!"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow, a bit of color finally returning to his face. Watching the Karmic Fire flow in the east, he silently activated the Immortal Mirror. He glimpsed a Heavenly Light speeding through the conflagration. Only then did he relax, just slightly. He cast a cold smile at the still-trembling light of his Audience with the Celestial Gate.

"I doubt it!"

---

In the Wilderness, the sky was a bruised, dark grey. Karmic Fire surged as the clouds roiled. The mountain forests had been burned to black ash, exposing the bare rock beneath. Plumes of black smoke rose from the ground, only to ignite into flames in the air.

The Karmic Fire in the sky gathered, spinning into a vortex that descended. Mixed within it were azure-purple wings and crimson down. On the mountaintop, the fire coalesced into a handsome monk. His eyes were pale red, and a red silk sash was tied at his waist.

He narrowed his eyes, plucking a wisp of spinning grey flame from his sleeve. It was tightly entwined with a ring of intersecting golden light. With a casual flick of his finger, the monk shattered the golden ring.

"Om..."

As the golden light shattered, a violent resonance echoed through the air, like the cracking of a great bell or the splitting of a drumhead. It sent the surrounding Karmic Fire into disarray. Sparrow Carp Fish raised an eyebrow, then leisurely folded his sleeves.

"The Pure Yang Bracelets... they really were something."

A rustling sound came from the Great Void. The horse-faced man—Taixi—stepped out and landed on the mountain. The flames of radiance on his body were suppressed beneath his robes, but they still pulsed faintly. Sparrow Carp Fish turned and regarded him with cold eyes.

That single glance made Taixi's heart pound. He quickly bowed in salute, lowering his head.

"Your Excellency..."

A smile spread across Sparrow Carp Fish's face. "Taixi Dashi," he said, his tone full of amusement. "How did you end up returning in such a sorry state? And where is Nu Xiao?"

He chuckled. "You're truly regressing. It seems sending you to the war in the south was a mistake. All those three lifetimes of cultivation, wasted... You fought a mere Daoist Master with one divine ability and managed to get your own Dharma Body wounded."

Taixi was a Maha of the Way of Emptiness; Sparrow Carp Fish was a Maha of the Way of Great Desire. They were technically peers. But Sparrow Carp Fish had reincarnated six times, while the Maha of his own Way of Emptiness, Liangli, had only been propped up by the other's Dao Lineage. What status could he possibly claim? He replied, his voice a mix of embarrassment and helplessness:

"He possesses three Spiritual Fires and a Li Fire Spiritual Treasure... The items he carries are worth more than my life! He was also backed by that Great Purple Mansion Formation... He's difficult to handle. Besides, he’s the one who escaped from Changxiao all those years ago."

"As for Nu Xiao... she couldn't get away in time. She was trapped under his divine ability..."

Sparrow Carp Fish knew the Way of Emptiness was dirt-poor and that its leader, Liangli, was a miser. He had originally sent Taixi and Nuzi just to run interference, to keep the White Qilin from making trouble. He never expected them to fail so completely. Letting the White Qilin rampage in the Wilderness was bad enough, but they had also lost personnel. Scornfully, he said:

"Changxiao? That Yan fellow was just putting on a show for the mountains and seas! So what if it was him? Is the Upper Rite Dao Lineage known for being skilled in combat?"

"The two or three who came out of the Zhao Palace back then were all famous. You've really opened my eyes, Taixi Dashi."

Taixi seethed, but he was helpless. Buddhist Dao cultivation placed little value on personal ability; it was all about bloodline, background, luck, and position. The Maha of the Way of Emptiness, Liangli, was solely focused on cultivating Xuwang and was secretly wary of him. It was an impossible situation. Unable to air his own grievances, he could only pretend not to hear the sarcasm and sighed.

"It was all because of that Merging Fire! I didn't know he possessed such advanced fire arts."

He loosened his robes, and the flames of radiance immediately flared up. Sparrow Carp Fish's gaze dropped, his interest piqued.

"Oh? Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire?"

Taixi nodded and sighed. "I must trouble Your Excellency!"

This Maha was famously shameless. When he first arrived, he'd had the nerve to call him 'Daoist Friend.' Now that he needed a favor, it was 'Your Excellency.' Sparrow Carp Fish, though a Maha himself, despised such people. He sneered, shook his head, and parted his lips.

In that instant, a sharp beak distorted his features, tearing through his face and pulling flesh with it like molten fire. Flames surged as the bright, sharp beak opened in a silent shriek.

The Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire on Taixi's body leaped and danced, then, drawn by the suction, streamed into the beak and vanished. In an instant, it was gone. Sparrow Carp Fish's handsome face returned, his eyes glinting with greed. "Go and stand guard in the north," he said dismissively.

Though some flames still licked at Taixi's body, the worst was gone. He breathed an internal sigh of relief, agreed joyfully, and vanished into the Great Void under the other's dark gaze.

Sparrow Carp Fish retracted his gaze. The great hall behind him had been burned to its foundations, surrounded by surging Karmic Fire. He sat on the master's throne, which was slowly melting, and smiled.

"Daoist Friend Qi!"

A young man stepped out of the Great Void, hands clasped behind his back, looking utterly unbothered.

"Your reincarnation speed is impressive, Daoist Friend."

The young man wore black robes with profound patterns over white, gold-trimmed garments. The woman behind him wore simple, profound-patterned robes of teal. Her features were fair and her temperament exceptional. It was Kong Tingyun.

Her expression was calm. She lowered her gaze, sweeping it over the mountain range below. She recognized it easily. This mountain belonged to her family—or at least, it once had.

The Kong Clan must have moved it here when they took refuge in the Wilderness. It had been left with the Li family ever since and never reclaimed. Even the ruined foundations... they still bore the style of the Profound Peak Gate.

And now, she stood upon it as an enemy.

"Congratulations, Daoist Friend. Your destiny has arrived."

Qi Lanyan smiled, raising an eyebrow. "If the Sea of Desire's Maha Liangli weren't constrained, he surely would have led the charge himself. To think a simple oath from all those years ago would lead to this, allowing you to advance yet again."

Sparrow Carp Fish smiled faintly, unsure if this was a probe. He just gripped the armrest of his throne and asked:

"I must also congratulate Daoist Friend Qi. Just when you need people, the Chengshui Tomb first produces a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert, and now another has broken through. There is even news from overseas... It seems your position is becoming quite stable."

He was naturally speaking of the Chengyun Gate in Jiangbei. But Qi Lanyan took two steps onto the Wu Earth-patterned ground, lowering his head to inspect the designs as he spoke casually:

"That branch... no need to pay them any mind. They aren't one of us, deep down. They caused quite a bit of trouble earlier, displeasing several people. After all, they are used to plotting against others; they rarely find themselves on the receiving end."

"It just forced the master of our Chengyun Gate to use inferior methods to advance prematurely. His path forward is now severed. His hopes in this life are gone. He can only ride this wave and see what arrangements await him in his next life."

Sparrow Carp Fish laughed. "That one is always making radical changes. I doubt he has only one pawn in play."

"Correct." Qi Lanyan narrowed his eyes and said leisurely, "There is also our Senior Tiandong. Aside from Tianyuan, he is the eldest of the 'Tian' generation. He isn't like Tianhuo, who had poor talent and was lucky just to reach the Purple Mansion Realm. And he isn't like Tianwan, who was hopelessly stubborn. He is the hidden piece. Now... where is he?"

Sparrow Carp Fish's expression turned grim, his pupils locking onto Qi Lanyan. "If you could divine that, Daoist Friend, you wouldn't need to come down here to do this sort of work. And the noble Daoist Shanqing wouldn't have been sitting in the golden seat for so long."

Qi Lanyan didn't get angry. He just chuckled, shook his head, and turned, making an inviting gesture.

"Someone has to do it... Please!"
