# Chapter 856: The Dispute

The Wilderness.

A torrential downpour lashed the land. Layers of dark, heavy clouds from Jiangbei drifted south on the wind, unleashing torrential, waterfall-like floods upon the barren hills.

The low-lying structures on the ground vanished beneath the deluge. A scattering of black, ant-like figures struggled for a moment in the torrent before being swept away. Above, streaks of luminous light tore through the sky, cultivators speeding toward the scene.

The leader of the group was a man in a black robe, his aura exceptionally fierce and his eyes glinting with a sinister chill. Riding on wisps of black energy, he came to a halt on the riverbank, his expression grim. A troop of similarly clad cultivators landed close behind him.

At his waist hung the Abyssal Gloom Medallion, an artifact that pulsed with a hazy yet dazzling brilliance. He gave the floodwaters a heavy, sweeping glance before raising the medallion. As he chanted a few lines of an incantation, the token flared with light.

One of the cultivators behind him called out.

“Hall Master! This is already the edge of the Wilderness! Any further south and we’ll reach Azure Pond!”

The warning from his subordinate only darkened the demonic cultivator’s face. The medallion in his hand trembled as he replied, his voice low and menacing.

“There are no traces of light to the south. He couldn’t have flown this fast. According to the Abyssal Gloom Medallion, he must have come down somewhere in the Wilderness. Find him! The medallion can track his position at every moment. We cannot let him escape!”

The cultivators immediately fanned out. The man known as the Hall Master held the medallion aloft, his predatory gaze scanning the land below. The clamor of the storm was soon pierced by the sound of an argument, and a woman rose on the wind to approach him.

She held a simple gray hoop and possessed a striking beauty that made the Hall Master’s eyes light up.

“So it is Hall Master Bai,” the woman said, her voice gentle. “This humble one is Miaoshui. I wonder what urgent matter requires your esteemed presence in our Wilderness?”

Daoist Bai glanced down and saw that his subordinates were being held back by two mere early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. He knew at once that this woman’s background was not to be trifled with. Suppressing his irritation, he raised an eyebrow.

“The Wilderness are ownerless lands. Who is your master?”

If not for a recent stroke of fortune, a rogue cultivator from the Eastern Sea like Daoist Bai would have been inferior to Miaoshui and would have had to treat her with the utmost respect. Now, however, he could put on the airs of a superior. Miaoshui could only grit her teeth.

“While the Wilderness may be ownerless,” she said, her voice tight, “the various clans nearby, large and small, all branched off from our Moongaze Lake. By both sentiment and reason, they are under our protection.”

“Moongaze Lake?”

A flicker of hesitation crossed Daoist Bai’s mind before he pressed on. “Some days ago, an elder of your esteemed clan was also attacked. Now something major has happened on the White River. I fear it was the same group of people. Let us search together.”

He didn’t wait for Miaoshui’s consent. With a casual wave of his hand, his cultivators began to spread out, ignoring the locals.

Miaoshui’s expression changed drastically. “Hall Master Bai, what is the meaning of this?”

Daoist Bai’s followers were a mob of demonic cultivators, with not a decent one among them. How could she let them run rampant in the Wilderness? But she and her companions were hopelessly outnumbered. Crushing a jade talisman in her hand, she issued a cold warning. “You should think this through, Hall Master Bai. Our clan’s cultivators are on the river. It will take them but a moment to arrive. If this triggers a war between our two houses, it will not end well for anyone!”

‘Cui Jueyin and Ding Weizeng are both busy fighting the Capital immortals Dao,’ Daoist Bai thought dismissively. ‘Can they possibly rush back? We sped here at full tilt; the cultivators on both banks of the river must already be aware of our presence. If Moongaze Lake’s people leave their posts, will the Capital immortals Dao just sit back and watch?’

He offered a few perfunctory excuses, but just then, the western sky flared with the light of Li Fire. Several dazzling rays of light arrived one after another, resolving into figures amidst the clouds. The man in the lead had piercing golden eyes and a face devoid of expression.

“Hall Master Bai,” he said, his voice flat. “What is this?”

Behind him, Chen Yang wore a grim expression. The slightly tardy Li Minggong and Qu Bushi stood discreetly among the clouds, observing the scene.

Seeing Li Jiangqian, Daoist Bai grew even more displeased, though he quickly masked it with a smile. “Patriarch Li, someone killed a Protector in my Hall of the Locust Soul and fled into the Wilderness. I’m merely here to conduct a search…”

Li Jiangqian glanced at the motley crew of demonic cultivators below. “Then you’ve wasted your time,” he said dismissively. “Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators are incredibly fast. Whoever was going to leave is long gone. What’s the point of searching now? Surely the Hall Master isn’t using ‘catching a fugitive’ as a pretext for some other crooked scheme.”

The bluntness of the accusation made Daoist Bai’s face turn cold.

The old demonic cultivator had little respect for Li Jiangqian. He cursed him silently. ‘I have inherited a Purple Mansion Daoist tradition! I am destined for the Purple Mansion Realm! In all of Moongaze Lake, only Li Zhouwei has a decent shot at that realm, which puts him on my level. A pipsqueak from a junior generation like you, Li Jiangqian, dares to give me a cold shoulder? You don’t know what’s good for you!’

Through years of unchecked arrogance, he had come to equate his own status with that of a Purple Mansion cultivator. As his face darkened, Chen Yang, hand resting on the hilt of his sword, watched him with a vicious glint in his eyes. His thoughts were surprisingly similar.

‘A cur that got by on a scrap of luck, pushed forward to be a scapegoat, and he dares to oppose my family…’

Li Jiangqian would never cede the Wilderness to Daoist Bai. He stood his ground, his calm gaze fixed on the Hall Master. The atmosphere grew taut, thick with unspoken threats. Just then, another group of cultivators flew in from the east, all clad in golden robes. Their leader was all smiles.

“Hall Master Bai, what brings you to the Wilderness!”

Daoist Bai was somewhat familiar with this newcomer. “Ah, Daoist Tian of Xuanmu,” he said with a smile. “I’m searching for someone. He killed one of my men and is heavily injured. He can’t have gotten far; he must have come down here. He stole something important from me. My men can find him by a tracking art placed on him when he killed my subordinate! I ask that you all give me some leeway…”

“Fine, fine.” The cultivator from the Xuanmu Daoist tradition readily agreed, allowing the demonic cultivators to pass. The Hall of the Locust Soul lacked many things, but not hordes of demonic cultivators, and they swarmed toward the ground below.

The Xuanmu Daoist tradition had once been a demonic path, and its internal affairs were still chaotic. Li Jiangqian knew they would never tell their lower-ranked cultivators about matters concerning a True Monarch. Glancing at the group, he saw, as expected, no direct descendants of the Dai family. They were all minor figures. With Zhu Gong gone north, he could only imagine the tension within the Sacred Writ Gate.

Just as Daoist Tian agreed, a stout man in a golden mask standing beside him spoke up, his voice a low rumble.

“Daoist Master, the Hall of the Locust Soul has countless demonic cultivators. If we let them run free, I fear they will harm the common people of the Wilderness.”

The comment put Daoist Tian in an awkward position. A cold light flashed in his eyes. “Since Fellow Daoist Fu Yuezi has such a compassionate heart,” he said with a tight smile, “why don’t you go along with them and keep an eye on things.”

Fu Yuezi was clearly not thriving under the Sacred Writ Gate’s banner, but the man was nothing if not direct. At the command, he actually descended toward the search party. Qu Bushi recognized him and shot him an indignant look. Li Jiangqian frowned, watching the exchange, a premonition solidifying in his heart.

Seeing Li Jiangqian remained unmoved, Daoist Bai raised his medallion again and performed a quick calculation. A look of urgency flashed across his face. He turned to Li Jiangqian.

“Patriarch Li! I will stop beating around the bush,” he said in a low voice. “What this person stole is of utmost importance to my Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition. I ask Moongaze Lake to grant me this favor. If there are any casualties—a few dead peasants—my house will compensate you with the same number of people!”

To these demonic cultivators from overseas, human lives were nothing more than a quantifiable resource. Understanding dawned on Li Jiangqian. He stood firm in the air, a faint smile on his lips. “Hall Master, you should return the way you came. Forgive me, but I cannot let you pass.”

‘No matter what the Hall of the Locust Soul does,’ he thought, ‘they will never be seen as righteous in the eyes of a True Monarch. And this unknown person who escaped from them could be an invaluable asset. Even if this person is no saint, retreating from the eastern shore just to avoid offending the Hall of the Locust Soul would have a devastating impact on the Li family’s reputation and the entire strategic situation. They’ve brought the fight to our doorstep. We have no choice but to intervene.’

As if anticipating his refusal, Daoist Bai’s eyes grew heavy.

In his view, the Li family was internally vulnerable, with all their capable subordinates dispatched to the north. As long as he could hold back the few people before him and rush into the Wilderness, the Li family would be powerless to stop him. The Wilderness were home only to their vassal clans, not Moongaze Lake itself. Did Li Jiangqian really need to make an enemy of a future Purple Mansion expert over a few mortals? Acting like the Sacred Writ Gate was the only logical choice!

And so, the old man in black feigned politeness as he issued his ultimatum. “Patriarch, you should reconsider. Otherwise, I’m afraid I’ll have to ask your esteemed clan for a pointer or two in a sparring match with my Hall.”

At his command, a burly, wide-eyed man stepped forward. His aura was menacing, but he was covered in the stench of blood and filth, making him less intimidating than he might have been. The Hall Master was confident, but the golden-eyed man before him simply laughed.

“Since the Hall Master has put it that way, please wait just a moment!”

Li Jiangqian took a step forward, rummaged in his storage pouch, and pulled out a golden hammer, showing it to his opponents.

“This…”

Daoist Bai stared, dumbfounded. He never imagined Li Jiangqian would erupt so suddenly. In a blur of motion, the golden hammer swung forward, a torrent of apricot-yellow Li Fire trailing in its wake. It smashed toward the burly man’s face like a bolt of lightning.

“What a piece of trash!” Li Jiangqian sneered.

*BOOM!*

The burly man had no time to react before the hammer smashed into his jaw. A visible spray of blood was instantly incinerated into black smoke by the Li Fire. The immense, apricot-yellow flames flowed over him, brilliantly illuminating the violent downpour.

“Aargh…”

A sharp roar of pain echoed through the night. Sent flying high into the air by the blow, his body engulfed in streaming Li Fire, the man frantically tried to extinguish the flames.

“Li Jiangqian! Are you insane?!” Daoist Bai bellowed, utterly blindsided. One moment, the man was smiling, the next he was swinging a hammer, with no transition between the two! How dare the dignified patriarch of an Immortal Clan, a man of noble blood but with cultivation only at the early Foundation Establishment Realm, be the first to attack? He should have retreated and let his subordinates handle the fighting!

Rage flared in the Hall Master’s heart. He had just raised his hand when a second hammer blow was already upon him. The descending apricot-yellow Li Fire made his innate yin qi boil. His own spirit sword was still at his waist, not yet drawn.

Following the hammer was a wave of True Fire that drifted like feathers. Li Minggong had been watching intently, and her reaction was even faster than Chen Yang’s. Below, the cultivators erupted into an uproar. The members of the Sacred Writ Gate watched, stunned.

‘A fight’s already started? With Li Zhouwei away, Moongaze Lake is already strained dealing with the Capital immortals Dao. Are they really adding the Hall of the Locust Soul to their list of enemies?’

But there was no time for deliberation. As Li Jiangqian swung his second blow, he had already transformed into a streak of fire and retreated. Daoist Bai, seething with rage, found himself suppressed by a continuous assault of True Fire that left him breathless.

“Secret Art of the Locust Shade!” he chanted in his mind.

A wave of dark green light surged from his body. Li Minggong merely frowned, placing the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier before her. She pursed her red lips and, borrowing the power of the spiritual artifact, spat out a sheet of True Fire. She had mastered the Slaughter Jun Gate’s Art of Wondrous Transformations, and this breath of flame, amplified by her Pure Feather Li-Fire and the powerful spiritual artifact, was devastatingly potent.

Daoist Bai’s Locust Shade Ghost technique was not particularly formidable to begin with, and its grade was low. Worse, it was completely countered by her True Fire. The dark green light was instantly reduced to ash, and he was violently pushed back, his face flushing crimson with effort and humiliation.

The battle had barely begun. The demonic cultivators who had started to surround the group froze mid-step, shocked by the scene.

‘Huh?’

‘We’ve never heard that Li Minggong was this powerful…’

For Daoist Bai—the great Hall Master of the Hall of the Locust Soul, the acclaimed successor to the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition, who had been acting with such impunity lately—to be so effortlessly pinned down was the height of humiliation.

Even he was dazed, his face beet red. When he had attacked the Golden Tang Gate, its master, Situ Biao, had already been at the end of his life, with no incredible spiritual artifacts to his name. A simple swarm of demonic cultivators had been enough to overwhelm him. Now, facing a true descendant of an Immortal Clan, his shoddy, third-rate skills were instantly exposed the moment his Locust Shade was touched by True Fire. Her flames were exceptionally fierce, and resisting them was an immense struggle.

The display stunned not only the onlookers, but Li Minggong herself hesitated.

‘Is he really this weak? I’d better not injure or kill him. If the forces in the north are short-handed because of this, it could ruin their plans.’

But Daoist Bai, flustered and enraged, hurriedly raised the Abyssal Gloom Medallion. A ghostly light flared, and a man in heavy armor with an ashen face and ferocious features materialized from the artifact, lunging toward the flames. He radiated an intimidating presence, a Geng Metal Qi mixed with a chilling yin aura, his sparse, graying hair whipping about his head.

Just as he charged, Li Minggong eased the pressure of her attack, allowing the figure to break through the flames. She blocked his advance with a wave of her sleeve, using a surge of True Fire to hold him back. Looking closely at his face, her expression grew complicated.

‘Situ Biao…’

This was the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from the Situ family who had covered the retreat from the Golden Tang Gate. He was also the clan’s current master. Daoist Master Tianhuo had confiscated his spiritual artifact and talismans, forcing him to flee in disgrace. To see him again now, reduced to a spirit bound to another’s weapon…

‘Given his status, and the Golden Tang Gate’s current precarious position, he must have been unable to escape even if he wanted to,’ she thought sadly. ‘He could only sacrifice himself.’

Daoist Bai, however, had not come to fight. Suppressing his fury, he seized the opportunity to ride the wind and dive toward the ground. He had barely moved when a brilliant light flared before him, and another figure materialized in his path.

The man had a sharp jaw, a powerful build, and a fierce warrior’s bearing. Clad in red armor, his body glowed with a fiery scarlet light. He held a long staff, and his eyes, seemingly enhanced by some mystical power, pierced like awls, daunting all who met his gaze.

A wave of danger washed over Daoist Bai, and he skidded to a halt. At the same time, another man appeared on his other side—a gentle, refined scholar holding a scroll, his cultivation equally profound. He raised an eyebrow and looked over.

“I hear Hall Master Bai… wishes to ‘spar’?”

Ding Weizeng, however, was not so polite. He shot the Hall Master a cold glare, leveled his long staff, and pointed it directly between his eyes, as if ready to strike him down at any moment. His tone was as cold as ice.

“Son of a bitch!”
