# Chapter 791: The Sacred Writ Gate

Li Xuanxuan retracted his hand, leaving the pale-skinned man prostrate on the ground, afraid to rise. Only then did the old man’s fury become apparent. He ignored the tea, letting it sit untouched on the table, and spoke in a rasping voice:

"This incident... exactly how much was Li Chenghao involved?"

Li Xixuan remained pressed to the floor, kneeling obediently. "Grandfather... why would you say such a thing?" he whispered.

Li Xuanxuan gave him a dark look. "I know. Li Chenghuai's 'divine insight' implicated a crowd of people. None of you have had a moment’s peace since, and worse, it terrified the external clans and minor sects. That is why I persuaded him to withdraw. Now Li Chenghuai is in seclusion, yet you demand his return. Did you prepare some new shamanic trick to test him? Or devise some convoluted ploy to bypass his judgment? All while ensuring Zhouluo suffers a catastrophic loss of prestige... Is *this* how you conduct yourself as an elder?"

Li Xixuan whispered, "It was only for the sake of Chengpan’s good name."

Li Xuanxuan laughed, a sound devoid of humor. His eyes flashed, his aura suddenly turning vicious. "I don’t care what schemes you plotted. The investigation would inevitably conclude that only Li Hun was guilty of a capital crime. A perfect scapegoat! Li Chenghuai may not dare investigate you personally, but do you think *I* don't? There is no one else here. I will summon Li Chenghuai this instant."

Li Xixuan broke. He shuffled forward an inch, tears streaming down his face as he choked out his words. "Grandson just feels the clan is too cruel! Zhouluo, Xinghan, and you, Old Master, you live comfortably on the main isle, but have you ever once considered what life is like for the other bloodlines?

"The direct-line mortals of other immortal clans live as local emperors, or at the very least enjoy boundless wealth and servants. But our family! Our proud direct bloodline! The moment my children were found to lack spiritual apertures, they were relegated to farming! Mount Qingdu provides just enough food to survive, while every other aspect of their lives is monitored with demonic scrutiny, endlessly harsh. If *my* children are treated thus, what about the others? Our clan boasts a century of glory, but how many direct-line tears are shed in the shadows?"

"Those with outside surnames face no scrutiny from Mount Qingdu; they live quite comfortably. Meanwhile, the number of clan members with cultivation bases grows, both on the isle and off, yet our unity fractures day by day. Have you ever wondered why? Chengpan is one of the loyal ones. Old Master, do you want to see how much attachment those brought in from the periphery truly feel for this clan? Before they awakened their talent, you demanded they eat chaff and wild vegetables. Now that they have spiritual apertures, you demand they dedicate their lives to the lake and the common folk. How can the world be so convenient!"

"I watched this, and my heart ached. I did what I could, privately looking after the younger generations. Then Li Chenghuai took charge of Mount Qingdu. He was so incorruptible. He arrested several clan elders, and all avenues of support were severed. The lake was 'cleansed.' But do you know, Old Master, how many people wept beneath that cleansing? We are all of the Moongaze bloodline! The main isle acts with such heartless indifference!"

He slammed his head against the floor. *Thud, thud, thud.* "I am an old man with few days left!" he wept. "Grandson *is* selfish! I want my sons to live a decent life! But I also cannot bear to watch our clan tear itself apart, growing more alienated by the day. Of the younger generation, Zhoufang and Zhouyang see it most clearly. They have constantly fought to secure shelter and privilege for the children of the elders, only to be repeatedly rejected by Mount Qingdu. If this continues... the clan faces certain disaster!"

Li Xuanxuan’s breathing grew ragged. "What?" he snapped. "You want our family to implement a caste system? You want everyone named Li to be a first-class citizen, enjoying wealth from birth until death? When other families decline, they can till the fields, but someone named Li is forbidden?"

Li Xixuan prostrated himself again, weeping bitterly. "Old Master... the Azure Pond Sect belongs first and foremost to the Chi and Si clans. The Purple Smoke Gate belongs first to the Kan and Wen! Even Myriad Radiance belongs first to the Cheng! Old Master, the world *is* built on ranks! The first class belongs to high cultivators and their descendants! It is common talk that sects are rife with power struggles, yet they *still* have a first class sitting at the top. Our family carries the name Li! Why are *we* forbidden from being first class?"

Li Xuanxuan’s face flushed crimson with rage. He shot up from his seat, drew back his foot, and kicked Li Xixuan squarely in the head, sending the man rolling several meters. "You..." the old man roared. "You read all those books on Mount Qingdu for nothing!"

Li Xixuan’s pale face streamed with blood. "It is *because* I read those books!" he screamed. "Old Master! This affair was only meant to prove that even divine insight can be flawed! It was to free those clan elders and rally our family’s spirit! Li Chenghao didn't know the full plot... I know he only joined because he pitied Chengpan and I dragged him in, but he understood the stakes and he helped me! His daughter Xingsai just died... and Li Chenghao, her father, did not utter a single word of complaint! Yet now, even *he* stepped forward to help me! This shows where the hearts of the clan truly lie! It was Xie and Li Chengzhi who treasured their reputations and retreated! Old Master, can you still tell loyalty from treason?"

Li Xuanxuan, burning with fury, descended into a coughing fit. The violent sound terrified Li Xixuan, who swallowed the remainder of his defense. The old man violently flung his sleeve. "Get out!" he snarled, teeth gritted. "Get! Out!"

Li Xixuan kowtowed three times and retreated, looking utterly broken. Li Xuanxuan coughed violently for some time before sinking back into his seat. Li Shuya, eyes red with alarm, nervously brought him the tea.

He remained seated late into the night. Finally, he retrieved a wooden box from the courtyard, took out a jade slip, and rubbed it thoughtfully. It contained the writings of Li Tongya. He reviewed the contents again and again, remaining silent in the darkness.

Moongaze Lake.

Li Zhouluo returned to the lake and interrogated the West Bank families through the night. As expected, the evidence still pointed back to Li Hun and Ren Ting. Whoever gave the orders from above remained unknown, but all the actual crimes had been executed by Li Hun. Li Hun had been sentenced to death and was still being held in the main hall.

The interrogation revealed that all four petitioners believed they were genuinely committing crimes. Ren Ting hadn't even realized he was being bribed; in his memory, the He woman didn't even have the surname He. Li Hun, meanwhile, despite sensing something was amiss, directed all blame toward An Xuanxin.

'If Father used his art, the results would show the four petitioners as innocent and the West Bank families as guilty. But if I investigate closely, the West Bank families are also innocent... The intermediaries are either dead or have fled.'

He faintly sensed the outline of a conspiracy. Just as he was drowning in work, Li Zhoufang entered the hall and bowed respectfully. His eldest brother already wore a long beard, looking thoroughly middle-aged. Li Zhouluo quickly set his work aside. "Thank you, Elder Brother."

Li Zhoufang looked exhausted. He shook his head slowly. "This incident left Uncle Cheng humiliated. I could not sit by; I refuse to bear the reputation of an unfilial nephew. I came seeking the Patriarch for a reason... My uncle's daughter, our sister Xingsai, who perished... she left a child behind..."

Li Zhouluo’s grip tightened on his brush; he knew exactly what the next sentence would be. He was saved by the sound of urgent footsteps. A Jade Court Guard hurried in. "Patriarch! An urgent report from the wilderness! Lord Cui has arrived on the isle with the Kong family!"

Li Zhoufang was meticulous about protocol, and matters of familial privilege could always wait. He shook out his sleeves and immediately took his leave. Li Zhouluo, granted a moment's reprieve, felt his anxiety about the East sharpen. "Send them in!"

Cui Jueyin strode in, clad in Daoist robes. He and Ding Weizeng were now ranked as the Li family's two greatest combat strengths and were highly respected. Li Zhouluo descended from his seat to meet him. Cui Jueyin bowed and spoke concisely:

"Reporting to the Patriarch: the reason for the Capital immortals retreat has been confirmed. An overseas Dao lineage, the Xuanquan Great Dao of the Matron, emerged from the river, invaded Shanji Prefecture, and forced the White Ye Immortal Sect to flee. They have occupied the Profound Peak Gate!"

"Daoist Master Zhu Gong of that lineage has established a new sect in the mountains, claiming to be the inheritor of the Tongxuan Dao lineage. They established a branch called the Xuanmu Divine Writ Dao, or the 'Sacred Writ Gate' for short. Under the banner of 'aiding the weak and distressed,' they are integrating the Profound Peak Gate, which they also claim as part of the Tongxuan lineage. They have renamed the mountain Mount Muquan and formally declared their dominion!"

Li Zhouluo was deeply shaken. Cui Jueyin continued, "Three months from now, Daoist Master Zhu Gong will host a banquet on Mount Muquan for all cultivators. We have heard that cultivators from the Purple Smoke Gate ascended the mountain just today. Even Daoist Master Tinglan of the Purple Smoke blessed land went personally."

Unlike Li Zhouluo, Cui Jueyin was not entirely surprised. He had, after all, accompanied Li Ximing to the Purple Smoke Gate and had gathered several oblique hints during his long conversations with their cultivators.

Li Zhouluo absorbed the report. "How did the Kong family react?"

The Sacred Writ Gate was claiming the legacy of the Profound Peak Gate under the guise of "aiding the distressed." This instantly turned the Kong family's marginalized status into a sensitive political crisis. Li Zhouluo had seized upon the crucial question, and Cui Jueyin had clearly anticipated it.

"Most of the Kong family members are confused and distraught. Two of their juniors tried to gather information about the Sacred Writ Gate but were severely reprimanded by Kong Guxi. As of now, the Profound Peak survivors have shown no intention of contacting the Sacred Writ Gate, and the Sacred Writ Gate has made no attempt to contact them."

Li Zhouluo breathed a sigh of relief, grateful his own position hadn't yet become awkward. Just then, Chen Yang rushed in. "Patriarch! An envoy from the Sacred Writ Gate has arrived on the isle! He claims he is here to deliver an invitation!"

This news signaled a friendly attitude from the new sect. Li Zhouluo brightened. "Bring him in immediately!"

A young man in ornate gold and azure robes entered the hall. He had fair skin, a wide smile, and was followed by a figure in plain robes and a wide bamboo hat that obscured his face. The young man bowed. "Dai Jinquan of the Xuanmu Divine Writ Dao greets the Patriarch. With joyous events approaching, we congratulate the immortal clan on its evergreen prosperity, enduring for countless generations..."

He rattled off a long string of pleasantries. Li Zhouluo forced a smile in return. "We have often heard of your immortal Dao's great name. To relocate within the seas and acquire such a treasured land is truly a joyous occasion..."

The Li family was, after all, harboring the Kong clan. The Sacred Writ Gate's occupation of their mountain was an awkward topic. Hearing Li Zhouluo’s neutral response, Dai Jinquan’s smile widened. He retrieved a gold-and-azure invitation from his sleeve. "I trust your noble clan has heard. Three months from now, our Daoist Master will host a banquet on Mount Muquan for all cultivators. We sincerely hope the immortal clan will grace us with its presence..."

His purpose achieved, Dai Jinquan offered one more platitude and fell silent. The man in the bamboo hat stepped forward and removed it, revealing an energetic, familiar face.

It was Wen Wu of the Purple Smoke Gate!

Wen Wu produced a purple-gold token. "I am Wen Wu of the Purple Smoke Gate," he said solemnly. "We have met before, Patriarch. I have taken advantage of the Sacred Writ Gate's journey to deliver a message from my Daoist Master."

At these words, Cui Jueyin immediately activated an ocular art to verify him. Wen Wu presented the token, and a plume of purple smoke—a divine ability—streamed from it, coalescing in the center of the hall. Everyone started in alarm, and Li Zhouluo quickly descended from his seat to bow.

The smoke solidified into the image of Daoist Master Tinglan. She scanned the hall, and upon recognizing Cui Jueyin, she raised an eyebrow. "Jueyin. Your Daoist Master Zhaojing already made the arrangements; he discussed this with me at Purple Smoke. The Profound Peak Dao lineage belongs to the Sacred Writ Gate. Out of consideration for Moongaze's reputation, Zhu Gong will not make the first move. Your family should handle the arrangements quickly. It will look better for both sides."

Cui Jueyin bowed respectfully. The apparition vanished. Dai Jinquan and Wen Wu, still kneeling, completed their farewell salutes. Only then did everyone else rise. Wen Wu replaced his hat, and the two envoys departed without another word.

Li Zhouluo had Chen Yang personally escort them out. He released a quiet breath of tension. "Send the Profound Peak contingent up."

'Profound Peak is also part of the Tongxuan lineage? It's not impossible...'

There was already one Tongxuan lineage in Jiangbei: the Xuanmiao Temple, entrusted to them by Changxi. Sumian had always claimed descent from the Tongxuan lineage's Xu Xiang. Li Zhouluo began to ponder.

'Xuanmiao Temple starts with *Xuan*. Profound Peak Gate (*Xuanyue*) starts with *Xuan*. The Sacred Writ Gate's full name is the *Xuanmu* Divine Writ Dao... it also starts with *Xuan*.'

While he was lost in thought, Kong Guxi hurried into the hall. The sect master looked distraught, his face streaked with tears. He bowed deeply. "Patriarch... our ancestral mountain has been *stolen* by the Sacred Writ Gate..."

He used the word "stolen" to make his position clear. Li Zhouluo, hiding his own suspicions, adopted an expression of shared grief and indignation. "Sect Master Kong, I heard the Sacred Writ Gate claims your sect is part of the Tongxuan Dao lineage... How is it we have never heard you mention this?"

At this question, Kong Guxi’s expression filled with resentment and sorrow. "Patriarch," he bowed, "the Tongxuan Dao lineage is an ancient one, and it is indeed connected to our own Fool's Mountain Chase technique. When our founder established the sect, he registered our lineage under the Tongxuan banner, calling ourselves the 'Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains.' But... because our inheritance was incomplete, we could not even name our specific progenitor. We were never recognized by the main lineage. Eventually... we stopped using the title."

"While our Founder was alive, he worked day and night seeking recognition for that title, but it came to nothing. And now... now that it has come to this... purely so they can annex us, *now* they suddenly recognize the connection!"

Li Zhouluo nodded gravely. He stepped forward and solemnly helped Kong Guxi to his feet. "Sect Master Kong, we have discussed this matter thoroughly. Although the Capital immortals sect has retreated, there is no guarantee they will not strike south again. Our own Daoist Master is absent, and the wilderness is fraught with peril. I fear... I fear we can no longer guarantee your sect's safety."

"As it stands, the Sacred Writ Gate has driven off the White Ye Immortal Sect, and Daoist Master Zhu Gong is protecting the Profound Peak disciples. We hear they are searching throughout Shanji Prefecture to gather all the survivors. Sect Master, perhaps you should take your people there. You will be safe from the White Ye Immortal Sect's assassins, and you can preserve your Dao lineage!"

Kong Guxi’s heart turned to ice.

From the moment the Sacred Writ Gate announced they were "aiding the distressed," his hopes of rebuilding his sect had turned to ash. The Sacred Writ Gate was already "saving" and "merging" the Profound Peak lineage. If another Profound Peak Gate suddenly appeared in the west, how would that be interpreted?

The sect master had only hesitated to leave the Li family's protection because the time was not right, not because he intended to abandon his lineage. It was impossible for him not to despise the Sacred Writ Gate, a fact his earlier outburst had made perfectly clear.

But Li Zhouluo's meaning was undeniable. The great tide of events was moving, and it was not something the Kong clan—or even the Moongaze Li clan—could stop. Kong Guxi went limp, collapsing back to his knees in a stupor. "Pa... Patriarch..."
