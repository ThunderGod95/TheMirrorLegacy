# Chapter 548: Escorting and Slaying Demons

Yi Mountain City.

A towering fortress stood firmly against the mountain, with streams of light flowing over it. A middle-aged man, clad in black-gold spirit armor, stood upon a golden shuttle, his sharp gaze under furrowed brows fixed on the distant horizon—keen as a falcon's.

His armor, dark and glistening with black-gold scales, blended seamlessly with the golden bow on his back. Beneath him, his diamond-shaped flying shuttle radiated a sharp golden Astral Qi.

Years of experience had tempered his once-unchecked ambition. His gaze was now slightly lowered, his eyes half-closed, with a calmness that concealed his sharp resolve, his spirit refined and poised for action.

Li Xuanfeng rose on the wind from the city walls, hovering for a moment. In the distant sea of trees, demons circled but showed no sign of advancing. He returned to the wall where a group of young, unfamiliar faces approached him from below.

Only one middle-aged man moved forward, his appearance dignified and scholarly. He spoke softly, "Brother Feng, Fairy of the Autumn Lake is waiting in the city."

Most of those who had followed him south all those years ago had married, had children, and become casualties in repeated battles, devoured by demons. Only Fei Yihe remained at his side, now in his seventies, yet still cautious of taking a higher step in his cultivation.

Although the Azure Pond Sect had never commented directly, the tragic massacre of the Fei Family years ago still remained vivid in his memory, so Fei Yihe dared not act recklessly. Li Xuanfeng nodded, not surprised at all.

If Ning Wan has come, then the Daoist Master must have emerged from seclusion.

Li Xuanfeng's armored boots rang crisply as they struck the ground. Riding the wind down, he soon spotted a woman standing by a small stall in the marketplace, gazing at the wares with interest.

Ning Wan had a unique presence. Although she used an Azure Pond's spell to mask her cultivation, Li Xuanfeng, with his Spirit Eye Perception, sensed her cultivation level with a mere glance. With their cultivation close in level, he approached and greeted her softly, "Xuanfeng greets Senior."

Ning Wan, now at the peak of Foundation Establishment Realm and nearing the Purple Mansion Realm, looked back at him with a gentle smile.

"Not bad... So, when are you planning to enter seclusion for your breakthrough?"

Li Xuanfeng, who had been refining his cultivation since reaching the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm long ago, responded, "I fear my foundation may be unstable... there is no rush for a breakthrough."

Ning Wan nodded, smiling brightly.

"I have seen your archery skills! Thinking back, when that Golden Tang Gate disciple came south all those years ago, it was you who defeated him, was it not?" she asked with a knowing smile.

Li Xuanfeng had not expected her to bring up old events, but now it mattered little. He murmured an apology, while Ning Wan nodded and said, "You were so young then, yet you had already grasped the essence of the bow... At the time, I thought it was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's doing, influenced as I was by Man On Creek or Jiang Boqing's influence. But... it seems fate works strangely, and it led us to cross paths here."

Remembering those days, Li Xuanfeng felt a pang of melancholy, though he showed no outward change in his expression. Ning Wan continued, "There is some news I should share with you."

"I will be glad to hear it," Li Xuanfeng quickly replied, instantly focusing his attention on her.

Ning Wan shook her head and said, "From the overseas Crimson Reef Island, there was a female cultivator of the main bloodline, named Guo Hongyao. She flew to your family's territory and caused quite a scene... Apparently, she wanted to take someone as her disciple, but things did not go well on either side, and they parted on poor terms."

"Crimson Reef Island..?"

The mention of family matters instantly grabbed Li Xuanfeng's attention.

Ning Wan gave him a knowing look, speaking softly, "As she returned overseas, the female cultivator suffered a severe ambush, barely escaping her own territory with her life. She managed to escape with talismans, but her prized artifact was stolen. The perpetrator was outrageously bold, and Crimson Reef Island has already dispatched people to investigate."

Ning Wan's lips curved in a slight smile, clearly amused by the news. Then, she suddenly added, "With the Green Pine Temple Ruins involved, the Crimson Reef Island will likely not investigate thoroughly. The injury to that female cultivator though, will likely set her back for decades with little hope of progress."

Li Xuanfeng froze momentarily, his brows knitting in thought.

"To have robbed a direct disciple of an immortal sect on their own turf... Who would be so daring?"

Ning Wan smiled without responding. The two flew together for a while, then landed in unison in front of Yuan Su's cave dwelling, as if by mutual understanding. They passed the oddly-shaped bronze beasts in the courtyard, surrounded by a swirling white mist that chilled their ankles. Daoist Master Yuan Su lay relaxed on a stone platform up ahead.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

The both of them greeted as they cupped their fists respectfully.

Daoist Master Yuan Su's face appeared smooth and round, always lacking any sense of intimidation, and now seemed even more otherworldly. A faint golden seal swayed at his waist.

Li Xuanfeng and Ning Wan bowed respectfully. With a wave of his hand, Yuan Su gestured for them to rise, asking, "Wan'er... how are matters proceeding?"

Ning Wan answered with deference, "Honored Ancestor, those who were suspected of bearing a thread of fate have all received the news of Green Pine Temple and have each made their way to the sea. No complications..."

"Hmm."

Yuan Su nodded, his fingers resting on the seal.

"After all, the descent of Fruition Attainment from Mount Luoxia has drawn together a few threads of fate—it is to be expected. If these individuals can stand out, whether they truly bear a thread of fate or not, at least they have some skill... They should be able to bring back something from the ruins."

Ning Wan nodded and continued in a soft voice, "However... there is one major development. Daoist Master Suiguan recently visited Crimson Reef Island and then Golden Feather Sect, where Zhang Tianyuan personally saw him off with great respect."

Daoist Master Suiguan was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had mysteriously emerged from the lifeless, emerald waters of the Azure Pond Grotto Heaven. Yuan Su's expression darkened at the news, muttering, "What is he up to now?!"

Yuan Su found dealing with Suiguan exasperating. While Chi Buzi, despite his foul temper, was at least a familiar face and manageable with his not-so-high cultivation, Suiguan was utterly unpredictable.

Yuan Su had hidden himself in Yi Mountain City and even gone into seclusion to avoid encountering Suiguan. Now, upon hearing of him again, his expression soured. After a brief pause, Ning Wan hesitated, then continued somewhat awkwardly, "It is rumored, according to the Chi Family, that he... took a portion of..."

She abruptly stopped speaking, but Yuan Su waved his hand, speaking softly, "Go ahead... say it freely."

As such, Ning Wan continued, "...a portion of Profound Radiant Dual Essence Qi."

Yuan Su sat up, contemplating this information for a moment, then remarked, "Ah... yes, it must be Profound Radiant Qi. Only something of that nature would compel Suiguan to personally make the trip to Golden Feather Sect... He is at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm... could he be attempting to break through to the Golden Core Realm?"

He made this deduction before furrowing his brows and reconsidering, "No... that does not seem right."

The two below remained silent. Yuan Su soon regained his composure, falling quiet before he looked over to Li Xuanfeng and nodded approvingly, "Not bad... You are progressing faster than I expected."

"All thanks to the Daoist Master's guidance," Li Xuanfeng responded politely as he offered his thanks. Over the past decade, Yuan Su had indeed been generous to him, providing spirit armor, precious medicines, Golden Stone Qi, and secret techniques—essentially treating him as a junior disciple.

If not for the sensitivity of these items, which Yuan Su had bestowed upon him directly, Li Xuanfeng would have sent some of them to his family. In fact, Yuan Su's kindness only made him feel more uneasy.

Yuan Su watched him thoughtfully for a moment, then said softly, "Very well. Your current strength is respectable enough to carry some authority. Take a trip to the Eastern Sea and handle two matters for me."

Li Xuanfeng was overjoyed, responding eagerly, "Daoist Master, please give me your instructions!"

He was overjoyed for two reasons. First, he had been confined to this place for decades, and now he finally had the opportunity to venture out. Second, Yuan Su finally had a task for him. Without a purpose, the powerful spells and spirit treasures he had received felt almost burdensome, yet refusing them had never been an option.

Accepting the assignment promptly, Yuan Su explained, "First, I have a group of my disciples needing escorts to Splitreed Island. That sea region has been turbulent recently, and Ning Wan cannot act freely, so you should take this trip."

He added a cautionary note, "Do not stir up trouble; just deliver them safely. If you do encounter resistance, feel free to kill anyone who is not of the dragon clan."

Seeing Li Xuanfeng nodding in understanding, Yuan Su continued, "Once you reach Splitreed Island, continue northward until you reach Unison Sea. There, a market run by my Ning Family has been harassed by a demon. Deal with it on your way back."

"Do we know what it is...?" Li Xuanfeng asked.

Yuan Su promptly replied, "No need for concern. It is only a water-dwelling monkey... a threat to ordinary folks but not to you."

Securing the jade seal at his waist, Yuan Su added softly, "I noticed it has been years since you returned home. Make the most of it and reconnect with your family."

"Thank you, Daoist Master!" Li Xuanfeng expressed his gratitude, and as he saw Yuan Su wave him off, he quietly departed.

After a brief pause, Ning Wan said softly, "Daoist Master... Li Xuanfeng's cultivation has advanced rapidly in recent years. It seems it was merely the lack of resources and techniques in the Li Family that slowed him down. He had achieved nothing remarkable before his breakthrough to the late Foundation Establishment Realm."

"Well, he is a descendant of the Wei-Li lineage," Yuan Su replied, "If he practiced a Bright Yang-aligned path, he would progress even faster... A thousand years ago, the Wei-Li lineage's affinity with metallic essence was impressive—that was akin to the sun descending into the world."

They continued conversing as Li Xuanfeng exited the cave dwelling. Riding the wind, he flew a while before descending at his own cave dwelling.

Li Xuanfeng's dwelling was among the finest in Yi Mountain City. As he pushed open the door, his wife, Ning Hemian, met him with their child in her arms, smiling as she greeted him softly.

"What did the Daoist Master say?" she asked with a smile.

Ning Hemian, being from the Ning Family, often knew things even before he did, so he was not surprised at all by her question. He took the child in his arms and replied, "I will be heading to the Eastern Sea soon, escorting people and slaying demons."

The boy in his arms pursed his lips, his eyes a deep gray, though his brows were softer than his father's. Still young, he appeared rather gentle.

"Qin'er..." Li Xuanfeng called.

"Father!" the young boy called out in a cheery response.

Li Xuanfeng held him close and asked a few questions about recent events. Li Yuanqin responded with short affirmations, while Ning Hemian closed the stone door of the dwelling, voicing her concern, "What does the Daoist Master mean by this? Is he putting you at risk? Could this be dangerous?"

"It should not be," Li Xuanfeng replied thoughtfully, raising his brow as he continued, "I have already mastered Aura Rebound Technique and have the Black Gold Spirit Armor as protection. My combat power is formidable. Unless I directly face the Foundation Establishment Realm heirs of the three sects, most would not stand a chance against me."

Li Xuanfeng continued, "If I can prepare and keep my distance, even a late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm direct disciple from one of the three sects would cough up blood under my arrows. Against ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators... they would fare no better than the demons torn apart by the dozens on the battlefront."

Li Xuanfeng's tone was calm, though the underlying bloodlust beneath his words was strong. He added softly, "Only those in the southern borders know my reputation as the Golden Bowstring... It will be interesting to see what kind of cultivators I will encounter overseas."

Ning Hemian casually responded as she tidied spirit medicines around the cave dwelling, "Yes, yes... we all know how powerful you are!"

Li Xuanfeng, significantly older than her, could not help but laugh when he noticed her youthful demeanor. He thought to himself, When should I take Qin'er back home for a visit? I wonder how Yuanjiao and Qinghong are doing these days...

Through the Ning Family's connections, he had managed to gather various pieces of news about the Li Family, though most were only fragments. Now, with the opportunity to return home, he felt a growing warmth in his heart.

————

Mount Qingdu.

The ritual of burning incense and offering prayers was simple enough. In fact, simply meditating in front of the incense would suffice. Li Qinghong had carefully bathed, changed from her protective armor into Daoist robes, tied up her hair, and then trained before the incense for several months before flying on thunder toward Mount Yuting.

This immortal mountain was now covered in green pines, with snow piled atop its peaks. A sacrificial altar, over ten zhang tall, stood on the summit. It was adorned with carvings of mist, thunder, and rain patterns, primarily crafted from bluestone but reinforced with various metals like copper and iron.

At the top, twelve bronze and silver statues of various forms were arranged in a circle. Some statues captured thunder and dispersed clouds, while others held spears and bore fierce expressions. Eight of the statues had humanoid forms, while the remaining four took on shapes of dragons and serpents.

As Li Qinghong stepped onto this ritual platform, she felt the mana and thunderpool within her begin to stir, and the Profound Thunder Talisman pulsed, eager and active.

Sitting cross-legged at the center, she placed her hands, palms up, on her knees. Strands of violet lightning began to flow from her body, following and tracing along the patterns that were carved into the ground.

Now, the twelve statues should all light up. Dark clouds should gather in the sky, and thunder should appear... that would mark the beginning.

Li Qinghong activated her Immortal Foundation, waiting a full half hour. However, only the violet lightning circulated, with no unusual phenomenon appearing, nor was there any sign of the so-called Heavenly Resonance. Instead, she felt her internal mana depleting significantly.

"Is it really this useless..?"

She waited a while longer, but not only was there no thunder, there was not even a single dark cloud in the sky. With a sigh, she abandoned the secret technique and switched to using thunder to communicate with each statue in turn.

This was another function of the altar, allowing her to calculate where thunder would strike across the land, how many tribulation strikes had fallen recently, and who among wrongdoers was due for retribution by thunder.

"This is probably pointless too... There are not any tribulation strikes these days. Have not even heard of one... this technique is truly ancient."

After testing each statue in turn with no result, Li Qinghong's unwillingness drove her to repeat the process twice. Finally, when she connected with the last dragon-shaped statue, she received a response.

Shiiing...

The eyes of the dragon-shaped bronze statue glowed faintly, and suddenly Li Qinghong had a clear vision.

"Yincheng Prefecture, Wei State... At midnight on the 24th day. Twisting Thunder Tail strikes the ancient cypress tree west of the prefecture."

The statue emitted a flash of thunder before dimming once more, offering no further response.

"Huh..?"

Li Qinghong blinked, feeling an odd mix of surprise and resignation. "It really is an ancient technique! But... what use is this?" she wondered aloud in confusion.

If it truly provided an exact location, Li Qinghong could ride her thunderbolt there and capture this falling lightning with her spells. Judging by the name of it, this was likely some form of spirit thunder of Heaven and Earth, a rare sight in this age.

In recent ages, thunder strikes had become rarer between Heaven and Earth, and as a result, thunder cultivators were increasingly uncommon. Furthermore, thunder was unlike spirit fire or water; it dispersed instantly upon impact. Unless one was extremely lucky or encountered it in the clouds by chance, capturing it was nearly impossible.

However, the information provided by this spell turned out to be the name of a now ancient place, and even if she knew the location of it, finding it would be nearly impossible. Li Qinghong could only sigh in dejection.

"Moreover, this place is likely far to the north in hostile territory under the Wrathful Dao lineage, where deep-seated enmity remains... entangled with threads of fate. It is strictly forbidden to go there."

Li Qinghong calculated that the next thunder invocation ritual was three months away. She planned thoughtfully, "The altar has already been built, and casting the spell consumes only a bit of mana. I will try every three months; who knows? One day, I might hit upon a Yue State city with a familiar name and be able to collect some thunder!"
