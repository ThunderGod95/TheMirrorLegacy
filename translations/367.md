# Chapter 456: Returning With The Serpent

Li Yuanjiao carried the half-dead Hooked Serpent away from the southern shore of Lake Xian at Profound Peak Gate. With the help of the Profound Patterned Bottle, the air was filled with water mist. The Hooked Serpent continued squeaking futilely, begging for mercy.

The creature was enormous, and the mist from the Profound Patterned Bottle could barely conceal it. Li Yuanjiao had only reached the shore when he was forced to land with a frown.

It's too conspicuous... This demon creature is also incredibly heavy. Putting aside the drain on my mana, it's impractical to fly over the wilderness and temples like this.

He swiftly changed course, flying north for a while, intending to go upstream of the river flowing into Lake Xian, pass through the safer territory of the Yue Cultivating Sect, and then only return to Moongaze Lake's northern shore via Xu State.

The travel journals left by Uncle Ling mentioned that the surging river aids those cultivating the Boundless Ocean, so this seems like a good opportunity to explore that.

Li Yuanjiao's Jing Dragon King was a serpent dragon of the lake, which allowed him to dive effortlessly into the water. Submerged, the weight of the Hooked Serpent lightened considerably due to natural buoyancy.

He first summoned several crab demons to inquire about the power dynamics at the lake's bottom and the locations of the demon kings. After planning his route, he dragged the Hooked Serpent slowly forward while pondering Kong Tingyun's recent words.

The Profound Peak Gate could be useful as an ally. I wonder how strong Daoist Master Changxi is... He appears to have a backing.

This could be a good opportunity to form a connection... Too bad my family lacks a suitable cultivator. Otherwise, things would be so much better with a strategic ally to watch over Mount Yue.

I wonder if this is truly Daoist Master Changxi's intention... Whose pawn is he?

As Li Yuanjiao mused on, he ignored the demon creature's chatter. The Hooked Serpent, observing his cautious demeanor, grew despondent and fell silent. After a lengthy pause, it sighed.

"Every demon said that the land is treacherous, yet I was skeptical. I coveted spirit items, only to face the fate of becoming serpent soup!"

Li Yuanjiao glanced at it and asked, "What is your Immortal Foundation?"

"Those at the Demon Palace call it Morning Cold Rain... I'm not sure what you all name it. I cultivate a feathered serpent while you cultivate a serpent dragon. I doubt I'm fit for consumption... If you desire so, I can find a serpent dragon for you, Exalted Immortal," the Hooked Serpent offered.

Li Yuanjiao listened quietly as he walked along the riverbed.

"You worry too much, fellow Daoist. I am neither from a demon den nor a dragon palace capable of binding spirits, nor am I from a temple with the means to purify demonic natures. How can I trust you? Once freed, you would surely flee."

The Hooked Serpent, fully aware of its predicament, curled up listlessly.

Li Yuanjiao pondered as he walked.

Although we subdued the Hooked Serpent in just a few moves, we've mostly relied on external power. The Qingche Sword and Profound Patterned Bottle, being Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts, played a part, not to mention Kong Tingyun's golden mountain and pearl, coupled with that powerful formation—all of which helped suppress this Hooked Serpent.

He observed the serpent's forked tail now without the hooks, unsightly from where Kong Tingyun had cut it.

I wonder if Senior White Banyan Fox is still beneath that tree... There's no need to rush to sacrifice this serpent demon. It might be wise to consult it first.

As he continued along the river, the water shifted between darkness and light, revealing lavish demon palaces, towers made of shells, and white caves.

Encountering two Foundation Establishment Realm demon generals patrolling the area, they were so intimidated by the sight of Li Yuanjiao dragging the Hooked Serpent that they did not dare to even lift their heads before quickly scurrying away.

Li Yuanjiao did not encounter the river's turbulent waves that Li Xuanling spoke of nor did he receive any cultivation enlightenment. Observing the river's wide and lengthy expanse, he mused to himself, "The rivers are broad and long... there should be many treasures here."

Reaching the territory of the Yue Cultivating Sect, Li Yuanjiao emerged from the water with the Hooked Serpent. A cultivator in white, with a sword on his back, stood before him, appearing to be deducing something. Nevertheless, he did not seem to be upset by the interruption caused by Li Yuanjiao.

"Nian Yi from Yue Cultivating Sect greets Senior! Congratulations on capturing the demon general," he said.

Despite Nian Yi being a mere Qi Cultivator, Li Yuanjiao treated him with respect and said, "Apologies for the disturbance, fellow Daoist. I am just passing through your sect's territory."

Nian Yi nodded, then grasped a wisp of spiritual qi and slowly closed his eyes, resuming his deduction.

Traveling southward, Li Yuanjiao observed that Xu State was peaceful—a stark contrast to the chaos of years past. There were no signs of devil cultivators, and the cultivators flying about seemed open and unguarded.

The rogue cultivators he encountered were also courteous, congratulating him on capturing the formidable demon.

"Yue Cultivating Sect is truly different," he sighed in amazement.

Li Yuanjiao pressed on until he finally returned to Moongaze Lake. Several Qi Cultivators from the Li Family came to greet him, led by Li Xuanxuan who looked visibly relieved and greeted him warmly, "Jiao'er, you've returned safely!"

This journey proved quite fruitful, and Li Yuanjiao could not help but laugh as he deposited the Hooked Serpent on the shore. He swiftly reinforced several prohibitions, and soon, Li Family cultivators swarmed the area, sealing and setting up a formation to secure the demon.

Returning to the mountain, Li Yuanjiao laid out the treasures acquired from his expedition. Li Qinghong and the others could barely contain their joy and excitement.

The Profound Patterned Bottle and Profound Yang Li Fire were exceptional finds, and capturing a Foundation Establishment Realm serpent demon was indeed a significant achievement. Li Qinghong picked up the Profound Patterned Bottle carefully, admiring it while wistfully thinking, Too bad Big Brother has already named it. It's such a magnificent Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, yet its name sounds like an Embryonic Breathing Realm qi gathering bottle... I guess we'll just have to accept its basic name...

While the group examined the two treasures, an old man came in. He appeared to be over ninety years old, his frame stooped with age. The cultivators kneeled and bowed deeply to him.

Li Qinghong quickly stepped forward to support him while Li Xuanxuan introduced the newcomer.

"This is rogue cultivator Qian... he's ninety-eight years old."

Handing over three storage pouches to the old man, Li Xuanxuan said, "As agreed before, please proceed, Elder."

Old Man Qian nodded and began to inspect the first pouch. He extended his spiritual sense into it, causing the shimmering treasures inside to spill out onto the floor.

Relieved, he opened the second pouch. After verifying its contents without encountering any traps, Li Xuanxuan handed him a Spirit Stone and a smile crossed the old man's face.

Li Yuanjiao observed the proceedings with keen interest, his eyes narrowed slightly as Old Man Qian reached for the third pouch—exceptional-looking and black, previously owned by a daring devil cultivator.

As soon as the old man's spiritual sense reached into it, a burst of black gas erupted. Li Yuanjiao had already anticipated this and readied a spell to counter it. Old Man Qian could only scream in agony before he exploded, now reduced to a mere puddle of blood.

Li Xuanxuan swiftly cast a spell to remove the gruesome remains from the cave dwelling and called out in a calm voice, "Please get Elder Ding in here."

Li Yuanjiao murmured thoughtfully, "It appears to be a shamanic spell or blood art, devised by a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... It's capable of eroding both spiritual sense and the body. No wonder an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator couldn't even withstand it for a moment!"

Li Qinghong, who was standing by, shook her head solemnly and asked, "How much for his pension?"

"Three Spirit Stones to be sent to his son. We'll also secure a position for him at the peak."

While Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong conversed, another elderly man approached from below. With a confident expression, he cupped his fist to the three Li Family members and extended his spiritual sense into the delicate black brocade bag. With that, the contents within it finally spilled onto the ground.

Old Man Ding was taken aback.

"I thought it was protected by a shamanic spell!" he exclaimed.

Li Xuanxuan handed over a bag of Spirit Paddies and two clan soldiers promptly escorted the elder away.

Li Qinghong frowned, remarking, "That rogue cultivator's eldest son has attempted to reach the Qi Cultivation Realm with unrefined qi twice, but both attempts ended in failure. He's now pinning his hopes on a single pill."

Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao had sorted through numerous items, setting aside the devil cultivator's cultivation technique manuals and pills. He gathered all the spirit items and dharma artifacts of the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realms into a storage pouch.

There remained fifty-two Spirit Stones, most of which were looted from the devil cultivator. With a decisive wave, Li Yuanjiao deposited all into the family's vault and gave the leftover items another look, but found them notably unremarkable.

"These trinkets are hardly useful to me now that I've reached the Foundation Establishment Realm," Li Yuanjiao mused, shaking his head as he distributed them away.

With my advancement to Foundation Establishment Realm and the Profound Patterned Bottle to conceal my presence, I needn't fear detection by that pig demon... I can finally venture into the outskirts of Mount Dali and visit the White Banyan Fox.

————

At the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven, atop the tallest Li Fire Peak, a formation was still activated, radiating a golden brilliance as countless mysterious runes continued flowing around. The gathered cultivators from various sects and gates remained silent.

"Attack!" Chi Zhiyun commanded, who was standing at the center in his shining green Daoist robe, his sword emitting a white glow.

At his casual order, disciples from three sects and seven gates immediately unleashed their spells and activated their dharma artifacts against the grand formation.

The formation was already fragile and the efforts of numerous Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators soon brought it to the brink of collapse. It withstood their assaults for another hour before finally releasing a blinding golden flash and dissolving completely.

As the cultivators erupted into cheers and prepared to swarm forward, a figure emerged from the formation. Wearing a red Hornless Dragon mask and wielding a long spear, the imposing figure laughed heartily.

"Thank you for aiding in the destruction of this formation, fellow Daoists. I shall gracefully accept this Dongli Dao Collection as a gift!" Chu Yi declared, his politeness tinged with unmistakable ridicule.

With a flick of his hand, he unleashed a talisman as someone from below shouted, "Purple Mansion Realm Talisman, Void Origin Escape Talisman!"

With a booming laugh, Chu Yi vanished into the void, leaving the crowd of stunned cultivators behind.

The cultivators were furious, feeling betrayed, yet they also questioned why the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had not intervened. Chi Zhiyun, outwardly seething in the center of the group, secretly sneered after the man departed.

Why didn't the Daoist Masters act? If Yuansu and Qiushui had coveted this Dao Collection and attempted to intercept him, not only would they risk offending Mount Luoxia, but they might also fail to stop him. Suffering humiliation and departing with crushed pride are the best outcomes for them... If the True Monarch of Mount Luoxia took offense, it wouldn't be beyond him to strike down the Daoist Masters on the spot!

Chi Zhiyun then rose on the wind, directing people among the three sects and seven gates to enter in their pre-arranged order.

He landed atop the mountain and gazed at the deserted attic, thinking to himself, The Dongli Sect... The two peak Daoist Masters of the Purple Mansion Realm from Dongli's Eastern Fire Heaven Grotto ended up dying with their sect destroyed... with their Dao lineage absorbed by Luoxia.

In the great void, Daoist Masters Yuan Su and Qiushui watched him depart but did nothing to stop him. They remained silent, watching him leave and until the crowd in the grotto heaven thinned.

"That's enough," Yuan Su finally said, feeling the fluctuations in the great void subside before stepping out and entering the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven. Daoist Master Qiushui followed and remarked softly, "True to his Metallic Essence, Chu Yi is barely holding on after just three years... Judging by his appearance, he's likely to burst and die soon."

Yuan Su quietly agreed, his gaze lifting to the sky, which seemed veiled in a layer of gray mist. Dark light drifted about, and scarcely a figure was visible.

The atmosphere within the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven grew increasingly somber, and the disciples from various sects, having profited, withdrew one by one. Only the two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from the immortal sects remained aloft, observing the dim world below.

"Chu Yi has taken the Dongli Dao Collection," Daoist Master Yuan Su remarked calmly, poised in the air. The golden spring water beneath his feet continued to surge, its brilliance muted by his dim surroundings.

"What a pitiful man," Daoist Master Qiushui added quietly, but Yuan Su responded with a wry smile and said, "We are not in the position to feel sorry for a True Monarch. Cui Mu gambled and miscalculated, ruining the Bright Yang Dao Lineage... He brought this end upon himself."

Daoist Master Qiushui's sleeves fluttered gently as she responded softly, "Mount Luoxia has oppressed Bright Yang for five hundred years, and now it has seized Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven. If this continues for another five centuries, perhaps it will be Huangtian of Ancient Wei that falls next, paving the way for Mount Luoxia to nurture another True Monarch—or even an Exalted Immortal. Everyone in the region merely watches... isn't anyone going to do something about this?"

Daoist Master Yuan Su listened, his expression a mix of both amusement and contemplation as he toyed with a small golden seal. Smiling, he teased, "Wasn't your Golden Feather Sect most loyal to them, even referring to them as the Luoxia Upper Sect? Yet... your remarks don't align with your sect's loyalty. Your ever-changing stance is truly vexing!"

"Tiaoxiao!" Qiushui sighed, her face colored with slight embarrassment as she continued, "Immortal or mortal, no one finds servility appealing... No need to take it too seriously."

Yuan Su shook his head and replied, "I know, I know... I only say that to you."

Daoist Master Qiushui waved her slender hand, causing the golden spring water on the ground to splash up into her grasp. She said softly, "You and I need not concern ourselves further with this. Let's head north to Yue Cultivation Sect and Lotus Temple; let them handle the rest."

"Once this is over, the yang will fade from heaven and earth, and yin will find its balance, ushering in the Profound Balance Atmosphere. It will soon be time for Shangyuan's breakthrough. By then, you and I will have much to do."

Daoist Master Yuan Su stood with his hands clasped behind him as he watched her gather the spirit water before speaking again.

"Buzi has journeyed to the Eastern Sea, Yuan Xiu to the southern border, and Yuanwu is focusing on his own opportunities. What you suggest about troubling Junior Brother sounds fine in theory, but how many Purple Mansion Realm artifacts has Yuanwu Peak actually produced? I haven't seen him contribute anything substantial. I'm the only one who has my cultivation severed and is busy running around."

Daoist Master Qiushui smiled slightly and responded, "I'm pretty sure you will be rewarded for all this trouble!"

A flicker of irritation crossed Yuan Su's face as he replied, "It's only here in Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven that I can speak freely... Those in Azure Pond Grotto Heaven are used to ordering others around. Whether their approach is effective is debatable, but one thing is for sure—their methods lack purity."
