# Chapter 565: Ewu

Ewu had lain in ambush near Golden Sack Island for several years, but his senior brother, Mutuo, still had not emerged from the island.

Both he and Mutuo had originally been monks at Qinling Temple in Youxiang Prefecture. After the Maha's fall, the temple collapsed, and Mutuo and Ewu fled Zhao Prefecture, each going in a different direction.

Qinling Temple's lineage had already been in decline; without even a protector like The Merciful One, and after the fall of the Wrathful One, the lineage had weakened more considerably. Many of their methods for divination and combat were now ineffective, forcing them to hide in various places.

Mutuo, though not skilled in combat, had managed to retain the temple's Dao lineage which allowed him to calculate others' movements, enabling him to live in relative comfort. Ewu himself, however, despite being stronger, lacked comparable divination skills which made his years rather difficult in comparison.

He had fled Zhao Prefecture to the Eastern Sea, passing through the Scarlet Pristine Sea when he sensed that something was wrong. Setting up a high altar for divination, he discovered that his senior brother's physical body had been shattered, and he was so wounded that he did not even dare reincarnate back in Zhao. His heart stirred at this revelation, "In normal times, you can hide your aura, preserve the lineage, and evade my searches... But now that your vial qi is depleted, the opportunity has finally come for this old monk!"

Over the years, Ewu had encountered a few fortuitous events. Combining these new skills with his knowledge of the Dao, he managed to divine Mutuo's location after vomiting three mouthfuls of blood, tending to his wounds before setting up his ambush.

The inheritance of Buddhist cultivators was tied to destiny, and Qinling Temple's Dao lineage was intricately linked to Mutuo's fate. As Mutuo's junior brother, if he could kill Mutuo and absorb his essence, the lineage would naturally fall into his hands.

However, despite lying in wait for several years, Mutuo had yet to appear. Instead, Ewu sensed the presence of a treasured artifact. The Buddhist cultivators of Zhao Prefecture were not known for much, but they were unmatched in survival techniques. Bold as ever, Ewu decided to investigate first, rushing off on the wind.

Meanwhile, Li Xuanfeng was standing still, cultivating on the sea, awaiting news from Golden Sack Island to the south when he saw a flash of golden light racing in from the north.

The figure hovered nearby, circling the area.

Using a perception technique, he took a closer look. Sure enough, it was a large monk with a long face and deep-set eyes, holding a pair of short staves. His entire body was flushed red, and his eyes were wide with anger. Clearly, he was a member of the Wrathful Dao lineage.

This monk's aura was intense, with a golden flame blazing all around him. Li Xuanfeng observed him from a distance, quietly reaching for the Golden Age Longbow strapped to his back and watching the newcomer intently.

Is this Mutuo...?

Li Xuanfeng watched coldly, sensing that something was off. According to Ning Family's intelligence, Mutuo should have been severely injured and not yet recovered, and besides, he was not known for wielding dual staves.

Seems this is an ally of Mutuo's... another lackey of the Wrathful Dao...

Although he had not managed to lure Mutuo out, he had instead caught the attention of a Wrathful Dao monk. Li Xuanfeng kept his gaze fixed on him, waiting patiently with his bow.

The monk, wearing half a robe and carrying two long staves on his back, looked like a warrior monk. He patrolled the sea area where the artifact's aura had been sensed, circling around the same spot. Li Xuanfeng kept his distance, relying on his perception technique to watch from afar, undetected.

Li Xuanfeng's Black Gold Spirit Armor, a Foundation Establishment Realm armor known as Black Tiger Eyes, naturally concealed his aura, making it unlikely that the monk would even be able to detect him if he approached. Still, aware of the Buddhist cultivators' strange abilities, he kept his distance, just in case.

Ewu frowned as he scanned the area. Suddenly, he perked up, his keen eyes spotting someone flying in from the south, lurking suspiciously and circling the area. However, this newcomer's cultivation level was merely at the late Qi Cultivation Realm. Seeing an easy target, Ewu sped towards him and shouted, "Who goes there!"
ùíªùò≥ùò¶ùò¶ùò∏‚ÑØùí∑ùòØùò∞ùë£‚ÑØùëô.ùò§ùëúùòÆ

The Golden Sack Island cultivator jumped in fright, sneaking a glance at Ewu and confirming he was indeed a Buddhist monk. He thought to himself, So, this must be the one with the treasured Buddhist artifact that the lord spoke of. I will have a few words with him and let the lord handle it!

He took a step back, intending to deflect Ewu's attention and then return to the island. Confident in his connections, he replied softly, "Greetings, senior. I am from Golden Sack Island..."

However, before he could even finish his sentence, Ewu's face contorted into a cruel smile. Reaching out, he sent a force surging through the cultivator's body, causing his face to flush and his forehead to bead with sweat as he scrambled to reach for the talisman hidden in his sleeve.

Ewu's combat skills were exceptional, even among monks. Master Monks were inherently stronger than Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, and even with his Dao lineage weakened, he was far too much for this cultivator. The cultivator felt a rush of blood to his head as the monk moved in closer to him, grabbing him by the collar.

The cultivator opened his mouth to plead, but a mouthful of blood spurted out instead. His protective barrier flashed brightly, but it was merely a Qi Cultivation Realm shield and disintegrated instantly under the Master Monk's strike.

"My lord! My lord..."

Ewu ignored his cries, dislocating the cultivator's limbs and pulling out his white bones almost effortlessly.

Pressing a hand on his skull, Ewu‚Äî though unskilled in soul searching techniques‚Äî had learned a thing or two. After scanning through the cultivator's recent three-day memories, he laughed loudly and said, "Situ Mo is truly a coward! If not for that, my senior brother would have fallen into my hands long ago."

Not only did he spare the cultivator, but he used his mana to keep him alive. Carrying the limp body, he found a banyan tree on the island and secured the cultivator's head to it, preserving his life force.

Then, taking a handful of blood from the corpse nearby, he smeared it across his face, his features twisting and shifting until they morphed into the appearance of the Golden Sack Island cultivator.

"Hmm...Heh,"

Ewu chuckled sinisterly before rising on the wind, flying south with a carefree air.

After a good ten breaths, Li Xuanfeng finally landed by the edge of the island. He took slow, measured steps forward and raised his gaze to look at the large banyan tree.

The head affixed to the tree bore a strange expression, somewhere between a smirk and a sneer, a mingle between anger and excitement. It seemed that this man was still alive, caught in some delusion of escape or dreams of revenge. Li Xuanfeng studied him intently, his eyes narrowing. The sand and pebbles at his feet clinked and rattled, jumping and scraping against each other which produced a sharp, grating sound.

His gaze grew fierce, as if he could devour a person at any moment.

This man's fate reminded Li Xuanfeng of his younger brother, Li Xuanling, who had been beaten and killed and his body devoured at Zhenhui Temple.

Back then, only Li Tongya had managed to bring back the remains, and even that was just a lone head. Li Xuanfeng had been stationed in the Southern Border and had not witnessed it himself. Now, staring at this head, a boiling rage surged within him, his eyes nearly splitting in fury.

Unlike Li Xuanxuan, who had broken down in sorrow and hatred, allowing inner demons to take root, Li Xuanfeng's expression grew colder the deeper his hatred grew. In his mind, he calmly analyzed the upcoming situation, his bowstring vibrating slightly and producing a series of sharp, eagle-like whistles in the air.

He then turned, striding step by step along the coastline until he reached the shore. He lifted on the wind, headed straight toward Golden Sack Island.

Disguised as the Golden Sack Island cultivator named Situ Er, Ewu flew swiftly on the wind. Halfway there, he encountered someone‚Äîa man in a golden robe, at the Foundation Establishment Realm, clearly a guest cultivator from Golden Sack Island.

Though Ewu had used specialized spells and blood qi to create a perfect disguise, it was not flawless before a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, especially if that cultivator specialized in perception techniques. Without any delay, Ewu hurriedly used the title from Situ Er's recent memory, saying urgently, "Master Zong, do not delay! Report back to the island at once!"

Ewu continued, "A monk and a cultivator are fighting up ahead, struggling over something that is shining like gold! They have taken the fight to the ocean floor, and it is a matter of life and death! Please, honored guest, alert the lord immediately!"

This Master Zong had dispatched five or six scouts earlier, with the person Ewu was impersonating being the first to return. Hearing this, he did not dare linger. He quickly replied, "Understood! Point me in the direction; I will go ahead and keep watch while you return to report."

Ewu had planned for every reaction, ready to adapt as needed. Casually, he pointed the guest cultivator in a direction, then continued on his journey to the island. Landing at the edge of Golden Sack Island, he spotted a rough-looking monk flying toward him.

"Senior Brother!"

Ewu was momentarily startled; his disguise might pass before a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, but fooling Mutuo, a fellow Master Monk, would be far more challenging.

However, Mutuo only cast him an impatient glance and snapped, "What is going on?!"

Only then did Ewu recall that Mutuo's physical body had been shattered, rendering him unable to recognize people accurately. Holding back a grin, he swiftly conveyed the message, prompting Mutuo to grow tense. The monk immediately flew off to find Situ Mo, while Ewu waited cautiously outside the formation.

Inside the hall, Mutuo, who was now dripping in sweat, feeling both furious and alarmed, exclaimed urgently, "Situ, get me three or four guest cultivators at once!"

Situ Mo, having overheard the conversation between the two earlier, merely frowned in suspicion.

"Could it really be true? It sounds too good to be true... I suggest we send someone to check it out first..."

"No!"

Mutuo, still visibly shaken, sighed, "Thank the heavens you had the foresight to act carefully! The person just now was no longer Situ Er! He was actually my junior brother! He must think my physical body is too damaged to see through his disguise, but he does not know that the Master taught me the secret technique of Blood Mask... I recognized him the moment I saw him!"

"Your junior brother...?" Situ Mo repeated. Ever quick-witted, he grasped the situation instantly. Speaking in a low voice, he asked, "What do you intend to do?"

Mutuo said urgently, "Stop wasting time squabbling! If we delay too long, that sly bastard will grow suspicious. Just bring a few guest cultivators with me, and I will lure him into the formation..."

"Rubbish!" Situ Mo cut him off sharply, "Do you think he will walk into the formation willingly? You are better off taking a few guest cultivators with you and setting an ambush around him!"

Mutuo paused, momentarily stunned, realizing that Situ Mo's reasoning made perfect sense. If this were truly a trap and he were anxious to escape, he would not needlessly call others into the formation; doing so would only arouse Ewu's suspicion and might cause him to abandon the plan.

Without stopping to praise Situ Mo, he hurriedly called four guest cultivators to join him and sped out on the wind.

As Situ Mo watched the group leave, he felt a slight pang of realization, thinking to himself, So it was the Wrathful Dao lineage's ambush after all. I knew this was too good to be true...

He took a couple of steps forward, just reaching the edge of the formation, and calculated, "With Mutuo and the four guest cultivators... There is no way this Ewu can escape. I should still exercise caution and refrain from leaving the formation recklessly..."

Taking a step back, he stood within the gleaming formation, watching the outside in silence.

Mutuo, now outside the formation, was flanked closely by the four guest cultivators who guarded him tightly. The disguised Ewu, posing as Situ Er, grinned and said excitedly, "My lord, come with me!"

Mutuo nodded, moving forward on the wind toward the north, preparing to strike. The four men at his side subtly edged closer to Ewu.

The four guest cultivators, all at the Foundation Establishment Realm, displayed no change in their expressions, but their actions were telling. After flying only ten li, Ewu finally sensed that something was amiss, his mind suddenly alert. Noticing this, Mutuo, who had been watching carefully, shouted out a single command.

"Attack!"

All four guest cultivators sprang into action instantly. Golden, radiant artifacts flew from their hands, weaving a blazing web in the sky as they launched their assault on Ewu.

These artifacts were all of the Golden Tang Gate, but their techniques varied wildly, chaotic and unrefined‚Äîclearly, these guest cultivators were originally Eastern Sea cultivators who later joined Golden Sack Island. Their power, however, was nothing extraordinary.

"You damned dogs!"

Ewu reacted quickly, forming a hand seal that emitted light. Golden flames ignited around his limbs, and a three-headed, six-armed figure materialized behind him, each hand wielding a short staff or hatchet.

Seeing this, Mutuo burst into laughter and sneered, "With me here, do you still think you can escape using some escape spell? You really spared no effort, even bringing a treasured artifact to bait me... Now, it seems you have lost both your plan and your prize!"

Though his aura was weak, Mutuo effortlessly cast a hand seal that shot a beam of light forward. Without further motion, the light blurred the shadowy figure behind Ewu. With a cold smirk, Mutuo declared pridefully, "I am the true head of Qinling Temple!"

With his inheritance intact, Mutuo had little difficulty breaking Ewu's spell. He called the four Golden Sack Island cultivators to close in on Ewu while he kept his distance, merely interfering with Ewu's spells from afar.

"...So Senior Brother held back a trick or two when he passed down the teachings!"

Surrounded by his opponents, Ewu remained calm, cursing bitterly under his breath and responding coldly, "Do not underestimate me, Senior Brother!"

Golden light flowed from his hands as he drew two long staves, each intricately etched with golden patterns. He crossed them together with a loud clang, deflecting the four incoming attacks.

With a fierce stance, he swung the staves at his attackers, ignoring the weapons piercing his body. His eyes glowed with golden light, heating the air around him in visible waves.

The physical bodies of Buddhist cultivators resembled clay; when the weapons pierced through his body, no blood emerged, instead, the wounds sealed with a sticky resilience after each strike. Nonetheless, Ewu's ferocity made the guest cultivators hesitate, not wanting to sustain injuries that could disrupt their cultivation. For now, they moved cautiously, making sure they did not get too close.

Of course, none of them expected to capture the monk immediately. Without employing their full Immortal Foundation abilities, they tested each other's strengths.

The flashes of light clashed constantly, creating violent explosions in the sky. Mutuo's eyes gleamed with greed as he cast a glance at his junior brother, Ewu, and muttered, "If I devour your body, I can cut down decades of recovery time!"

Ewu sneered, assessing the battlefield. He had several backup plans and felt certain he would not die here. At most, he would have to surrender this Master Monk's body to Mutuo. For now, his only thought was to escape with minimal losses.

You may escape, but can that artifact on you escape as well?

Mutuo, sensing Ewu's intentions, smirked to himself. He coughed, spitting out blood, then wiped the corner of his mouth. Examining the dark red blood in his palm, he suddenly froze.

"What is going on...?"

A chill spread across his face, and blood began to drip steadily. Turning his head slightly, he felt as if his left eye were about to burst, his remaining vision filled with overwhelming golden light.

This golden light seemed to stretch across the sky, vast and penetrating, though barely visible if he tried to look directly at it. A searing pain pricked his face, filling him with dread.

"This damned traitor has backup!"
