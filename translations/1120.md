# Chapter 1120: The Lifeless Marshland

The immortal's cave vibrated with brilliant colors. In its center sat a man, array diagram in hand, brow furrowed in thought. A long time passed before he finally looked up, releasing a heavy sigh.

Liu Changdie rarely left the island, and his days were tranquil. With no further path to walk in his cultivation, his mind was consumed by Dao-Profundity and the Dao of arrays. It was, in truth, a life of reclusive contemplation.

Any resentment he once felt about his inability to advance had long since faded away.

'It's not so much that I've accepted my fate... It's more that reaching this realm in one lifetime is already worth it.'

He suddenly sensed something. Pinching his fingers in a quick calculation, his eyes lit up. He rose from his position, blurred out of the cave, and looked west. A swath of azure clouds drifted ethereally toward him, landing before the island to reveal an old Daoist Master.

Liu Changdie felt a flush of embarrassment and quickly bowed his head.

"Greetings, old senior!"

The old man simply nodded, a faint smile on his lips.

This was the elder Daoist Master Shanbai, known for his kindness and charity. He was a 'Horn Wood' Daoist Master at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. Cultivators traversing the region always showed him a measure of respect. His sect was situated by the sea, and he had remained completely untouched by the great conflict between north and south.

Daoist Master Shanbai did not seem to find Liu Changdie a stranger. He cupped his hands and smiled.

"Karmic affinity truly follows us. Daoist friend, you have also reached the Purple Mansion Realm! It seems the Four Constant Wood was not given to the wrong person after all!"

Liu Changdie's embarrassment deepened. Back when his cultivation was low, he had relied on memories from his past life, knowing that a rogue cultivator had once saved an old man on an island in the Eastern Sea and received a treasure. He had played the part of the patient farmer, waiting by the stump, and snatched the opportunity for himself.

The problem was, the karmic gift he'd received should have been of the 'Returning Earth', but it had manifested as Wood Virtue. He had been confused at the time, assuming the old man had simply acted on a whim.

Now, of course, he understood the truth. This Daoist Master Shanbai had come down the mountain to manifest his grace for a specific, chosen person. Liu Changdie had merely intercepted it. He bowed deeply, mortified.

"Senior, I have truly made a fool of myself. I can only hope I did not disrupt your greater plans!"

Daoist Master Shanbai shook his head, his smile gentle.

"It was nothing so grand. I merely saw the blood descendant of an old acquaintance and offered a hand. I had his junior bring a spiritual item back to him, hoping to help him break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Alas, he was overwhelmed by the spiritual infusion and perished. I never learned if he managed to use the item in the end. Whether you were there or not, Daoist friend, it made no difference to the outcome."

Liu Changdie could only nod. Just as their conversation paused, the northern sky filled with mist and rain. A chariot pulled by massive crabs and drawn by a Flood Dragon emerged, revealing a woman within.

The woman was dressed in a white Daoist robe, her beauty clear and refined. She stopped her conveyance gracefully before the island. Liu Changdie stepped forward and bowed.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Daoist Master Xiang Chun returned the courtesy.

"I have come as requested. You are too polite, Daoist friend."

Liu Changdie knew exactly what "requested" meant; he had long anticipated this day. In his previous life, he had never even met Li Xuanxuan. The old man had died tragically, far, far too early, seemingly lost during a demonic calamity.

'He must have dodged that fated death,' Liu Changdie thought. 'All these years, he must have been sustained by spiritual items to have lasted until today. But with Yuanjiao gone, it falls to me to protect his father.'

Liu Changdie led her to a seat in the pavilion. Daoist Master Shanbai, having spent many years in the Eastern Sea, was acquainted with the Daoist Master and greeted her casually. Liu Changdie, ever polite, had tea served.

"The old man is not only an elder of King Wei," he said, "but also Yuanbian's benefactor. We have troubled you to come all this way, Daoist Master. If you require anything at all, you need only to command."

"I would not dare call it a command," Daoist Master Xiang Chun replied with a nod.

The three Daoist Masters looked up in unison as the Great Void rippled. Li Ximing emerged in a streak of light, bowing to each of them in turn.

"I apologize for troubling you all!"

Behind him, Li Xuanxuan was utterly dumbfounded. He stared blankly, a thousand emotions caught in his throat.

His affliction was a fundamental decay of his foundation—incurable, irreversible. In any other family, or even in his own just a few decades prior, he would have simply been kept comfortable to live out his final days, waiting for the end.

Yet here, three Daoist Masters had gathered for him. Including Li Ximing who had brought him, four great Daoist Masters were bustling about for his sake—for his worthless, broken body!

Li Xuanxuan had never thought of himself as anyone significant. In his day, low-level cultivators in the markets fell like weeds; countless talents perished young in battle. If not for his capable juniors sparing him the need to fight for his life, and a sliver of meager luck... how could he still be breathing? He had lived more than long enough.

Li Ximing had insisted he come, and Li Xuanxuan had only agreed to set the young man's mind at ease. Now, his eyes reddened, and his heart trembled.

'This wretched body... how could I be worthy of this?'

Everyone present was a Purple Mansion Realm expert; they could read the situation as clear as day and naturally sensed the old man's turmoil. Daoist Master Xiang Chun retrieved a talisman from her sleeve, her expression softening with emotion.

"When this letter reached the Dragon Palace, Heyun read it first. He made a special trip to the Thunder Pool, and only then did we learn that the old master is also the Thunder Maiden's great-uncle. Publicly or privately, this is no small matter."

A flicker of hope ignited in Li Xuanxuan's eyes.

"I haven't seen Qinghong in so many years..."

Li Ximing turned his head away, his expression unreadable. Daoist Master Xiang Chun, meanwhile, began to prepare the Valley Water. The talisman in her hand swayed as she spoke softly.

"The Thunder Pool contains the deepest secrets of thunder-devouring. It requires a guardian, and its mysteries cannot be exposed. It cannot be left unattended."

The old man nodded, again and again. Seeing Daoist Master Xiang Chun explain this to him personally, Daoist Master Shanbai, who stood to the side, was inwardly reeling.

'No wonder they've mobilized such forces... This is an intervention on par with healing another clan's Daoist Master. So _that's_ who this old ancestor is...'

Daoist Master Xiang Chun shifted the talisman. A gentle, dark light flowed from it, instantly calming the old man's agitated mind. He closed his eyes as she began to form a divine ability in her hands. Daoist Master Shanbai reached out and placed his fingers on the old man's wrist to read his pulse. Silence fell over the pavilion.

A long moment passed before Daoist Master Xiang Chun opened her eyes, meeting Liu Changdie's anxious gaze. She exchanged a glance with Daoist Master Shanbai, then spoke first.

"The old man's core problem is, indeed, the exhaustion of his lifespan. Though he suffered severe injuries in middle age that cost him a decade of life, he was fortunate to recuperate well in his later years. He did not let the damage spread and even managed to nourish his foundation. That he has lasted until today is a testament to his efforts."

She continued, "I sense a golden pill within him, likely a method from the Hengzhu Dao Lineage. It is used to calm the mind and disperse heart-demons. The Hengzhu methods are known for their uncanny efficacy, and this has been a great help to him. Without this art, his body would have given out long ago."

Li Ximing nodded gravely. The old man wiped a tear, his thoughts drifting to Li Xijun. The two Daoist Masters fell silent. Li Ximing considered the atmosphere and said,

"Grandfather, you haven't seen Senior Liu in a long time. Why don't you go and catch up?"

Li Xuanxuan nodded silently and allowed Liu Changdie to help him from the pavilion.

Once they were gone, Daoist Master Shanbai nodded and took over the conversation.

"This matter of lifespan... ever since Wood Virtue declined and withered in ancient times, the path has been flawed. After it suffered the Severing Nurture Calamity, it atrophied even further. Taking unorthodox routes is often the most effective solution, but the old man's cultivation is too low. Such methods would be too harsh for him."

Daoist Master Xiang Chun said, "I was instructed upon coming here that he should be gently nourished. His cultivation is low, so I will not speak of methods like vassalization or refinement. Other techniques, like carving bone or replacing blood, are far too agonizing and bloody. I hear your noble clan follows the righteous path, so I would not dare suggest them."

"As I see it, the best method is to directly extend his lifespan. The old man cultivates Pristine Water. Given his low cultivation, supplementing his life-force should not be overwhelmingly difficult."

The two Daoist Masters conferred quietly for a moment. Daoist Master Shanbai then looked up.

"This method of extending life is fundamentally a way for low-level cultivators to leech off the resources of high-level ones, 'stealing' a fraction of the longevity they themselves could not attain. By stealing one or two-tenths, they also forfeit any future possibility of breakthrough."

"Take your clan's elder. Breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm would grant him another hundred years. We can use secret arts and spiritual resources to simulate that breakthrough's True Essence for him, allowing him to gain a tenth or two of that span. If you are willing to provide one portion of a Horn Wood spiritual resource and one portion of either Valley Water or Pristine Water spiritual resource, we can use our divine abilities to harmonize them. Combined with some common life-extending pills for low-level cultivators, we might be able to try for twenty years. Anything more than that," he concluded, "will depend on the old man's own fortune."

He had spoken with considerable tact. Li Ximing simply cupped his hands and sighed.

"Please, just do everything you can."

He then produced the 'Horn Wood' spiritual resource, the Golden Branch of the Late Tassel, and also retrieved a jade bottle. He passed them to Daoist Master Xiang Chun, saying solemnly,

"This medicinal pill is something I acquired in my early years. It has the ability to extend one's lifespan. I ask that you examine it, Daoist friend."

Daoist Master Xiang Chun accepted the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill. As she examined it, she was momentarily struck speechless. After a long pause, she carefully secured the bottle.

"This... this is an extraordinary pill," she said, her voice laced with disbelief. "It actually uses the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness, and its other ingredients are priceless. If this pill is used... it could add ten years at the very least. But..."

The woman pressed her lips together. "This pill would grant a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator _ten years_ as well. That is not an insignificant sum that can be replicated with a few spiritual resources, as one might for a Qi Refining cultivator. If someone like Xianyao learned of this, they would stop at nothing to trade for it. Daoist friend, have you truly thought this through?"

Li Ximing let out a soft sigh.

"If I had not already considered this long and hard, how could I possibly have brought it out?"

Daoist Master Xiang Chun exchanged a look with Daoist Master Shanbai. After a moment's thought, she said,

"There is no immediate rush to use it. Twenty years is a significant amount of time. Perhaps we should proceed this way: Daoist Master Shanbai and I will first focus on recuperating the senior's body and extending his life by those twenty years. If, in that time, King Wei should find another wondrous treasure or prescription, it will not be too late to reassess."

"As for this pill, I will still prepare a prescription for you, detailing a special method for its ingestion. We simply will not use it yet. This way, should it be needed in the future, it will not become a source of guilt for the old man."

Daoist Master Xiang Chun clearly disapproved of such extravagance, but her words were tactful. Li Ximing understood and nodded silently.

"I can only thank you for your trouble."

Both masters waved their hands dismissively. Daoist Master Shanbai sighed.

"Zhaojing is not the first to seek me out for such a thing. Years ago, Daoist friend Tingyun brought an elder here to cure a persistent malady. A divine ability is a precious thing, it's true, but every family has loved ones they cannot bear to part with."

"Indeed..." Li Ximing murmured, but then his eyebrows rose. "Senior, I was wondering... what exactly is this Severing Nurture Calamity you mentioned earlier?"

Daoist Master Shanbai paused. He glanced at Daoist Master Xiang Chun, and seeing her placid expression, he seemed to come to a decision.

"That," he said, "pertains to the first great war between Immortals and Demons."

"The conflict between them is endless, but there have been three great wars. In the beginning, the Wood Virtue paths largely resided within the demonic Dao. They were severed during that first great war. Two True Monarchs, Gathering Wood and Renewing Wood, perished together. For a long age, the path was withered and could not prosper. Later, due to a schism in the Daoist Tradition, only the Horn and Upright Wood paths of the righteous Wood Virtue ever truly flourished."

"The flashpoint for that entire war," he said, lowering his voice, "was the Severing Nurture Calamity."

"There was a branch of Wood Virtue known as 'Protecting Wood'. At the time, it was not prominent, yet it was lorded over by a Demonic Ancestor Immortal titled Zixuan. His power was monstrous, second only to the Three Profoundities. He is the one who unleashed the Severing Nurture Calamity upon the Immortal Dao. In doing so, he gravely offended the heavens and fled the world. The 'Protecting Wood' Fruition Attainment was catastrophically suppressed, and it has never risen again."

Daoist Master Shanbai looked down.

"This is all just hearsay, mind you. A story to pass the time. This Severing Nurture Calamity... it's terrifying, and yet it did not harm a single person. But to call it insidious... it is perhaps the most insidious act in all of history."

Li Ximing's brow furrowed deeply.

"How insidious?"

A bitter expression crossed Daoist Master Shanbai's face.

"With the Three Profoundities gone, this Demonic Ancestor's Dao-Profundity was supreme. Drawing on his authority as lord of 'Protecting Wood' and his mastery of 'Exiled Qi', he wagered the sum total of his entire Dao lineage, his life-mandate, and his Rank Designation as collateral. With this, he 'borrowed' one thing from Heaven and Earth, which he then secretly severed and concealed."

Li Ximing asked, "What thing?"

"Lifespan."

Daoist Master Shanbai sighed.

"The lifespan of all living beings."

Li Ximing stared at him. It was Daoist Master Xiang Chun who spoke, her own eyes downcast.

"In that age, mortals lived to one hundred and twenty. Shamans lived four hundred years. Those with divine abilities lived eight hundred. Traces of this remain; ancient texts still speak of mortals living a century. But the reality now is decline at fifty, exhaustion at sixty, and death at seventy."

This left Li Ximing stunned into silence. A long moment passed before he finally breathed, "How... _vicious_."

"If he were not, how could he be known as one of the four great founders of the demonic path?" Daoist Master Shanbai said with a bitter smile.

"The Lifeless Marshland he established is recorded in the darkest scriptures. Though it is counted alongside the Wuguan Legacy, the Profound Crimson Demonic Legacy, and the Dao of Enduring Malice, it is by far the most stable and powerful of the True Demonic Daos."

"And as long as the Lifeless Marshland stands, the 'Protecting Wood' path can never reclaim its true name, nor can it ever be liberated or verified by another."

The old Daoist Master clearly had access to obscure records, as he understood the Wood Virtue of that era well.

"Even after that Demonic Ancestor verified his Dao and departed this world, the Lifeless Marshland remained, hidden and guarded by his disciple, the Demon Monarch Zheli. A few other powerful figures, holding to old loyalties or agreeing with the Ancestor's philosophy, supported him. The True Monarchs eventually fought a great battle over it, and several fell."

"But that Demon Monarch remained concealed within the Lifeless Marshland, manipulating events from the shadows, stirring up one bloody calamity after another. His hand was even present in the final, cataclysmic battle of Pingming Jin... a battle that shattered the very heavens. Only then was the slate considered 'wiped clean'..."

Hearing him use the phrase "wiped clean," Daoist Master Xiang Chun quietly raised an eyebrow.

"If the slate were truly clean," she said coolly, "then our lifespans would have been returned."

Li Ximing froze, and a chill of horror crept up his spine.

"So... 'Demon Monarch' isn't just a casual title. In that case, the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch..."

At this, Daoist Master Shanbai instantly clamped his mouth shut, saying no more.

Daoist Master Xiang Chun, however, merely sighed and spoke frankly.

"The Lesser Yang Demon Monarch is a disciple of the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect and a figure from the Dao of Enduring Malice. He has no ties to the Lifeless Marshland. He is, of course, a Demon Monarch who falls under the jurisdiction of our Comprehending Profoundity Great Dao."

The moment she said this, Daoist Master Shanbai became visibly flustered. The old man wiped his forehead.

"I'll go and prepare those spiritual items right now!" he interrupted, beating a hasty retreat.

The woman watched him go, a cold smile lingering on her lips.

"What is there to be so afraid of saying? The Wuguan Legacy is on Mount Encompassing Profoundity, and do people not flock to it just the same? The Profound Crimson Demonic Legacy is within the Azure Profoundity, and it, too, is circulated. The Three Profoundities are the True Origin Great Dao; they are all-encompassing. Even the demonic path has a place within them. No one has ever denied this!"

Li Ximing felt an internal chill.

'She's right. The Wuguan Legacy is indeed bound to Mount Encompassing Profoundity.'

Thinking on it, he realized he had never once met a 'Protecting Wood' cultivator. And yet, he himself possessed a 'Protecting Wood' Spiritual Treasure—the Heavenly Nurture Urn he had acquired not long ago.

The inscription on the bottom of that urn read: My Spirit Resides in the Marsh.

'No wonder the Grand Sacrifice technique felt nothing like a righteous art, with its methods for harvesting blood qi and imprisoning divine abilities... It was a demonic artifact from the very beginning.'

'Emperor Song mentioned at the time that the path was incomplete and that its Dao lineage was "filthy." There must have been immense turmoil after... This war between Immortals and Demons, the one that reshaped the entire world... what was it truly about?'

'Was it order? Fruition Attainment? Or was it Yin and Yang... the Five Virtues and the Twelve Qis?'
