# Chapter 832: The Pine Snow Inquiry

The passage was brief. There was no mention of a transfer before it, nor any explanation after. It was just a short note inserted at the end of the letter, completely without context.

Yet this simple account of a great snow caused Li Jiangqian to hold the letter in stunned silence for a long time. He met the old man’s gaze and said in a low voice, “It’s snowing in Yi Mountain City.”

Yi Mountain City was deep in the Southern Borderlands. Snow was unheard of; the city was like summer all year round, and even a frost was a rare event. When Li Xuanxuan heard this, he was momentarily taken aback, but understanding dawned quickly, and a look of shock crossed his face. “It must be Fairy Ning…”

Another family might not have guessed the secret, but the Ning family’s Daoist Master Yuansu had entrusted his legacy to Li Xuanfeng before his death. The Ning clan had once tied its fate to Li Xuanfeng, so the Li family knew a great deal. They immediately understood this referred to Fairy Autumnlake, Ning Wan, who was in seclusion in Yi Mountain City, attempting her breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm.

She was not only the former master of Moonview Peak and Moongaze Lake’s earliest direct superior, but also someone the Li family had known since their humble beginnings. She was an acquaintance of both Sword Immortal Li Chejing and Li Tongya, the Celestial Moon Sword… Furthermore, she cultivated ‘Cold Qi,’ a path similar to Li Xijun’s. The telltale sign of this Dao was the scent of pine and a great, blanketing snow.

“No wonder they summoned him back in such a rush… and no wonder they said it was a matter of incredible importance. This truly is a world-shaking event…”

But a phenomenon was just a phenomenon. Whether it heralded success or failure, a great snow was inevitable. When Li Ximing had his breakthrough, the sky above Moongaze Lake had brightened, yet Azure Pond still assumed he had perished. Li Xuanxuan murmured to himself for a moment before shaking his head.

“Let’s just hope the spirit of Daoist Master Yuansu is watching over her. The Fairy must succeed!”

Li Jiangqian was of a younger generation. By the time he was old enough to understand such things, Ning Wan had already entered seclusion, and she wasn't mentioned specifically in the clan’s histories. He was unfamiliar with Fairy Autumnlake and fell into silent contemplation at the old man’s words.

The old man’s eyes were filled with reminiscence as he shook his head.

“Back then, my second uncle and Wan Yuankai drove a carriage out from the lake, leaving Moongaze Lake for the first time. They met Senior Xiao Yongling, and it was from him they first heard the great name of Fairy Autumnlake… She was already at the eighth level of Qi Refining then, and the number one beauty of the Azure Pond Sect. If she can reach the Purple Mansion Realm now, it would be a truly celebrated tale.”

Li Jiangqian thought for a moment. “In your esteemed opinion, what are Fairy Ning’s chances?”

Li Xuanxuan considered this. “I’d say they’re very high! I heard Daoist Master Yuansu personally chose her cultivation method, and the resources she received were his life’s savings. She even has a Purple Mansion spiritual item of Cold Qi!”

Though Li Xuanxuan was only at the Qi Refining stage, his brothers and his descendants were all exceptional figures. The old man knew a great deal and was quite shrewd. He lowered his voice.

“Yuansu was one of the Three Yuans of Azure Pond, but he was different from Daoist Master Yuanxiu and Yuanwu. His status was likely on par with Chi Wei… both were close friends of the heir to the Immortal Mansion. If his Dao lineage hadn’t been broken, it’s hard to say who would be leading Azure Pond these days.”

“Think of the benefits Chi Wei, Zipei, and that one from Golden Feather received back then. How could Daoist Master Yuansu have any less? His mount was a Three-Eyed Chaoshan Beast. If it weren't for that ruthless, fearless madman Situ Tang, that spirit beast would have lived to become a Purple Mansion expert itself.”

“If you sold off my entire Li family, would it even be worth one of that beast’s eyes? Do you really think the only thing he had was that Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal? How could he not have other treasures?”

“When you look at it that way, Fairy Ning’s breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm is, if not a certainty, at least seventy or eighty percent likely.”

This was a real eye-opener for Li Jiangqian. He nodded slowly. “It seems this is most likely a good thing.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded back. “This old man won’t speak in absolutes, but it is indeed good news. After all, *that* one is getting old, as all the cultivators know. This is a cataclysmic event. If, in the future, our backer is Fairy Ning…”

Although Daoist Master Yuanxiu was the youngest of the Three Yuans, his lifespan was nearing its end. He was also a difficult character who had always harbored ambitions of pulling the Li family into Azure Pond Sect. If Ning Wan were to lead Azure Pond Sect, things would be much easier. Li Jiangqian understood completely. “I suppose it’s too late to head to Yi Mountain City now. With Li Quantao rushing back so quickly, there’s much to ponder.”

Li Xuanxuan replied, “Ning Heyuan died in the north, and the spiritual artifact was lost. To this day, there’s still no news of the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal. That’s a Dharma Treasure! An ancient spiritual artifact! And since *that one* was already the prime suspect, he certainly has a lot to think about.”

Having concluded their discussion, both agreed it was good news. Li Xuanxuan put the letter away and said, “I don’t know how your arrangements in Jiangbei are proceeding, but this idle old man heard a piece of news. A sword cultivator has appeared in the Wu State, quite famous, with the surname Xu.”

Though Li Jiangqian was swamped with duties, his Foundation Establishment Realm mind processed the information instantly. He pulled a letter from the pile on his desk as he spoke.

“You are correct, my lord. I’ve received news as well. First, Sword Immortal Youfu of the Northern Sea has achieved the Purple Mansion Realm and established a sect in the Feather-Shedding Land, calling it the Northern Mansion Sword Dao…”

He paused, his expression turning serious. “The crucial point is… this man is not only a sword immortal, but a Daoist Master of the Supreme Yang Dao.”

Li Xuanxuan’s heart skipped a beat. He nodded silently. Although Jiangnan was called the heartland of the Supreme Yang Dao, it had few such cultivators and not a single Daoist Master. No one knew how powerful they truly were. As for the Supreme Yin Dao, only the Chunyi Dao Gate was of any consequence. Li Jiangqian continued.

“The other matter is this Daoist Xu. He killed a cultivator from Mount Changhuai and fled deep into the Southern Borderlands. This is the first time such a thing has happened in our era.”

Mount Changhuai’s authority in the Wu State was absolute. To kill one of their people and escape meant this was no ordinary person. Li Jiangqian shook his head. “With the great one’s arrival imminent, these sorts of incidents will naturally increase. There are two or three others, but none as brazen as this Daoist Xu. He is also a master of sword techniques, with exceptional combat prowess.”

Li Xuanxuan said softly, “That’s the truth of it. Although the great one’s chariot will land in Jiangbei, there are many cultivators on both sides of the river. If chaos breaks out, it will be a huge problem. Don’t forget the lesson of Xu Xiao.”

“This junior has been taught.”

Li Jiangqian knew the old man was using the story of Daoist Xu as a warning. He nodded in acknowledgment and saw him out.

Yi Mountain City.

Yi Mountain City was the foremost city of the Southern Borderlands, standing guard over Mount Lingqiu on the border of Azure Pond Sect’s territory. Beyond it, the land stretched south into an endless sea of jungle. The Southern Borderlands tended southwest, with North Dan Island and the Ten Thousand Mile Shitang lying to the east along the coast.

If one continued southwest, passing through the dense forests and the ruins of ancient Southern Yue, one would reach the nations of Shahuan and Piao, and even the more distant lands of Meng and Shendu. All of these were considered within the bounds of the countless Demon Ranges deep in the Southern Borderlands.

Although humans were widespread, the traditionally recognized territory of the Xia descendants ended at Yi Mountain City. The rest were considered barbarians. The old state of Chu had been looked down upon by the Central Plains; those outside the city were the barbarians of barbarians, not even worthy of scorn.

This great city, which divided civilization from the wilds, had been named in the ancient texts of the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion. When they first forged the city, it was wreathed in heavenly flames. The fire clouds only dissipated after the spiritual mines of Mount Lingqiu were exhausted, but the area remained rich in spiritual energy and was largely isolated from the atmospheric influences of other regions.

Yet this ancient city, which had not seen snow in centuries, was now draped in a thick white blanket. The snow was deep enough to bury a person, packing the streets solid. Countless cultivators stood on the rooftops that poked through the snow, gazing at the vast, white sky.

‘What a snowstorm…’

After generations of cultivation by the Ning clan, nearly everyone in Yi Mountain City bore the name Ning. Faced with this celestial phenomenon, the cultivators naturally understood its significance. They dared not clear away the snow, watching the heavens with anxious hearts.

In the highest grand hall, a woman in plain clothes sat upon a high seat. She appeared to be middle-aged. Below her stood a man in full armor, his face fierce and forbidding. He was clearly not someone to be trifled with.

“Mother, the snow is letting up.”

Li Yuanqin stood at the entrance of the hall, watching the falling flakes. Ning Hemian rose from her seat. In contrast to her son’s composure, she was visibly agitated. She strode out of the hall and said gravely, “Let us go greet the Daoist Master together!”

Whether Ning Wan had succeeded or not, this was a journey they had to make.

Mother and son arrived at the outer chamber of a deep cave dwelling. The gate was already thick with frost. The stone statue of the Three-Eyed Chaoshan Beast still crouched before the entrance, its form painted white by the accumulated snow. Only its three eyes stared out with a ghostly light.

Ning Hemian reached out and pressed the statue’s long horn. The mechanism, once impossibly rigid, had loosened. With a gentle turn, the frost-covered gate rumbled open. A dense wave of frigid, frosty Qi erupted from the gap, flowing out like a river of pure white.

Li Yuanqin felt a chill seep into his bones. Both mother and son were now in the Foundation Establishment Realm, but they still felt a deep fear before such intense cold. They waited for the thickest part of the blast to pass before pushing the gate fully open and stepping inside.

Daoist Master Yuansu had sealed the grotto’s array. He had personally designed, modified, and empowered it with his own abilities, making it completely different from the original. Inside, he had placed a lamp of Blazing Fire. Only when this dharma lamp was extinguished by the invading cold Qi would the sealed array open.

The design was ingenious, solving nearly every potential problem. Even a traitor from within the Ning family could not interfere. As long as the Cold Qi surged within the grotto, entry was possible. If Ning Wan emerged, all was well. If she had perished, the Ning family could still enter to collect her remains.

Li Yuanqin braved the biting Cold Qi and entered. The first thing he saw was a jade lamp on a table by the inner door, long since extinguished, leaving the grotto lit only by a dim, yellow glow.

This was Ning Tiaoxiao’s cultivation chamber. The jade platform, perpetually soaked in spiritual energy, stood silently in the gloom. The walls shimmered faintly with an eerie light. Li Yuanqin took a closer look and felt a chill crawl up his spine.

The stone walls flickered with a dark luminescence, as if many people were standing within them, looking out. Sweat beaded on the back of his neck. Ning Hemian pulled him back gently and whispered, “This is a Daoist Master's cultivation place. See little, hear little.”

Li Yuanqin lowered his head. Ning Wan’s seclusion chamber was on the other side of the grotto, only a dozen steps away. He took a single step forward, only to hear his mother drop to her knees with a thud. She spoke with the utmost reverence.

“Greetings, Daoist Master!”

He snapped his head up. The jade platform, which had been empty a moment ago, now held a woman in a white dress.

She was tall with eyes that curved like crescent moons and long black hair that cascaded down her back. A single, vertical white mark adorned her brow. Her features were gentle and soft, but her eyes held a cool detachment that made it impossible to look away.

The woman appeared to be no more than twenty years old. Her sleeves were embroidered with golden patterns, and she sat quietly on the edge of the jade platform, her fair legs dangling over the side, her bare feet resting upon a bank of pristine white mist.

The entire grotto was suddenly filled with the scent of pine.

Li Yuanqin quickly stepped back and knelt behind his mother, listening to the Fairy's cold voice.

“Hemian, where is Li Xuanfeng?”

Ning Wan did not ask about Ning Tiaoxiao, as if she had long known the elder’s fate. Though this was the day she attained her great power, her gaze held a deep sorrow as she looked around the empty grotto. Ning Hemian replied respectfully, “During the North-South War, my husband died fighting to stop the southward advance of the Buddhist cultivators.”

A shadow passed over Ning Wan’s eyes. “That sounds like something he would do.”

She spoke again. “Has Chi Zhiyun emerged from seclusion yet? He was always so competitive, always trying to be one step ahead of me. Looks like he’s fallen behind this time.”

Ning Hemian answered deferentially, “Reporting to the Daoist Master, Chi Zhiyun has already perished. The Chi family’s direct line is severed. There are no longer any cultivators named Chi in Azure Pond.”

For the first time, Ning Wan’s composure broke. After listening to their account of all that had transpired, she fell into a long silence, a look of loneliness in her eyes. “A pity. He was quite a character.”

She made a quick calculation in her mind, and her expression grew solemn. “Heyuan fell. Where is the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal!”

“Its whereabouts are unknown…”

Ning Wan clenched her jaw and let out a cold snort. “How unsightly.”

The Daoist Master stepped down from the jade platform as if walking on air. She turned to face the eerily glowing stone wall behind her and called out, “Who goes there?”

One by one, faces began to emerge from the stone, some clear, some blurry. But Ning Wan ignored them, her gaze fixed on a distant corner of the wall. Soon, the apparitions faded. She seemed to be calculating something. After a moment, she thought to herself:

‘Nineteen… two are missing… The Great One said that when a face fades, it means they are seeking Fruition Attainment. Besides Senior Zipei, there’s one other. Since no one has been heard to achieve the rank of True Monarch, they must have been reincarnated through a Metallic Essence.’

‘Coincidentally, three streams of Metallic Essence have separated from Anhuai Heaven. One of them should correspond to ‘True Qi.’ Looking at the position… it’s the one from Mount Changhuai. They’re making a play for the position of ‘True Qi.’’

She pursed her lips, lost in thought for a long while, then lightly tapped the jade platform. The platform trembled and split down the middle, revealing a box containing twenty-eight small, white flags.

The woman beckoned gently, and the twenty-eight flags flew up together, circling her palm. A faint smile touched Ning Wan’s lips as she stepped forward. The entire grotto array began to shake, and countless points of white light flared. From the Great Void, a massive, table-sized array disk covered in profound patterns emerged.

Setting up a Purple Mansion array was always a complicated affair. Even with a pre-made array disk, deployment and retrieval were troublesome. Yet for Ning Wan, it seemed as simple as taking a tool out of storage.

“Let’s go. We’ll pay a visit to Senior Yuanxiu.”

The Fairy of Autumnlake rose into the air, borne upon the endless falling snow. Standing below, Ning Hemian was suddenly struck by a belated realization:

‘The Daoist Master was called Fairy Autumnlake back then, and not just for her cultivation level… Her talent in the dao of arrays was something even Daoist Master Chi Wei, Daoist Master Yuanxiu, and the others had praised…’
