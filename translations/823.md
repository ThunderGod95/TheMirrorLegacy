# Chapter 823: The Imperial Command

Li Zhouwei let out a heavy breath and replied, "I understand."

The Dragon-kin hadn't sent him to the Lie Sea merely for a family reunion. The words Li Qinghong spoke were likely the Dragon-kin's true intention. The importance of that True Qi was so high that the Beihai Sea Dragon King had reminded her repeatedly, ensuring Li Qinghong explained the situation to him personally.

"This Bright Yang is one scheme, and that True Qi is another. They are likely afraid my Li family will get entangled, causing the two plots to intersect and interfere with the Dragon-kin's plan to secure the True Qi."

Li Zhouwei understood the stakes clearly.

'The Bright Yang matter is hardly about old sentiments; it's mostly about preventing the Luoxia faction from acquiring it. But compared to the pursuit of the True Dragons, everything else must be pushed aside. Once this matter is involved, forget a Wei-Li descendant—even one of their own Dragon-kin would be killed without hesitation. This trip... this is a warning, delivered by the Beihai Sea and Admirable Sea factions within the Dragon-kin.'

Li Qinghong studied his expression as she sipped her tea. "You must not touch the True Qi. The family simply needs to wait quietly for your breakthrough."

She seemed to recall something, the words hesitating on her lips before she finally lowered her gaze.

"It truly is a pity... about Li Chenghui."

Li Zhouwei fell silent, unsure how to respond. A long moment passed before he spoke. "My uncle and I defended the river for sixteen years, vigilant day and night, often feeling we were nearing the end of our path. I had it slightly easier. Uncle slept on his spear, waiting for the dawn. I fear that the moment the anomaly at Mount Wu first appeared, his death was already imminent."

"To have survived all those days... only to fall here."

Among the Chengming generation, Li Chenghui and Li Qinghong had been the closest. They had trained together at the Ancestral Spring, and because of their shared Dao Heritage, Li Chenghui often sought her guidance. His sudden death must surely be the most painful for her.

Li Qinghong remained quiet for a time before saying, "Back then, I always thought he was the most promising of the Chengming generation, and the most cautious. I believed he could carry the weight of the Great Liang. He truly did not disappoint."

The atmosphere immediately grew heavy. Li Zhouwei, wishing to change the subject, clasped his hands.

"Senior, when this junior was passing through Crimson Reef Island, I witnessed quite a commotion. Two groups of cultivators were fighting fiercely. There were people from Thunder-Hearing Island and Crimson Reef Island present. I had heard that Crimson Reef Island is usually deserted... What is...?"

Li Qinghong pondered this briefly. "It must be related to the Crimson Reef Dragon King. He emerged from seclusion, becoming another late-stage Purple Mansion Realm Dragon King. Perhaps he intends to construct his Dragon Palace soon and will host a celebratory banquet... They came for that?"

Li Zhouwei was still perplexed but nodded. "But I only saw people from those two families... Perhaps their information network is just faster..."

Li Qinghong thought carefully, then mused, "Your words remind me of something. The Crimson Reef Dragon King is of the Black Dragon Ancestral Line. Thunder-Hearing Island once assisted the Black Dragon Ancestral Line... If the Crimson Reef Dragon King is celebrating, it's reasonable for Thunder-Hearing Island to arrive in force. As for Crimson Reef Island... that is harder to say."

Understanding dawned on Li Zhouwei. He spoke in a solemn tone, "In that case, my family is allied with the White Dragon Ancestral Line. It is probably best we avoid contact with this Crimson Reef Island, lest we be given trouble. They are Dragon-kin, after all. If they truly decided to make an issue of it, my family could not withstand the pressure."

Li Qinghong inclined her head. "While that reasoning is sound, the Dragon-kin have a singular objective and are unshakeably united on this front. They won't make things too difficult for you right now. Just stay away from Crimson Reef Island. Don't make things awkward for them."

Li Zhouwei acknowledged her words just as the white-robed female attendant hurried back into the pavilion, bowing respectfully.

"Mistress of the Pool, the Deepwater Attendants examining the Dharma artifact have replied. This artifact can harmonize the Mansion Water. By tempering it with the Spiritwater of the Harmonious Abyss, the Pristine Water within can be transformed and consolidated. By adding another layer of Harmonizing Metal to balance the mansion, it can be refined into a Blue-Gold Gourd. It will be an inch larger than its current form, and the method of wielding it will change from grasping to holding, or wearing at the waist. It will gain two new wondrous abilities, including summoning water to suppress enemies..."

These underwater Demon beasts provided an exhaustive description. Li Qinghong listened distractedly. When the attendant finished, she glanced at Li Zhouwei.

"Minghuang. What is your assessment?"

Li Zhouwei made a quick estimation. The original green gourd had been inferior to the Deng Clan's fan. This upgrade had both gains and losses but was certainly a significant improvement. Although it still couldn't compare to the fan, he replied, "It is already excellent."

Li Qinghong nodded and turned to the attendant, whose name was Yuanzi. "How long will it take?"

Yuanzi bowed. "At least six months. We estimate between half a year and nine months."

The woman's gaze turned back to him. Li Zhouwei had no other pressing plans; cultivation was cultivation, regardless of the location. Besides, he had many secret arts he needed to practice. He nodded. "That poses no problem. I was just looking for a place to enter seclusion. Is it convenient here in the Lie Sea?"

Li Qinghong considered this. "The thunder within the pool is far too potent and tyrannical; it is naturally unsuitable for Minghuang's cultivation. There aren't many cultivation spots in the Lie Sea below. At best, there is Sea Otter Mountain, but the Spiritual Essence there is inferior even to the mainland. I am afraid Zhouwei will be inconvenienced."

The outer seas were barren, far worse than the Eastern Sea, let alone Jiangnan. Li Zhouwei naturally understood this. After they exchanged a few more pleasantries, Li Qinghong concluded, "I will have Yuanzi escort you down."

Li Zhouwei bowed, letting out a long sigh of relief. "Now that I have met with you, Senior, I can finally send word back to the family."

Li Qinghong smiled and returned the gesture. He followed the white-robed female attendant out, heading back toward the sea. The chariot they had arrived in was waiting by the pool's edge, the surroundings still utterly empty. Yuanzi respectfully invited him to board without any unnecessary words.

Li Qinghong's palace had few attendants, and they all seemed to share her temperament: concise and elegantly efficient. The chariot plunged toward the sea. Sea Otter Mountain came into view, revealing itself to be extremely simple. Although there were temples and abbeys on the mountain, the buildings were orderly and built low to the ground, with modest front and back courtyards. A few Daoists were burning incense, deep in quiet prayer as they cultivated thunder arts.

But as the chariot broke through the cloud layer, the tranquility below instantly shattered. A visible panic spread through the inhabitants. A group of Daoists quickly gathered below the Ritual Altar on the mountain peak. Looking down, Li Zhouwei saw a swaying sea of black Daoist kerchiefs.

*RUMBLE!*

The chariot landed atop the Ritual Altar with a deafening, thunder-like roar, sending ripples of silver light pulsing outward. A man at the head of the group below shouted:

"The Firmament Cloud Abbey, representing the fourteen Dao Heritages of the Second Celestial Thunder, respectfully welcomes the High Celestial Thunder Emissary! We receive the thunder command and uphold the Immortal Decree!"

The assembled Daoists bowed as one. From the sides, the sounds of ritual flutes and zithers rose. From the front of the chariot, Yuanzi's clear voice announced:

"We carry no formal edict, only an advisory directive."

"The White Qilin of the Path of the Bright Yang is visiting the Thunder Pool and will be resting on Sea Otter Mountain. I am under orders to accompany His Excellency in selecting a cultivation site. There is no need for this mobilization, but you absolutely must not show any neglect."

"This lowly cultivator obeys."

Li Zhouwei felt the chariot tremble slightly as Yuanzi pulled back the curtain for him, bowing respectfully. "Your Excellency, please!"

He stepped out onto the Ritual Altar. It was forged from silvery-white metal. The Daoists below remained with their heads bowed low. Only the leader, an old Daoist, stepped forward, stopping one step below the platform to bow deeply. "We pay respects to the Aspect of the Bright Yang. For Your Excellency to choose this small mountain to tread upon blesses our Dao lineage. This lowly cultivator is overwhelmed by this honor, extremely grateful."

Yuanzi, terrified the locals would offend their guest, stuck close to him, whispering an explanation: "Your Excellency, when the Eastern Sea's waters receded and the thunder rose, the Thunder Pool descended upon the world. The Firmament Cloud Abbey sensed their Dao Heritage and followed it here all the way from the Northern Sea. Their heritage originates from ancient cultivators. If their speech causes offense, please..."

She was attempting to smooth things over, but inwardly she trembled. 'That old man Lu must have a death wish! This is the White Qilin. Although he is polite while visiting the Thunder Pool, the Bright Yang Aspect prizes hierarchy above all else. He didn't even kowtow, and he's spouting nonsense about blessing the Dao lineage...'

Li Zhouwei, however, found this very interesting. He swept his gaze over the crowd, noticing that most of the Firmament Cloud Abbey's adherents were mortals. There were only a sparse few at the Embyronic Breathing stage, and the old Daoist before him was merely at Qi Refining. What a thoroughly miserable state!

"Please rise."

He responded, raising an eyebrow. "Is this ancient etiquette... or the rules of thunder cultivation?"

Sweat immediately beaded on the old Daoist's forehead. "Your Excellency, only one rule has been passed down through our heritage. We do not know if it is etiquette or thunder law. This small mountain is crude and cannot fulfill the requirements of the rites. It is this lowly cultivator's sin."

Li Zhouwei gave the man a thoughtful look. It seemed these ancient cultivation rules were rather different than he had imagined. He activated his brilliant Profound Light and descended from the Ritual Altar.

Although Li Zhouwei was not a true White Qilin, his Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation, amplified by his destiny, made him appear as nothing less than divine to this crowd of mortals. They stared in mingled awe and envy.

Yuanzi accompanied him into the abbey, quietly adding details. "Although these cultivators are weak, their Dao Heritage has deep roots connecting them to the Profound Firmament Thunder Pool and the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring. There is also a Xi Clan in the Northern Sea that sent a disciple here to cultivate. He is currently in seclusion, attempting to break through to Qi Refining."

"I have heard of them."

Li Zhouwei knew of that Xi Clan member, Xi Zikang. He had been an upright man. Unfortunately, he had almost certainly perished within that Grotto-Heaven along with the others. Li Zhouwei could only sigh internally.

'The Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring... just from that name alone, it is clearly something the Dragon-kin are determined to possess. To guide thunder and anchor clouds—that should inherently be the role of a dragon.'

---

They soon arrived at the deepest cultivation abode within the Firmament Cloud Abbey. It was exactly as Li Qinghong had said: not only was the spiritual energy inferior to the lake above, but the space itself was incredibly cramped.

If an abode had been opened by a cultivator from the inner seas, it would at least be the size of a courtyard. This one, however, was barely the size of a single room. It contained only one table, one chair, and one meditation cushion. Yet the old Daoist clearly cherished the place; the entrance was neatly lined with soft mats.

The old Daoist bowed low beside the entrance as Yuanzi activated the formation array for him. "Your Excellency... please. When there is news regarding the Dharma artifact, I will come up the mountain to retrieve you."

Li Zhouwei nodded and stepped inside. The great door sealed shut automatically, and the Dharma Lamps within the abode lit up, brightly illuminating the confined space. He sat in place for a short while, organizing all the recent information until his mind gradually cleared.

He settled onto the meditation cushion. Nine secret arts—each one vast as the sea, yet concise and profoundly potent—surged forth from his spiritual sense. These were the nine secret arts of the Radiant Essence Scripture!

These arts were exceptionally precious. Li Zhouwei had no need to carry transcribed copies to study; the knowledge had been directly bestowed upon him when he received the Talisman Seed. Preparing to begin his cultivation, he followed the experiential records left behind by Li Ximing and first isolated the art known as **Primal Yang** to read.

"The origin of Bright Yang, the aspect of the Yang axis manifests. Every step adheres to the rules; every glance matches the rite. To sing is to harmonize the pitch pipes; to move is to regulate the hierarchy of status; to tread is to not step upon the land of a state without a Monarch; to stop is to not roost in the domains of feudal lords..."

Li Zhouwei read it through once, nodding slightly. 'Reasonably easy to understand...'

He suddenly remembered something. Rummaging through his storage pouch, he retrieved a jade slip. This was something Li Ximing had given him. It appeared to be annotations for this secret art—it contained only the commentary, not the original text.

Li Zhouwei read the preface first and saw the signature:

【Daoist Master Gufeng】

'Oh. A fitting pen name for a Daoist Master. He must have drawn inspiration from the Talisman Qi.'

He proceeded to read the lengthy hundred-thousand-word text, but his brows furrowed, and he shook his head in thought.

'This thing is verb... cough... it doesn't suit me. This must have been prepared for the younger generations of the family. It's not of much use to me.'

'However, this scroll speculates that the cultivation difficulty is not the same for everyone. Although the nine secret arts ascend sequentially, based on an individual's specific temperament and talent, the difficulty of mastering each of the arts varies...'

He put the slip away. Instead of immediately beginning Primal Yang, he read through the other eight arts and briefly tested each one.

Within his Sea of Qi, flickers of golden light appeared, sometimes white, sometimes gold. One moment they formed a lamp, the next they formed steps, then transformed again into a vast palace complex or a million elite soldiers, flashing unstably. Time flowed past like water.

More than half a month later, Li Zhouwei slowly opened his eyes, exhaling a plume of white mist. Although the abode's lamps were bright, his eyes were far more dazzling, faintly flowing with a golden Profound Light.

His expression, however, was far from calm. Doubt surged in his heart, mixed with profound astonishment.

'These nine secret arts... I've already cultivated a significant portion of them!'

He had tested them all, using the secret arts to stimulate his Immortal Foundation and observe the changes. Edict Glyphs materialized upon the foundation, faint but distinct, as golden lines and white light flowed across its surface. This was unmistakably the sign of having mastered the **Imperial Command**—one of the nine arts!

And this Imperial Command was supposed to be, by far, the most difficult of the nine!

'It certainly wasn't the cultivation method's influence... Daoist Master Gufeng practiced for so many years before his breakthrough, and he always had to start from scratch. Then... it must be the influence of my destiny.'

Yet, after testing all nine arts, he found it was far more than just that. The nine arts were: Primal Yang, Heavenly Lamp, Jewel Steps, Great Fissure, the Art of Returning Fold, Myriad Arms Prefecture, Imperial Command, Golden Qilin, and Red Cicada.

Of these, Imperial Command was already at Grand Completion. Great Fissure was 50% mastered, and Myriad Arms Prefecture was 30% mastered!

Li Zhouwei was simultaneously shocked and overjoyed, but this was immediately followed by deep confusion. "Why these three?"

Although his current cultivation level wasn't high, destiny clung to him, and his discussions with the Dragon-kin had yielded an immense amount of valuable information. He already had a theory.

"The Yang Axis bears two children: one is the White Qilin, the second is the White Cicada. But at the time of my birth, the White Qilin delivered the child, and the White Cicada vibrated its wings. Both phenomena appeared simultaneously. This likely means I exist somewhere between the Qilin and the Cicada. As for how much relation this truly has to the Yang Axis itself, that requires a separate discussion..."

The Yang Axis was, after all, the primary aspect of the Bright Yang. Li Zhouwei didn't dare compare himself to it lightly. Furthermore, who knew how much influence the successive generations of the Wei-Li had exerted upon the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment over the ages? The Dragon-kin believed he was the White Qilin, and that assumption probably wasn't far from the truth.

"Regardless of my connection to the Yang Axis, mastering Imperial Command... likely corresponds directly to this destiny."

Mastering Imperial Command was understandable. But having 50% mastery of the Great Fissure and 30% of the Myriad Arms Prefecture was utterly baffling. If he had shown a slight mastery across all the techniques, that would be one thing. But arts like Primal Yang showed absolutely zero trace of cultivation.

"How strange... When did I ever cultivate these two arts? Or perhaps... was I simply born with them?"
