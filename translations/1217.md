# Chapter 1217: The Decision

Chuyi Heaven's renown was widespread. Yehui's entire collection of Spiritual Artifacts, Spiritual Treasures, and even his divine ability inheritance all originated from Chuyi Heaven; merely obtaining one of its legacies had been enough for him to look down upon all his peers in the Purple Mansion Realm.

'A divine ability inheritance, Spiritual Artifacts, and spiritual items.'

These three things, in the hands of a genius, could almost create a sect-founding patriarch at the Purple Mansion Realm. Yet, while Yehui's divine ability was profound and his arsenal of Spiritual Artifacts and Treasures was impressive, the flaw in his foundation remained. The crucial problem lay with the last of the three, the spiritual item:

'The spiritual item I obtained from Chuyi Heaven… was just that single Lesser Obscurity Capital Spirit needed to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm…'

His Dao lineage was brilliant, to be sure, but it had long since vanished. He appeared magnificent on the surface, but the various spiritual items he needed were nowhere near as easy to find as those for today's common lineages. Most were held by great powers or by other geniuses who had also emerged from grotto-heavens, making them anything but simple to acquire.

Even after relying on his own schemes to pledge allegiance to the north and then return to the south, he still had to bow his head time and again to the major powers for a particular spiritual qi or spiritual item. More importantly, this deference was, in a sense, a luxury—more often than not, they simply paid him no mind.

He could be said to have grown accustomed to this life. He did not fear the Li Clan making exorbitant demands; he feared that he possessed nothing they would actually want!

Seeing now that Li Jiangqian was interested in Chuyi Heaven, he knew his earlier judgment had been correct. He composed himself and spoke.

"If you are interested in Chuyi Heaven, Fellow Daoist, then we have something to discuss."

Li Jiangqian glanced at the Daoist Master before him, set down his cup, and said:

"What is the origin of this Chuyi Heaven?"

"I presume you have heard of the Four Southern Secrets, Fellow Daoist."

Yehui said thoughtfully:

"The history of Chuyi Heaven can be traced back to the Profound Immortal Township of the Encompassing Profoundity Immortal Lord Qingmei, which was the earliest Dao lineage of the Four Southern Secrets. This Immortal Lord was a master of Encompassing Profoundity pills and artifacts who left behind countless treasures, and the Encompassing Profoundity Mountain within Chuyi Heaven was where his disciples would select and store their Spiritual Artifacts."

Li Jiangqian nodded and said:

"Whether it is you, Senior, or that Changxiao, the Spiritual Treasures and Spiritual Artifacts in your possession are all of the highest quality; the world has long been abuzz with rumors… however,"

His attention was still fixed on another matter as he asked softly:

"The Wuguan Legacy, is there truly such a thing?"

Yehui took a sip of tea and said:

"There is."

Li Jiangqian's expression shifted slightly. He asked:

"Was he also a figure of the Encompassing Profoundity?"

Unexpectedly, the Daoist Master before him hesitated.

"It is difficult to say."

A flicker of complexity appeared in Yehui's eyes as he spoke softly:

"I have been to that grotto-heaven and thus know a few things. It is rumored that Wuguan went to the Eastern Sea back then to ask that Immortal Lord to refine a Dharma Treasure for him. To show his gratitude, he left a ray of clear light for the Immortal Lord, intending for it to help him raise up an Encompassing Profoundity disciple. But the Immortal Lord's followers were mediocre, so he used this item to forge the three-tiered Encompassing Profoundity Mountain, which has been favored by the legacy ever since."

"As for whether Wuguan was a figure of the Encompassing Profoundity,"

Yehui shook his head and said:

"I'm more inclined to believe he was an adept from Beyond the Profound who attained the Dao."

Li Jiangqian understood now. Feeling a stir of interest, he asked:

"How many can enter? Are there any conditions—can those of the Purple Mansion Realm go inside?"

This last question was undoubtedly the most critical. The Li family members possessed Talisman Seeds and could link with an Immortal Artifact to perform a Spirit Probe, which already allowed them to seize the advantage in such domains. The abilities of those at Foundation Establishment were limited; if their own Daoist Masters could enter, the benefits would be immeasurable!

Yehui understood his meaning. His expression shifted slightly as he said:

"In those days, Chuyi Heaven was a place for all Encompassing Profoundity cultivators to frequent. Entering this grotto-heaven… is not fundamentally difficult. Once the time is right, a Purple Mansion cultivator just has to search for it, and anyone who cultivates the ancient Immortal Dao of the Encompassing Profoundity path can enter."

"By absorbing qi and nurturing one's nature?"

"Correct."

Li Jiangqian frowned.

"Then how did you enter back then, Senior?"

Yehui's eyes dimmed as if recalling something, and he said:

"There is a clever workaround. The ancient cultivators sought wholeness in both life-mandate and nature. That being the case, one only needed to find a fated child who cultivates the Purple Gold Dao to act as a screen, and you could send people in. You could even bring others along."

"So that's how it was."

Li Jiangqian quickly understood the methods those ancient cultivators had used and fell into contemplation. Yehui continued:

"Of course… with this token in my hand and my personal assistance, there is no need to find some fated person. It would be no problem for you to send in three or four people as you please, Fellow Daoist…"

A subtle light flickered in his eyes as he spoke:

"Furthermore, by holding this token, one can sense the Profound Foundation Grand Array when leaving the grotto-heaven and exit in secret. I suspect… that Changxiao and the others used this very method to get out back then."

"As for the Purple Mansion Realm… everyone says they cannot enter that grotto-heaven. But in my opinion, strictly speaking, they can."

Li Jiangqian's expression flickered as he listened quietly. Yehui went on:

"Chuyi Heaven was originally a place for the younger generation to cultivate. In the eyes of the ancients, the Purple Mansion Realm was just barely touching upon the mystical; there was no reason they couldn't enter. In fact… it is rumored that during the Wei era, Purple Mansion cultivators of the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition even entered it."

"Later, some modern Purple Mansion cultivators tried to enter with this token. Wuzhu Gate tried, and some time ago, the Pang Clan of the Eastern Sea also gave it a try…"

He said grimly:

"Only… none of them ever came out. Both of those Purple Mansion cultivators perished. The Pang Clan was even displaced for a time, eventually finding shelter under the Chunyi Dao Gate by relying on old connections."

Li Jiangqian's expression grew solemn, and he nodded thoughtfully. Yehui, however, let out a cold laugh.

"It is not so strange, when you think about it. If Chuyi Heaven were truly a treasure trove devoid of any danger, why haven't any of the great lords of the north sent people over all these years? Presumably, they look down on what can be taken out, and what they covet cannot be taken out."

His words stopped abruptly there, a clear sign that he had his own suspicions. Li Jiangqian felt a slight apprehension. After a long moment of deliberation, he asked:

"And the time of its opening…?"

Yehui shrugged and replied:

"That is difficult to predict. The changes within are not precise, and it opening a few years early or late is quite common. When I attained my divine ability, Chuyi opened once. By my calculations, it will be at least another ten or twenty years…"

Li Jiangqian mulled it over and secretly nodded to himself.

'Although this place is troublesome and dangerous, the timing isn't bad. Whether it's Suihuan or Jiangchun, they can both try their luck then. By that time, Father will be at least a Great Daoist Master, a White Qilin with four divine abilities. If he stands before the gate to that grotto-heaven, who would dare make a sound?'

He narrowed his eyes slightly.

'Even if the timing is off, I can still send in people like Ding Weizeng or Gongsun Bofan. After all, the potential returns far outweigh the investment. If they could bring back even one or two Spiritual Treasures, it would be a massive gain.'

With that, he set down his cup and smiled.

"In that case, I will have to trouble you, Senior, to keep watch on my family's behalf. When there is news, you may come to the lake and inform me."

Seeing that the matter of the Yin-Leap Qi was still unresolved, Yehui's heart sank. Just as he was about to say more, he saw his highness touch his sleeve, and his expression changed in an instant.

'Something's happened to Chen Yin!'

Li Jiangqian had given Chen Yin a jade talisman, and that talisman had just been activated. The shock lasted only a moment before a strange look entered his eyes, and he stopped dead in his tracks.

Yehui, who stood nearby, was no ordinary man. He frowned and asked:

"Is there trouble on the lake? Do you need me to accompany you?"

Li Jiangqian shook his head, his gaze grave. The hand behind his back made a subtle gesture of divination, and he suddenly asked:

"Senior, are you versed in the arts of divination?"

Understanding, Yehui looked up and said:

"Please speak."

"This junior wishes to know if there is war in Yuyang."

Li Jiangqian had made this judgment because his sister's jade talisman had not reacted at all!

This caused him to hesitate for a split second, and his first reaction was one of suspicion.

'Could Chen Yin be trying to lure me into a trap?'

The thought flashed through his mind for an instant before his assessment of Chen Yin's loyalties led him to quickly dismiss it. Another possibility formed in his mind:

'Did Chen Yin sense something? Or… has something happened to the Chen Clan?'

But when it came to detecting anomalies, his own sister was certainly no less capable than Chen Yin. How could it be that this old cultivator of Mansion Water was aware of something, yet Li Que'wan, a master of divination, had sensed nothing?

'Then it must be that Western Shu has made a move in the south.'

An answer was beginning to form in his mind. Yehui had likewise reached a similar conclusion.

"That is not difficult."

He cultivated the Dao of the Capital Guard, observing mountains and watching over waters. While divining truth from falsehood might be difficult for him, determining whether a place was under attack fell squarely within his mystical abilities. With but a slight pause, purple water swirled in his hand, and he answered crisply:

"Your Highness's guess is correct."

A trace of surprise flashed in the Daoist Master's eyes, and he said in a low voice:

"They have chosen their time well. The Daoist Masters of Jianghuai must contend with the north and cannot move freely. Several of the Holders of the Profound have entered seclusion, and even the Grand General has resigned his post to cultivate. With the Great Song in a period of recovery, there are indeed few hands to spare."

"I would estimate that the only ones who can rush to support Fellow Daoist Chen Yin right now… are Ning Wan and the two Daoist Masters from the capital's Purple Smoke Gate."

After all, the vacancies left by the deaths of Liu Bai and Xianyao, and the grievous wounding of King Wei, were very real. The territory Jianghuai had gained was vast, and it required just as many divine abilities to garrison it!

More importantly, Li Jiangqian knew that Chen Yin was right there on his lake, and Tinglan, who had publicly volunteered to replace Liu Bai in guarding Jinghai, had in fact used it as a pretext to go to the Southern Sea to help his family refine an array disk. The only one who could truly go was Ning Wan!

'Qing Jifang… people often call him reckless and arrogant, but at least he understands the principle of taking drastic measures… This way, even if something happens to the Chen Clan, Chen Yin will have no recourse and will even be accused of deserting his post.'

Li Jiangqian sneered inwardly but said aloud:

"Senior, do you know how many divine abilities are clashing in Yuyang?"

Yehui shook his head with a sigh.

"Your Highness overestimates me. This is a conflict between two kingdoms, their fates intertwined. I was able to divine the presence of war partly because it is my duty, and partly because news of this has already spread… it just hasn't reached Jianghuai yet."

In that instant, the choice before Li Jiangqian became unclear.

'Will Chen Yin go, or will he stay… And I… do I go back, or not?'

This was a troublesome affair. Logically, Yuyang was protected by a Purple Mansion Grand Array, and Western Shu would not divert forces to attack it while campaigning in the north. But their commander was Qing Jifang; if he was seized by madness, he was certainly capable of such a thing!

'Even if it's just a bit of harassment, it would likely force Chen Yin to leave… and it would also draw the Great Song's attention southward… not a bad outcome for Qing Jifang.'

'If that's the case, could there be an ambush on Moongaze Lake, waiting for Chen Yin to leave before launching an attack?'

Li Jiangqian pondered for a moment and came to a conclusion:

'Impossible.'

'First, Western Shu does not have the forces to spare. Second, the moment Chen Yin was alerted, he would come to Gardenia Scenery Mountain to find me. The instant he moved, my sister would surely notice and use her Spirit Probe to observe the enemy. If there were an ambush outside the lake, her warning talisman would be glowing right now.'

'Since it is not, Moongaze Lake must be safe.'

His golden eyes glinted in the darkness. Yehui spoke quietly:

"Do you need me to make a trip with you? Be it to secure the lake or to reinforce the Chen Clan…"

Clearly, the Daoist Master had already guessed Chen Yin's whereabouts. By rights, Li Jiangqian really ought to go and help the Chen Clan.

The crimson-robed youth narrowed his eyes slightly and shook his head.

"There is no need to trouble you, Senior."

He had already made his calculations.

'Knowing Chen Yin, he will definitely head back. With Ning Wan, that makes two. In fact, there are two more Daoist Masters: Qinghu and Fu Chi, who occupy the former grounds of the Changxiao Gate!'

Western Shu's Great Daoist Masters were clearly in the north. If their goal was to make the Chen Clan pay a price, rushing over now with those four Daoist Masters would be enough to protect them. But if they had merely sent people to harass and probe, the Chen Clan's disciples would be in no great danger behind their Purple Mansion Grand Array, but the enemy would be difficult to catch!

'He knows that if he lingers, he will certainly be intercepted by us…'

The Capital Immortals Dao was simply too far from Yuyang. Without a technique for traversing the Great Void, he could not proactively control the situation. Li Jiangqian was naturally unwilling to undertake a mission that would likely end in futility, allowing the enemy to dictate the pace.

'My window of opportunity shrinks with each passing day; how can I afford to waste it?'

Western Shu had already pushed into Long territory, where several Great Daoist Masters were engaged. The outcome of that battle would be decided in a matter of days. True, if Western Shu won, they would inevitably continue their push north, perhaps leading to a stalemate that could buy him a few months, or even a year and a half. But what if Western Shu suffered a major defeat?

'Since it is said Wei Xuanyin has made his move, Western Shu's chances of victory are already extremely low. Situ Huo's disappearance is already bad enough; we cannot afford a single mistake.'

Once Western Shu's northern campaign came to a premature end, where else could Qing Jifang, returning in failure after setting out in high spirits, turn his gaze?

'If Wei Xuanyin truly attacks with all his might, assisted by the likes of Touba Qiye, the worst-case scenario is that Western Shu's three Great Daoist Masters suffer repeated defeats. If I am delayed by a protracted fight in Yuyang and get injured, then the lake will be in trouble.'

His gaze was calm as he took a jade talisman from his sleeve and said:
"Please take this, Senior. When the time comes, I will use this talisman to contact you. If you come to the lake then, I guarantee a reward that will satisfy you."

And so, he launched himself into the air, treading on fire as he flew into the Great Void and headed east without a shred of hesitation.

Yehui watched his receding figure, a thoughtful look on his face. He lowered his gaze to the jade cup, the light in his lively eyes shifting, and sighed to himself.

'Wei Xuanyin… what a shame. Had he been born in the era of the Three Profoundities' tripartite reign, he might have had a chance to achieve his ambitions by leveraging their power. But now… every house is struggling just to survive!'
