# Chapter 819: Tai'e

Li Zhouwei awoke from his deep meditation. Spiritual energy surged through his body like a roaring river, his aura stable, his cultivation base smooth and perfected. The light of his Immortal Foundation shone clear and bright.

'With the help of the White Dew Blood, I truly avoided significant harm this time,' he thought. 'But activating my Essence Blood is a serious matter. Even taking a spiritual item of this quality only managed to offset the cost and stabilize my cultivation base.'

This success was also due to Dongfang Heyun controlling the dosage perfectly. Bright Yang possesses properties that enhance fertility. While Dragon-kind are generally magnanimous, they prioritize their own Dragon heirs above all else, making them naturally miserly when it came to any spiritual item related to Bright Yang.

"Hooo..."

He exhaled a stream of white vapor and opened his eyes. The ethereal mists around him still drifted and billowed, making him feel as if he were lost in an infinite sea of clouds. All traces of the Crystal Palace had vanished. The Beihai Sea Dragon King was also gone; only the youth in white robes remained standing quietly at his side.

He didn't know how long he had been cultivating, but Dongfang Heyun's gaze seemed never to have moved from him. The moment Li Zhouwei stirred, the youth offered a thoughtful smile.

"One hundred and twenty-eight days have passed," Dongfang Heyun said. "According to the Li-Wei orthodox calendar... it is now the seventh month. If you are using the Liu-Chu orthodox calendar of the Yue State, it is the twenty-second day of the sixth month."

Li Zhouwei already knew that the Yue State followed the Liu-Chu calendar, which differed from the reckoning used by the Li Clan's Wei State. Yet Dongfang Heyun stated it so naturally, as if he had once lived in Wei and the conversion of dates was second nature to him. Li Zhouwei felt a slight shock ripple through his heart.

'Just how ancient is he? Dragon Monarch Beijia is a Hornless Dragon. If Dongfang Heyun truly is the first breath exhaled by Dragon Monarch Beijia, doesn't that mean he is nearly as old as the Dragon Monarch himself?!'

Struck by the realization, he first bowed respectfully and said:

"Thank you, Senior, for watching over me. Nearly four months have passed... Senior is truly erudite, to even know the Wei calendar."

Dongfang Heyun ignored the compliment and gestured for him to rise. The clouds filling the palace began to shift, converging beneath their feet until a spot of utter blackness materialized. Only then did the youth say:

"It is merely habit. Fellow Daoist, please."

Dongfang Heyun seemed to call everyone Fellow Daoist. He stepped into the Great Void. Li Zhouwei immediately saw the void filled with the deep, shimmering Light of Converging Waters—undoubtedly a Grand Array belonging to Dragon-kin. As Dongfang Heyun moved through the Great Void, he continued:

"The matter concerning the Lie Sea originated as a favor owed to Daoist Master Zipei."

"During the North-South Conflict long ago, it became necessary to open Anhuai Heaven. This released those portions of the Essence of True Qi and, in doing so, also revealed the status of the True Qi Fruition Attainment. The entity occupying that Fruition Attainment... is likely gone. This event greatly benefited my Dragon-kin, so Daoist Master Zipei seized the opportunity to make a transaction with us. As for her true motive..."

Dongfang Heyun shook his head, his expression caught between a smile and something else.

"To this day, it remains unknown."

Li Zhouwei’s heart sank. While the Li Clan and Purple Smoke were not entirely unconnected, their relationship was casual at best. They certainly had no deep ties to Zipei herself. After a moment of thought, he asked:

"Senior, you are sending me to..."

"Hoh."

Dongfang Heyun smiled slightly and replied:

"We just exited the Grotto-Heaven; naturally, we are heading toward the Beihai Sea. If you have a destination in mind, I can accompany you part of the way and see you there."

"You need not worry about Changxiao for now. As long as you don't stumble directly into one of the Changxiao Sect's few overseas outposts, he lacks the inclination to hunt you down. As for returning inland... that remains somewhat precarious."

Li Zhouwei understood his meaning. The open seas were ultimately the territory of Dragon-kin; whatever plots or hidden dangers existed, they would not be aimed at him here. But once he returned inland, Dragon-kin had no ability to intervene. While Changxiao wouldn't dare kill him, his formidable Life Divine Ability meant he surely possessed other insidious methods.

After saying this, Dongfang Heyun nodded slightly and added:

"It just means that Daoist Master of yours will have to endure a little more hardship."

Li Zhouwei replied:

"Since that is the case, I will trouble Senior to drop me at the nearest marketplace. I have several Dharma artifacts on hand that I must dispose of cleanly; traveling the seas while holding them is inherently unsafe."

Li Zhouwei ideally wanted to trade directly with Dragon-kin. They possessed the finest goods and had no fear of handling items belonging to the Changxiao Sect. However, the opportunity had not presented itself, and he suspected Dongfang Heyun lacked the authority to approve such a transaction. He posed the request deliberately, curious to see how the youth would respond.

"Easily done!"

As expected, Dongfang Heyun didn't comment further. He simply raised an eyebrow, peered out from the Great Void, and replied:

"In the Beihai Sea, you have the Changliu Mountain Marketplace. To the east, there is a place called Tai'e Island, a small trading market run by the Azure Pond Sect in the Hetian Sea. To the west is Mount Duan; it has a market, but it's best avoided. Further south lies the Vermillion Sea."

Li Zhouwei nodded, understanding the options. He felt a twinge of regret; he had originally wanted to continue east to see the Lie Sea at the far edge of the ocean. He said:

"Then I must trouble Senior to take me to Tai'e Island."

"Very well. Tai'e Island... that is also a new name."

Dongfang Heyun called it a new name, though given his age, "new" could have meant any time in the last several centuries. The youth nodded. After traveling only a short while longer, they burst through the Great Void and returned to the mortal realm. Li Zhouwei felt his footing lighten as he took to the air, realizing the white-robed young man beside him had already vanished. Only his elegant voice lingered:

"It is an Immortal Sect outpost, after all. It is inappropriate for me to draw closer. This spot is barely a hundred li from Tai'e Island; you may fly there yourself."

Li Zhouwei descended on his beam of light and bowed toward the empty sky. He let out a long breath, feeling himself relax considerably.

'I finally got through that!'

While Dragon-kin had shown him little malice, being surrounded by them—a Peak Purple Mansion Realm expert here, a Purple Mansion Realm Spirit Demon there, all of them high-status figures from the revered Dragon lineage—was inherently stressful. He was never truly at ease in the presence of such powerful demon beasts.

'I also managed to get an update on Changxiao, which means I don't need to be quite so wary of him. I can operate with more freedom now.'

Although the affair between Luoxia and Dragon-kin was complicated, it was fortunately not a problem for someone at his Foundation Establishment Realm to consider. Li Zhouwei never worried about such lofty matters, and his mood brightened instantly. He looked toward the horizon and was startled to see that the ocean before him was a deep, pervasive violet-red.

The seawater here was distinctly purplish-red, laced with faint traces of blue-violet. The typical azure blue of the Hetian Sea was nowhere to be seen. As far as he could see, the water was an interwoven tapestry of purple and blue. He immediately rode his light higher, appreciating the strange vista with growing curiosity.

After flying only a dozen li, he spotted a rogue cultivator hovering on the wind above the sea’s surface. Li Zhouwei needed directions. With a casual wave of his hand, a beam of Profound Light flared, and he rematerialized a short distance from the other cultivator.

Li Zhouwei's speed was already far beyond that of a typical cultivator, and he was further augmented by the Light-Shifting Shuttle Technique of his Yuan'E Soft Soft Armor. The rogue cultivator had no time to react. Seeing a Late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator materialize nearby, he instantly broke out in a cold sweat. He noted the newcomer's extraordinary bearing and the quality of his artifacts, recognizing this was no ordinary person. He quickly bowed.

"This humble cultivator greets the Daoist!"

Li Zhouwei had no intention of making things difficult for him and simply inquired:

"Which direction is Tai'e Island? And why is the seawater here violet-red?"

The cultivator hurriedly replied:

"Reporting to the Daoist, Tai'e Island is just over seventy li to the southeast. This area is known as the Violet-Slaying Minor Reefs, one of the few territories near Tai'e Island where resources can still be gathered. It originally produced Spirit Sand, but it was completely excavated by cultivators years ago. All that remains is the vast Cinnabar ore vein beneath the seabed. The seawater is saturated with Cinnabar dust, which gives it this violet-red appearance from afar."

He gave an ingratiating smile and added:

"Both the name and the reef itself have an origin. Years ago, a Senior Li known as the 'Astral Golden Bowstring' was stationed here when a Water Ape attacked. It was an incredibly imposing beast; I heard it was a Great Demon Beast nearing the Purple Mansion Realm. That Senior shot it dead right here with three arrows. Its body dissolved into a hundred li of Cinnabar, which formed this very reef. I heard it was because that Demon beast possessed... some kind of... Whole... something..."

Li Zhouwei’s eyebrows lifted, and the corners of his mouth turned up in a smile. His opinion of the rogue cultivator instantly improved. He motioned for the man to fly alongside him, and they both rode their light toward the southeast. "Is that the origin! You are speaking of the Whole Pill. So, who named these 'Violet-Slaying Minor Reefs'? And who is in charge of Tai'e Island these days?"

This rogue cultivator knew how to please, immediately affecting a look of sudden realization. He nodded repeatedly.

"Right, right! The Whole Pill! Your Excellency is truly knowledgeable. The 'Violet-Slaying Minor Reefs' weren't even the original name. They were called the 'Ape-Slaying Minor Reefs.' But the Island Lord stationed here is surnamed Yuan, and 'Ape-Slaying' sounded... well, it wasn't pleasant to his ears. So, they just substituted the color instead."

Li Zhouwei was flying extremely fast. In the time it took to exchange these few words, a large, ochre-yellow island had already appeared on the horizon. As they descended toward it, the rogue cultivator spoke respectfully:

"Your Excellency, please give your orders. This lowly one is Xiahou Damo. I am quite familiar with this island. To be able to serve the Daoist would be this humble cultivator's good fortune."

In these seas, encountering a high-status Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator traveling alone, without an entourage, was a rare opportunity. The rogue cultivator was trying to seize it. Li Zhouwei simply nodded.

"Take me to the place that deals in Dharma artifacts."

Since the island’s guarding cultivator was surnamed Yuan and belonged to the Azure Pond Sect, it had to be the Yuan Clan of Mushroom Forest Plains. Decades ago, Li Zhouwei would have needed no guide and would have been obligated to pay a formal visit. But now that their two families had parted ways, he couldn't be bothered and simply let Xiahou Damo lead on.

After only two streets, they arrived at the most opulent establishment on the island, a towering four-story pavilion. When Xiahou Damo stepped across the threshold, the attendants on either side barely gave him a second glance. When Li Zhouwei followed him in, however, they instantly lit up with brilliant smiles, bowing and greeting him as "Your Excellency."

Li Zhouwei wasted no time and proceeded directly to the highest floor. A man in blue robes, also at the Foundation Establishment Realm, moved to greet them. His judgment was clearly superior to Xiahou Damo's. He politely inquired:

"May I ask which noble lineage Your Excellency hails from...?"

Li Zhouwei took his seat firmly and replied:

"Supreme-grade Foundation Establishment Dharma artifacts, taken by killing a core disciple. Buy them if you can. An elder of my family also cultivates with the Azure Pond Sect, so do not waste my time with pleasantries."

He glanced up, his golden pupils sweeping the man's face. The features struck him as familiar. "What is your name?"

The man’s expression had already changed. While quietly dispatching someone downstairs, he replied with utmost respect:

"This junior hails from Jiangbei. My surname is Zhou, and my name is Boyun."

When Li Zhouwei heard Jiangbei combined with "Boyun," he immediately recalled a certain saber master. Comparing the man's features to his memory, he raised an eyebrow.

"Gongsun Boyun... I have met your elder brother. His saber technique is passable."

Zhou Boyun broke into a cold sweat upon hearing this. Fortunately, Li Zhouwei had no interest in pursuing the matter. He retrieved several jade boxes from his sleeve, setting them out one by one.

"Two Golden Thorn Dharma artifacts from the Golden Tang Gate; both are decent. One Green Gourd from the Water Mansion; this one is peak-grade among Foundation Establishment items, true heirloom quality. And one wooden staff—standard, but it can nourish the physical body and assist recovery."

He then produced an ordinary cloth storage pouch and set it on the table.

"The contents of this are also quite valuable, and should be easier to move."

Zhou Boyun bowed.

"May I ask... what Senior requires in return?"

Normally, no one would trade items like this purely for spirit stones; it simply wasn't necessary, and artifacts of this grade often couldn't be bought with spirit stones alone. However, for Li Zhouwei—and indeed, for the Li Clan as a whole—most items that were not useful at the Purple Mansion Realm held little significance. This made the transaction difficult.

Li Zhouwei considered this briefly and replied:

"I require one exceptional Dharma shield and one flying shuttle, or other Dharma artifacts of comparable quality."

He paused, then finally asked his most important question:

"Do you have any Purple Mansion Realm-level cultivation resources or materials here?"

The question left Zhou Boyun completely flustered. He was merely a Guest Elder on this island; how could he possibly have access to such things? His face flushed with embarrassment. Fortunately, a commotion arose from the stairwell, followed by hearty laughter.

"I wonder which Fellow Daoist has come to grace my Tai'e Island as a guest!"

Looking as if he’d received a pardon, Zhou Boyun quickly retreated to the side, bowing respectfully.

"Island Lord!"

Li Zhouwei knew the man surnamed Yuan had arrived. His expression remained neutral. He was not naturally arrogant and normally would have stood to show respect, but the current relationship between their two families was deeply awkward. It would not be an exaggeration to say a knot of enmity now existed between them. He could only lower his gaze and say nothing.

An old man ascended the pavilion stairs. He looked ancient, leaning heavily on a cane, with a full head of white hair, though his face was reasonably kindly. When he saw the young man remain seated, his expression soured with displeasure.

Had any ordinary cultivator dared to show such disrespect, Yuan Hu'e would have already started cursing. But this guest was extremely young and his cultivation profound. He worried Li Zhouwei might be a direct lineage disciple from some major power, so he dared not let his displeasure show too clearly.

His Tai'e Island was small, after all. Even bearing the Azure Pond Sect’s name, it was easily looked down upon. Worse, most core disciples from major sects knew that the Azure Pond Sect's own Purple Mansion Realm foundation was currently teetering. Glancing at the jade boxes spread on the table, he formed a guess and spoke in a tone that was half-polite, half-warning.

"This one is Yuan Hu'e, of the Yuan Clan of Mushroom Forest Plains. I humbly serve as the Island Lord of Tai'e and as the Peak Lord of Mercy Peak within the Azure Pool Sect, stationed here by sect orders."

"Might I ask who Fellow Daoist is? You needn't worry that my Azure Pool Sect cannot afford this exchange. The Violet-Slaying Spirit Trace is still active, and the Heavenly Pavilion Heavenly Glow holds sway over the Southern Sea and the Ten Thousand Mile Shitang. Shipping what you need would not take long."

Seeing that the man truly did not recognize him, Li Zhouwei understood. This old man must have been stationed here for many years, missing the recent events inland and rarely, if ever, returning. He replied casually:

"My reputation cannot compare to Old Senior's."

He smiled slightly and added:

"This junior hails from the Small Lake Within the Mainland. My surname is Li. My given name is Zhouwei."

The pavilion fell utterly silent. Zhou Boyun looked completely bewildered, clearly still trying to place the location "Small Lake Within the Mainland
." But the expression on Yuan Hu'e’s face froze solid. His pupils dilated rapidly, his gaze fixing belatedly on the young man’s golden eyes.

His mind roared into a state of blank white noise. A chill ran down his limbs, followed by a complex wave of dread and utter horror.

'Li Zhouwei... He is that Pride of the Li Clan, the Li family’s White Qilin!'

'The White Qilin Li Zhouwei! The one who ambushed and killed the Golden Tang Gate Master, Situ Mo! The one who fought six opponents at once, endured the spiritual artifact [Yongjing Profound Ring], and forcibly executed Yunan Zi—a core disciple of the Purple Mansion Realm lineage and a cultivator at the Peak Foundation Establishment Realm!'

'Why has this Baleful Star come here?! Is he not afraid of Changxiao?!'
