# Chapter 1023: Zhaoyuan

The Demon beast’s words were blunt, directly scolding the Cui family’s Daoist Master. This caused the faces of all the cultivators present to change. They exchanged glances and lowered their heads. Cui Juechen, kneeling at the front, remained frozen, not daring to make a sound.

Beside him, Cui Jueyin was even more stunned, a wave of bitterness washing over his heart.

'So that's how it is... so that's how it is...'

But the Demon beast stood with its head held high, a cold smile on its face.

The sea patrollers were Dragon-kin, with positions of varying ranks. Most were just putting on airs, borrowing the might of their superiors, and wouldn't normally dare to offend someone with a divine ability. Daoist Master Yangya, however, was an exception.

Back then, when the Cui clan established itself in the Eastern Sea, they faced the real danger of annihilation. The Cui Family Head at the time had urgently sought help from the Flood Dragon Palace, offering a Radiant Profound Origin to solve the Dragon King's pressing problem. Only then did they gain a firm foothold in the Eastern Sea. From that day forward, the Cui family relied on the Dragon-kin. Though they weren't official subordinates, they were subordinates in practice.

The Cui clan had risen from under the Dragon-kin's protection and had been based in the Eastern Sea for years. Logically, after achieving a divine ability, he should have paid a visit to the palace. But he had holed up in the Western Sea, ignoring his obligations... Still, his branch of the family was based in the Western Sea, which gave him a plausible excuse, so he hadn't been given much trouble.

If Daoist Master Yangya were present, this Demon beast wouldn't dare utter a word of ridicule... But everyone understood that while the Dragon King might not care, there were others in the sea who were displeased. Yangya had always avoided meeting with envoys of the Dragon-kin. Thus, the Demon beast's scolding was delivered with righteous confidence, knowing it had backing.

What could Cui Juechen do? His words carried little weight. He could neither argue with the Demon beast nor push the blame onto Daoist Master Yangya. All he could do was knock his head on the ground repeatedly.

“The divine ability's arrangements… we truly do not know. We only know that my second brother… his cultivation has reached a bottleneck and he has a chance to break through to the divine ability realm. He retrieved resources from the lake… I believe the two Daoist Masters must have given their consent… I hope the Sea Patroller will consider my second brother's situation and spare us!”

As soon as he said this, the cultivators on both sides fell to their knees. The Sea Patroller Huiyao's face hardened as he snarled,

“Are you implying… that I am making things difficult for you out of personal bias!”

“We wouldn't dare…”

Cries rose from all around. The giant beast on the sea roared again, sending water splashing everywhere, instantly silencing the clamor. The Sea Patroller Huiyao flicked his sleeve, saying with waning interest,

“Enough, enough… Tell that second brother of yours to come out and speak with me!”

As if granted a pardon, he quickly retreated. Cui Jueyin stepped forward, bowed, and said respectfully,

“Cui Jueyin, disciple of the Chongzhou Cui clan, greets you, my lord!”

“Oh!”

The Demon beast's cold expression vanished, replaced by a warm, eager smile.

“So it's you! Goodness! Why call me 'my lord'? You flatter me too much!”

The Demon beast's abrupt switch from arrogance to deference was startling. Even Cui Jueyin lost his composure for a moment, allowing himself to be led forward in a daze as the creature chuckled,

“You… you… what's all this 'Chongzhou' and 'Cui clan' nonsense? This place can't contain you! If I were you, I'd swagger around and act like the master of this place. I wouldn't call myself 'Cui Jueyin of the Chongzhou Cui clan.' I'd call myself 'Envoy Cui Jueyin, under the command of the Qilin'! Wouldn't that be impressive!”

Cui Jueyin didn't know whether to laugh or cry, but he maintained a meek expression, replying,

“I couldn't possibly… I couldn't possibly…”

“Of course you could!”

The Demon beast was utterly shameless. It pulled him by the hand to walk inside, but suddenly noticed the surroundings had fallen silent. All the Cui family members had raised their heads, staring intently into the distance.

“Hey!”

The Sea Patroller Huiyao's temper flared, and he was about to start scolding again when his ears twitched. He realized that even the sound of the waves had ceased. The world around them seemed to brighten, and the very sand on the beach glowed with a golden light.

This made his heart skip a beat,

'Heavens… don't tell me Yangya is back!'

To be caught acting tough by the master of the house… Huiyao was suddenly mortified, his heart pounding. It didn't matter if Yangya would dare to bear the consequences of killing him; if a fight broke out, he would surely be the one to die!

Trembling with fear, he turned his head and saw a brilliant radiance within the dark, gloomy clouds. A man with golden eyes, dressed in a long robe with sleeves embroidered with gold patterns, was stepping out of the Great Void, standing silently amidst the clouds.

Those golden eyes swept over them casually, seeming to freeze the very air on the beach. Huiyao's mind went blank. He heard the young man beside him take a step forward, drop to his knees with a thud, and say in a trembling voice,

“Jueyin pays his respects to Your Highness!”

His voice was slightly hoarse, filled with excitement and bewilderment. The young man in the clouds looked down, his gaze softening slightly,

“Jueyin.”

_Thump!_

The next to kneel was the Sea Patroller. His fish-like face contorted, and his eyes were fixed on the ground as he cried out,

“Huiyao… Huiyao pays his respects to Your Highness!”

This Demon was none other than Huiyao! He had once served in the Southern Sea, responsible for managing the offerings for the Li family's overseas base, Zongquan Island… He was an old acquaintance of the Li family!

A dazzling Heavenly Light descended, and Li Zhouwei was already before them. He recognized him at a glance, a hint of surprise in his voice,

“Huiyao? You've certainly made progress!”

The Demon beast pressed its head to the ground, not moving an inch, displaying extreme humility,

“Your Highness's radiance is brilliant, a splendor of ten thousand glories. A sliver of it graced this humble Demon, bringing me good fortune ever since. To be able to patrol the seas in such a prosperous place… this lowly one is eternally grateful… I heard that Daoist Master Yangya was being insolent, and I was just questioning them about it…”

He spoke with such righteousness that the Cui family members who heard him were shaken, finally realizing who stood before them.

'So it's this Highness...'

Li Zhouwei shook his head with a laugh. The massive Demon beast in the sea had already vanished, transforming into a middle-aged man who walked over cautiously and bowed in silence.

Huiyao didn't dare to get up. With his face still pressed to the ground, he forced a wide smile and made the introduction,

“This… this is General Zhanlin… he has also had the honor of meeting Your Highness before… He is a good friend of Ying Hebai. They once performed a martial arts display for Your Highnesses, a connection from long ago…”

“A Treasure-Scaled Ferry-Beast.”

Li Zhouwei nodded for him to rise and raised an eyebrow,

“Ying Hebai… how is he now?”

This Ying Hebai was the Northern Brocade River King, once a river Demon from Jiangbei. He had offered some small help in the past but had withdrawn after the incident with Li Qianyuan and vanished without a trace.

Huiyao seemed to sigh with emotion, replying,

“He is also of noble descent, but I heard he has a relative, perhaps an older sister or some other elder, who served under the Xu Water Demon King… For some reason, she fell out of favor, and after some jealous dispute, she was captured by the Demon King… and thrown in prison.”

“When Ying Hebai returned from Jiangbei, he had already lost most of his power and authority, no longer deserving of the title 'King'. He tried day after day to rescue his relative, which displeased the Demon King… He has fallen on very hard times!”

Li Zhouwei listened for a moment. Cui Jueyin, gritting his teeth silently, raised his head and said,

“Reporting to Your Highness… this subordinate also knows of him. When Guest Retainer Ding was trapped in Jiangbei, it was he who saved him…”

“I see.”

Li Zhouwei nodded and asked,

“His Highness Dingjiao… is there any news of him?”

At these words, Huiyao, who had just stood up, knelt down again, his face beaming,

“The Crown Prince has achieved a divine ability!”

“Oh?”

A smile touched Li Zhouwei's lips.

“That is truly wonderful news! When is the celebratory banquet? I should prepare a gift and offer my congratulations!”

“There was supposed to be a banquet…”

Huiyao's expression turned serious, and he lowered his voice,

“But recently, a major event has occurred in the sea. An elder of the Dragon-kin has had a joyous occasion… and no one is exempt, not even His Highness. The banquet has been postponed. His Highness… His Highness set off a day ago to offer his congratulations…”

'A day ago...'

Li Zhouwei felt a flicker of gravity, but his expression remained natural. He expressed his regret, then glanced around and said,

“I won't disturb your patrol then.”

“Your Highness is too kind!”

Huiyao chuckled, replying,

“Since Your Highness is here, this lowly one would never dream of disturbing your mood. What is there left to patrol…”

Since meeting the Li clan on Zongquan, Huiyao's official career had been smooth sailing. His clan's standing in the sea had improved significantly, for which he was naturally grateful. He bowed deeply and said respectfully,

“Please, Your Highness, go ahead!”

Li Zhouwei paid the two Demon beasts little mind. He nodded and began walking toward the island's interior. The people on both sides hastily moved aside. Cui Juechen, watching this, was terrified. He scrambled forward on his hands and knees and kowtowed beside him,

“My lord… let this lowly one serve you!”

These Dragon-kin Demon beasts were notoriously arrogant. Who else could he be, to command such reverence from a Dragon-kin Sea Patroller, to possess such a dazzling divine ability, and to be addressed as 'Your Highness' by Cui Jueyin?

He scrambled up from the ground, not even bothering to straighten his sleeves, and led Li Zhouwei forward with a stooped back. They walked all the way to the golden Celestial Hall at the highest point, where he invited the lord to take the central seat and waited on him respectfully.

Just then, an old man with a full head of white hair came up the steps, sat down beside him, and said respectfully,

“This humble cultivator, Cui Changyan, greets the Daoist Master.”

This must be the elder currently in charge of the island. Cui Jueyin immediately stood up to serve tea. Li Zhouwei turned his head and asked him,

“Jueyin, Yangya told you to return and focus on your cultivation, yet you are still out here, running errands.”

As soon as these words were spoken, the Cui family members on both sides broke out in a cold sweat. Given this man's divine ability and his relationship with the Dragon-kin… if he were displeased, Chongzhou would suffer immensely!
Fortunately, Cui Jueyin quickly bowed and replied,

“The seas have been restless recently. It happened to coincide with me coming out of seclusion, so I came to help stand guard…”

This made Li Zhouwei put down his cup. He raised an eyebrow and looked at Cui Changyan. The old man quickly averted his gaze, looking down without a word, his forehead beaded with sweat.

Li Zhouwei said nothing. His golden eyes stared at the old man, who felt as if he were being scorched by a blazing sun. His heart pounded with guilt, and beads of sweat trickled down the wrinkles on his face. His tightly pursed, aged lips began to tremble, on the verge of speaking.

“Your Highness!”

But Cui Jueyin took a step forward. The white-robed young man dropped to his knees with a thud, holding a bowl of clear tea above his head as he pleaded,

“Your Highness, please have some tea!”

The golden-eyed young man paused. He finally shifted his gaze away from the elder, gave Cui Jueyin a deep look, took the tea from his hands, and sipped it lightly.

“I came this time… for one, to see you.”

“And two… to meet the descendants of the Wei.”

The hall fell silent, the only sound his calm voice,

“Let us speak of the old empire.”

He raised his cup and listened as the old man let out a deep sigh,

“Reporting to Your Highness… my Cui clan… has seven main branches. My Chongzhou Cui clan descends from the third branch. Our ancestors were originally one family with the Dongli Cui clan, but their branch was more noble and once produced a True Monarch… During Wei's time, our branch focused on cultivation and often managed affairs in the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate…”

“Later, Emperor Gong of Wei wished to find Penglai and sent our ancestors out on treasure ships… but they searched for years without success. We settled in Chongzhou and continued to look for clues… But then great chaos erupted on the mainland, causing the Great Void to shatter and spiritual energy to fluctuate wildly… We lost contact and had no one to give us orders, so we made our home on the island.”

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, asking,

“The Great Void shattered… how did it shatter?”

A look of horror appeared on Cui Changyan's face. He replied,

“The books describe this event with only four words, but the story passed down was this… It was said that spiritual energy gathered but would not disperse, becoming chaotic and disordered, like a thousand ribbons of light scattered across heaven and earth. In the sea, there were streaks and bands of it—some condensed into mist, others were completely devoid of spiritual energy…”

Li Zhouwei understood immediately. The Great Void was fundamentally based on spiritual energy. If a place had no spiritual energy, the Great Void would not exist there, and one could not find a point in the Great Void to descend to that location. If the spiritual energy in the physical world had truly condensed into ribbons, the Great Void would have been fragmented into countless pieces…

He pondered for a moment and asked,

"Which of the Three Profoundities does the Zhaoyuan Immortal Estate belong to? How many True Monarchs were there, and how did they fare during Wei's fall?"

Cui Changyan gritted his teeth, replying,

“According to the mainland's classification, it should belong to the Encompassing Profoundity of the Three Profoundities, but this classification isn't entirely accurate…”

His tone held a hint of pride,

“Bright Yang was the Emperor, his title Guanyuan. He sacrificed at the grand temple and opened the Qian Palace. With the beat of war drums, he subjugated the world's transcendent factions and abolished thirty-two hundred sects—True Daoist cultivators had their crowns removed and their wings clipped; the demon child of Qinling Temple was slain and his head hung high; the evil cults of the sacred mountains were bound and brought to Wei; the small shamanic states were overthrown and their people captured… The guilty were executed, the worthy were assimilated. The innocent were taken in and incorporated into the Zhaoyuan Estate, all for the sake of the world…”

“The Zhaoyuan Estate resided in the Wei Huang Heaven. It did not belong to any single Daoist Tradition; it was the law estate of the Daoist Tradition for the entire Wei dynasty!”

Li Zhouwei lifted his chin, his gaze changing slightly,

“So, it was a tradition unto itself.”

After finishing the last word, Cui Changyan fell from that magnificent past back to the bleak reality. The fire in his eyes vanished as he said in a low voice,

“As for a True Monarch… I have only heard of one… His Daoist title is unknown, but he never entered the imperial court.”

“Never entered the imperial court.”

Now that was interesting. It immediately caught Li Zhouwei's attention.

Wei practiced the law of an immortal kingdom. All official positions, great and small, were imbued with power. Even a mortal without any cultivation would gain a measure of it upon receiving a post, and the highest offices came with a divine ability… Not entering the imperial court most likely meant this True Monarch had achieved his cultivation on his own!

He gently set down his cup. He suddenly sensed something, and looking up, a curious smile spread across his face.

In an instant, the entire island began to shake. A brilliant radiance appeared in the sky, and the rolling dark clouds immediately receded, revealing floating, colorful clouds and countless rays of Heavenly Light!

This Heavenly Light was not overbearing or intense, but soft as fluff, like a waterfall cascading down through layers of clouds. It drifted down onto the rooftops and draped over the window curtains like a countless white rain, flowing among the palaces.

A clamor erupted across the island. Cui Jueyin was still young and didn't know what this phenomenon signified. He looked up, bewildered. Cui Changyan's face, however, turned deathly pale.

The old man had witnessed this spectacle of the changing Bright Yang countless times. His father, his brothers, one after another had fallen. Now that the phenomenon had appeared again, the color drained from his face. He sat frozen in his seat, terrified, and looked at Li Zhouwei with a pleading gaze.

But he saw the golden-eyed young man shake his head with amusement, saying calmly,

“Congratulations!”

Shock filled Cui Jueyin's eyes. An explosion of ecstatic joy erupted on Cui Changyan's face. He stood up from his seat as if in a dream, looking from Cui Jueyin to Li Zhouwei. The joy transformed into boundless shock, making his lips tremble, unable to speak.

He fell to his knees with a thud and began to kowtow, as if completely drained of strength. He wept,

“I never knew Your Highness was such a figure!”
