# Chapter 918: Xuandan Supreme Yin

The Eastern Sea, Chunyi Dao Gate.

A streak of white light sped in from over the sea, scattering a gentle, diffuse glow of Supreme Yin. The young Daoist Master within it was the very picture of elegance, his white robes patterned with waves and crescent moons, giving him an otherworldly, dashing air.

Yet his expression was grim, his face tight with suppressed emotion. He bore no obvious wounds, but the light of his divine ability was dim, a clear sign he had just withdrawn from a major battle.

This was none other than Daoist Master Che Hong, who had gone to reinforce the Tangdao Mountain Range.

Daoist Master Che Hong was the latest of the Chunyi Dao Gate's generation to ascend to the Purple Mansion Realm. His success marked a new pinnacle for the sect, its first time boasting four Purple Mansion Realm masters in nearly three hundred years. He was a first-rate genius, sharp and perceptive; how could he possibly fail to grasp the current situation?

His Chunyi Dao Gate claimed to possess the Supreme Yin legacy, yet it also called itself part of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. The six lineages of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition in Jiangnan had never truly acknowledged this claim. For many years, they had actively marginalized the Chunyi Dao Gate. This was true even though Ancestor Chunyi, Jiequn, had clearly originated from the Green Pine Temple. Back then, whenever anyone asked, the people of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition would either fall silent or dismiss it as a mere rumor.

After all, Ancestor Jiequn's Daoist name didn't align with their conventions, and he had never reached the level of a True Monarch. The cultivators of the Chunyi Dao Gate were generally modest and rarely argued the point publicly, but it was impossible not to harbor some resentment.

In recent years, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's stance had gradually softened. As the Chunyi Dao Gate reached the peak of its power, and when he, Che Hong, had ascended to the Purple Smoke Blessed Land, Tinglan herself had called him a fellow disciple. This had been an immense vindication. Outwardly, Che Hong had claimed it didn't matter, all while pouring his full effort into assisting them. Though his face was grim from the battle, he couldn't help but feel a savage satisfaction.

'Look at how you treated our gate back then. And look at how we repay you now. *This* is the magnanimity of the true Supreme Yang lineage! Every time you utter the words "fellow disciple," you are slapping your own facesâ€”the same faces that once refused to acknowledge us, the same faces that belittled our elders!'

But the satisfaction was fleeting. The battle was over, and the fall of Kui Qi weighed heavily on Che Hong's heart, leaving him at a loss for words. Worse, while *he* had given his all in the battle at Tangdao Mountain, the Chunyi Dao Gate as a whole had not. They had merely contributed what was required to fulfill their obligation to the righteous path.

'If the Old Daoist Master doesn't act, the situation at Tangdao Mountain is hopeless. But he is old, relying on a few secret Supreme Yin methods just to preserve his life... How could we ask him to go, asking our Chunyi Dao Gate to ignore the threats from Crimson reef and Jingyi...?'

His thoughts were heavy as he flew, soon reaching the edge of the mountain. He saw a Daoist Master riding the wind toward him, apparently having waited for some time. A hopeful look crossed the man's face, and he flew up with a smile.

"Brother Xi Chang!"

"Ah, Senior Ji An! What a rare visitor."

One called him "brother," the other "senior," revealing the difference in their status and age. Che Hong gave a slight bow, and the two headed into the mountain together. They settled at a table to catch up. After about half a quarter-hour, Ji An shook his head.

"This time... I've come from the Northern Sea specifically to ask about finding a new place to settle!"

Che Hong's expression changed. "What brought this on?"

"Why such desperation? Senior, your conduct has always been righteous, and you are well-known among those in the Purple Mansion Realm. How could those Five Gates dare to move against you?"

Ji An silently shook his head. The Daoist Master looked quite old but put on no airs. "It's not entirely their doing."

"The Five Gates of Gongdu have an upright foundation. I don't provoke them, and they have no reason to bother with me. Brother, you may not know, but this is about something else entirely."

"In Cangzhou, the Pit Water is now unbound, flooding all four territories. My cultivation is in Li Fire; it's completely unsuitable. I thought I could endure it day by day, but it only gets worse. A few days ago, even the [Six Manifestations Li Fire] on my Bei'er Mountain nearly had its Spiritual Qi extinguished. If not for the formation's spiritual flame, Bei'er Mountain would have reverted to a Pit Water domain!"

A cold light flashed in Che Hong's eyes. He lowered his brows. "Then, Senior's intention is?"

Ji An said, "When I was young, I knew an elder who cultivated Pit Water. I've given the mountain to his descendants and am preparing to move here, to the Eastern Sea."

Che Hong understood. Ji An, however, continued with sudden enthusiasm.

"I was passing through the Hetian Sea just as the Great Yang Mountain Dharma Assembly was ending. I ran into a friend who told me some good news he'd heard in a report from the Way of Great Desire. Traces of the 'Great Parting Scripture' have been found in the Moongaze Marsh! It's connected to a Purple Mansion Realm Immortal Clan."

"Mm..."

Che Hong replied nonchalantly, taking a sip of tea.

"I know. It's not just the 'Great Parting Scripture.' There's also 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' and even a Whole Pill Daoist tradition. I hear none of them are of low quality."

"What?!"

Ji An leaned forward, his voice urgent.

"I heard it was an Immortal Clan that produced two Purple Mansion Realm masters in a single century! And based on the timing, they must have been cultivating these arts *before* their breakthroughs. Every one of those items is an incredible rarity. This... this... they must have found a hidden Daoist treasury!"

Che Hong remained calm, pouring more tea.

"'Bright Yang' and 'Li Fire'... You're not the first person to take notice. How do you think they acquired those things? That family has a genius blessed by the fate of Bright Yang... a Bright Yang Mandate!"

As he said this, a faint smile touched his lips.

"As for this 'friend' of yours... how many Buddhist cultivators can you really trust? Be careful, Senior."

Ji An nodded as if in sudden understanding, but the hand resting on his cup remained perfectly relaxed. He was clearly unsurprised, and had likely come specifically to probe for this information. Che Hong knew this as well and shook his head.

"You cultivate Li Fire, so it makes sense that you'd want to get close and build a relationship. There could be benefits... but there are also risks."

Before he could finish, a jade pendant at his waist flashed. Che Hong's expression shifted. "Excuse me." He transformed into a ray of Supreme Yin light and ascended, passing through a great, snow-swirling formation. He landed by a jade pool where the moonlight cast a silvery-white sheen on the rippling water. Two people were seated by the pool, with a third standing in attendance.

The man in the host's seat, dressed in moon-white Daoist robes, was his own elder, Daoist Master Fuxuan. The person in the guest's seat, clad in green robes, had azure eyes and a tranquil, self-possessed air. His cultivation was clearly profound. Che Hong's eyes lit up.

'The one named Chi is here!'

The man before him was none other than the Great Daoist Master from the Azure Pond, Chi Buzi!

Standing respectfully to the side was the elderly man, Xi, who had accompanied him on the mission. His face was pale and he looked exhausted, but his expression held both joy and relief.

Ever since Chi Buzi had taken the Chunyi Dao Gate's people to the Eastern Sea, Daoist Master Fuxuan had not gone a single day without worrying. He had mentioned it to Che Hong several times. Seeing Chi Buzi return so soon, Che Hong was overjoyed and his tone became respectful.

"So it is the Great Daoist Master."

No one mentioned the events at Tangdao Mountain. Chi Buzi, for his part, seemed completely unbothered. He sat there beaming and shook his head.

"Since my Daoist friend is here, I won't waste words. Please retrieve those two treasures of mine."

The Chunyi Dao Gate had no intention of coveting his Spiritual Artifacts. They were quickly retrieved and placed on a tray held by Che Hong, who stood to the side. Chi Buzi gave them a cursory glance and nodded silently.

Both Purple Mansion Realm masters kept their eyes locked on him. It was obvious: unless Chi Buzi produced something worthwhile, the Chunyi Dao Gate would not be returning his items so easily.

Chi Buzi, however, said leisurely, "I should have been back much sooner, but... just as I was leaving, the place was discovered by a Merciful One!"

At these words, both men tensed. Daoist Master Fuxuan frowned immediately, suspecting an excuse. Che Hong glanced at the elderly attendant, who wore a look of profound, shared experience. Only then did Chi Buzi smile.

"I won't say more for now. I'll let my Daoist friend see for himself!"

He gave his sleeve a gentle shake, and a stone box appeared in his hand.

This box was carved from [Baizhi Greenstone], a spiritual material rarely seen since ancient times. It was a container used specifically for storing extremely high-quality Purple Mansion Realm spiritual items!

Fuxuan nodded slightly at the sight, but Che Hong lowered his gaze, a seed of disappointment already growing in his heart.

If there was one thing the Chunyi Dao Gate craved above all else, it was undoubtedly the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance.

The Chunyi Dao Gate's current prosperity was inextricably linked to the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance. This Spiritual Qi had long since vanished from the world and could only be found in ancient ruins or hidden caches. Little of it had ever fallen into the hands of the Chunyi Dao Gate, and in recent years, as various Mystic Realms closed, the amount circulating among Purple Mansion Realm masters had dwindled, becoming ever more precious.

Unfortunately, the very completeness of the Chunyi Dao Gate's Daoist tradition meant it required an immense amount of [Supreme Yin Moon Radiance]. A single Great Daoist Master needed at least four portions. While the sect had inferior techniques that could, with difficulty, form a divine ability, the result was inevitably a step below.

Within their Daoist tradition, only the Old Daoist Master Yuanshang had cultivated using the legacy's remaining Supreme Yin Moon Radiance, and even he had used only a single portion. Fuxuan, standing before him, had also used one portion he had acquired by chance, but it was only enough to form his second divine ability. The others had not been so fortunate.

By the time it came to Che Hong and his grandfather, Daoist Master Guanghou, there was no more of this Spiritual Qi left in the Daoist tradition. After long deliberation, they had Daoist Master Guanghou cultivate 'Water Mansion'. Che Hong not only used the inferior cultivation method but had never even *seen* [Supreme Yin Moon Radiance]. To speak of using it for mere Qi Refining was the height of luxury; it seemed more fitting to use it for breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm.

While the box was of high quality, if the item inside were Supreme Yin Moon Radiance, it would surely be stored in a jade vial, not a stone box.

But just as he was lost in his disappointment, Chi Buzi placed a hand on the jade box and gently released a wisp of its aura.

*Clang!*

Daoist Master Che Hong felt a frigid aura erupt skyward. The white-robed Daoist Master in front of him shot to his feet, his breathing suddenly ragged. With a soft *thud*, one of Fuxuan's hands slammed down on the jade table, landing just a finger's width from the box.

He snapped his head up, his expression one of utmost gravity. His eyes, fixed on Chi Buzi, swam with a wild, bewildered ecstasy, as if he might lunge forward at any second.

"Daoist Friend Buzi..."

His voice was raw, his eyes bloodshot.

"May I... take a closer look?"

Fuxuan had practiced the sword for many years, and his hands were impeccably maintained, appearing long and fine in the swirling, snowy light. Yet these same handsâ€”which had slain countless demons and Buddhist cultivators without a tremorâ€”were now visibly trembling on the tabletop, fighting the urge to snatch the jade box.

The green-eyed man sitting opposite him showed no surprise. He remained perfectly at ease, not even twitching a finger, and simply smiled.

"Calm yourself, Daoist friend."

It all happened in a flash. Only now did Che Hong stare blankly at the box. The aura had been so faint, so fleeting, that clearly only the man before him had been able to sense it.

*Clang!*

Fuxuan let out a long breath. His other hand, which had drifted to the Spiritual Sword at his waist, slowly relaxed. He unfastened the sword and set it quietly to the side, though his eyes never left the jade box. "A matter of great importance. I lost my composure."

Even though Chi Buzi made no move to stop him, and the great treasure was within arm's reachâ€”a treasure he could easily use as leverage to keep the two Spiritual Artifactsâ€”Fuxuan merely settled back into his seat. He simply couldn't bear to close his eyes.

And Chi Buzi, who appeared to have everything under control, was actually reeling in shock.

'[Moon Laurel Golden Branch]... so it's *this* powerful a spiritual object!'

After all, in that grotto-heaven, they used them by the basketful. They weren't even guarded. A random servant girl would gather a basket and deliver them to the various palaces. Chi Buzi found it difficult to reconcile that sight with Fuxuan's intense reaction. He could only stroke his beard and smile.

"It seems my Daoist friend recognizes this item. To be frank, in that entire grotto-heaven, this was the only thing truly worthy of being called a great treasure!"

Fuxuan sighed deeply, his gaze filled with an inconsolable melancholy.

"Even if that grotto-heaven wasn't left by the Ancestor, it must have belonged to a high-level cultivator of the ancient Supreme Yin Dao. This item... this item has been extinct for ages. 'Great treasure' doesn't even begin to describe it!"

"Oh...?"

Chi Buzi's expression turned inquisitive. He flicked a finger, manifesting a divine ability. The lid of the stone box slowly turned transparent, revealing a single Moon Laurel branch lying within. It was dotted with small white flowers and glowed with a hazy halo. The cut end of the branch had fine, spiraling golden threads, and it radiated a bone-deep chill.

Fuxuan's entire being was focused on the item. He was perfectly accommodating, his eyes filled with deep yearning as he whispered:

"This is the [Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch]. It is unequivocally an artifact of ancient times... rarer even than Supreme Yin Moon Radiance."

As this concerned his Daoist tradition, he dared not say more. Chi Buzi nodded quietly, muttering the name to himself several times, inwardly stunned. He did not, however, push the jade box across the table. Fuxuan understood immediately and turned his head.

"Chang'er."

He had actually used Che Hong's intimate name, revealing his desperation. Che Hong didn't dare hesitate, holding out the two Spiritual Artifacts toward Chi Buzi.

Seeing the man shake his head, Fuxuan was not surprised. "This is...?"

Chi Buzi said softly, "This is what I mentioned earlier. A Merciful One saw it."

Fuxuan's expression darkened instantly. This was a major complication, and murderous intent flashed in his eyes. Fortunately, Chi Buzi continued.

"Luckily, that thing's cultivation wasn't high. I've already... secretly killed it."

"Good!"

For a Great Daoist Master like Chi Buzi, "killed" certainly didn't mean something as simple as sending him back to the Buddhist Land. Fuxuan let out a visible sigh of relief. "As expected of you, Daoist friend. Your methods are reassuring."

The two clearly had a personal relationship, perhaps having known each other in their youth. Chi Buzi's expression grew serious.

"The only problem is, the other party belonged to the Way of Compassion. I cannot afford to get entangled with them right now."

He felt at his waist and produced a small golden casket. Something inside rattled, perhaps fragments of a Treasured Artifact. Fuxuan took it without hesitation.

"This item will subtly lead the Way of Compassion to divine that it was my Chunyi Dao Gate who did the killing. The blame will not fall on you, Daoist friend."

Chi Buzi nodded with a smile.

Both men understood. Chi Buzi wasn't concerned about this minor grudge. This was a way to subtly shift the discovery of the grotto-heaven onto the Chunyi Dao Gate. If anything was discovered later, and conflict arose, Chi Buzi would not be left unable to defend himself.

But Chi Buzi's plans went further; he had his own agenda.

'I need to make an offering, but I can't be too obvious. Who goes around killing Merciful Ones repeatedly for no reason? I've already killed so many. If there isn't some clear benefit, it's bound to arouse suspicion!'

From his perspective, this was just a convenient, justifiable opportunity to kill another Merciful One. He had specifically used this window of time not only to resolve his cultivation method issue but also to seize the chance to make another offering!

He still didn't relent, his hand resting firmly on the jade box. His eyes were grave as he finally revealed his true purpose, his voice firm and resolute.

"I wish to cultivate a different Dao, to find a new path for my reincarnation. For this, I need the Chunyi Dao Gate... to introduce me to Daoist Master Pu Yu of Penglai!"
