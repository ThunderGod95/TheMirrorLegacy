# Chapter 993: Father... Brother... Heh...

The wind howled, piling white drifts against the bleak, frost-covered trees.

A middle-aged man with a pallid face stood silently in the snow, clutching his robes. His gaze was vacant, fixed on nothing as the blizzard dumped layer upon layer of white upon his shoulders.

Before long, a younger man with a frigid expression approached and knelt beside him.

"Family Head... that black ape has returned. It's demanding this year's blood-food."

A sickly, flushed color rose in the middle-aged man's face. He coughed twice, then slowly closed his eyes. "Give it what it wants..."

"Yes..." The young man grit his teeth and rose to his feet. He had only taken a few steps before the middle-aged man called him back.

"Suining..."

Li Suining turned. The man had opened his eyes again. "I'm afraid my time is short," he said quietly.

A wave of grief washed over Li Suining. He stepped forward, his voice low.

"Please, Fifth Grand-Uncle, just focus on healing. If the Daoist Master were still here... he would not want to see you speak of yourself this way..."

"The Daoist Master..." The middle-aged man coughed again, a deep hatred surfacing in his eyes, mingled with anguish. "I am ashamed to be his blood. I possess neither the King of Wei's divine ability nor any talent for alchemy. A pity... such a pity..."

He paused, then said hollowly, "Suining."

Li Suining looked up as the man continued, "Flee for your life."

Li Suining fell silent, staring with his uncle at the desolate snowfall. The middle-aged man began to murmur.

"You are the last of our family's younger generation with any decent cultivation... you were always the most promising... Li Xixuan made his mistakes, but he wasn't stupid, and you are far smarter than him. You know it, too. Staying here is a death sentence."

"Now that Daoist Master Ning has also fallen... even a Purple Mansion Realm expert can perish, to say nothing of us. If we stay, we will die, sooner or later. You are better off taking your chances in the outside world. You might find that one sliver of hope."

The young man remained silent, listening.

"We are all going to die... I understood that the moment the decree came down. All of us. The Bright Yang bloodline must be severed, or they will never sleep peacefully... I, Li Zhouming... I, Li Zhouming, am nothing but bait..."

"Grandfather... the King of Wei... he is the reason. He is the one who is despised..."

Li Zhouming's face was ashen. He seemed exhausted, his expression drifting into a daze as his lips barely moved.

"Father... Brother... heh..."

Li Suining stood frozen, a cold sweat covering his entire body as he watched the pale man before him. When Li Zhouming's eyes drifted shut as if in sleep, Li Suining was struck with sudden terror. He dropped to his knees, shouting, "Fifth Grand-Uncle! Fifth Grand-Uncle!"

A dark trickle of blood ran from the man's nose. He slowly pitched forward, slumping against Li Suining’s chest.

Li Suining's pupils dilated to their absolute limit. The young man, who had always been so calm and iron-willed, who had walked through mountains of corpses and seas of blood, finally broke. He let out a raw, gut-wrenching wail.

"The Wanling... the Wanling Flower... it's gone! Grand-Uncle!"

The man in his arms grew weaker, his breath shallow, his words fracturing into nonsense.

"The old... times... where... where did they go..."

"Fifth Grand-Uncle!"

...

The spring air held a biting chill.

The lamps in the house had been extinguished long ago. In the gloom, the open doors of the cabinets on either side of the room revealed stacks upon stacks of Daoist texts, their titles barely visible.

The dark room was silent save for the faint, steady breathing from the bed, the sound of footsteps outside, and, further in the distance, the thin, reedy sound of a faraway melody.

"Sincerity... beloved... immortal..."

The footsteps outside stopped abruptly, followed by a child's clear voice.

"Ning'er!"

The calls continued, muffled and indistinct. On the bed, a boy on the cusp of adolescence tossed and turned. He seemed trapped in a nightmare, struggling to wake but unable to open his eyes.

_Creak!_

The door was suddenly thrust open with a piercing shriek of wood on wood. A child of perhaps eight or nine years old burst in, his face beaming.

"Ning'er!"

He had barely stepped inside when an elderly nanny rushed in behind him, panting and sweating. Her face fell. "Do not disturb your brother!" she hissed.

The sharp command was like a clap of thunder, finally shattering the nightmare. The boy's eyes fluttered open. The snowy landscape vanished. Li Zhouming was gone. He was dazed.

'It was a dream... I'm not dead... I actually dreamed of Grand-Uncle Zhouming...'

He wasn't surprised. Li Zhouming's death had been a profound shock; dreaming of it was only natural. But in that hazy moment, a sharp spike of confusion pierced his thoughts.

'Can Lufu... didn't he unleash the Lush Sea? How am I alive?'

'Wait... since I began cultivating, how long has it been since I last had a dream?!'

In a fraction of a second, the boy on the bed vaulted into a sitting position. His eyes snapped open, shining like cold stars, radiating a killing intent so sharp and frigid it seemed to stab the air.

"Who!"

The gaze struck the old nanny like a blow, sending a chill through her entire body. Her mind raced.

'Young Master... what's wrong with him? Can he possibly harbor such hatred for his father?'

She quickly bowed. "Young Master... I apologize for disturbing your rest..."

But as she bowed, Li Suining's focus had shifted. His gaze locked onto the small child, his pupils rapidly contracting.

"You... Kuan'er..."

He raised his head, his eyes sweeping across the room's furnishings with stunned disbelief. He took in every detail, a hot rush of blood stinging his nose. His expression suddenly went flat.

'This... this is... Dongyi Prefecture...'

He shut his eyes, feigning drowsiness, but behind his closed lids, he was frantically assessing his surroundings and the pitifully weak well of Spiritual Qi within his body. He remembered it all!

'This is... Tingzhou, Moongaze Lake...'

No matter how much torment he had endured, no matter how many sleepless nights he had spent staring out at the wind and rain, he had always forced himself to remember his time on the lake. As he lay dying in the Lush Sea, this very scene had flashed before his eyes, but it had never felt this real.

'It seems... it's really happening...'

He asked no questions about the year, nor did he show any undue alarm. After that first moment of shock, he forced himself to sit calmly. "Brother," he said, his voice strained, "did you come to find me? Is something wrong at home?"

The nanny's heart sank, knowing the secret was out. As she feared, Li Suikuan grinned. "I came to find you, brother! I just heard that Grand-Aunt from the lake is coming to shore! I ran right over to tell you!"

'Grand-Aunt... That's right... At this time, she's still alive... still a high-level Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator...'

He stood up, dazed, and took two stumbling steps. He walked out the door, lifting his head, breathing in the lakeside breeze that made his heart tremble. He looked up at the sky.

There was only a single, brilliant sun.

The Martial Cultivation Star, the one that shone day and night, illuminating the entire land, was nowhere to be seen.

His heart instantly hammered against his ribs, threatening to leap from his throat. Hot blood rushed to his face, stinging his eyes.

'The Great Song has not been founded. The Shu dynasty's reign is not yet begun... I am fifteen years old... It is still five full years until the first year of Siwu, when the Yang family will ascend the throne...'

'This year, the Great Daoist Master has not yet been named King of Wei. The Compassion has not arrived. The Changhe Rebellion has not happened... Guest Retainer Ding should still be on the lake, and that man surnamed Wang has not yet reached the Purple Mansion Realm...'

'My family... my family hasn't even reached its zenith. We haven't seen the days of flowering brocade and oil-fueled fires. The miracle of 'Four Purple Mansions in one family' hasn't happened yet—and more importantly, the fall has not begun... the long, slow decline into ruin, ending with our annihilation in the Southern Borderlands...'

'There's still time... Daoist Master Zhaojing will appear on the lake. She hasn't left for the West Sea. There is still time for everything...'

A thousand thoughts raged through his mind, but he ruthlessly suppressed them. The skills he had honed over long years of wind and snow, of burying his thoughts and masking his intentions, suddenly served an unexpected purpose. He became preternaturally calm.

'I must not expose myself. Even if the King of Wei said that the peaks were blessed by Mount Dali and protected by the Azure Insight Origin Mirror, preventing the great powers from prying... I cannot afford to underestimate them.'

Li Suining's thoughts had taken only an instant. He turned back, a smile spreading across his face.

"This is wonderful news!"

Li Suikuan pouted, and for a moment, Li Suining's gaze softened.

His own father had died young, and his grand-uncle, Li Chengzai, was utterly useless. The entire Yuanwan Branch was filled with mediocrity. But extremes often produce their opposite. In the 'Sui' generation, the two brothers who could cultivate, Li Suikuan and himself, were both exceptional. Li Chengzai couldn't stand to see him succeed, but Li Suikuan, who was clever, had always secretly sided with him. After the battle for the Wei capital, when the Second Manifestation appeared, he had managed to escape. But his younger brother had died in the fighting, his body left forever at the foot of that mountain.

'The clansmen always blamed him for his ancestor's failings. He never dared to return to the lake, and at the foot of that mountain, he never retreated a single step...'

In his past life, only Li Chengzai had known their Grand-Aunt Li Minggong was coming. He had told only Li Suikuan to prepare. But his brother had secretly run to tell him. Li Suining had immediately canceled his plans for the autumn hunt and was thus able to meet her. Because of that, both brothers were permitted to enter the island together. If he had been even a few days late, he might still have met his Second Uncle, Li Jianglong, but he almost certainly would have missed the opportunity to meet Li Ximing.

It was also because of Li Suikuan that he later refrained from settling the score with that idiot Li Chengzai. But that was a story for another time.

He just smiled. "Thank you, brother... I actually just promised a few friends I'd go to the autumn hunt today!"

Ignoring the nanny, the boy walked forward quickly, took his younger brother's hand, and led him out. They walked to the residence diagonally opposite theirs. Li Suining calculated the time and smiled.

"You go on in. It wouldn't be right for me to arrive empty-handed. I'll be right behind you."

Li Suikuan nodded and pushed the door open. Li Suining quickly circled around, grabbed a few pieces of fruit from nearby, and then fixed his gaze on the sky. He waited until a brilliant beam of True Fire descended into the courtyard. Only then did he step forward and knock.

"Is the master at home? Suining has come to pay his respects!"

The door opened with a soft creak. Inside, the entire room was kneeling. In the center stood a woman in palace attire, her bearing elegant and dignified, her aura gentle yet imposing. A faint aura of True Fire shimmered around her, and her eyes held an imperious light that was deeply compelling.

It was Li Minggong.

Feigning astonishment, he immediately bowed low. "Greetings, Grand-Aunt!"

Li Minggong nodded at him, her gaze sweeping over the simple fruit in his hands. "You must be Second Brother's descendant... Suining, is it?"

"Yes..."

Seeing her alive, Li Suining felt his eyes burn.

After the Great Song was founded, the Li clan had known little peace. Though their fame spread across the lands during the long years of war, and many held high positions... in the end, the great masters fell, one by one.

During the three wars between Shu and Song over Guyan, Li Xinghan and Li Minggong had both perished. The Zhuang family was annihilated. Li Minggong herself had been surrounded by five enemies. Her crimson fire had blazed across the great desert, a solitary plume of True Fire, until it was extinguished. That news had finally broken the old family head. He had coughed up blood, taken to his bed, and never risen again.

Li Suining took one look and lowered his head, his excitement still within the bounds of normality. Li Minggong looked away from him and spoke to Li Chengzai, who was kneeling nearby.

"I am taking the two children," she stated.

The middle-aged man's eyes flickered toward Li Suining, then quickly back. He looked ecstatic. "Yes... Thank you, Elder Sister! Thank you, Elder Sister..."

Li Minggong could never bring herself to be truly harsh with her own family. Even though she was thoroughly disappointed in Li Chengzai, her tone was merely cold. "You are not young anymore. Stop scheming and causing trouble. Try to leave some dignity for the younger generation."

She lifted the two boys with her True Fire and rose into the sky. Li Suikuan, flying for the first time, was a mixture of joy and terror. Li Suining, long accustomed to it, was lost in thought.

'In my past life, I was too naive and didn't notice. But hearing her now, it's obvious Grand-Aunt knew a great deal about what was going on...'

Li Minggong did not stop there. She flew to several other towns, ensuring that the main family branches were all sending their children to the lake properly, without any bias or suppression. Only after gathering a number of children did she fly back toward the great lake.

Li Suining kept his head slightly bowed. He saw his brothers and sisters from his past life board the platform of fire, one by one. As he matched their faces to his memories, he realized with a pang of grief that nearly half of them would not even survive to adulthood, dying long before their time.

He silently held Li Suikuan's hand as the family's Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array appeared before them. Gazing at the mystical, purple-gold pillars wreathed in immortal mist, an infinite hope kindled in his heart.

'This life... will be different.'

He began to plan with cold precision.

'My cultivation was too slow... In my past life, it was far too slow. I must advance at a speed that will force the family masters to take my words seriously. Only then can I make a difference at the critical moments... and only then can I... uncover the truth behind everything.'

'Opportunities... I need opportunities... I'm afraid I will have to go to the Northern Sea. But it's too far. I must reach the Foundation Establishment Realm at the very least, just to have a chance of making it back alive!'

He had always been the most outstanding cultivator of the 'Sui' generation, strong in both combat and talent. His previous life, spent walking through mountains of corpses and seas of blood, had forged his mind into something calm and ruthless. It was that strength that had allowed him to bear the painful witness of his family's decline and destruction, and to finally earn Li Zhouming's trust.

'Until I reach Foundation Establishment... I can only rely on the family. I cannot be the humble, confused child I was in my past life. I must fight. I must contend. I must make the masters change their opinion of the Yuanwan Branch... and do it much sooner.'

'And... I must find a way... to save Ding Weizeng first. With that great general alive, it will be an enormous advantage for the future!'

His gaze was heavy, his mind deep in plotting. He was completely unaware that in the Great Void far above, threads of illusory, multicolored light were weaving together, reflecting his presence like water reflecting slivers of silver.

As he left the protection of the southern shore, a divine, searching power that had been hovering nearby instantly descended. It swept into his mind without hindrance, reading his memories one by one.

The power lingered until he passed into the mists of the Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array. Only then, having found nothing unusual, did it silently retreat. The changes in the Great Void subsided, fading back into emptiness.

...

### Gardenia Scenery Mountain

The sky was bright, and white petals drifted down like snow.

Two Daoist Masters sat facing each other. One, dressed in white and gold, sipped his tea without a word. The other, in green robes with a sword at his hip, had a far more relaxed air.

"Simin Prefecture has fallen as well?" the white-gold robed man asked.

Si Yuanli, looking quite composed, nodded. "It was your family's Jiangliang who was stationed there. Chen Wenyao is heading east. His target must be Linhai Prefecture."

"Linhai Prefecture..." Li Ximing mused. "The Great Xiukui Monastery has been in seclusion for many years. Linhai is still governed by the various local families. Though they've consolidated into a few larger clans, they are hardly a match for the current Chen Wenyao... It will be recovered by the master soon enough."

"Correct," Si Yuanli agreed. "Once that area is recovered, Purple Smoke will not be far behind. The general framework of Yue State is already taking shape. Hengzhu has fled into a Blessed Land. A few Guest Retainers from the Bi family and some members with diluted bloodlines are trying to manage the situation, but they'll be swept aside in an instant."

"But if Purple Smoke is recovered, I fear they will set their sights on the Wilderness."

Seeing Si Yuanli's worried expression, Li Ximing simply shook his head. "It matters not."

Si Yuanli nodded, then smiled. "The matter you asked me to look into... after all these years, I finally have news!"

"Oh?" Li Ximing's interest was piqued. "Is it Daoist Master Zhusheng?"

"Precisely!" Si Yuanli grinned, a hint of pride in his voice. "I couldn't find him anywhere in Shahuan. I searched for ages, but finally located him at a friend's residence in the Northern Sea. He was helping his friend refine talismans... He was overjoyed to receive your message."

"He also asked me to inquire with Zhaojing... about that Courtly Red Dust Qi..."

Courtly Red Dust Qi was difficult to collect. They had given a portion to the Purple Smoke Gate long ago, but now held two portions in reserve, which was more than enough for Zhusheng. Li Ximing nodded. "Does the Daoist Master have anything good to offer?"

Si Yuanli leaned in. "He has a lead on a Qilin-Crow Spirit Slough and a Bright Yang Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resource, Sub-Manifestation Platinum!"

"What!"

Li Ximing was genuinely stunned. The Qilin-Crow Spirit Slough was a famous Bright Yang spiritual item, one of the very first he had ever learned about!

Si Yuanli had expected this reaction. "This was something a Daoist Master under the command of the North Star Lady acquired from a grotto-heaven belonging to the Encompassing Profoundity tradition. In this day and age, the Qilin-Crow Spirit Slough is beyond rare. Every one used is one less in the world. It's even more precious than the Radiant Sky Stone was!"

Li Ximing knew this. It was far more valuable than any Li Fire spiritual item. It was easily one of the top three materials for forging Bright Yang spiritual armor. And on top of that, there was also the Sub-Manifestation Platinum!

Torn between regret that this opportunity hadn't come sooner and excitement, he asked, "Did Fellow Daoist Zhu say when he might acquire them?"

Si Yuanli considered this. "It will take at least ten days to half a month. He still needs to gather the resources for the trade... He said he will come to find you personally when he has them!"

"No rush, no rush!"

Since it was a Bright Yang item, Li Ximing could ask Qize about it first. At worst, he'd have to pay Dingyang Zi a higher fee. Even if it was too late for his own armor, it had many other uses—Li Zhouwei still needed a spiritual weapon, after all!

He was in an excellent mood, and Si Yuanli was pleased to have earned such a significant favor. Both parties were satisfied. Li Ximing retrieved a jade box from his sleeve and placed it on the table.

"Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder," he said simply. "Six pills."

Si Yuanli was overjoyed. He quickly opened the box. Inside, six pills rested neatly, emitting a faint cyan glow. It was indeed the Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder!

"Fellow Daoist's skill in alchemy is truly astounding!"

He was well aware that Li Ximing kept a portion for himself—that was the standard arrangement. If he had tried to refine it himself, he would have been lucky to get three pills... how could he complain about receiving six? It was a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Li Ximing, however, was hopeful. "This is the second batch you've had me refine from your Hollow-heart Profound Mulberry, correct? It seems you still have more on hand?"

Si Yuanli had inherited the vast wealth of the Sima Family; he was practically swimming in resources. This was already the second time he had come to refine the Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder—a pill whose primary ingredient was a spiritual item!

"This is really the last of it!" Si Yuanli smiled, his words only half-true.

Li Ximing figured there would be more business in the future. Satisfied, he watched as the Daoist Master quickly took his leave and departed on the wind.

Li Ximing then flicked his own sleeve, producing a small jade vial. It, too, contained Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder.

He could refine a full eight pills in one batch. After giving six to Si Yuanli, he had managed to save up four pills from the two sessions. He had consumed one himself recently, leaving him with three.

He gazed at the Immortal Foundation coalescing within his Qihai, a touch of regret in his heart.

'World's Radiance... It's truly not easy.'

While Li Zhouwei had been in seclusion healing for the past five years, Li Ximing had successfully cultivated his 'World's Radiance' Immortal Foundation to perfection and pushed it into his Shengyang Acupoint. But, just as he had feared, the attempt to elevate it had failed.

Though his hopes were dashed, Li Ximing wasn't overly dismayed. In fact, the failure had answered a question that had been weighing on him:

'Even if the elevation of the Immortal Foundation fails, the Profound Pattern Vase within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance _still_ releases Talisman Qi to bless the Immortal Foundation!'

He had expected this, but when the wisp of Talisman Qi had actually descended onto his foundation, he had been overcome with relief and joy.

'From now on, I don't need to be so hesitant!'

The only downside was the loss of one portion of Luminous Heart Origin Qi. Fortunately, the Courtly Red Dust Qi had been valuable back then, and Tinglan's Luminous Heart Origin Qi had come in a set of three. He still had enough for now.

'With the Purple Smoke Gate blockaded, that resource supply is cut off... Zhouwei succeeded on his very first try. Surely I won't fail all three attempts... This is only for my second divine ability. Three failures... for any other Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, that would mean thirty to fifty years vanishing in the blink of an eye...'

A flicker of anxiety passed through him, but he quickly composed himself.

"And with the Empty-Sleeve Profound Dao Powder to assist, the time it takes to re-condense the Immortal Foundation is extremely short... At the absolute worst, I'll just swap out the Clear-Through Eternal Celebration Scripture in the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance."

In any case, the matter of the spiritual armor could not be delayed. He called out, "Is Minggong still on the lake?"

A voice immediately answered from below. "Reporting to the Daoist Master... Lady Minggong has gone to the lake's perimeter..."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

The attendant, knowing his station, was quick-witted and of good standing. He hastily elaborated, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, in a few days, it will be time for the new disciples to enter the island to cultivate. Her ladyship has likely gone to the shore to receive them early!"

"Oh?" A nostalgic look crossed Li Ximing's face. "That would be the 'Sui' generation, wouldn't it? Minggong has always been so dedicated..."

Li Minggong had always been responsible for liaising with Sun-Worshipping Mountain. First, her status was sufficient for the task, and second, she was familiar with them. Li Ximing had never bothered to replace her. He smiled and rose to his feet, placing the jade slip in his hand back on the desk.

"Perfect," he said with interest. "I'll go and take a look."
