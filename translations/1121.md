# Chapter 1121: The Weakening of the Mansion

Li Ximing saw the two Daoist Masters off. By the time he was done, the sky had already darkened. The buildings across the island were a patchwork of light and shadow, bustling with figures.

The Li family, of course, had no intention of inviting those two into the Wave-Suppressing Mansion. Only now did Li Ximing ride the wind down, entering the cave dwelling of interwoven black, white, and azure. At its center, the pool of Wall-Sinking Water had turned a pure, uniform white. It was clearly ready for harvest.

'Yehui gave one pool of Wall-Sinking Water, and what was used here only amounted to two portions. Once I collect this second portion, and the two Neck Feathers are in my bag, this source will be exhausted.'

'Grandfather's situation cost one Golden Branch of the Late Tassel and one Neck Feathers... I suppose this balances things out.'

He looked up just as Liu Changdie was leading someone inside. Spotting him, Liu Changdie smiled.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing! Come, let me introduce you!"

Li Ximing looked over. The Daoist Master following Liu Changdie was quite short, only reaching his shoulder. Her long hair was tied back, and she had a delicate, gentle appearance, yet her eyes held a profound depth. With every step, she seemed to carry the sound of a gurgling spring.

Before he could speak, the woman had already bowed with a smile.

"Bao Xiang of Bojun Mountain greets Senior!"

Neither of the previous Daoist Masters had been permitted to enter this place, yet Liu Changdie had brought Daoist Master Bao Xiang back without hesitation. Clearly, he held her in extremely high trust.

This immediately gave Li Ximing a favorable impression. Seeing how young she appeared, he returned the bow politely, intending to treat her as a peer. But Liu Changdie chuckled.

"This child only broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm two years ago. She's the junior of a friend of mine, so she should rightly call you Senior!"

Hearing the name Bojun Mountain, Li Ximing understood. Liu Changdie had taken the Western Sea matter to heart and made contact in advance. Secretly grateful, he smiled.

"Truly, the younger generation is full of outstanding talent!"

The Daoist Master quickly demurred, but Liu Changdie continued seriously,

"She cultivates Pit Water, follows the Heavenly Embryo Dao, and is supported by a Diverse Mansion. Her divine ability is Holding the Ridge. She comes from a distinguished lineage!"

He paused, then added, "Regarding the Western Sea... I'll have this junior guide you."

Li Ximing thanked him.

"I must still rely on Senior's guidance."

Liu Changdie turned, and they sat down together. He poured tea, his voice growing distant.

"The Western Sea... it isn't just one sea. 'The Various Seas' would be more fitting. If you travel northwest from the highlands, past Great Yona, you'll find a sea-like basin named the Beigao Leizhu Sea, as vast as the Great Shu region. Cross a few mountain ranges, and you'll find another sea of similar size, the Taihai. Great Tazi lies between them."

"Only after crossing the Taihai do you reach the heart of the Western Sea, called the Fuzhong Sea. It's larger than Jiangnan, comparable to the Zhulu region. This is what most people simply call the Western Sea."

Liu Changdie smiled.

"This Western Sea is peculiar. It's encircled by mountains and islands, much like a giant pool, yet it's filled with saltwater. It is precisely this strange geography, embodying the essence of a lake or marsh, that earned it the favor of Mansion Water. It was the first place Mansion Water was verified, its primary symbolic domain!"

Li Ximing had visited Great Tazi some time ago. He vividly remembered the turban-wearing westerners. But he had only traveled between the Beigao Leizhu Sea and the Taihai, never venturing further west. He had long heard rumors of the connection between the Western Sea and Mansion Water, but only now understood the reason. He marveled,

"No wonder Mansion Water favors it! To think a great sea exists, landlocked like that!"

In truth, it wasn't the only such place. Li Ximing's first thought was of Lake Xian, the familiar salt lake in Jiangnan. Legend held it was left behind from a battle between great powers; it, too, was like a lake but connected to the sea, carrying the symbolism of Mansion Water. That was why Li Wushao, who cultivated Mansion Water, had coveted the place before being dragged back by his uncle, Li Yuanjiao.

"Back then, Moongaze Marsh was already considered a holy land for Mansion Water. If there was a lake as vast as a sea... I can't imagine how much favor it would receive!"

Liu Changdie nodded at his words. Bao Xiang, having listened quietly, spoke up thoughtfully.

"In the past, Mansion Water had two major branches, often seen as an immortal and a demonic division. One branch was located on an ancient mountain not far from the Beigao Leizhu Sea, controlling the powers of the Weak Water branch. This is the 'Weak Water' most Xia people traditionally imagine. The other branch was here in the Western Sea, controlling the vast, oceanic power of Mansion Water."

"Back then, the Western Sea was far more formidable than it is today, rich in spiritual qi. Because it governed the vastness of Mansion Water, the specific mysteries of Weak Water weren't as apparent. It was an incredibly glorious place. Far from the mainland, it was beyond the notice of the great powers, and its inhabitants were not Xia people, so it wasn't bound by so many dogmatic traditions. It was a sanctuary for demonic cultivators... A great nation, Daqin, was even built around this sea, and it, too, raised storms of blood..."

"Later, some great change—a dispute related to the Dragon-kin—occurred. After that, the ancient immortal mountain vanished, and the connection between the Western Sea and Mansion Water grew tenuous. Furthermore, the power of Weak Water spun out of control. It rampaged, unable to be unified or transcended, and so it declined year after year."

She seemed to have a deep understanding of these matters, explaining them with simple clarity. Li Ximing grew pensive.

"So the division between Mansion Water and Weak Water... it began that long ago."

The woman smiled.

"Indeed. Cultivators in the Western Sea have no concept of 'Weak Water'. Only high-level cultivators from the mainland use that term."

The Li family had heard the name Weak Water very early on, from Yang Xiao'er. That imperial descendant with ties to the Underworld had mentioned it casually, cementing the impression of 'Weak Water' in their minds.

But Li Ximing recalled something with sudden clarity:

'Why does Mansion Water not verify? It only hates the beast that seized the abyss. The Profound Giant Turtle lost the Vast Ocean. Henceforth, their natures are hard to unite!'

Those were words from the original master of the Wave-Suppressing Mansion!

'Given the sheer size of the Western Sea, it must correspond to Mansion Water's 'Vast Ocean'! It's highly probable that Mansion Water was decoupled from the Vast Ocean. Its authority shrank, confined only to lakes and marshes. That must be why the Western Sea lost its connection to Mansion Water!'

'I fear that the 'great change' she mentioned... was the very 'abyss-seizing' event that allowed Pit Water to claim the Vast Ocean!'

His heart sank. This new understanding of Mansion Water left him pensive and silent for a long time. His silence eventually prompted the woman to venture,

"I hear Senior is interested in the Western Sea's situation and the Wall-Sinking Water... This junior may have a suggestion or two..."

Li Ximing's eyes brightened.

"Please, go on!"

Daoist Master Bao Xiang said, "Wall-Sinking Water isn't exceptionally precious, but gathering a large amount is difficult. If you require a steady supply, it's best to have the Xinggong Terrace manage it... We can discuss the details."

"As for the situation..."

Liu Changdie, quiet until now, set down his cup.

"On Small Guang Kong Mountain, there is a De'ai Temple. Its master is Host Shehu. He and I have some old grudges. The spiritual water he possesses is also what Daoist Master Zhaojing requires. That is why we are here."

Li Ximing filed the name away. Bao Xiang's brow furrowed.

"Junior understands... But Host Shehu is a friend of the West Mansion Grotto Sect... I urge both Seniors to reconsider and proceed with caution."

Bao Xiang was no fool; she had detected the killing intent in Liu Changdie's tone. This matter was dangerous. If anything went wrong, she, having assisted them, could be dragged down as well. She would never have involved herself if anyone but Liu Changdie had asked.

Liu Changdie met his gaze and sent a voice transmission.

'We'll proceed as Zhaojing arranges. My enmity with Shehu isn't that deep. If we must dispose of him, it's not a major affair. But it must be fast and ruthless. If it drags on, someone will certainly come to his rescue.'

'His cultivation isn't high, but he has two divine abilities and cultivates Upright Wood. Are you confident?'

Li Ximing had plenty of assets to call on. With unrelated figures like Yan Dushui and Guo Nanwu providing support from the sidelines, there were countless schemes he could employ. Adding in several Spiritual Treasures and Li Zhouwei himself, their target couldn't escape even if he grew wings. He simply replied,

'You can be completely at ease.'

Li Ximing replied, then smiled at Bao Xiang.

"I'll trouble you to make the arrangements. I will find the right moment to act... If reconciliation is truly impossible, someone will naturally be there to dispose of him."

Daoist Master Bao Xiang considered this silently for a moment before nodding.

"Junior understands."

...

A fierce wind howled under heavy black clouds.

The Qi region was vast, its lands open, sprawling above the Jianghuai region. It had been a strategic heartland for generations. But in the current Zhao State, the Qi territory promised to the Gao family was fractured and incomplete.

'The east is held by Yan, the west is ruled by Zhao. The center of power, Mount Dayang, is occupied by Buddhist cultivators. The Gao clan only received the eastern territories. Although they are the foremost clan in Qi... their position is precarious.'

Gazing at the dim earth below, the man silently shook his head.

'The only saving grace is the Yue Cultivating Sect's Profound Truth Mountain to the south. Though the Yue Cultivating Sect is reclusive, it controls enough land to form a natural buffer, preventing the Gao family from having direct contact with Jianghuai. This affords them a small measure of freedom.'

Wind and rain lashed the normally peaceful Prefecture city, shrouding it in darkness. A man riding a profound light descended, halting in mid-air. A long-faced man in golden robes immediately flew up to greet him, his voice low.

"Senior Touba honors us with your presence. Please forgive my failure to welcome you properly!"

"Ah, Yingge. It has indeed been many years."

The man on the profound light was none other than the Dai King's own brother, the Great Daoist Master Touba Qiye, who had previously gone to Luoxia to meet Yao Guanyi.

Though the Great Daoist Master's tone was cordial, Shilou Yingge remained inwardly guarded. He smiled deferentially.

"My Great King has been awaiting your arrival."

The two Purple Mansion Realm experts, one leading, one following, descended toward a palace from which True Fire pulsed and leaped. Inside, golden light shone from everywhere. They passed through vermilion gates, one after another, traversing four grand halls, past a silver dais of rising dragons and twelve fractured pillars, all awash in brilliant color.

Atop a throne blazing with True Fire sat a man. He wore a snow-white upper garment and bright red robes. His build was powerful, his eyebrows thick, and his beard full.

This was the Valiant King, Gao Fu.

Waves of blazing light rippled behind him, illuminating the hall as if he were a deity. Shockingly, he had already surpassed the Purple Mystery and become a Great Daoist Master of the True Fire Dao.

Touba Qiye studied him quietly for a moment.

"Congratulations."

Gao Fu's eyes, turned crimson by the flames, met his. His voice was calm.

"I am nearly seventy years behind you, my friend. What is there to celebrate?"

Shilou Yingge had already retreated to one side. Touba Qiye chuckled, clasping his hands behind his back.

"My Touba family follows the Great Dao of Profound Qi; the Golden Core stage is merely the beginning. How can it be compared to ordinary traditions? The Valiant King shoulders the burdens of royalty and has cultivated the Great Dao of True Fire. The two are not comparable."

Gao Fu stared at him.

"You are too modest. I wonder, how is the Dai King?"

Touba Qiye spoke without reservation.

"His divine ability is perfected. He is but one step from the Quest for Gold."

"Waiting for the True Qi to return to its position?"

Hearing the Valiant King's question, Touba Qiye replied softly,

"Not necessarily. Whether it returns or not, my brother will continue seeking the Dao. It's just a matter of waiting for the right moment. If there is no True Qi, there are other paths. He will not be led by the nose by those great figures. And what if it never returns?"

Gao Fu stroked his beard.

"In that, I am his inferior."

This admission gave Touba Qiye a complicated expression. Had anyone else said it, he would have taken it as a matter of course. But hearing it from Gao Fu, he felt no arrogance, only a complex mix of emotions. After a long pause, he said:

"My brother often says that the world sees a new wave of dragons rising. While this is due to five hundred years of peace and a rich spiritual environment... it is also a matter of circumstance and destiny. The only things the Valiant King lacks... are birthright and timing."

"If this were ancient times..."

Before he could finish, Gao Fu, still seated, waved his hand.

"The world is full of heroes, but one must seize the right moment to leap the dragon gate. Heaven's mandate does not lie with True Fire. What good is one person's talent? Look at today's Xiao Chuting and Chi Buzi, or the earlier Duanmu Kui and Si Boxiu. Which of them was not a figure of astonishing talent?"

"Moreover... the difficulty of attaining the True Fire Dao is rivaled only by that of Mansion Water."

Gao Fu smiled faintly.

"I know I cannot compare to that Great Demon Tianzhi, who could generate light from the darkness, attracting the master of the Tree of One Heart to observe his ceremony. Even he has not succeeded, so what hope is there for a minor cultivator like me, whose path is all but severed?"

Touba Qiye fell silent. Gao Fu, however, changed the subject with a smile.

"So, you were reprimanded by Lord Yao."

At the mention of this, Touba Qiye's eye twitched. His expression turned gloomy.

"It was merely a warning."

Gao Fu easily read the true meaning.

'The dharma body wasn't the point. The point is that the Touba family has been making too many moves, acting restlessly. Yao Guanyi just used that incident as a pretext to warn him.'

The Valiant King rose and slowly paced down from the high dais. He stopped before Touba Qiye.

"Since that is the case, why has Daoist Friend Touba come to my Gao family today?"

Touba Qiye was silent for a long time before finally speaking.

"The Dai State will be increasing its involvement. I will be leading men to Yunzhong Prefecture to act as a flanking force for Yan, to help pin down King Wei."

The gloom on his face faded, replaced by a cold anger.

"In the meantime, Touba Ci will go south. He is to be commissioned as a general of Zhao State, his life and death no longer the concern of Shengle Heaven. And your Gao clan... you are to dispatch someone to go with him, to fight at his side."

A flicker of coldness passed through Gao Fu's eyes, though he seemed unsurprised by the command. His smile remained.

"Oh? So you must enter the fray as well? How many Great Daoist Masters does that make, prepared for 'His Highness'? Not even the Wei Crown Prince of old enjoyed such favor!"

Hearing the words "His Highness," Shilou Yingge snapped his head up. Touba Qiye looked even more incredulous, his intended words catching in his throat. After a long moment, he said in a low voice,

"Yingge's actions years ago, though hidden within the grotto-heaven, were not hidden from those great figures. Whether your injuries were real or feigned, they saw right through your little scheme. The Lotus Temple remains safe only because Jinlian has powerful backing!"

"And now... they sent _me_ to deliver this message. Is the meaning not obvious enough?!"

Gao Fu stood with his hands clasped behind him, offering no reply. Touba Qiye's expression was fraught.

"Brother Gao Fu... you must think this through, very carefully!"
