# Chapter 1074: 1071 - The Pieces Fall into Place

‘Manifestations Earth.’

Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain was originally named Tangdao Mountain. It was a sharp peak rising from the flattest part of the Huai River region, originally surging with a metal-aspected qi that pointed to the sky like a long saber. Later, it was altered by Primordial Magnetism, and its metal qi dissolved, causing it to lose its edge.

When Li Ximing arrived at Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain, the place was almost unrecognizable. The hills were smooth, without any sharp edges. A rolling malignant qi clung to the ground like a thin fog, breathing endlessly.

‘It lost its sharp edge but gained in height. This mountain is still majestic, even more so than before. It has the feel of a famous immortal mountain.’

His fingertips brushed together, and he restrained the Light of the Six Harmonies, his heart pounding.

‘So this is the way of Manifestations Earth!’

Malignant qi was a substance normally bound deep within the earth veins. It would never surface unless a mountain collapsed, the earth split, or a spring brought it forth. Back when the Li clan moved Mount Qingdu, they had disturbed the earth veins, unleashing a pillar of malignant qi.

But now, the earth and stone of Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain were disintegrating. Though the mountain was imposing, the flow of malignant qi had riddled it with thousands of holes. Tiny, shifting fissures appeared everywhere. Small bursts of silver-black light leaped from the earth veins, scattering the last vestiges of metal qi.

‘Metal emerges from malice, malice departs from the earth.’

Li Ximing was lost in thought.

‘Manifestations Earth has been silent for many years. The few rumors I’ve heard spoke of it being “Adamantine-indestructible and lightning-proof”… Lightning-proof is to be expected. “Adamantine-indestructible” must refer to its ability to vent and release metal qi. By becoming neither hard nor soft, it cannot be destroyed.’

By this time, Sima Yuanli had already been dispatched to scout the area, leaving only Li Ximing and Tianque to ride the wind, landing softly on the great bronze hall atop the peak.

He waited a moment, then quietly tucked his hands into his sleeves. Thunder roared in the sky, and amidst the heavy darkness, a set of bronze steps appeared. Yang Ruiyi was descending. He cupped his fist in greeting.

“Daoist Friend Zhang, you’ve arrived just in time!”

Tianque, who had been indifferent when speaking of the Yang clan earlier, now wore a smile. He spoke with enthusiasm,

“Many thanks, my lord! You have truly resolved a great difficulty weighing on my Dao-heart!”

His words were warm, but having heard his earlier comments, Li Ximing sensed the truth. He knew Tianque was not happy; the warmth was only on the surface.

Yang Ruiyi nodded slightly, a hint of a smile in his eyes.

“I must trouble Daoist Friend Zhang to guard the mountain.”

Tianque didn't hesitate. He raised an eyebrow and said,

“Rest assured, General. In the attack on Zhao, Shu and Song are of one mind. Tianhuo is already outside with Danyin and Duanyan. My uncle, Daoist Master Chunshuo, is also standing watch in the Great Void, holding the Pearl of Cardiac Rhythm.”

His expression was calm and natural, displaying the invisible foundation and pride of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition. He continued casually, “With my Golden Oneness and the Highest Azure Daoist tradition making a move together, there isn't a single Daoist Tradition in the world that would dare claim they could take Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain in an instant!”

The Golden Feather Sect was backed by True Monarch Taiyuan. Golden Oneness and Highest Azure were intertwined, their true, hidden depths unfathomable! Those with high talent were taken into their grotto-heavens, while those with strong character were sent out to control various regions. Tianque's pride was not baseless; it was no exaggeration at all.

Yang Ruiyi smiled. He made no effort to hide the conversation from Li Ximing as he sat down in the hall.

“It’s strange that such a major event wasn't enough to disturb Senior Yi Ge. And I don’t see Senior Tiandong—calculating the time, even if he reincarnated… he should have reached the Purple Mansion Realm by now.”

Tianque fell silent for a moment before replying in a low voice, 

“Disciple-brother… he fell many years ago.”

Yang Ruiyi paused, clearly skeptical.

‘Tiandong cultivated Earth Virtue and had exceptional talent. He wouldn't just die for no reason. He certainly wouldn't have been breaking through within the Golden Oneness grotto-heaven when he “fell years ago.”’

There wasn't much more for the two to say. Tianque cut straight to the point, his expression grave.

“When will the metal qi at the summit be completely purged? Do you require our assistance?”

Yang Ruiyi answered calmly,

“There is no need to trouble you. It will be resolved in three days.”

Tianque's expression softened. He said no more, simply cupped his fist.

“Many thanks, my lord.”

He then stepped into the Great Void and departed without another word, leaving Yang Ruiyi standing in the hall with a heavy heart. Li Ximing saw that their conversation had not gone well and sighed internally.

‘The Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition is ultimately under Luoxia's jurisdiction; they can’t get close to the Underworld… Even if Yang Ruiyi schemed to force Tianque into this, he still has to put on a pleasant face out of necessity…’

‘Three days… Tianque is also under pressure from Mount Changhuai. Yang Ruiyi doesn't have much time to maneuver, either.’

“Congratulations, my lord, on conquering Tangdao!”

Yang Ruiyi turned to look at him, a flicker of surprise in his eyes.

“Zhaojing cultivated a wondrous art of rebirth!”

Li Ximing froze. He had concealed himself with Sealing the Life-Mandate, yet Yang Ruiyi had seen through him with a single glance. He returned the bow and forced a smile.

“It is merely a trick to preserve a limb. Before your noble clan, it is truly a laughingstock!”

The Yang clan had ties to the Underworld. When it came to rebirth, perhaps only Overseas Penglai could offer an opinion. The rest of Jiangnan wasn't even qualified to carry their shoes. For Yang Ruiyi to immediately identify it as a "wondrous art of rebirth" made Li Ximing sweat.

Yang Ruiyi shook his head quietly.

“My family has an advantage due to our proximity, and we possess one or two related arts. But we also know that few such arts still circulate in the world. To be able to preserve a limb is already extremely difficult. As for true rebirth, it is impossible for anyone who has not seized heavenly fate and walked the path of golden fortune.”

He seemed somewhat emotional as he continued,

“In the entire Yue State… the only one I can think of who has the ability to be reborn safely and enjoy another five hundred years of life is King Wei.”

Li Ximing avoided the probe, sighing instead.

“If there were a Great Dao Practitioner who could reincarnate with every era, avoiding heavenly fate and eluding calamities, what kind of figure would they be today?”

Yang Ruiyi showed no particular reaction, just gave a wry laugh.

“Forget about it before the Celestial Shift. And even after the Celestial Shift… it is exceedingly difficult. The path of rebirth is severely constrained by Exiled Qi, and with no Merging Owl or Upper Shaman appearing in the world… even if the Underworld doesn't interfere, a single rebirth is as hard as ascending to heaven. Even if one succeeds… there are endless troubles. A second time is unthinkable, let alone trying to attain the Dao.”

His gaze swept over Li Ximing, as if searching for something. Having read the "Marvelous Method of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body," Li Ximing understood a great deal about rebirth and knew Yang Ruiyi was reminding him (as Li Zhouwei) of the dangers. He dodged the topic again.

“It seems I was thinking too simply!”

Yang Ruiyi smiled, his expression turning serious.

“I must trouble Zhaojing… The calamity on the lake has passed, but the north still needs your help. I wish to send a Daoist Master to lead troops and suppress Caishan, coordinating with Tangdao and Xiaoshi. After thinking it over, Zhaojing is the only one for the task!”

Li Ximing knew things were far from over; there was no chance he was being sent home. He replied with concern,

“I will obey your command… It’s just… my lord, you must be cautious here at Tangdao Mountain!”

Li Ximing would not be at Moongaze Lake. He naturally hoped Yang Ruiyi could hold Tangdao Mountain securely. If this place fell, Caishan would be in grave danger, and the situation at the lake would become even more troublesome.

Yang Ruiyi nodded slightly, understanding the stakes. He smiled.

“Caishan has already been taken by Daoist Master Chengqian, a disciple of Daoist Master Xianyao from Overlook Peak. Ximing need not be hasty, lest you rush into a trap. Be careful on the road. Whether you meet up with him or encounter trouble, you must report to me first.”

“Your clan’s two young masters are both extraordinarily gifted. I have already petitioned the Emperor to have the General guard the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter, while Zhishi and I watch over the Wilderness. This will ensure the lake remains secure.”

He added a warning,

“Your clan's young masters are greatly coveted by the Buddhist cultivators. It is not suitable for them to be at checkpoints like Xiaoshi, Caishan, or Bianyan. I will be in the Wilderness, and as long as Tangdao Mountain and the Wilderness do not fall, the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter is extremely safe. They cannot be harmed in one fell swoop.”

‘Yang Ruiyi isn't guarding Tangdao Mountain himself?’

Li Ximing was momentarily stunned. He quickly stammered his thanks. Yang Ruiyi waved his hand, as if knowing what he was about to ask.

“Tangdao Mountain will be guarded by someone.”

Seeing that Yang Ruiyi seemed unconcerned and was more worried about the Buddhist cultivators trying some unexpected tricks, Li Ximing understood. He silently agreed, retreated from the mountain, and left, entering the Great Void and hurrying away. Not long after, a purple cloud drifted over. Tinglan had arrived.

Tinglan had been unharmed in the great battle and was in good condition. She anxiously entered the bronze hall and bowed.

“Greetings, my lord!”

The great hall was as dark as ever. The only difference was that the previously bare, polished round table now held a golden scroll, painted with five-colored water and fire on a purple-blue background with gold patterns.

Beside the scroll, a ritual implement shaped like a broken sword lay on a jade plate. It was carved with coiling serpents of water and fire, had a texture like gold and jade, and emitted a faint glow.

Facing Tinglan, Yang Ruiyi was no longer as polite as he had been with Li Ximing; he was much more casual. Tinglan reported,

“Daoist Master Hongyan of the Western Shu Ni Clan has arrived at Xiaoshi. I was ordered to hand over the territory, ceding Xiaoshi to Western Shu…”

The situation had forced Yang Ruiyi's hand. He had to concede to Shu, giving one of Huai River's most important towns, Xiaoshi, to Qing Jifeng. While it was a pity, it also distributed the pressure and appeased Western Shu… After all, Golden Feather was, at its root, one of theirs.

Yang Ruiyi nodded slightly, his hand moving as he performed a divination art. Tinglan waited quietly for a moment, but finally couldn't hold back.

“Shanji has requested aid three times… If we sit by and watch, I fear the surrounding areas will be endangered!”

Tinglan wasn't just thinking of his Song State. Her own Daoist Master Wenqing was still fighting at Shanji. If anything happened to her, her blessed land's only promising heir would be lost.

Yang Ruiyi turned his head to look at her.

“They have already been allowed to break out. Take this Tablet of Proclaimed Might. Go to Yufu at once, announce the Emperor's decree, and deliver this item.”

Tinglan was startled. She first accepted the order, then asked, “Deliver it to whom… Please instruct me, my lord.”

Yang Ruiyi said, “When you reach Shanji and proclaim the decree, you will know.”

---

Darkness swirled.

A ball of flame bloomed in the Great Void. Daoist Master Tianque rode the spiritual fire, descending. He saw a Daoist priest standing in the Great Void, wearing a tall crown and white robes, his hands forming a seal, seemingly cut off from the world in meditation. His features were remarkably similar to the Zhang Yun of years past.

“Uncle!”

In the distance, a brilliant golden cloud churned, rumbling with faint thunder. Chunshuo turned his head, but his gaze remained fixed on that golden cloud. His expression was calm.

“What was Lord Yang’s reply?”

Tianque cupped his fist.

“Three days.”

This news clearly brought a measure of relief to Chunshuo’s face. He said in a low voice,

“The Underworld is still proud, unwilling to make things too ugly… Duanyan and I had discussed it and thought it would be at least thirty days. Now… it makes us look petty.”

“With this matter resolved… Tianyi can also focus on seeking the Dao.”

The Tianyi he spoke of was none other than the one known in Jiangnan as Daoist Master Qiushui!

Daoist Master Chunshuo cultivated within his grotto-heaven year-round, never involving himself in worldly affairs, focusing only on his Daoist cultivation. His temperament was naturally more magnanimous. Tianque, on the other hand, was not such a generous person. He just shook his head.

“I think it’s appropriate. It is not the time for contact. Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain is a good move, but even if the excuse is sufficient, we still have to give the Qing family an explanation.”

His expression flickered, and he lowered his head.

“I saw the World's Radiance that Li Ximing achieved.”

Daoist Master Chunshuo immediately turned his head, his focus absolute. Tianque continued,

“It is indeed the one Tinglan had!”

Chunshuo’s expression was unreadable.

“Tinglan? That Scripture of the Monarch's Luminous Heart? So what?”

Tianque nodded, stepped forward, and replied in a similarly low voice,

“Uncle, you have been cultivating in the sect for many years. This is how it is… During the Wei era, the Cui Clan was full of talents, many with outstanding divine abilities. But they lacked one key divine ability—this World's Radiance—that only royalty could cultivate to achieve perfection. So, the Wei Emperor bestowed upon them the Scripture of the Monarch's Luminous Heart, which could ‘supplement deficiencies and observe the hearts of subjects’…”

“But the Scripture of the Monarch's Luminous Heart must be personally bestowed by the Emperor, or cultivated by one of imperial status, for the 'ordination' to be correct. If a commoner steals the scripture, they lack the proper status and cannot cultivate the divine ability. There are also many drawbacks.”

“And the Cui Clan modified it… Cui Niexiang took the ‘Sutra of the Imperial Command for Mortal Awakening’ from Li Guangheng’s mansion and gave it to Li Li. He used this forbidden secret art to perfect the Scripture of the Monarch's Luminous Heart. Although the World's Radiance could then be cultivated, the ‘ordination calamity’ remained, accompanying it always…”

Daoist Master Chunshuo narrowed his eyes. He took a golden seal from his sleeve, tossed it into the air, and sent it to suppress the rolling golden light, stabilizing the situation. Only then did he turn back.

“So this Li Ximing is a Wei descendant. It’s normal for him to succeed.”

Tianque shook his head, hesitating.

“Uncle, you don't understand. This ordination doesn't just require imperial blood; it requires an extremely high status. Back then, when the Liang prince Touba Jun was attuning to the Supreme Yang, it was the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch who ‘dotted’ this World's Radiance for him. Although he failed, it proves that even if one is not a prince, one must be ‘dotted’ by a major figure…”

“But Li Ximing cannot be a prince. According to Tianyi’s deductions, in the entire Li clan, only Li Zhouwei and those few with golden eyes are close enough to royalty to cultivate this art without issue…”

Daoist Master Chunshuo raised an eyebrow, already understanding his meaning. 

“You think someone ‘dotted’ him?”

Tianque said, “I suspect… someone wants to protect Li Ximing from the Bright Yang calamity.”

Daoist Master Chunshuo was silent for a moment, then shook his head.

“I doubt it. If you said Li Zhouluo, I might believe it. What’s so special about Li Ximing? I heard his fire control art is excellent, but what does that amount to?”

Tianque sighed.

“This junior feels this is a bad sign… If the Underworld is already making these moves to repay favors to the Li Clan, it means the Bright Yang losses are far more severe than we imagined. The event may be extremely sudden… it won't be delayed for long.”

Daoist Master Chunshuo pressed his palms together.

“No need to overthink. The True Monarch has long had a plan… Back then, when that boy Zhang Yun requested to assign Duanyan to the Li family, it was the Golden Order that stopped it. Only today do we understand the True Monarch’s intentions. We are but minor cultivators. How can we know the Mandate of Heaven? How can we know the True Monarch's plan?”

Tianque was silent. He had once thought the same as Daoist Master Chunshuo, but after spending so much time in the outside world, his perspective had slowly changed. He shook his head inwardly.

‘Uncle truly has the Highest Azure mindset…’

Tianhuo’s words echoed in his ears. That 'child' was much younger than him, but his words chilled the bone:

‘The True Monarch is certainly immortal. But if we wait for him to arrange everything, what are we here for?’

---

Dark clouds obscured the sun. The world was dim.

In a ghostly domain of the Underworld, countless skeletons and wraiths were piled into mountains. A faint golden light flickered like a weak candle in the gloom.

Daoist Master Changyun stood in the darkness. The thousands of owls, demons, and black crows that had been circling overhead had all fallen to the ground, feet in the air, feathers disheveled. The whistling ghostly wind had stopped. There was only silence.

Large and small holes tore through the pitch-black sky, like a burnt sack, letting in streams of Heavenly Light. Enormous golden-bodied figures stood silently outside the ghost domain.

In the distance, the light of Manifestations Earth shot into the sky, its autumn clouds as white as snow, causing the assembled Merciful One(s) to bow their heads, not daring to speak.

The bronze Underworld palanquin that had been floating in the sky had long since crashed, sinking into the ruins. Bronze ancient lamps lay toppled. On the steps, covered in dents, stood a young monk. His body was of normal size, and he held a bronze alms bowl.

All the golden-bodied figures in the world fell silent, waiting for the young monk to turn his head. His gaze was grim and terrifying as it fixed on the kneeling, battered Mingxiang.

“Great Monk Mingxiang… the one who besieged you for so long… was just a ghost from that bronze palanquin?”

Mingxiang looked heavily injured. His voice was grave. ]

“My lord… Yang Ruiyi appeared, destroyed my junior brother’s dharma body… then grievously wounded me and forced me into a desperate situation! If not for Daoist Master Changyun’s rescue, this lowly one would already be dead! Seeing his plan succeed, he used a ghost to pilot the palanquin and escape in secret… Hidden by Exiled Qi, forget a minor cultivator like me, even my Master would not have seen through it!”

Jiang Toushou had long known that Lotus Temple had its own schemes. He had intended to use Yang Ruiyi’s hand to eliminate them, so how could he admit that? Anger rose in his heart, but he saw Mingxiang’s eyes streaming with tears.

“Under the influence of Exiled Qi, one’s life can be lost at any moment. How could Mingxiang dare to have selfish thoughts! If not for the Treasured Artifact Master bestowed upon me before leaving, my junior brother would be dead! I could only do my best to defend myself, how could I spare attention for anything else!”

He raised his head, trying to redirect the blame.

“Mingxiang was also a victim. Who is it that wishes to destroy our Buddhist cultivators’ Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain? My lord, please see the truth!”

Jiang Toushou had met Mingxiang several times on Mount Dayang. To put it bluntly, he was the only sensible one from Lotus Temple. He was somewhat credible. For a moment, Jiang Toushou couldn't tell how much was truth and how much was a lie. He turned to Daoist Master Changyun, his voice chilling.

“Good… very good. Then Daoist Master Changyun… you are proficient in the Immortal Dao, your divine abilities are sharp. You didn't notice anything either?”

Daoist Master Changyun was, strictly speaking, a member of the Profound Governance Pavilion. He had long since assessed the situation. He crossed his arms and sneered, suddenly opening his eyes. His empty sockets stared at Jiang Toushou as he said flatly:

“I am blind. Is Jiang Toushou blind, too?”

His words were a double entendre. The young monk’s face darkened, but he understood. He laughed from sheer anger.

“Qi Lanyan… what a fine scheme!”

Daoist Master Changyun shrugged, happy to let Qi Lanyan take the blame. He stepped grandly into the Great Void, leaving a mocking, cold voice behind.

“I will be sure to pass on the message!”

The young monk’s eyes grew darker. After a while, a Merciful One hurried up, trembling.

“My lord… Lord Vast Cicada has brought his people back. They have crossed Baijiang Creek and are at Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain… The fighting has already begun.”

Jiang Toushou closed his eyes and exhaled heavily, sneering.

“He doesn't dare come see me!”

The Merciful One hesitated, conflicted. He took a step forward.

“Shall we proceed…”

Jiang Toushou suddenly lashed out, slapping the Merciful One to the ground.

“Go where!” he spat. “The Golden Feather Sect is already there! What is there to go to!”

He cursed for a while, then retracted his hand. The face of Tian Langzhi, the Maha Liangli of the Great Desire Dao, suddenly appeared in his mind. His vexation grew, and his expression turned colder.

‘Tian Langzhi’s sudden withdrawal from Long was not without reason… Qi Lanyan isn't the only one scheming against me. The Seven Aspects are almost certainly watching from the sidelines, waiting for my Mount Dayang to suffer…’

The monk stood in place for a long time before finally saying coldly,

“Go to Mount Bianyan.”

---

Shanji.

Wind and clouds gathered at the zenith, water and fire churning. The plains below were a dull, hazy gray. The light of the great array shone like a glass barrier, but it offered no sense of security. A man stood on the mountain, head bowed, motionless.

He was tall, with gaunt cheeks. Though his head was low, his expression was grim. He stood alone, holding a jade pot, as if he had just come to refill the tea. This was the Sect Master of Profound Peak, Kong Xiaxiang.

Beside him, Kong Tingyun sat leaning against a jade table that glowed with white light. She gazed silently at the shifting clouds, not saying a word.

A pale white jade pendant lay on the table, flashing bright, then dark, then bright again.

Even as the battle raged in the southern sky, like a flood dragon tumbling through the clouds, and even as the jade pendant called out again and again, her expression did not change.

But Kong Xiaxiang’s jaw was clenched. He had hesitated for a long time. His voice was low.

“Daoist Master… the sky…”

Kong Tingyun remained silent.

Her gaze was not on the sky. It passed through the dense woods, fixed on the stone steps of the mountain path. Kong Tingyun’s gaze grew colder, her expression more detached.

A young man in blue robes was climbing the mountain. His eyes were bright, his expression leisurely, as if he were on a pleasant stroll. He walked with his hands behind his back, a smile on his face.

When this face entered Kong Xiaxiang’s vision, he froze. The middle-aged man began to tremble uncontrollably. The jade pot in his hand sloshed. A torrent of uncontrollable fear and hatred shot from his eyes.

Bai Ziyu, Daoist Master Yehui.

The Daoist Master strolled forward as if walking through his own courtyard. He glanced at Kong Tingyun, then his gaze naturally fell on Kong Xiaxiang’s face. He suddenly smiled.

Kong Xiaxiang felt a moment of dislocation. Faced with the chief culprit behind Profound Peak’s collapse, the Daoist Master who had slaughtered the most Kong family disciples, the hatred in his heart was irrepressible. But reason told him to hide his expression. He could only force his brow into a twisted submission. How could he possibly fool Yehui?

Seeing him bow his head, Yehui’s face took on a mocking cast.

“Daoist friend, you seem quite at ease. The world is tearing itself apart outside, yet you sit here in peace.”

Yehui was Profound Peak’s greatest enemy; Kong Tingyun naturally had no kind words for him.

But Yehui just smiled.

“Daoist Friend Kong, by order of the Profound Governance Pavilion, I invite you to join me in resolving this crisis and retaking Yufu.”

Kong Tingyun swept him with a cold glance.

“Daoist friend, you may go and 'resolve' it yourself.”

Kong Tingyun was no fool. Gongsun Bei, Helian Wujiang, and Murong Yan were all fighting out there. Why would they need her? The south now saw her as a thorn in their side. If she went out rashly and there was an ambush, it would be aimed at her. Yehui, asking her to "join the battle" under the guise of an order, was clearly trying to test or harm her.

Thus, she remained unmoved, sitting quietly on the mountain. Yehui nodded with amusement. He certainly understood that the hatred between their two families could never be resolved. He tucked his hands in his sleeves and left, thinking calmly:

‘In the end, only one of us can live. I’ll just wait and see how you beg for your life when the north-south conflict ends and Profound Governance discards you like a worn-out shoe!’

He leaped up and stepped into the Great Void. Moments later, water and fire roiled. Jade True light appeared, and flickering Purple Qi rose. Gongsun Bei, wielding a crimson axe, was locked in a fierce battle with the current Protector-General of the Tranquil Sea, Liu Bai, stirring up massive waves of energy.

Of all the kings, only King Wei was under the lightest control, his domain practically a state within a state. He had instead become a land unto himself. The other kings were all constrained and closely watched. The position of Protector-General was comparable to that of a Great General. This Liu Bai, formerly Daoist Master Zhusheng and now the Protector-General of the Tranquil Sea, held a high position in the Song Court. Dressed in armor, he was greatly favored by the Martial Cultivation Star and was a completely different man!

He stood high in the sky, a great banner fluttering behind him, parting water and fire. The rolling radiance of Martial Cultivation pouring down from the heavens converted into wondrous True Qi, amplifying his dharma body and forcing Gongsun Bei onto the defensive.

Liu Bai cultivated the Jade True Dao, which was extremely compatible with True Qi. He was also a three-divine ability cultivator who walked the Way of the Sword. With the amplification of wondrous True Qi, his power was shocking! He not only suppressed Gongsun Bei but even had time to harass Helian Wujiang. If not for him, the minor cultivators from the south would never have been able to trap the Buddhist cultivators in Shanji.

Nearby, Murong Yan was locked in a difficult fight with Ning Wan. This Valley Water cultivator was stronger than Ning Wan, but she was a genius of formations, with an array of white-sparrow-like flags circling her, not to mention that terrifyingly cold blade. Though she was outmatched, her formations shifted endlessly, tying him down.

Every time Murong Yan tried to break through, Ning Wan would immediately grip Great Snow's Severing Edge, forcing him to behave. Realizing the situation, he simply began to drag out the fight.

Even though Gongsun Bei was exceptionally powerful, he couldn't help but curse inwardly,

‘If the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform hadn't been reclaimed, would I be letting them act so brazenly!’

Gongsun Bei was strong, but he was "poor." He couldn't compare to Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition descendants like Tinglan and Ning Wan. Liu Bai, meanwhile, had an exceptionally wondrous jade ring, and he was pummeling Gongsun Bei so badly he couldn't find an opening.

Even so, the south’s position was becoming more and more awkward. The most precarious front was that of Helian Wujiang and Helian Wumeng. The newly advanced Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, Lingu Lanying and Daoist Master Wenqing, were being held off by the battle-hardened Helian Wumeng alone. Daoist Master Xianyao, who had rushed over from the sea, was being pushed back step by step by Helian Wujiang, his face pale and his situation dire. If not for Liu Bai's occasional support, the line would have already collapsed!

But even barely holding on, the situation was no longer a siege of Shanji. The battle had already pushed them back a hundred li, all the way into Yufu Prefecture!

It was at this exact moment that a heavy white light appeared, and a sparse purple rain began to fall. The young man arrived, holding the light, a smile on his face. His voice thundered through the Great Void:

“Eastern Feather Mountain!”

An enormous white mountain materialized, rumbling as it emerged from the Great Void. Ning Wan looked up sharply, her heart instantly turning to ice.

‘Yehui is here…’

The current stalemate was already a desperate effort. How could they withstand the sudden attack of this mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator?

‘What’s more… Qi Lanyan hasn't shown himself. If Yehui is here, can Qi Lanyan be far behind?’

She took a single step back, but Murong Yan before her suddenly attacked. The skin-bag he had worn for so long suddenly shed, and the light of Valley Water surged, sweeping away the binding cold qi and rushing straight for her face.

Clearly, Murong Yan had been watching the situation, but seeing Yehui make a move, he assumed Profound Governance reinforcements had arrived and immediately moved to tie her down, hoping for a greater victory.

Ning Wan’s expression turned grim. She decisively placed a hand on her longsword and drew!

A sword of profound white, etched with the sigil of the Supreme Yin rising. Short hilt, long blade, a vision of Heaven and Earth in harmony. Great Snow's Severing Edge erupted, a sword like a star pointed straight at the sky!

*Clang!*

Great Snow's Severing Edge was not a pure Spiritual Sword, but a sword for casting spells and incantations. An avalanche of frigid snow blasted forward. Murong Yan’s expression changed dramatically. All his divine abilities instantly retracted, and a dark gray light covered his body.

‘Sunless Deceit!’

But as all his divine abilities contracted, falling away like a painted skin, the longsword had already shot into the sky. It transformed into a pillar of pure white light that pierced the heavens, slamming into the oncoming flying mountain.

*Boom!*

Pale white streams of qi rolled down like boulders. The light of frozen snow, condensed to its absolute limit, had turned a morbid, dark white. The massive flying mountain was instantly split in two, blasted into dust and smoke in a single move!

The terrifying cold light of the snow even made Gongsun Bei and Liu Bai look over, their eyes filled with shock.

‘Great Snow's Severing Edge… it truly lives up to its name…’

But as Ning Wan, her face pale, paused in the air, the space behind the shattered mountain was empty. Yehui’s figure had dissipated like the wind. He reappeared silently behind the purple-robed woman who was struggling to parry Helian Wumeng’s weapon.

Daoist Master Wenqing’s expression changed instantly. Yehui’s hand was already cupped, glowing with a hazy yellow light.

Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release!

The misty light struck first. Daoist Master Wenqing’s face went white. She coughed up blood, terror in her eyes. Her body felt as if it were on fire, pierced by needles, and a binding power immobilized her.

Yehui was already pushing his palm forward. A torrent of crystalline sand appeared, clouding the air. He formed a seal at his chest, the power of the Western Heaven Plateau gathering in his pushing palm. A wondrous art flared, and six sigils appeared in his hand:

Art of the Six Yehui Vast Poisons!

Yehui’s reputation was not great, but he had also inherited the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition. The arts he wielded were no weaker than Changxiao’s. The collapse of the Capital Guard had held him back for years, but over time, he had devised ways to compensate.

The Art of the Six Yehui Vast Poisons had been refined by him for many years. It was vicious and cruel, a powerful art designed to destroy a person's Dao-Profundity and dharma body!

He laughed, “Eat this! It will void ten years of your cultivation!”

His words, driven by his divine ability, exploded like thunder, causing Daoist Master Wenqing’s eyes to dim. Yet, even as he spoke words of triumph, there was no trace of victory in Yehui’s eyes. He slowed his attack slightly, his gaze shifting.

At this critical moment, a speck of golden light shot out, blocking Yehui’s palm!

*Clang!*

A violent sound exploded in the air. Yehui’s figure shattered like foam and reformed five steps away. He held two fingers up and looked forward.

The golden spear was held fast in a man's hand.

This man was eight feet tall, with white hair and beard, a thick waist, and broad shoulders. He wore pleated robes, golden boots, and a sparrow-tail crown. A golden-red saber was strapped to his back. He held the spear in one hand, his face scarred, his eyes grim.

He stood on a cloud of white, coiling mist. It was strange, not like a normal, soft, round dharma cloud, but shaped like a crescent moon, moving like a serpent. Rolling golden malice and autumn dew hung from his robes, radiating a bone-chilling cold.

His face was blank, his eyes like those of a demon, shooting out a sinister red light.

‘Breaking the Broken!’

A stark white light of profound unity suddenly spread, sweeping away all surrounding divine abilities. The Art of the Six Yehui Vast Poisons melted away like ice in spring, utterly neutralized.

Every divine ability across the battlefield dimmed, their power slashed!

Gongsun Bei, who was channeling Dawn Qi, narrowed his eyes. Liu Bai looked up abruptly, his gaze sharp. Every spiritual sense converged on the old man.

Ning Wan snapped her sword back into its sheath, her beautiful eyes closing as her face paled. Her lips moved.

‘Situ Huo…’

Yehui’s gaze sharpened. He forced a wild laugh from his throat, his eyes blinking rapidly.

“So it's you, old bastard! It's really you, old bastard!”

This was the long-missing Situ Huo!

The Golden Tang Gate Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, a descendant of Situ Tang, the Daoist Master who had been forced to flee overseas… he had finally reappeared! He was from the era just after the Three Yuans. After all this time, he could truly be called an "old bastard"!

His words echoed through the night like rolling thunder.

Situ Huo’s hair was white, his eyelids heavy. He turned his gaze on Yehui, the look still as sharp and venomous as a viper. His voice was hoarse and muffled. 

“The young are truly fearsome.”

But as he spoke, the sky darkened. Torrents of white qi streamed from his robes like waterfalls. Three shadows darted through the folds of his clothes. His pupils turned a dull autumn yellow, staring straight at Yehui.

‘Engraved Stone.’

This Body Divine Ability was known as both Engraved Stone and Golden Beast Plume. They pointed to different Daoist Traditions, but they were the same art, from the same source.

The old man hadn't moved, but Yehui threw up his sleeve, catching *something*. His body sank, and he retreated several steps. As a *crackling* sound was heard, another "Situ Huo" had already appeared behind him, his hand grasping the long saber on his back!

*Boom!*

An earth-shattering explosion rocked the night sky. Situ Huo’s old eyes narrowed. He was already engulfed in an endless, brilliant light. At the same time, the "Situ Huo" decoy vanished like the wind.

Also shaking was the ambient Purple Qi in the sky. A golden scroll unfurled in the wind, and the aspects of water and fire appeared. Tinglan materialized, her expression complex, holding the immortal scroll. She gritted her teeth.

“Situ Huo, hear the decree!”

Those eyes snapped up, a cold light flashing within them.

“This subject is present.”

His appearance was so unexpected it had momentarily stunned all the Purple Mansion Realm experts. But now, all the clouds in the sky had stopped moving, and a single star suddenly blazed.

‘Martial Cultivation's radiance!’

Far away, Helian Wujiang looked up, his heart pounding.

“We can't stay!”

If they had any hesitation about retreating when Situ Huo first appeared, the arrival of Tinglan and the immortal decree settled it. How far behind could Yang Ruiyi be?

Situ Huo stepped onto the water and fire and took the golden scroll from Tinglan. The arm-length Tablet of Proclaimed Might, shaped like a broken sword, fell into his hand.

The weapon seemed to grant him a profound power. Layers of energy settled onto Situ Huo, making him exhale deeply. His eyes brightened, and his aura surged, making everyone look on in alarm. He gripped the hilt of the saber on his back.

The fighting in the sky had stopped. Gongsun Bei also stared gravely at the old man, his spiritual sense trembling in the Great Void.

‘Time to go.’

Was Situ Huo strong? In his day, he was far inferior to the geniuses of that era. The Supreme Yang was at its peak at that time. As the closest blood descendant of the hated Situ Tang, he had retreated in the face of the great tide, abandoning the entire Golden Tang Gate and two other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to flee overseas.

At that time, he was just an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Any random Daoist Master from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition could have crushed him. But now was different. Three hundred years of wandering, surviving the pursuit of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition and numerous other enemies—including more than five mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm experts—and he was still alive, having outlasted them all. How could this Situ Huo be an ordinary man?

What made Gongsun Bei even more wary was Situ Huo plus the long saber on his back—Blood-Omen Tower!

It was one of the five items retrieved from Situ Tang's corpse, the personal weapon of the Golden Tang Daoist Master, Situ Tang!

If Situ Huo had relied on the golden boots on his feet—"Monarch's Lost Sheep"—to roam the world and escape from high-level cultivators, preserving his life, then Blood-Omen Tower was the great fang he had honed for three hundred years.

The only weapon present that could be said to reliably suppress Blood-Omen Tower was Ning Wan’s Great Snow's Severing Edge. But her Way of the Sword cultivation was lacking; she could use its scabbard's power, but not its blade!

*Screee!*

A terrifyingly sharp, piercing shriek filled the air as Situ Huo drew the blade a single inch from its sheath.

The reputation of the Golden Tang Daoist Master, Situ Tang, was terrifying. Some called him an arrogant madman, some said he was blind, some said he failed to accumulate virtue for his descendants. But from his birth to his death, no one ever dared say he lacked skill!

His divine abilities were vast. He had defied the Golden Feather Sect's Immortal Order, treated a visitor from Mount Changhuai with contempt, and killed a Supreme Yang expert over a petty grudge. He was one of a kind. If he hadn't offended the Dragon-kin, who had been forced to intervene and severely wound him, there's no telling what he might have become.

When Situ Huo appeared, the first thing that shocked everyone was not Situ Huo himself, but the memory of Situ Tang's madness!

*Boom!*

The heavens trembled. Yehui’s figure was long gone. Helian Wujiang had also vanished. A stream of lights fled into the Great Void. But the long saber slowly slid back into its sheath. The piercing red light never fully brightened; it just dimmed.

Situ Huo’s hand on the hilt seemed like an illusion. He still stood with heavy-lidded eyes, holding the Tablet of Proclaimed Might in both hands, unmoving. His cold gaze drifted lazily over everyone, and then, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, it landed on the woman in white.

The expression on his old face instantly came alive. His gaze locked onto her face. He smiled, and all his wrinkles smoothed out, making him look ten years younger.

‘Ning Tiaoxiao…’
