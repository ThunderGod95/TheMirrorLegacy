# Chapter 1127: The Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant

Descending from Small Guang Kong Mountain, one entered the Western Sea. The earth veins here were robust, but the spiritual energy was sparse. The seabed rose and fell, yet Demon beasts were few—a stark contrast to the scenery of the Eastern Sea.

The three masters followed the earth veins, heading deeper into the baleful qi as the terrain grew more treacherous. Though Li Ximing possessed an Immortal Artifact, with this man leading, he saw no need to arouse suspicion and spoke casually,

"It's hidden quite deep... Daoist friend, you have some impressive skills to have found this place."

Yin Qin chuckled.

"I may cultivate in the Western Sea, but I have spent long periods in the Abyss of Weak Water. My own divine ability has a few unique applications. I noticed that Daoist Friend Cang Tiaozi of the World's Navel entered and exited the abyss every few years. I chanced upon him twice, which made me pay closer attention. After asking around, I learned that Daoist Friend Cang Tiaozi possessed the Shore-Manifesting White Flower and supplied it to many other cultivators."

The man's gaze was chilling as he continued faintly:

"There shouldn't be so many of this item, and there was no need for him to come here year after year. I suspected then that Cang Tiaozi had a spiritual root... one that couldn't be moved from the Abyss of Weak Water. I searched high and low, but I could never find any proof."

"It wasn't a total loss, however. I saw that lynx demon skulking back through the Abyss of Weak Water. After much thought, I shifted my focus to him. Only then did I realize this was merely their chosen trading spot..."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"A remarkable divine ability, Daoist friend, to uncover such details."

Yin Qin laughed. His expression was polite, but combined with his gloomy aura, it carried a chilling undertone.

"I cultivate 'Bound Earth,' the true path of stillness that arrests profound change. My divine ability is named 'Valley of True Origin.' I merely saw him descend into the sea at a certain point, recorded the location, and then used the earth veins to calculate his exact position."

He smiled.

"All spiritual roots must commune with the earth veins. That Demon beast is both stingy and cowardly, so he never had the chance to establish a great Purple Mansion Realm array to protect it. That made the calculation even simpler."

"This is almost certainly the Solitary White Brahma Cluster, which frequently bears the Shore-Manifesting White Flower! Since it's a living spiritual root, it will surely fare better in our hands, with careful tending, than in the possession of that Demon beast!"

Cultivators of Bound Earth were numerous, but those with a proper Dao lineage were exceedingly rare. Li Ximing couldn't help but shoot him a second glance, sighing,

"In Jiangnan, we also had a cultivator... He, too, practiced Bound Earth. His was the Fool's Mountain Chase..."

Yin Qin sneered.

"Fool's Mountain Chase? That's a divine ability from Tongxuan Palace, used to supplement their Shetu Earth. What kind of unorthodox lineage is that? To be blunt, it can barely be considered 'Bound Earth' at all... As for its wondrousness..."

He was one step short of saying, 'It's a disgrace to Bound Earth.' By speaking so candidly, he was likely hinting at his own superior lineage, a subtle threat to prevent the other two from getting any ideas.

Li Ximing listened, making a mental note. He understood this man was likely arrogant at his core and deliberately provoked him:

"Oh? But my senior's Dao lineage was officially recognized by the Profound Governance. The five types of earth are all part of the five elements, but there are high and low distinctions. That Dao which manifests as rosy clouds in the heavens is probably the most practical."

Hearing this, Yin Qin actually fell silent for a moment before replying:

"That is a matter for the immortals of the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist Tradition, not for minor cultivators like us to discuss recklessly."

'His lips are sealed tight...'

Though the man said little, Li Ximing gleaned a great deal and chuckled inwardly.

'So he isn't a Comprehending Profoundity cultivator either! I wonder where his Earth Virtue inheritance came from...'

As they spoke, they arrived in a deep ocean trench. The water was heavy and shrouded in darkness. Li Zhouwei's golden eyes swept the area, instantly piercing the illusion. A formation as thin as a cicada's wing shattered at a touch, revealing, as expected, a cave-abode hidden within!

Inside the cavern, the radiance was dim. A vast hall was filled with the ruins of countless palaces, set between dark rivers. They surrounded a central purple lake, upon which stood an ancient tree.

The tree was over four hundred feet tall, its canopy spreading like a cloud. It was sparsely dusted with ice and snow, and its branches and leaves were entirely white. Several white blossoms, each the size of a human face with stamens of gold and silver, adorned its boughs, releasing an intoxicating fragrance.

The surface of the pool was perfectly still, a mirror reflecting the branches and leaves. A faint, mournful music drifted through the air, stirring the heart.

Li Zhouwei, however, merely glanced around and smiled.

"What a potent illusion."

Li Ximing, who had been observing intently, had already formed the Light of the Six Harmonies in his hand. He held it like a wisp of flame, raised it to his lips, and blew gently.

Everything before them shattered like a lake reflection. The ruined palaces and layered scenery dissolved into nothing. The cavern was, in reality, no larger than a small hall. Faint, silver-white array patterns flickered across the ground, bathing the room in a dim white glow. In the center stood a small, graceful spiritual shrub, like a tea plant, with sparse, elegant branches.

Yin Qin stood frozen, stunned.

'It's not the Solitary White Brahma Cluster?'

The tea plant-like spiritual root before them had golden branches, leaves as white as snow, and white blossoms dotting its limbs. This sight made the Daoist Master stumble back a step in disbelief, instantly creating distance between himself and the other two!

Li Ximing felt a wave of Lesser Yang light wash over his face, as brilliant as moonlight on snow but lacking any chill. He knew something had changed and immediately gripped the Spiritual Treasure in his hand, his gaze turning wary.

The atmosphere in the grotto-abode instantly tensed. Li Zhouwei, however, showed little reaction. His golden eyes scanned the surroundings, examining every detail.

"The spiritual energy here is unusual," he stated calmly. "Neither sun nor moon shines, and all energies are in harmony. It possesses the consummate qi of the Lesser Yang, which is perfect for preserving this spiritual object. It's not that the Demon beast didn't set up an array; he simply lacked the ability to deploy a Purple Mansion Realm formation without destroying this delicate balance."

His words eliminated any possibility of a fight breaking out in this place. Yin Qin , seeming to recover, pinched his fingers to make a calculation. In a low, uncertain voice, he muttered:

"This is the Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant, a 'Lesser Yang' Purple Mansion Realm spiritual root. So the Shore-Manifesting White Flower actually came from this... That lynx demon hid this well!"

"Ever since the Sundering of the Lesser Yang, this spiritual root's lineage was severed at its source. Its leaves turned from white to pale yellow, and its twelve branches withered to four, becoming the Solitary White Brahma Cluster... The origin of this particular plant must be ancient indeed!"

Li Ximing glanced at it, thinking,

'If that's the case, it can't be moved. The moment it's taken outside and exposed to the world's spiritual aura, it will degenerate day by day until it becomes a second-rate spiritual root...'

But the golden-eyed youth's gaze was blazing. He studied the area for a long moment, feeling that the perfection of this place was almost frightening. He began to pace, his eyes sweeping over the glowing patterns on the ground, remaining silent. A dark cloud of suspicion rose in his heart.

'Such an exquisitely balanced place... was it really created by nature?'

Li Zhouwei pondered for a long time before activating his Immortal Mirror, scanning the area once more. Still, he found nothing out of the ordinary.

'It's just this one location... no traces anywhere else. But if it was crafted by a cultivator... how many people in this world possess such profound Dao-Profundity? How could it possibly be that worthless lynx demon? Was it truly natural?'

A cold glint entered his eyes. He closed them briefly, recalling the Demon beast's pleas,

'Since you are from Jiangnan, you must know of my past karma. I am willing to offer this spiritual root to you two sirs...'

'The spiritual root is tied to the karma... Perhaps he found a clue to this spiritual root through that past karma... That would explain it... Let's observe a little longer.'

He turned his head, glanced at the Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant, and said, "Since we agreed to split everything, this plant has four mature Shore-Manifesting White Flower. Let's pick those first."

Hearing this, Yin Qin spoke up immediately, clearly afraid they might damage the root.

"This item is among the most delicate of Lesser Yang resources. It fears both fire and baleful qi. It's best to collect them in a wooden box."

Li Zhouwei, however, was watching him intently.

"As for the spiritual root itself..." he continued.

That sentence made Yin Qin 's heart leap into his throat. His expression grew hesitant, but the young man merely said flatly:

"We'll chop it down right here. Our two families will divide it."

At these words, even Li Ximing winced, to say nothing of Yin Qin . The man's face turned pale, and he cried out anxiously,

"Absolutely not! How can such a magnificent spiritual root be turned into firewood!"

He could no longer restrain himself and stepped forward to plead,

"I understand your esteemed clan is far away, making it difficult to manage this spiritual root. But this is easily solved! The Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant flowers far more rapidly than the Solitary White Brahma Cluster. I cultivate Earth Virtue and have some knowledge of tending spiritual roots. Just entrust it to me! In the future, whenever it flowers or sprouts new leaves, I will divide them fifty-fifty and have your portion delivered to your esteemed clan!"

He bowed repeatedly, sighing, "This way, we are all satisfied. Is that not for the best?"

His proposal was reasonable, and Li Ximing looked moved. But Li Zhouwei's golden eyes remained unwavering. He smiled.

"You are very considerate of my family, Daoist friend. But this item is so precious... how could splitting it between two be better than one person taking it all? Are you not afraid that this King will return home, gather reinforcements, and dispose of you? Then I wouldn't have to share it at all."

Yin Qin 's expression changed drastically. He raised his brows and said,

"King Wei, your radiance..."

The young man, however, cut him off. His eyes glittered with a sharp, wicked light as he laughed.

"Radiance? This King dares to claim it, but do _you_ dare to believe it?"

Yin Qin deliberated for a moment, clearly unwilling to offend him. He finally let out a long sigh, unable to argue.

"Since King Wei insists on felling it, then please, proceed!"

Li Zhouwei turned, plucked the four white flowers, and stored them safely. Then, he lightly flipped his palm.

An invisible object appeared in his hand. Though formless, its power radiated outward, feeling like the scorching, oppressive heat of a midday sun, parching the throat.

It was the 'Concealed Plunder Gold'!

This was a gift from the White Dragon Prince, formed from the essence of the Supreme Yang that had fallen into the Eastern Sea. It was a truly orthodox Supreme Yang spiritual object!

He brought two fingers together, pinching the item, and slashed at the Lesser Yang spiritual root.

In an instant, radiance exploded. Leaves fluttered down like a shattering jade vase. A flash of azure burst from within the white as small beads scattered across the ground, like mottled sunlight filtering through trees at dusk.

Only then did a dull rumble sound, like the overturning of the sea. Three colors scattered from the light. Li Ximing looked down to find pale blue Converging Water already surging past his boots.

He exclaimed in praise, and with a sweep of his hand, gathered the rolling white beads. The moment they entered his sleeve, they melted into a pool. Li Ximing's eyes lit up.

"'Lesser Yang' Purple Mansion Realm spiritual object! Supreme Eaves Radiance!"

Li Zhouwei closed his eyes briefly, absorbing the 'Concealed Plunder Gold' back into his Juque Palace. In his hand, six pale-white, scale-like objects appeared. The young man displayed them openly.

"'Dawn Qi' spiritual resource, Dao-Gazing Scales."

The Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant had been reduced to a fist-sized piece of dead wood, soaking in the shallow Converging Water. Yin Qin 's expression was grim as he picked it up.

"This is what the Solitary White Brahma Cluster transforms into... Solitary White Brahma Wood. It is also of the 'Lesser Yang'—King Wei, your methods are truly impressive. To use a Supreme Yang spiritual object to divide it... you have not failed it!"

He wasn't wrong. Not only were Supreme Yang spiritual objects incredibly rare, but Li Zhouwei's casual slash was backed by his profound Dao-Profundity. It was no simple feat.

Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei exchanged a glance and nodded. Li Zhouwei separated three of the Dao-Gazing Scales and handed them to Yin Qin to seal the deal. Only then did Li Ximing speak:

"Daoist friend, since we are here, let us also divide the items from the lynx demon."

He took out the storage bag, showed it to Yin Qin , and then used a divine ability to open it. Though a small mountain of spiritual items poured out, the truly valuable items were gathered with a sweep of his power and separated into six lots.

Two were cultivation manuals: the Upright Wood's Journeying North manual, Mountains Gaze South Classic, and the Merging Fire manual, Dao Fire Merging Heart Classic, which cultivated the divine ability 'Concurrent-Risk Seizure'.

Both were excellent and uncommon Purple Mansion Realm manuals. The Dao Fire Merging Heart Classic in particular was an ancient method; its grade was indiscernible, but it was written on a crimson-gold scroll that was clearly extraordinary.

'An unexpected boon!'

The remaining four items included a piece of inky-black, iron-hard rotted wood, which had to be the 'Upright Wood' spiritual wood Wood-Worshipping Iron, and a dark-green, water-like ripple of energy, which was precisely the Verdant Profound Sarcophagus Li Ximing had been coveting!

The last two were spiritual resources: one was the 'Blazing Fire' resource Rising Warmth Stone, which Li Ximing had acquired before, and the other was an item his family knew all too well, Neck Feathers.

The former was required for cultivating Journeying North, which made sense. But seeing the latter, Li Ximing felt a pang of guilt.

'I've used quite a few Neck Feathers over the years... It's possible he traded for this one from someone else...'

This was a respectable fortune for a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, but for a Demon beast who had controlled a spiritual root for so many years, it was surprisingly meager. Li Zhouwei's suspicion deepened, but he said nothing. Li Ximing had already stepped forward with a smile.

"I heard that you, Daoist friend, possess a Verdant Profound Sarcophagus. I am willing to trade one of my spiritual resources and two Dao-Gazing Scales for it. Are you interested?"

This made the Daoist Master pause and reflect.

"The lynx demon had one... for you to ask me for another, it seems your need is great. You'll be taking the one from his stash as well, then..."

It was impossible to hide. Li Ximing smiled and nodded. Yin Qin hesitated, but the Verdant Profound Sarcophagus was useless to him. He finally nodded, retrieving a jade box from his sleeve.

"Very well!"

With two Verdant Profound Sarcophagus in hand, Li Ximing's mind was at ease. He made a copy of the cultivation manuals, and the three prepared to leave. But as they did, a cloud of mist rose from the ground, and the treasure-land began to collapse.

'A Bound Earth divine ability.'

Li Ximing felt a prickle of unease. Li Zhouwei snapped his eyes up, staring directly at Yin Qin . The Daoist Master simply waved his hand.

"None of us has any more use for this place, but the residual aura of the spiritual root lingers. It's best not to leave it... It will save us the trouble of another Daoist Master finding it, sensing something, and tracing it back to us."

His divine ability had pulsed for only an instant, yet it had utterly destroyed the millennia-old, exquisitely constructed cave. He avoided Li Zhouwei's gaze, turned, and cupped his hands.

"Fellow Daoists, farewell. We shall meet again if destiny wills it!"

As his figure dissipated, Li Ximing turned to his companion and sighed.

"Cooperating with him... might not have been a bad thing. The Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant os far superior to the Solitary White Brahma Cluster. It's a true treasure pot. If we could have gotten one flower every two years, it's as good as the Wave-Suppressing Mansion!"

Li Zhouwei's heart was dark with suspicion, but his smile was relaxed.

"That man is treacherous and cunning. I don't trust him. If war truly breaks out between north and south and he offers some flimsy excuse, are we going to cross the sea just to confront him? It's better to settle this permanently."

Li Ximing could only nod. Li Zhouwei then said nonchalantly,

"Grand-Uncle, you still need to collect the spiritual items and tidy up here. Why don't I take the Heavenly Nurture Urn back first, just in case anything unexpected happens?"

Although Li Ximing didn't foresee any problems, he handed the Spiritual Treasure over. Li Zhouwei took it, bid his farewell, and vanished into the Great Void, his heart growing colder by the second.

'Now... let's see just what kind of trickery you were hiding!'
