# Chapter 739: The Bait

'Minghui… the name sounds so familiar…'

When the name reached Li Ximing’s ears, a flicker of recollection crossed his face. For a Purple Mansion cultivator, even the faintest memory could be instantly recalled. Realization dawned.

"Ah, he was with Murong Xia!"

Years ago, when Murong Xia had traveled south to seek his Dao, he had avoided the path through the Sword Gate and Xiukui territory, likely fearing he would provoke the Daoist Master of the Spirit Pine. He also steered clear of the Profound Peak and Purple Smoke Gates, probably to avoid being struck down by Daoist Master Zipei. Instead, he took the route through the Azure Pond Sect, which led him straight to the Li clan's domain after crossing the river.

A minor conflict had erupted between Murong Xia and the Li clan. Li Tongya had made a move, only to be intercepted by a master monk from Lotus Temple. That monk’s name was Minghui—undoubtedly the same person from the rumors.

'We’ve had our disagreements, and my clan's enmity with the Buddhist cultivators has only deepened since. It’s best if I avoid him.'

He was about to step into the Great Void when a figure rose from the market below. The man was white-haired and dressed in black robes, giving him a rather sinister appearance, though his expression was respectful. He flew forward and bowed.

"By order of my ancestor, I have been waiting for you, Daoist Master. He has been at the Yebai Pavilion for some time. Please, follow me."

Li Ximing glanced at the man, a strange thought crossing his mind.

'A mere Foundation Establishment cultivator can see me? Changyun must have guided him… I wonder what wondrous art he used to grant him this sight.'

'But I've never heard of Daoist Master Changyun possessing any skill in the art of calculation… How could he have known I was coming? Even if he couldn't divine the exact movements of a Purple Mansion master, he must have at least foreseen an arrival related to me. His divination skills are astonishing.'

He withdrew his gaze, letting it rest on the black-robed elder for a moment before asking, "Daoist Friend Changyun’s calculation arts are truly impressive. He knew I would be the one to visit."

The elder, still visibly nervous, hurried to respond. "To answer the Daoist Master, my ancestor only passed down an order that a certain Daoist Master would be visiting today. He did not specify who it would be…"

That sounded far more plausible to Li Ximing. Since Changyun had already sent someone, he saw no point in turning back. "Lead the way," he said simply.

The black-robed elder bowed immediately and began to lead the way. Li Ximing watched him for a moment, the Profound Light between his brows pulsing faintly. He spoke, as if in passing, "I see that Chengshui Marsh is rich with spiritual Qi and abundant in spiritual resources. It seems like a fine place to nurture talent. I imagine many notable figures have emerged in recent years!"

The elder dared not neglect a Daoist Master's question. "Indeed, Daoist Master," he said quickly. "Several cultivator clans have risen in Jiangbei in recent years, and many rogue cultivators have successfully established their immortal foundations before scattering to the north and south. Some of the northern orthodoxies have even sent people to Chengshui Marsh to gather Qi."

"Oh?" Li Ximing’s interest was piqued. "Since the spiritual Qi is so abundant and the land is teeming with talent, I assume the blood-based arts from the Eastern Sea are no longer in use?"

The elder nodded vigorously. "Precisely. The sect master and the Daoist Master issued a decree long ago. We are no longer the sect we were in the Eastern Sea; we are a thoroughly righteous and orthodox sect now. Not only have all those who practiced blood arts been dispatched to guard the Eastern Sea, but even those whose demonic techniques were less severe have reined them in. Our disciples now venture out to slay demons and subdue evil, and they've purged the area around Chengshui Marsh until it's spotless. Demonic cultivators have been all but eradicated."

"Now, the common people are all migrating to our Chengshui region. We’ve built quite a reputation in Jiangbei, and our Chengyun Gate is the most famous of all for exorcising demons and defending the righteous path!"

A sycophantic smile spread across the elder's face. "Daoist Master, feel free to ask anyone here, whether they are rogue cultivators, clan cultivators, common folk, or our own disciples. They will all tell you that the Chengyun Gate is the foremost righteous sect in all of Jiangbei!"

Li Ximing's heart was a tangle of complex emotions. For this man to make such a guarantee in his presence, the conduct of Chengyun Gate must truly be impeccable.

But what these rogue cultivators and common people didn't know was that Chengyun Gate was a sect founded by a gathering of demonic cultivators. Now, after several decades, a new generation of disciples—talented Qi Refining cultivators from Jiangbei itself—had been trained to solidify their power. And somehow, they had become a beacon of righteousness.

'In another fifty years, who will remember that the ancestors of Chengyun Gate were a band of depraved demonic cultivators who fed on human flesh?'

'Their disciples, their descendants, their bloodlines—they will all carry themselves with honor, slaying evil and defending the Dao, never knowing what came before… And what of Chengyun Gate itself? Will the demon-slaying Chengyun Gate become an irreproachable righteous sect?'

His gaze darkened.

'Who will remember the sins of the ancestors who built their legacy on demonic arts? Who will care? Do the good deeds of their descendants not count as good deeds? And yet, those good deeds are built upon a foundation of their ancestors' slaughter and cannibalism…'

Regardless of his thoughts, Li Ximing understood that with Zhong Qian's influence, Chengyun Gate was destined to become the foremost righteous sect of Jiangbei. They would be comparable to the Sword Gate or Hengzhu. The stories of demonic cultivation, of killing people to refine pills from their blood—all of it would be buried beneath the endless mounds of their victims.

'These old demonic masters, who spent their lives devouring humans, can now spend a century absorbing spiritual Qi on their peaks, reinvent themselves as righteous elders, and who would ever question it? The grateful citizens under their rule? The rogue cultivators they rescued? The descendants of Chengyun Gate themselves will forget.'

'The line between good and evil is hopelessly blurred. This is the perfect example.'

Mount Yebai.

Mount Yebai was the highest point in Chengshui Marsh. The marsh had once been the site of the Ning Kingdom's imperial mausoleum, and Mount Yebai was its very center. After occupying the area, the Chengyun Gate had built a pavilion on the summit, naming it Yebai Pavilion after the mountain itself.

Though called a pavilion, the structure was expansive, with winding corridors and interconnected halls. The main pavilion was astonishingly large. Seated within was a young man of average appearance, dressed in a long robe of black and white feathers with intricate dark patterns. Beneath it, a soft, high-collared white armor was visible. A saber hung at his waist, and he held a jade gourd in his hand.

Across from him sat a kindly-faced, slightly portly monk in a brownish-yellow robe. He was studying a jade cup with a smile.

"Daoist Friend Changyun! If my calculations are correct, our fellow Daoist will arrive within the hour."

Daoist Master Changyun's gaze remained fixed on the jade gourd in his hand. After a few moments, as if sensing something, he finally spoke. "Daoist Friend Minghui’s calculation arts are truly remarkable."

The monk, Minghui, let out a chuckle. "Although this old monk failed to attain the rank of Maha, I did not leave empty-handed. I have achieved the state of Non-Retrogression beneath the lotus seat of the Maha's Pure Land. A position is reserved for me above. With a little more time, becoming a Maha is well within my reach!"

Daoist Master Changyun paused slightly before replying, "You are truly blessed with good fortune, my friend. How many master monks could ever hope for such a fate? You are the first disciple of a lotus-rank Maha and an emissary to the south. Back when the Yue Cultivating Sect marched north and the Shangyuan intervened, the Jinlian Maha swallowed his pride and even sacrificed the lives of other Merciful Ones just to secure you the title of 'Peace-Bringer.' With such support, becoming a Maha is a certainty!"

Minghui smiled. "That's because my master has completed his eighth reincarnation. He is now an eighth-life Maha. The Way of Joyful Bliss is flourishing, and a seat has opened up in the Pure Land. That's the only reason I have this chance…"

"Look at that Master Monk Xuwang from the north-south conflict," the monk continued with a laugh. "The Way of Emptiness had no seat for him, so he stubbornly refused to become a Merciful One. He had to slaughter countless cultivators from the Azure Pond Sect at Mount Bianyan just to achieve the state of Non-Retrogression, and even then, he only reached the Golden Lotus Seat—the same as me…"

"In the end," he concluded, "I have my Maha master's high regard to thank for everything!"

Daoist Master Changyun was inwardly unimpressed. He had little fondness for monks, but Minghui's backer, Jinlian, was an eighth-life Maha, and Minghui himself was destined for the same rank. He couldn't afford to be dismissive. He smiled and nodded just as a voice drifted in from outside the hall.

"Daoist Master, please!"

Both men raised their heads simultaneously to see a figure enter.

He was a young man in a white Daoist robe embroidered with golden patterns. His features were handsome and conveyed a gentle, warm temperament. Between his brows, a point of Profound Light faintly pulsed.

Daoist Master Changyun was taken aback for a moment. Sensing the Bright Yang divine ability emanating from the man, he asked tentatively, "Daoist Friend Zhaojing?"

Li Ximing clasped his hands in a salute and smiled. "Greetings, Daoist Master Changyun!"

At these words, Changyun immediately rose from the main seat and descended with a smile. "That boy Zhong Qian told me you would be paying a visit. I have been waiting and waiting. Finally, you've arrived!"

Zhong Qian not only had a karmic connection with Li Xuanfeng but was also exceedingly polite to the Li clan. He had shown them great respect during the establishment of their Purple Mansion. Li Ximing was naturally courteous in return, mirroring Changyun's smile. Changyun gestured for him to take a seat at a side table and then indicated Minghui.

"This is Daoist Master Zhaojing of the Moongaze Li clan."

Minghui had merely lifted his head for a cursory glance, remaining seated with a lazy posture. Li Ximing's aura was clearly that of a newly advanced Purple Mansion cultivator; there was no need for excessive courtesy.

'Oh… another immortal clan… Moongaze Li…' he thought dismissively.

"Moongaze Li?!"

The monk's eyes widened in shock.

Changyun had already turned back to Li Ximing to make the next introduction. "This is Minghui, a Merciful One from Lotus Temple. He has achieved Non-Retrogression in the Way of Joyful Bliss and is seated beneath the Golden Lotus. He is destined to become a Maha."

Among the seven Buddhist paths, the Way of Joyful Bliss had the least conflict with the Li clan. Still, Li Ximing felt no goodwill toward any of the northern Buddhists and expected none in return. He managed a polite expression.

Across from him, Minghui fought the overwhelming urge to turn and flee. A terror no one else could comprehend gripped him, and an icy chill shot through his veins.

'By the Merciful Revered One… it’s *that* Li clan!'

Years ago, when Minghui had traveled to Moongaze Lake, a single attempt at divination had nearly cost him his life. He had sacrificed his most precious Dharma Treasure to escape, and the backlash had even implicated his master, Jinlian!

Minghui was certain that no one in the world understood the full story better than he did. Jinlian himself had no memory of the event and had only heard Minghui's vague, terrified account, which was horrifying enough. But Minghui had witnessed it firsthand—he had seen how fragile the seventh-life Maha Jinlian had been in that entity's hands, as helpless as a mortal.

The incident had left Minghui with a permanent shadow on his soul and had inflicted a wound on Jinlian so severe that it had derailed their subsequent plans. Ultimately, it had caused Minghui's own attempt to reach the Maha rank to fail.

For a master monk of the Seven Phases, the path forward was twofold: either become a humble Merciful One or take the great leap to become a Maha. The former was already incredibly difficult. If one could curry favor with a Maha, they might have a chance, first attaining the rank of Merciful One under the lowest-ranking Bodhisattva seat. From there, it was a life of fawning and begging, hoping for a sliver of favor from above to slowly elevate one's state of Non-Retrogression and perhaps snatch an empty seat.

The latter was a near-impossible feat. It required the blessing of immense fate, significant contributions to the Buddhist faith, an available seat within one's own Pure Land, and the support of a Maha. Only then could one even attempt the path to Maha.

Jinlian's injury had been to his soul and divine abilities, directly shaking his Maha seat. Fortunately, Minghui's foundation was deep, and Jinlian, within his Pure Land, gave him his full support. Minghui had to settle for second best, first attaining the rank of Merciful One under the highest Golden Lotus seat. If not for that, all his preparations would have been wasted, adding centuries to his cultivation.

Minghui and Jinlian had long ago reached a silent agreement to never speak of the matter. Minghui even had a nagging suspicion that Jinlian's fervent support was partly an attempt to pull an ally onto his sinking ship. Now, facing Li Ximing, he didn't dare be too friendly, nor did he dare be hostile.

Li Ximing had been prepared for a cold reception. To his surprise, the monk before him sat up straight, a beaming, sincere smile on his face.

"So it is Daoist Master Zhaojing! This humble monk is Minghui! I've admired you for a long time!"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow in surprise. Minghui immediately followed up, "I was not always in the north. I traveled south in my early years and had the honor of crossing paths with one of your esteemed clan elders. I was so moved by his magnificent presence that my admiration for him knows no bounds!"

Li Ximing's expression turned strange. Changyun, finding the exchange amusing, explained, "After the Wrathful Manifestation fell, this Merciful One's Way of Joyful Bliss benefited greatly, and their Pure Land expanded. However, they have some friction with the Way of Emptiness—a dispute left over from the north-south conflict."

Li Ximing understood now. This monk was an enemy of the Way of Wrath and the Way of Emptiness. 'So, while most Buddhist cultivators are utter filth, this one clearly doesn't stink in the same way as the others,' he mused. 'And he's destined to become a Maha. No wonder Changyun is willing to meet with him.'

He gave a slight nod. Minghui smiled and said, "I calculated it long ago. I knew a Daoist friend would be visiting Daoist Friend Changyun today. He was still half in doubt…"

Daoist Master Changyun nodded, clearly wanting to steer the conversation away from his original discussion with Minghui. He interjected smoothly, "I underestimated the Merciful One's calculation arts. But I wonder… is there some matter you wished to discuss with me, Daoist Friend?"

Li Ximing naturally wanted to ask about Mount Xiaoshi, but he was wary of Minghui learning about it unnecessarily. He chose his words carefully. "It concerns the lineage of the Brahma Cloud Cave."

Minghui, sitting to the side, let out a hearty laugh to bolster his courage. "Ah, so it's about Mount Xiaoshi!"

A smile finally touched Changyun's lips. He poured tea and explained, "Everyone who knows of the Mount Xiaoshi affair is entitled to a share. There are benefits to be had from the formation. Since you, Zhaojing, have mastered the Floating Cloud Cave's lineage, you naturally have a claim. Mount Xiaoshi was breached by the Way of Emptiness, and it was originally a refuge for the Yue Cultivating Sect—a situation we allowed to happen. Therefore… the northern Buddhists are also aware of this."

Understanding began to dawn on Li Ximing. "In that case," he asked, "how is this formation to be opened?"

"Mount Xiaoshi is now a desolate wasteland, its heirs scattered. None of us wish to see that lineage re-established, which is why the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion were created. The key to opening the formation lies within those three sects."

Changyun took a sip of tea. "The secret arts of Mount Xiaoshi are divided into five lineages. Three of them became the current Three Sects of Secret Diffusion: the 'Floating Cloud Body,' the 'Hurricane Ghost Yin,' and the 'Empty Response Dispersion.' If the remaining two lineages can be gathered, the treasures of Mount Xiaoshi can be accessed."

Li Ximing pondered this for a moment before asking pointedly, "Are you saying that many of Mount Xiaoshi's lineages are scattered abroad?"

"Precisely!" Changyun laughed casually, but his next words carried a chilling weight. "Your guess is correct, Zhaojing. The Three Sects of Secret Diffusion are merely hooks. The remaining two lineages of Mount Xiaoshi are scattered to the four winds, their whereabouts unknown, but it is highly likely they are in the Eastern Sea."

"As long as the reputation of these three sects remains in Jiangbei, flying the banner of Mount Xiaoshi's secret arts, the descendants who inherit those lost lineages will eventually return once they achieve success. Whether it's to complete their heritage, find their kin, seek refuge, or simply find backing—for sentiment and for reason, they will have to come back."

"They are the bait we've cast into the river. All we have to do is wait for them to take the hook!"
