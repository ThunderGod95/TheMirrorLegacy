# Chapter 1126: The Treasure Urn

Shehu might not have possessed great skill, but after so many years of cultivation, he had developed a discerning eye. How could he fail to recognize the treasure in the sky? Terror seized his heart.

"Great Daoist Masters," he cried, "could there be a misunderstanding? I have cultivated in this place for many years and have never given any offense!"

Though his words begged for mercy, his actions were decisive. With a rapid flip, his brown robes tore apart as he transformed on the spot, swelling into a brown-feathered swan as vast as a mountain. Beneath his plumage, however, was a pair of vicious talons. His pupils were vertical slits, radiating a fierce, wolf-like cruelty.

This Demon beast's bloodline was clearly impressive. His transformation made the earth tremble and the mountains shake. Revealing a blood-red underbelly, he planted his talons beneath the Celestial Gate, attempting to heave it upward.

But the man in black armor stood atop the Celestial Gate, as immovable as Mount Taishi itself. No matter what divine ability Shehu unleashed, he could not budge the gate a single inch.

As that resplendent divine ability bore down, the scroll in the man's hand flared to life!

"Rumble!"

Beneath the mighty celestial pass, countless jagged peaks erupted from the earth—shards of white stone, sharp as swords. A powerful Bright Yang intent manifested as bells and drums chimed in unison. A river, winding through the newly formed peaks, cascaded down, locking Shehu's divine ability in place from every direction!

Shehu's face went visibly pale.

'This is bad... a fatal disaster!'

He had no time to think. A faint, authoritative whisper sounded in his ear, and the world around him visibly distorted. A flame so bright he couldn't open his eyes surged inward, about to engulf his dharma body.

Shehu possessed the technique 'Journeying North', which was supernaturally effective at evading fire. But this divine ability had a critical flaw—'Journeying North' relied on movement. Once he was suppressed and sealed off, disconnected from heaven and earth, he could no longer evade the flames!

A bone-deep chill seized him. His massive form instantly shrank, reforming into his human body. He quickly waved a sleeve, and a walnut-sized pearl dropped from his cuff. It spun, blooming with shields of green light to block the inferno.

His 'Upright Wood' took its aspect from metal; it was a wood-virtue power that feared fire the least. But this was the notorious Merging Fire! The green light immediately withered in the raging blaze, dissolving into coiling wisps of black smoke.

The Demon beast was horrified.

"High Immortals!" he screamed. "Where have I given offense? Is some villain framing me?"

There was no reply from outside. The flames merely trembled, and a golden gleam suddenly leaped out from within!

It was a long halberd, shimmering with light, its curved blade gleaming like the moon.

Shehu frantically waved his sleeve, summoning the copper basin. He heard a shattering sound. From beneath the heavy, shrouding copper light, a second halberd-shadow leaped out and smashed against the green light.

"Crack!"

His precious pearl was only a spirit embryo. It was already fading at a terrifying rate against the Merging Fire; how could it possibly withstand such a blow? It shattered into fragments. The flames surged forward, rushing to consume him.

He was struck with terror. He opened his massive mouth, revealing rows of densely packed fangs. Within that maw was a hellscape: rivers of blood, towers of bone, roiling yin souls, and the sound of countless wails!

The great Demon gathered the power and then blew.

"AOOO!"

A shriek like grinding metal and crashing thunder ripped through heaven and earth. Billowing yin qi erupted, finally causing the infinitely bright Celestial Gate to waver. Li Zhouwei finally gave the Demon a proper look.

"It seems," he nodded, "your thousand years weren't cultivated in vain."

Li Ximing, circulating his Life Divine Ability, also saw the attack's nature clearly and nodded in silent agreement.

Had it not been for the joint suppression of the divine ability and the Spiritual Treasure, that yin shriek was formidable. It would have forced even Li Ximing to halt his attack and defend with all his might. If caught off guard, he could have been injured!

Dense golden patterns lit up on Li Zhouwei's face. He set the long halberd to hang unsupported in the sky, then pressed both hands firmly onto the Celestial Gate.

The wavering portal stabilized once more.

Shehu had clearly cultivated that mouthful of yin qi for untold years. It was as vast as a sea of smoke, as boundless as a desert. Even as the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire and 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' continuously wore it down, the space beneath the gate grew increasingly dark.

But that was all it could do.

The darkness lasted for the better part of an hour before finally receding. The Demon beast's voice, still probing while pretending to beg, sounded out again. Li Ximing couldn't help but remark,

"The coordination between the Huai River Map and 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' is... truly terrifying."

Li Ximing sighed, but Li Zhouwei shook his head.

"His technique isn't weak. Unfortunately, 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' innately suppresses yin and evil and dissolves resentment. If he were from a different Dao lineage, his war of attrition might have actually been able to budge my divine ability."

But inside the rolling Merging Fire, Shehu was weeping, his eyes streaming. Every part of his body was in agony. Hundreds of years of accumulated power were gone in an instant, his Dharma Arts completely exhausted. He finally stopped holding back.

"Since you've come from Jiangnan, you must know my past! The spirit root... I'll offer the spirit root to you both! I only beg you to spare my life!"

The Merging Fire blazed on, relentless. The divine ability overhead, amplified by the Spiritual Treasure, was omnipotent. No matter how he struggled, it didn't waver. As strand after strand of bright white flame licked at his dharma body, Shehu fell into complete despair.

'Bright Yang is tyrannical, Merging Fire is vicious... My life is over!'

How could he not know the power of Bright Yang? The reputation of 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' was immense. If his own divine ability surpassed the youth above him, or if he could at least fight to a draw, this technique would be nothing to fear. But he had fallen into a state where he was inferior in both divine ability and Dao-Profundity. Pinned beneath it, his prayers were useless, his calls unanswered!

'If it were any other divine ability, I could still struggle. But with this technique above me, and my only Valley Water talisman already used...'

Knowing his life was forfeit, he still cried out,

"I'll give you my wealth, my life! I only beg for a trace of my True Spirit to escape!"

While he suffered in agony, burned by the Merging Fire, Li Ximing stood outside, riding the Heavenly Light. With two fingers extended, he directed the flames, a note of pleasant surprise in his voice.

"A spirit root! He really did have something good!"

He didn't relax his guard for a moment. Watching the situation inside, he saw the Demon beast was truly at his limit. He couldn't help but sigh,

"That was almost too easy. I definitely over-planned."

Li Zhouwei, however, was not surprised. He carefully examined the Spiritual Treasure in his hand.

"I wouldn't call it easy. Grand-uncle and I attacked together, with both our Spiritual Treasures. Against a mere Demon King from a remote corner, of course it was a simple capture."

He added, "We just had to prevent him from trying to take us down with him."

The Merging Fire burned for another moment before Li Ximing finally transformed into Heavenly Light and descended into the blaze.

Since ascending to the divine ability realm, this was only the second time Shehu had felt such utter despair. It was just like that time beneath the pagoda of the seven-life Maha's calamity, with no chance of escape. The same despair and loneliness from all those years ago flooded his mind, making him tremble. Scriptures even began to echo in his ears.

"I submit... I submit! Please, let me out!"

It seemed his various attempts at bribery had failed, but this simple plea worked. The Merging Fire on all sides dissipated. Shehu, robes in tatters and body covered in gray ash, knelt beneath the divine ability's pressure.

Seeing Li Ximing tread upon the light and approach, he put on a tear-streaked expression, no longer asking questions.

"I am willing to be your beast of burden, my lord..."

Li Ximing shook his head.

"When your Demon race attains the Dao, your very spirit is refined into your divine ability. What power do I have to make you an ox or a horse? We are both beings who have achieved divine abilities. There's no need for such empty words."

Shehu saw that even now, Li Ximing wouldn't release the suppression. He wept, 

"High cultivator, you must want my wealth and my life. I will offer them with both hands. I only hope to escape with a wisp of my True Spirit. I can find any random Demon body to possess. Once I lose my divine ability, my spirit will naturally separate from my True Spirit. You can then take it, and I will pledge my loyalty to you, my lord."

He added, "This little Demon has cultivated for many years, my Dao-Profundity is not shallow. I'm confident I can handle any Foundation Establishment Realm foe... I can even help guide your lordship's juniors..."

Li Ximing just smiled.

"You make it sound so appealing. But how could changing bodies and abandoning your form be so simple? In any case, I didn't come here specifically to eliminate you."

Shehu tried to speak again, but Li Ximing raised his sleeve, pinched his fingers to form a divine ability, and projected it at the Demon, chanting:

"Curb weapons and halt all sharpness, let there be no treacherous assault!"

'World's Radiance'.

A dim golden light shone down, locking the Demon beast in place. But Shehu had no intention of submitting. His eyes hardened, and he tensed, about to struggle!

But in that short instant, an urn appeared in Li Ximing's hand.

Heavenly Nurture Urn.

Store and Combine!

A puff of dim radiance gushed from the urn's mouth, expanding rapidly. Like a great whale inhaling water, it locked onto the Demon beast on the ground. Shehu was already at the end of his rope, exhausted, and held fast by the Life Divine Ability. Powerless to resist, he was pulled in and fell inside.

"Clink."

The light of the brilliant copper basin faded, and the azure-glowing pearl went dim. Only the empty robes, wrapped around a storage bag, drifted down, floating in the Heavenly Light.

But as the profound art of Grand Sacrifice activated, Li Ximing didn't even have time to grab the Spiritual Artifact. He felt his divine ability and dharma power draining rapidly. The urn in his hand sank, as if he were holding a small mountain. It was still struggling, emitting dull thuds, and for a moment, he almost lost his grip.

He hurriedly sat cross-legged, circulating his divine ability to stabilize the Spiritual Treasure. The radiance in the sky quickly faded. Li Zhouwei retrieved his Spiritual Artifact, stepped down through the air, and seeing Li Ximing drenched in sweat, reached out to help him steady the urn.

A full incense stick's time passed. The Spiritual Treasure finally absorbed a massive amount of divine ability and dharma power from them both and grew quiet, having thoroughly sealed the great Demon within. It remained, however, as heavy as a mountain.

'It's done! An Azure Talisman!'

'My family's first self-refined Azure Talisman!'

Li Ximing let out a long breath, his joy overflowing. He smiled.

"What a good treasure!"

He peered inside. The interior was dim and gloomy. The densely packed rice grains were gone, replaced by layer upon layer of coiling black clouds, looking sinister and terrifying.

This was the first time Li Ximing had seen such an art for capturing a person, let alone a master of divine abilities. He was quite amazed. Li Zhouwei then held up the copper basin.

The basin was thin, its light now dim. The patterns on it were indistinct, with only a few swirls of azure-bird-like color. But with the Li Clan's years of experience fighting Buddhist cultivators, both men quickly spotted the Buddhist traces on it.

"The original Maha must have obtained this Spiritual Artifact, made modifications to refine it, but then this Demon beast acquired it. Since he doesn't understand artifact refinement, it has sat unused."

The other item, the 'Upright Wood' spirit embryo, was of good quality. However, Shehu lacked the heritage and skills of humans, so his refinement technique was crude.

The robes were worthless, but the storage bag was heavy. Li Ximing was very satisfied.

"Since he escaped from that Maha, he must have grabbed plenty of spiritual items during the chaos. Plus, he was hiding a spirit root. After so many years of accumulation, he must have amassed a huge fortune."

"I'd wager he's no poorer than any cultivator on the mainland."

Li Zhouwei smiled, his golden eyes looking down at the Small Guang Kong Mountain below. The temple was completely empty, not a soul in sight. They had either hidden or fled.

The formation here was only at the Foundation Establishment Realm level. He shattered it with a flick of his finger. The two descended into the compound. The temple was dark and the corridors long. Below, a group of monks and nuns knelt, all in shackles. They had little or no cultivation and hadn't dared to flee, trembling in fear.

Li Zhouwei's gaze swept over them. He discovered that these so-called monks and nuns were actually cultivating the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. Shehu hadn't even dared to capture real Buddhists.

"It seems," he said, "that incident back then truly terrified him."

His golden eyes swept over them again. He found they weren't even qualified to be consumed for their blood-qi; they were all relatively "clean" cultivators. He stepped into the depths of the temple. Li Ximing followed, remarking,

"There are over a hundred with cultivation, and even more mortals. We can't take them back. The moment we leave, they'll probably end up filling the stomachs of other cultivators."

Li Zhouwei finally spoke.

"Xinggong Terrace just suffered a great loss of vitality. These people have clean cultivation. They could serve as outer disciples for Dao Mian. Besides, Grand-uncle, didn't you want to use a Spiritual Artifact to condense spiritual water?"

Li Ximing nodded slightly, falling into thought. Li Zhouwei continued impassively,

"Although that wondrous ability can condense the water on its own, we are not proficient in matters like the transformation of material properties. In my opinion, this kind of task is best left to a 'Whole Pill' cultivator. We should consult him. These people can serve as his payment."

Hearing this, Li Ximing immediately nodded.

"That is very considerate."

They entered the main hall and the attached living cave, but found nothing. It was appallingly poor. Li Zhouwei swept his golden eyes over the area, then closed them, connecting with the Immortal Mirror. He understood.

'The spirit root is in an underwater cave. Shehu established this Little Mountain of Vast Jade just to guard it.'

Before they could say more, a fierce wind howled outside. A streak of emerald light descended from the sky, taking the form of a falcon. It landed and transformed into a middle-aged man. He had sinister eyes, a broad forehead, and a slightly pale complexion. He glanced at the two of them, his expression clearly surprised, even doubtful.
'Shehu was dealt with this quickly? But I saw no major phenomenon. Could he have escaped?'

He cupped his hands.

"King Wei truly lives up to his reputation. Congratulations, fellow Daoists!"

This man was Yin Qin!

His body radiated a bright divine ability; his skills were clearly not small. Li Ximing smiled faintly and nodded in greeting. Yin Qin immediately asked,

"This Shehu..."

Li Ximing replied casually:

"We've collected him for pill refinement. No need for you to worry, fellow Daoist."

The words were quite terrifying. Paired with Li Ximing's casual expression and Li Zhouwei's continued silence, it created a strange deterrent effect. Yin Qin glanced at him, a trace of apprehension in his eyes, before replying,

"Since that's the case, let's divide the spoils here."

His gaze seemed perfectly calm. But Li Zhouwei, who had been silent all this time, suddenly spoke, his voice light:

"There's no need to probe, fellow Daoist. Let's go see the spirit root first."

Only then did a trace of disappointment flash deep in Yin Qin's eyes. His expression, however, showed no embarrassment. He smiled,

"But of course. Please!"
