# Chapter 875: Preparations

Since Lin Feng had offered it, Chen Yang didn't dare refuse. He let out a long sigh and said, "A treasure like this... it's worth more than all the wealth I've amassed in my entire life. All I did was lend you a small hand that day, and now I receive such a reward... Truly, heroes rise from the younger generation. I am utterly convinced!"

Fei Qingfei clearly enjoyed the flattery, nodding in satisfaction. Lin Feng, however, waved his hand, clearly intending to leave. "I have many affairs to deal with and cannot linger," he said casually. "Now that Qingya has been retrieved, we will return north. I must help her recover the cultivation progress she missed over the years. We won't impose any further."

"As for Uncle Tongcai and Uncle Tonglu, you should come with us for a visit. After all, Fei Qingfei hasn't seen you in years and misses you terribly!"

Lin Feng had befriended these two Fei family brothers back when he was only at the Embyronic Breathing Realm. Fei Tonglu was, after all, the Fei sisters' father, so Lin Feng naturally held him in high regard. Chen Yang was more than happy for them to leave. "Of course, of course," he said hurriedly. "Neither of you is particularly valued in the Fei family anyway. Go and have your reunion. I'll report it to the lakeside authorities and assign you two a nominal task to serve as a cover."

The Fei family's talent pool was dwindling. Fei Tongcai had once been a core figure, but after a trip north, the person inhabiting his body was no longer him. He had been relegated to the riverbank, fading from the family's sight. Because of this, both men were eager to go north and nodded repeatedly in agreement.

With Chen Yang smoothing the way, Lin Feng's group was satisfied. Even Fei Qingfei's incessant chatter finally ceased to be unpleasant. Prodded by Lin Feng, she cupped her hands in a respectful farewell. He mounted the wind and soared into the air, leading his entourage northward at extreme speed until they vanished over the horizon.

Chen Yang remained where he stood, cradling the long jade box.

Before he could even react, the scent of pine resin filled the air. A figure in white robes materialized on the peak. Ning Wan, cradling a sword, stepped silently into the courtyard. The sight terrified Chen Yang, who immediately dropped to his knees. "Greetings, Daoist Master!" he stammered.

The Fei family woman cowering in the corner, along with the other bewildered family members, all bowed deeply. Chen Yang hurriedly held up the long box. "Daoist Master, please inspect this!"

Ning Wan nodded faintly. She picked up the sword, Black Creek. She examined it meticulously from tip to pommel but found nothing amiss.

She sighed softly. "It is truly from the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition. It has the distinct aura of the Wanling Upper Sect from the late ancient era..."

Only a few breaths passed before several streaks of light descended upon the peak. Li Jiangqian arrived, accompanied by the Fei family's own Fei Qing'yi. Both bowed deeply in greeting. "Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Ning Wan exhaled, appearing much more relaxed. "Congratulations," she said. "This is a boon, not a curse. Has Zhaojing gone to the Southern Borderlands?"

Although Ning Wan was asking a question to which she likely already knew the answer, it was a necessary formality. Li Jiangqian replied, "Thanks to the Daoist Master's blessed protection, our Old Ancestor has already departed for the Southern Borderlands. Before he left, he gave explicit orders: all matters on the riverbank are to be handled according to the Daoist Master's decree!"

Ning Wan inclined her head. "Your family's Daoist Master may be absent, but Fei Qingya's future is now settled. I expect that with 'his' support, she will be bordering on the Foundation Establishment Realm by the time she returns. The Great Xiukui Monastery will come for her personally, so your esteemed family need not be troubled."

She continued softly, "I know that yours is a family of Sword Immortals. Of those people and their swords... some must be set aside for you."

Li Jiangqian simply nodded in acknowledgment.

Ning Wan sighed. "Heart-Piercing is with Song Yunbai. That 'Cheng Yun' fellow is somewhat interesting, so it would be improper to seize his Dharma Sword. Bai Yinzi is a lost cause; who knows how many days he has left? Falling Cassia should be easier to acquire. Sea-Parting is in Han Li's possession, but his movements are extremely secretive..."

She seemed to be pondering 'his' earlier words. "He has already scoured the entire Daoist tradition..." she murmured, lost in thought.

Hearing her mutter, Li Jiangqian was struck by the exact same doubt.

Years ago, when Daoist Master Changyun met Li Ximing, he had specifically mentioned this Daoist tradition! The surrounding Daoist Masters didn't covet Secret Diffusion for a few mere dharma artifacts; they knew the tradition definitely contained Ancient Spiritual Artifacts!

If the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition held Ancient Spiritual Artifacts, then Lin Feng's so-called trump card was far more than just that Geng-Metal spirit embryo. He had to possess one or more Spiritual Artifacts, or even Ancient Spiritual Artifacts.

Ning Wan's thoughts mirrored his, but from her higher vantage point, she could predict more of the future.

'With this interference on the northern stage, 'he' is the only one who can enter or leave the Secret Diffusion secret realm. He has surely plundered it clean. We can't expect it to just fall into our laps...'

'He has also stayed in Jiangbei long enough. Once he cultivates to the late Foundation Establishment Realm, he'll head north to seek his breakthrough, likely having to punch through a blockade of Buddhist cultivators to do it.'

'But when he leaves, he's bound to distribute treasures among his comrades and lovers. This isn't just about saving one person. The Ancient Spiritual Artifacts are a lost causehe'll certainly keep those. But if that Daoist tradition held enough Spiritual Artifacts, he will definitely leave one or two behind... That will trigger another battle! I fear even the overseas powers will get involved.'

Ning Wan was deeply concerned. She looked at the Li family members, her expression conflicted. "The Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition is a great prize," she said quietly. "Another conflict is inevitable. Choose what you desire ahead of time... lest you end up with nothing for all your efforts."

As she finished speaking, she seemed to sense somethingfighting had apparently broken out again in Jiangbei. With a gentle wave of her hand, she dissolved into flurries of wind and snow.

"Thank you for the reminder, Daoist Master!"

How could Li Jiangqian fail to grasp her meaning? Despite the Jiangbei group's current prominence, the moment Lin Feng left, every last one of them would be fish on the chopping block.

He waited until the last flurry of snow had dissipated before rising to his feet. His gaze remained fixed on the Black Creek.

The Dharma Sword was simple yet elegant. The guard was precisely the same width as the blade, a feature that instantly captivated him.

'It's so similar... just too similar...'

Maintaining a neutral expression, he picked up the pitch-black sword and examined it closely, as if admiring its unique craftsmanship. "So this is the Secret Diffusion style of sword-making..." he remarked.

The Azure Pond truly possessed only one Spiritual Sword that could be called a Purple Mansion Realm weapon: the Great Snow's Severing Edge. However, Jiangnan had many sword cultivators, and their Way of the Sword differed from other paths. The "Spiritual Swords" or "Immortal Swords" they spoke of often referred to any blade that had been tempered by a proven Sword Intent and had thus given birth to its own spirituality. Thus, the words "Purple Mansion" were often added to Great Snow's Severing Edge to emphasize its unique status.

This Black Creek before him had already developed spirituality, making it exceptionally valuable. As Chen Yang relayed the information he had, Li Jiangqian listened, slowly sinking into contemplation.

'Four Dharma Swords, scattered to different parties, plus one Geng-Metal spirit embryo in the Great Void... I wonder which one it is.'

Li Jiangqian still held the memory of that gray sword from years ago. He turned Black Creek over. The pommel was completely unadorned. A sliver of hope rose in him as he studied it.

'This sword is bound to be used in combat. If a major battle breaks out in Jiangbei, the spirit embryo might be revealed. Then I'll know.'

'Before that happens, I must quickly gather descriptions or images of the other Dharma Swords!'

Li Jiangqian glanced around and commanded, "Bring Qu Bushi up here!"

Fei Qing'yi, who had been listening intently, was now, after hearing Ning Wan's warning, utterly convinced of the excuses Li Jiangqian had fed him earlier. He hurried off at once to summon the man.

The old man soon landed, riding the wind. "Any news?" Li Jiangqian asked quietly.

Qu Bushi bowed. "Reporting to the Family Head: that Yaosa Chengmi was pushing its luck in Xuanmiao Temple's territory. Now, the Daoist Master from Xuanmiao Temple has also vanished. I hear their marketplace was breached, and many valuables were stolen."

It didn't sound like a major issue to Li Jiangqian. "The Daoist Master has already warned us that these individuals are all chosen prodigies," he said evenly. "You and Chen Yang coordinate. Track down information on them by name, and get portraits drawn of each."

"Yes!" Chen Yang bowed.

Only then did Li Jiangqian add, as if it were an afterthought, "And find out everything you can about their clothing and dharma artifacts."

...

The Grotto-heaven was shrouded in mist.

A pale white platform stretched to the horizon, dotted with gently swaying osmanthus trees. In the sky, the sun and moon shone simultaneously, their brilliance competing. Above them both, at the very zenith, the sky turned a translucent gray, revealing a glimpse of another world beyond.

That distant heaven was dim, populated by massive, shifting silhouettes that cast faint, complex layers of light down upon the pale world below.

Lu Jiangxian stood within his Grotto-heaven, gazing into the distant Great Void.

The splendor emanating from the Great Void above Jiangbei was clearly visible even from the northern bank. He was certain more than one True Monarch was observing. To be cautious, his true body hadn't even crossed the riverbank, remaining concealed on Moongaze Lake.

'Who knows what methods Great Ancestor Wei has,' Lu Jiangxian mused. 'But judging from the Metallic Essence within the Sun Seeker Ring, that man is likely deeply entangled with me. Not to mention... the current Li family also bears the name Li.'

The moment Lin Feng crossed Moongaze Lake, the Metallic Essence within his Immortal Mirror became agitated. It tried several times to burst free and fly to Lin Feng. If it were still in the Sun Seeker Ring, it would have undoubtedly broken free and returned to its original master.

Fortunately, the Immortal Mirror's hierarchical power was immense, and it firmly suppressed the Bright Yang Metallic Essence, keeping it stable.

And in the Great Void... Ning Wan was not the only observer.

He sighed, and a new scene manifested. Above Cold Cloud Peak on the northern bank, the Great Void was still. A cultivator was standing there.

The man wore practical robes of black and gray, with a white-edged straight collar and a large right-side flap. He wore a Daoist crown and had a small gourd tied at his waist. His long beard was jet black. He stood utterly silent in the Great Void, shrouded by some profound concealment technique that left Ning Wan completely unaware of his presence.

The man had a long face with slightly high cheekbones, but this was offset by a pair of sharp phoenix eyes that gave him a dignified, righteous appearance. His eyes seemed to contain light as he gazed quietly at Moongaze Lake from within the Great Void.

Although his cultivation was masked by profound techniques, it couldn't escape Lu Jiangxian's divine sense. The man had reached the very peak of the Purple Mansion Realm, having perfected five great Divine Abilities!

Behind this Great Daoist Master, six sharp, three-foot-long flying swords stood vertically like a screen, their pommels aligned. A faint, colorful radiance pulsed from them, containing a terrifying, suppressed power.

'Mount Luoxia!'

A Great Daoist Master of this caliberone who could be considered peerless in all of Jiangnanwas here merely to supervise matters across the river on behalf of a True Monarch.

He paid no attention to the Li family members, nor did he spare Ning Wan a second glance. He didn't even seem to notice Lin Feng. This cultivator from Mount Luoxia was supremely confident, his gaze locked entirely on Moongaze Lake.

With his hands clasped behind him, his expression was melancholic. His gaze drifted over the cultivators below, as if he were mourning the Moonlight Origin Mansion that had once ruled this land.

When his gaze returned, Fei Qingfei was chattering incessantly, bragging about her "Big Brother Lin." The Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia showed no disdain, no arrogance; he simply watched with placid calm.

Only when Lin Feng returned to Jiangbei, re-entering the "game," did the man turn to leave without a trace of reluctance. He dissipated into a haze of colorful light, clearly having been eager to depart.

From start to finish, this Great Daoist Master from Mount Luoxia had never once shown the slightest regard for the Daoist traditions of Jiangnan.

'Mount Luoxia...'

From that single glimpse, Lu Jiangxian perceived the chasm between them.

'Those six blades behind him are not swords for the Way of the Sword; they are 'focus' swords for casting techniques. But all six are Ancient Spiritual Artifactswhat cultivators in Jiangnan commonly call Spiritual Treasures.'

'A True Monarch doesn't even need to intervene. As long as that man is in Jiangbei, unless someone uses a Golden Core-level trump card, the entire Supreme Yang Dao could be wiped out, and they still wouldn't be able to lay a finger on Lin Feng.'

'This... this is the real power of Wu Light's Mount Luoxia!'

Knowing full well the enemy's terrifying power, Lu Jiangxian had been biding his time, waiting for the True Monarchs to depart. Several of them were looming in the Great Void right over Jiangbei, perilously close to the lake. Although his Grotto-heaven was safely hidden within the Immortal Mirror, he couldn't predict what sort of reaction it might provoke if a Li family cultivator suddenly vanished into it.

But right now, the Immortal Mirror fragment was even more important!

He had already inspected Lin Feng. A long sword was hidden on his person. It was slightly longer than Black Creek and also possessed a long, slender hilt. The blade was sealed by layer upon layer of a black, cloth-like dharma artifact, and it was locked deep within his Sea of Qi.

'A Geng-Metal, sword-shaped spirit embryo...'

There were five swords in play. Four were Foundation Establishment-level Dharma Swords that had been given away. The fifth was the spirit embryo. If Lin Feng was telling the truththat he had scoured the entire Secret Diffusion Daoist traditionthen the fragment was almost certainly in one of those five blades.

The Geng-Metal spirit embryo was sealed, submerged in the Sea of Qi, and shrouded in that black cloth, making its aura completely indiscernible. Lu Jiangxian, wary of triggering an unforeseen reaction, did not dare to probe too deeply into the Sea of Qi.

Furthermore, the glimpses that Lu Jiangxian and the other Li family members saw through their unique connection were only visualthey carried no aura. But they did provide one crucial piece of information: the blade's proportions.

'Even wrapped in cloth, the fundamental shape of the sword won't change much. Based on its length, this is probably not the fragment I saw all those years ago.'

'Therefore, ruling this one out, the fragment must be in one of the remaining Foundation Establishment-level Dharma Swords.'

This discovery brought a small measure of relief to Lu Jiangxian.

The Immortal Mirror fragments were not useless; each had a purpose, but their nature was deeply concealed. Ordinary cultivators, even those at the Golden Core realm, couldn't discern a fragment's function. Their divine sense would sweep right over it, registering it as a mundane object.

This opened up many possibilities.

'Lin Feng never specified the total number of Secret Diffusion Dharma Swords, only that he'd acquired four. It's possible the fragment is an accessory hanging from the hilt of one of those four. It's also possible... that particular Dharma Sword was never removed and is still inside the Secret Diffusion secret realm!'

'This counts as good news. A Dharma Sword is inherently less valuable. No matter how difficult it is to obtain, it can't possibly be more difficult than prying that spirit embryo from a True Monarch's Sea of Qi!'

Lu Jiangxian's mind eased considerably.

'Let Li Jiangqian investigate first. The moment those True Monarchs leave and the board in Jiangbei is clear, Li Ximing will depart!'
