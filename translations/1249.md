# Chapter 1249: Schemes and Strategies

‘King Wei… intends to move troops against Luoxia!’

Li Zhouwei's words were sharp and decisive, stunning Li Que'wan at his side, let alone Li Jiangchun, who felt a surge of shock and joy rush to his mind in a moment of sudden realization:

‘So that’s how it is! King Wei intends to capitalize on the world’s inability to predict he could resolve the Wu Earth calamity with such speed, thereby launching a surprise attack to conquer Luoxia!’

Just as Li Zhouwei had said, the Western Shu was now severely weakened, there was still no word from the Profound Governance Pavilion, and the major powers of the north were unable to unite. As the weakest of all factions, the great clans of Luoxia, having lost the protection of the Profound Governance Pavilion, were truly a ripe piece of meat for the taking!

His eyes burning with fervor, he raised his head to look at Li Zhouwei and said with a lowered gaze:

“Your Majesty’s strategies are divine… This junior also had an urgent matter to report. As of now, that Wei Xuanyin—has already entered seclusion!”

At these words, Li Zhouwei abruptly stood up, a look of astonishment welling in his eyes as he asked in a low voice:

“Is this true?”

“Absolutely true!”

Li Zhouwei could, of course, see that Wei Xuanyin had been avoiding a confrontation with him, doing his best not to engage. During their encounter on Lake Xian all those years ago, he had sensed a completely different divine ability from the man… Even Qi Lanyan, who had given his all to stop him and ultimately paid with his life, had a true purpose that Li Zhouwei could discern.

Wei Xuanyin’s intent could be summarized in four words:

Mutual assured destruction.

Regardless of the motive, Li Zhouwei could vaguely sense the other's apprehension. Even in today's planning, he was fairly certain Wei Xuanyin would not intervene, but no amount of estimation was as direct as Wei Xuanyin entering seclusion!

‘As long as this man makes no move, and we placate the Gao and Shanle clans on the other side, the Great Song’s chances of conquering Luoxia with its full might will increase by thirty percent!’

One had to know that the Great Song of today was a far cry from what it once was; he, Li Zhouwei, was more than capable of holding his own, and neither of the two newly surrendered fellows from Jianghuai was a simpleton! And what’s more, there was that Dui Metal Sword Immortal!

‘With this Sword Immortal present, if the Buddhist cultivators really decide to go all out to stop us, every single one of them had better be prepared to perish!’

An uncertain light flickered in his eyes, while Li Jiangchun lowered his head and replied:

“He has already secretly entered secluded cultivation, attempting to refine his final divine ability! This was originally an internal matter of the Great Zhao, but there is discord among them, and the Buddhist cultivators’ repeated probing of this man was instead discovered by the Yang Clan!”

He stated solemnly:

“This was something my fourth sister-in-law secretly mentioned to Father during the palace banquet. She was extremely worried, fearing that when this man emerges from seclusion after many years with his five arts perfected, he would bring harm to Father… But from the looks of it now… it is instead our perfect opportunity!”

Li Zhouwei stood with his hands clasped behind his back, a peculiar expression on his face as he mused with a lowered gaze:

‘Yang Tianyou…’

‘Was this intentional? Or unintentional?’

These Purple Mansion Realm cultivators could not accurately predict Li Zhouwei's recovery time, but the major Daoist Traditions would never underestimate it; when Li Que'wan went to the Zhang Clan and mentioned Li Zhouwei was severely injured, Tianhuo did not believe it for a second!

‘No matter how late their predictions are, they won't be off by much. That's a point that’s difficult to hide from them. It’s just that they can hardly anticipate my current Dao-Profundity, nor the immortal foundation that my Talisman Qi nourished on its own while I was injured and fighting. It only appears to them that a continuous series of major upheavals has left me with no opportunity to break through to the Purple Mystery…’

‘However, Yang Tianyou’s words were not spoken without reason. Either the Song Emperor or the Yang Clan must already have designs on conquering the north!’

This was ultimately a good thing. Li Zhouwei nodded to himself and asked:

“Is there any news of Yang Ruiyi?”

This Grand General of the Great Song had laid down his armor for many years and vanished without a trace. Li Jiangchun also shook his head, saying softly:

“After the great battle on the Jianghuai, King Wei returned victorious. In less than half a year, he laid down his armor and returned home, and there has been no news since. According to my fourth sister-in-law, the Grand General is in deep seclusion, seeking his fourth divine ability!”

“If he succeeds, he will become an ‘Upper Shaman’ Great Daoist Master!”

Li Zhouwei was not surprised, only remarking:

“If His Majesty is willing to put forth his full effort, the day he emerges won’t be far off.”

“It’s just the Yang Clan’s side…”

At court, the Grand General and the Song Emperor had always maintained a relationship that was neither too close nor too distant, and the figures they promoted were never used by the other. Yang Ruiyi was also seen as the Yang Clan’s representative. Li Jiangchun could not help but ask about this, only to see this King of Wei smile and shake his head.

“Not at all… The Grand General is, in fact, the Song Emperor’s most loyal supporter!”

He glanced at Li Que'wan beside him, seemingly offering casual guidance as he spoke softly:

“The Song Emperor, the Yang Clan, and the Underworld may appear as one, but their internal divisions are pronounced. As long as it doesn’t cross a bottom line, the Yang Clan is the Song Emperor’s greatest asset. The ‘Yang Clan’ here includes Yang Ruiyi, Yang Ruizao, and also the low-to-mid-ranking Yang family members in the Underworld behind him.”

“They are desperate for the Song Emperor to achieve the Dao so that the Yang family can ascend to the status of a premier clan like the Wang and Xie.”

From his earliest meeting with Yang Tianya to the later battle at Lake Xian and Liu Bai’s suicide, Li Zhouwei had gradually come to understand the situation, and he said coolly:

“But that doesn’t include one person—that Judge Yang.”

“He is the true representative of the Underworld's interests, the greater player on the board. Judge Yang can exist without the Yang Clan, but the Yang Clan cannot exist without him. The Great Song is the Yang Clan’s foundation, but it is merely a tool to him. Therein lies the distinction, and that is why Yang Ruiyi has been struggling to navigate the situation! The Yang family is only backed by certain mid-to-low-ranking members of the Underworld; they must carry out his orders while also hoping to preserve the Great Song’s strength in every way possible, and they are even more unwilling to harm Yang Zhuo…”

He stated calmly:

“As long as the Song Emperor is determined to march north, it is highly unlikely the Yang Clan will hold back.”

“This junior has been enlightened!”

Li Jiangchun nodded thoughtfully. Li Que'wan, having waited for some time, finally spoke with a hint of worry:

“I’ve heard… that the Second Prince has had some entanglements with you…”

Over the years, Li Zhouwei had either been in deep cultivation or out on campaigns, paying little attention to such matters. Li Que'wan, however, had always kept an eye out. The news had even reached the ears of the old master, Li Xuanxuan. Unwilling to scold his own Sword Immortal, the old man wrote a letter to reprimand Li Zhouluo, which gave the Marquis of Anyang quite a scare.

Li Jiangchun gave a wry smile and shook his head, answering:

“That is untrue!”

Li Zhouwei looked up and asked with great interest:

“These three sons of the Song Emperor, what are they like?”

Li Jiangchun’s expression turned serious:

“The First Prince is diligent in political affairs, adept at winning people’s hearts, governs with love for the people, and has the air of a monarch… I have met him a few times, and I even saw him administering policies some time ago. However…”

He lowered his gaze and said:

“In this junior’s view, he has only inherited the Emperor’s intelligence and ambition, but not his divine and martial temperament. His love for the people is largely feigned, his diligence in governance is mostly for selfish reasons, and his actions are clear-sighted but lack affection. He possesses a heart prone to jealousy and tyranny. He is fit to be the ruler of a nation, but not an emperor of the Tianwu lineage.”

“In a word, he is not benevolent.”

This criticism was exceedingly sharp, and coming from this Sword Immortal who had met the emperor, it would be a huge blow to the First Prince’s prestige if it got out.

“As for the Second Prince…”

Li Jiangchun shook his head with a touch of helplessness and said:

“Although he frequently causes trouble, he has a pure heart. When he heard I had returned to the lake and even lost my treasured sword, he declared that as long as I did not return, no one in the imperial capital was worthy of making him draw his sword…”

“This man inherited the Emperor’s straightforwardness and is also an extremely intelligent person. His ambitions lie not in imperial rule, nor in cultivation, but rather in the arts of the sword, alchemy, and artifact refinement. Yet, his playful nature is too strong; he is scattered and lacks focus. Being overly intelligent, he tends to only scratch the surface of everything…”

He sighed:

“He does not look like a monarch.”

Evidently, even though Li Jiangchun had a better impression of the Second Prince, his final words remained sharp and to the point.

He pondered for a long while before saying:

“As for the Third Prince.”

This gave him pause:

“I have never even met him once. I hear he is a once-in-a-millennium genius of the Yang Clan, deeply immersed in cultivation. I have no idea what level his cultivation has reached now. In this junior’s opinion…”

“He will not participate in the struggle for the imperial throne. Instead, he serves as the Yang Clan’s backup plan to ride the momentum, waiting for a critical moment to seek an Auxiliary Position or an Intercalary Position by relying on a state of achieving the Dao through True Qi, so as to ensure the Yang Clan’s everlasting prosperity!”

After listening for a while, Li Zhouwei looked thoughtful and said softly:

“Ambitious, capable, and the eldest son by the primary wife. From this, it seems that if the Song Emperor must ultimately choose a crown prince, it will be the First Prince nine times out of ten.”

Li Jiangchun nodded, while Li Que'wan said in a low voice:

“Should we… make arrangements in advance…”

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow and shook his head:

“That won’t be necessary. We have nothing to ask of him, and what we want, he is not qualified to give. It’s fine to go with the flow, but being too deliberate would be counterproductive.”

Li Jiangchun bowed deeply, relayed the major events of recent years as well as Li Suichu’s worries from before he left, and said without hesitation:

“In that case, this junior will set off immediately!”

Li Zhouwei nodded, a faint smile suddenly touching his brow as he said:
“Your father… how is his ‘work’ coming along?”

Li Que'wan was completely bewildered, while Li Jiangchun was stunned for a moment before it dawned on him. He gave an awkward laugh and said:

“Father… has received the old master’s orders and has been ‘working hard’ every day. Aside from the ones he found himself, the Emperor also gifted him several concubines… However… there hasn’t been any news yet…”

Only upon hearing this did Li Que'wan understand what was meant by 'work'. She was overcome with embarrassment, lowering her head with a flushed face and saying nothing. Li Zhouwei, however, paced with his hands behind his back, casually asking about daily life before sighing:

“There is a saying that is quite true: children are a matter of heavenly fate. One can only hope for a greater chance… Although the family means well, still… one shouldn't force it.”

A strange light flickered in his eyes and quickly vanished. He watched the Sword Immortal bow and take his leave. Only then did Li Que'wan turn around and say with some concern:

“King Wei is going to conquer Luoxia, but the Purple Mystery…”

Li Zhouwei did not elaborate, only saying:

“It’s of no concern. Just focus on your cultivation.”

Li Que'wan could only nod. She then reminded him:

“It’s been some time since we borrowed the Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure from the Nine Mounds. It should have been returned, but for fear of exposing that Your Majesty’s injuries had healed, its return was delayed. It is still in my hands.”

Her expression darkened:

“Before we set out, we can use it one last time!”

A hint of joy flowed through Li Zhouwei’s eyes as he said:

“Excellent.”

This Spiritual Treasure was no ordinary item. Although it could not conceal an entire battlefield like an Exiled Qi Spiritual Treasure, it could augment an individual. Back then, Li Que'wan had used this item to conceal Li Ximing, who was wielding the Great Parting's Radiance, and could have heavily injured a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with a surprise attack—but what if the one being concealed was Li Zhouwei?

No matter which corner of the battlefield this King of Wei emerged from, he would be able to turn the tide of the battle!

Li Zhouwei nodded and said seriously:

“Your elder brother is in seclusion seeking a divine ability; he likely cannot be disturbed for the next few years. Who knows when Uncle-Grandfather will succeed with his pills. I had originally planned to visit Xiukui, but now it seems I can only postpone it further. As for Yuzhi’s matter, I’ll have to ask you to make a trip.”

Li Que'wan said gently:

“You can leave this matter to me. After all, Chengyun already helped us acquire the item several years ago, and when Senior Liu came, he also brought back the Profound-Name Dao-Malice. Using this opportunity, I’ll go to Senior Zhong’s place, retrieve the Eight-Ghost-Faced Frontier, and trade it for the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass. Although Xiukui doesn’t say anything, it’s not good for us to borrow someone else’s property for so long…”

Li Zhouwei agreed and fell silent for a long time, seemingly pondering something. Several breaths passed before he spoke in a low, resonant voice:

“Que'wan, has there been any change in the Yin-Leap Qi?”

Li Que'wan was taken aback, then contemplated for a moment:

“The Yin-Leap Qi can be considered mid-to-high grade among Supreme Yin energies… With the transformations of the Art of Demoting Yin, a considerable amount of spiritual qi can be converted from it…”

Li Zhouwei said with a smile:

“What if it is transformed into ‘Veiled Yin’?”

These words made Li Que'wan fall silent for a moment as she pinched her fingers to make calculations. She had been the one to transform this spiritual qi back then, so she was quite familiar with it. After a good while, a strange look appeared on her face:

“Of the three yin, Supreme Yin is the foremost. This qi seems… to be quite close to ‘Veiled Yin’. As for the specific changes, I am not a cultivator of the three yin, nor do I have the secret arts, so the various transformations within are beyond my knowledge.”

Li Que'wan was no fool; just from that one question, she faintly understood:

‘Veiled Yin…’

In the world today, how many famous Veiled Yin cultivators were there? The two words were associated with very few prominent Dao lineaes. She said in a low voice:

“Your Majesty means… Wei Xuanyin?!”

It was certainly possible that Wei Xuanyin was intentionally avoiding her King of Wei by feigning secluded cultivation, but since the information the Yang Clan obtained was that he sought a fifth divine ability, it was most likely true.

Li Zhouwei smiled:

“It’s not impossible!”

Li Que'wan’s heart pounded:

“That’s right. Bai Ziyu also went to the Profound Governance Pavilion back then and was given great responsibilities by him. So that was the plan all along!”

Li Zhouwei nodded as if it did not concern him at all, but Li Que'wan frowned and said in a low voice:

“He kept making concessions back then, all for today? To perfect his five arts and then come to suppress Your Majesty? If so, aren’t we arming the enemy?!”

“Arming the enemy?”

The smile on Li Zhouwei's face deepened as he said coolly:

“If he is a friend, there will be a time for that friendship to last. If he is an enemy, even if he came openly to ask for it, I would give him this spiritual qi—if his five arts are not perfected, how can he be worthy of being my opponent?”

His tone was natural, laced with a hint of anticipatory laughter. Li Que'wan was shaken, and couldn't help but smile:

“My perspective was too narrow!”

She reached into her sleeve and took out a small jade bottle, saying seriously:

“The second portion of Imperial Sun-March Sha has long been prepared!”

Li Zhouwei had calculated the time perfectly; the five years it took to complete his cultivation and elevate his immortal foundation was also the exact amount of time needed to condense one portion of this spiritual qi. He waved his sleeve and accepted it. The woman bowed, her expression relaxing as she beamed with a charming smile:

“This junior will go handle matters first!”

Li Zhouwei watched her ride the wind away, then took a step forward. The radiance of the sun and moon instantly surged forth, filling the heavens and the earth, yet his face was lost in deep thought.

‘With this, there are few variables left that can interfere with me. However, the north is vast and resourceful, and there are still several Great Daoist Masters. If they all arrive at that time, there will inevitably be trouble…’

He sat cross-legged, flicked his finger to shatter the jade bottle, and a brilliant radiance leaped out, pouring through his lips and teeth. A torrent of spiritual energy converged!

‘The second strand of ‘Imperial Observation of the Origin’!’
