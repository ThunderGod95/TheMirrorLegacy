# Chapter 656: The Purple Mansion Realm Technique

"A Grade Five Purple Mansion Realm cultivation technique—Radiant Essence Scripture." The weight of these words was immense. Even a fragment of this statement was enough to make one jump to their feet.

Li Xuanxuan's eyes widened as he asked in shock, "A Purple Mansion Realm technique?"

The Li Family wasn't entirely lacking in Purple Mansion Realm techniques. In fact, compared to other regions, Moongaze Lake, due to the Jiang Family's fragmentation, was one of the few places with an unusually rich and complete repository of cultivation techniques.

In other places, such as the Yuan Family's Mushroom Forest Plain or the various prefectures of Azure Pond, it was rare to even have one full technique up to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Even techniques for the Six Chakras of the Embryonic Breathing Realm are divided into six separate sections, forcing cultivators to progress step by step, tightly restricted at every turn. Only in Moongaze Lake, lacking a central authority, could techniques flow more freely. Elsewhere, strict regulation was the norm.

But this was a Purple Mansion Realm technique—a complete and cultivable Purple Mansion Realm technique! It wasn't a fragmented remnant, nor was it a lost art from ancient times.

Even in a world where techniques were tightly controlled, and even in the chaotic free-for-all of the outer seas, Purple Mansion Realm techniques remained the most closely guarded secrets. They were the keys to elevating a family to the status of an immortal sect—a path to ascendancy. No wonder the revelation left the three utterly shaken.

The elder's beard trembled as he hastily grabbed a bamboo slip from the table. The clatter of wooden cases hitting the ground echoed as he snatched up a brush with his other hand and urgently said, "Wei'er, come… write it down immediately!"

His tone was rushed, almost as if he feared the boy would vanish at any moment, adopting a coaxing tone as though speaking to a child. Li Zhouwei obediently took the bamboo slip and, with a small hand guiding the brush, began to write. As he worked, he murmured, "It is a shame… this technique only goes up to the early Purple Mansion Realm and condenses the first… so-called divine ability…"

"It really is a Bright Yang Purple Mansion Realm technique." Li Qinghong's expression showed a trace of envy. Her own cultivation method capped at the late Foundation Establishment Realm. No matter how great her talent, she had no opportunity to even attempt breaking into the Purple Mansion Realm. Her eyes lingered on the bamboo slip, and she softly remarked, "What a great opportunity…"

Li Xijun's face lit up with a joyful smile, his long-suppressed expression finally breaking free. The intricate plans in his mind, which had been disrupted beyond recognition, suddenly didn't matter as he laughed out loud and asked, "Is Ximing still in seclusion? He has got some good luck as well! We have been worrying so much for him, but now it looks like his path is set too."

"You are still thinking about him!" Li Xuanxuan chuckled, though his gaze never left the young boy in front of him. There was something familiar in the child's demeanor and movements, a feeling he couldn't quite place no matter how hard he thought about it.

Before long, Li Zhouwei had finished transcribing the cultivation technique. Li Xuanxuan took the completed transcription and read it carefully from beginning to end, then slowly sat down to the side. A wide smile spread across his wrinkled face.

Clutching the technique, he read through it again, slapping his thigh as he exclaimed, "What a marvelous Grade Five technique! It is truly the Golden Yang Radiant Origin! The Radiant Origin Pass!"

Li Xuanxuan slapped his thigh three times in quick succession, his face full of admiration. The sight made Li Qinghong smirk quietly. She leaned closer to Li Xijun and whispered, "It has been ages since the old man looked this happy. Honestly, I have never seen him like this since I was a child."

The aunt and nephew exchanged knowing smiles. After a long while, Li Xuanxuan finally seemed to snap out of his daze. Noticing the two of them and the child watching him with amusement, he hastily collected himself and spoke solemnly, "Come, all of you, take a look at this!"

Li Qinghong took the transcription and skimmed the earlier sections, focusing her attention on the final parts. These detailed how an Immortal Foundation could nurture and catalyze divine abilities, describing nine different methods, mantras, and the challenges to overcome in achieving them.

She couldn't resist reading aloud the poetic description of the divine abilities, "Flames surge within the heart, illuminating the inner and outer Yang. Thus, the Bright Yang Divine Ability forms. Its brilliance spans nine chi, purple flames flare outward, radiant clouds ascend and dissipate, golden armor and robes materialize across the heavens… The sun blazes red in the east, the earth erupts in the south, traversing the Great Void, refining golden lotuses…"

The Li Family had previously acquired a defunct cultivation technique known as the Aged Courtly Path Scripture, which was also of the Purple Mansion Realm. However, compared to the Radiant Essence Scripture, the Aged Courtly Path Scripture was far shorter in length and entirely lacked such vivid descriptions.

Li Xuanxuan glanced at Li Qinghong's face, which showed a mix of longing and admiration. He remarked, "So many people cultivate, so many reach Foundation Establishment Realm, but how many truly ascend to the Purple Mansion Realm? For such grandeur, only one in countless individuals can succeed."

Li Qinghong smiled faintly and didn't reply. Instead, she asked Li Zhouwei a few questions, confirming that he hadn't received the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra. She then commented softly, "It must be that the Bright Yang constitution conflicts with Supreme Yin. You will just have to cultivate diligently. Zhouwei is a sensible child. It is better not to tell your father about this—it could end up harming him."

As she spoke, her gaze remained fixed on Li Zhouwei's golden eyes, as though trying to gauge his emotions. The boy simply nodded lightly, his expression steady, and said quietly, "Wei'er understands."

He didn't elaborate, but there was a quiet authority in his tone that inspired confidence. Li Qinghong paused briefly, then nodded and replied, "Good." Turning to the others, she said gently, "Let us send Zhouwei down first. We should not keep Chengliao waiting."

Both of them nodded in agreement. Li Xuanxuan took a sip of tea and set his cup down. By the time he did, Li Qinghong had already returned from the hall as swiftly as a bolt of lightning. She stood by his side, her expression now serious.

"This trip back was not just for this matter," she continued in a low voice, "On my way through Green Pine Island, I met with Xizhi. According to news from Azure Pond, Li Encheng of Fuchen Peak is nearing the end of his lifespan and plans to attempt a breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm. He is now seeking assistance from our family."

Li Xuanxuan paused in surprise and asked, "That man… Does he even have a Purple Mansion Realm technique?"

Li Qinghong nodded, though her tone carried a trace of worry. "He does not. It is said he has been referencing similar techniques within the sect and concocting some pills on his own, risking everything for a last-ditch attempt before his death."

Li Xuanxuan's expression darkened with frustration. "We asked him to handle something for us, and he has not even finished the task. Now he is planning to die? What a waste of effort."

Li Qinghong nodded. She seemed to share his sentiment as she added, "Not just that. According to Xizhi, Li Encheng has not been of much help with family matters anyway. All this back-and-forth…"

From her sleeve, she produced a jade scroll densely packed with requests. "He is asking for rare medicinal herbs and spirit water, promising rewards after his breakthrough. But everyone knows the likelihood of success is slim to none. It is just a one-way trip."

Li Xijun accepted the jade scroll and read through it carefully. Items like Tongyuan Water and Changshan Spirit Stone were listed, totaling dozens of valuable resources. At the end, in small handwriting, there was an additional note, "If clues to Heavenly Pure Essence can be found, the rewards will be significant."

Li Xuanxuan glanced at the jade scroll and let out a derisive laugh, commenting, "If we truly possessed something as rare as Heavenly Pure Essence, would we simply hand it over to him? Preposterous!"

Li Xijun reread the contents of the scroll twice and spoke softly, "These items are indeed beyond what our family can afford. Aunt, brother, what are your thoughts?"

Li Qinghong responded, "That Li Encheng's younger brother, Li Enxi, a full-fledged Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, lowered himself to plead bitterly in your brother's hall, shedding tears and invoking the past favor of the Essence Gathering Pill and the ties between the Wei-Li Clan. Your brother found it difficult to outright refuse..."

"I understand." Li Xijun calmly put away the jade scroll and said softly, "I will gather one or two of these requested items. As for the rest, we will substitute them with similar Qi Cultivation Realm materials. We will expend some resources, send the package to Green Pine Island, and that will suffice."

Li Xijun continued, "The newly constructed formation at home has indeed strained our resources. Speak with Li Enxi and help him understand."

Li Qinghong nodded slightly and said quietly, "That is all we can do!"

Li Xuanxuan, however, winced as if in physical pain and reminded them, "Why should we always let him take advantage? Li Encheng has not done a thing for our family..."

Li Xijun understood his concern and replied gently, "Since Brother Zhi has agreed, he must have his own plans. We should do our best to support him."

Although reluctant, Li Xuanxuan trusted Li Xizhi's decisions. He relented and said, "You are right. Let us proceed with that plan."

Li Qinghong nodded and took the opportunity to relay the news she had gathered during her journey. Speaking softly, she added, "There is no rush to depart. Jun'er, handle the collection of materials first. We can leave in a few months."

Lijing Town.

Li Chengliao had been waiting anxiously on the mountain for quite some time. When he finally saw Li Qinghong returning with Li Zhouwei, she teased with a smile, "It has not been that long since we took him up the mountain, are you that reluctant to part with your family treasure?"

Li Chengliao laughed awkwardly, scooping up Li Zhouwei as they stepped onto the wind. They flew over the lake and entered the grand hall. As Li Chengliao observed his son, everything seemed the same as before, yet he felt there was a subtle change in the boy. He asked, "Wei'er, how was the mountain?"

Li Zhouwei seemed to be lost in thought, still savoring the scenes he had just experienced. He replied softly, "Father, there were many white irises on the mountain."

Li Chengliao paused, sensing the boy was speaking in riddles. But those seated in this central hall were no ordinary individuals. He raised his eyebrows slightly and began to think carefully.

It did not take long for him to pull a memory from the depths of his mind. That year, he was only twelve when he was sent to the mountain to have his aptitude assessed. His father, Li Xicheng, was not present, but he had gone with several younger siblings.

"The ancestral hall... soft cushions... Minggong... Chenghui..." As these hazy recollections sharpened, Li Chengliao remembered kneeling somewhere, his five senses sealed, before being led out and taught a spell.

Now that his knowledge far exceeded what it was then, he lowered his gaze and murmured, "Did they take you to the ancestral hall?"

Li Zhouwei raised his head to meet his father's eyes. His dark golden pupils flickered slightly as he replied softly, "Father has also been there?"

Li Chengliao nodded silently, his eyes reflecting deep thought. His mind raced, and in a low voice, he said, "I have been there, yes. They could not seal your sight, could they... No matter, Wei'er must understand."

Li Zhouwei seemed surprised, pausing briefly before answering, "Father, you ask too many questions."

Li Chengliao suddenly snapped out of his thoughts, momentarily at a loss for words. After a few moments of stunned silence, he laughed heartily, scooped up his son again, and said softly, "My mistake. I lost myself for a moment. My son possesses such divine bearing; he will never disappoint anyone."

He sighed and added, "But everything we do is for the good of the family..."

Li Zhouwei fixed his gaze on his father, as if studying his expression. In that moment, his dark golden eyes, as wild as a tiger's or leopard's, betrayed a hint of primal ferocity. But he silently absorbed the words, pondering them deeply.

A bright smile spread across his face as he tugged Li Chengliao into the grand hall. Picking up the long halberd at his side, he grinned and declared, "My halberd techniques have improved again. Let me demonstrate for Father!"

————

Eastern Mount Yue.

Rain dripped steadily as Yuan Fuyao completed a circuit around the town before retreating to his cave dwelling. Two servants approached him eagerly, asking for news.

Yuan Fuyao waved them off and replied, "The weather in northern Yue seems to be gradually returning to normal, though who knows how far the conflict between the two sects has progressed."

He sat down by the stone table and, after a moment, asked, "And at home... how is the Second Elder?"

The Yuan Family's internal strife had, like the shifting climate, begun to settle. Yuan Fuyao, who had spies within the family, was not entirely uninformed. His granduncle, Yuan Huyuan, no longer dared to return home. His father had disappeared without a word, leaving the Second Elder, Yuan Hudu, in full control of the situation.

Yuan Fuyao had long expected this outcome. With the backing of the Chi Family, how could the Second Elder lose? From the beginning, it had been a futile struggle—trapped prey lashing out pointlessly—only depleting the family's resources.

With the dust now settled, the Second Elder, Yuan Hudu, who had once shared a cordial relationship with Yuan Fuyao, now left him feeling conflicted and troubled, "Why on earth did they align with the Li Family? Once, I shared familial ties with Yuan Hudu and even benefited from his care. But now, this makes him my enemy... In this vast world, I am confined to this one small town!"

As Yuan Fuyao sat in his courtyard, sighing heavily, two of his attendants suddenly approached him with excited expressions, calling out, "Young Master! A letter has arrived from home!"

Yuan Fuyao quickly took the letter from them, eagerly scanning it from start to finish. His hands trembled as he read, finding the handwriting sharp and unmistakable. Upon closer inspection of the signature, it was indeed from Yuan Hudu!

Yuan Hudu's tone was courteous, and he thoroughly laid out his analysis in the letter, explaining every detail with transparency and clarity. He wrote:

"I am now in charge of the family, temporarily earning the trust of the Chi Family while letting Huyuan search for the Peak Master's whereabouts. This was all carefully planned with your father. For your part, I have arranged a marriage with a young lady from the Song Family. Please return home promptly."

"Your father has already made this promise, and it is unavoidable that you go through with it. The betrothal gifts are considerable, and the Li Family will surely demand them. If you have already obtained any of the items or clues regarding them, do not reveal anything. Find an excuse to leave Moongaze Lake and return home immediately. As long as you make it back safely, I will personally come to resolve the issue. Otherwise, if you fall into someone else's hands, you will become a pawn for their schemes, and there will be no way out."

Yuan Hudu explained everything thoroughly, even breaking down which factions the elders aligned with in their respective immortal sects. He ended with a warning, "The Li Family has aligned themselves with the Ning Family, who have been entrenched in the Southern Border for years. The Chi Family has long been displeased with this alliance... Your father only has you as his sole heir! Do not follow this path to destruction!"

Yuan Fuyao finished reading, drenched in sweat, with a sudden sense of clarity washing over him. Inwardly, he thought, Could it be true?! So, Father had already planned all this out! Were the elders merely acting all along?

He mulled over the situation repeatedly. However, the memory of Yuan Huyuan's expression on that day resurfaced in his mind, leaving him conflicted once more. Unsure of what to do, one of the Yuan Family attendants cautiously spoke up, "Young Master... the messenger said they will wait for you in the south at midnight... this..."

Yuan Fuyao was instantly shocked, exclaiming in frustration, "Why are you telling me this only now?!"

Looking at the moonlight in the sky, his composure faltered entirely. Never one to act decisively, he floundered like an ant on a hot griddle. One moment, he wanted to rush out; the next, he hesitated, feeling he needed to think things through a little more. Stomping his feet anxiously, he muttered, "What should I do? What should I do?!"
