# Chapter 1198: Awaiting the Profound (2)

Gardenia blossoms were scattered across the pristine white jade table. A purple jade slip was set down gently in the center. The man jotted a few words on a small missive to his left, then fell into contemplation.

‘The Trinary Yang Annual Radiance is the primary choice…’

The suggestions from Tinglan and Ning Wan showed no clear bias on the surface, but the varying lengths of the proposals for each formation array told a different story. Li Jiangqian could see the underlying preference—whether judged by the spiritual item's wondrous divine abilities or the ingenuity of the proposed designs, the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance was the foremost recommendation.

‘This isn't a decision to be rushed.’

Li Ximing had given specific instructions. In the World's Navel, where the arts of Valley Water were cultivated, there was a Daoist Master who specialized in collecting Lesser Yang items. He was known to be generous and was backed by a True Monarch who had been renowned for many years; he was certainly no miser. The Trinary Yang Annual Radiance was an item of immense value.

‘But the lands of Valley Water are in the far east. Daoist Master Guo is in seclusion, and no other Daoist Master in the family can make such a journey. Sending someone from the Foundation Establishment Realm… safety is a secondary concern. The real headache is that the Daoist Traditions of the World's Navel are hidden from the world. An ordinary junior cultivator could never find them, and Foundation Establishment cultivators can't traverse the Great Void. The round trip would take far too long!’

Li Jiangqian had made all these arrangements precisely to save time; how could he squander it like this? An idea sparked in his mind.

"In any case, I need to send these designs to Daoist Master Yuanbian for his review. I might as well send word for him to make the trip to the World's Navel on the family's behalf. Since he's one of us, and a master of formation arrays besides, he can be trusted to make the right decision!"

He had already been planning the handover to the Eastern Sea contingent. Days ago, he had recalled a group from the outer territories to report on their duties. Now, he summoned them, gave his instructions one by one, and approved a spiritual boat to set sail for the Eastern Sea under the guise of a return voyage. He then dispatched Miaoshui by a different route, just in case anything went awry.

Just as he finished his arrangements and was mentally reviewing them for any oversights, he saw a figure hurrying toward him. Dressed in red with a face like jade, he was oddly holding a boat pole. It was his uncle, Li Zhouming!

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

"Uncle… please, there's no need for that!"

Li Jiangqian was surprised to see Li Zhouming offer such a formal bow and quickly rose to his feet. But the man simply leaned in and spoke in a low voice.

"I have something to report to the Daoist Master. The morning light was splendid today, so I rented a pair of boats to go out on the lake…"

Li Zhouming was a man of many eccentricities. He loved boating on the lake but refused to own a vessel himself, preferring to rent one whenever the mood struck. His open-handedness ensured the local boatmen waited for him day after day. Before Li Jiangqian could ask further, his uncle adopted a rare, serious expression.

"I was just resting my boat on the western bank when I heard people talking in the sky above. They said they were coming to see the two Daoist Masters on the lake to deliver a cultivation method. They passed in a flash. I dared not delay and came here at once."

Li Jiangqian didn't have to think twice. He gave a subtle nod, his expression unchanging.

"I understand. Uncle, there is no need to speak of this to anyone."

"I understand. Some things are best left unsaid."

Li Zhouming nodded, picked up his boat pole, and departed as quickly as he had come. Li Jiangqian secretly shook his head.

‘Truly not a moment of peace!’

Who else could these so-called Daoist Masters be? It had to be someone from the Golden Feather Sect.

This was no benevolent immortal sect; they were renowned for their cunning. The visitor was clearly being discreet, taking into account that the Li family was still sheltering Li Que'wan. Any open association with the Golden Oneness could be noticed by those with ill intentions, so they wouldn't even show their faces to his subordinates.

The consideration was thoughtful, but the matter of the 'Whole Pill' was extremely sensitive. The visitors would surely demand to see his sister. Li Jiangqian sensed trouble ahead. With a sigh, he pressed the jade talisman at his waist to summon Li Que'wan while simultaneously igniting a flame beneath his feet and stepping into the Great Void.

Outside the mountain, within the Great Void, two figures were indeed waiting.

A woman in golden robes stood at the forefront. She was beautiful, with fair skin and eyes that danced with amusement. Her gaze fell upon Li Jiangqian.

"Daoist friend Changli, it has been too long!"

The woman was none other than Zhang Duanyan.

She had been to the Li estate once before. Years ago, when the Bright Yang affair was coming to a head in Jianghuai, Mount Luoxia had issued a decree to the Golden Oneness, and she had been the one to deliver it. Decades had passed in the blink of an eye, and now they met again as fellow Daoist Masters.

"This is a Daoist Master of my family," she said with a smile, gesturing to the person behind her. "He has also entered the grotto-heaven. You should be acquainted."

The man who stepped forward looked remarkably young. He wore a blue robe and returned Li Jiangqian's gaze with a respectful bow.

"I am Su Yan, Daoist name Huaiping. It is an honor to meet you, daoist friend."

"So, it is Daoist Master Su."

Li Jiangqian had recognized him at once but feigned a look of pleasant surprise.

"Your great exploits left Guan Gongxiao utterly helpless and flustered. If he saw you now, he would have no choice but to bow in respect."

Su Yan bowed again.

"The Family Head is too kind. It was merely a matter of fortune not being on his side."

The last time Zhang Duanyan had visited, for Li Jiangqian to take the host's seat would have been arrogant, but to refuse it would have been self-demeaning. He had been forced to receive her in the courtyard. Things were different now. The three of them descended into the mountain, and he grandly took the main seat.

"Please."

Zhang Duanyan sat and they exchanged pleasantries, mostly concerning the state of Li Zhouwei's injuries. Li Jiangqian repeated the same vague reassurances he had given Xuanyi, claiming Li Ximing was in the middle of refining a pill. The Daoist Master didn't seem convinced. She sighed, her eyes sweeping the room.

"I wonder… where might your esteemed sister be?"

‘Just as I thought!’

Li Jiangqian's heart sank. Before he could reply, Zhang Duanyan raised her head, her gaze fixed on a woman descending from the other side of the hall. She studied her face, trying to gauge her divine ability.

Zhang Duanyan cultivated the 'Golden Aperture Heart', an art with its own subtleties. A glance or two was usually enough to get a feel for an ordinary person's cultivation. But the divine ability of the woman before her was indistinct and veiled. The answer was clear.

‘Awaiting the Supreme Divine. This must be Li Que'wan!’

She rose to her feet with a smile.

"I have long heard of your renown. Seeing you today, you truly are a peerless talent!"

Li Que'wan had only just put away her Spiritual Treasure and begun to nurture it with her divine ability when her brother had summoned her. She had used a Spirit Probe to observe the visitors from afar, and her heart was filled with a quiet apprehension. She curtsied gracefully.

"Senior is too kind. This junior has no reputation to speak of, certainly nothing compared to the splendor of the Golden Oneness. I have, however, heard the names of all the seniors here with great respect."

Zhang Duanyan smiled.

"One can never be certain of such things. In a few hundred years, who knows whose reputation will be on the lips of others."

She took a step forward, her expression turning serious.

"Word of your clan's genius reached my grotto-heaven long ago. The elders and disciples of every lineage were overjoyed, seeing you as a star of tomorrow, destined to support our own elders… We meant to visit you sooner, but a matter arose within the sect that caused a long delay."

Li Que'wan lowered her eyes.

"How could this junior dare compare myself to Daoist Master Qiushui? My family's King Wei has but one great hope for me… that after the Whole Pill is returned to its rightful place, I can cultivate a few more divine abilities to protect the clan. When that time comes… this junior will have to visit the Golden Oneness's mountain gate to pay my respects again."

Hearing this, Zhang Duanyan understood. She waved her hand dismissively.

"But that is a matter for a later time."

The statement was heavy with meaning. At the side, Li Jiangqian took a slow sip of his tea. Zhang Duanyan continued,

"Since you have achieved 'Awaiting the Supreme Divine,' then you must know that the root of our elder's Mercury Transformation art lies within this very same divine ability. To seek the Dao, she could not truly assimilate the Divine Corpse. Instead, she chose mercury transformation, allowing her to benefit from the Divine Corpse's longevity and gather the necessary divine abilities to achieve her goal. To do this… my family had to collect all the Whole Pills in the world. In doing so, we delayed your cultivation, Que'wan. For that, we have done you a great injustice!"

"That was a matter of our respective capabilities. How could there be any talk of injustice?"

Zhang Duanyan stood to bow, but the two Li siblings would never allow her to formally apologize. They rushed to support her, speaking a few sincere words. Zhang Duanyan’s expression remained serious.

"These are not empty words. I truly intend to offer compensation. You cultivate the Golden Book of Divine Attendance, correct? As it happens, our Daoist Tradition possesses all four of the Golden Books related to the Whole Pill. They are secrets we do not normally share, but if you have need of them, Que'wan, you are welcome to come to our mountain and exchange for them!"

Li Que'wan was taken aback.

"Do you mean… the Golden Book of the Fourteen Prefaces?" she asked tentatively.

Zhang Duanyan beamed.

"The very same!"

Li Jiangqian sighed. "I had heard it was lost to time. I never imagined your esteemed tradition alone possessed four volumes!"

The direct descendant of the Golden Core lineage smiled and shook her head. 

"Not four volumes of the whole text. We possess the four volumes that pertain to the Whole Pill!"

Her words silenced the hall. Zhang Duanyan continued gravely,

"Within the Golden Book of the Fourteen Prefaces, there are two volumes for each branch of Prime Virtue, and four for the Whole Pill. This was the Daoist Tradition inherited from Su Jing. He upheld the Whole Pill Prime Virtue Theory, instructing his disciples to choose three paths from the four Whole Pill volumes, and then to select a school and two paths from the Prime Virtue volumes to match, creating a perfect set of five arts."

Li Jiangqian’s expression grew intent.

"Three Whole Pill paths and two Prime Virtue paths? How could anyone succeed in cultivating such a thing!"

"They could!" Zhang Duanyan stated firmly. "Not only could they, but he truly managed to nurture several True Monarchs with this method!"

"Several?"

That number was anything but ordinary. It meant the Daoist Tradition behind the Golden Book of the Fourteen Prefaces was exceptional. Even in the Middle Ages, a tradition with three or four True Monarchs would have been hailed as a Great Dao.

Zhang Duanyan nodded with a slight smile.

"It is called 'Three Alike, Two Different,' and it is a path for seeking the Intercalary."

"I once had the honor of serving Daoist Master Qiushui, and she spoke of Su Jing. This master was a legendary figure. Though the Purple Gold Dao had been spreading in secret before his time, it was he who brought it into the open, inspiring all the orthodox paths to cultivate it. This led to the great wave of cultivation in ancient times. And 'Three Alike, Two Different' was the very first method for seeking the Intercalary position within that tradition!"

Zhang Duanyan clearly intended to impart this knowledge, and the other three on the mountain, all ambitious cultivators, listened with rapt attention. As she spoke, she observed them carefully.

"Initially, this method was limited to those of Prime Virtue. Later, cultivators from all over flocked to try it, and many from outside the Prime Virtue lineage attempted to achieve the Dao through 'Three Alike, Two Different'. But they either stalled at four divine abilities or simply perished while cultivating the fifth. After several Great Daoist Masters fell in succession, the Purple and Gold cultivators slowly came to a realization."

"The method of 'Three Alike, Two Different' was based on the personal guidance of Su Jing himself. The specifics were exacting, from the cultivation techniques and divine abilities down to the very method of the Quest for Gold. They were all tailor-made. For a lesser cultivator without that backing, their one and only chance for trial and error was just that—one. This is what led to the later 'Four Alike, One Different' Intercalary Art, which is the method commonly used in the world today!"

She sighed.

"If seeking the Intercalary Art with 'Three Alike, Two Different' is like finding a needle in the ocean, then 'Four Alike, One Different' is at least like catching a fish in a lake. Though failure still means death, one can at least refine the Metallic Essence!"

Li Que'wan nodded in understanding. Li Jiangqian narrowed his eyes slightly, holding his teacup in silence. Zhang Duanyan's gaze flickered.

"There is a small rumor about this," she said with a smile. "True Monarch Su Jing recruited cultivators from across the land, seeking those of Prime Virtue. It was not without purpose. He… was actually looking for someone."

"Looking for someone?"

This time, it wasn't just Li Que'wan who raised an eyebrow; even Su Yan shot her a look of faint surprise. The woman spoke with a touch of melancholy.

"I heard that before the True Monarch achieved the Dao, he had a Daoist companion. Her surname was Wang, her given name Yu. They were husband and wife, and they perfected their divine abilities one after the other. His companion attempted to verify the Dao first, but she failed and perished. He, in his grief, succeeded. He scoured the Underworld for her, but could not find a single trace of her True Spirit. He refused to believe she was gone, choosing instead to believe she had been reincarnated early."

Zhang Duanyan sighed again.

"His Dragon Tiger Platform was built for his wife. The Golden Books were written because the couple feared their legacy would be lost if they perished. Before achieving the Dao, they gathered their friends, and together they compiled their knowledge. It was called the Fourteen Rolls then. After he achieved the Dao, he organized it, filling in the gaps, his words like intimate instructions to a loved one. That is why it is called the Golden Book of the Fourteen Prefaces. A pity… he searched until the day he himself fell while seeking the Dao, but he never found her."

A note of sadness entered her voice.

"In today's world, the three great shamans are gone, and the Underworld is in decline. Since she failed to achieve the Dao and reincarnation is now blocked, she has simply been lost to the dust of history."

A realization dawned in Li Que'wan’s heart.

‘No wonder… no wonder the Golden Book of Divine Attendance is written with such intimacy and gentleness! So that's the reason. No wonder this book contains such profound marvels—it was personally written by a True Monarch who had mastered the Whole Pill and unified his essence!’

As she finished speaking, Zhang Duanyan produced a wooden box from her sleeve.

"My master has read the words Daoist Master Zhaojing wrote in the golden scroll. Since your noble clan wishes to make an exchange, we certainly won't make an empty promise. This is one of the Golden Books!"

"Oh?"

Though Li Jiangqian had been observing her attitude and was almost certain the Golden Oneness had come with friendly intentions, he hadn't expected them to be so generous. In the current age, cultivation methods of the top three grades were nowhere to be found. The best one could hope for in the mortal world was a sixth-grade technique. And this was a Golden Core inheritance, written by a True Monarch himself!

Li Que'wan's eyes shone with a brilliant light as she watched the box being pushed toward her.

"This is…"

"Consider it fate," Zhang Duanyan said quietly, not giving her a chance to speak. "The Golden Book within is called the White Nurturing Golden Book. Before it was revised by True Monarch Su Jing, it was known as the White Nurturing Roll. It was compiled by True Monarch Su Jing, his wife, and a friend. This friend… later achieved the Dao and ascended to a new station…"

"His venerable title is the Golden Oneness Taiyuan Highest Azure True Monarch."

Silence fell upon the mountain. The light in Li Jiangqian's eyes dimmed, but his mind was flooded with clarity.

‘No wonder they know so much. True Monarch Taiyuan was Su Jing's friend… no wonder… of course. What distinction between Daoist Traditions could there even be? It wouldn't be surprising if the Zhang family possessed the entire Golden Book of the Fourteen Prefaces!’

‘The evergreen tree of Metal Virtue… a well-earned name indeed!’

Li Que'wan also rose and spoke with deep respect.

"So this is a legacy of the True Monarch. This junior is overwhelmed!"

Zhang Duanyan laughed.

"What is there to be overwhelmed about? By accepting the White Nurturing Golden Book, you are paying respects to our mountain gate!"

Li Que'wan nodded solemnly.

"Our family will never forget the guidance of the Immortal Dao. We are deeply moved. For something so profound, I must ask… what do you require in exchange?"

A glint appeared in Zhang Duanyan's eyes.

"Given the relationship between our two families, there is no need to haggle. Although Daoist Master Zhaojing spoke of an exchange, we would not ask your clan to make a great sacrifice… I am only slightly hesitant, as I fear it may be something your clan is reluctant to part with."

Li Jiangqian was surprised that the great and prosperous Golden Oneness would have need of something his family possessed. He frowned inwardly as the woman before him continued.

"Years ago, an elder of my family was traveling overseas and visited a grotto-heaven. There, he found an ancient spiritual item. He believed it would be of great use to Martial Uncle Tianque and was overjoyed, but he unexpectedly encountered Daoist Master Dantai. He was defeated by a narrow margin and lost the spiritual item… Later, I heard by chance that this very item is in the possession of your clan…"

Li Que'wan was stunned.

"The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire?!"

"Precisely!"

The words struck home, and Li Que'wan was truly troubled. Zhang Duanyan was right; for the Li family, this was not a devastating loss. But it was an important spiritual flame for Li Ximing's alchemy, and it was the very first wisp of spiritual fire he had ever obtained. It held a certain sentimental value.

She was torn, but another thought quickly surfaced.

‘Daoist Master Tianque… could he possibly be lacking a mere wisp of True Fire? But since Zhang Duanyan has asked for it by name, it must be of extraordinary importance to them. How could we possibly refuse?’

The two Li siblings exchanged a glance. Li Jiangqian made his decision in an instant. He sighed, almost without hesitation.

"That is most unfortunate timing. My father's injuries are severe, and my great-grand uncle is dedicating all his effort to refining a pill for his recovery. Now that the furnace has been lit, I fear it cannot be interrupted midway… I wonder, does your esteemed sect require this item with great urgency?"

The excuse was perfect. It left Zhang Duanyan momentarily speechless. She paused, then said hesitantly,

"Urgent… not exactly…"

Li Que'wan immediately seized the opening.

"Senior, please wait a moment. I will go to the cave dwelling at once and ask my elder!"

The Golden Oneness were not to be trifled with. Without a clear answer, Zhang Duanyan would never agree. The path had been laid, and she took it. Li Que'wan excused herself from the hall, slipped into the grand formation of the Purple Mansion Realm, and entered the grotto-heaven, her mind filled with doubt. She saw the sun and moon shining in tandem, spiritual qi erupting like fountains.

This land of heaven and earth was as tranquil as ever. When Li Que'wan appeared, she saw her elder seated at a table, surrounded by towering stacks of jade slips, a look of intense concentration on his face.

Li Ximing's skill in alchemy was sublime, but more importantly, he possessed absolute mastery over fire. In the current age, with several great alchemists having passed away or departed for distant lands, Li Que'wan judged that, setting aside the immortal sects, her great-grand uncle was likely the foremost alchemist in all of Jiangnan. But the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth and the Supreme Yin Pill were no ordinary challenges. It was no wonder he was so beleaguered.

Li Que'wan wasted no time and explained Zhang Duanyan's proposal. Daoist Master Zhaojing’s brow furrowed, and his gaze shifted to the red-and-white flame gently warming the pill furnace nearby.

‘The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire…’

The flame had been with him for many years and had served him well on the path of alchemy. It was an exceptionally versatile spiritual fire. He was loath to part with it, but he let out a soft sigh.

"In the end, our family has gained the greater advantage. How could we refuse?"

Li Que'wan frowned as well.

"But… this junior does not understand. Why would a great Daoist Tradition like the Golden Oneness be so insistent on having the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire?"

But Li Ximing recalled something.

"I did indeed obtain this fire from Daoist Master Dantai," he said with regret. "He warned me at the time that this fire is an anomaly among True Fires. Its corresponding Auxiliary Position for True Fire still resonates, meaning it retains qualities from a far more ancient era…"

"I see!"

Li Que'wan considered this for a moment and her eyes lit up.

"Could it be… that Daoist Master Tianque has already passed the stage of the Purple Mystery and is preparing to seek the Dao!"

"It is more than likely!"

Li Ximing shook his head wistfully. Li Que'wan felt a pang of guilt.

"I am the one who has troubled the family… When I returned from the Nine Mounds, the old Daoist Master had me bring back your Mountain-Levelling Li Fire, great-grand uncle. I will take this chance to transform it into a flame suitable for alchemy, to aid you in your refinement."

Li Ximing shook his head.

"This is not entirely your doing. Since they want the fire, they would have found another reason to ask for it, even without the Golden Book. As long as it benefits the family, that is what matters. I have only one concern—can we delay this for three to five years, to allow me to finish this pill?"

Li Que'wan nodded in understanding.

"That shouldn't be difficult. I am certainly in no rush to use the book, and they only require a promise. My brother has already provided an excuse; we just need to follow his lead."

Since she was already in the grotto-heaven, she didn't want to make the trip for nothing.

"There is a reply from Situ Huo regarding your matter, great-grand uncle. He has offered a Pristine Water item, the Spring Morning Drizzle."

Li Ximing smiled.

"The Secret Art of Shouyi's Attainment looks impressive, but as we have both seen, its foundation is missing the other half of the diagram… You were born late, so you wouldn't know. The Golden Tang Gate is a chaotic place. It was once a point of contention between the Golden Oneness and the Azure Pond Sect, a place where even those of the Purple Mansion Realm met grim fates. But he is a greedy and ruthless man; he hasn't cared for the Golden Tang Gate in years. He acts not for his family's legacy, but for his own profit…"

"The old fox is cunning. This Spring Morning Drizzle is a respectable offer. Its greatest advantage is its rarity, and it will be of some use for King Wei's pill. We are all of the Purple Mansion Realm and will have to work together in the future. It is best not to antagonize him too much, lest he make trouble for us later."

Having received his approval, Li Que'wan added, "According to my Dao lineage's texts, this item is condensed using Spring Suspended Qi. It occurred to me that our family also possesses a method for collecting this ancient qi. I wonder where it came from… might it be possible to replicate it?"

Li Ximing thought for a moment.

"Years ago, I visited the Xuanmiao Temple and happened upon a direct descendant of the old Daoist Master Qi collecting spring rain. I asked him about it, and he tried to rope our family into helping him. I did not know the full story at the time, so I paid him no mind…"

He chuckled.

"It seems Situ Huo has connections to Sumian. Who knows what other treasures he has? Perhaps we can trade for a few more things from him."

Li Que'wan committed this to memory. She then took her leave of the grotto-heaven, shedding the ambient spiritual qi as she floated back out. Seeing the celestial maiden from the Golden Oneness, she put on a troubled expression.

"The timing is truly unfortunate. My great-grand uncle's refinement is only half-complete… How about this? If you could wait three to five years, once this pill is finished, this junior will immediately retrieve the fire and personally deliver it to your mountain gate as a sign of respect!"

Zhang Duanyan had more or less expected this. She simply stated, "In that case, on this day five years from now, I will await you at the Golden Oneness, daoist friend."

With that, she rose to leave. The two Daoist Masters escorted them through the Great Void, all the way back to the lake's edge. As they parted, Zhang Duanyan gestured toward Su Yan and sighed with deep meaning.

"If the opportunity arises in the future, I hope you two will offer him your guidance!"

…

The Heavenly Yuwu wind howled, and the four realms trembled.

"What is spoken today leaves my mouth and enters your ear. No third person must ever know!"

The cave dwelling was pitch black. Moonlight flowed across the floor like water. High above, a mirror emitted a ghostly light in the darkness. The young Daoist Master kept his head bowed, silent.

On the couch, his master’s spiritual qi was draining away like a river, but the young man was in a daze. His eyes were ancient with sorrow, his voice a faint tremor.

"Master… Lord Li… it was you who brought him to ruin."

The master on the couch, shrouded in darkness, was silent for a moment before his breath came in ragged gasps.

"Shaoshang… I am no genius. I rose from nothing. I lack your compassionate heart… but Li Yuanwei… Li Yuanwei had to die. Who could have allowed him to ascend to the station of Lesser Yin? Who would have dared!"

His voice grew hoarse, but it was laced with an unrepentant stubbornness.

"Since he was doomed to die… since he was doomed, why not let him inquire into the Supreme Yin? Was it not a good thing to forge a new path? Besides, the white talisman was obtained by us together. He simply failed. You blame me for that, but what if he had succeeded?"

The Daoist Master kneeling on the floor looked up, his eyes filled with a cold grief.

"Master," he whispered, "these thoughts of yours… save them for fooling me alone…"

The man on the sickbed groaned again. His heart, once so full of schemes, had been crushed by worry, leaving no room for questions. Now, doubt spilled from his lips, but he could not bear to speak it aloud. As he fell silent, his master continued to groan.

‘You must verify the Dao, you must verify the Dao!’

‘I have already verified the Dao, Master.’

His limbs were cold to the point of phantom pain. He lowered his eyes, realizing his tears were as cold as frost. His spine felt as if it would snap. The terrifying emptiness of having the Dao-seed cast down from his Shengyang Acupoint still clung to him, but heavier still was the despair.

‘Forsaken by the Supreme Yin.’

This was their sin, his and his master's. Everything Li Yuanwei had experienced, he, Xi Shaoshang, was now forced to endure. He fought against the pain, a pain like his heart was being carved from his chest, his trembling lips still murmuring:

‘But… but Chunyi is innocent.’

It was a plea for mercy to the cultivators of the Underworld, but it was also a prayer to the unseen Supreme Yin. He was losing all feeling, on the verge of fainting, his heart filled with a sorrow so profound he felt he might vomit blood.

‘How long has it been?’

Since his master, Yanyi, had ventured out with Hengzhu's Yanque, only for them both to fall, Xi Shaoshang had not known such world-shattering pain. Before, the pain of those unspoken histories had been a quiet, constant ache, but it had never robbed him of all hope.

An unknown amount of time passed in a state between waking and sleep. Suddenly, the searing pain in his Shengyang Acupoint shocked him back to a sliver of awareness.

‘It must have been… some time.’

Yuanshang forced his heavy eyelids open. He could vaguely make out a dim sky, the color of which was an indistinct grey, a state of profound unity, as if the world were shrouded in gauze.

‘Perhaps I have reached the Underworld.’

He did not think it possible to retain even a shred of his soul after having been stripped of his divine abilities and Metallic Essence, but an intense pain compelled him to turn, to search for the emissaries and judges of the Underworld.

But there was no one.

Faint moonlight flowed around him. The ground was a jumble of jagged rocks. Beyond the oppressive darkness, there was only the sight of moon-white fragments of brick and tile lying in the ruins, lifeless and stagnant—just like him, Xi Shaoshang.

That single glance was like a cool, restorative elixir, dispelling the chill that had frozen his thoughts. He awoke as if from a nightmare. His limbs were still cold and numb, but his mind was reviving at a startling pace.

‘Where… where is this place?’

In that instant, he was no longer the despairing Xi Shaoshang, but Daoist Master Yuanshang, a cultivator of five hundred years. His gaze fell upon a half-shattered piece of moon-white tile, and a sense of familiarity washed over him.

‘The Taiqun Spirit-Mirror.’

He knew it all too well. He had been trapped within that small world for decades. He knew every hue, every pattern, every single inscription.

His hands began to tremble violently. His pupils, which had turned the color of the moon, dilated. His gaze traced the path the fragments had taken, moving slowly upward, past countless other white shards, until it reached a series of long, white steps, some broken, some whole.

Yuanshang's breathing grew ragged. He raised his head in disbelief, his heart pounding with a mixture of terror and hope. His eyes followed the moonlight as it climbed higher, revealing rows of jade pillars of varying heights. And behind them… window lattices, high eaves, dark sills, ornate beams…

It was a profound hall.

It was dilapidated and ancient, yet its corners still hinted at a former magnificence. The eaves held the lofty distance of the heavens and the bright moon, the pillars the divine majesty of an immortal court. Though scarred by wind and rain, it still radiated a clear light as it stood against the sky.

This was enough.

It was not the Underworld. It was not Dongmu. It was not the domain of any of the terrifying, manifest Daos of the current age. There were no celestial beings filling the sky, no endless display of colors. There was only a single, time-worn hall, with a few floating islands scattered across the horizon, as if everything had been torn asunder by a terrifying battle. And yet, it brought him more joy than any grand pavilion in the Profound Heavens.

Yuanshang's terrifying divine abilities were gone. His all-perceiving spiritual sense no longer surrounded him. Everything he was had been stripped from him in that nether hall. The simple feeling in his limbs was a miracle. Who could have done this? Who could have allowed a cultivator whose body and spirit were annihilated to retain both form and consciousness?

His breath came in short, sharp gasps. He stared, transfixed, as if he had drunk a flagon of scalding wine, and the cold seemed to recede from his limbs.

He was terrified that the hall would vanish in the next instant. He dared not look away. With great difficulty, he controlled his body, reaching down to move his legs. They were ice-cold to the touch, but he didn't care. He forced his disobedient legs around until he was kneeling before the hall.

Once properly kneeling, he looked at the jade plaques that had fallen in the ruins. There were two. One lay on the jade steps. It read:

‘Disciple of the Profound Repository… Hall of Immortals…’

The other lay before the threshold. It read:

‘…Supreme Yin Palace… an Attendant Awaiting Audience…’

The characters were faded, but he didn't need to read them clearly. An innate understanding filled him. When he saw the words ‘Supreme Yin,’ his eyes turned red, and tears began to stream down his face. His heart ached. He bowed his head to the ground three times, then looked up at the main plaque beneath the high eaves. In the darkness, two characters glowed with a faint light:

"Hall of Final Vastness."

Yuanshang raised his sleeve and wiped the tears from his face. He finally found the strength to stand. His divine abilities and dharma power were gone, but he staggered to the steps, laboriously lifted the couplet plaques, and hung them back on the jade pillars.

When he was done, what little strength he had recovered was spent. He moved back before the hall, his eyes welling with fresh tears, and bowed his head to the ground.

"I… I…" he sobbed, his voice hoarse.

"I have verified the Dao! Master!"
