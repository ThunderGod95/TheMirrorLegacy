# Chapter 1068: All Prepared

Nurturing the spirit and cultivating truth was a crucible that consumed the days and nights.

Radiant light surged within the pavilion. Li Ximing rubbed the bridge of his nose and stood, letting out a long breath. He felt a wave of dizziness and closed his eyes, resting for just a breath or two. Only then did the vertigo subside, and he felt a measure of relief.

On a meditation cushion to the side sat another man, one who looked identical to Li Ximing in every way. His robes fluttered slightly in the ambient Spiritual Qi. His features were even more refined and handsome, and the complete lack of expression lent him an air of divinity.

This was, of course, the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.

The body was no longer as stiff and lifeless as it had been in the beginning. Its skin looked warm and supple. The only difference between its face and Li Ximing's was that the alternate body's complexion was a fraction more ruddy—a distinction so subtle it was invisible to the naked eye.

Their attire, however, was slightly different. A jade pendant hung from the alternate body's waist, inscribed with three words:

'Li Gufeng.'

Li Ximing had made arrangements long ago for this creation. He had established a mountain-guardian position on his Gardenia Scenery Mountain, registered the name Li Gufeng, and had a family jade pendant and set of robes custom-made for him.

The entire purpose of a Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was to serve as an external incarnation, one capable of confounding heavenly secrets and forcing miscalculations. Normally, a person's identity could be discerned through Daoist arts. But now, with the robes draped over the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body and the identity pendant hung from its waist, Li Ximing activated the Light of the Six Harmonies.

This was the wondrous aspect of the World's Radiance. 'Li Gufeng' was now his subordinate, naturally suffused with radiant Heavenly Light and linked by divine ability. This drastically reduced the time and difficulty of nurturing it with his Life Divine Ability! The refinement process advanced by leaps and bounds.

Even though he had taken this shortcut, the all-out effort to nurture it had nearly exhausted his mind and spirit. Seeing the alternate body sitting with its eyes closed, as if deep in meditative cultivation, Li Ximing felt his heart skip a beat.

'It's just too realistic... No one will be able to tell the difference, even with a divine ability.'

At this moment, the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was finally complete.

Li Ximing was in a hurry to become a lowly cultivator, and this creation's primary function was refined for that very purpose. As long as he cut off a piece of his finger before a great battle, used an art to have 'Li Gufeng' consume it, and then linked them with his Life Divine Ability, they would share a life-mandate connection. This technique was called Sealing the Life-Mandate.

After Sealing the Life-Mandate, for a short period, twenty to forty percent of most injuries he sustained would be transferred to the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body. When facing curses, malevolent talismans, or wicked arts that interfered with the spiritual sense—such as Changxiao's treasured vase technique—it could transfer as much as sixty percent!

'In other words... if I suffer a fatal blow on the lake... it will only mean the destruction of this Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body, giving me a chance to escape...'

'If I could master that Vast Profound Art for elevating Pure Qi, I might even be able to abandon my original body entirely and use the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body to flee...'

And every time he performed Sealing the Life-Mandate, whether the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was ultimately used or not, the bond between it and his main body would deepen. After hundreds or thousands of uses, supplemented by his Dao-Profundity, he might even be able to share damage without needing the ritual seal at all.

The uses for such a marvelous art didn't end there. Ancient Daoists could use these alternate bodies for all manner of deceptive ploys. While Li Ximing lacked that level of skill, he had gleaned a few insights.

'The scroll mentioned that during Sealing the Life-Mandate, one can place a spiritual item in its mouth—anything that doesn't conflict, though jade is best. This allows the consumption of the spiritual item to reduce the damage the alternate body takes.'

This was a wonderful surprise for Li Ximing!

He silently went to his cabinet and retrieved a portion of Supreme Yin Moon Radiance.

The Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body would inevitably be revealed one day, so he hadn't dared use Supreme Yin Moon Radiance in its actual refinement. But as a consumable, it was perfect... He was short on many things, but he had plenty of this!

He brought two fingers to his lips, drew the moon-white treasure from its vial, and condensed it into a pill the size of a fingertip. He then closed his eyes slightly. On the cushion, the meditating 'Li Gufeng' abruptly opened its eyes.

Its sockets were empty, containing nothing, yet an unseen presence seemed to be observing the surroundings. It was quite unnerving. The body slowly parted its lips, revealing teeth as white as jade, and accepted the pill into its mouth. Its eyelids immediately drooped shut, resuming the appearance of deep meditation.

Li Ximing opened his eyes, thoroughly pleased.

"This way, it can be drawn upon at any time."

He raised his hand slightly. 'Li Gufeng' leaped up, and with a shimmer, transformed into a palm-sized wooden figurine that drifted gently into his sleeve.

He shook his sleeve, pinched his fingers to make a calculation, and realized six months had passed. The jade pendant representing Yang Ruiyi was flickering erratically. Clearly, the great event was imminent.

He descended from his elevated chamber, appearing on the mountainside. As expected, he was informed that Sima Yuanli had been waiting on the island for some time, so he invited him in.

Unlike the confident Li Ximing, this man appeared anxious and fraught with worry. He stopped hurriedly before the desk and bowed.

"Greetings, Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing returned the gesture, only to notice an elegant beauty following behind him. She wore plain white robes and held a casket. Wisps of cold clouds floated about her, circling like silver sparrows. It was Fairy Qiuhu, Ning Wan.

Yang Ruiyi hadn't ordered Ning Wan to come to the island to set up defenses. Li Ximing paused for a moment, then offered a greeting. Ning Wan smiled and nodded at him, setting down the jade casket she held.

"Greetings, Zhaojing," she said softly. "Congratulations on achieving your divine ability. I've brought something for you."

She lifted the lid, revealing a radiant red jade pearl inside. It was crystalline and translucent, covered by only a thin layer of crystal. Trapped within was a small, exquisite beast, its body curled and back arched, filling the pearl completely.

"This is a Prosperous Dragon Pearl. It's a special protective talisman from the cultivators of Great Liang. Inside is an Unfettered Xuan-Ox. It is extremely potent."

Ning Wan used a divine ability to reseal the box, her expression grave.

"The old Daoist Master Diyan of Mount Qusi asked me to deliver it... He heard this junior's concerns, about the great battle on the lake and how King Wei has not emerged from seclusion... He specifically had me bring this as a token of his support."

The woman seemed to hesitant, pausing before adding,

"This item is precious, one of the old Daoist Master's most treasured possessions. At a critical moment, it can save your life."

Li Ximing had heard his name before and knew Mount Qusi was interested in currying favor. But this gesture of concern was so substantial that he felt he couldn't possibly accept it. He was moved, and asked,

"Please thank the old gentleman for me... but how can I accept such a valuable treasure?"

Ning Wan shook her head.

"The old Daoist Master asked me to relay a message to you... He said... Thank you, Zhaojing, for protecting Nanwu from his enemies and preventing the Guo family from getting involved..."

Li Ximing froze, frowning.

"The matter in the Eastern Sea?"

Ning Wan seemed to sense the sensitivity of the topic and quietly cut it short.

"That is something I do not know, nor should I."

Li Ximing immediately fell silent, thinking to himself,

'I understand. The old Daoist Master is arranging his affairs, but he doesn't want to stir up trouble, so he's been dragging it out. I genuinely need this item right now. I'll have to lay my cards on the table and speak with him after this is over.'

Ning Wan, however, showed no change in expression. First Suiguan, then Emperor Song—this woman seemed accustomed to surviving in the cracks between great powers. She gave a curtsey and quickly excused herself.

Sima Yuanli, meanwhile, was full of envy.

"Ximing, you truly have good fortune!"

Li Ximing gave a noncommittal response. After his exclamation, Sima Yuanli's expression turned serious.

"I have received orders from the Great General. In three days, the assembled cultivators will attack the Zhao. All cultivators have been given their orders, and they have even requested a Daoist Master from Overlook Peak to take action!"

"Vast Cicada hails from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and has always coveted the south. Once the battle begins, he certainly won't reinforce Profound Governance. Instead, he'll lead his men south. You and I just need to lie in wait for him."

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully, but Sima Yuanli was lost in his own worries.

'Could this be even more serious than I imagined? Even Li Ximing has to seek external help like this, so what about me? I might very well be killed.'

He solemnly set down his cup, studied the other man's expression, and said,

"Zhaojing... on this lake, you and I prosper together and fall together. Since you now have such a powerful protective talisman, why not entrust the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella to me in advance? Once the fighting starts, I will stake my life on protecting the lake!"

With Sima Yuanli having put it so bluntly, Li Ximing had little room to maneuver. He pondered for a long moment before finally nodding slowly with a sigh.

"Then I shall rely on you, Daoist Friend."

He retrieved the Spiritual Artifact from his sleeve and, under Sima Yuanli's eager gaze, transferred ownership to him. The green-robed man nodded, immediately turning the spiritual umbrella over and over to study it.

Li Ximing rose silently and gazed toward the north.

'Yang Ruiyi gave me five years. How exactly did he calculate that timeframe? This battle will be different. Times have changed. Even if he is a member of the Yang family, I doubt he can afford to return with nothing to show for it.'

...

Baijiang Creek.

In just a few short years, the area had become covered in temples. Inside a magnificent, golden-tiled hall, radiant light flowed like clear water. Rows of monks knelt below a high seat, upon which sat a monk with a fair, clean-shaven face and a touch of gold lacquer at his brow. He was as serene as a statue.

Perched on a roof beam, however, sat a young man. His features were otherworldly, but his eyes shone with a brilliant divine light as he gazed into the distance. Countless complex scenes reflected in his pupils, fleeting past like flowing water.

After an unknown amount of time, the monk on the main seat finally spoke, his voice melodious.

"Jiexing, what do you see?"

The young man lowered his gaze, retracting his divine ability. He leaped down, offered a deep bow, and said,

"Cousin, I didn't see anyone coming or going. There was only a Lesser Yang cultivator who passed through the Great Void. He shouldn't be involved in this."

The expression of the monk he called 'cousin' flickered.

"You're exactly as you were when we were children. I have entered the Buddhist Path. I am Vast Cicada now, not Li Jieyi. It is improper to call me cousin."

Tao Jiexing blinked his shining eyes and quickly apologized.

"I've been cultivating with my master in the mountains. I haven't visited the mortal realm often. Please don't be offended, cousin..."

Vast Cicada stared, then sighed and dropped the subject.

"Truly incredible. Your divine ability is concentrated entirely in your eyes; no wonder people call it an Eye Divine Ability. You have only just cultivated it, yet it's already this powerful. If Old Master Tao were to use it himself, I cannot imagine how formidable it would be."

"The person you saw must have been Guo Nanwu. He should be leaving as well... What else did you see?"

Tao Jiexing spoke bluntly.

"The distant lands seem to be blocked by something; I can't see clearly. But the people on the riverbank are living well, much more comfortably than the people in the north. Master says 'an army must have a just cause, to relieve the people's suffering and punish the wicked.' This war should not be fought."

The young man truly seemed to be a mountain recluse, his words direct and his expression earnest. Vast Cicada's face tightened as he listened.

"Whether it should be fought is not for us to decide," he said in a low voice. "You just follow me."

Tao Jiexing could only reply, "Yes!"

The monk sat on his high seat, lost in thought. His own Li clan was just across the river, yet his expression held no joy, only a heavy inscrutability. He looked at Tao Jiexing.

"Jiexing... tell me... are there truly people in this world who can know the future and calculate heavenly secrets?"

Tao Jiexing was taken aback.

"What's so difficult about that? I know a bit about calculation arts. I can try a divination, it's no trouble."

Vast Cicada gave him a flat look.

"Calculate the fate of this river. Calculate the outcome of this war between north and south."

"Absolutely impossible!"

Tao Jiexing flicked his sleeve, offering no polite mitigation.

"Cousin, you cultivate the Buddhist path now, not calculation arts; you focus on refining artifacts. You don't understand this Dao. But this is something one shouldn't even consider. This place is overflowing with Purple Mansion Realm experts and Mahas. Forget calculation—even the ambient qi is in constant, violent flux. Furthermore, there are quite a few Purple Mansion Realm masters who have achieved the Life Divine Ability. In divination, such people register as voids... Trying to calculate the changes here is like asking an illiterate child to read the Daoist Classics. Even if you got a result, you couldn't trust it."

The more Vast Cicada listened, the deeper his frown became.

"Is that true? Not even if Duanmu Kui came?"

Tao Jiexing didn't hesitate.

"Cousin, you're overthinking it. This has nothing to do with Dao-Profundity. 'The cleverest housewife can't cook without rice.' Even if Lord Xue himself came, he couldn't do it! To say nothing of the Martial Cultivation Star hanging overhead, with all the various Fruition Attainments shifting and intersecting. Begging your pardon, but even those great figures would have trouble getting a clear reading!"

Vast Cicada said no more, his brow furrowed in thought.

'Strange... From what I can tell of Qi Lanyan's intentions, he clearly knew a great battle was coming. Otherwise, he wouldn't have mobilized so frequently, and he wouldn't have sent Tao Jiexing down... He was able to promise Old Master Tao that he would only borrow him for two months. How did he know such a specific timeframe?'

Yang Ruiyi hadn't just arrived at the river; he'd been here for over a year. The timing was impossible to predict. Vast Cicada was silent for a long time, rising to pace as suspicion grew in his heart.

'Has the Profound Governance Pavilion become too powerful? The great figures are all distracted by the Bright Yang affair, but have they considered that Profound Governance's influence is ten times stronger than it was? It's become the very pivot of the Great Zhao. The mortal world they promised us... is it still ours to take?'

But just then, a Merciful One tore through the Great Void and descended, kneeling before him and speaking urgently:

"Reporting to the Maha! Yang Ruiyi is crossing the river! Liu Bai is his general, and those two Bright Yang scions are with him... His subordinates, Ning Wan, Wenqing, and the others, have already surrounded Shanji. The Profound Governance Pavilion orders... orders My Lord to proceed directly southeast and intercept Yang Ruiyi!"

'As I expected!'

Vast Cicada shot to his feet, his eyes flashing. He no longer cared about Profound Governance. Billowing purple flames instantly erupted around him. He grasped a long spear that appeared from thin air and barked,

"Let's go!"

In an instant, the Great Void thundered open, and an enormous golden avatar materialized. Tao Jiexing hurried forward, watching his monk cousin step into the void. He froze, confused.

"Cousin, where are you going...?"

Vast Cicada's gaze was dark, but laced with a fervent heat.

"South! To attack Wei!"

The young man was baffled, but the Merciful One beside him looked deeply uneasy.

"My Lord... I fear Profound Governance will hold you accountable..."

"Accountable?"

Vast Cicada forced a cold laugh from his throat, turning his head to snarl,

"You think that Qi Lanyan doesn't know I'll go south? You think he doesn't _want_ me to go south? That bastard transferred my subordinates away long ago and stationed me right here, just a river's breadth away. He's setting me up to take the fall!"

"Whether he gave the order or not, I would have gone south for him anyway. So why not issue a different order, telling me to block Yang Ruiyi? That way, if something goes wrong, whatever scheme Yang Ruiyi pulls... if it blows up into a disaster, he can pin every last bit of it on me!"
