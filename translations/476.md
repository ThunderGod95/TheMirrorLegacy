# Chapter 696: One Palm

In the pitch-black depths of the ocean, two streaks of light flashed by. The one in the lead was dazzling and vibrant, resembling a long, flowing ribbon cutting through the dark waters.

The one trailing behind appeared far more ordinary, like a massive air bubble pushing aside the seawater as it advanced. Yet, it was much faster than the first as it was steadily closing the gap.

Li Xizhi sped forward, his light-trail shifted off course and left behind a stunning, multicolored ribbon. His escape technique, Dawn Imperial Movement, was a Grade Four spell of exceptional speed.

His cultivation of Universal Dawn Mist was already specialized in speed. But only with multiple reinforcements did he barely manage to maintain some distance from Dongfang Heyun, preventing immediate capture.

But as Li Xizhi’s course deviated, he unwittingly gave Dongfang Heyun the perfect opening to close the gap. The young pursuer lifted his gaze and spotted the colorful glow ahead.

Though he did not understand why Li Xizhi had changed course, Dongfang Heyun would not let the opportunity slip. He pinched a deep blue pearl between his fingers and flicked it toward Li Xizhi’s back.

Up ahead, Li Xizhi pulled out a talisman and braced himself. His severed arm had already reattached. Although it was slightly stiff, it was still functional. The sight made Dongfang Heyun raise his brows in surprise, He neutralized my mana so quickly?!

Dongfang Heyun’s palm-blade attack had not been a simple cut, it was imbued with mana designed to seep into the wound. It would disrupt Li Xizhi’s own mana circulation and prevent his injury from healing.

Had it not been for the golden radiance hidden within Li Xizhi’s feathered robe, his arm would have been utterly obliterated, leaving him no chance to reattach it. Yet now, somehow, it was functioning once more.

Did he take some kind of treasured panacea? thought Dongfang Heyun.

Li Xizhi focused solely on his talisman defense, paying no heed to the golden light of his robe. The reason his arm had reattached so swiftly was, of course, due to his talisman qi.

Having received the Rainbow Pierce Skyway talisman, he could dissolve external spell arts. As its colorful light circulated, the pale blue mana lingering in his wound rapidly dissipated. This allowed his flesh to knit back together, emitting brilliant hues of dawn.

As he gradually regained control of his arm, Dongfang Heyun’s spell advanced silently. It struck the talismans and erupted into a series of thunderous blasts which sent shockwaves rippling through the water. Li Xizhi let out a muffled groan as his breath faltered. The Heavenly Glow beneath his feet dimmed, it was slowing his escape.

Dongfang Heyun had already closed the distance in an instant, only to see Li Xizhi forming a seal once again.

The young pursuer watched with interest, as if expecting Li Xizhi to unveil a new technique. Yet, the seals he formed seemed oddly familiar, ones he had already used before.

In such a critical moment, Li Xizhi positioned his right hand above his left and extended a finger from each. He pressed them together and cast a duplication technique.

Is he courting death? thought Dongfang Heyun.

Dongfang Heyun remained calm and composed, showing neither hesitation nor doubt. No matter what Li Xizhi was attempting, he simply extended his palm toward the latter’s back.

Poof!

Li Xizhi coughed up blood as he had taken the full force of the palm strike head-on. A golden-blue imprint bloomed on the back of his feathered robe and an explosive surge of golden radiance burst forth, engulfing Dongfang Heyun’s vision.

This time, Dongfang Heyun was prepared. He pushed out forcefully, instantly shattering the golden light. But in that brief moment of pause, a thick mist of rainbow hues erupted from Li Xizhi’s body, swiftly spreading and dyeing the surrounding seawater in vibrant colors.

At the same time, seizing this fleeting moment, Li Xizhi's feet flared with radiance. His form dispersed like mist and left behind three dazzling trails of multicolored light.

Gold In Cloud!

In an instant, his well-honed duplicates leaped in separate directions. Everywhere, brilliant streaks of light wove through the mist, using the rainbow fog as cover while scattering in all directions.

Over two meters away, Li Xizhi’s silhouettes appeared in every direction, all executing identical movements. They all swept out a sleeve of Heavenly Glow that drifted like smoke and floating wisps. Then, each of them streaked away upon radiant trails.

Dongfang Heyun nodded slightly, a hint of appreciation flickering across his face as he thought, First, he took a direct palm strike to release a spell, using the golden light from his robe to blind my vision. Then, he masked his movements with rainbow mist, preventing me from discerning the real body and finally scattered in all directions...

In just a few seconds, despite Li Xizhi’s grave injuries, he had unleashed three different techniques in succession. He transformed into a dozen beams of radiant light shooting outward. Dongfang Heyun stood still, sweeping aside the rainbow mist with his sleeve, shaking his head slightly.

"What a pity," muttered Dongfang Heyun.

Li Xizhi had calculated everything to perfection, yet he failed to realize that Dongfang Heyun’s mana had already latched onto his feathered robe like a parasitic worm. Even if he couldn’t visually distinguish the real body, his mana could still trace the correct escape route.

Since he already took my palm strike, the connection remains. No matter how he scatters like falling petals, it’ll be futile in the end.

Closing his eyes slightly, Dongfang Heyun sensed the distant fluctuations of mana. Stepping upon the seawater, he flew for several more miles before his form dispersed once again like mist. The surrounding ocean waters froze over in delicate layers, producing faint, crackling sounds.

The sea roared as Dongfang Heyun figure dissolved into vapor and reformed, emerging ahead of the fleeing light which blocked it completely.

Dongfang Heyun casually flicked his sleeve, appearing before Li Xizhi once more. Perhaps due to his severe injuries, Li Xizhi's perception had dulled. He remained focused on flying forward, unaware of the imminent obstruction.

"Eh?"

Dongfang Heyun’s usually gentle and refined expression shifted, a faint smile appearing on his face. With a casual flick of his sleeve, the Li Xizhi before him shattered into scattered beams of colorful light.

The fragmented light dispersed like a swarm of tiny fireflies, vanishing into the air. Left behind in the water was only a tattered feathered robe, gently drifting with the current. On its back, the deep blue palm imprint still shimmered brilliantly, radiating an ethereal glow.

Seeing this, Dongfang Heyun's smile widened as he thought, Good... very good... So he deliberately took my palm strike, then placed the feathered robe on a clone. The rainbow mist was merely a distraction... As expected, humans are cunning.

His smile soon faded as he extended his pale, jade-like fingers, lifting the feathered robe. Turning it over twice, he finally noticed a tiny ancient seal in the corner.

Yang.

The writing style was not contemporary but rather archaic. Having lived for many years, Dongfang Heyun recognized the mark and nodded in realization.

"So, he is a descendant of Yang Jinxin! That explains everything." He showed no urgency in pursuing Li Xizhi, instead gazing at the feathered robe with a calm expression, murmuring, "To think that the once-proud Yang family has fallen to such a state... They don't even have a single Purple Mansion Realm cultivator left!"

"But they do have connections in the Underworld... Even Suiguan wouldn’t dare act recklessly against them." After contemplating for a few seconds, he tucked the feathered robe into his sleeve. Then, pressing his two fingers together, he exhaled softly, causing a deep blue radiance to glow upon his fingertips. He whispered, "Heyun humbly borrows the esteemed force, passing through the Mansion’s decree, to traverse the great void..."

The seawater in front of Dongfang Heyun rippled violently, collapsing inward as though a great whale had opened its massive maw. A pitch-black rift appeared in the depths. Dongfang Heyun’s body transformed into mist, swirling upward before merging into the glowing light at his fingertips, then vanishing into the great void.

Far Away. The golden sun slowly rose over the ocean, casting a magnificent scene of gold and deep blue across the world. Yet Li Xizhi had no time to admire it, he was coughing violently.

Every ounce of his mana was being channeled into the Heavenly Glow beneath his feet. His qi reservoirs were being drained dry, all in service of maintaining his escape technique.

He had no idea how far he had flown. With trembling hands, he fished out several pills from his storage pouch and swallowed them hastily. He also stuck a few flight-enhancing talismans onto himself. Although their effects were meager, anything was better than nothing. Only then did he finally take a moment to survey his surroundings.

Dongfang Heyun fell for it, thought Li Xizhi.

With a single glance, Li Xizhi knew that Dongfang Heyun was an exceedingly confident individual. That very confidence had led him into the trap. Li Xizhi had sent out over a dozen clones and since Dongfang Heyun had failed to distinguish them immediately, he had lost his chance to do so altogether.

Even if Dongfang Heyun could use that void-traversing technique, there were certainly limitations. It took time to do so and he couldn’t just appear before Li Xizhi without cause or a guiding force. By all accounts, Li Xizhi had already escaped danger.

Yet, Li Xizhi dared not relax, nor did he let a single trace of triumph show on his face. He remembered well, this was never a true assassination. It was merely a punishment by a great demonic beast of the Purple Mansion Realm. Dongfang Heyun had never shown true killing intent.

But if he allowed even the slightest smirk, if he dared to laugh, things could take an entirely different turn.

So even though he seemed to have escaped on the surface, his expression remained cautious as he pushed himself to flee at full speed.

If the Purple Mansion master does not act... Dongfang Heyun’s most likely move would be to summon the sea tribes to inspect each clone one by one. If that happens, I won't last long. The question is, what will bring this to an end?

He flew in silence, the multicolored light beneath his feet reflected against the deep blue waters and created a breathtaking sight. He coughed twice, then, his pupils suddenly dilated.

Before him, a pitch-black void emerged in midair. A young man calmly adjusted his robes and stepped forward from within, gazing at him with refined elegance as he spoke softly, "Fellow Daoist, your calculations are truly impressive!"

He traversed the great void! There's... there's no escaping this! thought Li Xizhi.

Panic surged in his heart. He flung out the five or six talismans hidden in his sleeve. The talismans expanded in midair into colossal barriers of light and floated with glowing runes that exuded an imposing aura. But it was already too late.

Dongfang Heyun’s jade-like palm sliced through the air. Only the first talisman managed to briefly slow him down; the rest were left trailing uselessly behind. He gently pressed his palm against Li Xizhi’s abdomen, sending him reeling as he spat out blood, which billowed into a mist of multicolored light.

Dongfang Heyun’s palm pierced straight through Li Xizhi’s abdomen. As he withdrew his hand, the blood staining his flawless, jade-like skin rapidly transformed into radiant clouds.

Gold In Cloud!

It was only thanks to Li Xizhi’s mastery of escape techniques that, even in his dazed state, he could still step out the golden light. His form dispersed like mist, leaving behind three dazzling trails of multicolored radiance, reappearing more than two meters away.

The morning sun brightened along the horizon and Li Xizhi struggled to remain conscious. A shimmering glow appeared in his palm, which he pressed against the gaping wound in his chest.

From his other sleeve, he flung several more talismans. White runic light flickered in midair, but before they could fully manifest, a sharp cracking sound echoed. Ice crystals spread across the sea’s surface. Dongfang Heyun had already bypassed the barriers and stood right before him.

Once again, he unleashed that suffocating technique. The surrounding spiritual energy thickened, shattering the spell Li Xizhi had just formed. Dongfang Heyun calmly raised his hand and grasped Li Xizhi’s throat.

"Hmm?" The refined, gentle youth suddenly paused. A smile played at his lips as he blinked, his dark eyelashes catching the glow of dawn. He glanced at the sky and remarked, "Time is up."

Dongfang Heyun slowly released his grip, letting the immobilized Li Xizhi remain suspended in midair. Raising his jade-like hand, he straightened Li Xizhi’s disheveled robes.

He studied Li Xizhi carefully, then seemed to realize something. Reaching into his sleeve, he retrieved the tattered feathered robe, which had been neatly folded and gently draped it over Li Xizhi’s arm. Only then did he nod in satisfaction.

Dongfang Heyun politely stepped back, bowed slightly, and spoke in a warm tone, "I was merely carrying out an immortal’s decree to eliminate you. My offense is great. I ask for your forgiveness, fellow Daoist."

From the start of this chase until now, his robes had never once creased. He offered another courteous bow, his voice as gentle as before, he said, "I am Dongfang Heyun, born from the first breath exhaled by a Dragon Monarch during his pill formation. I follow the clouds and ride the mist, and it seems we share a certain fate. May I ask for your esteemed name, fellow Daoist?"

Li Xizhi wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and rasped, "Li Xizhi of Qingsui Peak."

"Good." With that single word, Dongfang Heyun dissipated like mist and vanished into the morning light. Li Xizhi's legs nearly gave out beneath him and he almost plummeted into the sea.

He was still clutching the feathered robe that Yang Xiao'er had given him. There were secrets hidden within it, but he had no time to investigate. Panting heavily, he quickly retrieved several medicinal pills and swallowed them.

Only after taking a few deep breaths did he manage to steady himself in midair. Spotting a small island, he descended. As soon as he landed, he coughed up a mist of multicolored blood and muttered, "My guess wasn’t too far off."

When Dongfang Heyun tore through the great void, Li Xizhi had indeed been startled. But the moment the palm strike landed, hitting him squarely in the abdomen, most of his fear had already dissipated.

Dongfang Heyun did not intend to kill him. The disparity in power between his earlier restraint and later attacks was significant. Considering his ability to traverse the great void, it was now quite clear.

Had he intended to kill, he could have done so immediately upon emerging from the great void. Why wait until now? It was simply because Dongfang Heyun had been tasked with inflicting enough damage within a limited time. Li Xizhi had calculated correctly. By forcing the time constraint, he had made Dongfang Heyun exert full effort at the last moment.

That being said, within the parameters of the battle, Dongfang Heyun had shown no mercy. This was, in itself, a form of selection. If Li Xizhi had not been up to standard, then he would have simply died. His survival or demise would have made no difference to the Azure Pond Sect or the Dragon Clan.

This chance at survival... I had to fight for every bit of it.

Even so, taking that palm strike directly without any dharma artifact to protect him was no minor matter. Li Xizhi slowly sat down, feeling the internal injuries that the strike had left behind and pondered over his condition.

Dongfang Heyun’s technique primarily inflicted mana-based damage, with deep blue energy continuously corroding his body. However, Li Xizhi was uniquely suited to counter it. His Rainbow Pierce Skyway allowed him to dissolve external mana.

But the fact remained that the palm strike had torn through his abdomen and coupled with his earlier severed arm, the injuries were severe and could not be ignored.

Now, sitting quietly, he finally had the chance to piece together the sequence of events and organize his thoughts.

"He wants to harm me..."
