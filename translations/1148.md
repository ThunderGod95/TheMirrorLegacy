# Chapter 1148: Besieged by North and West

Immortal light cascaded like a waterfall as clouds of Purple Qi billowed.

The Golden Feather Sect shimmered with a brilliant radiance, a picture of profound peace. Several streaks of immortal light soared through the air with carefree leisure. Within a high courtyard, an old man and a young man sat across from each other, sipping tea and playing a board game.

The young man placed his game piece, his expression still tinged with emotion.

“He was from the Wang clan of Guzhou Prefecture.”

“Guzhou Prefecture… the place where the Dao was first propagated. Wang Ziya… I suppose you could say we are all one family.”

The old man folded his hands, his tone heavy with sentiment.

“True Monarch Xu Xiang is gone, after all, and the Numinous Treasure Order is not faring well. No matter how much face they’re owed, it’s their people who must now venture into the mortal world.”

Tianhuo shook his head.

“Ancestor… his lifespan is nearly at its end. This isn’t such a bad assignment. Besides, True Monarch Xu Xiang always advocated for worldly engagement, so sending someone from the Numinous Treasure Order is only reasonable. What I fear is… Qi Lanyan’s current madness!”

“I don’t care what schemes he’s plotting. If he dares ruin Chengyun’s chances, he’ll be making an enemy of my Zhang family!”

Daoist Master Chunshuo’s expression turned grave.

“After all, my lineage has only produced this one hero. They are already guarding against us at every turn; we cannot afford the slightest compromise. As for the matter in Jianghuai, my family does not have grand ambitions. We don’t ask for great benefits, but he must at least attain the Purple Mystery and secure a chance at reincarnation.”

A cold glint flashed in Tianhuo’s eyes.

“Qi Lanyan’s madness may seem random, but it has roots. The lord is paving the way for the head disciple of that eminence in Dongmu Heaven—he has been through two reincarnations and has perfected his divine abilities. He can’t wait any longer!”

Daoist Master Chunshuo frowned.

“With his abilities, securing an Auxiliary Position shouldn’t be a problem. But to aim for a Fruition Attainment, and the Bright Yang one at that… We’re talking about Li Qianyuan. It’s no wonder the lord has been suppressing him. How can someone who has only cultivated within a grotto-heaven possibly contend with Emperor Wei?”

Tianhuo remained noncommittal.

“Whether he can contend or not depends on Bright Yang’s state. Do you not see the meaning in the name? The 'Seeker' in Sun Seeker Ring is a deliberate choice. It's pronounced the same as the word for 'Manifest,' but it was written without the 'King' radical. It's a clear sign: Bright Yang has cast off his royal path to return to the true one.”

“Comprehending Profoundity made the right calculation, keeping him out of the mortal world to cultivate as an immortal!”

The elder Daoist Master Chunshuo disagreed.

“I don’t believe it—and many within the grotto-heavens share my disbelief. That is the august Emperor Wei we speak of, and he once possessed the Sun Seeker Ring. How could he possibly be a fish on the chopping block? I fear that one careless day, the world will have a sovereign father once again.”

Tianhuo could only shake his head and smile.

“Ancestor, there’s no need to argue. Just watch. In the end, we are also loyal to Comprehending Profoundity. This junior recalls… when Lord Xue… when Lord Xue came to the mountain, he left behind two Immortal Edicts. One was for Emperor Wei’s reincarnation and his journey through Jianghuai.”

“The other, he told us to hide, to offer incense to it year after year, and to wait for the Second Manifestation in the world to open it…”

He chuckled.

“This junior has a premonition. When that time comes… this affair, which has been entangled for a thousand years, will finally be resolved.”

Daoist Master Chunshuo’s face was grim. He was about to speak when a streak of light shot toward them, landing swiftly in Tianhuo’s hand and transforming into a golden scroll no larger than his palm.

Tianhuo accepted it with both hands, though his expression held little respect. He smiled.

“I wonder what our great general is up to now!”

At the mention of Qing Jifang, even the good-natured Daoist Master Chunshuo couldn’t hide his disgust.

“They’re both grand generals, but it’s one thing for him to be inferior to Yang Ruiyi. In my eyes, he can’t even compare to Qi Lanyan!”

“He’s meant to be inferior. Otherwise, what would be the point of having him?”

Tianhuo smiled and shook his head, unrolling the scroll to reveal the golden text within.

‘The Zhao and Song have fallen out. Order Daoist Masters Muyan and Hongyan to take advantage of the situation and attack the Western Mountains. Observe the situation… strike when they are vulnerable. Ting Province, Jianghuai… ripe for the taking…’

The young man’s face hardened.

“He’s tangled in an inseparable fight with the Xiangxiong Kingdom and Yin Baiyue in the west, yet he still has his eyes on the Song court… and now he’s ordering us around?”

But after reading it over several times, Tianhuo frowned.

“How strange. Does Qing Jifang actually have the foresight to see that Qi Lanyan doesn’t plan to defend Jianghuai? Does he even know how to add frost to the snow in Ting Province?”

“Perhaps Qi Lanyan has been secretly advising him.”

Daoist Master Chunshuo shook his head.

“Then what is our position?”

Tianhuo set the golden scroll down and smiled.

“We are doing our part for the kingdom, of course. Naturally, we’ll go and have a look together.”

Lingu Lanying returned in a hurry from the south, passing through a heavy gloom, only to see a man standing amidst the clouds. His gray robes drifted in the wind. A small, brown pouch hung at his waist, looking heavy with whatever it contained, while on his other side hung a small, silver-white sword no longer than a palm.

Lingu Lanying quickly bowed in salute.

“Greetings, benefactor!”

The man was Lin Chensheng.

The newly ascended Daoist Master of the Great Xiukui Monastery, armed with numerous powerful treasures and secret sword talismans, had led the Song cultivators to a great victory against the northern cultivators in the region from Jingchuan to Linhai. Yet, his expression was unchanged, and he appeared to be in excellent condition.

Although everyone understood that Murong Yan and the others had likely been wary of being flanked by Yang Ruiyi and had long intended to retreat, merely using the battle as a convenient excuse, they were still stunned by the power of the treasures from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Seeing him now, Lingu Lanying simply smiled.

“Congratulations, benefactor!”

Lingu Lanying was perceptive and adopted a humble attitude. Lin Chensheng was polite in return, his expression serious.

“You’ve also come to see the grand general. Let us go together.”

He turned and strode forward. They entered the main hall together, where they saw a white-haired old man standing off to the side, his head bowed. The True Fire on his body had been extinguished, but dark, tattoo-like marks remained.

'Situ Huo.'

The Great Xiukui Monastery and the Situ family had never been on good terms, but times were different. Even though the blood-soaked saber on Situ Huo’s back was an eyesore to Lin Chensheng, he still gave a slight nod in greeting.

Lingu Lanying bowed.

“The grand general’s many orders have been relayed. The Daoist Masters have already departed for Ting Province!”

Yang Ruiyi, seated at the head of the hall, appeared deeply worried. His focus was clearly not on the ‘Daoist Masters.’ He asked with some urgency,

“What was King Wei’s reply?”

After asking, he felt he had misspoken. With a wave of his hand, a current of dark energy separated the two of them from the others. Lingu Lanying reported,

“This subordinate delivered the orders. King Wei asked about the northern strategies, and I answered him. I did not dare to linger and left for the south immediately… It’s just that, when I saw him…”

She was reluctant to say more, but seeing Yang Ruiyi’s probing gaze, she added awkwardly,

“He seemed full of doubt and did not give a clear answer.”

Yang Ruiyi’s anxiety deepened. He wanted to reprimand Lingu Lanying for her incompetence, but considering the setting, he waved his hand to disperse the Exiled Qi. He forced a smile only when he saw Lin Chensheng.

“Chensheng, you’ve come… You are a great meritorious official!”

Yang Ruiyi’s attitude toward Lin Chensheng was far better than even his treatment of Situ Huo. He immediately stood and walked down from his seat. Lin Chensheng quickly bowed and offered a polite remark before his smile vanished.

“I heard… something happened at Baiye Creek?”

Yang Ruiyi’s smile faded. He sighed.

“Yes… A person of note has arrived from the north.”

This made Lin Chensheng raise an eyebrow. He asked softly,

“And which family might this person be from?”

Though his tone was calm, Yang Ruiyi detected something unusual in it. He suddenly remembered the tragedy that had befallen the Great Xiukui Monastery, and a thought flickered in his mind,

'That master and disciple from the Great Xiukui Monastery both fell on the same day. It was undoubtedly the work of Wuguang. His heart must be burning with hatred…'

But what use was it? Yang Ruiyi saw it most clearly. Though the Great Xiukui Monastery still had some resources, the lowest-ranking enemy Lin Chensheng would have to face for his revenge was Qi Lanyan, and the highest was the Great Daoist Master of Mount Luoxia himself!

He could only sigh.

“He is a successor from the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition of True Monarch Xu Xiang, a ‘Returning Earth’ cultivator from Tongxuan Palace. They say his name is Wang Ziya.”

Having been thwarted and put on the defensive, Yang Ruiyi was clearly angered.

“To give him some credit, he is a Tongxuan cultivator, a successor of the Numinous Treasure lineage. But in reality, he’s just someone sent out from a grotto-heaven! If he were truly a major figure, would he have the time to swagger about on the river?”

His words, however, prompted the previously silent Situ Huo to speak. The old man said,

“Even an ordinary figure from a grotto-heaven possesses such skill.”

Yang Ruiyi fell silent for a moment, perhaps realizing his words had sounded like a slight against the Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition. But then Lin Chensheng spoke.

“He is no longer ordinary. The grotto-heavens are sparsely populated. To be qualified to venture into the mortal world, one must be a top-tier figure at the very least, whose path forward has simply been severed.”

Wang Ziya had beaten Situ Huo so thoroughly that he had no fight left in him, and the sense of defeat among the divine ability masters of the Great Song was palpable. Although the Great Song was not as fragmented as the north, their words were filled with apprehension.

Yang Ruiyi saw their reluctance to fight but remained impassive. Seeing his inaction, Lin Chensheng frowned.

“Tangdao Mountain cannot be held for long. No matter what, we must do everything we can to reinforce them. If this man makes a move, the grand general himself will have to face him, which will be a great deal of trouble… At that point… I’m afraid it will be a grievous blow.”

“Even if we survive this calamity, when the north pushes south again, I fear we will lose territory once more.”

His words were tactful but realistic. With Wang Ziya’s appearance, given the current strength of both sides, the already struggling Great Song was instantly at a disadvantage. If not for the fact that everyone knew the Underworld stood behind the Yang family, they might as well declare the nation on the verge of collapse!

But Yang Ruiyi was calm.

“It’s of no concern. The grand formation at Tangdao is formidable. With our main forces stationed here, their troops will not dare to retreat. With Liu Bai holding the Guzhou Cauldron, holding out for a few months will not be difficult.”

As he said this, the divine ability masters present all agreed, though they exchanged bewildered glances in secret. Before they could say more, another report came from below.

“There is movement at the Western Mountains… It appears to be Western Shu deploying troops, with the intent of invading the east!”

None of the previous news had shaken the grand general in the slightest, but this report sent him into a sudden rage. He gritted his teeth.

“It’s Qing Jifang again! That medicine puppet who knocked his head against Bright Yang! How dare he! Sooner or later, I will make him… I will make him…”

He never finished his sentence, leaving everyone at a loss.

Yang Ruiyi’s heart was truly ablaze.

The Daoist Masters of the Great Song were all worried that the situation was dire and the balance had been broken. They believed that as long as Qi Lanyan in the north was in his right mind, he would press his advantage and push south, leading to a disastrous defeat for them. But Yang Ruiyi knew in his heart that Qi Lanyan wouldn’t dare!

The Great Song’s ultimate trump card, the Great Daoist Master of the Sword Gate, Lingmei, had not yet emerged from his seclusion!

'The purpose of launching the war early was not to strike at the Great Song, but to signal to me that he will wait… wait until Lingmei emerges!'

'Qi Lanyan is already treading on the edge of the Thunder Pool. As long as Lingmei remains in seclusion, the north and south are not evenly matched. He absolutely will not make another move, much less attack Tangdao Mountain.'

For this reason, Yang Ruiyi was not worried about Wang Ziya at all. He was worried about the King of Wei of the Great Song—Li Zhouwei!

Although not a single divine ability master in the Great Song could see through the situation, even the shrewd and cunning Situ Huo who was personally involved only had a vague premonition. Li Zhouwei should have been completely ignorant of the scheme, but Yang Tianyou’s words echoed constantly in his mind.

“He is no ordinary man!”

This made him hesitate. He dismissed the cultivators from the hall. He picked up his brush several times, only to set it down again. He waited and waited in the great hall, but no news came. He drew out a wisp of Exiled Qi to divine the future, but then remembered that neither Ting Province nor Li Zhouwei could be scried.

So he took out a scroll, forced himself to calm down, and began to read.

He didn't know how much time had passed when he was suddenly startled awake. Sensing something, his expression changed dramatically. He walked down quickly, crossed the hall, and looked up. His gray-brown eyes filled with a golden reflection.

“The Sword Gate?”

---

Myriad Radiance Sword Gate.

Above the sword peak, gray clouds churned and colorful mists swirled. The sea had turned a deep, dark blue, with only an occasional point of escaping light flying past.

On the peak, the verdant qi known as the ‘Auspicious Spring Breeze,’ which shot to the heavens and nourished the riverbanks, had billowed away. Beneath a profound pine that stood like a stately canopy, fallen leaves littered the ground. A Daoist in long robes stood among them, his expression complex.

He carried a sword on his back, his face grim. He had a long face and thick brows, and the golden qi around him was remarkably condensed. This was the Cheng family’s Daoist Master from the Sword Gate—Cheng Jiuwen!

For many years, the Sword Gate had enjoyed a fine reputation, regarded as the righteous path in Jiangnan. But in recent decades, disputes over Daoist traditions and philosophy had nearly paralyzed the sect. As a Daoist Master of the Sword Gate caught in the middle of it all, Cheng Jiuwen’s reputation had quietly suffered.

He seemed completely unconcerned, always doing as he pleased, and rarely appeared before the cultivators of Jiangnan. But now, this Daoist Master, who was usually either in seclusion or traveling, stood silently beneath the tree.

He looked up. The pine needles rustled, carrying a light fragrance on the breeze. He spoke.

“Senior Heaven's Horn…”

Cheng Jiuwen’s expression was complicated.

“I’m afraid Martial Uncle is about to succeed.”

As soon as Cheng Jiuwen spoke, the profound pine—Jiangnan’s foremost spiritual plant, personally planted by a True Monarch—began to tremble as if to console him. The sword cultivator’s eyes reddened slightly. Patches of green qi sprinkled down from the tree, making him raise his eyebrows and look toward the sky.

Outside the grand formation stood a young man in a black robe with golden patterns!

His face was majestic, his build powerful but not overly massive, giving him an air of profound solidity. His golden eyes were deep and dark. Set against his qilin-patterned golden and black robe, he looked as if he had stepped out of a painting, no longer a mortal man.

Behind him, the massive, mystical, and ethereal image of a Celestial Gate covered in profound patterns had already appeared. Billowing Heavenly Light surged into the sky, parting the dark clouds and illuminating the world.

A ripple passed through Cheng Jiuwen’s gaze. He rode the wind to greet him, raising his eyebrows in a salute.

“Greetings, King Wei!”

Li Zhouwei was quite courteous. His golden eyes met Cheng Jiuwen’s as he smiled.

“I have come to ask for guidance on a few matters. I only hope I am not disturbing you, Senior Cheng.”

“Not at all!”

Cheng Jiuwen bowed his head slightly and led him into the mountain.
