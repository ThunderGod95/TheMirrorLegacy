# Chapter 787: Qingxu

As soon as Li Ximing finished speaking, Xia Shouyu nodded eagerly and ducked back into the temple. Li Ximing, meanwhile, rose on the wind, concealed his figure, and began a wide circuit of the island.

The island itself was unremarkable. While its spiritual energy might be considered exceptional here at the Sea's Cape, in Jiangnan it would only rival their ancestral lands at Mount Lijing. The earth vein was substantial, but the land was barren, completely lacking mineral deposits; it possessed neither a fire vein nor a water vein.

'No wonder Xia Shouyu is considered an accomplished cultivator in this place, yet her robes are still a patched-together mess.'

A barren, spirit-dead mountain dominated the center of the island, much like the Western Mountains back at the lake. It was a place where one couldn't even find purchase in the Great Void—a sheer mass of inert earth and stone occupying the terrain. Someone had dug two small caves into it. It seemed the monks of Qingxu Temple were engaged in a generational effort to move the mountain, planning to excavate it entirely.

The temple compound held no surprises. Arrays were pitifully scarce; their poverty was appalling. Only the highest shrine held anything of note: a Daoist statue sculpted from a spiritual item of Treasured Earth, a 'Wondrous Life Stone.' Judging by the aura, it was indeed meant to be Xu Xiang of the Xuanmiao Temple, though the craftsmanship was even cruder than the statue there. This version was standing, not riding his customary donkey.

Having completed his survey, Li Ximing had a clear picture. 'True Monarch Xu Xiang belongs to the Tongxuan Dao lineage. If the Xuanmiao Temple was founded upon receiving a direct branch of Xu Xiang’s legacy, then this Qingxu Temple was, at best, established by some tangential disciple who barely grazed the true teaching. It is far too crude.'

He returned, treading on light, to the space above the temple, just as an urgent bell began tolling, its clangor echoing across the entire island. A flood of monks in yellow robes, their feet in white bindings and black shoes, came rushing up the mountain path, covering the slopes like a yellow cloud. They lined both sides of the path, gradually filling the space with kneeling figures. The yellow-robed monks pushed and shoved; several weaker ones tumbled from the narrow edge, falling down the slope and striking their heads, drawing blood. Still, those behind them continued to press forward, fighting for a place to kneel. Above them, several Qi Refining cultivators zipped through the air, shouting stern reprimands at the chaotic crowd.

Li Ximing swept his gaze over the scene below. Everything was arranged—a sea of bowed yellow robes and heads of all sizes. Xia Shouyu emerged supporting an old man dressed in simple hemp robes, followed closely by two other middle-aged men. The group knelt before the temple entrance, their voices rising in unison: "We humbly welcome the Daoist Master! This small temple at the Sea's Cape is overwhelmed by your presence and eternally grateful!"

The old man’s voice drifted through the air. The sheer scale of the reception was excessive, forcing a frown from Li Ximing. He immediately descended as a beam of light, materializing before the four of them.

The sudden appearance of the white-and-gold-robed Daoist Master made the old man shudder, and he pressed his forehead firmly to the ground. Even seeing this, he struggled to believe it. 'Why would a master of such profound power visit the Sea's Cape? Could it be a Foundation Establishment cultivator in disguise?'

But whether Foundation Establishment or Purple Mansion, Qingxu Temple could afford to offend neither. The old man kept his head bowed. Li Ximing had no intention of bullying a mere Qi Refining cultivator. "What is all this ceremony for? Dismiss them. Just lead me inside."

Xia Shouyu immediately took the lead. The temple's interior paths were narrow corridors carved from the rock, supported by numerous wooden beams. No sunlight penetrated this deep; only the steady glow of dharma lamps kept the passages from true darkness. The old Temple Master hurried to catch up, his voice still trembling. "Daoist Master..."

Li Ximing waved him off. "Which lineage is this? Where does it trace back to?"

The old man and Xia Shouyu exchanged a glance. Drawing on fragmented memories from ancient texts, the old man, Xia Sui, hurried to explain. "Reporting to the Daoist Master! This lowly one is Xia Sui, the unworthy master of Qingxu Temple. Our lineage originates from the Shu region. We were once subordinates of the Xumi Palace. After an upheaval within the palace, it fractured: Qingxu fled east, Qingkong fled south, and Qingzhen fled north. The three temples scattered, eventually settling by the Ju Sea.

"Later, the world changed, as did the ancient rules of Dragon-kin 'sea-herding.' The Ju Sea was seized by Daoist Master Caichi, who renamed it the Peacock Sea. His oppression grew heavier, forcing our ancestors to flee again, finally settling here at the Sea's Cape."

This 'sea-herding' they spoke of was indeed an ancient matter. Once, all seas were the domain of Dragon-kin. Beyond the major oceans like the Hetian Sea and the Vermillion Sea, countless smaller seas existed. Various dragon clans received fiefdoms within these waters, taking turns overseeing the different oceans in a practice known as 'sea-herding.' Today, the Dragon-kin are largely reduced to the Eastern Sea and their numbers have dwindled, but other seas, like the Admirable Sea and the Crimson Reef Sea, are still ruled by dragons bearing the title of Dragon King. Their territories have simply become fixed and hereditary, and the term 'sea-herding' has fallen from common use.

"'Such an ancient origin... surviving has not been easy for you. Qingkong Temple...'"

Li Ximing recognized the name; it was familiar. There had been a minor sect by that name back in the Wu state, a place where Elder White Ape had once concocted medicines. He wondered if it was the same branch. That sect, however, had been annihilated during the demonic calamity.

"Qingkong Temple was destroyed decades ago," he said softly. "The north, furthermore, is the territory of Buddhist cultivators. It is likely that of the old Xumi Palace, your lineage is the only one left. Treasure what you have."

Seeing his knowledgeable demeanor, the old Temple Master Xia found himself mostly convinced. Yet, the man before him was a fiend of immense power, and the words of such beings could rarely be trusted. He could only nod meekly in agreement, offering no real response.

Li Ximing smiled. "Come, show me around."

The two hurried to lead the way, but Li Ximing walked faster, moving as if he knew the temple better than they did. He proceeded directly to a small pavilion. The two middle-aged men behind them lowered their heads and exchanged a nervous glance. Xia Shouyu nearly tripped over herself scrambling to keep up, rushing ahead to open the door for him.

As the pavilion door swung open, the meager collection of scrolls and sutras stored within was revealed. Li Ximing did not step inside, but smiled. "I have heard that the Sea's Cape preserves many unique alchemy techniques, most derived from ancient paths, though they say few are usable today. I happen to be an alchemist. Might I be permitted to study them?"

Xia Shouyu’s heart seized in terror. 'Does he even need to ask? I already know he’s an alchemist... He refined that Great King with nothing but a breath!'

She scrambled to retrieve the few alchemy manuals they possessed, clutching the pile tightly as she offered them respectfully. "The Sea's Cape is remote, and our alchemy Dao is withered. Our lineage possesses no usable recipes... These are all relics from antiquity. With our meager cultivation, we have long been unable to make use of them."

'Truly destitute,' Li Ximing realized. Qingxu Temple didn't have a single functional alchemy recipe. The massive pile Xia Shouyu held was just a collection of ancient, defunct formulas used to pad their archives. He took them and flipped through a few, finding them filled with nonsensical concoctions fabricated by later generations.

"..."

He paused, silent for a moment, then said in a low voice, "Your Qingxu Temple will collect ancient recipes from the surrounding areas for me. If any formula seems suspicious or unique, acquire it."

"Yes..." Xia Shouyu agreed immediately, but the old Temple Master, who had not witnessed the events in the cave, hesitated at the implied cost.

Li Ximing simply turned and walked away. Xia Shouyu hurried after him, only to feel a sudden weight drop into her sleeve. Several jade vials had appeared.

"Consume these resources," Li Ximing’s voice transmitted to her. "Polish your cultivation to its peak as quickly as possible, so that you may consume an Essence Gathering Pill."

Joy flashed in Xia Shouyu's heart. She saw that the old Temple Master and the two middle-aged men were oblivious. She nodded silently. When they returned to the main courtyard gate, the group stood respectfully by his side.

The Daoist Master turned back to them, the Profound Light between his brows flashing. He smiled. "You must understand, that pill was of great use to me. You rendered significant aid both before and during the process, and you were badly injured. Allow me to offer you a reward."

Xia Shouyu and the old Temple Master were overjoyed at his words, but the woman immediately dropped to her knees. "To have aided the Daoist Master and witnessed the birth of an immortal pill is this lowly one’s greatest fortune! How could I dare ask for repayment?"

Li Ximing ignored her protests. With a gentle shake of his gold-and-white sleeve, he issued his command: "Instruct everyone in the temple. Order them all to remain within the temple grounds. For the next seven *shichen*, they are to burn incense and chant sutras. No one is to leave the temple. There will be no cooking or lighting of fires, no riding the wind or striking bells, no gathering or refining of Qi, and no use of any gold or silver implements."

(T\L Note: Shichen converts to "Two Hours)

Though Xia Shouyu did not understand the decree, she immediately sent the two middle-aged men to relay the orders. The men were clearly unaccustomed to taking commands from her, their expressions showing anger they dared not voice. Li Ximing noted this, then pointed at her. "You, and the old Temple Master," he said softly. "The two of you will remain here, in this courtyard. Do not leave."

Xia Shouyu and the old Temple Master exchanged a look and agreed. The Daoist Master in white-gold robes had already vanished.

A creeping dread settled over the two as they sat down in the courtyard, facing each other in silence. After one *shichen* passed, a frigid wind began to howl, whistling through the cracks in the courtyard gate. The cold was bone-piercing. A while later, the ground beneath them began to tremble violently, as if an eruption of Baleful Qi was surging from below. Xia Shouyu’s vision blurred black and gray as dust and debris rained down from the roof beams.

"Aiyooo!" The old Temple Master, barely a Qi Refining cultivator, lost his footing completely. He rolled on the ground, wailing in despair. "It’s over! Fiends are man-eaters by nature! How could we trust his words! He must have been injured before and couldn't act, and now he’s going to devour the entire temple! We invited this doom upon ourselves!

"I heard people on the next island say that masters of great divine ability have entire worlds inside their stomachs... All this commotion... if he isn't moving us into his belly, what else could it be? Aiyooo... we’re going to spend eternity living in the dark inside his guts!"

Although Xia Shouyu was equally terrified, she clung to the memory of him sparing the islanders. She forced a shaky smile. "Great-Grandfather, what nonsense are you sprouting? The Daoist Master commands the Profound Light; his stomach must surely be brightly lit. At least we’ll save money on lamps..."

A short time later, they heard the sounds of shadows moving outside and a chorus of terrified screams. The two were horrified and clung to each other, weeping, but they still dared not leave the courtyard. They waited until the sky began to lighten at dawn, only then did they hear ecstatic shouts from beyond the gate.

"Temple Master! Madam! You must come out! Quickly!"

The voices were brimming with joy. 'The environment inside his stomach must be quite pleasant,' Xia Shouyu thought wryly.

The two finally opened the gate. They were met by bright daylight and two yellow-robed monks kneeling before them. Their robes were covered in dust, but their faces were masks of ecstatic shock. "Madam!" one cried out. "The mountain! It's gone!"

"What?"

Xia Shouyu and the old Temple Master froze in unison. Exchanging a look of disbelief, they both rose on the wind.

It was true. The spirit-dead, barren mountain was completely gone. The massive peak that had dominated the island and blocked their view had vanished, replaced by a vast, open plain stretching as far as the eye could see. Shrouded in the morning mist, the new expanse of flat land measured thousands of acres.

With a bubbling rush, clear spring water erupted from the new ground. The old Temple Master's legs gave out, and he collapsed onto the fresh earth. A moment later, he scrambled back up, ran to the spring, and grabbed a handful of dark soil, bursting into tears. "It’s good... it’s good... From now on, we don't have to dig the mountain..."

Xia Shouyu wiped away her own tears, the memory of the screams returning. She turned to the two monks. "Why did we hear screaming during the night?"

One hurried to answer. "In the middle of the night, the Baleful Qi was overwhelming. Some of the bolder disciples disobeyed orders and went out to look. A few were burned in the eyes by the Qi, and several had their legs broken by falling rocks. There was also one idiot who lit a fire in private to smoke some leaves; a stray spark ignited something, and the blast took off his hand..."

"Haha." Xia Shouyu let out a cold laugh. "Serves the idiots right. A whole vine of lazy, idle fools. It’s fortunate they didn't jeopardize the Daoist Master’s work, otherwise beating them to death would have been too lenient!"

The old Temple Master was still kneeling on the new earth, completely mesmerized. Xia Shouyu had to shake his shoulder forcefully. "Great-Grandfather! The ancient recipes! The alchemy recipes! We must send people immediately! We cannot delay!"

This finally snapped the old man out of his stupor. He nodded frantically, his voice trembling with residual fear and newfound awe. "Men! Everyone, assemble!"

When the remaining monks had gathered, the old Temple Master dispatched them all with frantic orders. Afterward, he stood in the main hall, wringing his hands and muttering to Xia Shouyu, "I have heard that Foundation Establishment lineages possess mountain-moving arts. But even those require complex arrays, rituals, and months of effort! Who has ever heard of leveling an entire mountain in just seven *shichen*? This is a master of great divine ability, without question! He must be one of the figures from Nine Mounds Mountain! If we serve him well... this is an opportunity most people could never dream of!"

Xia Shouyu already knew the 'old fiend' was terrifyingly strong, but she hadn't realized he was capable of *this*. She lifted her chin, a touch of pride in her expression. But she was keenly aware of the Foundation Establishment path Li Ximing had promised her. She kept this guardedly to herself.

'He also promised an Essence Gathering Pill... I cannot let the old man know about that. There are too many fawning men in this temple. I manage everything for you fools day and night. I let you skim resources here and there, but this supreme opportunity? I will not let any of you steal it from me.'

***

Meanwhile, Li Ximing toured the surrounding sea. Treading on light just beneath the waves, he found the seabed was relatively shallow. Sunlight pierced the depths, illuminating the water in a clear azure hue—the distinct color of Converging Water.

He searched the area. It was just as impoverished as the island, holding nothing but coral and white sand. He eventually located one undersea cave with a trace of spiritual energy, but the demon beast dwelling within—having had nothing substantial to hunt—was surprisingly full of clear spiritual qi. He waved his hand and chased it away.

Relying on his current cultivation base and the power of the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, his ability to move mountains—while perhaps not equal to Changxi’s Bound Earth divine abilities—was certainly not lacking. Furthermore, the barren peak had been spirit-dead, unconnected to any water or spirit veins and only loosely tied to the main earth vein. It was little more than a pile of inert rock sitting on the land, making its removal exceptionally easy.

'Everyone in Qingxu Temple has average talent at best... only Xia Shouyu is outstanding. She's usable. Her background is clean—dirt poor—and she knows how to act...'

To earn a rating of 'outstanding' from Li Ximing, her innate talent was naturally excellent. One had to understand that in a desolate place like the Sea's Cape, resources were pitiful. Even as a high-ranking member of the temple, her access to resources was incomparable to cultivators within the inner seas. To reach the late stage of Qi Refining here, relying on almost nothing, was a genuinely difficult achievement.

Since he had promised her the path to Foundation Establishment, he intended to follow through. If she succeeded, she would gain the ability to cross the seas to major lands like Hetian or Vermillion Sea. She certainly wouldn't remain at the Sea's Cape. Why would he waste an Essence Gathering Pill otherwise? Of course, the plan was to bring her back to the lake for his own use.

He already had a role planned for Xia Shouyu. Taking out an array disk, he casually set up a perimeter array within the empty undersea cave. He retrieved the Profound Adamant Essence Gathering Pill.

'While I wait for them to collect the recipes, I can continue suppressing the flame, repairing my dharma body, and finding ways to gather intelligence... There is no hurry to return. The Sea's Cape is infinitely safer than Jiangnan right now.'

Li Ximing suddenly understood why Xiao Chuting spent so much time running off to the Northern Sea. That Daoist Master was partly plotting his own advancement, but he was also using the isolation to avoid countless overt and subtle probes back home.

With that thought, Li Ximing cleared his mind and entered seclusion.
