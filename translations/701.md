# Chapter 701: Taking Account

The moment Li Ximing spoke, Duche felt as if he had received a grand pardon. Sweat poured from his brow like rain as he kowtowed, striking his head against the ground a full nine times before finally retreating.

“Thank you, Daoist Master, for sparing my life!”

Li Ximing did not bother himself with such a minor figure, but the other members of the Li clan wore grim expressions. At the foot of the mountain, An Siwei refused to even glance at the emissary. Duche, knowing his place, scurried away in terror, melting into the night as he fled northward.

Li Ximing sat in quiet contemplation for a time before a middle-aged man ascended the stone steps. Dressed in resplendent feathered robes, he carried himself with an air of grace and dignity. A genuine smile finally touched Li Ximing’s lips, and he rose from the table to greet him.

“Brother Zhi!”

Li Xizhi smiled and bowed his head, clasping his hands in salute.

“Greetings, Daoist Master Zhaojing!”

“Brother, please don’t tease me.”

With his own brother before him, Li Ximing shed the imposing air of a Purple Mansion cultivator, reverting to his old self. He pulled Li Xizhi to sit beside him, his voice filled with concern.

“You’ve worked hard in the sect all these years. You and Zhouwei have shouldered the burdens of our clan, preventing any loss of life or land for a decade. You even nurtured several new Foundation Establishment cultivators. It is all thanks to your efforts.”

“The credit belongs mostly to Zhouwei,” Li Xizhi demurred, though a worried look lingered on his face. “I just came from the ancestral hall. Uncle Yuanqin is still paying his respects to our late grand-uncle… but on my way, I saw someone from the White Ye Immortal Sect leaving in a great hurry. Did something happen?”

“Yes…” Li Ximing murmured.

Li Xizhi continued, “Daoist Master Yehui of the White Ye Immortal Sect is at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. He cultivates a rare Dao lineage of the Capital Guard, which makes him difficult to handle. Also, I noticed the Changxiao Gate was not present at the banquet. That sect is truly at odds with our family. Daoist Master Changxiao’s divine abilities are formidable; we must be careful.”

Li Ximing nodded. After a moment, Li Zhouwei arrived on a beam of light and bowed to them both. Only then did Li Ximing push the jade box forward, his brow furrowed.

“This is the congratulatory gift from the White Ye Immortal Sect.”

Both men scanned it with their spiritual sense, and their expressions darkened as they exchanged a look. Li Zhouwei’s voice was grave.

“Reporting to the Daoist Master, Wenhu is still stationed on the riverbank. He has not been recalled to the White Ye Mountain Gate and continues to manage affairs from his cave. This means either the emissary knew nothing, or they have something they feel confident relying on.”

Li Xizhi fell silent for a breath. Seeing that Li Ximing remained quiet, he, as the eldest of the ‘Xi’ generation, spoke with careful deliberation.

“I heard that Situ Ku of the Golden Tang Gate is still at the Mount Qingdu Water Cave. Did the Golden Tang Gate send anyone?”

“They did not,” Li Zhouwei replied grimly. “Situ Mo is a ruthless and cruel man. He won’t care about Situ Ku’s life. Unless you drag Situ Ku to his doorstep, he will continue to play dumb and pretend such a person doesn’t exist.”

Li Xizhi continued his analysis. “The matter with the Golden Tang Gate is still unresolved, and their backer, the Golden Feather Sect, has shown no intention of mediating. The White Ye Immortal Sect is also north of the river and clearly in league with the Golden Tang Gate. Our clan has no foundation in the north. A mighty dragon cannot suppress a local serpent, and Daoist Master Yehui is by no means weak.

“That is the first issue. Second, regardless of Daoist Master Changxiao’s motives, the Changxiao Gate is now our enemy. He is far more terrifying than the White Ye Immortal Sect. He makes no overt moves, but who can guess what venomous schemes he is plotting? Our clan must not act rashly.”

Li Zhouwei glanced at Li Ximing, now Daoist Master Zhaojing, who gave a slight nod.

“What you say is wise, brother…”

Li Ximing paused, then went on. “That man, Duche, is clever. He knew not to enter the banquet hall. Had he shamed me in front of everyone, he would have forfeited his life. I also deliberately received him here on Gardenia Scenery Mountain, away from the main island. Seeing him alone was a way to prevent our clan from suffering public humiliation.”

“But…” Li Ximing sighed heavily. “All of this is merely a stalling tactic. Changxi is on the verge of death. Yehui and Changxiao are in no hurry; they are simply wary of a final, desperate counterattack from him. The moment he dies, the Profound Peak Gate will become a critical vulnerability, and they will find it easy to move against us.”

Li Xizhi was alarmed, his brows knitting together. “So the rumors were true… How much longer does he have?”

Li Ximing exhaled slowly. “He was vague, but it seems to be less than three to five years.”

“That’s no time at all!” To a Foundation Establishment cultivator, three to five years could pass in a single session of secluded cultivation. The news weighed heavily on Li Xizhi. “And the Profound Peak Gate wishes to entrust themselves to our clan… That makes everything even more difficult. We would have to defend the northern riverbank while also managing the untamed wilderness and the Profound Peak Gate.”

Li Xizhi raised no objection to helping. Years ago, when he had mistakenly wandered into dragon territory, it was the Profound Peak Gate that had covered for him. He was merely overwhelmed by the pressure. “We cannot abandon the north bank. The territory of the Floating Cloud Cave must remain under our control.”

All three of them understood the implications. If the Li clan retreated from the north bank of the river, the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion would immediately attempt to encroach upon the northern shore of Moongaze Lake. The combined pressure from Changxiao and Yehui would be immense.

‘The northern shore must not be threatened.’

A Purple Mansion clan that couldn’t even hold the lands of a single prefecture would become a laughingstock. And the Azure Pond Sect, the Li clan’s nominal superior, would likely delight in such a spectacle. The Si family was desperate to see the Li clan humbled, to force them to come begging for aid once more. If that happened, the entire dynamic would change.

The Li clan was not the Xiao clan. Xiao Chuting had achieved the Purple Mansion Realm through a Life Divine Ability, his power was indispensable during the demon calamity, and he was an exceptionally formidable figure in his own right. Thus, he had no lingering concerns and was able to completely sever his clan’s subordinate ties to the Azure Pond Sect. Li Ximing, despite his breakthrough, had left a path of retreat open and had not made a clean break. Li Xizhi had not left the Azure Pond Sect either. Their status was ambiguous; nominally, they were still an Azure Pond clan.

But if they were to ask the Azure Pond Sect for help, that nominal status would become a solidified reality. They would truly become vassals.

A moment of silence fell over the mountain. Li Xizhi finally asked, “Did Daoist Master Chuting give any instructions?”

Li Ximing chose his words carefully. “The Daoist Master hinted that I could sever ties with the Profound Peak Gate. That might not have been his true opinion—perhaps it was a test. But judging by the situation, he never takes sides. It already seems he intends to stay out of this.”

He lowered his voice. “Unless our clan aligns with either the Golden Feather Sect or the Hengzhu Immortal Dao… But how is siding with Golden Feather any different from bowing to Azure Pond? And Hengzhu is far to the south. At best, we could form an alliance, but they have no shortage of enemies themselves.”

Unless it was an absolute last resort, Li Ximing would never consider aligning with one of the three great sects. He poured tea for them and sighed. “Once these three to five years are up, our situation will become dire.”

Beside them, Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow and clasped his fist. “Reporting to the Daoist Master… in my humble opinion, while Yehui and Changxiao are waiting for Daoist Master Changxi to perish, we cannot simply sit by and await our doom.”

“Why don’t we take advantage of the time Daoist Master Changxi has left? We can settle matters north of the river first. We can strike a heavy blow against the Golden Tang Gate and the White Ye Immortal Sect, and establish a firm foothold on the north bank.”

Li Ximing nodded. “I understand your meaning. But that would only amount to seizing most of the territory of the two Secret Diffusion sects. Can we truly inflict any substantial losses on the White Ye Immortal Sect? As for the Golden Tang Gate, with the Golden Feather Sect behind them, we can only demand compensation. We cannot act rashly against them.”

“And when Changxi dies, how would we defend such a vast territory? We would lose it in the blink of an eye.”

Li Xizhi remained silent, but Li Zhouwei’s voice rang with conviction.

“Daoist Master! Every step forward we take today is another step we can retreat tomorrow! Even if the lands we conquer fall back into the hands of the White Ye Immortal Sect, they will be stripped bare—a wasteland. That is far better than leaving those resources in their hands.”

Li Zhouwei’s tone grew more intense. “Furthermore, the situation is gradually worsening for our clan. Right now, it is the White Ye Immortal Sect that desires stability, while it is our Li clan that needs change. Chaos creates opportunity. In a conflict lasting three to five years, who knows what new variables might emerge?”

“Whatever the future holds, it is better than doing nothing, clinging to the Floating Cloud Cave territory and waiting for death!”

Li Ximing exchanged a look with his brother and then nodded decisively.

“Good.”

He stood, his expression resolute.

“The affairs north of the river are entirely in your hands, Minghuang! If you require anything, do not hesitate to ask. I will go and see Changxi. We hold leverage over Wenhu, and there is much we can accomplish!”

He gave his sleeve a gentle shake, and an array of jade boxes, stone caskets, and various spiritual items materialized on the table. “These are the congratulatory gifts from the various families. There are several Dharma Artifacts among them. Minghuang, take them and distribute them to Chenghui and the others.”

Li Zhouwei offered his thanks, collected the items, and was about to depart when Li Xizhi produced two jade boxes of his own. “The gift from the Azure Pond Sect is the recipe for the Essence Gathering Pill, which is with the Daoist Master. These two Dharma Artifacts are from my personal collection. They aren’t particularly precious, but they can be put to good use by the clan.”

After Li Zhouwei had respectfully accepted them and departed, Li Xizhi sighed with regret. “It is a pity that I am, after all, a peak master of the Azure Pond Sect. The sect will not permit me to act freely.”

Li Ximing waved his hand dismissively. “You have been wronged, brother. You still have to appease the Si family. Besides… if we were to sever ties with the Azure Pond Sect, when Chi Buzi eventually investigates, the Si and Lingu families would surely shift all the blame onto us. They could destroy our clan without any compunction. It is necessary to maintain this nominal connection for now.”

His expression then turned solemn. “There is something else I must tell you, brother. And this matter is of the utmost importance.”

Li Xizhi’s face grew serious as well, and he leaned in as Li Ximing spoke.

“Yang Tianya broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm decades ago! He has been concealing it all this time.”

Li Xizhi was stunned, looking up in utter disbelief. Li Ximing quickly recounted the entire incident involving the emissary from the Underworld. Li Xizhi listened, lost in thought, and after a long silence, he finally spoke.

“The Yang clan’s ambitions are vast indeed.”

Simply knowing that Yang Tianya had long been a Purple Mansion cultivator was enough for Li Xizhi to connect the dots. From the feathered robe given to him by Yang Xiao’er that had saved his life on multiple occasions, to the talisman from Yang Ruizao that had made Tuoba Chongyuan hesitate, and even the marriage negotiations between the Yuan and Yang families and the sudden shift in the Chi family’s situation—everything now cast faint, interlocking shadows.

“I understand,” Li Xizhi said.

Seeing that his brother grasped the situation, Li Ximing said no more on the topic. Li Xizhi quickly moved on. “Which Daoist Masters do you plan to visit?”

This was a delicate issue, but Li Ximing was prepared. “The first, naturally, is Daoist Master Yuanxiu. The second… I must go see Senior Xiao. As for the third… I find myself in a difficult position.”

Li Xizhi looked surprised. “Senior Tu Longjian…”

Li Ximing shook his head. “Daoist Master Chuting said he does not wish to be involved. I would not be able to see him even if I went.”

Li Xizhi immediately understood and began to list the options. “There is no need to visit the Profound Peak Gate; Changxi no longer cares for such formalities. The Snow Wings, Changxiao, and Purple Smoke Gates are out of the question. That leaves the Sword Gate, Golden Feather, Hengzhu, and Xiukui.”

Visiting the Golden Feather and Hengzhu sects was a dilemma. To visit one would be a great offense to the other. Visiting Golden Feather would anger Hengli, while visiting Hengzhu would offend Tianque. Yet, on the surface, both sects were on good terms with the Li clan.

“Tianque and Hengli are not easily fooled. Visiting the other sects would inevitably breed resentment…”

Li Ximing added, “I could, in fact, pay a visit to the Sword Gate. A record of our own senior’s sword intent is inscribed on their sword stele. If I go under the pretext of paying my respects to his legacy, it would not seem like a perfunctory gesture.”

Li Xizhi was not well-versed in these Purple Mansion Realm political intricacies and offered no further comment, only reminding him, “Uncle Yuanqin is here. We must go and see him.”

***

On Pingya Island, the grand hall was bathed in brilliant light. Li Xuanxuan, dressed in a simple blue-grey robe, sat in the main seat as two figures entered from outside.

The first was a woman at the Foundation Establishment realm who appeared to be in her forties. She still possessed a graceful charm, dressed in a white Dharma robe and adorned with a cyan jade pendant. Her face held the remnants of youthful beauty, though she had deliberately allowed herself to age naturally without using her cultivation to preserve her appearance.

Behind her stood a man in black robes, his bearing heroic. He was also at the Foundation Establishment realm, and while his cultivation was not particularly profound, his gaze was piercingly sharp.

The woman curtsied gracefully.

“Hemian greets you, elder brother.”

Li Xuanxuan hurried to help her up, his eyes filled with emotion as he looked at them. “Sister-in-law… we never had the chance to meet all those years ago…”

“Yuanqin pays his respects to Great Uncle!”

Li Yuanqin was exceedingly polite toward the elderly Li Xuanxuan, who quickly helped him to his feet. He studied the young man, his eyes growing red.

“You look so much like him…”

It was unclear whether he meant Li Xuanfeng or Li Xiangping. Li Yuanqin listened in silence.

“Of the four branches of our family, the youngest uncle’s has long been vacant,” Li Xuanxuan continued earnestly. “Yuanqin, now that you have returned, there is no need to leave again. Take your place, fill the gap in the next generation, and continue your grand-uncle’s line.”

Li Yuanqin hesitated, but Ning Hemian spoke up, her voice gentle.

“Elder brother, my own foolish brother brought about his own demise, and his entire line was extinguished with him, not a single descendant left. Fortunately, my cousin Ning Heyuan left behind an orphan, but he is not yet capable. The Ning family relies entirely on Qin’er for support. At this time… it is truly not possible for him to return.”

Li Xuanxuan was left speechless. He could not refute her words. Furthermore, Li Yuanqin had grown up within a sect and held little affection for the Li clan; he had no personal desire to stay.

As Li Xuanxuan hesitated, a ray of light pierced the hall from outside, resolving into two men—one in a white and gold Daoist robe, the other in a feathered robe shimmering with the colors of sunset. They came to a stop in the hall.

Li Yuanqin immediately clasped his hands to bow.

“Greetings, Daoist Master Zhaojing, and Pavilion Master of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion.”

Li Xizhi would not permit him to bow and helped him up. Having overheard the exchange, he tried to persuade him. “Uncle, the youngest branch of our family is empty. We need you to support it. If our late grand-uncle could see this, he too would wish for you to remain with the clan.”

Li Ximing took up the plea, his tone serious. “This junior is about to visit Daoist Master Yuanxiu. Uncle, you only need to say the word, and you need not worry about anything else.”

Despite their words, Li Yuanqin replied with unwavering respect. “The clan has Daoist Master Zhaojing and the Pavilion Master, as well as Minghuang, Chenghui, and the other Daoists. It is as stable as Mount Tai. Meanwhile, my mother’s clan, the Ning family, is on the verge of collapse, and she cannot support it alone. I am afraid I cannot return. Please forgive me.”

His expression was firm, and Ning Hemian added her own pleas. Li Xuanxuan could only sigh in resignation as he saw them out.

Li Ximing waited in the courtyard. Sometime later, Li Xizhi returned on a cloud of rosy mist.

“That the four branches cannot be made whole,” he lamented, “will likely be a great regret for our grandfather.”

“When Uncle has an heir, we can bring one back—even a mortal child will do,” Li Ximing said. “The coming years will not be peaceful for our clan. It may be for the best that he remains in the Azure Pond Sect.”
