# Chapter 1283: The Yang Hall

After seeing Xiao Chuting off, Li Zhouwei descended alone toward the center of the island, passed through the gloomy main hall, and with a single step that changed all scenery, arrived in the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

The balanced aura of yin and yang emerged once more, yet a subtle change had come over Li Zhouwei’s mood.

'He seeks only a single concealment.'

Li Zhouwei’s Dao-Profundity was immense; Xiao Chuting had not spoken in detail, but Li Zhouwei already grasped the gist of the matter in his heart.

'The Supreme Yin is in concealment; as long as the life-mandate endures, however tenuously, there will always be a chance for a comeback...'

'A balance of yin and yang... a balance of yin and yang... It is not just the Supreme Yin, but the Supreme Yang as well.'

A brief thought surfaced in his mind, but he did not dwell on it, his train of thought already shifting.

'Four years.'

Gongsun Bei's strength could not compare to Qi Lanyan's; his temperament was resolute, and the distinction between his demonic and Buddhist aspects was not as clear as Vast Cicada's, so as he progressed, the gains from him gradually diminished.

Even so, the feedback from Gongsun Bei was far beyond what the likes of the Merciful One could provide; surging divine ability and dharma power constantly spiraled within his body, suppressed within his sea of qi for several days, circling around the brilliantly radiant immortal foundation of the Imperial Observation of the Origin.

'In terms of cultivating an immortal foundation, the Imperial Observation of the Origin is no more difficult than the Crimson Severing Arrowhead, yet conquering a region and commanding cultivators is a much more pleasant prospect than the imagery of returning severely wounded...'

'What's more, I have cultivated this immortal foundation before, and the effects of the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill are far superior to those for the previous divine ability, the Crimson Severing Arrowhead!'

By Li Zhouwei's estimation, having returned from this great victory, his Imperial Observation of the Origin was already shining brightly; after consuming the pill and entering seclusion with the aid of Talisman Qi, he would only need about a year.

'With the remaining three years, it will certainly be enough for one path of the Purple Mystery!'

Having returned from Luoxia, his exchange with the Tao clan still fresh in his mind, Li Zhouwei’s thoughts deepened.

"The Tao clan contributed a great deal this time; their few demands cannot be ignored, and there is also an old Spiritual Treasure within the Great Ling River, which offers some room for negotiation."

Xuanwei’s position was different; if the Tao clan wanted to enter, they would almost certainly have to invite that sword cultivator from their clan...

'In that case, I might as well allow him to seize the White Curtain Old Dream Tower. The Tao clan already has one Spiritual Treasure in their possession; with two on a single person, and him being at the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, it wouldn't be unreasonable for him to hold off a Great Daoist Master.'

According to Li Zhouwei's judgment, since Golden Oneness knew that he, Li Zhouwei, was going, they would almost certainly dispatch a Great Daoist Master, while the Touba family would send at least one mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator... and it wasn't impossible they would send a Great Daoist Master as well.

'The trouble is that Buddhist cultivators will certainly not pass up on an ancient Dao repository like the Great Ling River. Yang Ruiyi is holding the fort in Luoxia and Jiang Toushou cannot be easily moved, but people from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and the Lotus Temple will definitely come.'

Among the Seven Aspects, the Lotus Temple was closest to the immortal cultivators, while the Great Adoration Dharma Realm was closest to the ancient Buddhists. Both sects were adjacent to Luoxia; one coveted treasures of the Immortal Dao, and the other favored ancient relics, and both were watching with predatory intent.

'From the looks of it now, the Great Adoration Dharma Realm's indifference to the Great Song's northern advance may well be a ploy to let the wolf into the house. Be it Luoxia or the Great Ling River, as long as they can make two tigers fight, there will be an opportunity for the Buddhist cultivators to profit...'

'If I were a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator surrounded by a pack of wolves, even if they were wary of each other, they would inevitably swarm forward to get a share when faced with the Pit Water inheritance.'

Li Zhouwei gave a cold laugh and lightly waved his sleeve. Two jade vials appeared before him; one pill shone with a heavenly light, while the other roiled with True Qi.

'I still need to strike a heavy blow as a deterrent, only then will they scatter in disarray, unable to conspire.'

...

On the northern shore, wind and snow fell ceaselessly. Several peaks were buried in white, and a man in crimson robes stood atop a summit, gazing into the distance.

Flames of light danced around his body like a scorching fire, silently melting the falling snow before it could reach him, yet it did not affect the mountain in the slightest. The ice and snow beneath his feet remained perfectly solid, appearing like jade in the glow of the flames.

Li Jiangqian said nothing, his gaze peculiar as his lips moved slightly.

'Tears of red drift over half the river; I become a lonely ghost.'

This Daoist Master strode quietly, the snow and ice crunching softly beneath his feet. His face was expressionless, and after his lips stilled, he appeared to be gritting his teeth.

'An old father wishes to strike his son dead, but alas, an immortal guards the gates of the underworld.'

His gaze was placid, yet he began to walk unconsciously through the vast white snow.

A spring breeze swept through the silent wilderness. On the northern horizon, flames blazed with a faint purple light as a woman, riding a Cinnabar wind, arrived gracefully late. Li Jiangqian’s troubled thoughts vanished, and a smile appeared on his face.

"Sister, your timing is perfect."

Li Que'wan looked travel-worn. She glanced briefly at the northern vista before asking:

"King Wei..."

"He has entered seclusion."

Hearing this answer, Li Que'wan secretly nodded and said,

"The Dantai..."

"They haven't sent anyone."

Li Jiangqian nodded.

"Then they intend to make use of us."

Li Que'wan breathed a sigh of relief and then said with a smile,

"I just got back. Things are lively over at Qusi; Daoist Master Kuang Yu has come out of seclusion. She was so warm, holding my hand and talking for a long time. She even asked about grand-uncle—if his great pill weren't unfinished, he would have gone too."

Upon hearing Kuang Yu’s name, Li Jiangqian let out a muffled laugh, and then listened as his sister continued,

"As it happened, Daoist Master Liaoluo also came out of seclusion... I only delivered the two Spiritual Artifacts and discussed them in detail. The only regret... was not getting to see that Great Daoist Master."

Li Jiangqian laughed.

"That Daoist Master cultivates Converging Water; it wouldn't be right to ask him to forge artifacts, would it."

The woman nodded in disappointment.

"I thought of that too. I just wanted to ask for his perspective, hoping for that Great Daoist Master's help... I didn't expect Senior Liaoluo to ask around, only to find that he's already in seclusion and cannot be asked to help for the time being..."

"He said he could help me trade for items related to the Whole Pill, but for the matter of artifact refinement, it would be best to find a Whole Pill or Metal Virtue cultivator. At the very least, someone who cultivates True Fire or Mansion Water would be suitable."

"No wonder you were back so quickly."

Li Jiangqian had estimated she would be gone for quite some time. He pondered for a moment, then frowned.

"Troublesome... A Whole Pill cultivator is out of the question. I've only heard of a Daoist Master Dao Mian, and he's no master of refinement. As for Metal Virtue... that's usually the Golden Feather Sect. Even the most famous refinement master of True Fire is one of theirs."

"Actually, the Hengzhu would be even better, as they are close to the Whole Pill path, but unfortunately the Hengzhu Immortal Dao has already secluded itself."

This was truly rather awkward—Li Que'wan needed the Golden Feather Sect's help, but they were bound to clash with them at the Great Ling River... and there was no telling how that fight would turn out.

Li Jiangqian also frowned.

"But refining an artifact takes three to five years at a minimum. If we can handle this before any conflict arises, it would be for the best. If we run into trouble later and offend some Daoist Masters, it will be even more difficult to ask for their help."

The two exchanged a look and fell silent. Li Que'wan said,

"There is a Dingyang Zi in Qize who cultivates 'Upper Shaman,' which is considered close to Whole Pill. He is also a capable figure, but unfortunately, he is in Western Shu, and it's somewhat risky to go there now..."

"Let's make some inquiries first, and gather spiritual resources on our end in the meantime."

Li Jiangqian pondered for a moment.

"Actually, there's also the north... the True Fire Great Daoist Master, Gao Fu. This Valiant King is extremely famous, but travel to his domain is inconvenient, which is also a problem."

Li Que'wan could only postpone the matter for now. As they spoke, the purple fire blazing from the north grew ever more brilliant, dyeing the horizon a hazy purple and causing great numbers of cultivators to stop and watch.

In the eyes of these two Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters, however, it was a different sight entirely. The Great Void trembled as if boiling, and Li Que'wan couldn't help but exclaim in admiration,

"Cultivation Transcendence is truly on another level! With a single divine ability, he can cause a phenomenon in the Great Void on par with the clash of ordinary Great Daoist Masters!"

Li Jiangqian, however, rode the fire forward and called out with a laugh,

"Daoist Friend Kuang! We've troubled you!"

Kuang Hong emerged, riding on a beam of light. He wore a guilty expression and gave a meticulous salute before speaking,

"Your Highness is too kind! This formation is quite old and not easily controlled by Cultivation Transcendence. The spiritual atmosphere is different after crossing the river, which caused the delay... Thankfully, it was the Vast Profound Suspended Void; otherwise, it would have been delayed by half a year..."

When Li Zhouwei had made the arrangements, he had given him two to three months. Kuang Hong had gritted his teeth and accepted, but now, nearly four months had passed. He could not escape the blame, but Li Jiangqian shook his head and said,

"It's no matter. A month earlier or later makes no difference."

The three members of the Li family had discussed the landing site for this hall in detail. They had considered the northern shore, Gardenia Scenery Mountain, the western shore, and even the southern shore, but in the end, they ultimately chose another location.

'Gardenia Scenery Mountain would have been an excellent choice, as it already possesses Bright Yang... but the place where this hall lands will not only be used for pill refinement; it is bound to have other purposes...'

The Li family had many secrets. Both Li Jiangqian and Li Ximing hoped for a foothold where they could discuss confidential matters. Once the hall landed, there would be more divine abilities active on the lake, and Gardenia Scenery Mountain would have to be ceded to Purple Mansion Realm cultivators...

As such, Gardenia Scenery Mountain, being so close to the Li family's ancestral lands on the southern shore, became a somewhat insecure option.

'The northern shore is mountainous, but it is covered in snow year-round. Its earth veins are scattered, and its pines and cypresses are incompatible with Molten Fire. Furthermore, it faces the great river and is vulnerable to threats. The western shore has many fire veins, but lacks great mountains, making it difficult to gather spiritual qi.'

'That only leaves the Milin Mountains.'

The eastern shore controlled many smaller family clans and also faced the river, maintaining a moderate distance from both the lake province and the southern shore. Stationing one or two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators there would make it convenient to send aid in any direction.

'As the only great mountain in Moongaze Lake, the Milin Mountains are worthy of the Molten Fire. Our gains have been plentiful; if there is anything left over after creating the Great Void mystic realm, depending on the situation, we might even be able to set up a formation here...'

The two accompanied him all the way to the skies above the Milin Mountains. The cultivators and common folk below had long since been evacuated. A hint of anticipation appeared in Li Jiangqian's eyes as he said with a smile,

"Sister, please watch. I'm going to take control of the hall."

Indeed, this Governing Yang Hall was completely different from any other. As the Wei Kingdom's last remaining great hall in Luoxia, Li Zhouwei had easily reclaimed it by virtue of his Bright Yang mandate, gaining full control before handing it over to Li Jiangqian and Kuang Hong.

If not for this, Kuang Hong would not have been able to move the hall here. This hall, much like the Spiritual Artifact in Cui Jueyin's hands, could merge with the Wei Kingdom's Profound Foundation and connect with the earth veins, allowing the Li family to preserve it in its entirety!

'In the future, once we acquire the mystic realm, this Governing Yang Hall can naturally be placed within it! It is only a pity that those two divine generals were formed by a secret art connected to the Wei Kingdom's Profound Foundation... they are about to dissipate...'

Li Jiangqian stepped upon the flames and entered deep into the hall. His gaze shifted, sweeping over the characters inscribed on the floor before he looked up. His eyes instantly lit up, and he sighed in admiration,

"What a fine dharma robe!"

Without the slightest hesitation, he immediately raised his hand and gave a gentle tug, as if grasping something from thin air. Then, he suddenly put forth his strength and yanked hard,

"Hummm!"

In the blink of an eye, a bronze disk the size of a heart-guard mirror appeared in his palm!

The disk was divided into five sections, each with twelve notches, and its center was hollow. The light of the Bright Yang and the qi of the Molten Fire continuously converged within it, and all the firelight was shrouded by a heavenly radiance, resembling a blooming crimson flower and creating a magnificent sight!

Li Jiangqian had no time to examine it closely. The instant he grasped the formation disk, a faint sound reached his ears.

"Crack."

The great hall floating above the Milin Mountains shuddered violently. A subtle hum enveloped the entirety of Moongaze Lake, and in an instant, it escalated into an increasingly piercing vibration. Many cultivators felt as if they had gone deaf; the sounds and colors of the world receded, leaving only this endless drone.

Hazy, near-white flames erupted from the main hall, surging along its corridors and bursting forth from all directions. They shot toward the sky, becoming a blazing inferno above and an earthly fire below, causing vision to distort between heaven and earth.

Li Que'wan had been waiting for a long time, her divine ability quietly observing the Great Void. Her eyes suddenly lit up as she activated her power, locking onto an invisible point in space.

"Tchhh!"

The spot seemed empty, yet her strike caused a shower of sparks to erupt. She activated Awaiting the Supreme Divine and instantly seized the object, only then seeing an invisible fire burning brightly, flowing with a crystal-clear luminescence.

Molten Fire!

The Li family had long suspected that this person possessed Molten Fire. When Molten Fire is concealed, it either hides in the Great Void or in some corner of the mortal world, making it extremely difficult to find!

The Li family possessed the Spirit Probe, so Li Que'wan was naturally not afraid of losing it, but she still had to put on an act. Activating her divine ability now, she found that Awaiting the Supreme Divine was faintly attracted to this fire, hooking it tightly.

Seeing this, a look of delight appeared on Li Que'wan's face.

'Awaiting the Supreme Divine possesses the virtue of nurturing. Since this thing can resonate with it, it must also have the virtue of creation. I suspect... it's used for either pill or artifact refinement!'

Li Que'wan had never forgotten that Li Ximing had lost the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire because of her. Although this new item was also obtained by Li Zhouwei, as long as it was usable, she hoped Li Ximing could at least have a suitable tool to use first.

While she intercepted the flame, the great hall only withstood the spectacle of the collapsing divine ability for a single breath before it dissolved into a pale white radiance and drifted away, gathered into Li Jiangqian's hand!

The Molten Fire burst out from the hall.

Strangely, after the surging, uncontrolled Molten Fire burst from the hall, the divine phenomenon that had contained it also collapsed abruptly with the hall's disappearance. The residual aura scrambled to pour into the ground, becoming a perpetually boiling fire vein that bored deep into the earth.

"A Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master of the Wei-Li bloodline, after all!"

Li Jiangqian maintained his divine ability, looking somewhat disheveled as he patted the invisible flames from his body. But in his hand, he already clutched the robe.

The bright, crimson glow of the Supreme Yang on the robe illuminated his face. The delight in Li Jiangqian's eyes was thick as his other hand put away the bronze disk and seized an object from within the invisible, blazing fire.

It was a fist-sized, hollow stone ring interwoven with purple and red!

'It's none other than the storage artifact of the Marquis of Yincheng!'
