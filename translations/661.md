# Chapter 661: Stirring the Waters

After a few words were exchanged, a soft clap of thunder echoed through the air, and a woman strode into the hall. At her entrance, everyone rose to their feet. Shen Yanqing hurried forward and spoke gently. 

“It has been many years, Senior!”

Shen Yanqing was already aware of the grotto-heaven affair, so her smile lacked its usual warmth. Li Qinghong, however, wore a pleasant expression and nodded. 

“It has been some time.”

They ushered her to a seat. Shen Yanqing spoke softly, “Junior should have visited sooner, but I was delayed by various matters. With the chaos in Jiangbei, my family couldn't remain untouched. Now that the situation has stabilized, I came to see you.” 

She retrieved a jade box from her sleeve, placed it gently on the table, and said, “I’ve brought the Celestial Thunder Ritual I mentioned before. My family’s thunder arts originate from the Dao of the Northern Palace of Profound Thunder, one of the twelve great paths of the Zhou Era.”

Li Qinghong listened intently. “I assume the Thunder-Guiding Cloud-Anchoring Dao is not among them?” 

It was no secret that her family practiced the Thunder-Guiding Cloud-Anchoring Dao. Since the teaching came from the Yanyang Temple Palace, it was unlikely to be one of the ancient Zhou Era paths. As expected, Shen Yanqing shook her head. 

“It is not. The Thunder-Guiding Cloud-Anchoring Dao was established in a later age. The twelve thunder palaces were originally orthodoxies that monitored the good and evil of the world, but they have all been annihilated. Most of their teachings are lost, with only a few scattered techniques remaining.”

Beside them, Wei Danying sighed softly. “If the twelve thunder palaces still stood, the world would not have fallen into such a state.” 

Li Qinghong remained silent at her lament, but a strange expression crossed Shen Yanqing’s face. After a moment of hesitation, she replied, “My sect’s teachings hold the thunder palaces in high esteem… but according to the information my family has gathered over the years, the truth may be different.” 

Seeing their puzzled looks, Shen Yanqing lowered her voice. “According to the surviving records, the thunder palaces were tyrannical. Their thunder chariots patrolled the domains, and wherever their envoys passed, thunder would roar, killing thousands…” 

She paused before continuing. “Worse, the thunder palaces controlled the Human Tribulation. They would seek out cultivators on the verge of a breakthrough and strike them down with profound thunder. Surviving the agony was one thing, but those deemed to have heavy sins would lose their lives entirely… The world had long suffered under their yoke.”

“Later, when the lord of the Northern Palace ventured beyond the heavens, a great uproar ensued. From the lofty Purple Mansion cultivators down to the common people, no one wished to endure the oppression of the thunder palaces any longer. Nine of the twelve palaces fell… Cultivators stormed their halls, dragged out the thunder arts, and burned them together. Soon after, their entire tradition vanished without a trace.” 

Li Qinghong listened in silence. Wei Danying, who had only ever heard a completely different version of events within her sect, was visibly shaken. Shen Yanqing sighed. 

“The technique I brought was secretly preserved by a rogue cultivator of that era. In his records, he wrote that the fall of the thunder palaces was met with universal joy. They were called the Twelve Epochs of the Thunder Yoke that had shackled the world’s cultivators and common folk. With their fall came a new age of freedom—to think, to dream, to write, and to speak without fear.”

When she finished, a heavy silence filled the hall. The Li family members had known little about the thunder palaces, so they were less affected. But for Wei Danying, whose beliefs had been deeply ingrained, the revelation was hard to process. “How could this be?” she whispered. “I was only ever told that the thunder palaces patrolled the world and that no one dared to cultivate demonic arts under their watch… How did it become a story of shackling the world?” 

Shen Yanqing hadn’t come to debate the morality of the thunder palaces. Her goal was simply to give Li Qinghong a different perspective. “Just think of it as a rumor,” she said soothingly. 

She turned to Li Qinghong and smiled. “Senior, please take a look.” 

Li Qinghong accepted the jade box and took out the slip within. It did indeed record a celestial thunder ritual, one quite different from her own. In return, Li Qinghong passed over the Secret Primal Art of Purple Thunder. The thunder technique she had obtained from the Green Pine Temple’s grotto-heaven was the Empyrean Cloud Thunder-Questioning Method, which was only a cultivation art. This was the only comparable item she could offer. Shen Yanqing accepted it and said softly, “I hope I might have a chance to discuss the secrets of this art with you in detail, Senior.” 

Li Zhouwei took the hint and invited the others to a side hall, leaving the main hall empty. Shen Yanqing lowered her voice. 

“Senior, I’ve heard that several thunder-cultivating families from the North Sea, the Miao family from the South Sea, and those two Daoists from the East Sea… they are all preparing to head to the East Sea. Have you made arrangements?”

“I am aware,” Li Qinghong said, her expression serious. “I will be leaving soon.” 

“The dragon kin have been planning this for a century, spreading the technique like seeds. They view this matter with extreme importance, so of course, I must go.”

Hearing this, Shen Yanqing sighed inwardly. “Senior… the dragon kin cast a wide net. Many who cultivated the Thunder-Guiding Cloud-Anchoring Dao have perished prematurely, and the dragon kin never made a move. That’s why none of the great families could guess their intentions at first… It was only when traces of the grotto-heaven began to appear that they started to form theories.” 

“But now, you are one of the most outstanding practitioners of this path. You have no choice but to go.”

Seeing Li Qinghong’s calm demeanor, she continued, “My Daoist Master said… there will be another kind of battle inside the grotto-heaven. He urges you not to hold back…” 

Li Qinghong was surprised. “I understand that, of course. In a matter of life and death, how could I hold back?” 

Shen Yanqing said, “That includes Xi Zikang of the North Sea.” 

Li Qinghong’s eyebrows rose. It seemed she truly had no secrets from these Purple Mansion cultivators. Shen Yanqing’s voice was a mere whisper. “His mastery of thunder arts is exceedingly high, second to none among those entering the grotto-heaven. If you can eliminate him, you will remove a major threat.” 

Li Qinghong had some friendship with Xi Zikang. Though she was straightforward, she wasn’t so naive as to miss the meaning behind the Shen family’s—or rather, the Purple Smoke Gate’s—words. She was silent for a moment before speaking. “Ultimately, we must all enter the dragon’s belly. Why must it be like this? I am no fool; I have killed for treasures before… but those were enemies… From what I’ve seen, Xi Zikang is an upright young man who has treated me with warmth. I cannot bring myself to strike him down.” 

Shen Yanqing fell silent as well, then said through gritted teeth, “What if, once inside, life and death are no longer certain?” 

Slowly, Li Qinghong turned her head, tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear. Her silence deepened. “So you are asking me to choose,” she said softly. 

Shen Yanqing could only say that she wouldn’t dare presume. A gentle smile touched Li Qinghong’s lips as she shook her head. “If I cannot bring myself to do it, then I suppose I am destined to die.” 

Shen Yanqing pressed her lips together. “Junior understands…” 

She paused, then quickly changed the subject. “My master has already been reincarnated. If any news arises on the lake or within your clan’s territory, please inform us. We will reward you generously!”

Li Qinghong had expected this and nodded in agreement. Shen Yanqing then took her leave, heading to the side hall to rejoin her companions. Only then did Li Qinghong lean back in her chair, lost in thought. 

Her initial interpretation of Shen Yanqing’s words was that the Purple Smoke Gate wanted her to help ambush Xi Zikang before entering the grotto-heaven. But on second thought, that couldn’t be right. 

‘The Thunder-Guiding Cloud-Anchoring Dao has been spread far and wide. If everyone feared being targeted inside and started attacking others beforehand, how could the dragon kin sit idly by? If it were that simple, the Purple Mansion clans like the Miao would have acted long ago.’ 

‘This is a warning. She’s telling me that even if I ally with Xi Zikang… I must be wary. Even if I don’t ambush him, I should expect a confrontation in the end…’

She sat quietly for a time before Li Zhouwei entered from outside. He didn’t press her about her conversation with Shen Yanqing, instead saying gravely, “The time for the Jiangque generation’s first Talisman Seed reception is approaching. Since you have come out of seclusion, my lord, perhaps you would like to observe.” 

“Alright.”

Li Qinghong had become a woman of few words recently, and her reply was concise. 

Azure Pond Sect. 

In the main hall of Azure Pond Peak, magnificent turquoise bricks lined the floor and white mist coiled in the air. A young man leaned against the side of the immortal throne, his cyan robes adorned with shimmering gold patterns. The sword at his waist pulsed with spiritual qi.

His features were not exceptionally handsome, but his expression was full of youthful vigor. Beside the table, a woman in a colorful dress watched him with beautiful eyes.

“Sect Master…”

This was Chi Xunxiao, the young Sect Master of Azure Pond. He was looking down at a document on the table. When the woman spoke, he replied gently, “The recommendation I sent for my second uncle… has he responded?” 

At the mention of Chi Fubo, a flash of resentment crossed the woman’s eyes. “Lord Fubo did not approve it,” she said in a low voice. 

For Chi Xunxiao, a Sect Master, to not only be unable to appoint his own staff but to have a mere recommendation rejected by Chi Fubo was undoubtedly humiliating. Yet, he only smiled faintly. “Very well… It seems I was inconsiderate. Please bring the jade slip back. I will review my uncle’s comments and carefully reconsider before seeking his guidance again.” 

The woman sighed. “Yes, yes…”

Chi Xunxiao glanced at her, a smile in his eyes. “What is troubling you now?” 

“My lord wasn’t even asking for a significant post! Just a few minor positions… and Chi Fubo still refused! On what grounds? Who is the real Sect Master here…” 

She muttered for a moment before Chi Xunxiao shook his head. “I am still too young and often fail to consider things clearly. How can I blame my elder? I understand that Ning Hejing suffered overseas, but you cannot let your personal feelings cloud your judgment.” 

The woman immediately fell silent, wondering to herself, ‘Does he truly not understand, or is he just pretending?’

Just as they finished speaking, a disciple reported that Chi Fubo had arrived to see him. Chi Xunxiao immediately rose to greet him, walking all the way to the front of the hall. “Second Uncle, you’ve come!” he said respectfully. 

Chi Fubo walked in slowly. 

Years of holding power had stripped Chi Fubo of his youthful immaturity, and his expression was much calmer. Chi Xunxiao personally led him to a side seat and arranged the mat for him. “It has been too long, Secod Uncle!” he said with reverence. 

This display of respect was more than enough to satisfy Chi Fubo’s pride, and he found it difficult to maintain a stern face. He smiled. “The plan from a while ago has borne fruit. My agent on Fuchen Peak reports that Li Quantao has become increasingly restless and is venturing out more often… The Li family’s message must have arrived.” 

Chi Xunxiao nodded. “Young Uncle’s insight is profound… There has been no word from the Si Clan. Either the Li Clan cannot contact them… or they have tried and failed.” 

“Si Yuanli would never abandon the Li family,” Chi Fubo stated with conviction. “Don’t be fooled by his cunning and patience. He is merely riding the tide of the situation. His past actions show he possesses a soft heart… He is a sword cultivator, after all, incapable of resorting to any means necessary.” 

“If not for that, Li Xuanfeng and the others would never have persuaded him back then. When you commit to something, you commit. There is no room for heeding others in such a great undertaking… much less is there room for failing to reassure the Li family.”

A hint of joy appeared on Chi Xunxiao’s face. “Could it be… that Daoist Master Si is truly in seclusion, and Si Yuanli is acting on his own?” 

“It probably makes no difference whether he is in seclusion or not… He fears our Daoist Master.”

Chi Fubo took a deep breath, studying him thoughtfully for a moment before waving a hand to take his leave. Chi Xunxiao saw him all the way out of the hall. Chi Fubo smiled as he departed, but his expression grew heavier once he was out of sight. 

He walked with his hands behind his back, a headache brewing. ‘Of all things, he had to be this clever… this courteous… Even I am starting to find this difficult…’

Chi Xunxiao’s behavior had surprised everyone in the sect. The young Sect Master not only publicly supported Chi Fubo and did his utmost to mediate the conflict between the Chi and Ning factions, but he also proved to be an understanding, magnanimous, and wise leader. Over the past few years, his reputation within the sect had soared. 

Chi Fubo saw it all, and the awkwardness was his to bear alone. The recent appearance of Chi Buzhi in the East Sea was another source of mixed feelings. To put it nicely, Chi Buzhi was a Purple Mansion of their clan. To put it bluntly, he was an elder from the First Branch… 

His heart heavy, Chi Fubo forced a smile as he returned to his own hall, where a young man in black robes was waiting for him.

“Yuanqin.”

The plan to install Chi Xunxiao as Sect Master was slowly deviating from its original purpose, showing signs of becoming a very bad idea. But Chi Fubo was a discerning man. He showed no displeasure toward Li Yuanqin, the one who had proposed the scheme, and spoke amicably. “Have the others been giving you trouble?” 

Chi Fubo could see the truth, but not everyone in the Chi family could. The higher Chi Xunxiao’s reputation grew, the more resentful glares Li Yuanqin had to endure, both openly and behind his back. But Li Yuanqin simply replied calmly, “Brother Fubo, I have the information.” 

Chi Fubo understood and led him inside. They sat down at a table, and Li Yuanqin spoke in a low voice. “Ning Hejing has indeed colluded with Buddhist cultivators—a Dharma Master of the Void Path… He plans to scheme against Li Xizhi and Si Yuanli… The baleful light in the Earth Abyss has been thickening these past few days. Li Xizhi won’t be able to hide for much longer. The moment he leaves the abyss, Ning Hejing’s men will be waiting.” 

“The intelligence is limited, but I am certain he has a way to pin the blame on us. Lord Zhihu is still in the East Sea; I suspect he is the intended scapegoat.”

Chi Fubo was silent for a moment. “You mean…” 

“His schemes all lead to one goal: to provoke a complete breakdown between our clan and the Si Clan so that he can reap the rewards. That can only be achieved with bloodshed. Even if we can’t guess his exact method, it requires the death of either Li Xizhi, Si Yuanli, or Lord Zhihu.” 

Chi Fubo’s silence deepened, a chill creeping into his heart. ‘Ning Hejing alone couldn’t stir up such a storm! I fear some other Purple Mansion experts, unhappy to see the Chi and Si Daoist Masters staying out of the fray, are secretly fanning the flames to worsen their relationship.’ 

Li Yuanqin stared at him intently. “Yuanqin thinks the same. But it is precisely because a Purple Mansion expert is providing cover that even if Si Boxiu isn’t in seclusion, he would most likely be unable to divine this matter!” 

Chi Fubo narrowed his eyes. “What do you propose we do?” 

“Li Xizhi is difficult to kill, and any move against Si Yuanli would likely be detected. They will probably target Lord Zhihu first…” 

Chi Fubo’s expression did not change. “Oh? Should I recall him then?” 

Li Yuanqin shook his head. “In my view, it would be best to let Lord Zhihu die. We will wait quietly on the sidelines. The moment he is dead, we strike, capture Li Xizhi, and lock him away in the sect!” 

His tone was ice-cold. “As long as we frame him perfectly, the Daoist Master will have no grounds to object! We can use this to force Si Yuanli to hand over those positions he has been withholding, and then we release him from the sect!” 

Hearing the plan to sacrifice his own grand-uncle, Chi Fubo actually smiled slightly. “And what if he refuses?” 

Li Yuanqin replied respectfully, “Then the Li family will have no choice but to seek refuge with us to save Li Xizhi’s life. The remaining Ning family members will be ours for the taking, will they not?” 

“Excellent, excellent.”

Chi Fubo’s smile widened as he stared intently at him. “Since this plot is so well-concealed that it can even deceive Si Boxiu while he is in seclusion… a Purple Mansion expert must be involved…” 

“So how did you find out?”
