# Chapter 350: Receiving New Techniques

Li Yuanjiao watched as the three juniors composed their minds and began meditating. He then glanced at Li Xicheng, who sat at the side with his six senses still sealed off. He gently took his hand, leading him out of the courtyard and into a secluded area.

Li Yuanjiao gently tapped on the space between the boy's eyebrows to undo the mana seal on his senses, and the boy immediately awakened. Meeting his slightly confused gaze, Li Yuanjiao asked softly, "Xi Cheng, are you training with the spear?"

Li Xicheng obediently nodded. Li Yuanjiao continued asking, "Did Aunt Qinghong ever teach you the Wing Clipper Spear Technique?"

"No. Auntie said she took the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath so she couldn't pass it on to others, so she didn't teach me," Li Xicheng replied eagerly.

"I see," Li Yuanjiao replied thoughtfully. He retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve and handed it to the boy, explaining, "Your younger brothers are inheriting the clan's legacies. This Grade Three Wing Clipper Spear Technique shall be yours to inherit. Take the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath and memorize it here in this courtyard before you leave, and you must never speak of what has happened today!"

"Yes!" Li Xicheng immediately responded. He hastily took the spiritual oath and accepted the jade slip from Li Yuanjiao as if it were a precious treasure.

"Thank you, Second Uncle!"

Li Yuanjiao nodded then slowly exited the courtyard, closing the door behind him. The protective formation separating the inside from the outside hummed to life, and his expression betrayed a trace of complex emotions.

"At least we've compensated for it... We have no choice but to hide it from him..." he murmured with a sigh.

Li Yuanping, who had been waiting outside, shook his head slightly and replied, "The fewer he knows, the better. Apart from the family head and those who have received a talisman seed, no one else is allowed entry. This rule has been set long ago."

"You're right," Li Yuanjiao replied with a smile before continuing, "Still, it's a surprise that three of them received a seed... That's beyond our expectations. It's about time for us to check on the boys."

Li Xizhi guided the profound pearl according to the Reception Method's instruction. It descended through the twelve stories—his trachea—then settled at the Qihai acupoint. Instantly, warmth spread throughout his body and his sea of qi churned vigorously.

"This!"

As a direct descendant of the Li Family, Li Xizhi practiced the best Embryonic Breathing Realm technique in the family—the Supreme Jade Meridian Nourishment Technique. It was a neutral Grade Three technique that harmonized well with most qi cultivation techniques.

Despite the technique's minor drawbacks and potential lifespan reduction, the accelerated cultivation speed made it a worthwhile endeavor. Having dedicated many years to its practice, Li Xizhi had successfully condensed three Supreme Jade Spirit Chakras within his body, each glowing faintly with the luster of jade.

However, as the white pill entered his body, the two of the Spirit Chakras condensed by the Supreme Jade Meridian Nourishment Technique within his Qihai acupoint began to tremble slowly and gradually turned shiny...and brilliantly white.

The previously grayish sea of qi churned, gradually clearing under the white light, transforming into a clear and serene pool.

"W-What... immortal technique is this?!"

Among the six chakras of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, Li Xizhi had already condensed the Profound Scenery, Radiant Lure, and Celestial Whirl chakras. Now, the two of them within his sea of qi had transformed.

He hurriedly circulated his mana and examined the Celestial Whirl chakra in his Juque Court near his lungs. Indeed, it had turned bright white too.

Just as Li Xizhi marveled at such a phenomenon, an imposing and deep voice resounded in his mind.

"Here stands the disciple of the Li Family—who has forsaken his worldly attachments... To him, I bestow the Profound Light, initiating their journey in the path of Dao, transforming them from mere mortals to saints. They will begin with discipline and ultimately ascend to truth! I grant them a scroll of the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra, along with the Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual!"

Li Xizhi's mind was flooded with strange words and profound phrases, deeply imprinting themselves into his mind. He concentrated intently, maintaining focus for the time needed to burn a stick of incense before slowly opening his eyes.

The blurred scenery before him gradually sharpened into focus. Li Xizhi realized he was standing in a dim, mist-shrouded environment that seemed as ethereal as a celestial realm. Soft white mana lights bathed his surroundings, casting a gentle glow overhead.

Directly in front of him stood a tall, ancient stone platform that was adorned with intricate patterns and a dazzling light floating just above it.

"That's..."

A bluish-gray mirror hovered in the air, with wisps of moonlight flowing out of it and creeping up along his robes. Li Xizhi could not even register Li Yuanjiao's words. His gaze was completely fixated on the mirror above him as he gasped softly, "What's that, Father?"

Standing nearby, Li Yuanjiao solemnly replied, "There was once an immortal cultivator who underestimated this immortal object and attempted to capture it with his dharma artifact... He was swiftly reduced to nothingness by the Supreme Yin Profound Light, along with his artifact. If you do not fear death, you may continue gazing upon it."

Li Xizhi recoiled in shock and quickly averted his gaze, mumbling quietly but frantically, "Please forgive me!"

However, his excitement soon returned in a flash as he wondered aloud, "Is it a treasure?!"

"Perhaps even more."

Li Yuanjiao gently guided his eldest son to kneel beside him while waiting for the two younger boys to complete their reception of the Profound Pearl Talisman Seeds.

He continued in a hushed tone, "This immortal mirror has a long history, handed down through generations in our family. Anyway, what technique did you receive?"

Li Xizhi immediately understood his father's question and replied, "The Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual and..."

Observing Li Xizhi's astonished expression, Li Yuanjiao chuckled.

"I see you've realized that regardless of your previous Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivation technique, once the talisman seed enters your body, the chakras you have previously condensed will be instantly transformed into the Supreme Yin Chakras, aligning with the practice of that immortal sutra!"

Overwhelmed by this revelation, Li Xizhi was rendered speechless. After a good while, he shyly admitted, "I had thought the green and white immortal sword was remarkable enough... I never imagined our family harbored such a marvel! Even the rumored Frosty Absolute Sword of the Azure Pond Sect can't possibly be compared to this..."

While they were talking, Li Xijun and Li Ximing had already opened their eyes and looked on with wonder.

Li Yuanping approached and spoke to them warmly before his face beamed with happiness as he announced, "Brother, both of them have received cultivation techniques too!"

"Excellent!" Li Yuanjiao smiled joyfully but quickly lowered his voice and said, "We shouldn't be noisy here, let's talk outside."

————

In the much brighter side hall, two boys were writing furiously. Li Xizhi, the oldest and more skilled with his brush, had already finished transcribing the Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual.

"The immortal foundation that can be established by this Grade Three technique is known as Snow On Pine... This technique harnesses cold qi to control rain and snow, and the manual also includes a qi gathering technique. It seems quite impressive," Li Yuanjiao remarked, nodding as he finished reading the manual.

"The qi is to be gathered during the snowy season in the pine forest on a high mountain, under a cloudless moonlit sky. One can obtain a wisp of it in three months. Ten wisps make a portion," he added.

"That won't be a problem," Li Yuanping responded with a gentle nod, "Mount Yuting is high and snowy; it should be a suitable place to gather qi. I'll arrange for someone to plant the pine trees there as soon as possible."

"There's no need to hurry. The northern coastal peaks are abundant with pine forests. A trip there will be sufficient," Li Yuanjiao said, setting aside the wooden slip. "Moreover, establishing a pine forest will take time, even with the help of spells and techniques. Besides, we can't predict the challenges that may arise with this technique..." he added with a thoughtful gleam in his eyes.

Li Yuanping immediately understood the meaning behind Li Yuanjiao's words and nodded. As soon as they concluded their discussion, Li Xijun presented another wooden slip.

"The Golden Temple Radiant Origin Manual," he announced.

Li Yuanjiao picked up the transcribed manual from Li Xijun and read it carefully. After a moment, he raised an eyebrow in surprise and exclaimed, "A Grade Four technique?!"

He continued flipping through the pages eagerly, mumbling to himself in marvel.

"Excellent...excellent!"

Li Yuanping leaned over to read the manual, initially joyful until he noticed a small note in ink at the end. Their expressions suddenly changed. Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes as he said, "Recorded by Cui Mu from Zhaoyuan Immortal Mansion from Wei State of Central Plain? This is a legacy from Zhaoyuan Immortal Mansion from Wei State of Central Plain?!"

"Wei State?" Li Yuanping echoed, puzzled.

"I've heard of the northern powers like Yan State and Zhao State, but I've never heard of Wei State... let alone this Zhaoyuan Immortal Mansion. There's actually an immortal sect in the north..?"

Li Yuanjiao carefully placed the wooden slip on the desk. His heart was racing as he murmured, "Maybe this Wei State is an ancient territory from centuries past... That would explain why we've never heard of it. Seven hundred years ago when Buddhism was still confined to Mobei, Daoist sects dominated the Central Plain. There were reportedly over 172 states, Wei could have been one of them. If that's true, then it makes sense for immortal sects to exist in the Wei State..."

Li Yuanjiao had gotten this information from Xiao Guiluan. After all, the Xiao Family was an ancient immortal family with ancestors who hailed from the north. Naturally, they were more knowledgeable about the history of the north; in fact, they even had a few northern Dao techniques in their possession.

However, Xiao Guiluan was a concubine-born daughter of the direct lineage, with a status akin to those in the major sect of the Li Family. Now that she had been married into the Li Family, it was even more challenging for her to obtain such information.

Li Yuanjiao could barely contain his excitement while Li Yuanping was slightly taken aback by the revelation. He quickly connected the dots and said in a serious tone, "So... you mean to say that techniques similar to this nature might have already been lost? Doesn't that mean..."

Before Li Yuanping could finish his sentence by saying "Doesn't that mean we'll have a smooth ride ahead", he was interrupted by Li Yuanjiao's sigh.

"Let's not rush to conclusions. We should verify if there's indeed still an immortal sect active up in the north..." Li Yuanjiao said firmly.

Listening intently from the side, Li Xizhi's eyes flickered with curiosity. He hurriedly interjected, "The younger brothers have just begun their cultivation journey, and they will take at least ten years to reach the Qi Cultivation Realm... After I join the Azure Pond Sect, I can investigate Wei State and the Zhaoyuan Immortal Mansion on behalf of our family."

"Very well!" Li Yuanjiao praised, looking more at ease now. For years, the weight of Li Tongya's passing had burdened him, fearing he might fall short of his expectations. Now with a clear direction, he felt uplifted.

"It's a shame Uncle Xian is from a branch of the Xiao Family. Otherwise, Auntie could help us inquire more..." Li Xizhi remarked absentmindedly, his excitement evident as he glanced at the tiny script on the wooden slip.

However, Li Yuanjiao's expression turned stern as he interrupted sharply, "Zhi'er!"

Li Xizhi raised his head in surprise, noticing the fading smile on Li Yuanping's face as he gently explained, "Since your aunt has married into the Xiao Family, she is now one of them. Asking her to do something like that would put her in a difficult position!"

Li Xizhi, who had spent his childhood playing in the mountains, was extremely close to Li Qingxiao. Li Yuanping's words had taken him by surprise.

"I've been thoughtless," he admitted.

Li Yuanjiao looked at him, then sighed.

"Our family does not match theirs in status at present, having been a clan for just three generations. No matter how close we are as a family, we must tread carefully. We cannot impose undue burdens and end up souring familial ties..."

"I understand," Li Xizhi responded, cupping his fist respectfully. Li Xijun listened attentively to their conversation, his handsome face betraying a pensive expression.

Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao collected the wooden slips and glanced at Li Ximing, who was still scribbling furiously with sweat beading his forehead.

Li Yuanjiao was amused by such a sight and failed to suppress a chuckle. He walked up to the boy and asked warmly, "Why haven't you completed your writing yet?"

Li Ximing, looking slightly flustered, gestured to the stack of meticulously written wooden slips. He carefully dipped his brush into ink and replied, "Everyone else's entries are so short, but mine turned out so long-winded!"

His complaint drew chuckles from Li Xijun and Li Xizhi. Li Yuanjiao peered closer and saw the title on the slip—Introduction to Alchemy.

"Alchemy?!"

Li Yuanping and Li Yuanjiao exchanged surprised glances.

"How rare! This is the first time I've seen someone being bestowed an alchemy manual among the hundred arts of Immortal Cultivation..." Li Yuanping remarked.

As soon as he finished speaking those words, realization dawned on them. They simultaneously placed their hands on Li Ximing's body—one on his Qihai acupoint, the other on his throat.

"This is..."

The Li Family had never produced a skilled alchemist. After assessing Li Ximing for a moment, the two brothers had their suspicions.

Eventually, Li Yuanjiao chuckled and decided, "You can begin practicing with the manual. We'll send someone to the Xiao Family to invite Senior Yuansi over!"

Meanwhile in Yi Mountain City at the southern border...

A middle-aged man clad in leather armor stood silently atop the city wall, the biting cold wind whipping fiercely around him. His sharp eyebrows furrowed as he gazed down at the demon beasts gathering below him. His gray-black eyes, tired yet steady, betrayed no emotion.

He raised the golden longbow in his hands, taking a deep breath before a radiant golden light condensed between his hands, swirling and forming a golden-white arrow.

"Take this!"

Golden-white brilliance gleamed in his eyes as the arrow streaked through the sky like a falling star, slicing through the air and leaving a trail of dazzling light in its wake.

Whoosh!

A massive eagle, as large as a house and soaring in the sky, emitted a cry so piercing that it could crack gold and shatter stone. It flapped its wings desperately, attempting to ascend, but it was too late to evade.

Its shrill cry was abruptly silenced.

Watching the eagle plummet into the distant mountain forest, Li Xuanfeng lowered his bow and straightened up. The glint in his eyes dimmed once more as he turned back toward the city, retrieving a wineskin from his chest pocket and taking a small sip.

"Brother Feng... Your archery skills have improved yet again," Fei Yihe remarked. He was dressed in white as usual as he sat down beside him with his spear.

"That demon beast was at the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, yet you shot it down with just one arrow... You're probably not far from reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, right?" he asked in a hushed tone.

"Yes."

Li Xuanfeng nodded and leaned his longbow against the wall, its weight creating a loud thud that startled the surrounding crowd.

"I've reached the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm, and I am ready to pick a day to enter seclusion for the breakthrough," he announced, causing murmurs of approval and well-wishes from those who were gathered around.

Li Xuanfeng acknowledged them with a wave of his hand.

Fei Yihe smiled wryly and remarked, "Brother Feng, your talent is truly exceptional. If you were still on the lake, Yu Mugao and Yu Xiaogui would surely be troubled by your presence! It's a shame we're stuck in this hellhole, watching the Azure Pond Sect play games with the Demon King day in and day out..."

"If we win, the demons we killed belong to the Azure Pond Sect. If we lose, we become the demon's food and nourishment. We started with fifty-six defenders on these walls; now, we're down to just fifteen. Gambling for too long is bound to lead to losses," he continued.

Li Xuanfeng chuckled in response.

"You seem to fear death less and less now, to speak so openly and frankly about this."

Fei Yihe sighed wearily and said, "All of us are going to die sooner or later anyway. The Azure Pond Sect doesn't care what we think."

Li Xuanfeng gazed into the distance as he took another sip of wine thoughtfully.

"I heard that the Azure Pond Sect is gathering a group of formation masters to repair Yi Mountain City's formations?" he asked.

"Yes."

At the mention of this, the group of people was filled with joy and anticipation. Fei Yihe laughed out loud and continued, "It's been ten years since we've been isolated from the outside world... Finally, someone is coming! I wonder how much the outside world has changed over these years!"
