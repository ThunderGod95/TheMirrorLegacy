# Chapter 938: Profound Illumination's Doubts

Just as the two had reached an agreement, the silver door shimmered, and a cyan figure descended from within.

He was a middle-aged man, appearing to be in his mid-thirties. He had a wide face, large eyes, thick brows, and a heavy beard. His double brows seemed carved by a knife, deep and heavy, and his entire face was taut as steel. Beneath his beard, one could vaguely see a tightly clenched jaw.

He carried an axe on his back as large as a door panel. His eyes were like sharp swords, projecting a fierce and unyielding aura. His back was exceptionally broad, and as he entered, it was like a giant bear pushing aside the curtain. The whole pavilion instantly felt cramped.

"Daoist Friend Qingyan!"

The moment Liu Changdie saw him, his expression turned serious and respectful.

"You've arrived at the perfect time!"

With just one glance, Li Ximing could sense the formidable power of this man's divine ability. The Azure Manifestation Dao was exceptional; back in the day, Yuan Chengduan of the Yuan family had been a renowned and powerful figure in Jiangnan, and the last prodigy of the Yuan family worth mentioning.

Not only did this newcomer have an impressive background as a noble scion, but his Azure Manifestation had also formed into a divine ability. Whether in combat or in the subtleties of his powers, he was first-class. This was not someone to be offended. Li Ximing stood up straight.

"Greetings, Daoist Friend. I am Zhaojing of Moongaze Lake."

"You two have been waiting long!"

His voice was like a great bell, deep and resonant. His eyes fixed on Li Ximing for a moment before he replied.

"It has been a long time since I've seen a descendant of Wei."

Li Ximing cupped his hands in response. "The rumors in the four realms are exaggerated. I've made a fool of myself before you, Daoist Friend."

The man sat down at the table, his bulk taking up more than half the space and casting a heavy shadow over the tabletop. He spoke in a deep voice.

"In years past, I was searching for the Supreme Concealed Origin. I passed through Great Tazi, went north to Great Yona, and crossed the Western Sea. I met a Daoist Friend there, whose Daoist name was Yangya, from the Cui clan. He was not as orthodox as you."

Li Ximing had heard of Daoist Master Yangya. He was a Daoist Master from the Cui family who had moved to the Western Sea and had since lost most contact with the main branch. Liu Changdie poured him some tea and smiled.

"I've heard of him too... a handsome man, quite famous in the Western Sea. There are some amusing stories about him..."

At this, Qingyan let out two short laughs, pinching the tiny teacup in his massive hand. Liu Changdie immediately turned back to Li Ximing, grinning.

"He was just minding his own business, built himself a palace, and settled some of his descendants there. But the local tribesmen were ignorant. After seeing him act a few times, they began to prostrate and worship him, calling him the Sun God."

Li Ximing was speechless. Liu Changdie continued playfully, "That was a fatal problem! It scared him half to death, and he fled overnight. But the tribesmen below were clueless; you couldn't teach them. In the end, he had no choice but to accept a few princes from the local kingdoms, have them cultivate in his palace, and then send them back to educate their people. What a fiasco! I heard it caused such a stir that... cultivators from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition even went to question him."

Li Ximing was silent for a moment, his interest piqued. "Who might that have been?"

Liu Changdie hadn't been in the Purple Mansion Realm for long, and most of this gossip was secondhand. He could only look toward Qingyan. The burly man put down his cup with some stiffness, stroked his beard, and said, "It was Yuanwu."

"So it was him!"

Both Liu Changdie and Li Ximing had a moment of realization. Liu Changdie even laughed.

"Yuanwu also has a foul temper. It's no wonder he'd be bored enough to make the trip. He was even worse when he was young. By that time, he was old, so he was probably much easier to deal with."

Li Ximing nodded silently. After these few sentences, they were familiar enough. Liu Changdie got to the point.

"Daoist Friend Fuxun wishes to entrust the refining of this Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill to Zhaojing, and he also requests Daoist Friend Qingyan's assistance."

"He already spoke with me."

But the man's brows furrowed, and an inviolable, majestic aura instantly appeared on his fierce and stubborn face. He pressed his large palm onto the table and said gravely, "I told him already. This method is too extreme, too fierce. It violates the path of steady advancement and nurturing one's fortune. How can it be used so rashly? We noble scions cannot be compared to common demons and ghosts, yet this is the work of demons and ghosts! He cultivates Auspicious Qi, not..."

He was perhaps about to say 'Bright Yang,' but mindful of Li Ximing, he swallowed the rest of his words. His eyes lowered slightly.

"If he takes this pill and succeeds, the outcome will be mediocre at best, and it will still require him to nurture his steady fortune for decades. But if he fails, I fear he will suffer greatly."

Although the man looked ferocious, it was clear he truly regarded Fuxun as a close friend. Li Ximing listened from the side, nodding to himself.

'The Dragon-kin have always considered themselves separate from the demon race, a clan unto themselves. I suppose most of these noble scions think the same way. Their ancestors were all of Fruition Attainment status, so they can't be lumped in with demons, just like the White Qilin or the Luan Sparrow.'

'But why mention Bright Yang...'

Liu Changdie listened silently and then spoke in a low voice.

"Daoist Friend, you may not return to Poluoduo often. The Xiangxiong Kingdom has now been established on the Great Western Plateau, and the Western Lesser Yang's 'Right Eastern Extreme Star' is shining brightly... He has no choice but to advance!"

His expression was complicated. "Besides, his divine ability is upon him. For something like this, where even half a chance in the mortal world aligns with his path, to refine an Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill... and to have it be Zhaojing, a cultivator of Bright Yang, who refines it... is this not the will of heaven aligning perfectly? The moment Senior Fuxun saw Zhaojing... he was rejoicing in his own divine ability."

Hearing this, Qingyan's expression flickered with complexity. "I understand."

Qingyan said no more, slowly nodding. He and Li Ximing went out together. Liu Changdie escorted them to the nearby sea, handed an item to Qingyan, and bade them farewell.

***

When they arrived at the vast Tiger's Frontier Mountain, the Demon King there showed no suspicion. Instead, he was filled with admiration, praising them endlessly. They proceeded to the outskirts of Kuidu Palace, where they saw Houfu approaching, treading on the snow.

Li Ximing made the introductions. Houfu's eyes practically lit up, and he hurried down to greet them, saying politely, "It is truly a descendant of the Qingyi Dixiang! My apologies for the poor reception."

A rare smile touched Qingyan's face. "Tiger's Frontier is a treasured land, a fine immortal sect. The Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition's reputation is well-deserved."

The two seemed to hit it off, and Houfu was particularly emotional. But he understood they had important matters to attend to and didn't delay them. Li Ximing observed this, making a quick calculation.

'This is good... The Merging Owl that Xiukui cultivates is also one of the Three Shamans and Two Rites, with many shamanic aspects. A noble scion of the Azure Manifestation Dao is surely a welcome guest here...'

Thus, they entered the palace, arriving before the Xiukui Profound-Passage Cauldron.

Qingyan scanned his surroundings, then took a silver basin from his sleeve. It was the size of a large bowl, shining brightly as if filled with clear water, and emitting a soft light like the moon.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing," he said deeply, "I cultivate the Azure Manifestation divine ability, and I must keep my shamanic arts close. This is 'Eastern Life Flowing Water.' It has been recited over with eighty-one restrictive texts and blessed a thousand times with my divine ability. Keep it in your hand."

"When the time comes for refining, release this water into your Juque Palace and immerse it with your spiritual sense. The water will naturally dissipate along with the alchemy process. I will assist from the side with the 'Amighty Crag'!"

The process wasn't complicated. As for being cautious, Li Ximing had a wisp of True Fire guarding his Juque Palace, and if necessary, the flames from his sea of qi could also pour down. Even if it were Purple Mansion spiritual water, it would be burned away. He wasn't afraid of this Demon beast trying any tricks.

"Rest easy, Daoist Friend. First, wait for me to refine the supplementary ingredients."

He lightly tapped the cauldron's body. The lid flew open, and all kinds of supplementary ingredients flew from his sleeve, pouring into the cauldron like a river. The True Fire ignited instantly.

The Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill was, after all, a spiritual pill made from two great medicines. The difficulty was extremely high. Just refining the preliminary ingredients required smelting over three hundred and seventy types, continuing until only a pale golden medicinal liquid remained in the cauldron. Only then did the two golden caskets appear in his palm.

The lids flew open. The first thing that met his eyes was a box of golden clouds.

The clouds were in wisps, drifting and unfixed. They didn't look particularly strange, but the moment they entered his eyes, Li Ximing felt a tremor in his heart, a sudden, impulsive feeling that a great opportunity was right in front of him.

Looking deeper into the golden clouds, all sorts of illusions flickered within—one moment it was the glittering Radiant Sky Stone, the next it was the brilliant, multicolored Immeasurable Water and Fire.

'What a spiritual item!'

Li Ximing used his divine ability to guide the Non-Falling Golden Cloud into the cauldron. As the flames baked it, the spiritual item immediately became agitated, and the illusions within it grew more numerous and precious. But Li Ximing didn't spare them a second glance. He opened the other golden casket. Inside lay a single, glittering spot of light the size of a chicken's heart. The flow of dharma power above it was remarkably similar to Fuxun's!

With that one look, the final piece of the puzzle clicked into place in Li Ximing's mind. Li Zhouwei had told him about the events on Mount Dali, and his own understanding of Bright Yang was not shallow. In that instant, he understood completely.

'The Mystic Hoard Gold-Winged Bat... that must be Fuxun's species. This heart was dug out from his father! He was so happy when he saw me because the sign of Bright Yang on my body directly corresponded to his act of "son devours father"!'

For a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, symbolism was extremely important, especially for someone like Fuxun with a destiny-influencing Life Divine Ability.

Just as he thought, as the heart was brought out, Qingyan, at his side, lowered his gaze slightly. Li Ximing sighed inwardly and placed the heart, heavy as a mountain, into the cauldron. The Eastern Life Flowing Water in his sea of qi immediately began to vaporize. As if divinely inspired, Li Ximing poured his divine ability into the cauldron and began the refinement.

The Observing Jin's Mystic Derivation Pill was different from all the pills he had refined before. This heart was more stubborn than iron or stone. Even with his divine ability and the scorching True Fire, melting it was one thing, but merging it with the other medicinal liquids was another. Li Ximing's divine ability descended, and his body's dharma power poured into the cauldron, ebbing and flowing like the tide.

...

Golden Feather Sect, Purple Mist Cave.

Billowing purple mist drifted, flowing over steps of black jade. At the mountain's peak, the talisman fabled to have sealed six paths of Supreme Yang Sun Essence blazed with light, casting a golden-white glow.

It was said this talisman was a high-level item, far beyond the Purple Mansion Realm. The six paths of Supreme Yang Sun Essence were merely sealed within it, using it for nourishment. The talisman's true form was even more mysterious and unfathomable. As for how profound the sigils drawn on it were, that was something only a Golden Core cultivator could possibly know.

A man with golden sleeves embroidered with spiritual flames of shifting sand sat on the lowest step, letting the purple mist drift through his robes. He gazed into the far distance, appearing somewhat melancholic.

To his side stood a broad-shouldered, sturdy man. His eyebrows were arched high, and his eyes held a trace of latent anger as he stood with his hands behind his back.

"Have you seen anything?"

The seated man looked up, revealing a rather dashing and roguish face. It was Daoist Master Tianhuo.

In front of him sat a thin, white porcelain disk, the size of a washbasin. It was covered with a thin layer of golden sand that flowed like water. At the very center of the disk sat a tiny Daoist temple.

The temple was peculiar. Beyond the main hall, there were nine other structures—side halls, chambers, pavilions, and towers—all with yellow tiles and red beams, surrounded by stone steles. All of it was half-buried in the sand, looking like an immortal temple in a desert.

Daoist Master Tianhuo focused his divine ability for a long while before finally speaking.

"There are no traces for now, nor any special omens... Martial Uncle, you are overthinking it."

The sturdy man at his side was, of course, Daoist Master Tianque, known for his explosive temper, who had long been stationed in the Wu State for the Golden Feather Sect. He frowned and snapped,

"Xueyang comes and goes as he pleases. How long are we supposed to be on edge? A Great Daoist Master at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm, with a perfected divine ability, is wandering around Jiangnan. Do you know how many people can't sit still?!"

Daoist Master Tianhuo looked somewhat awkward.

"Xueyang doesn't seem like the type to plot in the shadows. And Yao Guanyi wouldn't pressure our sect. He's more afraid of our True Monarch plotting against *them*... Martial Uncle, you worry too much."

In these ancient, long-standing Golden Core powers, there were often huge age gaps within the same generation. Tianque was clearly much older than Tianhuo and his cultivation was higher, but his generational standing in the clan was similar. Though called Martial Uncle, in the clan, they were practically of the same brotherly generation, both having received the 'Tian' Daoist name.

Tianque sighed. "Overthinking? How can I not? That one from Changhuai has already returned. If I'm not mistaken, Suiguan has also left his grotto-heaven. But the True Monarch's whereabouts are still unknown... At a time of such change, it's hard not to worry."

His expression was uneasy. "This is a time of upheaval. Who knows if it won't happen again? The position of Geng Metal is coveted by many. I only worry someone will take advantage of the vacuum."

Tianhuo shook his head and smiled. "The Harmonising and Vault Lock; the world is nothing but Geng-Dui-Xiao. Although the Wandering Metal True Monarch is formidable and one of the few ancient True Monarchs still in existence... he ultimately refuses to enter the mortal world. He and our True Monarch each take what they need... Who would come and plot for the Geng position?"

Despite his optimism, Tianque clearly didn't agree. Just as he was about to speak, Tianhuo cut him off.

"Besides, the 'Nine Gates Temple' has already been refined into a Spiritual Artifact, and the 'Calendar Heart Sand' is powerful. But if Xueyang truly wants to hide, we won't find him. And if he isn't the type to hide and scheme, what's the point of looking for him? Martial Uncle, instead of worrying about him, you should be considering the matter of the Profound Radiance Qi."

Tianque shook his head. "A portion of the Profound Radiance Qi was taken by Suiguan and ended up in Pristine Water's hands. It was different from the amount that was supposed to be delivered. Xueyang said nothing about it, so it was most likely a tacit understanding between Luoxia and Pristine Water."

But Tianhuo smiled. He finally tore his gaze from the temple in the disk and turned to his Martial Uncle, his expression growing uneasy.

"Martial Uncle, do you remember... over a hundred years ago, there was a disturbance in the Purple Mist Smoke? That fragment flared up, showing signs of escaping?"

Tianque frowned. "Of course I remember... I was right there... Hasn't this already been settled by all parties? It was Liu Changdie! That lucky bastard received a calling from the Great Void. You could say he was blessed by fate."

Tianhuo's expression was grave. "Correct... The True Monarch said it was a calling from the 'Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book' within Wanling Heaven, bestowing fortune upon him. This caused our fragment of the monitoring Immortal Artifact to react. Everything that followed also proved that both items were indeed masterless."

"But, let's think about it differently. If the fragment in our hands could be stimulated, doesn't that mean the damaged main body of the Immortal Artifact in Donghua Heaven *must* have also reacted?"

Tianque fell into deep thought. He looked at the younger man.

"Don't forget, the Profound Radiance Qi extracted from this fragment is the only thing that can resonate with the Immortal Artifact. If it made some connection with the outside world this time... The Mansion Lord of the Moonlight Origin Mansion has a good relationship with that Immortal Yingze, the master of the Supreme Yang position. Both hail from Azure Profoundity. The things in that mansion... do you think those few *wouldn't* want them?"

Tianque fell silent. Although he was also at the Purple Mansion Realm, in terms of status, he was far inferior to Tianhuo. The things he knew were naturally incomparable. He hesitated for a long time before asking, "You mean..."

Tianhuo spoke in a low voice. "Don't be fooled by the commotion around Li Qianyuan. The True Monarchs' minds are still on the Immortal Mansion. Although our lord doesn't say it, the fact that the item was allowed to be taken means he also wants to investigate."

"And now, it's even better. The 'Jade True' has been attained, proving that she was truly willing to abandon her Fruition Attainment and leave, not just playing some illusory game. There was no conspiracy. Another obstacle in the way is now gone..."

His expression was faint, revealing a mix of shock and terror. His tone was stunned and cold.

"But who will lead this? Who *dares* to lead this? There's going to be a huge fight! Luoxia isn't stupid. The Mansion Lord back then was rumored to be the reincarnation of an Immortal Lord..."

"Guess... of those few in the heavens... how many of them are terrified right now!"
