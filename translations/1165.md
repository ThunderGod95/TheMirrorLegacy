# Chapter 1165: Gehu Peak

The sky was black. The mountain gate of the Profound Peak Sect lay prostrate upon the earth like a colossal, dying beast. The fractured light of its protective arrays showered down, yet the sheer vastness of the black clouds overhead made the sprawling gate seem insignificant.

Above, a host of violet-robed figures stood arrayed like divine soldiers besieging a demonic citadel, their presence casting a grim shadow over all.

Kong Tingyun's gaze was serene as she scanned each one of them, feeling neither hatred nor resentment. Only when her eyes fell upon a Daoist in white-gold robes did a flicker of gratitude appear in their depths.

Li Ximing stood beneath the infinitely radiant Celestial Gate, his features etched with a somber melancholy. The young attendant beside him clutched an urn, not daring to speak. Sensing the gaze from the mountain below, the Daoist Master shifted his eyes toward Li Zhouwei.

King Wei sat enthroned in the center of the Celestial Gate, a burning, multicolored light in his eyes. He remained silent.

Thunder rolled at the zenith. From a dark palace in the clouds, the terrifying light of a divine ability pulsed. A figure addressed as the Great General held a golden scroll, his expression solemn. Yet, his voice was cold and detached, as if echoing from the Underworld itself.

"Our tradition commands the True Yang and inherits the imperial line. Our virtue is supreme. Where we pass, great clans are crowned as kings and the Immortal Dao basks in our light. Thus have the southern lands submitted, none daring to harbor thoughts of defiance."

"Only you, of the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains, illicitly occupy the former lands of Yue and collude with cultivators from the north. This general was dispatched with a host of mortals and cultivators to deliver this decree, hoping to minimize bloodshed. Yet the Kong Clan has grown ever more defiant and mad. Stubborn and unenlightened, you have thrice defied the divine tradition and repeatedly rejected the True Light of Martial Cultivation."

Yang Ruiyi had already stepped out from the main hall. He raised an eyebrow and declared in a frigid tone,

"Since Martial Cultivation will not be tamed, today, we bring slaughter."

His voice was ice. The roiling Exiled Qi in the sky parted, revealing a single point of white light. It belonged to an object with a narrow neck and a mouth, like a bottle yet not a bottle. It had an angular body and a pointed base, like an awl yet not an awl. Its entire form was a muddled white, as if crafted from ceramic. A strange light seemed to be contained within, spraying out streams of white mist that forced the Exiled Qi back, carving a perfect circle of empty space in the sky.

In an instant, heaven and earth were bleached of color. Everyone stared in shocked disbelief, even King Wei averting his gaze to focus on the artifact.

The object bore no markings or inscriptions, yet a name echoed in the minds of all who saw it.

"The Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel!"

The woman—Kong Tingyun—also looked up. Her turquoise ritual robes whipped and billowed in the gale, her expression dazed. The clouds beneath her feet scattered rapidly as she stared blankly at the artifact.

'More than two hundred years of bitter cultivation, and I still couldn't escape this prison. All for it to end in death before this… thing!'

Before the overwhelming True Qi, she slowly closed her eyes.

But the howling wind lasted only a moment. The cataclysmic pain she anticipated never came. Instead, an uncanny silence fell, and a cool sensation washed over her.

Kong Tingyun opened her eyes.

Clouds surged up from below like pouncing beasts, shrouding the mountaintop. A man in white stood quietly before her. The pale light of his divine ability was so dense it seemed to solidify, forming luminous rings that hovered behind him.

His mere presence exuded a transcendent aura of Veiled Yin. His unbound black hair streamed high in the wind. The wooden pin that had once secured his crown was gone, now held in his hands clasped behind his back, where it pulsed with a faint, heroic white light.

Wei Xuanyin!

The moment this Great Daoist Master of the Guanhua Dao Lineage appeared, the divine abilities emanating from the south contracted, retreating in haste. Yang Ruiyi stared in disbelief. Li Ximing, however, looked as if he were facing a formidable enemy, his wary gaze fixed on the newcomer as he shielded the person behind him.

The Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel still hung in the sky, unmoving. It drifted among the currents of True Qi, appearing exceptionally noble.

Kong Tingyun's mind raced. In the one-in-ten-thousand chance of survival she'd clung to, she had even imagined Wang Ziya might intervene. But she had never, ever considered it would be him. This Great Daoist Master, who always cultivated in seclusion within the Profound Governance Pavilion, had met her only once. She had long since put him out of her mind.

Yet, impossibly, Wei Xuanyin was here. The sight left Kong Tingyun bewildered.

'What possible use could he still have for me?'

But Kong Tingyun was not the only one in disbelief. Every gaze in the sky shifted. Yang Ruiyi's expression darkened at an unprecedented rate, his lips trembling as the shock and fury in his heart reached a boiling point.

'How did he get in? Was he hiding here all along? What kind of concealment art could possibly evade the senses of the Hall of Profound Spirit-Cleansing! His Dao-Profundity in the Veiled Yin... it must have reached perfection!'

'But... how could he dare?'

The thought consumed him. Yang Ruiyi had never dreamed Wei Xuanyin would interfere. In his eyes, Wei Xuanyin's actions were even more insane than Qi Lanyan's had been.

'This is the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel!'

The Vessel was one of three imperial artifacts of True Qi, and the one in the sky was the very foundation of the Song State. It had never been used in previous conflicts, not because it lacked power or prestige, but precisely because it was too precious! All three artifacts were linked to the life-mandate of the Song Emperor. Just as the Emperor himself had to endlessly accumulate his power and could never afford defeat, once the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel was unleashed, it could not be allowed to fail!

'Wei Xuanyin must have timed his appearance a half-step early... he knew that once this artifact descended, there would be no turning back!'

Even so, an uncontrollable rage surged through Yang Ruiyi at the thought of him meddling in the affairs of Shanji.

'What is he trying to accomplish? Isn't it enough? He knows full well the northern cultivators can't get another inch of land from Jiangnan, yet he insists on maintaining this farce just to spite my Yang Clan?!'

But for all his fury, he found he could not bring himself to act rashly.

Wei Xuanyin was the current Dao Lord of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao and the master of the Profound Governance Pavilion. Since the Middle Ages, the Guanhua Dao Lineage had been in decline, which paradoxically made him all the more valuable.

'More importantly... he is held in high regard by certain powers.'

Yang Ruiyi finally managed to swallow his anger.

"Fellow Daoist Wei," he said lightly, "aren't you overstepping your bounds?"

His words dissipated in the air. Wei Xuanyin did not turn to look at Kong Tingyun. Instead, he scanned the host of enemies surrounding him, showing no trace of alarm.

"Tingyun once paid her respects at Profound Governance. She is, after all, of the direct lineage of Comprehending Profoundity. Ultimately, it was my Profound Governance that used her to interfere in the south's affairs. Today... I cannot simply stand by and watch her die."

His statement was worlds apart from Qi Lanyan's previous claim of her being a 'descendant of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition.' It made Yang Ruiyi realize his intentions were hostile. Anger seethed within him as he said softly,

"Direct lineage? Didn't one of them just fall over Lake Xian?"

Wei Xuanyin's expression grew complicated.

"Bright Yang was his tribulation. He has passed it."

Yang Ruiyi didn't dwell on the cryptic reply, assuming it was just some empty rhetoric borrowed from the Northern Buddhists. His grip tightened on the small cauldron in his hand. Wei Xuanyin turned his head slightly and spoke to Kong Tingyun, his voice gentle.

"Tingyun, the fate of the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains is exhausted. What was borrowed must now be returned. But you are one of my disciples, and I cannot watch you throw your life away. Renounce this mortal inheritance, and I will take you back to Profound Governance."

Hearing this, Kong Tingyun froze in disbelief. She raised her head to meet Wei Xuanyin's clear, placid eyes, and understanding bloomed within her.

'The powerful name our ancestor used to bluff his way... it was exactly what the north needed at the time. Our relationship with Profound Governance was one of mutual convenience... we were never truly acknowledged, and we certainly couldn't withstand the Yang Clan's wrath...'

'But whether out of pity or for the sake of appearances, he, Wei Xuanyin, treated me as a true descendant of the Comprehending Profoundity lineage. That was the only reason the Zhaoyao Mountain genealogy was ever brought out... The other figures from that lineage who deigned to speak with me later only did so out of respect for him.'

Her last shred of doubt shattered.

'It seems... he didn't act because he still has a use for me...'

Kong Tingyun had her epiphany. But there were no fools present; every onlooker grew pensive. Yang Ruiyi was stunned, more than half of his anger vanishing in an instant. His cold eyes stared straight at Kong Tingyun, his intention unmistakable.

'Then let's see if he can truly protect you!'

Under the intense scrutiny of all, Kong Tingyun's eyes began to well with tears. She lowered her gaze slightly and saw the old elder standing on the mountaintop. He was on his knees, his face a mask of laughter and tears, nodding at her insistently, urging her to escape.

But Kong Tingyun understood everything now.

When she'd had her breakthrough, her master, Daoist Master Changxi, had already been dead for years. But the stories had reached her one by one. She knew her elder had done everything in his power for her—from faking the identities of two Purple Mansion Realm candidates to sacrificing Kong Haiying, from securing a future bloodline to seeking aid from the Li Clan... no one could have done more.

She vaguely remembered Changxi pressing the Roaming Pass Treasured Earth into her hands and personally leading her into seclusion within the earth veins of Baihai Creek. His aged eyes had been filled with hope as he entrusted her with his legacy.

"The Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains is my life's work. The revival of the Kong Clan... rests solely on you!"

Kong Tingyun's face had been streaked with tears then, but she had no idea what intricate and ruthless schemes her elder was still plotting.

To help her break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, Changxi had borrowed the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain, a treasure of Bound Earth, from the Sword Gate. He intended for it to resonate with the Treasured Earth she possessed, completing the final step of her ascension!

A 'treasure' is that which is stored away. 'Treasured Earth' is earth that receives and holds potential, allowing it to nurture all life. Kong Tingyun had hidden herself deep within the earth veins, brewing her divine ability in perfect concert with the concept of Treasured Earth. But... it hadn't been enough.

According to the information she had gathered, Daoist Master Changxi must have spent years painstakingly embedding the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain into his own Shengyang Acupoint. He concealed it as a second manifestation of Treasured Earth, merging it with his own body. He carved countless runes into his Dharma Body so that, at the moment of his death, he could operate the Spiritual Artifact with his last ounce of strength!

Daoist Master Changxi... he had practically been blown apart from the inside by the Spiritual Artifact's power!

Every time she recalled this, Kong Tingyun could not stop herself from weeping.

The spectacle of his death had served as a cover, concealing the cataclysmic tremors of the Spiritual Artifact's activation. The true form of the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain was hidden beneath that illusion of quaking Bound Earth. His Dharma Body, meticulously prepared over decades, had contained the artifact's mountain-like true form, hiding it beneath Gehu Peak. This was the third manifestation of Treasured Earth!

And Daoist Master Sumian, without a moment's rest, had immediately set up formations on the mountain to mask any lingering anomalies. Over a long period, the entirety of Daoist Master Changxi's life's cultivation was converted into the fuel for Kong Tingyun's breakthrough.

To put it bluntly, her path—the divine ability of triple-layered, concealed earth—from the Roaming Pass Treasured Earth to the Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain, had been painstakingly paved for her by him. He had spent countless years poring over ancient texts and formulating his grand design.

'Yes... he wasn't a good man... He once held wicked intentions, attempting to refine humans into pills. Fu Yuezi was even meant to be one of his ingredients, but a warning from a powerful figure made him abandon that path forever... Yet his schemes, his arrangements... they were second to none in this age. He simply lacked a true path to walk!'

'Hardship is a lake, and this peak separates us from it... That was once my master's proud boast, made in his prime when he achieved his divine ability and befriended Senior Sumian. In the end... his words came true.'

Her expression was desolate and cold. Stepping forward into the tense atmosphere, she walked to stand before the Great Daoist Master. Under the watchful eyes of all, her slender hands closed around the hilt of her sword and drew the blade.

"Shhhnnk!"

With a twist of her wrist, she pressed the cold steel against her own neck.

'Daoist Master... I... cannot leave.'

The Kong Clan, the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains... it was all Kong Yanxi's life's work, entrusted to her. If she fled, she would save herself, but what of her disciples? What of her sect?

Wei Xuanyin had been perfectly clear:

"Renounce this mortal inheritance, and I will take you back to Profound Governance."

Just a mortal inheritance!

As powerful as this Great Daoist Master was, saving her alone would be his absolute limit. The Profound Peak Gate, left behind, would surely face the unstoppable wrath of the Great Song. And it wouldn't just be the Profound Peak Gate, but the entire Kong Clan! Everyone on the mountain, young and old, even Kong Gumo cultivating in seclusion overseas—all would be annihilated by the Yang Clan's fury.

And so, she raised her sword.

The act was like a thunderclap. Shocked and complex gazes fell upon her. The glint of the blade, the familiar posture—it was like a dagger twisting in Yang Ruiyi's eyes, melting their icy coldness and replacing it with a painful throb.

The thunder ceased. The cold of the Veiled Yin deepened. Li Ximing's expression was fraught with emotion; he seemed to want to speak but held his tongue. The grand, terrible momentum of the moment had reached its apex. All light seemed to converge on her face as she parted her lips.

"My crimes are immense. I offer my head to appease your wrath. May the Celestial Dynasty show mercy and cherish life. The Kong Clan is innocent! The Kong Clan... is innocent..."

Her words shook the heavens. The roiling white mist in the sky rapidly receded. The Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel seemed to acknowledge her sacrifice; its profound True Qi flowed back into the vessel before it vanished behind the veil of Exiled Qi.

Yang Ruiyi closed his eyes. The powerful figures arrayed in the sky lowered their gazes. Even Wei Xuanyin looked up, his composure shattered by the sword. His eyes held no pity, no surprise—only a profound and sorrowful respect.

"BOOM!"

A deafening thunderclap echoed as silver light flooded the land. Reflected on the edge of her blade was the old man, kneeling and weeping on the ground. But his shadow was instantly washed away by a boundless radiance of Bound Earth that erupted from her.

The Bound Earth collapsed. The profound mountain crumbled. Kong Tingyun's life force poured out of her like light. Her delicate face fractured, and multicolored light burst from the tips of her hair as her features aged beyond recognition. The golden case at her waist vibrated, its lid sliding open. A wild gust of wind brutally ripped the pale Daoist robe from within, letting it unfurl in the reflection of her fading, gray eyes.

In the last embers of her life, Kong Tingyun willed the disintegrating light of Bound Earth to part around the white robe. She let it tumble and fly, a free and graceful thing, into the boundless forest, where it became a single speck of white in the oppressive dark.

The erupting light of Bound Earth solidified into stone, piling up as the land itself fell apart. In the darkness, the earth trembled and new mountains surged upward. A sudden, thick fog billowed out, spreading from the ruins all the way to the edge of the Exiled Qi.

The Profound Peak Sect was no more.
