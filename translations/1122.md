# Chapter 1122: Vast Jade

Touba Qiye's eyes, burning with Profound Yellow Qi, stared heavily at him. The great hall was silent save for the crackling of the fiercely burning True Fire. The Valiant King remained quiet for a long time before speaking.

“Daoist Friend Touba, I understand why Lord Yao sent you.”

At his side, Shilou Yingge raised an eyebrow, seeming to suppress the urge to speak. Touba Qiye continued in a soft voice,

“Back when the Wei first rose, our two families were enfeoffed side-by-side. When the Qi later fell, we contended for the world together. Your ancestor, Gao Jun, was a good friend of the former emperor and the king my Liang clan recognized to 'Uphold Wei'... Even if we've had our frictions since, we have ultimately walked this path together for many years.”

“This isn't just about our personal friendship today; it's about the bond between our families... The matter of King Wei is no longer something the Gao clan can involve itself in!”

Touba Qiye looked anxious.

“Moongaze Lake saved the Li clan, and it's their life-saving talisman. But in the end, it will also be their death warrant! If the Gao clan gets entangled in this, it will surely lead to disaster!”

Gao Fu's expression didn't flicker. His voice was utterly flat as he replied:

“Thank you for the warning, Daoist friend.”

This made Touba Qiye turn his head away. He opened his mouth to speak several times but ultimately held his tongue, recalling this was another's family affair. After a long pause, he finally said,

“In that case... Qiye takes his leave.”

The blood brother of Mobei's Regent King, the Great Daoist Master of the Touba family, left without another word, striding hastily from the hall. Shilou Yingge escorted him all the way to the edge before finally speaking.

“You've troubled yourself, Senior.”

Touba Qiye's speech in the hall had clearly lowered some of his guard. Shilou Yingge's voice was heavy with worry.

“This matter... isn't about right or wrong. Please, milord, do not take offense.”

Touba Qiye turned back, a hint of a sigh in his twin-colored, Profound Yellow Qi-filled eyes.

“What offense is there to take? I can't say he's wrong... After all...”

He paused.

“If it came down to it, and only one of you and Ci'er could live... it would certainly be you, Shilou Yingge.”

This silenced Shilou Yingge for a long moment.

“That might not be a good thing.”

Touba Qiye didn't reply. He silently rode the winds away. Even though the one to be sacrificed was his own son, his grief was overshadowed by a stark resolution.

Even the Touba clan of old couldn't afford to offend Mount Luoxia, let alone now.

'As long as big brother's and the young master's plan succeeds... Ci'er will just have to be wronged!'

As he flew away, Shilou Yingge returned to the fire hall, his thoughts heavy. The dark red flames leaped, casting flickering light on Gao Fu. Shilou Yingge lowered his gaze, stepped forward, and asked,

“Great King... whom will you send to stop Wei?”

Gao Fu didn't look at him. He stared quietly at the radiance beyond the countless palace halls.

“Yingge, I suppose you must resent me now.”

Shilou Yingge raised an eyebrow and smiled.

“You are the Great King, the Valiant King, and the Gao Family Head. You make the decisions. This junior can only obey. However, Yingge must consider the future of the Gao clan. You have your reasons for courting death, and I have my wish to preserve our family. Resenting one's superior... that is not the way of the Gao.”

He said no more, only smiling.

“I only ask that Your Majesty grants my wish!”

Gao Fu gave him a deep look. In the end, he offered no words of dissuasion.

“Go, then.”

Expressionless, Shilou Yingge bowed and withdrew. The flame-filled palace grew even more silent. The Valiant King, Gao Fu, stood alone in the hall, gazing silently at the bright Heavenly Light beyond the palaces.

...

Night's darkness surged.

The sea was utterly still, without a single ripple of light or color, submerged in thick blackness. An unknown time passed before a speck of Heavenly Light drifted over and hovered to a stop above the water.

Li Ximing's eyes were bright as he looked down at the ocean.

“This Weak Water... it's truly formidable.”

He had only just entered the sea region, but he could already sense that the strange properties of the Weak Water here were enough to make it difficult for even a Qi Refining cultivator to ride the wind. Without a Mansion Water dharma artifact, he feared not even a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator would dare try to cross a hundred li.

Beside him, Daoist Master Bao Xiang shook her head slightly.

“This isn't even its most dangerous part. Further west, there is a strait called the Abyss of Weak Water. Even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who isn't careful can fall in.”

Li Ximing asked, intrigued, “Beyond the Abyss of Weak Water, is there a Sea's Cape?”

Daoist Master Bao Xiang smiled and nodded.

“This place can't compare to the Eastern Sea, with its countless outer seas. Continue west from the Abyss of Weak Water for another thousand li, and you'll reach the Sea's Cape.”

The two flew onward. A massive mountain range swiftly rose from the sea, winding and undulating, shrouded in a hazy, luminous mist. The surrounding water was perfectly still, like a clear mirror.

“That is the Little Mountain of Vast Jade,” Daoist Master Bao Xiang said.

Li Ximing had heard of this mountain. The Marvelous Wisdom Whisker he'd gotten from Liu Changdie years ago was a treasure from this very place. He pinched his fingers in a quick calculation and asked in surpris.

“Gathering Wood?”

Daoist Master Bao Xiang nodded with a smile.

“This mountain was formed from a demon's corpse. The Eastern Sea has Splitreed Island; the Western Sea has the Little Mountain of Vast Jade. It just can't compare to the Eastern Sea in terms of resources or cultivators. Ordinary people can't set foot on this mountain. Anyone who can stay here is at least in the Foundation Establishment Realm.”

Her expression turned serious.

“After all, this is where the very first 'Gathering Wood' Demon Monarch was slain. Who knows how many treasures it has nourished over the millennia. Back in the day, Senior Yuanxiu cultivated here for many years.”

“Yuanxiu?”

Li Ximing hadn't expected to hear his name. As he pondered, Daoist Master Bao Xiang glanced around and lowered her voice.

“He had a good relationship with Xinggong Terrace. My own closest friend is the current master of Xinggong Terrace. I heard that Daoist Master Yuanxiu came here long ago to discuss his path with the Great Daoist Master Miaoqi.”

“At the time, the Great Daoist Master warned him that his method for achieving the Dao was too dangerous. But Daoist Master Yuanxiu disagreed, saying, ‘The Great Dao is born of heaven; we who cultivate later merely follow it. How can there be a path without risk, or a transformation without peril?’”

Li Ximing remarked, “I've heard many praise him. He must have been just one step away.”

Daoist Master Bao Xiang smiled.

“Senior sees clearly. Old Daoist Master Yuanxiu may not have a reputation for combat, but his Dao-Profundity was first-class.”

Li Ximing keenly sensed she seemed to know an unusual amount about matters in Jiangnan. He filed the thought away. Hearing the name Great Daoist Master Miaoqi, his interest was piqued, and he raised an eyebrow.

“This Great Daoist Master Miaoqi... was she a 'Whole Pill' cultivator? What is her cultivation level now?”

Daoist Master Bao Xiang's expression changed, a complex look flashing in her eyes. She lowered her head.

“Her Ladyship perished long ago.”

Li Ximing was taken aback.

He mused, “This was...”

Seeing that they were drawing closer to the mountain, and their connection to the Great Void was rapidly fading, Bao Xiang grew a bit bolder. She sneered,

“Who else could it be? Whose private domain is the 'Whole Pill' path? Wasn't there already that Daoist Master from the Helian family? Even with no evidence, it's easy enough to guess!”

Li Ximing felt a jolt of shock. A flicker of worry crossed his heart, and he nodded silently, lowering his gaze to the mountains below. The colors there were thick and layered. Bao Xiang quickly fell silent.

“This is the Little Mountain of Vast Jade.”

Li Ximing scanned the surrounding sea. It was truly just this single mountain island. Noticing the dense fog, a thought struck him.

“Oh? Senior Liu once gave me a spiritual resource from this mountain, but for some reason, it was hazy and indistinct...”

Bao Xiang whispered, “‘Mansion Water’ is the water of a thriving lake, and ‘Gathering Wood’ is the wood where things perch and depend on one another. Wood in water should be nourished, but this is dead wood. Instead of nourishment, it received rot. This created the 'Great Submerged Rot Qi,' which is even more potent than the winds of the Great Western Plateau. It can shroud one's spiritual sense.”

“There are many spiritual items on the mountain, and even Purple Mansion Realm resources appear from time to time. They're just hard to find; you must rely on divination. However, every year on the fourteenth of the seventh month, the mists on the mountain thin slightly. Even Qi Refining disciples can enter, so the various sects send their people in.”

Bao Xiang's face held a cold smile.

“I don't need to say more. The so-called fourteenth of the seventh month is just when a few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators join forces to suppress the Great Submerged Rot Qi. They naturally use life-mandates to 'fill the gap.' How could there be any real treasures left for the junior disciples?”

Li Ximing glanced over, his mind working. He silently connected to the Immortal Artifact, and the power of Spirit Probe poured forth. His vision cleared instantly, revealing the wood-grained body of the mountain.

But beneath the mist, atop the mountains, were piles of white bones and collapsed, dead trees. Not a single spot was clean. Rivers of blood pulsed as if breathing, nourishing the spiritual-qi-wreathed clouds and rain.

'This is the sea of demon cultivators, after all. It really is just a bloody mire—using 'Gathering Wood' to collect blood qi and nurture spiritual resources.'

He scanned the scene, unsurprised. Bao Xiang, however, seemed to remember something and smiled.

“There are benefits, too. Because this qi can mask spiritual sense, many 'children of fate' have risen from this place. Thirty percent of the Western Sea's Purple Mansion Realm cultivators came from the Little Mountain of Vast Jade!”

Li Ximing glanced over impassively, but under the Immortal Artifact's observation, he noticed something. On the sea's mirror-calm surface at the mountain's base, there was the faint reflection of a palace. It was massive, clearly not a human dwelling.

The palace was ancient and rough, yet damaged and incomplete. Signs of destruction were everywhere, a chaotic mess of light and dark green. Enormous statues lay toppled on either side; he could vaguely make out the fragmented, stone-carved scales of immense serpentine bodies.

His heart leaped. Recalling old rumors about the Western Sea, he asked:

“I've heard there is also a 'Great Vast Jade Mountain'...”

“Oh.”

Bao Xiang, oblivious, said seriously, “The 'Great Vast Jade Mountain' is far away, on the seabed. It was once the Western Sea Dragon Monarch's palace, but now it's the residence of a certain great lord. We don't normally speak of it. The interesting one is the other, which the people of the Western Sea call the 'Middle Vast Jade Mountain.' It's not on the sea, nor _in_ the sea.”

Li Ximing laughed. Feigning ignorance, he asked,

“Oh? If it's a Mansion Water, it can't be in the sky. So... is it in the Great Void?”

The woman, riding her Pit Water, said:

“It's in the water's reflection.”

She elaborated, “That place was once the palace of the True Hornless Dragon's sixth son, Dongfang Fengchi. Because he held the 'Pristine Water' position, he borrowed the concept of 'Gathering Wood establishing a Mansion Water' to create a pool. That's why the water is as calm as a mirror. It's located within the reflection of the Little Mountain of Vast Jade—that's what we call the 'Middle Vast Jade Mountain'.”

“Later, he was eliminated by the Western Sea Dragon Monarch Dongfang Yuezhu and the other Dragons. The place has been empty ever since. Occasionally, on days when the wind and rain have ceased and the world is clear, you can still see the ruins of the 'Middle Vast Jade Mountain' in the reflection.”

Li Ximing called it marvelous, knowing the Immortal Artifact had already seen it clearly. It had to be that former Demon palace. He secretly pushed the divine ability, and sure enough, he saw a field of ruins. The throne at the highest point was as large as a palace, but it had been split in two. The entire place was a wreck, completely empty, with no sign of treasure.

He asked in surprise, “Isn't that a Grotto-Heaven? Has any Daoist friend ever tried to enter?”

Bao Xiang clearly faltered, not expecting his mind to leap there so quickly. She sank into deep thought.

“This...”

Before Bao Xiang could answer, Li Ximing’s gaze, which had been moving, suddenly froze. An utterly terrifying scene had appeared.

Amidst the endless, ancient reflections of the ruins, there was a flicker of green.

It was a green-robed figure.

The man wore green robes with golden tassels. His movements were lazy as he lounged against a massive, throne-like step. His face was demonic, with long, narrow eyes like a snake or a Flood Dragon. Blue-black hair spilled down, dark and dreadful.

He was gazing up at the sky, twirling a green apricot in his hand. He had already taken a bite. The expression on his face was one of keen interest.

Li Ximing felt an icy chill shoot up his spine, flooding his throat and mind.

That face was terribly familiar.

'Suiguan.'

The Great Daoist Master who had walked out of Pristine Speech Heaven. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator suspected to be an incarnation of True Monarch Lushui, Du Qing. The demonic figure who had personally orchestrated a slaughter of millions!

'He's looking at me.'

In Li Ximing's eyes, this ghostly Great Daoist Master with his perfected divine ability was no different from Du Qing himself. His appearance on the north bank back then had been terrifying enough, let alone appearing so suddenly within his Spirit Probe's vision!

'Has he been hiding here all this time? Or is it...'

He didn't dare show the slightest change in expression. He didn't dare deliberately look away. He forced himself to keep gazing at the sea's surface as if appreciating the view.

The Great Daoist Master moved.

Suiguan caught the green apricot between his lips. The smile on his face seemed to fade. He freed both hands, sat up a little straighter, and continued to stare right at Li Ximing's face.

'...'

The suffocating moment lasted for two full breaths. Only then did Li Ximing hear Bao Xiang laugh.

“They don't dare. They're all afraid that what they'd be stepping into isn't the 'Middle Vast Jade Mountain'—but Pristine Speech Heaven!”

'They have good reason to be afraid...'

Her words were a life-saving rope. With a look of perfect surprise, Li Ximing turned his head to look at the Daoist Master. His smile remained fixed. He shook his sleeves, hiding his hands behind his back.

“You must be joking! Pristine Speech Heaven is far away in Jiangnan.”

He glanced at the Daoist Master beside him. In that brief instant, he had already severed his connection to the Immortal Artifact. But the artifact's power was astonishing. In the fraction of a second it took to turn his head, his peripheral vision still caught the scene below.

The ruined steps were now empty.

The green-robed man was standing at the very apex of the reflection, his robes billowing. His arms were crossed over his chest, his pale hand still clutching the green apricot. That demonic face was now only a fist's distance from breaking the surface of the water. He was so close that if he just raised his eyebrows, he would be seen.

His eyes, swirling with green and purple light, held a look of profound interest as they stared quietly at him.

The seawater was crystal clear, as if nothing at all was in it.
