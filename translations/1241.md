# Chapter 1241 Seeking Advancement

Li Wushao did not ask much more, for even though he was only a minor demon at the time, he could still perceive that Kongheng was out of the ordinary; it was just that his heart would be ill at ease if he did not ask, so he nodded, took his leave, and departed.

After waiting for the old demon to get far away, Li Ximing finally reached into his sleeve, took out the jade box, and shattered it with a flick of his finger; gazing at the spiritual flame within, he reached out with two fingers and picked it up.

The moment the item touched his palm, its phantom colors flickered, and within an instant, it was completely refined!

‘Dangwood Molten Fire…’

The fire transformed into a speck of azure light and fell into his Juque Palace, and in that instant, a warmth rushed to his nose as if he were holding a medicinal pill in his mouth that was continuously conditioning his physical form; his originally weakened aura was immediately nourished, and even his divine abilities and dharma power grew vigorous!

‘What a treasure.’

It did, however, make him feel a bit regretful:

‘If this fire had been delivered earlier, my recovery would have been much easier… alas, for that old Daoist Master to obtain something like this from Golden Oneness, he must have paid a steep price…’

So he sat cross-legged in meditation, and after the sky had brightened but once, a streak of Radiant Fire was seen speeding over to land among the mountains; when Ji'an saw that it was him personally, he understood that the Li family was no longer putting him off, and that old face of his was wreathed in smiles as he said:

“Daoist Friend Zhaojing… it is a rare occasion indeed to see you!”

Li Ximing had promised him long ago but had then delayed time and again, and this concerned the great matter of another's attainment of the Dao, not to mention they had previously given his family ample benefits, so it was truly improper; a sliver of guilt arose in his heart, and he performed a salute, saying:

“The tides of the great war were truly to blame… Zhaojing is deeply ashamed!”

“You overstate it!”

Ji'an hurriedly returned the salute and said:

“These were matters beyond your control…”

Ji'an was, of course, aware of the Li family's circumstances, and in fact, the old Daoist Master had gathered sufficient spiritual resources long ago; to put it bluntly, he, Ji'an, had only delayed coming for a few years because he had heard there would be a great battle between Western Shu and Wei in the desert, fearing that the Li family might intentionally postpone the alchemy until the Western Shu forces attacked, thereby forcing him to wade into those muddy waters to protect his own pill!

It was precisely because of this suspicion that Ji'an had deliberately delayed until now; in the face of the Li family's various requests, he showed no temper at all, and once everything was settled, he sat eagerly before Li Ximing and said with a smile:

“Is the fire to your satisfaction!”

“Of course!”

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly and sighed, while Ji'an chuckled and said:

“I’ve seen another one of these before; it came from a grotto-heaven years ago, and I recall… isn't that Daoist Master Junjian a good friend of your family? He took a liking to that spiritual fire at first sight, injuring several Daoist Masters in his relentless effort to seize it!”

“Senior Tu Longjian…”

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully and said:

“Indeed… he is also a Molten Fire cultivator! How could his heart not be stirred upon seeing such a fire…”

Ji'an, to put it plainly, was here to ask for a favor, and sitting on the mountain, he hoped for a warmer atmosphere so as not to seem too obsequious; seeing that Li Ximing was indeed close to Tu Longjian, he smiled and said:

“Precisely! He is a prodigy of his generation; Molten Fire and Valley Water are opposites, and his divine abilities are formidable, capable of burning away the flames of the heart and incinerating one's very life-mandate; I wonder if he has stepped beyond the Purple Mystery by now…”

A sigh of indeterminate sincerity appeared in the old Daoist Master’s eyes:

“There are not many Molten Fire cultivators, but they are all quite capable, for theirs is a great Dao naturally suited for alchemy; it can cure illnesses and eliminate plagues, yet it can also incinerate the soul, and if his whereabouts were not so erratic and if I knew whether he practiced alchemy, this old man would have thought of seeking him out as well.”

Li Ximing’s understanding of Molten Fire was largely theoretical; he knew this Dao Lineage and that of Valley Water were locked in a cycle of creation and destruction, but he had recently met one such cultivator: Daoist Master Hongyan of the Ni clan.

‘His is the Sire of the High Mounds, but there didn’t seem to be anything remarkable about it.’

But now that he had finally gotten some news of Tu Longjian, he was quite interested and said:

“How has Senior Tu Longjian been these past few years? Is there any news?”

Ji'an chuckled, and after observing Li Ximing’s expression and seeing that he did not seem to be feigning interest, he said with some hesitation:

“He… is formidable, of course, and has a very powerful background; when he came to travel the Northern Sea years ago, many rogue cultivators tried to curry favor with him, but unfortunately couldn't get an audience, and he also has a Dao companion…”

“A Dao companion?”

Li Ximing's eyes lit up as he said:

“I wonder from which family she hails?”

Ji'an sighed and said:

“I am based in the Northern Sea, so I am somewhat familiar; she is a cultivator from the North Ring Sect, with the surname… Xie.”

“Xie? Which Xie?”

“In the Northern Sea, which other Xie could there be?”

Li Ximing now understood just how powerful that “powerful background” truly was, and he sighed, saying:

“That is good to hear! I often hear of the great houses of Wang and Xie, but being in the south, my understanding is shallow; the only one nearby is the Zhang family… yet I already know the heights of their divine abilities, so I imagine those two houses must be even more extraordinary…”

Ji'an’s gaze grew somewhat complicated as he replied:

“The Wang and Xie… are indeed true great houses, but you are mistaken, Daoist Friend; such great houses, in fact, place more importance on the struggle for the Dao, and sometimes… a surname is merely a label.”

This seemed to touch upon some memory, causing him to lower his gaze and fall silent, while Li Ximing praised:

“I have met someone from the Wang family before; he was of the Wandering Metal Dao and had the bearing of an immortal, though I do not know which Daoist Tradition he belongs to…”

He was, of course, referring to Wang Xun, the Sword Immortal King who had once left their family with crucial capital for their rise—the Foundation Establishment spiritual root, the Wanling Flower; although he had taken a sliver of Sword Intent in return, looking back now, the Li family felt he had been exceedingly generous… Li Ximing had only just learned of the relationship between Golden Oneness and the Wandering at Ease from Li Que'wan, and after mentioning it briefly, he began to probe the man before him.

“Ah, the Wandering Metal…”

Ji'an shook his head, his expression complex as he said:

“The so-called Wang and Xie have produced talents since ancient times, but back then, many stood alongside them: the Dan and Han families, were the joyous masters of Jielin; the Jiang and Huan, whose renown was a divine radiance across the world; and the Loutai and Wei families, the very exemplars of the two Yins; yet most of these have faded into history...”

“These two families are the most famous; are there others who can be compared to them? Yes. But as for those who could surpass them, you could count them on one hand.”

“Of course… with the exception of the family on the mountain.”

Li Ximing’s gaze lowered as he listened to the old man sigh:

“The Xue.”

This was not a good topic, and after a single glance, the two of them instantly avoided it; the old man continued as if nothing had happened:

“The founders of these bloodlines were all direct disciples from the Three Profoundities, their statuses so lofty that comparing them was meaningless, yet what was fated to decline still declined; the reason the Wang and Xie families have survived to this day is because their patriarchs were masters of Fruition Attainment, so exalted as to have transcended this world, and not only are their disciples spread across the land, but the patriarchs themselves also paid some mind to their bloodlines… that is what has allowed them to persist to this day as if protected by a talisman.”

He paused for a moment, as if recalling something, and said:

“Of course, this was also thanks to the several great figures who attained the Dao at critical moments.”

Li Ximing sighed to himself as he listened, then asked with some hesitation:

“May I ask… to which of the Three Profoundities do the Wang and Xie families belong?”

Ji'an let out a soft sigh and said:

“The Wang are the noble scions of Comprehending Profoundity, and the Xie are the great powers of Encompassing Profoundity.”

‘Encompassing Profoundity!’

In Li Ximing’s view, the Dao of Comprehending Profoundity was the most illustrious of the present age, and it had subtly assumed the posture of a victor; it would have made sense if both families, along with the now-ascendant Xue clan, all hailed from Comprehending Profoundity, which would have befitted Heavenly Pavilion Heavenly Glow’s great power to suppress the world… yet he had never imagined that the Xie clan actually originated from Encompassing Profoundity!

‘It’s not so strange, I suppose… though this family is famous, they have remained in the Northern Sea year-round, never once meddling in the affairs of the mainland; there must be a reason for that.’

He was lost in deep thought, while Ji'an continued to observe his expression; after a long time, Li Ximing silently nodded and said softly:

“I have learned much.”

A smile appeared on his face:

“Senior, have you prepared the spiritual resources and items?”

“Of course!”

Ji'an had been waiting with bated breath for him to say just that! He nodded in delight and said:

“I have spent these past days running in every direction; from Zhuluo, I traded for a Pale Li-Light Obscurity Leaf and a Vermilion Luan's Marvelous Feather; from Chunyi, I acquired a Superior Li Treasure-Fluid and a Crimson Heart Twin-Leaf Flower; then I journeyed all the way to the Northern Sea to petition the luan birds and borrowed a White Li-Light Heart-Vow Fruit, which I have just now brought back!”

With a wave of his sleeve, the table was suddenly covered in stone and jade boxes of all sizes, some containing leaves of golden splendor, others brilliant flower pistils—not one of them was a common item! All manner of Radiant Fire spiritual auras intertwined, causing the entire mountain to shimmer faintly with the flames of Li-Light.

This was the entire life's savings of a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had visited two grotto-heavens, and its mere presence on the mountain instantly made Li Ximing hold his breath as he sighed:

“Daoist Friend, you have truly spared no expense!”

Ji'an's gaze was resolute as he said quietly:

“If I can step into the Purple Mystery, then death would be a small price to pay!”

...

Profound Governance Pavilion.

The sky was dim, and a profound silence reigned upon the high platform; moonlight, like white snow, fell upon the intricate black and white of the game board, where a fair hand holding a black stone lingered, long hesitating to make a move.

A youth sat at the other end of the board, his eyes shining with a divine light, yet he seemed to have lost focus, staring blankly at the board; after a long wait, the person opposite him finally placed the black stone down and said softly:

“Jiexing, it is your turn.”

“Oh, right.”

Tao Jiexing picked up a stone and stared blankly at the board; after a long moment of contemplation, he said with a wry smile:

“Martial Uncle Wei, I have lost.”

The man before him still held a black stone from the box, his eyes fixed on the crisscrossing lines of the board as if he had not heard him; Tao Jiexing paused, then said in a low voice:

“Martial Uncle, I have lost!”

Only then did those words seem to startle Wei Xuanyin awake; he raised his head as if from a dream, reassessed the game before him, and said:

“Very well.”

A heavy silence fell within the Profound Pavilion; Tao Jiexing was fairly familiar with the Daoist Master before him and had never seen Wei Xuanyin so lost in thought, and being a simple soul who had spent his years cultivating in the mountains, he sat there feeling somewhat helpless and murmured:

“Martial Uncle Wei… as for that qi, my clan truly has no more of it!”

Wei Xuanyin raised an eyebrow and gave a faint smile, saying:

“Jiexing, you have misunderstood.”

He said quietly:

“It has simply been a long time, so I took this opportunity to reminisce.”

When Vast Cicada died all those years ago, Tao Jiexing had furiously cursed Qi Lanyan, but this time, when news of the great battle at Lake Xian arrived, his burning anger vanished in astonishment, leaving only a turbulent mess of feelings in its wake; now, having come to the Profound Governance Pavilion, it was he who could not sit still.

He was a clever man, just not yet worldly, and sitting here now, he lowered his gaze and said softly:

“I… never thought Lanyan would be so resolute… had I known it would come to this, had I known that would be our final meeting, I, Jiexing…”

Wei Xuanyin shook his head wordlessly and sighed:

“Before my master passed, he left me with two instructions; the first was to entrust me with our Guanhua lineage's thousand-year-long aspiration to bring order to the Veiled Yin, and the second, was the Tao family.”

Tao Jiexing raised his head and stared at him, somewhat stunned, as Wei Xuanyin said quietly:

“I am about to enter seclusion, and once I do, matters of the Great Zhao will no longer reach me; your Tao clan is near Luoxia, and the clash of armies will eventually involve you, so I cannot be at ease without leaving you with a few words.”

Tao Jiexing said in a strained voice:

“Please speak, Martial Uncle!”

Wei Xuanyin said softly:

“Jiang Yan is a formidable figure; with him in Luoxia, even King Wei will have a headache, and since your Tao clan has followed the Immortal Dao for many years, neither side will trouble you so long as you do not rashly intervene.”

He paused, then continued:

“I know you all look down on Zong Chang, but she is actually quite capable; if she makes any requests or passes on any message, you must listen to her carefully… it could save your clan from annihilation.”

Tao Jiexing was speechless for a moment, his expression shaken as he lowered his gaze and said:

“How could it come to that!”

A flicker of gloom crossed Wei Xuanyin’s face:

“Because I will be in seclusion.”

Tao Jiexing understood in an instant, and the sorrow on his face slowly receded as he said in a low voice:

“Jiexing understands.”

Wei Xuanyin smiled faintly and rose to his feet, his gaze falling upon the grid of the game board as he said softly:

“Jiexing, before your great-grandfather passed away, he wept on his deathbed; the secrets of the Unblemished Robe, those words… I heard them from my master long ago, and I presume you have as well, so while there may be few in this world who know what I am doing, your Tao clan, and you, Tao Jiexing, certainly do.”

These words made Tao Jiexing bow his head deeply, unsure how to respond, but the man before him had already turned and begun to walk away, saying quietly:

“You, of all people, must understand my situation best—and I have called you here today because the Tao clan is a great house that has cultivated the three yins for generations.”

He murmured:

“I once thought the day would come when I would become a Great Daoist Master and could properly accept and guide disciples, but now, it seems that will be difficult to achieve; although Baiyue is highly talented, she lacks that kind of lofty ambition.”

The master of the Profound Governance Pavilion lowered his gaze and said:

“Whether I succeed or fail this time, it will be difficult for me to see you again, and difficult to act of my own will; should I fall, I ask you, for the old master’s sake, to help our Guanhua lineage… if Baiyue cannot be saved, then… so be it, but please find a junior so that the Guanhua Dao Lineage will not be severed.”

Tears welled in Tao Jiexing’s eyes as he choked out:

“This junior understands! This junior… prays for Martial Uncle’s success!”

Wei Xuanyin waved his hand, gesturing for him to leave, and after bowing repeatedly, the youth finally vanished reluctantly into the Great Void.

In an instant, the celestial pavilion fell silent, with only the gentle moonlight bathing the steps; Wei Xuanyin took a few paces, walking until he stood before the great cauldron in the center of the courtyard.

Within the Zhaoyao Four Seasons Cauldron, light and shadow swirled like clear water, yet they faintly reflected the image of a jade vial, and the look in Wei Xuanyin’s eyes began to change.

‘Yin-Leap Qi… the problem must lie here; the Unblemished Robe reveres the Supreme Yin, just as the Flawless Deficient Yin points toward the Yin-Leap Qi.’

‘The Yin-Leap Qi from the Immortal Mansion.’

The resolution in Wei Xuanyin’s eyes grew ever stronger:

‘It’s impossible that you don’t know… even if not a single Purple Mansion cultivator in the north or south can grasp the crux of this matter, you must understand it perfectly, yet you just stand by and watch.’

‘Why.’

But there was no longer any room for hesitation; he understood that this was his last chance, and if the Yin-Leap Qi from the Immortal Mansion, filtered through the Azure Insight Origin Mirror, was still not enough to match the requirements of the Unblemished Robe, then another suitable source could not be found in all the world!

‘If this divine ability fails, the Dao of Veiled Yin… is doomed!’
