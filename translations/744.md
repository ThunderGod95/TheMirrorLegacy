# Chapter 744: Dark Night

The wilderness.

Kong Guxi had mostly recovered from his injuries. Draped in a simple Daoist robe, he rode the wind, surveying his new domain. Two disciples trailed behind him, and as far as the eye could see, the land below teemed with a dense sea of people.

His Profound Peak Gate had relocated five hundred thousand people into the wilderness, nearly halving the population of their former territory in Shanji Prefecture. They had abandoned the more remote regions entirely, bringing everything they owned to this new land.

A territory that had lain empty for a century was suddenly bustling. He had established several secure settlements for his people. A good number of his disciples had been saved; he now had over a dozen at the Qi Refining Realm and even more at the Embryonic Breathing stage, all of whom had been dispatched to various locations.

As he tallied the lands in the wilderness now under the Profound Peak Gate’s control, Kong Guxi felt a flicker of relief.

'It’s not a small territory,' he thought. 'Enough to support our current disciples. The only drawback is the lack of rich spirit veins, which will make cultivation difficult for those at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Thankfully, we can borrow the Li family's spirit mountains.'

The Li family had been more than fair, granting him authority over most of the Profound Peak Gate's original holdings in the wilderness. Though news of raids and pillaging in Shanji Prefecture reached him from time to time, Kong Guxi had little time to mourn the loss.

'All the loyal ones have been moved. From now on, this wilderness is the domain of my Kong Clan. Let them fight over Shanji Prefecture… I was powerless to stop it anyway. Every extra day we held onto it was a blessing.'

Halfway through his patrol, he spotted several of his clan members gathered on a distant mountain peak. Li Chenghui stood among them, spear in hand. The sight made Kong Guxi’s eye twitch. He flew over at once, landing softly on the peak.

"Sect Master Kong," Li Chenghui said, his tone serious. "You've returned. We have an urgent matter to discuss."

Kong Guxi’s gaze swept over the group. His own people—Kong Qiuyan, Kong Xiaxiang, and even the clan’s other pillar of strength, Kong Guli—were all waiting expectantly. He hurried forward. “Please, instruct me!”

“I wouldn’t dare instruct you, Sect Master,” Li Chenghui replied, his expression grave. “I am merely relaying a message.”

“A message I received a while ago. My family’s Daoist Master has gone to the Purple Smoke Gate and sent me to inform you that your sect is to retrieve an item.”

“What item?” Kong Guxi’s heart pounded with fear. He was terrified Li Chenghui would ask for something like Kong Haiying’s head. Sweat beaded on his forehead.

But Li Chenghui only said, “An item left behind by Daoist Master Changxi. It is located beneath the primary seat in the Hall of Resting Peaks on your main mountain. Please send someone to retrieve it.”

Kong Guxi breathed a silent sigh of relief. He looked around and chose the most dependable person present. “Brother, I must ask you to make the trip.”

Kong Guli nodded and departed, leaving Kong Guxi and the others on the mountain, unsure of what to do. Kong Qiuyan glanced from Li Chenghui to her sect master, her mind too preoccupied to focus on anything. She ended up leaning against the doorway to wait. Old Kong Yu, his injuries still unhealed, paced back and forth, wanting to ask questions but not daring to.

The sky had begun to darken by the time a streak of light finally appeared in the distance. Kong Guli landed hastily on the peak, a stone box in his hands. “The seat was protected by a complex secret art,” he explained, breathless. “It took some time to bypass!”

Kong Guxi had no mind to reply. He opened the box, and the rest of the Kong clan members crowded around to look, their eyes filled with apprehension. Inside the box lay a piece of cloth, on which was written a single line of text.

“Desperate times call for desperate measures. Shanji Prefecture and the Profound Peak mountain sect are to be placed under the authority of Daoist Master Zhaojing.”

The cloth, inscribed by a Daoist Master, had taken on the texture of jade. Its smooth surface reflected their stunned faces. Old Kong Yu read it twice before speaking. “It is the ancestor’s decree.”

Seeing that there was no issue with the directive, Li Chenghui produced a jade box of his own. From it, he took out a piece of spirit cloth as hard as stone and placed it on the table. The crowd, silent as statues, leaned in once more to read.

‘I entrust Daoist Master Zhaojing to watch over the Profound Peak Gate. Should the situation turn dire, he has my permission to cede Shanji Prefecture to another power in exchange for their aid.’

The Kong clan stood in stunned silence.

To them, Shanji Prefecture was what Moongaze Lake was to the Li family. Losing it would be like the Li clan losing their sixteen prefectures and two mountains, left with nothing but Pingya Island. If they lost Shanji, they could never return to their ancestral home. All they could do was remain in the wilderness, serving as a buffer for others. Although they’d had some inkling of this when they migrated so many people, seeing it laid bare in writing left them utterly lost.

Kong Guxi was just as stunned.

In his heart, he had known since the battle on the river that the Profound Peak Gate was outmatched. In a departure from the thinking of nearly every other member of his clan, the sect master had already begun to see Shanji Prefecture as something that no longer belonged to them. That was why, no matter how fiercely the battles raged or how much was plundered, he could grit his teeth and suppress his heartache, pouring all his energy into their former dependency, this new domain in the wilderness.

But Changxi's final command mentioned another place: the mountain sect!

If their very mountain could be bartered away, then what of Kong Haiying and Kong Tingyun, who could not be moved? Kong Guxi could endure any hardship as long as there was a sliver of hope. But without those two, what was the Kong Clan?

Barely a second passed before Kong Guxi dropped to his knees. “The Profound Peak Gate respectfully obeys the Daoist Master’s command!” he cried out.

Night had fallen. His voice, amplified by his power, echoed through the mountains on the evening wind. From Kong Guli to Kong Yu, and even to the disciples scattered across the peak, everyone pondered his words.

'Obey which Daoist Master's command?'

'The Profound Peak Gate of Shanji… but if we have no Shanji, no mountain… are we still the Profound Peak Gate?'

But their bodies reacted faster than their thoughts. Like wheat before a scythe, they all fell to their knees, their voices joining in a chorus.

“The Profound Peak Gate respectfully obeys the Daoist Master’s command!”

Li Chenghui moved to help him up, but Kong Guxi bowed again. “The Daoist Master helped us relocate our people and gave us a place to shelter. The Profound Peak Gate is eternally grateful! We have no way to repay this debt…”

The others, lost and forlorn, repeated his words amid choked sobs. Only then did Kong Guxi rise, his voice thick with gratitude. “Thank you for making this trip, sir. If there is any news from Shanji, please inform us at once. We will immediately move the few dozen people we left behind, so as not to cause any delays or misunderstandings.”

Li Chenghui gave him a complicated look, then nodded and departed on the wind. The moment he was gone, Kong Qiuyan slumped to the ground. Kong Xiaxiang, a young man with reddened eyes, shot to his feet, his face a mask of agitation. He stormed toward the hall and slammed the doors open with a thunderous bang.

Kong Guxi, who had been hunched over, suddenly exploded into motion. He took a single step and seized the young man’s robes, yanking him around. The sect master’s face was a mask of fury, like that of a raging lion.

“What do you mean by that,” he roared, “what do you mean! Speak! What… do you mean!”

His voice was like a thunderclap, extinguishing every magic lamp in the hall and plunging the room into darkness. Faced with his sect master’s blazing eyes, Kong Xiaxiang’s defiant glare melted away. He gritted his teeth. “Reporting to the Sect Master, this junior was going to relay the order.”

Only then did Kong Guxi release him, his voice now a hoarse rasp. “It is not safe for you to go out now. Remain on this peak. Do not go anywhere. We will reassess in a few days.”

The eldest among them, Kong Guli, had watched the entire exchange without a word. Only Kong Yu, weeping quietly, stumbled out into the night and vanished into the darkness, a man whose nature had always been to pity himself.

After a long while, Kong Guxi stepped out of the hall. The lamps outside had gone out as well. He looked up at the sky.

He realized there was no moon tonight. A bleak wind rustled through the forest, and the entire mountain was steeped in blackness. His disciples stood on either side, their faces swallowed by the night, their features indistinct. It seemed to him that they were all trembling.
