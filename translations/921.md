# Chapter 921: The Situation Gradually Settles

Chi Buzi accepted the Profound Blade of the Dao's Exhortation to the Yin Soul, his expression serene and deferential. A thousand speculations flashed through his mind, but he knelt obediently and said respectfully,

"I will certainly not fail Your Excellency's expectations!"

Shaohui said softly,

"There are no expectations. This is merely a reward for your merits, a path to survival."

"This subordinate understands!"

Chi Buzi replied submissively. He saw Dangjiang, who was standing to the side, raise his head and ask cautiously,

"I noticed the residence is... much quieter. May I ask why...?"

Shaohui's vermilion lips parted with a faint sigh.

"There has been a change in the celestial phenomena. The Wu Earth has brightened, and a great event has occurred in the lower realm. We have been ordered to observe the signs, to guard against any True Monarchs or even higher-level beings from taking action. Thus, many of our fellow Daoists are not in residence."

As soon as she spoke, Chi Buzi's lowered eyes narrowed slightly, his heart chilled.

'Wu Earth... Luoxia... It seems a True Monarch has personally intervened in the conflict between north and south... I wonder which one from Luoxia it could be...'

Chi Buzi was based overseas, but he had missed none of the news from the mainland. He had numerous channels for gathering information, and a cold dread crept into his heart.

'I knew the north-south conflict was a bottomless pit—anyone who got involved would meet a bad end. But I never imagined a True Monarch would appear in person... No wonder!'

'Even when Lou Xing staked his life-mandate to beg Xueyang to remain in Qinling, drawing the attention of countless paths and cultivators to observe the law and probe the truth of Luoxia's Xueyang... even that barely caused a ripple in the face of this great tide. I never thought the north-south conflict would escalate to this degree!'

His heart was ice.

'Who is this True Monarch from Luoxia waiting for... The Taizhu? The one from the heavens above? Lady Valley Water... or perhaps one of the two remaining from the Lesser Yang?'

The thought had barely crossed his mind when he heard Shaohui speak softly from her high seat.

"However, there is no need to be overly anxious. We observed closely. In the end, no conflict broke out. Otherwise, things would not be as they are now."

Chi Buzi quickly seized the opening, speaking respectfully,

"Exactly! During the conflict over the Jade True path to enlightenment in the Northern Sea, the celestial phenomena were chaotic, and no one in the world could see clearly. Only a few of us with higher cultivation bases, who had also achieved a Life Divine Ability, had some inkling. Word gradually spread. Now, several great cultivators are discussing it, calling it the 'True Unification Transformation,' and everyone is awaiting the final outcome..."

Though he said this to fish for information, he wasn't wrong. The result of that great battle would determine the future of the Jade True path. Although more and more people were cultivating the Jade True, the various clans were all waiting for a clear result before deciding whether to send their true core disciples onto this Daoist tradition. There were even those of the Jade True tradition, like Zhusheng, who probably inspected their white jade with Pristine Water and golden stone every day, terrified of receiving bad news.

Lu Jiangxian, however, had no ability to peer into the heavens beyond. He wouldn't even spare a glance at Luoxia, where the Wu Earth Golden Core resided, let alone study the outcome of a battle between True Monarchs. Naturally, there was no relevant news from the heavens. In response to his query, Shaohui merely shook her head and smiled.

"Unless something world-shattering occurs, even if there is a result, it won't be seen for several years."

Her answer was perfectly watertight, forcing Chi Buzi to lower his head. He had hoped to glean the heavens' stance from her words. Having failed, he immediately fell silent.

This had been a long-standing doubt of his. Although the heavens were undoubtedly ruled by the Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang, this place didn't resemble an Immortal Mansion at all. When Chi Buzi had mentioned Du Qing, the Zhengao—clearly a high-ranking figure—had referred to him as 'that True Monarch who cultivates Pristine Water'.

'Yet, the Immortal Lord established his residence here. This place must have an origin far older than the Immortal Mansion. Perhaps even the Immortal Lord is just one member of the heavens!'

He knew this place was governed by various bureaus. The woman before him cultivated the Lesser Yin, but in Dangjiang's words, she was merely an immortal maiden of the Lesser Yin bureau...

'This, too, is a bureau, which means there might be at least one other True Monarch of the Lesser Yin's position in the heavens!'

The path of the Lesser Yin had been hidden for many years. According to Chi Buzi's memory, aside from the Daoist tradition in Western Jizhong where the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao's mountain gate was located, it was rarely heard of elsewhere...

Chi Buzi didn't have time to dwell on it. He quickly bowed and said,

"Time is short, and I must not delay the heavens' affairs... However, caution must come first. I wish to entrust my belongings to Immortal Officer Dangjiang for safekeeping and retrieve them once I am within the formation!"

His reasoning was sound. After all, he was going to Penglai. Who knew what strange techniques that grotto-heaven possessed? It was best to avoid risks if possible. Although Shaohui knew nothing of Penglai, she understood his caution and nodded lightly.

"Very well."

"Thank you..."

Before he could finish, Shaohui waved him away. Chi Buzi rose, and Dangjiang immediately moved to follow, but Shaohui stopped him, keeping him in the courtyard.

Dangjiang said nothing, but with Chi Buzi's matter resolved, he was clearly in a good mood. He sidled up with a smile.

"Your Excellency..."

Shaohui shook her head silently and asked,

"Chi Buzi is returning this time, and his future is uncertain. But he has rendered a service, and you will benefit from it. I have already reported to Immortal General Zhengao that you are well-versed in matters of high sacrifice and have a good understanding of the lower realm..."

Dangjiang perked up instantly, nodding repeatedly. Zhengao had mentioned a reward a few days ago.

"It is all thanks to Your Excellency's guidance! This lowly one is endlessly grateful..."

Shaohui smiled.

"If you're going to say that, shouldn't you first repay me for that basket of golden Moon Laurel branches?"

Dangjiang was just being polite. The very thought of the branches made his heart bleed. He stammered, his face mournful,

"This... How can this be calculated... To this day, this subordinate only has two or three hundred merits to his name..."

Shaohui shook her head with a smile.

"I won't tease you. You are to be promoted to an immortal officer in charge of sacrificial rites, in another realm... The official edict has not yet arrived, but if you wait, you should have some good days ahead."

Dangjiang was overjoyed. He kowtowed in satisfaction, then immediately began asking about the details with curiosity and delight. He was such a chatterbox that the woman quickly grew annoyed and found an excuse to send him away.

Lu Jiangxian had been standing in the hall from beginning to end, watching quietly.
This arrangement for Dangjiang wasn't just a response to his frequent complaints; it was also part of his own plans.

'When Li Ximing seized Tangdao Mountain, he killed a Merciful One named Huakong. Although his body was destroyed by Li Ximing and returned to the Buddhist Land, he was slain by a Talisman Seed. That wisp of True Spirit was naturally recorded on the Name Ascending Stone.'

In other words, with a single thought, Lu Jiangxian could instantly summon Hua Kong into the mirror!

He wasn't the only one. Li Ximing had also killed one on Caishan, but that was right under a True Monarch's nose, with them staring intently. That Merciful One was also utterly worthless, so Lu Jiangxian hadn't made a move.

Giving Dangjiang this position was also in preparation for this matter.

'In the future, the north and south will have direct contact. The Buddhist cultivators are not united, which is a perfect opportunity to profit from the chaos, cultivate a few of my own people, and ease the pressure on the Li family...'

'As for the Merciful Ones, the more I can secretly record, the better. But I can't just go around killing them at will. It's not a major issue right now. The personnel I choose to summon into the mirror must be elites, not just numerous. Even if they aren't Maha, they should at least be at the Minghui or Five-Eyed level—Merciful Ones with high status and power!'

...

Moongaze Lake.

Purple-gold profound pillars stood upon the island, wreathed in mist and carved with arcane patterns. Cultivators moved among them, their presence imposing. In the very center, the inner array glowed with a hazy purple light, its pale yellow floor tiles reflecting the leaping flames.

A Daoist Master in white-gold robes clapped his hands together, his face alight with joy. He slapped the alchemy furnace heavily. A deep gray radiance surged up and coiled around the furnace. The elephant-head spout opened wide, spitting out a plume of gray-black gas.

The smoke dissipated. Within the cavern-dwelling, the sound of a trickling stream could be heard. Li Ximing opened a jade box, and seven medicinal pills fell out one by one, landing softly on the delicate white cushion inside.
'Hooo...'

Seeing the seven pills, Li Ximing let out a breath of relief.

He had long known that 'Pit Water' and 'Bright Yang' were not very compatible and had been reminded several times. But only when he actually began refining the pills did he truly feel the discord between them.

'Fortunately, my skills are superb, and I used True Fire instead of the Bright Yang Purple Flame. Only then could I maintain control of the situation...'

He had previously anticipated a yield of eight or nine pills. Even with the conflict between the Daoist traditions, he had still managed to produce seven. This was more than enough to meet the other party's request for six.
He looked into the box. Each pill was etched with the rugged patterns of mountains and rivers. A light, ethereal aroma wafted out, carrying the faint sound of water. He quickly closed the lid to prevent the spiritual atmosphere from affecting the pills.

Serpent Water Dao-Hanging Powder cleared the mind, sharpened the senses, and advanced one's Daoist cultivation. In Li Ximing's opinion, wasting a Purple Mansion Realm-level Cangzhou Serpent Scale for such minor effects was simply not worth it. However, the other party's Daoist tradition must have another, more wondrous use for it. They had simply ordered Li Minggong to come and lead a team to Qize.

With that, he teleported, landing on Gardenia Scenery Mountain. At the foot of the mountain, the purple flame spiritual vein chimed. His spiritual sense swept out. Li Zhouwei's Grand Ascension was bobbing in the purple flames, shimmering with light, while cultivators from the Purple Smoke Gate worked to repair it nearby.

"Where has Minghuang gone?"

He asked casually. Immediately, Ding Weizeng descended onto the mountain and said respectfully,

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, Daoist Master Minghuang has entered Mount Dali."

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. He acknowledged with a grunt and asked,

"How are the river banks?"

Ding Weizeng replied with utmost respect,

"The opposite bank has been occupied by the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple. In the span of three nights, countless commoners have surged south, covering the entire Baijiang Creek region. They are spreading their teachings far and wide, erecting innumerable temples."

Li Ximing shook his head.

"They always know how to be disgusting."

With the migration of hundreds of thousands of Buddhist followers, the fate of Baijiang Creek was sealed. Even if they reclaimed the land one day, unless they resorted to a full-scale massacre, it would take fifty to a hundred years to eradicate the Buddhist influence.

'They just have to go around in circles, hiding behind the banner of this Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple. I don't know which sect they belong to, or what Daoist tradition they covet...'

The opposite bank had made no further moves. It seemed they had no intention of pushing south for now, which was a good thing. As he mused, Ding Weizeng spoke again.

"There is one more matter to report. A Demon beast has arrived from the Southern Borderlands... He was escorted by people from Azure Pond and calls himself Yan Hu."

"Ah, so it's him."

Yan Hu was one of his own subordinates. Li Ximing beckoned.

"Have him come up."

A man with a broad face and black hair, wrapped in a dark robe, ascended from below. Seeing Li Ximing, he called out,

"This subordinate greets Your Excellency! It has been long. This subordinate has missed you terribly..."

Li Ximing couldn't be bothered with pleasantries. He just wanted to hear good news. He waved his hand.

"What have you found?"

Yan Hu quickly bowed.

"Reporting to Your Excellency! Thanks to your reputation and borrowing your divine ability, this subordinate passed through the great mountains of the Piaoren Kingdom and searched the demon kingdoms west of Piaoren, beneath the Great Western Plateau. After many inquiries, I found a Demon King in the Xipo Kingdom who hopes to gain some benefits from the Daoist Master."

"That Demon King cultivates 'Auspicious Qi' and calls himself the Great Suopo King. He possesses two types of Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resources and one portion of Purple Mansion spiritual water, but he requires medicinal pills... He wishes to ask Your Excellency to refine them for him."

Li Ximing frowned. From the sound of it, the other party clearly didn't trust a mere Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, not even revealing the names of the resources. He felt a pang of disappointment. Yan Hu watched his expression and added in a low voice,

"He said this pill is extremely difficult to refine, with only one pill per furnace. But when he heard the Daoist Master is a 'Bright Yang' cultivator and would be beneficial for this pill, he eagerly sent me to ask."

Li Ximing was completely ignorant of that region and had never seen the pill formula, so he couldn't know its difficulty. He frowned.

"Only this one?"

At this, Yan Hu lowered his voice.

"In the lands east of the Piaoren Kingdom, there is an old Demon King, the Bifeng Mountain Lord. He is extremely powerful, named Can Lufu, and is also skilled in alchemy. He has been widely befriending fellow Daoists in recent years, and many Demon beasts from the Southern Borderlands seek him out... so he isn't desperate for alchemy services."

Hearing this name, Li Ximing tossed the cup in his hand aside as if it were bad luck. His gaze turned icy, but he said nothing.

"But past the Piaoren Kingdom is the area below the Great Western Plateau. The Great Western Plateau's 'White Victory Palace' has a Purple Mansion Realm protector, a demonic cultivator who is one of the Bright Ones. He is exceptionally skilled at alchemy and acts fairly, so most of the Demon Kings there seek him out. Only the Great Suopo King is on bad terms with him... which is why..."

Li Ximing could only shake his head. He was still injured. How could he travel thousands of miles into the depths of the Southern Borderlands? Besides, he didn't know the extent of the enmity with the 'White Victory Palace' or if it was related to the pill... He had no desire to offend someone for no reason.

"Reply to him that I have important matters and it is inconvenient to travel. If he insists on the refinement... he can either come here, or he can wait a few years. You should bypass this Demon King for now and continue asking deeper in the region."

"Yes!"

Yan Hu answered respectfully and continued,

"Regarding the spiritual fire Your Excellency instructed me to find, I also gathered information. There are two confirmed locations. One is with the master of the Piaoren Kingdom, who is an immortal cultivator. The other is with a Demon King by the Southern Sea. Both of them treasure their spiritual fires... and have no intention of trading them."

Li Ximing shook his head and asked,

"What are their cultivation levels?"

This question startled Yan Hu. He dropped to his knees.

"This lowly one does not know... I do not know!"

His mind raced, and he quickly added,

"Also... I also heard that the high-ranking figures of Southern Songzhou Luoshe and the Great Konghai Temple all possess spiritual fires! In the past, a great fire-attribute Demon failed their breakthrough and perished near the Piaoren Kingdom. Several clusters of spiritual fire escaped. Someone must have secretly kept them!"

The one in Southern Songzhou Luoshe was undoubtedly Jiao Zhongzi. The one at the Great Konghai Temple was certainly in the hands of that old Maha. Both would be extremely difficult to obtain. Li Ximing nodded, having a clearer picture now. He said in a low voice,

"Investigate further!"

The Demon beast scurried off. Li Ximing felt a headache coming on.

'Not everyone is as generous as the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, where one person offers to give you this and another offers to give you that. Everyone else hoards their treasures... It seems I have no choice but to make that trip.'

He immediately set his itinerary.

'First, I'll go to the Qunyi region and open that unknown cavern-dwelling to see what treasures it holds. Then, I'll head to the Piaoren Kingdom area to look into the spiritual fire.'

He took a step, returning to the array. He closed his eyes and his consciousness soared into the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. An incredibly dense wave of Spiritual Qi washed over him. He retrieved a pill from his sleeve. It was snow-white and inscribed with the pattern of a Qilin.

"The situation is changing. It seems I can't afford to be frugal. I'll take this Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill, which excels at healing the physical body, and repair this lingering injury. I must hurry and set out!"
