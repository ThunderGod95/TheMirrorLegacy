# Chapter 829: Unraveling Doubts

Li Ximing scanned the area for a moment, and once he was certain Tinglan had departed, he activated the Treasure Elephant Cauldron to begin refining the pills. A torrent of Immeasurable Water and Fire coiled beneath the cauldron as a host of spiritual herbs flew inside in sequence, melting one by one.

The recipe for the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill required the spiritual ingredients to be refined 18,600 times by the Immeasurable Water and Fire. This particular flame was not only the catalyst for alchemy but also an ingredient itself. He drew out a separate strand of azure-blue spiritual fire and fed it into the cauldron.

Under normal circumstances, this would have been an agonizingly tedious task. The Immeasurable Water and Fire was never meant for alchemy; much like Merging Fire, it was relentless, threatening to burn the ingredients to ash. With another portion of the flame already inside the cauldron as an ingredient, it was like dropping a hot coal into a cotton quilt.

By his own estimation, relying solely on his own efforts would allow him to complete only one or two refinement cycles per hour. The entire process would take two to four years—an immense amount of labor. This was only feasible because he had grown accustomed to arduous and repetitive alchemy from a young age. Anyone else would likely have taken much longer.

However, Li Ximing possessed the Valley Wind Guide-Fire technique, an art that could refine True Essence and granted him exceptional control over flames. As he put it to the test, he found the process surprisingly effortless, leaving him with enough spare attention to monitor the True Fire in his other cauldron.

Once the spiritual liquid in the cauldron had undergone all 18,600 refinements, he kneaded the entirety of the spiritual flames into the mixture. At the bottom of the cauldron, a hazy, grey substance began to form—the first sign of Valley Water.

Li Ximing gently nurtured it with the Immeasurable Water and Fire. When he checked the time, he was surprised to find that less than half a year had passed.

‘Alchemy methods like the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction are actually quite suitable for me.’

Meanwhile, the River-Heart Cauldron had turned a fiery, incandescent red, and waves of dense medicinal fragrance began to waft from it, signaling that the pills were about to form. Li Ximing quickly freed a hand and unleashed a brilliant glow.

*Hum!*

A small, exquisitely detailed celestial gate sprang from his palm. Adorned with dragon banners, phoenix carriages, and intricate carvings, it hovered within the cave residence, flooding the space with a blinding light. It was the physical manifestation of his divine ability, Audience with the Celestial Gate!

The moment Audience with the Celestial Gate appeared, a torrent of iridescent light from the divine ability surged forth, cascading like a waterfall. It clung to the walls of the entire cave, forming a seal that isolated all sound and fragrance from the outside world.

Li Ximing knew this pill was no small matter and had to be handled with the utmost care. He pushed his divine ability to its full power, suppressing everything in the vicinity. After a quick scan of the Great Void confirmed there were no prying eyes and that Tinglan had not returned, he finally turned his attention to the cauldron, his other hand still resting on the Treasure Elephant Cauldron.

After all, while the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire could be trusted to gently nurture a pill on its own, the Immeasurable Water and Fire possessed no such patience. He could not step away and let it finish unattended as he had before.

*Crack!*

A dense network of fissures, like a spiderweb, suddenly appeared on the side of the River-Heart Cauldron and spread rapidly up its surface. Li Ximing pressed down with his divine ability as a layer of Bright Yang spiritual qi surged forth to stabilize the vessel. A sharp, resonant clang echoed through the cave.

*BOOM!*

The cave shook as if struck by lightning. The deafening roar was followed by an explosion of silver-white radiance. Several points of light shot out from the cauldron, darting through the brilliance, but how could they possibly escape the search of a divine ability? A look of delight washed over Li Ximing’s face as he retrieved a jade box from his sleeve.

"Come!"

Instantly, the torrent of silver-white light flowed like water into the soft lining of the jade box. All fragrance and color vanished in that same moment, leaving only three pills, each the size of a longan, resting inside.

The pills were a milky white, their surfaces etched with fine, silver patterns resembling Moon Laurel leaves. Wisps of silver-white light swirled around them, twinkling like three brilliant stars in the dim cave, their light pulsing softly. It was a captivating sight.

Li Ximing dared not touch them with his hands, nor did he risk using his spiritual qi to handle them directly. Instead, he conjured a gentle breeze of spiritual energy to lift them for a careful inspection.

‘Breaks through cultivation bottlenecks, calms the spirit, nourishes the physical body with the pure essence of the cold moon, increases lifespan… and holding it in the mouth grants the protection of a strand of Supreme Yin energy…’

Li Ximing didn't follow rigid pill recipes. Unlike ordinary pills, whose effects were known before they were even crafted, the properties of this fortuitous pill could only be deduced from its fragrance and the sensations he experienced during its creation.

‘The bottleneck-breaking effect of this pill is decent, but unremarkable for my Bright Yang cultivation. Still, it is a spirit pill of the Purple Mansion Realm. As for nourishing the body with the pure essence of the cold moon… it's useless for my Bright Yang physique.’

‘The increase to one's lifespan, however, is exceptionally rare. It has the faint aura of a fate-aspected pill—the first of its kind I've seen in this life. The final protective effect is something I can't quite decipher yet.’

‘Regardless, it is superior to any other pill I have refined in my entire life. Perhaps the completed Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill might compare, but next to this, all others are but common trifles.’

He admired his creation with satisfaction. The bottleneck-breaking and lifespan-increasing properties alone were enough for him to treasure it immensely. A smile spread across his face.

"If the Xi family of the Chunyi Dao Gate, who cultivate the path of Supreme Yin, knew I possessed this spirit pill, wouldn't their eyes pop out of their heads? Nourishing the body with the pure essence of the cold moon and a mouthful of Supreme Yin energy… the Xi family would probably weep with joy."

‘With a sacred medicine of the Supreme Yin affinity in my possession, the Chunyi Dao Gate… I must find a way to contact them.’

Li Ximing had access to a virtually inexhaustible supply of Supreme Yin moonlight essence. Even with some losses during refinement, crafting spirit pills of the Supreme Yin affinity was a simple matter for him. He closed the lid of the jade box, and the cool, serene light vanished, plunging the cave back into darkness, illuminated only by the flickering colors of the Immeasurable Water and Fire.

His expression grew serious as he surveyed the cave, his mind racing with caution.

‘Having refined a sacred medicine of the Supreme Yin dao, a celestial phenomenon should have manifested, altering the spiritual aura of this area. Although I've used my divine ability to suppress and seal it, that aura doesn't just disappear. The moment I release the seal, I can't have Moon Laurel flowers suddenly blooming over the ocean. That would be impossible to explain away.’

Even in the desolate outer seas, Li Ximing remained ever-vigilant of watchful eyes. He rummaged through his storage bag and retrieved a luminous white flower.

This was a Suncrest Flower, a spiritual item of the Supreme Yang Dao he had received as a gift upon reaching the Purple Mansion Realm. It wasn't particularly valuable, but it was rare. A brilliant light flared between his brows, and as a purple flame erupted, the solar spiritual item dissolved into motes of light and vanished.

"That should be enough to obscure the phenomenon."

With that, he released his divine ability. Outside, the moon was bright and the stars were sparse, but there were no other unusual signs.

He sealed the cave once more with his divine ability and cast a pained glance at the heavily cracked River-Heart Cauldron, muttering to himself.

"This thing is useless now. It's more sentimental than practical. Repairing it would mean recasting it entirely, and it just wouldn't be the same."

He put it away. With one hand maintaining control over the fire, he took out the Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass and began to read. Three months passed before he finally sensed a faint disturbance outside the cave. A closer look confirmed it was Tinglan. Not wanting to disturb him, she was waiting patiently outside.

Li Ximing, guessing that the time was right, sent a message for her to enter. A few dozen breaths later, she appeared inside the cave, having carefully navigated her way through the earth with an escape technique.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing?"

Li Ximing smiled and nodded in greeting. "The refinement is complete!"

Tinglan had expected she might be needed to lend a hand and was slightly taken aback by his words. She thought to herself with a hint of shock:

‘It seems I've underestimated this Daoist Master Zhaojing… He just broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, yet his skill in alchemy seems poised to surpass even that of old Daoist Master Sumian. Truly remarkable. Then again… how could the first Daoist Master to rise under the watch of the Immortal Clan be anything ordinary?’

‘Sumian is from the Comprehending Profundity lineage, and he’s an old man who appears warm on the surface but is cold-blooded to the core—he cannot be trusted. Hengxing is far too calculating, and I cannot afford to be indebted to her. Tianhuo is too playful; a task that should take a year, she would drag out for five. Old Daoist Master Shen Yuming is getting on in years. Li Ximing, on the other hand, has protected Profound Peak time and again. He is clearly a man who honors his word—loyal and sincere. If I need pills refined in secret in the future, his help will be indispensable.’

‘It's just a shame he follows the Bright Yang path… who knows what he will become in the future. I still have that information about the Life Divine Ability. I wonder if it’s the right time to tell him.’

Composing herself, she studied him for a moment and smiled. "Daoist friend, you are a true saint of alchemy. I have underestimated you time and again. My sincerest apologies!"

"Not at all!"

With a gentle wave of his hand, the Treasure Elephant Cauldron, which had been resting over the fire, shrank until it was the size of a small incense burner. He held it in his hand and said with a smile, "Please!"

The two of them departed the cave. Tinglan summoned a purple cloud carriage, and the rabbit Demon pulled back the curtain, inviting him to board.

Li Ximing, slightly surprised, took a seat inside the celestial carriage. The interior was quite plain and simple. An incense burner in the center held two smoldering pieces of golden, soft incense. Holding the Treasure Elephant Cauldron, Li Ximing remained perfectly composed.

Tinglan remained silent for a moment, gathering her thoughts before she spoke. "A few years ago, I sought out Yehui. He was cultivating in the Southern Sea. I asked him about a certain matter, which I later confirmed with Zhu Gong. It concerns Kong Haiying."

"Back then, the person who entered seclusion at the Profound Peak mountain gate to attempt a breakthrough was, without a doubt, Kong Haiying."

Li Ximing froze. He had personally verified it at the time; the aura from within the sealed cave was that of Fu En. He couldn't help but fall into deep thought. Tinglan continued.

"I… went to see Kong Guxi. They had misidentified the soul lamps of Fu En and Kong Haiying. Kong Haiying's seclusion was far longer than any of us realized. The person who made several appearances to meet with the Kong Clan juniors was actually Fu En in disguise. And the artifact that Fu En blood-refined… it belonged to Kong Haiying."

Li Ximing’s expression grew grim. Tinglan pressed on. "It is no surprise that you were mistaken, Daoist Friend Zhaojing, because the information they had was wrong. The only elder present who had actually met Kong Haiying was Kong Guli, but his memory was erased. The other elders had all perished over the years. Senior Changxi overlooked only one old man named Kong Yu. Fortunately for the plan, he took his own life on the spot."

Her words were laced with a chilling coldness, her eyes betraying a deep shock. "Senior Changxi made these arrangements long ago, swapping their identities. Perhaps it was to prepare a scapegoat. Perhaps. After all, Kong Haiying had once been to Encompassing Profoundity."

Her words were intentionally vague, but Li Ximing silently understood the unspoken implications.

Yehui had met Kong Haiying in person. What good would a substitute be? Yehui would have seen through it immediately. That left only one terrifying possibility.

Daoist Master Changxi had coldly delivered Kong Haiying directly into Yehui's hands. He had even been kind enough to help Yehui and Li Ximing maintain the illusion that the victim was Fu En.

Though Li Ximing was not as adept at such schemes, the truth was now laid bare before him, and he was not so naive as to miss it.

‘After Changxi's death, Yehui was bound to bring his blade down on the Kong Clan. Kong Haiying had to die. His death wasn't just about the blood feud for killing his wife and exterminating his clan; it was also tied to the secrets of the Encompassing Profoundity lineage. If he remained alive, any power that took in the Kong Clan would live in unease, unwilling to offend Yehui.’

‘Only with Kong Haiying's death would Yehui be willing to sheathe his blade and reconsider whether continued persecution of the Kong Clan was worth the effort. Yehui's attitude toward me improved so dramatically back then because he believed I had made a concession. This was the reason!’

‘Changxi’s choice was cold and calculated from the very beginning. Kong Haiying was right there, in seclusion at the Profound Peak mountain gate. If he could achieve his breakthrough in the window of time that Changxi's death had bought, then all would be well. If not, he would become Changxi’s peace offering to Yehui.’

‘The identity swap was likely a casual contingency at first, a move to give Profound Peak flexibility and to confuse outsiders, lowering their guard concerning Kong Haiying. Changxi never anticipated that Kong Haiying would fail to overcome his inner demons, that he would remain trapped for so long and ultimately betray his hopes.’

‘Later, when that tactic had outlived its primary purpose, it was repurposed to strengthen my conviction—after all, from my perspective, it was Fu En who had died, while Kong Haiying was still somewhere out there, with a great chance of breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm.’

‘No wonder I felt that cultivator's foundation was so profound at the time, not at all like a guest elder such as Fu En. It was Kong Haiying himself!’

‘So, in the end, the elusive Kong Haiying, whose whereabouts were a mystery, was personally delivered by my own hands to his execution.’

A chilling shock gripped Li Ximing's heart, leaving him speechless for a long while. He finally let out a deep, heavy sigh. "Daoist Master Changxi… regardless of the extent of his powers, everything he did after his death—be it cruel, cold, manipulative, or deceitful—was for the preservation of his clan. He can face his ancestors without an ounce of shame."

Tinglan could see that he had pieced together the entire sequence of events. She spoke in a low, haunting voice. "As for what he felt for Kong Haiying and Kong Yu, whether he wept in sorrow or burned with guilt, only the senior himself knew in his heart. Did Kong Haiying know what was happening during his seclusion? Did he silently consent? His failure to overcome his inner demons… is it possible Senior Changxi had a hand in that as well?"

Her question sent a fresh wave of ice through Li Ximing's veins. He answered in a low voice, "Daoist Master Changxi… though he manipulated me a great deal, he also taught me much. Ultimately, he is worthy of respect."

Tinglan’s gaze was fixed on the space before them. Two faint, autumn-yellow lines lit up at the corners of her eyes. She rested her chin on her hand, her eyes looking out the window as she spoke softly. "He is indeed worthy of respect. After all, those in the Purple Mansion Realm who have not yet cultivated a Life Divine Ability often have many attachments to the mortal world. Once a Life Divine Ability is achieved, especially one of the Earth Virtue, they slowly let everything go. Sect, clan… they become mere tools. Lineage, master, and disciple… they become mere rungs on the ladder to immortality."

"Certain paths of the Purple Mansion Realm… their cultivators are either single-mindedly focused on attaining immortality or become uncontrollably violent and tyrannical. The only word to describe them is 'fearsome'—Daoist Friend Zhaojing, World's Radiance is not a divine ability with a good reputation."

The woman’s voice echoed within the celestial carriage. The incense burner in the center released a cool, crisp fragrance, the same scent that lingered about her, evoking the feeling of an autumn wind sweeping through a rice field. Suddenly, Tinglan’s mask of clever pleasantries fell away, revealing a flicker of genuine worry.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, you broke through your state of ignorance in a mere few years and then shattered the chains of limitless illusion. That is an incredible feat. But that is the karma of one who compromises and endures. To see into another's heart is to confront your own inner demons; the two are entirely different. Before the Grand Ancestor of Wei attained the Dao, the path of Bright Yang was not always so 'bright.' Traces of the Qilin and Cicada still remain to this day. Are you truly confident that you can grasp a Life Divine Ability?"
