# Chapter 662: The Whole Pill Dao

Li Yuanqin clasped his hands, his voice low.

"Brother Fubo, you may not be aware," he began, "but that Eastern Yue barbarian, Fei Luoya, though ostensibly one of the Ning family's people and claiming our Li Clan seized his territory, still holds some lingering loyalty to my father. He deliberately revealed his whereabouts to me in private..."

He recounted the sequence of events that had led to his discovery, presenting his case in a clear, logical manner. Each point was supported by evidence. A smile of dawning comprehension spread across Chi Fubo's face, but inwardly, he remained unconvinced. After hearing the full story, Li Yuanqin added softly, "There are still those among the Purple Mansion cultivators who are friendly to our cause... and Daoist Master Changxiao is a master of such schemes. Who's to say this wasn't his intention?"

Only then did a thoughtful expression flicker in Chi Fubo's eyes.

"Ultimately," Li Yuanqin concluded, "it's likely that one of the Purple Mansion masters used this situation to send me a signal, hoping we would intervene and deal a blow to the Si family."

"The situation is still developing, and many details remain unconfirmed. I will leave the final decision to you, Brother Fubo!"

He bowed and retreated. Chi Fubo nodded, watching him go before turning back to his desk.

'This is not a simple matter,' he thought, a knot of anxiety tightening in his gut. 'I fear it's a trap. And even if it isn't... why would Si Yuanli possibly concede? No matter how you look at it... Yuanqin is still maneuvering to take control of the Li Family...'

A wave of frustration washed over Chi Fubo. He couldn't bring himself to blame Li Yuanqin, though. It wasn't just him. The elders, like Chi Zhihu, and even many of Chi Fubo's own siblings were itching for action. He alone had been holding them back.

"It's far too soon."

Chi Fubo had reached a point where he could no longer satisfy the ambitions of those around him. Yet people like Li Yuanqin and Chi Zhihu were growing impatient.

'It's like a wild horse breaking its reins. If I can't stop it, I'll be the one thrown into the abyss and dashed to pieces!'

Li Yuanqin's proposal had starkly illuminated his precarious position, and a chill crept into his heart.

"I have read countless classics and always found my predecessors to be reckless, foolish, and impulsive. Now, acting myself, I find my hands are tied at every turn. Perhaps they acted not out of choice, but out of necessity."

Panic began to set in. He downed several cups of wine, but the image of Chi Xunxiao surfaced in his mind. His grip tightened on the jade cup, a bitter resentment rising within him.

"What terrible luck... Why did he have to be such a clever child! If only he'd feigned stupidity, or truly been a fool, I wouldn't be in this wretched position."

Pingya Island.

The golden light of dawn scattered across the lake's surface. Li Zhouwei rode the wind south until he reached the territory of Lijing Prefecture. The buildings here, clustered around the lake, were the oldest, with walls of gray brick and roofs of dark tile. The disciples who once filled the alleys were long gone, but several of the large stone houses were still maintained.

Sunlight dappled the stone steps as Li Zhouwei entered one of the houses, with the monk Kongheng following behind. In the center of a courtyard, a pool of water lay perfectly clear. He continued through to the rear hall, the clanking of chains echoing from within.

*Clang...*

The rear hall was a grim chamber of iron cells. The faint bleating of a goat could be heard. As Li Zhouwei stepped inside, he saw a completely naked boy kneeling on the floor. His face was covered in white scales as he sucked greedily at the neck of a fallen goat, whose cries were growing weaker.

Li Zhouwei watched his son, his expression unreadable. He stood in silence for a long time as the boy tore into the goat, devouring it raw. Kongheng, unable to bear the sight, closed his eyes and began chanting sutras.

The day after achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm , Li Zhouwei had come here with Kongheng to see his eldest son. They had examined him thoroughly but were utterly powerless to help.

Li Jiang'ao was not afflicted by some illusion that clouded his mind, nor was his soul disturbed. He simply lacked the consciousness of a normal person. There was no cure. Perhaps, after several hundred years of cultivation, he might develop a rudimentary, beast-like awareness.

'Look at him now. He can't even learn to read. How could he possibly accept a Talisman Seed?'

Li Zhouwei had even considered finding a remote mountain or a vast lake and releasing him to live on his own. But there were too many risks, too many taboos. He could not let him go. And so, year after year, he kept his firstborn son locked away in this cage, visited only by himself or Li Xuanxuan.

'Jiang'ao is like a beast. Jiangqian, though intelligent, has an extreme and deceitful nature... I fear none of my sons are of good character.'

Li Zhouwei's third sonpublicly his secondhad been born a few days ago. He was named Li Jianglong, and he too possessed golden eyes. But this time, Li Zhouwei felt little joy. He had only to look around to see that another of his consorts was already with child.

"Venerable Master," he said, turning.

Kongheng immediately looked over.

"You previously mentioned a method of suppression using the Supreme Yin ," Li Zhouwei said quietly. "I was wondering if we might try it, to see if I can sire a child *without* the golden eyes... I have heard that the sons of the Undefeated King of Brightness were all demons who were eventually subjugated. My children's eyes are like mine. If their fortune and virtue are shallow, I fear it will bring them ruin."

Kongheng gave him a thoughtful look and replied softly, "This humble monk will do his best to try."

Li Zhouwei nodded. He cast one last look at his eldest sonthe child in whom he had placed so many hopes while he was still in the wombthen turned and walked away. As he ascended the stone steps, the last glimmer of hope in his heart died.

He rode the wind back to the main hall on the island, where Kongheng discreetly took his leave. Li Qinghong and Li Xuanxuan were waiting inside. Seeing him arrive empty-handed, Li Qinghong flicked her sleeve, releasing the [Chongming Profound Insight Screen] to conceal the room.

"Where is Jiang'ao?" she asked gently.

For this round of bestowing the Talisman Seed, Li Xuanxuan had thought to let Li Jiang'ao participate, hoping some opportunity might arise for him even if he couldn't recite the incantations. But Li Zhouwei had returned alone.

"He is completely devoid of intellect," Li Zhouwei said gravely. "I fear he would only disturb the sacred treasure. It is best to forget it."

Seeing his resolve, Li Qinghong could only nod. "How many children are ready to receive a Talisman Seed this time?"

Li Zhouwei paused. "Quite a few, I'm afraid."

There were not many cultivators in the Zhou generation of the Li Clan, and only two who were having children. But after generations of accumulation, the number of mortals in the Zhou generation was vast. As a result, there was no shortage of children with spiritual apertures in the Jiangque generation. Their talents, however, had not yet manifested, making it impossible to distinguish between them.

Gathering all of them in the hall, teaching them the incantations one by one, and testing them individually was no longer as simple as it once had been. Moreover, as the clan grew in size and prominence, any large-scale activity risked attracting spies.

Li Xuanxuan voiced these concerns, and Li Zhouwei replied, "Now that the Immortal Mirror's spirit roams the Great Void, we can try altering the prayer. It might allow for a more discreet process."

***

The Great Void.

Lu Jiangxian's divine consciousness drifted, lingering for a long time over the lands of the Purple Smoke Gate.

Ever since he had gained the ability to roam the Great Void, he had made it a point to never probe directly into the headquarters of any immortal sect, preferring to observe from a distance. The breakthrough of the Purple Smoke Gate's new Purple Mansion cultivator was the most detailed and complete event of its kind he had witnessed.

He had even seen the agent from the underworld from afar and overheard their entire conversation.

'Daoist Master Zipei is dead.'

Contrary to the speculation of many Purple Mansion masters, Daoist Master Zipei, Kan Xuyu, was truly goneher soul scattered, with no chance of reincarnation.

'The Shen Clan and the Purple Smoke Gate are sending people everywhere to search for Zipei's reincarnation. It must be a bluff...'

After all, Zipei had been a formidable figure. Having a powerful cultivator with a metallic essence supposedly reincarnated and at large was a useful deterrent for both the Shen Clan and the Purple Smoke Gate.

"And the other peak Purple Mansion master, Daoist Master Zimu, vanished long ago. The Purple Smoke Gate has to resort to some trickery to maintain its standing."

But Lu Jiangxian had watched the entire ritual performed by the underworld agent and was certain that the 'True Qi' of the metallic essence had never appeared. This meant Daoist Master Zipei had never used it at all.

'Such a treasure... where could it be?'

With no immediate leads, Lu Jiangxian set the matter aside for now, making a mental note to remain vigilant. Another matter, however, came to mind.

'The dragons consuming lightning...'

He had been keeping a close eye on this phenomenon. He had even been present when Dongfang Heyun met Li Xizhi in the Eastern Sea. His Supreme Yin Profound Light had been aimed at the spirit cloud the entire time; had the dragon monarch made a move, Lu Jiangxian would have killed him without hesitation.

Though nothing had come of it, he was left with many questions.

'It's truly strange. Dongfang Heyun seems to have a favorable impression of Li Xizhi, and he has always been polite to Li Xuanfeng. Where does this come from? And that dragon child, Dingjiao, fawns over Li Zhouwei... It seems the entire dragon lineage is fond of the Li Clan.'

'Could it really be because of Emperor Gong of Wei?'

Lu Jiangxian didn't believe a word of Dingjiao's story. The Li Clan had seen its share of ups and downs. If the dragons truly had such a deep friendship with the Wei Li, protecting a few branches of the clan would have been a trivial matter for them.

He made a circuit of the Great Void, confirming that no Purple Mansion or Golden Core masters were spying on him, before returning to his perch on Mount Wu. Inside the grand array, he watched for a time as Li Ximing practiced the secret art, Jewel Steps.

"We of the Moongaze Li Clan, with reverence and offerings of pure wine, fine foods, and sacrificial meats, do humbly petition for the Profound Light for our descendants, that their fates may be settled and their spirits calmed for the path of cultivation... May their merits be proclaimed in due time, their faith rewarded, and upon the burning of this talisman, may their mortal selves be given unto the Supreme Yin."

The words from the mortal world reached his ears, and his consciousness snapped back from the Great Void to the lake below. On Pingya Island, within a hall shrouded by a screen of light, the prayer was being chanted, though no figures could be seen.

Lu Jiangxian accessed the records of his divine consciousness, instantly understood the situation, and swept his awareness across the lake region. A sense of relief washed over him.

'I've waited so long. The Jiangque generation is finally ready. I can bestow those Purple Mansion cultivation arts...'

Among the many techniques at his disposal, Lu Jiangxian was most partial to those of the 'Whole Pill Dao'. The *Golden Book of Houshu* was a true sixth-grade cultivation art, a full grade higher than the Li Clan's own *Radiant Essence Scripture*!

'The *Radiant Essence Scripture* is such an anomaly...'

It possessed a full nine secret arts, yet was only rated at the basic fifth-grade level for a Purple Mansion technique. Out in the wider world, this would be nonsensical. How could a technique with nine secret arts be a mere fifth-grade art? Only Lu Jiangxian, cheating with his immortal methods and metallic essence, could have written such a thing.

When it came to the secret arts for breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, the *Golden Book of Houshu* was naturally inferior to the *Radiant Origin Scripture*, which was born of the Bright Yang golden nature and immortal formulas. But it was by no means weak. It had five secret arts, and mastering them all would increase one's chances of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm by a full twenty-five percent.

'Furthermore, the Whole Pill Dao belongs to the Ancient Merging Dao lineage. While not excelling in combat, its practitioners can achieve feats far beyond those of cultivators at the same level. And what of a cultivator trained in a sixth-grade art?'

Whether in transformation, healing, array-breaking, or stealth, the  Whole Pill Dao was far superior to contemporary magical arts. Qiushui of the Golden Feather Sect was a practitioner of this path, and her divine abilities were so profound that she commanded universal respect.

The only drawback was that the technique was rather conspicuous. Fortunately, by the time a descendant could cultivate it to a significant level, the Li Clan would have its own Purple Mansion masters, making it much easier to conceal its origins.

'As for who shall receive the Talisman Seed...'

'The elder brother is fierce, the second is evil. Li Jiangqian's talent is undeniable, so he must receive a Talisman Seed to restrain this vicious beast. If I don't give him one, he will surely cause a great disaster in the future!'

Even in an empire as vast as the Wei, with multiple Golden Core masters presiding, bloodshed still stained the palace courts. How could Lu Jiangxian not take precautions? He had long ago designated a Talisman Seed for Li Jiangqian, a tightening hoop for this monster.

'The  Whole Pill art... I have already considered it, and he is not suitable. Nor should he cultivate the Bright Yang art any further. I fear it would only make him more wicked. One day, he might achieve a sudden epiphany, see through the follies of the mortal world, and a red-eyed white cicada would burst from his chest... and take flight. That would be no laughing matter...'

This was no idle fancy on Lu Jiangxian's part; it was a very real possibility. As Li Zhouwei's cultivation grew, eventually breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, the influence on his second son, Li Jiangqian, would become ever more profound.

His eldest son, Li Jiang'ao, was a lesser concern for now. Lacking intellect, he couldn't cultivate, and any changes in his condition would be centuries away.

With the lessons of the Wei kingdom fresh in his mind, Lu Jiangxian paid extremely close attention to the brothers Li Jiang'ao and Li Jiangqian, having considered every possibility since the day they were born.

'It would be best to give him this 'Li Fire' technique I obtained from the grotto-heaven. It is a sixth-grade art of Li Fire. Bright Yang and Li Fire are intertwined and mutually reinforcing. Nothing could be more suitable!'

The full name of this sixth-grade cultivation art was the *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun*. Its foundational stage was the 'Great Parting Scripture'. The fact that Anhuai Heaven had seen fit to include it in their collection was a testament to its power and quality.

'It has four secret arts, increasing one's chances by twenty percent. That's better than the vast majority of Purple Mansion techniques in the Jiangnan region.'

He embedded the *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun* into the Talisman Seed destined for Li Jiangqian, but did not bestow it immediately.

His divine consciousness roamed, circling the shores of the lake until it found a particular household in Lijing Town, a place he remembered from his past.

The house was not small; its ancestors had clearly known prosperity. But now, the red lacquer on the gates was almost completely peeled away, revealing the mottled brown wood beneath. The two stone lions at the entrance were covered in dust, obviously untouched for a long time.

Despite its faded glory, the household was clearly run with an iron fist. Everything was neat and orderly, a sign that the master of the house held himself to an exacting standard.

Lu Jiangxian's consciousness flew through the gates and into the main courtyard, where he found a young girl. With red lips and fair skin, dressed in a traditional blouse and skirt, she looked to be about six or seven years old.

'The timing is perfect.'

This child was the one Lu Jiangxian had chosen to receive the Talisman Seed, the one selected to cultivate the  Whole Pill art! He had taken notice of her on the day she was born and had simply been waiting for the Li Clan to conduct their ritual.

And in his divine sight, he could see a spiritual aperture slowly forming at the center of her brow, like a third eye, subtly drawing in the spiritual energy of the world. Lu Jiangxian praised inwardly:

'With her aperture at her brow, her soul is far stronger than a normal person's. At last, a child has appeared who can cultivate the *Shamanic Talisman Dao*... She is the perfect match for this sixth-grade *Golden Book of Houshu*... The ancient Whole Pill Dao has an affinity with shamanistic arts. It could not be a better fit!'
