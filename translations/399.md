# Chapter 520: Contact In Wubu Market

Qingdu Peak.

Li Yuanjiao was cultivating in seclusion, healing his wounds. However, the Blood Sun Fruit needed to be delivered to Li Xizhi in Wubu Market of Libu Prefecture. With uncertainties surrounding Situ Mo's movements, the Li Family decided to send Kongheng to fulfill the task.

Li Xijun briefly mentioned the matter, to which Kongheng nodded and solemnly put the treasure into his chest pocket. He was a man who took promises seriously, committed to fulfilling them even if they were at the cost of his life.

Li Xijun's eyelids twitched as he asked, "Master Monk... they can't trace you, right?"

Seeing Kongheng nod in affirmation, Li Xijun finally realized that his Dao lineage truly emphasized on keeping promises. He saw Kongheng off with an amused smile at the border.

Yet, as he watched him leave, he sighed.

"Those who cultivated the ancient method are simple and honest, but those Buddhist cultivators who practiced the new way are cunning... The two could not be more different."

With this thought, Li Xijun smiled wryly, adding, "Then again, my family is also known for our cunningness..."

Initially planning to fly back to Mount Qingdu, Li Xijun changed his mind.

"It's been a long time since I saw Ximing. I wonder if he's been fooling around and neglecting his cultivation... I better go remind him."

He made a sharp turn in mid-air and landed on Mount Wutu. The scenery was lush on Wutu, and outside the forest courtyard and Alchemy Pavilion, a woman awaited, dressed in white and wearing a veiled hat that was adorned with pearls and jade.

Upon seeing Li Xijun land, the woman quickly removed her hat and said softly, "An greets Senior."

Li Xijun paused briefly, recognizing her as An Zheyan's daughter, Li Ximing's new wife, and his sister-in-law. He lowered his gaze and replied, "Sister-In-Law, there's no need for such formality."

An nodded and said softly, "Since Brother-In-Law is here, I'll take my leave."

Li Xijun nodded and then stepped into the cave dwelling in the backyard. Inside, Li Ximing sat, swallowing a flame from the furnace. Upon seeing Li Xijun, he exclaimed with delight, "Come, come, come!"

Li Xijun's spiritual sense swept through the area, and he immediately understood the situation.

His voice was filled with astonishment as he asked, "You've... broken through to the eighth heavenly layer?"

Li Ximing laughed, waving his hands dismissively as he replied, "I've been accumulating my strength for a while, and just happened to break through on a whim!"

Though Li Ximing spoke casually and with pride, Li Xijun understood him and the effort behind his achievement. He was clearly waiting to be praised, so Li Xijun complimented him a few times, eliciting a laugh from him before adding, "Take another Talisman pill, and you'll be able to break through to the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and the Foundation Establishment will be just within your reach."

"Of course," Li Ximing replied with confidence.

With a serious tone, he continued, "Once Uncle Jiao emerges from seclusion, we can choose an island to settle down overseas! Leave the family to me; I can handle it!"

I know you're too lazy to go overseas, Li Xijun grumbled inwardly.

"I saw An waiting outside. While she has a good temper, you shouldn't take her for granted. The An Family members are talented; An Zheyan has worked hard and made significant contributions over the years. You can't let her down," he reminded Li Ximing.

"Yes... of course... I do treat her very well! I'm always nice. I couldn't meet her just now because I was refining pills," he explained.

Li Xijun nodded, hesitating for a moment before finally asking, "What about Meng Zhuoyun? How do you plan to deal with her?"

Li Ximing paused, suddenly looking a bit awkward as he replied softly, "I've tried to persuade her many times. She refuses to give up on revenge and stay with me... I guess I'll just send her away when the times come. There's no need for further discussion on this matter..."

Seeing Li Xijun frown, Li Ximing quickly added, "I haven't treated her unfairly! I've given her all the resources she needed and imparted all the alchemy knowledge she should know. When the time comes, everything will balance out, and we can part ways without owing each other."

Li Xijun shook his head in disbelief.

"You! You're truly heartless... I don't think that's what she's after!."

"That..." Li Ximing began, feeling a mix of shock and irritation from having his affair exposed by his brother.

"That's nonsense! Who do you think she is? Our relationship is purely physical," he said with a sigh.

Li Xijun glanced at him and gently reminded, "If you're going to let her leave, then make sure she doesn't take anything that has our family's seal away with her. We don't want trouble in the future."

"That's true," Li Ximing replied absent-mindedly. With no further comment, Li Xijun departed.

Li Ximing straightened up, noticing several paintings scattered across the courtyard. He picked them up, examined each one closely, and then set them aside.

He spat out Long Marching Fire Essence. Meng Zhuoyun caused only a brief flutter of emotions in his heart, which he quickly dismissed and quickly forgot.

Libu Prefecture, Wubu Market.

In just three months, Li Xizhi had established control over the entire market and organized its rules and regulations. He won over several shop owners who were rogue cultivators, then made things easier for the shops owned by Xiao, Yuan, and Yang Families.

"With Azure Pond's support, taking over this place is straightforward. No one dares to defy me."

If it were not for Azure Pond and the backing of three prominent clans, it would have taken Li Xizhi ten times longer to gain this level of control. Now, after giving just a few orders, he could focus on his own cultivation properly.

According to the sect's unspoken rules, he could now take over many marginal profits. Concerned about giving others leverage against him, Li Xizhi chose to hold off.

Due to this, visitors were rare in the market. Wubu was not a large market. The disciples from the peaks were wary of it, and direct disciples were not interested in it. Hence, only Li Xizhi and the relevant families were here.

The spiritual energy here is far inferior to that of Azure Pond, but we are free and relaxed here, without the need for constant worry.

As he pondered these thoughts, someone approached and cupped his fist respectfully.

"My lord, the records for Golden Tang Gate are here," he reported with a bow.

Li Xizhi took the document and flipped through it, quickly locating information on Situ Mo, the current apparent head of the Golden Tang's main lineage, who should be the last survivor of a lineage that had been wiped out long ago.

Originally, the Golden Tang Gate was run by the eldest son, Situ Li, who had marriage ties with Profound Peak Gate. After the founder, Situ Tang, died, his second son, Situ Nu, supported by the Golden Feather Sect, killed his elder brother and took control, achieving the Purple Mansion Realm.

After Situ Nu's death, the Golden Tang Gate fractured into several factions. In the end, control was restored to those in the first lineage, who were aligned with the Azure Pond Sect. Those in Situ Nu's lineage were slaughtered, leaving only Situ Mo as the only survivor.

How complicated.

Li Xizhi skimmed through the document. He could clearly see the traces of conflict between Azure Pond and Golden Feather. As for the repeated massacres and struggles with the Golden Tang Gate, that was merely a show between the two sects.

They were all forced to do this. Otherwise, they wouldn't have bothered to secretly shelter Situ Mo.

Li Xizhi felt a jolt of surprise and turned to his subordinate.

"Where is Situ Mo now? What mission has he accepted?"

"I heard he has taken on a mission to the Eastern Sea and may not return for several years," the man replied respectfully.

"Continue," Li Xizhi encouraged, and the man went on to explain, "According to the cultivators from the Han, Fu, and He families who visited the market, the Kong Family of Profound Peak has sent two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to an overseas market. They've taken control of two more islands and blocked the sea route, causing the Golden Tang Gate's population to dwindle by more than half."

"The relationship between Profound Gate and Golden Tang was once very good, with no conflicts. However, it has soured in recent years, leading to this situation. In response, Golden Tang Gate has dispatched Situ Mo," he added.

With this new insight, Li Xizhi took out a small letter and wrote a message to his family before sending it off.

Moments later, the old man returned with news that a monk wished to see him.

"A monk…?"

Li Xizhi was alarmed. He carefully inquired about the monk's appearance and confirmed it was indeed Kongheng. With a talisman ready in his hand, he left the sect to meet him.

The monk had fair skin, sharp eyes, a long face, and round ears. He greeted Li Xizhi solemnly, "Greetings, fellow Daoist. I have been entrusted by your esteemed family to deliver a treasured panacea."

Upon hearing the mention of a treasured panacea, Li Xizhi had already begun to piece things together.

However, Kongheng did not present it immediately. Instead, he studied Li Xizhi closely and said softly, "Please show me the jade pendant, fellow Daoist."

Quite a stubborn one!

Li Xizhi smiled. Though they had just met, both were cautious. Li Xizhi revealed the jade pendant that symbolized the direct lineage of the Li Family. After verifying his identity, Kongheng apologized and handed him a jade box.

Li Xizhi scanned the box with his spiritual sense, confirming that it did indeed contain the Blood Sun Fruit.

"Master Monk, please stay for a moment. The sword is about to be completed, and I would appreciate it if you could take it back with you," he said softly.

Kongheng nodded and departed, allowing Li Xizhi to breathe a sigh of relief.

The matter with Li Encheng has finally been resolved... Now, I'll head to Xuanyuan Market to establish a connection with him first.

With Situ Mo away in the Eastern Sea, Li Xizhi felt much more at ease. He handed over the other responsibilities to the two elder men and set off for Xuanyuan Market.

Xuanyuan Market was located near Mount Dongli, not far from Libu Prefecture. As Li Xizhi approached, mist rose around him, obscuring his appearance. Upon landing outside the market, an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator greeted him, asking, "Senior, you are…?"

Li Xizhi simply replied, "I am a rogue cultivator from the Mushroom Forest Plain, traveling here for now."

Since Li Xizhi came here for a personal matter, he could not use his identity as a member of Azure Pond and had to fabricate a random backstory instead. The Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator showed no surprise. He pulled out a round dharma artifact and said respectfully, "Please pass in a trace of true essence, Senior."

The devil plague had been rampant for some time, and major markets had taken precautions to prevent devil cultivators from entering, ensuring the safety of the markets from internal and external threats.

Li Xizhi nodded slowly, infused the artifact with his true essence, and watched as it immediately emitted a brilliant white light.

The cultivator's eyes widened in surprise.

"A cultivator practicing authentic techniques..."

Li Xizhi acknowledged him with a nod, dismissing the flattery as he accepted the jade token offered by the man. He stepped inside the bustling market and searched for a while before quickly locating the Enshui Alchemy Pavilion.

As soon as he entered, a servant approached. Li Xizhi waved his hand and said, "Please invite your shop manager to see me."

Despite having concealed his feathered robe and obscured his face, his calm demeanor and extraordinary presence commanded respect. The servant hurried off, and soon, a tall, thin man descended the stairs, dressed in a short coat.

He smiled and cupped his fist, introducing himself.

"I am Li Enxi. It's an honor to meet you, fellow Daoist."

Although Li Enxi was only in the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, he showed great courtesy to Li Xizhi.

Li Xizhi returned the politeness, following him into a secret chamber. Once inside, he removed his disguise and revealed his true identity.

Recognition flickered in Li Enxi's eyes right away.

"Ah, so you're Xizhi. My elder brother has told me about you and I've been expecting you."

Li Xizhi presented the jade box and said softly, "It's a small gift for our meeting. Please accept it."

Li Enxi took the box, and with a quick check through his spiritual sense, he understood its contents.

"Is your Li Family... from the Wei State?" he asked.

Li Xizhi nodded in response, and Li Enxi smiled warmly.

"So… you are from the main family. My brothers and I have suspected only the descendants of Wei State's Li Family could produce such talent."

His demeanor grew more enthusiastic as he added, "Considering our lineage, we trace back at least to Ancestor Mutian... But let's not dwell on that, as I don't want to make you uncomfortable."

Li Xizhi nodded modestly. Given their shared lineage spanning thousands of years, it was difficult to trace back now. Li Enxi had merely brought that up as a way to bring both of them closer.

Ultimately, Li Encheng needed a reliable clan, and the Li Family required a seasoned alchemist at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Li Xizhi understood this but maintained his polite demeanor.

Li Enxi leaned in and whispered, "My elder brother doesn't have much time left. The only path forward is to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. In the future, we will need more assistance from the main family."

Recognizing the conditions being laid out, Li Xizhi nodded politely and said, "Of course, but my family is weak, and I'm afraid we can't offer much help at this moment… There are certain matters where we will require your assistance, Senior."

"Of course," Li Enxi replied.

They exchanged glances, reaching a tacit agreement. Li Xizhi continued, "When the time comes, we will need Senior Encheng's help within the sect…"

"Yes."

Li Enxi paused, then took out a pill from his robe and smiled.

"Take a look."

Li Xizhi swept his spiritual sense over the pill, seeing that the inside was white and thus confirming it was indeed an Essence Gathering Pill. He felt a surge of happiness, wondering if Li Encheng had secretly refined it himself without expending blood qi, or if he had specially asked around about the Li Family's preferences and prepared it accordingly.

Li Xizhi expressed his gratitude repeatedly. Li Enxi chuckled, but then his expression darkened, and he said harshly, "The incident about the Wrathful Maha... is inevitable after all. After a whole thousand years, these Dao lineages still won't let us go..."

There was finally a note of sincerity in his tone. Li Xizhi was taken aback as Li Enxi continued, "My eldest brother was also killed by a monk! This hatred is a shared animosity within the Li Family of Wei. As long as my Li Family remains, we will never forget the blood debt of our destroyed homeland and the lives taken. When my brother heard about Maha, he speculated that it was connected to the Li lineage of Wei and was eager to meet you..."

Li Xizhi then realized there was another reason for how smoothly things had gone. He nodded solemnly, recalling the unresolved hatred between the Qingdu Li Family and Maha.

At that moment, he was struck by a thought and said, "Speaking of this, our whereabouts have recently been exposed, and we've been ambushed by our enemies… The Buddhist cultivators from Zhao seemed to be involved."

Li Enxi frowned, hesitating before responding, "If you find yourself in trouble with the monks, you can always ask me for help. I see that you're a smart child who knows how to navigate these situations, so I won't say more..."

Li Xizhi nodded. He knew he and Li Enxi were still not close enough for him to divulge information about Situ Mo, fearing it might frighten Li Enxi away. Instead, he replied, "If I come across any trace of a Buddhist cultivator, I will certainly let you know."

After talking for a while, they established the rules for future meetings before Li Xizhi turned and left. He rode the wind, stroking the hilt of his sword and lost in his thoughts.

Azure Pond… Overseas… Moongaze…

"Father is already preparing to make a move overseas. The family is growing stronger. Seventh and Eighth Brothers have a chance to establish their foundations; they are merely waiting for the right opportunity…"

For the first time in twenty years of hiding and being submissive at Azure Pond, his expression shifted, revealing his ambition. He no longer concealed his desires.

With the support of Li Encheng, the Yuan, Xiao and Ning families, it would be entirely feasible to unify Moongaze Lake…

Yu Muxian… Yu Muxian! As long as we eliminate this obstacle, we can quickly seize control of the entire Moongaze Lake.
