# Chapter 1155: Turmoil in Jianghuai

Chengshui Marsh.

The sky was a brilliant canvas of sparse clouds above verdant mountains. The water's surface was a sheet of placid, clear ripples. To the south, a storm of change was brewing, but here, an unnerving tranquility reigned over the marsh. In a high pavilion, a cool breeze drifted through as two Daoist Masters, dressed in starkly different attire, sat opposite one another, engrossed in a game of Go over tea.

The man to the west was plain-featured, clad in a long white-feathered robe with a saber at his waist and a jade gourd by his side. The man to the east appeared remarkably young, his eyes bright and full of spirit, his collar fluttering in the breeze.

On the table, to his right, lay a single, pale purple talisman.

They played in silence for a time until, from the distant south, an aura of boundless golden qi seemed to rise. The man in the west looked up, his voice soft.

"A Dui Metal Great Daoist Master."

A faint smile touched the lips of the youth seated opposite him.

"Even in a grotto-heaven, there are few such masters!"

This statement carried a hidden weight, enough to make Daoist Master Changyun, the man in the west, rise to his feet. He turned, his gaze unreadable.

"That depends… on which grotto-heaven."

Yehui looked up, his expression calm.

"The Azure Revolution Heaven."

Changyun stared at him, unsurprised. He rested a hand on the table, his fingers closing around a white stone.

"Wei Xuanyin certainly holds you in high regard," he said coolly. "What brings you here this time? To monitor me? Or to restrain me?"

"Fellow Daoist Zhang, you misunderstand."

Yehui's gaze flickered as he offered praise.

"The Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition's methods are as they have been for a millennium—a tapestry of light and shadow. Were it not for Lord Yao's personal warning, I fear even Lord Wei would have remained unaware."

The words could be taken as a compliment or a thinly veiled taunt. Zhang Yun arched an eyebrow, his eyes narrowing.

Perhaps others could not see it, but as a deep-cover agent for the Golden Feather Sect for many years, Changyun—or rather, Zhang Yun—felt it most keenly. From a strategic perspective, the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition's current gambit was not proceeding smoothly.

His True Monarch, a master strategist, had arranged for him to infiltrate Jianghuai long ago, hoping to claim a piece of the great game to come. For Zhang Yun, that piece was no ordinary prize—it was a strand of destiny itself.

The very destiny that would decide the fate of the north and south.

He, Zhang Yun, was originally groomed to become the master of Jianghuai's rogue cultivators, a powerful arm of the Great Zhao dynasty.

In the judgment of the Golden Feather cultivators, the northern power had always been reclusive; Guanhua had no reason to intervene. Even if they did, as long as Zhang Yun could consolidate the forces of Jianghuai in time, he would command a powerful voice in any negotiation.

Once True Qi fully manifested in the world and his work was done, he would rally his forces, declare for the Great Song, and use the immense karmic weight of swaying the entire realm's fate to fulfill his Daoist Tradition's mission of 'Revolution'. Such a feat would allow him to transcend the Purple Mystery realm and would be of immense benefit in his future Quest for Gold.

But during the Bright Yang incident, Zhang Yun had been outmaneuvered by the Buddhists and suffered significant injuries. This setback was manageable for the Golden Oneness, but the true disaster was the exposure of his trump cards, which cast suspicion upon his identity.

Perhaps that suspicion was what invited the plot against him in the first place. Regardless, the situation had spiraled downward. Guanhua intervened with overwhelming force, not only ruining his opportunity but repeatedly targeting and sidelining him.

If he could go south now, backstab the north, and join the Song, he might still snatch a few threads of destiny—a pittance, but better than nothing. Yet even in this dire state, Qi Lanyan was exceedingly wary of him. He would rather leave two of his mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators behind than fail to keep Zhang Yun under watch here at Watersign Ridge.

To ruin a cultivator's opportunity is tantamount to taking their life. The fact that this direct heir of the Zhang clan was still willing to sit and play Go with him was a gesture of immense respect toward the Guanhua Daoist Tradition.

Hearing Yehui's words, Zhang Yun dropped all pretence.

"I may not be able to kill Qi Lanyan," he said quietly, "but do you think I can't kill you?"

Yehui’s expression remained unchanged. 

"Fellow Daoist Zhang, you misunderstand. If this were truly the scheme of that True Monarch from a thousand years ago, would people like us ever have the chance to sit before you and address you as an equal?"

He smiled mysteriously.

"And that is precisely what makes it so terrifying."

Changyun's gaze froze for a fraction of a second. He raised his brows. Yehui continued with a smile,

"The Dui Metal has only recently been established, after all. When speaking of the Golden Core cultivators of the realm, your noble True Monarch may not be known for the purity of his attainment, but he can turn a peripheral advantage into a dominant position. Even a Dao Embryo is nothing before such mastery. Who would dare belittle his profound Dao-Profundity? Who would dare offend a direct heir of his clan?"

"Jianghuai will be lost, sooner or later. Who wouldn't offer the simple favor of helping matters along?"

A shift occurred in Zhang Yun's eyes. Yehui rose from his seat, smiling.

"When I left the monastery, Lord Wei gave me a specific instruction: 'Go to Chengyun as a guest.' The earnest goodwill in those words… every time I, Ziyu, reflect upon it, I am truly moved!"

Though his words were steeped in courtesy, Yehui's tone was utterly sincere. The tremor in his eyes was no act; it betrayed a deep, hidden dread.

He had believed his communications with the Li clan were flawless. Before his departure, Wei Xuanyin had been nothing but cordial, his voice gentle, showing no hint of anything amiss. For a moment, Bai Ziyu hadn't even questioned the phrase 'Go to Chengyun as a guest'…

But upon leaving the Profound Governance Pavilion, he saw that the normally bare, polished terrace now held a bronze cauldron.

Within the cauldron was a pool of Wall-Sinking Water.

In his life, Yehui had plotted against countless people, but this was the first time he had been frightened into a cold sweat.

What did it mean?

It meant this Daoist Master Wei knew his true purpose from start to finish. It meant that while appearing indifferent to the affairs of Jianghuai, he was, in fact, omniscient. He even knew what Yehui had hidden on his own mountain; he was perfectly aware of the tacit agreement with Li Zhouwei.

And yet, Yehui had met no resistance. He had walked out of the capital and traveled south without issue, even receiving the official task of keeping watch over Changyun.

Yehui's strategic mind was second to none. How could he fail to grasp the message from the Profound Governance Pavilion? It was because he understood that, even before reaching Jianghuai, even without knowing that Wang Ziya had emerged from seclusion, he had arrived at a crystal-clear conclusion.

'Jianghuai is lost. Qi Lanyan is going to retreat.'

'And the Golden Oneness is still the Golden Oneness, a branch of the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist Tradition. Guanhua has played the fool for long enough, suppressing Zhang Yun without just cause. Now that Qi Lanyan is on the verge of offending the Yang clan, they can no longer afford to be so dismissive of the Golden Oneness!'

His understanding was absolute. Across from him, Changyun was no simple man either. Hearing just that one sentence, his thoughts cleared. He looked up, his tone inscrutable.

"Oh?"

Yehui took a sip of tea and lowered his head in silence. Under the watchful eyes of the two Daoist Masters, the purple talisman on the jade table stirred without a breeze. With a soft pop, it erupted in a flash of silver-white fire.

_Fwoosh…_

The flame bloomed and vanished as quickly as a night-blooming cereus. The pavilion was now empty, save for the faint ripples in the teacup, which quickly settled into stillness.

---

The icy voice echoed through the air, and a dark shadow fell over Qi Lanyan's features.

'Vast Cicada…'

He understood Li Zhouwei's meaning perfectly. The current stalemate, forcing a decisive battle between north and south, was not truly his doing. The real catalyst was Li Zhouwei—it was the death of Vast Cicada.

Li Zhouwei was comparing him to Vast Cicada because Vast Cicada, too, had every reason not to die. His backer was also a major figure, yet he had fallen. The only difference was that Qi Lanyan's backer was stronger. But if Vast Cicada could perish, why not Qi Lanyan?

His expression remained placid as he watched the golden light manifest between heaven and earth. He said nothing, merely tilting his head back as a jade-like gem on his person began to glow.

He, Qi Lanyan, was laden with treasures. The Drum of Annihilating Profound Thunder was borrowed from his Daoist Tradition; the Marvellous Purple Silk of the Profound Immortal Treasure belonged to Wei Xuanyin. But this 'Upright Wood' Spiritual Treasure was his own—a prize he had personally retrieved from the Qi clan estate upon achieving his divine ability.

A pale purple light swept out, accompanied by shifting, overlapping illusions of white. Thunderheads gathered at the zenith, then descended upon the lake like a waterfall, crashing toward the northern cultivators. At its epicentre, a power that had been gathering for some time—a threefold torrent of destruction—suddenly fell.

The triple-bolt attack was renowned for its blinding speed. Before any other technique could land, the Demonbane Cleaver Mace arrived, and an explosion of lightning slammed into the deep green light of the 'Upright Wood'.

_Dong!_

The Demonbane Cleaver Mace was a ritual artifact from Wanling Heaven. It rumbled against the surface of the thunder-resistant 'Upright Wood' Spiritual Treasure. But the lightning was merely a feint. From within the rolling thunder, a golden halberd shot forth.

'So fast…'

Qi Lanyan instantly reversed his grip on his spell-sword. There was no time to cast another art; the brilliant golden light had already converged and was crashing down.

_Dong!_

The pale gold radiance shattered. Empowered by the Huai River Map, the Radiant Sun King's Halberd's might was magnified. The 'Upright Wood' Spiritual Treasure, having just weathered the Sword Intent, saw its newly raised emerald screen of light instantly crumble.

Qi Lanyan seized the brief respite. Dark pearls materialized in his palms, which he pressed together before him, his incantation urgent.

"Let Dharma reside in the Valley Water!"

The power of the Valley Water surged, allowing him to escape by the narrowest of margins.

But his form had barely solidified when the golden weapon was already before his eyes.

The power of the Bright Yang was immense. Injured and having lost the upper hand, Qi Lanyan was forced onto the defensive. But he had learned from their prior exchange and knew the secrets of the halberd. His composure held firm. Releasing his sword, he struck the drum.

_BOOM!_

Silver-white lightning erupted with immediate effect. It not only blocked the golden assault but sent a current of energy flowing back, rooting Li Zhouwei to the spot.

Qi Lanyan felt no relief. He was about to form a hand seal to transform into wind when his expression froze and his head snapped down.

In that instant, as all things were held in stasis by the raging thunder, a long, sharp weapon had passed through the chaos like a phantom and pierced his chest.

The object was ten feet long, like a spear, with a perfectly smooth, unadorned surface.

Qi Lanyan recognized it instantly.

'The Descending Radiance Equal Edge!'

'An artifact of 'Wandering Metal'!'

He felt the divine ability within him shudder and dissipate.

The Descending Radiance Equal Edge was an unorthodox weapon. It lacked complex marvels, instead taking the 'Wandering Metal' philosophy—of untethered existence and avoidance of the mortal coil—to its absolute extreme. This was how it had slipped past the binding thunder. But for that same reason, its piercing strike did not cause severe disruption. With his level of Dao-Profundity, Qi Lanyan could have forced his divine ability to function.

The problem was… the Wandering Metal, upon entering his body, had touched upon and aggravated the old Sword Intent injury left by Cheng Xunzhi.

It was more than just his divine ability failing. Qi Lanyan's face went white. If not for the purple silk at his waist tightening protectively, the Daoist Master would have spat blood then and there.

His condition was critical. He had no time to spare. The Celestial Gate above was already descending, wreathed in violet flames. Against Li Zhouwei in his current state, backed by the suppressive power of the Huai River Map, Qi Lanyan dared not risk a direct confrontation.

The initiative he had fought so hard to gain was lost. He could only raise a hand and produce the white porcelain bottle once more. Dawn Qi surged forth, forming a dense sea of clouds to block the descending Celestial Gate.

A moment's delay, an eternity behind. In that brief instant, the sky plunged into darkness. The youth above, his eyes blazing, seemed to command an unnatural dusk to ascend as a massive pillar of black-gold light—piercing heaven and earth—smashed down upon Qi Lanyan.

_BOOM!_

The youth fell like a meteor, striking the vast, empty marsh. Li Zhouwei remained where he stood, black flames dancing around him, the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass already responding.

The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass was a unique artifact. Its power accumulated in advance. Whether held upright for attack or reversed for defence, it required only a brief connection with a divine ability to be used. However, it held only four charges. With each use, a ring of runes would dim. Once all four were expended, its casting time would increase dramatically.

He had used one charge in reverse to evade an attack earlier. Now, of the four astral sigils, three were gold and one was white. The Sun-Surging Governing Stars at the center of his brow spun, shifting from a defensive reversal to an offensive alignment.

High Radiance, upright—the light of annihilation!

_Dong!_

The beam of pure, brilliant light subsumed the Emperor Qi's Light and slammed into the earth.

Qi Lanyan was on his knees, caught in the blast. His entire body shimmered with golden light, his hands trembling as they braced against the ground.

Golden celestial light, like molten rock, streamed down his cheeks. The cyan gem on his chest smoked, as his 'Horn Wood' divine ability and the 'Upright Wood' marvel linked desperately, throwing up one defence after another.

Just as the light of annihilation began to fade and the youth slowly pushed himself up, the center of Li Zhouwei’s brow flashed once more.

Pushing his Dao-Profundity to the limit, he overloaded the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass. A second golden-white beam of annihilation descended.

_BOOM!_

Qi Lanyan, who had just begun to rise, was slammed back to his knees. Before he could even muster a divine ability, a third beam followed without pause.

A vast radiance instantly consumed the world. Even the Crimson Severing Arrowhead quietly withdrew, revealing a lake surface interwoven with the chaotic energies of divine abilities.

_Tssss…_

The Sun-Surging Governing Stars between Li Zhouwei’s brows had faded to a pale white. His aura fluctuated wildly as he swallowed a mouthful of blood, his gaze like ice.

On the ground below, the Daoist robe on the youth’s upper body had been completely obliterated. His flesh had melted away, exposing jade-green organs and stark white bone. Under the lingering destructive light, his body was simultaneously dissolving and regenerating with furious speed, attempting to heal.

Horrified gazes fell upon him from all directions, but they all swept past his gruesome injuries to fixate on his hand.

In his palm, which the light of annihilation had stripped to the bone, flesh was rapidly regrowing. And held within it was a small, two-finger-wide object.

It was no more than three inches long, a fusion of cyan, blue, and purple hues that swirled together. It looked like a small twig broken from a tree, its tiny branches covered in dense, sesame-seed-sized cyan leaves.

In that instant, every divine ability between heaven and earth seemed to dim. All sound faded into the distance. Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes reflected a radiant, unified, multicolored light.

He vaguely heard someone shouting, their voice tight with fury, but it reached his ears as a mere whisper:

"The Crystalline Jade Branch!"
