# Chapter 884: Heavenly Beard

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow, his gaze drifting north where the strange autumn dew continued to fall, drop by drop. He exchanged a look with Ning Wan, then said hesitantly, "Should we go take a look?"

Ning Wan nodded. "Agreed. With a disturbance this massive, both the Sword Gate and Xiukui will have seen it. They're bound to arrive sooner or later, so we don't need to worry about being the first ones there."

The Great Void itself was trembling, roiled by waves of thick, heaven-piercing golden qi. It was no safe path for travel. Since Tangdao Mountain wasn't far, the two simply activated their divine abilities, crossing the distance in moments to arrive at a vantage point overlooking the mountain.

Tangdao Mountain, its rugged peaks rolling as the main summit thrust toward the sky, was now completely enveloped in golden qi. The zenith was a thick, white expanse—not cloud, not mist, but something more like roiling, sandy smoke. It billowed and churned, clinging to the air, refusing to disperse.

Any clouds in the sky had long since been dissolved, preventing the golden qi from condensing and falling as autumn dew. The qi was gushing forth far faster than it could diffuse, and this white-golden miasma only grew thicker, punctuated by deep, rumbling booms.

Faint, colorful lights pulsed within the sky. Huge, gilded figures—golden bodies—loomed and vanished within the white qi and falling dew. Periodically, flashes of light would erupt from the ground below, ascending to the Buddhist Land.

Li Ximing stared, his expression growing troubled. "It's the Buddhist cultivators, no doubt," he murmured. "Is Golden Feather... really just going to ignore this?"

'The Golden Tang Gate has been annihilated. Golden Feather must know. In fact, given Golden Feather's current power and prestige, the Buddhist cultivators would *never* have dared to dismantle the Golden Tang Gate without a word... unless it was an order from Luoxia.' How could Li Ximing not understand the implication? 'They must have sold the sect out for a very good price.'

Ning Wan fell silent, only speaking after a long moment. "Situ Huo once promised to give the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope to Golden Feather. My family's elders intervened and stopped it. But later, after your duel with Changxiao, they must have reached some secret agreement, because Golden Feather ended up with the Spiritual Artifact anyway... Judging by Golden Feather's attitude, it's clear the Golden Tang Gate's usefulness had already run out by then."

"Now they've handed the entire mountain over to the Buddhist cultivators. A perfectly good Purple Mansion-level formation... they just left it for these monks to shatter. And these Buddhist cultivators... a Purple Mansion formation is an incredibly precious thing! Even if they couldn't use it themselves, couldn't they have sold it to someone else? Why destroy it like this..."

With Ning Wan's words, the implication was clear. Li Ximing understood immediately.
'What other motive could there be? This golden qi floods the heavens and shrouds all of Jiangbei. The prize they're after... it can only be the spiritual essence.'

The Golden Feather Sect rarely involved itself in scrambles for spiritual essence. They possessed their own Grotto-Heaven, presided over by True Monarch Duijin, a master of Metal Virtue. Any cultivator following Golden Feather's orthodox Metal Virtue Daoist tradition could simply break through within that Grotto-Heaven. Why would they ever need to cause such a commotion in the outside world?
'This current spectacle... perhaps it's all for the Golden Feather Sect's Daoist Master Qiushui.'

But while Li Ximing was lost in thought, Ning Wan's expression grew complicated. "But... the Inward Heart Surging Profundity was already exceptionally rare and powerful," she said softly. "To have Tangdao Mountain thrown into such chaos... this is not a good thing."

Li Ximing frowned at her. Ning Wan, however, began to move closer, her feet seeming to tread on snow as she advanced. Li Ximing followed close behind. When they were about ten li from the mountain, the colorful lights and the outlines of the Buddhist Land became sharp and clear. Only then did Ning Wan halt.

One sweep of his gaze, and Li Ximing realized something was wrong.

A black, roiling tide of baleful qi was surging from the mountain range, cresting over the hills like dark waves. The golden qi trapped in the sky, which had nowhere else to go, now seemed drawn by an invisible force. It began to fall, not as dew, but as long, silken threads of white, all being pulled from the heavens down into the earth.

Ning Wan caught a lingering drop of the autumn dew. "Metal Virtue cultivators have a maxim," she said, "known as 'Sinks Upon Encountering Balefulness.' The golden qi is trapped above the mountain. With no clouds or mist, it cannot manifest as the purifying qi of autumn and winter. Instead, it is drawn down by the Baleful Earth and sinks. And this very act of sinking... it refines the Baleful Earth into Primordial Magnetism."

"The great formation of Tangdao Mountain is shattered, completely uprooted. It's so broken, it can't even collapse into a stable forbidden zone. All that's left are the perforated, bleeding earth veins. This is the perfect moment for the Baleful Earth to surge outward. The instant it meets that metal qi, it transforms into Primordial Magnetism."

Her expression was tinged with confusion as she turned to Li Ximing. "This is the source of one of the three great lightnings... Primordial Lightning."

Li Ximing froze.

His own junior, Li Que'wan, cultivated the 'Whole Pill' path! He'd known for some time that this specific path had three great fears: first, Converging Water; second, Merging Fire; and the third... Primordial Magnetism!

'This sheet of golden qi, carrying the full three-hundred-year accumulation of the Golden Tang Gate, is sinking into the mountain. It's enough to transform this entire place into a treasure land of Primordial Magnetism... The earth veins and spiritual essence of all Jiangbei will be irrevocably altered!'

'If this was truly for Daoist Master Qiushui's breakthrough, why would the Golden Feather Sect go to such lengths? Wouldn't this new environment be detrimental to them? They'd be asking for trouble!'

He quickly understood Ning Wan's confusion and doubt. "If... this *isn't* the Golden Feather Sect's doing," he reasoned, "then... why hasn't a single Daoist Master from the Golden Feather Sect appeared to stop it?"

The golden qi to the north began to sink *en masse*. The earlier descent of silken threads connecting sky and earth transformed. It was as if a hole had been torn in the white expanse above. The qi began to cascade down like a torrential waterfall, all of it burrowing deep into the earth veins.

Even from such a distance, Li Ximing could sense a new power flashing within the mountains—an intermingling of dark-iron black and flashing silver. A strange, new aura began to rise. The very ground beneath their feet thrummed, and they could feel the metal and stone of the earth itself trembling.

"This is the power of Primordial Magnetism..."

The instant this new aura arose, the entire sheet of golden qi still floating in the sky shattered. As if seized by an irresistible pull, it collapsed all at once, bathing the entirety of Tangdao Mountain in a blinding, brilliant white.

Ning Wan still saw no sign of any cultivator from the Golden Feather Sect. But beside her, dark qi coalesced, and Daoist Master Kui Qi descended on a divine ability, his black robes stark against the light. His expression was grim. "It's useless now, even if Qiushui herself were to come," he stated. "Unless a True Monarch intervenes, no one can touch this place."

After speaking, his gaze drifted down to the mountain range shrouded in white qi. "It matters little that the Golden Tang Gate is gone," he said. "But what Situ Tang acquired back then was the Daoist tradition of the ancient Heavenly Beard Gate. That cannot be lost. Even though the Buddhist cultivators have the jade slips, and it won't be difficult for them to open... it's unlikely to remain a secret. Still, it must be retrieved."

With Kui Qi's appearance, the colorful lights to the north finally stirred. A stream of illusory radiance detached itself and descended, condensing nearby into a golden body.

This golden body possessed six arms and four feet, and its head had three faces. One was snarling, another was weeping in sorrow, and all were adorned with wondrous patterns. Four of its arms brandished a staff, a club, a saber, and a sword, while the remaining two hands were pressed together at its chest. Its voice was benevolent. "Nuzi greets the three fellow Daoists!"

Li Ximing frowned inwardly, but Kui Qi was already sneering. "You old fossil. After dawdling for so many years, the Way of Great Desire finally found a seat for you? We just saw Vija, and now you've shown up... The Way of Great Desire and the Way of Emptiness... you two have certainly gotten cozy these past few years."

'The Way of Great Desire again...'

When Li Ximing and Kui Qi had rescued Ning Wan, they had clashed with Zhelu and Taixi of the Way of Emptiness. That faction had wanted him dead, and it was Vija of the Way of Great Desire who had interfered and stirred up the situation. Now, this Nuzi had appeared. This was the context for Kui Qi's remark.

This Nuzi was clearly a Maha who had risen through the ranks during the North-South conflict. Though from the same generation as Taixi, he looked far older, as if he had been waiting for this promotion for many years. He showed no anger at the jibe, merely replying calmly, "I have only lived a few more years and was fortunate enough to be promoted. I now cultivate under Lord Vija. He heard I have had significant contact with the southern cultivators, so he dispatched me."

"Our two paths, the Way of Great Desire and the Way of Emptiness, act under the command of the Dharma Master to exterminate the blood-refining, flesh-eating Golden Tang Demon Gate. Do the esteemed Daoist Masters have any instructions for us?"

He spoke with righteous conviction, striking the pose of an orthodox cultivator, bearing no trace of the insidious manner usually associated with the Ways of Emptiness and Great Desire. Li Ximing knew Kui Qi wouldn't tolerate this. Sure enough, the black-robed Daoist Master's expression turned even colder. "Utterly shameless. When Situ Tang was at the height of his power, you didn't say a single word. Now that the Golden Tang Gate is reduced to just a few survivors, you raise a commotion that fills the sky with golden qi and scourges the land with this dew, needlessly wounding the climate, and you have the gall to call it 'demon extermination'."

Nuzi pressed his palms together. "In any case, we are eliminating a scourge for the people."

Although Ning Wan still harbored deep resentment for the two paths, she hesitated, seeing that a battle was imminent.

This affair damaged the Golden Feather Sect's interests. If Golden Feather had been willing to take the lead, Ning Wan and her allies would have gladly lent their strength. But Golden Feather remained silent, and no one knew what secret bargain had been struck. Without their lead, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had no legitimate reason to intervene...

Ning Wan had no choice but to speak, her voice cold. "Our 'Lord' has already gone to the north, yet your Buddhist Path still finds the energy to come south and stir up chaos... Regardless of its actions, the Golden Tang Gate was once a part of the Immortal Dao's Daoist tradition. What gives you the right to annihilate it without a word?"

"It was, at least, an immortal sect's Daoist tradition. Situ Tang held the legacy of an ancient cultivator. That legacy cannot be allowed to be lost to the outside world."

To her surprise, Nuzi laughed aloud. "We have already taken that into consideration for the Immortal Dao!"

He waved his sleeve. From the north, led by a being with the title of Merciful One, a group of Master Monks flew over on rainbow light. They used their dharma power to levitate clusters of near-naked, shivering men and women, who clutched infants in their hands and under their arms.

As they drew near, the leading Merciful One—burly and broad-shouldered, clad in shining golden armor—was revealed. His face was sternly handsome, but his four eyes were savage. He bowed. "Reporting, my lord! The entire Situ Clan has been brought!"

Li Ximing looked down. He saw a crowd of Situ family members, their cultivation levels varying, though most were mere mortals. As they drew close and saw the three Daoist Masters, a desperate hope flared in their eyes. They burst into tears, wailing and begging for mercy, kneeling on the rainbow light to kowtow frantically.

Ning Wan sighed, deeply unsettled. Kui Qi, however, frowned heavily, his anger barely concealed. Whatever their crimes, the Situ family were descendants of a Purple Mansion Realm expert. To be captured was one thing, but to be stripped and humiliated like livestock... If not for the fact that the Situ family had been rotten for generations, Kui Qi likely would have exploded in rage.

Nuzi raised his sleeve again. The cuff billowed, expanding instantly, and poured out a cascade of items. Jade slips and dharma artifacts, large and small, tumbled out, forming a small mountain before the captives. The Maha Nuzi chuckled. "We didn't take much. It's all here, handed over to the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition!"

His expression turned serious. "This is, after all, a command from the Dharma Master. We cannot afford any mistakes. We sincerely hope the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition will not interfere. If a conflict arises over this matter, we *will not* be able to retreat."

In truth, even with their True Monarch gone north, it would be incredibly difficult for the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition to cross the river and wage war on this mountain, especially against the Buddhist cultivators allied with the Ways of Great Desire and Emptiness. Unless Lou Xing of Xiukui personally intervened, they would never make such an impulsive move.

Yet the Buddhist cultivators still delivered the Daoist tradition and the captives. This showed just how desperate they were to avoid any mistakes, and how resolute their decision was to hold Tangdao Mountain...

'The Dharma Master's will? Is this move targeted at the Golden Feather Sect?'

Kui Qi did not reply. He simply raised two fingers to his lips and blew softly. A grey wind descended from the heavens, passing over the heads of the Situ family cultivators. As it passed, it transformed into pure black Daoist robes, which settled upon their naked bodies, covering them.

Seeing that the three were ignoring him, Nuzi tactfully waved his hand. The surrounding Master Monks, led by the Merciful One, rose on the wind, and the entire group, including Nuzi, dissolved into rainbow light and retreated to the north.

Li Ximing descended slightly on his divine ability. He guessed that any of the Situ Clan below who'd had any backbone were already dead. The survivors seemed to compete in their terror of him, kowtowing endlessly. Some even dragged the robes from their women and pushed them forward, crying, "Daoist Master... Daoist Master, spare our lives!"

"It was all Situ Mo's doing in the past! It has nothing to do with us!"

Li Ximing watched in silence, an indescribable feeling rising within him. 'The Situ family of old... the Situ family where a single direct descendant, merely passing over a lake, could wipe out ten thousand others... has been reduced to this.'

He stood there, motionless. A Situ family woman with a fair, tear-streaked face crawled before him, kowtowing. She reached out, wanting to grasp the hem of his robe as if it were a lifeline, but her hand froze halfway, suspended uselessly in the air by her terror.

The fleeting moment was lost. She was instantly dragged backward by her own kinsmen, kicked aside, and replaced by another person who scrambled to the front, weeping and kowtowing.

"Zhaojing?"

Ning Wan's gentle voice broke his reverie. Li Ximing looked up, shaking his head with a strained laugh, as if brushing his thoughts aside. "This group of Situ family clansmen... what should be done with them?"

Kui Qi descended on his divine ability, his gaze sweeping over the captives. "The Situ family's elite were few to begin with," he said softly. "Now, they've either been slaughtered or 'welcomed' into the Buddhist Land. The ones left here are mostly from branch families or are of illegitimate birth. Even if there's a direct descendant or two among them, they're clearly not the valued ones. Zhaojing, do you have any thoughts?"

Situ Mo and the Li Clan had a deep feud. As a cultivator from the Great Xiukui Monastery, Kui Qi clearly didn't want to see Li Ximing slaughter them all; his tactful words were a rare occurrence. Li Ximing sighed. "I don't have any strong feelings. Those monks from the north are treacherous. If any of these people truly mattered to my family's grudge, the monks would never have let them go—they'd already be in the Buddhist Land. They were sent here deliberately, hoping I *would* slaughter them all. It would give them the perfect karmic pretext to 'enlighten' the Situ family members they *did* keep."

"Correct."

Ning Wan smiled and produced a jade slip from her sleeve, handing it to Li Ximing. "This contains the Situ family's secret methods for bypassing restrictions. It should open most of them. I heard Situ Mo made some secret modifications in the last two years, but the core members of his direct line likely know the new methods."

Ning Wan was clearly giving this to Li Ximing because he held Situ Ku. The old man had been a prisoner of the Li Clan for years, and having him under control now proved to be a great convenience.

Li Ximing nodded. "Once I have sorted through these techniques, I will send a copy to both your families."

Kui Qi raised his sleeve and, with a wave, neatly divided both the people and the pile of items into three equal portions. He collected one portion. "My Lord has already gone north," he said softly. "There isn't much time left. The various sects should begin placing their pieces for the game ahead. As long as those... specific individuals... are not harmed, nothing else is a major concern."

Li Ximing nodded. He hesitated briefly before asking, "I wish to refine an 'Upper Shaman' spirit embryo. I was wondering if Senior could offer me some guidance..."

He was not underestimating the connections of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, and Kui Qi, in turn, did not seem surprised. He waved his hand calmly. "If Zhaojing is sincere, you may come to Tiger's Frontier for a visit... after my Lord has departed."

With that, he rode the wind, dissolving into a grey gust and departing.

Once he was gone, Ning Wan's expression turned grave. She turned to Li Ximing. "Zhaojing, did you happen to notice that 'Four-Eyed Merciful One' beside Nuzi?"

Li Ximing was slightly surprised. "I glanced at him."

Ning Wan's expression was serious. "That man is named Bashan. My family has known of him for some time. An elder told me that back when Nuzi was still just a Merciful One, this Bashan was an Arhat under his command. He was born with divine strength and incredible talent, so he was promoted rapidly. Now that Nuzi has attained the rank of Maha, Bashan has taken his old place as a Merciful One!"

Her voice lowered. "He must not be underestimated. His divine strength is likely on par with Xuanfeng's. In terms of future prospects, Nuzi might not even be his equal. Years ago, Nuzi even tried to make a move on Xuanfeng, hoping to gather a 'pair' of them. He only gave up because the Great Ning Palace suddenly made contact with Anhuai, and the Metallic Essence was revealed..."

Li Ximing frowned and nodded. Ning Wan continued, her voice fraught with worry, "The Golden Feather Sect is sitting idle... and Jiangbei is beyond our reach. The North-South conflict has already destroyed most of the networks we'd pushed north. Now, with the loss of the critical point at Golden Tang, the Buddhist cultivators can bypass our eastern flank. This is not a good development, no matter how you look at it."

Li Ximing sighed internally. "I know you still have Situ Ku," Ning Wan continued. "There aren't many direct descendants of the Situ family left, but their enemies are numerous. As for Situ Huo, who is still at large... many people consider him a thorn in their side."

She added frankly, "That includes me. That's why I hope you'll keep this man. When this business in the north is finally over, and the opportunity arises... we can use his bloodline to divine Situ Huo's location. Getting rid of him would be for the best."

Li Ximing nodded and parted ways with her. Behind him, the Situ family members, still suspended by the Heavenly Light, could only huddle together, weeping silently as they watched Li Ximing descend on his light toward the lake below.

More than a year had passed, and the construction within the great formation was complete. Most of the new structures were built around the massive, profound pillars, with various cultivation pavilions spiraling upward, nestled between them.

He scanned the area and landed on a platform. In the center stood the Wanling Flower Tree, its canopy spreading like a lush parasol, adorned with blooming red flowers. The area was heavily guarded. White Ape was resting beneath the tree.

Upon seeing Li Ximing, White Ape rose to bow. Li Ximing set his group of captives down and offered a greeting. Then, his spiritual sense swept out, searching for his subordinates.

Soon, Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan arrived in the courtyard, one after the other, both bowing in greeting. Li Ximing's expression was grave. "Go and bring Situ Ku here," he commanded.

Li Jiangqian immediately dispatched someone. A moment later, Ding Weizeng, clad in crimson armor, appeared, hauling an old man with him. Ding Weizeng's gaze was fervent as he bowed before the hall.

Ding Weizeng had once been a cultivator under the Golden Tang Gate's jurisdiction and had some history with this old man. It seemed he was here to see him off. Li Ximing nodded at him, signaling for him to remain, before turning his gaze to the old man on the ground.

Situ Ku had actually been treated decently by the Li family all these years. Though his cultivation was sealed, he had been well-fed and cared for in the dungeons. The moment he looked up and saw Li Ximing, he trembled violently. "Greetings, Daoist Master!" he stammered.

Li Ximing stated casually, "The Golden Tang Gate was annihilated by the Buddhist cultivators. The Situ family is wiped out. Only a few branch families are left. I brought a batch of them back."

Situ Ku stared blankly for a second, then tears streamed down his face. He kowtowed. "I... I will do whatever the Daoist Master commands!"

The Li family had kept him alive this long precisely because he was so pliable. Li Ximing wasn't surprised by the reaction. With a light wave of his sleeve, rows of jade slips—the ones from Nuzi—appeared neatly stacked to one side. Li Ximing pointed. "Unlock them."

Situ Ku opened his mouth, then hesitated. Li Ximing tossed Ning Wan's jade slip in front of him. The old man scrambled to pick it up. Li Ximing turned his head to Ding Weizeng, a smile touching his lips. "Your cultivation has advanced quickly."

"It is all thanks to the Daoist Master's blessing!" Ding Weizeng bowed his head respectfully. "This lowly one also had a child a few years ago. A girl. We named her Ding Yujing..."

"Good." Li Ximing turned back. "Is there one named Ding Mu, still cultivating at Purple Smoke?"

Li Jiangqian quickly interjected, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, yes. The family has supplied him with cultivation resources all these years. He brought his mother back for a visit a few years ago. He was very cordial and expressed his gratitude repeatedly..."

Li Ximing nodded, satisfied. From the other side, Li Que'wan approached, holding a pale golden jade slip. She bowed. "Reporting to the Daoist Master, this is the Heavenly Beard Polished Metal Sutra."

Of all the legacies of the Golden Tang Gate, this was unquestionably the most precious. Situ Tang's line producing three Purple Mansion Realm experts was certainly related to talent, but the Heavenly Beard Polished Metal Sutra had played no small part!

Li Ximing held it up and scanned its contents.

The technique was indeed impressive. As the foundational text of the Golden Tang Gate, it was a fifth-grade sutra containing two secret methods. Successful cultivation led to the 'Engraved Stone', which was known in ancient times as the 'Golden Beast Plume'. The sutra itself claimed to be the Heavenly Beard Daoist tradition, founded by a Daoist Master Tianxu, a cultivator from the Xu State

The sutra mentioned little else of its origins. The only other notable part was a warning at the very end, reminding cultivators to be "cautious with one's edge." However, some later cultivator had added an annotation:
'The Engraved Stone is about perseverance, about being sharp and without regret. It is like the Gleaming Gold Feather-Beast: it can only ascend, never descend. To descend is to fall to earth, to be trapped and killed by the Baleful Earth. If one's cultivation stagnates, how is that any different from being trapped and killed by the Baleful Earth?'

'To annotate a Purple Mansion-level sutra with such arrogance... that must have been Situ Tang himself,' Li Ximing thought, shaking his head. 

'He only cared about cultivating his divine abilities, doing as he pleased without restraint. He never cared what happened to the Golden Tang Gate.'

Although the sutra was precious, the Si family, the Ning family, and Golden Feather almost certainly had copies already. It would be a good addition for the clan's juniors. Li Ximing stored it away and began inspecting the other techniques. He looked down on most of them, simply adding them to the family's repository.

Only one, the *Sublime Method of the Vast Profound Magnetic Light*, was unique. Though only a third-grade technique, it was a cultivation method of the Primordial Lightning path, designed to establish the 'Baleful Lord's Rite' as one's Immortal Foundation.

Li Ximing gave it a second look before storing it. He then commanded, "The Golden Tang Gate is gone... Que'Wan, divine if any of these captives are from the direct Purple Mansion Realm bloodline."

Li Que'wan nodded. She took a drop of Situ Ku's blood and began forming hand seals around a jade token. Li Ximing turned to Li Jiangqian. "What are your plans for them?"

'It would have been cleaner if they had all died at the hands of the Buddhist cultivators,' Li Jiangqian thought. He had little desire to deal with the Situ family survivors, but their bloodlines were admittedly decent. He replied, "If this junior is to handle it, they will be absorbed into the Seven Clans of Xizhang. Their family names will be changed, severing their past ties. From that point on, they will have no relation to the Situ name."

Li Ximing glanced at Situ Ku, who was trembling at his feet, and then at the somber-faced Ding Weizeng. With a light flick of his finger, a spark of divine ability flew into the old man's brow, sealing his Shengyang Acupoint. "As for you, Situ Ku," Li Ximing commanded, "if I release you, you'll just be captured by the monks and used as cultivation fodder. Out of consideration for Weizeng, you will remain by his side and perform odd jobs. Patrol the shores. That will be your contribution."
