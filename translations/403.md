# Chapter 527: Suppression and Injury

"That damned bastard!" Mutuo spat, his frustration boiling over. Despite his anger, he could not overpower his opponent. He activated his golden light and performed a series of hand seals. The red glow on his face dimmed momentarily.

After a while, he finally got a result and said impatiently, "I can't deduce his whereabouts. How can he be in the Eastern Sea?!"

His crimson face contorted in anger as drops of blood trickled from his nostrils. Wiping it away with his hand, he gritted his teeth.

"Your paranoia has cost me... You better make it up to me when we get back!"

However, Situ Mo had fallen into deep thought, ignoring him. A whirlwind of doubts filled his mind.

How could this be possible? Could Kong Tingyun really have let her guard down? There are only one or two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators left in the Profound Peak Gate... Logically, she should be able to escape safely. She must have more than one Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator aiding her...

Mutuo called out to him three times before Situ Mo finally snapped back to reality. He murmured, "Mutuo, this may be a trap. You and I should retreat a hundred li for now and wait for an opportunity. It'll be safer to stay close to Golden Sack Island. If anything goes wrong, we can get away in time."

"Y-Y-You...! That's not far from Yuezhou Island! Kong Tingyun can escape easily! What are you thinking?!" Mutuo scolded in disbelief.

Seeing the determination on Situ Mo's face, Mutuo had no choice but to express his frustration.

"All of you from the southern immortal dao are damn cowards; so paranoid all the time..."

The Li Family members rode the current all the way to the Scarlet Pristine Sea before coming to a gradual stop. They broke through the water's surface, and Li Yuanjiao deactivated his spell, gazing into the distance.

The sea here had gradually turned pale turquoise, its seabed covered in deep red reefs rich in iron. From above, it appeared a vibrant tapestry of turquoise and red, earning it its name Scarlet Pristine Sea.

Kong Tingyun admired the magnificent scenery before explaining, "Two thousand years ago, this sea was known as Qunyi. Later, the eighth son of the Converging Water True Hornless Dragon was captured here. The dragon clan punished him for matricide by binding him to a deep cliff at the bottom of the sea. They built nine cold iron pillars, nailed him to the cliff, dismembered him, and let the demons devour his remains. As a result, the sea turned turquoise overnight, and the demons within it gradually transformed, becoming what they are today."

She smiled softly and continued, "The True Hornless Dragon had nine sons—six of converging and three of pristine. Now, only two remain in the world; the rest have perished."

Kong Tingyun paused, then added softly, "Some say that the dragon clan did this to scatter the Pristine Water Metallic Essence throughout the Scarlet Pristine Sea, making it difficult to gather them."

Li Yuanjiao pondered for a moment before asking, "Why doesn't the dragon clan simply keep it for themselves to create a Golden Core...?"

Kong Tingyun stepped on a cloud and quietly replied, "The True Hornless Dragon swallowed the Pristine Water Feathered Serpent and died... The enmity between them remains unresolved. To this day, dragons still devour feathered serpents, and the eighth son is one such feathered serpent!"

"The Daoist Master of my family speculated that perhaps the dragons fear that if they consume the Pristine Water Metallic Essence, they will soon grow feathers and turn into their enemy!" she added.

"Horrible..." Kongheng murmured a Buddhist chant before continuing in a low voice, "Feathered serpents and dragon species share the same origins; the only difference is that one is of Pristine Water and the other of Converging Water. It's truly a sin that they're killing each other like this..."

Li Yuanjiao looked thoughtful as he began to grasp the concept of the Golden Core.

Golden Core Realm cultivators... Are they those who obtained Metallic Essence... or are they those who achieved Fruition Attainment...?

Kong Tingyun's voice interrupted his thoughts as she said seriously, "I have something to trouble fellow Daoists with."

"Situ Mo is cunning, and he has a Master Monk from Zhao State as his assistant. I will be gone for several months; he will undoubtedly learn of this and likely ambush me on my way back. Please keep your distance and conceal your presence..." she explained.

Li Yuanjiao immediately caught on and smiled inwardly.

So there's indeed a Buddhist cultivator supporting him!

Realizing that the threat was only a Buddhist cultivator rather than a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, Li Yuanjiao felt much more at ease. He immediately replied, "I have a dharma artifact that can conceal presence. Perhaps Kongheng and my younger sister should keep their distance while I stay beside you? At least it'll be easier for both of us to prevent them from escaping."

"All right!" Kong Tingyun nodded approvingly.

Li Yuanjiao activated the Profound Patterned Bottle, and a mysterious spiritual mist enveloped his body. He flew forward with Kong Tingyun, leaving Kongheng and Li Qinghong behind.

Kongheng felt slightly awkward being alone with her. He lowered his head and began chanting a Buddhist scripture, but Li Qinghong ignored him, her gaze fixed on the endless turquoise and red sea as a thought crossed her mind.

It would be wonderful if Father could see such magnificent scenery.

————

Li Yuanjiao and Kong Tingyun rode the wind together. Kong Tingyun remained silent, but she sensed that Li Yuanjiao was close by, flying leisurely alongside her. As they journeyed deeper into the Scarlet Pristine Sea, doubts began to creep in.

That guy is cautious. If fear the further we go, it'll be more difficult to defeat him.

While she was lost in thought, several golden lights emerged from the reefs beneath them, and a golden streak suddenly shot up from the sea. Situ Mo broke through the water, squinting slightly as he fixed his gaze on Kong Tingyun.

The sea was vast, its water veins flowing seamlessly, with no solid ground to plant formation flags or harness spiritual energy. Few formations could be established in such an environment, and even if Situ Mo possessed a treasure formation, he had yet to set it up.

Kong Tingyun feigned surprise before sarcastically saying, "We are very close to the two islands right now! Do you think the guest cultivators on my island are all blind?"

The sea was vast and both of them were direct descendants of immortal gates. Naturally, they were unwilling to grant each other the opportunity to use escape spells. The fierce battle would likely only end with one of them dead, eliminating the need for a large formation. Nevertheless, Kong Tingyun was fearless, given their proximity to the two islands.

Situ Mo stared at her for a moment, as if trying to discern something, before saying, "Fellow Daoist... you are quite brave. I don't need to kill you; I only need to severely injure you..."

While Situ Mo distracted her with his words, he discreetly performed a series of hand seals. As he completed the six seals, he hooked his index fingers while keeping the other three fingers together, summoning a golden saber that came out from his palm.

It's that spell!

Li Yuanjiao recalled his past encounter with it and silently put his hand on the hilt of his sword.

Suddenly, the sea below them erupted once more, and a burly monk with a clean-shaven head and a red complexion soared out, brandishing a staff with both hands and preparing to strike at Kong Tingyun.

Kong Tingyun remained calm, slapping her storage pouch. A golden mountain emerged, flying toward the monk to suppress him. The monk sneered fearlessly as he attempted to catch it with his hands.

However, when Mutuo's hands made contact with the golden mountain, his tongue unexpectedly went numb, and only four of his facial features remained—his lips had vanished, leaving a smooth space below his philtrum. Horror washed over him as Kong Tingyun sneered coldly.

"This golden mountain has been waiting for you, monk!"

With that, she produced another jade pearl that shone brightly, directing its light at the golden saber. Situ Mo's spell suddenly faltered as his golden saber hummed and vibrated uncontrollably like a dragonfly that had its tail pinched.

Kong Tingyun remarked casually, "I would love to see how you plan to seriously injure me."

This was the first time Situ Mo confronted her head-on, and he felt an impending headache.

I've heard that the Profound Peak Gate is filled with iron turtles... It seems like it's true—they excel at defense. Kong Tingyun holds an extraordinary status, and her dharma artifacts are more powerful than others. This will be a tough battle!

Sure enough, Kong Tingyun swung her sleeves, unleashing a pair of black hooks that flew toward him like crescent moons, circling and dancing as they hissed with turquoise smoke.

Situ Mo glanced at the hooks and recognized them as ordinary dharma artifacts. He summoned three golden shields and easily blocked the attack.

Meanwhile, the golden saber spell on the other side broke through the protective barrier of the jade pearl, its speed increasing as it darted forward.

Kong Tingyun appeared to be in danger, yet she showed no fear, which secretly shocked Situ Mo.

At that moment, two streams of light appeared in the distance—one purple and one brown. Situ Mo's expression shifted, and golden light flared beneath his feet. However, a chill suddenly crept down his spine. With a sweep of his spiritual sense, he detected a green-white sword light approaching.

Li Yuanjiao! They've really joined forces!

He broke out in a cold sweat, unable to determine how Li Yuanjiao had managed to evade the Buddhist cultivator's detection. With the golden shield resisting Kong Tingyun's dharma artifact, he had no choice but to quickly perform a hand seal and cast a spell, darting out of the impending attack's way, albeit narrowly.

CLANG!

Qingche's sword light sliced through the air, grazing his feathered robe instead of his neck and producing a piercing sound of mana being consumed. Situ Mo's face paled as he coughed up a smooth, round red pill.

The pill spun in the air before dissolving into smoke.

Not this trick again!

It must be some sort of displacement technique, specifically designed to counter sword and mana light.

Just as Situ Mo evaded the attack, he shouted hastily, "Retreat quickly!"

Li Yuanjiao's sword did not wait for him. It split into three sword lights as it turned back, attacking him from above, the middle, and below. Situ Mo, having suffered a setback earlier, was well prepared. Demonstrating the confidence of an immortal sect disciple, he threw out three talismans with a flick of his hand, each bouncing off into three white circles to intercept the sword lights one by one.

Clearly, Situ Mo had come prepared. The white circles released by these three Foundation Establishment Realm talismans were smooth and agile. Though their strength was not great, they were designed to effectively counter Threefold Moonlight.

With this delay, Li Qinghong and Kongheng finally arrived on the scene. Although Situ Mo did not recognize the heroic-looking female cultivator, he identified Kongheng and guessed that she was Li Qinghong. The purple light in her eyes and the purple lightning dancing across her jade armor caught his attention.

Situ Mo barely had time to retreat before Li Qinghong parted her vermillion lips slightly and released a speck of purple light that almost instantly swelled to the size of a fist, glowing with a brilliant white light.

A sense of numbness washed over Situ Mo as he realized the power of the impending attack. He quickly deactivated his three golden shields, ignoring the double hooks that Kong Tingyun had launched. He also swiftly withdrew the golden saber and disengaged with her.

Kong Tingyun hurriedly urged the jade pearl to give chase. The monk below watched on in shock and terror, bewildered by how Li Yuanjiao managed to evade his calculation. Unable to voice his confusion, he could only muster his strength to try and push the golden mountain off of him.

Kong Tingyun had to lower her head and look at the situation below her as she retrieved a golden talisman from her sleeve. With a simple flick of her fingers, she sent it flying toward the golden mountain.

Mutuo was unfortunate; despite having an arsenal of spells and techniques, he had been suppressed by the golden mountain from the start. Crafted from an unknown material, the mountain had slowed him down, also causing his lips and teeth to disappear. Just as he finally managed to push it up a little, Kong Tingyun's talisman landed on the mountain.

The talisman shimmered with golden light, its yellow-brown surface adorned with vermilion characters in one large line that read—1,006,580,000 jin.

Mutuo felt a powerful force emanating from his hand. He had only time to let out a mournful cry as the light turquoise waters around him parted. The golden mountain fell, rumbling ominously, causing the waves to surge to heights of a hundred chi before slowly settling down again.

Boom!

The spectacle in the sky was equally breathtaking. A white light erupted from above, accompanied by the roar of thunder that was like a landslide. The white lightning transformed into dense purple bolts that cascaded down like a waterfall, suppressing all that was below.

Situ Mo's golden shields were on their way back to assist him, but they were intercepted by Li Yuanjiao's swift sword. To his dismay, his golden saber was also stalled by Kongheng's spell. A golden light silently bloomed on his chest.

Rumble!

Amidst the raging thunder, Situ Mo was propelled backward, enveloped in golden light and dust, leaving only a thin layer of golden shield around him, almost resembling an eggshell.

Riding the wind, he noticed five or six streams of light approaching from the two islands, preparing for confrontation.

Situ Mo's golden shield did not reach him in time, so he was struck by the thunder spell. His feathered robe was scorched gray, and his chest was bloody. Several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators behind him caught him. Gasping, he commanded, "Let's go!"

Situ Mo silently thanked himself for being cautious, though he feared that more people would soon emerge from the market and annihilate his group. He did not dare linger and hurriedly retreated, enveloped in golden light.

His companions quickly followed suit without hesitation, fearful of being pursued. The guest cultivators of Profound Peak Gate approached to greet Kong Tingyun.

"Good... good! He wasted his life-saving trump card and is quite seriously injured; this trip wasn't in vain!" she remarked with a smile.

She glanced at Li Qinghong, who appeared slightly pale, and praised, "I didn't expect you to possess such a powerful thunder spell... Truly impressive!"

Although the profound thunder had been condensed in advance in the thunder pool, it was still a draining spell for Li Qinghong to cast. She smiled modestly and replied softly, "It's nothing compared to fellow Daoist's golden mountain."

Situ Mo was a direct disciple highly valued by the Golden Tang Gate, making it unlikely to kill him so easily in one fell swoop. With the right combination of timing and circumstances, this encounter was enough to prevent him from making any progress for many years to come.

Li Yuanjiao nodded approvingly but was more concerned about the monk and asked, "What about the monk?"

Kong Tingyun replied with a shrug, "He is no better off than Situ Mo."

The group dove deeper, navigating through the pale turquoise waters until they discovered the golden mountain resting on the seabed. Kong Tingyun stowed away the dharma artifact and examined the bloody remnants with care. After casting a few spells, she glanced at Kongheng with some uncertainty.

Kongheng understood her concern. He stepped forward, closed his eyes to sense the surroundings, and said in a deep voice, "He went back to the north."

Kong Tingyun sighed regretfully.

"It's a pity he was in the sea, not on land. He touched the earth vein too late, and managed to escape."

"He had indeed escaped but his body is ruined. He may have a backup at a temple in the north, perhaps another monk's body to take over, but his cultivation has pretty much been devastated. He won't be able to compare to Situ Mo any longer; it will take him at least decades to recover."

Buddhist cultivators were notoriously difficult to kill, and Kong Tingyun never truly believed she could eliminate him. She extended her slender hand, summoning the golden mountain.

With a hint of resentment, she said, "The ancestor entrusted me with this dharma artifact and talisman specifically to deal with these cultivators from Zhao State... He's just the first! Sooner or later, they will be driven back to their original forms, one by one!"

Li Yuanjiao breathed a sigh of relief, feeling his spirits lifting as he said, "Good, good! With this monk gone, we no longer need to worry about the enemy lurking in the shadows while we're out in the open. The threat from Situ Mo is significantly reduced!"

Kongheng, who had contributed little throughout the encounter, looked guilty. He rubbed his bald head nervously, silently glancing at the others.
