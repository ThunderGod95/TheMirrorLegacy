# Chapter 997: Changes

‘Sovereign's Perilous Tread Body Divine Ability...’

Golden light flashed atop Gardenia Scenery Mountain. Li Zhouwei withdrew his divine ability and exhaled. His eyes snapped open, the golden sheen within them receding.

It was just as he had predicted. The cultivation speed for Sovereign's Perilous Tread remained enhanced even at the Purple Mansion Realm level for divine abilities. Unfortunately, the boost was no longer as terrifying as it had been during the Foundation Establishment Realm. After all, mastering a divine ability was a slow, grinding process. Li Ximing himself had cultivated for ten years and consumed a Talisman Pill just to perfect Audience with the Celestial Gate.

Five years had passed since the fall of Wanling Heaven. Li Zhouwei had spent the first year or so healing, and nearly half the remaining time advancing his Sovereign's Perilous Tread. He still had a long way to go.

‘Thankfully, with Granduncle here, I’ve been able to use one Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill after another. My progress is no worse than those from the major Daoist Traditions. I estimate... if I don't take another Talisman Pill, I'll only need three more years at most to master Sovereign's Perilous Tread.’

He rose, only to see someone from the mountain coming to report. A Demon General in black robes climbed the peak, trembling so badly he didn't dare lift his eyes. He knelt before Li Zhouwei and stammered, "Yan... Yan Hu... pays respects to the Great King!"

Li Zhouwei recognized him as one of the Demon beasts who acted on his Granduncle's behalf in the Southern Borderlands. He gave a slight nod.

Yan Hu quickly continued, "Reporting to the Great King! This subordinate received orders from the Great Suopo King to invite the Daoist Master. The Demon King Qingyan has obtained a treasure and wishes to trade for it. It is inconvenient for him to come to the lake, so he requests the Daoist Master's presence..."

"Poluoduo?"

Li Zhouwei knew of this matter; it was one of Li Ximing's connections in the Southern Borderlands. He asked the question, and Yan Hu nodded hastily, replying with respect:

"It was originally set to be at Poluoduo... but in recent years, the White Victory Dao has grown terrifyingly strong. I heard they have a new Lord, and their influence has already spread to Poluoduo, destabilizing the situation... Even the Great Suopo King no longer stays in Poluoduo often... They are both in the West Sea... They said they are at Bojun Mountain in the West Sea."

Li Zhouwei heard this and immediately understood their apprehension. After all, the Great Suopo King, Fuxun, held a grudge against the White Victory Dao. No one wanted to be dragged into that affair.

However, Li Ximing had already sorted out his cultivation manuals and summoned Li Jiangchun for a long talk. He had left the mountain long ago, flying toward the Eastern Sea to trade for a Dao Lineage with Liu Changdie, and to visit Li Que'wan while he was there.

‘Furthermore, the Wall-Sinking Water in the Qunyi Archipelago region is becoming increasingly scarce. In five years, we’ve only acquired two Neck Feathers. Even though Granduncle has a good relationship with Daoist Master Kuang Yu, he can’t keep asking to buy Wall-Sinking Water in bulk... Granduncle mentioned long ago that he needed to make a trip to the West Sea...’

He gave a casual order, "The Daoist Master is still in the Eastern Sea. You may go and wait for now."

Just as Yan Hu retreated, Li Zhouwei picked up a jade slip, preparing to return to the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. But he suddenly paused and looked up toward the north.

A luminous cloud was spreading, shifting the heavens. A multicoloured radiance shot into the sky, dyeing the northern horizon silver-white. Li Zhouwei took a single step into the Great Void to observe it more closely.

"That's Chengshui Marsh..."

He waited patiently on the mountain for several hours before Chen Yang finally came up to report, his expression grave.

Chen Yang's cultivation had progressed rapidly; he had already built a deep foundation in the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm and carried an air of steady, solid advancement. He bowed at the steps and said respectfully, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, Lord Zhong Qian of the Chengyun Immortal Sect in the Huai River Dao has broken through to become a Daoist Master, taking the title 'Zhonggong'. All the families of the Huai River Dao have gone to offer congratulations."

Li Zhouwei set down his cup, unsurprised. He nodded. "This was a natural culmination of his efforts. He always deserved a place among those with divine abilities."

Chen Yang hesitated slightly, his knees planted firmly on the ground. He shuffled forward a bit and said respectfully, "However... according to the current traditions system, Daoist Master Zhonggong is a figure of the Huai River Dao, but also a Daoist Master of the Zhao State. Although he has a past relationship with our family... this congratulatory gift..."

"It matters not..."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow and took a box from his sleeve. Inside, resting in the center, was an ink-black scale. He instructed, "Have someone deliver this Cangzhou Serpent Scale. Count it as a congratulatory gift from our Li family."

Chen Yang nodded repeatedly. Just as he was about to withdraw, Li Zhouwei suddenly stopped him, raising an eyebrow. "I have been in seclusion for so long, but I heard your good news. Jinxi has achieved Foundation Establishment?"

Chen Yang quickly bowed, smiling. "Reporting to the Daoist Master... he is an unworthy one, not worth mentioning! He just had a bit of luck and managed to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Of my three descendants... Jinbao perished, leaving only him and Jinguang. Now that he has succeeded, we just have to see about Jinguang."

Li Zhouwei nodded and passed a jade box into his hand, speaking softly. "We are all family... I must also offer a gift."

...

Dharma light flickered, glowing softly in the shadows.

The pavilion was utterly silent. Rows of jade slips were locked onto high shelves, bathing the room in white light. A young man paced through, his brow tightly furrowed, his gaze constantly sweeping across the room.

"It's not here... How can it not be here..."

Li Suining was using a break in his cultivation to explore this Secret Pavilion.

The family's Embyronic Breathing and Qi Refining manuals were generally stored in two places: one was the Dao Palace in the Milin Mountains, and the other was this Secret Pavilion on the island. The former was mostly for Guest Retainers, Dharma Protectors, and visiting members of other clans to borrow. The latter was for relatives of the main clan. But in reality, the line for 'main clan relatives' was blurry. The various major and minor families were all related to some degree.

Some trusted Guest Retainers and Dharma Protectors could also come here. The only reason to separate out the Milin Mountains Dao Palace was as a gesture of goodwill to the various attached families from the Eastern Shore and the Wilderness.

After all, the family's core manuals for Foundation Establishment and for Purple Mansion Realm 'seeds' had to be kept restricted. They couldn't let their foundation be seen just to show goodwill, hence the separation.

‘The King of Wei's Mandate of Heaven is bright. He allowed our family to acquire many Purple Mansion Realm manuals, putting our inner reserves on par with an Immortal Sect. Because we have this foundation, our clan's restrictions are the most relaxed in all of Yue State...’

But as his gaze swept over the dazzling array of manuals, walking from the east side of the pavilion to the west, his hands rising and falling, he felt only shock and doubt.

‘How can it not be here!’

This was already his third visit since arriving on the island three months ago. The Art of the Golden Tablet from his past life truly wasn't here!

It was one thing for the Art of the Golden Tablet from the Profound Dipper's Balance to be missing, but even the Art of the Watchful Awakening Star from the Celestial-Awakening Ear was gone!

A shadow instantly fell over his heart. The Art of the Golden Tablet was crucial. Not only did it significantly boost formation arts, but more importantly, it was aligned with the subsequent Sacred Scroll of the Star Court... This affected the entire tapestry of his plans!

It didn't matter if he lacked the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court for a while; he could easily substitute the Art of the Golden Tablet. But if he didn't even have the Art of the Golden Tablet... what was he supposed to cultivate?!

This wasn't something he could use just by having a copy in his memory! The most important tools Immortal Sects and Immortal Clans used to maintain their rule were Spiritual Qi and cultivation manuals. Without a faction to gather Spiritual Qi for him, it wouldn't matter if he had a Ninth-Rank manual in his head, let alone the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court!

‘In my past life, I was in seclusion for over a year before I even qualified to break through to Qi Refining... Did the family obtain it during that year?’

He fell into deep thought. He returned to the front of the pavilion and saw a middle-aged man tidying the jade slips, his head bowed low. The man was meticulously wiping them with an oiled cotton cloth. When he saw Li Suining come down, he quickly looked up.

"Greetings, Young Master... Are you looking for a particular manual? My surname is Chi, and I am humbled to be the caretaker of the Secret Pavilion..."

Li Suining glanced at him and asked with a frown, "Elder, do you have the authority to retrieve them?"

"Naturally, I do not."

The caretaker, Chi, gave an awkward smile and pointed. "I just run the errands. If the Young Master sees one he fancies, I will go to the opposite building and request Lord White Ape to fetch it. But judging by your appearance... you are probably here to _receive_ a manual... That involves the matter of Spiritual Qi..."

Li Suining nodded, considering this for a moment before replying, "That won't be necessary..."

This reminder suddenly made his mind go blank.

‘Wait... gathering qi can take five or ten years. If the family didn't have the Art of the Golden Tablet, how did they manage the Spiritual Qi? Even if they got the manual within that year, how long would it take to gather the qi? How would I have had time? It was clearly there in my past life!’

He suppressed his thoughts and was about to leave the pavilion when a cold wind suddenly swept in, rushing into the room. A young man in white robes descended on the breeze.

The youth's robes were simple. He had dark, arched eyebrows, dark eyes, a high brow-bone, and a straight, high nose, which lent him a measure of steadiness. His long hair was tied back, and his features were exceptional. A sword hung at his waist, sheathed in a white jade scabbard—one of his few adornments of nobility. He landed in the pavilion and glanced up.

The man named Chi hurried forward, bowed, and said respectfully, "Greetings, my Lord..."

"No need for formalities!"

His voice was clear and cold. He bid the man rise, and his gaze quickly swept the room, landing on Li Suining. A trace of surprise flickered in his eyes, and he smiled. "And which clan brother is this?"

Li Suining was stunned for a moment before he bowed to the ground, forcing his voice to remain steady.

"Greetings, Young Uncle... This junior is Suining, from the direct line of the Yuanwan branch..."

"The direct line of the Yuanwan branch?"

The white-robed youth before him looked even younger than himself, yet he was already of his uncle's generation. He stepped forward, placed a hand on Li Suining's wrist, and quickly helped him up, smiling. "Good... so you are Suining! You actually recognize me?"

The voice was bright and amiable, but it made Li Suining's heart clench.

How could he not recognize him?

This uncle of his, Li Jiangchun, was not old, but he was the one who, after a hundred years, had once again linked the Li family to the legacy of the Sword Immortals! His Celestial Moon Sword Art, combined with his Lesser Yin dharma power, had slain the Shu General Li Nitan, alarming the Song Emperor enough to summon him to the capital for a reward... In three duels, he had so infuriated the Second Prince of the Great Song that the prince supposedly never practiced the sword again...

His premature death had shaken the court, causing the King of Wei to return from campaign and the hundred officials to enter the palace at midnight. It could even be said that his death was what triggered the great conflict between Shu and Song...

And now, here he was, standing before him, so bright and transcendent. How could Li Suining not be stunned? But his mind was sharp, and he reacted instantly, replying without a second thought:

"Suining has just met several brothers. I guessed that you, my Lord, must be an elder. Factoring in your age, attire, and Dharma swords, I ventured a guess..."

Li Jiangchun nodded thoughtfully and smiled. "No need to be so formal... We are the same age."

Li Suining flushed. It was _because_ they were the same age that Li Jiangchun had drawn so much attention in his past life. When Li Jiangchun slew the Shu General, he, Li Suining, was still worrying about Foundation Establishment!

Li Jiangchun took two steps forward. His eyes were clear and bright, yet they held the sharp edge unique to a sword cultivator. He followed him into the pavilion and smiled. "I just came down from Gardenia Scenery Mountain. I was actually looking for you. I heard that the elders... acquired a batch of cultivation manuals and technique scrolls this year, including some sword arts. They've been sent down the mountain to be added to the pavilion's collection. I was overjoyed, so I came to find Elder White Ape... I was thinking I'd pick out a sword art and then head to the west side to find you..."

"It's quite the coincidence that you're here too."

Half of the doubt in Li Suining's heart dissolved. He nodded inwardly.

‘Just as I thought... Both the Art of the Golden Tablet and the Art of the Watchful Awakening Star are part of the batch being added right now. I was just a little too early, so of course I couldn't find them.’

As he mulled this over, Li Jiangchun led him up to the second floor of the pavilion. He lightly tapped the door, engaging the main formation lock, before his smile faded and his expression turned serious.

"Regarding the matter of the formation manuals you mentioned, we have news. I was ordered by the Daoist Master to come down from the mountain."

Li Suining knew things had changed from his old timeline. He immediately bowed in the pavilion and offered his thanks. Li Jiangchun set down a jade slip and laughed.

"No need for that... If you're thanking anyone, thank the Daoist Master."

He spoke seriously, "The Daoist Master has gone to the Eastern Sea and has not yet returned. He has business to attend to, and he will also be trading for a formation dao lineage for you from an elder... We don't know when he will be back. Daoist Master Minghuang has come out of seclusion and asked me to come down the mountain to find you... First, to meet you... and second, to arrange for your pills."

Li Suining's heart shook. He quickly bowed again, but Li Jiangchun shook his head.

"These pills... are for you to use in seclusion. You must quickly cultivate to the peak of the fifth level of Embyronic Breathing. When you are done, come find me. I have another pill for you here. I will arrange an Immortal's abode for you to perfect the Embyronic Breathing realm."

Li Suining's heart leaped.

From those few sentences, he had roughly pieced everything together.

‘First... the Daoist Master went to the Eastern Sea... to get the Dao Lineage for me. That must mean he's looking for Daoist Master Yuanbian.’

‘In my past life, I only heard that he went straight to the West Sea and was delayed there. Is it because I revealed my talent for formations early... that his trip to the West Sea has been postponed?!’

A momentary joy filled his heart. He shivered slightly and asked, "This junior was just thinking that I should focus on breaking through to the fifth level of Embyronic Breathing. That way, when I meet the Daoist Master to receive the formation Dao Lineage... I will be better prepared!"

"Exactly!"

Li Jiangchun smiled and replied, "The Daoist Master said he will return in a few months, which is enough time for you to break through."

Li Suining pondered this inwardly.

In his past life, he entered the island to cultivate and went into seclusion in his Immortal's abode for six months. Suddenly, the mountains shook and the earth quaked. Only then did he learn that the Buddhist cultivators had come... The Wilderness was under sudden attack, a great battle between Purple Mansion Realm experts erupted, and chaos reigned. The casualties were heavy. Ding Weizeng and An Xuanxin both died in the battle...

At that time, the lake was caught completely off guard. Only Li Zhouwei was there to fight back. Li Ximing was still in the distant West Sea, unable to return!

‘It's possible... the Daoist Master might return in time...’

Li Suining had never imagined he could influence Li Ximing's movements! Even being reborn, he never thought he could control every outcome. Even facing the turmoil in the Wilderness, his only thought had been to save Ding Weizeng... He never dreamed he could affect a battle at the Purple Mansion Realm level!

He knew that in his past life, the Li family had barely managed to protect itself in that great war... Li Ximing's intervention was not necessarily a good thing. His heart pounded, a mix of joy and apprehension.

‘If the Daoist Master really does return in time... will the final outcome of this war be changed? And if it changes... will it be for good or for ill? If the Daoist Master's participation leads to injury, or... or an even greater misfortune... wouldn't I be the one to blame?!’
