# Chapter 731: A Scene of Devastation

The roar echoed like thunder, a low rumble that promised a storm. On the river, the battling cultivators paused almost as one.

The first to look up was Cui Jueyin.

He cultivated the Eternal Brightness Steps, the only art in the Bright Yang lineage capable of binding and restraining. Hailing from the main line of the Chongzhou Cui clan, who had studied the nature of Profound Light for centuries, his mastery of it surpassed even Li Zhouwei’s.

Brilliant light radiated from his sleeves—blinding, searing, pushing, and pulling. He had the four cultivators before him spinning in circles, unable to even touch the hem of his robes. He was the only member of the Li contingent who remained unscathed.

Cui Jueyin’s expression had been as placid as still water, but the roar struck him like a bolt from the blue. His control over the Profound Light nearly slipped. He shot his gaze upward, just in time to see the white scales bristling on Li Zhouwei’s neck.

‘What?’

A complex look washed over his face. He took an involuntary step forward, hesitating in mid-air. In that brief instant, his hold on the Profound Light loosened, and an enemy guest elder seized the opening. The man swept aside the light and lunged. Cui Jueyin reacted instantly, sidestepping to nullify the attack, but the fight had become much tighter, and he was once more locked in a bitter struggle.

Guan Kan's skull-headed Dharma Body faced forward as the earth beneath it split open. The river surged forth, its shallow, black Pit Water churning. Li Zhouwei’s eyes lingered on the body for a fraction of a second, and his scaled neck performed an unnervingly human-like swallowing motion.

In the next instant, he vanished. Ripples of Profound Light spread as he reappeared before Guan Gongxiao. The blood-red veins in his eyes and the white scales on his neck were gone, leaving only a face covered in jagged wounds.

Guan Gongxiao, however, was desperately channeling his arts. Crimson light flared as his cry for help continued to echo across the battlefield.

“Reinforcements! We need reinforcements now!!”

His plea threw the aggressive formation of the Capital immortals Dao into disarray. Cultivators from all directions—guest elders, clan elders, and core disciples alike—broke from their fights to rush to his aid. Li Zhouwei simply thrust his halberd, pouring all his energy into shattering the crimson light spewing from Guan Gongxiao. Just then, a deep voice boomed from the heavens:

“Where Yang culminates, the Six Thunders are born!”

It was Li Chenghui.

Li Chenghui was by no means weak, and his cultivation was substantial. He had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm before Li Ximing’s seclusion and, after a decade, was ready to challenge the mid-stage. But a breakthrough required years of seclusion, and he had spent that time following Li Zhouwei, putting out fires all over their territory. There had been no time for himself.

Years before Li Ximing emerged, Li Chenghui was already on the verge of advancing. But as the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion pressed harder, he had funneled all his energy into mastering the Dao of Thunder.

The Capital immortals Dao, being a sect from the Eastern Sea, had clearly planned for him. The two disciples sent to intercept him cultivated the Dao of Pit Water and the Dao of True Fire, respectively—both highly resistant to lightning.

But now, silver-white lightning exploded with a searing radiance. Struck by the full force of his attack, his two opponents were forced to retreat.

Li Chenghui’s grasp of battlefield timing was sharp. Seizing the moment of distraction Li Zhouwei's shout had created, he fully unleashed his Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman. His figure shot out from the ensuing cascade of lightning, riding the thunder to appear before Guan Gongxiao in a flash.

The moment the thunder cracked, Li Zhouwei had already looked up. A beam of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light shot from between his brows. Guan Gongxiao had no time to worry about Li Chenghui; he brandished a talisman in one hand while forming a seal with the other. The sandstorm of Radiant Essence swirled up once more to meet the incoming beam.

Guan Gongxiao’s sandstorm was no match for Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, but it was enough to block it for a moment. What more could he ask for when his element was countered?

Though he had averted the immediate crisis, he had no time to relax. The space beside him warped as Li Chenghui opened his mouth and spat out a brilliant white pinpoint of light.

The Secret Art of the Purple Talisman’s Primal Light!

The point of light expanded in an instant. Guan Gongxiao barely had time to throw his head back and activate the talisman in his other hand when a massive explosion rocked the air.

*BOOM!*

A circular wave of white light pulsed outward, sweeping across the river. The water churned violently, and boulders tumbled from the cliffs. The white light swelled into a cascading waterfall of violet lightning that poured down from the sky.

Guan Gongxiao’s protective shield evaporated into nothingness under the deluge. The young master of the Capital immortals Dao was truly laden with treasures; he was only grazed by the stray bolts. But a halberd wreathed in roaring black flames was already upon him.

Gritting his teeth, Guan Gongxiao tore himself free from the lightning’s embrace. He activated his Sorrowful Southern Water art, dissolving into a spray of gray water that weaved through the currents of his own technique.

But he didn’t escape unscathed. The halberd clipped him, and a searing heat spread across his back, his Daoist robe sizzling. Knowing Li Zhouwei’s eye technique would see through his escape, he materialized by the riverbank and dashed toward the nearest person.

That person was a square-faced, large-nosed guest elder from the Capital immortals Dao, who was rushing to his aid. He held what looked to be a Wood Virtue art in his hands. Before he could reach his young master, a black-flamed halberd flew toward him.

The guest elder didn’t dare to receive the blow. His spell vanished as he took a step back, leaving Guan Gongxiao to face the attack alone. The young master was so furious he could have spit blood. Fortunately, Guan Lingdie, having fought Li Zhouwei before, was already watching. A white dart flew from her hand, striking the halberd with a clang and knocking its tip upward. Guan Gongxiao seized the chance to unleash his sandstorm, dispelling the Profound Light and allowing him to escape through the water.

Li Zhouwei finally retracted his halberd. Li Chenghui, meanwhile, drove back the two cultivators who had come to entangle him. At last, the chaotic battle on the river came to a standstill as the two sides gradually separated.

Guan Gongxiao, his face pale, materialized on the opposite bank. The Capital immortals Dao cultivators disengaged one by one and gathered by his side. They had the upper hand in numbers, so retreating was easy enough.

Killing Guan Gongxiao was impossible. With both Yehui and Li Ximing observing from the Great Void, neither side would dare to kill the other’s successor unless the conflict escalated to the Purple Mansion Realm.

The Li family had absolutely no desire for that to happen. Li Zhouwei had broken free from a three-man assault, crippled Gongsun Bofan, and killed Guan Kan, all while having strength to spare. The outcome of this battle was already sealed.

Though the Li family was outnumbered and in a precarious position, the Capital immortals Dao had no one left who could stop Li Zhouwei. A direct descendant of a Purple Mansion cultivator like him was a tiger among a flock of sheep when fighting guest elders; his presence could single-handedly turn the tide.

‘And that scholar of the Bright Yang Dao… he’s no simple character either… It seems our Dao wasn't the only one paying a high price these past few years. The Li Clan has been preparing in secret…’

With the immediate danger past, Guan Gongxiao’s mind settled. He swept his gaze over Li Zhouwei and the others, then felt the jade bead bracelet in his sleeve. Only three of the ten beads had shattered. A sliver of comfort returned to him.

‘At the very least, Shanji Prefecture and the Profound Peak Gate are out of the Li Clan’s hands now. We’ve secured seven locations, and our forces in the wilderness have crossed the river and established several footholds. It wasn’t a total loss.’

As he consoled himself, the battlefield fell utterly silent. Li Zhouwei stood with his halberd, his gaze fixed on him as the wound on his forehead slowly sealed itself. Li Chenghui and Cui Jueyin stood at his flanks. Guan Gongxiao felt a surge of pressure.

“You are truly skilled, Fellow Daoist,” he said, his voice tight.

With that final remark, he turned and rode a current of water away. The three Dharma Artifacts still pinned beneath the bright tower were beyond saving. He could only abandon them. Li Zhouwei watched him go, the wound on his forehead now completely gone.

Guan Gongxiao fled in disarray. The wind whistled past his ears, but the silence from his retinue was deafening. No one dared to speak. It was only after they were deep within their own territory that Guan Lingdie approached, her voice soft and consoling.

“Li Zhouwei is a man like Tu Longjian or Guo Shentong,” she murmured. “Favored by the heavens. It’s a cosmic injustice that only a Divine Ability can match. Don’t take it to heart, brother.”

“I understand,” Guan Gongxiao replied. Though he had lost both men and face, he was not discouraged. “Someone else will deal with him. We need only do our best.”

***

**Funan Territory.**

A golden mist of True Fire permeated the sky.

Li Minggong held the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier aloft, its pillar of fire holding the golden mist at bay. Beside her, the Chongming Profound Insight Screen shimmered with an iridescent green light, capturing the golden rays one by one.

The battle in the Funan Territory was nearing its end. Situ Mo, Master of the Golden Tang Gate, hovered high in the air, his diamond-patterned golden feather robe dancing in the wind. One hand was locked around Ding Weizeng’s longstaff. Golden Qi streamed down his cheeks, giving him a terrifying appearance.

His opponent, Ding Weizeng, was in a far more wretched state. His Dharma Body was covered in wounds from which dark red blood flowed freely. A massive gash on his abdomen revealed his internal organs, which pulsed with the faint light of Dharma Treasures.

Situ Mo glared at him, his eyes darting from side to side. That damned, foul-mouthed Hooked Serpent was still lurking somewhere nearby.

‘Time is running out…’

Situ Mo had lived up to his reputation; his methods were even more formidable than the Li family had anticipated. He had single-handedly fought both Ding Weizeng and the Hooked Serpent, steadily inflicting heavier and heavier wounds on Ding Weizeng… and that was with the Chongming Profound Insight Screen in the sky, a perfect counter to his flying swords and needles.

Although Ding Weizeng had been injured earlier while fighting six opponents, Situ Mo’s performance was still astonishing. Li Wushao, the Hooked Serpent, was no common demon; the two venomous stingers on his tail were enough to make anyone shudder.

And it was because of those stingers that Situ Mo was in his current predicament. Caught off guard earlier, he had been grazed on the chin. An icy chill had immediately spread down to his chest, and several pills had only temporarily suppressed it. One of his own idiots, unaware of the Hooked Serpent’s potency, had been struck and nearly fell from the sky.

‘Use your pig brain for once!’ Situ Mo fumed internally. ‘The Li family is a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan! The common Hooked Serpents from the sea floor… the white ones are alright, but the black ones are pathetic cowards. Even dragons find them unpalatable… Why would the Li family value one? This black serpent must be something else entirely!’

Having spent years in the Eastern Sea, Situ Mo was an expert on its creatures. He didn’t dare get hit again, which forced him to fight cautiously. With his favorite techniques countered, he found himself in a stalemate.

As for the other members of the Golden Tang Gate, Situ Biao was tied up with Li Minggong. Though he had the upper hand, Li Wushao’s occasional support strikes made him hesitant. Elder White Ape and Li Chenghuai were each engaged with their own opponents.

It was the Dawn Rayfish that proved to be the most surprisingly effective. Its noble lineage was apparent as it darted back and forth, single-handedly pinning down three cultivators. Its attacks weren’t life-threatening, but they were fast and vicious. It must have learned some advanced arts from Li Xizhi, as it was now capable of creating illusionary clones. The sky was filled with its phantoms, making it impossible to tell real from illusion.

As the battle dragged on, Situ Mo saw no sign of reinforcements from the Capital immortals Dao. He was beginning to grow anxious when he finally spotted several streaks of light approaching from the east. The cultivators from the Midong territory had arrived.

The leader was a round-faced woman. Li Minggong recognized her as Song Yunbai, and her heart sank.

‘This is trouble!’

Her forces were already stretched to their limit against the Golden Tang Gate. Below, a guest elder poisoned by the serpent was running rampant, sowing chaos and making a desperate situation even worse. If more enemies arrived, they would have no choice but to retreat.

As the woman drew closer, Situ Mo recognized her as well. While he was reverent toward the Capital immortals Dao and superficially polite to the Li family, he had no such courtesy for Song Yunbai.

“You girl!” he boomed. “What took the Midong forces so long?”

“What took so long?” Song Yunbai was not intimidated. Her tone was laced with sarcasm. “It’s not as if we could just march right in like you, Gate Master! Li Chenghui broke the grand array on Hongfu Mountain… the entire mountain is crawling with rogue cultivators and noble clans. The Daoist Master himself said to secure it, so we couldn’t afford to be careless.”

She smiled as she approached him. “If the Gate Master is dissatisfied… perhaps your clan’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivator might be so kind as to ask our Daoist Master about it?”

It wasn’t a great secret that the Golden Tang Gate’s Purple Mansion cultivator was a wanderer. Her words were polite and technically flawless, but the insult was sharp. Situ Mo’s face darkened, but now was not the time for an outburst.

“Then get over here and help!” he snarled.

Song Yunbai, however, simply bowed. “You misunderstand, Gate Master. Our Young Master used a secret talisman to retreat from the wilderness. I received the message and came to inform you.”

As soon as she spoke, the morale of the Li Clan’s cultivators surged. Song Yunbai flicked her sleeves, ignoring Situ Mo’s cold, ugly expression. After making a token gesture to cover his withdrawal, she prepared to ride the wind and depart. A knot of fury tightened in Situ Mo’s chest.

“Withdraw!” he finally choked out.

He instantly retracted his art, dodged a pair of stingers that shot out from nowhere, and retreated abruptly. On the battlefield, everyone was wounded; no one on the Li side dared to give chase.

After all, Li Minggong had been worn down by both Situ Mo and Situ Biao. She had consumed her elixirs and played all her trump cards. If either the Chongming Profound Insight Screen or the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier had been even a fraction weaker, she would have been incinerated into True Fire long ago. Pursuit was out of the question.

Ding Weizeng was the most severely injured, though his Dharma Body made his condition appear less dire. Elder White Ape and the Dawn Rayfish had sustained minor injuries. Li Wushao, the sneaky serpent, had been highly effective and had only suffered a few sword cuts.

Li Chenghuai, who had little combat ability, had faced a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. But he was equipped with the Supreme Feather Night-robe and a Night Ghost Secret Talisman from his parents. His opponent couldn’t even touch him and was instead harassed relentlessly by the night ghost. As a result, Li Chenghuai was in the best condition, having barely expended any spiritual energy.

The tension finally broke, and Li Minggong nearly collapsed. She waved Li Chenghuai over to handle the aftermath.

“They captured Elder Siwei…” she murmured, her voice filled with anguish. “I have no face to see the Old Master!”

Li Chenghuai offered a word of comfort and had Elder White Ape help her away. Below them, fires raged and black smoke billowed. The Funan territory, which had just begun to recover, was once again a scene of devastation, with the arrays on most of its mountain peaks shattered. It was a ruin.
