# Chapter 689: An Elder's Counsel

Li Ximing had only caught a glimpse before Wang Long was already bustling to gather the books. Zhang Gui strode over and silently picked up the scattered volumes. Once they had restacked the heavy tomes, Zhang Gui finally spoke in a low voice.

“He really isn’t here…”

The two envoys exchanged a look, a silent understanding passing between them. Wang Long flipped open a purple-and-gold booklet from the bottom of the stack. Zhang Gui’s brush moved, writing for a moment on the page as a violet-gold light flowed from the tip.

“…Jing Province, Moongaze Marsh, now known as Moongaze Lake…” Zhang Gui murmured. He paused, then asked quietly, “Ximing, you haven't spent many years cultivating in other lands, have you? This is a serious matter. You mustn't hide anything from me.”

Li Ximing figured that his name should have been in their records all along. Since they couldn't find it, they were likely adding it unofficially now. He had nothing to hide. “That’s correct,” he said plainly.

Zhang Gui wrote two more characters. “Your Daoist Master name?”

After a moment of thought, Li Ximing replied, “Zhaojing.”

As Zhang Gui bent over his work, Li Ximing rested a hand on his storage pouch. After a quick search, he produced two jade boxes from his sleeve. “Thank you for taking the trouble to come all this way,” he said softly. “A small gift, to show my gratitude.”

“You’re too kind, Fellow Daoist.”

Zhang Gui didn’t stop writing, but he lifted his head to offer a word of thanks before returning to his task. Wang Long, however, eagerly accepted the boxes with a slight nod.

“It’s merely our duty,” Wang Long chirped. “You are too courteous.”

Li Ximing noted their practiced ease; this was clearly a customary exchange. The jade boxes couldn't block spiritual sense, and inside were a Drystone Brightfruit that Lu Ken had given him years ago and a vial of Baleful Earth Coldspring. One treasure was of the Earth Virtue and the other was infused with baleful qi, both having some connection to the Underworld. They were the best items he could find in his storage pouch on such short notice.

‘No one ever mentioned that the Underworld sends envoys to register new divine powers,’ he thought. ‘Fortunately, judging by Wang Long’s reaction, these two items are acceptable. I haven't offended them.’

Just as the thought crossed his mind, Zhang Gui finished writing. He put away the massive, pestle-like brush and clasped his hands in a salute. “The registration is complete. We’ve disturbed you, Fellow Daoist. With your divine power achieved, five hundred years of freedom await. When your lifespan nears its end and you seek to attain fruition, I will come again. We can speak more then.”

Wang Long hoisted the books, and together, the two tore open the Great Void, disappearing into a boundless blackness as they returned to the Underworld.

Li Ximing waited a moment, sweeping the area with the celestial light from his brow to confirm he was alone. A swirl of uncertainty filled his mind. ‘Yang Tianya has connections in the Underworld. He kept his own breakthrough a secret, which means he’s plotting something. By letting me see these two envoys, it seems he’s making a gesture of goodwill.’

‘On the other hand… my name wasn’t in the registry, and those two added it themselves. Was that on the orders of the person backing Yang Tianya? Someone with his standing is likely trying to help me.’

In light of this, the two treasures he had offered seemed trivial. Li Ximing set his doubts aside for the moment and considered his next steps. ‘Now that I’ve reached the Purple Mansion Realm, I’m expected to announce it to all the major families and sects. I doubt I can keep it a secret…’

‘But for cultivators like me, who reached the Purple Mansion Realm through the combined strength of their entire clan, the situation is different. I’m not a lone wolf like Tu Longjian, who relies only on himself. Nor do I have the backing of a sect with other Purple Mansion cultivators. Announcing my status will involve more than just words.’

He mulled it over before reaching a decision. ‘First, I’ll visit Seniors Changxi, Chuting, and Tu Longjian to express my gratitude. Then, I’ll make the official announcement to the other sects. This shows respect, and… it will give me a chance to learn about any unspoken rules or pitfalls.’

With his course set, Li Ximing suppressed his aura and plunged into the Great Void, making his way toward the Xiao family’s domain.

This was his first time traversing the Great Void. His divine power shielded his body, masking his radiance as he flew in silence. He looked around at a world of utter blackness that undulated and warped, constantly shifting up and down.

The Great Void was a reflection of the spiritual qi of the world. It wasn't flat, but a landscape of peaks and valleys. Where spiritual qi was dense, the Great Void formed a high mountain. Where it was thin for a thousand miles, crossing that distance in the Great Void was but a single step.

The moment he achieved his divine power and looked into the Great Void, he understood.

Purple Mansion cultivators could travel thousands of miles in an instant by following the barren, low-qi paths in the Great Void, crossing vast distances with each step. If an entire region was saturated with spiritual qi, it was actually faster to exit the Great Void and fly using one’s divine power. Of course, if a place had no spiritual qi at all, it simply wouldn't exist in the Great Void, making it impossible to reach.

Li Ximing journeyed for a short while, following several of these shortcuts. In less than a minute, he had arrived in the region of Mount Xianyou. Here, the void was no longer pitch black. Rings of azure light rippled through the space like waves on water.

He halted his divine power, his pupils glowing with a faint golden light as he activated his ocular art. ‘So this is a formation… The Xiao family now has a Purple Mansion-grade formation severing the Great Void. Displaying it so openly is a show of force, a far cry from the days when Chi Buzi could sneak through their defenses to threaten Xiao Guitu…’

His own clan had received similar treatment back then, though Chi Buzi had been careless enough to glimpse the Immortal Mirror and gained nothing for his efforts. A flicker of desire sparked in Li Ximing’s heart as he secretly calculated the cost. ‘If I get the chance, I must ask Senior Chuting about this. A formation like this would make the family infinitely safer.’

He had barely stopped when a ray of white light shot out from the formation and landed before him. A hazy figure materialized, and an old, authoritative voice emanated from within.

“Which Fellow Daoist has come to visit? Please, enter the formation and we shall speak.”

Li Ximing, not wishing to reveal his identity, had kept his divine power suppressed. He gave a slight nod and followed the white light into the formation. His vision instantly brightened.

A cold mist swirled around towering peaks. Two cliffs faced each other, dotted with gnarled pines and cypresses. Below, the water of a frigid pond was clear as crystal. A small boat rested silently on its surface, where the faint figure of an old man could be seen fishing.

Snow was falling, crunching softly underfoot. Li Ximing stood on the bank, bowed deeply, and said in a soft voice, “Junior Zhaojing, Li Ximing, pays his respects to the Daoist Master!”

There was a soft *creak*. The white jade fishing rod dipped as something below took the bait, only to grow wary and dart away with a flick of its tail. Ripples spread across the water, making the thin ice tinkle.

The old man calmly set down his fishing rod. “So it is Daoist Master Zhaojing,” he said. “I thought it was Chengyan. Forgive my lack of courtesy. Please, come aboard.”

Li Ximing took a single step, his form blurring in a flash of bright light before reappearing on the boat. Xiao Chuting set out a small table with two jade cups and placed a verdant jade pot upon it.

As Li Ximing took a seat, Xiao Chuting put that pot away and took out another, pouring a cup for him. “Try this,” he said with a smile.

Li Ximing took a sip.

The tea had a light flavor, and its spiritual energy was only mediocre—hardly fitting for someone of Xiao Chuting’s stature. As Li Ximing felt a flicker of confusion, the old man spoke.

“Years ago, when Li Tongya came to Crowncloud Peak, I served him this same Clearlight Fruit Leaf Tea. He thought it a great treasure and dared not drink much.”

“Today,” Xiao Chuting continued, “this tea is a common beverage even for your clan.”

Li Ximing understood his meaning and replied respectfully, “Senior, my entire clan remembers your immense kindness and would never dare to forget it. Having been fortunate enough to succeed in my breakthrough, I came to find you first. I thought you were still in the Northern Sea, so this is a pleasant surprise.”

“Good. The matter in the Northern Sea was settled long ago.” Xiao Chuting praised him with a nod and a smile. “I appreciate the sentiment. However, you should have first visited Si Boxiu. The man is a stickler for rules and values his reputation. If you don’t show him proper respect, that old traditionalist may not say anything, but he will certainly hold it against you.”

Li Ximing had planned to visit Tu Longjian second and Changxi third, leaving Si Boxiu for last. Hearing this, his heart tightened. “Thank you for the guidance, Senior!”

Xiao Chuting’s voice was warm. “You were able to overcome the trials of the Purple Mansion Realm so quickly, which speaks to your strong character. But Si Boxiu’s lifespan is nearing its end. He is at his most sensitive. You should have stabilized your relationship with him first. If you visit an outsider like me before him, what do you think he will assume?”

“Fortunately, you haven’t yet announced your breakthrough, so it doesn't officially count. You also came here with your divine power suppressed, so Si Boxiu is likely still debating whether you succeeded or not. He has the Dongli Sect’s Secret Records, but you consumed the Radiant Sky Stone. Since he never cultivated Bright Yang himself, he has no way to accurately gauge your situation.”

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully. “The Dongli Sect’s Secret Records?” he asked.

“Indeed.” Xiao Chuting took a sip of tea. “When the Dongli Sect’s grotto-heaven was carved up by the three major sects, their secret arts were divided as well. The records detail the various phenomena associated with the Bright Yang paths. Si Boxiu recognized your foundation and cultivation method back when you were still in the Foundation Establishment Realm.”

Hearing this, Li Ximing’s heart sank. His image of the stern and venerable Si Boxiu was now colored with new complexity. After thanking him again, Xiao Chuting continued.

“You won’t be able to hide your breakthrough for long. It’s only a matter of time before you’re discovered. You should announce it to the various powers soon and have your clan elevated to an Immortal Clan.”

“Once word of your divine power spreads, everyone will come to offer their congratulations. You will hold a divine power convocation, and then you must pay return visits. The first three Daoist Masters you visit are especially important. Be mindful of this.”

Li Ximing committed every word to memory, nodding with a solemn expression.

“Tu Longjian has gone to the Southern Sea,” Xiao Chuting went on. “There’s no rush to see him. He’s keeping to himself these days, trying to stay out of worldly affairs. If you visit him too hastily, you might disrupt his plans. There’s no need to reserve one of your first three official visits for him; a private visit will suffice.”

“You can visit Changxi. However, he has even less time left than Si Boxiu. The Profound Peak Gate has only one Purple Mansion cultivator, and its decline is imminent. In a few years, they might not even be able to protect their own sect.”

He paused here, seeming to observe Li Ximing’s reaction. “Consider it carefully,” he said softly. “If your friendship isn’t deep, it might be better to distance yourself now. You shouldn't be rushing to see him; he should be the one rushing to see you.”

Enlightenment dawned on Li Ximing. He knew nothing of the intricate politics of the Purple Mansion Realm. Xiao Chuting, however, was a master of it. Without an elder’s guidance, he would have made countless blunders. ‘Without knowing these subtleties, I would have been easily manipulated.’

He straightened his posture and gave a formal bow. “Zhaojing thanks the Daoist Master for his guidance!”

Xiao Chuting chuckled, a hint of warmth in his eyes. “Seeing you like this, my junior’s wish has finally been fulfilled! He suffered his whole life, treating people with sincerity only to be deceived time and again. To have a disciple like you… his bitterness has finally turned to sweetness!”

Li Ximing remembered Xiao Yuansi’s Radiant Violet Pill and nodded gently.

“Go,” Xiao Chuting said softly. “Settle your family’s affairs, then announce your achievement. Yuansi and I will attend.”

The old man’s gaze fixed on Li Ximing. He saw a flicker in the young man’s eyes at the words “settle your family’s affairs.” The youth immediately nodded, bid a quiet farewell, and vanished into the Great Void.

Alone, Xiao Chuting put away the jade cups, lost in thought. ‘He knew to come see me first, which shows he is unaware of that great figure behind him…’

He picked up his jade rod and began to fish once more in the frigid pond. As the snow fell around him, Xiao Chuting stared silently at the water, deep in contemplation.

***

By the time Li Ximing left, the purple flames on Mount Wu had begun to fade. The already fragile grand formation shuddered, and a young man descended on a bolt of lightning, holding a command token. Clad in armor and wreathed in crackling light, with eyes as dark as lacquer, it was Li Chenghui.

Behind him followed a middle-aged man in a white robe with a spear on his back. He was at the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm and wore a cautious expression. They landed within the formation together, the searing purple flames stinging their faces.

“Clan Uncle Siwei,” Li Chenghui said after a quick scan of the area. “The purple flames here are too intense. It would be unwise for the Old Master to enter. Please, stand guard outside and look after him. I will search for my uncle’s whereabouts.”

The man in white was none other than An Siwei. More than a decade had passed, and he had successfully reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, though his demeanor was as reserved as ever. He nodded and retreated, riding the wind away from the mountain.

Li Chenghui headed for the summit alone. The jade pillars had collapsed, and the ground was a web of cracks. Gardenia trees had sprouted everywhere, their white blossoms tumbling in the wind and rolling to a stop at his boots.

He searched the entire area but found no trace of Li Ximing, not even a scrap of his robes. All that remained underground were two piles of melted jade powder.

Shielding himself from the purple flames with lightning, Li Chenghui moved closer to inspect the site. ‘The Patriarch once instructed me that if a phenomenon occurred and he disappeared from the mountain, I was to keep his success or failure a secret, regardless of the outcome… He is not here now, so it falls to me.’

‘In recent years… the covert harassment and plots from the Three Sects of Xiaoshi Mountain, the Golden Tang Gate, and the demonic cultivators of Jiangbei have grown ever more brazen. This celestial phenomenon is sure to attract attention. There will be no peace for us. I must plan carefully.’

He picked a gardenia blossom, placed it in a jade box, and immediately withdrew. Outside the formation, Li Xuanxuan was waiting, his face etched with anxiety. When he saw Li Chenghui, he hurried forward.

“How is it?” he asked in a low voice.

Li Chenghui paused before answering softly, “The purple flames are too fierce. I couldn't see clearly and was forced to retreat.”

Li Xuanxuan had never truly believed Li Ximing could reach the Purple Mansion Realm, but he had clung to a sliver of hope. Now, that hope seemed to fade. He bowed his head, his voice old and weary.

“What do Minggong and Elder White Ape say?”

“My sister sent a message,” Li Chenghui replied respectfully. “The demonic cultivators near Coldcloud Peak were startled by the celestial phenomenon and have scattered. We should be safe for a few days. But the Patriarch is still in the Eastern Sea dealing with demons, so we must remain vigilant. The sects from Xiaoshi Mountain are not ordinary rogue cultivators; they will likely send someone to the lake.”

“Good.” Seeing that Li Chenghui had a plan, Li Xuanxuan quickly departed.

Li Chenghui looked up at the sky. “The rainbow clouds have already covered more than half of Moongaze Lake. It’s impossible the Three Sects and Seven Gates don't know. The sect must have news by now as well. All we can do is wait for word.”
