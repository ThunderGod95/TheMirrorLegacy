# Chapter 1169: The Path of Radiant Fire

The spiritual peak of the Chunyi Dao Gate had once been Seajade Peak, a celestial mountain of rare beauty, its entire body like lustrous, brilliant jade. But when Daoist Master Yuanshang sought his breakthrough, he had shattered the peak, and with it, the paradisiacal landscape vanished.

Now, with the passage of time, the half that remained on the island had become a mere hill known as the Jade Terrace. The other half, submerged in the sea, revealed only a speck of white upon the surface like a small reef, wreathed in ethereal mist. The palaces and courts that once stood there now lay on the seabed, a ruin called the Broken Scepter.

As Li Jiangqian descended, riding a current of Radiant Fire, a figure emerged from the mists of the Jade Terrace, borne upon the wind. He was a man of refined and striking features, his robes embroidered with patterns of waves and crescent moons, a belt of subdued silver jade cinched at his waist. Catching sight of Li Jiangqian’s golden eyes, he spoke with caution.

"May I ask which fellow Daoist has graced us with their presence?"

Li Jiangqian smiled.

"Greetings, Senior. I am Changli of Ting Province. I have come with my elder to seek guidance on the Immortal Dao."

The young Daoist Master was momentarily taken aback, but then he saw a shaft of Heavenly Light descend. Li Ximing stepped forth from the Great Void, prompting the young man to quickly cup his hands in a formal salute.

"So, it is a guest from Ting Province!"

Li Ximing returned the gesture with a smile, his eyes brightening.

"It has been long since we parted at Chunyi. To see you again, your bearing has changed completely. Congratulations, my friend."

The man before them, Che Hong, had impressively become a cultivator of two divine abilities.

"Please, come inside!"

A clear look of pleasure was on Che Hong's face. With a polite smile, he led the two men in. He paused to dispatch a subordinate, murmuring a quiet instruction.

'Go to Dushan Island and invite Senior Ji'an. Tell him… his path to the Dao has arrived!'

The Chunyi disciple departed at once. The three of them landed upon the ethereal Jade Terrace. The pavilions were otherworldly, devoid of any mortal air, and disciples on either side bowed respectfully as they passed. The atmosphere was one of profound tranquility.

Li Ximing nodded to himself, understanding that the Chunyi Dao Gate was gradually emerging from the shadow of Daoist Master Yuanshang's fall. As they took their seats on a high platform, Che Hong spoke graciously.

"My sect and your esteemed clan share a certain destiny. Before I had accomplished my divine abilities, I even crossed hands with the master of the Thunder Pool… You, Daoist Master… you must be King Wei’s eldest son!"

Li Jiangqian smiled.

"I am."

Che Hong was not yet fully aware of the current political landscape; he had only made inquiries about the Radiant Fire of the great lake years ago. Having just emerged from seclusion, he recognized Li Jiangqian at a glance. After a few pleasantries, Li Ximing’s expression turned serious.

"We have come today because King Wei has been struck by a terrible calamity. We wish to trade for pill formulas and techniques to avert this disaster and cleanse his karma."

In an urgent tone, he briefly explained the sequence of events. Che Hong's expression shifted several times as he listened. He hesitated for a few moments before replying,

"The methods of the Supreme Yin are exceedingly precious and would normally require the personal approval of our Dao Gate’s master. However, your noble clan originates from the Ning-Li and was close to our ancestors, the Xi clan. Our Dao Lineages are also aligned, and this is a matter of great urgency… I shall not stand on ceremony."

He continued gravely,

"My Dao Lineage does possess secret arts for dispelling calamities for others. It is called the Wondrous Art of Night's Serene Dominion, and it is typically performed using the Supreme Yin divine abilities Bestowal of Profound Peal and the Woven Jade Radiance Chapter."

At the mention of these names, the two members of the Li family kept their composure, but their hearts skipped a beat. Che Hong, not noticing, glanced at their faces and said with some embarrassment,

"Unfortunately, our Dao Gate’s master cultivates three divine abilities, and he happens to lack these two…"

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"Since the goal is to dispel a calamity, can the Wondrous Art of Night's Serene Dominion be performed by the Hengzhu Dao?"

Che Hong nodded.

"Of course. There are even a few other specific lineages that can achieve it. The 'Immortal Without Flaw' of Wu Earth, the 'Peace Through Concealment' of Molten Fire, and even the Pristine Water lineage… they have a concoction called 'Purging Dew,' which would also be a perfect remedy. But none of the Daoist Masters of my lineage possess these divine abilities…"

Hearing this, Li Ximing mentally discarded the idea of using a technique. Hengzhu had sealed its gates. Even if he had the heaven-defying power to find Chi Buzi, how could he possibly convince the Chunyi Dao Gate to hand over their secret arts to that infamous green-eyed ghost? They would likely attack each other on sight.

Yet, a flicker of secret delight sparked within him. He adopted a troubled expression and sighed.

"It seems we can only seek a solution through pill formulas."

Claiming to be a Supreme Yin lineage yet being unable to use its arts to help others was clearly a source of embarrassment for Che Hong. He nodded quickly.

"That can be arranged. My sect possesses the 'Cold Night Woven Jade Pill Scripture,' which records many profound and wondrous methods for concocting Supreme Yin pills. Within it is a section on Calamity-Averting Pill Arts. I am certain it will satisfy you, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing's own progress in alchemy had hit a bottleneck. The very name of this scripture made his heart itch with curiosity; he wished he could borrow the entire volume. But he knew it must be one of their foundational texts and couldn't bring himself to ask.

"Then I must trouble you, my friend," he said instead.

Che Hong immediately sent someone to fetch the scripture. Before he could say more, a streak of fiery red Li-Light descended, leaping and flaring as it landed on the Jade Terrace. The light quickly receded, revealing an old man.

He appeared quite advanced in years, dressed in red robes. He was not tall, but with a stout build and a round face, he looked solid and sturdy. His expression was an odd mixture of joy and anxiety. He bowed to each of the three men.

"Greetings to the three of you."

Straightening up, he turned to Che Hong with a smile.

"Brother Xi Chang! Thank you for your trouble!"

Che Hong gave a strange nod, but Li Jiangqian narrowed his eyes. 'He's also a Radiant Fire cultivator at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, yet he addresses a junior like Che Hong as 'brother'!'

Li Jiangqian smiled.

"Greetings, old senior."

"I don't deserve the honor…" The old Daoist Master shook his head hastily.

"Your noble clan is of imperial descent, your status is revered. Please do not flatter me. My surname is Wu, and my Daoist name is Ji'an. I am but a minor cultivator from a Daoist tradition of Beyond the Profound. My tradition is not mainstream, and my bloodline holds no prestige… I could never accept such an honor!"

Li Ximing had met his share of rogue cultivators, but never one so direct. He accepted the humble address and asked,

"Old Daoist Master, you are here for…?"

Ji'an sighed.

"I was originally a cultivator from the Northern Sea, but I came to reside in the Eastern Sea due to the shifts in the world's Spiritual Qi. I heard long ago of your clan's great Dao of Radiant Fire… I wished to trade for it, but I dared not get involved in the affairs of the Three Profoundities, so I sought the help of the Chunyi Dao Gate…"

"Later," he continued, "a Grotto-Heaven named Parting River Heaven appeared in the Northern Sea. A few friends invited me to explore it, and I thought that I lacked anything of sufficient value to trade with your clan. So I went. I gained much, but I was also injured and had to find a place to hide and recuperate… I missed many important events…"

Seeing the man's demeanor, Li Ximing already had a guess. He smiled.

"The Great Scripture of Radiance?"

"Precisely!" Ji'an's smile was polite, his eyes filled with hope. "The orthodox nature of Radiant Fire, two life-mandates, two arts, one body. This old man has already mastered the Grasp of Ninefold Heaven, Burning Annihilation, and Concordant Conquest, each one learned through a trial of life and death. I am but one step away from attempting the Purple Mystery… My hopes rest on the Great Scripture of Radiance!"

Before either of the Li clansmen could respond, Ji'an produced an object from his sleeve. It was a crimson-gold Daoist hairpin, the length of a finger and the thickness of a chopstick, with a sharp tip radiating a potent, fiery baleful aura.

He first laid it in his palm for them to inspect, then held it between two fingers. With a light flick, it transformed on the spot into a long spear covered in Dao patterns. The weapon was one zhang and two chi long, with a nine-cun, four-edged, prism-shaped spearhead. Dark red Dao patterns covered its surface, and a roiling, baleful Li-Light pulsed within it like magma deep within the earth, its glow shifting between light and shadow.

Ji'an glanced over and caught the look of astonishment in Li Ximing’s eyes. He smiled.

"This is the Crimson Gold Hundred-Turn Spear!"

Li Jiangqian slowly turned his head, a faint smile playing on his lips.

"Old Daoist Master, you have certainly come prepared."

Seeing no reaction from him, Ji'an grew anxious and began to explain,

"This artifact came from Parting River Heaven. It is a relic of the ancient Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition. You must understand, the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion itself was a creation of the Encompassing Profoundity, which shows their mastery of Radiant Fire. This weapon has a long and storied history; it is by no means ordinary!"

Li Ximing said, "Do you mean to say this is a Spiritual Treasure?"

Ji'an paused, realizing the two before him were connoisseurs of fine things. He answered with some embarrassment,

"It doesn't quite reach that level. Parting River Heaven was sealed much later than Wanling Heaven… Although its quality is exceptionally high, it cannot be considered a creation from before the great celestial shift. It cannot compare to the Spiritual Treasures from the direct lineages of the Three Profoundities, let alone treasures like the Crystalline Jade Branch that serve as the foundation of an entire Dao lineage…"

Li Ximing observed the spear for a moment, making a quick assessment.

'Its quality is close to the Demonbane Cleaver Mace, but it is perfectly aligned with the Radiant Fire Dao, allowing its power to be fully unleashed. It should be at least on par with the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, though still inferior to the Huai River Map.'

The power of most Spiritual Artifacts was intrinsically tied to their compatibility with a cultivator's Dao-path. The Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger that Li Ximing had since set aside was barely a mid-grade Spiritual Artifact, and its mismatched lineage was a great pity. Even a weapon as powerful as the Demonbane Cleaver Mace was merely a handy tool for him, since he did not cultivate Profound Thunder.

'I should find an opportunity to trade it,' he thought.

While Li Ximing was lost in his thoughts, Li Jiangqian eyed the artifact and deliberately feigned disinterest.

"I have heard of a Grotto-Heaven that fell in the Northern Sea. So it was Parting River Heaven. What Dao lineage did it belong to? And why did it fall?"

Ji'an took a shallow breath, choosing his words carefully.

"I do not fully understand the intricacies myself. I only heard talk of the Heavenly Element and the Wanling Daoist tradition… In short, they used these legacies of the Encompassing Profoundity to open another of their Grotto-Heavens… But this time was different. There were many cultivators still inside. Some geniuses were selected and taken away, while others were resettled. As for the Daoist tradition—it was called the Profound Si Daoist tradition."

He quickly looked up, changing the subject and speaking with sincerity.

"I am willing to trade this weapon for the Great Scripture of Radiance and the Spiritual Qi to cultivate it. I hope your noble clan will help me complete my Dao!"

Li Jiangqian shook his head with a smile.

"Senior, perhaps you are unaware. This cultivation method of mine is of primordial origin, no ordinary art. It is powerful enough to serve as the ultimate treasure of an immortal sect. Once mastered, a single breath of heart-fire can rival the full might of the Purple Mansion Realm. It is beyond comparison with common techniques."

'No wonder his aura is so extraordinary!' Ji'an thought, his expression one of profound shock. His private speculation had just been confirmed. He looked up, not with alarm, but with delight.

"That is even better!"

He was decisive. Swallowing his reluctance, he said with a pained expression,

"Since Your Highness has brought up Radiant Fire, I happen to be nurturing a special flame at my mountain gate. I will fetch it for you!"

At this, Li Ximing’s heart began to pound with excitement. Li Jiangqian, however, wore an inscrutable look and sighed.

"I understand your sincerity, old master. But my clan is situated between the north and south. This technique is our foundation. If I were to share it carelessly, I fear it might one day be turned against me."

He saw the situation with perfect clarity. For Ji'an, going to Parting River Heaven was, on the surface, a quest for treasures to trade. In truth, he had almost certainly heard a rumor of finding the complete Dao lineage there. Having failed, he was now seeking the next best thing. That was why he hadn't approached the Li family sooner—if he had found the scripture in the Grotto-Heaven, he would have had no need of them.

But this meant one thing: the Dao lineage of the 'Great Scripture of Radiance' was so rare it couldn't even be found in a lost Grotto-Heaven.

'It is also known as the Art of Gazing Upon and Describing the Sun, after all,' Li Jiangqian mused. 'It carries a trace of the Supreme Yang.'

Logically, the value Ji'an offered was by no means low. But this was no fair trade. If the Li clan was willing to be ruthless, they held his entire future in their hands. This technique was a rare commodity that could be leveraged to make him do anything. Its true value was inestimable.

Ji'an understood this as well. At Li Jiangqian’s slight pause, a smile bloomed on the old man’s face.

"The Chunyi Dao Gate can vouch for me! I will never bring harm to Your Highness! And I swear never to pass this on to outsiders or bequeath it to my descendants!"

"And… and… I have heard that Daoist Master Zhaojing possesses a formidable Li-Light art, and that King Wei has an induction art that is also of the orthodox Radiant Fire nature. My own Dao lineage is incomplete, and I would be very interested in trading for those as well… If you are willing to part with the major and minor techniques and their legacies, this old man will not be stingy."

At these words, Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow, a smile touching his eyes.

'A clever response. It preserves some dignity.'

Did Ji'an truly want more techniques? He was already ancient and about to attempt his fourth divine ability upon reaching the Purple Mystery. He had long since mastered all the arts he needed; it was too late to learn new ones. And since he wouldn't pass them on, what was the point? It was simply a way to sweeten the deal, to put more on the table—useful or not—so the Li clan wouldn't look so greedy, and he wouldn't look so desperate. It allowed both sides to save face.

Although the old Daoist Master’s attitude was deferential, he had survived as a rogue cultivator for centuries and possessed an orthodox Radiant Fire. His skills were undoubtedly profound. The Li family could not afford to make an enemy of him. Li Jiangqian feigned hesitation, sighing and shaking his head. Taking the cue, Li Ximing gritted his teeth and said,

"Very well… so long as you can produce something of equal value, I will agree to the exchange!"

Ji'an's eyes lit up. He felt no sense of loss at all.

"Spoken like a true imperial descendant! This grace of completing my Dao… I shall never forget it for as long as I live!"

He hastily retrieved a box from his sleeve and opened it with great care. Nestled within the ornate jade box was a small, red apricot, the size of a fingernail. It seemed to pulse like a tiny, dancing flame, delicate and alluring, and was surrounded by faint, multicolored halos of light.

The moment it appeared, a profound shift occurred within Li Jiangqian. The Talisman Qi in his body reacted, and a subtle yet deep hunger washed over him, lingering in his mind. The life-mandate induction fire in his core flared and pulsed, threatening to surge forth at any moment.

'What a magnificent spiritual treasure!'

This visceral hunger caused his expression to waver. Ji'an, however, looked on with an expression of deep, heart-wrenching pain.

"This is called a Radiant Si Apricot Fruit. I suffered grievous injuries in the Grotto-Heaven just to obtain it!"

"A Profound Si Treasure Apricot tree grew in that Grotto-Heaven," he explained. "It was like a living font of Radiant Fire, and its heat warped the very fabric of the Grotto-Heaven. Of the fruits upon it… the large ones were ancient, while the smaller ones were newly grown. There were three large, eighteen medium, and thirty-six small in total. The largest one was the size of a man’s fist!"

Li Jiangqian’s eyes fixed on him.

"Who took it?"

Ji'an sighed in resignation.

"People from the Feather-Shedding Land arrived. A great personage took the Profound Si Treasure Apricot tree itself. But before leaving, as a gesture of fairness, a highness from beneath the Tree of One Heart shook the tree three times. Nine fruits the width of two fingers fell, along with twenty-two that were finger-sized. The slaughter that ensued… it blotted out the sun and made rivers of blood flow."

"My abilities are limited. I was close enough to seize the initial advantage and snatched three of the small ones, but I was forced to give one up while being pursued. I escaped with two. Fearing I would be ambushed on my way back to the Eastern Sea, I found a place to enter seclusion."

He let out another long, quiet sigh.

"My breakthrough to the Purple Mystery depends on this one spiritual apricot. I offer one today, first as payment for completing my Dao lineage, and second…"

At this point, he rose from his seat and bowed low, startling Li Ximing, who quickly moved to avoid the gesture. The old man spoke with sincere humility.

"Radiant Fire is ill-suited for alchemy. I must ask Daoist Master Zhaojing to refine this fruit into a pill for me!"
