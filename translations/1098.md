# Chapter 1098: A Change in the Arrowhead

'Crimson Severing Arrowhead.'

Thunder rolled across the heavens and the earth. A blood-red radiance unfurled like a magnificent scroll painting, rippling outward from Vast Cicada. It revealed a vision of a blood-stained desert, of scattered armor and chaotic banners. The air, filled with the ceaseless din of roars and battle cries, forced every spectator to turn, their gazes frozen.

Above the Baixiang Valley, where divine abilities clashed and intertwined, a vast new domain had manifested. It hung in mid-air like a Grotto-heaven, or perhaps a Desert Sky-Platform floating upon the clouds. Torrents of yellow sand, awash in the same blood-red light, poured from its edges, eclipsing all other colors in the sky. All that remained for the land below was a thick, bottomless darkness.

And upon that desert, a man with golden eyes and black robes stood, his expression glacial as he slowly drew a long halberd.

A name echoed in everyone's mind simultaneously:

'Li Zhouwei…'

'Mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm!'

Above Baixiang Valley, the thousands of eyes belonging to the Maha floated, observing in secret. The Jade True sword cultivator glanced over. Disbelief flooded Tinglan’s pale face, followed by a sudden flush of color.

'Crimson Severing Arrowhead… He wasn't healing… He was breaking through…'

But while the other Daoist Masters saw the divine ability as a distant Desert Sky-Platform, Vast Cicada, who was trapped within it, felt as though he had been plunged into a boundless Grotto-heaven. The figures of the other cultivators had vanished from the sky, replaced by an oppressive darkness so thick he couldn't see his hand in front of his face, and a colossal setting sun that consumed the horizon.

The sun prostrated itself upon the desert. Its immense head rapidly dispersed under the light, and countless streams of splendor cascaded down like a waterfall, revealing the human form of the monk.

'Crimson Severing Arrowhead.'

Vast Cicada was, of course, familiar with this divine ability—Li Jieyi had also been a Bright Yang cultivator at the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm. But... this was the divine ability he had sought and failed to obtain. Only after throwing his lot in with the Buddhists and gaining mastery over the Precious Tusk Golden Land had he finally grasped a fraction of its power.

A complex emotion flickered in Vast Cicada's eyes, but he suppressed it in an instant.

'The Radiant Sun King's Halberd… For such a clumsy weapon to fall from the sky and still strike me… White Cicada is wounded, and my connection to Precious Tusk is unstable…'

The monk's forehead was smooth, his features handsome. His golden-patterned kasaya snapped in the wind, revealing the brown robes fluttering beneath. A trickle of golden blood seeped from the corner of his lips, but he paid it no mind, his gaze locked on the figure suspended within the desert domain.

'Li Zhouwei.'

Li Zhouwei's Radiant Sun King's Halberd hadn't struck Vast Cicada's true body. It had struck something far more vital: his foundation, White Cicada. The blow had shaken his very connection to Precious Tusk. The monk, however, dared not show any sign of distress in front of his enemy. He suppressed the injury. The golden blood lingered at his lips for a moment before vanishing.

"So, you are Li Zhouwei!"

His only answer was the brilliant flash of a golden halberd-edge illuminating the world.

Vast Cicada solemnly raised his head. With a grasping motion of one hand, a glittering spear of Li Fire materialized in his palm. His eyes brightened, and as he raised the spear, a tide of killing intent surged forth.

'I, Li Jieyi... am not like Mingxiang, a Daoist monk who only knows spell arts!'

The Li Fire spear, coalescing from crimson flames, shot forward to parry. This was the same treasured spear that had once nearly shattered the divine ability of the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron. Yet, in the blood-red radiance of this domain, its own light seemed to dim. The aura of Grand Ascension erupted from Li Zhouwei, and the force alone caused the monk's form to sink, forcing him back a step.

In that instant, a second beam of light leaped from the halberd, scything horizontally toward his neck.

Vast Cicada's gaze hardened. He opened his crimson lips and, with a metallic clang, bit down on the attacking light. His pearly white teeth flashed as he commanded:

"Go!"

A violent gale, laced with sand and blood, spat from his mouth. It was a stark, crimson torrent that blasted the pale golden afterimage, transforming it into a coiling, venomous serpent that lunged for Li Zhouwei's face.

But at that precise moment, the Li Fire spear in Vast Cicada's hand suddenly felt lighter. The blood-red light vanished from his vision, replaced by a single, deep-red point.

An ordinary cultivator might not have understood, but Vast Cicada, with his foundation in Bright Yang, knew exactly what this was.

'The Light of Karmic Dissolution and Pure Yin!'

This light appeared only when the Bright Yang position shifted, or when an Emperor or Crown Prince engaged in self-reflection. Within a divine ability, it flared at the moment Crimson Severing Arrowhead dissipated, allowing one to shift the primary position, execute a 'Sovereign's Misdirection,' and disrupt the enemy's mind.

'This light… It should only appear when Crimson Severing Arrowhead has been cultivated to true perfection! He must be supremely favored by Bright Yang, born to wield this!'

Just as he thought, the crimson serpent struck empty air. The scenery of Baixiang Valley reappeared. Li Zhouwei's figure had materialized _behind_ him. One hand gripped the halberd’s end, the other pressed against its shaft as he drove the weapon forward in a devastating mid-air thrust.

Fortunately, Vast Cicada was prepared. His face rotated grotesquely to the back of his head. His two mouths gaped wide, revealing the form of White Cicada once more.

"Roar—"

A colossal roar shook the heavens. The Li Zhouwei in front of him instantly disintegrated into countless wisps of yin qi, scattering like smoke.

It was an illusion, a phantom created by the divine ability.

'Sovereign's Misdirection…'

In the end, Li Jieyi had never managed to master Crimson Severing Arrowhead. Even with his immortal foundation and expertise in this path, he had miscalculated. He had missed this one crucial technique.

Li Zhouwei himself had used the dissipation of his divine ability to teleport to its very edge. The Grand Ascension swept across the sky, aimed directly at Touba Ci's back.

The reason was simple: Tinglan, besieged by three opponents, had only managed to parry a few blows and was already in dire straits.

In a flash, Touba Ci's expression changed. The light of Profound Yellow Qi at his brow flared as he spun, halberd in hand. Simultaneously, a massive seal descended from above, slamming down toward the Grand Ascension.

Touba Ci was of the Touba family, a nephew of the current King of Dai, and a proud man by nature. But he had clashed with Li Zhouwei in Wanling Heaven; he knew what this King Wei was capable of. Now, seeing his opponent's divine ability so greatly enhanced, he didn't dare show the slightest negligence. He instantly abandoned his assault on Tinglan to face this new threat with his full power.

Li Zhouwei had broken Tinglan's siege, but Vast Cicada had been left behind. The monk's reaction was lightning-fast. Instead of moving to reinforce his ally, he immediately shifted his gaze, searching for Jiangxia and the others.

Li Zhouwei could escape, but how could Jiangxia's group? Without Li Zhouwei's protection, it would take Vast Cicada only ten breaths to re-establish his sense of Precious Tusk and claim one of them.

But as he looked up, he was greeted by a brilliant Celestial Gate descending from the sky, flanked by soaring, colorful phoenixes and arrays of golden-armored guards. Seated upon the gate was a man in resplendent white-gold Daoist robes.

How could Vast Cicada not recognize him?

'Li Ximing!'

'He's not at Moongaze Lake… No… He was waiting for us to head north. He received word and crossed the river to follow. This was Yang Ruiyi's plan all along!'

This realization made Vast Cicada laugh, his heart a turmoil of shock and manic delight.

"Instead of cowering at the lake, you actually dare to follow me this deep? There are no restraints on my power here!"

He grit his teeth. As he raised his head, a blinding radiance erupted from his brow. His mouth gaped, and the half-broken form of White Cicada within beat its wings, threatening to burst forth on the wind. The very sky darkened as the spiritual qi churned.

But the Daoist Master on the Celestial Gate remained perfectly composed. He merely turned to the side as another figure stepped forth from the Great Void.

This man's features were unremarkable. He wore the simple purple-and-black robes of the Holder of the Profound, and motes of water and fire flickered at his side. But what drew every eye was the hand he held out flat.

Resting in his palm was a small, three-legged cauldron.

It looked as if it were carved from black jade, its surface impossibly smooth. It had two high, ornamental ears and was covered in dense, intricate patterns from which dark golden lines seemed to flow. A roiling black light shone from within its boiling contents.

The former state-founding ritual vessel of Yang-Yue, the supreme treasure of the modern Yang-Song: the Guzhou Cauldron.

The appearance of this treasured cauldron made Vast Cicada's expression fall. He not only aborted the Dharma Art he was casting but took a full step back, his gaze turning cold as ice as he stared at the black-robed man holding the cauldron.

A single Guzhou Cauldron had made him hesitate.

'That cauldron was birthed from Exiled Qi; it severs all spiritual connection. My Precious Tusk is already unstable from blocking that halberd strike. How can I risk exposing it to Exiled Qi now?'

If, back at the lake, Vast Cicada had been weighing the value of sacrificing Precious Tusk for a karmic opportunity, the presence of the Guzhou Cauldron eliminated all consideration.

The cauldron's appearance didn't just startle Vast Cicada. Far in the distance, the Maha's myriad eyes quivered, their collective gaze sweeping over to lock onto the newcomer.

'To be entrusted with carrying the cauldron, he must be an imperial descendant of the Yang clan… Ruizao. It must be him.'

'But that's not right!'f

As the Liangli of the Way of Emptiness, Zhelu's thoughts ran far deeper.

'Back when Yang Ruiyi plotted against Jiang Toushou, someone held Mingxiang back inside the nether carriage, allowing that pack of fools to fall into the trap. The Maha later guessed it was Ruizao… that he had secretly become Holder of the Profound and taken part…'

But if that was true, what was this? If Tinglan had left, Yang Ruiyi must be guarding Shanji. If Ruizao was here, then who was causing the Exiled Qi disturbance at Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain?

_Boom!_

As Zhelu pondered, the vortex of Jade True light before him intensified, jolting him back to reality. The desert domain in the distance had retracted. The black-robed man stepped out of the void, and a deafening hum filled the sky.

Vast Cicada was pinned by Li Ximing and the Guzhou Cauldron. Tinglan had already regained her footing.

Li Zhouwei's expression was placid. His golden eyes stared intently at Touba Ci. The light at his brow flared, then swiftly transformed into the sigil of a solar eclipse. With it rose an oppressive, suffocating darkness that saturated the sky.

The divine ability Crimson Severing Arrowhead expanded at a terrifying speed, enveloping not only Touba Ci, but also Tinglan in her purple qi pavilion, Fangjing wreathed in True Fire, and Changyun, who manipulated golden qi. All four were now trapped within the desert domain.

The profound darkness reflected in the Daoist Masters' eyes. Touba Ci’s expression tensed, a burning battle-lust igniting in his gaze. Changyun simply smiled. Only Fangjing stood frozen, silent and tense.

The young genius from the Bolie region tightened his grip on his horse-lance and took a deep, shuddering breath.

Li Zhouwei, meanwhile, had taken the full blast of Touba's Profound Yellow Qi. He flicked his halberd, deflecting the treasure seal that descended from the sky. The webbing of his thumb trembled, slick with blood, but his face was a mask of pure exhilaration. His eyes shone, and giving his opponents no time to recover, the sigil on his brow solidified.

'Emperor Qi's Light.'

The eclipse mark became a vortex of absolute darkness, reflecting no light at all. Instead, the colossal setting sun at the desert's edge began to tremble. Then, it shattered, exploding into an overwhelming storm of black-gold radiance.

The desert was deep, the blood-light silent. A rain of black-gold fire filled the sky.

_Boom!_

Even with their profound backgrounds, the three Daoist Masters were forced to retreat, each summoning a Spiritual Artifact to defend themselves. Amidst the endless storm of black-gold light, a single white gleam flashed. The pale golden barrier in front of Touba Ci shattered. His pupils dilated. He thrust his halberd up, parrying an object in the gloom.

A sharp, golden halberd blade.

It stopped one inch from his eye.

Only then did the mournful wail of the jade-pearl Spiritual Artifact he had used to block the storm finally reach his ears. His hand on the Grand Ascension was steady as a rock, but he had been forced back a step.

Touba Ci, with his high-bridged nose and deep-set eyes, was a handsome man. As a dignified imperial scion of Great Liang and a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm expert, he would not swallow such an insult. Surging Profound Yellow Qi climbed his robes. An amber-colored light flowed from his eyes as his features seemed to sharpen. He let out an ecstatic breath and murmured:

"I have come to see 'Bright Yang'!"

Profound Qi divine ability: Substituted Hindrance.

In an instant, a dark, bestial cloud of white mist rose from within the rolling Profound Yellow Qi. A white pearl leaped from his brow, erupting in a blinding white light that descended in waves, like a shower of blades.

It was the light of Veiled Yin.

The radiance fell like fluttering feathers, striking the blood-red illusion of the domain, causing its light to warp and waver. Li Zhouwei was undeterred. He lunged, taking another step forward, and commanded:

"Strike!"

As the word fell, the terrifying sunset reappeared on the horizon. It pulsed. The shower of Veiled Yin light had almost reached him when the command struck it. The light exploded into a swarm of ethereal insects and snakes, which dissolved into a cloud of white smoke under the glare of Bright Yang.

Crimson Severing Arrowhead, as the yin-aspect of Bright Yang, possessed properties antithetical to its source. It granted Li Zhouwei unpredictable movement and shored up his weaknesses, but it also gave him a potent weapon against Veiled Yin.

It was Yang Cusp Inversion.

Li Zhouwei had once used Emperor Qi's Light—a technique of Yang Cusp Inversion—against Zong Chang with tremendous success. Crimson Severing Arrowhead was a critical component of this inversion. With it, his Bright Yang power was not just a match for Veiled Yin; it held the superior position, capable of shattering yin-aligned evils.

'If Zong Chang herself were here, she would hesitate to challenge me with Veiled Yin. Only Wei Xuanyin could use a Veiled Yin divine ability to crack my Crimson Severing Arrowhead. But you, Touba Ci... how much could you possibly understand? I just wonder where that Veiled Yin power came from… It doesn't feel like a Spiritual Artifact.'

His halberd continued its unobstructed path. Touba Ci frowned. With a flick of his sleeve, just as Zong Chang had done, he "fell" into the darkness and reappeared in a different location, his gaze snapping upward.

The treasure seal was already descending.

This seal, modeled after a Dharma Treasure, was the signature technique of the Touba clan. It was something to be feared. Though clumsy, its power was immense. Even Li Zhouwei had to dodge, conceding the move.

But as he fell back, Touba Ci seized the opening. His eyes, now completely overflowing with an amber-brown light, gleamed. He laughed.

"Great Pass Azure-Soul Dharma Body!"

The world trembled. Under the light of the setting sun, a colossal figure rose from the desert floor.

It was as large as a mountain, with a human torso, a sharp, curved golden horn, and earlobes so long they rested on its shoulders. Its face was a mask of majesty. Its eyes were round as jewels, filled with concentric black-and-white rings that scanned its surroundings.

Six grey-copper arms extended from the demon's back, each ending in green-tinted claws. The six hands merged into one and, like Mount Tai itself, slammed down.

_Boom!_

The darkness in the domain flickered. The desert winds howled. The six-layered hands froze in mid-air, and the copper-green demon actually staggered.

An endless torrent of dark flames surged upward.

Another figure, just as large as a mountain, with six arms that blotted out the sky, had risen. But this one's face was as majestic and terrible as a Flood Dragon's, with a sharp jaw and rows of fine, serrated teeth. A dark-golden Bright Yang light dripped from its maw, drifting in the light of the blood-red sun.

Before their very eyes, from the east, from _within_ those six-layered hands, a new demon had clawed its way into existence.

The Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body.
