# Chapter 1011: The White Qilin

Within the secret formation, shifting colors pulsed and overlapped. A hazy purple light filled the Celestial Hall, making the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda shine with extraordinary brilliance. Li Ximing listened intently until the words ended, then fell silent.

"The new dynasty has granted the rank of king to all the Immortal Clans, but these are empty titles. Only our family holds both the name and the substance. It is settled—you must ascend to the Bright Yang throne."

The young man with golden eyes stood with his hands clasped behind his back, pacing the hall. His thoughts were inscrutable. After a long wait, Li Ximing’s somber voice broke the silence.

"The Underworld also wants you to seek this path... Is there any room for refusal?"

Li Zhouwei looked at him, his expression as cold as ice. "Attaining it is now inevitable," he said softly.

Li Ximing nodded, a flicker of agitation crossing his face. He paced a few steps, his brow furrowed, before replying.

"I don't care what kind of figure Li Qianyuan was! Even if I know nothing of ancient history, our dao lineage is here now, and that should give us some right to speak! You're to seek the Bright Yang... Fine... They want you to seek it, so they grant you a kingdom... a kingdom of a single lake! In ancient times, that wouldn't even be considered a large fiefdom!"

Li Ximing was usually a calm man. Even when pursued and gravely injured years ago, he had only managed a wry smile before finding a place to heal. He never spoke of it. But after holding it in for so long, now in a place of safety, he could no longer contain his frustration. He seemed almost feral as he spoke through gritted teeth, "The Wei Emperor... That was the Wei Emperor, a figure who ranked among the top True Monarchs, an Imperial Monarch! In terms of national fortune, his was the number one celestial dynasty of the north. In Dao-Profundity, he was a man approaching the Dao Embryo. And in status, he shattered kingdoms and destroyed sects, setting the principles for the mortal realm that kept the Bright Yang's gaze fixed for a thousand years..."

"If you were given a celestial dynasty, half the world, then I'd have faith you might succeed! But now... a kingdom of a lake is one thing, but they also demand you declare yourself a subject! They want a son to replace the father—what a joke! They demand you bow to True Qi, so what right would you have to look up to Li Qianyuan? How is that any different from sending you to your death?"

"From the very beginning! From the very beginning, they have never given you a path to survival!"

The Daoist had clearly lost his composure. "I understand, of course," he seethed, "that you achieving Bright Yang is our best option. But why have we been desperately seeking an escape route? Because it's utterly impossible... Luoxia is confident, the whole world is confident..."

"And now this. Not a single escape route left. Since you've decided to strive for Bright Yang, how will you deal with the Dragon-kin?! Are the Dragon-kin to be trifled with? The Qunyi Archipelago is in the Eastern Sea!"

His divine ability flared with his rage, and every lamp in the Celestial Hall went dark. The purple glow from outside dimmed, and all light vanished. In the darkness, only a pair of golden eyes faintly gleamed. The pupils had transformed into golden-white rings, staring at the floor, their usual tranquility replaced by a deep, ruthless venom.

"Grand-uncle, do not dwell on it."

His voice, however, was unnervingly calm, a distorted tone echoing in the air.

"They want me to seek Fruition Attainment, so they must guide me step-by-step toward the perfection of my divine ability. Let them see our family's grievance for now. I am a pawn, yes, but once I achieve the Great Accomplishment of Bright Yang, the meaning of this pawn will be entirely different."

Li Ximing started to speak, then stopped. The light in the Celestial Hall flickered, bright one moment and dim the next. The White Qilin continued as if talking to himself.

"I will endure for another decade or two. Once my divine ability is perfected, I will have my own ways of influencing the situation. But for now, I must gather my strength. I cannot be injured, my cultivation cannot stagnate. I must shatter mountains and raze temples, slaughter Buddhists and butcher demons. Only by bowing to True Qi first will I have the backing to nourish my Talisman Qi with a sea of blood and the chance to accumulate power..."

"When I achieve the Great Accomplishment of Bright Yang, even if I lash out and take a bite or two out of him, he will have to endure it unless he sends a True Monarch after me... Even if I am to die seeking the Bright Yang, I will make him feel the pain of my fangs before I fall..."

"Besides..."

For the first time, he revealed his innermost thoughts. His eyes, now like golden-white rings, turned to Li Ximing, sending a chill down his spine.

"Submitting today does not mean I will submit forever. The ropes from the heavens are not unbreakable. If one day I turn on him, shatter his five fingers, and ruin this grand game, even the Bright Yang will have no choice but to look at me in a new light."

The words were like a bucket of cold water, extinguishing the flames of anger in the Daoist's heart. He was stunned, seemingly at a loss.

'Then... what will be the price?'

In truth, Li Ximing had regretted his words the moment they left his mouth. Seeing the distant, unguarded look in his junior's eyes, the unease in his heart grew heavier.

Li Zhouwei had shown little emotion since childhood. In contrast, Li Jiangqian's darkness and venom were easier to read on the surface. But when all the light had faded, that unintentional glance was like a handful of needles piercing Li Ximing's eyes. It suddenly reminded him of something.

Years ago, in the Wilderness with Tianwan, Li Zhouwei had worn that same expression. The words still echoed in his ears:

'To die for me, is that not as it should be?'

His lapse in attention caused the eyes to immediately retract their emotion. The White Qilin ascended the steps, one by one, his voice low. "As for today's matter... I have pondered it for a long time."

"The way of True Qi is righteous and restrains promiscuity; its benevolence and might are boundless. But what if there is a Daoist Tradition, an orthodox immortal cultivation lineage with a path of righteous Upper Rite, whose master has vanished and secretly sided with the north? If it fails to restrain promiscuity and its violence is not benevolent, would that not be a predicament?"

"This place is barely a hundred miles from where that lord began his rise. It is precisely because of this predicament that when he swept through the Yue State, he conveniently missed this one spot. It is a situation that requires a change."

The royal battle-axe hanging inverted at his waist shimmered. "That lord is currently stabilizing the situation, restraining promiscuity, and pursuing the Way of Great Desire, abolishing profane shrines from one land to the next as he presses north. The Way of Great Desire will suffer losses, but the lord's hands will also be tied... Perhaps I should help him."

"And avenge our flight east across the sea."

Li Ximing's eyebrows shot up. He looked at him in disbelief as the White Qilin continued, "Daoist Master Qinghu came to our gate with purpose. We might as well ask him if Helin Prefecture, the mountains of Changxiao, are to his liking."

A small, ironic smile touched his lips. "But... Grand-uncle, why don't you guess whether Daoist Master Qinghu has gone far? Or might he be waiting nearby in the Great Void?"

The pieces clicked into place for the Daoist. He stood up, listening to the young man's somber words. "Our family has no other path... Grand-uncle... our hands cannot remain clean. If we lack the will to control the grand tide of events, we can only be dominated by it..."

Those golden-white, ring-like eyes still gleamed. The White Qilin smiled faintly, revealing sharp, fine teeth.

"You also know... when the great lord made the Bright Yang turn its gaze upon me, it was not so a White Qilin could have a pointless reincarnation."

---

The stone chamber was thick with spiritual energy. The faint white glow from a lampstand spilled onto the meditation couch, illuminating an overturned, empty jade vial beside it. The youth exhaled a soft white breath and his eyes snapped open.

A dharma power completely different from his previous life flowed through his body. He raised an eyebrow, savoring the sensation.

The Great Void Revolution Art had achieved the Divine Sequence. It was clearly of the Heaven–Governing dao lineage, possessing the same domineering aura of 'I am the Heavenly Law' as Encompassing Profoundity. Although his immortal foundation was not yet established and its effects were subtle, the means were already there.

'The Great Void Revolution Art forms a 'void core' in my sea of qi. With daily nourishment, it can supplement my dharma power in battle... A pity I haven't reached the Foundation Establishment Realm yet; its wonders are limited...'

Li Suining gently raised his hand. A pale silver glow of dharma power bloomed in his palm and then subsided as he waved his arm. From his sleeve, he produced twelve formation flags, purple with star-like specks!

The twelve Long-Radiance Star-Shroud Flags converged and scattered in the air, their colors shifting as they descended. At one moment they took the form of rain clouds, unleashing thunder; the next, they became iron chains stretching across the sky, sealing off spiritual energy.

The flags shifted through thirty-two different formations, each one overlapping the last before returning to his sleeve. After running through the formations most familiar from his past life, Li Suining's eyes shone with understanding.

'My previous life was also of the Heaven–Governing lineage, which has a natural affinity for thunder. But compared to the Profound Dipper's Balance, this life's Divine Sequence is clearly much closer to the way of Profound Thunder!'

'However, in terms of sealing teleportation and drawing upon the Great Void for transformations, it's more versatile. I fear it might conflict with the path of Cultivation Transcendence...'

As a formations master, his sensitivity to the nuances of dao lineages was the highest among all crafters. Coupled with his high Dao-Profundity in the Heaven–Governing path and Daoist Master Yuanbian's Sutra of Profound Iteration, this perception was not difficult for him.

All of this was within his expectations. What truly surprised and delighted Li Suining was something else.

'In terms of dharma power quality, this Great Void Revolution Art... is in no way inferior to the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court from my past life! And it's far superior to the Art of the Golden Tablet that I practiced before I switched cultivation paths!'

An ordinary Qi Refining cultivator would never have noticed this. But having practiced both techniques across two lifetimes, his understanding was profound. He lowered his head, lost in thought, a deep joy welling within him.

"Even though the Great Void Revolution Art has no clear path forward, its quality is exceptional..."

This was undoubtedly excellent news. He no longer held any hope of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, but the more brilliantly he performed during the Foundation Establishment Realm, the more he would be valued. The stronger he was, the more he could change!

Beaming, he scanned his cavern-residence, gathered his belongings, and swept open the stone door with a flick of his sleeve. He strode out into the blinding sunlight, his mind already racing.

'The Way of Great Desire came down from the Wilderness... I wonder if the Daoist Master was injured, and how he is now... Injuries at the Purple Mansion Realm level are always kept secret. I can't ask, and I wouldn't find out even if I did...'

He looked up and saw a white-haired old man sitting cross-legged, guarding the entrance to his residence. It was Du Dou, a servant sent by the family.

Seeing Li Suining, Du Dou was overjoyed and rose to congratulate him. The youth smiled and stopped him, in no mood for celebration, and eagerly asked about family matters.

"How long was I in seclusion?"

Du Dou bowed hastily. "Reporting to Young Master, only six months."

Li Suining's thoughts stirred.

He was, after all, a cultivator of two lifetimes. The process was familiar and came naturally. Taking the pills, perfecting six cycles of Embyronic Breathing, and adjusting his qi had not taken much time. He breathed a sigh of relief.

'It's still early. Perhaps the Song Emperor has only just reached the Wilderness... and the karma-fire hasn't caused too many deaths yet... But the signs are all there. The great chaos is about to begin...'

The founding of the Great Song dynasty and the sweeping of the Yue lands involved more than just a few divine ability duels. It was just that the losses weren't catastrophic, so it didn't draw much attention. He had been in seclusion in his past life and didn't know much about it. Thinking back now, he mused:

'One battle subdued all four corners. Crimson Reef Island and Changxiao Gate were both battered. On the northern front our family was defending, Changxiao Gate's mainland territory was even breached by the Chen family. After all... they needed to offer a token of allegiance, and the enmity between the Chen family and Changxiao ran so deep...'

He narrowed his eyes, his heart sinking. 'And then there's Daoist Master Hansui. The master of Changxiao stationed him in Zhulu for many years. The mainland was just a burden, and in the end, it only added fuel to the fire...'

Lost in thought, Li Suining descended from the tower. As he reached the bottom of a pavilion and was about to go up, he suddenly raised his head and looked closely, noticing the master of the house was not present. Only then did he ask, 

"Strange... is the old master on the island?"

"This subordinate does not know..."

Du Dou's status was low; such information was indeed beyond him. Li Suining instructed, "Old Du, my breakthrough is complete. I should report to the old master. Go and ask around for me, find out when he is available, so I may pay my respects!"

Du Dou hurried off. Having sent him away, Li Suining made his way through the island, soon arriving at a quiet and peaceful place. The grass was fragrant and lush, a waterfall thundered nearby, and the sound of a sword's hum could be heard. As Li Suining walked deeper, he felt a sharp aura wash over him. Fearing he might be hurt by it, he called out urgently, "Youngest Uncle! Suining is here!"

Instantly, a great clanging sound erupted. The sword qi that had been weaving like moonlight above the waterfall plummeted, converging like a downpour toward the center of the lake. It materialized into a dharma sword shimmering with lunar brilliance and landed in the hand of a white-robed youth.

"Clang!"

The longsword slid into its sheath. Li Jiangchun raised his eyebrows in mild surprise, then smiled at him. "Congratulations, Suining!"

Li Suining took a step back and bowed. "Excellent swordsmanship, Youngest Uncle!" he said with a smile.

The white-robed man descended on the wind, landing before him. He shook his head and laughed. "Come..."

The two were taking their seats at a stone table by the lake when Li Jiangchun suddenly looked up at the sky. Beams of escaping light flashed one after another. He frowned. "Strange... why is there so much movement today..."

How could Li Suining not be sensitive to this? He raised his eyes, and his heart skipped a beat. A Heart-Piercing chill washed over him. He was about to stand when a sheet of apricot-red flame descended from the sky, landing abruptly by the lake's edge with a searing glow!

As the flame touched the ground, a wave of intense heat blasted them, forcing Li Suining to shield his eyes. He saw the Li Fire coalesce and manifest, transforming into a young man in crimson robes.

The man was handsome and slender. His eyes were filled with a grave, cold aura. Those golden eyes were piercingly bright. Merely by standing there, his peak Foundation Establishment Realm aura settled the entire lake, and the oppressive might of Li Fire spread out.

Li Suining stared, bewildered and stunned. 'Daoist Master Changli?'

He realized in an instant—the Li Jiangqian before him was still at the Foundation Establishment Realm!

'Something's happened!'

As expected, Li Jiangchun immediately grasped the gravity of the situation. He stood up, questioning, "Brother?!"

A flicker of agitation and doubt flashed in Li Jiangqian's eyes. He glanced at the two of them and said in a low voice, "No more talk. Follow me into the inner formation immediately!"

Li Jiangchun didn't hesitate. He immediately took Li Suining and flew up on the wind. The three of them stood upon the Li Fire and shot away in an instant. The golden-eyed man's lips curled into a slight smile as he spoke in a low voice, "Today, Father is leading men south from the lake to take revenge on Changxiao. The Daoist Master remains on the island and has ordered a travel ban, with all direct descendants to enter the formation."

His gaze turned venomous, his tone thick with killing intent. "Changxiao Gate acted in secret, forcing away the Daoist Master, forcing our grand-uncle to his death, and forcing Father to draw his sword to protect himself. Today... we will avenge the pursuit and slaughter on the river."

The overwhelming news exploded in his ears. Li Suining lowered his head, a vague suspicion in his mind instantly confirmed. A chill settled deep within him. 

'This is bad... this is very bad... It's just as I feared!'

'Indeed, influencing a battle at the Purple Mansion Realm level was bound to cause problems... It's happened sooner... The Daoist Master's escape from the West Sea has hastened the fall of Changxiao... Not only has it been hastened... but... it's our family making the move! It's actually our family making the move!!'
