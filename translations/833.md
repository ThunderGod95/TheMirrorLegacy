# Chapter 833: Omen

# Moongaze Lake

As the days passed, the situation in Jiangbei grew increasingly tense. Though the lake’s surface remained placid, its upper echelons were a hive of frantic activity. The flow of people in and out of the great hall swelled, particularly Qu Bushi, who, having been thrust into a position of great responsibility, was so busy he barely had a moment’s rest.

Li Jiangqian had already dispatched his men and was waiting in the great hall. After a long while, he finally saw Wang Quwan enter from outside. A blue and gold sword hung at the man’s waist. He carried himself with a steady gravity, his posture as firm as a pine, inspiring respect in all who saw him.

Li Jiangqian glanced at him and asked warmly, "How are your injuries? Have you had Elder Sun take a look?"

Wang Quwan cupped his hands in a fist. "Patriarch, I have been recuperating according to Elder Sun's instructions. He examined me again these past few days, which is why I have only just left my cave-dwelling."

The wounds he had sustained in Jiangbei were not severe, and after this period of recovery, he was almost fully healed. Li Jiangqian nodded. "And what of Daoist Shouding from Mount Jingyi? Is there any news?"

At the mention of this, Wang Quwan looked extremely embarrassed. When Daoist Shouding had returned with him, he had been terrified of being ambushed and dared not go back to Mount Jingyi. Instead, he had darted into a Li family cave-dwelling and immediately entered seclusion, refusing to leave or even show his face.

The Li family certainly didn't lack a spare cave, but Wang Quwan understood the sensitivities of the situation. The two families were not on the best of terms, and he himself was living under their roof; he knew he had to be cautious in all things. As the one who had brought Shouding here, he felt both anxious and mortified that his guest was overstaying his welcome.

"This subordinate has inquired several times," he replied. "I even borrowed his seal to write letters to Mount Jingyi. At first, there were some replies discussing who they might send to escort him back. But a few months ago, the contact suddenly ceased. Every letter I've sent since has vanished without a trace…"

"I have troubled the clan," he continued, "and my heart is ill at ease. I am willing to lease this cave-dwelling on his behalf…"

Li Jiangqian nodded with a flicker of amusement. He knew perfectly well why Mount Jingyi had suddenly gone silent.

‘How could they dare to write back?’ he thought.

The Xuanyi Dao lineage was an Eastern Sea power; their intelligence network in Jiangbei was certainly no match for the Li family’s. They likely only knew that a True Monarch was coming. Now, a token from the Secret Diffusion Dao lineage had appeared, and Shouding himself was a practitioner of that path. The connection was too obvious to ignore, and they were undoubtedly terrified.

‘If Shouding were to walk out of Jiangbei openly right now, I doubt even the Chunyi Dao Gate would dare ambush him. He could reach the foot of Mount Jingyi, and Xuanyi wouldn't even dare open the gates for him.’

‘After all,’ he mused, ‘a mainland power might still show a sliver of decorum, perhaps sending someone to read an edict. But the overseas factions are demonic cultivators, and the entire Xuanyi sect cultivates Earth Virtue… If the reincarnated True Monarch were to slap Xuanyi across the face, they’d have to offer up the other cheek, worried that he wasn't fully satisfied.’

At that moment, Li Jiangqian felt that his family's reputation on the righteous path was rather useful. At the very least, major powers had to maintain some semblance of decorum and cared about appearances.

Seeing Wang Quwan's uneasy expression, Li Jiangqian smiled. "Protector Wang, there is no need for such courtesy. We are all family here. Elder Sun was once a capable aide under Daoist Master Changxi of the Profound Peak Dao lineage. His medical skills are more than reliable."

He paused briefly, steering the conversation toward the Profound Peak lineage. He recounted the story of the "One-Incense-Stick Family," leaving Wang Quwan utterly dumbfounded. For a moment, Wang Quwan almost thought Li Jiangqian was mocking him, but then he continued.

"The one known as the 'Radiant Fire Spear' back then, who later became Daoist Master Chu, was a similar case."

The Profound Peak was a lofty Purple Mansion Realm sect. Though it had declined, its members were still honored guests of Daoist Masters. To Wang Quwan, such matters were distant. But Chu Yi, the "Radiant Fire Spear," had passed through Jiangbei on his journey north years ago; the Wang family was certain to have records of it. Understanding dawned in Wang Quwan's heart.

"So that's how it is… Daoist Master Chu is also a reincarnated True Monarch… No wonder he could break through to the Purple Mansion Realm in the middle of a battle…"

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian could only shake his head with a hint of resignation. "The words 'in battle' and 'breakthrough to Purple Mansion Realm' simply do not belong together. Not even the greatest genius could achieve such a feat. It is merely a game for a True Monarch. The reason I sought you out is because a True Monarch is about to be reincarnated in Jiangbei."

He paused, then added, "This is a celestial decree from the north."

Handling Wang Quwan was an exceedingly delicate matter. The Ding clan of Ding Weizeng had been persecuted and their numbers had dwindled; they had already been relocated to the lake. This left Wang Quwan as the most prestigious local cultivator remaining in Jiangbei.

The Wang clan’s direct bloodline numbered in the tens of thousands, scattered throughout Jiangbei. Many sects in the region had members of the Jiangbei Wang clan within their ranks. Protecting the entire clan was simply not realistic.

The fatal blow was that the mortal members of the Jiangbei Wang clan were all either landlords or local gentry—figures essential for maintaining regional stability. On any normal day, they were the common folk the immortal sects spoke of protecting. But when a True Monarch was reincarnated, these were the very people who would become the first stepping stones.

From these mortals, one could easily trace a path back to the cultivators. The Wang clan was spread far and wide; following the threads could lead directly back to Wang Quwan himself. A reincarnated True Monarch didn't operate on logic. If he toppled a landlord connected to the Wangs, he could very well slaughter his way to the river's edge, causing a massive embarrassment for the Li family.

Li Jiangqian still hoped to protect Wang Quwan. It wasn’t because of the resources the Li family had invested in him over the years, but because of the fragment hidden within their secret vault.

But there were limits to that protection. Li Jiangqian would never endanger his own family's survival for one man. He carefully watched the shock on the other's face and said softly, "The number of people in the family who know of this can be counted on one hand. I tell you this because the Wang clan's entanglements in Jiangbei run too deep. If arrangements are not made soon, disaster is inevitable."

Sweat immediately beaded on Wang Quwan's forehead.

"To ensure your own safety, relocating your clan is the best option," Li Jiangqian continued. "Once the True Monarch has departed, it will not be too late to return to Jiangbei."

From the bottom of his heart, Li Jiangqian hoped Wang Quwan would choose this path. Wang Quwan was different from the family’s other retainers and protectors. The Wang clan held immense sway in Jiangbei, a colossal entity that could answer his call. The Li family couldn't conveniently extend its influence across the river, and Wang Quwan had never truly committed his heart to the lake. He could never become one of the Li family’s true, trusted followers.

If he could use this event to weaken the ties between Wang Quwan and the Wang clan, and bring people like him to the lake, the situation would be entirely different.

But Wang Quwan thought it over and said in a low voice, "The Jiangbei Wang clan numbers in the tens of thousands. I cannot simply sit by and watch. Furthermore, if the True Monarch is reincarnated, it is possible he could be born as a Wang. If I abandon them for the lake today, it could create hidden dangers for the future."

"In this subordinate's humble opinion," he continued, "the ties of blood cannot be cleanly severed, no matter how one tries. It is impossible to move every member of the Wang clan to the lake. If even one person who is left behind makes a mistake, the True Monarch will see it as the mistake of the entire clan. Trouble will follow."

Whether such ties could truly be severed depended on the person in question. But for a man of Wang Quwan's character, being forced to do so would be more difficult than taking his life. Hearing his reply, Li Jiangqian felt a sense of apprehension and sighed internally.

‘This man… is truly bound by fate…’

It was clear now. Since Wang Quwan was determined to share the fate of the Jiangbei Wang clan, he was embracing an enormous risk. Li Jiangqian could not force him, could not tie him up and drag him away. It seemed all he could do was arrange for a favorable outcome.

‘So this is the work of destiny. Wang Quwan's fate was likely intertwined with the True Monarch's reincarnation from the very beginning. Now, as the day approaches, it is forcing my hand, making me send him to Jiangbei to play the role he was meant to play. Marvelous… truly marvelous.’

Li Jiangqian could only say, "Since your mind is made up, I will 'demote' you to a post in Jiangbei. You are to ignore whatever happens in Funan and head directly to your clan's territory. Do not speak of what you should not, or you will face annihilation. More than one Daoist Master is watching from the Great Void."

Wang Quwan bowed slightly. "This subordinate will depart immediately to stand guard in Jiangbei for six years. When the time is up, I will return to the lake to report."

Li Jiangqian shook his head gravely and watched him leave. Just then, Qu Bushi came to report. The old man spoke in a low voice, "Patriarch, a message from the north. They have already set out for Funan."

Li Jiangqian pulled his thoughts back to the present and nodded silently. "White Ape…"

He stopped mid-sentence, looking up thoughtfully. Outside the hall, a brilliant flare of fire descended, pulsing with light. A woman strode through the air.

She wore a long red dress, her features exquisite and captivating. She rode upon a roaring True Fire, holding a hexagonal lantern in her hand. Inside it, a soft, downy flame flickered gently. She wore a slight smile. Li Jiangqian rose hastily.

"Greetings, Great Aunt! Congratulations on emerging from seclusion and advancing your cultivation!"

Li Minggong returned the smile. Following behind her was a tall, white-haired old man clad in stone armor. It was, without a doubt, the White Ape.

With two pieces of good news arriving at once, Li Jiangqian let out a small breath of relief. Li Minggong waved for Qu Bushi to leave, her expression turning serious.

"My recovery shouldn't have taken this long," she said. "But my cultivation had just been refined when I encountered the Inward Heart Surging Profundity, an auspicious state for fire-attribute cultivators seeking a breakthrough. I felt an insight and broke through to the mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. It was a stroke of luck, but my foundation was unstable, so I spent extra time solidifying my cultivation."

"So that's what happened!"

Li Jiangqian offered a few more words of congratulations, but Li Minggong said gravely, "This is not the time for celebration. Upon leaving seclusion, I first paid my respects to the Old Master. He told me of the current troubles, and I came to find you immediately. How have you arranged our forces for the riverbank?"

Li Jiangqian organized his thoughts and replied at once, "Protector Ding holds a grudge against the Capital immortals Dao, so I've left him on the north bank. Protector Cui will guard the east bank. The rest will cross the river with me to spar with the Capital immortals Dao. The Embyronic Breathing cultivators in the family need not go, but the Qi Refining disciples can join the fights to gain experience."

"I have instructed both sides that this is merely a period of probing and standoffs," he added. "They are to avoid lethal force in all matters to prevent bloodshed from escalating the situation…"

The matter of the True Monarch could not be spoken of freely, so this excuse was passable. Li Minggong nodded thoughtfully.

"It is for the best that Ding Weizeng is not involved. The Ding family was nearly wiped out by Wenhu and uprooted from their lands. Although the clan has moved here, it's possible some of their bloodline remains in Jiangbei. It is not wise for him to get involved."

"Miaoshui and Qu Bushi are rogue cultivators…"

As Li Minggong was pondering, Li Jiangqian reminded her, "There are also two demonic cultivators with sealed cultivation on the east bank… Their surname is Wen. They migrated from the Eastern Sea and have been tending the furnaces on the mountain for many years. Since they hail from the Eastern Sea, it shouldn't be an issue… If Great Aunt has any concerns, I can go and deal with them."

Li Minggong shook her head, the hexagonal lantern in her hand swaying slightly. "That won't be necessary… I didn't expect so much to have happened. To think that in the end, we must join forces with the Capital immortals Dao. If they truly are at odds with Changxiao, then so be it. But I fear that Daoist Master is a cunning one, deliberately saying such things to seize upon our moment of weakness and plot some other scheme."

A thoughtful look crossed Li Jiangqian's face, but the palace-gowned woman before him said, "There is no use in overthinking it now. You and I will go to the river together."

***

On Azure Pond Peak, white mist swirled and clouds drifted. This place was the hub of the Azure Pond Sect’s Tianyuan One Dao Spiritual Array, a place where the spiritual energy should have remained constant day after day. Now, however, it held a touch of chill.

A blast of frost and snow swept in, landing before a cave-dwelling and solidifying into a woman in white. She was exceptionally beautiful, and the faint fragrance of pine spread from her. She took a step forward and announced in a clear voice, "Junior Ning Wan requests an audience with Senior Si!"

Ning Wan was a cultivator of Azure Pond. Her breakthrough had not been made public, nor had she yet called for a gathering of cultivators to celebrate. Instead, she had come directly to the main peak to meet with Yuanxiu.

After a moment's wait, an aged voice emerged, "Wan'er, you've come out of seclusion. Please, come in."

Ning Wan's form dissolved into white snow, reappearing over a large pool of Pristine Water that shimmered like a vast gemstone. In the midst of the cold snow, six ornate jade thrones carved from azure jade appeared even more brilliant. On one of the thrones sat an old man, looking his age. His face was a dense, overlapping mesh of wrinkles, as gnarled as old tree bark, and his eyes seemed somewhat vacant.

Ning Wan did not sit beside him. Instead, she took her place on the third-to-last throne. With one not taking the main seat and the other sitting two seats away on the same side, the arrangement looked awkward, as if each of the six thrones had a specific owner.

Unlike other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who often concealed their aged appearance, Yuanxiu made no such attempt. "My heartfelt congratulations," he said in a raspy voice.

"I told my martial brother earlier that you went into seclusion too soon. You wouldn't be able to use the spirit pills that Yuanli and Xuanfeng obtained in Anhuai Heaven, which is a true pity. But he paid me no mind. I suppose he was certain you would succeed."

The relationship between the martial brothers Yuanxiu and Yuansu was complicated. They were once close but had later gone their separate ways. Ning Wan was in no position to comment, so she simply replied, "The Daoist Master had another spirit pill he obtained long ago… he allowed me to consume it. I was also quite fortunate, and thus I succeeded."

Yuanxiu let out a derisive snort. "When Chi Wei asked him, he gave a cold face and said he obtained nothing. It was a lie, of course. If not for the Dharma Treasure in Yuansu's hands, and the fact that Chi Wei was on death's door, who knows what he might have done."

Dense spiritual energy mixed with the glow of Dharma, illuminating the entire cave-dwelling with a radiant light that made Ning Wan herself seem to shine. She said gently, "Did anyone pursue the matter of Can Lufu's fake pill? When he was dying, everyone gave him leeway. After he died, he was dust returning to dust, and no one cared."

Her words were not pleasant and seemed to carry a hidden meaning. A gurgling laugh rumbled in Yuanxiu's throat. The five fingers of his exposed left hand were stretched taut. Then, one by one, they separated, revealing more than ten fingers on that palm, like the gnarled roots of an old tree, clamped firmly onto the jade throne. He chuckled, "Indeed! Indeed!"

His eyes reflected the shimmering Pristine Merging Owl Pool, and the smile on his face grew wider. He suddenly said, "You may not believe me, but the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal is not in my possession."
