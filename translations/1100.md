# Chapter 1100: A Great Fissure Upon the Body

"Boom!"

The earth shuddered. A golden shadow plummeted from the heavens, crashing into the mountain peak with such force that stone fragmented and Li Fire scattered everywhere. The famed Li Fire Golden Spear, a weapon of terrible renown in the north, was embedded in the center of a spiderweb of cracks, its shaft trembling faintly. Its light had dimmed, a pale imitation of the brilliant golden halberd still blazing in the sky.

The man with golden eyes and ink-black armor stood silently in the air. His luxurious Campaign Cloak was gone, and his domineering, bright long-halberd had fallen into the valley below. His lips were a shade paler than usual. With only a single halberd in hand, he was far more terrifying than when he had arrived in full regalia, striking all the cultivators present breathless.

"Boom!"

Thunder continued to rumble through the world. The gloomy clouds seemed to lighten. The dark, illusory sheen of the Guzhou Cauldron flickered across the sky for a moment, then vanished.

A susurrus filled the air as white sand and glazed glass began to fall from the sky. The sand, fine as dust, poured down like a blizzard, blanketing the entirety of Baixiang Valley. Thousands of glass shards tumbled down, some as large as a man's head, others bright as stars, weaving together like rain.

And in this storm of glass, a vast shadow fell over the land.

It was a head, large as a mountain, crowned with a flesh-usnisa shaped like a lotus.

Vast Cicada's Dharma Body was peculiar. It seemed less cultivated by his own power and more borrowed from an external force. In the instant its light collapsed, it didn't immediately disintegrate. Instead, it fell from the sky like a meteorite.

The countless monks, golden halls, and palaces that once stood upon his head—like the shimmering facades of two grotto-heavens—were now dull gray. The palaces had collapsed. His mouth gaped powerlessly, the space between his interlocking, razor-sharp teeth now empty.

The White Cicada that had once crouched in his mouth was gone.

A single line, gleaming gold-to-white, appeared on his usnisa. It ran down through his brow, over the bridge of his nose, across his lower lip, and extended all the way to the raw, severed stump of his neck.

"Boom!"

As the colossal head struck the valley floor, it toppled sideways. The two halves of its face slowly pulled apart, then fell wide with a deafening crash, exposing the jade-like matter of the brain and bone within.

Cleft in two, a Maha had fallen.

'Vast Cicada is dead. One strike.'

The entire Baixiang Valley fell into a deathly silence. Li Jiangliang, standing near the corpse, felt a chill creep through his entire body. He turned to his brothers. Li Jiangxia was frozen in place, speechless. Li Jianglong simply watched, his face a mask of silence.

The same, incredulous thought rose in all three of their minds:

'One halberd...'

Changyun quietly pressed his palms together, a look of understanding on his face. Touba Ci, however, seemed blinded by the scorching golden light, staring in raw disbelief at the corpse's gray-white pupils. Even one as proud as he was struck silent.

'...'

'He died! He died without even connecting to the Precious Tusk!'

'Is... is he even human?'

Who was Vast Cicada? He was the master of the Precious Tusk Golden Land. To put it bluntly, he wasn't just the darling of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm; he was a figure the entire Buddhist cultivators' Daoist Tradition kept its eye on, someone personally watched by the Lord of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm himself...

His death wasn't just the death of a fifth-reincarnation Maha. It meant that the Precious Tusk Golden Land—a prize the Buddhists already had in the cooking pot—had just sprouted wings and flown away, lost from their grasp once more!
His death was comparable to that of a seventh or even eighth-reincarnation Great Maha!

Gao Fangjing felt his head spin. He didn't dare look up, keeping his gaze lowered.

'We were all played... The Emperor of Wei used a single Crimson Severing Arrowhead to toy with the Baiqiang until they crossed the Taoshui four times to their doom. Now that same divine ability is in _his_ hands, and he treats Touba Ci and Changyun as if they're nothing... They even ended up helping him...'

The same question surfaced in everyone's mind.

'Do we still fight?'

But the most terrified, the most incredulous, were the five Merciful Ones. No one even spared a glance at the crack-covered Audience with the Celestial Gate. As the white sand and glass rained down, four of them hesitated, then turned in unison to stare at the fifth.

This was the Merciful One from the Bodhisattva seat—Vast Cicada's own attendant.

The attendant's golden face was ashen. He stood frozen, as if in a nightmare. He couldn't comprehend it... in the span of a single turn, his own Maha... a dignified fifth-reincarnation Maha, had been struck down!

The Precious Tusk was lost, fled... but his own position was still tied to it, still bound within Vast Cicada's 'locus'!

Back when the Wrath manifestation fell and the Buddhist Land was sealed, even the esteemed Dharma Protector of the northern Demon-Subduing Temple, Wrath's direct disciple, was left half-dead, forced to live on with a paralyzed Dharma Body... What hope was there for the already-faltering, insignificant Precious Tusk?

He had only a moment to show his despair before the illusory light of his body vanished. His life-mandate gushed from him like a ruptured dam. In the space of a single breath, he screamed and exploded into a fine mist of blood.

No glass, no golden sand. As if he were nothing but a mortal.

But that one scream caused the silent Baixiang Valley to suddenly shudder. A pure white sword-light shot skyward, only to be met by countless pink pupils exploding in the air. A glittering, precious pearl burst, shattering the azure-white light to pieces. The thousand-eyed golden body standing on the hill vanished abruptly!

That Maha, seeing the tide turn, hadn't made a sound. He abandoned his treasure, paid a steep price in blood, and simply fled.

'What's left to fight? Vast Cicada is dead, and he was the one holding the Precious Tusk!'

Zhelu found the situation so unbelievable it was almost comical.

'The South's plan... they don't move, but when they do, it's terrifying. After that execution, Li Zhouwei is merely a little pale, his divine ability only shaken... What does that even mean? It means the North just lost Vast Cicada—a man whose combat power ranked in the top three here—for absolutely nothing!'

With one side waxing and the other waning, it was enough to overturn the result of a major battle. To say nothing of the other cultivators... what would they think after seeing this? The Guzhou Cauldron was still flashing. Who'll be the next to be exiled by it and die completely?

He, Zhelu, wasn't about to gamble on whether these 'immortal cultivators' had some other way to restrain Li Zhouwei!

The instant Zhelu, the strongest among them, fled, divine abilities of every color exploded in the sky as their casters scattered. Before the roiling dark clouds could envelop the earth, one golden body after another brazenly self-detonated. The northern Daoist Masters fled for their lives amid the earth-shattering blasts of light.

But the enveloping speed of Yang Ruizao's Guzhou Cauldron was terrifying. It spread in a flash. Those far away, or those who had been caught in the Crimson Severing Arrowhead earlier, were better off. But the Merciful Ones who were close, struggling against the three Holders of the Profound, had no time to self-detonate. They didn't even have the _right_ to.

Amidst the brilliant, shattering light, one was struck by the Exiled Qi and perished on the spot. The remaining two stood frozen, speechless... The terrible flames of Lightless Water and Fire still burned on their bodies. There was no road to heaven, no gate to earth.

Under the curtain of white sand, the Great Zhao's forces routed, collapsing like a landslide, scattering like the tide.

Whether it was Chen Yin, who had been facing Helian Wujiang, or Xianyao, who had been struggling under Murong Yan's assault, they had only been managing a desperate delay. Now suddenly liberated, they retreated in disarray, exchanging looks of shock and profound relief.

Chen Yin, his face somber, his hand on his sword; Xianyao, silent and grim; Tinglan, her expression one of pure astonishment; and even Liu Bai, who had arrived with his sword on his back. All of them looked at Li Zhouwei. Any words of praise or shock died in their throats, leaving only silence.

'This was Yang Ruiyi's plan all along...'

'From start to finish, it was an act. An act put on by Yang Ruiyi and Li Ximing... Scheming that involves Dharma Masters isn't like ordinary affairs. They kept all of us in the dark...'

And then, of course, there was Daoist Master Zhaojing—Li Ximing—striding through the air toward them, head high and a broad smile on his face.

'Heh!'

The Daoist Master had already put away his golden pagoda. With a wave of his sleeve, he began meticulously picking through the falling glass, retrieving a white-skinned, gold-edged Profound Drum and a Valley Water glazed lotus throne. He used another divine ability to snag the tattered kasaya, with its gaping hole, from where it lay on the ground.

Now, with a slight crook of his finger, the golden spear on the ground leaped into the air. Like a young swallow returning to its nest, it flew into his grasp. Seven chi and five cun long, its colors were dazzling, wreathed in roaring flame. A truly fine treasure!

Naturally, no one would dream of fighting the Li Clan for these spoils. Li Ximing gathered them with evident satisfaction.

But his good cheer didn't stop him from noticing the cracks on Li Zhouwei's Audience with the Celestial Gate. Forgetting for a moment how satisfying Vast Cicada's death was, he sent a slightly worried, private transmission.

'How bad is the damage?'

Li Zhouwei remained perfectly still, appearing gravely injured and struggling to regulate his breathing. In reality, his body was a raging torrent. Illusions flickered at the edge of his vision, flaring into existence only to be extinguished.

The feedback from Illuminating Sun and Moon!

The feedback from slaying Vast Cicada was immense. If his Dao-Profundity had already surpassed Daoist Masters like Helian Wujiang—who focused primarily on spell arts—when he first emerged from seclusion, he had now taken another enormous step. He had left Helian Wujiang far behind, reaching what could be called the third rank.

The problem was that while Chen Yin had once classified cultivators like Chi Buzi and Changxiao as the 'second rank', Dao-Profundity was difficult to quantify. The more profound it became, the vaster and more difficult the path. The gap between someone like Chi Buzi and Helian Wujiang was terrifyingly large—you could fit two Azure Pond Sects in that gap, and then some.

After this battle, Li Zhouwei had a much deeper appreciation for the benefits of profound Dao-Profundity. It was a subtle, pervasive advantage in both cultivation and combat. He was in no hurry.

'It was only Vast Cicada... There will be other chances. I've now reached the immortal threshold of the Purple Mystery. I have plenty of time to stir up a storm.'

He gave Li Ximing a slight nod.

In truth, his condition was not good. Though his expended dharma power and divine ability were rapidly replenishing as the battle concluded, the damage to his Audience with the Celestial Gate was causing his Shengyang Acupoint to throb with excruciating pain, sending tremors through him again and again.

'Audience with the Celestial Gate is powerful, but it wasn't meant to be used that way. It can't withstand that kind of abuse. Anyone else who took that hit would have their divine ability crippled, needing more than a decade of nurturing to recover. Fortunately, my foundation is solid, my preparations were thorough, and I had the Campaign Cloak... It's manageable.'

The injury was neither light nor severe. It had already recovered partially when the Crimson Severing Arrowhead was withdrawn. Furthermore, his White Qilin fate had been pushed to its peak, and the success of Perilous Tread had granted him immediate feedback, applying an additional ninety percent progress to the repairs...

'I estimate this feedback will stabilize the divine ability within three days, making it usable. In three months, the injury will be minor, and the feedback will be exhausted. After that, I'll nurture it myself and take some pills. I'll be fully recovered within a year.'

'It's just a shame the Pure Qi from the Profound Vastness Art can only repair the Dharma Body, not a divine ability. Otherwise, this would be even faster.'

Seeing his elder nod, clearly relieved, the King Wei, the center of everyone's attention, casually accepted the long-halberd, delivered by a qilin condensed from rolling mist. He reversed the weapon's grip, and his golden eyes traversed the distance, landing on the two Merciful Ones. Cloaked in fire and water, they were as still and terrified as quails.

'All of this... is immortal merit...'

Seeing the gaze of this veritable god of slaughter fall upon them, the two men turned deathly pale. Just as the curved blade began to turn, Yang Ruizao finally stepped out from the crowd. He bowed respectfully.

"Your Majesty, I ask you to stay your hand—they must be captured and presented before the Emperor."

Yang Ruizao's seniority was considerable, but he was still intimidated by Li Zhouwei. He kept his gaze lowered, not daring to look at him directly. Fortunately, the King Wei nodded. He produced an edict from his sleeve and spoke.

"Tinglan, Zhaojing. Return and reinforce at once. Defend Tongmo and the Western Mountains. Be wary of Western Shu making another move."

Li Zhouwei's arrival had achieved the objective of routing the Buddhists, but the South's overall strength was still a step behind. Their position remained dire. The network formed by Xuanmiao and Shanji was like a nail, simultaneously invading Jiangnan and stabbing into the flank of their current positions at Tangdao and Sanjiang. It was an awkward predicament.

'And the Qing Clan is notoriously fickle. They wouldn't hesitate to probe eastward again to weaken the gains made by the Great Song... It's inevitable.'

When it came down to it, in the hearts of men like Li Zhouwei and Chen Yin, the security of their own territories would always come before the Great Song. If a true crisis emerged, they wouldn't hesitate to abandon their current, glorious victory.

To appease these concerns, Yang Ruiyi had already dispatched Wenqing of Purple Smoke. With this arrangement clearly in place, the two accepted the order and immediately departed. Reassured, Li Zhouwei addressed the remaining group:

"Baixiang is taken and the Zhao cultivators have scattered. But Baiye is still a threat at our flank, with Xuanmiao at its back. If they send troops, our rearguard will be thrown into chaos. I ask you all to guard Baixiang Valley. Use the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter as a pocket to menace Baiye and Xuanmiao."

They all agreed. Only then did the King Wei turn to Liu Bai, a smile touching his lips.

"Protector-General, I ask you to coordinate with me. From east and west, let us break the siege of Tangdao together!"

...

Golden light filled the world.

East of Guanlong, north of Luoxia, amidst the sprawling yellow earth and the vast, rolling terrain of the Taihang Mountains, five great peaks rose. Their summits were bare of trees, crowned instead with countless golden temples. This was the Radiance Dharma Realm's Five Peaks Mountain. Its highest point was the Qingliang Terrace.

Atop this Buddhist terrace stood innumerable golden statues. To the side, the western terrace was the Precious Tusk Terrace. It, too, hosted countless temples and even more monks. Many cultivators could be seen flying to and fro, taking up temporary residence there.

At this moment, however, the atmosphere on the Precious Tusk Terrace was bizarre. Monks hurried back and forth, their steps chaotic. Some whispered in hushed tones, others spoke with unconcealed hatred. One Great Virtue even collapsed, vomiting blood, and was hurriedly carried into a temple.

Through the din, an old monk hurried up the steps, his face a mask of terror. He pushed his way into the highest temple. In the center stood a statue, golden-eyed and red-bodied, emanating infinite radiance. A qilin crouched beneath its seat. It stood ninety-nine zhang and nine chi tall, just one chi shorter than the Supreme Statue on the Qingliang Terrace.

To the side stood another statue, that of a handsome monk with clear, fine features, his form a pure, unstained white. It stood fifty-five zhang tall. But now... a single gold-white line snaked down from the statue's smooth crown, disappearing into its collar.

The meaning of this sight was terrifyingly clear.

"My lord!"

The old monk felt his world collapse. He fell to his knees with a thud, weeping uncontrollably, half-mad with terror. After crying for a long moment, he scrambled back to his feet and stumbled out, wailing:

"Quickly, go and get... go and get the Youngest Martial Grand-Uncle!"

But all at once, the chaos in the temple ceased. A pair of simple cloth shoes stepped into the hall. A young monk in black robes helped the old man to his feet. His expression was complex as he gently wiped the tears from the old man's face, then raised his gaze to the fractured statue.

The statue looked as if it might shatter at any second, yet some invisible force held its form together, keeping it whole. The dense network of cracks seemed almost a decoration, settled perfectly and harmoniously upon its body.

Only the kasaya remained unbroken.

The black-robed monk watched for a moment before stepping forward, his hand outstretched. As if summoned, the kasaya on the statue began to dissolve into a brilliant cascade of light, pouring onto the floor like a resplendent waterfall. The young monk's eyes were rimmed with red.

"A Great Fissure upon the body," he said quietly. "Martial-Nephew's wish has been fulfilled. This cannot be called a death filled with regret."
