# Chapter 790: Making a Scene

Li Zhouluo hesitated for a moment, lifting the letter. Every eye in the hall was fixed on him. An Siwei, a Foundation Establishment cultivator of the An family, stood beside An Zheyan but remained silent.

Matters concerning the ore veins were notorious for exploitation. An Xuanxin, the man in charge, was someone Li Zhouluo had personally summoned before. Both the young man and his elder brother, An Xuantong, were renowned geniuses of their generation. Li Zhouluo was familiar enough with them and quickly formed a strategy.

'The An family is illustrious; they have no need to skim a few minerals. Besides, the daily ledgers all balance. They didn't take anything. These four individuals represent ninety percent of the influence on the lake. I must divide them.'

He set the letter down and spoke in a conciliatory tone. "Elders, please, do not be anxious. All matters must be handled reasonably. I have personally reviewed every daily report Xuanxin has submitted. This issue regarding the shifting branch veins is precisely why we are finalizing new regulations. I was just about to consult with him on this. Naturally, there has been no misappropriation or theft."

Having offered an exit, he gave a subtle signal. Dili Guang immediately moved to help An Xuanxin to his feet. As the kneeling An family members rose, the elderly An Zheyan, face flushed red, began a long tirade about his failure in disciplining the youth, only to be pulled back by An Siwei. The middle-aged Foundation Establishment expert turned, fixed An Xuanxin with an icy glare, and declared:

"However, the West Bank is in turmoil. An Xuanxin is guilty of negligent oversight! I shall apprehend him immediately and deliver him to the Jade Court for interrogation!"

He seized An Xuanxin, hauling him up from the floor, and led the other An members straight out of the hall. They had made a clean retreat.

As soon as the An family departed, Li Chengzhi —who had been reclining weakly in his seat—immediately bowed his head. Li Zhouming, who had previously spoken in support of the Ans, felt a growing sense of unease. While he excelled at little else, his many years as a rake, dedicated to deciphering the hearts of women, had made him an expert at reading expressions. Watching the clan elders, the infamous wastrel grew uncomfortable. With a *snap*, his fan closed, and his grip tightened around it.

Most people only offered him superficial respect; privately, none took him seriously. Li Chenghao, his hair gray, watched the An family depart before turning to ask in a low voice, "Are Zhoufang and Zhouyang still not here?"

The fathers of those two—the eldest and second eldest of the 'Zhou' generation—had perished, making their uncle, Li Chenghao, their closest relation. They were usually completely obedient to him, yet they were conspicuously absent. Without the backing of those two, and the other elders being mere mortals, Li Chenghao felt a surge of insecurity.

Li Zhouluo, having temporarily settled the An Xuanxin matter, focused on the remaining petitioners. One was Ren Ting, the maternal uncle of Li Minggong. The other was Li Chengpan, his own clan-uncle. Each was more difficult to handle than the last. He decided to squeeze the softest target first. "Li Hun!" he called.

Li Hun’s seniority placed him outside the main lineage. He only carried any weight because his father, Li Anshuo, managed affairs on the North Shore and had married into the Chen family. In this main hall, however, that prestige meant nothing. He was huddled near the back, shrinking away. At Li Zhouluo’s summons, the middle-aged man trembled, shuffled forward two inches on his knees, and stammered, "This lowly one is present!"

Li Zhouluo suspected the three petitioners had coordinated their stories. He began the interrogation: "You oversee the spirit rice. A thirty-percent bribe must have passed through your hands. I am currently summoning the various families of the West Bank and all peak officials for cross-examination. Confess now who ordered you... Otherwise, the moment the truth is exposed, I will execute you first."

Li Hun kowtowed. "Reporting to the Patriarch! There was such an arrangement. But this lowly one was only following orders! I was instructed to collect the payments in two separate portions. The directive came from Guest Elder Ye of Nine Gates Peak. He said it was an order from the Nine Gates Peak Supervisor... These matters... they have always been handled by the Nine Gates Peak Supervisor."

The hall fell silent. Li Zhouluo froze. The Nine Gates Peak Supervisor... was An Xuanxin, the very man who had just walked free.

"Where is this Guest Elder Ye?" Li Zhouluo demanded.

From the side, Chen Donghe replied: "I looked into him. Several months ago, he reported achieving peak Embyronic Breathing. He registered his status with the family and has already departed to seek an opportunity for a breakthrough."

'A convenient escape,' Li Zhouluo thought. He glanced at Li Hun, who looked genuinely terrified and likely knew nothing deeper. He gave a low command: "Dili Guang. Go retrieve An Xuanxin and the woman from the He family. Then proceed to the shore and begin interrogating the peak officials. Bring every waiting family head up the mountain, one by one."

Chen Donghe answered quietly, "Patriarch... the He family woman has already taken her own life."

The words made Li Zhouluo grit his teeth. Suddenly, the pale, plump Li Xixuan knelt forward, sighing dramatically. "Patriarch! These underlings are nothing but insects, scheming and lying! It is impossible to discern the truth! I beg you... please ask Li Chenghuai! Let him use a Dharma Art, and this whole mess will be understood instantly!"

This demand caught Li Zhouluo completely off guard, stunning him. Li Chenghao immediately seconded the request, dropping to his knees. "The boy's reputation cannot be ruined like this! Please, Patriarch, summon our brother to ascertain the truth!"

Li Chengzhi remained seated in silence. The final elder, Li Xie, stirred. He was an old man with thinning white hair and a kind face, but he merely closed his eyes, refusing to join the petition.

Li Zhouluo fell silent, his gaze sweeping across the petitioners. Li Chengzhi, who clearly wanted to protect An Xuanxin, had been forced to open his eyes at the mention of the "Nine Gates Peak Supervisor," yet he remained silent. Of the four, this uncle seemed the most reluctant participant.

That left Li Xixuan and Li Cheng—the only one with a cultivation base—as the most insistent. Li Chenghao's father, Li Xie, had built his entire reputation on the martyrdom of his own sons; he clearly prized his standing and now appeared deeply conflicted.

'This is obviously a coordinated effort... Why are they so insistent that Father break his seclusion?'

Unable to grasp their true motive, he gritted his teeth. "Father is injured. It is not appropriate for him to break seclusion over such a minor issue."

Li Xixuan sighed, his pale, plump face a mask of regret. "We were hoping the family could make this decision together. We must ask Li Chenghuai to come. This concerns the honor of the entire clan. An investigation would take less than half a day... Otherwise, Chengpan’s life is utterly ruined!"

Li Xixuan had blocked every rebuttal. In the center of the hall, Li Chengpan remained silent, head bowed, the very image of patient suffering. The pressure shifted entirely back to Li Zhouluo. But before he could respond, a furious shout echoed through the hall:

"Did you esteemed elders not hear the Patriarch’s decision?"

The public roar stunned the assembly. Everyone looked up, astonished to see a young master in flowing red robes striding forward, his face a mask of fury.

It was Li Zhouming. He couldn't restrain himself any longer. The direct grandson of the Purple Mansion patriarch, seething with anger, slammed his fan down and shouted:

"If it cannot be investigated now, then lock them all up and wait a year or two! One of you is browbeating, the other is sighing in despair. What exactly are you trying to pull?"

The hall was struck dumb. People exchanged confused glances, whispering amongst themselves. 'What madness has seized this young master now?'

Li Xixuan was stunned speechless by the outburst. He was the father of Li Minggong; who dared treat him with such contempt? His pale face instantly flushed crimson. "You..." he sputtered.

Li Zhouming’s anger had been simmering throughout the entire proceeding. His red robes trembled as he advanced another step. "I only call you 'Elder' out of respect! If you hadn’t sired a talented daughter, what the hell would you be? I may be a wastrel, but at least I know how to stay down! What do you want? What?! You’re taking advantage of the Daoist Master's absence to bully us juniors, aren't you! You... you... you son of a..."

Even fouler curses were about to spill forth when Li Chengzhi, shocked out of his deathbed stupor, sat bolt upright. He grabbed Li Zhouming’s sleeve, roaring, "You animal! Are you trying to stage a rebellion?"

The hall descended into chaos. Li Zhouming was known as an impulsive wastrel, but his temperament was usually predictable. No one had anticipated this sudden explosion of madness. As the direct grandson of the Purple Mansion patriarch, no one dared truly provoke him, so they all scrambled backward. Only his father, Li Chengzhi, leaped to his feet—back no longer aching, legs suddenly strong, brimming with vigor—and seized him, screaming insults.

Yet his father was only a mortal; he stood no chance of restraining his son.

Unreliable though he was, Li Zhouming was still at the third level of Qi Refining. Of the four elders, only Li Chenghao possessed a cultivation base, and he was a level weaker. When this wastrel went berserk, he was like a bull. Terrified of being slapped to death, Li Xixuan lost all decorum, scrambling backward in a panic as Li Chenghao and two younger relatives rushed frantically to shield him.

"Wicked beast!"

Li Zhouming tuned out his father’s screaming. He finally understood. He realized the speech his family had fed him earlier was *also* part of this scheme to pressure Li Zhouluo. A wave of hot, resentful fury washed over him. The surrounding chaos—the shouting, the gasps of alarm—made his head spin. For the first time in his life, his eyes widened not in petulance, but in genuine rage. He roared, "Shut your damn mouths!"

He infused the roar with spiritual energy. It exploded like sudden thunder. Cultivators merely flinched; the mortals in the hall nearly had their eardrums rupture. Every gaze snapped toward him.

They saw a young man with sharp features and strong brows. His usual, indifferent demeanor had been utterly burned away by rage. A shimmering radiance—the light of Bright Yang —welled up around him. With his eyes wide in fury, he stood center-stage, hands clasped behind his back.

As the echo faded, the hall filled with the rustle of robes as nearly everyone dropped to their knees.

Li Zhouming was, after all, the biological grandson of Li Ximing. Despite the garish red robes, despite the powder and rouge, the resemblance in his brow and eyes was undeniable. Standing there radiating Bright Yang, his glare burning, he looked exactly like the Clan Head. He was only thinner and lacked the spark of Profound Light between the brows. The sight terrified the assembly. Even the Foundation Establishment guest elders had to avert their gaze, exchanging a look before kneeling.

"Daoist Master..."

Even his own father, Li Chengzhi, felt his heart leap into his throat. He released his grip as if he had touched hot coals. The insult "beast" died on his lips. His legs gave out, and he nearly collapsed.

The courtyard was utterly silent, broken only when points of red light materialized beside Li Zhouming. A powerful, stocky man clad in crimson battle armor instantly appeared at his side.

The man radiated a ferocious, baleful aura. He had a strong jaw and a bristling mustache, and his eyes cut like swords, forcing everyone to lower their gaze. He held two short clubs, his chin slightly lifted, standing guard by Li Zhouming. His expression was so dark it looked ready to bleed.

The Palace-Yang Tiger: Ding Weizeng.

Only at this moment did everyone—both on the mountain and below—finally remember exactly who he was: the direct grandson of the Purple Mansion patriarch. They fell silent as winter cicadas, daring not even to meet another's gaze. The hall was filled with kneeling figures, most pressing their foreheads to the stone floor.

"Your Highness..."

Hearing the trembling calls from below, Li Zhouming seemed to snap out of a trance. He tossed his fan aside, stepped back, and waved his hands frantically. "My apologies for troubling Protector Ding!"

He stumbled back to his seat, looking dazed. No one dared approach him. Ding Weizeng nodded, the radiance of his immortal foundation faded, and his armor dissolved back into a simple Daoist robe as he silently retreated to a corner of the hall.

Li Xixuan, who had collapsed weakly to the floor, now became the focus of all attention. Mortified, he struggled back to a formal kneeling position, remaining silent.

The hall felt as if a violent storm had just passed, shattering the tense, aggressive atmosphere. Li Zhouluo kept his gaze lowered to the letter, but through the slit between his fingers, he watched the stunned Li Zhouming return to his seat. It was the same powdered, painted face as always, but Li Zhouluo felt his own eyes begin to sting.

'Good Fifth Brother...'

He had no time to dwell on it. A soft *thud* echoed in the hall.

Li Chenghao had dropped to his knees. He was one of the last remaining cultivators of the Chengming generation. His eyes were red-rimmed as he spoke, his voice heavy. "Chengpan is the youngest of his brothers. From the day he was brought from the lake periphery to the inner territories, I have guided him. The boy has been diligent since childhood, earning praise wherever he went. He served on the West Bank for years without a single complaint. Now, he suffers this sudden slander. If we cannot clear his name, where is the justice in this clan? Patriarch, I only ask that you summon our elder brother. If Chengpan is found to have the slightest stain on him... I am willing to share his punishment!"

His plea was heartfelt, making Li Zhouluo grip the letter tightly. He closed his eyes, his resolve wavering. He knew the truth: his father, Li Chenghuai, wasn't seriously injured. He *could* leave seclusion...

At that moment, Li Xuanxuan, who had sat motionless watching the entire drama unfold, finally spoke. The old man’s voice was dry and aged. "Li Chenghuai is in seclusion. He is not to be disturbed."

The old patriarch's single sentence silenced the hall. The petitioning elders froze. Li Zhouluo thought he heard a muffled sob. It seemed Li Chengpan, still kneeling in the center, had finally broken. The young man kept his head bowed, but his shoulders began to tremble.

The sound of weeping hammered at Li Zhouluo’s conscience, leaving him confused and conflicted. The letter in his hand suddenly felt impossibly heavy. "Regarding the West Bank," he announced, his voice low, "the Jade Court and Mount Qingdu will both dispatch personnel to investigate. Chen Donghe and Li Wen are ordered to the West Bank. Both peaks will conduct a joint interrogation. A final judgment will be rendered after."

"The situation remains unclear, but the families of the West Bank are in turmoil and require an answer. Ren Ting is stripped of his duties, effective immediately, and will be imprisoned in the dungeons of Mount Qingdu. Li Chengpan is guilty of negligent oversight; he will be returned to the main isle for interrogation."

Li Xuanxuan had blocked the path to summoning Li Chenghuai, and Li Zhouming had thrown the hall into chaos. Li Chenghao and Li Xixuan could only remain silent. They watched as Li Zhouluo folded the letter and declared calmly, "Li Hun accepted bribes and has confessed. Execute him."

Li Hun’s head snapped up, his face a mask of terror. Before he could scream, guards seized him. Li Zhouluo watched the man being dragged limply from the hall. "I apologize for troubling you elders today," he said. "Within ten days, this matter will have a definitive conclusion. I will inform you all then."

He could no longer bear the atmosphere. Rising quickly from the main seat, he bowed deeply to Li Xuanxuan and walked out without a backward glance. No one else moved; they avoided looking at Li Zhouming. Only after the wastrel finally left, taking Li Chengzhi with him, did half the assembly begin to disperse.

Li Chenghao, his expression grave, hurried after the escort taking Li Chengpan back to the main isle. Only outside the hall did he encounter the belated arrivals—the eldest and second brothers of the Zhou generation. He gave them a cold, silent stare. Embarrassed, the brothers explained softly, "Uncle... just now, we were summoned away by sister Xinghan..."

Li Chenghao was no fool; he understood their excuse perfectly. He suppressed his fury and stalked away, leaving the utterly humiliated Li Xixuan behind. As Li Xixuan turned to leave, a middle-aged man blocked his path.

This was Li Shuya, the brother of Li Que'wan. After losing his ship on the lake, he had remained by Li Xuanxuan’s side—a blessing in disguise. He bowed deeply. "My lord. The Old Master requests your presence."

Li Xixuan looked uncomfortable but followed Li Shuya to a side peak. He entered a small, immaculate courtyard where Li Xuanxuan was calmly preparing tea at a square table. Seeing the old master's peaceful expression, Li Xixuan relaxed slightly. He moved forward and knelt respectfully. "Grandfather."

The tea in Li Xuanxuan’s cup was scalding, hissing white steam. He set the cup down, raised one wrinkled hand, and carefully rolled back the sleeve on his other arm. He reached forward and slapped Li Xixuan hard across the face.

*Smack!*

The blow wasn't heavy, but it was shockingly loud. The pale, plump man instantly broke into a cold sweat. He dropped forward, pressing himself to the ground at the old master’s feet, not daring to utter a sound.
