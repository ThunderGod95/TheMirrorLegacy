# Chapter 1072: Falling to Earth

The Great Void trembled, the two colors of Azure Crow Qi interweaving.

The Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain had been utterly transformed ever since it became favored by the cultivators of Mount Dayang. Countless temples now clung to its slopes. The mountain's most famous peak, the one that jutted toward the sky like a razor-sharp blade, had been carved with innumerable Maha visages. They stared down from on high, gazing mercilessly upon the mortal world.

Countless monks in meditation robes stood on the mountain, palms pressed together in solemn, dignified prayer. Nearby, several enormous, golden figures were gathered, whispering amongst themselves.

"I heard... Yang Ruiyi has fought his way deep into Capital immortals territory..."

"Isn't Lord Vast Cicada there to stop him?"

The one who spoke was a white-skinned Merciful One the size of a house. Its face was ferocious, and its aura was profound. Another Merciful One beside it chuckled.

"You overestimate him, and you underestimate the Exiled Qi. I doubt he can be stopped."

"He might not even be trying to stop him!"

The figures whispered, clearly possessing some understanding of the situation, their voices tinged with lingering fear.

"Who would dare? Five-Eyed is still being boiled in that copper cauldron on Mount Dayang... Their determination this time cannot be underestimated!"

Just as they were muttering, the light in the sky suddenly dimmed. The Merciful One who had spoken looked up in horror, frozen in place.

The two-colored light of Azure Crow Qi roiled wantonly across the sky, tearing rifts into the blackness of the Great Void. A massive bronze imperial carriage drifted through the air, exuding a grim, deathly aura, as if attended by ten thousand ghosts.

This palace was no larger than any of the golden statues, yet its presence drained the color from the world and shook the hearts of all Buddhists. A black curtain was slowly drawn aside, and a man in dark robes descended the steps, gazing silently at the world below.

It was Yang Ruiyi, whose whereabouts had been unknown!

The man stood with his hands clasped, carefully sensing the fluctuations in the Great Void. He made a quick calculation with his fingers, and understanding dawned in his mind.

'The monks of Lotus Temple had followed their own master's treacherous path, refusing to serve Mount Dayang. That Zhang Yun is also a two-faced traitor, but he won't ruin things. It's all in the past.'

He didn't waste a moment. He led something out from the palace hall—a small, stumbling calf. It had no fur; its entire body was crafted from mud, yet it moved like a living creature, its legs trembling as it followed him.

'That Qi Lanyan is a petty, worthless coward, but he stumbled into some Heavenly Element opportunity. He knows how to read and copy the situation. But how could he know Heavenly Element's calculations are imprecise? Even Heavenly Element itself fell into the Exiled Qi. What can those wretches who received Heavenly Element's favor possibly accomplish?'

His brow lowered, his expression turning cold. He stepped out, planting himself firmly above the mountain range.

"Even if they understand, what power or will do they have to change anything!"

He abruptly released his grip on the rope. The mud calf immediately plummeted toward the mountains like a bird with broken wings, kicking up a furious gale as it fell.

The wind was a swirling, grayish-white mass, as if blown from a bottomless abyss. It was as heavy as snow, causing the Great Void itself to heave and rupture, tearing rifts that sent one or two Merciful Ones who had just stepped into it tumbling back out.

'It's over!'

A pale pink barrier of light instantly flared to life over the mountain—the sect's protective grand array!

But to the horror of the assembled cultivators, the small, dark object that fell from the sky met no resistance at all, drifting lazily downward.

The pink barrier was laughably fragile. To say it was like paper was an understatement; it was as if it didn't exist at all.

The way of Buddhist cultivators was to hide within their Buddhist Land to practice. They had neither the need nor the skill to establish defensive arrays. They had some research into formations for connecting to the Buddhist Land, but when it came to establishing a real defensive line, they were utterly clueless. How could they compare to the Daoist Traditions of immortal cultivators, who anchored divine abilities to protect their Purple Mansion Realms!

The group of Merciful Ones looked as if they had seen ghosts. Not one of them dared to intercept the calf. Instead, they scattered, fleeing desperately in all directions. But the Great Void was vast and cold, and a moment later, a single, crisp sound echoed in everyone's ears.

Dong!

A long, resonant moo echoed across the heavens. Where the mud calf landed, a spot of brownish-yellow light appeared, then instantly spread like a storm, enveloping the entire mountain range!

The revered images carved as reliefs into the mountainside rapidly blurred, crumbling into rolling avalanches of dirt. All the buildings transformed into yellowish-brown brick and mud. The Buddhist cultivators—whether they were running, kneeling, or wailing—froze in place. They turned into one mud statue after another, their forms quickly losing definition, before collapsing into piles of fertile soil.

Amidst the chaotic collapse, the white-skinned Merciful One felt the terrifying aura approaching from behind, its mind blank with confusion.

Whatever this falling spiritual creature was, it had locked him in place, unable to move, while simultaneously sealing off the Great Void. Although this power alone couldn't easily kill him, once Yang Ruiyi descended, he was surely dead.

The Merciful One remained frozen, its mind utterly blank.

'How can Yang Ruiyi be here?!'

'What right does he have to be here?!'

It truly couldn't comprehend the Song State's Grand General's actions. The Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain was indeed empty and undefended... but so what? Was he just here to vent his anger by killing the two or three Merciful Ones and the gaggle of low-level monks left to guard the mountain?

'All of Song's Daoist Masters are in Shanji. After he kills us, what then? The people from Western Shu are in Long. The Golden Feather Sect is leaning toward Shu, content to watch the tigers fight from a mountaintop. When the various Maha masters and even the Profound Governance cultivators rush back, what will he use to defend this place? By himself? Does he think he can rely on the likes of Li Ximing, who can be single-handedly stalled by Vast Cicada? In the end, won't he just have to retreat with nothing to show for it?'

'Is this really just to vent his anger?!'

RUMBLE!

It had no more time to think. The long-suffering spiritual mountain was trembling, slowly beginning to rise. Parts that were once low-lying swelled upward, forming new hills. The boundless Primordial Magnetism that had always flowed through the range stopped moving. The entire mountain dimmed as the Primordial Magnetism within every inch of the earth veins began to shudder. A torrent of energy surged, and streams of Metal Malice began to drill out from between the cracks in the stone.

The roiling Metal Malice rushed toward the sky, transforming into an ethereal white mist. Yang Ruiyi remained standing before the bronze carriage, his back to the infernal landscape of the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain.

The Grand General of Song did not descend to finish off the Merciful Ones trapped in the light of Proclaimation Earth. Instead, he stood quietly upon the palace, placed his hands on the bronze doors, and gave a gentle push.

"Creeaak..."

The ancient doors instantly swung open. The white mist floating in the air surged desperately into the main hall, forming a terrifying vortex. White dew condensed from the Metal Malice quickly trickled down the bronze of the palace. Yang Ruiyi stood silently in the doorway, his expression unreadable.

---

Moongaze Lake.

The sky was dim. A thick purple light lingered between heaven and earth, while indigo and azure flames rose into the air. The colors of Immeasurable Water and Fire swept across the sky, burning the exquisite pagoda above it until it creaked and groaned.

Li Ximing hovered in the air, his face pale. Faintly glowing, pale-gold wounds covered his body. The divine ability within him surged and ebbed like a tide, and a burning light shone from his hands.

He silently tightened his sleeve, coughed, and assessed the situation.

'Thank heavens for the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion...'

Although Tinglan had saved him from peril, the outcome was still deeply regrettable. When Vast Cicada sent out the White Cicada, he had been preparing for two eventualities. While Li Ximing was occupied, Vast Cicada's true body had already taken the opportunity to break through and escape from beneath the Huai River Map.

'If she had arrived just one stick of incense sooner... with the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion and the Huai River Map combined, we could have definitely suppressed Vast Cicada! Now, even Sima Yuanli can't hold on much longer...'

Even with this setback, and with Tinglan joining him, they were still at a disadvantage against this foe, despite possessing the Supreme Minister's Gourd and the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion. That pagoda was no ordinary item. The wounds it inflicted on Li Ximing's Dharma body clung to him like a festering disease. If not for his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body absorbing thirty percent of the damage, Li Ximing's predicament would be even worse.

This forced Li Ximing to wonder:

'How did Vast Cicada become so powerful?!'

Tinglan, however, showed no surprise. She silently raised the greyish-white Supreme Minister's Gourd, using Immeasurable Water and Fire to interfere with the light from the Buddhist Land. Seeing Li Ximing's uneasy expression, she said quickly:

"Zhaojing, be careful. Vast Cicada is the master of the Golden Land. He is not easy to deal with..."

Li Ximing endured the magical injuries wracking his body and shot her a questioning look. Tinglan gritted her teeth.

"He doesn't dare try to capture the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion itself. You be careful not to get captured by his spell arts..."

The two stood beneath the glow of the magical treasures. A gigantic human head hung in the air, its cavernous mouth gaping wide. The menacing White Cicada had already darted out of the mouth and was now clinging to the head's face, casting a massive shadow on the ground below. Its six white, segmented legs twitched, and its compound eyes gleamed.

Light streamed from the purple palace in the zenith. Five multicolored purple clouds of varying shades circled the palace before descending one by one. The White Cicada beat its wings several times, but the Purple Qi sapped its energy and suppressed its divine abilities, preventing it from rising.

This White Cicada was supposed to channel the Celestial Yang, but it was completely suppressed by the purple pavilion. It seemed utterly stifled. Beneath his own cicada wings, Vast Cicada's eyes grew dark and cold.

'The Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion... That's Tinglan, from the Purple Smoke Blessed Land...'

Vast Cicada knew of the pavilion's reputation. Most cultivators from the Purple Smoke Blessed Land were not skilled in combat, but back when this artifact was in Zimu's hands, it had suppressed legions of demons. It was a terrifying weapon!

'This woman isn't fit to be mentioned in the same breath as Zimu, but the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion was refined and sealed by Zimu personally. It's not what it once was. Who knows what hidden trumps it might still contain!'

His mood grew darker, turning to hateful resentment.

'Qing Jifang... all bluster and no backbone. All talk and no action. Mean, ungrateful, shameless, and quick to make empty promises. Touba Lan was right about him. How could he ever work up the nerve to attack the Song Kingdom? He must have let this woman through on purpose!'

Even knowing that Qing Jifang's words were always empty, Vast Cicada couldn't help but feel a sliver of disappointment. He mused silently:

'Is it... worth continuing this fight?'

The White Cicada restlessly twitched its scaled wings, revealing its master's hesitation. The fierce light in Vast Cicada's golden eyes intensified.

'The Precious Tusk Golden Land is with me. If I am absolutely determined to kill Li Ximing, I can do it by sacrificing the Golden Land. I'm even ninety percent certain of success... But the sacrifice would be too great. Not only would I lose the Precious Tusk, but the commotion would be enormous... and it would absolutely offend the Underworld.'

Vast Cicada understood. The South might not actually care about Li Ximing's life or death. But the conflict between North and South was in a fragile equilibrium. The consequence of sacrificing the Precious Tusk to eliminate Li Ximing wouldn't just be the death of an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator—it would be the fall of the entire Ting Province!

What made it even more difficult was the risk that Li Zhouwei might ignore his own injuries, emerge from seclusion early, and save Li Ximing. If that happened, all the sacrifices Vast Cicada made would be for nothing—he would have merely served as a sacrificial blade for others to test the waters. This was the true reason for his hesitation.

'Everyone in the Dharma Realm is just waiting for me to make a mistake. Is this move worth it? I may have seized the initiative, but I cannot sacrifice a Golden Land just to be someone else's pawn.'

His heart grew heavier. Before he could make a decision, he froze. He lifted his sleeve and saw a jade bracelet on his wrist glowing faintly. His heart pounded.

'The Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain?'

'How is that possible?!'

A chill shot through Vast Cicada's mind. He was horrified.

'This is bad!'

Vast Cicada was backed by the Great Adoration Dharma Realm—which was to say, Mount Dayang, currently involved in the Jiangbei affair. This was the only reason he could ignore Qi Lanyan's orders and head south on his own initiative.

Testing the Wei-fiend was in Mount Dayang's interest. Even if Yang Ruiyi tore Jiangbei apart and besieged the Profound Governance Pavilion, Mount Dayang would just watch the show, pretend to punish him, and then casually ensure his safety.

But with the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain in trouble, the ones watching the show would be the Profound Governance Pavilion and Qi Lanyan!

'How did he get to the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain?!'

Vast Cicada was from a Dharma Realm; how could he not know what kind of beings sat at the top of Mount Dayang? Those bastards were used to being masters of all. Even if heading south was an unspoken move that aligned with Mount Dayang's interests, if something happened to the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain, they would fly into a rage, play dumb, and goddammit, they would still throw him out to take the blame!

The enormous White Cicada immediately beat its wings. Vast Cicada's mountain-sized golden head roared, burning his own cultivation base. Golden blood sprayed from its mouth as multicolored light flared in the sky. Massive temples manifested one after another, smashing down toward the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion and the Audience with the Celestial Gate!

BOOM!

Tinglan's face paled. She flicked a hand seal, and the five beams of purple light from the pavilion converged, forcefully stabilizing the Spiritual Treasure. Li Ximing was in much worse shape. Blood trickled from his mouth, but his focus didn't waver for an instant. He immediately raised his hand and said in a low voice:

"He's trying to leave!"

Tinglan nodded, catching her breath. She turned aside.

"Don't try to stop him..."

In truth, Li Ximing no longer had the power to stop him anyway. The Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body in his sleeve was shaking violently; it had reached its limit. There was no real benefit in trying to hold Vast Cicada back, and he might even end up destroying his precious treasure.

He just swallowed the blood in his mouth, watching the multicolored light in the sky fade and vanish. He clenched his jaw, his heart lost in a daze.

'I wonder how much longer Moongaze Lake will remain a place they can come and go as they please...'

He drifted silently down from the pavilion. Sima Yuanli was already walking over, clutching his robes. Without the protection of the Huai River Map, he was struggling. Half his face was consumed by golden fire, revealing charred flesh and stark white bone. On his neck were six neat, round holes, hissing as they smoked.

Li Ximing clasped his hands in salute and took a spirit pill from his sleeve, offering it to him. Sima Yuanli quickly accepted it without a word, pouring water from a green gourd to carefully extinguish the flames on his face.

He managed to stabilize the injuries on his face, then gritted his teeth and said:

"I trust Zhaojing has not forgotten General Yang's instructions!"

Li Ximing was speechless. He stood in place for a brief second, then turned to look at Tinglan. The woman in purple robes was not surprised. She bowed to him, her expression complicated.

"Tinglan has also received orders. I am to accompany you north!"

Li Ximing was struck dumb.

"I can't believe the General is so confident as to leave the western front completely unguarded!"

Sima Yuanli shook his head and replied:

"Zhaojing, rest assured. The Grand General gave his word. The moment we saw Vast Cicada retreat, we were to head north. The master of the great desert is, after all, the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition. Western Shu will not dare to invade!"

Sima Yuanli clearly didn't know the full reasoning and hesitated even as he spoke. He urged in a low, anxious voice:

"This place has its own grand array! We cannot delay the opportunity in the north!"

Li Ximing wasn't actually reluctant to go north; he was just uneasy about leaving the lake undefended. But he had already given his promise, and the timing was critical. Furthermore, he had a measure of trust in the Yang family. He gave the command to activate the Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array. Watching the purple light rumble to life beneath his feet, he made his decision.

"Let's go!"
