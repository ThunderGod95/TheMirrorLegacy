# Chapter 613: Exiting the Grotto Heaven

Li Yuexiang kneeled at the front, overcome with sobs. Li Xijun stood silently in the courtyard, the Hanlin Sword at his waist emitting a faint glow. His eyes were rimmed with red, and his gaze lingered on the fragments of shattered jade scattered across the ground.

A flood of thoughts coursed through Li Xijun's mind, one after another, each slipping away before he could grasp them. Amidst the turmoil, the image of Li Xuanxuan's aged face surfaced vividly before his eyes.

The lamps within the ancestral hall flickered dimly. Li Yuexiang's quiet sobs echoed faintly in the still air as a gentle breeze drifted through the hall. Li Xijun's expression grew increasingly complex. He took a step back, then turned and exited the ancestral hall. Outside, the rain continued to fall, its steady rhythm pooling into streams at his feet.

Li Xijun rose into the air, carried by the wind, and landed before the Alchemy Pavilion. With his hands tucked into his sleeves, he stepped onto the stone stairs.

The courtyard was deserted and shrouded in shadows. The only light came from the furnace fire inside the grand hall, casting flickering shadows that danced across the floor. Inside, Li Ximing sat upright before the alchemy furnace, his hands forming seals as he focused intently. He lifted his gaze as Li Xijun entered.

Li Xijun waved a hand, saying nothing. He waited in silence until Li Ximing completed his pill refinement, extinguished the furnace, and tidied up his tools. Only then did he take a step forward.

"The life jade of Second Uncle has shattered," Li Xijun said softly.

Li Ximing, still immersed in his study of the alchemy formula, froze in an instant. He raised his head with disbelief etched across his face, his voice trembling as he cried out, "This… how… what happened?!"

Li Xijun covered his face with one hand and stepped back. As he departed, he heard Li Ximing's distraught voice behind him. Looking up slightly, he saw the lights on Talisman Peak flickering faintly in the distance.

Night had deepened, and Li Xuanxuan had not yet retired for rest. Li Xijun found himself almost unable to face the old man, unable to tell him that his last surviving son had also perished in service to the clan.

"Delay it for now… just delay it… perhaps there is still hope," Li Xijun murmured to himself.

Green Pine Island.

Compared to the controlled skirmishes in most areas of the grotto heaven, the fighting on Green Pine Island was chaotic and disorganized. Rogue cultivators clashed in a frenzied melee, killing and plundering one another.

Li Qinghong flew along the island's edge, wielding her spear. Her jade armor shimmered, deflecting the splattering blood, while violet lightning crackled around her, causing the seawater below to surge and rise as white mist.

The sea ahead churned violently. From the void, an object fell—a small, glossy black stone, no larger than a fingernail. It floated silently in the air, immediately drawing the attention of several cultivators.

Li Qinghong's spear erupted with lightning as she stepped forward decisively. With a sweeping motion, she forced back the surrounding cultivators, snatched the newly emerged spirit item, and swiftly stored it in her pouch before retreating.

Having recently advanced to mid-Foundation Establishment Realm, Li Qinghong's strength ranked among the top of the cultivators present. Her repeated successes had already attracted envious gazes. Sensing several individuals considering an alliance against her, she assessed her surroundings carefully.

Though unafraid, Li Qinghong understood the wisdom of withdrawing at the right moment. Guiding her lightning, she retreated steadily until she reached the edge of Green Pine Island's waters. Only then did the figures in the sky begin to thin out.

She had initially partnered with the Han Family of Dongliu Island, planning her moves carefully. Yet the winds of fate were ever-changing. As spiritual energy grew unstable and various spirit items emerged, the group was scattered in an instant, each person scrambling to seize treasures. Before long, she lost sight of the Han Family members.

This area, where the grotto heaven overlapped with the mundane world, was filled with peculiar gray clouds that hindered spiritual senses. Unable to locate the Han Family, Li Qinghong managed to rescue a few junior Han Family disciples within her reach, but after collecting a substantial haul of treasures, she quickly left.

The inability to coordinate with the Han Family was no great loss for Li Qinghong. Being stronger, she was confident in her ability to harvest rewards on her own with the help of her immortal mirror. Without needing to share the spoils, she even found herself enjoying the independence.

Adjusting her hair, she landed on a reef and immersed her spiritual sense into her mirror to assess her surroundings.

Before she could make sense of her environment, a flickering green light emerged from the void. It wavered erratically within her mirror's view before shedding its radiance to reveal an unassuming talisman seed that lingered faintly.

Li Qinghong's grip on her spear tightened, her knuckles turning white. She stood frozen in place for a long time before abruptly taking flight, heading toward the small island where Li Xuanfeng had entered the grotto heaven.

The island was barren, with no signs of life or traces of battle. Li Qinghong stood there briefly, wiping at the corners of her eyes as she thought to herself, If Brother is in trouble, Second Uncle likely isn't faring well either. I don't know what's happening in this grotto heaven, but it's best to wait here for him. If he's injured, I can at least provide some support...

As Li Yuanjiao died, his Immortal Foundation dissipated, and the power of the Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact swept forth. Li Yuanjiao's body gradually faded in Li Xuanfeng's hands, dissolving into rain that fell softly to the ground.

Li Xuanfeng found his hands empty, save for a longsword, a jade bottle, and a simple black-patterned storage pouch.

He attached these three items to his waist. Retrieving a jade box from the storage pouch, he murmured under his breath. The green rain in the sky immediately began to gather, pouring into the box and forming a pool of green-gray spirit water that swirled gently within.

The anomalies of the grotto heaven faded like a fleeting breath. The pale green rain lingered briefly before dissipating, leaving only the dispersing gray clouds.

It was common for a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator's body to return to the heavens and earth upon death. In Jiangnan, it was customary to use the remaining spirit items to represent the deceased in burial rites. Xiao Yongling stood silently nearby, hands clasped behind his back, watching as Li Xuanfeng carefully stowed the jade box.

The blood on Li Xuanfeng's hands had finally stopped flowing. He attached the Qingche Sword to his waist and stood still for a moment, lost in thought. Then, taking flight, he descended to a mountain ridge where Yu Muxian's corpse lay.

Yu Muxian, having perished from the slash, had his body shattered into two halves from the fall. Fine, sharp golden needles, like pine needles, seeped from his shattered meridians, scattering glittering fragments across the ground.

The once otherworldly face of Yu Muxian now resembled a fish carved apart by a thousand blades, exposing raw flesh beneath. His mutilated eyes, still slightly open, reflected lingering confusion. His bloodstained lips hung ajar.

Beside his wrist lay a small white jade buckle, smooth and pristine, untouched by the blood that stained everything else.

Yu Muxian's feathered robe, pierced twice during the battle, had been shredded to tatters. Within the remains of its sleeve lay a pale purple circular object—a hidden trump card that, even in death, he had never managed to use.

Li Xuanfeng waved his sleeve, gathering the shredded feathered robe along with the jade buckle. He then used his mana to retrieve Yu Muxian's storage pouch and probed it with his spiritual sense, finding it tightly sealed.

Removing the robe, Li Xuanfeng saw Yu Muxian's abdomen faintly rising and falling, streaked with blood.

Pop…

A muffled sound echoed from Yu Muxian's abdomen. As the Molten Metal Cave dissipated, several dharma artifacts flew out from his body one after another, bouncing into the pool of blood and wobbling slightly.

The artifacts ranged from the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm to Foundation Establishment Realm, none particularly outstanding. However, the six shields and eight golden shuttles stood out as a matched set of artifacts, making them exceptionally valuable.

From the distance came the sound of clanging metal as Tu Longjian, clad in black, descended slowly. The black-and-red token beside him was suppressing a golden ring, causing it to tremble violently in midair, glowing red-hot as it burned.

"Cloudsunder has slipped away. I have lost its trail," he murmured.

Li Xuanfeng's expression remained impassive as he handed over Yu Muxian's storage pouch, speaking in a hoarse voice, "Many thanks for your tireless assistance. Here is this man's storage pouch—it has not been opened."

Tu Longjian hesitated briefly before opening the storage pouch. The Six Ding Merging Fire rose from within as he casually wiped away the seals and traps on the pouch.

Still nursing the wound on his abdomen, Tu Longjian didn't hold back, taking out valuable medicinal pills and elixirs for himself. He also removed a few healing salves, which he applied to Li Xuanfeng's injuries.

Yu Muxian's possessions were indeed of high quality. Li Xuanfeng's wounds began to heal visibly, the torn flesh knitting itself back together. Although the injuries on his hands remained, they were far less ghastly than before.

Tu Longjian rummaged through the storage pouch, retrieving a jade box, which he kept for himself, along with several other items. He then returned the storage pouch to Li Xuanfeng, who handed it to Xiao Yongling, saying softly: "Thank you, Senior. Please take a few items as compensation."

Xiao Yongling looked at him silently before hesitating slightly. He picked up two artifacts from the ground before glancing through the storage pouch. Meanwhile, Tu Longjian remarked softly, "Senior, there is still something of yours in that golden ring."

Tu Longjian intensified the flames, and after a few breaths, the two Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifacts ceased their battle. The Binding Ring let out a puff of black smoke, spitting out a small golden orb.

Li Xuanfeng caught a glimpse of it and suddenly recalled that the first arrow he had fired had been absorbed by the golden ring. After being worn down by the spirit artifact, tempered by the Merging Fire and Molten Fire, and subjected to various spells, it had been refined into its current state.

Xiao Yongling reached out to catch it. Returning the storage pouch to Li Xuanfeng, he also took out a gleaming golden halberd and offered it with both hands, saying softly, "The halberd that Tang Shedu coveted… it is now returned to its rightful owner."

This halberd had originated in the ancient Wei State, and calling it a rightful return was not far-fetched. Li Xuanfeng accepted it on behalf of the Li Family, giving the storage pouch only a brief glance. He left its contents untouched but instead displayed a pale purple circular object and asked, "Is this a Purple Mansion Realm talisman?"

Seeing the two nod, Li Xuanfeng replied, "I hope to use this talisman to stabilize my clan's fortunes. I will take nothing else from this pouch."

Pushing the storage pouch forward, he added, "This pouch itself… is something I cannot keep."

The storage pouch was indeed a dangerous item to hold. Tu Longjian nodded slightly and said softly, "Leave it to me."

The group divided the artifacts and found a mountain peak to rest on, silently meditating as they waited for the grotto heaven to close.

Within the grotto heaven, there was no cycle of day and night. Li Xuanfeng and the others meditated for several days, each recovering somewhat before finally opening their eyes.

Although the three sat quietly atop the mountain, none of them appeared at ease. The development of events had clearly diverged from Tu Longjian's expectations, leaving him hesitant to speak. At last, a rumbling sound echoed across the heavens, and the clouds surged like tidal waves. Tu Longjian said, "Honored Seniors, I still have pressing matters to attend to and cannot accompany you to the boundary. Please forgive me."

Li Xuanfeng and Xiao Yongling understood that Tu Longjian leaving so openly would undoubtedly lead him to the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' hands. They bid him farewell nonetheless.

Tu Longjian hesitated for a moment before responding, "I deeply regret what happened to Senior Yuanjiao. If I manage to survive and establish myself in the Eastern Sea, I will rebuild the Slaughter Jun Gate. One day, I will come to visit and exchange techniques to revive the Slaughter Jun Dao Lineage."

Li Xuanfeng did not fully understand what connection his family had with the Slaughter Jun Gate, assuming this was Tu Longjian's reason for assisting them. Accepting the pledge on behalf of his family, he replied solemnly, "I am not clear on the details. Perhaps this was Yuanjiao's personal connection. However, the younger generation of my clan will remember your name and welcome you warmly."

Tu Longjian nodded, offered two words of condolence, and departed. Riding a fiery red streak of light, he vanished like a whirlwind into the horizon, sinking deep into the sea of clouds and disappearing from sight.

The two remaining figures rose into the air on the wind, only to find their surroundings gradually fading. The stars in the sky receded swiftly into the distance. Xiao Yongling waited for a moment before finally speaking softly, "My condolences…"

Li Xuanfeng waved a hand, the grief in his eyes flickering for only a moment before being replaced by deep restraint. Xiao Yongling observed his face carefully and spoke quietly, "Back during the slaughter in Lixia Prefecture, you and Ruyu pursued and executed members of the Situ Family in the name of justice. It all feels like yesterday. Decades have passed, and you seem so much different now."

Li Xuanfeng lowered his gaze and replied, "What happened back then is like a bronze mirror sinking into water, dulled and worn down by sand and stone. Even if I revisit it, it remains hazy and unclear. Thinking of it now feels like recalling a past life—impossible to relive."

Xiao Yongling paused, unsure of how to respond. After a moment, he said softly, "Back then, I thought you were too sharp, that Ruyu was bound to be hurt by your brilliance. I even considered mentioning it to Tongya. But looking at you now, it is clear you surpassed Ruyu in every way. It seems I underestimated you and made a fool of myself."

Li Xuanfeng shook his head deeply, uninterested in continuing the conversation. Just as he was about to respond with some polite remarks, Xiao Yongling suddenly vanished. From head to toe, he disappeared completely, as did the stars, clouds, and mountains, which all faded away into the distance.

"The grotto heaven is closing!" Li Xuanfeng raised his gaze, finding himself surrounded entirely by the deep blue sea.

Beneath him were the same island and rocky shore from when he first entered. The formation he had set up at the beginning still glimmered faintly. Nearby, Lin Chensheng stood in black robes, clutching his chest. Crimson blood dripped steadily from between his fingers.

On the other side, Kan Ziyu collapsed to the ground with a thud. Sitting cross-legged, she immediately began meditating to recover. Li Xuanfeng scanned the island with his spiritual sense but found no trace of Zhong Qian. He surmised that Zhong Qian had likely met a grim fate—if not within the grotto heaven, then perhaps already in the hands of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

Although Zhong Qian was absent, Li Xuanfeng saw a familiar figure nearby. Dressed in jade armor and holding a spear, her eyes rimmed with red, Li Qinghong stood there, staring intently at his hands.

"Qinghong!" Li Xuanfeng called out.

Li Qinghong nodded firmly, her throat tight with emotion. Uncertain of the situation, she dared not say much and choked out a brief response. Li Xuanfeng, having killed Yu Muxian, had no desire to linger. Bowing slightly with a cupped fist toward Lin Chensheng, he ascended on the wind and sped toward the marketplace on Splitreed Island.

As he took flight, Li Xuanfeng suddenly froze. The great void before him split open, trembling violently. From the rift stepped a man clad in platinum armor, his familiar halberd pointing directly at Li Xuanfeng. Behind the man stood an elder clad in green robes.

The elder's hair was white as a crane's feathers, yet his face was youthful. His nose was high and straight, and his eyes were etched with golden patterns. Behind him, a long, slender object rested silently. Standing in midair, the elder radiated a quiet but commanding presence. Beside him, a golden short sword hovered, buzzing sharply with its tip aimed directly at Li Xuanfeng.

The sword vibrated with a ringing hum, as though identifying its target. In the elder's other hand was a familiar golden ring, spinning slowly as it emitted a faint, whooshing sound, almost as if it were aggrieved.

Tang Shedu's aura was weak, his armor battered and fragmented, and his halberd bore two deep scars. His face, pale as gold paper, was far more haggard than when he had fled. In a hoarse voice, he said, "Daoist Master, it is him!"
