# Chapter 972: The Disturbance

The assembled Purple Mansion experts reined in their divine abilities, sending streams of figures descending into the Mystic Realm in sequence. Li Ximing feigned humility and held back, but his spiritual sense had already drifted through the realm like a crisp wind sweeping over a mountain pass.

It was impossible to claim that the Purple Mansion cultivators had no way to scout ahead. Although this Mystic Realm was like a chessboard, one that couldn't be understood without personally playing, some among them still had their methods. Whether through high Dao-Profundity in the divinatory arts, potent Life Divine Abilities, or unique Spiritual Artifacts, they could, after all, make some calculations.

But no matter what they calculated, how could any of it compare to his Spirit Probe?

Li Ximing's thoughts raced. He sent his sense directly toward the main, orthodox-looking great hall. He paid no mind to the 'Great Purple Light Formation' or its 'profound spiritual patterns,' simply unraveling their complexities and seeing everything clearly.

He saw that Southern Township Hall was bare of tables or chairs. In the center stood nine massive bronze cauldrons, swirling with a heavy, turbid purple light. He couldn't identify the Daoist tradition, but the style and appearance were remarkably similar to those he had seen in the Great Ning Palace long ago.

Cauldrons like these would ultimately be divided among the major families, so they weren't the most important prize. His attention went to the high seat at the head of the hall. It was adorned with glittering gemstones and churning mercury-like liquid. It seemed someone had achieved liberation here, passing away in meditation. A dharma robe floated near the seat, and hidden within its folds was a brilliantly shining, purple-glowing orb.

'That must be a Spiritual Artifact,' Li Ximing thought. 'From the look of it, the quality is exceptional. I wonder if it might even be a Spiritual Treasure...'

His own Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger was, to put it generously, barely mid-grade; it couldn't possibly compare. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd was a special case. With its Bright Yang nature of scorning the weak, its true power depended heavily on its wielder. He privately estimated that while it was a step below Xiukui's trump card, the high-grade Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword, it could still overwhelm the Spiritual Artifacts of many other Daoist Masters.

In ancient times, Grotto-Heavens were plentiful. The great cultivators of various Dao Lineages often collaborated, using these Grotto-Heavens as a foundation to construct Mystic Realms, just like this Southern Township Hall. Setting aside the potential harvests within the Grotto-Heaven itself, just being able to take a large bite out of a Mystic Realm like this was a significant gain. On a smaller scale, later cultivators with less power would create minor halls and chambers attached to the periphery of such realms, but those were hardly worth mentioning.

He silently memorized the location. Finding an unoccupied spot, he locked onto two or three smaller palace halls, his spiritual sense sweeping over them with incredible speed. Finally, just as nearly everyone else had sent their disciples in, he found a pavilion of considerable value and managed to send his group inside.

This place appeared to be a repository belonging to the Southern Township Dao Lineage, used for cultivating spiritual resources. The upper level was sealed by a small formation that used several Foundation Establishment Realm-grade spiritual items to nourish the resources within. Although most of the items had long since dried up, the resources inside the formation still pulsed with a purple light, a clear sign that a harvest was waiting.

He discreetly gave his juniors their instructions and pointed them in the right direction. He had intended to withdraw his wondrous sense, but as his gaze swept the area, he suddenly noticed a man from the Golden Feather Sect. The moment this person landed in the Mystic Realm, he immediately bid farewell to his disciple-brothers. Without the slightest hesitation or pretense, he made a beeline for the most valuable cache of spiritual items in the vicinity. It was Su Yan.

This made Li Ximing pull back his gaze, and he glanced inadvertently at Tianhuo, who stood beside him, seemingly lost in thought.

'The Golden Feather Sect... Su Yan inherited the legacy of the Chen Clan from Lingyu Gate. That settles it. The Chen Clan of Lingyu Gate is indisputably from the old Ning State... which means he has a profound connection to both the Ning State and... Wanling Heaven!'

Seeing this, how could Li Ximing not understand? He sighed inwardly but was filled with admiration. 'Truly, one move calculated three steps ahead. All that talk about wanting the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture, all that effort to secure the Lingyu Gate inheritance... The Golden Feather Sect must have known for ages that Wanling Heaven would eventually face this day. Their real objective was always inside this Grotto-Heaven's Mystic Realm!'

After all, what did the historical records say? The Sima, Su, Xi, and Xiao families... all met at Jiangbei. Following the lead of the Li and Jiang, they founded the Great Ning State. And among those founding families was the surname _Su_!

Tianhuo merely smiled, saying nothing. Li Ximing couldn't help but feel a pang of pity for him.

'So, the Golden Feather Sect's original plan involved my Li family. But something changed, the plan was abandoned, and after years of struggle, Su Yan finally emerged. But by then, far too much time had passed... According to their original timeline, they probably expected to be entering this place with a Purple Mansion Realm expert who had already mastered the Great River and Grand Mound Scripture!'

As he was lost in thought, clashes already echoed from within the Mystic Realm. Suddenly, a plume of white qi swept in from the west, transforming as it moved. Li Ximing clearly saw Tianque's expression darken as he turned his cold gaze toward it. The white qi solidified before them, revealing a single figure.

The man stood atop a black, flowing stream of light. He had clear, handsome features, and his Daoist robes were simple and unadorned. He held a single, hazy grey orb in his hand. The divine abilities coalescing around him revealed he was, surprisingly, a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

He grinned broadly. "Daoist friends, it has been a long time! Your divine abilities have certainly progressed!"

Tianhuo hadn't experienced a significant breakthrough in his divine abilities for decades, whereas this man had clearly reached the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm some time ago. The comment was undeniably laced with sarcasm, earning a cold sneer from Tianhuo.

"So, it's Daoist Friend Qing. You seem quite at ease these days. Your thoughts must be clear and unobstructed... no wonder you broke through."

Hearing the surname Qing, Li Ximing knew he had to be a Daoist Master from Mount Changhuai. Sure enough, the man chuckled, then turned his head to face Li Ximing.

"I am Qing Jifang of the Changhuai Dao, Daoist name Ziwu. You must be Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing had absolutely no good impression of this man. Whether from rumors or from his own elder's account of meeting him when Yuansu died, he was thoroughly unlikable. But the Changhuai Dao was powerful. Li Ximing replied with a cool, detached tone:

"I have long heard of your great name."

Qing Jifang merely smiled, his expression unreadable. "I, too, have heard of Daoist Friend Li's name," he said casually. "But why do I not see your family's White Qilin?"

His gaze drifted past Li Ximing's face, his tone full of playful mockery. Li Ximing knew the man was arrogant and certainly looked down on him, likely only viewing someone like Li Zhouwei as an equal. Sneering inwardly, Li Ximing replied:

"Minghuang is currently in seclusion and has no time to accompany everyone... I must say, I've heard of the recent unrest in the Wu State. I'm surprised to see you so carefree, Daoist friend."

Qing Jifang sneered. A young man in grey-blue robes quickly stepped forward, looking rather exasperated as he tried to smooth things over. "It is merely a small disturbance, not worth mentioning."

Having interjected, the young man smiled.

"I am Qing Zhuo, Daoist name Guanlan. A pleasure to meet you, Daoist friend."

Li Ximing nodded in acknowledgment, just as Qing Jifang spoke again with a laugh:

"I've heard you are on excellent terms with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, which is quite fortunate. And yet, I see you've visited countless sects and schools, but you seem to have skipped over my Mount Changhuai. Instead, you've been a very diligent visitor to Sun-Worshipping Mountain. I can't quite puzzle out the reason for that!"

Qize was, at least nominally, under the jurisdiction of Mount Changhuai. And Sun-Worshipping Mountain was famous for its connections to the various Supreme Yang Daoist traditions. Qing Jifang did have a point, if he truly wanted to press the issue. But Li Ximing couldn't be bothered to wrangle with him.

"It was a personal matter arranged by Daoist Master Xiukui, to help him refine some medicinal pills. He was the one who sought me out at the lake. If any offense was given, I must trouble you to take it up with the Great Xiukui Monastery."

The Daoist Master of the Great Xiukui Monastery was currently in seclusion, so there was no one to ask and no way to verify the story. As Li Ximing finished, Tianhuo suddenly laughed out loud.

"Qing Jifang, what business is this of yours? I've also been to Sun-Worshipping Mountain. I've even been to see the Tomb-Seizing Sword Immortal! So what?"

The Daoist Master from Mount Changhuai shot Li Ximing a glance, then turned back to Tianhuo. "Tianhuo, I won't waste any more words on you. We'll settle this when we reach the 'North-Garden Hall'. This is just a warning, to save you from bringing trouble upon yourself!"

The two parties separated on bad terms. Li Ximing's expression remained serene, but a shadow crossed his thoughts. He calmly changed the subject. "Why isn't Daoist Friend Qinghu here?"

Si Yuanli may have only broken through recently, but as a Purple Mansion cultivator from Azure Pond, he certainly had the right to be here. In response to Li Ximing's question, Daoist Master Tianhuo replied in a leisurely tone:

"It's not convenient for him to show his face right now. The Si family was also an important noble family in the Ning State. Of the many Ning State families from back then, the only ones still holding influence are all sheltered under the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. One is his Si family, and the other is the Xi family of the Chunyi Dao Gate."

"Those two families definitely have a much deeper understanding of this Grotto-Heaven. They will certainly come, but they won't do so openly. After all, everyone is greedy. They can't guarantee someone won't secretly follow them or use some other trick..." He chuckled. "They'll wait until the Grotto-Heaven fully descends, then slip in quietly. They'll rely on their private knowledge and bloodline to take a healthy slice of the pie. They won't risk the greater good for a small gain!"

Li Ximing now understood Si Yuanli's absence. He nodded to himself. Seated in the Great Void, he closed his eyes and focused, simultaneously advancing his cultivation while casually observing the unfolding events below. After an unknown amount of time, a series of dull, heavy booms finally echoed from the purple expanse of the Mystic Realm.

The destructive power of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators was nothing to scoff at. With so many cultivators from both north and south gathered in one place, all fighting one another, the Mystic Realm was already a chaotic wreck despite its size. He raised an eyebrow and looked. It seemed some cultivators had already reached the front of Southern Township Hall.

He heard Tianhuo spit beside him. "Damned luck..."

It turned out the first group to arrive was from Mount Changhuai. Wielding a compass, they had been breaking seals and dismantling formations ever since they entered, enjoying an almost unimpeded path to the main hall. The treasure in their hands was clearly powerful. Even Su Yan, and Ding Weizeng—who had received pointers from Li Ximing—were several steps behind and had yet to reach it.

The main hall of Southern Township Hall involved the Mystic Realm's core, and was too strong for Foundation Establishment cultivators to breach. But Qing Jifang and the others looked calm, clearly prepared. As expected, their disciples below began to take out talismans.

_Boom!_

The purple light pulsed violently with the explosion. Streaks of light from all directions were drawn to the commotion, converging on the hall. The fighting intensified, a kaleidoscope of lights from different Dao Lineages flashing in the fray. Almost all the Purple Mansion experts had opened their eyes to watch the scene unfold.

Li Ximing raised his hand slightly, first extracting the injured Chen Yang and Li Wushao. Neither had a particularly high cultivation base or profound foundation, but luckily, each was more cunning than the last. Despite their injuries, they had managed to survive until the end. Chen Yang had even managed to snag an ancient dharma artifact: a Valley Water Dharma-Bead.

Next was Li Jianglong. He had been terribly unlucky, chased all the way by several Buddhist cultivators. Though he had grabbed his share of treasures, he was gradually forced into a dead end and was soon pulled from the Mystic Realm. Despite the frustration on his face, he silently rode the wind back down.

The battle in the main hall grew fiercer. The great cauldrons vibrated from the impacts. Pills streaked with black and gold light shot into the air, met by a storm of colliding abilities. Ding Weizeng, wielding his connected long-and-short staff with ferocious momentum, even drew a look of surprise from Tianhuo, who explained:

"So it's the Nangong Xuan-Sui Pill! No wonder it was being nurtured in an 'Ancient Azure Apothecary Cauldron'..."

Li Ximing's own attainment in the Dao of Alchemy was considerable, and he had also obtained the Secret Enclosure Dao Lineage, so he instantly recognized this famous spiritual pill, which was on par with the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill.

'The Nangong Xuan-Sui Pill...' he thought, delighted. 'It can enhance divine abilities and open a "Profound Palace" within the body to advance one's cultivation. It's compatible with countless techniques, as it belongs to the Pure Qi path—suitable for all methods.'

'Even better, the Profound Palace it creates isn't just for cultivation; it can temporarily absorb and store all kinds of Baleful Fire Qi, Baleful Demonic Qi, or even store a divine ability. Once a cultivator is finished with it, the stored power can either be digested in one go, or the "palace" can be expelled from the body and used as a one-time-use talisman. While useless to a Purple Mansion expert, it's an incredible life-saving item for a junior.'

Tianhuo shook his head with a trace of emotion. "The Nanxiang Dao Lineage back in the day... you couldn't afford to provoke their disciples, all because of this pill. Those old monsters would cultivate and expel these 'palaces' day after day, giving one to every junior they favored... How many cultivators of the same level would ever dare to provoke them?"

Li Ximing was extremely interested and nodded silently. The various experts in the Great Void watched the battle below as if it were a stage play. Some even took out tea and wine, sipping leisurely.

Li Ximing's gaze swept the crowd, and he couldn't help but chuckle. That fellow Li Jiangxia was also in the mix, fishing in troubled waters. He wasn't fighting for treasures or resources; instead, he was using his immortal foundation to deliver resounding blows to the Buddhist cultivators. With Ding Weizeng running interference for him, and the Buddhist cultivators themselves being disorganized, the other cultivators were more than happy to let him sow chaos and paid him no mind.

When the dust finally settled, the Spiritual Artifact ended up in the hands of the Viewing Pavilion. The apothecary cauldron was taken by the Mount Changhuai group. No major conflicts erupted, and no family went out of its way to make trouble. But as for what each group had actually managed to pocket, only they themselves knew.

Li Ximing, quite satisfied, pulled his two disciples out of the realm. Standing beside him in the Great Void, Ding Weizeng looked battered but triumphant.

"Well done!" Li Ximing praised.

Ding Weizeng wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and quickly presented the two pills he had secured. He then took out a separate jade box and handed it to Li Ximing, earning a satisfied nod from the Daoist Master. Naturally, the other miscellaneous spoils were not for his master's inspection.

But beside him, Li Jiangxia laughed. "Hold on."

This third young master had always been sharp. Compared to his brothers, he was more daring and more willing to take risks. He, too, had managed to secretly stash a jade bottle in his robes.

"Excellent!"

Li Ximing praised them again, his spiritual sense sweeping over their gains. Ding Weizeng's two pills were indeed the Nangong Xuan-Sui Pills. Li Jiangxia's bottle, taken from a Buddhist cultivator, contained an unnamed spiritual pill of the Gathering Wood path. The jade box from Ding Weizeng, which Li Ximing had guided him to using Spirit Probe, contained exactly what he had expected: a Purple Mansion-grade spiritual resource. It was a wisp of 'Heart-Taste Baleful Qi', and a resource of the Merging Fire path at that.

To have gained so much from a single Mystic Realm, Li Ximing couldn't help but smile. Beside him, Tianhuo was clearly just as pleased. "A fine harvest, Daoist friend! Congratulations!"

"And to you," Li Ximing replied with a smile.

'It truly takes a grand event like the fall of a Grotto-Heaven,' he mused. 'Otherwise, how long would it take to find even a single spiritual resource of this caliber?'

Just then, all the Purple Mansion experts looked up. Within the Great Void, streams of multicolored light appeared. From the four cardinal directions, four golden halls descended from the sky. They fell like collapsing towers, crashing heavily into the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter. The impact sent the masses of rogue cultivators into a frenzy. They swarmed toward the new structures like ants, heedless of the danger.

'Just some of the minor halls and chambers that were attached to Southern Township Hall,' Li Ximing identified them.

The contents of these minor halls were nothing compared to Southern Township Hall and were almost useless to Purple Mansion experts. Li Ximing wasn't interested and casually sent his two juniors down. Tianhuo did the same with his Golden Feather disciples, instructing, "Just go take a look. Save your energy for the Mystic Realms to come!"

Li Ximing's mind, however, was already elsewhere. He smiled and probed Tianhuo,

"I wonder how many more opportunities like this our juniors will have..."

Tianhuo shot him a glance and chuckled. "My elders said there should be two or three more Mystic Realms... The next one won't fall for at least half a year, so we still have time."

'I'm here buying time for Li Zhouwei. If there are two or three more realms, that should give him at least another year or so...' Li Ximing calculated silently, breathing an inward sigh of relief. His mind settled, he closed his eyes and returned to his meditation.
