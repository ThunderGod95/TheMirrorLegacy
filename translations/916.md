# Chapter 916: The Viewing Pavilion Faction

At Zhouda's words, the group voiced their agreement. Zhouluo, however, flung back his black robes, his hand dropping to his sword hilt. He strode forward, quickening his pace by several steps, and was soon the first to arrive back at the lake. Beside him, Pang Yunqing turned to console him.

"People often misspeak... It probably wasn't aimed at anyone in particular."

In his distress, Zhoufang had said that besides Li Minggong, no brother cared for Li Chenghao. It was a veiled barb, clearly pointing at Li Chenghuai for leaving to cultivate, ignoring his family's affairs. How could Zhouluo not understand the implication?

It wasn't that Zhouluo had forgotten the grudges of the past; he simply chose not to speak of them. But for Zhoufang to bring it up now... Zhouluo held his tongue, seeing how overwhelmed by grief the other man was, but he was inwardly furious.
'His decision to venture out was approved by the family elders! It was settled. I knew the others felt it was unfair, and some were jealous, but I never thought even Big Brother would be so blind!'

'What did he mean by that? Is he saying my father didn't go to the Tangdao Mountain Range, that he doesn't care if Li Chenghao lives or dies? Father is in seclusion, breaking through to a new realm! When something like this happens so suddenly, what chance does he have to get involved?'

Pang Yunqing hailed from the long-esteemed Bamboo Creek Pang Clan. As a genius from the direct line of such an ancient family, her perspective was broad. She merely soothed him, "In this day and age, even the bonds between parents and children are weak. Once you're removed by three generations, how many can truly be called 'brothers'? What he said was improper. Don't take it to heart."

"Hah! It's not that simple... The Li Clan and the Pang Clan are different..."

Zhouluo just shook his head. After a moment's hesitation, he replied, "Actually, thinking about it now, only Fifth Brother is truly... likable. His aptitude made reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm a huge struggle. Nothing can happen to him..."

The two continued toward the mountain. Pang Yunqing shook her head with a smile.

"Very different, indeed. I'd only ever heard he was a henpecked wastrel. From your lips, he sounds 'likable'."

They soon landed at the foot of a mountain covered in gardenias. The two politely asked for someone to announce them. After passing respectfully through the woods, they were met by a brilliant golden radiance. A figure was seated on the main throne above.

The man was draped in scaled armor and wore black boots, leaning back slightly in his chair. His golden eyes were profound. A long halberd with a curved shaft rested across his knees, one hand stroking its length. His palm held a bright, shining light, as if he were nurturing the dharma artifact.

To his side stood Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan, whispering about something.

Zhouluo immediately bowed low, his voice respectful.

"Zhouluo pays his respects to the Daoist Master!"

Even Li Xizhi had to bow and address Li Ximing as 'Daoist Master'. What's more, Zhouluo and Zhouwei were merely clan brothers who hadn't been close since childhood. Naturally, he no longer dared to call him 'Big Brother'.

Zhouluo was brave enough to risk a glance upward, but Pang Yunqing at his side didn't dare lift her head at all. She simply bowed with him, waiting until the man on the throne relaxed his brow and spoke.

"Fourth Brother has returned. There's no need for such ceremony."

"We heard the Daoist Master has achieved his divine ability. I brought Yunqing to pay our respects to you, brother."

Zhouluo quickly replied. Zhouwei nodded, listening to the commotion below as the crowd surged forward. The first among them was Zhoufang, his face streaked with tears. He knelt on the mountainside and offered congratulations.

"Congratulations, Daoist Master! Felicitations, Daoist Master!"

Zhouwei relaxed his grip, and the halberd in his hands vanished. Seeing Zhoufang's state, he helped him up and spoke softly.

"Uncle Chenghao's children both perished in service to the clan, and now he too has fallen in battle. The matter of his lineage... the first branch will handle it internally. The clan will provide compensation. Fei Qing'yi deserted his post, causing Uncle's death. He colluded with the Demonic Buddhists and has already been sent to the Supreme Yang for judgment. The others involved have been sent to Tiger's Frontier... There will be news soon."

After these words, Zhoufang could only remain kneeling, weeping as he gave his thanks.

"My gratitude to the Daoist Master... The Fei Clan deserves death! And we have a blood feud with the Buddhists of Xiaoshi Mountain..."

At the mention of the northern Buddhists, a cold light flashed in Zhouwei's eyes. He said only, "That is a matter of course."

Zhoufang immediately kowtowed, weeping, then clasped his hands and departed to handle the funeral affairs. Zhouwei silently scanned the crowd. He saw expressions of unease and sorrow on all sides; no one dared to speak. Whether it was Chen Yang or An Xuanxin, everyone had their heads bowed in silence. Cui Jueyin, as usual, showed no expression. The other guest elders and protectors all looked worried.

Only Zhouda was grinding his teeth, seething with a rage so palpable it seemed to crackle. Sparks of Profound Thunder flashed in his eyes as he cursed under his breath, "Damned bald-heads!"

Zhouwei turned and sat back down, listening as Zhouluo spoke in a low voice.

"Daoist Master, your achievement would traditionally be marked with a banquet. But now..."

"There's no need."

It wasn't just that the cultivators of Jiangnan were in no mood for feasting; Zhouwei himself had no inclination for it. If he were the *first* to reach the Purple Mansion Realm, a banquet would be unavoidable. But the Li Clan was already an Immortal Clan of the Purple Mansion Realm; there was no need for excessive fanfare. Zhouwei's voice was grave.

"The north has fallen. The riverbank must be fortified. You are all to deploy personnel and keep a close watch on the north. As for the matter of Cold Cloud Peak..."

He paused, and Li Jiangqian immediately picked up.

"It has been arranged. The Manor Peak will be re-established, and we will dispatch personnel there as appropriate."

At this declaration, Zhouwei's gaze slowly lifted, sweeping across the faces of the An and Chen clan members. He raised a hand.

"You are dismissed."

The crowd dispersed in an orderly fashion, becoming a bustling stream of lights beyond the mountain. Li Jiangqian's expression turned cold. Li Que'wan murmured:

"The fall of the Tangdao Mountain Range was a huge blow, and Fei Qing'yi set a terrible precedent. It's inevitable they... feel uneasy. After all, if the Buddhist cultivators reach Sanxi, what's to stop another Fei Qing'yi from emerging?"

The Li Clan hadn't established a new Manor Peak in many years. In the past, such news would have been met with cheers. A new position meant a new piece of the pie to be claimed. This was precisely why the various families had been so eager to kick the Fei Clan while it was down, fanning the flames of their downfall.

But now the Fei Clan was gone, the Tangdao Mountain Range had fallen, and Baijiang Creek was in the hands of the Buddhist cultivators. The north bank had suddenly become a hot potato. While a full-scale invasion from the north was unlikely, skirmishes and friction were unavoidable. Hearing this, the gathered families and clan branches instantly deflated.

Li Jiangqian's expression was icy. "Exactly. They were the ones who coveted the northern posts so much they wanted to grind the Fei Clan to dust. And now, they're the ones too timid and hesitant to make a move. First, they're afraid of losing their lives in battle. Second... they're probably worried that they, or their descendants, will end up just like Fei Qing'yi."

"These vassal families have deep roots and many relatives, so they share that unease. As for the guest elders... many have no children, perhaps just a wife and a concubine here by the lake, a few relatives and assets. They have far less to worry about..."

"And this is the result of us *severely* punishing the Fei Clan. If we had only executed the ringleaders that day, they would all be celebrating right now, thinking they'd still have an escape route if they went north!"

Even Li Que'wan could see the situation clearly, let alone someone like Li Jiangqian, who always assumed the worst and had zero trust in his subordinates.
How could Zhouwei not know? His golden eyes were filled with gravity. He slowly turned a jade cup on the table.
"The An and Chen clans are not the Fei Clan. Even if the situation rots, even if someone defects to the north, we cannot touch them. The other families... they are insignificant. No need to worry."

Seeing him state the matter so bluntly, both Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan fell silent.

The Chen and An clans had been pillars of the family for generations, deeply intertwined with the four main branches. The Li Clan rarely married outsiders; most unions were within the lake's families. Of the old vassal families, only the Chen Clan, and later the An Clan, had endured, becoming inseparable. This was partly due to their own elders remaining alive, but the most important factor was their consistent production of geniuses and spiritually-gifted children, binding them firmly to the Li bloodline.

To put it bluntly, even if Chen Yang himself was converted by the Buddhist cultivators, what could the lake's leadership really do? His mother was Li Xicheng's sister, and Li Jianglong had to call him 'Uncle'! Li Jiangqian's own mother was an An. What could he say except remain silent?

As for Li Que'wan, faced with such a sensitive topic, she was even more inclined to protect herself. There were already whispers around the lake questioning her humble origins. On a normal day of secluded cultivation, it didn't matter, but saying even one word now would surely stir up gossip.

Zhouwei watched them in their silence, took a sip of tea, and said calmly, "As long as you understand, I don't need to say more. The Fei Clan could be punished severely. The remaining families can only be placated. The situation is not yet clear. We will wait and see the north's next move."

"You may go."

The two acknowledged and withdrew. Zhouwei rose, his expression darkening slightly. He took a single step into the Great Void and reappeared at the lake's edge, gazing into the distance.

He saw a waterfall of brilliant light on the horizon as dark energies dissipated. Streaks of golden light shot through the air. A sheet of Heavenly Light pressed in from the distance, passed through the array, and landed on the mountain. It brought with it a purple shadow, which resolved into a man in deep blue Daoist robes, carrying a long, glowing sword. He approached with a smile.

It was, unexpectedly, Li Ximing and Yehui, arriving together.

When Yehui saw Zhouwei, his eyes held a trace of shock. He clasped his hands.

"I have long heard of your great name!"

This was a meeting no one could have predicted. But with Buddhist cultivators on the shores of Baijiang Creek, even mortal enemies would instantly become sworn brothers. This was to say nothing of the ambiguous relationship between their two factions over the years, and the fact that Yehui had just done them a favor.

Zhouwei replied amicably, "Greetings, Senior Yehui."

Years ago, when Zhouwei had sent Guan Gongxiao fleeing, Yehui had been stony-faced. Now, showing no embarrassment whatsoever, he looked at Zhouwei with delight, offering rounds of congratulations. He sat down nearby and smiled. "You are a first-rate talent... I knew it long ago. Now that you've reached the Purple Mansion Realm, you are a powerful ally to us!"

Zhouwei offered a polite reply, then turned an questioning gaze to Li Ximing. Li Ximing immediately shook his head, his expression grim. "The decision has been made to abandon the Tangdao Mountain Range. It was only ever established with array disks; it can't even create a true restricted zone. And since they don't dare disturb the earth veins, it's unlikely to cause them much trouble."

Yehui sat to the side. When Li Ximing finished, he spoke in a somber tone. "We must discuss the current situation. I have connections in the north and have received some news. Let's talk."

"First: although the northern forces have not yet taken the Tangdao Mountain Range, the Grand Preceptor of Zhao State—Wei Xuanyin, the current master of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao—has been urgently recalled to the north to report to the Zhao Emperor. For his merit, he has been ennobled as King Han."

He paused, his eyes filled with deep meaning, before explaining. "This Wei Xuanyin represents the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao and cultivates the 'Veiled Yin'. He once shone brilliantly during the Great Liang dynasty and was inextricably linked with the 'Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect' of the Lesser Yang Dao. Together, they were known as the Viewing Pavilion faction. I've heard that the Demon Monarch of legend... came from that very Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect!"

Li Ximing's brow furrowed slightly, his pupils dilating. Hearing that name, a chill went down his spine.

'Viewing the Pavilion? *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire*?!'

All Daoist traditions have an origin. The moment 'Viewing Pavilion' was mentioned, how could Li Ximing not recognize it! He had obtained the *Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire* from Daoist Master Changxi, and it had benefited him immensely. This was the Daoist tradition of the Profound Peak Gate! Kui Qi himself had once confirmed it was a Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition!

This meant the Viewing Pavilion faction had to be of the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition. And with a single thought, it connected all the way back to the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch of the Great Liang! Was the world-famous 'Sundering of the Lesser Yang' merely a conflict between Immortals and Demons? How much of it was driven by a brutal clash between Daoist traditions? The Immortal Yingze of the Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had sent down an Immortal decree, delivering it openly to the Liang Emperor, True Monarch Touba Xuantan. Then, he had captured the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch, Kuaili—the leader of the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition's Viewing Pavilion faction—and split him into three before all the world's cultivators, so that all under heaven would remember!
At that time, what had been the attitude of Mount Luoxia?

The event had shaken the world. To this day, after countless Daoist traditions had been extinguished and countless secret arts silenced, the names of the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch Kuaili and the mainland's Supreme Yang Daoist tradition remained renowned, the latter proudly suppressing the western highlands year after year.

And now, Wei Xuanyin, the master of the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition's Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao, had struck, shattering the Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition in its moment of crisis... What was this if not the wheel of time turning, vengeance for an ancient grievance! And how urgent must the recall have been, to prevent him from finishing this cycle of revenge.

Li Ximing raised his eyebrows and looked at Zhouwei. The golden-eyed young man's expression was calm, but as their gazes met, a silent understanding passed between them.

Yehui, however, seemed unaffected, as if his previous words had been a mere aside. He continued gravely, "The one replacing him is a Buddhist General, Maha Fachang of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. He has reincarnated five times and has been ordered to take control of the Jiangbei region."

At this, Li Ximing was silent for a moment. Zhouwei spoke softly, "Defeating the southern Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is a major victory. The Buddhist cultivators would definitely want to claim it for themselves. Recalling Wei Xuanyin is no surprise. But... the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and the Way of Compassion have always been at odds. How can they work together?"

"Their usual tactics," Yehui scoffed. "When have any of the Buddhist factions ever gotten along? Don't be fooled just because the Way of Emptiness acts subserviently before the Way of Great Desire. Given the chance, Zhelu would love to murder every last follower of the Way of Great Desire!"

He took a sip of tea. "Senior Lou Xing struck down Vija of the Way of Great Desire. We don't know if Vija perished, but Zhelu must have been overjoyed. Especially since that manifested Maha from the Sea of Desire, Liangli, cannot come south. Without supervision, Zhelu immediately became active, his ill intentions toward the Way of Great Desire growing... Don't think that just because Senior Lou Xing is a sword immortal, his mind is simple. His mind is crystal clear. That one sword strike hit them exactly where it hurts! Otherwise, why would the Way of Compassion so easily step in to mediate, forcing Wei Xuanyin to take action?"

Although Yehui himself walked a line between righteous and deviant, he clearly held great admiration for a grand sword immortal like Lou Xing, making no effort to hide the praise in his tone. He now let out a sneer but didn't elaborate, continuing, "We cultivators in Jiangbei have received news from the north. King Bolie of Qi, Gao Fu, will soon travel to Chengshui Marsh to visit Changyun. As for what they will discuss... that is harder to say."

Li Ximing sipped his tea. "Not the Lotus Temple? But the Gao family, from even further north..."

"The Lotus Temple?" Yehui sneered. "When all the Daoist traditions pushed north together, the Lotus Temple was quiet as a quail. They're lucky they aren't being punished, let alone having the ambition to push south. Maha Jinlian has been 'invited' to the Great Yang Mountain Dharma Assembly and has no chance of returning. Believe it or not, Fachang's position was originally meant for the Lotus Temple. Otherwise, why would the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, which has never had *any* involvement in southern affairs, suddenly have a Maha drop from the sky?"

"From what my friends in the north say, those high-level figures who stand on the pillars of heaven and earth have reached a rare consensus. Jiangbei *must* fall into northern hands, whether in name or in actual control. In this process, who drags their feet, who plays tricks, and who gives their all—everything is being clearly recorded. This is no longer a stage for everyone to act on their own!"
