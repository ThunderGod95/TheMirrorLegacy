# Chapter 1162: The Sword of Pear Blossoms

'Lingmei.'

'A Great Daoist Master of the Sword Gate, a Sword Immortal of Dui Metal.'

Of the Three Profoundities, Azure Profoundity was renowned for its Sword Intent. After years of strife between north and south, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition of Azure Profoundity had come to occupy Jiangnan, and in that time, sword immortals had become a common sight. From Hengzhu in the far south to the Yue Cultivating Sect in the far north, masters of the sword had emerged one after another.

The sword immortals who walked out of these Dao Lineages were formidable, their divine abilities and dharma power second to none. The one who had ascended to the realm of Jade True was beyond mention, but even the less talented sword immortal from the Great Xiukui Monastery had required a personal disciple of a True Monarch to suppress him.

The Sword Gate, however, was an anomaly. Though it boasted more sword immortals than any other sect in Jiangnan, it had precious few cultivators even at the Purple Mansion Realm.

Perhaps their reverence for the Dao had allowed this unique tradition to produce more sword immortals. But in turn, their unwavering adherence to Sword Intent placed even stricter moral demands on them. Everyone chased after Sword Intent, and the geniuses who emerged would foolishly seek it before pursuing divine abilities, wasting their prime years. This only exacerbated the decline in the number of powerful cultivators. Ever since Cheng Liuxing and his disciples had fallen, the light of the Sword Gate had dimmed drastically. Even the sudden appearance of a Great Daoist Master named Xing Ying years ago could not reverse their decline.

And a Dui Metal Sword Immortal at the level of a Great Daoist Master was rarer still.

No matter how prepared he was, the terrifying might that surged forth the instant that streak of autumn yellow appeared sent a chill down Qi Lanyan’s spine, and understanding dawned.

'This Dui Metal Sword Immortal’s power rivals anyone in Jiangnan or Jianghuai. He’s closing in on Lou Xing!'

That sword-like gaze flashed over him for only a moment, but Qi Lanyan felt a frigid wind tear at him. A blinding white light filled his vision. He barely had time to raise his sword, a single thought consuming his mind.

'So fast.'

It was often said that Upright Wood was as unyielding as metal. This technique-sword, which channeled the nature of Upright Wood, borrowed from both water and fire, and emulated the virtue of Metal, appeared unassuming. In truth, it was incredibly durable and sharp, no weaker than a typical spiritual sword. Qi Lanyan had used this very blade to outmaneuver countless opponents.

But his opponent today was also one of righteousness—the Dui Metal, the very essence of righteousness among all metals.

_Clang!_

The streak of white light flashed past in the blink of an eye, but it lacked the graceful elegance of the Celestial Moon Sword. Instead, it contained a vast, unshakable righteousness of pure yang.

_Boom!_

As the white light faded from Qi Lanyan’s pupils, a line of crimson had already appeared on his neck. It crept up to his chin in an instant, tracing a path past his lips before vanishing near the corner of his eye.

_Thump!_

As if countless leaves were drifting to the ground, the youth took a step back, his figure reappearing dozens of feet away. His pupils were wide. The bloodstain from a moment ago seemed like a phantom, yet his expression turned grim.

The technique-sword was still in his hand, but its luster was gone, now dull and lifeless. An inch-long, crack-like pattern of brilliant white now marred its surface.

A sudden dread seized the youth’s heart.

'Martial Uncle…'

Wang Ziya was right there in Xuanmiao Temple, yet he hadn’t made a move. His Martial Uncle’s mission was to contain the south; there was no reason for him to go back on his word. His failure to appear could only mean one thing.

'Exiled Qi!'

The dense black clouds blanketing the sky began to churn like a tempest. It was as if a great beast was trampling through the murky depths of a lake, stirring up monstrous waves. Faintly, one could even hear the tremors of the great hall of the Underworld.

'Yang Ruiyi… he definitely set a trap!'

His own sudden scheme had forced Yang Ruiyi’s hand, even driving a wedge between the Yang and Li families and making the great general take the blame. How could Yang Ruiyi not be furious? He was bound to plot against him.

A chill washed over Qi Lanyan’s mind. In the instant he retreated, he had already flicked his sleeve.

'Verdant Grove!'

A pale green illusion bloomed out from him, waves of trees and forests rippling into existence. A dense jungle crashed down, drowning the surrounding scenery. At last, he saw the source of the white light.

It was a profound sword, pure white from hilt to tip, adorned with faint golden patterns resembling pear blossoms on cracked ice.

And it was almost upon him.

Qi Lanyan’s face changed. A brilliant radiance erupted from his palms, two beads of ink-black energy materializing within them. He clapped his hands together before him, his words a desperate, hurried chant.

“Let Dharma reside in the Valley Water!”

An inky blackness instantly climbed his hands. His figure had just begun to rise and vanish when the sword light, like a falling star, smashed into the empty space where he had been, striking him from the air.

_Boom!_

A torrent of Valley Water cascaded in all directions, only to be cleaved in two by the impossibly sharp sword qi. The youth fell from the air once more, a trickle of blood at his lips. A vast Sword Intent coiled around him, carving countless tiny cuts across his face.

Yet Qi Lanyan showed no fear or anger. His expression relaxed. The purple silk sash tied at his waist was now clutched in his hand. It began to grow at an astonishing rate, becoming like layers of purple mist that finally locked onto the pear wood sword.

But in a flash, a cold, snow-white energy flowed down the blade.

'Present Departs Old.'

The pear wood sword vanished. Beneath the layers of purple silk, only a golden sword-mark remained, throbbing like a living thing. The sword itself had already withdrawn and was now aimed directly between Qi Lanyan’s brows.

'Present Departs Old.'

'What a masterful "Present Departs Old"!'

Qi Lanyan had no time to ponder how perfectly the Underworld had chosen this technique for Lingmei. The pear blossom sword was already thundering toward him. He had no choice but to tilt his head back, take a deep breath, and spit out a stream of azure light.

The moment this light appeared, the very heavens and earth seemed to change color. An endless wind rose, blowing from east to west in a brilliant display. The man’s figure rose with the wind, dissipating like smoke.

'Ushering Spring’s Dawn.'

This divine ability was completely different from his previous ones. It was less like wood and more like wind, a shifting, uneven azure that not only lifted Qi Lanyan’s body but also sent a tremor through the cultivators to the north, shrouding the area in a faint haze.

But the man in white only took a single step. His second divine ability flared to life, a field of autumn white like snow, drifting gently toward them.

The white appeared without warning, yet it felt entirely natural. It seemed to blanket the entire sky, yet it was also filled with infinite gaps. The gale that Qi Lanyan had become swirled and spun but could not escape. Instead, it was continuously torn apart within those razor-sharp voids, its power rapidly diminishing.

'Sovereign of Dui Edge!'

Qi Lanyan had clearly anticipated this divine ability. His face was like ice as a clear light enveloped him, and a profound aura that nothing could disturb rose from his body. He slipped free, and the profound drum finally rose into the air. In his hand, however, was a small, golden stick, which he slammed down hard upon the drum's surface. A golden ring of light rippled outward.

His vision was filled with Wu Light!

The autumn-hued world created by Sovereign of Dui Edge seemed to have met its nemesis. Like snow under a scorching sun, it melted away, viciously pushed back by the golden light. The divine ability was instantly broken. The sword-mark under the purple silk froze, and even the winds of spring stirred by Qi Lanyan’s Ushering Spring’s Dawn died down. The pear blossom sword retracted its edge and returned to its master's hand.

Across the whole of Lake Xian, all divine abilities stagnated, almost simultaneously fading. Even the Exiled Qi in the sky trembled, revealing a sliver of light from within.

This was the light of Wu Earth, hailed as Flawless.

Qi Lanyan, momentarily free, was overjoyed. He shot into the air, a small, white jade pearl already appearing in his palm. He was just about to chant an incantation when all the light before him dispersed, and from within the Wu Light, the tip of a halberd appeared.

Li Zhouwei!

'Touba Ci… that bastard!'

With the sword immortal intercepting him and Zhelu hiding in a corner of the battlefield to tie up loose ends, the one responsible for stopping Li Zhouwei was naturally Touba Ci. For Li Zhouwei to suddenly appear here could only mean that Touba Ci had failed.

Rage flared in the youth’s heart like a leaping flame. But nearby, Touba Ci was even more helpless, his heart filled with frustration.

'His Huai River Map is suppressing my Profound Seal. Without a way to restrain him, between his Crimson Severing Arrowhead and his Sovereign's Perilous Tread, if he was determined to break through, who could possibly stop him?'

The thought vanished in an instant. Touba Ci whipped his head around and saw a middle-aged man with a sword on his back standing before him. The man’s face was steady, and his body was protected by the same peerlessly sharp Dui Metal Qi as the sword immortal. Touba Ci raised an eyebrow in thought.

'Sword Gate… Cheng Jiuwen.'

Qi Lanyan, however, had no chance to show his anger. He could only watch as the halberd, shimmering with a whitish light, came at him. The King of Wei’s aura was overwhelming, his divine might limitless. For a moment, Qi Lanyan was frozen in place.

He had just used his ultimate trump card, the Flawless Wu Light of Subjugation!

'Was it Sovereign's Perilous Tread?'

Qi Lanyan’s mind went blank.

'How is that possible?'

Although Li Zhouwei was charging him with that very divine ability, and its power to return things to their proper course was certainly at work, Qi Lanyan knew full well that its might was not infinite. In this day and age, it was impossible for the Wu Light to be within its restorative range.

'Then… why?'

He had no time to think. The purple silk in his hands flew out, each end wrapping around one of his palms. The once-soft fabric now surged with a purple-gold light, becoming as hard as cast iron.

_Clang!_

But the long halberd, gleaming with a pearly white sheen, was deceptively light. It shattered against the iron-like silk as if it were glass. A more brilliant golden light, like a coiling dragon, shot past the silk and straight toward the space between Qi Lanyan’s brows.

While Cheng Xunzhi had been battling Qi Lanyan, Li Zhouwei had used Touba Ci to stack the Bright King technique on top of Grand Ascension. Now, empowered by this divine marvel, the power of First Strike was unleashed.

The energy of Binding Light, long since accumulated, coordinated with it, casting a white brilliance that locked Qi Lanyan in place.

This disciple of Guanhua had a profound Dao-Profundity and was covered in treasures, but the Great Daoist Master of Dui Metal had already pushed him to the brink. His divine abilities were in disarray and his senses were failing. He was utterly trapped.

A flicker of hesitation crossed his pupils as that familiar murderous intent of Dui Metal washed over him. He gritted his teeth, closed his eyes, and connected with the jade talisman in his sleeve.

_Crack!_

His Daoist robes activated on their own to protect him, forming layer upon layer of barriers that cracked and splintered before the golden blade. The halberd’s advance slowed as if moving through thick mud, but it pushed forward relentlessly, finally piercing his brow.

But a light flared on the youth’s chest, revealing a cyan jade gemstone. The gem’s power activated, its nature incredibly close to Upright Wood, making his entire body as hard as metal and locking away all damage. Qi Lanyan’s body suddenly shattered, turning into a rolling gale of verdant wind. His heart seized with cold terror as the jade talisman in his sleeve broke, and the bright white light of Veiled Yin finally rose.

Cheng Xunzhi was appearing right behind him.

The sword immortal’s divine ability responded, transforming into a series of golden-white profound patterns that twisted and tangled, converging on a single point to form a shattered, diamond shape.

'Palace of Retracted Killing.'

Sixteen golden-white blades of varying sizes materialized, their sharp points and long edges spinning, all aimed at one spot. The gale of verdant wind was thrown into chaos, and all light grew heavy. The youth was immediately forced out of his wind form.

The pear blossom sword would give him no more time to react. The white-gold light on it intensified to its absolute peak.

'Unending Edge.'

The Sword of Pure Yang Qi, Establishing Yang and Controlling Bitterness!

With Li Zhouwei buying him time, the Great Daoist Master of Dui Metal, empowered by four divine abilities, had ample opportunity to unleash his Sword Intent. The entire world went dark, all color and light condensing onto that single blade. The light screen generated by the Guanhua disciple’s life-saving talisman instantly solidified, then, as if struck by something terrifying, it caved inward.

_Crack…_

White light scattered as the barrier shattered violently.

The Sword Intent still held power. The long blade tore through the air like a blade through silk. As light flashed, Qi Lanyan’s black Daoist robes flew, the colors seeming to shift wildly before the Sword Intent passed right through them.

The sword of Dui Metal had finally pierced the dharma body protected by a Spiritual Treasure.

_Pfft._

The color drained from Qi Lanyan’s face. His entire body was nearly sliced in two at the waist, held together by only a sliver of skin and flesh. The purple silk whipped around his waist with lightning speed. The sword immortal’s gaze was cold as he reversed his grip and slashed back.

This strike was as vast as mountains and rivers. It came crashing down, only to vanish into thin air right in front of Qi Lanyan.

The colors in the sky above had faded. The long-bearded Daoist Master retracted a green stone tablet now covered in sword marks. A hint of anger touched his usually placid eyes as he gave the gourd in his hand a slight shake.

In an instant, lightning fell and flames raged, erupting from nothing to encircle Qi Lanyan. Wang Ziya then turned the mouth of the gourd and said in a low voice,

“Fellow Daoist Cheng! This humble Daoist has been waiting for you for a long time!”

At his call, a heavy purple light poured from the gourd’s mouth, like a dim and hazy world. Cheng Xunzhi focused his gaze on it, his expression slowly turning grave.

In that brief moment, Qi Lanyan forced down the blood in his throat. The purple silk was already tied around his waist, wrapped several times and knotted tight. The unique power of Upright Wood responded, doing its best to contain the Sword Intent.

His hands did not stop. He held the technique-sword in one, while the other formed a two-fingered sword seal, pressing it against the blade’s spine.

“By my decree!”

The technique-sword flared with golden light, locking onto the long halberd flying out from the raging flames. Qi Lanyan’s face paled slightly as the deep halberd-wound between his brows began to rapidly close.

'Trying to suppress me while I'm down? Naive!'

The Dao Lineage he, Qi Lanyan, cultivated was Horn Wood, which excelled at healing. It wasn’t particularly renowned for combat, but as a divine ability of Wood Virtue, it made him the least susceptible to injury. The Upright Wood Spiritual Treasure on his chest contained its own wonders that complemented his arts. When wood flourishes, it becomes unyielding; his inner stores were indestructible.

The sword wound looked grievous, but his protective talisman from the Guanhua Daoist tradition and his enchanted robes had already nullified seventy to eighty percent of the damage. With the Spiritual Treasure on his person locking the wound, his injuries were not severe.

His only regret was that the Sword Intent was terrifying. The Marvelous Purple Silk of the Profound Immortal Treasure had to be used to suppress his injuries and could not be used for anything else.

There wasn't a trace of panic in his eyes, only calm and cold focus. He spun the technique-sword, and it stuck to the long halberd like a persistent specter. His voice was icy.

“The nuisance is finally gone… Your Highness.”

But no response came from the flames. The force behind the halberd grew more and more terrifying, making his technique-sword tremble. The protective lightning and fire Wang Ziya had summoned for him began to fade, revealing the scene on the other side.

The golden shaft of the halberd was held in a man’s hand. The raging black flames were reflected in Qi Lanyan’s eyes, making his pupils widen.

Behind Li Zhouwei were six arms of black flame, each holding a treasure.

One held a Gilt Treasure Plate with mysterious white markings, mirroring another that brandished a Divine Mace of Profound Thunder with a marvelous purple-gold blade, which flashed with heavenly light and rumbled with thunder. One grasped the Radiant Sun King's Halberd, gleaming with deep golden light, opposite another that clutched the Honored Banner of Ting Province, crimson-purple on a field of black, its presence heavy and solid, seeming to tower over the Great Void. One brandished the Pure Yang Bracelets of the Imperial Wei, facing another that held the Huai River Map of a once-loyal True Monarch. Brightness Culminating in Splendor, a magnificent Dao extremity.

The light in the Guanhua disciple’s eyes wavered. He heard Li Zhouwei’s voice—it was the first time he had ever heard the King of Wei speak. The tone was cold and magnetic.

“Fellow Daoist Qi.”

The sky had already grown dark, the setting sun crouching on the horizon like a monstrous beast. Two thick arms covered in white scales held the White-Forged Rekindled King halberd, its crescent blade having locked Qi Lanyan’s technique-sword in place.

The King of Wei’s armor was a sleek, smooth black-gold. His face was hidden by a helm, leaving only thick black flames and a pair of cold, golden eyes submerged in darkness.

“Do not be like Vast Cicada.”
