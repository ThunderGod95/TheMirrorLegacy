# Chapter 955: Treasured Armor

Li Ximing’s words stuck in his throat for a long time, while Xiao Yuansi simply continued to look at him. The old man rested his hand on his shoulder and was lost in thought.

Xiao Yuansi understood clearly that once he left this place, and once Li Ximing entered seclusion, the next time he came to the Li Family would almost certainly be for Li Ximing’s funeral. Attaining divine abilities wasn’t difficult for those in major sects, but for Li Ximing right now... it was not an ideal choice.

To attain divine abilities is to transcend the mundane.

When Li Ximing finally spoke through choked breaths, he sighed softly in his heart. He had exhausted every possible effort to see Li Ximing again.

Xiao Yuansi had noticed that his family’s ancestor hadn’t stopped him from gathering Bright Yang spirit items, but he didn’t believe it meant genuine support from his family's Daoist Master. He didn’t trust him at all. He feared that Li Ximing would have already been forced into seclusion by the time the pill was finished. Xiao Chuting was exactly the kind of man who would do such a thing.

So, he had deliberately disrupted the timeline, even going so far as to injure himself just to finish the refinement early and personally deliver the pill. Xiao Yuansi had treated this meeting as his final farewell. As for Li Ximing successfully reaching the Purple Mansion Realm... he never truly dared hope for it.

Ming’er’s temperament is far too much like that of a mortal! Xiao Yuansi gazed at him deeply and thought, Those throughout history who have attained divine abilities were either pure-hearted and resolute, cunning and ruthless, or so introspective that even grief could not sway them... But Ming’er? When frightened, he panics. When angered, he lashes out. He speaks of the merciless Dao, yet is swayed by family and friends. In detachment, he can sever ties, but upon reflection, he feels pain and regret. When nothing stirs his heart, he hesitates. It is only when the pain becomes real does he realize what ruthlessness means... Of all the sons of the Li Family, he is the most like an ordinary man.

To forge a divine ability, one must pierce the qi sea and ascend through Yang. Endless illusions and countless inner demons will await along the way. What will he rely on to get through them?

Xiao Yuansi looked at him in silence. Li Ximing stood beside the table, exhaled softly, and finally spoke without words of thanks, “Master, you deliberately kept this pill from Daoist Master Xiao. What concern lies behind that?”

Xiao Yuansi hadn’t expected that question. He slowly raised his brows and answered softly, “My family’s Daoist Master... is only doing what he believes is best for your family.”

“I understand,” said Ximing.

Li Ximing stood quietly at his side and said softly, “Daoist Master Xiao wishes for me to leave this pill for the heir. I can guess that and I can see it clearly. Master, rest assured, my family holds the Daoist Master in the highest regard. We have not misunderstood his intentions.”

Xiao Yuansi was not an ambitious man. With the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator Xiao Chuting above him, he was content to spend his remaining years quietly refining pills. He had no reason to stop this disciple of his, and could only offer him this single pill as a parting gift.

When he heard Li Ximing’s words, he finally showed a trace of surprise. After a long silence, he said softly, “You may handle what I've given you as you see fit.”

He coughed twice and finally rose to his feet. Li Ximing respectfully escorted him all the way out. Along the way, Xiao Yuansi looked back at him three or four times, and to his own surprise, a faint glimmer of hope rose in his heart, If he can gather himself and cut his losses... that would be the best outcome.

Li Ximing saw him off and then rode the wind back to Mount Wu. He did not inform Li Xuanxuan about the pill. Instead, he quietly sat down amid the mountain’s drifting white mists.

He took out the jade bottle, but didn’t open it immediately. His spiritual sense pierced through the bottle and landed on the Radiant Violet Pill within. The pill radiated a powerful Bright Yang qi. Its qi was pure and radiant. Li Ximing could detect no flaws within it.

“Though my means of inspection are a joke compared to Xiao Chuting’s... and all Dao lineages stem from the Xiao Family anyway, leaving little I can uncover... Master still made a point to mention Xiao Chuting...”

Li Ximing would never doubt Xiao Yuansi, and Xiao Chuting had no reason to harm him either. Yet Xiao Yuansi's earlier words clearly showed concern about Xiao Chuting. It wasn’t hard for Li Ximing to arrive at this conclusion, It’s just that Xiao Chuting would prefer Zhouwei to be the one attempting to reach the Purple Mansion Realm.

He sat in silence amid the mist, thoughts drifting through his mind, Xiao Chuting’s intentions are good... I suppose the Profound Peak Gate and Kong Tingyun have passed on word as well. All eyes are now fixed on Zhouwei.

It’s not just Xiao Chuting... Every Purple Mansion Realm cultivator friendly to my family hopes that Zhouwei will be the one to challenge the Purple Mansion Realm—not someone like me, whom they see as hopeless.

The rest of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators... they’re probably just waiting, eager to watch me fail.

He gave a soft, self-deprecating laugh, then drew out a pale golden jade slip from his sleeve. Forming a hand seal, he activated his mana to begin cultivating the next secret technique.

Jewel Steps!

————

Kong Tingyun escorted them all the way to the lake, smiling as she saw the group off. Li Qinghong offered a few polite words of thanks, but since Kong Tingyun was in a hurry to return to her gate, she courteously declined the Li Family’s invitation and took her leave with a polite farewell.

After hesitating several times, she tugged on Li Qinghong’s sleeve before leaving and gave a reminder, “Qinghong, you must pay close attention to what I mentioned earlier... Don’t be careless!”

She was, of course, referring to Li Ximing. Li Qinghong could only nod in agreement. Only then did Kong Tingyun smile in relief and depart aboard her spirit boat.

Back on the island, Li Chengliao came to greet them, grinning from ear to ear as he grabbed his eldest son’s hand and examined him closely. Li Zhouwei hadn’t seen his father in a long time. Though he was never one for sweet words, a rare trace of joy surfaced in his eyes.

Chen Yang had changed into white robes and went to the lakeside to pay respects to his father. Li Zhouwei paid his respects to Li Xijun on the island. Kongheng stood in silence by the grave, sighing. Once they returned to the main hall, the space suddenly felt empty.

When the white ape saw Li Zhouwei, his expression faintly echoed the kindly one he once had in years past. His demeanor remained respectful, and he immediately bowed. The group entered the hall together, and Li Chengliao began recounting recent events.

“Senior Yuansi is truly a kind and gracious elder... He came all this way to offer his regards. Daoist Master Xiao has been in the Northern Sea for years now and hasn’t appeared. Even his family hasn’t been able to contact him... yet Xiao Yuansi still made a point to speak with Ximing.”

Li Xuanxuan was deeply grateful. He remembered clearly how many times Xiao Yuansi had lent a hand to support their family. He chimed in with a few more words, fearing the younger generation might bear resentment toward the Xiao Family for not acting publicly on their behalf.

Li Qinghong and the others, of course, wouldn’t do such a thing. They all responded kindly and respectfully. Li Xuanxuan then waved his hand, and both the white ape and Li Chengliao took their leave. The great hall doors closed, and the protective formation began to hum softly.

Still uneasy, Li Qinghong tossed out the Chongming Profound Insight Screen from her sleeve. A screen of light enveloped the hall, adding another layer of protection.

Only then did Li Zhouwei speak, “How have the talisman seeds fared in the two years I’ve been away?”

Li Xuanxuan gently shook his head. “Not as well as we’d hoped... We tested the Celestial Whirl generation three times and only you showed this kind of celestial affinity. As for the Crimson Palace generation...”

The old man stroked his beard and continued softly, “It’s just now beginning to take shape. Jiangqian is barely five, yet already the eldest among the first batch of the Crimson Palace generation. We’ll let him give it a try.”

Li Zhouwei nodded. Talisman seeds had become increasingly rare in recent years, and the cultivation methods attached to them were even more advanced. Most generations now had only a single bearer. He had met several of his brothers; while their innate abilities were slightly better than those of the Radiant Lure generation, the difference wasn’t substantial.

In the past, when the Immortal Mirror still manifested in the world, one could probe it with spiritual sense and clearly determine the number of talisman seeds inside. But the mirror hadn’t appeared in decades. No one had seen it, and now one had to rely on incantations just to invoke it, let alone inspect talisman seeds directly...

Li Xuanxuan seemed a little troubled by this and said quietly, “Using such treasures as vessels is all well and good... but there are already so few who bear the talismans. If something ever happens and the line is suddenly severed, with none of the younger generation having received a seed, wouldn’t that mean we’ve lost the connection entirely...”

After mulling it over for a moment, he chose not to say more.

Li Zhouwei then asked, “How is Jiangqian?”

The moment this was brought up, Li Xuanxuan became visibly spirited and chuckled softly, “The child is bright and quick to learn. He’s already earned great favor from your father!”

“Oh?” Li Zhouwei still remembered the exchange with Dingjiao in the Dragon Palace and pondered silently, If what Dingjiao implied is true... then both the eldest and second sons of Bright Yang are out of the ordinary. I’ve already seen what Jiang’ao is like, so Jiangqian must be remarkable as well.

Dingjiao might not have been sincere with him, and his instructions might not reflect his true intentions, but the clues hidden in their conversation were still worth taking into account.

So he asked, “Besides that, has there been anything unusual?”

Li Xuanxuan paused briefly, then furrowed his brow, “He’s just a five-year-old child; it's hard to say much. His eyes are starting to show a hint of red within the gold... but that’s nothing serious.”

“Alright...” Li Zhouwei nodded slightly, seeming to understand. He passed over the basket of pearls.

Li Qinghong took out several jade slips, unfurling them one by one and saying softly, “Minghuang, these are the Bright Yang techniques and spell arts collected by the family. Take a look.”

Li Zhouwei relaxed his brow and picked up the jade slips from the table, reading through them one by one, Second-grade technique: Clarity of Sight and Heart Technique, Immortal Foundation: Bright and Clear Heart.

Third-grade escape spell: Flowing Sun Refraction.

Third-grade technique: Bright Origin Observation and Separation Technique, Immortal Foundation: Everbright Platform.

Fourth-grade spell art: Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light.

Li Zhouwei gave a word of thanks, then put away Flowing Sun Refraction and Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. He skimmed through Bright Origin Observation and Separation Technique and handed it back to Li Qinghong, saying softly, “I’ve troubled the seniors.”

“Don’t mention it.” Li Qinghong gave a gentle nod and exchanged a glance with Li Xuanxuan before saying softly, “Minghuang, there is one more matter.”

She rose from her seat and walked across the hall, forming a hand seal to resonate with the formation. She then retrieved a brocade pouch from within. Standing before them, she gently shook it, and drew a large jade box from it.

The jade box was as large as a tabletop and didn’t seem particularly extraordinary in material. Guided by mana, it floated lightly to the ground. Li Zhouwei made a rough guess in his heart, and sure enough, Li Qinghong said, “Years ago, my second uncle shot down Murong Wu and took a profound iron treasure armor from him . It's a top-tier Foundation Establishment Realm armor. It was then brought back and reforged over nearly three months using True Flame atop Mount Bianyan.

“Once it was completed, Ning Heyuan delivered it to my second uncle, who had it quietly returned and stored away here. It has remained unopened ever since.”

Mana flowed along her slender fingers as she tapped the jade box nine times. The box opened on its own with a metallic clang, revealing the treasure within.

Li Zhouwei focused and saw a gleaming field of gold-white fine scales. There were no intricate patterns, just layer upon layer of overlapping plates with a supple texture—it was a suit of soft armor!

He lifted it gently, surprise written across his face. Li Qinghong praised it, “I’d heard Murong Wu used the Desert Profound Armor, which was thought to be a heavy armor steeped in demonic aura. I expected it to be a clunky plate armor. Who’d have thought, after eighty-one days of True Flame refinement, it would become this.”

Li Xuanxuan looked at the soft armor with nostalgic eyes and said in his hoarse voice, “The Murong Family hails from the northern tribes. Their armor is naturally forged to be fierce and bulky, with three pounds of iron made to look like nine. The Azure Pond Sect, for all its differences, is still a Dao lineage of the Immortal Dao, so of course they refine things toward elegance and grace...”

The old man had managed stores for many years and was no stranger to such things. After studying it for a moment, he said calmly, “Most likely the original Desert Profound Armor was far too unwieldy, so they had no choice but to reforge it into soft armor. Otherwise, by the Azure Pond Sect’s standards, they’d have tried turning it into a feathered robe!”

Li Zhouwei admired it for a while and was clearly pleased. He called out and the white armor rose on its own to wrap itself properly around his body. Tall and broad-shouldered, he stood proud, clad in white-gold battle gear gleaming with radiant light. As his golden eyes swept the room, he truly looked like a direct heir of an immortal family.

Only then did Li Qinghong speak gently, “This armor uses Desert Profound Sky Iron and Radiant Origin Stone for its core, with Wolfscale Bone and Crimson White Feather for the scales. Forged under True Flame by several high-level artifact smiths from the Azure Pond Sect, it is named Yuan’e.”

Li Zhouwei nodded gently. Li Xuanxuan, slightly surprised, asked, “Have you already refined it?”

Everyone knew that dharma artifacts required refining before use. They had to be saturated with mana. It wasn’t too difficult for Qi Cultivation Realm artifacts, and Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts already took significant time. Masterless ones were easier and often required days. If it was already bound to a previous owner, they took much longer. Some ancient technique artifacts like the Chongming Profound Insight Screen could take months...

Yet Li Zhouwei wielded the armor as if it were already his. Li Xuanxuan couldn't help but ask in puzzlement. Li Zhouwei replied with a smile, “I haven’t refined it... but things of Bright Yang nature naturally favor me. I can use them as I please even without refining them!”

As he spoke, the Da Sheng halberd manifested in his hand, radiating a bright, arcing glow. When its tip gently touched the floor, Li Qinghong smiled and said, “Go ahead and test your hand, have the white ape exchange a few moves with you.”

Li Zhouwei smiled and nodded, but said, “I’m afraid that won’t be enough.”

Li Xuanxuan let out a rare hearty laugh, while Li Qinghong withdrew the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, pushed open the palace doors, and stepped outside into the brisk morning wind. The creaking wooden clogs gave away the narrow-eyed monk’s stride.

Li Qinghong asked softly, “How about Kongheng?”

That drew Kongheng’s attention. He looked at the group, puzzled. Li Xuanxuan, whose memory of the monk still lingered in the distant past, smiled and nodded, “He seems quite good to me.”

Li Qinghong, however, was more hesitant. Kongheng was no longer the man he used to be. A Master Monk’s lifespan was no short matter, and cultivation under ancient Buddhist methods progressed slowly. Though he was never flashy, years of tempered cultivation had made him someone not easily underestimated.

“Even if his strength lies in defense rather than offense, he would still stand a strong chance against cultivators from the three sects and seven gates.”

Not wanting to dampen Li Zhouwei’s spirit, she turned and asked Kongheng directly, “May I ask, Master Monk, how would you rate your current strength?”

Kongheng paused in thought before giving a wry smile, “I doubt I could withstand your thunder arts... but I can still manage against other things.”

Li Qinghong was confident in her own strength. Amplified by several dharma artifacts, her thunder arts were powerful enough to rival Tang Shedu of old. That meant Kongheng had reached the level of a peak master in the Azure Pond Sect.

Before she could say anything further, the monk smiled and added, “If I’m on the defensive, even a late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator would have trouble killing me. But if I take the offensive... my strength would drop significantly. I’d say I’m around the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm.”

He was, of course, comparing himself to direct descendants of the three sects and seven gates. Li Qinghong quickly made her assessment and thought, Slightly weaker than Xizhi... roughly on par with Ximing.

She said gently, “Master Monk, why not test the heir’s strength? Just a light spar will do.”

“Very well!” replied Kongheng.
