# Chapter 781: A Lesson

Seeing the man’s display, Li Zhouluo had no choice but to rise from his seat and step aside. “Sect Master Kong, please, rise at once. You are a Foundation Establishment cultivator and an elder… you honor me too greatly.”

Kong Guxi did not wait to be helped. He rose in a single, fluid motion, his voice low and deferential. “In the face of saving our entire lineage, the distinction of elder means nothing. The younger generation of my family is boundlessly grateful to your clan. The Profound Peak Gate has preserved the spark of its existence today solely because of Moongaze Lake. From this day forward, any command from the lake will be met without question.”

Li Zhouluo nodded. Moongaze Lake’s position was precarious, and they were in the delicate process of easing tensions with the Capital immortals Dao across the shore. The last thing he needed was for the Profound Peak Gate to do something rash. “For now, you may use the territories on the eastern shore as a temporary station,” he said softly. “It would be best if you patrolled them, but there is no need to do anything more… As for the matter with the White Ye Immortal Sect, I must ask you to endure the humiliation for the time being. Do not provoke them again and cause further trouble.”

Kong Guxi nodded vigorously, vowing, “I have already instructed my juniors. The Profound Peak Gate is weak. We will be exceedingly polite even to independent cultivators and will never cross the river to cause trouble again. If we bring any more problems to your clan… you won’t have to lift a finger. I will personally deal with any of my foolish disciples.”

“Just be sure not to cause any trouble,” Li Zhouluo cautioned. “If you do, it will be a matter far greater than one or two disciples.”

Kong Guxi agreed. Li Zhouluo continued, “The wilderness is no ordinary place; the various major families will not allow them to occupy it for long. Once the Daoist Masters have concluded their discussions, the Capital immortals Dao will certainly withdraw, and you will be able to return… For now, how many disciples have you managed to gather?”

At the mention of this, a chill like a block of ice settled in Kong Guxi’s heart. “Reporting to the Family Head,” he said in a low voice, “aside from a few core Foundation Establishment cultivators, we have four at the Qi Refining stage, ten at the miscellaneous Qi stage, and several at the Embyronic Breathing stage…”

He found the words difficult to say. “When our mountain gate fell, some surrendered and some died. We managed to gather a few more after relocating to the wilderness, only to be attacked again. The Capital immortals Dao sent the very cultivators who had surrendered to us to win over the rest. Their loyalty wavered.”

After so many defeats, even the most loyal disciples knew the Profound Peak Gate was beyond saving. Though Kong Guxi had repeatedly promised that a Purple Mansion expert would soon emerge, his followers knew they might not live to see that day. The Capital immortals Dao also had a Purple Mansion Realm master. What retribution would they face in the future if they didn’t surrender now?

Thus, during their decline in the wilderness, the Profound Peak Gate not only lost a great number of loyal scions from allied families but also had its ranks of common disciples utterly gutted.

‘Alas!’

The Profound Peak Gate, once one of the great Three Sects and Seven Gates, was now reduced to a handful of nobodies. Such a small group wouldn’t have been enough to even establish a single hall in the sect’s former glory. Li Zhouluo could only remain silent.

Kong Guxi asked tentatively, “I have seen many independent cultivators on the eastern shore. The Profound Peak Gate was hoping to send someone to see about recruiting a few disciples…”

The eastern shore had always been the Li family’s territory, so Kong Guxi naturally did not dare overstep. He couldn’t recruit from the local clans, so his only option was to try his luck with the unaffiliated cultivators.

“That should not be an issue,” Li Zhouluo replied. “However, Sect Master, you must be careful. The character of these independent cultivators is hard to discern. Do not tarnish the name of the Profound Peak Gate.”

Kong Guxi nodded repeatedly. He found this new Family Head of the Zhou generation to be more approachable than his predecessors, and a wave of relief washed over him. Having received permission, he hadn’t even fully expressed his gratitude before he produced a jade box from his sleeve.

“The Profound Peak Gate has lost nearly all its members, leaving many of our Dharma artifacts unused,” he said respectfully. “They are wasted in our hands, and with the recent surge of demonic cultivators, our defenses are strained. I thought it best to deliver them into the hands of your clan’s cultivators, where they can be put to good use.”

“What is the meaning of this, Sect Master?” Li Zhouluo demurred as a matter of politeness.

Kong Guxi immediately gave him an out. “I have no other intention. My sect is all but empty, and my few remaining juniors cannot unleash the full power of these artifacts. They are constantly getting injured, and I fear for their futures. If we could ask your clan’s Foundation Establishment cultivators to wield them, each artifact would be used to its full potential. This is merely a measure to ensure the safety of my young ones.”

He pressed on, “And I heard that the lake was planning to send experts to help us defend against the demonic cultivators. This makes me feel even more indebted… We can’t let your clan’s cultivators make the trip for nothing…”

Li Zhouluo went back and forth with him for a while, feigning that he was being worn down by the old man’s persistence, before finally relenting. Kong Guxi eagerly opened the jade box, revealing a chain of glittering, crimson jade fragments.

The old man supported the base of the box with one hand and with the other, he lifted the strand of fragmented jade beads. He draped it over four fingers, his trembling index finger coming to rest against his middle finger. “This is an heirloom of my sect,” he said with a smile, “the Crimson Orb Jade. Worn around the neck, it can invigorate one’s blood and Qi and protect the body. It is quite formidable. It was once an ancient Dharma artifact, capable of transforming into a crimson jade chain to suppress enemies, but it can no longer do so.”

Noticing Li Zhouluo’s expression, he quickly explained, “It was shattered in a battle long ago… A Daoist Master later pieced it back together, so it no longer qualifies as an ancient Dharma artifact… but it is still powerful…”

He placed the necklace back and lifted the false bottom of the box. Beneath it lay a small, transparent glass vial containing a gray, scale-like object. “This was left behind by my sect’s Daoist Master,” Kong Guxi said. “He once answered the call of another Daoist Master to slay a demon in the sea and obtained this spiritual item. It is a scale from a Purple Mansion demon beast. While not a true Purple Mansion-level material, it can be considered a resource for one… If your clan has need of it, it would make for excellent armor.”

“I once overheard the Daoist Master say that if forged properly, the result might not be inferior to an ancient Dharma artifact.”

Besides the glass vial in the center, there were two other Foundation Establishment Dharma artifacts, one on each side. Their quality was average, hardly worth mentioning, with only a jade slip beside them for identification. After presenting these items, Kong Guxi finally took a pair of small, brightly shining cymbals from his sleeve. They were covered in intricate patterns and looked like two miniature straw hats.

His voice choked with emotion. “This last item… was prepared for Daoist Friend Chenghui’s descendant… But I heard he passed away in his prime, without even leaving behind a bloodline. I am overcome with shame. I can only ask the Family Head to accept this on his behalf… as a token of the Profound Peak Gate’s gratitude!”

Li Zhouluo could see clearly that these cymbals were forged from Geng Metal combined with the essence of another lineage—he couldn’t tell if it was True Qi or Purple Qi—and it radiated a sense of unified, balanced power. Not only were they formidable, but even an injured lightning cultivator could wield them without the slightest discomfort. It was clear Kong Guxi had put a great deal of thought into this…

But Li Zhouluo himself cultivated the path of Geng Metal. Whether this gift was truly for some supposed descendant or intended for him was, frankly, debatable.

‘What a clever man, this Sect Master Kong,’ the young man thought.

He set the jade box aside and singled out the cymbals. “Since this is a gift for an elder’s descendant,” he announced, “Someone attend me!”

A Jade Court cultivator stepped forward.

“Take this item and deliver it to the clan treasury,” Li Zhouluo commanded.

He had the cymbals taken away right in front of Kong Guxi, who showed no sign of awkwardness. The sect master simply nodded repeatedly. “Such artifacts are rare these days and extremely useful in battle… The functions of all the items are detailed in the jade slip in the box. I shall take my leave now.”

As the sect master hurried out, Li Zhouluo returned to his seat. The court guard returned, knelt on one knee with his head bowed, and presented the cymbals with both hands.

“Reporting to the Family Head, the grade of the treasure has not been determined. I do not know which treasury to store it in.”

Slightly surprised, Li Zhouluo looked at the artifact in the man’s palms. “Quick-witted. Which family are you from?”

“This servant’s surname is Dili, with the given name Guang,” the guard replied. “I am from the royal house of the Northern Mountain Yue.”

‘Dili… once a lowly surname among the Mountain Yue, and now they are royalty…’

Li Zhouluo gave a slight nod. The royal house of the Northern Mountain Yue sounded impressive, but in reality, they were nothing compared to the likes of the An, Chen, Dou, and Xu families—only slightly better than a humble clan.

Dili Guang had a sharp mind and had sought confirmation, but Li Zhouluo truly had no intention of coveting the artifact. “It is a peak-grade item for the Foundation Establishment realm. Send it to Mount Qingdu for the venerable elder to appraise.”

Just as Dili Guang was about to leave, Li Zhouluo stopped him. “You are on duty on the twenty-second… For the next two years, serve in the main hall. After that, you will attend me directly. I’ve received word from the venerable elder and must go see him now.”

Before he could even leave the great hall, a messenger announced that Chen Yang was waiting outside. Li Zhouluo held his elder brother’s capable subordinate in high esteem and gestured for Dili Guang to depart.

A young man in soft armor entered the hall, a broad smile on his face. He knelt as soon as he was inside, observing all proper etiquette before speaking.

“Chen Yang greets the Family Head!”

Li Zhouluo nodded. “Congratulations. Your breakthrough comes as a great relief to the clan in this pressing time!”

Chen Yang remained kneeling as he listened, only rising after the Family Head had spoken. A fierce light glinted in his eyes. “Family Head, I’ve heard that a number of demonic cultivators are causing trouble on the eastern shore. At a time like this, how dare one or two of them target Moongaze Lake? Please, allow me to make a trip and give them a taste of our strength!”

This was exactly what Li Zhouluo had in mind. Among his trusted followers, Chen Yang possessed a high-grade Immortal Foundation and was skilled in combat. “That is precisely why I’ve called you,” he said. “I need you to go. The Profound Peak Gate has just delivered some Dharma artifacts under the pretext of aiding the eastern shore. Take them with you. It will both enhance your strength and serve as a response to them.”

Li Zhouluo immediately took the Crimson Orb Jade from the box, along with a shield and a small pagoda from the lower compartment, and placed them in Chen Yang’s hands.

“Take your pick between the shield and the pagoda, whichever you find more suitable. Take the Crimson Orb Jade as well. With these two artifacts, head to the eastern shore…” he said in a low voice. “Your priority, as always, is self-preservation. With your strong foundation and powerful artifacts, a few demonic cultivators should not be able to trouble you. Just be careful.”

Chen Yang picked up the jade slip and read it, a thoughtful expression on his face. He then picked up the shield, a hint of doubt in his eyes. “Family Head, at this point, I find it unlikely that these demonic cultivators are acting on the orders of some Purple Mansion master. After all, those who should have been offended have been, and those who wished to stay out of it have long since extricated themselves. If it were simple robbery, one or two incidents would be reasonable, but so many demonic cultivators… several at the Foundation Establishment Realm, even. What could they possibly hope to plunder on the eastern shore?”

Li Zhouluo frowned. “What are you suggesting…”

“I am not yet certain,” Chen Yang replied softly. “It seems they have ulterior motives, yet it doesn’t feel like they are targeting our family specifically. The eastern shore and the wilderness have no clear border; their territories are deeply intertwined. I will investigate once I arrive. If the Capital immortals Dao on the wilderness side has also been attacked, it’s possible these demonic cultivators are someone else’s subordinates, and we have merely been caught in the crossfire.”

“I’ll leave this matter in your hands.”

Finding merit in his reasoning, Li Zhouluo entrusted the task to him. Chen Yang quickly departed. Ever respectful of his elders, Li Zhouluo remembered Li Xuanxuan’s summons and flew directly toward Mount Qingdu without a moment’s rest.

Crossing the lake, he soon saw the vibrant glow of the Five Waters Imperial Heaven Array. He descended from the sky, landing on a side peak. An old man, dressed formally in blue and black robes, sat silently within a pavilion.

Li Zhouluo landed at the edge of the courtyard and walked the rest of the way. The venerable elder’s seniority was so great that even his own father would have to approach on foot. Upon entering the pavilion, he bowed deeply.

“Greetings, venerable elder.”

“Come.”

Li Xuanxuan smiled kindly upon seeing him and had someone serve tea. He waited for Li Zhouluo to be seated before dismissing the attendants on both sides. Only then did he ask, “I heard you gave an Essence Gathering Pill to the third boy?”

The moment he heard this, Li Zhouluo instinctively knew something was wrong. He steeled himself. “That is correct, venerable elder.”

Li Xuanxuan hesitated for a moment before speaking, his voice aged. “The Essence Gathering Pills are, after all, precious. Every single one that is used is known to the clan elders. I made a special inquiry with Jiangxia and learned that he requested it for a friend…”

“This matter… you acted without sufficient thought.”

The words struck Li Zhouluo like a physical blow. He began to sweat. It was only because Li Xuanxuan had always been protective of the younger generation, never airing dirty laundry in public. But with the elder’s prestige, that single sentence was enough. From now on, it wouldn’t matter if Li Zhouluo managed the family well or poorly—in the eyes of many, it would be poorly.

“Please, elder, enlighten me!”

He responded, and Li Xuanxuan only sighed. “A single pill is not a great matter, and we need not be so calculative. The problem lies in taking it for private use. you have only just taken charge of the family and have yet to establish your prestige. This affair reflects poorly on you…”

“That Pei Xie is said to be a first-rate fighter. You should have at least organized a competition, invited all the unaffiliated cultivators at the peak of Qi Refining to participate, and awarded it as the grand prize. That way, everyone would have been convinced… You have no prestige of your own, and the pill did not come from your own resources… How could this be appropriate?”

The old man seemed anxious. His withered hand repeatedly pressed down on his teacup, then lifted, then pressed down again. “But your order has already been given, and the clan elders are aware. I cannot simply stop you…” he said, his voice raspy. “You have just taken this position. If I were to block you like this, you would never be able to accomplish anything in the future…”

Having never lacked for resources in his life, Li Zhouluo had subconsciously never considered an Essence Gathering Pill to be anything extraordinary. Even Dharma artifacts that others would kill for were just objects in his eyes. He had agreed without a second thought, but now, with the elder’s gentle prodding, he understood. “I will return at once… and deduct… deduct the pill from my own personal allotment… to demonstrate fairness.”

Hearing this, Li Xuanxuan’s brow finally relaxed. He spoke earnestly, “These few words are spoken behind the closed doors of my own courtyard. Whether it is your fifth brother, or you, or even Han’er… I watch over each and every one of you, and I will not let these matters spread outside. However… managing a family is not as simple as becoming the master of Mount Qingdu. You must remember this lesson for the future!”

At that moment, Li Zhouluo felt a genuine surge of emotion. He had always seen the venerable elder as a figure of authority, someone to be respected, but now he felt a true sense of affection. “Rest assured, venerable elder,” he said in a heavy voice. “Though I may be slow-witted, I will come to you often for guidance in the future to ensure the peace of our home.”

Aside from Li Zhouwei, Li Xuanxuan was counting on him to have some administrative ability, so he did not reprimand him further. “Go… go… everyone is watching you at this time. Don’t linger here too long. Just treat this as a simple visit to pay your respects.”

Li Zhouluo understood. He kowtowed once before exiting. Li Xuanxuan sipped his tea, sighing to himself.

‘That third boy is truly formidable… With this move… Luo’er has to give up his own pill to support him. Now, everyone will think that the Family Head, Li Zhouluo, favors Li Jiangxia…’
