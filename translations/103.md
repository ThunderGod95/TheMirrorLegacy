# Chapter 111: Recovered Mirror Shard

In the year 216 of the Great Calendar, the barbarian lord of Mount Yue—Jianixi—advanced eastward, plundered the towns of Lichuan and Lijing, and broke through the mountain gate.

Li Jingtian delicately held the brush with fair and slender fingers, meticulously jotting down notes on the silk fabric page of a book; save for the occasional pause to move her fingers and calculate the dates.

Father was trapped by Mount Yue, invaded westward into Great Jueting, and ravaged fifteen villages. The barbarian lord, fearing his might, resorted to foul curses to assassinate him... father had succumbed to a gruesome fate, coughing blood and spewing forth locusts.

He breathed his last at the tender age of thirty-nine.

The mantle of household responsibilities then fell upon the shoulders of the eldest son of the first uncle, Xuanxuan.

Li Jingtian sighed mournfully after writing this paragraph, her white clothes billowing gently in the breeze. Sitting beside her, Li Tongya raised his head to observe her continued writing in the book.

In the year 217 of the Great Calendar, the fourth month of the summer, there was a great drought. The fifteen Mount Yue villages were affected by locusts that came from the south and covered the sky.

“Well done,” Li Tongya murmured as he nodded approvingly. He had intended to start documenting the family history several years ago, but various family matters had kept everyone in the major sect occupied. Fortunately, Li Jingtian, being a direct descendant of the family, had the time and so the task was handed over to her.

Li Jingtian dipped her brush into the ink and set aside the completed writing. As she prepared another silk page to continue on, the sound of a report outside the courtyard caught their attention.

“Chen Donghe seeks an audience!”

“Come in.”

Chen Donghe entered the courtyard with a determined stride, clad in the same white clothes.

He glanced at Li Jingtian who was behind the curtain before cupping his fist.

“I have something important to report.”

He hesitated. It had been several months since his return to the village, and Li Tongya had been difficult to meet. He gritted his teeth in contemplation before finally speaking.

“The Family Head instructed that... this matter should be reported to Senior Tongya alone.”

Li Jingtian raised her head, then gently set aside her brush and bowed respectfully before retreating from the room. Noticing the seriousness in Chen Donghe’s demeanor, Li Tongya dismissed the attendants as well.

It was only then that Chen Donghe finally produced a crystal clear bead from his pocket, kneeling before Li Tongya.

“The Family Head has instructed that this bead must be personally delivered to your hands. I have not spoken of this to anyone else.”

Accepting the pearl, Li Tongya examined it closely. Encased within the crystal was a thumb-sized, pure white diamond-shaped shard that sparkled in the sunlight.

As Li Tongya was about to speak, the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed within his body trembled violently, causing his heart to skip a beat. He bit down on his tongue and swallowed his words.

“I understand. I’ll remember all that you’ve done for us,” he replied, feigning calmness.

After dismissing Chen Donghe, Li Tongya clapped his storage pouch, only to realize the treasure would not be able to fit inside. Without any other choice, he concealed it in his chest pocket. Nodding to Li Jingtian who had just reentered the courtyard, he swiftly made his exit.

————

Lu Jiangxian’s divine sense had long been fixated on that treasure pearl and as he observed Li Tongya hurrying to the backyard, he felt a profound connection with the shard.

His heart raced with excitement.

“It seems like the mirror is only left with a bluish-gray frame... what seems like its reflective surface is merely the shiny sheen of the smooth frame. The mirror itself has long been shattered and lost!”

The shard in the bead Li Tongya was holding was actually one of the lost fragments of the mirror!

The mirror itself was palm-sized, while the shard was the size of two fingernails, occupying one-tenth of its entire reflective surface. Lu Jiangxian resisted the urge to seize it and decided to wait silently in the backyard instead.

As Li Tongya placed the precious pearl atop the altar reverently, Lu Jiangxian activated his mana. A blazing white light erupted from the mirror, and the bluish-gray mirror floated into the air.

The twelve runes on the mirror’s frame flashed one by one, and white light rippled across the mirror’s surface like undulating water waves. A heavy pressure filled the courtyard, shocking Li Tongya and leaving him gasping for breath.

Lu Jiangxian ingested the pearl, and the Supreme Yin Profound Light burst forth. The crystal-clear shell melted like ice meeting fire, transforming into a white mist—which turned out to be the talisman qi of Foundation Establishment Realm.

As the mirror shard slowly fused into the frame, a profound sense of satisfaction and drowsiness washed over Lu Jiangxian. He focused on merging with the mirror shard, grabbing the talisman qi, and tossing it into Li Tongya’s Shenyang Mansion.

All of a sudden, Lu Jiangxian saw stars appear before his eyes as several rows of large characters appeared.

The top row was written in purposeful handwriting, with pale golden brush strokes—Deep Ocean Long Whale.

The words in the row below it were written in dark gray brush strokes that conveyed the bitter coldness of iron and stone—Exhausting Life To Achieve Success.

Back then, Li Xiangping had three types of talisman qi to choose from... while Li Tongya only had two. It seemed the type of talisman qi was related to the recipient’s talent, while the realm of the talisman qi determined the power of the ability after sealing it.

As Lu Jiangxian’s divine sense delved into the words, he was able to feel the differences between the two talisman qi.

The Deep Ocean Long Whale Talisman could enhance the recipient’s mana, deepening their true essence like the ocean and allowing for rapid recovery of mana.

On the other hand, the other talisman enabled the user to exchange lifespan for mana, granting explosive strength but at the cost of longevity.

Without hesitation, Lu Jiangxian chose the Deep Sea Long Whale Talisman, hoping it would help Li Tongya live longer and also allow the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed in his body to mature several more decades before its retrieval. Besides, knowing Li Tongya, there was no way that man would sacrifice his lifespan to win. So naturally, the first talisman was the most practical choice.

“You should be able to reach greater heights now. Guard your home well, and I shall rest for a while...” Lu Jiangxian murmured as he slowly drifted into a deep slumber.

Li Tongya felt a white qi enter his brow and a pale talisman qi materialized in his Shenyang Mansion before four huge golden characters appeared—Deep Ocean Long Whale.

“White talisman?!”

Before Li Tongya could react, the chakra in his Qihai acupoint stirred, and his cultivation realm surged with the intensity of a volcanic eruption.

Third heavenly layer... Fourth heavenly layer... Fifth heavenly layer...

The deep pool in Li Tongya’s Qihai acupoint expanded violently, growing five or six times larger than its original size. Once brimming with true essence, Li Tongya was now left with a sensation that felt like only twenty or thirty percent of his cultivation remained.

Li Tongya was so astonished that he could barely contain himself.

“What an unbelievable talisman qi... to think that there’s such a talisman qi within this treasure pearl! The Deep Ocean Long Whale Talisman is really powerful..!” he mumbled in utter shock and disbelief.

As he watched the bluish-gray mirror before him gradually lower onto the platform again, Li Tongya respectfully kneeled and bowed deeply three times. He then exited the courtyard and sat down cross-legged, then began to condense his true essence.

Just as he settled down, he was nearly jolted awake from his meditative state.

Although my Qihai is now five or six times larger, the recovery speed of my true essence is more than ten times faster! I thought it would take eight or ten hours to recover, but now it seems it won’t even take two hours..!

Li Tongya tried to settle down again and completed his meditation for an hour, feeling the profound true essence coursing through his body.

“I bet that the three past versions of myself combined can hardly take down the version I am now... they may even end up being exhausted to death by myself!” he murmured quietly to himself, barely able to contain his own excitement.

He soared into the air, feeling his mood had lifted greatly.

The big cave dwelling in the lake is full of spiritual qi... maybe I should send some people to patch it up when we have enough manpower to spare. It seems about an acre or two in size, like several cave dwellings on Mount Meiche combined. It seems like we don’t have to worry about cultivation space from now on.

Li Tongya reached into his storage pouch. There were fifty Spirit Stones from the time he helped destroy the Ji Family, along with the proceeds from selling items and accumulated surplus. This totaled to around seventy Spirit Stones.

Clang...

Drawing out a long spear that emitted a chilling gleam from his storage pouch, Li Tongya inspected the dharma artifact of the Foundation Establishment Realm he had obtained in the snake’s cave.

Faint electricity danced along its snow-white surface, causing Li Tongya’s palms to tingle.

Li Tongya smiled wryly. He was not skilled with spears, and on top of that, the dharma artifact was of the Foundation Establishment Realm—which was too powerful for a Qi Cultivator to wield. Hence, it could only be left to collect dust in his storage pouch.

“Since the formation at home hasn’t been set up yet, I will just carry it around for now.”

Putting the spear away, Li Tongya retrieved another jade slip.

This jade slip looked different from ordinary ones.

It was entirely purple, chilling to the touch, and remarkably durable. Li Tongya was convinced that he would not even be able to scratch it if he were to use all his strength.

“According to what Zhang Yun said, this is the long lost River Mountain Sutra from the destroyed Lingyu Gate... I wonder what kind of cultivation method this is.”

The jade slip had been sealed. Li Tongya attempted to access its contents with his spiritual sense, only to feel like he was going against an iron wall. He had no choice but to give up and wait until he could gather more information about it in the future.

When he entered the front yard, Li Xuanxuan was engrossed in reading wooden slips. Li Tongya sat beside him quietly.

“How are things at home?”

“Good.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded and replied without looking up. “There are now around twelve hundred vagrants from Mount Yue, and combined with the Mount Yue people that were already in the village, it gives a total of five thousand. The population under our rule has reached thirty thousand, with ten thousand in Lijing Town alone. The Li Family has more than eight hundred members, and the Ye Family has over three thousand.”

Li Tongya glanced at the wooden slip in his hand and thought to himself.

“With such numbers, there'll likely be many individuals with spiritual orifices in the coming years... keep an eye on them and ensure the Mount Yue people don’t cause any trouble.”

“Understood,” Li Xuanxuan replied with affirmation. “I’ve prohibited intermarriage between Mount Yue and our people. Women are only allowed to marry villagers, and men join the farming households. Those from Mount Yue don’t have surnames, so there’s a little aversion to changing them... in just two or three generations, there won’t be any distinction between those from Mount Yue and our villagers.”

“Excellent,” Li Tongya said approvingly. He then let out a slight chuckle.

“I heard you have six concubines..?” he asked teasingly.

Li Xuanxuan stammered and awkwardly nodded, his cheeks flushing instantly.

“That was from two years ago when Third Uncle picked them for me...” he stuttered shyly.

“It’s good to expand the family... the major sect’s numbers are still too small,” Li Tongya continued with a reassuring nod.

“Just don’t overindulge yourself and let that affect the progress of your cultivation.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded hastily.

“I can feel that I’m very close to condensing the Jade Capital Chakra! I can probably enter seclusion to break through to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm soon.”

Li Tongya stood up and glanced at the setting sun outside the window.

“What did the messengers that were sent to the Lu and An Families report?”

“They both brought back news. Both the Lu and An Families now rule over more than twenty thousand people— one occupies Mount Huazhong, and the other occupies Mount Huaqian.”

Li Tongya carefully listened to this before replying.

“With the population under our rule about to exhaust available land for cultivation along with our population growth reaching its limit, let’s keep an eye on these two families and wait for the right moment.”

“Agreed,” Li Xuanxuan replied with a nod in agreement. After a brief moment of contemplation, he added, “There’s one more thing though...”

Li Tongya frowned and asked, “What is it?”

“I think Donghe... probably fancies Jingtian.”

“...Donghe?”

At this, Li Tongya’s expression clouded momentarily with sorrow before responding. “He’s talented and of good character... however, with Xiangping just gone, this is not the time to discuss marriage. You should ask Jingtian if she fancies anyone right now, then we can discuss further.”

————

The night had grown deep, with the gentle moonlight casting a soothing glow over the stone path; the mountain breeze feeling particularly refreshing.

Li Jingtian lit a candle and settled down to read the records she had meticulously written over the past few days. However, her concentration was interrupted by a series of soft knocks on the door.

It was a clan soldier who was stationed outside.

“Young lady, the Family Head requests your presence in the main courtyard.”

Li Jingtian was taken aback before quickly realizing that Li Xuanxuan was the Family Head the clan soldier was referring to. She extinguished the candle on the desk and softly replied, “I understand.”

After gathering her belongings, she gently opened the door of her room. However, she was surprised to find a teenager standing outside. Her brow arched.

“Donghe..?”

Chen Donghe nodded nervously, his eyes darting around before speaking.

“Jingtian, the family head sent me to fetch you,” he croaked out.

Li Jingtian furrowed her eyebrows slightly, puzzled.

“Why did the family head send you? Did he mention anything specific..?” she asked, curious.

Chen Donghe gritted his teeth, clenching his hands nervously as he explained, “I... You... Uh... The Family Head asked me... if I wanted to be... together... with you...”

Li Jingtian’s almond eyes slowly widened as she stared at him in shock. Only a single word escaped her slightly parted lips.

“Huh...?”

The two stared at each other for a few seconds. Li Jingtian could already discern the answer in Chen Donghe’s fiery gaze. She walked silently along the stone path—her heart heavy and hands cold, as if she already understood what awaited her.

Chen Donghe also understood the situation from Li Jingtian’s silence. His eyes which were filled with longing and desire were now like extinguished fire pits, turning cold like churned ash.

With pursed lips, he sent Li Jingtian into the main courtyard and sat at the entrance. He stared blankly at the moon in the sky.

Li Jingtian cautiously entered the main courtyard where only Li Xuanxuan was present, engrossed in reading a wooden slip.

Unlike Li Xiangping who preferred to sit in his seat at that spot, Li Xuanxuan often stood by the table as if there was someone else occupying the large chair, making him conscious of his actions.

“Jingtian...”

Li Xuanxuan glanced up and saw the answer in Li Jingtian’s eyes. Despite this, he remained composed and warm as he asked, “What do you think of Donghe?”

Li Jingtian noticed the hopeful anticipation in Li Xuanxuan’s eyes. She understood that he wished to see such a capable aide as Chen Donghe married into the Li family, ensuring the continuation of such a valuable bloodline.

“Courageous, reliable, and talented. At fifteen, he’s already at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm and shows promise in reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm,” Li Jingtian calmly responded.

Li Xuanxuan nodded approvingly.

“Who among the men in the towns can compare to him? You should spend more time with him regularly...” he continued in a low, reassuring voice.

Li Jingtian listened to Li Xuanxuan’s personal advice and then left the courtyard in a daze.

Chen Donghe had already vanished from the entrance. Walking along the stone path, Li Jingtian suddenly felt a deep sense of insignificance and unease.

She looked up at the bright moon.

How I wish I had a spiritual orifice as well.
