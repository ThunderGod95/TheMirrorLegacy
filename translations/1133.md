# Chapter 1133: The Pristine Deficiency

The world was desolate and clear, blanketed by flurries of white snow.

A mirror on the table glowed brightly, its light illuminating the dark and silent depths of the cave dwelling, streaking through the gloom like a shuttle.

The ground in that region was a limitless expanse of silver-white, reflecting countless profound lights. Dense patterns materialized within it, forming a large pentagon. Jet-black, profound pillars stood throughout the space, emitting a mysterious radiance.

As these illusory lights converged, they formed a high platform in the very center. Behind it stood three profound gates. The area below was dark, paved with five-colored bricks—dark gold, dark azure, dark crimson, dark white, and dark brown—all carved with intricate, colorful patterns.

On the platform rested a palm-sized, unopened stone box.

A torrent of divine ability roiled across the steps, drawn along five distinct patterns into the profound pillars. It surged and swelled, seeming as if it might burst from the mirror at any moment and charge into this unknown world.

The white-robed man beside the table watched quietly, completely unaffected. Yet his thoughts were not on the surging divine ability before him; his mind was heavy with other matters:

'The Sun Seeker Ring... that's the treasure.'

According to the information Lu Jiangxian had, the Sun Seeker Ring was supposed to have come from the Green Pine Temple of old. Because that group of cultivators who entered it were scattered, it eventually fell into the Six Ding Merging Fire Token

And this Spiritual Artifact, drawn by the strings of fate, ultimately fell upon a lake... and that lake was Moongaze Lake! If the token's fall was orchestrated, it could only have been the work of one group.

'Mount Dali.'

'The Six Ding Merging Fire Token and the Sun Seeker Ring... were deployed by the remnants of the Immortal Mansion. If the news from Mount Qusi is correct, then Bright Yang's fall... also aligned with the interests of the Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition—or at least, with the ideology of the Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition at that time.'

Lu Jiangxian himself possessed Bright Yang Metallic Essence and knew of Mount Luoxia's arrangements regarding the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment's status. He could be said to know everything clearly, but precisely because of this, he had a different perspective from these Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

'Lǐ Qiányuán's fall is untraceable, yet Mount Luoxia's actions were calm and steady. Regardless of whether the Sun Seeker Ring existed, Bright Yang's fall was already a certainty. It was only a matter of time...'

'Crossing Holder knew Bright Yang couldn't last. He used this ring, most likely, to ensure that the initiative for the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment would later fall into the hands of Azure Profoundity cultivators.'

'And the ideology of the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition—at least, its superficial ideology—remains the same: "As long as the position is filled, who cares who fills it?" All that mattered was accelerating the Imperial Monarch's fall.'

'Beneath this dual-layered game, Emperor Wei made his own arrangements.'

Lu Jiangxian's thoughts grew heavy,

'He also anticipated this and left himself a contingency. He placed his own Metallic Essence within it... perhaps he broke the original method and replaced it, or perhaps he had other plans. It was hidden extremely deep. Thus, this treasure flowed back to the Azure Profoundity.'

'It likely passed through the hands of many powerful cultivators. Perhaps they saw nothing amiss, or felt it required a Profound Mystery locus to activate. In the end, it fell into the hands of the Immortal Mansion, which finally raised the curtain on this grand show.'

'So, what role did the Azure Pond Sect play? The cultivators who went to Moongaze Lake year after year were a line of communication. And Li Mutian, who walked out of Lijing Village, brought back the Underworld's signal of passage. The barely surviving Mount Dali, perhaps obeying an immortal decree or perhaps finally seizing a chance to grasp the initiative, immediately entered the game. They joined in to fulfill the prophecy: "The Bright Yang Imperial Monarch will meet his execution."'

'The fox Demon beast being able to accompany Lǐ Zhōuwēi from the lake into the sea... that was one of the benefits of grasping the initiative...'

Lu Jiangxian reflected silently, his mind gradually clearing:

'Many things were not personally arranged by my so-called "previous self"... they were the inevitable tide of the world's progression. I merely interfered in the process of the "Mandate of Heaven for Bright Yang descending upon the world."'

'Therefore... whether it was the Yang family or Xueyang, when they met Lǐ Zhōuwēi, they were all calm, as if expecting him. "The Bright Yang Imperial Monarch will meet his execution"... but that never meant "An Azure Profoundity descendant will set things right." From start to finish, he was only ever the emperor-slaying sword, destined to emerge with the changing tides. Whether he succeeded or failed... not even Crossing Holder could calculate such a thing across thousands of years, not with so many True Monarchs entering the world... He merely seized the crucial point, securing the initiative for the Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition.'

Lu Jiangxian's gaze grew heavier,

'My actions... their influence on the situation is neither large nor small... But at the very least, Vast Cicada's death already caused the Dharma Master to miscalculate... It further proves that before True Qi is verified, the Yang family needs Lǐ Zhōuwēi more than Luoxia does.'

He let out a long breath. The falling snow in the world outside grew heavier. Bright moonlight poured down, piling up beneath the jade steps. On the luminous jade table, an object had suddenly appeared.

It was perfectly round and bright, like a pellet the size of a fingernail, resting in a jade cup, continuously emitting a soft, winding radiance.

Vast Cicada's fall was the result of a clash that transcended the Purple Mansion Realm level. The Precious Tusk Golden Land had a connection to the mortal world, so Lu Jiangxian hadn't dared to overtly claim it. But Lǐ Zhōuwēi's strike had shaken the Precious Tusk Golden Land, exposing it to his eyes for a single instant.

And Lu Jiangxian had cultivated the Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core—a unique immortal art and grotto-heaven creation secret! In that one instant, he had already seen through seventy or eighty percent of the Precious Tusk Golden Land's essence.

'The way of Buddhist cultivators... is truly profound!'

'The Precious Tusk Golden Land is all about position! An ancient Buddhist cultivator seems to have borrowed an extremely high-status 'specification' and used a method similar to, but cruder than, the Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core to verify this Golden Land with their own cultivation.'

'But after obtaining this Golden Land, the ancient Buddhist cultivator used their own position as a springboard, binding the Golden Land to themself. When they died after verifying the Dao, the Golden Land withered with them. Yet, because of that high-status object they borrowed when verifying it, it was not completely cast down. Instead, it transformed into a void.'

'Once it became a void, it should have never returned. But the corpses, stupas, and other things with inherent wondrous power and a degree of position left inside... by chance, they sensed the outside world and re-linked to a Buddhist cultivator's position. The Golden Land thus began to shine once more.'

'It has a very faint flavor of the Golden Core position distinction. After all, I only saw a shell; this is the most I can sense. For more details... I'm afraid I'll have to investigate the Buddhist cultivator Daoist tradition...'

But none of that mattered. With the Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core in hand, what fate could an ownerless Golden Land exposed before him, Lu Jiangxian, possibly have?

'Naturally, it's mine!'

This pearl represented the authority of the Precious Tusk Golden Land. So long as he willed it—even with the Precious Tusk Golden Land currently being constrained by that Dharma Master from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm and colluding with that dharma realm—it would immediately become Lu Jiangxian's personal Dao-sanctum!

'With my position... I wonder what this Golden Land will transform into!'

'It might even swallow the Great Adoration Dharma Realm whole... That Incense Master would become a minor Vajra before my throne, and that Realm Master would be a mere abbot beneath my seat. Then the dharma realm would burst through the heavens, forcing that Greatest Enlightenment Zen Heaven Acharya to jump out...'

Even if he couldn't personally possess it, through his careful study these past few days, he knew that as long as he was willing, he could use an immortal art like the Wondrous Art of the Unified Golden Core to choose a master for the Precious Tusk Golden Land!

He sneered inwardly,

'That Way of Great Desire... can forget about ever scheming for this Precious Tusk Golden Land!'

After digesting the news from Qusi, he silently shifted his gaze to the stone box before him.

''Manifestations Earth''

Lǐ Xīmíng was observing the subterranean landscape, so he naturally couldn't avoid Lu Jiangxian's presence. The expanse of white light he saw was not some other object, but an illusion manifested by Lu Jiangxian. This place was rather strange; it was not wise to look too closely.

In Lu Jiangxian's judgment, this 'Manifestations Earth' Metallic Essence before him had an absolutely extraordinary origin. Even with the formation concealing it, the moment he entered this place, he could feel the extremely high position emanating from the Metallic Essence!

'If not for this formation, it wouldn't matter what void-isolating place you put it in... The moment its mystery unraveled, its spiritual energy would burst forth...'

The fluctuation from this Metallic Essence was as plain as the sun and moon. But the formation established here was even more ingenious. Through diversion, transformation, and guiding the five elements, it actually used the position and mystery of 'Manifestations Earth' itself to conceal the Metallic Essence!

'The skill behind this great formation is so high it even has a trace of immortal qi. It's likely from the Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition.'

But this method was ultimately a clever trick, and not without its flaws. No matter how dynamic the formation was, it could never be as dynamic as the Metallic Essence itself. The Metallic Essence was constantly assaulting the great formation, setting off tremors time and again. If a cultivator didn't suppress and resolve this, it was highly likely to break the fragile balance and fly out into the mortal world!

Perversely, the formation was constructed using the power of the Metallic Essence itself. Once control was lost, it would immediately lose its power source. It would be utterly incapable of offering any resistance and would melt away and vanish in an instant under the radiance of the Metallic Essence.

'The entire Xinyu Archipelago would be reduced to turbid mud. This 'Manifestations Earth' Metallic Essence also has a drifting, divine-like immortal intent. If those great cultivators don't intervene, I'm afraid it will declare itself an ancestor and establish a boundless, evil land.'

Lu Jiangxian paced for two steps before raising his gaze. The five stone pillars shimmered with different illusory colors, each bearing deeply carved inscriptions, one following the next, from left to right:

'Secret Manual of the Baixiang Peak Matron Monarch's Dao Manifestation'

The Daoist mysteries in these words were profound, the sentences deep. Even with Lu Jiangxian's high Dao-Profundity, he couldn't help but pause, silent for a long moment.

'It truly is a Sheji inheritance. This is a secret art for manifesting Manifestations Earth and Returning Earth, nourishing cultivators, and upholding righteous cultivation. It must have been written by a supreme cultivator.'

This person's understanding of the Manifestations Earth Dao was terrifyingly deep. Although Lu Jiangxian was proficient in many Daos, he had never delved into Earth Virtue and was sorely lacking in it. Gazing at this text was like staring up at a towering mountain.

Although he had no use for it at the moment, he still committed it to memory, nodding to himself,

'This place is extremely well-hidden, almost impossible for anyone to reach. It's a Sheji Daoist tradition, and it has a 'Manifestations Earth' Metallic Essence... It will definitely be useful.'

'What's more... the five paths of Geng (Metal), Renewing (Wood), Pristine (Water), Blazing (Fire), and Manifestations (Earth) are all related. They are the paths of transformation and revolution among the Five Virtues. Even if I can't obtain a Pristine Water Metallic Essence, just seeing this Manifestations Earth is beneficial for reference.'

With that, he raised a brush to study it in detail. The snow falling in the world outside grew even more frantic. An unknown amount of time passed before his faintly calculating hand stilled. His brows furrowed tighter and tighter.

'Something's wrong...'

''Xuan' (Manifestation) means to express, to scatter, to spread, to clarify. When upheld righteously, the king's command is spread, and all follow it like a shadow. When used for rebellion, a single rogue can rise, and the world will boil in revolt. Thus, it is revered as the master of Sheji.'

'Among its techniques, one divine ability, 'Rite of the Sovereign Earth', is the most important—to replace the world's heart with one's own!'

Snowflakes fell. The jade slip on the desk glowed with a warm light. The hand hesitated for a moment before lifting the brush,

'But it's far more than just that. Since 'Pristine Water' was mentioned, there are five related divine abilities that are spoken of in the same breath. They are called the "Five Transgressions," also known as the "Five Transgressive Audiences," which can be concurrently cultivated by Cultivation Transcendence cultivators.'

'Besides Manifestations Earth's Rite of the Sovereign Earth, there is also Geng Metal's Present Departs Old, Renewing Wood's Spring Before Sickness, and Blazing Fire's Burning the Old Chamber...'

'These ancient names seem convoluted, but in the orthodox inheritance of Wanling Heaven, these divine abilities have even clearer aliases!'

'They are 'World's Heart', 'World's Revolution', 'World's Change', and 'World's Scorch'!'

'Earth, Metal, Wood, Fire... only water is missing. It should be 'Pristine Water'.'

Lu Jiangxian set down his brush, a look of confusion on his face.

'But the last one is not water... it's Bright Yang's 'World's Radiance'!'

Possessing several immortal arts, his Dao-Profundity provided a high-level, overarching understanding. As he cross-referenced, he truly grasped a point of confusion. He remained silent for a long time as the words on the jade slip flickered with light.

'Why do the Five Transgressions lack water? The various classics only express confusion, with not so much as a word of explanation. Only an ancient cultivator from the Liang dynasty, "Zhou Rao," said, "Water is said to moisten and flow down, thus it does not contend. It favors low places and abhors high ones, thus it has no transgression."'

This was Lu Jiangxian's original understanding as well. But now that he had seen the 'Manifestations Earth' Metallic Essence itself, he immediately realized those words only touched the surface, not the core. They were ultimately a lower-level interpretation.

'The Five Transgressions are, in the end, the Five Virtues, not Cultivation Transcendence. They have both a righteous and a reverse aspect. The "Transgression" is the exterior, but the "Transformation" is the interior. The Five Transgressions must include water, representing the concept of "The people are the water, the ruler is the boat; when the water is calm, there is prosperity; when the water is wroth, the boat is overturned." Logically, this should be 'Pristine Water's 'Heavy Murk'... That divine ability can bewitch the hearts of men; it was the source of the demonic calamity in Jiangnan all those years ago.'

'If I extrapolate based on Daoist arts, 'Pristine Water's 'Heavy Murk' should be that missing divine ability. It could well be called 'World's Overturning'!'

But Lu Jiangxian had already collected all the Pristine Water divine abilities. Chi Buzi even cultivated this path, so he had seen it clearly. 'Heavy Murk' was always missing something... Compared to 'World's Radiance' and 'World's Heart', it had lost its fundamental essence!

'The theoretical extrapolation from the Daoist arts conflicts with the current principles of magic... If my deduction isn't wrong, then it is highly likely that the Pristine Water Fruition Attainment itself has a problem... This is the root cause of why Du Qingzang stays reclusively indoors, bitterly suppressing his so-called 'dragon nature'!'

His eyes shone brightly as he stood up.

'Otherwise, with his orthodox Azure Profoundity Supreme Yang Daoist tradition method for ascending to immortality, he wouldn't be in such a wretched state!'

Lu Jiangxian grew more certain, his confidence approaching sixty percent.

'That's right... The 'Pristine Water' concept is about rising and sinking, clarity and turbidity. It is the water of ponds and pools, water that springs from the earth or descends from the sky, water that does not connect with the external waters... It has been 'repaired' to perfection, so perfect it seems natural. But is that a good thing? If the Feathered Serpent of old held such a 'Pristine Water' Fruition Attainment, why would it have needed to go to the sea?'

'Pond water—it cannot raise waves. This means it has lost the ability for 'the water to overturn its ruler'! 'World's Overturning' thus became 'Heavy Murk'. These two transformations are two sides of the same coin, revealing the deficiency in Pristine Water!'

'The "Pristine Unification Transformation" that the True Hornless Dragon spent its life's Dao-fruit on... was definitely not as simple as just swallowing something. Even its descendant could preside over the major event of the Mansion Water losing its 'vastness' (a play on Vast Ocean). How could the ancestor not do more? Pristine Unification was not about mutual fusion and growth. I fear that of the five waters, all except Valley Water... were corrupted by the Dragon-kin. Pristine Water was just the first!'

His gaze was now intensely bright, fixed burningly on the jade slip before him.

"But... why was it replaced by World's Radiance? Why the completely unrelated Bright Yang? Even if there was a scheme, Emperor Wei and the True Hornless Dragon weren't even from the same era!"

"Li Qianyuan, this Bright Yang Imperial Monarch... he was so close to the Dragon-kin. What does that signify?"

He had peeled back one layer of the mystery, only to see a deeper, slumbering plot. A wave of emotion rose in his heart.

'These figures... their abilities are so incredibly high! Their schemes... so unfathomably deep...'

"If... if I had a Pristine Water Metallic Essence in my hand... I could definitely uncover this mystery and understand what Du Qingzang and the Dragon-kin are plotting!"

He lowered his gaze, his thoughts surging:

'Chi Buzi is indeed seeking Valley (Water)... but with his Dao-Profundity, he might just be able to trigger the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal... Inside it is a Feathered Serpent Pristine Water Metallic Essence. Not the current Pristine Water Noon Origin Talismanic Speech Essenc"—but the most ancient, most glorious Pristine Water!'
