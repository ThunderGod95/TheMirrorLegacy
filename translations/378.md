# Chapter 478: Li Encheng

An Zheyan offered his congratulations and said, "I discovered two mineral veins in the lake. One is Radiant Spirit Lead, an Embryonic Breathing Realm spirit ore, with reserves of about four hundred thousand jin. The other is Ni Water Frost Iron, at the Qi Cultivation Realm, with around two hundred thousand jin."

His face was filled with excitement as he continued, "These two veins are quite substantial, enough to last us for several hundred years!"

Li Yuanping was visibly shaken by the news, and an expression of sheer joy flashed across his face. He immediately grasped the key point and continued to ask, "Radiant Spirit Lead and Ni Water Frost Iron are not like Ebony Ore, which can be used immediately after extraction... They probably need to be refined first, right?"

An Zheyan nodded and replied, "Radiant Spirit Lead is a spirit material often used in crafting. It takes one hundred jin of ore to extract a finger-sized amount of powder, but even that can sell for a single Spirit Stone!"

He took out two pieces of ore from his chest pocket. One was earthy yellow with grayish hues and covered in circular patterns, while the other was quite beautiful, covered by blue and white patterns, looking almost like a gemstone.

Handing them to Li Xicheng, he continued, "Ni Water Frost Iron is more valuable. Though the vein is a bit poor, two hundred jin of ore can still yield a fist-sized piece of Frost Iron, which is worth several Spirit Stones."

"Good!"

Li Yuanping nodded after hearing this. Manpower was currently the least of the Li Family's concerns. In fact, the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators from the various mountains were quite free. With these two mineral veins, the refining work could be arranged, saving those cultivators from idleness.

He then added, "You have also met Li Wushao. With the help of these demonic creatures, how much ore can be mined each year?"

An Zheyan replied, "About a thousand jin of Radiant Spirit Lead. As for Ni Water Frost Iron, it's harder to mine and requires Qi Cultivators to personally dig it out. If we could extract two hundred jin a year, that would already be impressive."

An annual income of more than ten Spirit Stones, nearly a hundred in five years... that is quite good!

Li Yuanping smiled slightly. Radiant Spirit Lead was fairly common, as most Embryonic Breathing Realm artifacts could use it. Selling it would not be an issue, but Ni Water Frost Iron was extremely valuable, so it would be best to save it for the family's use.

Having made up his mind, he arranged for the Jade Court Guards to accompany An Zheyan, and said to Li Xicheng who was by his side, "Go and summon Li Wushao. If we are going to command the demons at the bottom of the lake to mine, we will need the Hooked Serpent's help."

Li Xicheng nodded and withdrew, while Li Yuanping calculated carefully, "In a few years, the spirit fish we are breeding will gradually yield returns. The two types of minerals will produce at least a dozen Spirit Stones annually. This way, Xicheng will not need to worry about the finances of the household in the future."

If it were not for the need for Spirit Stones, Li Yuanping would not have been willing to sell these minerals. Once they produced their own weaponsmith, the price difference between selling raw materials and selling finished artifacts would be worlds apart.

The Li Family did possess a few smithing techniques that were acquired from rogue cultivators, but they were not easy to use. They required fire veins to barely forge Embryonic Breathing Realm artifacts, and the cost was enormous. Since the family did not have any fire veins, they had to abandon the idea for now.

Li Yuanping silently calculated, "I wonder if we can obtain Meng Taizhi's smithing legacy... From the looks of it, he seems to be able to craft artifacts without fire veins. The old man does not have many years left; getting my hands on the legacy should not be too difficult..."

He recalled Meng Taizhi's words and expressions earlier and could not quite figure them out.

The lakeshore.

Meng Taizhi descended from the air, riding the wind back to the shore. The small cabin by the lake was still lit, and he pushed open the door to enter. Inside, Meng Zhuoyun was silently cultivating.

"Yun'er," Meng Taizhi called out.

Meng Zhuoyun, with her delicate features and skin fairer than snow, appeared rather young. She was meditating on the bed.

When she saw Meng Taizhi enter the room, she quietly asked, "How is the Li Family? Although Xiao Yuansi has ties with grandfather, he is a lord from a prestigious clan, unacquainted with the harshness of the world..."

Meng Taizhi shook his head, speaking in a deep tone, "The Li Family may be a rising power, but their discipline is strict. The Li Family's ancestor is probably an old-fashioned traditionalist, keeping everything under tight control and governance. And with the Xiao Family ancestor's letter, they surely will not harm us."

Meng Taizhi pondered for a moment before continuing, "I have not met Li Yuanjiao yet, but Li Yuanping is quite a figure. Unfortunately... his face seems pale and his breath is weak. He's likely gravely injured. I'm afraid he does not have many years left to live."

Meng Zhuoyun furrowed her brow slightly, puzzled as she asked, "How could a sword immortal clan like the Li Family have such a frail clan head? There must be something wrong... Devil cultivators have run rampant for years; I refuse to believe they do not have secret techniques!"

Meng Taizhi shook his head, stroking the long beard on his chin as he responded thoughtfully, "The Li Family is ruthless toward cultivators, but they have a peculiar compassion for mortals. Bound by worldly morals, they refuse to use secret techniques to save their own kin. They merely stand by and watch such individuals die. It is truly a pity..."

After a pause, the old man continued, "Perhaps it is for the best. That man is highly skilled, and if he were to take control of the family, we would still feel ill at ease even if we did not harbor any ulterior motives toward them."

Meng Zhuoyun, now confused, asked, "Seriously? The lives of a hundred unrelated mortals versus a capable, trustworthy brother—how could anyone not see the difference? It's hard to believe that a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator like Li Yuanjiao cannot tell which is more important. It has been a thousand years since the great war between the immortals and devils, yet such families still exist... I'd heard rumors in the Eastern Sea of conservative sects and families clinging to outdated ways, but I never thought it was true!"

"Best not to speak too much!" Meng Taizhi cautioned, then said, "I have made things clear with Li Yuanping. Gaining the alchemy legacy should not be an issue, but Li Yuanping still does not trust me, and he has not shown any intention of taking me in. When I die, I am afraid you will be forced to wander the Yue State."

A look of regret crossed his face as he continued, "I had hoped the Li Family, now flourishing, would be the best option. Li Tongya is a renowned sword cultivator, and Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong are incredibly gifted, with more talent emerging in their lineage. If I could pledge allegiance to this family, it would be ideal. But sadly, he does not trust me."

Meng Zhuoyun remained silent, and Meng Taizhi sighed as he continued sorrowfully, "If Li Yuanping still does not trust me when my time is almost up, I will stop holding back. I will offer all my smithing knowledge to the Li Family, asking only that you learn a few alchemy secret techniques from Li Ximing. At least that way, you will have something to rely on for your future. The Azure Pond Sect's territories are much like the Eastern Sea. You should head for the Golden Feather Sect instead... It is safer there."

As Meng Zhuoyun listened, she tightened her grip on a dark golden, bronze mirror and said softly with a sigh, "It is a shame that my husband was killed by that rogue cultivator. If not for that, with his abilities, I would not have to live such a life of constant wandering."

"It's pointless to talk about that now... "

Meng Taizhi let out several deep sighs, his face filled with despair as he continued, "Who could have predicted such a thing..? That a cultivator at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm would be slain by a mere early-stage Qi Cultivator? On top of that, he actually died at the hands of a rogue cultivator during his journey!"

The old man raised his white-haired head, tears streaking down his cheeks as he lamented, "I regret everything... We should not have provoked Tu Longjian! It has led us to this downfall!"

But Meng Zhuoyun's expression remained cold as she spoke softly, "I have no regrets. I'll kill him sooner or later."

Azure Pond Sect.

In the bamboo forest atop Qingsui Peak, a young man clad in feathered robes sat cross-legged. As a gentle breeze stirred, he opened his eyes, a smile slowly spreading across his face.

"I've mastered the Dawn Imperial Movement!"

The Dawn Dew Gathering Technique was a cultivation method perfected over five hundred years by the Azure Pond Sect. It came with a complete set of techniques and was considered one of the best among Grade Four techniques. Li Xizhi was one of those who practiced it, particularly the levitation technique it included.

Unfortunately, this method could only be cultivated to the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Every disciple of the Azure Pond Sect aspired to reach the Purple Mansion Realm. Since this technique offered no benefits in alchemy or smithing, very few chose to practice it.

Li Xizhi had often been looked down upon by his peers for following this path, but he never took it to heart, focusing only on his cultivation.

Rising to his feet, a six-colored aura of vibrant energy swirled beneath him, lifting him into the air. Clad in a black feathered robe gifted to him by Yang Xiao'er, he truly appeared like an immortal.

Flying above Qingsui Peak for a while, he felt quite satisfied with himself.

With the River Crossing Torrential Step for quick movement and the Dawn Imperial Movement for levitation, even a peak Qi Cultivator would have a hard time killing me. Once I master the Six-Colored Essence Evasion, I will hardly have to fear any danger while traveling outside with a few talismans on hand.

Looking at the swirling six-colored qi beneath his feet, he sighed regretfully.

Everything about this technique is excellent, except for its brilliance. It is far too conspicuous... Anyone can tell it is a mystical technique at a glance—definitely not discreet enough.

Li Xizhi chuckled at his own dissatisfaction and descended on the wind, only to see Yang Xiao'er flying toward him, holding a tiny storage pouch in her hand.

At the start, she had been anxious, but Li Xizhi had always treated her kindly, and over time, the girl had grown more at ease in his presence. She was now smiling radiantly, her eyes filled with affection for him.

"My dear, there is news from home!" Yang Xiao'er announced happily.

Li Xizhi quickly took the pouch, probing it with his spiritual sense. He found three jade boxes sealed within. After reading the small letter tucked inside, he fell silent.

Yang Xiao'er stepped forward and asked softly, "What does it say?"

Li Xizhi led her back down to the bamboo forest, taking her hand and speaking in a low voice, "Things at home have gone well. It seems I will need to make a trip to Fuchen Peak and see if I can make a connection there... After all, that person is a peak Foundation Establishment Realm alchemist."

Yang Xiao'er pursed her lips and said, "Li Encheng has a strange temper and has never aligned himself with any faction... Making amends is one thing, but it will not be easy to build a connection with him. You might end up humiliated instead..."

The Azure Pond Sect was a grand sect with a five-hundred-year history and a colossal presence in Yue State. It dominated the southern two prefectures and the Azure Pond Mountain Range, influenced the five gates to the east, and suppressed the thriving Changxiao Gate to the west. In border regions like Moongaze and Lixia, it maintained control through heavy taxes and bloodshed. Every territory was strictly governed, and the sect's stability was unrivaled.

However, within the Azure Pond Sect, factions flourished. The Yuan Xiu and Yuanwu factions were the largest, but many smaller factions existed as well. Peak masters, elders, and Daoist Masters were locked in constant power struggles, with Sect Master Chi Zhiyun barely managing to maintain a precarious balance.

"No, I still have to try."

Li Xizhi thought carefully and responded, "The Chi Family's numbers are dwindling within the sect. They have been relying on the Ning Family to control the various peaks, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to face the Yuanwu faction. Furthermore, the recent imbalance in the distribution of resources from the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven has only led to more provocations from Yuan Xiu's side... Chi Zhiyun has been sidelined for the most part and cannot manage everything."

With a slight pause, he continued, "If I want my family to have a foothold in Yue State through the Azure Pond Sect, I need to build a few connections here. At the very least, I want us to be seen as dogs, not just fodder. This is a great opportunity—I cannot afford to miss it!"

Yang Xiao'er gazed at him with concern, her ordinary features brought to life by the tenderness in her eyes.

"But... Master's Yuan Family belongs to the Daoist Master Buzi's lineage. My family's status is delicate; we have never dared to form alliances. If you go through with this..."

Yang Xiao'er hesitated and the rest of her words were left unspoken.

The Yuan Family's ancestor made a mistake in his youth and was exiled from the sect. His time is almost up now, and their influence within the sect weakens by the year. If there were any favors left, Master would have already introduced me to the people of Tianzi Peak!

Li Xizhi understood her concern. Yuan Tuan had hinted at this multiple times in private, but it was not something he could say aloud. Instead, he simply assured, "Do not worry. Master is also on the peak."

Hearing this, Yang Xiao'er realized that Yuan Tuan must have had a hand in this as well, so she said nothing more and simply nodded in agreement.

Li Xizhi flew off from Qingsui Peak, his thoughts running through everything twice over. "Granduncle has gained the favor of a Daoist Master in Yi Mountain City, and he already has the Ning Family backing him... But Daoist Master Yuan Su always keeps to himself in Yi Mountain City, never meddling in sect affairs..."

Li Xizhi knew that the Ning Family held his own family in high regard, but he still did not consider relying on them as the best option.

If I can establish a relationship with Li Encheng, everything will fall into place. My family needs a voice of its own in the Azure Pond Sect. Afterward, we can align with the Ning Family in a cooperative manner, rather than becoming their vassals...

He understood the vast difference in status between them. After drifting in the clouds for a while, he descended in front of Fuchen Peak. A young Daoist boy from the peak approached and asked, "May I ask if the immortal seeks pills? What guidance do you require?"

Li Xizhi dared not act with arrogance. He cupped his fist and said softly, "Li Xizhi of the Li Family from Moongaze Lake, I am here to pay my respects."

He did not mention Qingsui Peak but instead came under the name of the Li Family, subtly implying that if he could not even get past this gate, he might as well give up and leave.

The Daoist boy went up to report, and soon the clouds and mist of the formation parted. Li Xizhi landed on the peak and saw the ground covered in a crimson hue, not knowing how many fire veins lay buried beneath it. Jagged boulders were scattered about, and the palace ahead stood tall and proud, resembling a massive cauldron.

He entered the great hall respectfully. Seated at the head of the room was a tall, thin old man in white robes, his frame gaunt. He was holding a white jade wine jug, drinking to his heart's content.

Upon seeing Li Xizhi, the old man frowned deeply and spoke bluntly, "The Li Family..? I have never had dealings with your clan. What business do you seek with me?"

Li Xizhi noticed the man's impatience and his heart sank. Still, he kept his tone humble and deferential as he said, "Xizhi greets Peak Master. I have heard that a Mount Yue cultivator from Moongaze Lake often gathered precious herbs for you..."

Li Encheng paused for a full breath, then finally remembered, "Ah, yes... that is true."

Li Encheng's thin cheeks twitched as he frowned and drank. Li Xizhi continued, "That Mount Yue cultivator recently broke through to the late stage of Foundation Establishment Realm and became quite arrogant. A few days ago, he intruded upon my family's territory and was slain by my family in alliance with the Yuan Family. I have come to inform the Peak Master of this matter."

"And I thought it was something important!"

Li Encheng had nearly forgotten about this person. The smell of alcohol hung heavy around him as he waved his hand dismissively and said, "So, he is dead. It makes no difference, really. At most, it will just take a bit more time to find more herbs. You did not need to make this trip... Now, go back!"

Li Xizhi quickly responded, "My family feels deeply remorseful and wishes to make amends to the Peak Master..."

"Oh?"

Li Encheng then took a slow sip of wine, his eyes narrowing into a smile as he asked, "How do you propose to make amends?"

Li Xizhi kneeled and respectfully replied, "My Li Family resides by the lakeside, with Mount Dali behind us, the great desert to the west, Xu and Zhao States to the north, and the sea to the east. We have many opportunities to acquire various spirit treasures. If the Peak Master has any needs, my family would be honored to handle them on your behalf!"
