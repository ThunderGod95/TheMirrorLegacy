# Chapter 857: The Ghoul Corpse

A furious roar, like a clap of thunder, shook the air. The two demonic cultivators who had rushed forward to assist were stunned by the sound. In the next instant, a staff shimmering with crimson light and a dazzling, illusory aura smashed toward them.

Boom!

The two cultivators were lackeys from the Eastern Sea and were completely outmatched. The one on the left, slightly better equipped, barely managed to summon a shield-shaped Dharma artifact. The staff struck it, and with a hiss, yin energy evaporated and the stain of blood qi dissipated. The artifact let out a piercing hum, and the cultivator spat out a mouthful of blood as he plummeted from the sky like a falling star.

The other cultivator was even weaker and didn't even possess a Dharma artifact, yet he had still charged forward to curry favor. The staff struck him square in the chest, punching a hole the size of a bowl clean through him.

He had only come to make an appearance and never imagined his opponent would be so ferocious. As the crimson light of the Palace-Yang Tiger art washed over him, searing his organs with pain, he abandoned all other thoughts and fled into the distance.

Although the bodies of demonic cultivators were resilient and many parts could be sacrificed, two strikes had been enough to wound two Foundation Establishment Realm experts. Daoist Bai gasped in shock.

'This man is terrifyingly strong!' he thought, his heart pounding. 'Such power… I've heard he's an expert with both long and short weapons, and this is just his staff. The legends of Situ Mo and Li Zhouwei can't be much more than this!'

Terrified, Daoist Bai raised a token in his hand. A black-and-white light instantly enveloped him as he began to chant a rapid incantation, desperate to escape.

Fortunately, Ding Weizeng didn't press the attack. He simply held his staff and watched the two demonic cultivators scramble away, making no move to pursue. Instead, he planted himself firmly in front of the Hall Master of the Hall of the Locust Soul.

'This piece of trash… was actually chosen by a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist tradition!'

Ding Weizeng was a natural warrior, his reputation forged through years of battles in the east and purges in the west. He didn't need more than a single glance from his specialized ocular arts to size up the man before him. He was filled with utter disdain.

He had heard that this Daoist Bai was the successor to the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition and was favored by someone from the Purple Mansion Realm, which granted him a certain status. Otherwise, Ding Weizeng would have smashed him to death with his own staff. To be challenged by such a worthless opponent was a deep insult, and his eyes turned cold.

Cui Jueyin, standing nearby, was far more cautious. His attention wasn't on Daoist Bai, but on Ding Weizeng. He feared that his hot-headed companion would cripple the man in a fit of rage, which would jeopardize their affairs in the north. He kept his hands ready, a Dharma seal poised at his fingertips.

In an instant, Daoist Bai's rage and lingering hope were extinguished. He finally understood the gravity of his situation.

'What in the world is Guan Gongxiao's group doing?' he fumed internally. 'This was a perfect opportunity to humiliate the Li family, and they couldn't even delay them on the river? They just let them through! Useless fools!'

The Palace-Yang Tiger, the Eternal Brightness Steps—either one of these arts could suppress his Locust Shade Ghost. Worse, the Eternal Brightness Steps had a binding effect that now posed a direct threat to his life.

'I need to get some distance!'

As a spell art flashed in his hands, Daoist Bai's figure vanished and reappeared a short distance away. But before he could speak, he saw that the battlefield had descended into a chaotic melee.

The puppet crafted from Situ Biao's body had been formidable in life, but its power had diminished significantly after being refined into a Dharma artifact. While its Geng Metal nature was somewhat resistant to True Fire, the yin energy it possessed became a critical weakness. Restrained by the flames, it couldn't advance an inch. This, in turn, freed up Li Minggong to fend off the demonic cultivators on another flank.

Chen Yang had also drawn his sword. He practiced the Jing Dragon King immortal foundation, a foundation well-known in Jiangnan, and had no trouble tying up several enemies. Qu Bushi and An Siwei were less powerful, managing only to fight to a standstill against cultivators of a similar level.

Meanwhile, Li Jiangqian, cloaked in apricot-yellow flames and wielding a golden hammer, relentlessly pursued the demonic cultivators. Whether he could actually defeat them was beside the point; no one was foolish enough to challenge the head of the Li family, and they all scrambled to get out of his way.

Yet Li Jiangqian was not reckless. Though he appeared to be charging about with abandon, he never strayed far from Cui Jueyin. His sharp eyes scanned the crowd, as if searching for someone.

Soon, his gaze fell upon a young man among the demonic host.

The man was dressed in black robes and had only just reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, but the Dharma light radiating from him was not faint. He stood quietly amidst the other cultivators, taking no part in the battle.

Most of the demonic cultivators had achieved their status in the Eastern Sea; nine out of ten were old men who had relied on blood qi to make a lucky breakthrough into the Foundation Establishment Realm. Their various cultivation techniques had left them grotesque and twisted. In this assembly of freaks and monsters, a handsome, youthful figure was impossible to ignore.

Li Jiangqian didn't approach. He noted the young man standing with his sword, then swiftly retreated, committing the face to memory. A sense of caution rose within him.

'The Hall of the Locust Soul is not as simple as it seems,' he thought. 'I must not get entangled here.'

While Li Jiangqian was probing the enemy lines, Daoist Bai had used his spell arts to create an opening. He surveyed the battlefield, his face turning pale with rage.

Although the Hall of the Locust Soul had superior numbers, their quality was appalling. Devoid of loyalty, they simply milled about, slacking off. As a result, almost no one was descending to conduct the search, and a chill crept into Daoist Bai's heart.

'And on top of that, there's Ding Weizeng and Cui Jueyin. With those two here, it's like sending tigers into a flock of sheep…'

However, the thought of the Abyssal Gloom Medallion he possessed eased his fears. Unless a Purple Mansion Realm master appeared in person, his life was not in danger. The sting of Ding Weizeng's insults and the searing heat from his opponent's Dharma light still burned, so he turned his attention to Cui Jueyin and forced a smile.

"We were merely sparring," he said. "We've already exchanged a move or two. Your clan's Lady Minggong is truly a hidden talent! To think she has cultivated her Dharma Arts to such a profound level!"

Ding Weizeng's face remained a mask of stone, his large hands gripping his staff as if he might bring it crashing down at any moment. Cui Jueyin, however, caught a look from Li Jiangqian and clasped his hands in response.

"The Wilderness have been under my family's protection for generations," he stated calmly. "This is no place for you to search. Your Hall should find another way. If our two families come to blows, I fear it will only benefit those with ulterior motives."

"Indeed!"

Cui Jueyin had offered him an escape. Having witnessed the power of Ding Weizeng's staff, Daoist Bai had become much more compliant. He nodded eagerly, shot one last, resentful glare at the ground below, and turned to leave without another word.

The demonic cultivators below were masters of opportunism. They hadn't dared to fly down during the standoff, and now they scrambled to retreat faster than anyone else, following their leader's lead.

They had only gone a short distance when they ran into the cultivators of the Sacred Writ Gate. Daoist Bai was too ashamed to even look up. As he hurried past, a streak of light shot across the river—a disciple in black robes.

The man was covered in blood and looked utterly defeated. He flew before them and cried out in anguish.

"Hall Master! Esteemed sirs! The treasury in Baiku Prefecture… it's been breached! Someone broke in, and all the treasures and Dharma artifacts we've collected over the years have been stolen!"

"The thief was incredibly stealthy and powerful… With all of you away, your subordinate was powerless to stop him!"

The words struck Daoist Bai like a bolt of lightning. "What?!" he roared in disbelief.

Baiku Prefecture was rich in spirit mines and located near the territories of the Midong clans, making it a vital stronghold. Nearly all of their spiritual resources and Dharma artifacts were stored there, guarded by Protector Black Rat himself, one of their eight great protectors. The news sent a surge of shock and fury through him.

"Black Rat!" he bellowed. "Where in the blazes is that useless creature!"

The man in black shook his head, his voice filled with sorrow. "Reporting to you, sir… Protector Black Rat was the first to notice the intrusion. He and Wang Bakong, the County Governor of Baiku Prefecture, gave chase together. But to their surprise, although the culprit was only at the Qi Refining realm, his escape technique was astonishingly fast. He got away!"

Daoist Bai had just suffered a humiliating defeat, and now he had lost his most valuable treasures. His mood, already foul, plummeted. He was so enraged he saw black spots before his eyes. "Worthless trash!" he cursed. "Two Foundation Establishment cultivators! One at the early stage, the other at the mid-stage, and you let a Qi Refining whelp escape!"

"Do you know who it was?!"

Seeing his master's fury, the man trembled. "He's a rogue cultivator from Baiku Prefecture. He assaulted the young master of the Wang family a while back… but was rescued by Bai Yinzi, another rogue cultivator from the great desert. We never imagined those two would join forces and return… to steal everything…"

Hearing that the culprits were merely two rogue cultivators, Daoist Bai erupted. "Find them!" he shrieked. "Return with me at once! I don't care if we have to tear Baijiang Creek apart stone by stone, we will find those two!"

As he roared, the Abyssal Gloom Medallion at his waist pulsed with a soft, iridescent light that shone brightly even in the pouring rain, its glow captivating and mesmerizing.

When his tirade ended, he turned and saw that while the cultivators around him wore expressions of respect, their eyes burned with a renewed, feverish intensity.

The sight, combined with the memory of his encounter with the Li family, caused his frustration to boil over.

'When we were attacking the Golden Tang Gate and looting their mines, they were all tripping over each other in their eagerness, desperate to strip Situ Biao's corpse bare. They even fought amongst themselves over the spoils. But here in the Wilderness, they stand around like wooden chickens, slow and useless! In front of the Li family, they act like meek little grandsons!'

'And now they hear a Qi Refining cultivator has plundered an entire prefecture's worth of treasure, and their eyes are gleaming. It's obvious they're already plotting how to claim it for themselves!'

This mob of demonic cultivators was nothing but a rabble. They would fight when there was profit to be had, but without it, they would do nothing. They were just local warlords. The so-called eight great protectors weren't the strongest among them, merely the ones closest to him…

Today, Daoist Bai finally decided he could no longer afford to be stingy. "Those few who fought by my side just now," he announced in a cold voice, "return to the Hall with me. You will be handsomely rewarded!"

The three cultivators he indicated were overjoyed. The rest of the disloyal horde, as if on cue, began to moan and wail. Some clutched their arms, others their legs, all claiming to have been injured in the fray.

A few, however, stood silently in the crowd, their expressions unreadable. But their eyes kept darting to the Abyssal Gloom Medallion at Daoist Bai's waist, a mixture of naked greed and deep apprehension in their gaze.

'What could that person have stolen?' they wondered. 'What could possibly make him so desperate that he's willing to offend Moongaze Lake… to ignore a power backed by the Purple Mansion Realm and insist on searching their land?'

## The Wilderness

Li Jiangqian watched the last of the demonic cultivators retreat. Below, the various families of the Wilderness stared up at the sky. His golden eyes swept over the landscape as he fell deep into thought.

'This person was rescued by our family after crossing the river, and then a battle breaks out in the Wilderness… I wonder what scheme this is a part of… and whether that powerful figure from the north is involved. In any case, we must handle the situation in the Wilderness with extreme care.'

If it was Lin Feng who had killed Daoist Bai's men and taken something of value, then their family had formed a favorable bond. However, Lin Feng remaining in the Wilderness was not a good thing. The more people who came into contact with him, the greater the trouble it would bring to their family. It was best to keep their distance.

But if it wasn't Lin Feng, and some other power was deliberately sowing chaos, or if it was an agent from across the river, then getting involved was even more dangerous. They would inevitably be dragged into the mire.

As he pondered, the other cultivators gathered around him. Ding Weizeng approached, his face grim. "Family Head, now that this matter is concluded, we must return to the river to provide support. Although the Capital immortals Dao has withdrawn due to issues in the north, we must remain vigilant in case they attempt a reckless crossing!"

Ding Weizeng harbored a deep loathing for the Capital immortals Dao and was always on guard against the north. Li Jiangqian seized the opportunity to agree. "I appreciate you making this trip, Protector Ding. Protector Cui, you will remain here. The situation by the river… will require your watchful eye."

Ding Weizeng departed on the wind. Cui Jueyin then stepped closer and spoke in a low voice, "Family Head, the Hall of the Locust Soul has crossed the river, and everyone saw it. The person we rescued is likely still in the Wilderness. How shall we proceed?"

Li Jiangqian exchanged a glance with Li Minggong. He had no desire to get any more involved than he already was. "Let us proceed with caution," he replied. "We don't know who or what he is. It is best we do not delve too deeply into this matter. Let him remain here, but let us not seek him out. That way, we avoid any potential entanglement. We have already done him a favor, and that is enough."

Cui Jueyin acknowledged the order, and the group departed. Before they reached the lake, they saw Li Xuanxuan standing in the rain, stroking his beard with an anxious expression. He looked as if he had been waiting for a long time. Li Jiangqian quickly relayed the events to him before having Chen Yang escort the old man back.

Soon, he arrived at the main hall. Li Que'wan was waiting inside, silently examining several jade slips in her hands.

Upon seeing Li Jiangqian, an anxious look crossed her face. "How did it go?"

Li Jiangqian shook his head. "It's difficult to say. Daoist Bai is astonishingly inept. Aside from that medallion, he is utterly useless, and the demonic cultivators under his command are a chaotic mess. It's a miracle he has managed to hold things together for two years without a single true confidant."

He took his seat at the head of the hall, his expression turning serious. "However, it confirms one thing: that Abyssal Gloom Medallion is no ordinary artifact. By itself, it is at least an ancient Dharma artifact, and who knows what other measures the Daoist Master who created it left within? For all we know, it could contain one or two Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities to save its owner's life."

"The great powers of the north may not fear it, but if we had pushed him into a corner, he might have unleashed it upon our family, which would have been disastrous. That is why I did not press him too hard and allowed him to withdraw."

Li Que'wan breathed a sigh of relief. "It is best to keep him as far away as possible. With no direct family members currently in the Wilderness, we can let them sort out their own mess."

"Indeed," Li Jiangqian sighed. "I noticed a few capable individuals among his followers. I suspect trouble will find him sooner or later. The man is a walking plague; fighting him would only dirty our hands. It was wise to send him on his way."

After hearing this, Li Que'wan's expression grew worried again. She placed the jade slips on the table. They were dark and appeared to be quite old. "While you were out with the protectors and guest elders, someone arrived from the river," she said softly. "He claimed to have been sent by Li Quantao, who is stationed at Lake Xian. He brought these and wished to ask for the family's counsel."

Li Jiangqian's suspicion was piqued. "What did he say? Where is the messenger now?"

"He is still on the island," Li Que'wan replied, a hint of resignation in her voice. "Li Quantao is guarding Lake Xian, which is close to several river mouths. A few days ago, his men spotted a suspicious group. They detained them for questioning, and to their surprise, the group claimed to be from the Hall of the Locust Soul!"

"Naturally, the guards at Lake Xian didn't believe them. No matter how pathetic the Hall of the Locust Soul is, its members should at least carry identification tokens. So they inspected their storage bags to verify their identities, only to discover that these people practice the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition from Xiaoshi Mountain!"

Li Jiangqian listened, deep in thought. Li Que'wan continued, "Only then did the group realize the trouble they were in. They were brought before Li Quantao and, upon interrogation, revealed that they were all descendants of the lost legacy of Xiaoshi Mountain. They had heard that the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition was experiencing a revival, that someone held a token from a Purple Mansion Realm expert authorizing the establishment of a new Daoist tradition recognized by all the major sects. They had come all this way to pledge their allegiance."

Listening to the story, Li Jiangqian felt that something was amiss. After a long moment of contemplation, he asked, "Could they be the real thing?"

Before Li Ximing had broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, there had been three major powers in Jiangbei: the Floating Cloud, Dense Cloud, and Brahma Cloud. In reality, these were false Daoist traditions established by several Purple Mansion Realm masters as bait to lure out the surviving descendants of Xiaoshi Mountain and locate a hidden treasure. The plan had succeeded, drawing out a few individuals and allowing the Chengyun Gate to acquire what it needed for the subsequent events in the subterranean palace.

As he expected, Li Que'wan nodded, sharing his suspicion. "The Xiaoshi Mountain Daoist tradition was scattered far and wide; there was more than just one or two lost branches. The Chengyun Gate only managed to bait a couple of them. There must be others. It seems the major stir caused by that powerful figure in the north has led these overseas branches to believe the rumors. They genuinely think the Hall of the Locust Soul is the true successor to their Daoist tradition, enjoying the patronage of some great power."

The situation was unexpected, yet perfectly logical. Li Quantao, unaware of the history, had become wary. With Qian Lizi away and unable to contact Ning Wan, he had sent the matter to them at the lake for a decision.

'They managed to remain hidden overseas for so many years without being discovered, only to be caught while crossing Lake Xian,' Li Jiangqian thought with a mix of amusement and annoyance. 'For Li Quantao to stumble into a mess like this, he must be getting in over his head.'

His actions were clearly biased; the seals on the jade slips had been broken, meaning anyone could read them. Adding them to the family library would be a gain. But these people had traveled thousands of miles from overseas. What role did they play in the grander scheme of things? Now was not the time to get involved with such unknown factors.

Nearby, Li Minggong picked up one of the jade slips. "Does the Old Master know about this?" she asked quietly.

Li Que'wan seemed puzzled by the question. "The old master was waiting for you all to return outside the lake," she said hesitantly. "So, he doesn't know yet."

Li Jiangqian, however, understood Li Minggong's meaning. The old master already felt a great deal of guilt over the Ning family's manipulation of Li Quantao in their scheme to acquire the Hongxue inheritance. With the Daoist Master now missing and in increasing danger each day, the fact that Li Quantao was still focused on Moongaze would surely sadden him.

He paced back and forth in the hall for a few moments. "What of these cultivation techniques?" he asked.

Li Que'wan's expression was complex. "Most of them are techniques we already possess. However, there is one that is… interesting. It's called the *Huai River Ghost Yin Refining Art*. It uses a cultivator's remains to craft a Dharma artifact. The spell must be cast before the moment of death to preserve the corpse and prevent it from dissolving into spiritual energy. It is a highly sophisticated art, but… it has very specific requirements for one's immortal foundation."

She slid one of the jade slips forward for them to see. "Not just anyone can refine this type of artifact, and an individual can only ever refine one. The finished product is called a Ghoul Corpse. It is best refined by a cultivator of the 'Hurricane Ghost Yin'. Failing that, the next best options are 'Upper Shaman', 'Xiukui', and 'Baleful Qi'. At the very least, one must be from the Ancient Merging Dao Lineage… Most others have no chance of success."

Li Minggong took the slip and glanced at it. Se didn't even need to read it; the description alone was enough. "It sounds thoroughly sinister. This must be the technique Daoist Bai used to refine Situ Biao…"

Li Que'wan nodded gravely. Seeing the look of understanding dawn on Li Jiangqian's face, she continued her deduction, "This proves, at the very least, that Daoist Bai is not entirely without resources. He must possess a number of authentic Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition techniques. The question is, where did he get them?"

Li Jiangqian nodded. "He did annihilate the Brahma Cloud Cave. It's possible he acquired them then. After all, his pretext was that Pingwang Zi was refining infants and had defiled the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition, and that he was merely dispensing justice… it could very well be some kind of demonic art…"

"But what if he didn't get them from the Brahma Cloud Cave…"

Li Minggong thought back for a moment. "I saw Situ Biao's Ghoul Corpse emerge from the Abyssal Gloom Medallion ," she said in a low voice. "Either that artifact is capable of storing such an item, or the Dharma Art itself comes from the Abyssal Gloom Medallion !"

Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan both suspected the latter. Li Jiangqian paused, ensuring no Purple Mansion Realm masters were eavesdropping, before speaking in a grave tone. "If the art truly comes from the medallion, then Purple Smoke Gate must possess a significant collection of Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition techniques. This whole affair, this artifact… it might not have been a hastily contrived plan based on my words, but a meticulous, long-term plot. My casual mention of the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition played right into their hands."

"When you think about it, it's not so strange. The most renowned tradition in Jiangbei is the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition. It has been built up by various Purple Mansion Realm masters over the years. From Foundation Establishment cultivators down to the mortals in the street, everyone knows the name of Xiaoshi Mountain. Even if I hadn't been the one to mention it, anyone looking to raise a banner in Jiangbei would have thought of Secret Diffusion. Only Secret Diffusion has that kind of credibility!"

He lowered his voice further. "In other words… it's likely a consensus was reached on this long ago. It was always going to be Secret Diffusion. Qian Lizi mentioned that each time they arrive, new secret realms and grotto-heavens are left behind. Perhaps this time, it will be the Secret Diffusion secret realm that descends…"

His voice grew deeper, heavy with implication. "In that case… could it be that the Abyssal Gloom Medallion is not some temporary, counterfeit item… but a genuine, paramount treasure capable of opening the lost treasury of the Secret Diffusion Daoist tradition!"

Li Que'wan's expression grew taut. Her eyes met Li Jiangqian's, and in that shared glance, four words surfaced in both their minds:

'An Immortal Mirror fragment!'
