# Chapter 1216: Yin-Leap

"Western Shu... has sent Qing Jifang to lead an army against the Long region. I hear... a Great Daoist Master has appeared, and more than one at that."

"The Zhao State has deployed Zhu Kui of the northern immortal sects, and Wei Xuanyin... has also made a move!"

Wind and sand billowed over the great desert as a crimson-robed youth paused atop a glittering golden formation base, his gaze distant and thoughtful as he looked to the north.

"Such a grand display. Even Wei Xuanyin has taken action. It seems they're truly intent on waging a full-scale war!"

A cold sneer touched his lips.

"Could it be that after watching Yang Ruiyi achieve victory after victory in the east and reclaim Jianghuai, he simply couldn't stomach it any longer and had to score some achievements of his own?"

But in Li Jiangqian's view, while Qing Jifang and Yang Ruiyi appeared to have similar standing, they were in fact two very different kinds of people, with vastly different circumstances.

'Yang Ruiyi might not be what you'd call a hero, but at the very least he's tolerant and magnanimous, gracious and not given to cruelty... Qing Jifang is a far cry from him in that regard!'

The Great Song was now the undisputed orthodoxy. No matter how high True Monarch Taiyi's cultivation was, he was still just a junior. His methods in this regard showed a clear gap when compared to the Underworld's, and the more one looked at Western Shu's current state, the more it resembled a minor kingdom content to rule its own small corner.

"All in all, this is a good thing... The fiercer the fighting in the Long region, the greater the damage to Western Shu. By the time their war is over, they'll likely all be wounded, and they'll be that much weaker when they come to the lake."

After a moment of contemplation, Li Jiangqian said:

"Is there any news from Mount Qusi?"

At his words, Ding Weizeng shook his head, leaving Li Jiangqian to sigh and say:

"Keep a close watch on the situation."

He immediately dispatched someone to the Golden Feather Sect to inquire about matters in the north, then rode the wind from the great desert, crossed over the lake, and headed due north until the scenery began to change and a majestic mountain rose into view.

It was none other than Tangdao Mountain!

Li Jiangqian landed on the mountain and, feigning the use of a divine ability to scan the area, called out:

"Is General Situ here? Changli has come to pay a visit!"

In response to his call, a young man soon emerged from the mountain, bowed deeply, and said:

"Reporting to the Daoist Master! My master entered seclusion long ago..."

"Oh?"

Li Jiangqian's golden eyes swept over him casually as he asked faintly:

"And who are you? Has General Situ entered a death seclusion?"

"This humble one is Situ Xu. In answer to the Daoist Master, my general has indeed been in seclusion for a very long time..."

Li Jiangqian was only feigning his inquiry; in truth, his spiritual sense had already activated Spirit Probe, pouring down to see through the majestic mountain before him with perfect clarity.

'The cave dwelling is empty. There's no Situ Huo here at all!'

'He isn't here... he might not even be in Jiangnan!'

With a flick of his sleeve, he rode the wind away, his mind already turning with calm calculations.

'Scheme or not, at this point, it's highly probable that Situ Huo will not be coming back.'

That being the case, Li Jiangqian's path naturally continued east through the Great Void, over the dense network of rivers below, as an immortal mountain rapidly grew larger before him.

'The Capital Immortals Dao!'

That was right. The person he was looking for was none other than this Daoist Master Yehui—Bai Ziyu!

Bai Ziyu was not an especially famous figure, nor had he done anything earth-shattering in the conflict between north and south, but that was only because the Daoist Master was secretly planning to switch sides at the opportune moment and naturally hadn't been exerting his full effort.

Though Li Jiangqian understood that Yehui was only concerned with his own path to the Dao, it was precisely because of this that there was no room for their two sides to remain in opposition.

"The lightning and flame at his command, even his various spell arts, are no common things. I hear he even possesses a Spiritual Treasure. If I could gain his full support, he would be no less valuable than Situ Huo."

The gate of the Capital Immortals Dao was not particularly conspicuous on the Jianghuai plains; or rather, besides Tangdao Mountain and Xiaoshi Mountain, Jianghuai had no strategic terrain to defend, and years of war had left the land desolate and the people destitute.

Li Jiangqian descended upon a wave of fire, only to see an armored figure treading on purple water already waiting for him, who offered a slight bow and said respectfully:

"Greetings, Your Highness... The Daoist Master is already waiting inside."

One sweep of Li Jiangqian's spiritual sense told him this was merely a type of guard condensed from mystical energy, but the Capital Guard were skilled in this art, making it appear quite lifelike, so he smiled impassively and said:

"The Daoist Master knew I was coming?"

The guard replied respectfully:

"When my master saw the Western Shu forces moving on the Long region, he knew Your Highness would come and specifically ordered me to wait here."

Li Jiangqian praised him inwardly while stepping nonchalantly into the mountains, where he saw a small Daoist temple, sparsely populated; indeed, there was barely a soul on the entire mountain aside from a few handymen sweeping the courtyards and one or two stewards.

"Your Highness has arrived!"

A figure emerged from the main hall, a remarkably young man with bright, lively eyes full of warmth, who approached as if greeting a close friend and said softly:

"I've been busy gathering qi these past few days, and I was worried Fellow Daoist Zhaojing wouldn't welcome my presence, so I've put off visiting the lake. Instead, I've made Your Highness come to me. It is truly negligent of me."

"You're too kind, Daoist Master!"

Li Jiangqian looked him up and down for a moment and said with a smile:

"Why is there no one around... Are you short on disciples...?"

Yehui shook his head slightly and said quite naturally:

"I don't mind if Your Highness finds this amusing... In the past, I bothered with this Capital Immortals Dao first to find a path for my juniors, and later merely to carve out a territory for myself and scheme from the shadows... But now, Gongxiao has gone to the Song court and I have joined the Bureau of Immortal Rites. There's no longer any need for the trouble. A servant or two is all I require."

"Fellow Daoist Gongxiao... I remember him."

Li Jiangqian smiled, a peculiar glint in his eyes, but Yehui said no more, simply leading him to a seat in the hall and stating quietly:

"I already understand why Your Highness has come."

His eyes watched Li Jiangqian with a cryptic gaze.

'Straightforward.'

With a man as calculating as Yehui, Li Jiangqian didn't need to say much for him to understand what was needed most... and since Daoist Master Yehui wasn't wasting words, Li Jiangqian saw no need to be coy either, smiling as he said:

"In that case, Fellow Daoist, name your price."

His golden eyes burned with a light that seemed utterly cold.

"I want you to act with your full strength... not one bit less will do!"

Yehui rose and clasped his hands behind his back in contemplation, his eyes filled with confidence as he said softly:

"On that, Your Highness need not worry. As long as your esteemed clan can meet my conditions, I, Bai, will certainly not disappoint you... To put it bluntly..."

He said with a smile:

"If we're talking about a real fight, in the entire Song State right now, besides King Wei, there isn't a single cultivator with three divine abilities that I would deign to notice."

Li Jiangqian hadn't expected such confidence, and his estimation of the man rose slightly as he asked:

"In that case... what is it that you require, Daoist Master?"

"Creeak..."

The doors to the great hall suddenly slammed shut as a formation activated, sealing the interior from the outside. Li Jiangqian instantly grew wary, and Yehui's smile slowly faded as he said softly:

"I, Bai... wish to refine a Mystic Pill, but I am missing a particular spiritual qi. I have searched the heavens and the earth for it to no avail. After much consideration, I believe this item resides within the 'Supreme Yin,' so I can only turn to your clan."

"Oh?"

Li Jiangqian remained wary, but he only shook his head slowly.

"Senior Yehui, why would you say such a thing?"

Bai Ziyu watched him with a smile and said softly:

"Moongaze Lake is the former domain of the Immortal Mansion, and the great lord of the fox-kin has innumerable ties to it. Whether your clan possesses it directly, received it from the fox clan, or even happened upon it while searching for Supreme Yin spiritual items for King Wei, I want only this one stream of spiritual qi... and nothing more!"

Seeing Li Jiangqian shake his head, a slight smile touched Yehui's features as he said:

"There is no need to be so guarded against me, Fellow Daoist. From the time Fellow Daoist Zhaojing accepted the karma of the Profound Peak Gate to the endless wars between north and south that followed, I have always held one conviction: your clan and I are not enemies, nor will we ever be."

Li Jiangqian shook his head, laughing despite himself as he said:

"I can't imagine what kind of spiritual qi... would have you searching so desperately, Senior."

Yehui personally refilled his tea and said:

"It certainly couldn't be the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance—I'm not that arrogant. This particular stream of qi, an intercalary qi of the Supreme Yin, is a common thing in the world, merely rare in recent ages. Traces of it could still be found some years ago, but it's not the sort of thing that will simply fall from the heavens when you suddenly need it."

He said quietly:

"It's called... Yin-Leap Qi."

"Yin-Leap Qi?"

A flicker of light passed through Li Jiangqian's eyes as his expression shifted slightly.

The reason was simple: this qi was a key ingredient for the Azure Step Flawless Pill that Li Ximing had obtained from the Chunyi Dao Gate!

The young man was suspicious by nature, and at these words, he was struck by the premonition that these events were connected, his heart trembling slightly.

'That's right... those three pill formulas were produced by the Chunyi Dao Gate itself. Is it possible... that Yehui heard about it from them?'

'No... their positions make it almost impossible for them to be allies. If this was a test, why provide three formulas? Besides... Yehui has no reason to go to such lengths just to test me...'

He kept his expression neutral, suppressed his inner doubts, and said with a frown:

"Yin-Leap Qi?"

Yehui had been observing his expression, so he nodded and replied:

"This item is both rare and common. It is said to be released when a Clear Yin Womb Herb divides, and the amount produced each time is actually quite substantial... In ancient times, it wasn't considered precious, and many Daoist traditions kept a stock of it. It is only uncommon now because the Clear Yin Womb Herb itself has become scarce."

Li Jiangqian listened to its origins, committing the information to memory, his mind wary and calculating as he sipped his tea in silence.

But Yehui continued in that same cryptic tone:

"I imagine King Wei's injuries healed much faster than those of an ordinary cultivator. This isn't my own conjecture, but a consensus among all under heaven. The Li clan, with the backing of the foxes, may not be able to produce the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance, but they certainly don't lack for other Supreme Yin spiritual items."

In truth, both men were clever. Li Jiangqian understood that his father would eventually emerge from seclusion, and that something would be off—either his cultivation or the timing of his return. The fact that their family did not lack for Supreme Yin spiritual items could not be hidden forever.

'It's merely a question of to what extent we "have" them... In truth, with the Elucidating Profundity Bestowed Jade Method, my sister can brew him a whole pot of this stuff to drink like tea...'

He gave a bitter smile and shook his head, saying:

"Since you've spoken so frankly, Daoist Master... I shall be frank as well. The problem doesn't lie there. Firstly, I'm not sure if we even have this item; I would have to ask. Secondly... this isn't fundamentally about a rare spiritual qi, but about the trouble of asking someone else for yet another favor..."

Li Jiangqian's solemn expression and complex gaze made Yehui's heart sink slightly; in fact, he didn't need to say anything more, as that small hint was enough to send the Daoist Master into deep thought.

'So he really has to ask someone else... this complicates things...'

As experienced as Yehui was, how could he not understand Li Jiangqian's meaning?

'The item isn't in the Li family's hands. Its value is irrelevant; the cost of having the Li clan ask the foxes for a favor likely exceeds the value of the Yin-Leap Qi itself... For various reasons, he can't tell me that outright...'

Of course, Yehui had no way of knowing if this was true, but in his eyes, the truth didn't matter. He wanted the Yin-Leap Qi, and his most direct path to it was the Li clan. Besides this lakeside family, what other power would dare claim they definitively possessed a specific Supreme Yin spiritual qi? If Li Jiangqian insisted this was the situation, what difference was there between truth and fabrication?

His expression showed no hint of displeasure or doubt; instead, he contemplated for a long while before saying:

"In that case... when can Your Highness give me an answer?"

Li Jiangqian, however, had no intention of agreeing so hastily. He hesitated for a moment before saying softly:

"I must first report this matter to my elders, and only then can I begin to search for traces of this item. It is not something that can be resolved in half a year, yet the storm in the west is about to break..."

Li Jiangqian had a clever tongue, always trying to gain the upper hand first, but Yehui was not like Chen Yin; this Daoist Master's expression remained composed as he smiled and said:

"There's no rush. I will naturally do my best regarding the situation in the west."

'As for how much effort... that depends on my family's sincerity, doesn't it?'

Both men were cunning and understood each other perfectly, and Li Jiangqian said with a smile:

"If this doesn't work out, my family will certainly do its best to compensate you, Daoist Master!"

Yehui nodded with little enthusiasm, but Li Jiangqian stood up, his gaze fixing on the other man's face with a look of great interest as he said:

"However, I have a question of my own for you, Senior."

"Hm?"

Yehui's greatest fear was having no leverage over the other party, so these words made his eyes light up faintly as he watched Li Jiangqian flick a sleeve, revealing a token lying in his palm.

The object was a deep, lustrous azure, made of a peculiar and beautiful material, inscribed with five mystical runes and a single, brilliant point of golden light at its center. It was clearly no common item.

Li Jiangqian gave him a smiling glance and said softly:

"Senior, you gave this and half of the Cloud Capital Dao-Entry Secret Manual to my father all those years ago, but you have yet to explain what it is!"

"As I expected..."

A smile finally touched Yehui's expression, along with a hint of emotion. The Daoist Master had been waiting here all this time for the Li clan to come and ask him about this important matter, but he hadn't expected Li Zhouwei's grave injuries to delay it for so long!

'If it weren't for the pressure from Western Shu, Li Zhouwei would likely have healed his injuries and come to pressure me himself!'

Regardless, the Li Jiangqian before him was easier to deal with than Li Zhouwei, so he naturally had no objections, shaking his head with a smile as he said:

"King Wei understands my intentions. This item is the key to Chuyi Heaven! During the great conflict between cultivators back then, I used this very item to enter... The Wuguan Legacy, the great treasures of Encompassing Profoundity—it's all in there!"
