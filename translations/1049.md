# Chapter 1049: Deceit

A faint crimson still pulsed on the horizon as the sun went down. The lavishly dressed Demon beast turned, clutching his magnificent cloak for warmth, and looked at the Daoist Master beside him.

"Daoist Master Chi, would you consider this man a fiend?"

Chi Buzi glanced back at him, his expression placid, almost matter-of-fact.

"He's all bluster and no substance. A pathetic, despicable whelp—nothing more than a petty demon."

The Demon beast smiled.

"Isn't that perfect? My subordinate only used a divine ability to influence the woman; all of his actions stemmed from his own heart, from the inherent evil of the Bright Yang. In my eyes, that's more than enough."

"He serves a purpose. He can lend a hand with matters that Minghuang has no time for."

'Minghuang... that’s Li Zhouwei…'

A strange and unsettling feeling, tinged with suspicion, crept into Chi Buzi’s heart. The Demon beast’s expression remained serene as he studied Chi Buzi closely.

"I am Dingjiao, the White Flood Dragon of the Clear Seas and Serene Pools, Inheritor of the Azure."

Chi Buzi took a sip of wine.

"So, you are the White Dragon's crown prince. I am Chi Buzi, a rogue cultivator."

Of course, Chi Buzi had heard the name. Dingjiao was a prodigy of the White Dragon clan, a direct descendant of the Dragon Monarch himself. His bloodline was pure and noble, making him one of the most distinguished members of the Hornless Dragon lineage.

Dragons were by nature licentious yet utterly heartless. They would mate even with their own kind, including siblings, though such unions rarely produced offspring. In contrast, their liaisons with various Demon beasts were far more fruitful, though most of these children were treated as mere servants. Only the few with a pure bloodline earned the right to be called a Dragon Prince. Take the Demon King of Xu Water—in truth, he was a noble Demon Perch and a son of Dragon King Beihai, yet he was forced to call a pure-blooded heir like Dingjiao 'master'!

'Moreover, he’s a descendant of Dongfang You, which makes him a direct heir of the Dragon Monarch. If the Dragon-kin succeed in their great undertaking, his status will skyrocket. He could very well ascend to a golden throne himself one day!'

The Daoist Master slowly averted his gaze, making a subtle swallowing motion. 

"I see only a pitiful villain. The Bright Yang Fruition Attainment influenced Li Zhouwei, and by extension, it has influenced his son. This is an undeniable fact. Why go to such lengths to prove it?"

The Dragon Monarch shook his head, his expression unreadable.

"It's not that simple. From a Daoist perspective, Minghuang was favored by the Fruition Attainment, so it’s natural he would develop a Bright Yang temperament. But he is a man of profound schemes, his true nature hidden behind a facade. He is also unbound by divine abilities, so who can truly know what he is like? My elders have always felt his humanity outweighs his Metallic Essence, making it difficult for him to achieve the Dao…"

"They tried to test him, but they failed. Still, there’s no need to test him directly."

The Dragon Monarch smiled.

"What a father keeps silent, his naive young son will surely speak aloud. The sons of this world carry their fathers' secrets, and they expose them unwittingly, forcing the fathers to confront their own ugliness. This is what you cultivators call the Sin of the Yang Cusp."

"So, we just need to test this Li Jiangnian. If he truly possesses that Bright Yang evil, how could his father be free of it?"

Chi Buzi fell silent, though a new question arose in his mind.

'The Dragon-kin are testing Li Zhouwei to gauge the possibility of the Bright Yang. It's a brilliant move, certainly, but what does it have to do with me? I have no claim to the Bright Yang position, nor do I have any connection to the Li family. Why tell me all this? It’s as if he thinks I’m one of them…'

Dingjiao, however, shook his head.

"But my father still dislikes it. He always worries… after ascending to that position… he will be a True Monarch. How can he be manipulated? It’s far too uncontrollable… But I see things differently."

His pale blue eyes flickered as he smiled.

"I am certain the prophecy will be fulfilled, and I believe my Dragon-kin must ally with these True Monarchs…"

Hearing this, a shadow of gloom finally fell over Chi Buzi.

"Oh?"

Dingjiao stated flatly,

"However… whether it’s my father’s opinion or my own, we are both in complete agreement regarding the Great Daoist Master's matter."

A cold, mocking smile spread through Chi Buzi’s heart.

'Agreement? How could they not agree? Forget you Dragon-kin, even Pristine Water is in full agreement… Who wouldn't want to lure out that Feathered Serpent's Metallic Essence? The only one no one cares about is me… I’m just supposed to die quietly in a corner. Am I supposed to agree to that as well?!'

The Dragon Monarch stared at him, seemingly reading the emotion in his eyes. He let out a soft sigh.

"There are some things Li Zhouwei cannot spare the time for, nor can he necessarily contact the person behind him. It would be difficult for me to discuss this with him… But discussing it with you, Chi Buzi, is it not the same thing?"

He turned his head, his pale blue dragon eyes fixed on Chi Buzi.

"Great Daoist Master, am I right?"

Chi Buzi’s eyes narrowed instantly. A thick fog of confusion filled his mind, but his natural talent for deception kept his face a dark, unreadable mask. He said nothing, merely taking a sip of wine before murmuring,

"I must admit my confusion. On what grounds does the Dragon Monarch make such a claim?"

His words brought a slight smile to Dingjiao's lips. Leaning forward, he said calmly,

"Back then, you were merely at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, still trapped under Lord Du's thumb, unable to act freely. Yet while he was in seclusion, you slipped away to Moongaze Lake. After that, your entire demeanor changed. You roamed the seas, often acting erratically, and then, for no reason at all, you broke through to the Purple Mystery—for absolutely no reason!"

His smile faded.

"Lord Du might not know about these things, but we Dragon-kin certainly do. If our high-ranking members hadn't been cleaning up your messes, do you think Lord Du became a True Monarch for nothing? Do you really think you’d still be alive today?"

Dingjiao's gaze turned icy, carrying a palpable sense of intimidation. The unspoken meaning behind his words was crystal clear.

'You went to great lengths to visit Penglai, presenting the Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch that appeared out of nowhere. You fabricated that grotto and led the Chunyi Dao Gate completely astray. We saw everything. We were the ones who cleaned up the mess for you!'

"Our Lord Du has never hesitated—he’d rather kill the wrong person than let one slip by!"

Chi Buzi lowered his head, eyes narrowed. His mind felt as if mountains were collapsing, yet it was also a complete blank, as if he had plunged into a bottomless abyss.

'Me? What did I do?'

Dingjiao’s attitude didn't seem like a bluff. A descendant of the Dragon Monarch had no need to deceive him with such baseless nonsense. Either the Dragon King before him was mistaken about something… or… the Dragon-kin had truly covered up some terrible misdeed for him, keeping it hidden from Pristine Water!

'Why do I know nothing about this?!'

But no matter how baffling his words were, no matter how desperately Chi Buzi racked his brain, his expression remained perfectly calm.

Dingjiao smiled.

"In all the world… which other family can produce a Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch!"

"The cultivation method was given to you by Lord Xuan'an, wasn't it? It was there, at Moongaze Lake, under the gaze of the Azure Insight Origin Mirror, that you received his guidance. Only then did you have your great awakening, gaining some unknowable benefit before setting out to roam the four seas!"

'Xuan'an… Who is that…'

The name was a complete blur to Chi Buzi. He didn't know how to respond, so he simply lowered his eyes and said nothing, allowing a complex look to cross his face.

Dingjiao waited. Seeing no answer, he continued in a level tone, "Don't worry. Now that Wei Xuanyin has placed the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal in your hands, it signifies the approval of the Profound Governance Pavilion, and by extension, Mount Luoxia. With our guarantee, even if Pristine Water discovers something, he still won't kill you."

A flicker of amusement appeared in his eyes. "But you are in the Pristine Pool, and Pristine Water is full of suspicion. How Lord Xuan'an will protect his schemes with you from under Pristine Water’s nose, how he will get the fox clan to contact you… that is his problem to solve."

Chi Buzi was no fool. After hearing these two sentences, the threads of a plot began to form in his mind.

'First… this Lord Xuan'an must be the True Monarch behind the fox clan…'

'And Moongaze Lake… it must be his territory. That’s why Dingjiao sees me as his man, whether it's a misunderstanding or the truth…'

'The Li family also has his shadow behind them—at the very least, this True Monarch wants that Li Zhouwei to achieve the Dao! And I, as the Great Daoist Master representing his interests, am being used by the Dragon-kin as a messenger!'

'In other words, in the eyes of the dragons, I am extremely close to Li Zhouwei. Li Jiangnian’s situation might involve some transaction or proof between two True Monarchs, and I am here as a representative. That’s why they invited me to watch this little show!'

His earlier confusion vanished in a flash. Chi Buzi finally understood why Dingjiao had sought him out. But as he uncovered this hidden truth, a chilling dread filled him, followed by the realization of his new reality—no matter what, he now had to be the man of this so-called True Monarch Xuan'an.

He raised his brows and said softly, "That is not something the Dragon Monarch needs to worry about."

Dingjiao just smiled, but Chi Buzi’s ambition swelled in an instant, filling his entire being.

What was the root cause of his distrust for the Dragon-kin? It was that they had no absolute need for him, and he lacked the backing to negotiate with them as an equal! If he could truly borrow the authority of a True Monarch—not to fake an alliance, but to genuinely join his side—then he still had a chance!

'The most urgent task is to investigate this True Monarch Xuan'an!'

His thoughts moved like lightning. He withdrew his hand, his expression inscrutable. "In that case, your noble lord must have known long ago that I intend to cultivate the Water Mansion."

His response was perfectly timed. Dingjiao chuckled. "How could we not know? The Water Mansion belongs to 'Azure Profoundity'. In this day and age, how many people have the ability to even touch it!"

This sentence sent another chill through Chi Buzi’s heart.

After his laugh, Dingjiao saw that he still didn't respond and sighed internally.

'Xuan'an's condition is truly poor… Moongaze Lake has the Azure Insight Origin Mirror, which prevents the other lords from prying. But Lord Tang is personally guarding the lake! That Qingyu Qian merely brought a member of the Department family into the lake for a moment, and that person was immediately exiled and destroyed… The defenses are airtight…'

As his thoughts raced, Chi Buzi looked up, cleverly shaking his head. "I see now," he said faintly. "Senior Zeng Zan's appearance today was not without reason. It was the crown prince who granted me this role."

Dingjiao laughed. "Zeng Zan is close to the Black Dragon faction. You could say this was granted to you by Guangfou."

At the mention of Guangfou, Dingjiao showed little displeasure. Unlike his father, Dragon King Beihai, this White Dragon prince was more ambitious and driven. Though he disliked the Black Dragon faction, he held a certain fondness for Guangfou and similarly hoped to draw more True Monarchs to the Dragon-kin's side. But his father’s command was difficult to defy… otherwise, he wouldn't have volunteered to come and test Li Jiangnian today.

Chi Buzi’s gaze shifted slightly as he watched him. Dingjiao spoke softly, 

"Lord Xuan'an was willing to bring out the Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch and place it in the hands of the Chunyi Dao Gate. My Dragon-kin saw this and were quite pleased. My lord was full of praise when he heard… saying that Lord Xuan'an has finally seen the bigger picture, made a sacrifice, and will no longer cling to his so-called pristine purity…"

Chi Buzi frowned, seizing the opportunity to ask in a low voice, "I am not entirely clear on this matter. I would ask for your guidance."

Dingjiao frowned slightly and said earnestly, "When Jiequn perished while attempting to attain the Dao, it already proved that there might be a problem with the Supreme Yin position. Yet everyone remains wary. Some unknown True Monarch specifically wrote a book, the Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity, and secretly slipped it into the legacy of the Chunyi Dao Gate… forging Jiequn's last testament to deceive them."

"This Supreme Yin Method for Seeking Profundity is indeed a breakthrough method, but its secret arts also point directly to the very root of the Supreme Yin. It uses the life-mandate of the Dao-seeker, combined with a spiritual item from the Supreme Yin Auxiliary Position, to resonate with the main position and probe the truth of the Fruition Attainment's master from within the Supreme Yin's haze…"

"The truth of a Fruition Attainment is normally impossible to see, but the original master of the Supreme Yin left behind a failsafe, locking one Auxiliary Position and keeping it illuminated so that future generations could ascend… It was this very failsafe that the method exploited."

The Dragon Monarch flicked his sleeve.

"Attaining the Dao through a spiritual item using this method can greatly advance the True Monarchs' speculations about the Supreme Yin. Once the Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch achieves its Dao and senses the Great Void, the truth will be revealed. Perhaps then, the matter of the Supreme Yin position will finally be settled."

The sky gradually darkened. Chi Buzi sat in his seat and said grimly, "Then what are you lords waiting for? And what do the Dragon-kin… need?"

Dingjiao answered quietly, "We wait for the world to be at peace, for the True Qi to be proven, for the True Dragons to appear, for the Bright Yang to fall, and for the Upper Shaman to return. Once all the great houses have settled their affairs and the lords have returned to their positions, Donghua Heaven will descend. The long-standing mystery of yin and yang must have a resolution. As for you…"

"Daoist Master, can you wait until that time?"

Dingjiao lowered his voice. "As for us… I don't know what plans the great one has for you, but my lord hopes… that you, Great Daoist Master, will accept this role. Once your divine ability is perfected, you will act as a hidden trump card for our Dragon-kin, ready to intervene in Jiangbei at the critical moment."

The Demon beast looked at him intently. "This helps you, it helps him, and it helps us."

Chi Buzi was silent for a long time. The figure before him had already dissipated like the wind. The colossal beast sank soundlessly into the depths of the sea, taking the vast, glittering palace with it, leaving not a single trace behind.

'Xuan'an… I must investigate him thoroughly…'

The bright moon hung high in the sky, casting its brilliant light upon the world. Chi Buzi stared at the empty surface of the sea as the turmoil in his heart slowly subsided. He watched the ebb and flow of the tide.

'But Pristine Water… is he really ignoring me?'

'Why would a being like him tolerate my actions… allowing me to join the Dragon-kin's camp without a care, unconcerned about a potential new True Monarch-level enemy in the future…'

'Is that even possible?'

He slowly lifted his head, his gaze fixed on the gleaming moon.

'Or… are Dingjiao and the Dragon-kin deceiving me, just like Pristine Water? Do they both have absolute confidence… that I will never succeed?'
