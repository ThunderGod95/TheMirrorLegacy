# Chapter 1229: The Golden Affair

Below, Qing Zhuo's expression was slightly awkward. He remained kneeling before the steps and only replied:

"After all… after all, he did make an effort. Since Your Excellency gave the word, saying it was fine to let him cause a ruckus, we let him be—the current situation was to be expected."

These words prompted the person inside to take a step, their voice cold as they spoke:

"He certainly has caused a ruckus… I never expected him to achieve anything great, but since he decided to take the position of an adversary, if not a Wei Xuanyin, he should at least be comparable to the likes of Qi Lanyan, so that our Qing Clan would not be disgraced… But what is this display now? If I were Li Zhouwei, I'd laugh my head off and find it beneath me to even consider him an enemy!"

"If he didn't have Mount Changhuai behind him… he'd be nothing more than a second Vast Cicada right now!"

Qing Zhuo bowed his head and said:

"Being a Vast Cicada is useful enough, as long as we don't let him perish too early…"

Evidently, though Qing Zhuo had affectionately called him 'Clan Uncle' at the foot of the mountain, acting as if he would back him in all matters, his heart was quite cold; the two, inside and outside the jade palace, were only concerned that Qing Jifang's loss was unseemly and had disgraced Mount Changhuai!

The person in the jade palace, however, no longer wished to speak of Qing Jifang, instead saying in a calm, indifferent tone:

"Golden Oneness's schemes are complex and are clearly unfolding layer by layer; it's best not to touch what can be avoided… lest we get drawn into their calculations again."

Qing Zhuo, however, was troubled and said in a low voice:

"But… but the Li Clan… has a Daoist Master of the 'Whole Pill'…"

As he mentioned this woman, an astonished light surfaced in his eyes, and he replied:

"The profound secrets about her are obscure. Observing her age, she is absolutely not over a hundred; it's even possible she's only seventy or eighty… If the Li Clan is willing to support her, with her cultivation speed, she has a chance at the Quest for Gold."

The person in the jade palace seemed to already know, but had not expected this woman to receive such a high evaluation from their own clan's genius. Qing Zhuo then said solemnly:

"What's more peculiar is… she is skilled in shamanic arts, and it seems she already has a formidable presence! Although she used ritual blood to cast her spell, and she is nowhere near the level of Duanmu Kui or Jiang Boqing, yet she has already surpassed Upper Shaman Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of the same cultivation level!"

He said softly:

"Could it be related to… that book."

Although he did not say its name, the person inside already understood his meaning and said indifferently:

"Impossible."

Qing Zhuo quickly lowered his head, but heard a hint of a smile in the person's voice as they said:

"You people don't know your own limits. The moment you see some shamanic arts with a bit of skill, you dare to associate it with Duanmu Kui… You're wrong. If that little girl truly had the 'Answers to the Beggar Beneath the Mulberry Tree' in her hands, and she got ahold of that bit of ritual blood while he had not learned a single defensive technique, do you know what the outcome would have been?"

"Back then, it wouldn't have been as simple as Qing Jifang losing his head! I'm afraid he would have turned into a pig or a dog on the spot, and if you reached out to save him, he would have tried to bite you with bloodshot eyes!"

Qing Zhuo frowned in disbelief as he listened to the other's cold sneer:

"Duanmu Kui dared to claim supremacy over the entire Jiangnan… Who do you think his opponents were back then? Zipei and Zimu were one thing, but even the boundlessly arrogant Lou Xing was defeated by his hand…"

"In his twilight years, he was unable to defend against the schemes from all sides and had to hide in Moongaze Lake, taking refuge with the Azure Insight Origin Mirror. He may have seemed miserable, but if he had truly flown into a rage, no one would have dared to stop him from storming the Azure Pond…"

This man seemed deeply moved, whether out of lingering fear or relief, as he said:

"Their Excellencies even suspected that he could deduce their identities despite their personal efforts to conceal themselves. That was why Xiao Chuting, who had hidden his Purple Mansion Realm cultivation for many years, used the untraceable 'Man on Creek' under Their Excellencies' concealment to destroy the 'Emperor's Mandate'. The benefits he gained have sustained him for over a hundred years, right up to this day. Otherwise, on what basis do you think he earned their compromise, and on what basis did his divine ability advance like splitting bamboo… His current cultivation speed is nearly on par with a reincarnated person."

The person inside said coldly:

"This little girl now likely obtained her Dao inheritance from the fox-kin. As for the 'Whole Pill' you mentioned, Golden Oneness is certainly worried, they just don't want to tear all face with the Li Clan, so they act unconcerned on the surface. Who knows what they're doing in secret? It's not as if they lack the ability to plot this woman's death discreetly and without arousing any suspicion!"

"Changyun's absence from that great battle—was that not also Golden Oneness's way of forcing her to go all out, to see her true abilities and caliber! Otherwise, with their deft political maneuvering, why would they not grant such a favor!"

Qing Zhuo nodded thoughtfully and replied:

"Then we…"

"No rush."

The person in the Profound Palace said indifferently:

"To have probed Golden Oneness and found that they harbor reservations is already a good thing. The appearance of the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass indicates that the White Qilin definitely has a way to suppress it; the rest is unimportant. As for this 'Vault Metal' that has emerged…"

"Your mention of the Dragon-kin was, in fact, incorrect."

His emotions calmed, and he finally said:

"Most affairs in the world cannot escape the discerning eyes of Shangqing. The so-called matter of Metal Virtue is merely a private affair being handled behind closed doors by the Shangqing and Yinghua clans. Don't think that just because the Wandering Metal has secluded himself from the world he pays no attention to anything—after that Liu Changdie appeared and confirmed the 'Vault Metal' Dao lineage, didn't the Wang Clan of the Wandering Metal immediately say they would retrieve the Sword Intent and send a junior down to investigate? They even made a special trip to Moongaze Lake; these things have long left their traces!"

"If the Dragon-kin hadn't given him that thing, we couldn't be bothered with this useless chess piece. Now that 'Vault Metal' has obtained the Profound Vault Invitation Letter, his Dao path has a chance of continuing, which is indeed a threat to His Excellency. But as for dealing with him, we'll wait for them to show their stance first."

His voice paused slightly before he continued:

"We'll wait for now. If Golden Oneness and the Wandering Metal don't make their position clear, then we will make a move. Whether to kill or to torture him then will be a matter of a single word."

...

Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

Spiritual qi surged and radiance glittered. A golden furnace rested amidst ethereal clouds and mist, its ivory-like, jade-white surface emitting a lustrous Treasure Light. Flames of interwoven red and gold danced slowly at the furnace's base, blooming with a profound and wondrous glow.

The Daoist Master in platinum-gold Daoist robes sat before the furnace, his slightly pale face filled with solemnity. His hands were pressed firmly on the edge of the furnace, his face beaded with sweat; he had clearly reached his limit.

The difficulty of refining this Supreme Yin pill far exceeded Li Ximing's imagination—one must know, for Li Ximing to refine a pill within this Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance secretly conformed to the receptive and storing nature of the Supreme Yin. In this regard, no place in the world could provide a greater augmentation than here!

Yet even though he had made all sorts of preparations and was augmented by the East Life-Mandate Vase, the various barriers within the process still made his progress arduous. Now that he was injured, it was even more difficult.

But Li Ximing had his own way of resolving this.

While struggling to maintain the flames, the Daoist Master reached out and summoned a small vial from a jade cabinet to the side. It flew to the mouth of the furnace, and a moonlight-like substance immediately poured out lightly.

Supreme Yin Moon Radiance.

Nourished by a spiritual qi of the highest order at such a critical moment, the restless furnace instantly calmed down. All the stagnant spiritual qi dissolved, and all the difficulties blocking his path dissipated at once. All the illusory Supreme Yin colors converged and condensed. Li Ximing raised both his palms and struck the furnace:

"Om!"

The furnace lid leaped up with a bang, yet there was no unusual scent or profound mystery, only gentle rays of moonlight rising from the furnace's mouth. Li Ximing took a step forward and raised his brow to look.

The inside of the furnace, by contrast, appeared pitch-black. There was only the faint light of a pill at the bottom, no larger than a fingernail, perfectly round, and of an indiscernible material. It emitted a hazy glow, wreathed in a faint white vapor, forming a stark contrast with the jet-black furnace, like a bright moon in the night sky.

'It's finally done!'

Li Ximing let out a long breath. He carefully took out a jade box, poured the long-prepared Mansion Water from within, and completely enveloped the pill. After meticulously nurturing it for eighty-one days, he then circulated his dharma power and gently scooped up this "bright moon in the water".

Only at this moment did Li Ximing catch a whiff of osmanthus fragrance that made the qi and blood in his whole body surge. Not daring to smell more, he quickly stored it in the jade box, first informing Li Jiangqian and the others with a jade talisman, before excitedly descending from the pavilion to the courtyard below.

The light here was dim. The small courtyard seemed to contain countless desert winds and was covered in blood-red sand. A young man sat cross-legged in the center with his eyes tightly shut, his entire presence golden. A ring of a fading sun wavered behind him, and the Sun-Surging Governing Stars on his brow was bright.

Although this King Wei was afflicted by calamity, he did not look like an injured or sick person at all. Accompanied by the constantly roaming radiance, he appeared formidably imposing. Li Ximing was only stunned for a moment before he came to a sudden realization:

'His 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' has also reached perfection!'

Li Ximing's guess was correct. Li Zhouwei had previously said that he would need another three to four years for his 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' divine ability to reach perfection, but that had been a conservative estimate; in truth, he achieved it even faster than he had thought!

Almost at the same instant Li Ximing's gaze fell upon his face, Li Zhouwei opened his eyes. Beneath the roiling, fading sun, a grayish-white gaze swept over.

But in the eyes of this King Wei, his grand-uncle's face was pale and his lips were purplish-red, like a patient in the dead of winter. He displayed the distressed state of one whose divine ability and dharma power were exhausted and whose injuries had relapsed, yet the light in his eyes was blazing with joy as he said:

"Minghuang, the pill is complete!"

"Grand-uncle…"

Li Zhouwei stood up, a glimmer of anger in his grayish-white eyes as he frowned and said:

"Who left these injuries? To torment yourself like this will damage your foundation!"

Li Ximing had been completely focused on refining this pill and hadn't paid any attention to the passage of time. These words startled him, and after a quick calculation with his fingers, he realized:

'I originally thought it would take one or two months, but counting the days… with pouring in the moon radiance and then nurturing it, I've actually been at this for over half a year! My injuries have been left untreated for half a year!'

And so he shook his head bitterly:

"I know myself… it was the work of that Danyin. He is a Great Daoist Master, after all. Even with a secret art to distribute the damage, it's still quite severe."

The joy in his eyes faded slightly. He sighed and continued:

"But what could be done? The pill refinement had reached this stage; not completing it would mean all previous efforts were wasted, and they would even take the True Fire. I couldn't stop even if I was injured… It's already a stroke of luck that I managed to complete the pill with the help of the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance. Without it, either the pill would have failed or I would have exhausted myself to complete it, suffering a great loss of divine ability and dharma power! This is already a good outcome… one cannot expect to both successfully refine a pill and go out to fight; there's no way to have it both ways."

He did not want to dwell on the matter and just smiled:

"The pill is complete. You can take it whenever you're ready!"

'Danyin.'

Li Zhouwei's expression darkened a shade, but he ultimately nodded and said:

"My 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead' has reached great completion and is several degrees stronger than before. My Dao-Profundity has also long since surpassed the Purple Mystery, but without accomplishing this 'Imperial Observation of the Origin', I am ultimately lacking. Let them run free for a few more years. I will avenge this for you, grand-uncle."

Li Ximing sighed and said:

"I only hope you will be successful!"

Li Zhouwei, however, was thinking about Li Ximing's situation and shook his head:

"It has been over twenty years since you achieved your second divine ability, grand-uncle, yet because of the constant pill refinement and fighting year after year, you've had almost no time for cultivation. Now that Jiangqian is out managing affairs, once your injuries have healed, please focus on your cultivation for a few years—consider it making early contact with your third divine ability, to achieve it a day sooner."

Li Ximing understood his own affairs well enough. Compared to Si Yuanli and the others who relentlessly raised their cultivation, his progress over the past twenty years could be called slow. He said no more on the topic, only smiling bitterly:

"That is a matter for later. For now, there is something I need to discuss with you."

He then spoke, recounting Yehui's words and actions from before and after, and also brought up the name 'Yin-Leap Qi'. Li Zhouwei listened to it all, appearing thoughtful and silently committing it to memory, before saying:

"'Yin-Leap Qi' isn't too difficult to acquire; it's not even considered a top-tier spiritual qi within the Supreme Yin. In comparison, our clan's 'Profound Minister Moon Essence' is actually more remarkable—it's just that with Que'Wan's current state, it's not appropriate to trouble her for him. This isn't something that can be resolved in the next few years."

"After all… resolving the calamity requires the help of her Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure—fortunately, as long as I remain in this heaven-and-earth, I am not bound by the calamity and can cultivate for the time being. I can afford to wait on all matters."

Li Zhouwei did not seem anxious, but the mention of Li Que'wan made Li Ximing uneasy again:

"The lake is undermanned, with only Jiangqian free to act. I can't just let him come and go between the lake and this heaven-and-earth. I just activated the jade talisman, and he couldn't even spare a moment to come in. I fear there's some trouble, so I should go out again before I tend to my wounds."

Li Zhouwei could only nod, saying seriously:

"Since you are going out, grand-uncle, you must ask about the Imperial Sun-March Sha!"

Since Li Zhouwei had already reached the level of the Purple Mystery, Li Ximing was even more anxious about the spiritual qi for this 'Imperial Observation of the Origin' than he was! How could he possibly forget? He naturally agreed. While drawing out the Light of the Six Harmonies to stabilize his injuries, he descended on a ray of light from the grotto-heaven, his figure materializing on the island in the lake.

He merely stepped out from the grand hall, crossing over several pavilions of the inner formation in a single stride, and materialized before the central grand hall. A figure was standing before the hall—a young man with an upright posture. It was Li Jiangqian!

The young man spotted him at a glance, his expression a mixture of joy and worry, but Li Ximing had no time for pleasantries and asked with concern:

"How is your sister!"

Li Jiangqian only turned slightly to the side and pointed at the hall doors. Li Ximing immediately understood. Activating Spirit Probe, he saw that the colors inside were deep and rich, with crimson and silver light flashing. A profound pool came into view, and although large, glazed-like patterns still appeared on it, it looked much more stable!

Li Wushao, who sat in the very center, also had a much better complexion. Daoist Master Cheng Qian was still seated by the pool's edge, his hands pressed on the rim as he channeled his divine ability, continuously stabilizing the profound pool's state.

Li Que'wan, meanwhile, stood in the air, a solemn expression on her pretty face. She held a crimson-silver Edict God pill in both hands at her center, gathering a massive amount of divine ability. Her presence had already climbed to its peak!

Only then did Li Jiangqian solemnly transmit his message via divine ability:

"Grand-uncle, we originally had some days before it would be refined into the Spiritual Treasure, but Senior Wushao was shaken and we could delay no longer. The two Daoist Masters urgently pushed the divine marvel to its peak. The 'Edict God' has already reached its most critical step…"

"Life or death hinges on this one step! If we can cross it, the crisis will be over. After nurturing the Spiritual Treasure with her body for three years, she will obtain its divine marvel!"

Li Ximing's heart also rose into his throat:

'No wonder he didn't come in to see me!'
