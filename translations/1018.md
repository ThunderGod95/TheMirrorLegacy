# Chapter 1018: Countermeasures

The moon was a brilliant, clear disc, its bright light flowing over the bronze steps. In the clouds, the eighteen hundred long stairs appeared solemn and cold. Below the vast immortal platform with its eight gates, people stood in small groups, conversing in low voices.

A Daoist Master in robes of midnight blue ambled up the steps. His face was round and his eyes were sharp, but his expression was unreadable. He walked all the way to the highest point before finally running into someone.

The man was a monk, with a fair, clean-shaven face and an imposing aura, a dot of gold lacquer gracing the space between his brows. He was descending the steps and came to a halt directly in front of the Daoist Master, blocking his path. With his palms pressed together, he smiled.

"Daoist Bai! It has been a long time."

The young man in the midnight blue robes was none other than Bai Ziyu, Daoist Master Yehui. He swept a placid gaze over the monk and replied, "So it is Daoist Vast Cicada."

Yehui had never been one to be trifled with. Seeing the man standing squarely in his way, he let a smile touch his lips.

"Why have you come to study Buddhism in the Profound Governance Pavilion? It seems the cushions in the dharma-realm are not as comfortable as the stone tiles of this pavilion, which have you pacing about day after day."

His words were pure sarcasm, veiled insults that struck precisely at a sore spot.

The Profound Governance Pavilion was the Great Zhao's center of command for immortal cultivators. Its predecessor was the Great Liang's Seeking the Purple Pavilion. Although the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch had fallen, the Dao Lineage of the Purple Terrace Profound Pavilion Sect remained. That particular Demon Monarch had despised Buddhist cultivators; any who entered the Seeking the Purple Pavilion, regardless of their cultivation level, were forced to stand. Yet, other cultivators, no matter how weak, were at least given a cushion to sit on.

The Profound Governance Pavilion had kept this rule. Even though Vast Cicada was a Maha, he still had to stand when he met Wei Xuanyin...

The face of Maha Vast Cicada immediately darkened. But Yehui wasn't finished with him.

"I see the Sparrow Carp Fish has gained some great benefit," he said casually. 

"You share his fame for no good reason, and now you can't stand it anymore, can you?"

Vast Cicada shot him a cold look. "What kind of pure Dao Lineage is mine? How can it be compared to that demonic fiend? The White Qilin possesses radiance, but the Peacock..."

Yehui cut him off with a laugh. "The Peacock? The Peacock's ancestor was the Yuwu bird, a Great Sage in its own right. If you were Li Zhouwei... I would have no choice but to nod at your words. But what are you!"

That sentence tore away all pretense of civility. The emotion on Vast Cicada's face quickly smoothed over into a calm mask. "Your words are far from pure, Daoist," he said faintly. "You should be careful."

Seeing that he had truly angered the man, Yehui didn't provoke him further, merely offering a cold, silent smirk.

Vast Cicada was, after all, the most prominent and fastest-progressing Maha in the Great Adoration Dharma Realm in the last century. His own Capital Guard Dao Lineage was ill-suited for fighting a Maha; if it came to blows, he was truly no match. Yehui sighed inwardly.

‘The Capital Guard Dao Lineage is indeed wide open, but it has far too many vulnerabilities... A pity. For someone like me with no background, once I received this lineage, I had no choice but to walk this road no one else is willing to take.’

In the span of that thought, Vast Cicada had already departed with a flick of his sleeve. Yehui scoffed, took two steps up, and passed under the gleaming plaque of the Profound Governance Pavilion. As he entered, his eyes fell upon a large, bright silver cauldron in the center of the courtyard.

A man stood beside the grand hall, clad in a silvery, feather-like robe. His eyes were long and narrow, and his five fair fingers rested on the cauldron's edge, gently stirring the shimmering water within. Seeing Yehui approach, he turned his head and smiled.

"Ziyu, you've arrived."

Yehui hurriedly bowed with a smile and stood to the side. Wei Xuanyin chuckled and shook his head.

"Arguing with the Buddhist cultivators again. I've told you before, your Capital Guard has ties to the Radiant Qi. If something major were to happen, you could always side with the Buddhists... You are burning your bridges."

Regardless of the power dynamics in the north, Wei Xuanyin had always treated Yehui well. Bai Ziyu simply shook his head.

"I have no desire to ferry him to salvation, so he should not try to ferry me."

Whether it was an act or a genuine sentiment, Wei Xuanyin’s eyes showed a flicker of admiration for the backbone it took to say such a thing. Yehui quickly changed the subject, his tone turning serious.

"The Changxiao Gate has been annihilated, and Cheng Yan has fallen. Li Zhouwei also injured Shilou Yingge in the grotto-heaven, and that fellow didn't even bother to feign his duties any longer, fleeing straight back to the lands of Qi... Li Zhouwei has an increasing number of Spiritual Treasures now, and the typical three divine abilities are no longer enough to suppress him... Although we have four mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivators stationed here, we fear the Buddhist front is now vulnerable with the Sparrow Carp Fish gone. I have come on Lord Qi's orders to request your arrangements."

"The Sparrow Carp Fish."

Wei Xuanyin's expression became somewhat complex upon hearing the name. "They still underestimated the one behind him," he said. "He is, after all, a descendant of a Great Sage. He cannot be compared to the likes of Riju Yuezhu, but he can stand shoulder to shoulder with Weiming Weixi. As for those like Dongfang Tianye, they are fit only to be his stepping stones."

He was clearly aware of Li Zhouwei's situation well before Yehui, but his face still held a trace of lament. He shook his head.

"Li Zhouwei is different from the rest, which isn't strange. As for his growing number of Spiritual Treasures, that's even less surprising. Fate favors him. With a single breakthrough, the number of spiritual items in the Li Clan's hands was bound to multiply."

Although Wei Xuanyin cultivated the Veiled Yin, he was far calmer than Zong Chang. There was no malice in his tone as he asked softly, "Were the casualties high?"

Yehui shook his head, a matter he knew well. "The Li Clan's rule is strict. There were very few casualties, limited only to the Changxiao Gate."

Wei Xuanyin nodded. "The Bright Yang Dao revolves around the principle of 'I am the Monarch-Father.' He has his own logic for acting as such. He demands absolute loyalty and selflessness from his subordinates, isolating them from personal gain and self-interest. The Monarch-Father's authority reigns supreme, giving rise to loyalty and filial piety devoid of selfishness... Back then, Gongsun Yang and Qu Yi were cultivating in the mountains, but they were still dragged out by Emperor Wei to serve him loyally. It is the same principle."

"And this so-called selflessness ultimately serves the Monarch-Father's most tyrannical private desires... But at the very least... at least the common people are useful to the Monarch-Father's conquests, which makes things slightly better."

Bai Ziyu nodded along, though the last sentence made him frown inwardly. Hailing from the Eastern Sea, he found it difficult to grasp Wei Xuanyin's meaning.

‘What use is that? He is in charge of the Profound Governance Pavilion. Can he really say something that sounds like a subtle approval of the Bright Yang Dao?’

He prudently remained silent. Wei Xuanyin, however, stopped abruptly and began to ponder.

"As for Cheng Yan..."

"Emperor Wei's influence in suppressing the world cannot be erased. The Undefeated King of Brightness was a blood descendant, but the Metallic Essence he obtained was not Emperor Wei's. At best, he as a fake White Qilin. Yet with his divine abilities, he could make the Helian clan cry monster. When fighting a Bright Yang practitioner, if you can suppress them, they are easy to handle. But if they suppress you, it's nearly impossible to turn the tables, save for a few specific Dao Lineages. Cheng Yan's death was not unjust..."

"Even if he had escaped to the Eastern Sea, he would have met his end there. It's no wonder Changxiao didn't save him."

Yehui frowned slightly. "What do you mean by that?"

Wei Xuanyin smiled. "Everyone at the top knows about what happened in the grotto-heaven back then. Ping Yan of Yinzhou Island, the Purple Mansion Realm expert who works for the Dragon-kin, was once given a promise. If he could obtain that True Qi, the Dragon-kin would grant him a great opportunity."

"Though Ping Yan knew his chances were slim, he made careful preparations. To his surprise, his fortune was deep, and he actually encountered that True Qi—only for Cheng Yan to ruin it all. That is a grudge deeper than the murder of one's own parents!"

Yehui silently took this in, then asked, "Then, what about Changxiao..."

Wei Xuanyin stirred the water, watching as white runes floated to the surface. 

"The Yang family presented him with such a golden opportunity," he said faintly. 

"The Upper Rite was practically a match made in heaven for him, yet he refused to cooperate. If he truly had his sights set on Fruition Attainment, he would have joined forces with the Yang family long ago to help them gain leverage at court..."

"His leaning towards our side shows he isn't seeking Fruition Attainment. He already has an enemy related to attaining True Qi and intends to achieve his Dao in the Zhao court. He was considering slaughtering the Deer Weeds before he left, clearing out the area and destroying the Li Clan's foundation in the Eastern Sea..."

"Oh?" Yehui's brows furrowed. "Did he make a move?"

Wei Xuanyin smiled. "He waited in the Qunyi Archipelago for a while, but there were thunderstorms day after day. I believe Dongfang Heyun kept him occupied with tea, dragging things out until the Changxiao Gate was destroyed... The Dragon-kin have meddled again."

"They certainly have the gall to stoop so low!"

Seeing Changxiao's misfortune, Yehui couldn't help but feel a sense of schadenfreude.

"With Li Qinghong achieving her Dao through lightning, the Dragon-kin have a convenient excuse," he praised.

"You're mistaken." Wei Xuanyin shook his head. "It's not that simple. Li Qinghong's situation was an accident. I suspect someone was protecting her, but she holds little sway. Do you think the Dragon-kin are benevolent? The world thought they would be the first to kill Li Zhouwei. Though they have spared his life for now, it's a hollow gesture. The condition is that as long as the powers on the mountain do not protect him, the Dragon-kin will not make the first move."

"The dragons of the Eastern Sea do not harm him because they know that pushing him into the hands of the North will force someone to test the mountain's reaction... They are merely watching from the Eastern Sea, observing how much room the North has to maneuver and how much control the mountain still has over the entire northern region."

His expression was placid. "This is a dress rehearsal," he stated. "To see how many people harbor their own ambitions. On the day the heavens truly erupt in conflict... how many variables will arise in the North without the suppression of a great power from the mountain?"

"As for the Qunyi Archipelago... its preservation is thanks to Liu Changdie."

Wei Xuanyin smiled with keen interest, his gaze still fixed on the characters gradually forming in the cauldron.

"I think that fellow has figured it out by now. Before, no one bothered him because those key Encompassing Profoundity Grotto-Heavens still needed people, still needed variables. Now that the greater situation is settled, no one likes variables, so his position has become precarious."

"On the contrary, he has more freedom overseas. Firstly, several positions the Dragon-kin require are related to Encompassing Profoundity, so protecting him is undoubtedly a good thing. Secondly... the Dragon-kin are also in a passive position now. With a variable in their hands, who knows when they might turn the tables and seize the initiative."

Wei Xuanyin's expression turned serious. "Do not underestimate Changxiao. He also factored in the variable of Liu Changdie. Whether through secret scheming or a direct agreement with the White Victory Dao, his timing was impeccable. At that moment, trouble was brewing in the Western Sea. If Liu Changdie had been forced to move, the Qunyi Archipelago would not have been saved either."

Sudden understanding dawned on Yehui. He lowered his head in thought before turning the conversation back. "But if that's the case, our arrangements in Jiangbei..."

Wei Xuanyin waved a hand dismissively, scattering the profound script on the water's surface. "Gongsun Bei is in Jiangbei with a Spiritual Treasure in hand. You have nothing to fear. As for the Buddhist cultivators, I will have a word with them..."

Seeing his nonchalance, Yehui took the opportunity to test his own idea. "I have also seen that White Qilin," he ventured. "It does not seem particularly demonic."

Wei Xuanyin turned to face him, his expression slowly growing grave. "Have you heard of the Sovereign's Perilous Tread?" he asked in a low voice. "To counter the demonic nature of a Bright Yang practitioner, you must consider the Bright Yang divine abilities. Of that, there is no mistake."

"As his divine abilities grow and he fully aligns with the Bright Yang, he cannot be judged by common sense. To deal with him, you must constrain him, hold him, and obstruct him at every turn before he can act. If you let him catch his breath and charge, the Sovereign's Perilous Tread will be unleashed. Unless I personally intervene, no restrictions will work. There will simply be another Cheng Yan."

He spoke in a haunting tone, "I will remind them. If the Buddhists underestimate him, they will bear the consequences themselves."

### Moongaze Lake

The sky was bright, the lake's surface shimmering. Streaks of pale white light zipped across the heavens as cultivators rode the wind in an orderly procession. A pillar of purple and gold reached from the earth to the sky, a magnificent immortal spectacle.

Li Suining stood quietly in a high pavilion, looking up with raised eyebrows.

‘King Wei has returned...’

Waves of clouds parted in the sky, revealing a colossal golden ship that moved like a great beast through the heavy sea of clouds. It unfurled itself under the sun's light, its deck lined with figures in impeccable jade armor. From its divine temples and crimson palaces, tier upon tier and room upon room, a magnificent brilliance shone forth.

He stared at the massive golden vessel. Beside him, an old man stood silently, his gaze filled with reverence as he looked to the sky. Li Suining let out a heavy breath, his voice tinged with disbelief.

"Elder Du... Did Daoist Master Cheng Yan... truly fall at Changxiao?"

Du Dou quickly bowed. "This servant only heard it from His Lordship's own lips, so I cannot vouch for its truth. But that is the news that came... The cultivators who were present said that in Helin Prefecture... the sky was filled with earth and rock, and the roads were buried under several feet of debris, blacker than ink! Baleful energy was erupting from the ground, and the soil was so saturated with it that you couldn't even squeeze it into a ball... If anyone walked on it, they would sink right in, and they'd fall ill after climbing out..."

"We old fellows were gossiping, and we thought it over... This must be what the death of a Daoist Master looks like."

Li Suining's own Dao-Profundity was not low. He nodded as he listened, already eighty to ninety percent convinced.

"He was truly slain!"

In his past life, the Chen family had made a move, and while the Changxiao Gate was still destroyed, Cheng Yan had either been warned or had some method to escape. He vanished without a trace, whether to the Eastern Sea or with Changxiao, never to be heard from again.

This dissonance between his past and present lives filled him with emotion, and he sighed.

"The clans of Helin would record it thus: 'In the late spring of the fifth month, the Celestial Gate's radiance suppressed the nine heavens. Suddenly, mountains collapsed and the earth split, raining down a torrent of rock and soil. Baleful energy erupted from the ground. When one looked out, the roads were buried under feet of dark earth, slippery as grease... Thus it was known that Cheng Yan had been executed.'"

Du Dou only half-understood, but it didn't matter. He simply tucked his hands into his sleeves and said respectfully, "The young master's words are absolutely right."

Just as he finished his flattery, a clear, calm voice drifted through the pavilion.

"The young master is in quite a poetic mood."

Li Suining whipped his head around to see a man standing in the pavilion. He was dressed in black, with wide, long eyebrows and slightly narrow eyes that revealed gray-black pupils, a fierce glint in their depths.

He stared intently into Li Suining's eyes, his own gray-black ones filled with a probing, evaluative light. He smiled faintly and spoke in a low voice.

"I am Chen Yang. I have the humble honor of serving the Daoist Master. I have been in seclusion for a time... I imagine the young master does not recognize me..."

Li Suining's gaze held a strange light as it lingered on the man's gray-black eyes, then slowly traced down his form before he replied.

"So it is Guest Retainer Chen. I have long heard of your great name... We are both of Qingdu blood. Senior, there is no need for such formality!"
