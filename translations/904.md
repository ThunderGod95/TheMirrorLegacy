# Chapter 904: Wei Xuanyin

Luoxia Plain.

The sky was grim and overcast. Sword light ebbed and flowed. A man in black robes stood quietly in the gloomy wind, a bronze sword in his hand.

Brilliant light still streamed from the bronze sword, as if it had just sundered the Dharma Body of some Merciful One. Its radiance was blinding. Swirling dust and pulverized light drifted before him, and the sound of cracking earth and stone rose from all directions.

He held his ground, dark winds swirling around him. Not far away, Daoist Master Zhusheng stood with his sword held horizontally, suppressing a whistling, unceasing crimson-purple light.

Kui Qi's expression was calm, his gaze frigid. On the other side, Ning Wan was even more silent.

The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had already wagered all its forces in this great battle.

Besides herself, Ning Wan, there was Tinglan of the Purple Smoke Blessed Land; Kui Qi and Houfu of Xiukui; Yushui of the Chen Clan; Zhaojing of the Li Clan; Zhusheng of Shahuan; Daoist Master Luo of the Southern Borderlands; Che Hong of the Chunyi Dao Gate; Hengxing's friend, Kuang Yu; and even Lingmei of the Sword Gate!

Even Zhu Gong, who had traveled far overseas, had rushed back and was waiting silently at Xiaoshi Mountain to assist Tinglan.

'If there's a next time, we'll never be able to gather a force greater than this!'

When everyone had first charged into this place, their momentum had been unstoppable, and they had heavily wounded Zhelu. But the Luoxia region was right under the nose of the Zhao State; it was naturally the first place to receive reinforcements. In a flash, the enemy had arrived.

They had expected enemies. Neither Kui Qi nor Ning Wan had ever thought they could just take advantage of the north and leave. But the sheer number of foes arriving one after another was far beyond their expectations...

The most conspicuous was the enormous Golden Dharma Body before them, towering into the clouds, its radiance blinding. It had taken four Purple Mansion cultivators working together just to suppress it, causing the entire plain to flash with divine abilities, bathing the land in brilliance and churning dust.

Cultivators of the Way of Compassion usually manifested with large bellies, but this Golden Dharma Body was different. It was hunched over, stooping low. Despite its infinite magnificence, it looked like a crooked old man, bent at the waist. Attached to its arms was a vast, towering golden mountain. This mountain was covered in lotus blossoms and gold, filled with high monks chanting sutras and disciples seeking knowledge. They sat cross-legged or hovered in the air. The mountain itself was massive, and the people on it were as small as ants, numbering in the untold millions. It was as if the body carried an entire Buddhist Kingdom on its back—a truly magnificent sight.

This Buddhist Kingdom connected heaven and earth, linking directly to the infinite Buddhist Land. Tens of thousands of streams of light descended from the sky, empowering the monks on the mountain. This power then transferred to the Maha's Dharma Body that carried it, seeming to condense into solid reality.

The Seventh-Generation Maha of the Way of Compassion—Beigu.

His waist was bent extremely low. The face looking down at the earth was filled with guilt and unease. But the Golden Dharma Body had another face on the back of its head, growing from the *fengfu* acupoint and nearly reaching its neck. This face wore an expression of compassion and pity, gazing quietly and with a slight smile at the golden mountain on its own back.

With Murong Xia having achieved the ninth reincarnation, linked with the Dharma Master, and no longer leaving the Buddhist Land, this man, Beigu, was now the most revered Maha of the Way of Compassion. He was also the fastest-cultivating Maha in history. Even the renowned Maha Jinlian, famous for his innate talent, was far inferior to him in terms of promotion speed.

His path was even stranger. He seemed to be nurturing a Buddhist Land of his own, one that was tightly bound to the Way of Compassion. The radiance of this Buddhist Land was incredibly strong, impossible to sever, and possessed immense power.

He alone held off the combined assault. Even after reinforcements arrived to break the siege, four cultivators—Ning Wan, Che Hong, Houfu, and Yushui—had to remain just to keep him contained. His Dharma Body wavered and he spat golden blood, yet the two faces on his head, bowed so low it nearly touched the ground, remained unchanged: one compassionate and pitying, the other guilty and uneasy. He was not moved in the slightest.

"What a formidable Buddhist Kingdom."

Houfu watched the Maha, his expression grim. A wondrous object in his hand flew up, connecting to a brown spirit-pouch in the air. A thick ray of Supreme Yang light streamed down, pouring onto the enemy's protective Treasure Light.

In his hand was Xiukui's Spiritual Treasure, the Supreme Yang Radiance Treasure Pouch. As both a Spiritual Treasure and an artifact of the Supreme Yang Dao, it excelled at exorcising evil and vanquishing demons. Even Buddhist cultivators who were struck by its light would feel as if burning coals had been dropped on them, making it impossible to resist.

But as Maha Beigu bathed in this Supreme Yang light, he only seemed slightly restrained. His dharma power did not recede, nor did his divine abilities dissolve as they usually would... It showed no sign of exorcising evil at all.

This was an extremely awkward situation. Even Che Hong, standing to the side, frowned secretly.

On another side, Buddhist chanting echoed in the air. Daoist Master Lingmei of the Sword Gate, holding the Great Snow's Severing Edge, wore a glacial expression. Facing him were three Mahas: the sixth-generation Zhelu, the third-generation Taixi, and the first-generation Nuzi.

The sixth-generation Maha Zhelu, his body covered in eyes, was undoubtedly the most miserable of the northern faction. He was riddled with holes, and more than seventy percent of his eyes had been stabbed to pieces. If he hadn't joined forces with Taixi and Nuzi, with Merciful Ones supporting them in formation, he likely would have already fallen to Lingmei's assault.

Leaving aside that battlefield of whistling sword-qi, Daoist Master Kui Qi, grasping one of his Dharma swords, was also under immense pressure. The man facing him was cloaked in a Profound Yellow Qi, his expression fierce. It was the Touba Clan's Daoist Master, Touba Ci. He wore a tall cap, a wide sash, and shimmering feathered robes. His cultivation was also at the mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, and the Spiritual Artifact in his hands was a great halberd, which he wielded with exquisite and imposing skill.

The Touba Clan had fared the best among all the imperial lineages, even managing to preserve their Grotto-heaven. As descendants of a Golden Core ancestor, their Daoist tradition was naturally not much weaker than Xiukui's. With two Merciful Ones supporting him from the side, Touba Ci even held a slight advantage.

Meanwhile, Daoist Master Zhusheng wielded his Jade True sword. Beside him stood a pale-faced female cultivator in light blue robes—Hengxing's friend, Daoist Master Kuang Yu. The two of them were jointly battling a demonic cultivator wreathed in roiling white qi, whose Daoist tradition was impossible to identify...

Ning Wan swept her gaze across the battlefield, taking it all in.

'The Helian Clan's cultivators aren't here... The enemy clearly has a comfortable grasp on the situation. We still don't know where Helian Wumeng is. It's even possible Helian Wujiang has come as well...'

Caishan's forces shouldn't have been able to stop Li Ximing, but there was still no word. Someone must have intervened to reinforce them. The fact that no new enemies had arrived from the east was already a testament to Li Ximing's best efforts.

Ning Wan wasn't completely ignorant about the situation in the north, but she couldn't compare to Kui Qi in terms of detailed intelligence. Ever since Kui Qi had specifically sent Tinglan to give Li Ximing a Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, and then redeployed Daoist Master Luo, who was supposed to be at Xiaoshi Mountain, Ning Wan had a premonition. The pressure on Li Ximing's side would be immense. She just hadn't dared to say it... At this point, who *wasn't* under pressure?

Things had come to this, and she still didn't know what Kui Qi was thinking. She didn't know what other cards the north had to play, nor how such precise intelligence had been personally delivered from the north into Kui Qi's hands. Which northerner had secretly leaked the information? Regardless, there was no longer any path of retreat.

'Waiting in the formation is just sitting here to die. These Purple Mansion cultivators won't stay on guard with us forever. The only way is to fight with all our strength!'

But that was far easier said than done.

The golden body, prostrated on the ground and carrying its golden mountain, remained motionless, enduring the siege of four cultivators. The mouth on its downturned face opened and closed, releasing a calm, majestic, thunder-like voice:

"Benefactors! You have achieved great divine abilities but lack the root of wisdom, making it difficult for you to enter the Buddhist Land. My Dao does not wish to create needless killing karma. I hope you will retreat quickly, surrender the Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain, and return what belongs to our Buddhist Land!"

The voice spread, carrying a pure and peaceful light that dispersed the divine abilities converging on it. Daoist Master Che Hong of the Chunyi Dao Gate had an ugly expression. The Supreme Yin radiance in his hand dimmed as his face filled with hatred.

The Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain was, of course, Tangdao Mountain. To lose it was to lose Jiangbei. These terms were utterly unacceptable. Beside them, Daoist Master Yushui, Chen Yin, didn't even bother to reply; he simply struck the golden body with his sword.

*BOOM!*

The clash of dharma power in the air sounded like rolling thunder, one crash drowning out the last. Kui Qi's expression was grave. A Spiritual Artifact at his waist flew up to defend against the opponent's attack. Finally, a white light flashed in the sky, blanketing the area in endless white fog, and a crimson rain began to fall.

*Splash, splash, splash!*

The crimson rain fell like a waterfall, quickly overwhelming the natural rain clouds. It pelted the earth, and the agitated raindrops transformed into silky threads that leaped up, clinging to the robes of every Daoist Master.

Kui Qi started, then his face lit up with joy. The expression of the Touba Clan Daoist Master, however, instantly turned foul.

'The Spiritual Treasure Heavenly Balance Mystic-Governing Cloud...'

Sure enough, just as the thought crossed his mind, the crimson rain had already coated the sleeves of every allied Daoist Master with a protective radiance. Two figures, a man and a woman, descended from the clouds. The woman held a parasol, an expression of resignation on her face. The man trod on fire, his eyes wide with rage.

'The Hengzhu Dao is here!'

It was Hengxing and Hengli!

The Hengzhu Dao had claimed they would not interfere, but in the end, they couldn't bear to stay away. Hengxing had a sharp tongue, but a soft heart. Faced with such a crisis, she had first asked her friend Kuang Yu to come. Still uneasy, she and Hengli had been waiting in the Great Void all along.

The range of the Heavenly Balance Mystic-Governing Cloud was vast. As a Spiritual Treasure of the Hengzhu Dao, its invocation arts empowered them, and the morale of the southern cultivators surged.

How could Hengli possibly restrain himself now? He was a man with thick brows and large eyes, dressed in a narrow-sleeved robe with a wide lapel, its hem embroidered with 'Li-light' runes. He flicked his sleeves, and dense swarms of crimson talismans erupted. Stretching out his hands, he seized two long sabers from the Great Void. His eyes immediately locked onto Zhelu's group of three as he laughed.

"You three bastards, your grandpa is here to beat you to death!"

The trio's faces changed instantly. Zhelu was already injured, and it was taking all three of them just to hold off Lingmei. The longer they fought, the more sword wounds they accumulated, and their situation grew more precarious. Hengli was famously belligerent; how could they possibly withstand him?

Normally, given their personalities, they would have turned to flee the moment the Hengzhu Dao appeared. But they couldn't just escape. They could only exchange a silent glance, resolutely gather the light in their hands, and brace themselves to defend their ground, waiting for death. Their misery was palpable.

On the other side, Hengxing simply raised an eyebrow, saying nothing. The spirit parasol in her hand danced, bringing a swath of red light down in front of Kui Qi, neutralizing the Profound Yellow Qi. With a gentle twirl, the parasol's surface instead released a multicolored radiance.

The black-robed man beside her awkwardly tried to thank her, but Hengxing turned her head away, ignoring him and showing him only her profile. Her attacks never paused as she said coldly:

"The Touba Clan has stayed in the Yan State so long, they've started acting as lapdogs for the Murong."

But Touba Ci, the richly-dressed cultivator cloaked in the Profound Yellow Qi, just smiled and shook his head. Even though the two Merciful Ones beside him had paled at Hengli's arrival and abandoned him to provide reinforcements elsewhere, he remained perfectly composed. He swung his great halberd, shattering the incoming 'Li-light', and fought on for several exchanges, a cold sneer on his face.

"Ah, the Hengzhu Dao. I thought after all these years, you'd at least be second only to Mount Changhuai. I never expected you'd still be holed up in your little corner... No wonder you decline day by day!"

Hengxing, however, was in no mood to indulge him. The Hengzhu Dao was currently the most well-preserved faction within the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. She gave her sleeve a gentle shake, and a gleaming, red-glazed, cloud-patterned treasure box flew out. Its lid shifted, leaking a two-toned light of gold and red.

This light blocked the Profound Yellow Qicolor and swept away the dust storm from the halberd. The box's surface was painted with a red-patterned sword on a black background, which seemed ready to leap forth. Tens of thousands of sword-lights erupted, forcing the Touba Clan man to hastily bring his halberd back to block. For a moment, the Profound Yellow Qi scattered, overwhelmed by the brilliant invocation art.

The northern side was already at a disadvantage. With the Hengzhu Dao joining the fray, the scales of battle tipped completely. The field fell into chaos. Kui Qi, finally breaking free, had just let out a breath of relief. He was about to draw his sword and turn, when a sudden chill washed over him.

The crimson clouds of the Heavenly Balance Mystic-Governing Cloud were slowly dimming. A faint, pale light emerged from the Great Void, descended rapidly, and came to a rest quietly before him.

It was a man.

He wore white robes under a silver cloak made of distinct, bird-like feathers. His hair was jet-black, his willow-leaf brows were long and thin, and his phoenix-eyes were captivating. His features were delicate, almost feminine, and his hair was bound with a simple wooden hairpin.

He held a silver-white incense burner in his left hand, his right hand clasped behind his back. A white jade pearl hung from his waist. He stood upon a dark, white mist that roiled like a beast. Despite his soft appearance, he had a transcendent, immortal bearing that inspired reverence.

But his aura soared to the heavens, causing dark clouds to roil and suppressing the Heavenly Balance Mystic-Governing Cloud. The boundless pressure bore down, and Kui Qi's expression turned even colder.

'A Great Daoist Master... A Great Daoist Master of the Veiled Yin!'

This figure's appearance silenced the entire plain. The various Mahas and Merciful Ones secretly breathed sighs of relief. Even Touba Ci found a moment to raise an eyebrow and bow his head slightly to the Great Daoist Master in a show of respect.

'The State Preceptor of Great Zhao, Wei Xuanyin!'

This was Wei Xuanyin, a Great Daoist Master who had mastered four divine abilities and hailed from the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao. As the State Preceptor of Great Zhao, he was the nation's number one immortal cultivator, supported by the entire state. His Daoist tradition was profound, his abilities exquisite, and his Spiritual Artifacts numerous. He was no ordinary expert!

The moment Wei Xuanyin appeared, the cultivators who had been invigorated by the Hengzhu Dao's arrival felt a surge of anxiety. The only exception was Hengli. Wreathed in flames and wielding his Spiritual Artifact, he paid the newcomer no mind, simply continuing his charge to hack at the miserable Zhelu. This was clearly wonderful news for the northern side, but the Maha didn't even have time to laugh or sneer; he just fled as if he'd seen a ghost.

Kui Qi stared coldly at the Great Daoist Master, only to see the delicate-featured man smile pleasantly and say:

"You saw wrong! That wasn't me above the temple. I asked the White Victory Dao early on, and we just pinched out a clone together."

His tone was friendly, as if discussing some Daoist principle, but only he and Kui Qi understood the true meaning of his words. The Great Daoist Master looked down at him for an instant, and the radiance of the Veiled Yin flared from the mouth of the censer in his hand.

*Vmmm...*

Kui Qi merely raised his bronze sword. His other hand produced five black talismans, which he tapped against five acupoints on his body. He pursed his lips and spat out a cloud of black qi.

The black qi swirled and took shape in the air, transforming into a massive, one-legged ghoul. It had a ferocious face, was draped in white bones, and its eyes glowed with a spectral light. Kui Qi did not call to Hengli or the others for help. Instead, he raised his sword and moved, his gaze sharp as a blade!

He, Kui Qi, had never come here to occupy Luoxia. He had only seized this fleeting opportunity to muster his strength and inflict a heavy blow on the Buddhist cultivators. Now, a full fourteen Purple Mansion cultivators had come from Jiangnan. To put it bluntly, not even Wrath or Jingzhan had ever received such treatment back in the day! Even if it cost him his life, as long as he could tie down Wei Xuanyin, Hengli, Lingmei, and the others could definitely shatter the northern cultivators and Buddhists!

As the current leader of the Great Xiukui Monastery and a three-ability cultivator of the Merging Owl, he knew his strengths. When it came to pure destructive power and extinguishing True Spirits, he was far inferior to Lingmei. For artifact refinement, invocation arts, and smiting evil, he was no match for Hengli. Even in defending a region and seeking the Dao, Tinglan had her own unique profundities that surpassed his...

But when it came to versatile incantations, entanglement, and delay tactics, only he, Kui Qi, dared to stand before the State Preceptor of Great Zhao, Wei Xuanyin!

*BOOM!*

A muffled thunderclap echoed from the clouds. The black-robed man's robes billowed as the bronze sword in his hand flashed with an incomparably dazzling light. The one-legged, one-eyed ghoul dissolved into overlapping layers of black qi, coiling around his body.

Wei Xuanyin watched him with a gentle expression, his pupils devoid of any particular emotion. He merely nodded. The silver-white censer in his hand shifted, tilting toward the northeast. Instantly, countless dark-white waterfalls descended, kicking up a terrifying storm that pressed down on Kui Qi.

The man's feathered silver cloak fluttered in the storm, and the white jade pearl at his waist began to sway. He looked down from on high and said quietly:

"Fellow Daoist, you underestimate my Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao."
