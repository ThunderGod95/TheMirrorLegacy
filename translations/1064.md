# Chapter 1064: Heretical Worship of the Layered Mountains

A light breeze drifted across the island. The sun was scorching, bleaching the reefs bone-white. A man in white robes stood silently within the clouds by the shore, appearing perfectly calm.

An Siwei was old. After his father, An Zheyan, died, he became the most senior elder of the An clan. When the Way of Great Desire swept south, An Xuanxin and countless core members and supporters of the An family were annihilated. While it wasn't a crippling blow to the Li family, for An Siwei, it was a thunderbolt from a clear sky.

The blow had struck him heavily. The letter An Xuantong sent from the lake was a long, heavy scroll. An Siwei read it with tears streaming down his face, clutching the scroll and wringing his hands in despair. He had to stop and start three times just to finish it, and even then, he had no idea how to reply.

'To think we would suffer such a calamity!'

He was filled with a boundless terror. He understood clearly that while the An clan's position still seemed stable, An Xuantong had no sons. Within the next century, the An clan would have no one capable left to rely on. The conflict between north and south was only intensifying. If their luck ran out and An Xuantong fell, the An clan would become the next Tian clan!

A cultivator's appearance was linked to their lifespan, but it was even more connected to their will. With his will now exhausted, this loyal Guest Retainer of the An family suddenly aged decades. He looked like a truly old man, standing numbly by the sea. Despite it all, a desperate hope began to stir in his heart:

'I may be old and useless, but I do not cling to my life-mandate. Could I... could I beg the Old Master to send me to the riverbank? Perhaps I could trade my life for Xuantong's...'

He had privately discussed this idea with his children. An Xuantong had vehemently opposed it, vowing to avenge his brothers' blood-debt, just as An Siwei himself had done all those years ago. But An Siwei was a man who had lived through it. He understood in his heart that this vengeance was impossible. Not in a hundred lifetimes, not in a thousand.

This sent him into a daze, and he unexpectedly thought of his father. 'When my younger brother died, did Father ever consider what I'm considering? ... Probably not. In his heart, there was only one son, only Jingming. It was the name he cried out before he died. The rest of us were just... offspring he sired to fulfill a will.'

The crushing weight of clan and family affairs pressed down on him, leaving him standing there, lost and unsure of what to do.

He waited by the shore for some time. Suddenly, he saw the waves churn, as if some massive, dark object was moving beneath the surface. His thoughts scattered instantly. He became alert and gripped a talisman tightly in his hand.

'What Demon beast... dares to approach Deer Weeds Island?'

Deer Weeds Island was guarded by a Purple Mansion Realm expert, so there was no need to fear an attack. Furthermore, the Li family was on close terms with the Dragon-kin. An Siwei merely suspected some Demon beast had recklessly wandered too close. But then, the water splashed, and a figure in white leaped out.

It was a man wearing a short, sea-green silk jacket, draped in a fine brocade cloak. Faint, azure scales were just visible on his neck. His cultivation base was incredibly dense, emanating a suffocating pressure.

Behind him, the water rippled. The Demon beast from the depths rose, carrying an enormous, azure palace-sedan. It was dotted with gold and jade, a seven-storied pavilion with six grand halls, adorned with pearl tassels. It rose from the water like a high platform. The sight terrified An Siwei, and he immediately dropped to his knees.

To command such power in the sea... who else could it be but the Dragon-kin! Having spent many years in the Eastern Sea, he knew exactly how domineering the Dragon-kin were.

But the man's expression was polite. He took a step forward and bowed from outside the island's grand defensive array. "Are you of the Li clan?" he asked respectfully. "Please inform your master that the Xu Water Demon King is here to visit."

An Siwei was alarmed. He quickly sent someone ahead with detailed instructions to report to Liu Changdie, while he himself waited humbly to the side. Stealing a terrified glance, he asked with extreme caution:

"Could it be... Lord Ying?"

The brocade-clothed youth lowered his gaze, a flicker of gratitude in his eyes. He nodded. "It is I... Are you an old acquaintance from the great river?"

An Siwei's heart settled somewhat. "My Lord, do you remember the Floating Cloud Cave?" he asked quickly. "When King Wei was campaigning in the north, I was serving under his command..."

'He's King Wei already...'

An Siwei didn't need to explain the title. The moment he heard 'King Wei', Ying Hebai understood completely. His heart burned with emotion, and he was momentarily at a loss.

'He saved my entire clan! How can I ever repay such a debt!'

Back then, the situation on the mainland had changed drastically. Ying Hebai hadn't dared to stay, retreating in a hurry. Although he saved his own life, he had abandoned his post without orders, which was a grave dereliction of duty. It angered his direct superior, and his life had been difficult ever since.

Since returning from the mainland, his clan's fortunes had taken a sharp downturn. The Xu Water Demon King had attended the divine ability banquet of the Dragon King of Crimson Reef Island. At the feast, his own aunt had been reckless and offended the White Wave Demon King. Although the Xu Water Demon King managed to protect her, she lost favor. After that, the missions Ying Hebai received grew increasingly dangerous. His clan's status plummeted, and they faced the threat of annihilation.

Fortunately, this King Wei had mentioned him to Dragon King Beihai. His superior's superior had personally spoken on his behalf. Even that White Wave Demon King came to apologize, giving immense face to the Xu Water Demon King...

'With a single word, he saved my clan's lives and honor!'

Perhaps years ago, Ying Hebai had only been respectful to him because of Dingjiao. Now, he was utterly and truly convinced of the man's power.

'I fear that even Dragon King Beihai must give weight to this King Wei's wishes, to say nothing of the Xu Water Demon King. My promotion today, placing me here as the King's vanguard... it's a gesture to the Li family, and it's also the Xu Water Demon King's way of showing loyalty to Beihai Sea...'

He smoothed his brow, composed his expression, and waited quietly. Only a breath passed before a man stepped out of the void, his body gleaming with the silver light of a divine ability. He bowed low and said hurriedly:

"This humble cultivator, Yuanbian, greets the Great King!"

Liu Changdie had only heard that the Dragon-kin were visiting, but he largely understood. Li Ximing was so pressed for time he hadn't even been able to meet, rushing off with Li Que'wan. He must be desperate to secure relations with the Dragon-kin so he can hurry back to the mainland... It made Liu Changdie feel a pang of empathy.

'In the end, the Wei-Li position is a heavy burden. He doesn't dare linger anywhere for long...'

Only then did he see a man in ink-black armor descend from the pavilion. He wore a helmet that obscured his face, and a longbow was strapped to his back. He strode forward, his voice deep and powerful:

"I am Lu Xu. I have come to this island on orders. My apologies for the disturbance."

"Not at all..."

Liu Changdie led him inward. The two did not enter the cave dwelling, but instead sat in the island's courtyard. The Demon King's expression was calm as he said faintly,

"I have long heard of your reputation."

As those words registered, Liu Changdie realized this visit wasn't just about Fuxun. He grew vigilant, though his words remained humble.

"I never imagined my meager reputation would have reached your esteemed ears!"

The Xu Water Demon King raised his tea directly.

"I am a coarse creature, unused to your human pleasantries. I won't waste time weaving words. There is a Great Daoist Master named Changxiao. He wanted to kill you. It was our Thunder Maiden of Profound Pool who saved you. If not for her, you would already be dead."

The suspicion in Liu Changdie's heart was instantly confirmed. He shot up from his seat, bowing low in a profound show of gratitude. "Yuanbian has long sensed... I am deeply indebted to this great lady..."

Lu Xu's expression remained stern.

"While it was a turn of cosmic fateand Her Highness the Profound Maiden, who watches over the Qunyi Archipelago, did not wish to see one favored by the Heaven-Governing fall-it was also because the Thunder Maiden shares a karmic affinity with you..."

Liu Changdie was stunned. "This... Profound Maiden...?" he asked, confused.

Lu Xu reacted as if he'd been stung. His calm expression vanished, replaced by alarm.

"Is 'Profound Maiden' a name you can use so casually?" he hissed. "There is only one Profound Maiden in all the heavens, the Maiden of the Profound Valley! The one you cultivators call the True Monarch of Wondrous Transformation, the Nine Heavens Matriarch of the Profound Valley!"

Liu Changdie finally understood. The 'Profound Maiden' Lu Xu meant was the Valley Water Matriarch. It was true; cultivators did usually call her 'Matriarch'. A cold sweat broke out on his back. He had been rattled by the phrase 'favored by the Heaven-Governing,' which had exposed his deepest secret. He was flustered and, unable to control himself, quickly slapped his own face several times in apology. He tried to cover his panic with a question.

"I didn't know... this Thunder Maiden..."

''Favored by the Heaven-Governing'... the Valley Water Matriarch... Could it be that that person of the Heaven-Governing knew her? But... hasn't the Matriarch ceased to manifest in the world for ages...'

His mind raced as he continued to apologize. The Xu Water Demon King's expression finally softened.

He continued, "When she was human, her mortal name was Li Qinghong."

Liu Changdie was struck by a sudden, total understanding. All his past questions seemed to answer themselves at once. A wave of sorrow washed over him, leaving him speechless. Lu Xu watched him quietly.

"You are to guard this island. Stop running all over the place. If you wander off to the mainland or some other sea and get yourself killed, we won't be able to do a thing about it."

His gaze was intense, as if trying to discern if his words had taken root. Liu Changdie sighed, tears welling in his eyes.

'So it was a favor from the Li family all along... In that case, guarding this island is no different than returning to my post as a Guest Retainer for the Li clan. The karmic affinities of this world... they are truly wondrous!'

The Xu Water Demon King then gave an order.

"Bring that Demon beast up."

Liu Changdie hurriedly excused himself. A moment later, the white-robed, red-eyed youth rushed into the hall and kowtowed deeply.

"Greetings, My Lord!"

As he bowed, a pale yellow light began to flow, unnoticed by the trio. The eyes on the back of Fuxun's head opened once more, their milky pupils staring blankly at the sky.

The Xu Water Demon King, completely unaware, looked him over with curiosity, praising him internally.

'An auspicious beast! How rare! After this Bright Yang affair is concluded, perhaps the Dragon King will have a use for him... But for now, I must hide him well. Can't let the other Kings see him, or they'll fight over him and ruin our important plans.'

He adopted a formal posture.

"Since King Wei himself made the request, you will naturally be put to good use. Where do you wish to be stationed?"

The eyes on the back of Fuxun's head swiveled, his lips moving as if in silent discussion. A low voice whispered,

'Dongfang Weixi... and Zhongli Bailu... must not see us. The Qunyi Archipelago is good... the World's Navel is also good. In this place... assuming the posture of receiving the Valley... They will not see clearly.'

Tears were already streaming down Fuxun's face.

"I have no one to rely on, only this one brother," he choked out. "I wish to be stationed somewhat close to Daoist Master Yuanbian..."

Lu Xu had anticipated this. His main concern was preventing Fuxun from wandering and attracting the attention of other Dragon Kings. He smiled.

"Between this archipelago and the World's Navel, there is a place called Danping Reef. I can assign you to guard it, but you must not leave your post without reason. If you delay the Lord's business, you will not be spared!"

Fuxun was overjoyed and nodded repeatedly. The Xu Water Demon King helped him up, then turned to Ying Hebai.

"From now on, I order you to patrol the seas in this area. Bring all your clansmen here. If King Wei has any instructions, go directly to the palace and find Dragon King Jiaohai!"

His own territory wasn't here; this was effectively handing Ying Hebai over to Dragon King JiaohaiDongfang Dingjiaowho was close to King Wei. The Xu Water Demon King was not an easy master to serve. Ying Hebai nodded and bowed repeatedly, ecstatic to the point of tears. He escorted the massive palace-sedan far out to sea before riding the wind back, making a point to find An Siwei.

The scales on the Demon beast's neck flexed. His face was streaked with crystalline tears that clanged against his armor as they fell. On that empty beach, he bowed low.

"Please," he cried, "report to King Wei. This kindness is impossible to repay! Even if one day he demands my heart and lungs, demands my very life-mandate, I, Hebai, will offer it gladly!"

## Southern Borderlands

The sky was thick with dark clouds, and a massive, blue-purple banner snapped in the chaotic wind. Far below, at the foot of the mountain, ant-like columns of barbarians were visible, tied together with ropes and led along like cattle.

On the mountaintop, a golden-eyed man stood with his hands clasped behind him, his cloak billowing in the wind. The purple sigil between his brows pulsed with a faint light, as if breathing. His golden eyes overflowed with contemplation.

'So, this is a divine ability.'

He raised his hand. A brilliant, emerald flame ignited on his fingertip, causing the surrounding Great Void to ripple. As the True Qi fire flickered, it even seemed to carry a trace of the aura of Immeasurable Water and Fire.

This flame penetrated his body, tracing a path down into his sea of qi, illuminating everything within it. It was like a draught of sweet dew descending upon his immortal foundation, continuously nourishing his Audience with the Celestial Gate. It allowed him to faintly resonate with the Great Void, preparing him for the future Purple Mansion Realm.

Li Jiangxia mused to himself:

'Jiangliang mentioned the Golden Lotus Seat, but I think its overrated... At best, it's just a sattva. This 'Holder of the Profound' power is tied to authority and position. I wonder if it's a boon from his founding noble title, or an amplification from being head of all officials... It's a notch higher than mine.'

But none of that truly mattered. What Li Jiangxia valued was the advancement of his own divine ability. Authority and position were granted by others; how could they compare to the freedom of one's own power?

'My Bright Yang cultivation is far smoother than his Radiant Fire. With this 'Holder of the Profound' amplification... I believe I can probe for my own divine ability within ten years...'

As he was considering this, An Xuantong hurried up the mountain. He, too, was now clad in armor, looking majestic and imposing. The shadow of his brothers' deaths had not yet lifted from his brow, yet he seemed to have found new hope for vengeance in the miracle of Li Jiangxia's sudden advancement. He appeared fiercely ambitious as he bowed.

"All the cultivators from the petty kingdoms have been bound," he reported. "We have rounded up all their forces. My Lord... how should we dispose of them?"

A thoughtful expression crossed Li Jiangxia's face.

Once this place was pacified, it was destined to become a cultivator's fief. Before he left, Li Jiangliang had mentioned that, given Yang Zhuo's way of doing things, this territory would almost certainly be granted to him. Li Jiangxia narrowed his eyes, as if recalling something.

'Heretical worship of the Layered Mountains, bound and brought to Wei.'

He paced a step.

"This is the seventh kingdom," he murmured. "There aren't many cultivators left here. Bind all these shamans and transport them to the capital. Let the Emperor decide their fate... As for their people..."

The golden-eyed youth's expression grew chillingly remote.

"When I departed," he replied, "the Emperor gave a command: 'The light of Tianwu does not shine on barbarian tribes. Those of Baiji, Jiaozhi, and the Piaoren are of lowly, slave-like stock. They delight in transgression and are ignorant of grace. Their tribes are to be exterminated and replaced with our own people.'"

Before and after Yang Zhuo became emperor, he had not engaged in slaughter, always treating the populace with benevolence. But clearly, his definition of 'populace' had its borders. His words carried a bone-deep chill. Li Jiangxia lowered his gaze to the ant-like masses at the foot of the mountain.

"The true edict is before us; it cannot be defied. Pass on my order: All barbarians are to be branded on the face and driven as slaves to build the Emperor's new palace. The women are to be taken back to the capital as handmaidens."

The Li family had always cherished the common people, treating even the Eastern Yue under their rule with leniency. An Xuantong was visibly uncomfortable with such a command, but the emperor's order was absolute. He could only withdraw, filled with apprehension.

Li Jiangxia seemed completely unaffected. He stood quietly for a moment before the sound of hurried footsteps approached. A messenger rushed up the mountain, fell to his knees, and said urgently:

"Urgent report, General! The Grand General has reached the Wilderness and is preparing to attack Sanjiang!"
