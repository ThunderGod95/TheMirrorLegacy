# Chapter 1250: The Return

Myriad mountains and ravines stretched out, the land a canvas of deep ink-green.

Li Que'wan rode the wind, leaping across the lands. As she neared a coastal prefecture, the hills grew more numerous, but she was in no mood to admire the scenery. With a flick of her wrist, she produced a slender, long-necked jade bottle.

Years ago, her elder brother had gone to the Chengyun Immortal Sect to negotiate with Daoist Master Zhonggong, offering the Myriad Malice Gold-Piercing Blade in trade. However, the blade ultimately couldn't compare to the Eight-Ghost-Faced Frontier, so her family was already prepared to offer further compensation. But when the item actually reached the Chengyun Gate's hands, the situation unexpectedly changed.

'The Eight-Ghost-Faced Frontier was a relic of Daoist Master Kui Qi. It suffered minor damage during the great defeat at Luoxia, and Daoist Master Houfu never had the chance to repair it before it was lost in Shanji Prefecture. Now that it has been recovered, that damage remains, slightly diminishing its value.'

While constructing their formation, her family had also requested several spiritual resources from Zhong Qian, incurring an even greater debt of gratitude… After much consideration, Li Que'wan took out the Profound-Name Dao-Malice to compensate the Daoist Master.

Though it put him in an awkward position, Zhong Qian was clearly in dire need of the item and thanked her profusely. Prompted by a reminder from Li Jiangqian, Li Que'wan had specifically asked about the spiritual item's use, and Zhong Qian had held nothing back, explaining everything.

'Profound-Name is the arbiter of destiny. The Profound-Name Dao-Malice is a malevolence nurtured by the central earth itself. Celestial gold Sinks Upon Encountering Balefulness, transforming into Primordial Magnetism. This malice is neither light nor dark, neither skewed nor centered; it possesses the virtue of nurturing, making it perfectly suitable.'

'My path is intertwined with destiny. Though I only possess two divine abilities, my future chance of attaining the Purple Mystery rests upon this Profound-Name Dao-Malice!'

Li Que'wan had a flash of understanding, but Zhong Qian continued:

"That day, Your Highness traded the golden blade for spiritual resources; the Profound-Name Dao-Malice is another matter entirely. This item is truly the foundation of my Dao path. Since the Eight-Ghost-Faced Frontier is damaged, I will not shortchange you. I have found something good as compensation."

It was precisely the item in the bottle, called 'Wondrous Pill Art Malice'—baleful energy tainted by the Dao of the Whole Pill. Items related to the Whole Pill were already rare in the world, and Li Que'wan needed this very thing to forge a Spiritual Artifact. After some hesitation, she finally accepted it.

Now, as she made her way toward Tiger's Frontier Mountain, she felt a sense of bitterness:

'That Senior Zhong never allows anyone to get the short end of the stick. I went to repay a favor, yet it feels like I've hardly paid any of it back and have instead incurred a greater debt.'

In the current Jiangnan, there was no shortage of people who wanted King Wei to owe them a favor, be it Chen Yin or the Sima Family—which of them wasn't clamoring for the opportunity? But Li Que'wan could, at the very least, distinguish between genuine goodwill and calculated interest, and she sighed to herself.

In but a moment, the majestic mountain appeared before them. As they approached the main gate, the black-clad man with a grim face, who had been following behind, hesitated for a long while before suddenly stepping forward and speaking in a low voice:

"Miss, is the Lingu family of today still in the Linhai region?"

Li Wushao was a spirit ordained from a Spiritual Treasure and naturally remained by her side. Li Que'wan was taken aback by his question and, after a moment's thought, responded:

"You're asking because…"

The demon beast stood with his hands clasped behind him, a cold smile playing in his eyes:

"I've long heard the Lingu family possesses a white-scaled Hooked Serpent of great age. Years ago, an… acquaintance of mine feared his power and grew distant from me. My heart has never been at peace with that, so this is a perfect chance to pay a visit."

Li Que'wan instantly recalled the old stories from his youth and couldn't help but laugh.

"Senior, your temperament is the same as ever, always needing to make a show of things. But if you go now, I'm afraid you'll scare them half to death!"

Joking aside, Li Que'wan hesitated for a moment before saying quietly:

"The Lingu family may not be a great clan, but we have no grievances with them; they have always been polite to our family. Lingu Lanying even saved Si Xunhui once… and he is, after all, a son-in-law of my Li family…"

Li Wushao's expression turned serious.

"This subordinate is narrow-minded… I cannot simply forget what happened back then, but I would never delay our benefactor's business. It is not merely a matter of pride; I once heard from an old acquaintance that this demon was left behind by Lingu Xia. I also wish to… inquire about matters concerning Lingu Xia."

'He's also doing this for… the young master who supported him for so many years, and the great-granduncle who lives overseas!'

This demon beast held onto old sentiments tightly. Li Que'wan understood at once, but the decrees of the High Firmament Pavilion were clear, and this matter was obviously unchangeable. Merely to indulge his earnest heart, she gave a hesitant nod. The demon beast strode forward and called out with a laugh:

"The Li Clan of Moongaze has come to visit! We request the masters of the Immortal Dao to open the mountain gate!"

In just an instant, a gray wind shot forth. A Daoist Master clad in black with a treasure pouch at his waist strode through the air, bowing from afar. When he drew near, he observed her divine ability and said with a serious expression:

"You must be Daoist Master Suyun."

Li Que'wan smiled and nodded.

"Greetings, Senior!"

The two of them proceeded into the mountains. Upon reaching the snow-laden summit, they found a stone table with a game of black and white laid out upon it. Before the hall already stood a person dressed in green, her face slightly pale, though her beautiful features were still discernible.

Lingu Lanying.

Evidently, the two had arrived at an inconvenient time. This rare Daoist Master of the Lingu family was in the middle of a visit to Tiger's Frontier Mountain. Seeing Li Que'wan approach, she offered a slight bow and smiled.

"Congratulations, fellow Daoist!"

There was no way Lingu Lanying and Li Que'wan could be considered peers any longer, but she adopted a humble attitude, appearing very courteous. However, when her gaze swept past to the grim-faced, black-clad man standing behind, her mind went blank.

'It's him…'

How could Lingu Lanying not recognize Li Wushao!

'The… demon beast… that Li Qinghong brought back then…'

In those days, her spirit pet, Gu'er, had even had a brief fling with Li Wushao. But due to their different bloodlines, their union never came to fruition. At the time, Li Xuanfeng's power was at its zenith, and fearing she would create enmity, she had agonized over it for quite some time! Later, Gu'er perished, and that was the end of it…

'But this is… a 'Mansion Water' Purple Mansion Realm cultivator?!'

Lingu Lanying stood frozen on the spot.

'What kind of joke is this!'

Lingu Lanying had carefully assessed Li Wushao's capabilities back then; how could she not know them? His breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm had been a stroke of luck, at most bolstered by consuming a few spiritual items… How could he possibly have cultivated a divine ability—and at a pace that was nearly catching up to her!

At her side, Lin Chensheng was only slightly less shocked, but his speechlessness was the same. He cupped his fist and said:

"This is…"

Neither of them possessed a Life Divine Ability, and Li Wushao had reached his realm by consuming an extremely precious spiritual essence, so he appeared to be merely a Daoist Master with a slightly weaker aura. As long as a fight didn't break out, it was difficult to discern his true depth. Li Que'wan smiled faintly and simply said:

"This is my family's Dharma Protector, Wushao."

Li Wushao bowed to Lin Chensheng before turning around with a smile.

"Daoist Master Lingu, I trust you've been well!"

Lingu Lanying gave a bitter smile and a nod.

"Time flies, and those from the past are like flowing water. The sight of you and that person fighting side-by-side back then… is still fresh in my mind…"

Her tone was tactful, alluding to both Gu'er's death and Li Qinghong. Li Wushao, however, just shook his head and sighed.

"Daoist Master is too kind! Please, call me Wushao or Dharma Protector… My lady addresses you as Senior; how could I, a mere subordinate, presume to be called 'fellow Daoist'!"

Lingu Lanying had no choice but to turn and face them both. Li Que'wan smiled.

"I came today to discuss a happy occasion with Senior Lin. I didn't expect to interrupt Senior Lingu's affairs…"

"You are too kind."

Lingu Lanying smiled awkwardly.

"I came because of my injuries… I was wounded quite badly on the lake. I managed to get a pill from fellow Daoist Sima, but I haven't fully recovered… Chensheng can refine pills, and he has a treasure cauldron in the mountains, so I came to ask…"

Li Que'wan nodded slightly and saw Lin Chensheng shake his head with a smile.

"With Great Master Zhaojing setting the standard, how could I dare speak of pill refinement…"

Seeing this, Lingu Lanying clasped her hands and prepared to take her leave. Li Que'wan smiled and said softly:

"Speaking of which, it's quite a coincidence. I hear your esteemed clan also has a Dharma Protector, a Hooked Serpent left behind by Senior Lingu Xia… Wushao greatly admires him and would be honored to meet him!"

Lingu Lanying was slightly taken aback, her heart thumping in her chest. She nodded, then descended with Li Wushao. Lin Chensheng, having observed everything, refilled Li Que'wan's tea and smiled.

"The Lingu family… for them to produce someone like her after so many years is truly remarkable."

Li Que'wan had heard tales of how many treasures the old sword immortal from the Great Xiukui Monastery had bestowed upon the Lingu family. They were rumors that had spread like wildfire among Purple Mansion Realm cultivators back then. Only now did everyone finally understand that old sword immortal's intentions. Li Que'wan nodded.

"It is all thanks to the immortal sect."

Lin Chensheng smiled without a word. Li Que'wan rose with a serious expression and said:

"I have come today with two important matters. The first is the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!"

She bowed deeply.

"This treasure is of the utmost importance and has been a great help to King Wei. He intended to come and thank you personally, but his injuries prevent him from doing so, and thus I have come in his stead."

Lin Chensheng remained silent for a moment before speaking quietly:

"When my sect was struck by disaster, Daoist Master Zhaojing aided me many times. Though I did not witness it myself, I have etched it in my heart. In the battle of Lake Xian, King Wei personally slew Qi Lanyan, avenging the blood debt of my Xiukui. This, too, I have etched in my heart."

He continued in a soft voice:

"The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass was first brought to Xiukui by Daoist Master Qinglong. He served as a protector of our sect for his entire life, and his only dying wish was for the sect to safeguard the compass and prevent it from falling into other hands. Thus, it became a hallowed treasure of Xiukui, passed down through the generations by ancestral decree…"

His gaze was complex as he said somberly:

"But after seeing King Wei, I knew that this treasure's destiny lay with him…"

Li Que'wan stood up and said softly:

"Senior's guess is correct. This treasure is indeed of great use to my family. However, we have long been aware of Xiukui's difficult position. We did not come here unprepared!"

She took a jade box from her sleeve, presented it with both hands, and said in a low voice:

"Please, look!"

Lin Chensheng was slightly startled, seemingly not having expected the Li family to consider compensation for taking the item. He shook his head.

"As I've said… this is a debt of gratitude, and also the Mandate of Heaven…"

Li Que'wan simply lowered her eyes with a solemn expression, saying nothing. Her silence, however, made Lin Chensheng grow suspicious. A guess formed in his mind as he looked at her expression, and he quickly rose and gently opened the jade box.

The moment his gaze fell upon the box, his breathing grew ragged. His hands trembled. He tilted his head but could not tear his eyes away as he carefully lifted the black, cord-like object from within.

The profound cord was extremely fine, like silk yet not. Its black surface was covered with faint, light-gray patterns, and within it, specks of golden light seemed to flow, forming myriad ferocious faces. Lin Chensheng's eyes instantly welled with tears. He held the object with heart-wrenching care and cried out:

"Dao Lord!"

Li Que'wan sighed inwardly. Lin Chensheng held the item up, examining it meticulously through his tears. Sure enough, he saw a tear-like mark near the end of the black cord, suffused with a white energy. Li Que'wan said gently:

"During the great battle of Luoxia, the Dao Lord shouldered the fate and struck with awe-inspiring might, single-handedly holding back Wei Xuanyin. But who could have known that Changxiao, disregarding old ties, would suddenly betray him and cut off his retreat, causing his Spiritual Artifact to shatter and inflict this Upper Rite injury!"

Lin Chensheng wept softly for a time, then gritted his teeth.

"Changxiao! When he first came from the Eastern Sea, the first gate he visited was my Tiger's Frontier… Our elders treated him with great courtesy, believing he cultivated the orthodox Upper Rite and could be a force for good in Jiangnan. How could we have known it would come to this!"

"I swear I will slay this ungrateful, treacherous villain with my own hands!"

Even though his foe was a Great Daoist Master who had been renowned for years, Lin Chensheng showed no hesitation, his grief turning to rage. But Li Que'wan knew the truth:

'I'm afraid there isn't enough time…'

It wasn't that it was impossible, but that there wasn't enough time.

She knew how much Lin Chensheng hated Changxiao and Wei Xuanyin, but both were seeking to verify the Dao recently. One would not show himself easily, and the other was backed by a great Daoist tradition. The cruel reality was that by the time Lin Chensheng managed to attain the Purple Mystery, the two would have likely either perished after verifying the Dao or already ascended to the golden position.

'Too much of the world's hatred and resentment fizzles out unresolved, leaving behind only desolate people with bewildered hearts.'

'Just like… Chi Wei.'

The Li family had exacted revenge on the Chi family, but it was an unsatisfying, joyless vengeance. Chi Wei had died in a blaze of glory while verifying the Dao. The Li family's two-hundred-year grudge could only be directed at the rest of the Chi family… and even then, they had to wait for the bleakness of autumn, when all life withered, to risk everything and fan the winds that would topple the great tree of the Chi family.

She composed her features and fell silent. Lin Chensheng cried his heart out for a while before finally lowering his gaze.

"Thank you, esteemed clan, for returning the Dao Lord's relic! On behalf of the Lin clan, and on behalf of Xiukui, I thank you!"

Li Que'wan quickly stepped aside, avoiding the gesture. After a moment of silence, she said softly:

"Senior is too kind. Forgive me, but Suyun cannot accept this. The Eight-Ghost-Faced Frontier, though precious, cannot compare to the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass. King Wei has given his word: the day he reclaims the Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword, he will return it to Xiukui!"

Lin Chensheng's quiet sobs grew heavier.

'In this day and age, those with the divine ability lack the heart for such things, and those with the heart lack the ability. The only one who would dare make such a promise is King Wei!'

He was not a man of eloquent words and was struck speechless for a moment. He could only slowly compose his sorrowful expression and say with great solemnity:

"If King Wei marches north, I, Chensheng, am willing to serve as his vanguard!"

Li Que'wan, however, changed the subject, a slight smile touching her lips.

"I have also come to discuss a joyous matter with you, Senior. It concerns my niece… Your esteemed clan has a direct descendant named Lin Caiyin, is that not so?"

Lin Chensheng was clearly aware of the matter and had even been thinking about it for some time. He looked up and said with emotion:

"Yes… that boy is a descendant of the Dao Lord's bloodline, the eldest son of the direct line's third generation. He is currently cultivating in the imperial capital and shares deep feelings with the general's daughter. He has already written several letters back… I was worried your esteemed clan was busy, so I kept delaying my trip to ask."

If Lin Chensheng had come any earlier, he would have certainly found no one home. Li Que'wan smiled.

"So he is a descendant of the Dao Lord. In that case, let's settle this happy occasion today!"
