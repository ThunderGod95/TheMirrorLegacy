# Chapter 818: Crimson Voyager

Li Zhouwei unfolded the small letter in his hand, read through it line by line, and handed it to Li Xuanxuan. The old man took it and read carefully, stroking his beard as he recited, "Yu Fuzi, birth name Wang Fu, hails from Jiankan Prefecture of Wu State. He has three disciples, one of whom is a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... That disciple is now nearly a hundred years old. The disciple’s master is Zhou Han of Changxiao Gate, who has been in closed-door cultivation for many years and has not emerged..."

Changxiao Gate had been established fairly recently. Its founder, Chang Xiaozi, was still alive and in his prime, imbuing the sect with the vigor of a newly risen force. Everyone has a Daoist title, and master-disciple relationships often lacked any blood ties.

Li Xuanxuan read halfway through and suddenly felt a headache coming on. He muttered to himself, "Wu State... surname Wang... there shouldn’t be many powerful families left..."

Li Zhouwei nodded and replied, "Wu State once had the Wang Family, a top-tier family, though that was said to be a thousand years ago. Later, chaos broke out in Jiangnan, and the Wang Family declined. But they had been so prominent back then that many powerful cultivators in Wu State still bear the surname Wang."

Jiangnan had long since been split between Wu and Yue, unlike the north where dynasties changed rapidly. The great cultivation sects and aristocratic clans had completely supplanted the imperial families of both nations. Wu and Yue had become mere geographic terms, with no real national rivalry remaining.

Jiangnan's strict information blockade had resulted in only a few century-old families keeping secret records. Thus, even the names of southern dynasties from a thousand years ago had faded from history...

Li Xuanxuan continued reading, "This person cultivates the Lesser Yang attribute, but his Immortal Foundation is unknown... He possesses three dharma artifacts: a bell, a sword, and a pearl. They all have great power... He has remained at the late stage of Foundation Establishment Realm for many years and is exceptionally strong...

"He recently emerged from his cave dwelling after obtaining a treasure and is now stationed at the Eastern Sea’s Xifeng Island on behalf of Changxiao Gate, leading its cultivators to guard against an attack from the Hengzhu Dao Gate..."

There had long been tension between Changxiao Gate and the Hengzhu Dao Gate, and their conflicts had grown increasingly intense in recent years. Now that fighting had become likely, the powerful Yu Fuzi had been deployed.

After reading, Li Xuanxuan furrowed his old brows and muttered, "This matter seems difficult... Qinghong and the others still haven’t found a place to settle. Who knows if they’re wounded... This Yu Fuzi looks troublesome, he has a master and disciples, with a web of complicated ties...

"Let’s wait for now."

Li Zhouwei nodded in reply. "Since we've received word and major changes have occurred on the front, we should have uncle come out of seclusion..."

After all, Li Ximing had only been in seclusion for a month. It was barely long enough to get settled for a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. However, if the situation hadn’t become urgent, Li Zhouwei wouldn’t have disturbed him. Once Li Xuanxuan nodded, he sent someone over.

After a short wait, Li Ximing indeed descended on the wind before the hall. The radiant light around him had yet to fade, bringing a warm breeze into the hall. He asked directly, "How are things at home?"

Li Xuanxuan took his hand and began explaining the northern disturbances, then passed him the letter. After reading it, Li Ximing replied with mixed feelings, "The news from the north is so dire... we may need to wait longer to learn the full picture. Has Zhouwei found out anything about Xifeng Island, and any intelligence on Hengzhu Dao Gate?"

Since the Radiant Sky Stone concerned Li Ximing’s Dao to the Purple Mansion Realm, he took it very seriously. Li Zhouwei had come prepared and answered softly, "Changxiao Gate’s Xifeng Island lies over five hundred kilometers north of Splitreed Island. The island itself is decent, with a chain of scattered reefs forming a powerful grand formation. It’s well defended.

"As for Hengzhu Dao Gate’s Tianzhu Island, it lies over two hundred and fifty kilometers east of Splitreed Island. It's held by Bi Yuzhuang, a late Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. The two sects have already spilled blood multiple times, and relations are quite strained."

Li Ximing nodded quietly. It was the perfect time to get involved, but they couldn’t spare the manpower. He could only say comfortingly, "It’s fine. The man just left for the Eastern Sea, so it’ll be at least four or five years before he can be reassigned. Let’s wait for news from the north first."

Noise rose outside the grand formation. An Siwei quickly stepped forward and said in a low voice, "Your Highness, Master Monk Kongheng has returned!"

"Bring him up immediately!" said Li Xuanxuan.

Li Xuanxuan grew excited and strode out in a few quick steps. Sure enough, the narrow-eyed monk was standing before the hall. The monk’s aura appeared stable. Though his robes were disheveled, the bronze meditation staff in his hand stood firm, and his expression held a hint of guilt.

"Elder Xuanxuan!" He bowed his head and said softly, "Chengshui Tomb was thrown into chaos. Tang Shedu rebelled... the Immortal Dao suffered greatly..."

As he recounted everything in detail, the three men listened in heavy silence. Kongheng, once a defender of Mount Yan Pass, had also been sent to Chengshui Tomb with the other cultivators. Always low-profile, he had kept his true strength hidden and was assigned alone under Yu Su.

According to the Azure Pond Sect's deployment orders, Yu Su’s group had arrived slightly later than Li Xuanfeng and Tang Shedu. They had moved north from Mount Yan Pass and were expected to face the weakest devil cultivators. They were supposedly the easiest front.

Thus, though the cultivators were the weakest of the three groups, they felt no tension as they marched north in high spirits. This lasted until they witnessed an immortal and a devil cultivator in a chase heading east.

The two were unremarkable, except for the dharma artifact in the devil cultivator’s hand. It shone brilliantly with an ancient, majestic aura which clearly meant that it was no ordinary item. Its power was great, and the devil cultivator was chasing the immortal cultivator across the land.

Yu Su took one look and immediately stopped in his tracks. He was already infamous within the sect for his greed. He had even earned the nickname Brocade Dark Mouse because of his personality, unique Immortal Foundation, and dharma artifact. Though he claimed he was going to help, it was clearly greed at work.

The group had no choice but to adjust course slightly and fly a few more kilometers. Unexpectedly, the devil cultivators seemed to have predicted their path and had set a trap, ambushing them on the way!

"That Yu Su... he was surrounded by five devil heads. The demonic smoke was thick, and the cultivators scattered in all directions. In the end, no one was willing to help him..."

The always inconspicuous Kongheng had roamed far and wide for years, so he was never short on survival techniques. Sensing danger early, he had fled eastward through the demonic smoke and eventually reached Baixiang Valley.

"I had just reached Baixiang Valley when the pursuers arrived... I also saw Yuan Huyuan on the way. He and several Yuan Family members were swallowed by the demonic smoke and he was forced to flee alone. I happened upon him weeping softly."

Li Xuanxuan asked softly, "So you weren’t inside the pass... Has Mount Yan Pass fallen?"

"I’m quite certain that it has fallen..." replied Kongheng.

Kongheng had served alone under Yu Su, without any other members of the Li Family nearby, so he couldn’t confirm Mount Yan Pass’s exact status. Li Ximing stayed silent for a moment before finally speaking, "We can’t head north into the demonic mist. All we can do is await word... The two elders are powerful and should be safe... but I fear for Xizhi and Wushao... Brother Xizhi was injured earlier, and he could be in danger now."

Kongheng thought for a moment, then gently consoled, "Although Mount Yan Pass has fallen, the situation at Chengshui Tomb may not be as bad as it seems."

As a buddhist cultivator of an ancient lineage, Kongheng had clearly deduced Tang Shedu’s intentions from the clues at hand. He explained, "Tang Shedu simply wishes to join the Northern Buddhists. The North-South conflict is a matter of Dao lineage and great destiny. With his deep foundations and high status, he may become the next Merciful One if he joins the North. This means his future prospects are boundless.

"If he intends to undertake the karmic transformation ritual, he would surely submit under a Maha. Upon success, the heavens would shine with divine light, lotus flowers would descend, and all of us who cultivate the Buddhist Dao would sense it..."

He shook his head and said, "I was close enough to Chengshui Tomb, yet I sensed nothing, not even upon reaching Baixiang Valley. Something must have gone wrong. Perhaps the ritual was interrupted by someone in the Purple Mansion Realm."

The expressions of the Li Family members eased slightly at that. But Li Xuanxuan remained uneasy and began asking for details. Li Ximing sat quietly at the table, folding Yu Fuzi's intelligence with care. Outside, the snowfall had lessened. A man rushed up from below, hurried and anxious, arriving quickly before the hall.

His face pale, he spoke quickly, "Your Highness! Lady Xu is in labor..."

Li Zhouwei’s gaze snapped to him. He strode swiftly out of the main hall, and leaped onto the wind. He pierced through the clouds and across the frozen lake, landing directly in front of the central hall.

Though anxious, he masked it well. He strode through the corridor and neared the palace gate of the rear hall. The scent of blood had already reached his nose. Li Zhouwei’s ears twitched at the sound of panicked cries. His expression darkened as he pushed the door open, and his breath caught.

A suffocating wave of blood-tinged heat rushed out, mingled with an odd fragrance that nearly induced nausea. The lamps had all toppled, and the floor was dotted with glimmering beads of blood that gleamed gold under the flickering light.

Two maidservants had backed into a corner, sobbing as they clung to each other. When he followed the trail of blood, he finally saw Xu Peiyu.

The woman lay motionless on the couch, lit by dim, yellow light. Blood dripped slowly down her thighs, and a newborn lay on the floor. Its entire body was wrinkled, and its golden eyes were already open. Its tiny hands clutched Xu Peiyu's thigh tightly, tongue extended to lap up the dripping blood. Its lips moved slightly, revealing a faint white gleam.

The Jade Court Guards nearby were frozen beside the child. Their hands bore fresh bite wounds, and they were unsure whether to act or retreat. The moment they saw him enter, they fell to their knees with a thud.

"Your subordinate... was incompetent..."

Li Zhouwei paid them no mind. An old, lingering premonition was being confirmed in his heart, leaving him speechless. This child was supposed to be his eldest son. Li Zhouwei had even chosen his name in advance, naming him Li Jiang’ao.

His heart sank step by step as he stepped over the blood and grabbed the child by the neck. But the moment he lifted him, Li Jiang’ao shrieked, opening his unnaturally wide mouth to reveal sharp, interlocking white teeth, and tried to bite him.

But how could he possibly harm Li Zhouwei? A casual flick and a surge of mana stifled any attempts to bite from Li Jiang’ao. His overly large eyes stared at him with a dull, mindless hunger.
𝑓𝘳𝑒𝑒𝓌𝘦𝘣𝘯ℴ𝑣𝘦𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝑚

Li Zhouwei swept his spiritual sense across the child. The strange bloodline connection told him clearly that this child was neither a reincarnated soul nor the product of any dark sorcery...

He's simply... not human.

His gaze fell upon Lady Xu’s young face. Her eyes had already lost their light as they stared blankly at the ceiling. A thin veil lay unmoving over her lips.

The hall was oppressively silent. None of the attendants dared speak or move. All knelt together, watching as Li Zhouwei slowly walked up to the bed and pulled the veil away.

He wound the veil around an arm as he slowly lifted the child to eye level and examined it carefully. One hand supported the child from beneath, the other clutched its throat. His fingers pressed against the tiny neck of Li Jiang’ao without moving. His eyes narrowed as he felt the faint pulsing of blood beneath the skin.

The child seemed to sense the threat of death. Its golden eyes widened into orbs, glaring back with fierce, unblinking hostility.

"Minghuang! Minghuang!"

As father and son stared each other down, Li Zhouwei’s grip slowly tightened. Li Xuanxuan rushed forward, calling twice urgently. But an unfazed Li Zhouwei casually unwound the veil around his wrist and wrapped the child.

It was less wrapping and more binding. His eyes returned to Lady Xu’s face.

When Li Xuanxuan finally looked away from the bloodstained floor to him, Li Zhouwei held the child and said heavily, "A curse upon our house."

The family had closely monitored Lady Xu’s condition. Her belly had suddenly expanded in her first month, then gone still, before seeming to resume normal growth like any infant.

Medicines had been administered to nurse her health back, and all had seemed to improve. No one had expected her to go into labor without warning in the third month. Kongheng, whom they planned to contact, had disappeared, and though he had returned, it was too late.

The woman had perished, her face pallid with a bluish tint. Li Xuanxuan stood dazed, only able to ask, "How... could this happen..."

Li Ximing and Kongheng followed behind him. As Li Zhouwei handed over Li Jiang’ao, the child bared its sharp white teeth and twisted, trying to bite Li Xuanxuan’s wrist.

But Li Zhouwei had bound him tightly, so he couldn’t turn over. Li Xuanxuan recoiled at the sight of those jagged teeth and golden eyes. He turned to Kongheng, voice trembling with disbelief, "Master Monk! This..."

Kongheng’s eyes flickered as well. He lowered his gaze and chanted several buddhist verses before reaching out to take Li Jiang’ao, examining him closely before responding quietly, "Not quite human... he was affected by Your Highness. Bright Yang is not an ordinary force, it’s far more volatile than the Twelve Essences. And with the prior karmic entanglements... he was inevitably altered."

Li Zhouwei was already lifting the woman's corpse in his arms. He whispered an apology and left ahead of them. The thick, suffocating scent of blood still hung in the air, mixed with a nauseating sweet fragrance.

Li Ximing took two steps back. Kongheng lowered his voice and said solemnly, "In our Buddhist scriptures, the one who attained enlightenment through Bright Yang, the Undefeated King of Brightness, had four wives in his lay life. He had five sons among all his concubines... all enemies of the Dharma, sweeping wind and light in their wake, killing countless... they were five demon heads.

"As for the Wei’s Li bloodline... generation after generation bore abnormalities. There were consorts dying violently, children noble while mothers perished. That too may be linked to Bright Yang..."
