# Chapter 945, Wind and Sand

Golden clouds shimmered. Gusts of wind and sand rolled across the lake's surface, painting the sky in a riot of colors. A pillar of purple-gold light towered into the air as the formation activated spontaneously, sealing off the swirling dust at both ends.

Bright streaks of light arrived one by one, stopping in the sky. They gathered at extreme speed above the cave estate by the lake, between the purple-gold pillars, and silently observed one another.

'It's the West Seventh Pillar Cave Estate...'

Only a breath of time passed before a man in black robes strode over on the wind. His expression was rather complicated. The cultivators on both sides bowed in salute, respectfully saying,

"Dharma Protector Chen!"

Chen Yang nodded. He studied the shifting phenomenon in the sky, and a general understanding formed in his mind. But when he noted the location of this cave estate, something felt wrong. He murmured, "Is it the Fifth Young Master?"

The cultivators on both sides bowed their heads in unison. One stepped forward and said quietly, "Reporting to my lord... it is the Young Master's seclusion estate. He chose this lakeside dwelling himself all those years ago."

The "Fifth Young Master" Chen Yang spoke of was, of course, Li Zhouming. He just never imagined that someone of Li Zhouming's esteemed status would choose this grassy lakeside spot instead of a central location on the island... It seemed more like a place for a Guest Elder's seclusion.

He actually didn't care much for this notoriously profligate scion. After a moment of cold observation, he even felt a sense of relief, musing to himself,

'He must have failed his Foundation Establishment Realm... which is just as well. Having a profligate dandy like him around makes things difficult for every family.'

His face was a mask of regret. He waited for a while, but no one emerged. The people on either side also shook their heads silently. No one seemed particularly surprised, and they began to discuss who should go and open the cave estate.

After all, Li Zhouming had neither an admirable temperament nor any real ability. When he threw his weight around, everyone had to yield to him. To make matters worse, the man was stubborn, clinging to one or two dead-set principles. When the island issued an order, it was tacitly understood that there was always 30 or 40 percent leeway. But if this profligate scion happened to catch wind of that leeway, he would invariably raise hell about it.

Thus, Chen Yang sighed outwardly, but when he glanced around, he saw many people who looked visibly relieved. As the current standard-bearer of the Chen Clan, outstanding in both talent and ability, Chen Yang was thinking of more,

'All these years, that Xia Shouyu has been quiet, yet she's kept the Milin and Stray Fragrance under iron-clad control. She has a death grip on the lifeline of Qi-gathering. She and Li Que'wan have conspired to continuously raise the requirements for obtaining Qi, all while secretly promoting those from humble backgrounds and branch lineages...'

Chen Yang couldn't say he was opposed to their actions—it was merely a game of checks and balances. One of them was born overseas, and the other had returned to the lake from a remote branch lineage. Naturally, they disliked the nepotism shown to the direct lines and prominent clans. These days, some of the most precious and unique Spiritual Qi was being diverted to those of humble backgrounds, silently eroding the foundations of those with vested interests. But both of them were figures valued by the two Daoist Masters, so while there were grumbles below, no one dared to speak out.

Although Chen Yang felt little sense of belonging to the Chen Clan—at worst, he could just send a couple of subordinates to handle his own Qi-gathering—he now had two sons and would soon have grandchildren. There were one or two cultivation arts he desperately wanted for his descendants to practice, so he naturally hoped the two women would restrain themselves.

'Xia Shouyu knows how to read the room. She's just currying favor with Li Que'wan. Once Li Zhouming is dead and her backer is gone, she naturally won't dare participate in something that breeds so much resentment... As long as she softens her grip, Li Que'wan has to focus on her own cultivation and duties. This net will loosen considerably.'

A bit of tension left him. His expression still mournful, he said quietly, "The Young Master was always highly regarded... We should at least invite someone from the direct line of a similar generation to..."

Before he could finish, a burly man arrived, riding on thunder. His imposing, even somewhat brutish, face was filled with astonishment. He turned his head and asked, "Dharma Protector Chen! What's happened here!"

This man was none other than Li Zhouda, who had inherited the legacy of Li Chenghui. He had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm some time ago. His personality was explosive, brave, and decisive, making him a perfect fit for his cultivation art. His practice advanced by leaps and bounds. The six silver tokens hanging from his waist swayed, a clear warning to others.

In the end, authority truly shapes a person. In his younger years, he was famous for his recklessness and impulsivity, a flaw that nearly got him excluded from the line of succession. But now, after holding power in the Jade Court for two or three years, that same recklessness looked more like authority.

But as soon as he arrived, a long-robed Qi Refining cultivator on the far right had his expression change instantly. He shot Li Zhouda a dark look, and without saying a single word, silently rode the wind and departed.

Chen Yang saw this and sneered inwardly.

'This Li Zhoutui is just a spineless coward with a nasty temper. He's always saying Li Zhouda holds a grudge and is narrow-minded. It's hard to say who's really the narrow-minded one!'

"The Fifth Young Master... has likely fallen."

Chen Yang explained with great sorrow, causing the burly man's expression to freeze. Just then, Xia Shouyu arrived, riding a plume of fire with Li Xuanxuan. The woman's eyes were downcast as she supported the old man, appearing very quiet.

Li Xuanxuan's face and lips were pale. He stretched out a hand, silent for a long moment, his expression tinged with doubt.

'The life jade at Mount Qingdu shows no reaction...'

In contrast, Li Que'wan, who arrived after them, was relatively calm. Her gaze swept back and forth across the lake, though it was impossible to tell what she was looking for. A young man rode the wind up to her side, his expression stricken with grief.

"Clan Brother... Old Sir..."

"Zhouxun!"

Li Zhouda glanced at him and wiped his eyes. "You and I will go together... Back when you were cultivating on the lake, the Fifth Young Master often gifted you spiritual items."

Li Zhouxun agreed, trembling slightly, his rather handsome face etched with loss. This direct-line scion of the Li family had voluntarily given up his right to Li Chenghui's inheritance back in the day, and as a result, he was on good terms with both Li Zhouda and Li Zhoutui. He had also caught the eye of Li Xuanxuan and the others... It was hard to say if it was a loss or a gain.

Chen Yang dropped his mournful expression and stood guard with a solemn face. Suddenly, he saw a small boat being poled toward the shore. A boatman in a straw rain-cloak was pushing off the bank, singing loudly,

"A white horse gallops on the western ridge, descendants await ascension! The nine Qis unite to form a radiance platform, is this human world not joyful? A Demon's enchanting form cultivates to completion, how many find true destiny!"

Hearing this, Li Zhouda froze. Beside him, Li Zhouxun's expression turned bizarre, and he clamped his mouth shut. The surrounding Qi Refining cultivators all fell silent, exchanging speechless glances. Li Que'wan, however, let out a 'pfft' and covered her mouth, shaking her head.

The boatman's Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation was unmistakable, and the Bright Yang Qi surged from him. Who else could it be?

The pale face of the old man in the sky instantly flushed with color. His lips, pressed tightly together, began to tremble. Joy and anger warred in his eyes. He clenched his fists and cursed under his breath,

"Absurd..."

Li Zhouda was stunned for a second, then found himself torn between anger and laughter. Joy ultimately won out in his eyes, and he cursed, "That bastard! Forging an Immortal Foundation with more pomp than a Daoist Master breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm! I don't know who he learned this from!"

The old man was afraid of embarrassing him in front of everyone, but Xia Shouyu, standing nearby, just flicked her white sleeves and descended with a cold smile. She landed in front of the boat and said with a grin, "Fifth Young Master, what magnificent flair!"

This terrified the boatman, who dropped his pole and laughed obsequiously. "Ah, so it is My Lady..."

The moment Xia Shouyu saw his smile, all her anger dissipated. She said, exasperated, "I was wondering who would pick a lakeside cave estate... And which boatman did you steal this boat from?"

"What are you talking about!"

Li Zhouming looked sheepish. He rode the wind up with her and replied, "I paid him well! I was just in such a hurry, afraid I couldn't pull off this grand entrance before you all arrived. I had to toss him on the shore... no idea where he's off to now."

Xia Shouyu couldn't help but laugh. She rolled her eyes, took his arm, and the two ascended into the sky together, welcomed by the chorus of congratulations from the cultivators on both sides,

"Congratulations, my lord, on achieving your Immortal Foundation!"

Li Zhouming, the same man who would burst out laughing at Xia Shouyu's cold snort, now wore an indifferent expression as he listened to the fawning of these cultivators. He gave Li Xuanxuan an apologetic smile, but the old man turned his head away, refusing to look at him.

Li Zhouda was overjoyed. He grabbed his hand and said earnestly, "Such a momentous occasion! We brothers must have a good drink!"

Li Zhouming nodded vigorously. "First, I must pay my respects to the Daoist Master."

After the commotion, the crowd dispersed. Li Zhouming hurried over to placate the old man. Li Xuanxuan didn't make things difficult for him, just shaking his head and telling him to go to the north shore.

"It's just in time for Jiangnian to come out of seclusion. He's preparing to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. You two go together. It will be good to see the Daoist Master."

But Li Zhouming didn't let him go, pressing him with questions about his health and well-being, and listening to recent news from the north. Seeing that he was surrounded by his own people, he said, "I don't like some of the people on this island. They're like fleas in a fur coat. It's still too crowded here. Since the north is pressing so hard, why don't we send more of them over?"

Hearing this, Li Que'wan gave him a surprised look. Xia Shouyu said nothing, lowering her head. Li Xuanxuan just turned and said, "You're overthinking it. Jianglong and Jiangqian have already made arrangements."

Li Zhouming, having just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, seemed to feel little joy. He just said, "I understand your words, my lord. There are many people like Fei Qing'yi. I'm just talking. Right now, Zhouda and Zhouxun are good brothers. I heard they've even gone to the Tangdao Mountain Range. Why must my family always be the ones charging on the front lines? Meanwhile, several of the prominent clans live in comfort."

Li Que'wan heard his words and sighed softly. "Clan Uncle, just watch. The conflict between north and south once broke the backs of the Tian and Xu clans. Who knows whose turn it is now. They are inwardly terrified, too. We are just slowing down their assignments, so as not to make them too nervous."

Only then did Li Zhouming understand. "I see... I'll head over right now."

...

### North Shore

A cold wind gusted through the pavilion. Li Zhouwei stood on the cliff, seemingly gazing into the distance, but the Spiritual Qi inside his body was constantly coalescing, gathering into streams of dharma power from the Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass and pouring into his sea of Qi.

The dharma power in his sea of Qi roiled, transforming into currents of dark gold qi that pooled at the bottom. It rose at an astonishing rate, faintly taking on the appearance of gleaming, scale-like plates.

Li Zhouwei's cultivation was already fast. In the past, he had to practice various spell arts just to slow himself down and hide his progress. After achieving his divine ability, his speed became even more frightening. Now, making no effort to conceal it, his cultivation base soared wildly. In just a few months, the cultivation in his sea of Qi had already reached more than halfway to forming his Immortal Foundation.

'I estimate in half a year, I can condense the Sovereign's Perilous Tread Immortal Foundation.'

Ordinarily, with the north and south on the brink of war at any moment, cultivating now was not a wise choice. But Li Zhouwei still had some Azure Talisman power left. As long as his Immortal Foundation was formed, he could use the side-effect-free Talisman Qi to boost it. The probability of achieving a divine ability was high. It was a gamble worth taking.

Li Jiangqian stood beside the hall. Seeing Li Zhouwei look over, he reported,

"In the last three months, several batches of Buddhist cultivators and demonic cultivators have crossed the river, appearing on the north shore, in the Wilderness, and near Shanji. They have all been driven back. Our family lost a few Qi Refining cultivators, and Guest Elder Miaoshui suffered minor injuries."

Li Zhouwei nodded, listening as he continued.

"There are more and more cultivators from the north. I hear direct-line scions from many Daoist traditions have come. That Murong Yan appeared near the Great Desert, passing by the edge of the Golden Feather Sect. Daoist Master Tianhuo is also said to have appeared, but no fight broke out."

"The Golden Feather Sect has always played both sides. A fight was never going to happen."

Li Zhouwei replied casually. "It's just as likely Daoist Master Tianhuo crossed the river first."

Li Jiangqian bowed his head respectfully. "There is some good news. Uncle Zhouming has broken through... Furthermore... Brother Jiangnian has come out of seclusion, and Brother Liang has already arrived in the mountains, preparing to see Father."

Li Zhouwei showed little surprise. "Let him come up."

Li Jiangqian bowed and descended. A few breaths later, a man in white robes was seen ascending the stone path.

The man had a striking pair of bright, golden eyes. His brow was dashing, brimming with heroic spirit. Tall and well-built, he already had the air of a talented young gentleman. This was Li Jiangliang.

He arrived at the pavilion and bowed. "Greetings, Father!"

Li Zhouwei's expression wasn't cold. He had him sit in the pavilion and said casually, "I heard you found a charming young lady. Why not bring her to the lake for a visit?"

Although Li Jiangliang appeared calm, facing Li Zhouwei made him unavoidably nervous. His eyes couldn't help but drop. "Tianyin ran into trouble midway and was delayed... Her father and brother are in trouble, so she had to go back temporarily."

"Mm."

Li Zhouwei nodded. "The imperial scions, the Yang Clan?"

Li Jiangliang affirmed it, looking slightly awkward. The boy no longer had much of his formerly obedient and well-behaved demeanor; he now seemed vibrant and energetic, yet secretly calculating.

"I didn't know at first... We just met while I was out. We had similar ambitions. Only later did I find out, but I didn't know it was _that_ Yang Clan of imperial descent..."

"She... she is a junior of the Yang Clan, of the direct bloodline. She's already at the Foundation Establishment Realm. It's said she's related to Clan Uncle Zhouluo and wants to pay him a visit..."

Li Zhouwei didn't humor his rambling. He just watched him quietly. "What are your plans for the future?"

Li Jiangliang was already sweating. He said respectfully, "Tianyin hopes I can make a trip to Simin Prefecture. I have also met her older brother; he is a first-class character, a man like Father... Once I get to Simin Prefecture and meet her father, the matter should be settled..."

The Li family had long known the Yang family was hiding a Purple Mansion Realm expert, one who most likely possessed a Life Divine Ability and was controlling the situation. They definitely had a grand scheme, perhaps making secret arrangements. But as Li Zhouwei looked at him now, his own son's words were clear and his assessment of the stakes was sharp. He was afraid this child already had his own plans.

"Your son wishes to travel south for a while. But with the north shore in constant turmoil, I feel terribly guilty for not being able to contribute... I hope to ask the Yang family. We are, after all, defending the river for the south, which would also be a way of contributing to our family."

Li Jiangliang lowered his gaze slightly. "Tianyin mentioned that Clan Uncle Zhouluo also has this good intention. Your son hopes to help make it happen."

Li Zhouwei chuckled at his words, but there was no laughter in his eyes.

This child had just said Li Zhouluo and Yang Tianyin had never met, but in the next breath, he said Li Zhouluo "also has this good intention." He was clearly stating that Li Zhouluo had been in contact with the Yang family; otherwise, how would Yang Tianyin know? With Li Chenghuai out training and Li Xizhi gone to the Eastern Sea, it was only logical for the Yang family to contact Li Zhouluo.

Li Jiangliang lowered his head, saying no more. After a long time, Li Zhouwei finally spoke.

"You mentioned Zhouluo... He is, after all, of Yang family blood. It's fine for him to have contact. But his son, Jiangchun, has also come to the lake. He is the eldest of his line, and his mother is from a great clan under the Chunyi Dao Gate's rule. His background is clean. I was just thinking of bringing him back to be raised on the island from now on."

Li Jiangliang nodded. "Father's arrangements are perfect... Actually, Uncle-Grandmaster Li Chenghuai would have been the most suitable, but unfortunately, his heart is set on the Dao, and he was already assigned a path by the elders... He withdrew himself in time. Turning to Uncle Zhouluo last was indeed a bit of a stretch."

"As for younger brother Jiangchun, I have met him on the lake. He is a very bright child. He will certainly have a great future in the clan."

These two sentences from Li Jiangliang made things even clearer. The smile faded from Li Zhouwei's face. His golden eyes locked onto Li Jiangliang's. He said quietly, "I originally thought Jiangqian was the one with the most ideas, but I never expected you to be the one who dares to act. Have you made up your mind?"

Li Jiangliang left his seat and knelt solidly on the ground. "Your son understands what he is doing. The family has countless talents; what does it matter if one of me is lost? My journey south this time is not only to fulfill my own wishes but also to contribute to the clan. If the situation changes... it also serves as a retreat path."

But Li Zhouwei merely watched him calmly from the pavilion. "Just fulfill your own wishes. I'm afraid that one day, when you come to the clan to demand or ask for something, we will probably have to give it to you."

Li Jiangliang broke out in a cold sweat. He kowtowed repeatedly. "Your son wouldn't dare! I will consider the clan in all matters. This heart is clear and true, absolutely without falsehood!"

"Get up."

Li Zhouwei looked away from him, toward the roiling river to the north. His voice grew softer.

"You children must all seek your own paths. You are clever. But your younger brother, Jiangnian, is a muddle-headed fool. I worry he'll cause trouble, but if I send him away... I worry he won't know how to survive. He's not like the rest of you. Even if you die, you'll at least understand _why_ you died."

"You have studied under Cui Jueyin for many years. Compared to me, your father who is never around, he is the one who has truly cared for you. Go and see him."

Tears instantly welled in Li Jiangliang's eyes. He kowtowed three heavy times. "Thank you, Father!"

The white-robed young man rose, retreated quickly, and vanished into the mountains. A long time passed before another man came up from the mountain path. The same white robe looked almost slovenly on him. He approached the pavilion, trembling with fear, and knelt.

"F... Father."

"Jiangnian."

Jiangnian had spent far more time in seclusion than his brothers, doing almost nothing but cultivating. Yet, he was only at the eighth level of Qi Refining. He knelt on the ground, afraid to move.

Facing this child, Li Zhouwei seemed much gentler. He helped him up. The boy's timid, gray eyes darted up to meet his before quickly dropping again. Jiangnian whispered, "F... Father... Your son is at the eighth level of Qi Refining. I was hoping to... receive a share of resources from the family... to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm..."

The Li family's original intention in having him cultivate the Jade True was to hand control of the Jade Court Guard to him. But his performance had been too pathetic, and that role had now been given to Li Zhouda. Li Zhouwei didn't seem disappointed in him, however. He just said softly, "Go and collect it. Cultivate more life-saving spell arts."

Jiangnian whispered, "Your son understands. I do not have the golden eyes... I am not like my brothers..."

Li Zhouwei seemed to be thinking of something else. He gave him a quiet look and replied, "Whether it is a blessing or a curse, who can say?"

Just then, a golden light descended from the sky, transforming within the pavilion into a man in gold and white Daoist robes. He sat down casually. Li Zhouwei waved for Jiangnian to withdraw, then returned to the pavilion and poured some tea.

"Uncle-Grandmaster, you've returned."

Li Ximing seemed to be in a hurry. He let out a breath and smiled. "I've come back to discuss something with you."

Li Zhouwei's expression was a little strange. "Uncle-Grandmaster is being rather polite."

Li Ximing laughed heartily, reached into his sleeve, and took out a brocade box, placing it gently on the table.

He opened the box, revealing a bright, pearl-like, translucent white stone resting on a bright red lining. Golden patterns were carved into its surface, constantly shifting, and a faint white aura swirled around it.

Li Ximing smiled. "This item is the Six-Phase Spirit Stone from the 'True Qi' Dao. It is a spiritual resource."

Li Zhouwei recognized it now. He looked down at it for a moment, a flash of appreciation in his eyes. "The 'True Qi' Dao? Don't tell me this came from Anhuai Heaven... Did the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition come asking?"

"Correct!"

Li Ximing sighed. "We examined Daoist Master Zhu Gong's injuries. She was ambushed by Wei Xuanyin. To heal her, it would be best to consume a high-level Bright Yang spiritual item. We don't have anything like that on hand. Fortunately, I am an Alchemist and can use a few other items to assist. I was hoping to take some of your blood as a substitute."

"I see."

Li Zhouwei said thoughtfully, "Daoist Master Zhu Gong... It seems they're making an example of her."

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly, closing the jade box. "Tinglan brought this item out. She wanted to ask me to ask you... it shows her determination to save her... She had me bring it to you first to request your help. This matter... what do you think?"

Li Zhouwei gazed silently at the box. He took a sip of tea. "Daoist Master Zhu Gong... her refusal to withdraw from Jiangnan must mean she wants something from Tinglan..."

Before he could finish his sentence, both men stiffened. They snapped their heads up at the same time, looking to the northeast. A pillar of brown spiritual qi and roiling sand clouds towered into the sky. A muffled, earthy rumble carried from the distance. The ground trembled, and spiritual energies surged.

In the distance, a mountain range seemed to be moving. A world-shattering roar echoed, startling birds into flight. Yet, they only circled in the air, refusing to leave, even as the wind-blown sand battered them until they were bloody.

The column of dust quickly blotted out the distant horizon. Li Ximing rose into the air on a beam of light and stared for a long time, his expression gradually turning to one of stunned disbelief.

He met the gaze of Li Zhouwei beside him and murmured, " 'Still Earth'... There is an omen of 'Still Earth' in Jiangbei!"

Li Ximing seemed to remember something. His expression became complex, and for a moment, he was speechless. He silently tightened his grip on the brocade box in his hand. The light beneath his feet flickered, bright one moment and dim the next.

His Li family had obtained cultivation arts from the Profound Peak Gate. Kong Guxi had even entrusted the entire Kong family's legacy to them. This surging aura was extremely familiar. Li Ximing recognized it almost instantly!

Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra!

Li Zhouwei stood in the light with him, watching the sand and dust settle in the distance. He waited until the sun had set and the phenomenon had completely vanished, leaving only the fluctuating spiritual energies in the air.

The crimson afterglow draped over him. The golden-eyed man turned his head and said in a low voice, "Uncle-Grandmaster... what if she succeeded?"
