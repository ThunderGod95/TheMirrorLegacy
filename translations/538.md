# Chapter 820: The Northern Line

The two were silent for a moment before another person came up. Li Xuanxuan tilted his ear and heard An Siwei quietly say, "My lord, Lady An is with child."

He was referring to one of Li Zhouwei’s concubines. A few months ago, such news would have been cause for celebration. But now, Li Xuanxuan’s heart sank.

Still, the elder forced a smile and said reassuringly, "Go on then. Take her to Qingdu and have the Master Monk examine her..."

Kongheng listened silently at the side while Li Ximing stood with his hands behind his back, eyes fixed on him. Only after An Siwei had left did Li Ximing ask softly, "Master Monk... is there any way to resolve this?"

Kongheng could only shut his eyes and shake his head, replying, "Let us examine the lady first."

The three rode the wind down to the peak and took their seats in the hall. Li Ximing held his tea, thinking for a few moments, while Lady An entered from outside. She had a rounder face and looked gentler than Lady Xu. She stepped forward nervously, about to bow, but was quickly helped up by Li Xuanxuan.

Kongheng glanced over her, took her pulse, and began forming hand seals. He examined her twice with dharma light, confirming there were no signs of reincarnation within her. He dared not divine further. Instead, he fell into thought, recalling the appearance of Lady Xu before her death. After a moment of silent consideration, he gave a slight nod.

Li Ximing remained motionless, still staring into his tea. Li Xuanxuan spoke hoarsely, "You may go."

"Yes, sir." Lady An answered softly and stepped out of the hall.

Only then did the narrow-eyed monk speak in a low voice, "I examined her carefully. The lady’s condition is not severe. Had I been within the family earlier, using Buddhist secret techniques to nourish life and preserve fate, I might’ve been able to save Lady Xu."

Li Xuanxuan let out a slow breath of relief. Li Ximing finally raised his brow and asked with emphasis, "Is there any hope for the child? Will Jiang’ao have any abnormalities in the future?"

Kongheng looked troubled and answered softly, "The matter of the young master is beyond me. Judging by his appearance... I fear it does not bode well. We must observe him closely over the coming years..."

Li Jiang’ao’s mouthful of fangs and greedy gaze still lingered in Li Ximing’s mind. He figured Kongheng’s ‘does not bode well’ was likely an understatement, and said, "Will this child of Lady An be like Jiang’ao as well?"

"I cannot say for certain..." Kongheng replied, "Fate and bloodline are influenced by spiritual energy, spiritual aura, time of birth, and parentage... Even in Great Wei, Northern Qi, and Great Liang, the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Realms cultivators still struggle to fully grasp such things. It is beyond what I can weigh or determine...

"However..."

He smiled wryly as he continued, "Bright Yang yields many offspring. There are often children even among Foundation Establishment Realm and Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Surely there will be one among them who can carry on the great cause..."

Kongheng had made himself clear. Li Ximing nodded and told him to go check on Lady An, then lowered his gaze again.

Li Xuanxuan sat uneasily, and softly said, "And what should be done with Jiang’ao..."

"Raise him." Li Ximing responded calmly, "Since Kongheng can preserve the mother, then let Zhouwei marry a few more. Let him observe closely."

Li Xuanxuan could only agree and added, "And regarding Lady Xu..."

"Keep it quiet for now." Li Ximing was silent for a moment before suddenly saying, "I don't know whether Zhouwei will resist this arrangement. He seems to have some genuine feelings for his concubine. But he knows what’s at stake, so he’ll follow the plan."

Li Xuanxuan glanced at his grandson with a trace of unfamiliarity. His golden robe shimmered brilliantly in the sunlight. With his cultivation now at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, even his features looked somewhat indistinct beneath the glowing light.

Li Ximing sipped his tea and said heavily, "Though Li Xuanfeng wields a divine bow and is unmatched in archery, he may not be able to protect the family once he falls into the Azure Pond Sect’s hands. Aunt and Xizhi are missing in the demonic mists. Wushao's life is uncertain, and we don’t know how many of those who went north will return."

He looked into Li Xuanxuan’s aged face and said softly, "The path to Purple Mansion is dim and distant. A Bright Yang bloodline appears only once in centuries. We must preserve it, whether it’s like a wolf or a tiger. Even if it’s nothing like its father, it’s still better than mediocrity.

"If Bright Yang proves too wild, then let Li Jiang’ao be used. Though he is not human in nature, beasts too know how to mate! With enough generations and offspring, surely one will emerge with human temperament and extraordinary talent!"

"You..." Li Xuanxuan fell into stunned silence. He had not expected those words. Li Ximing had not said anything unreasonable, but to his ears, it sounded cold and devoid of emotion. When he took in the radiant Bright Yang aura around the young cultivator before him, the old man suddenly realized, He was no longer that headstrong child devoted solely to cultivation. Now, his cultivation stands at a height where the entire family has to heed him...

And yet, that same ruthless nature remains. If things continue like this, what place will the family laws and ancestral codes hold? In a hundred years, chaos will surely rise—only the Bright Yang bloodline flourishing while the other four branches are cast aside? What a farce that would be!

He paused for a moment, then spoke in a gentle tone, "There’s no need to rush. Perhaps a turning point still lies ahead."

Li Ximing nodded and asked quietly, "Shall I go north and see what can be done? Offer some aid?"

Li Xuanxuan would never agree to that, and he responded tactfully, "It’s enough that you care. But you mustn’t go north again."

"I’ll head back to refine pills. If anything comes up, simply send for me," said Li Ximing.

Li Ximing bowed and left, but his words remained heavy in the old man’s chest. Li Xuanxuan brooded deeply, The balance between the four bloodlines relies entirely on the close upbringing with the Qingdu bloodline. But if Bright Yang’s descendants grow strong... Bright Yang is already domineering, how could they treat mortals as equals? They may well claim sole legitimacy and scorn the other four lines.

He didn’t know whether he’d live to see that day, but Li Xuanxuan had seen too much in his time. As he leaned back in his seat, he pondered, I must speak with Xijun about this... but I’ve no idea how his injuries have fared.

If not for the treasured panacea, the Earth-View Bloodstone, Li Xijun would have perished at the lake that day. He had been in closed-door cultivation for years with no word. The old man had never dared disturb him.

When Li Ximing exited the hall and approached his Alchemy Pavilion, he found several people already waiting outside. An Siwei stood in front, with a middle-aged man that was around thirty-something behind him. The man was accompanied by a woman and clutching a small child in his arms.

Li Ximing paused, casting a questioning look toward An Siwei. The middle-aged man behind him immediately stepped forward and bowed. "Father..."

"Oh!" Li Ximing was momentarily stunned before responding, "Chengzhen..."

The man before him was his eldest son, Li Chengzhen. Born without a spiritual orifice, he had been sent down the mountain early in life. Li Ximing spent his days in closed-door cultivation, so years often went by with a single blink. Thus, he could no longer recognize his own son.

The middle-aged and clearly nervous Li Chengzhen quickly brought the child forward. "Father! I know your time is precious. After I was betrothed to my wife, we soon had a son Zhouming. You were in seclusion, and we didn’t dare enter the mountain. Today, the boy has been tested and was found to have a spiritual orifice... I truly didn’t dare delay, so I came up the mountain, thick-skinned as it may be!"

Even with a heart of stone, Li Ximing couldn’t move for a moment after hearing that. He pulled the child closer to inspect him, and upon further examination, confirmed that the child’s innate ability was, indeed, very poor.

"Grandfather..."

The child called out with wide, hopeful eyes. Li Ximing could only take his hand. A bittersweet ache welled in his heart, and unable to face them, he waved a hand to hide his emotions, "Let him stay here for now. You may leave if there’s nothing else."

The couple thanked him profusely and withdrew. For some reason, Li Ximing suddenly asked, "How have the two of them been living?"

An Siwei answered quietly, "According to the rules of the family chief, mortals born from the direct descendant may not engage in trade, hold authority, annex land, or inherit property... The young master now makes a living by teaching."

Li Ximing instructed someone to take the child away and watched as everything was settled. He noticed the boy had even brought his luggage along in advance. An indescribable feeling stirred within him.

He murmured, "Take me to see where they live."

An Siwei obeyed, and the two rode the wind down, swiftly passing over rows of orderly buildings under the chill of late winter. A trail of scattered lights led them to a small house in town, where they stopped.

The house was far from luxurious; it was just a simple dwelling. The roof tiles were blackened, some even cracked and unrepaired.

Li Ximing had been delayed for quite some time, and it was already deep into the night. The couple had gone to the bedroom. He stood atop the roof, staring at a particular crack, and didn’t move.

With the enhanced hearing of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, he could hear everything clearly from the rooftop, including his daughter-in-law’s voice.

"Now that we have someone to rely on, Ming’er’s future cultivation path will surely be smoother."

Li Ximing slightly lifted his chin at those words.

"Exactly!" Li Chengzhen’s tone was no longer soft or submissive. There was a trace of pride in his voice as he spoke craftily, "Besides... Father has no one close to him. The north keeps calling for reinforcements, and I heard we just lost again. Surely, another round of conscription is coming.

"Alchemists are known to be poor at combat, right? Think about it... if we get lucky and something happens to him in the north, all his possessions will go to Zhouming. No need to split it further!"

The woman beside him suddenly gasped in realization, "Husband... what brilliant thinking! The estate of a Foundation Establishment Realm alchemist, who knows how many elixirs and pills he’s got... Maybe even Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts..."

The couple discussed delightedly, while An Siwei listened with sweat forming on his brow. His expression grew darker with every word. On the other hand, Li Ximing remained calm. He raised a hand to stop him, then took flight without looking back, heading toward the mountain.

The moon hung bright in the sky, its silver glow falling across his face. Li Ximing waved his hand.

"No need to report this to the family chief. Let me be the heartless one first. I can’t blame others, wishing for my death is only human. As for double-faced words, honeyed speech, veiled daggers, and scheming for gain..."

He said softly, "My father taught me the same way. He won’t need his father to teach him. After a few rounds in the mortal world, he’ll figure it out himself. Perhaps he’ll be better than I was."

By the shores of Moongaze Lake.

Li Zhouwei descended on the wind and landed on the lakeside. The snow atop Moongaze Lake had melted, and early spring greenery was spreading along the shore, painting a pleasant scene.

In the end, Xu Peiyu was merely a concubine. He buried her at the foot of Lijing Mountain. The guards and maids were strictly watched, and no word had leaked out. Li Jiang’ao’s birth, too, remained a silent affair, known only to a few from Qingdu.

He walked along the shore for a while, slowly settling his thoughts. He hadn’t truly loved Xu Peiyu. Bright Yang blood often seduced others, and those with weak wills fell quickly into carnal desire. He had thought himself generous by giving her the status and life she wanted. She’d lived contentedly... and yet died suddenly, because of all this.

As Li Zhouwei continued walking, someone came forward to report. An Siwei’s voice was low and heavy, "Your Highness, someone from the north has arrived again."

Though An Siwei was normally reserved, he had reason to be upset. His father, An Zheyan, had just gone missing in the north, and cultivators like Chen Mufeng, Li Wen, and Li Minggong had all vanished. Now the Azure Pond Sect had sent someone again, likely to conscript more.

Li Zhouwei had expected it; it had only arrived later than he’d thought. He lifted himself on the wind and asked, "Who did they send? Where is Zhao Tinggui?"

An Siwei descended into the mountain with him and replied, "The envoy calls himself Ning Heyuan."

It’s him!

When Li Zhouwei reached the front of the hall, he could already hear Li Xuanxuan’s polite voice from afar. The elder offered pleasantries, to which Ning Heyuan replied with a laugh, "Elder, you are too kind! I visited your esteemed family once before, when I was young and brash. I even crossed hands with Daoist Qinghong back then."

Li Zhouwei stepped sideways into the hall. Li Ximing had yet to arrive, so he stood off to the side. Ning Heyuan glanced at him briefly, then took a second, longer look. He quietly mused to himself, This must be the heir of the Li Family. I’ve heard his cultivation talent rivals even Li Ximing’s, and has the temperament and means to match. Though at a glance... he appears bold and overbearing more than anything else...

Though calculations churned in his mind, he didn’t show it, and instead smiled as he spoke, "Back then, a single sword strike slew Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from the Fei Family. The sect sent my aunt to investigate, and I came along for the visit. I was still quite ignorant in those days."

His words were sincere and carried a weight of reminiscence. Then he shifted the topic with a sigh, "Tang Shedu acted decisively and handed us a crushing defeat along with the fall of Mount Yan Pass. Thankfully, my brother-in-law came through unharmed. He should be following behind a Daoist Master now or perhaps even seizing some new fortune. So, senior, there’s no need for worry."

The tension in Li Xuanxuan’s heart eased significantly. At that moment, Li Ximing entered the hall. Ning Heyuan greeted him politely, then asked quietly, "Have Xizhi or Qinghong returned yet?"

Li Xuanxuan silently shook his head. Ning Heyuan’s heart sank as he thought, troublesome.

Then Li Xuanxuan countered with a question, "Now that Mount Yan Pass has fallen... what of Zhao Tinggui and the others?"

"Tinggui died in battle... My Moon Lake Peak lost over half its forces, including three Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators!"

Ning Heyuan’s tone was grave. Clearly, Moon Lake Peak had suffered devastating losses in the affair. Though they still had many contingencies, they could not protect as thoroughly as when Yuan Su lived.

Still, it was better than Yuanwu Peak... thought Ning Heyuan.

Ning Heyuan paused before continuing, "The sect has formed a new defensive line along the southern bank of the Great River. Considering your family suffered significant losses, only Ximing is required to go among the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. However, since your family still has ample Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators, we’ll need to draw several of them."

Before the three could respond, he took a jade box from his robe and presented it, saying, "The sect... also offers compensation."

He opened the box in front of them, revealing two glistening, perfectly round, pure white pills. A wave of rich fragrance burst forth as soon as the box opened.

Essence Gathering Pill.

These pills were all too familiar. They were highly coveted by countless families and used to aid in Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation. Li Ximing gave them a quick glance, while Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard in thoughtful silence.

Ning Heyuan spoke gently, "The sect master has ordered that every Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator lost among the major families be compensated one-to-one with an Essence Gathering Pill. Qinghong had earned some merit before, and since your family suffered losses at Mount Yan Pass, two pills are granted to your family first."

He cupped his hands respectfully and said, "If any of your Foundation Establishment Realm direct descendents have perished in the north, once verified, the sect will likewise provide additional Essence Gathering Pills in compensation."
