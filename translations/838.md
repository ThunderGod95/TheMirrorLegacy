# Chapter 838: The Locust Ghost

Jiangbei, Funan.

The mountains in the Funan region were not particularly tall. In fact, all of Jiangbei had only three major mountain ranges. The nearest was the Golden Tang Gate’s Saber Mountain. Here, the terrain was gentle, and the highest point, Funan’s Main Peak, was barely a few hundred feet high.

"Funan's Main Peak" was a name given by the Li family. Ever since they had withdrawn from the region, taking the Cloud-Piercing Grand Formation with them, the mountain had been left empty. The rogue cultivators and demonic cultivators who flooded in afterward kept a low profile, silently occupying the abandoned cave residences.

They didn't dare rename the mountain, fearing they might displease the Li clan, so they all claimed to be merely "gathering spiritual Qi on the mountain." Besides, with so many rogue cultivators hiding out in the area, each claiming their own small territory, no one wanted to make waves.

A few months prior, a group of demonic and rogue cultivators had gathered to offer tribute to the Li family as a fee for "gathering Qi," but the offer was politely declined. The cultivators returned, feigning great regret, and within months, they had invited friends and allies, causing the cultivator population in the area to multiply several times over.

Jiangbei was simply too rich. Its lowest-grade spirit fields would be coveted and claimed territory if they were located overseas. Who would want to toil in the vast seas when they could live comfortably on the mainland, waiting for spiritual treasures to sprout from the earth with little effort?

And then there were the heart-pounding rumors that circulated in the shadows.

The Li family had always treated Funan as a buffer zone, a place for harvesting spiritual resources rather than cultivating a population. As a result, there were few commoners. With the arrival of these cultivators riding the winds, however, the number of cultivator descendants began to grow. Small sects and temples were established, and the area slowly began to resemble the untamed wilderness of the eastern shore.

It was a scene of peace and tranquility, until a brilliant flash of light tore through the sky, shattering the calm.

"Hahahahaha!"

An intense, swirling vortex of black and white light shot into the heavens. An old cultivator in black robes, suspended arrogantly in the air, threw his head back and laughed maniacally. Rings of ghostly light pulsed around him, casting him in a sinister, malevolent aura.

The light was so potent that it was visible across the entire Baijiang Creek region. One by one, cultivators took to the air, their faces a mixture of envy and astonishment as they looked up.

"I am Daoist Bai! Today, I have obtained the Edict of Abyssal Gloom and received the recognition of the Secret Diffusion Dao Lineage. I shall accept this inheritance and resurrect the ancient sect!"

As he spoke, dark clouds and lightning gathered, rumbling dramatically across the sky. The assembled cultivators stared, dumbfounded, glancing at one another in disbelief.

"Can the rumors be true? How can he be so brazen!"

"To obtain such a treasure and dare to reveal it so openly… Does he think the Capital immortals Secret Gate and the Moongaze Immortal Clan are mere decorations?!"

A wave of commotion spread through the crowd below. The old man in the black daoist robe held his head high, tendrils of black mist coiling behind him. Just then, a figure emerged from the clouds to the east—a young man with high brows and deep-set eyes, holding a Daoist scripture. He had the unmistakable air of a direct disciple from a major sect. His expression was cold, but he managed to force a smile.

"I am Guan Gongxiao, here on behalf of the White Ye Immortal Sect to congratulate you, fellow Daoist! The re-emergence of the Secret Diffusion Dao Lineage is truly a joyous occasion for the cultivators of Jiangbei!"

He inclined his head slightly and commanded, "Present the celebratory gift from my Immortal Sect!"

At his words, a subordinate stepped forward with a jade platter and presented it. The crowd below fell silent, and Daoist Bai’s tense expression melted away, replaced by a boundless joy.

‘The gamble paid off!’

He let out a low chuckle and accepted the gift without ceremony. Masking the greed on his face, he cupped his hands. "Greetings, Gate Master! My actions were not born of arrogance, but this Edict requires such a public display to re-establish the mountain gate. I hope you’ll forgive any offense!"

Guan Gongxiao gave a slight nod, displaying the magnanimity of a great sect. "I see!"

Daoist Bai wasn't sure what he meant by that, but his mind was already swimming with ecstasy. He proudly raised his head just as the clouds to the south parted, revealing a torrent of Li Fire. Another young man appeared.

This one’s eyes were a noble gold. He was draped in an outer robe embroidered with Li Fire patterns and stood upon the churning flames. His eyes were narrow, his brows set low, giving him a formidable appearance.

‘It's a golden-eyed direct descendant of the Li Clan!’

The reputation of the Moongaze Immortal Clan was formidable in Jiangbei. The tale of Li Zhouwei slaying the Golden Tang Gate’s master and departing with his spiritual artifact was still told on both sides of the river. The crowd recognized his lineage instantly. The golden-eyed noble spoke, his tone even.

"Congratulations, fellow Daoist. Moongaze offers the lands of Funan as a gift. Protector Qu!"

An old man appeared, also carrying a jade platter. The cultivators below were green with envy.

‘This Daoist Bai is incredibly lucky!’

Wreathed in the swirling black and white energy, Daoist Bai truly had the presence of a demonic titan. He returned Li Jiangqian's salute but said little, simply tucking the items from the platter into his sleeve.

Li Jiangqian studied him for a moment, noting the irrepressible joy on his face. The token’s influence was clearly significant. ‘I wonder if this is the True Monarch's influence or a Daoist Master's handiwork,’ he mused inwardly. ‘That expression, those movements, that uncontainable glee—he could be a stage actor.’

Beside them, Guan Gongxiao sneered. "Your family head is so generous. Can you still call Funan your territory? Gifting something that's already his—how shameless!"

Li Jiangqian shot him a venomous glare, his voice laced with ice. "Oh? Lord Guan isn't skilled in combat, but you excel at healing. It seems you've recovered quickly from the halberd blow my father gave you all those years ago."

Guan Gongxiao’s face stiffened. He let out a cold huff, and a gale began to whip around him as he clutched his scripture. His other hand, however, remained behind his back, not even forming a seal.

‘This Guan fellow is being so perfunctory…’ Qu Bushi thought to himself, unable to watch any longer. With a furious expression, he stepped forward and brandished his wooden staff, looking ready for a fight at any moment.

The animosity between the two factions was no secret; it was the very reason the rogue cultivators in Funan and Midong were enjoying such prosperous days. The confrontation was exactly what the onlookers had expected. They watched with keen interest as Daoist Bai chuckled and stepped between them.

"Please, give me some face, my lords. Today is a joyous day for my lineage."

As soon as he spoke, the tense, sword-drawn atmosphere vanished. Daoist Bai hadn't expected his words to be so effective, and a fresh wave of elation washed over him. He raised his head and cupped his hands toward Guan Gongxiao. "I will have to rely on the Gate Master's care in the future!"

The cultivators below were no fools. The meaning was clear.

‘The old man is siding with the Capital immortals Dao.’

Objectively, Daoist Bai's choice wasn't wrong. He came from a demonic cultivation background and had resorted to all manner of underhanded tactics. The Li family was famously righteous; how could they compare to the Capital immortals Dao, who also hailed from overseas and felt like kin?

He was already occupying the Li family's territory, which was an offense in itself. If he allied with them, he would be judged every time he used his blood-essence arts. And who knew if the Li family harbored secret ambitions to exorcise demons and defend the Dao?

The Capital immortals Dao, on the other hand, would surely support him in holding this buffer zone against the Li family. It was a sound choice.

All eyes turned to Li Jiangqian. The Li family's head had been publicly humiliated, and the icy expression on his face was enough to chill the bone.

Inwardly, however, Li Jiangqian was celebrating. He could see that although his rival Guan Gongxiao was smiling and nodding, every fiber of his being was likely screaming in protest, wishing he could slap Daoist Bai across the face.

‘Daoist Bai is nothing but a stumbling block on the path to the True Monarch realm,’ Li Jiangqian thought gleefully. ‘Now he's cozying up to Guan, and he'll drag the entire Capital immortals Dao down with him.’

Maintaining his cold facade, he seized the opportunity to dash any of their hopes. Without a second thought, he turned, flicked his sleeves, and departed.

Guan Gongxiao saw him leave without a backward glance and panicked. The man was quick-witted, though. He turned to Daoist Bai with an urgent expression. "That Li fellow left. Our two families are still in a standoff on the river. You go ahead and get settled. I must return to my post."

Daoist Bai couldn't possibly stop him and naturally let him go, even accompanying him for a short distance out of a misplaced sense of courtesy. The gesture sent a shiver down Guan Gongxiao’s spine.

‘How can I dare to gift him Midong now?’ Guan Gongxiao fretted as he flew. ‘The closer we get, the more he'll come to my home for aid…’

He flew faster and faster, practically fleeing the scene. Back in Funan, Daoist Bai turned to the cultivators below, a cold smirk on his face. "Fellow cultivators of Funan," he announced calmly, "I, Daoist Bai, have received the Secret Diffusion Dao Lineage here. It is my duty to establish this lineage and spread its teachings. Is there anyone among you… who is unwilling to establish this Dao with me?"

With that, he raised the token high. Streams of light shone down, and not a single person dared to move. Even his rival, Daoist Huang, stood pale and silent.

Who knew what divine powers that token possessed?

Daoist Bai threw his head back and laughed. He felt that by absorbing so many powerful cultivators at once, his strength could now rival that of a lesser immortal sect in decline. ‘Those righteous sects are so insular, only promoting their own year after year,’ he thought with smug satisfaction. ‘How can they compare to my all-embracing approach?’

He descended on the wind. Immediately, a sycophant scurried forward. "Gate Master, our Dao lineage ought to have a name."

Daoist Bai stroked his beard, pleased. He thought "Secret Diffusion" sounded unpleasant and had no intention of using it. "The inheritance is not yet complete, so it's not right to call it Secret Diffusion," he declared. "I cultivate the Locust Shade Ghost. With the combined power of all you cultivators, let's call it the Hall of the Locust Soul. What do you think?"

How could anyone object? The cultivators mumbled their assent and dispersed, awaiting individual summons from their new master.

Moongaze Lake.

Li Jiangqian rode the wind all the way back to the lake and landed in the main hall. Only when the doors were sealed behind him did a smile touch his lips. He rolled up a scroll on the table and looked at Li Xuanxuan's puzzled expression.

"A deranged madman with a bit of petty cleverness has Guan Gongxiao terrified," he chuckled. "And he can't even see two steps ahead. He's the one who lured that man here in the first place."

He briefly explained the situation to Li Xuanxuan. The old man simply stroked his beard. "No wonder Zhouming enjoys watching plays. The mortal world is just a stage, with one performance layered on top of another."

Though the old man was strict with Li Zhouming, often calling him a scoundrel or a beast, he clearly doted on him, letting the affectionate 'Ming'er' slip out. Li Jiangqian shook his head with a smile. Soon, Qu Bushi entered and reported on the events in the north.

"The Hall of the Locust Soul? Truly a character from overseas. Can't even pick a proper name." Li Jiangqian sneered. "It doesn't sound like anything good. 'Cave' would be the most he could claim… A 'Hall'-level power? Is he worthy?"

There were not many 'Halls' or 'Mansions' in the current era. There was the Northern Dark Mansion of the North Star Lady, which was a residence, not a power. The closest was the Shengbai Hall on the Great Western Plateau, now known to the outside world as the White Victory Dao.

‘The White Victory Dao claims the lineage of the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch, passed down by the demon Xiyan,’ Li Jiangqian mused. ‘It has produced two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, which is no small feat. What sort of character is this Daoist Bai to dare call his sect a Hall…’

While these naming conventions weren't strictly enforced these days, they still carried weight. A review of the last few centuries of records showed no power in either Jiangnan or Jiangbei that called itself a 'Hall'. Only the ignorant were fearless.

Now Li Xuanxuan also shook his head with a helpless sigh. "He's completely lost his sense of proportion. Does he think he's Daoist Master Chang Yun? He's only in the Foundation Establishment Realm. I fear he'll destroy himself long before the True Monarch has to deal with him."

Li Jiangqian shook his head. "I doubt it. He'll last a few years at least. After all, he is 'favored by fortune'."

With Daoist Bai acting as a shield, they could afford to wait and see how the situation in Jiangbei developed. Li Jiangqian had someone escort Li Xuanxuan out, then summoned another subordinate. "Daoist Master Ning is in Jiangbei. The people we sent to Azure Pond will surely find nothing. The Daoist Master cultivates Serene Listen. Recall them at once, lest they offend the immortal's presence."

As he sent the messenger off, his mind was already spinning with plans.

‘Li Quantao is on good terms with our family, and now he's getting involved in the northern affairs. The two Daoist Masters will certainly protect him. If he manages to obtain the Hongxue Dao lineage, Daoist Master Ning will be the main beneficiary, but Li Quantao will also gain greatly.’

After all, the Hongxue sect belonged to the Wei-Li family. Their lineage was strong; they had only been wiped out overnight due to the fall of Daoist Master Guansue. The Daoist repository they left behind must be substantial...

‘Li Quantao doesn't seem like someone who can reach the Purple Mansion Realm, but with these resources, anyone would be tempted to try. If he dies, there will be no need to protect the Hongxue descendants, and the Daoist repository will go to Azure Pond. If our Daoist Master can intervene, he can both watch over the Wei-Li descendants and perhaps get a piece of the pie.’

Eastern Sea.

The waters around Zongquan Island were calm, with a few fishing boats drifting on the surface. A blazing, golden illusion streaked across the sky from afar, kicking up furious waves.

Li Zhouwei had traveled straight from Lie Sea, making a stop at Crimson Reef Island to see the Deng family.

Deng Yuzhi had been overjoyed, practically inseparable from the artifact Li Zhouwei had given him. He had traded the White Yin Fan for it and even refused to accept the promised resources from the Golden Tang Gate, insisting the two items were now of comparable value and there was no need for the extra trouble.

He had happily brought his son out—a lively boy named Deng Buyan. Father and son escorted Li Zhouwei far out to sea, inviting him to visit again next year.

Li Zhouwei could only marvel at their sincerity. He followed the water veins, stopping at two market-islands without finding anything of value before continuing on toward the Vermillion Sea and Zongquan.

Riding the Profound Light, he approached the island and paused, taking stock. The island seemed a fair bit larger than he remembered. Feeling a flicker of doubt, he didn't descend immediately.

However, the cultivators on the island recognized him. Soon, a white-haired old man rode the wind to greet him. It was Zong Yan.

Zong Yan was the original master of Zongquan Island, having scraped by in humiliating servitude under the Hui Clan. After Li Yuanjiao arrived, he had remained to help manage the island. Li Zhouwei had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm here, so the old man knew him well. He came to the edge of the defensive array to welcome him but did not open it.

It was a Li family rule, a precaution against demonic cultivators using transformation arts to trick their way in. Li Zhouwei deactivated the array and entered. The old man bowed respectfully. "My lord…"

Li Zhouwei waved his hand. Zong Yan was an earth-nurtured child with no descendants. He had an adopted son who was killed by a demonic cultivator two years prior, and he hadn't taken another since. He lived a solitary life, yet his mindset was good.

At least he didn't have to worry about being eaten.

Li Zhouwei glanced around, setting aside his earlier question for a moment. "Old senior, how old are you now?"

Zong Yan understood what he was asking and sighed. "I reckon I have another twenty or thirty years left…"

The earth-nurtured children from the Nurturing Spring on World's Navel Island could not pursue an immortal foundation. Zong Yan had been stuck at the late stage of Qi Refining for many years, simply waiting to die. Li Zhouwei made a mental note and returned to his original question. "Why does Zongquan seem larger than before?"

"My lord," Zong Yan replied, "a few years ago… there was a great movement in the earth's veins to the north. A great, rolling cloud of smoke. Many of the surrounding islands were affected. Zongquan is on one of those lines. Not only did the island grow, but the defensive array was also impacted and has become much weaker."

Li Zhouwei now understood. He pinched his fingers, calculating the direction. "No wonder. The market-city of Purple Smoke is to the north. So they're on the same vein."

Zong Yan nodded eagerly. "Exactly! A few years back, Miss Queyi joined the Purple Smoke Immortal Gate. She visited Zongquan once to ask if the island lacked anything. She's on duty at the nearby market-city and is usually very busy."

"Queyi…"

As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Li Zhouwei had a good memory for names. He recalled her in an instant—a gentle, soft-spoken girl who was very likable. A rare smile appeared on his face. "So she's been recognized by Purple Smoke. Good. I have some spare things on hand. I'll make a trip to the market-city."

He left some low-level spiritual materials he no longer needed on Zongquan and flew northwest. After some time, he saw a vast expanse of purple—a large island floating before him.

It was the Purple Smoke Gate's New Rain Archipelago.

The place had once been a single large island, but the shift in ley lines had transformed it into a cluster of reefs. It was bustling with people, and many smaller powers had set up outposts. Li Zhouwei watched for a moment, then smiled faintly and descended as a streak of light.

Near the market-city, a young woman in purple stood on a dark, violet reef. Her face was round and cute. Her hands were formed into the shape of a small flask, drawing in the colorful light shimmering above the sea's surface with intense concentration.

After a few breaths, a wiggling strand of rainbow light fell into her palms, swimming like a fish before she carefully bottled it in a jade vial. Suddenly, a deep voice sounded beside her.

"What are you doing?"

The round-faced woman quickly turned her head and saw a tall man standing beside her. He was clad in soft gold and white armor inscribed with black, esoteric patterns. Though a faint smile played on his lips, his eyes held a natural authority that commanded respect without anger. In his hand, he held a halberd, standing effortlessly in the air above the sea.

"Uncle?!"

Li Queyi's eyes widened in disbelief, and the jade vial nearly slipped from her grasp. Joy flooded her face. "My lord, it's so good to see you're safe!"

Coming to her senses, she answered his question before he could ask again, speaking respectfully, "I am merely collecting the purple qi of the azure heavens to complete a sect mission."

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei nodded slowly. His mere presence seemed to emanate waves of warmth. After being alone for so many years, Li Queyi had never felt so secure. Even the magical wind beneath her feet felt more solid. "Uncle, are you here to…"

Li Zhouwei didn't answer right away. He glanced at the jade vial in her hand. "Instead of having you cultivate in the sect, Purple Smoke sent you out here to gather qi? How much time does this take each day?"

"I chose this myself, for the experience," she replied quickly. "It's only half an hour a day. This month, my senior sister, who shares my duties, is in seclusion, so I'm covering for her. It takes an hour."

Li Zhouwei seemed dissatisfied with this answer. Thoughtfully, he relaxed his grip, and the long halberd vanished. He raised an eyebrow. "Is this really for experience? Where are your senior brother and your Master? Has the family arranged for anyone to watch over you?"

Li Queyi hesitated. "Master and Senior Brother are in the sect. I felt the peak was a bit oppressive, so I came to the sea. There's work to do, but it's very quiet."

"Quiet?"

Li Zhouwei immediately sensed something was wrong. Seeing her lower her head, he wondered who in the family was in charge of her affairs and whether they had made the proper arrangements. After a few more questions, Li Queyi replied, "It was Uncle Zhouluo, some time ago."

Li Zhouwei understood. "Come," he said in a warm voice. "Take me to see the person in charge. I'll handle this for you."

At his words, Li Queyi's eyes turned red. She led him inside, explaining everything in bits and pieces along the way.

The buildings of Purple Smoke were brand new, clearly recent constructions. Faint patterns on the ground glowed with a soft light. The cultivators they passed all smiled and nodded at Li Queyi, showing their good relationship with her, but they whispered amongst themselves when they saw Li Zhouwei. Many of them clearly recognized him.

A middle-aged man descended from a higher level. His eyes were bright and sharp, and two talismans, one gold and one white, hung from his waist. He looked at Li Zhouwei with a mixture of shock and awe before bowing.

"Wen Wu of Mu Zuo Peak, greets you… my lord!"

The title 'my lord' was a great sign of respect, showing he saw him as a future Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. It was Li Zhouwei's first time meeting the man, and he found that despite his ordinary appearance, his demeanor was quite remarkable.

"So it is fellow Daoist Wen," Li Zhouwei said warmly. "I am Li Zhouwei of Moongaze."

No more needed to be said. Wen Wu, his suspicions confirmed, hurriedly led him upwards. With Li Queyi in tow, Li Zhouwei explained with a smile, "I have been away from the lake for many years. Only recently did I learn that a direct descendant of my family was favored by Purple Smoke, so I came to visit. I happened to run into her gathering qi… after waiting for quite some time, we came to pay our respects to the Immortal Gate together."

"I see."

Though the words were polite, they made Wen Wu's scalp tingle. He looked hesitantly at Li Queyi and said kindly, "Queyi has always been a diligent and obedient disciple. It is the fortune of Ziqi Peak to have her."

Li Queyi glanced at Li Zhouwei's back. The senior family member nodded. "Ziqi Peak… I remember now. That's Ling Yanzi's peak."

Their exchange ended. Led by Wen Wu, Li Zhouwei took a seat in the main hall. Purple-robed disciples immediately came forward to serve tea. Li Zhouwei did not drink it.

"Ziqi Peak is poor… and not very peaceful, is it?" he asked.

Wen Wu understood perfectly. But he had been urgently dispatched overseas and hadn't even known Li Queyi had come out ahead of schedule. He could only let out a long sigh and explain, "This matter… I must explain it to you properly, fellow Daoist."
