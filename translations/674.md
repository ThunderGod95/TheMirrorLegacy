# Chapter 674: Fu Xia

In recent years, Qingdu Mountain had seen a flurry of new construction, with pavilions and towers now dotting its landscape. After the main branch of the Li family moved from the summit, the spiritual abodes within the Qingdu Cave Dwellings below were repurposed as a place for the lake's various cultivators to enter seclusion for their breakthroughs. The caverns were quiet, safe, and free from disturbance.

Li Xuanxuan emerged from the main hall on the summit, closely followed by Li Ximing’s grandson, Li Zhouming. The young man’s aptitude for cultivation was regrettably low; after all this time, he remained stalled at the second stage of Embyronic Breathing. With his grandfather, Li Ximing, in seclusion, the boy could only tag along behind Li Xuanxuan and offer a helping hand where he could.

As the old man reached the front of the hall, he saw a magnificent deer kneeling before it. Its coat was sleek and glossy, but it was prostrated as if frozen in place, tears streaming endlessly from its eyes.

The White Ape watched from the side, its gaze filled with a quiet sorrow. Nearby, the monk Kongheng stood with his palms pressed together, chanting sutras under his breath, his brow deeply furrowed in distress.

Li Xuanxuan had already been briefed on the situation. The old man rarely showed his anger, but now he could not hide his displeasure. "A Buddhist cultivator? If he has a grievance with my family, he should have come to me directly! What is the meaning of taking it out on a mortal!"

Li Chenghuai stood nearby, his voice soft and laced with helplessness. "The story has already spread like wildfire through the towns on the eastern shore. Everyone is terrified. No one dares to enter the mountains anymore. In fact, many have started building shrines, saying that if they believe in the Revered One, they'll be spared from such calamities."

"Preposterous!" Li Xuanxuan sighed.

The White Ape gently stroked the deer’s back. After a long silence, it finally spoke. "These zealots are the most stubborn of them all. They delight in toying with the lives of others, dealing out what they call retribution for their own amusement. They cannot comprehend the pain of others until it strikes them personally. Then, in a fit of rage, they forget all compassion, all forgiveness, and raise their blade in the name of defending the Dao."

It was rare for the old ape to speak at such length, and a hush fell over the hall. Kongheng listened, his expression pained. After a moment, he murmured, "Senior… they also teach people to do good, but their methods are too tyrannical… Not everyone of my path is like this…"

The old ape sighed but didn't argue. "The esteemed monk speaks the truth."

Li Xuanxuan’s gaze fell upon the prostrated deer. "Master Monk, since you cannot undo this, do you have any trace of the one who did it? Or can you at least identify his lineage? I fear that if we allow him to run rampant on our lake, he will only cause more harm."

Kongheng paused. "I follow an ancient path; I have no skill in divination. From the look of it, he is an old, experienced monk and left no traces… I'm afraid he will be difficult to find."

He seemed more certain about the next part.

"As for his lineage," he said softly, "judging by his actions, he likely belongs to one of the more archaic sects among the seven paths. He neither killed nor laid any curses, so his methods are, in a way, orthodox."

"Oh?" Li Xuanxuan felt a sliver of relief. If the intruder were like Murong Xia of the Yan Buddhists, who cultivated human heads in his stomach, he could have converted half a town with a single breath. The fact that he had only transformed a man into a deer was certainly not the Yan style. "And which paths are considered orthodox?"

Kongheng bowed his head. "To answer the venerable elder, the Path of Precepts and Austerity and the Great Adoration Dharma Realm are both quite righteous, with principles that resonate with my own path. There is one other… the Path of Wrathful World Purification… that is also considered orthodox…"

The words startled Li Xuanxuan. The old man frowned. "The Path of Wrathful World Purification is considered orthodox?"

"Indeed," Kongheng said quietly. "Setting aside the monks from wild, unvetted temples, the renowned monasteries of the Wrathful Path have always upheld extremely strict rules. Though they are dogmatic and unyielding, they are dedicated to vanquishing demons. In that, they are a righteous path…"

Li Xuanxuan was silent for a breath, then shook his head. "Then it must be the Wrathful Path. A grudge with them won't be settled in a hundred years, let alone a thousand!"

"The Wrathful Path…" Kongheng repeated the name, then chanted several lines of scripture, a troubled look on his face. "Venerable elder… the Wrathful Path is not to be trifled with. If it were some rogue monk from a mountain hovel, that would be one thing. But if he is truly of this lineage, then his actions suggest he comes from a major temple…"

His worry was palpable. "It is said that after the fall of the Warthful Subduer of the Four Demon Emperors… the Wrathful Path suffered a devastating blow. Their major temples have sealed their gates and no longer interact with the outside world. Nearly all their monks who were abroad have perished. Let us hope we are not dealing with a Merciful One…" He trailed off, then added, "Even with the Wrathful Subduer gone and the Merciful One’s power reduced to a fraction of its former glory, they are still far beyond what an ordinary monk can face."

Li Xuanxuan fell silent. After a quarter of an hour, Chen Yang strode into the hall, cupped his fist in a salute, and announced in a grave voice, "My lords, there is a monk waiting outside the formation!"

A jolt went through Li Xuanxuan. He turned quickly to Li Chenghuai. "Go to Mount Wu at once!" he ordered urgently. "See if Ximing is at a critical point in his seclusion! If not, tell him to come here immediately! I fear we have a serious problem on our hands!"

Li Chenghuai nodded and hurried away. Seeing the old man’s panic, Kongheng quickly tried to reassure him. "For this person to approach our gates and ask for entry suggests he may not be an enemy. Please, Senior, rest for a moment. Elder White Ape and I will go and handle this first…"

Li Xuanxuan had no other choice. With Li Ximing in seclusion, the only ones in the Foundation Establishment Realm in the family were the White Ape and Kongheng. The old ape's strength was not what it once was, leaving Kongheng as their only truly reliable power. He could only nod in agreement.

With Li Xuanxuan's consent, Kongheng walked briskly out of the hall, the White Ape following silently behind him.

"We don't know if this visitor is friend or foe, but he is at least a fellow Buddhist cultivator," Kongheng said softly. "I will go out first to gauge the situation. Senior, please wait within the protection of the array."

The White Ape gave a slight nod.

Once outside the grand formation, Kongheng rose into the air on a gust of wind. As expected, he saw an old monk standing upon the shimmering surface of the lake.

The monk’s face was a web of wrinkles, and he held a staff in his hand, his expression as placid as a still well. A deep yellow kasaya was draped over his body, leaving one muscular arm exposed. The arm was powerful and well-defined, gleaming faintly in the sunlight. Circular runes were faintly visible on the kasaya, shimmering like scales under the light. The long staff in his hand was the color of pure white jade.

He stood in silence, but a circle of cultivators had already gathered around him, all of them holding their breath, too afraid to make a sound.

When Kongheng descended onto the lake's surface, the surrounding cultivators let out a collective sigh of relief and scattered. Their leader, An Siwei, approached and said respectfully, "Master Monk… this man used a piece of driftwood from the shore as a boat and paddled all the way here."

Kongheng glanced down and saw that the man was indeed standing on a withered log to stay afloat on the water. His expression was utterly serious as he opened his eyes. His voice was deep and resonant.

"Master, are you of the Northern Revered One's lineage?"

Before Kongheng could even speak, the monk’s preemptive question caught him off guard, leaving him feeling slightly awkward. "I do not deserve the title of Master," he replied politely. "This humble monk is Kongheng, from Liaohe Temple."

"Liaohe Temple?" The old monk was clearly not a patient man. His eyes flew open, the scales on his kasaya glittering, and his tone became harsh and critical. "Your lineage is profound and orthodox, the envy of all. How could you forget the sin of extravagance? We cultivators are meant to measure the world with our own two feet. Why do you imitate other practitioners, flying about from high to high? Is that not indulging in the desire for pleasure?"

This man had turned someone into a deer for no reason, and before Kongheng could even ask why, he was being berated. He was taken aback for a moment, then frowned. "Luxury is a state of mind, not an action. Senior, you overstate things."

The old monk seemed to let the matter drop with a snort. "Fu Xia, of the Northern Demon-Subduing Temple."

'So he really is from the Wrathful Path…' Kongheng’s heart sank. This was bad. He could only force himself to bow in return. "May I ask why Senior has come here…?"

Fu Xia’s face was cold, as if he was trying to suppress a laugh at the question. "Master Kongheng… are you truly this ignorant, or are you just pretending? We are both followers of the Buddhist Dao; there is no place for such nonsense! Are you, or are you not, a cultivator of the Northern Revered One's path?"

The politeness he had shown earlier vanished, replaced by a cold suspicion of Kongheng's identity. Kongheng, in turn, dropped his own courteous tone. "Senior," he said grimly, "you transformed a man into a deer—a wicked art of animal transformation. Do you consider that a righteous act? I have heard that the Northern Demon-Subduing Temple vanquishes demons, not that it practices such vile arts!"

At this accusation, a bronze light flared in Fu Xia’s eyes, and his face took on the sheen of lacquered gold. His voice was low, seething with repressed fury as he ground out the words, "Wicked art of animal transformation? This is the Way of Karmic Retribution! A deer is a living creature of heaven and earth, neither noble nor base, equal to all others. For his own selfish desires, that man killed a deer—it is no different from killing a person! Turning him into a deer was a light punishment, granted only because he was uneducated in the Dao!"

The sleeves of Kongheng’s robe billowed without a wind, and a hazy golden light began to form behind him. His voice took on a powerful, resonant tone. "He killed the deer to save his wife! By turning him into a deer, you ensured the death of his wife, who was already impoverished and bedridden… He killed a deer, but you murdered a person!"

The moment Fu Xia heard him emphasize the person over the animal, he knew Kongheng did not respect the doctrine of the equality of all living beings. He erupted in fury. Not only did his face gleam like gold, but bright, intricate patterns now appeared on his skin. "Insolent fool!" he roared. "Let me ask you! He was destitute, and his wife was sick on her deathbed… whose fault was that? Who was to blame? How dare you stand there and spout such nonsense!"

His voice rolled like thunder, sending the nearby cultivators fleeing in terror. Those who were too slow clapped their hands to their ears as blood trickled out, staggering unsteadily. Seeing this, Kongheng formed a hand seal, and the golden light behind him surged.

*Clang!*

A six-armed Vajra Guardian emerged from the light behind him. Its massive, golden face glowed with red light, its eyes wide with fury. Its six arms held golden chains that spread across the sky like a spider's web, casting down a protective golden curtain over the retreating cultivators.

Kongheng gritted his teeth. "Whose fault could it be! He was poor because his father gambled away the family fortune! His wife was sick because of ill fortune and a cruel fate! How can you blame anyone for that!"

Fu Xia stared as if he had heard the most hilarious joke in the world. A wild laugh burst from the depths of his throat, and his staff began to glow with a dazzling light. "A fine 'ill fortune,' a wonderful 'cruel fate,'" he sneered. "Allow me to enlighten you!"

His staff shot toward the heavens like a white rainbow, striking the net of golden chains with a deafening, metallic crash.

"He lived on the land of your Li family," Fu Xia bellowed, "yet he was forced to live in abject poverty! That is the Li family’s crime! All his tragedy was caused by your Li family! And you dare try to shift the blame to me!"

"His wife was killed by your Li family, and so he, in turn, harmed another living creature! I took pity on him, for he too was a victim, and merely transformed him into a deer… I have yet to settle the score with your Li family!"

The accusation stunned Kongheng. For a moment, even the golden chains in the sky seemed to falter. The blazing white light from the staff pressed down, and he let out a muffled grunt, feeling as if Mount Tai itself was crushing him, making it impossible to breathe.

His spiritual energy roiled within him. "Heretical nonsense!" he forced out.

But the monk before him was no longer focused on their battle. His eyes burned with a righteous fire. He pinned Kongheng with the staff in one hand and continued his cold tirade.

"You don't build temples, you don't establish temple-managed fields, you don't teach the Dharma, and you don't guide the people. Instead, you divide the land household by household… letting each person drift according to their individual fate… This guarantees tragedy… You watch impassively as people rise and fall in the mortal world, and you say it is not your sin?"

"If you had followed the Dharma's guidance, brought all land under temple control, and made all people tenants of the temple, their only concerns would be tilling the land and cultivating their spirit! With paradise in their hearts, the greater their suffering, the closer they would feel to the Revered One! How could there be poverty then? How could there be any need to hunt? With monks to watch over them, how could his wife have ever fallen ill?"

The fury in Fu Xia’s eyes was almost tangible, erupting from his gaze. With just one hand on his staff, he held Kongheng completely suppressed. Suddenly, he raised his other hand, summoning a blinding golden light.

"My Dharma Idol was crippled by these villains of the Immortal Path, my cultivation nearly destroyed! My strength is a fraction of what it once was, and I have no way to borrow divine power… but to deal with the likes of you… it is more than enough!"

The golden light in his hand shot forward like a venomous snake, boring toward Kongheng. A dire warning flared in Kongheng’s mind. His eyes instantly turned a solid gold, unleashing a rain of rainbow-colored light that drifted down upon the lake.

The light was wondrous. Wherever it touched the water, lotuses bloomed, and the sound of sutras filled the air. A five-colored radiance erupted from the lake like a fountain. The light of Fu Xia's white staff dimmed for an instant, and the golden chains seized the opportunity to retract, shielding Kongheng.

"**[The Great Art of Resplendent Light]**…"

As the rainbow light rained down upon him, Fu Xia’s expression twisted in fury. "To possess such a profound art," he hissed, "yet you grovel at the feet of followers of the Immortal Path!"

His words echoed across the lake. Kongheng felt a flush of heat in his chest. He gritted his teeth and formed another seal, thickening the golden chains around him, but he didn't dare make a move, fearing the oppressive white light of the staff.

Seeing no reaction, Fu Xia paused. "Those who seek immortality care only for themselves," he said grimly. "How could they ever care for the common people? Wherever cultivators meddle in the mortal world, they build their towering peaks, and schemes and treachery flourish! The common folk become entangled in conflicts of interest, their hearts clouded by dust. It is impossible to find a truly good person among them…"

"Only my Buddhist Dharma teaches that all beings are equal! If all were tenants of the temple, all hearts would be united. They would find joy even in suffering, thinking only of truth, goodness, and beauty. With no officials and no masters, they would be free from the torment of worldly fate!"

"And yet you serve as a guest elder for a family of cultivators, watching all this happen with indifference! Kongheng! You have betrayed the Path of the Northern Revered One…"

Before he could finish, a clap of thunder echoed from above. An intense light gathered in the sky, forming the image of a vast and ancient city wall, forged from celestial light. It descended like a mountain, casting a huge golden reflection on the lake below.

Fu Xia’s anger flared anew. His eyes glowed like bronze, and the overwhelming radiance bathed him, turning him into a golden statue. "I am debating the Dao with a peer!" he bellowed. "Who are you to interfere!"

The celestial light filled his vision, growing ever larger. And then a cold voice, sharp as thunder, ripped through the air:

"To hell with you, you bald donkey! Go preach your godsdamned dog of a Dao!"
