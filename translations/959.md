# Chapter 959, Merit

Li Zhouwei shook his head and led him outside, lowering his voice.

"It's more than that. Granduncle, please look."

The two stepped into the air, traversing the Great Void. Li Zhouwei guided him north until they materialized in a pavilion on the riverbank.

The north was shrouded in a thin mist, where endless white bones still stretched into the distance. A few human figures flickered into view, walking among the skeletal expanse before quickly vanishing back into the fog.

Although the northern bank below was still bustling, it was no longer heavily garrisoned as before. The defenses were now routine, merely to prevent rogue cultivators and demonic cultivators from the north from sneaking onto the lake.

Li Zhouwei remained silent, leading him across the river. Li Ximing stared at the boundless sea of bones, his expression complex, and said nothing.

"The family lost many cultivators. Over a hundred at the Embyronic Breathing stage. The Qi Refining losses were fewer, thirty-one, with eleven from the main clan. Ten at the Foundation Establishment Realm also fell; most were guest retainers from the Azure Pond Sect. Our family lost two."

"That's not many."

Li Ximing nodded. Li Zhouwei shook his head and said,

"I knew he intended to cross the river and suspected there would be casualties. I gave orders long ago, warning them not to be too reckless..."

"Besides... back home, Qu Bushi and Sun Bai aren't strong fighters, Miaoshui is injured, and Chen Yang is sharper than anyone. When you look at our people, it's the old, weak, and wounded. They were never meant to charge the front lines. The only one capable of fighting was Ding Weizeng... so I made arrangements for him. The Azure Pond Sect's Foundation Establishment cultivators naturally had to take the lead."

"The ones from our family who charged the farthest were the Wen brothers, those demonic cultivators, and our clan-relative Zhouda. The Wen brothers assumed that as demonic cultivators, they could escape with their lives no matter what. They figured if they got injured, they'd get compensation from the lake, so they acted recklessly, hoping to scoop up extra benefits. They never expected this, and both of them fell. Zhouda, fortunately, had protective dharma artifacts and talismans and managed to make it back alive."

Li Ximing sighed inwardly. "He truly has great luck. The old master always used to complain to me about his impulsive nature. As soon as he gets worked up about something, he just glares and charges... I have no idea how he ended up like that."

As the two Daoist Masters strolled into the area, a wave of frigid energy washed over them. Surges of Lesser Yin and Baleful Qi filled the air, eroding flesh and chilling to the bone. Ghostly winds howled, and night ravens cawed frantically.

Both Daoist Masters naturally concealed their divine abilities to avoid triggering any spiritual energy conflicts that might reveal their presence. Li Zhouwei spoke,

"The landscape here at Baijiang Creek has been completely altered. Cultivators of all levels now call this place the 'Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter.' This was once the territory of the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion..."

"The Pristine Water that was once here has long since vanished. But the Baleful Qi is overwhelming, the air thick with festering resentment. The spiritual energy is in chaos. Mortals cannot live here, and even Qi Refining cultivators are unable to stay for long."

Li Ximing glanced over and did indeed spot a few Qi Refining cultivators, armed with dharma artifacts and talismans, searching for something in the ruins. Li Zhouwei continued in a low, somber tone,

"Aside from the various artifacts and treasures left behind by the cultivators who fell back then, the spiritual energy here fluctuates in a bizarre way. Every so often, there's a disturbance from the Great Void, and new spiritual items manifest. Over the past year, this has been happening more and more frequently."

Li Ximing heard this and immediately understood.

'Spiritual items don't just manifest from thin air. The most common cause is a Grotto-Heaven... I fear that some powerful divine ability, or perhaps a Dharma Treasure, is stirring within the Great Void. It must be slowly pulling that Grotto-Heaven back into the mortal world. That would disrupt the local spiritual energy, causing this instability and forcing items to manifest from the void.'

'By now, most people must understand. The repeated clashes between the north and south, all these killing calamities... they were all for the sake of the Wanling Heaven. Zhouwei caught a glimpse of it that day. It seems this is the very place it is fated to descend.'

Li Zhouwei pointed north. "Everyone says the Buddhist cultivators find it impossible to cross the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter, so we've had some peace. I hear Murong Yan and his people are camped just north of it. Xiaoshi Mountain and Tangdao Mountain are still occupied by the Buddhist cultivators... Xuanmiao Temple is where Qi Lanyan and the others are cultivating... And Profound Peak... has been re-established."

'Impossible for them to cross? What nonsense. That's just the wishful thinking of cultivators below the Purple Mansion Realm. This is the destined anchoring point for the Wanling Heaven. Who would dare fight recklessly here and risk disrupting that?'

Li Ximing's understanding deepened. However, hearing the name of the Profound Peak Gate brought no words of congratulations, only a sigh of complex emotion.

"The Kong Clan... it hasn't been easy for them."

The two walked toward the center of the formations as Li Zhouwei continued,

"The Capital immortals Dao returned their mountain, but they can't touch it. Zhu Gong took most of her core disciples but left behind a number of demonic cultivators for them. Kong Xiaxiang was so furious he rounded up those small-timers to vent his anger... It's hard to say if that was arranged, just to make a statement."

"Senior Kong still hasn't visited the lake herself—it must be inappropriate for her to do so. She sent Kong Guxi and Kong Xiaxiang in her stead."

He raised an eyebrow.

"Kong Guxi was weeping with gratitude but didn't dare say much. Kong Xiaxiang, on the other hand, feels some gratitude toward our family. He always had a short fuse, but he's experienced such a drastic rise and fall—none of it by his own choice—that his mental state is now shattered."

"People talk about being plagued by inner demons, but his condition is worse. His fundamental peace of mind has been shattered. It will be very difficult for him to recover... and you can't blame him for it."

They sat at a table in the main hall. The Daoist Master in the platinum-gold robes was silent, watching the clear tea stream into his cup with a soft sound. Li Zhouwei filled the cup and spoke quietly,

"In the eleventh month, Suiguan killed Xindu and the Four Merciful Ones. No one at Baijiang Creek was spared. The world doesn't know the truth and still blames Daoist Master Qiuhu. But Que'Wan and a few others know what happened, and it was recorded."

"Later, the blessed land was sealed, Xiukui went into seclusion, and the Profound Peak Gate was restored. Third Granduncle's disciple, Quan Yuduan, came to deliver a message."

He paused here, adding an explanation. "The information that Guest Retainer Wushao had? It originally came from them."

Li Ximing nodded to show he understood. Li Zhouwei continued,

"I made a point to meet with him. He holds some animosity toward the Ning family and felt lost, so he left the mountain. When we spoke of Daoist Master Suiguan, Quan Yuduan could only recall that such a Great Daoist Master existed. As for any doubts or suspicions... he had none at all."

Li Ximing frowned. Li Zhouwei continued,

"So I had Que'Wan retrieve the records from that time. The name 'Suiguan' had vanished. The entire passage of text was blurred and illegible."

"As of today, the world only remembers that Daoist Master Ning of the Azure Pond Sect used one of the sect's secret talismans to kill the demonic cultivator Xindu on the river. As for the rest... as for Suiguan... no one remembers him at all."

"By my estimation, in the entire world, only a few of the most noble bloodlines can still remember him. Anyone below the Purple Mansion Realm has forgotten. And all the deeds they can't place... they attribute them all to Daoist Master Qiuhu."

Li Ximing was silent for a moment, then asked,

"How is Daoist Master Qiuhu?"

Li Zhouwei's gaze was complex.

"Daoist Master Qiuhu has been in seclusion for over a year and has not emerged. Lin Wuning is mediocre; he has no way to control his subordinates. The Azure Pond Sect is now riddled with factions, in chaos from top to bottom. It has reached the point where it has no power left to govern its own territories."

"According to Quan Yuduan, there are hardly any clear appointments for market towns or islands anymore. If you want a post, you just have to bribe the right person with spirit stones and resources, and you can almost always get it."

This was an extremely bad sign. Li Ximing frowned slightly and asked,

"They can always earn back what they spend on bribes. If this continues long-term, how can the sect possibly endure...?"

Li Zhouwei sipped his tea and replied,

"You are right, Granduncle. Ever since the tragedy at Mount Bianyan, the Azure Pond Sect has been a mix of good and bad. The Ning family was always weak, and now their influence has completely evaporated. With Daoist Master Qiuhu letting go of the reins, her subordinates are all at a loss. The various prefectures are seething with discontent, held in check only by their fear of her personal might."

"Everyone is just using her name to further their own schemes. Tributes have become a mere formality; in reality, they've ceased. I fear that even Simin Prefecture, right at the foot of their mountain, has few people who feel any loyalty to the Azure Pond Sect."

Li Ximing shook his head and sighed,

"What does it matter? Even if the Azure Pond Sect is rotten to the core, its outer shell is still enough for the prefecture clans to feed on for a century. He's just loosened his grip, taking a nap. As long as the treasures in their vaults remain untouched and his Fruition Attainment remains supreme, this is just a way of letting the local powers fatten themselves up."

"The day he decides to wake up, the cycle will just begin anew."

Li Zhouwei's expression was unreadable. He said in a low voice,

"I'm just afraid... he won't be waking up."

The two paused, saying no more. Li Zhouwei's expression turned serious.

"There is one matter I must discuss with you, Elder. Jiangqian is in seclusion. By my calculations, he isn't far from emerging. He'll be at the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm, which means we must start searching for his Purple Mansion breakthrough item!"

Li Ximing's heart tightened as he mentally calculated.

'The Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun is a sixth-grade scripture with four secret arts. It took me just over ten years to master three of them...'

'The Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun is a grade higher than the Radiant Essence Scripture, but the latter's secret arts are far simpler, so it's not a fair comparison. Besides, Li Jiangqian's training and resources are far better than what I had.' He tried to find a reasonable estimate,

'Even assuming he's fast... it will take him fifteen, maybe twenty years to master the secret arts. That's about the same time it takes to refine a divine ability. We absolutely must start preparing.'

Li Ximing thought it over and said with some embarrassment,

"You're right. In fact, we need to consider Que'Wan's item as well. That Whole Pill spiritual item that was traded away... that debt is on me. If we need to find two such items in the next twenty to twenty-five years, things are indeed tight."

"Luckily, I have some connections in the Southern Borderlands now... I will write a letter and ask those few Demon Kings in the Southern Borderlands. Maybe they'll have some leads."

Li Zhouwei nodded and replied,

"That is a sound plan, Granduncle."

He was privately wondering if he might find something if he got the chance to enter the Wanling Heaven, but nothing was certain, so he kept it to himself. He mused,

'It seems Viewing Pavilion is Luoxia's most direct subordinate. That being the case, they must be eager for me to advance quickly. If an opportunity arises for people to enter the Wanling Heaven, they will surely go out of their way to get me a spot.'

Seeing Li Ximing lost in thought about the spiritual items, Li Zhouwei produced a thick letter and handed it to him with a smile.

"This is from Qize. It arrived at our estate a month ago, but we didn't dare open it, fearing it would be disrespectful. We waited for you, Elder."

Li Ximing chuckled, shook out the silk letter, and glanced at it. A strange light flashed in his eyes, and he laughed,

"This is good news!"

"That Daoist Master Luo from the Southern Borderlands... he was interested in that Marvelous Wisdom Whisker I'm holding. He recently took a trip to the Southern Sea, found Demon King Tuodu of the Si Sea, and traded for a rare mineral. It's called Heavenly Star Crimson Gold."

The name sounded familiar. Li Zhouwei asked, "Is that the white elephant who is subservient to the Buddhist cultivators? The one who cultivates the Baleful Qi path?"

"That's the one. This Heavenly Star Crimson Gold is a Li Fire-attributed spiritual resource for the Purple Mansion Realm. It's said to form when the stars shift in the heavens and the 'light of departing metal' plunges into the frigid sea to congeal. It's considered an excellent material for forging armor."

The letter was a thick sheaf of papers, apparently full of flattery. Li Ximing chuckled.

"There's also a personal letter from Tuodu here. He even explained the origin of the spiritual item. He said he got the Heavenly Star Crimson Gold at Crimson Reef Island and split it fifty-fifty with Changyun of the Chengyun Gate. The source is not a problem."

"That's the first thing."

Li Ximing laughed loudly and said again,

"There's also an invitation from this white elephant. This Demon is desperately poor. He wants me to perform alchemy for him but is apparently unwilling to offer anything of value. He just says he'll only take half the refined pills... How dull."

He said this, but he clearly had other ideas, and smiled.

"I'll not only take a pill or two from his share, I'll also refine a quantity that far exceeds his expectations. I'll make him owe me a personal favor... and then I'll have him gather information on spiritual items for me!"

He laughed heartily and continued,

"And that's not all! Senior Liu Changdie has been in the Eastern Sea for over a year now. With his help, the Neck Feathers have likely already been condensed. You just focus on your cultivation. I will handle all of these matters!"

Li Zhouwei couldn't help but smile and shake his head. With a light wave of his sleeve, the doors to the great hall sealed shut. His expression grew solemn.

"Granduncle, do you recall the immortal Order for the High Firmament Pavilion? Do you remember how many Immortal Merits we have?!"

Li Ximing was affected by his solemn expression and asked doubtfully,

"Of course I remember. Three hundred and fifty-seven. Not one has been spent!"

Li Zhouwei said in a low voice,

"In my recent battles, I've become keenly aware of my own shortcomings. After the war, I wanted to select a new spell art, so I went to the pavilion to browse the Bright Yang spell arts. I found one I liked, called 'Emperor Qi's Light'."

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. "What's the hesitation? If you exchange for a spell art, we can both study it. Even if I don't have the energy to actively use it, it will be an excellent reference. What does it do? How many Immortal Merits?"

Li Zhouwei, cutting him off, continued seriously, "I chose this art for a reason. It's similar to the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light spell art, but it's fifth-grade. Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light is about accumulating and then suppressing—it's heavy and ponderous. This new art, however, is a divine ability centered at the glabella. It projects light, overwhelming the enemy with a multitude of sharp, rapid strikes."

"My Audience with the Celestial Gate is already a cumbersome divine ability. If all my Spiritual Artifacts, divine abilities, and spell arts are 'heavy' techniques, I'll be too easily targeted and countered. I need to cultivate something light and fast. This way, the two arts cover different needs, and it will also be useful for your own research, Granduncle. What's more... I can use that Supreme Yang spiritual item, the Concealed Plunder Gold, to cultivate it!"

"As for the Immortal Merits, it requires one hundred and nineteen."

Li Ximing was overjoyed and slapped the table. "Do it! Exchange for it!"

Li Zhouwei smiled and shook his head, a glint of true joy in his eyes.

"That's not the only thing I wanted to say. When I felt the impulse, I took out the immortal Order and checked it on the stone platform in the High Firmament Pavilion... and I discovered by chance... our Immortal Merits are now four hundred and seventeen!"

"What?!"

Li Ximing froze. His heart leaped. He met Li Zhouwei's joyful gaze and, in a flash, understood.

'Slaying Demons, eliminating devils, and suppressing heterodox paths!'

Li Ximing had never dared to speak of what happened in the heavens that day, but the memory was fresh. The Immortal General had told them how to acquire more Immortal Merits!

His eyes lit up. "It's from... all the conflicts over these past years!"
