# Chapter 658: Secret

Pingya Island.

Brilliant sunlight streamed through the grand hall as Li Zhouwei sat in the master's chair, a jade slip in his hands. Golden rays swept across the lacquered crimson pillars and spread across the spacious floor.

Since returning from the lake, Li Qinghong had retreated to her cave dwelling to await Xi Zikang's arrival in seclusion. His father Li Chengliao was also in closed-door cultivation, polishing his abilities in preparation for his Foundation Establishment breakthrough. Once again, the reins of power had fallen into Li Zhouwei's hands.

Li Zhouwei didn't mind the responsibility. Advancing too quickly in cultivation would only invite suspicion, so he planned to focus on perfecting his techniques while tempering his foundation—it wouldn't interfere with family affairs anyway.

His hand rested on the desk as pale golden light flowed across the jade slip, revealing several small characters:

**"Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light"**

With Xi Zikang not yet entered into their hidden realm, Li Zhouwei couldn't access the other movement technique, "Flowing Sun Refraction," for now. Over the past year, while dispatching people into the mountains to contact Bai Rong, he had dedicated himself to studying this technique and made some progress.

His spiritual consciousness dove into his body, where he observed the Juque Palace shrouded in hazy mist. Only a single point of light flickered like a bean flame, continuously absorbing the dharma power within his body. Nothing particularly mystical was apparent to the naked eye.

Yet Li Zhouwei straightened his posture, lowering his gaze to the jade slip with deep contemplation as he gently caressed its surface.

The reason was simple—this was the first time the Li family had encountered, or even heard of, a technique that formed within the Juque Palace. Even more unheard of was how this "Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light" would compress from the Juque point, fly to the Shenyang point between the eyebrows, then emerge to battle enemies.

'It's commonly said that Foundation Establishment occurs in the Sea of Qi, while the Rising Sun governs divine abilities. But what exactly is the Giant Gate? Moreover, without achieving Purple Mansion realm, only the Sea of Qi among the three apertures is visible. The Juque Palace seems redundant in the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao...'

He could tell the technique's circulation routes and pathways were completely different. He could only determine that this technique was incredibly ancient—perhaps even predating the Purple Mansion Golden Core path. This led him to a certain expectation:

'Since the casting process is so elaborate, it probably can't be unleashed quickly. It would require deep concentration and calm focus—truly bearing the style of ancient times.'

As he pondered this, footsteps hurried into the hall. Chen Yang, clad in armor, knelt on one knee before the hall, his voice cold and deep:

"My lord! The Eastern Mountain Yue rebellion has been quelled. Li Jiman has come to pay his respects and waits outside the hall."

A year had passed since the events at the lake, and all remained peaceful except for some unrest in Eastern Mountain Yue. Li Jiman's son had failed to poison his father and fled the city, stirring up considerable chaos.

Li Zhouwei had sent Chen Yang on a trip. Descending from the sky, he had removed the prince's head, and Li Jiman had come crawling back with his tail between his legs.

This mountain chieftain knelt at the hall's entrance, his weathered face covered in cold sweat. Eastern Mountain Yue had essentially become indistinguishable from the eastern people now, dressed in refined clothing. Li Jiman's ceremonial cap had toppled to the ground, sitting askew.

Li Zhouwei glanced once at the old man, who wailed:

"Your humble servant greets... the Grand Concord of Radiance!"

The mountain tribes had always addressed him this way, and Li Zhouwei paid it no mind, continuing to read his jade slip while waiting for the man's self-defense.

Li Jiman's current position was extremely awkward. Li Yuan Ping had elevated him to the throne, making him essentially part of the first branch. But now power had shifted to the second branch. Although Li Xicheng and Li Chengliao harbored no factional prejudices, this remained an indelible mark against him.

He had always kept a low profile, but who could have known that his rebellious son, after forty years as crown prince, finally couldn't contain himself? When encouraging his father to break through to Foundation Establishment failed, the prince had turned to colluding with outsiders to poison him...

Now kneeling in the hall, he couldn't voice his grievances. After rambling through various explanations, he heard Li Zhouwei's light, dismissive response:

"Eastern Mountain Yue isn't large—keep a better watch over it. If your strength proves insufficient, the family will send people to assist."

Li Jiman could only kowtow in response. Chen Yang escorted him out, then returned to the hall, speaking in a low voice:

"Your Highness, this crown prince's actions seem unwise... there may be injustice involved. Could it be Di Liyoujie's doing?"

Eastern Mountain Yue and Northern Mountain Yue had always been at odds, so Chen Yang's suspicion was understandable. Li Zhouwei set down his jade slip and replied:

"Even if there is injustice, it's still Li Jiman's incompetence—at his age, unable to control even his own son... Dili Youjie fought alongside me through life and death, after all. He wouldn't choose to court death at this moment."

Rising from behind his desk, he continued in a low voice:

"Open and covert struggles between various houses and factions are commonplace in the family. Since Li Jiman and Dili Youjie refuse to choose sides, naturally someone wants to replace the Mountain Yue king. Take one, release another—next time there's a reckoning, it won't stop with just Li Jiman."

"Don't worry about these matters."

He strolled to the front of the hall, withdrawing a letter from his sleeve. It contained a series of recent changes in Azure Pond Sect, recorded in dense detail across an entire page.

Azure Pond Sect had been turned upside down this past year. Chi Xunxiao had comprehensively promoted Chi Fubo's faction, making them dominant within the sect. Si Yuanli remained in seclusion behind closed doors, while the Si family faction had completely collapsed—barely anyone retained their positions.

Even the deeply-rooted Lingu family had lost several members from their Southern Sea positions. Li Xizhi had been missing for a year without trace, while Ning Hejing made major moves in the East Sea. There were even rumors that Li Xizhi had been eliminated by the Chi family.

The letter's conclusion mentioned that Azure Pond Sect's envoys had already arrived at Moongaze Lake with rewards. Li Zhouwei couldn't help but smile and shake his head:

'Azure Pond Sect is truly chaotic enough. The rewards for the North-South conflict were delayed for a full five years... only now do they mention rewards.'

Actually, aside from the Li and Lingu families, the other houses had received theirs years ago. These two families were told "your contributions are so great, they still require deliberation." This deliberation had lasted five years.

He calculated the dates—it should be today. After waiting a while, An Siwei indeed came forward to report respectfully:

"Your Highness, people from Azure Pond Sect have arrived!"

"Let's go welcome them."

He stepped outside, with the two men following behind as they headed out of the hall together.

Azure Pond Sect hadn't sent a Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner, but rather a spirit boat. Two people stood at its prow, both wearing pleasant expressions. Seeing Li Zhouwei approach, they both descended from the boat and offered respectful bows.

The leader appeared quite bold and spirited, his robes interwoven with blue and white, his eyes full of kindness and his tone quite courteous:

"I am Li Quantao. I greet the family head!"

Chi Fubo was clearly not a petty, foolish man. Since this was about bestowing rewards as favors, he wouldn't play games by sending someone to create difficulties. The person in charge of this matter was none other than Li Encheng's son, Li Quantao!

Li Zhouwei had heard this name before and understood that the family's relationship with this man was quite good. He said softly:

"Please, honored envoy!"

Li Quantao seemed to have fared well these past days. His demeanor appeared much more mature, and his bearing showed considerable presence. The several people behind him treated him with great respect.

Chi Fubo truly lacked capable subordinates, so he had reactivated many previously neglected talents. Li Quantao's faction had offended Chi Wei, but Chi Fubo couldn't care less—he promptly promoted him. Li Quantao's current position was quite elevated now.

He laughed heartily and entered together with the others. Once seated in the hall, he said earnestly:

"We're both Wei Li—I won't bother with all those twists and turns. Let's get straight to the matter!"

This man's manner was bold and generous. With a wave of his sleeve, his subordinate quickly brought forward a large box, holding it with both hands at the bottom. As dharma power flowed into it, the jade box opened by itself.

"Whoosh!"

The fragrance of pills rushed toward them. Five Essence Gathering Pills were visible, embedded in grooves—grayish with patterns, radiating flowing light. Behind him, An Siwei quickly lowered his head, not daring to look further.

Above were two smaller jade boxes and one elongated jade box. Li Quantao opened them one by one, saying softly:

"No need to elaborate on the Essence Gathering Pills—these five are extremely potent and greatly beneficial for Foundation Establishment. As for these two jade boxes, one contains the rare lightning-attribute pill 'Thunder Heart Union,' while the other holds 'Nine-Stamen Spirit Lily.'"

He held one up and opened it, revealing a pale purple heart and lung covered in dense black veins, faintly pulsating atop several flower petals.

Li Quantao chuckled and said:

"This item is easy to preserve, but you must never remove it during thunderstorms. If it's taken from the box during thunder and rain, it will transform into lightning and escape, scattering all its essence. Only Purple Mansion Realm cultivators can pursue it."

"This is very beneficial for lightning cultivators—it's for Senior Qinghong."

He closed this box and put it away, but didn't open the other jade box, introducing it through the container:

"This is 'Nine-Stamen Spirit Lily'—it can heal damaged foundations, congenital deficiencies, unstable cultivation, and unsteady immortal foundations. It cannot see light, or it will wither upon exposure."

Chi Fubo was quite generous after all. These two treasure medicines were both rare and valuable items. Li Quantao placed them together in the box, then took the longer jade box, opening it with a flip:

"This is a 'Bone Tree Yin Radiance Branch'—a rare Supreme Yin magical artifact..."

He raised his eyebrows to look at Li Zhouwei, sighing deeply before saying in a low voice:

"The sect master originally designated a Yang attribute magical artifact, but Master Ning repeatedly submitted memorials blocking it. This matter was delayed again and again, and in the end, that artifact couldn't be obtained, so it was changed to this one instead."

"I see!"

Li Zhouwei nodded, glancing at the jade box. Inside lay a jade branch the length of a forearm, half bone and half jade, clear and pristine white. Several forks hung with pure black leaves, sparse and scattered, shrouded in an aura of Yin energy.

'Bone Tree Yin Radiance Branch—such an unpleasant name... though its appearance isn't bad.'

After Li Zhouwei finished looking, he smiled and said:

"The envoy is too kind. Whatever the sect bestows is what it is—no need to trouble the sect master over it. My family accepts this gesture."

This magical artifact was definitely unusable for Li Zhouwei. Not just him—probably most cultivators couldn't understand how to use it properly. It would likely only show its true brilliance in the hands of the Veiled Yin Kingdom or the Chunyi Dao Gate.

But he felt Ning Hejing's actions made no sense whatsoever.

"I wonder what madness seized Ning Hejing. For the Chunyi Dao Gate, this is a treasure, but I can't use it myself—can't I trade it for something else?"

An Siwei accepted the jade box. Li Zhouwei noticed Li Quantao still showed regret, and his mind turned:

'Ning Hejing is at least someone governing a region—he shouldn't be foolish to this degree. He probably just spoke up to dissuade Chi Xunxiao from rewarding Yang attribute items, fearing our family would grow too powerful... It seems someone added fuel to the fire, wanting our family to hate Ning Hejing...'

Li Quantao only felt the young man before him had a somewhat domineering appearance, so he spoke more politely, never imagining that this youth's mind had raced through so many thoughts. Following him into the hall, he dismissed everyone around them and finally showed worry on his face.

He said in a low voice:

"Family head... have you heard any news of Xizhi? He and I are close as brothers... During his disappearance, the Earth Abyss has changed dramatically, and his soul lamp within the sect has grown extremely dim... I'm deeply worried!"

His anxious expression didn't seem feigned. Li Zhouwei shook his head, saying softly:

"If even the upper sect has no news, how would my family know!"

Li Quantao could only sit frowning in his seat, unable to relax for a long time. He said gravely:

"Your noble family may not understand the severity of this matter. The Earth Abyss is filled with Radiant Essence and Lesser Yang Light—both permeate throughout, blinding and harming the spirit. One year is already enough to be fatal!"

Li Zhouwei appeared thoughtful, slightly narrowing his eyes before raising his head with unease showing on his face. But inwardly, his heart pounded.

Li Xizhi's jade token in the family showed no changes whatsoever—in fact, it remained as bright as ever!

'Is the jade token imprecise... or are they testing me with words!'

Li Quantao and Li Xizhi shared a life-and-death friendship. Li Zhouwei didn't quite believe Li Quantao would conspire with Azure Pond Sect to deceive him, but fooling Li Quantao wasn't difficult at all. Using false information to stir true emotions really wasn't a challenging scheme.

Seeing his silence, Li Quantao thought he was wavering and said in a low voice:

"Xizhi has an excellent relationship with Master Si, and the senior died following his orders. You could inquire—there would surely be a response! He's constantly in seclusion and sees no one, so I can't meet with him... otherwise I would have asked personally!"

Li Zhouwei nodded with apparent realization and said happily:

"Good! I'll write a letter right away!"

Inwardly, he chuckled and thought:

'So that's the plan!'

Ask Si Yuanli? Si Yuanli was merely Foundation Establishment—how could he possibly know about events in the Earth Abyss thousands of miles away? They simply wanted to ask Si Boxiu!

'Si Yuanli has shown weakness for so long, and now with all his power lost, Chi Fubo has become suspicious, truly wondering if Si Boxiu is in seclusion while Si Yuanli acts for him in private!'

If Si Yuanli truly had the secret support of Daoist Master Yuanxiu, even if this letter contained no specific news about Li Xizhi, it would at least reveal that Li Xizhi was safe and sound, preventing the Li family from losing hope... And if Li Quantao, who knew the information, showed any signs of relaxation, Chi Fubo would immediately have grounds for judgment!

Li Zhouwei only showed a solemn expression, bowing to Li Quantao with gravity:

"Senior shared life-and-death bonds with my family's elders—I trust you completely! But this matter of my writing to inquire must absolutely not be known by others! If there's a reply letter, send someone to deliver it, but senior must never let others know... I fear something might happen!"

He added fuel to the fire, making Li Quantao nod repeatedly and swear several oaths. Li Zhouwei understood his good intentions, but if Chi Fubo was making this test, he definitely had ways to learn about their conversation—it was just a matter of belief or disbelief.

Seeing this matter settled, Li Quantao sighed with relief. Before long, he took his leave, and his group departed on clouds. Li Zhouwei escorted them out of the lake, watching them disappear into the distance.

He rode radiant light back, landing in the great hall, and pulled writing paper from his desk, casually tossing it aside.

Write to Si Yuanli? Communicating so openly—even if Si Yuanli dared to respond, Chi Fubo wouldn't dare believe it! From start to finish, Li Zhouwei never intended to write to Si Yuanli.

'News that comes so randomly and without direction... would truly seem like the result of secret communication between the Li and Si families through confidential letters...'

He calculated the timing—after about a month, he could reply to Li Quantao. But sending letters openly to the sect... how could that convince Chi Fubo?

"With Li Encheng and Li Enxi both dead one after another... the original channel has been severed..."

Li Zhouwei contemplated for a while, then lightly brushed the formation array on his desk. After waiting briefly, a young man entered the hall, wearing outer robes of blue and inner garments of white—it was Li Chenghuai.

Li Zhouwei's voice was extremely low:

"The Deng family left us a secret communication method years ago... Can that shop still be found? Please trouble clan uncle to make a trip to the market and contact the Deng family people. When the time comes, help me send a letter to the sect."

Li Chenghuai asked no questions, acknowledged the order, and withdrew. Li Zhouwei turned the jade slip in his hand, quietly gazing toward the brilliant jade boxes in the sunlight:

'For clever people... the more secretly something is heard, the more worthy of belief it becomes... To deal with clever people, act foolish; to deal with fools, act clever—nothing more than this.'
