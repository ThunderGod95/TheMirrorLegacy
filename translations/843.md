# Chapter 843: Entrusted

Tinglan carefully held the spherical purplish-gold pearl. It was cool to the touch, and though it appeared unremarkable, it was a priceless treasure coveted by all in this realm. She couldn't sense its grade or any magical energy; only its substantial weight was palpable.

She held the pearl up, standing against the brilliant morning glow. The golden light of the dawn, reflected by the purple pearl, caused the throne on the Purple Terrace to radiate a soft brilliance.

The world around her gradually brightened. The Purple Terrace cave dwelling, sealed for years, finally stirred. Tinglan stepped into the void and found herself in a small, enclosed Immortal Palace.

The palace's location was unknown, and its interior was a vast expanse of shimmering purple and gold. There was nothing but a single jade seat and a small platform.

This platform, roughly a palm's width in size, was carved from a single piece of purple jade. Its intricate patterns were a pale purple, hidden within the jade itself, giving it a serene and elegant look. At its center was a circular groove that reflected a faint, white light.

Tinglan stepped forward and placed the Purple Qi Immortal Origin Mystic Shroud into the groove. A ripple of power from her hand caused a wisp of faint purple light to leap from the platform, flying into her brow.

At the same moment, the Shimmering Purple Profound Grand Array of the Purple Smoke Blessed Land finally resonated with a sense of perfect harmony. Tinglan stood motionless, gradually taking control of this immensely powerful grand array.

Though small, this jade platform was the very hub of the Purple Smoke Blessed Land—the formation core of the Shimmering Purple Profound Grand Array left behind by Taixu!

Though Tinglan had single-handedly managed the Purple Smoke Gate for many years, she hadn't been qualified to control this array. She had only been granted the right to open and close its gates. To truly gain its recognition, one had to possess either the Dharma Treasure, Purple Qi Immortal Origin Mystic Shroud, or the Taixu Purple Qi Scroll.

Now that Zimu had departed, and the Dharma Treasure had fallen into her hands, Tinglan had finally entered this hallowed ground, a place only the great Daoist Masters of the Wen and Kan families had ever been allowed to enter. Yet her heart was filled with worry.

‘Is it really that serious?’

The Supreme Yang Dao has been a pillar of the Jiangnan region for so many years, simply watching the clouds rise and fall, occupying a position of such dignity that other Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters would come to pay their respects. At its peak, a single immortal decree was all it took to summon any other Purple Mansion in Jiangnan.

Although it was weaker now, it was only because the great Daoist Masters of several sects were of similar age, and their periods of weakness happened to align. Chi Buzi, too, treated the Azure Pond branch of the Supreme Yang Dao as a burden, a terrible stroke of bad luck. Otherwise, a dignified tradition like the Supreme Yang Dao wouldn't have been so weakened.

If Zimu hadn't said these words herself, Tinglan would have dismissed any talk of trouble for the Supreme Yang Dao as a joke.

‘It’s a laugh, really... Hengli and Xiukui both see themselves as inheritors of the Immortal Mansion lineage. My Purple Smoke and Myriad Radiance maintain the ancestral teachings, ensuring that at least our main bloodlines won’t practice the art of Rebirth. Only Azure Pond has the ability to produce a great Daoist Master in a short period of time.’

‘However... every sect has a fallback plan... my family and Hengli have our blessed lands, the Sword Gate has the various mountains of the Great Western Plateau, and Xiukui has its mountain observatories. Even if Martial Uncle is right, it merely means the Golden Age of the Supreme Yang is coming to an end...’

Her gaze fell on the jade platform before her. Dense, cloud-like Purple Qi swirled around her. Tinglan then cast her eyes toward the Immortal Seat beside her.

This seat was not grand; in fact, it was quite small and delicate, clearly built for a person of petite stature. Tinglan took a step back, performed a deep bow, and then circled the seat.

Curiously, as she reached the back of the seat, all the surrounding light dimmed. It was pitch black, but her Purple Mansion level sight was not to be obstructed by mere darkness. With a glance, Tinglan discovered several lines of elegant calligraphy inscribed on the back of the seat:

‘Cultivate the truth to attain immortality, be neither impatient nor boastful, seek the ultimate state of Purple Qi, and sleep embracing the Valley Water.’

These twenty words seemed to hold a mesmerizing power, and Tinglan couldn’t tear her eyes away. Her gaze was filled with deep thought, as if she had gained a new understanding of Zimu's words. The female Daoist Master moved a step away, her chest suddenly aching with a sharp pain. A powerful sense of suffocation filled her nostrils, and her lips trembled as she began to cough.

"Cough... cough, cough..."

Tinglan coughed for a long time, her world spinning, until she finally coughed up a stream of gray air from her parched throat, landing in the palm of her hand.

She opened her left hand and squinted. It was a handful of incense ash.

A chill ran down Tinglan's spine. Suppressing the urge to cough, she retreated from the back of the throne, transforming her palm into a blade and carving deeply into her chest.

_Boom!_

A cloud of gray smoke erupted, a large handful of incense ash spewing from her internal organs. It sprayed out in a radial pattern, mixing with the purplish-gold clouds in a harmonious sight.

‘It's... a True Monarch's handwriting!’

Tinglan’s form instantly transformed into a wisp of thick Purple Smoke and dispersed. The strands of smoke flew towards the jade platform, reforming into a hand as white as jade that grasped the Dharma Treasure. Her body then slowly returned to normal, and the rolling incense ash dissipated.

"Cough... cough..."

After a final two coughs, she slowly returned to normal. The blood returned to her pale face, and Tinglan immediately bowed, kowtowing nine times.

The scene before her slowly faded. The solid feel of the ground returned to her feet, and the purplish-gold pearl in her hand disappeared. Tinglan, however, didn’t panic and slowly let out a breath.

The Purple Qi Immortal Origin Mystic Shroud had returned to its purplish-gold illusionary realm, and Tinglan had secured the array’s recognition. She could now return to the illusion at any time from this Purple Terrace. Whether the Dharma Treasure was in her hand or not no longer mattered—she would neither take it out to fight nor would she take it out of the Blessed Land.

She stepped down from the platform with lingering fear, standing alone by the stairs and looking at the ethereal clouds.

‘Since this is the case... securing the support of the Li family is even more important than I thought. At the very least, Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing... will become two Purple Mansion cultivators, one an alchemist and the other a genius whose fighting prowess is no less than Hengli’s.’

‘As for Ning Wan... I can try my best to win her over, but I don’t have to help her with everything. It makes sense for the True Monarch to go north to deal with the Shi and supplement the south as a result of the north’s loss. But I received no news about the Shitang matter, which means that girl is still cautious around me...’

Tinglan stood silently on the steps. The morning light had long since vanished. She focused her senses on the distance, where dark clouds loomed over Jiangbei, and the rain fell without end.

"Someone!"

She called softly, and a purple-robed cultivator from below hurried up. Tinglan asked, "How are things in the north?"

The man's face was very similar to Wen Wu’s. He said respectfully, "Everything is under control. Daoist Bai’s ambition is growing and can no longer be contained. Brahma Cloud Cave has been forced into a desperate retreat, asking for aid several times without success... And Pingwang Zi doesn't dare to abandon this place and flee, so he can only remain trapped day after day."

"A few hours ago, Daoist Bai already breached his main formation and captured Pingwang Zi alive, claiming he used infant souls to forge a spiritual artifact, a great and unforgivable evil. He has now been imprisoned."

Tinglan asked, "Oh? He could think of that crime? How much of this is true?"

The purple-robed man immediately replied, "It is likely true..."

Tinglan nodded, lost in thought. The man looked a bit embarrassed and whispered, "There is one more thing... news from overseas says that Li Zhouwei of the Li family appeared in our Xin Yu market..."

"That's good news."

Tinglan smiled faintly, but seeing the man's expression, she took a closer look. The man immediately replied, "He ran into Miss Li Queyi of the Li family, who was gathering Qi. He reportedly waited for a while."

Tinglan's expression changed. She frowned. "A while ago, they said she was being transferred overseas. Qianli told me she suspected it was the Li family's own arrangement. Since Zhaojing and others were already overseas, she gave the order to let her decide for herself... and now... why is she gathering Qi?"

She looked directly at the man. "Wen Wu has always been a smooth talker. I can't just listen to him. As his older brother, did you find out the situation from an outside source?"

The purple-robed man nodded hurriedly. "Queyi has a gentle personality, and Ling Yanzi is senile and unable to control anything. The disciples below, eager to advance to the Foundation Establishment Realm, wanted to borrow things from her..."

Tinglan understood the moment he spoke. She let out a cold laugh. "Senile and useless? Not necessarily. He's no simple character. He calmly emerged from the grotto heaven, and not even a Purple Mansion could get a word out of him. He just said it might be related to the True Monarch and kept everything under wraps... On the surface, he looks like a useless glutton, yet he was still able to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm when he was over a hundred years old. You say he can't control his disciples today? I think he just chooses not to."

"Don’t you know whose descendant he is?"

The man dared not say more. Tinglan's anger subsided, and her mood shifted. She sighed. "Alright... if he wants to go into seclusion, then so be it. After all, he has suffered enough in his life. Don't cause him any trouble over the Li family's matters."

"Should I... recall Wen Wu?"

He asked. Tinglan replied, "No need. There’s no one more suitable than him. He will handle things. The disciples of Ziqi Peak are all in seclusion anyway, and there are no other tasks to be assigned. We will wait for news from the Li family."

She dismissed the man and let out a sigh of relief. She then took to the air, summoning a wisp of Purple Qi. She passed through the dense clouds and disappeared into the Great Void, where she suddenly froze.

The Great Void was dark and empty, stretching infinitely, but a woman stood not far away.

The woman was dressed in yellow, wearing a veiled hat. The white veil hung down, and she stood still. Her pale hands hung at her sides, hidden by her pale-yellow sleeves, clutching two intertwined golden rings.

As she stood in the boundless Great Void, a crimson light cascaded down on both sides, transforming into silver and settling into a leaden gray. Tinglan took a small step back and said respectfully, "I greet Daoist Master Qiushui. May I ask what brings you to my Purple Smoke Blessed Land?"

Daoist Master Qiushui's gaze penetrated her veil and rested on Tinglan's face. She said softly, "I came to pay my respects to Senior Zimu."

Tinglan's heart sank, but her clever mind immediately caught on.

‘She cultivates the Whole Pill, and is naturally adept at observing the nature of things. It seems the Shimmering Purple Profound Grand Array's reaction was observed by her...’

This meant that Qiushui was not in the grotto-heaven but was in the Jiangbei area. Perhaps she was there because of the True Monarch's reincarnation. Thinking more terrifyingly, perhaps she had been waiting near the mountain gate all along...

These great Daoist Masters, who were about to break through, were one more terrifying than the last. The current Qiushui at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm was probably a match for Zimu. Tinglan bowed again and replied, "You are a step too late, Martial Uncle has already departed."

"Oh?"

Qiushui seemed a little surprised. She said softly, "Daoist Qingzhou is truly formidable."

Wen Qingzhou was Zimu's full name, which was now known to very few. Even fewer were those who could address her as Daoist Qingzhou. Tinglan didn't know if Qiushui meant that she had failed to predict Zimu's departure or that Zimu had departed right under her nose. She merely bowed, and the woman before her said:

"A few years ago, he obtained the Valley Water and Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness, and began his preparations. I don't know if Qingzhou got a taste of that Valley Water; I was hoping to lend a hand. Since he did not meet with me, he must be confident in his own ability..."

"That is good. With only a few of us left in the world, I hope he succeeds..."

Her brows were filled with melancholy, as if she had only come to offer a few words of blessing.

Daoist Master Qiushui's backing was True Monarch Duijin. Everything must have been arranged for her. She was the most outstanding figure of the Zhang family in recent years and had even met the inheritor of the Immortal Mansion. Tinglan could only feel envious. After thanking her on behalf of her Martial Uncle, Qiushui said:

"After the True Monarch's matter is settled, I will return to the grotto-heaven. But now that Ning Wan has successfully broken through, I must attend to what happened with... what happened with Tiaoxiao..."

The Daoist Master Yuansu once had some entanglement with Daoist Master Qiushui, and they almost became Dao companions. This incident was once considered a great joyous occasion for the Golden Feather and Azure Pond. There was also a time when Situ Tang killed a Three-Eyed Chaoshan Beast, and Daoist Master Qiushui cast a shadow of revenge for Yuansu.

Although the matter was later dropped because of Li Jiangqun, as a disciple of Zipei, Tinglan had naturally heard a little. However, this kind of thing was a taboo, and she dared not say a word, listening to the great Daoist Master before her say:

"Back then, Tiaoxiao and Zipei were also very good friends. It was Tiaoxiao who introduced me to her. The three of us have a bond. It is only right that I look after the Ning family now..."

"I came to you for this very reason. You can both fulfill your master's last wish and my trust..."

Tinglan felt a slight sense of relief. She bowed and said, "The great Daoist Master may give any order!"

Qiushui took out a palm-sized mirror from her sleeve, held it in her palm, and said softly, "Since Yuanxiu has died, both the "Please, Lord Take This Golden Talisman" and the Huai River Map are nowhere to be found. Yuanxiu may not have given them to her, but many people are coveting these items. I ask that you help her when necessary."

"After all, my family is not of the Supreme Yang Dao tradition. It's truly inconvenient for me and my fellow sect members to help her with certain things. Once we offer a little help, it will immediately lead to a hundred times the trouble... I can only entrust this to you."

She revealed the mirror in her palm. It was small and adorable, but it shimmered with a silvery-white lightning. Qiushui said earnestly, "My ancestor once attacked the Thunder Palace and obtained this treasure from it. It was originally a pair, but the other one was lost, leaving only this single one. Its power, however, is not to be underestimated."

"I entrust this spiritual artifact to you as a reward."

‘A spiritual artifact from the Thunder Palace!’

In the current world, a spiritual artifact from the Thunder Palace was definitely a very popular item. Firstly, its power was immense and its mystical uses endless. Secondly, it usually had no negative side effects, as the Thunder Palace had been gone for so many years...

"It’s just to look after her... there's no need..."

Tinglan just responded when Qiushui immediately spoke up:

"If you don't accept it, where is the favor? You'll also lack the power to care for her."

Although Qiushui's words were not pleasant, they genuinely persuaded Tinglan. Previously, she might have had the thought to decline, but Martial Uncle Zimu's words had completely stripped her of any sense of security. She secretly calculated, and this spiritual artifact seemed even more important.

"I will not fail the great Daoist Master's trust."

Tinglan accepted the item. Qiushui smiled faintly, seemingly lost in thought. She lowered her hands, and the two golden rings fell from her wrists back into her hands with a crisp sound.

Qiushui rode on a surging crimson sea of waves. Tinglan felt a sense of awe. She finally looked up and asked, "The great Daoist Master's cultivation has reached its peak, unmatched by anyone in the past three hundred years. When will you seek the Golden Core... to allow this junior a glimpse of the Whole Pill's brilliance..."

Qiushui just smiled and shook her head, transforming into quicksilver in the Great Void. She left a fleeting reply:

"It’s all too early."

...

Inside the Immortal Mirror.

It was snowing heavily in the Supreme Yin Manor. The round pond in the small courtyard shimmered with white light, and the white bricks on the ground were spotlessly clean. Four jade-white lanterns stood in the middle, emitting a hazy white glow.

A young man stood by the white circular pond. His forehead was smooth and his eyes were light green. He stood with his hands tucked into his sleeves, peering into the pond, waiting for the water to ripple and a faint light to appear.

"I'm just waiting for this mad dog to come here. It's the only fun I get... now that Fairy Shaohui has given her cultivation method, she's gone to the Immortal Pavilion to cultivate. There's one less person to see..."

This person was, of course, Dangjiang.

Although Dangjiang's status was not as high as Shaohui's, he was still a separated soul of the Seven reincarnations Maha Jinlian. Shaohui, on the other hand, was the soul of an early Purple Mansion realm Demon. Over time, if they were to truly compare, Shaohui would not be Dangjiang's equal in any way other than her cultivation of the Lesser Yin Dao.

Therefore, no matter what tradition Dangjiang obtained, as long as the grade wasn't too high, he could always modify it and erase its origin. Shaohui, however, found it a bit more difficult. Besides specially modifying Lesser Yin Dao traditions, she was also studying in the pavilion to increase her cultivation.

Dangjiang, naturally, did not know the details. He only knew that Shaohui had gone to a higher-level Immortal Pavilion to take up a position, and that place was empty again. There was not even a single person to talk to, so the moment his token lit up today, he rushed over.

After waiting for a long time, the sound of chanting finally began. The young man immediately pulled his head back and turned to the side, raising his chin. A man in green robes with golden tassels gradually emerged from the pond.

The man had a young face, light green eyes, wide sleeves, a loose robe, and his hair was unbound.

"Great Daoist Master Chi!"

Upon hearing this, Chi Buzi slowly opened his eyes and looked around, finally settling his gaze on the young man before him. He stepped out of the pond and said casually, "Lord Dangjiang!"

Dangjiang loved to hear this and nodded repeatedly, laughing. "Who's the unlucky one you've brought in this time?"

"An ignorant fool of a peacock..."

Chi Buzi had clearly come with a great accomplishment, but his expression was not good. He seemed preoccupied and replied, "It's that same old broken Peacock Temple. I've captured another one this time. The higher-ups will definitely blow up, so we'll have to find a new location next time..."

He observed Dangjiang's expression, sighed, and replied, "Yuanxiu failed his breakthrough and even turned into a Demon. He had many ideas, but he died a miserable death."

Chi Buzi explained casually. Dangjiang had once shared a body with him, so he naturally knew of Yuanxiu. He pursed his lips and said, "Oh, so it was that rigid old man. He just broke through to the Golden Core and died so miserably."

Chi Buzi was absent-minded, seemingly weighed down by a heavy worry. He was a person of deep thought, and yet he appeared so preoccupied that Dangjiang noticed something was off and whispered, "Why did you come up this time? A single peacock doesn't seem to be enough to exchange for that Purple Mansion cultivation method... there was no need for you to make this trip..."

Dangjiang naturally hoped he would come up every time so at least there would be someone to talk to. But Chi Buzi put seeking immortality first in all things and would not waste time on anything. There must be a reason for him to come up.

Sure enough, when Dangjiang asked, Chi Buzi immediately spoke. His face was grim, and he said in a low voice, "I went to the Shu region a few days ago and saw a thousand miles of drought. The heavens did not rain, and the springs dried up. This is a sign that the Pristine Water is not flourishing."

Upon hearing this, Dangjiang was surprised. "Isn't this a good thing? The person above your head wishes all Pristine Water cultivators were dead. If it weren't for the fact that severing all their inheritances would offend the Underworld, he wouldn't show any mercy! If he gets a little hurt, it's a perfect chance for you to make some small moves..."

Chi Buzi shook his head slightly and said in a deep voice, "Is this a place to talk?"

This courtyard was empty, without even a table or a chair, clearly not a place for conversation. Dangjiang led him to a small side courtyard. Once the door was closed, Chi Buzi said, "Whether Pristine Water is more or less hurt, it doesn't affect me much. But since the sign of Pristine Water has appeared, it's likely that the battle has reached a crucial point, and he might be coming back!"

Dangjiang was stunned and whispered, "He comes back, so what...? You don't cultivate Purging Dew, and you're going to cultivate Morning Cold Rain. How can he even suspect you? Even if he comes back... when he sees your path is cut off, he should be even more relaxed and let his guard down..."

Chi Buzi's face was grim. He said in a low voice, "You don't understand... you don't understand what Pristine Water is like... I have been to his Pristine Speech Heaven. He is a stingy True Monarch, a sinister person who pays attention to every detail... A person like that... a person like that will not let go of the slightest doubt..."

Dangjiang grew suspicious, looking at his grim face. He asked, "What do you want to do?"

Chi Buzi looked at him deeply, his tone cold. He replied, "I have been to his Pristine Speech Heaven. My life, my death, and my progress in cultivation are all within his sight. When he returns from beyond the heavens, all the clear ponds in the world will be his followers."

"I have cultivated the Chou-Gui Hidden Form. If he returns, he might pay attention to me."

Dangjiang understood even less. He shook his head and said, "The Chou-Gui Hidden Form is not the Purging Dew. The cultivation method is available, and there's no shortage of spiritual energy. So many people in the world cultivate it. It's not surprising that you succeeded. He can't investigate every single one, can he?"

Chi Buzi slowly shook his head and whispered, "I didn't use the 'Art of Rebirth,' yet I still succeeded. To Pristine Water, where this Purple Mansion cultivation method came from is worth investigating."

His light green eyes looked over, filled with extreme calm. His hands on the table clenched into fists, and he said in a low voice, "If I were him, I would definitely investigate. That's enough."
