# Chapter 775: Sorting the Aftermath

This reprimand from Daoist Master Lingmei was blunt, almost an open scolding, yet Chengyan did not dare show the slightest hint of dissatisfaction, standing with his head bowed obediently.

Lingmei sat upright with his sword on his back, admonishing him as if he were a junior:

"Changxiao is a treacherous one. I saw long ago that he was vicious and his schemes poisonous. And now he’s taught you to be just the same, utterly lacking in composure!"

Chengyan could only nod in agreement. Lingmei continued, his face cold:

"It’s useless talking to you. You lot from overseas are all unscrupulous, stirring up such a commotion. You bring out one Dharma Artifact after another. That Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope belongs to Situ Huo. How did it end up in your hands?"

Hearing this, Chengyan shook his head and replied, "Senior, that Dharma Artifact was either given by Situ Huo, or the Situ family found it somewhere. It truly has nothing to do with my sect. How could it be a Dharma Artifact supplied by Changxiao…"

"Who knows," Lingmei sneered.

"The Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope isn't a signature Changxiao artifact like the Yongjing Profound Ring. If you really did provide it, who would ever know? What's the plan for it now?"

Chengyan raised his eyes, slightly embarrassed, and said in a low voice, "Daoist Master Tianhuo... should be on his way to retrieve it. After all, it was meant to be given to them."

The Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope had fallen into the hands of the Golden Feather Sect the moment it appeared. If it was something Changxiao Gate had acquired, this would look like a massive loss. But Lingmei remembered clearly, and said:

"Changxiao really does make good bargains. Situ Huo pledged the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope to the Golden Feather Sect back then. Later, he was driven out, missed the rendezvous, and remained in hiding to nurse his injuries, so the Dharma Artifact stayed with him..."

"I'm afraid Changxiao was entrusted by him, took some benefit, and was supposed to return this item. But it’s a hot potato; you couldn't even use it once without being linked to Situ Huo, inviting a whole crowd for interrogation. So you conveniently threw it into Situ Mo's hands, letting him use it once while also wiping your own hands clean..."

Although Daoist Master Lingmei was a conservative and stubborn member of the Sword Gate, he himself was not bound by convention. His mind was flexible. While this was his speculation, it was very likely the truth. He dared to say it, but Chengyan did not dare to confirm it, only replying:

"Senior jests. This matter is so complicated, and our sect's Daoist Master has not returned from the Eastern Sea. His whereabouts are still unknown. How could we possibly arrange so many things…"

Seeing him continue to play dumb, Lingmei scoffed and replied, "I won't waste any more words on you. I fear if you stay longer, you'll run out and get killed by Hengli, and the blame will land on my Sword Gate. This matter ends here. Do not stir up any more trouble near my Sword Gate's territory!"

As if granted amnesty, Chengyan immediately took his leave. Lingmei remained seated in the Great Void, feeling rather relaxed.

'Li Zhouwei gave me a good excuse. I didn't get dragged into it, and now he owes me a favor. Just showing up to intimidate Chengyan was enough to stop others from fanning the flames. Li Ximing gave me enough face, so with this, both human sentiment and face are fully satisfied!'

He stood up cheerfully, took the treasured sword from his back, and held it in his arms, laughing inwardly:

'Now let's see if those old fogeys in the sect can still lecture me about morality and orthodoxy... claiming I'm a heretic who has strayed from the Sword Heart... If I had hidden away adhering to the Immortal Abode's rules, how could I have saved Li Zhouwei? When rules and morality conflict, I'd like to see what you have to say now!'

***

Moongaze Lake.

The sky was gloomy, laced with crackling thunder. A continuous, dreary rain drifted through the air, scattering across the vast expanse.

The faint golden radiance of the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope hung frozen in the sky, the ferocious Radiant Fire suppressed beneath it. A golden stream of light rose up as a white-haired old man in a Golden Tang Daoist robe formed hand seals to cast a technique.

"Situ Biao!"

The red-skirted woman and the others were trapped by the Dharma Artifact, unable to advance or retreat. The Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope was an item of both Earth Virtue and Metal Virtue, making it difficult to effectively counter. It scattered chaotic, pale-golden light, pushing them back time and again.

The Golden Tang Gate had the upper hand, but Situ Biao's expression was as ugly as if he’d seen a ghost. It was laced with despair.

Situ Biao was one of the few remaining elders. His bloodline wasn't particularly close to the main branch, but his cultivation was high, which was the only reason he had survived round after round of purges. He wasn't stupid. Having reached this point, even if he couldn't see the full network of plots behind the scenes, he had sensed enough.

He could accept Situ Mo using him as cannon fodder. Situ Biao didn't have much lifespan left anyway, and he reckoned trading his worthless old life for Situ Mo's escape wasn't a loss. Besides, with a Dharma Artifact in hand, he could at least deceive himself. But who knew that right in the heat of battle, a vast and familiar surge of Golden Baleful Qi would suddenly erupt in the east, soaring to the heavens.

*Crack...*

The jade talisman in his sleeve shattered. The talisman the old man held tightly in his hand even loosened its grip. He hesitated, but ultimately, he did not throw it. Instead, he put it back safely in his storage pouch.

Situ Mo was dead. There was no need for him to hold out here.

"Pfft."

Not far away, Li Minggong spat out a mouthful of blood. She too looked up at the pillar of Golden Baleful Qi rising in the distance. Tears welled in her eyes again, but through the blur, she saw that the wretched light of the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope had frozen solid.

Everyone's techniques solidified in mid-air. Even the roiling Radiant Fire stopped, as if it were a sculpture. The mountain and river patterns on the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope abruptly dimmed. A hand and half a sleeve reached out of the empty air.

The sleeve was embroidered with golden flame patterns, its cuff adorned with golden stone and wind-blown sand. The hand itself was fair and delicate, with long fingers.

This hand lightly pinched the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope. The gray rope, so imperious just a moment ago, twitched in his grasp like a dead snake and, under the petrified gaze of the crowd, vanished.

A full breath passed before the flowing mountain patterns in the sky belatedly faded. The space beside Situ Biao was suddenly empty. The old man trembled in the air like a plucked chicken.

"Clang!"

Tears streaming, Li Minggong held her lamp in one hand and activated the Capital immortals Dao Bell. With the other hand, she drew the sword from her waist and shouted:

"Your Golden Tang Gate's actions... even a Daoist Master couldn't bear to watch!"

Situ Biao's scalp went numb. An ill wind was already rising beneath his feet. He hurriedly took the talisman out again, concealing it in his hand as he yelled into the oncoming wave of Radiant Fire:

"Retreat!"

The Chongming Profound Insight Screen was still in the sky. Without the support of the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope, the Golden Tang Gate's techniques were almost half-useless. There was no point in fighting. The old man just held the talisman high and shouted:

"Li Minggong! Don't force my hand!"

Li Minggong tearfully called for her people to halt, allowing Situ Biao to retreat several miles. She rode her True Fire, glaring after them with hatred, but then she paused, stunned.

She wasn't the only one. Elder White Ape, Li Wen, and the others all froze in mid-air. Far in the distance, Situ Biao was once again frozen, unable to move, the light around his body ceasing to pulse.

The same hand with the golden stone and flame sleeve emerged from the Great Void again. It stretched out five fingers and, with a *whoosh*, plucked the talisman right out of Situ Biao's hand.

'This...'

Despair washed over the faces of the Golden Tang Gate cultivators, one after another. But the frozen state did not break. The Daoist Master stepped fully out of the Great Void. He wore robes of golden stone, wind-blown sand, and flowing flames. He was seven chi tall, with elegant brows, handsome eyes, and his hair bound up.

This Daoist Master flipped the talisman over in his hand and asked:

"Any more?"

Situ Biao trembled in terror, shaking his head frantically. The Daoist Master said, "Oh," turned, and stepped back into the Great Void.

Only then did Situ Biao and his men, drenched in sweat, flee on the wind. The Li clan cultivators didn't dare approach the Daoist Master, so they had no choice but to let them escape.

Once Situ Biao's group was gone, Li Minggong finally crumpled, her vision going dark as she nearly fainted. Li Chenghuai quickly stepped forward to support her.

She had rushed to provide aid, then fought a desperate battle against Situ Biao, who wielded a Dharma Artifact. Her heart had been frantic, and she had lost her composure, fighting the hardest of anyone. Her spiritual qi was long since exhausted; she had only been forcing herself to stand straight.

"Elder Sister..."

Li Chenghuai supported Li Minggong and looked around. Everyone was wounded.

Elder White Ape had reverted to his original form to resist the Situ family and had his heart and lungs pierced by a golden hook. His body was covered in gouges where his flesh had been ripped away. Now, back in the form of a white-haired, robust man, many wounds were deep enough to see bone.

Li Wen's strength wasn't enough to fight alone, so he had assisted Elder White Ape and was not badly injured. Miaoshui, who had only recently recovered, had been wounded again—her collarbone was pierced, and half her neck had been carved off. Though she had patched it with Converging Water, it still looked hideous.

The old man Qu Bushi had little combat ability to begin with, so fighting desperately hadn't helped much. He just had a few broken bones. The old man simply stared at the devastated Funan territory below him, his heart aching.

As Li Chenghuai was taking stock, Li Minggong recovered her breath and stood straight in the fire. "Where is Ding Weizeng!" she asked in a low voice.

Before they arrived, Ding Weizeng had held off the entire Golden Tang contingent by himself. His injuries could only be severe. Now that he was nowhere to be seen, he was likely in terrible trouble.

"No phenomenon has appeared. He should be fine," Li Chenghuai comforted her.

They descended together into the main hall. Li Minggong wiped away her tears and asked, "How is the Clan Head's life jade... That golden baleful qi in the east, was that Situ Mo's death?"

"I'll go ask right now."

Li Chenghuai replied and quickly left the hall. Li Minggong looked at the gazes of the surrounding cultivators, gritted her teeth, and said, "Where is Sun Bai? Bring him here, quickly."

Miaoshui said in a low voice from the side, "During the fight with the Capital immortals Dao, when we retreated, Guest Elder Sun Bai... lacks combat ability. He couldn't get away and seemed to be forced into a formation somewhere in the mountains to hide."

Miaoshui was being polite. The Capital immortals Dao had intentionally let them go. Sun Bai could have left with them. But caught between a wolf in front and a tiger behind, the man's nerve had broken. He had feigned defeat to flee and hide.

Li Minggong had already stopped her tears. Sun Bai's actions were understandable, and it wasn't as if they relied on him heavily. To put it nicely, it was more useful for him to preserve his life. She only said, "This is precisely when we need him. Hurry and bring him."

They looked at each other. Li Wen clearly wanted to guard Li Minggong and didn't move an inch. Qu Bushi, being relatively lightly injured, flew up and out of the hall, heading east.

Only then did Li Minggong sit in the master's seat, feeling the world spin. She wielded the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier and the Capital immortals Dao Bell, and had also been controlling the Chongming Profound Insight Screen. She had been the main force resisting the Mountain-Shrouding Earth-Moving Rope and had suffered many internal injuries. Though she looked fine on the surface, her insides were a wreck.

They waited a while. Sun Bai had not arrived, but a streak of white light first flew across the sky, dancing elegantly as if stepping on stairs in the air, landing outside the hall.

The white light resolved into a figure in a pale white Daoist robe, looking refined and scholarly, his face etched with worry. It should have been a very civilized attire, but it was singed in several places by Merging Fire, making him look rather battered.

It was Cui Jueyin who had arrived first.

"Lord Cui!"

Li Wen immediately went forward. Compared to the other outsiders, he seemed to trust Cui Jueyin, whom Li Ximing had brought back, far more, pulling him over.

Cui Jueyin saw that more than half of Li Wen's jade armor was shattered and his aura was weak. He felt a trace of unease. Seeing the sorrow on everyone's faces, his suspicions were finally confirmed. His heart dropped. "When I saw the thunder shake, I knew something was wrong... Damn it..."

Hearing this, Li Minggong coughed, hiding the blood she brought up in her palm. She took out a pill and swallowed it. "Many thanks for holding off Guo Hongjian in the wilderness. If not for you, the wilderness would have been in peril."

Cui Jueyin cupped his hands. "It was not my achievement alone. Profound Peak Gate has one Fu Yuezi. That man's strength is outstanding. His artifact skills and Daoist cultivation are extraordinary; he must be the foremost expert of Profound Peak."

Just as he finished speaking, Qu Bushi hurried in with Sun Bai. The old man Sun Bai looked wretched and somewhat ashamed. He bowed. "My strength was insufficient. Please punish me, milady."

Li Minggong had no patience for pleasantries and immediately told him to come and check her pulse. Only then did Sun Bai lift his robes, step forward, and conjure a green light with his Immortal Foundation's wondrous ability. As he placed it on her fair wrist, his expression changed to one of utter shock, and he quickly closed his eyes to circulate his spiritual qi.

Li Minggong's complexion improved slightly. She swallowed a mouthful of blood, and her speech became smoother. "Quick," she said urgently, "go find Ding Weizeng... Send everyone out. We must find him first. Nothing can happen to him."

As she spoke, she pulled her hand back and motioned for Sun Bai to check Miaoshui's and Elder White Ape's injuries first. She coughed twice and asked, "That Daoist Master from before. Do any of you recognize him?"

Miaoshui had been listening from the side. Just as Sun Bai was about to check her injuries, she pushed him toward the old ape and spoke up. "I cultivated in this area in my early years and had an... entanglement with a Golden Feather disciple. Because of family matters, it never came to fruition. From the description I heard, this should be the youngest of the Golden Feather Sect's Tian generation, Daoist Master Tianhuo..."

Li Minggong committed the name to memory. After Sun Bai had checked everyone and analyzed their injuries, she sent them away to heal, then turned to Cui Jueyin. "I'll have to trouble you to lead the search."

Cui Jueyin nodded, left, and departed as a streak of light. The entire hall fell silent, leaving only Li Wen sitting cross-legged outside the hall, silently guarding her.

Only then did Li Minggong let the tears fall, coughing softly. Her heart ached as she thought:

'Now... in the entire clan, it's just me and Chenghuai. Chenghuai was brought out later by Uncle Jun and lacks the same connection and prestige... He can't step up... I cannot enter seclusion. I have to handle my younger brother's funeral rites first.'

'Brother... back then... at the little courtyard on Mount Qingdu... all the brothers and sisters sitting together, we couldn't even fit at three big tables. When Uncle Xijun came with the Clan Head, I never even thought I could reach Foundation Establishment.'

'I thought back then that my role, Li Minggong, was to be an advisor... Now... I'm the only one left to face this.'
