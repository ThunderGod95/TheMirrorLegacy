# Chapter 400: Here Comes Buzi

Eastern Sea.

Among the four seas, the Eastern Sea was the most vast, with rolling waves and clear turquoise waters. Various demons often rode the wind and traversed the waves on the sea's surface.

The demons thrived the best in the Eastern Sea. Led by the dragon species, each established palaces deep within the sea, becoming a formidable force and lending vibrant life to the waters.

The islands were scattered like stars in the sky, and the closer they were to the Yue State's coastal prefecture, the larger and broader they became. The area was filled with rogue cultivators and sects with a significant number of devil cultivators, extraordinary beings, and shamans, making it a chaotic region.

Additionally, the Eastern Sea was home to numerous demons, where killings occurred daily. Sixty percent of the demonic materials on the mainland were harvested from the Eastern and Southern Seas. In contrast, vast regions of the mainland cultivated Spirit Paddies, which were then exported overseas, benefiting both parties for over a millennium.

The sects in the Eastern Sea also constantly thought about relocating to the mainland. In fact, many among the Yue State's three sects and seven gates had achieved the Purple Mansion Realm on the Eastern Sea before migrating inland.

Deep within the sea, after passing through layers of mysterious forbidden formations, there was an undersea cliff covered with corals, ruins, and scattered fragments of tiles.

Xiao Chuting sat cross-legged, dressed in gray, with a calm and composed expression. Facing a radiant stone wall, the wall was crystalline and clear, with lines of golden characters appearing one after another.

The perfection of Nine Arts lies in the Qingming. The three disasters and nine tribulations are bestowed by the heavens. The wind and fire of the Great Void are the essence of spirit energy...[1]

Xiao Chuting observed the words carefully, and after the text on the stone wall had finished appearing, a new line of large characters reappeared—Hunyi Golden Core Mysterious Method[2].

As the lines of small characters reappeared, Xiao Chuting watched on silently. He has been trapped here for years, staring at the stone wall every day without a hint of impatience.

"Daoist Chuting... Still unwilling to speak?"

Zhang Tianyuan, dressed in golden robes, stood with his hands behind his back and said softly, "This mysterious method is a legacy from before the ancient cataclysm... Reading it will make you forget it completely. Do not waste your effort!"

Seeing Xiao Chuting remain silent and continue staring at the stone wall, Zhang Tianyuan's brow furrowed with a trace of impatience. He said in a deep voice, "Under the Hunyi Immortal Wall, even the True Monarchs cannot investigate it. Only you and I know about this. What are you worried about?"

"By the way, which Purple Mansion Realm expert intervened during the Wrathful Maha incident?"

Xiao Chuting paused, finally looking at him and saying gently, "Daoist Tianyuan, I only met that senior once. I only know of his divine ability, nothing else."

"Ha!" Zhang Tianyuan sneered, speaking in a deep voice, "Could it be that person used a life divine ability to fight eight just to save Li Tongya's life? The Li Family is just a small Foundation Establishment Realm clan. How could they have such great influence?"

"Since he is your backer and is proficient in life divine abilities, he must have some plan of his own!" he spat.

He stared deeply at Xiao Chuting and continued softly, "Since you refuse to speak, we will continue to wait and see if that Daoist is willing to help you escape. Without your support, the Xiao Family will not last long."

"You overestimate me, fellow Daoist," Xiao Chuting said, completely unfazed by his words. He saw through Zhang Tianyuan's bluff and sat steadily, with even a hint of a smile on his face.

"We can wait, but Azure Pond cannot. If I am not mistaken, now that Chen Taojing is dead, the devil plague has moved toward the seven gates," he calmly spoke.

Speaking of Chen Taojing's death, a hint of regret flashed in Xiao Chuting's eyes as he continued, "If I am not inland, with only Chi Buzi and Yuansu, they cannot mobilize so many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. If the True Monarch's plans are ruined, not even Daoist Tianyuan can bear the responsibility."

Xiao Chuting's words darkened Zhang Tianyuan's face, and his golden robe trembled slightly as he said sternly, "You are quite calculative... No wonder you hid for five years, waiting for this moment...! Fine... Fine!"

Zhang Tianyuan gritted his teeth as he continued, "First targeting my Zhang Family, then using Azure Pond Sect... Fine! Take your perilous path and see how long you can hold out!"

He then swung his sleeve, his figure disappearing into the distance. This place was filled with forbidden formations left by the ancient Immortal Sect, preventing entry into the Great Void. Even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had to fly openly.

After Zhang Tianyuan left, Xiao Chuting also stood up, his hands behind his back. To protect that hidden pawn of the Li Family for the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, Xiao Chuting had expended considerable effort, using clues to point all suspicion toward himself. Now, he had thoroughly offended Zhang Tianyuan.

"I hope that senior... has his own plans arranged." Xiao Chuting muttered to himself.

"Chen Mufeng."

Li Yuanjiao picked up the small letter in his hand silently, reading its contents. He looked at the young man half-kneeling before him and praised, "Not yet thirty and already at the peak of Embryonic Breathing Realm... truly a genius!"

Chen Mufeng, with lowered gaze and head, responded loudly, "Clan Brother is the one with a profound affinity for the Dao and is naturally gifted in cultivation! Mufeng is but a firefly's light, incomparable to the brilliance of Clan Brother's moonlight."

Chen Mufeng's words were sincere. Li Yuanjiao, only six or seven years older, had already reached the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, making any comparison futile for Chen Mufeng.

Hearing him call him "Clan Brother," Li Yuanjiao was slightly taken aback. He then remembered that Chen Mufeng was the son-in-law of his clan uncle, Li Qiuyang, and the husband of his cousin, making him his brother-in-law by marriage.

"Have you decided on which cultivation technique to practice?" Li Yuanjiao asked.

Chen Mufeng bowed again and replied, "I will follow the clan's arrangements!"

"Very well," Li Yuanjiao nodded, "then it shall be the River One Qi Technique."

"Thank you, Clan Brother! Thank you! Mufeng will serve the clan with all his might..." Chen Mufeng exclaimed readily with ears pricked up, as he had been waiting for these words. He was overjoyed, bowing excitedly and reciting a string of vows.

Li Yuanjiao merely waved his hand and said softly, "Go to Yuanping to collect the cultivation technique, pills, and spiritual qi. There is no need to report back."

The Li Family's support for external cultivators was indeed generous, as even Li Yuanjiao himself practiced the River One Qi Technique. A technique one grade stronger would significantly enhance one's strength. Chen Mufeng hurriedly thanked him and left in a rush.

Watching the young man leave, Li Yuanjiao turned to Li Xuanxuan and asked softly, "How does he compare to Uncle Donghe?"

Li Xuanxuan, holding a talisman produced by the Azure Pond, carefully scrutinized the brushwork and said, "He lacks Donghe's steadiness, is less tempered, and inevitably reckless, unlike our clan members."

The Li Family's direct descendants were aware of the great treasures they possessed and understood the severe methods of the higher sects. They were always taught the grave consequences of a single moment of negligence, leading to the clan's annihilation. Hence, the younger members like Ximing and Xijun were all introspective and cautious, differing greatly from the ambitious Chen Mufeng.

With the strict clan laws, the atmosphere within the clan was always somber. Li Yuanjiao feared excessive strictness and laughed softly, saying, "As long as he is useful. The clan needs a few with drive."

1. Translator's Note: The Qingming here probably means Qingming Copper which is used to forge weapons. ☜

2. Translator's Note: Hun means "mix" and yi means "one", so Hunyi could also mean "mixed into one". ☜

As they were talking, Xiao Guiluan arrived, full of curiosity. She descended from the wind and bowed to Li Xuanxuan, saying respectfully, "Father."

Li Xuanxuan waved his hand, signaling her to speak. He then urgently asked, "What did Xiao Guitu say?"

Xiao Guiluan hesitated for a moment and then repeated her brother's words. Li Yuanjiao and Li Xuanxuan were both stunned, looking at her in disbelief.

"Our family's Purple Mansion Realm cultivator?!"

Li Yuanjiao was dazed for a few moments, frowning as he looked up and said in a deep voice, "Where would our family get a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator? If the Li Family had one, we would not be in our current state!"

Li Xuanxuan put away the talisman in his hand, still puzzled. Xiao Guiluan herself was also confused. Seeing Li Yuanjiao's genuine expression, she hesitated and said slowly, "Perhaps it is a good thing! But... I always feel uneasy for some reason."

Li Yuanjiao turned the cup in his hand silently and said softly, "No wonder Xiao Guitu was so courteous..."

"What should we do now?" Xiao Guiluan asked.

Li Yuanjiao, surprisingly calm, had a fleeting image of the immortal mirror in his mind before replying nonchalantly.

"Act as if nothing happened. Proceed as usual."

He had a guess: the family's immortal mirror was of extremely high rank yet excelled at concealment... Perhaps Xiao Chuting miscalculated due to this misunderstanding.

He could not send someone to the Xiao Family to clarify either. Whether Xiao Guitu believed it or not, if word spread to others, it could spell trouble.

"If Xiao Chuting can return safely and promptly... Everything will be fine. If he cannot return..."

Li Yuanjiao said this, but in his heart, he felt that Xiao Chuting was definitely not someone who would take risks rashly and get trapped. With the mysterious nature of the Man On Creek, it was more likely that he would be the one setting traps for others.

He shook his head and continued, "Xiao Chuting would never risk himself unnecessarily... It is likely a calculated exchange. Do not worry about the Xiao Family; let us prepare to deal with the devil cultivators first."

Seeing Li Yuanjiao casually brush off the matter, Xiao Guiluan had no choice but to nod. Suddenly, a moment of clarity struck her mind, and she felt inexplicably uneasy. She gasped, "Oh no!"

Both men looked over to see Xiao Guiluan's face turn pale as she murmured, "No wonder I felt so uneasy! Brother... has been hit by a divine ability... It is Buzi! No wonder... I understand now...I understand! Buzi intentionally met with him. No wonder he demanded the Purple Mansion Realm expert to come personally... he forced my brother to meet him!"

Xiao Guiluan continued, "Brother is only at the Qi Cultivation Realm, while Buzi is already at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. He must have used his divine ability to confuse and shake his mind, forcing him to seek help. He probably wanted to see what the Xiao Family's backup plan was!"

Xiao Guiluan had only brief contact with him but was already influenced to the point of distraction, showing how deep Xiao Guitu's enchantments were. If it were someone less resolute, they would have broken down and revealed all secrets by now.

"What?!"

Li Yuanjiao was momentarily stunned but quickly reacted, horrified, "What level is the Xiao Family's formation?! Does the Xiao Family have the means to isolate from the outside? If Buzi overheard your conversation with your brother, his next step would be to come to our house!"

Buzi was no ordinary Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. If he learned that the Li Family had a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, he would definitely visit personally. Their family did not have one, and they had a hidden treasure on the mountain. If it was seen by a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, it would spell the end of the family.

If Buzi saw this treasure that absorbs the Supreme Yin Moonlight, he wouldn't care about the Azure Pond Sect or Mount Dali; he would slaughter our family and flee with the treasure!

Li Yuanjiao thought of the worst-case scenario.

"Impossible!"

Xiao Guiluan, freed from Buzi's divine influence and much clearer-headed, said decisively, "Our Xiao Family's main hall was personally refined by our ancestor! It has a barrier with the Great Void. Even Buzi would have to lower himself, land on the mountaintop, and then enter the hall. It is impossible for him to overhear our conversation. Once isolated from the Great Void, even if someone died inside, their soul lamp in the sect would not extinguish immediately, let alone leave any means to eavesdrop!"

Li Yuanjiao glanced at her, still feeling a chill run down his spine as he murmured, "Let's hope that's the case..."

————

The water on Moongaze Lake rippled as a green-robed cultivator descended with the wind, landing on a small island in the lake.

"Moongaze Marsh."

He gazed silently at the blue water, calculating that it had been over a hundred years since he last came to this place.

In the records of the Azure Pond Sect, the spiritual energy here was once the greatest in the Yue State, a treasure land of the immortal mansion with white mist curled around the vast marsh. Five hundred years ago, it plummeted, and later, the siege of Li Jiangqun severely damaged the spiritual energy, almost depleting it entirely.

Daoist Master Buzi looked around. His grandfather and uncles all died in that great battle. Now, hundreds of years old, he still felt that the green water had a tinge of red to it.

"Jiangqun is dead, the bright moon rises in the east, its light like frost. Snow falls in the prefecture, the lake sparkles with a myriad of lights, red and green intertwine..."

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who died in that battle were countless. Some returned home with an indelible sword intent, slowly awaiting death. But the spectacle over the lake was more magnificent than the previous hundred years combined.

Li Jiangqun never had the chance to transform into a spirit object. His flesh was divided among the three sects, treated as precious treasures. What followed was the reckoning with Lingyu Gate and the extermination of a few immortal clans.

He snapped out of his recollections, shook his head, and withdrew his gaze, extending his spiritual sense to search the bottom of the lake repeatedly.

"I'll search three times. If there is nothing, I'll leave."

The lakebed of Moongaze Lake churned, treacherous and filled with numerous demons, some of which were Foundation Establishment Realm creatures. Usually domineering, they now trembled in the mud, cowering in fear before the Purple Mansion Daoist Master.

Buzi ignored them, carefully searching three times. Finding nothing, he could not resist searching two more times. Finally, he shook his head and sighed. "Still nothing... I supposed it's not so easily found."

In fact, the sects had long given up on finding the Supreme Yin Moonlight in Moongaze Lake. It was more likely to be found in the ruins of the Eastern Sea. However, Buzi could not resist coming after hearing Li Xizhi's account.

"The Purple Mansion Realm expert aiding the Xiao Family did not show up... It might be Xiao Xianyou's favor. It is best to release Xiao Chuting first, to avoid further complications."

Buzi glanced at Mount Dali, swung his sleeve, and vanished into the Great Void.

Watching Buzi vanish into the Great Void, Lu Jiangxian finally let out a long sigh of relief, "Thank goodness... he was not coming for me."

When Daoist Master Buzi passed by the Ding Family and stepped into Moongaze Lake, Lu Jiangxian was immediately alerted. Seeing this man with such a formidable aura, he briefly feared that he had been exposed.

As he secretly calculated whether he could escape from Buzi, a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had mastered three divine abilities, he realized that Buzi was just passing by to search for the Supreme Yin Moonlight.

In the future, the Li Family must not expose the Supreme Yin Moonlight again... If another one appears, this lake will constantly be visited by Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. The three sects might even start fighting over the ownership of Moongaze Lake...

As he pondered this silently, he noticed a ripple in the Great Void once more. Buzi, dressed in green, returned. He was stepping lightly over the water, which startled Lu Jiangxian.

This guy! What is he up to now? Lu Jiangxian cursed.

Buzi had a slight smile on his face as he calmly landed on the lake, looking toward the glittering grand formation on Mount Dali.

Isn't there still the Li Family? That Li Xizhi is just a young brat and might not know the family secrets. If the cave dwelling contains such a precious item as the Supreme Yin Moonlight, there might be other treasures as well!
