# Chapter 958: Laughter and Tears

Shanji Prefecture.

Kong Tingyun stood desolate atop a mountain peak, her expression lost. Quiet lamps dotted the scene below.

Her knuckles had turned white from gripping the pavilion railing. Below, the mountain was still overcome with joy, and cries of congratulation echoed from all sides.

"Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Kong!"

Qi Lanyan descended from the sky, offering his own congratulations before speaking with a trace of regret:

"It's just a pity that demonic cultivator was prepared. Although the great array couldn't be moved on short notice, he dismantled the Purple Mansion-level spiritual items within it, leaving behind an empty shell... And to think I even brought my Array-Foundation Sundering Blades. A true case of using an ox-cleaver to kill a chicken."

Kong Tingyun forced a smile, her eyes still filled with lingering fear and shock. For a moment, she didn't know how to reply.

But Qi Lanyan just beamed.

"See? I was right. The Supreme Yang Dao didn't just want your sect; they crossed the river to take your life. If I hadn't sensed it in time, who knows what sort of killing calamity would have befallen Jiangbei."

Kong Tingyun's heart was a knot of complicated emotions. The helpless, despairing eyes of the purple-robed woman still flashed in her mind. "I truly must thank you, my lord," she replied.

"Without you, the Supreme Yang Dao would have dismissed me with a few empty words and some token compensation."

Qi Lanyan simply smiled, saying nothing.

After a long moment, he let out a leisurely sigh. "A pity. Lingmei was too bold..."

"After this, Tinglan won't dare show her face for at least thirty years. The Purple Smoke Blessed Land will seal itself away. And Houfu... that one was cunning enough to break through to a new divine ability, but it was useless. He lost his Dharma body. Even though he used some trick to escape with a spark of his Shengyang Mansion, it's as good as being dead. The Great Xiukui Monastery will inevitably lock down its array. You no longer have anyone holding you back."

"As for Sword Gate... they are set in their ways. The Cheng family is selfish. Acting on a tip from Beihuan, they cut ties early under the pretext of seclusion. You, on the other hand, hold the righteous cause. The fact that Lingmei stepped in to save you this once was already his limit. It means nothing, so don't overthink it."

Hearing this, Kong Tingyun felt nothing but dread, but she kept a polite smile on her face. She murmured,

"Sword Gate did, after all, lend me Wind-Hearing White Stone Mountain. This junior is indebted to them..."

"True enough..."

Qi Lanyan propped both elbows on the railing, leaning casually. He smiled.

"Also, those mountains that Yehui took from here... I've already arranged for people to move them back. Your sect will need to handle the work of reconnecting the earth veins. Oh..."

He pointed idly at the sky, shaking his head with a chuckle. "Speak of the devil. Your people can return to the mountain now."

Kong Tingyun raised her head. The night was dark, but a golden carriage was speeding across the sky, shining like a brilliant star and bathing the surroundings in radiance.

Exhausted, she said, "Thank you, my lord."

...

Far across the night sky, golden curtains swayed. An old man sat stiffly inside the carriage, still as a statue, his legs stretched out rigidly.

All noise was blocked by the curtains. The carriage, a gift from the Daoist Master of Chengyun Gate, was truly forged from Heavenly Star Crimson Gold. Kong Guxi felt like his entire body was burning.

His mind was hazy and blank. He had thought the journey would be long, giving him time to think of what to say. But before he could even register the prestige of riding in a Daoist Master's carriage, he felt a slight vibration beneath his feet, and someone called out:

"We respectfully welcome the Sect Master back to the mountain!"

Kong Guxi opened the curtain.

The sky was heavy. A faint white light, like a thin veil, covered the mountain, illuminating it in bright colors. Five golden swords hung in the sky, casting down five long, golden blades that stood like massive pillars among the peaks.

'Those are Lord Qi's Array-Foundation Sundering Blades.'

The treasure's brilliant golden light shone softly through the treetops. The mountainside was packed with kneeling people, lining the main path in prostration. A dense black mass of heads, all wearing Profound Peak attire.

Someone came to help him down. Kong Guxi looked up. It was Kong Xiaxiang.

In a single day, his entire demeanor had changed. His eyes brimmed with the savage pleasure of vengeance fulfilled. His previously stooped back was now straight, and his entire frame seemed to have grown, making him appear tall and imposing.

"My lord!"

Kong Guxi nodded and stepped onto the ground. Gongs and drums thundered, and the faint sound of loud firecrackers drifted up from the mountain's base. The golden light in the sky was so brilliant it filled the mountain with radiance, leaving no shadow untouched. Every face was perfectly clear, glistening with sycophantic praise.

Ahead of him was an ornate golden palanquin. Thick chains snaked from it, connected to a group of wretched men and women. They were bound tightly in shackles, all kneeling on the path, none daring to look up.

Kong Xiaxiang's lips trembled violently. His mouth twisted into a distorted grin, revealing teeth clenched so hard they shook. A chilling laugh rumbled from his throat.

He snarled through his grin:

"These are the animals we captured... the ones who harmed our family, who trampled on us, who changed with the wind and kicked us when we were down... the beasts from the Sacred Writ Demonic Sect who oppressed us... Please, Sect Master, take your seat. Let them carry you up!"

"And this one, their leader..."

Kong Xiaxiang seized a chain and dragged a person from the crowd like a dead dog, leaving a smear of blood on the ground. The man's facial features had been carved off, his cultivation crippled. He could only groan on the ground.

Kong Xiaxiang's eyes were wide and round as he laughed.

"This is our dear Minister Wu... He did so many good deeds after joining the demonic sect!"

This Minister Wu had been a sycophant back when the Li family was in charge, though it was more tolerable then. When the Lis cast him out, he immediately pledged loyalty to the Sacred Writ Gate and began persecuting the Kong family. Now, bloody tears streamed down his ruined face, but his tongue had been cut out, and he could only whimper.

Kong Guxi's face was blank. He took a golden box from his sleeve, opened it, and gently unfolded the item inside. It was a Daoist robe.

The robe was ordinary. It fluttered lightly in the wind, rising and falling just as it had decades ago when it hung from a treetop. Kong Guxi draped the garment over the golden palanquin, then stood beside it, bowing as a junior.

At Kong Xiaxiang's command, the "human animals" at the front began to pull. Their cultivation was destroyed. Those who loved to sneer had their eyes gouged out. Those who loved to look smug had their prominent features sliced away. They bled endlessly, leaving long, dark stains on the path.

The mountain was deathly silent. No one dared to raise their head. The only sounds were the dull dragging, the pained whimpers, and the wet dripping of blood.

Kong Guxi walked beside the palanquin all the way to the summit. The soles of his shoes and the hem of his robes were soaked in blood. The radiance of this day was as bright as the sky had been dim all those years ago when he had fled down this same mountain, desolate and weeping. The light stung his eyes, and tears streamed down his face.

But his expression only grew calmer. He turned, looking down from his high vantage point at the countless fearful members of the Shanji clans who had come to pay respects, at the Sacred Writ disciples who had done no great wrong and were allowed to surrender, and at the terrified disciples of Xuanmiao Temple who dared not look up.

His lips trembled. His voice was hoarse. "All of you. Laugh."

In an instant, the pin-drop-silent mountain exploded with sound. The people began to laugh, terrified and confused. It sounded more like a chorus of hoarse crows cawing, echoing through the forest. The sound stirred the robe on the palanquin, causing it to lift up and float gently back into Kong Guxi's hands.

This unseen omen seemed to bestow upon him a sacred mission. Kong Guxi felt himself grow taller. He held the robe quietly, his bearing solemn and grave.

"Hahaha..."

"Hahahaha!"

The mountainside was a sea of smiling faces. Kong Guxi's head turned slowly, his gaze sharp as a blade, meticulously scanning every single person. He continued until his eyes reached an inconspicuous corner, where his gaze seemed to recoil as if burned. His pupils dilated.

Among the thousands of laughing faces, one remained sallow and calm, like a dry, withered weed. It refused to smile.

It was Kong Qiuyan.

She was holding the hand of a blindfolded child, and she seemed to be trembling.

Amidst the deafening, earth-shaking laughter, Kong Guxi's blade-like gaze shattered. The old man slowly lowered his head. His hand, clutching his ancestor's robe, tightened. He began to choke back sobs, then wept, and finally, he collapsed into the pool of blood, wailing in anguish.

...

Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

Layers of golden light flashed. A single bright point hung in the air. Inside a simple, ancient pavilion, Heavenly Light began to glow. A middle-aged man in Daoist robes exhaled slowly, causing the empty room to glow white.

Li Ximing opened his eyes. His spiritual sense swept inward. Light flashed within his Sea of Qi, where a vortex of Bright Yang Qi spun around a perfectly round, pill-like Immortal Foundation.

The Immortal Foundation, 'World's Radiance', was complete.

A tiny, twinkling white speck hovered above the Immortal Foundation, resonating with the spiritual mechanism and pouring down a mist-like white qi.

He calmed his mind and began to ponder.

'If I let the Talisman Qi nourish it naturally, it will take about six years for the Immortal Foundation to reach perfection... That's not too slow.'

Li Ximing's cultivation speed was already fast, and Valley Wind Guide-Fire also had the effect of circulating qi, which was a great help.

'If I take pills and enter seclusion, I can probably shave off another two or three years...'

Li Ximing calculated carefully. With the help of spiritual pills, this nurturing process had taken just over a year.

'The difficulty of congealing 'World's Radiance' is significant. If I had tried to form this during my Foundation Establishment Realm, it would have been a massive headache. But for a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, it just meant an extra month or two. Everything went smoothly.'

With a thought, he appeared inside the lightning-wreathed pagoda. He stood and walked out. The lamps in the palace were dim. Li Ximing swept his gaze over the area, and his heart skipped a beat. "Hm?"

He stepped through the air and materialized in the small courtyard of the inner array. He saw a small stone hanging from a beam. A boy in white robes stood in the yard, striking the stone with a wooden sword, producing dull _thud_ sounds.

Li Ximing hadn't intentionally hidden his presence. The moment he appeared, the boy looked up, sheathed his sword with practiced skill, and exclaimed in surprise and delight:

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing looked him up and down. Those eyes were familiar. He smiled.

"Jiangchun?"

"It is this junior!"

Li Ximing helped the boy up, understanding immediately what this meant. He beamed. "You look exactly like your great-grandfather! How old are you? What cultivation art are you practicing?"

Li Jiangchun quickly invited him into the courtyard, his eyes shining. He served tea and said respectfully, "This junior's spiritual apertures opened late. I am eight years old now and will be nine after the fifth month. I am cultivating the Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity and just broke through to the third level of Embyronic Breathing!"

"The Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity!"

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. He laughed heartily and gestured for the boy to sit, clearly delighted.

"Good! Excellent... I have also read the Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity. Although it's an ancient art without a grade, the author who wrote it was meticulous, and their Dao-Profundity was astonishing. It's in no way inferior to your brother's Scripture of Heavenly Radiance and the Waning Sun. You must not waste this opportunity."

"Furthermore, the content of the Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity is exceptionally detailed. It explains all sorts of cultivation arts and spell arts from low to high, and details the key points of every stage of cultivation. It's as if a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator annotated it personally. That's why it's called a 'Scroll'—it's no ordinary thing!"

Li Jiangchun nodded with a smile. Li Ximing made a quick calculation with his fingers, a flicker of surprise in his eyes. He nodded.

"Opened late... so at age seven. Just over a year... to have this kind of cultivation speed... Truly remarkable!"

"He had some help."

The courtyard gate creaked open. Li Zhouwei strode in, smiling as he approached. He spoke using his spiritual sense:

'I studied the Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity myself and had an elder compare it. All Yin-aspect Fruition Attainment stems from Supreme Yin. Lesser Yin cultivation arts are naturally subordinate to the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra and are extremely compatible. Jiangchun is cultivating the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra.'

"Oh?"

Li Ximing nodded inwardly. "With the help of Supreme Yin Moon Radiance, it's no wonder his cultivation advances a thousand miles a day..."

"Grand-uncle is correct."

Li Zhouwei smiled, then his expression turned serious. "That's precisely why I'm having him stay inside the inner array. He can go out after he reaches the Qi Refining realm... Although he has the Talisman Seed and isn't afraid of being scouted, our family is in the eye of the storm right now. Cultivating too quickly will always attract prying eyes."

Li Ximing laughed. He silently pulled the boy over and saw the calluses on his palms, knowing he worked hard. He smiled without a word, his satisfaction plain to see, only saying, "I once obtained a treasure called Profound Lake Primal Essence. It's said to be immensely beneficial for Lesser Yin. I'll prepare it for you!"

Li Zhouwei chuckled. Li Ximing eagerly turned his head and asked in a low voice, "The Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity requires Lesser Void Yin Qi. How are Minghuang's preparations coming along?"

Li Zhouwei nodded. "It's already being prepared. This qi must be gathered on the night of the new moon, when the turbid qi sinks. You must take spiritual items of the Mansion Water and Supreme Yin lines, place them in a jade vessel, let them rest in the Great Void for one night, and then collect it."

"With a Purple Mansion Realm expert in the family, gathering this qi is much simpler. We just spend one day a month cultivating in the Great Void and bring the items back for them to extract the qi... At this rate, we should have enough within a year or two."

Li Jiangchun listened silently, then bowed deeply in thanks several times.
Li Ximing smiled. "Practicing the sword is a good thing... I was clumsy as a child. At your age, I couldn't sheathe my sword so smoothly. It shows your dedication."

Li Ximing could tell that significant events had likely occurred in the outside world and that Li Zhouwei seemed to have something on his mind. He ended the conversation with praise for the boy and walked out with Li Zhouwei, pacing with him inside the purple-glowing inner array. "What's happened?" he asked in a low voice.

"Suiguan made a move... It was world-shaking. A million corpses, fields piled high with white bones. Grand-uncle has been in seclusion congealing his Immortal Foundation, so I didn't dare disturb you."

Li Zhouwei grimly recounted the events in Jiangbei. Li Ximing listened, falling into a heavy silence.

"The Jiangnan of today has not yet recovered from that catastrophe. Although it looks the same on the surface, the undercurrents are raging. It's a completely different world."

"Ever since the Jiangbei incident concluded, the Purple Smoke Blessed Land and the Great Xiukui Monastery have both sealed themselves off, announcing their seclusion. Our family sent people, but they couldn't get an audience... Although neither side has released any news about their Daoist Master, judging by the situation... the outlook for those two Daoist Masters is far from optimistic. It's impossible to know if they are alive or dead."

Li Ximing was horrified. He had already felt uneasy after hearing about Suiguan, but this news still shook him to the core. "It actually reached that point!"
