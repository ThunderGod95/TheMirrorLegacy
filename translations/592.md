# Chapter 924: Blazing Merging Fire

Guo Hongjian had chased the Dawn Rayfish a long way but was still ultimately shaken off. By the time he returned on Merging Fire, even his escape light had dimmed and his mana was too depleted to keep going.

"What a pity. It's rare to encounter a Foundation Establishment Realm Dawn Rayfish. Creatures of the Heavenly Glow lineage are far too adept at fleeing and can even knock away dharma artifacts. Truly difficult to catch," muttered Guo Hongjian.

The emergence of the Dawn Rayfish was due to the great flood during the Northern Sea’s sky fracture. A Dawn Rayfish had taken the opportunity to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. The conditions for such spirit beasts to evolve were extremely stringent, making it a rare treasure. Guo Hongjian missing it only deepened his regret.

Though his cultivation technique was high grade, his Immortal Foundation, Heart-Flame Aspiration, was not known for vast reserves. But after swallowing two pills, his mana recovered significantly. The Cloudlight Profound Ring underfoot quivered slightly, accelerating his speed. Looking southward, he saw someone riding the wind in the distance.

They were obscured within a dharma artifact. Above him stood eight painting screens arranged in a cylinder, radiating a mysterious golden hue that enveloped him. It seemed like a tiny dot of dull gold on the horizon.

He clearly saw the grey-red Merging Fire flickering across the painting screens, refusing to extinguish no matter how much mana was poured into suppressing it. Guo Hongjian couldn’t help but laugh heartily in his heart, Merging Fire damages artifacts and harms the body. It can't be fully cleansed without several days of nurturing!

Since Merging Fire was not exclusive to the Crimson Reef Island, Guo Hongjian didn’t think too much of it. After flying a bit farther, he spotted a patch of grey clouds above Xifeng Island and several cultivators flitting through them like tiny black dots.

"Hmm?!"

Blazing Merging Fire streamed across the sky. Guo Hongjian came to a sudden halt, his pupils slowly widening.

If he still couldn’t understand at this point, he would be a true fool. His face twisted with murderous intent as he instantly turned around. The cloud ring beneath his feet burst into action as he drew out a grey-red fire token.

He charged back, teeth clenched, "Scoundrel, don’t you dare flee!"

"This man must have harmed Hongkang!"

He naturally didn’t believe his sister Guo Hongyao had died at the hands of this man. Considering the time he spent chasing the Dawn Rayfish, their departure from the island couldn’t have been more than two to four hours apart. At most, the anomaly in the sky meant one death, and that could only be Guo Hongkang.

Even so, Guo Hongjian’s fury was undiminished. Although Guo Hongkang wasn’t a blood relative, he was shrewd and resourceful. Guo Hongjian had always kept him close and often relied on his advice. It was utterly worthless for him to die here.

Rage surged through his chest. Flames rose beneath his feet as he stepped onto the cloud ring and sped forth. The man had already become a barely visible speck on the horizon, but Guo Hongjian had memorized his figure in that brief glance and calculated that his speed was now far inferior.

"Prepare to die!"

Guo Hongjian cultivated the Heart-Flame Aspiration, a technique with a slow escape spell. Thankfully, he had the aid of a dharma artifact. Though still slower than a Dawn Rayfish, he surpassed most others in speed. His vital qi surged, leaving a red-white trail in the air as he rapidly closed in on the golden gleam without a word.

As expected... I knew they wouldn’t let me off so easily, Li Xijun had already noticed his pursuer.

He could have used the Immortal Mirror to perceive the world and easily avoid the man. Guo Hongjian wouldn’t even have gotten close to his shadow. But Li Xijun was meticulous in his thinking. With the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators possibly involved, how could he dare arbitrarily change directions?

Rather than exposing anomalies that would draw the suspicion and silent attention of more Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, thus endangering his family, Li Xijun would rather take on more risk himself. At worst, his plan would fail. But the exposure of the Immortal Mirror could mean annihilation.

When he saw Guo Hongjian drawing near, Li Xijun’s spiritual sense immediately swept over the cloud ring under the man’s feet. It glowed brightly, releasing waves of white dharma light to support the middle-aged cultivator, causing Li Xijun to feel uneasy.

He observed closely for a moment, then his heart stirred. He formed a hand seal and activated the dharma artifact with his spiritual sense. A wave of dim cyan light flickered from the screen as he activated Heavy Abyssal Gale once again.

Buzz...

The sweeping cyan light swiftly locked onto the cloud ring under Guo Hongjian’s feet. It flickered, then the cloud aura dispersed as the dharma light shattered. It instantly reverted to its original form, no bigger than a ring, and was captured by the Chongming Profound Insight Screen.

"What!" Guo Hongjian was stunned and furious as he nearly fell out of the clouds. The fight hadn’t even begun, and he almost coughed up blood. His heart trembled, What kind of dharma artifact is that?! Ridiculous!

Guo Hongjian had just chased a Dawn Rayfish that specialized in knocking away dharma artifacts. He was well aware of many spells and tools that could achieve this. But there was a difference between knocking down an artifact and outright capturing someone's flight tool. This was unheard of!

And to do it so swiftly and cleanly! Since his artifact had been forcibly taken from him, his speed was greatly reduced. Guo Hongjian was no match for the person ahead. He was deeply shaken.

Meanwhile, Li Xijun understood immediately, Heavy Abyssal Gale mimics the gale of the Great Western Plains. Even Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators can’t fly in that wind. It doesn’t just knock down dharma artifacts; it disrupts the dharma light that sustains them. Naturally, that includes the cloud ring’s dharma light. None of this artifact’s three effects are simple!

Guo Hongjian watched the distance widening again and felt a surge of greed, yet for a moment, he hesitated, Flying sword? Dharma light? But the distance is too short for spellcasting, and everything else might be knocked down by that ironclad artifact. Who on earth is this person?!

He ran through all the possibilities, realizing that as long as the one using that artifact was fast enough, it would be nearly impossible to counter. But as he hesitated for two seconds, the distance had widened significantly again.

His expression darkened. Pressing two fingers together, he drew out a wide sandalwood-red talisman, upon which was painted a vividly lifelike, scale-covered giant rat.

Guo Hongjian chanted, "Scorching wind, heed my command, shuttle and race as one with fire!"

Li Xijun listened quietly. He sensed the talisman between Guo Hongjian’s fingers release a puff of sandalwood-red wind through his spiritual sense. It transformed midair into a long-scaled crimson rat, howled once, then turned into a gust of red wind, lifting him from below and propelling him north at great speed.

This talisman was not ordinary. Called the Blazing Merging Fire Talisman, it was drawn by the sandalwood cloud rat, the spirit pet of Crimson Reef’s founding ancestor Guo Shentong. The Merging Fire spirit beast specialized in summoning a scorching wind. The talisman was originally crafted for a direct descendant’s escape, but driven by greed and fury, Guo Hongjian didn’t hesitate to use it for battle.

The sandalwood-red fire wind gathered in an instant, and he rapidly closed the gap. Lifting his long command token to his lips, he exhaled, his eyes turning grey-red as he spat out a gout of Merging Fire.

This flame was worlds apart from what Guo Hongkang had wielded. It was thicker, grander, and more scorching. It let out a strange cawing sound as the deep grey flame slammed against the screen with a thunderous boom.

Li Xijun was already injured and low on mana, so the blast nearly knocked him from the sky. Merging Fire blazed across the painting screens, devouring his mana like a whale swallowing water. Without mana support, the light of the Chongming Profound Insight Screen dimmed all at once.

Clang!

As Guo Hongjian controlled the flames, the screen's light suddenly split apart, bursting forth with a dazzling sword light and falling like frost and snow. He watched coldly as a strand of red gauze flew from his sleeve, fluttering and twisting as it entangled the sword light.

The red gauze let out a muffled boom, as though it had restrained a flood dragon. Whatever was within was struggling violently.

Guo Hongjian was surprised, and poured his mana into it as he asked, "Sword essence? Even sword essence is useless!"

He wasn’t like Guo Hongyao; he immediately saw that the person inside the dharma artifact was nearly out of mana. He didn’t even need to act further; just maintaining the fire for seven minutes would cause the man to fall into the sea.

"Lost in the east, gained in the west."

But Guo Hongjian had already grown greedy for this dharma artifact, so a swift and decisive victory was best. Forming a seal with his fingers, he cast his spell and Merging Fire surged. Taking advantage of the moment the man was entangled by the screen’s fire and couldn’t spare attention, Guo Hongjian rapidly gathered flames in his hand.

Though Li Xijun was in dire straits, he remained calm. His pale gray eyes betrayed no emotion. The Chongming Profound Insight Screen's glow had dimmed, and Han Lin had been sheathed and returned to his embrace.

He reached into his sleeve and took out a talisman. The sandalwood-red talisman was the size of a palm and bore the image of a lifelike, scale-covered rat with golden, gleaming eyes that were already brimming with mana.

The Blazing Merging Fire Talisman!

Li Xijun poured his remaining mana into it, mimicking the incantation word-for-word. His voice rang out clearly within the screen, "Scorching wind, heed my command. Shuttle back and forth, merge and charge with fire!"

The talisman released a puff of sandalwood-red wind that transformed mid-air into a long-scaled crimson rat. It let out a shrill cry, then reverted into sandalwood wind, lifting him from beneath and propelling him north at great speed.

Guo Hongjian, hearing that incantation, abruptly stopped his spell. He stared blankly at the vanishing gray-red glow in the distance, his mind completely blank.

"He... how can he have our family’s Blazing Merging Fire Talisman?"

The gray fire in his hands was still flowing as he stood stunned, turned his head to look back at the path he'd come, and muttered in confusion, "How does he know our family’s incantation?!"

Guo Hongjian turned his head back, but there was no trace of anyone left on the horizon. His expression was like a spilled jar of mixed as emotions twisted and transformed.

He exclaimed in shock, "That’s right! I chanted it just now!"

He pondered for a breath, then quickly understood. He took a deep breath, eyes glistening, and squeezed out a few words through clenched teeth, "My little sister... you murderer..."

But a troubling doubt slowly surfaced in Guo Hongjian’s mind amid his grief. It lingered endlessly and refused to disperse, "But even if he killed my little sister... our Crimson Reef Island's direct descendant's storage pouches aren’t so easily opened. Even with an Immortal Foundation specializing in such arts, it would take ten days to half a month! The curses and marking techniques within are also extremely advanced, why was he completely unaffected?

"It can’t be that my little sister took them out and gave them to him herself!"

————

Great void.

A ripple stirred in the pitch-black great void as a woman in a simple Daoist robe appeared, holding a parasol in her arms. Her black hair was pinned back by a hairpin, and her eyes gazed through the void, fixed on the manifest world.

"This..." She hesitated for a moment, then shook her head. "So that’s how it happened... Guo Hongyao... truly pathetic to the extreme."

A Daoist Master remained unseen beside her, but a deep, resonant voice echoed by her ear, "A sharp-minded youngster... and skilled in swordsmanship too."

The two of them could see clearly that the talisman that turned the tide had come from Guo Hongyao. The Guo Family’s storage pouches were notoriously difficult to open, but Guo Hongyao had held the talisman in her palm!

When facing mortal peril, Guo Hongyao’s first reaction had been to pull out this life-saving talisman exclusive to the direct descendants. She had only infused it with half her mana when Li Xijun struck with a sword technique and killed her. Thus, the talisman naturally fell into Li Xijun’s hands.

"And just then, Guo Hongjian happened to be casting spells nearby, so he heard the full incantation clearly..." Daoist Master Hengxing murmured. She extended a slender finger, calculated silently for a moment, and replied gently, "That dharma artifact, after all, was crafted with the ancient method and depicted six True Monarchs. Even if they all attained the Dao and their visages were wiped from the screen, it remains a variable. A slight miscalculation is to be expected."

Though calculations might not be off by a hair and miss by a mile, this small variable happened to collide with a crucial turning point in the conflict, and so slipped beyond her control. She still found it hard to believe and asked, "Isn’t it all just... too coincidental?"

Another Daoist Master revealed himself in the great void. He was an unremarkable gray-robed elder carrying a sword on his back. He kept his hands behind his back as he said thoughtfully, "Do you suspect... that he bears fate?"

The man gently shook his head as he continued, "I cannot divine, nor do I understand fate and destiny. But I vaguely recall one thing. Back then, he was the one who killed Xu Xiao, the one fated to inherit Merging Fire. Could that have had an effect?"

Daoist Master Hengxing pondered for a moment, then shook her head, "The Xu Xiao matter has no logic to it. If killing a fate bearer could grant their destiny, then would Changxiao, Guo Shentong, or Junjian still be alive?

"As for Li Xijun, everything he has done thus far aligned with the calculations. If he bore fate, he would’ve long deviated from the plan. The oversight of the painted screen was mine. Now that I’ve seen its mystery, I won’t err again next time."

The man nodded and asked, "What about Tu Longjian..."

"No harm." Daoist Master Hengxing nodded softly and answered, "Li Xijun’s heart is now shaken by Merging Fire. Just because Guo Hongjian failed to catch him red-handed doesn’t mean this matter is over. It merely means Fellow Daoist Tu Longjian must take the initiative. The necessary games must still be played."

The sword-bearing elder gently shook his head and sighed. "Junjian has an ancient spirit, but it is out of place in these times... As one who wields the sword, I often feel shame in my heart, which is why my sword intent remains unformed. If he had pursued the sword, perhaps he would already be a sword immortal by now."

Daoist Master Hengxing’s voice was gentle as she shook her head, "He has the spirit of chivalry, and such a spirit must be free. He roamed the Eastern Sea unchecked when he was in the Foundation Establishment Realm. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator’s divine abilities could not subdue him. Even the cultivators of the Three Sects could not stop him, so who could? That is the true wind of heroism and righteousness.

"But once he reached the Purple Mansion Realm, he could no longer act freely. A single word may save hundreds, yet on the other end, doom thousands. Who can truly act freely in this muddled world? Even Donghua could not..."

Daoist Master Hengxing pressed her lips together slightly and replied, "When I attained the Purple Mansion Realm, a senior once told me, 'for one who commands divine powers, the eyes are the weakest part of the entire body,' and this is the reason why."

"Oh?" The old man furrowed his brow slightly. He had never heard this saying. Most cultivators who attained the Purple Mansion Realm could even discard their entire body without hesitation, let alone their eyes, so he asked doubtfully, "Daoist friend, please enlighten me."

Daoist Master Hengxing spoke softly, "All people possess compassion. When they witness suffering, they feel pain. Thus, for one who wields divine powers, the eyes beneath their brows become weaker than any other part of their body."

The sword-bearing Daoist silently looked down and replied, "And so, we have the world as it is today."

The two gradually faded into the great void. The old man let out a sigh, his voice low as he said, "Let us see how he chooses to face it."
