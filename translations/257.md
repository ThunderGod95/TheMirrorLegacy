# Chapter 281: Guiluan

Liu Changdie was feeling quite pleased with himself as the grand formation was nearly complete. He could already sense the subtle connections of spiritual energy forming within the formation and thought to himself, This formation is almost ready. With the help of the Li Family, once I master the Spirit Eye Perception, I can head north. The Xu State is in chaos right now, and going there might provide me with some opportunities.

As he was contemplating, he saw someone land nearby with a golden bow on their back and a jade slip in his hand. The man said with a smile, "Brother Changdie, I have brought you the Spirit Eye Perception!"

Liu Changdie was overjoyed and expressed his thanks repeatedly. He stepped forward, but noticed that Li Xuanfeng looked somewhat regretful as he continued explaining, "Unfortunately, the ancestor is in seclusion, and I could not find him. We have never had a guest elder in the family before, so I cannot make that decision without consulting him first."

"I see..."

Liu Changdie understood that Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators often secluded themselves for years, but he could not understand why Li Xuanfeng still brought the Spirit Eye Perception to him.

Feeling both disappointed and puzzled, he looked at the jade slip and asked, "And this is..."

"Oh," Li Xuanfeng seemed to realize something and raised his head, saying, "No one knows when the ancestor will emerge from his seclusion. I can't keep you waiting until then, so I brought you the Spirit Eye Perception jade slip to practice for now."

"How could I possibly accept this?!" Liu Changdie exclaimed, feeling both touched and uneasy.

However, before he could refuse, Li Xuanfeng grabbed his hand and placed the jade slip in it forcefully.

"Brother Changdie, you have worked tirelessly on our formation. How could I possibly delay giving this to you? This matter is settled, go ahead and practice!" he said with a hearty laugh.

Li Xuanfeng's words were firm, and he had, after all, handed over the jade slip forcefully. Liu Changdie, naturally cautious, instinctively wanted to withdraw but found that Li Xuanfeng's grip was like an iron vise. He could not pull away until Li Xuanfeng finally released his hand.

Liu Changdie was greatly shocked by his strength, thinking to himself, I used my mana unconsciously, yet I couldn't break free. It is no wonder that in my previous life, everyone in the city feared Li Xuanfeng. His strength is truly terrifying! In my previous life, Li Yuanjiao once said, 'Li Xuanfeng likes to kill demons with arrows. One demon general thought he couldn't fight in close combat and switched to attack him at close range, but Li Xuanfeng had merely laughed and grabbed it with his bare hands, killing it with two strikes!' I guess Li Yuanjiao wasn't exaggerating!

Li Xuanfeng noticed Liu Changdie's fear and quickly apologized, though there was a grin on his face.

"I have had great strength since childhood, and it seems I have startled you. My apologies!"

Li Xuanfeng's extraordinary strength was due to talisman qi, but of course, he was not going to say that to Liu Changdie. Seeing Liu Changdie repeatedly say "It is fine," Li Xuanfeng added, "Once you have taken the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, you can start practicing."

"Of course... Thank you," Liu Changdie said gratefully.

After Liu Changdie had taken the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, Li Xuanfeng handed over the jade slip and continued, "This perception technique is difficult to master. No one in our family has succeeded in practicing it so far, so please do read the content carefully."

Liu Changdie, full of joy, accepted the jade slip eagerly.

"No problem... no problem at all!"

Li Xuanfeng had also practiced this perception technique. Lacking a crucial heavenly material called Pure Essence Spirit Water made it exceedingly difficult to master. Seeing Liu Changdie's confident demeanor, his thoughts stirred, thinking to himself, The ancestor said that this man is shrouded in mystery and harbors many secrets... Perhaps he also knows the source of the Pure Essence Spirit Water. I must remain vigilant!

He cupped his fist and said, "Brother Changdie, if you discover any insights during your practice of this perception technique, please share them with my family. You will be generously rewarded!"

"Of course! Of course!" Liu Changdie agreed readily. Li Xuanfeng wasn't sure if he had thoroughly examined the content but could only cup his fist in return and left on the wind.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Within a month, the grand formation on Mount Huaqian was completed. Liu Changdie managed to restore seventy percent of the original power of the Earth-Locked Huaqian Formation set up by Wan Huaqian. It was more than enough to fend off late-stage Qi Cultivators. It also drew power from the spirit spring within the Mount Huaqian cave dwelling which circulated endlessly. This made it particularly effective against groups of low-level Qi Cultivators and could even hold off a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator for the duration it took to burn a stick of incense. Li Xuanfeng was very pleased with this.

With this matter settled, Liu Changdie eagerly went to Mount Huazhong to modify the formation plate. Li Yuanjiao saw off the formation master with mixed feelings of both amusement and relief.

"That man is overly enthusiastic, always dragging me into long conversations! Although he means well, it makes me very uneasy..." Li Yuanjiao complained. He was clad in black and was seated casually on the high seat, sipping spirit wine and exhaling warm air.

Hearing this, Li Qinghong, who was smiling brightly, blinked playfully. Her voice, light and pleasant, teased, "I rarely visit Mount Huaqian, and Brother Jiao has me listen to complaints. Maybe this person isn't the one making you uneasy. Now that I think about it, your big day is drawing near. It's quite amusing to see you so restless!"

Li Yuanjiao gave an embarrassed smile, realizing how easily Li Qinghong had seen through him. He stammered, "I wonder what kind of woman she is..."
ùó≥ùê´ùöéùó≤ùö†ùöéùóØùïüùê®ùòÉùöéùóπ.ùó∞ùóºùó∫

Li Qinghong giggled, holding her wine cup to her red lips but not drinking. She mimicked a middle-aged man's voice, sounding gruff and hearty as she said, "In that case, we do have a direct concubine-born daughter named Xiao Guiluan‚Äîwho is excellent in character and appearance. She is surely a perfect match for Yuanjiao!"

Li Yuanjiao glared at her and, seeing her laughing to herself, said irritably, "You seem to enjoy this! Do you know how tormented I feel?!"

Li Qinghong's expression turned serious but she was still smiling softly. "I heard that Xiao Guiluan has already reached the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm... She is definitely very talented. Since they say her character and appearance are exceptional, what is there to worry about? You can't possibly ask for more when your wife has already met all these three criteria!"

Li Yuanjiao sighed deeply and replied, "No cultivator could possibly look bad. Besides, even the most beautiful face will wither after a century. To me, appearance is the least valuable attribute‚Äîit's hardly worth mentioning."

Li Yuanjiao drank some wine and began to speak his mind. He raised one finger and continued, "As for talent, being too exceptional or too lacking creates divisions among people... Being evenly matched is the best."

Lowering his finger, Li Yuanjiao's face showed a trace of concern as he said, "What worries me most is character. Senior Xiao Yuansi is an honest person, but when he says someone has excellent character, who knows what that truly means..."

Li Qinghong nodded thoughtfully and asked carefully, "Are you worried that Xiao Guiluan might be too kind? Or perhaps too weak?"

Li Yuanjiao sneered and replied, "Whether kind or ruthless, if she cannot read people's expressions, understand situations, or tolerate human nature... possessing any one of these flaws could bring disaster."

Li Qinghong fell silent for a moment before nodding in agreement.

"Brother, you have a point... but I still have one more question," she said solemnly.

Seeing Li Yuanjiao raise his eyebrows, Li Qinghong's expression turned sorrowful as she said softly, "But our eldest brother... he excelled in every way, yet he met such a tragic end..."

Li Yuanjiao closed his eyes and let out a long sigh, answering, "Excelling in everything only means you have barely managed to get on the chessboard to become a pawn in this great contest‚Äîa plaything for the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators."

Li Qinghong was momentarily speechless. She harbored dreams of pursuing immortality and longevity, but despised the behavior of the Purple Mansion Realm and Golden Core Realm cultivators. She remained silent, watching Li Yuanjiao drink his wine before he laughed and said, "Regardless, the future depends on us."

Li Qinghong nodded and smiled, "Alright, let me tell you, brother... I am about to condense the final chakra."

Li Yuanjiao froze, then slammed his cup down heavily and said angrily, "Damn it! Why are you still drinking here...? Go back to your cultivation!"

Li Qinghong laughed lightly before excusing herself and then left the courtyard. As she walked a few steps in the clear breeze, seeing the bustling scene at the foot of the mountain, she gripped her spear tightly and thought, Among all my siblings, I'm the most talented. In the future, I must be the shield for our family. I cannot afford to slack even one bit!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The Xiao Family was now a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan. The Azure Pond Sect had gifted them nearly half of Lixia Prefecture, and the northern Golden Tang Gate had ceded six towns to them.

Although the territory was not small, the population had significantly decreased due to the Azure Pond Sect's past practices of overexploitation. However, it was still sufficient to support the mundane members of the Xiao Family.

The terrain of Mount Xianyou was gentle and its spiritual energy was abundant. Since Xiao Chuting's breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm, the highest peak, Xianyou Peak, had been designated for his exclusive use.

The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had moved to other peaks, yet the spiritual energy of Mount Xianyou remained ample, easily sustaining the cultivators of this region.

Amidst the undulating mountains, a low peak was illuminated by the moonlight, casting a bright glow over the courtyard. The surroundings were intricately decorated with glimmering lights, giving an air of opulence.

In the main courtyard sat a young woman in green. She was without makeup, her brows like willow leaves and her phoenix eyes sparkling with life. Her slender, white hand held an ink brush, gently sketching on the cloth in front of her. In a soft voice, she asked, "All the gifts for my husband's family are prepared... Is there any portion left from the family's allocation?"

A servant nearby bowed and replied, "Aside from the nine chests of dowry, there are just over ten Spirit Stones left, my lady. I am not sure if that will be enough."

The young woman in green, Xiao Guiluan, brushed her hair back and counted, "The Li Family heavily utilizes external clans... Tian, Liu, Ren, Xu, Chen, and even Madam Dou‚Äîthese minor clans all need to be properly attended to. Just over ten Spirit Stones are indeed insufficient..."

The dowry provided by the Xiao Family was actually quite generous, but after all the necessary preparations for the wedding, there wasn't much remaining. Xiao Guilan furrowed her delicate eyebrows as she asked gently, "Have you asked my father about this? Is he really unwilling to provide more?"

The servant hesitated before nodding, then shook her head with a hint of frustration. She lowered her voice as she answered, "No, my lady. There have been several occasions now where the people sent to the foot of the mountain could not even get past the front gate."

"I guess I can't blame him..." Xiao Guiluan mumbled softly. After all, she was about to be married to the west. She simply shook her head quietly and said, "A married daughter is like spilled water; he is naturally displeased."

"But... the Li Family is, after all, a prestigious clan... It is not a poor match at all! The old master's action is rather harsh," the servant said, visibly upset.

Xiao Guiluan smiled gently, explaining, "If I followed his wishes obediently and brought in a cultivator as a live-in son-in-law, it would add significant support to him. Now that I am marrying into another family, I might be flourishing, but considering how he has no affection for me, he would only feel that he is losing out greatly and is naturally unhappy."

The servant quickly fell silent, not daring to speak further. Xiao Guiluan placed her brush down and removed a jade bracelet from her wrist that glimmered with mana light.

She instructed, "This jade bracelet, which I have used since condensing my Profound Scenery Chakra, helps to calm the mind and absorb spiritual energy. It is a fine treasure. Take it down the mountain, find someone trustworthy to pawn it, and we can make up for the shortfall in Spirit Stones."

The servant was visibly uneasy and responded, "My lady... is this really necessary? It is just a few minor clans, they should be the ones flattering you instead of the other way round..."

Placing the jade bracelet into the servant's hand, Xiao Guiluan explained, "The Li Family has four branches, but there is only one family head. This requires long-term planning. You need not doubt my decision."

She paused for a moment after speaking and glanced at the cloth on the table, then added, "Make sure not to let anyone in the family know about this! The dowry that the family provides should indeed include a portion from Father, hence this shortfall. If he is unwilling to contribute, then so be it. But if the family finds out, he will be blamed, and it will stir up unnecessary trouble."

She squeezed the servant's hand and whispered, "The opportunity to marry into a prestigious clan is rare. We are at a critical juncture now, so let us avoid any incidents that could embarrass me."

Although Xiao Guiluan was of legitimate descent, she was born of a concubine. If she were to marry an external cultivator chosen by the family, the best she could hope for would be a Qi Cultivator, who would most likely be over fifty years old. At only seventeen or eighteen, Xiao Guiluan found that prospect unbearable.

She had seen the portrait of Li Yuanjiao. He was quite handsome, young, and at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, with the potential to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. Moreover, marrying into the Li Family as a daughter of the Xiao Family meant that she would be treated with utmost respect. The differences were stark, and Xiao Guiluan cherished this opportunity.

"Yes..." the servant responded softly.

Xiao Guiluan nodded, picking up the brush to record this amount of Spirit Stones as her father's contribution. Just then, there was a light knock on the door of the courtyard. Xiao Guiluan frowned and called out, "Who is it?"

"A servant of Master Xiao Jiuqing, delivering gifts from Mount Yu!" came the answer from beyond the door.

"Xiao Jiuqing..." Xiao Guiluan signaled to the servant, who quickly went to open the door.

A young servant kneeled outside the courtyard, not daring to enter, holding up a small embroidered pouch.

"A gift for the young lady!"

The servant took it and handed it over to Xiao Guiluan. She weighed the small pouch and estimated it to contain about five or six Spirit Stones to her delight. She responded, "Tell your master that I appreciate the generous gift. His contribution is very much appreciated!"
ùöèùï£ùïñùöéùö†ùöéùöãùöóùê®ùêØùïñùïù.ùïîùê®ùïû

The young servant repeatedly acknowledged her, not daring to look up at Xiao Guiluan, and then retreated. The servant girl closed the door and asked curiously, "My lady, we have never had any dealings with Xiao Jiuqing from Mount Yu... Why is he being so kind?"

Xiao Guiluan covered her mouth with a smile and drew a circle on the cloth, answering, "He is trying to curry favor! He sees potential in the Li Family... or specifically, in Li Yuanjiao."

Despite her intelligence and wit, Xiao Guiluan was ultimately just a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl. Seeing her future husband being so highly regarded brought her a bit of joy.

She picked up the brush again and wrote the letter Jiao on the cloth, murmuring, "Whether he is gentle or fierce, let us hope he is not a fool."
