# Chapter 838: Taking Action

"Hold on, fellow Daoist."

Li Xuanfeng gave no further reply. The black-clad youth below was extremely alert. He merely glanced once up at them and instantly stirred up devil winds, his robe billowing as he fled in the opposite direction. If he was not struck down in time, he could become a future threat.

Li Xuanfeng drew back his bowstring and a golden arrow settled onto the string. The youth below immediately felt his ears ring, dread flooding his heart as his body trembled with instinctive alarm.

Their eyes had met earlier. Li Xuanfeng’s perception technique had pierced through the black mist on the youth’s face and saw his features clearly. The youth had also seen his features. The moment he saw that bow in Li Xuanfeng’s hand, he prepared to flee, with high alert in his heart.

Now, understanding dawned upon him like a plunge into an icy lake. He shuddered inwardly, That’s the Bianyan’s Immortal Bow, Li Xuanfeng...

This youth was none other than Helian Changguang of Tiefo State, the one who had fought Li Qinghong during the devil plague. Back then, Li Qinghong had slain the female cultivator at his side and obtained a Dharma robe which had later been forged into the Cyan Sparrow Plume. She had once worried over it and specifically mentioned it to Li Xuanfeng.

As Li Xuanfeng loosed an arrow, thoughts raced through Helian Changguang's mind like lightning. He quickly made a judgment in his heart, Seems the small hall I was heading toward has already caught their eyes, this arrow is to block me!

So he immediately leaped away from the hall, not hoping to dodge the ghostlike arrow, but fully presenting a posture of retreat. Devil smoke churned beneath his feet as he stepped back twice. Pain bloomed in his chest, and he coughed up blood.

Though Helian Changguang was Tiefo State royalty, their nation was already weak, and in recent years had suffered a severe decline in talent. Things had gotten so bad that a mere mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator like him had been sent out. Clearly, there was no one else to use.

Helian Changguang had been constantly on edge during this whole foray. Any random cultivator around him would at least be in late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm and many even stronger. Just now, he had merely clashed with a single devil and had nearly been killed.

He was a naturally cautious man. He couldn’t see where the arrow came from nor where it would go. All he felt was a numbness and pain, and suddenly a gaping hole had opened in his chest. Terror consumed him.

To have such a towering reputation... he truly is exceptional. When weapon mastery reaches its peak, it births intent. This man surely possesses arrow intent...

He had no intention of entangling himself with Li Xuanfeng. He immediately turned to flee, pulling out a life-saving talisman as black energy ignited around his body. He muttered under his breath, "Translucent Bloodsilver Technique!"

But Li Xuanfeng only drew nearer. The first arrow returned to his bowstring, and another leaped up from his waist. He pulled the string taut once more.

"Strike!"

In the distance, the black-clad youth's head exploded like a watermelon, releasing a cloud of blood mist. His hands clawed at where his head had been, and his headless body panicked further, transforming into a streak of devil light and fleeing at top speed.

He really means to kill me!

Helian Changguang couldn't guess Li Xuanfeng's thoughts. He poured all of his mana and blood essence into his spell. He pushed the Translucent Bloodsilver Technique to its limit, forming a silver-red aura that worked to expel as much of the Astral Qi from his body as possible.

"Hmm?"

Helian Changguang's Translucent Bloodsilver Technique was a secret method of the Whole Pill Dao. Perhaps it was the outer world's qi or the nature of the secret realm, but its power had inexplicably increased. He coughed up a blood arrow, but it was shredded by Astral Qi before it could touch the ground.

This surprised Li Xuanfeng. His Astral Qi had been refined through a combination of spiritual orifices and lifelong cultivation, and was now enhanced by two Immortal Foundations. Its power was terrifying.

Once someone was infected by his Astral Qi, it clung like a bone-rotting parasite. It would bind to one's mana and, once inside the body, would take years to purge. It was not something a simple blood cough could resolve.

Perhaps his spell art is truly extraordinary... thought Li Xuanfeng.

Li Xuanfeng didn’t recognize his Immortal Foundation, but beside him, Si Yuanli gave a soft exclamation of surprise. Li Xuanfeng’s waist quivered as three more arrows jumped up. His vigilance had deepened.

According to Qinghong's description, this man is cautious, capable, ruthless and decisive. That seems entirely accurate.

Though his cultivation is still shallow, he’s already able to dissolve my Astral Qi. His technique must be marvelous. He’s simply not strong enough to unleash its full potential. Someone like him mustn’t be allowed to escape. I must not be careless. It’s better to eliminate him early and avoid future trouble.

He drew his golden bow to a full moon curve. Five arrows circled the bow but did not touch the string. Instead, a gold-red arrow darted from his waist like a swimming fish and settled obediently on the bow.

Clang!

A burst of golden-red light erupted in the distance. Si Yuanli felt a sudden gust of wind sting his face and couldn’t help but glance at the middle-aged man beside him in astonishment, "Brother Xuanfeng, isn’t that a bit much to kill a chicken with an ox blade?"

His only answer was a buzzing sound, as Li Xuanfeng vanished from his side. When Si Yuanli looked up, he saw that while Helian Changguang's devil light was fast, it was not nearly fast enough to outpace the arrow. He had already turned into a sky full of devil smoke.

Li Xuanfeng's eyes flashed with golden light as he flew at lightning speed into the devil smoke. His Heavenly Gilded Helm was operating at full power, enhancing his speed even further. He reached into the smoke and snatched at something, finally stopping to scan his surroundings with narrowed eyes.

Si Yuanli stepped closer and saw the fierce man slowly open his palm, revealing a silver-gray drop of mercury that writhed and spun in his hand, radiating a faintly intoxicating glow.

A thin layer of silver light coated the mercury drop, resisting Li Xuanfeng’s mana and preserving Helian Changguang’s soul. But now, that light was gradually fading, growing dimmer and dimmer.

Si Yuanli feigned sudden realization, exhaled heavily, and said quietly, "The Whole Pill Dao is known for its mystique. As expected, it includes many life-saving spell arts. If not for Brother Xuanfeng’s vigilance, this one would have truly escaped."

Li Xuanfeng nodded silently. The drop of mercury in his palm suddenly revealed a face. He was high-nosed and deep-eyed, unmistakably Helian Changguang himself. His voice was sorrowful as he said, “Immortal seniors, I have never offended either of you... I merely lingered a few steps too long; does that warrant my death? Senior Xuanfeng, your junior killed my concubine, took my dharma artifact, and chased me to ruin and dismemberment. I’ve not sought revenge, yet now you seek my life? Is this the act of a true and righteous man...”

Helian Changguang had pieced together the reason for Li Xuanfeng’s murderous intent in just a few seconds. His voice turned mournful, filled with pitiful desperation.

Si Yuanli laughed heartily and simply said, "You’re a devil head, does killing you need a reason? Man-eaters and blood-drinkers like you deserve death from all."

Li Xuanfeng merely tilted his head, gaze shifting away. He didn’t reply to Helian Changguang at all. His mana grew brighter and brighter, polishing away the silver sheen on the mercury drop.

Crack...

Before Helian Changguang could respond again, Li Xuanfeng’s radiant mana had surged past all resistance. His soul was instantly annihilated, leaving only the dimly glowing drop of mercury behind.

Li Xuanfeng’s mana hadn’t harmed the object at all. He swirled his mana around it once and withdrew it. Li Xuanfeng stared at the drop of mercury lying silently in his hand. He suspected it to be a dharma artifact, so he channeled his mana through it a few more times, but no dharma light emerged.

Could it be a spirit item...? Li Xuanfeng frowned as he tried to determine its origin. The ever observant Si Yuanli saw his mana flash twice and softly remarked, "I doubt it’s a Purple Mansion Realm spirit item. It seems this man’s entire cultivation was transformed into a spirit item and condensed into this tiny mercury drop. It’s quite a curiosity indeed."

His words were clear enough. Li Xuanfeng flipped his hand and stored the item, silently wondering, If this is a Purple Mansion Realm spirit item, perhaps Daoist Master Qiushui could make use of it? If I can use it to earn her goodwill and trade for the Radiant Sky Stone, that would be ideal...

Si Yuanli had recovered Helian Changguang’s dharma artifact, but his storage pouch could no longer be found. The crafty youth had embedded a small spirit array in it so that his sudden death destroyed the pouch, burning away nearly all of its contents. Only a few durable spirit items had fallen into the lake.

The two said little and made their way toward the small palace. Si Yuanli quickly passed through the corridor and paused at the main hall’s entrance, studying it closely. Though he had confirmed something internally, he still voiced apparent surprise, "Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng! This hall still has remnants of a formation!"

"Oh?" Li Xuanfeng followed him down and paused at the entrance. Two stone statues sculpted into Three-Eyed Mount Tiao Beasts, famed for guarding formations and drawing wealth, flanked the door. The ancients had favored them as household guardians.

"What a fine ancient formation!" Si Yuanli stopped and pointed to the formation, marveling, "Come take a look quickly, this formation is quite something. It’s a rare ancient formation with the Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang as its cores. These two Fruition Attainments never manifested but also never shifted, so the formation can still function to some extent. The owner of this hall must have been extraordinary..."

He seemed thoroughly intrigued, speaking at length from the formation’s foundational patterns to its yin-yang balance, even touching on the impact of Shangyuan Dao attainment. Li Xuanfeng listened thoughtfully, Perhaps opening this formation will trigger some major change. Si Yuanli is likely stalling on purpose until it’s closer to the time we leave the Great Ning Palace, so as to avoid complications.

Li Xuanfeng didn’t press him, treating it as an opportunity to hear some rare stories. Since Si Yuanli seemed to be making idle conversation, he deliberately asked something obscure, "That’s interesting. Do you know how many have attained the Fruition of Yin and Yang today?"

Si Yuanli faltered slightly, but had no choice but to answer, "The Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang Fruitions are very exalted. The last few holders were all immortals. The Supreme Yang once belonged to Immortal Yingze... and the Supreme Yin to the Immortal Lord of Moonlight Origin Mansion. Unfortunately, both disappeared ages ago and have left no traces...

"Whether they are dead or in seclusion attempting breakthroughs, I’m just a humble cultivator and wouldn’t dare speculate. It would only shorten my lifespan... better not to say more."

As he spoke, standing idly started to feel awkward. He placed a hand on the formation, seemingly studying its patterns and thinking of ways to break it.

His tone was casual. "As for Bright Yang and Veiled Yin, fellow Daoist surely knows more about Bright Yang than I do, so I won’t elaborate. But Veiled Yin has remained vacant ever since its previous bearer was slain by the Wei Emperor, which is what set the current trend of male cultivators vastly outnumbering females..."

He had spoken too quickly and paused for two seconds, as if realizing he had said too much. He hurriedly glossed over the two Fruition Attainments and said in a low voice, “Lesser Yang is none other than the Lesser Yang Devil Monarch, Kuai Li! The tale of Splitreed Island is known across the world... The Devil Monarch was split into three by Immortal Yingze, which led to the rise of Dragon Monarch Xiyang. To this day, Dragon Monarch Xiyang still considers Immortal Yingze his senior.

“‘Lesser Yin’ is even more elusive, few Dao lineages have even heard of one that bears it...”

He barely finished his words and noticed Li Xuanfeng was about to ask more. Unease crept in. There were many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators watching from outside, many from Golden Core Dao lineages. If he said the wrong thing, it would be troublesome. He made up his mind and quickly patted the formation, saying urgently, "Brother Xuanfeng, I’ve found a way."

Not allowing another interruption, he handed the green cauldron to Li Xuanfeng and quickly said, “This formation once reached Purple Mansion Realm at its peak, but it’s decayed over time. Look at this...”

He pointed at the eight rays of light at the center of the formation. There were six outer ones surrounding two inner yin-yang flows. He explained, “The inner two represent Supreme Yin and Supreme Yang Fruition. But two of the six outer lights have failed. What remains are Pristine, Converging, Joy, and Geng. Remove these four, and we can immediately enter the formation.”

Li Xuanfeng took a close look. He wasn’t well-versed in formations, but noticed that Si Yuanli had produced two white talismans and placed them in his palm. He glanced at the talismans. They shimmered faintly with multicolored light, about three fingers wide and a palm’s length. One bore four words in green-gray ink, Turn Pristine into Converging.

The other was written in pale golden-white script, nearly blending into the paper itself, Borrow Geng for Joy.

The two talismans matched the four formation aspects perfectly. Si Boxiu’s intentions were now plain; it was the moment when hidden knives were drawn. Si Yuanli raised the talismans high, as his slouch vanished and he straightened.

His gaze sharpened, all trace of weakness gone, and he spoke in a solemn tone, “By the Mandate of Heaven, Geng is lent to Joy, as dragon and serpent struggle, Pristine is turned into Converging... thus granting access to true law, and wondrous divine ability...”
𝒇𝒓𝒆𝒆𝙬𝒆𝒃𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝒎

Though he spoke rapidly, his voice carried solemn weight. It hung in the air for two seconds before green-gray and pale gold lights burst from his hands, shooting skyward and exploding in brilliant flashes.

Boom!

Green raindrops began to fall from above. Li Xuanfeng had prepared in advance, so his mana gathered into a golden shield before him, blocking the sweeping aftermath as he silently stepped back.

His eyes opened slightly, golden mana gleaming white. The corridor beneath his feet collapsed, revealing a sheet of deep blue Converging Water before the main hall. Two green fish-shaped bells hanging from the eaves jingled, then fell mid-air, disintegrating into beads of bronze before hitting the ground.

The six rays of light in the formation flickered. The green Pristine and blue Converging reversed, while the white Joy and golden Geng inverted. The entire formation crumbled like dust in the wind, collapsing without force and dissolving into scattered color.

Unlike most broken formations, no shockwaves spread, nor did any restrictive power activate. It was as if the formation had never existed, leaving behind only a hollow gleam.

Creak...

The hall doors swung open with a creak. Si Yuanli, now energetic and unrecognizably spry, leaped inside. His deep voice echoed out, "Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng! Take whatever you wish inside, I only want the scroll on the table. But we must leave in ten seconds! Once the others arrive, escape will be impossible!"
