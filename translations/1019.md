# Chapter 1019: Ten Thousand Chariots

Chen Yang...

Li Suining lowered his gaze and cupped his hands, his expression serene. Hearing his words, a smile bloomed on Chen Yang's face.

"Young Master speaks truly," he said, nodding. "This bond cannot be erased. In the past, whenever a distinguished figure arrived on the island, I would always pay my respects. My recent seclusion has made me remiss in my duties. Please, do not take offense."

Li Suining's words were so perfectly crafted that Chen Yang couldn't help but smile. The 'Qingdu bloodline' was a concept that Chen Yang and others had quietly promoted. It referred to the few families who had first intermarried with the main house and remained close for generations, their ancestors all having been under the jurisdiction of the Qingdu Clan Arbiter. The most prominent among them were the Chen, Liu, Tian, and Ren families.

Drawing such a line served two purposes. First, it fostered a deeper sense of integration with the primary clan name. Second, it was a move against the rising stars, factions like the Funan Sect of the Ding Clan, the Western Shore He Clan Faction, the entire Nanzhang lineage, and the Huayu Sect of the An Clan. These factions were powerful in their own right, whether through their large numbers of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, their control over artifact refinement, or their sheer population of cultivators.

The title 'Qingdu bloodline' created a clear class distinction from these up-and-comers. It was a status the four Lijing families had always championed, while other cultivators remained silent. How could Chen Yang not be pleased by Li Suining's open acknowledgment? His eyes overflowed with mirth as he looked at him.

Li Suining understood the situation perfectly. In his past life, Nantanchen had argued with Jinguang, and Jinguang had retorted with a single, devastating line: 'I am of the Qingdu blood! How could I be ordered about by a remnant of a forgotten bloodline?' The accusation had struck a nerve, exposing Nantanchen's painstakingly crafted identity as a descendant of the Tian Clan. He had harbored a grudge ever since, and the conflict between the factions had escalated dramatically.

Though that event had not yet occurred in this timeline, Li Suining knew exactly where Chen Yang's pride lay. His flattery hit its mark, and Chen Yang nodded repeatedly, his face a mask of righteousness as he declared, "If you face any difficulties in the future, you have but to come to me!"

Li Suining didn't believe a word of it, but he smiled warmly. "Guest Retainer Chen is too kind."

This Guest Retainer Chen, the future General Chen, had actually met a decent end. When King Wei sought gold, the two princes fell in the north, vanishing without a trace. It wasn't until Li Zhouming rallied forces to the Southern Borderlands that fragments of news emerged.

Less than a tenth of King Wei's old guard survived. General Chen had gathered the remnants and defected to the Zhao Court, where he was held in high regard. Because the blood of the Wei-Li flowed in his veins—though the Bright Yang was not from his paternal line, and he cultivated Pit Water—he was accepted.

'Veiled Yin and Pit Water are compatible,' Li Suining mused. 'And he was a fallen scion of the Bright Yang who defected to the Zhao. At that time... he became a rather useful figure.'

This Guest Retainer Chen was a master of diplomacy, navigating complex relationships with ease. He had secured a minor official post under the Profound Governance Pavilion. Though he wasn't a major power player, his skill allowed him to maintain close ties with the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. After that, news of him became scarce. Even up to the day of his own death, Li Suining had never heard of him again.

'Chen Yang... ultimately carries half of my Li Clan's blood. Finding his way to the Zhao Court... naturally afforded him a good position.'

This was all in the future, after the Li Clan's decline. When the tree falls, the monkeys scatter. Li Suining didn't dwell on it, but his past life's experience told him this man was exceptionally cunning.

'He is, after all, one of the few outstanding figures from the Lijing faction. He was given great responsibility back then, earning considerable merit. His talent is first-rate even among the cultivators of the Lake today, and his words could reach the ear of King Wei... If I could get closer to him... it would be a great help to my future plans.'

Thus, he maintained his smile.

"Senior was in seclusion a few days ago, but I saw the phenomena in the south. The river boomed, and everyone was watching. Jinguang's cultivation has certainly become profound!"

"Hahahaha!"

Jinguang breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, and Chen Yang himself advancing to the late stage after taking a pill, had elevated the Chen family's power to a new level. This was a joyous occasion. Chen Yang laughed heartily and clapped Li Suining's shoulder, his expression turning serious.

"The Daoist Master has returned. I must go report and express my gratitude, so I cannot linger. When you have free time from your formation studies, feel free to visit me on the main island. Jinguang and the others... have all heard of your great name!"

After another round of pleasantries, the two parted ways. Chen Yang exited the pavilion. As he stepped out, the smile on his face slowly faded. A young man approached from the corridor, bowing his head.

"Father!"

Chen Yang gave a silent nod, his eyes narrowing slightly.

'A formidable one... I hear his skill in the Dao of formations is exceptional. In the future, he'll be a figure like Li Que'wan, someone who can ascend the mountain. The signs are already there. He's worth trying to win over...'

He paused for a moment in the gallery, his gaze sweeping unintentionally across the golden vessel in the sky. A flicker of hazy, stirring ambition flashed in his eyes.

'The destruction of Changxiao is proof of our power. In the shifting tides, the mountain's leeway... is enough for us to claim a divine ability...'

'Opportunity... where does it lie?'

The golden vessel glided across the sky as Chen Yang and his son vanished from sight. Li Suining withdrew his gaze and descended the steps one by one.

Billowing waves of energy made his robes flutter. Streams of light were landing one after another on the island. The golden vessel came to a halt, the grand formation within it glowing brightly as it slowly opened.

As Li Suining was admiring the sight, a middle-aged man with an honest face hurried over. He reached Li Suining, his expression one of extreme excitement.

"Suining!" he called out.

Li Suining instinctively looked up. Zhoufang had already grabbed his hand and was pulling him forward, whispering conspiratorially, "Come!"

The elder's hand was warm, and his face was flushed with excitement. He led him all the way to the front of the vessel, presented a token, and entered through a small side door. Only then did he let go, a wide grin on his face.

"Look!"

Countless points of pure white light glittered in their eyes. As far as the eye could see were seemingly endless stacks of white jade boxes, piled neatly, filling the entire cabin.

Li Suining was momentarily speechless, slowly looking around. Carts loaded with spiritual resources were flying out from the vessel's hold, forming a long, unbroken dragon in the air. The storage compartments on both sides opened with a roar. Spiritual rice, as vast as the sands, cascaded down like a golden waterfall, rapidly piling up in a jade pool before their stunned eyes.

The two of them were but tiny specks of light amidst this deluge of spiritual rice, frozen in astonishment inside the vessel.

A look of immense pride washed over Zhoufang's face. He said, his voice thick with emotion, "There's still more in the secret vaults of the Changxiao Gate! The family has already secured it. This is just the first shipment back!"

Li Suining's gaze swept over the hoard, his shock gradually turning to joy as he listened to the man continue.

"The wealth Changxiao accumulated over six generations... it's more than we could ever use!"

Zhoufang was not exaggerating. Li Suining's perspective was even broader than his; if this was true, these resources were enough for every descendant of the Li Clan to live in luxury for a century. Even during the great wars between north and south that were to come, there were few opportunities to completely annihilate an entire sect and claim all its wealth for oneself!

Li Suining had anticipated this, and his shock quickly morphed into delight. He turned to look at his elder, who had picked up two scattered jade boxes from the floor. He opened them gently, admiring the spiritual resources within.

"Look... this quality..." he sighed.

Li Suining looked on with him, unsure if Zhoufang intended to take a few portions for himself or point out a specific treasure. But the middle-aged man turned back, took his hand again, his eyes suddenly reddening.

"Suining," he said, his voice hoarse. "From now on, whether it's the Eastern Residence or the Western Residence, none of our kinsmen by the lake will ever have to suffer again!"

## Inner Array

The grand hall was dimly lit. Li Ximing stood with his hands tucked into his sleeves. Beside him, Li Jiangqian was slightly bowed, waiting in attendance. After a moment, a young man with golden eyes descended on a beam of light.

Li Jiangqian immediately prostrated himself. "Greetings, Father! Congratulations on vanquishing your southern foe, slaying a divine ability cultivator, and returning in great victory!"

When Li Zhouwei landed in the hall, the entire space seemed to brighten. His golden eyes shifted slightly toward Li Jiangqian.

"Rise."

"Yes, Father," Li Jiangqian replied respectfully, straightening up slightly. His gaze flashed imperceptibly over the inverted Radiant Sun King's Halberd at his father's waist, his expression and eyes betraying nothing as he lowered his back even further.

The light in the hall brightened and dimmed with him. The gold of his eyes was identical to the deep gold of the halberd, seemingly without a single impurity. He kept his gaze respectfully fixed on the floor.

Li Zhouwei took his seat. "How is your cultivation?"

Li Jiangqian glanced at him briefly before answering, "Your son has already refined Double Fire and Heavenly Apricot. I have begun work on the third stage of the Radiant Fire secret method, Setting the Snare."

"Heavenly Apricot..." Li Zhouwei pinched his fingers together in a quick calculation, a hint of surprise in his voice. "You mastered Heavenly Apricot much faster than expected. Did you have some assistance?"

Li Jiangqian nodded calmly. "Heavenly Apricot is closely related to the Scripture of Heavenly Radiance and the Waning Sun, which provided a boost. Coupled with my own small measure of Dao-Profundity, I was fortunate enough to succeed."

His expression turned slightly regretful. "I was quite pleased after mastering this art, but when I began the third stage, Setting the Snare, the difficulty increased by several levels. I fear it will not be a matter of two or three years. And the final stage, True Flame, is said to be the most difficult of all."

Li Ximing looked impressed and offered some comforting words. "This cannot be rushed, but it must be mastered. Not everyone is like your father. If you can master these two secret methods in ten or fifteen years, you will already be blessed by great fortune."

"Yes!"

Li Jiangqian bowed. Li Ximing then took a jade box from his sleeve and opened it for him to see. Inside lay a round, golden stone.

"You need not worry about spiritual resources," Li Ximing said with a smile.

"Your father has already found the Radiant Fire spiritual item you need. Though we don't recognize its name, it is undoubtedly a Radiant Fire treasure!"

Overjoyed, Li Jiangqian took a step forward and fell to his knees. "I can never repay the immense kindness of you two elders!" he said in a low, heavy voice.

Li Ximing gave him a smiling glance and raised an eyebrow. "Will you take it now?"

It was a bona fide Purple Mansion Realm spiritual item. Even for the Li Clan, fresh off plundering a grotto-heaven, they likely had no more than five such treasures. The sight of it made Li Jiangqian's heart surge. "I ask only that the elders keep it for me. This junior will enter seclusion at once!" he kowtowed.

The allure of a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability was enough to make one risk life and limb. With such a treasure right before him, even a man as composed as him could not contain his excitement. After a deep bow, he hurriedly excused himself from the hall.

Li Zhouwei watched him go, seemingly lost in thought. Li Ximing cleared his throat and asked, "Did you truly kill him?"

"He's dead."

A trace of astonishment flickered in Li Ximing's eyes. "What did you gain?"

Li Zhouwei smiled faintly. He raised his left hand, forming a sword seal with two fingers. A small, searing wisp of black flame appeared at his fingertips.

The flame was somewhat ethereal, grey on the outside and black within. As it rose, the atmosphere in the hall shifted. The clang of armored soldiers and the clash of steel filled the air, and a wave of heat washed over them.

"This is..." Li Ximing's pupils constricted. "The Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts?!"

Realization dawned on him, and he slapped the table. "By slaughtering Cheng Yan, this art has benefited immensely!"

Li Zhouwei looked at the dark flame on his fingertip with a pleased smile. "Precisely! This art is a Profound Qi technique of the Great Liang, and it is also a primordial demonic cultivation method of old. One uses life-souls to refine a weapon and achieve a Dharma Body. I never had the chance to annihilate a sect before. Although the family did its best to create opportunities for me, I had only barely met the minimum requirements to use this art."

"After all my careful planning, the affair with the Changxiao Gate has finally provided the greatest possible boost to my Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts. I have crossed the threshold and gained an umbral soul, laying the foundation for the Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body!"

Li Ximing listened intently as Li Zhouwei continued, "Annihilating a sect enhances the maximum power of the Dark-Soul Mara Dharma Body, but I still need to nourish and maintain the umbral soul myself. I can either slaughter countless people and feed it with a sea of blood, or I can use the vast spiritual resources from the destroyed sect to cultivate... The two paths are different and will lead to different marvels."

Li Ximing clicked his tongue. "Are you going to use the resources from Changxiao Gate?"

Li Zhouwei shook his head. "The Dharma Body has only just formed its foundation and doesn't require much for now. I will not touch those resources. Only the massive stores of spirit rice are difficult to preserve, so I will take some to sate the Dharma Body's hunger and restore some of its power. There will be plenty of opportunities for great battles in the future."

His expression grew serious, tinged with regret. "It's a pity Cheng Yan was so pathetic. The Illuminating Sun and Moon requires an opponent of equal standing. Even though he died by my hand, it was less beneficial than if Shilou Yingge had been merely injured... My battle with Helian Wujiang and Shilou Yingge brought my Dao-Profundity close to Helian Wujiang's level. Cheng Yan proved to be utterly useless. What a waste!"

Li Ximing's expression was a bit strange. He nodded silently.

'...Actually... Cheng Yan cultivated for many years. And from the sounds of his Tome of Subjugating the Murky Mountain... his Dao-Profundity was probably higher than mine...'

As he pondered this, Li Zhouwei changed the subject. With a flick of his sleeve, several jade boxes shrouded in Heavenly Light landed on the table. The multicolored light dissipated, revealing the spiritual items within. Li Ximing glanced over them and smiled.

"Changxiao left quite a few things behind."

Li Zhouwei looked up and handed the round, Golden Core-like Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument back to him.

"Let the elders decide what to do with the Crane-Embrace Stone. The family is currently lacking life-restoring miracle pills. Please refine this Three-Branch Heart-Chilling Leaf for emergencies."

"Alright!"

Li Ximing agreed, taking two scrolls with profound patterns and several jade slips from him.

"The Mountain-Offering Stone-Splitting Art is of little use," Li Zhouwei continued. "The Tome of Subjugating the Murky Mountain has even stricter requirements. The Cold Light Scenery-Proclaiming Formula can be given to Jiangchun. The other Purple Mansion Realm cultivation methods are not very useful to our family, but at least we can trade them openly. Store them in the family treasury. As for this scroll, it needs to be opened by Vault Metal. We'll need Senior Liu to handle it."

His gaze fell upon a treasured vase.

"As for this Radiant Spirit-Vessel... I ask that you consume it, uncle."

"Hmm?"

Li Ximing was taken aback. Their family possessed the Six Harmonies Treasure Vase Treatise, so he knew exactly how to use this resource. Consuming it directly to cultivate spell arts was a bit of a luxury. "This..."

Li Zhouwei shook his head. "I know you're thinking of the Six Harmonies Treasure Vase. It is indeed a fine item, but our family neither cultivates the Upper Rite, nor is the Bright Yang particularly compatible with it. Why waste so much time and energy refining a vase? Grasping for too much, you'll end up with nothing. The Spiritual Treasures you and I possess are already enough to study for a hundred years!"

"The value of a spiritual resource isn't in its extravagance, but in its suitability. Consuming this spiritual essence to cultivate will elevate your spell arts to a new level. That is the better way to use it!"

Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then slowly nodded. "You have a point... My Great Radiance of White Brilliance can barely manifest a golden brilliance, and it's unlikely to see major improvement anytime soon. So, it's not worth using it there. But for Tread on Flames and Emperor Qi's Light, it could be very useful."

"As for the Wu Earth spiritual artifact..."

"I will ask Kuang Yu and the others to search the four seas for an Wu Earth Daoist Master. The Mountain-Offering Stone-Splitting Art, the Tome of Subjugating the Murky Mountain, and the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella are more than enough to establish a new Dao Lineage. Someone is bound to be tempted."

With the matter settled, Li Zhouwei slowly turned around. "Changxiao Gate controlled an entire Prefecture for hundreds of years. All of its resources now belong to our family. Uncle, care to guess... how much there is?"

Li Ximing paused for a moment, then chuckled. "Judging by the needs of a Foundation Establishment cultivator... I'd guess over a hundred treasure medicines and dharma artifacts?"

The golden-eyed young man shook his head. "The golden vessel has only brought back one or two-tenths of it. It will take ten days to half a month to move everything. The dharma artifacts we've acquired are enough to arm ten Jade Courts. The resources, even if used extravagantly, are enough for our entire clan to live in luxury for a century!"

Li Zhouwei grinned. "And there is also an Upper Rite array disk!"

This was the greatest prize from their southern campaign, something Li Ximing certainly hadn't forgotten. He nodded with a smile. "A Daoist Master with an established sect wouldn't use it, but we can find some masters who are trying to establish themselves in the outer seas. They lack resources but have plenty of time to modify the formation. If all else fails, we can entrust it to Senior Liu. He can handle both selling and repairing it. One family's gain can feed two!"

As they spoke of this, Li Zhouwei's expression grew solemn. "Is there any news from the Qunyi Archipelago?"

Li Ximing's smile vanished. "News from the Western Sea arrived first. The White Victory Dao made a move... something has happened to Fuxun and Qingyan. Senior Liu also received the news... but he has always been cautious. He suspects someone is trying to lure him out, so he's staying put at the Qunyi Archipelago and has only ordered the Demon King Fuxun to temporarily retreat to the Eastern Sea."

Li Zhouwei paced for a moment, then met Li Ximing's gaze.

Li Ximing shook his head. "The timing is too coincidental..."

Li Zhouwei nodded decisively.

"The White Victory Dao has deep ties to the Profound Governance Pavilion," Li Ximing mused. "After all, they were both once connected to the Lesser Yang... Could this be a scheme from the north?"

Li Zhouwei shook his head slightly and rubbed his brow. "It doesn't seem like it. Wei Xuanyin wouldn't go to such lengths. And for what purpose?"

He suddenly stopped. "I need to go see that Dragon Crown Prince."

Despite the destruction of Changxiao, neither man felt at ease. They fell silent, then rose and entered the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. Li Zhouwei stood in the pavilion, contemplating the celestial view. After watching him for a few moments, Li Ximing suddenly spoke.

"In the days you were away at Changxiao, I have been pondering your words..."

A complex look crossed Li Zhouwei's face as he listened.

"In truth," Li Ximing continued, raising an eyebrow, "the moment you were born into this world, the family should have understood. Nothing falls from the sky for free; everything has a purpose. You were right. The great one did not send you on this journey for nothing. The so-called act of reincarnation has always been a delusion."

Their eyes met.

"Our Wei-Li clan, my cultivation of Bright Yang, it was all in preparation for you," Li Ximing stated calmly. "For a minor noble house to rise to prominence in a mere hundred years, it needs a backer. You are our backer. Without you, the powers of the Lake would have crushed us long ago. The conflicts between north and south would not have repeatedly halted at our shores."

"Now, you have no choice but to contend."

Li Ximing paused, his expression growing tranquil.

"The family has no path of retreat. We must fight. Whatever the cost... be it myself, or Moongaze Lake... perhaps we can trade it all for a chance at radiance. Let us try."

Li Zhouwei turned his head, his golden eyes deep and dark. "Thank you, granduncle."

Li Ximing smiled faintly, then his expression turned serious.

"However... there is one matter that must be put on the agenda."

Seeing Li Zhouwei raise an eyebrow, Li Ximing said gravely, "The Dao lineage."

"Bright Yang Dao's Audience with the Celestial Gate and Sovereign's Perilous Tread are complete. What remains are Imperial Observation of the Origin, Crimson Severing Arrowhead, and World's Radiance."

"The day you perfect Sovereign's Perilous Tread should be soon. Whether it's Imperial Observation of the Origin or Crimson Severing Arrowhead, gathering the necessary qi will take three to five years. Although we have ample time, we must begin preparations."

Li Ximing paused briefly. "I have checked the pavilion. We have methods for both Imperial Observation of the Origin and Crimson Severing Arrowhead. Minghuang is watching over them. Which path will you cultivate first?"

"Good."

His words sent the golden-eyed young man into deep thought. He paced the hall before they walked into the pavilion together. The jade-like stone platform still glowed faintly, with black wooden slips resting upon it.

Li Zhouwei gently brushed a slip, and silver text materialized. He murmured.

"For Imperial Observation of the Origin, there is the Scripture of the Bright Mountain's Surging Waves. It is undoubtedly an ancient and supreme method, very likely a technique passed down from the Wei Imperial Palace."

"For Crimson Severing Arrowhead, there are two options. The first is the Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light, and the second is the Dharma Scripture of the Distant Crimson Guardian General..."

His expression turned serious, and he shook his head. "All three are shrouded in gray. We must seek them out one by one. For now, we can only choose one..."

"Crimson Severing Arrowhead is a method of attack, using the weight of ten thousand chariots to sweep away all obstacles. Imperial Observation of the Origin is an orthodox divine ability of a monarch ruling his subjects, issuing clear edicts. Both would be of great assistance."

Li Zhouwei lowered his voice. "In truth, the orthodox imperial path of Imperial Observation of the Origin is not necessarily more powerful, but its benefit to the Bright Yang is certainly greater. Otherwise, the Wei court would not have locked this art away in the palace, using the Eternal Brightness Steps as a replacement for the outside world..."

His tone shifted. "But from a cultivation standpoint, the Bright Yang is a dao of ascending step-by-step through clear ranks. For a Bright Yang Monarch who has trod the path of peril and reached the state of enlightenment and regret, Crimson Severing Arrowhead is clearly more suitable as the third divine ability. A grand and orthodox art like Imperial Observation of the Origin would be better suited for the fourth or fifth slot."

He studied the silver text carefully. Li Ximing looked concerned. "I have only one worry. Both Crimson Severing Arrowhead and Imperial Observation of the Origin are lineages that have been lost for a long time. Crimson Severing Arrowhead is more common; it can be found in the Eastern Fire lineage. But Imperial Observation of the Origin is a secret treasure of the Wei Kingdom. It will inevitably draw unwanted attention... Crimson Severing Arrowhead is the safer choice."

Li Zhouwei nodded. He raised his hand, the gold in his eyes deepening.

"The Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light."
