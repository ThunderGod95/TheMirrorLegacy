# Chapter 374: Eradicating the Pest

Three days passed in the blink of an eye. Wang Xun handed the Qingche Sword back to the Li Family, saying simply, "It is better than I expected; I only took one-tenth of the sword intent. Thank you all!"

Then, he flew away as if escaping, not daring to say another word. The two brothers looked at each other, realizing that this person truly did not want to get involved in worldly affairs and had only spoken more because he had a request.

One brother held the sword, and the other carried the jade box. They returned to the small courtyard on the mountain in the rain where the rest of the Li Family was already waiting.

Raindrops pattered down, and the courtyard was silent. On the smooth and simple table were several jade bottles, large and small, green and white, emanating spiritual qi. On the other end, there were five or six lonely jade bottles.

"Roughly, this is the situation..."

Li Yuanjiao explained the series of events in a low voice, "Currently, about seventy percent of the pills in the market come from the Azure Pond Sect, while only twenty to thirty percent come from the Xiao and Yuan Families. Now, consider carefully how we should handle this."

All the direct descendants of the Li Family were present. Li Qinghong stood silently to the side, holding her spear, while Li Yuanping bowed his head in thought. The younger generation, seated on the lower end, had varied expressions.

Seeing that Li Yuanping and Li Qinghong remained silent, Li Yuanjiao turned his gaze to the eldest, Li Xicheng, indicating for him to speak.

Li Xicheng, who had been lost in thought, quickly straightened up. After thinking for a moment, he said slowly, "In my opinion, these pills—though precious—are made from human lives... Our family has always upheld strict family traditions and prioritized nurturing the people. It is best to abandon these pills..."

Li Xicheng, who had gained experience managing affairs in Mount Yue, could articulate better now. He clearly suggested that the pills should no longer be used. Li Yuanjiao nodded and looked at Li Xijun.

Dressed in a white robe with silver edges, Li Xijun appeared more handsome. He said respectfully, "In my opinion, since our family will no longer use these pills, we should sell them in the market at slightly lower prices to convert them into Spirit Stones, quickly replenishing our family's resources while creating some buzz. Then, we should establish connections with the Xiao and Yuan Families to ensure future pill supplies come exclusively from them, avoiding the market."

"Excellent!"

Li Xijun, within a few dozen seconds, had provided a complete strategy that made Li Yuanjiao's eyes light up in both joy and pride.

Finally, Li Ximing spoke softly, "I have not yet broken through to the Jade Capital Stage and cannot focus solely on refining pills. We'll have to rely on the Xiao and Yuan Families for several years... Eighth brother's strategy is thorough, but I have one concern about these pills."

Li Ximing paused for a moment, then continued, "Pills made from blood qi, as rumored, are created using Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace techniques that produce a higher quantity and quality of pills... Are there no side effects or hidden dangers? Perhaps the harm is far greater than people know..."

His words made the three elders raise their eyebrows. Having read alchemy books, Li Ximing understood the risks better than the others. He continued, "My point is, even if we disregard the connection to human lives, we should not consume these pills. Who knows what risks they carry? The pills from the clans might not be as sought after as those from the Azure Pond Sect, but they are easier to acquire... so why not?"

"Indeed."

The three elders exchanged glances, and Li Yuanping smiled as he said, "You may all leave now."

After the younger generation had left and the courtyard gate closed with an isolating formation, Li Yuanping remarked, "The younger ones have truly grown."

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly and said, "Xicheng, although lacking substance, has become less unsophisticated and is willing to learn and improve, which is good... But Xijun is a practical one."

Li Xijun's complete strategy delighted the three elders. Li Qinghong, holding the Duruo Spear, appeared more relaxed and said gently, "Ximing is thoughtful, Xijun is strategic. It is thanks to your teaching, Brother Ping!"

Li Yuanjiao began to put away the pills on the table, contemplating on how to acquire the right connections with the Xiao Family without indebting them. He thought of seeking help from Xiao Yuansi and said with a smile, "Our family has taught through personal examples and historical lessons for three generations while maintaining strict traditions, which is why we have such outstanding descendants."

With the Profound Light of the mirror enhancing their spirits and the encouragement from the younger generation, the three elders felt much relieved. Li Yuanjiao exhaled deeply, picked up the jade box on the table, and, with a slightly lighter tone, said, "This spirit root, the Wanglin Blossom, is at least at the Foundation Establishment Realm... It needs to be watered with a spirit spring. We have one on Mount Huaqian that can be used."

The spirit spring on Mount Huaqian had a long history. Even during the Wan Family's time, the formation genius Wan Huaqian had used this spring to construct formations. Now, in the hands of the Li Family, the spring was primarily used to water spirit plants, hoping to save a few years' worth of growth and help alleviate the family's annual deficit.

"According to Wang Xun, this Wanglin Blossom cannot be stored in gold or jade. When it blooms, we should pick the flowers with wooden chopsticks and store them in a bamboo box," Li Yuanjiao explained.

"This flower cannot hear crying. If it hears crying, it will wither, so be mindful of that!" he reminded.

Li Qinghong nodded solemnly, taking the responsibility seriously. "I will guard Mount Huaqian for the next few years and watch over this spirit root," she said confidently.

"How are the two matters we discussed previously progressing?" Li Yuanjiao suddenly inquired.

Li Yuanping quickly responded, "The situation in Mount Yue is becoming more stable, and the Tian Family is cooperating well. It seems about time... Those fat Mount Yue nobles were like sheep ready for slaughter. They sided with us at the right time back then, so we did not touch them. Now, they are getting more arrogant and even starting to encroach on our spirit resources... We should kill a few to strengthen our family."

Li Qinghong, not being adept at household management and political maneuvers, frowned and asked, "Why not kill them all and send our own people to Mount Yue? Why keep a bunch of mountain pigs around?"

"Dear sister," Li Yuanping chuckled softly as he explained patiently, "If we send our own people, they would still be corrupt, and we will have to waste manpower to supervise them. If the branch families gain benefits, they might unite, making it harder to deal with them."

"Oh," Li Qinghong responded, frowning. Her clear voice then added, "I just returned to the mountain and noticed that the branch families down there do nothing but marry wives, take concubines, play games like pot-throwing, and keep dogs for racing... That does not seem right."

Li Yuanping nodded and continued, "You are right. These guys are indeed useless, hiding their corruption and shame, secretly occupying people's land, and exploiting them. Some even collude with merchants for power and wealth!"

"In the past, when there were fewer of them, the Clan Affairs Courtyard could suppress them. But now, with the family struggling and more relatives joining, our cultivators need to focus on nurturing spirit plants. We cannot waste time on them. And that brings me to my second matter..."

He then poured tea for Li Yuanjiao and continued with a smile, "Brother, regarding the issue you mentioned, I have found an opportunity. We need to look into the families on the eastern shore."

Taking out a gray map from the table, he explained, "To our north are Mount Huazhong and Mount Yuting, bordering the Yu Family. To the east of Mount Yuting are the families on the eastern shore... Among our neighbors are two families, one surnamed Rui and the other Pu."

"These two families only have cultivators in the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Their ancestors were enlightened by the Xiao Family and occupied small mountains. They united with nearby families to mine the local spirit ores for the Xiao Family." Li Yuanping paused and explained further, "Do you remember the Ding Family?"

"Of course," Li Qinghong replied, sipping her tea, "The Yuan Family's vassals and a small buffer household between the three families."

"Correct." Li Yuanping nodded and continued, "The Ding Family has several Qi Cultivators, including Ding Xiding in the late stage. These two families used to pay tribute to the Ding Family. After our ancestor broke through to Foundation Establishment Realm, Ding Xiding was so frightened that he came to pay his respects and abandoned these two families near our border. Without their tribute, these two families sent us gifts a few times. Seeing no response from us, they have become free and content, even attacking and plundering mortals."

"Plundering mortals...?" Li Yuanjiao asked, sensing something ominous.

Li Yuanping, having thoroughly investigated the matter, replied in a low voice, "I found it strange too, so I sent people to inquire. It turns out the Xiao Family only wants the spirit jade ore and does not require tribute, but the Ding and Yu families do. Hence, the eastern shore families have always been short of labor. Mortals, not needing spiritual energy but producing a lot of output, became their only option..."

When Li Yuanping spoke to this point, everything became clear. After all, it was the territory of the devil gates, and Li Yuanjiao had heard of such things before. Similar transactions involving rogue cultivators were also carried out by the Yu Family, and he had become somewhat accustomed to it. He merely nodded silently.

"I intend to intervene in the lands of the eastern shore families, supporting one or two small households in the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realms. This will be an opportunity to conscript over two thousand people from the branch families, specifically selecting those who are idle and frivolous."

Li Yuanping continued to outline his plans in great detail.

Li Yuanjiao nodded in realization, his narrow eyes showing satisfaction. Li Yuanping's gray-black eyes, rounder than Li Yuanjiao's and similar to Li Qinghong's, also reflected cunningness and intelligence.

"I will deliberately have Xicheng lead these troops. Xicheng is kind-hearted and gentle, reluctant to scold or shout. This group of frivolous men is already unreliable. Once they cross the borders into another family's territory, it is unlikely they will be able to restrain themselves from revealing their true nature..."

After saying this, Li Yuanping took a sip of tea and continued softly, "At that time, we will kill some, punish some, and release some. Who among the clan elders would dare voice opposition to such severe crimes? After this campaign, we can ensure at least forty years of clean governance!"

Beneath Yi Mountain City

Drip, drip.

Being close to the southern border, Yi Mountain City received ample rainfall. The heavy rain fell, mixing with the blood on the ground, turning the mud into a grayish-red slurry.

A youth with gray-black eyes stared at the city walls. His clothes were tattered, soaked with mud and water, and he stank terribly. Blending in with the other slave soldiers, he was indistinguishable.

"Another hour, and I can leave the city..."

Using his metallic essence to create a rift, Jiang Boqing had sent Jiang Yan to Yi Mountain City in one breath. The old man was in terrible shape, nearly draining Jiang Yan of all his energy to fuel the transport. This extreme exertion nearly depleted Jiang Yan's cultivation, leaving him barely able to recover.

Jiang Yan landed in a slave camp within the city, lying on a corpse where he lay stiffly for a while before slowly recovering. He looked up to see a vast white formation covering the sky, recognizing it as the first city of Jiangnan.

Despite his endless confusion, there was no time to ponder. Barefoot and disoriented, he sat in the camp, his heart full of confusion.

He deceived my father, killed my mother... all to refine the two shamanic talismans in my body... Why does it end like this?!

With Jiang Boqing dead, Jiang Yan felt both sorrow and bewilderment, not daring to think too much. He only knew that if he stayed here, he would be discovered sooner or later.

The great formation in Yi Mountain City was established by an immortal sect and was impossible to break through by force. Jiang Yan had to disguise himself as a slave soldier, waiting in the camp for half a month before encountering a demon beast raid.

"How laughable."

Jiang Yan's gaze swept over the emaciated commoners, immediately discerning the devil gate's intention. Coldly, he thought to himself, This is not defense... it's merely feeding the beasts!

Clang!

The tunnel entrance barely opened, revealing an array formation above him. The mind-bewildering formation activated, driving the commoners to madness as they rushed out.

"Ahhhh..."

Jiang Yan mingled with the crowd, only to face the gaping maw of a wolf demon. Its sharp white teeth glinted menacingly as the crazed commoners hurled themselves at it, resulting in a spray of blood and flying debris.

He took a detour, unable to fly now, and had no choice but to sprint. Unexpectedly, the demon seemed to find him interesting, turning to chase after him.

"Damn it!"

Though injured, Jiang Yan was not someone a mere low-level demon could bully. With a simple slap, he had sent the wolf demon staggering. He then flew low to the ground, escaping southward in a sorry state.

Atop Yi Mountain City.

Liu Changdie had already gone down to maintain the grand formation. Li Xuanfeng stood with his bow while Fei Yihe stood silently beside him, watching the approaching beast horde.

The other cultivators either held bows or spears, concentrating and imbuing their weapons with mana which caused them to glow mystically.

These cultivators, lacking any family heritage, either trained in swordsmanship or spear techniques, only developing sword or spear aura to attach to their weapons. Longer reach meant greater strength, so naturally, they chose spears to increase their chances of survival.

At most, they only managed to cultivate sword or spear qi. The latter had a wider range than sword qi, providing them with better chances of survival. Thus, except for a few disciples from prominent clans, most wielded spears.

They stood ready, and behind them were several green-robed cultivators, mostly at the mid to late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, standing with their hands behind their backs. All of them were disciples of Azure Pond Sect, overseeing the formation.

Screech!

A distant eagle cried, but it did not dare to approach. On the ground lay several corpses being devoured, likely the result of Li Xuanfeng's archery which had killed several creatures, deterring the rest from advancing.

After a while, a dozen or so demon beasts gathered together and finally mustered the courage to charge toward the city walls in a swarm.

"They are coming!"

Li Xuanfeng drew his bow, and the other cultivators quickly adjusted their formation to protect him at the center. They wielded spears and cast spells to fend off the attacking beasts. Black demonic arts clashed with the cultivators' spells, creating a cacophony of explosions.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

In just a few breaths, golden beams shot out from Li Xuanfeng's bow, each one seemingly sentient, seeking out the beasts' eyes, noses, and mouths with terrifying accuracy. Blood splattered everywhere and fur flew everywhere, prompting the disciples of the Azure Pond Sect to nod approvingly.

One of them whispered to the person beside him, "Senior Brother... without this man, these cultivators would not have lasted this long."

The person in front, who seemed to hold a high position, remained silent, his expression grave as he slowly furrowed his brow.

"Is that... a slave soldier?"

His gaze was fixed on the battlefield below, where amidst the bloody chaos, a slave soldier had slapped a wolf demon away and was fleeing at an incredible speed.

Surrounding demons quickly converged on him, making him highly conspicuous. Realizing he had been exposed, the slave soldier decided to fly, shooting like a meteor toward a distant forest.

The leading Azure Pond Sect disciple sneered, forming a golden beam of light in his hand, ready to release it. However, the disciple who had spoken earlier chuckled, "Senior Brother... why use a sledgehammer to crack a nut?"

He waved his sleeve and turned to the person below, smiling brightly as he said, "That Li Family archer, shoot that thing down."

The green-robed cultivator, with a shifty and sleazy appearance, boldly stepped forward. At his words, several Azure Pond Sect disciples turned their gazes toward Li Xuanfeng, who frowned slightly but had no choice but to nock an arrow and draw his bow.

These cultivators were mostly disciples of Yuanwu Peak, known for their condescending behavior toward Li Xuanfeng's group. Fei Yihe and the other cultivators, always submissive, looked nervously at Li Xuanfeng.

Thwang...

Li Xuanfeng remained silent, raising his golden longbow. With a deep breath, he drew the bowstring, gathering dazzling golden light that formed a radiant white arrow.

His eyes mirrored the tattered figure in the distance, the longbow in his hand exuding lethal sharpness. The slave soldier, sensing imminent danger, paused mid-air and turned to look back.

Cultivators possess extraordinary eyesight. Their gazes locked across a hundred chi, and Li Xuanfeng saw a pair of eyes brimming with resentment. A wave of familiarity washed over him as his heart stirred, and his grip on the bowstring slackened.

The arrow radiated light, streaking across the sky like a meteor, and in an instant, it pierced through the slave soldier's back. The slave soldier fell, twisting and turning like a bird with broken wings.

The green-clad cultivator laughed heartily, watching the brilliant trail of the golden-white arrow streak across the sky. He exclaimed, "Nice shot! That arrow is fast!"

He had a cunning and rat-like appearance that cheapened the elegant green robe he wore. He held his belly as he laughed, drawing glances from others. The higher-ranking man, handsome with a high nose bridge, glanced disdainfully at him and said coldly, "He's not dead."

Fei Yihe, who had been waiting for a while, quickly smiled obsequiously and said, "Exalted Immortal, you might not know, but my brother's archery is unique! Once hit, the target will have astral qi attached to them and be reduced into a blood puddle within three quarters of an hour."

The tall leader of the Azure Pond Sect disciples, towering over Fei Yihe, stared at his face for a moment before suddenly swinging his sleeve.

Smack!

The slap sent Fei Yihe stumbling back instantly, and he clutched his face and repeatedly apologized. The tall leader then turned abruptly, full of rage, and kicked the crouching rat-faced man.

Thud.

Caught off guard, the rat-faced man was sent flying, rolling a good ten zhang away on the ground and ending up in a mess.

"Senior Brother!"

The sudden kick shocked the other disciples of the Azure Pond Sect while the clan cultivators exchanged confused glances with each other, unsure why the sect disciples were fighting among themselves. They all lowered their heads, not daring to speak.

"Senior Brother! Please, no!"

The disciples quickly came to mediate the situation. The rat-faced man, seemingly oblivious to this, dusted off his robe and said cheerfully, "Senior Brother Ning's kick is precise... just like the ancestor's style."

Senior Brother Ning, towering and fierce, stepped forward, overshadowing the rat-faced man. Grabbing his collar, he pulled him close and gritted his teeth as he threatened menacingly, "Deng Yuzhi... you better really be an idiotic troublemaker, genuinely affected by your cultivation technique! Stay this way for life, or I will show you the methods of the Yuanxing Peak if I catch you slipping!"

With that, he threw Deng Yuzhi to the ground, shook his robe, and let out a loud command.

"Let's go!"

As he walked away, his jade boots embroidered with gold threads shimmered in the light.

Senior Brother Ning looked noble and imposing. At his command, none of the Azure Pond Sect disciples dared to speak for Deng Yuzhi. They silently bowed their heads and followed him, flying back toward the city.

Deng Yuzhi lay on the ground, now covered in dust, his hair disheveled, looking utterly miserable. Everyone else pretended not to see him, hurrying to face the enemy.

"What a temper..."

Deng Yuzhi got up unhurriedly, cast a spell to dust himself off, and muttered a string of complaints. He glanced at Li Xuanfeng, who was holding his bow in contemplation, and cursed, "Useless! Such a reputation but no substance! Are you not afraid of causing trouble?!"

He then turned and leaped toward the city, leaving everyone else exchanging bewildered glances.

"Those words... seemed to have another meaning."

Li Xuanfeng watched Deng Yuzhi's departing figure and thought to himself, I seem to have seen this person before. He had a long conversation with our ancestor during the recruitment... Perhaps what just happened involves a lot of internal conflicts within the Azure Pond Sect...

He withdrew his gaze, the look in the youth's eyes as he turned back replaying in his mind. Stroking his bow, he thought to himself silently, My shot was just for show, not truly lethal. The enemy of the Azure Pond Sect is our friend... It cannot possibly hurt to save a favor.

Li Xuanfeng, now at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, had far surpassed the young Azure Pond Sect disciples in cultivation. He had yet to meet his match, especially in archery, so he naturally could deceive this group of disciples.

He slung his longbow over his back and looked at the retreating beast tide. Turning to Fei Yihe, he asked, "How are you?"

"I'm fine!" Fei Yihe quickly responded with a dismissive wave. After all, he had taken an unnecessary slap, but he had already wiped away the blood at the corner of his mouth and the red mark on his face was gradually fading.

He replied gently, "For someone in our position, taking a slap is nothing. No harm done!"

————

Eastern Mount Yue.

The grand hall of Mulu Town was resplendent with gold and jade. The dim lights flickered on the walls, casting dark shadows that leaped like demons and monsters.

Tian Zhongqing carefully put away the wooden slips in his hand. A servant rushed in and respectfully reported, "Master! The lords have once again submitted a petition to support Li Jiman's ascension... They say the agreed date is approaching and it cannot be delayed further!"

"Bring it here."

Tian Zhongqing sighed, took the petition from the servant, and began marking it with his brush.

Tian Zhongqing was temporarily in charge of matters in the Eastern Mount Yue. The dark red color used for official documents was a recent change, as they were marked with vermillion previously.

Since the main Li Family used vermillion for their official documents, the Clan Affairs Courtyard used a slightly darker shade to signify their subordinate status. Shamoli, hearing this, had his annotations changed to an even darker red—a tradition that continued to this day.

"Tell them to revise these inappropriate phrases and resubmit in a few days!"

Finding an excuse to dismiss them, Tian Zhongqing felt a chill run down his spine.

"It is not me holding you back... It is the will of the main family... How can we let Li Jiman ascend without eliminating a batch of wastrels first?"

He sighed inwardly, gazing at the grand hall. The opulent decorations gleamed gold, tempting his senses. He had been acting as the temporary ruler for over half a year and was almost becoming fond of this high position.

The flickering lights in the inner hall bathed the jade and gold artifacts in a soft and comforting glow. This grand hall was once the palace of Mu Jiaoman, so it was magnificently built. When it passed to Qimu, much of the extravagance was reduced.

Later, Li Feiruo launched a coup, and the Li Family's carriage entered the palace, staining the palace steps with blood as the peers slaughtered the royal family to curry favor with the Li Family.

"The wheel of fortune turns... Soon, the blood of these wastrels will be spilled..."

Dazed by the sight of the golden red, Tian Zhongqing was jolted awake, shaking off those thoughts hurriedly. Suddenly, he heard a clang from outside the hall as a burly man entered.

The man, eight chi tall with thick eyebrows and a robust build, held a giant mace in his hand. He looked like a bandit ready to crush Tian Zhongqing with his weapon.

Tian Zhongqing quickly jumped down from his seat and hurried to greet him with a smile, "Brother Wen! What brings you here? Is the family head here too?"

"Uncle Tian, you have misunderstood."

Despite his fierce appearance, Li Wen had a gentle disposition and replied in a low voice, "The Jade Court Guards have already been deployed throughout the city. The family head said it is time to close the net, so he sent me to oversee things."

"Good, good, good!" Tian Zhongqing laughed obsequiously and asked, "Brother Wen, does the family head have any other instructions?"

Li Wen nodded and replied, "The family head has agreed. If this matter is resolved, the Tian Family's descendants can return to the twelve towns."

"That's great!" Tian Zhongqing responded, clearly overjoyed. Ever since the Tian Family was sent to Eastern Mount Yue to control the situation, they had been increasingly looked down upon by the people of the East, who saw them as allies of Mount Yue. This disdain was particularly hard to bear in a society that revered the East.

In the Eastern Mount Yue, the Tian Family had a high status, but in Lijing Town, they were treated as inferiors. Despite having two Qi Cultivators, they lacked the backing of the main family and were often looked down upon in secret.

His eldest son had once gone to Lijing Town and, not knowing the local drinking games, was mocked and came back depressed for three months, causing Tian Zhongqing to sigh deeply.

Moreover, being far from the main family in the Eastern Mount Yue, and being the most powerful among the external families, Tian Zhongqing felt like he was walking on a tightrope every day, constantly on edge.

Now, with Li Yuanping's promise, he was overjoyed. All the frustrations of offending Li Jiman and the lords by acting as Li's enforcer dissipated. He thought coldly to himself, I was worried about how to establish myself in Eastern Mount Yue, but now… let's kill! Let heads roll. I'll just wipe my hands clean and leave! Who cares about a few local tyrants?

He immediately gave the order, and the soldiers in the palace began to move. The clanging of weapons resounded, and the palace gates swung open. Carriages and horses drove out right away, riding on the newly built roads.

Rumble…

The noise echoed like thunder between the streets, waking the residents of Mount Yue from their sleep, leaving them bewildered and unsure of what was happening.

————

In another corner of Mulu Town, there was a lively banquet with songs and laughter. Li Jiman sat at the head of the table with a sour expression, watching the lords sing loudly, feeling frustrated.

"Barbarians... What rubbish is this?"

There was no drinking game, pitch-pot, or poetry competition; all the tricks Li Jiman had learned were useless here. They just sang songs and gulped down wine, making him very uncomfortable.

As he was lost in his thoughts, a drunken lord staggered up to him, grinning and slurring, "Great King… do you not think Li Yuanping always looks so pale, as if he is at death's door? Does that not suggest a change might be coming?"

Li Jiman's expression changed abruptly. He was familiar with the main family and often took pride in it. He was also deeply grateful to Li Yuanping for sparing him and held him in the highest respect. How could he possibly tolerate such talk?

Moreover, he vividly remembered how the Tian Family had exploited him. Fear and anger surged within him all of a sudden.

"Hmph!"

Li Jiman threw his cup at the man's face, smashing it and causing him to fall with a thud, blood streaming down his face. Li Jiman cursed, "You scoundrel!"

The hall fell silent. Li Jiman quickly stood up, as if explaining to someone, and shouted, "That is the majesty of a tiger feigning illness, an eagle seeming to sleep! How could lowly people like you understand?!"

As soon as he had finished speaking, everyone fell to their knees. Even the music stopped, and the hall became so silent one could almost hear a pin drop. Li Jiman strained his ears and felt a chill run down his spine instantly.

"Why do I hear the sound of weapons clashing...?"

As he spoke, the people below looked at each other in confusion. Suddenly, a scream pierced through the air.

BANG!

A group of soldiers in white armor burst through the door, wielding weapons with stern expressions. They filed in, ignoring the lords' protests. Some even jumped up, shouting, "Who are you? Do you know where you are?! How dare you act so brazenly here?!"

However, the white-armored soldiers ignored the demands of the lords and simply continued barging through the crowd. Those with cultivation tried to resist but were quickly subdued by the leader. Watching his allies being taken away, Li Jiman stood in shock, unable to believe what was happening.

"Jade Court Guards..?" he murmured in disbelief.

The hall was filled with the sounds of subdued grunts and pleas for mercy. Before Li Jiman could ask further questions, the captives were already being marched out. He stood there, dumbfounded, suddenly left all alone.

The leader of the Jade Court Guards showed a bit of courtesy, lightly cupping his fist in salute.

"Apologies, young master."

"This is..." Li Jiman stammered, feeling as if he had been stripped of everything he owned in broad daylight, taking several moments to find his words.

The leader of the Jade Court Guards respectfully cupped his fist again, his eyes bright as he gestured for his men to withdraw, leaving only two behind. Only then did he explain, "Young master, the Tian Family submitted a cartload of evidence to the Clan Affairs Courtyard, and it implicated many clans in Mount Yue. I am here under orders to arrest them."

"The Tian Family?!"

Li Jiman snapped to attention right away, realizing why the main family had suddenly become so ruthless. His eyes reddened, and he ground his teeth in anger.

"It seems the Tian Family has been plotting this for years, planning to wipe out my followers and turn me into a puppet!" he fumed.

"With the Tian Family controlling Mount Yue unchallenged by the lords, they will become a major threat! This must not happen, Family Head!" he yelled.

Li Jiman, grabbing his robe, hurried closer. The Jade Court Guard, noting his urgency, hesitated and then whispered, "This is indeed an extreme measure. Brother, perhaps you should plead with the family head directly. It is said he intends to recall the Tian Family, but they have persistently refused, spreading slander to remain in Mount Yue."

"Ah! Thank you, brother!" Li Jiman exclaimed, hearing this for the first time. Elated, his face flushed with excitement as he resolved, "Yes… if the Tian Family leaves Mount Yue and returns to the towns, everything will be resolved! I must persuade the family head to make them withdraw!"

Having studied governance for over a decade, he was determined not to be a mere puppet. He hurriedly put on his shoes, ready to rush out of the hall.

The Jade Court Guard, seeing his urgency, hesitated before offering a final piece of advice, "Brother, I have heard the family head has long been troubled by the lack of spirit resources from Mount Yue… He has sent us to investigate many times. If you have any insights, this could be a way to appeal to him!"

Li Jiman's eyes lit up instantly at this timely information. Nodding vigorously, he rushed out but then stopped and turned back.

"Brother, you have helped me greatly today… May I know your name?"

The Jade Court Guard chuckled and replied, "I am Chen Mufeng, I just returned from the market a few days ago. I will need your support in the future, young master."

"Chen Mufeng…" Li Jiman repeated the name, committing it to memory. He thanked Chen Mufeng quickly before rushing out.
