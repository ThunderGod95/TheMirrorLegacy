# Chapter 696: The Immortal Palace Within the Mirror

The world inside the Immortal Mirror was in flux.

Clouds drifted up and down, a great sun hung high in the sky, and wisps of grey qi scattered as the vibrant lights of divine abilities began to manifest one by one.

When Li Ximing broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, the Talisman Seed immediately sent feedback into the mirror. A life-giving, spiritual ambrosia rained down, breathing vitality into the realm. The entire world seemed to awaken, bursting into a symphony of brilliant color.

Lu Jiangxian materialized in the sky. Beneath his feet lay a sprawling complex of gleaming white immortal palaces and pavilions, surrounded by shimmering lakes and ethereal mists. A few stone spirits could be seen darting between the halls, painting a picture of a true celestial domain.

'The Purple Mansion Realm… he’s finally achieved it.'

Li Ximing’s breakthrough had taken over a decade. The process of pushing his foundation into the Shengyang Acupoint had gone smoothly, and he had navigated the trial of endless oblivion with the help of the Talisman Seed. The remaining steps, however, had been fraught with peril. In Lu Jiangxian's view, luck had played no small part in his success.

Li Ximing’s Dao Heart had never been weak, and it had been tempered further by years of cultivation and countless trials. Thus, throughout the process of forging his divine ability, the greatest threat had not been the endless illusions, but the single, instantaneous moment of its conception.

Even with the *Radiant Essence Scripture*, the nine secret arts of which he had mastered three, and the aid of the Radiant Sky Stone, Li Ximing’s chances of success had been no more than fifty percent.

He himself hadn't realized it, but that fleeting moment when he successfully forged "Audience with the Celestial Gate" had been far more dangerous than he could ever imagine.

'Still, his success is a great boon… And Li Zhouwei, being in the spotlight, drew most of the danger away from him…'

Li Ximing’s breakthrough was a profound nourishment to the Immortal Mirror itself. While Lu Jiangxian could simulate various divine abilities using his Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence, it was no match for the feedback from the Talisman Seed. The moment Li Ximing succeeded, the entire mirror world was infused with the power of a divine ability.

The bright white immortal palaces, which the stone spirits had spent a century building under Lu Jiangxian’s direction, already filled the original area. Now, with a deep rumble, the ground expanded. The dark clouds on the horizon rapidly receded, and the world grew several times larger, revealing vast new lands.

Lu Jiangxian descended past the central, circular palace complex to the newly formed territory. Unlike the rolling landscapes of before, the ground here was as smooth as a mirror, a perfectly flat, unbroken plain stretching as far as the eye could see.

He pondered for a moment, and with a single thought, the world obeyed. Billowing white mists, like smoke and fog, surged from the distant horizon and swept inward, blanketing the ground completely. The entire palace complex now appeared to be floating atop a sea of clouds, shrouded in an aura of infinite mystery.

'Much better.'

Reappearing high in the sky, he formed a seal. A celestial gate materialized from thin air and descended upon the distant clouds. It was constructed of white bricks, with two corner towers adorned with seventy-two brightly decorated ridges, carved with dragons and phoenixes, and hung with flags and banners—a truly magnificent sight.

'Bright Yang: Audience with the Celestial Gate!'

He formed another seal. The sun in the sky, a manifestation of his Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence, began to shimmer with iridescent light, showering the world with countless falling stars. These stars drifted about before transforming into various Golden-Armored Heavenly Soldiers.

Most were clad in smooth armor and carried simple spirit spears, but among them were generals wielding long halberds and wearing phoenix-plumed helms, as well as massive, cloth-armored strongmen. They descended into the palace, each finding their post.

"Lord Liu…"

"Ah, General Lin!"

In an instant, the silent palace came alive with a bustling clamor—the clang of armor, the murmur of conversations, and the sound of hearty laughter and greetings. The entire celestial court seemed to be a living, breathing, and smoothly functioning entity.

And yet, it was all born from a single thought.

With a gentle wave of his hand, all the figures in the world dissolved like smoke, leaving only the empty immortal palaces and pavilions behind. Lu Jiangxian chose a hall at random and descended into it.

'Beyond the changes within the mirror, the Supreme Yin Profound Light has now surpassed the Purple Mansion level. I wonder how it compares to the Golden Core Realm… The gap between the two is immense. At best, it could probably only injure a True Monarch.'

'The range of my spiritual sense, however, hasn’t changed much.'

Lu Jiangxian sat down at a table, his mind racing with thoughts.

'First, Yang Tianya is not dead. In fact, he broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm long ago.'

This was a rather troublesome development. Yang Tianya served the Underworld, and he had personally seen Li Mutian. Cultivators gained a photographic memory after reaching Foundation Establishment, let alone the Purple Mansion Realm. Yang Tianya must have known that Li Mutian was a mere mortal.

'Yet, according to the information from Li Xizhi, Yang Tianya always referred to Li Mutian as a Foundation Establishment cultivator. That was clearly intentional.'

'At the very least, it means the Underworld bears the Li clan some goodwill. Whatever their hidden motives, they are willing to provide cover on the surface.'

But Lu Jiangxian’s discoveries went far deeper. The two emissaries from the Underworld, Wang Long and Zhang Gui—Li Ximing had noticed nothing strange, but within Lu Jiangxian’s spiritual sense, their nature was perfectly clear.

'Those two… they’re not cultivators, nor are they demons. They seem to be souls that have been influenced by Metallic Essence, then sculpted into their current form by some powerful expert…'

Lu Jiangxian had long been puzzled by something. This world had a complete system of immortals and demons, yet it completely lacked ghosts. There were plenty of ghost stories and legends, and even a power like the Underworld, which was clearly designed to manage such beings, but in a hundred years, he had not seen a single ghost.

'Combined with what Dingjiao said, this must be a consequence of the celestial shift. The rules changed, affecting even True Monarchs and Immortals, to the point where the world can no longer even form ghosts.'

Understanding dawned in Lu Jiangxian’s mind.

'But the Fruition Attainment of the Underworld is likely tied to ghosts. If that’s the case… does it also mean that the Underworld, the power that presides over ghosts and spirits, has been weakened to an extreme degree since the shift?'

The only time the Li family had encountered anything resembling a ghost was when a disciple from Mount Wu had summoned them with shamanic arts. And even then, those green-faced, tusked creatures were more like puppets of shamanic arts than true spirits.

Lu Jiangxian had studied this phenomenon carefully. When mortals in this world died, their bodies immediately became empty shells. There was no process of a soul dissipating; nothing was left behind but lingering resentment and baleful energy, which could be used to refine treasures.

If one had cultivation and reached Embryonic Breathing, their death would appear normal to the untrained eye, but Lu Jiangxian could perceive their soul leaving the body and scattering into nothingness.

But here was the strange part: once a cultivator of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao reached the Qi Refining or Foundation Establishment realms, their soul would be extinguished instantly upon death, leaving no trace. Only after forging a divine ability and pushing their Shengyang Acupoint into the Great Void could their soul truly persist after death.

None of these ephemeral states were as stable as the Underworld’s emissaries. Lu Jiangxian was astonished by what he saw.

'This method uses Metallic Essence as a vessel for the soul. If I could master it, I could let beings like Dangjiang out of the mirror!'

He made a mental note of it.

'The Li family may have more contact with the Yang family in the future. I'll have to wait and see.'

Lost in thought, Lu Jiangxian clapped his hands lightly, and the bustling sounds of the celestial court once again filled the world. He gazed down at the puppet show he had created, an idea stirring in his mind.

'The mirror world has truly changed. There is so much more I can do now… And with such a fine place at my disposal… I can’t just let Dangjiang sit around in my pocket. Such a good laborer should be put to use.'

Riding a streak of light, he instantly appeared in a palace beside the main hall. Feeling a slight headache, he considered his options.

'What was the title I made up for Dangjiang back then… Since I gave him a title related to the Supreme Yin, this palace must reflect that.'

With a thought, the hall instantly transformed. The power of the Supreme Yin surged forth, and patterns of moon laurels and golden cassia blossoms appeared everywhere. The lunar sigil of the Supreme Yin was carved before and behind the hall, and several jade lamps as large as tables began to glow with the light of the full moon.

A cold snow began to fall, piling up in pristine white drifts. Small statues of toads and jade rabbits appeared throughout the hall, making it feel like a true moon palace. Lu Jiangxian surveyed his work, then summoned a plaque above the entrance.

*The Saintly Palace of the Supreme Yin's Luminous and Primordial Purity*

The silver-white characters, though similar in color to the jade-white plaque, were utterly captivating. He looked from side to side, feeling something was still missing. With a flick of his finger, a ray of Supreme Yin moonlight landed on the floor.

White gravel flew from the corners of the room, merging with the moonlight to form a man in silver armor. Lu Jiangxian adjusted the face several times before settling on one that resembled Li Xijun, giving him the dignified air of an immortal general.

With a thought, the silver-armored man immediately bowed deeply.

"The Supreme Yin's Luminous Immortal General, Zhengao, pays his respects to the Palace Lord!"

Lu Jiangxian looked him over from every angle and nodded in satisfaction. The man was, of course, just another one of his puppets, but he would be more than enough to fool Dangjiang.

Returning to the main throne, Lu Jiangxian’s robes shifted and changed. He flicked his finger again, and a pale, turquoise light landed on the floor, coalescing into the form of a young boy.

The boy wore archaic robes, his sleeves embroidered with wave patterns. His eyes were a pale turquoise, and his face was round, making him look no older than a teenager. He appeared somewhat dazed, looking around until he spotted Lu Jiangxian on the throne above. He immediately fell to his knees in a panic.

"Dangjiang pays his respects to the Palace Lord."

For Dangjiang, it had been the blink of an eye. One moment he was in Anhuai Heaven, the next he was here. He had no idea how much time had passed, but looking at the magnificent decorations, he knew this was an immortal palace without a doubt. A sense of relief washed over him.

'That fool Chi Buzi, so shallow and ignorant… going on about how the immortal palaces were shattered… All nonsense. He acts so certain in private, but if he saw the Palace Lord, he’d be kneeling faster than anyone!'

Even as he calmed himself, a current of anxiety ran through him. According to what the Palace Lord had said before, he had escaped from the palace by accident. But Dangjiang’s mind was a blur; he had no memory of it. This was a crime in itself, how could he not be afraid?

Seated on his throne, Lu Jiangxian was still considering what tasks he could assign this fellow. He spoke casually, "This is not a place you should be. Since you escaped by accident, you will wait in the palace for now."

Dangjiang let out a sigh of relief. Before he could utter a word of thanks, Lu Jiangxian vanished. Dumbfounded, Dangjiang meekly backed out of the hall. The moment he stepped outside, he saw a man in silver armor standing there.

The man was handsome, with sharply defined cheeks and silver pupils. He stood holding a long spear, looking down at him. Dangjiang hurriedly bowed.

"Greetings, Immortal General! This humble official is Dangjiang, attendant of the River Stream Manor! Might I ask the Immortal General's…"

The silver-armored man simply said, "I am but a minor general of this palace. It is not worth mentioning… Please."

Dangjiang quickly agreed. As he walked through the palace, he glanced up for a moment and his eyes fell upon the words *The Saintly Palace of the Supreme Yin's Luminous and Primordial Purity*. He felt a sharp sting, as if pierced by a needle, and quickly looked away, his heart filled with emotion.

'I, your old man, have now been to an immortal palace… When I go back to preside over my river manor in the lower realm, I'll have endless stories to tell… Chi Buzi? Just a minor cultivator! How could he possibly compare to me?'

Although Dangjiang had many memories, Lu Jiangxian had deliberately made them vague to leave room for future changes. His only clear memories were from his years with Chi Buzi, so he couldn't help but compare himself to the cultivator in private.

He was soon led to a corner of the vast and complex residence. Along the way, he saw many people coming and going. Several immortal generals and officials all bowed their heads in greeting to the silver-armored man. Dangjiang was a perceptive sort and immediately understood that the man before him was no ordinary figure.

'That makes sense. Anyone who can wait outside the Palace Lord’s main hall is no common immortal general…'

His expression became even more respectful. He was led to a small side room, but he didn't find it strange at all.

'I'm just a minor river official from the mortal world. What status could I possibly have in the heavens? It's only because the Palace Lord brought me here personally that I'm even allowed to stay in this palace.'

The silver-armored man led him into the room. His stern gaze fell upon Dangjiang as he spoke in a deep voice, "Friend Dangjiang, you may stay here for the time being. However, there are a few rules I must explain to you."

Dangjiang nodded repeatedly. The silver-armored man continued, "The immortal prohibitions are currently active throughout the celestial palace. No one is permitted to enter or leave any of the palaces or manors. If you become terribly bored, you may wander around this palace, but do not speak to too many people, and certainly do not step outside the main gate."

Lu Jiangxian was simply too lazy to create other immortal palaces and just wanted to keep the fellow confined here, but Dangjiang had a sudden realization and nodded thoughtfully.

The silver-armored man pointed to a cabinet in the room and said coldly, "But you will not be staying here for free. This cabinet contains numerous manuals—old techniques or arts confiscated from heretical paths. Immortal Official Li has descended to the mortal realm, so you will temporarily fill his position. Your task is to rewrite and expand upon these techniques. Someone will come to collect them annually."

"This subordinate obeys!"

Dangjiang was quick to fall into his new role, his mind already spinning with possibilities, his heart surging with excitement.

'If I perform my duties well, perhaps I can even be transferred to a position in the heavens…'

Seeing his enthusiasm, the silver-armored man finally showed a hint of a smile. As he was about to close the door and leave, Dangjiang quickly called out to him respectfully, "Might I ask the Immortal General's esteemed name?"

Zhengao’s voice rang out, "Zhengao, holder of the rank of Supreme Yin's Luminous Immortal General."

The string of titles stunned Dangjiang, and he looked at the general with even greater reverence. He escorted him all the way out, passing several other immortal officials who ignored him completely, greeting only Zhengao.

Dangjiang knew his own status was insignificant and paid it no mind. He hurried back to his room, his face beaming with joy. He looked around, touching this and that, feeling that everything in the heavens was superior.

"My, my, this Supreme Yin pattern is the real deal…"

He finally made his way to the small cabinet. After admiring its noble carvings, he opened it with great care. He was met with a loud clatter as a cascade of jade slips tumbled out, clinking and clanking as they scattered across the floor, nearly covering it entirely.

Dangjiang stood frozen, staring at the cabinet, which was barely larger than his own body. He couldn't help but curse inwardly.

'So damn many?! What in the world was that Immortal Official Li doing? He probably descended to the mortal realm to escape his deadlines! Right, right! That plague-ridden bastard must be the laziest immortal official in existence!'

He picked up a single jade slip from the floor. Reading it carefully, he estimated its contents would fill three large chests with books. A bitter expression immediately formed on his face.

'Immortal Official Li must have been on strike for decades… Even a donkey isn't worked this hard…'
