# Chapter 1244: Dispelling the Disaster

‘【The Emperor embodies Heaven and mirrors Earth, selecting the worthy through ranks and steps, bestowing office upon the virtuous through merit. Thus, the noble and the humble are defined, and the world is eternally bright.】’

‘【These are the Eternal Brightness Steps】. ’

The radiant, multicolored scenery slowly faded from his eyes. The figure from that year, clad in golden robes and holding an immortal decree, dissipated like the wind. The five-colored heavenly glow suspended in the sky finally dissolved into illusion. The man slowly rose to his feet, a clear light in his eyes.

Cui Jueyin had never actually considered his own path to the Purple Mansion Realm. Back when he was sent to Moongaze Lake, he had even believed himself to be a pawn sacrificed by his family. He had simply been diligent and devoted to his duties. Later, as the situation gradually clarified, it was only at the moment he entered seclusion that he came to a realization:

‘So I truly am to attain a divine ability…’

Thus, his boundless visions were filled with blood and tears, with every scene born from dread. Yet, just as when he served on the lake years ago—able to act as a minor envoy, able to act as the master of the Milin Mountains—these visions, while clarifying the fears in his heart, paradoxically rendered him fearless.

‘Right and wrong, kindness and grievance—my heart is clear on them all. I will advance without retreat, and face death without regret!’

A cold, decisive look finally entered Cui Jueyin's usually gentle expression. Stepping out of the secret chamber, this direct descendant of the Cui family acted without any further hesitation, gazing calmly toward the horizon.

Above the white clouds, layers of heavenly light overlapped, resembling celestial steps of pure white snow ascending along the sky. Veiled within the clouds was a faint mountain range, like some sacred symbol hanging high in the heavens.

This was the transcendent phenomenon of Cui Jueyin's attainment of the Dao.

"What a magnificent celestial vision of heavenly steps!"

After a quiet glance, he trod upon the light and descended, landing on the mountain's peak. Inside the main hall, besides the two familiar elders, there was also a great demon with a ferocious expression.

‘Mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm…’

When Lu Xu saw him, his expression softened considerably. He did not say much, merely clasping his hands and stating flatly:

“I am Lu Xu of Xu Water. Congratulations, Daoist Friend!”

Hearing the words "Daoist Friend" made Cui Changfu inwardly click his tongue in astonishment. The young man, however, stepped down from the light without showing much surprise and returned the courtesy politely:

"This junior is unworthy… I have kept the Demon King waiting!"

In his heart, Lu Xu believed that on the whole of Chongzhou Island, only the man before him was his equal. He nodded amicably, strode inside, and the nearby Huiyao, seeing his chance, chose his moment to ingratiatingly say:

“Congratulations, Daoist Master, felicitations, Daoist Master… I can now report the good news to King Wei!”

He had relied on his connection with the Li family to rise smoothly through the ranks, obtaining a fine position as a sea patrol. While keeping an eye on the Cui family, he also managed a large swath of the sea, so he was naturally friendly toward Cui Jueyin. Cui Jueyin nodded in turn and smiled:

“Thank you for looking after my family all these years, Patrolman…”

Lu Xu watched on nonchalantly and said:

“I have come to this island for two reasons. First, to offer my congratulations, Daoist Friend, and second… to discuss a matter of importance.”

As he took his seat, he flipped his sleeve and set a jade box on the table, to which Cui Jueyin offered the usual pleasantries before the Demon King casually said:

"This is a gift from His Highness Dingjiao. There is no need for ceremony with me."

Cui Jueyin had no choice but to quietly accept it. Once this Demon King sat down in the hall, he actually had Cui Changfu move to the side, acting as if Cui Jueyin were the master of the house. The young man understood his intent and said politely:

“If it is a matter concerning Chongzhou, you must ask a Daoist Master of the Cui clan. If it is a matter concerning King Wei, then please, Demon King, speak in detail.”

At these words, Cui Changfu sighed heavily in his heart. He understood the young man’s meaning and remained silent. Lu Xu, however, pinched the jade cup in his hand, his expression placid, but his tone held a strange note:

“Why does Daoist Friend say such a thing?”

Cui Jueyin lowered his gaze:

“Jueyin is a cultivator of Moongaze Lake; my grievances and loyalties do not extend to Chongzhou.”

As the conversation touched upon his mission, Lu Xu’s expression visibly changed. The veneer of politeness vanished as he said flatly:

“I was ordered to Chongzhou to find Daoist Friend Cui, not a cultivator from Moongaze Lake.”

Cui Jueyin smiled and said:

“In that case, please discuss the details with the two of them. I shall return to the mainland to make my report.”

Lu Xu’s expression grew increasingly displeased as he said:

“If Daoist Friend refuses to listen and insists on leaving without our protection, then you can only wait for King Wei to avenge you, and to avenge Chongzhou.”

This Demon King was, after all, a demon beast, having only learned a fraction of human courtesy. Before Cui Jueyin could speak, Cui Changfu could no longer sit still. The last shred of hope in his heart finally dissipated. The old man took a step forward and forced a smile:

“Jueyin is a subject of King Wei, and my Chongzhou is also a subject of King Wei. The King’s business is Chongzhou’s business… there is no need to distinguish between the two!”

Since Cui Changfu had stepped forward, Cui Jueyin said no more, listening in silence. Lu Xu’s expression, however, improved significantly, and he stated calmly:

“My Dragon-kin have protected the Cui clan for many years. If not a debt of gratitude, there is at least a bond of friendship… Furthermore, Daoist Friend can be considered to have originated from my Eastern Sea. In the future, any exchange between the Dragon-kin and Bright Yang should fall to you. Please remember this, Daoist Friend, to avoid any misunderstandings later.”

He continued quietly:

“Second, my lord intends to build a palace for King Wei and requires the Cui clan’s assistance. I ask that your esteemed clan first send three hundred artisans into the sea to study at the Flood Dragon Palace.”

“Three hundred!”

Cui Changfu was in disbelief, momentarily stunned. Cui Jueyin also froze beside the table. How could the three hundred artisans mentioned by this Demon King be ordinary people! They had to be cultivators with cultivation bases; even those at the Embryonic Breathing stage would likely not be good enough for them…

Cui Jueyin had served on the lake and seen the wider world. Although Chongzhou had expanded and its population had grown due to the receding waters and rising thunder, it was different from the mainland where a handful of rice could grow wildly on its own. The entire population of Chongzhou was barely eight hundred thousand…

And with the scarcity of spiritual items overseas, the Cui family did not even have enough for themselves, making it impossible to share with Guest Retainers. The number of Embryonic Breathing cultivators could not compare to the thousands on the lake; all told, there were just over two hundred, and not even fifty at the Qi Refining stage…

‘Even if they hollow out all of Chongzhou, they won’t be able to satisfy their appetite!’

The Demon King before them paid no heed to their silence. Or rather, when the Dragon-kin of the Eastern Sea gave an order, they never needed to care if their subordinates could carry it out. His tone was calm as he said:

“These three hundred will cultivate in my Flood Dragon Palace. By the time King Wei’s divine ability is fully mastered, their training should be complete. I will then return to Chongzhou to mobilize eighty thousand able-bodied men for construction in the outer seas.”

When this second sentence fell, the hall was plunged into complete silence.

Compared to the previous demand for three hundred artisans, this call for eighty thousand able-bodied men seemed simple. Yet Cui Changfu had no intention of underestimating their appetite, and his heart turned to ice:

‘Today they demand eighty thousand, taking half our young and strong men in one go. Next time they can come back for another eighty thousand. Would it be so strange for the Dragon-kin to work people to death!’

‘No wonder he said he was looking for Chongzhou’s Cui Jueyin. My Chongzhou Cui clan has been completely planned for from top to bottom!’

Cui Changfu sank into wordless despair, while Cui Jueyin’s expression remained unchanged. He lowered his gaze and said:

“There has been no word from King Wei on this matter. Forgive Jueyin for being unable to agree.”

Lu Xu revealed a cold smile and said:

“That is a matter of course. You are meant to inform King Wei. Otherwise, if I were to use eighty thousand of your Cui clan’s people, why would I need to discuss it with you? As for those three hundred…”

He said quietly:

“The Dragon King has given a direct order. I am here to take them away now. Whether you agree or not, you don’t need to tell me.”

His tone was grim and sharp as a knife. Even Huiyao’s expression changed drastically. Only then did they hear a rumbling sound from the mountain beneath their feet. A massive figure had already emerged on the distant sea. The behemoth, carrying a bronze palace on its back, rose from the ocean like a small mountain, casting a colossal shadow.

Instantly, cries of alarm rose from all over the island. The grand defensive array, feeling the threat, activated on its own. Torrents of seawater poured down the crevices on the giant beast’s body, crashing against the array with thunderous splashes. Lu Xu said flatly:

“Your clan should select the people yourselves. At least you can retain some dignity.”

An utter chill gripped Cui Changfu’s heart, but he squeezed out a smile. He stepped in front of Cui Jueyin to shield him and said:

“I understand… I will go and make the arrangements now…”

He knew, of course, that an order from the Dragon-kin could not be refused. Lu Xu’s current actions were even a show of respect—it was far better for the Cui clan to choose their own than for others to seize people wantonly. At least they could preserve a few seeds for the Dao.

But Cui Jueyin, beside him, was only silent for a brief moment. His expression showed no change as he listened quietly and said:

“Since it is so, I will report everything. When the Cui family members arrive at the Flood Dragon Palace, I ask that the Demon King take good care of them.”

Lu Xu’s tone softened a few degrees, and he said darkly:

“Daoist Friend need not worry. The Dragon King also wishes to meet you. You will accompany me to the Flood Dragon Palace, and I will let you see how these three hundred people are settled, lest you think my Dragon-kin mean to harm your family!”

From the perspective of this being from Xu Water, he, a dignified Demon King of the Dragon-kin, had to speak in such a deferential tone just to conscript some people. He felt he had already shown the man before him an immense amount of face!

“Oh?”

Cui Jueyin merely smiled and said quietly:

“After you!”

With those words, he strode out. The morning sun had long since set, and the entirety of Chongzhou was shrouded in the blood-red light of dusk. Cultivators’ light trails streaked everywhere, and the faint sound of weeping could be heard, painting a scene of utter disarray.

Amidst this turmoil, Cui Changfu arrived, treading on the heavenly light. His face was slightly pale, but he still wore a smile as he said:

“The people have been assembled… they have all been sent to the Dragon Prince’s vessel… It’s just that some are still children. If they are insensible in any way, I hope the Dragon King can be magnanimous.”

Lu Xu did not even raise an eyelid:

“Mm.”

Cui Jueyin took a breath, retrieved the congratulatory gift the other had given him, and unceremoniously pushed it into Cui Changfu’s arms. Without waiting for the old man to speak, he gently pushed him away and sighed.

He just stood there. In the sky, the jade-like steps from his attainment of the Purple Mansion Realm were still arrayed across the horizon, like some ethereal decoration floating in the clouds. From behind him came Lu Xu’s flat voice:

“After you have met the Dragon King, I will personally escort you back.”

…

Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

Dense spiritual qi circulated as heavy Supreme Yin light enveloped the surroundings. The young man sat cross-legged on a stone platform. The incredibly precious Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure cast down rings of light, illuminating the Wu Light.

The three-colored profound branch had been worn away by the Supreme Yin light countless times. Although it bloomed anew each time, it was like water without a source, gradually dimming. Finally, under another round of erosion, it slowly dissipated into fluorescent specks.

There was no earth-shattering spectacle, nor was there a final counterattack; it simply scattered like a gentle breeze.

‘The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth… is finally resolved!’

After more than three full years of focused concentration, even though Li Que'wan had not needed to activate her divine ability, her face was covered in cold sweat, her eyes filled with relief:

‘The wondrous effects of this Spiritual Treasure were brought into full play. It took even less time than I estimated!’

She swept the Supreme Yin light back and forth several times before slowly retracting it. She let out a long breath, and her red lips parted slightly.

“King Wei…”

The young man before her sat cross-legged, his black robes fluttering, appearing unremarkable. Yet he seemed to be startled awake by her two words. His eyelids trembled, and he slowly opened them.

A pair of deep, golden pupils.

As his eyes opened, the layers of Supreme Yin light that had concealed him were broken. The Sun-Surging Governing Stars blazed to life between his brows, and fine, golden scale patterns appeared one by one on his face and arms. Extreme stillness turned to extreme motion. A dense pressure and the light of a blood-colored desert swept forth, instantly erupting from his body and forming the image of a massive, setting sun over a great desert behind him!

“Finally… it’s gone!”

His voice was somewhat hoarse, but it could not conceal the surging emotions within. King Wei stepped down, slowly stretching his body as if reacquainting himself with his divine ability at its peak, his eyes bright and dangerous.

‘Twelve years!’

The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth truly lived up to its name, and then some. He, Li Zhouwei, had the protection of a grotto-heaven and did not need to fear the disaster growing more terrifying, and he had been aided by Supreme Yin spiritual pills and medicines, yet it had still taken him more than twelve years!
If any other cultivator were struck head-on by this disaster, what else could they do besides promptly arrange their affairs?

“But it has been twelve years… a full twelve years!”

‘Twelve years! That’s enough time for me to cultivate a divine ability…’

In all his years of cultivation, he, Li Zhouwei, had never suffered such a loss, nor had he ever encountered such a time-consuming problem. Twelve years! How many years had it taken him to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm?

Even though a large portion of that time had not been wasted, his spiritual sense had been clouded while afflicted by the disaster. That oppressive feeling had been a detriment to his own aura. If he had not been cultivating the ‘Crimson Severing Arrowhead,’ Li Zhouwei would have found it difficult to make any progress at all!

At this moment, it was as if a flood dragon had shattered its golden chains, or a qilin had escaped the imperial garden. The oppressive aura from the disaster was finally vented, and his Perilous Tread aura returned. The presence he exuded was heavy and fraught with danger. Though it was not directed at her, it still made Li Que'wan, standing to the side, feel a chilling awe.

‘The current King Wei… is probably not much weaker than a Great Daoist Master…’

Li Zhouwei, however, just breathed quietly, savoring the hard-won relief. The dharma power of his divine ability surged within him, and white, scale-like patterns crept up his cheeks, actually emitting a crackling sound.

“Crash…”

Li Que'wan stood dazedly to the side, hearing the sound of ocean waves in her ears. King Wei had returned to his peak, his might greatly increased. The dharma power of his divine ability circulated at its apex, and the vital qi and blood in his body surged with the force of a tidal wave. He closed his eyes for a long moment, finally exhaling a plume of white qi.

The entire courtyard brightened for an instant, and his unrestrained laughter echoed:

“Success!”

The Talisman Qi in his sea of qi had been nurtured for many years, and the immortal foundation, which had been just one step away, was stimulated by this, bursting forth in brilliant light and a myriad of colors. The ‘Imperial Observation of the Origin’ immortal foundation—was now complete!
