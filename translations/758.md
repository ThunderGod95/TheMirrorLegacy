# Chapter 758: Suspicion

Lake Xian, which connected to the Eastern Sea, was technically seawater. It sparkled under the midday sun while a few demon-soldier crab-generals patrolled the surface. Their numbers were far greater than in previous years; clearly, the war between Capital immortals Dao and Profound Peak had put all nearby demons on high alert.

Into this fragile peace, the Great Void tore open.

Immense violet flames erupted, instantly vaporizing the shimmering lake, causing it to cave in under a cloud of steam. Yellow-white salt crystals flash-formed on the reefs just before the rock itself melted away. From within the flames, the Daoist Master in white-gold robes burst forth, riding his tiger.

He had only just touched the lake's surface when the Great Void directly north of him tore open again, spitting out three streaks of yellow light. Li Ximing had no choice but to forcibly wrench his direction south, fleeing toward the coast.

He had just reached the estuary where Lake Xian meets the sea when the three yellow streaks arrived. Li Ximing felt a chill shoot up his spine, sighing inwardly.

'What *is* this technique!'

In the distant Great Void, thunder boomed and True Fire flared. He could vaguely feel the oppressive, sealing power of the 'Western Heaven Plateau' closing in again from the west. Yehui was definitely approaching. Li Ximing had no time to deal with the yellow technique and veered sharply away.

'Good thing I dispelled that True Fire... I left no traces in the Great Void,' he thought frantically. 'Unfortunately, this *Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release* has locked onto my aura. Yehui probably doesn't know the fire is gone... which means... if I can just evade this technique, I can escape completely!'

The *Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release* was impossibly fast. In the span of that single thought, it was upon him. Li Ximing paused for only an instant, shuttling into the Great Void. He took several long strides through the void before the three streaks of light arrived at the spot he had just vacated.

'Just as I thought! It's only a technique. Its ability to traverse the Great Void cannot compare to me riding the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. It’s a step too slow!'

Riding the spirit tiger, he flickered in and out of existence, weaving repeatedly between the Great Void and the mortal world. Although the chasing technique could also traverse the void—and possessed a raw speed greater than his own—it completely lacked his flexibility. The constant spatial weaving forced it to slow down.

Li Ximing didn't know if Yehui could still sense his position. He focused only on maximizing the distance, racing over the open sea for the better part of fifteen minutes. Yehui himself never appeared. Only this relentless technique pursued him.

Finally, seeing his chance, Li Ximing turned and spat a concentrated gout of purple flame, fixing the yellow light in place.

He was just about to follow up with a divine ability to destroy it when the *Profound Light of the Triple Purity Release* simply dissolved like sand in the wind, leaving only a hazy yellow mist. From within it, Yehui’s voice echoed:

"I was merely acting on arrangements from Purple Smoke to spar with Daoist Friend. I meant no actual harm. My apologies for the offense; please do not hold it against me! I gained much insight from this duel. If there is a chance in the future, we should certainly spar more often!"

The voice reverberated through the Great Void. Li Ximing scanned his surroundings. Yehui was truly gone.

The flames in his hand slowly dissipated. The wounds on his Dharma Body, scorched by the artifact-fire, flared with a dull, throbbing pain.

'What in the hell is that old fox playing at?'

'Wounds from that True Fire are notoriously difficult to heal... thankfully, the injury isn't severe. It shouldn't take *too* many years to recover...'

He stared heavily at the patch of dissipated mist, silently backing away. The Geng Tiger beneath him plunged back into the Great Void, heading deeper out to sea.

He had only taken two steps when his expression suddenly tensed, his face flooding with deep suspicion and outright alarm.

'Wrong. This is wrong.'

A spar? Impossible!

'Yehui’s goal was absolutely not a friendly duel! Something is deeply wrong here!'

'Yehui must have only recently perfected "Western Heaven Plateau." It was clearly the first time he had ever displayed it to anyone; otherwise, I would have heard of it. The only reason I ended up in such a sorry state was because of that surprise ability. If it were just "Eastern Feather Mountain," how could he possibly have pushed me that hard?'

'The Capital immortals Dao lineage has been isolated for years; it's mysterious and unpredictable. What does revealing a completely unknown, top-tier divine ability represent? Surely Yehui knows the implications!'

'An ability that domineering, used as a surprise attack, could cause another Purple Mansion cultivator to suffer a massive loss, securing enormous benefits for him. Why would he waste it on a mere "duel" with me? Now that he’s revealed it to me, its strategic value as an ambush weapon is gone!'

For Yehui to expend such effort to design this entire confrontation... it could never be just a spar.

"Someone wants to force me out into the Eastern Sea! Someone wants to harm my family..."

But the instant that terrifying thought flooded his mind, Li Ximing stopped dead.

"No... no. If they wanted to harm my family, they must first deal with me. Whether I realized their plot or not, I would absolutely return home. Therefore, they must have set up an array or an ambush along my route back..."

"In fact, it's *better* for them if I realize the plot. I would rush back anxiously, distraught and careless... But it's better for me to stay out here. As long as I am free and not trapped in an array, I can ensure the family's core survival... As for the rest... sacrifices will have to be made."

Li Ximing abruptly spun the Geng Tiger around. He poured his divine ability and Dharma power frantically into the spirit artifact, pushing its concealment and escape powers to their absolute limit. He plunged headlong back into the Great Void, intending to race toward the deepest depths of the Eastern Sea.

Yet, only an instant later, his paranoia hit another agonizing peak. He stopped again.

'Wrong. I am not an ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator. Any array on the path back... I can detect it with the Immortal Mirror! I *can* go back. They cannot ambush me.'

His body reacted faster than his mind. He wrenched the Geng Tiger to a halt and spun around again, flying back west toward the continent. His power circulation was so violent that the tiger's eyes blazed with an intense white light. The Dharma patterns of the Geng Tiger Dao swirled rapidly across its stone body, dragging a long, white afterimage through the void.

Li Ximing pointed himself west. Halfway through the mental prayer for protection, he stopped dead.

The light faded completely from the Geng Tiger. It froze in place, standing utterly alone in the pitch-black Great Void.

Far ahead, a figure was striding toward him.

The man walked as if strolling through a peaceful courtyard, yet his speed through the Great Void was even faster than Yehui's. Everywhere he passed, the oppressive darkness brightened. He was a moving source of illumination. In the single instant Li Ximing had stopped, the figure vanished from the distance and reappeared directly before him.

Li Ximing felt that tyrannical, overwhelming aura flood the void. It felt like cold snow being pressed directly against his heart, and he shivered.

'West or east... it doesn't matter anymore,' he thought, despair settling in. 'He came to take it himself. What a way to come and take it.'

He looked up.

The man wore a yellow-white feather cloak. Each individual feather was etched with small, circular patterns, making them look almost like scales. Beneath it, he wore a bright white robe. A sword was strapped to his back.

His visible fingers were pale, holding a twelve-sided, glass-bodied, copper-based lantern. It emitted a soft, pale-yellow light that illuminated the surroundings.

The Daoist Master's features were, on the surface, kind and gentle. He had a high-bridged nose and broad cheeks, projecting an aura of scholarly refinement. But he also possessed a pair of willow-leaf eyes, and these added a chilling majesty that struck cold fear deep into the heart.

He raised an eyebrow, looking over at Li Ximing with that same mild warmth.

Li Ximing, however, felt the chill rush from his heart straight to his brain. The agonizing pain from his scorched Dharma Body flared anew. He forced his expression to remain neutral.

"A late-stage Purple Mansion Grand Cultivator. Changxiao!"
