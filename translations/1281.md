# Chapter 1281: The Hidden Stratagem

The moonlight was bright.

Clear, translucent moonlight pierced into the hall from outside. As time passed, it crept slowly upward. Xiao Chuting had already removed the straw rain cape and hat he always wore, revealing his bound white hair. His forehead was pressed tightly to the ground, and he remained silent.

He held the green bamboo hat to his chest, cradled in his arms. The newly woven bamboo leaves along its edge shone with a deep green light in the moonlight.

At the head of the great hall, the long-vacant main seat had been swallowed by the shifting moonlight, leaving a patch of brilliant white. A man leaned against the seat, his jade-like fingers tapping a light, rhythmic beat on the armrest, betraying his hesitation.

'Xiao Chuting…'

Xiao Chuting had relied on nothing more than the meager resources left by his forebears, maneuvering between the Golden Oneness and Azure Pond Sects. He had grown from a minor Alchemist of a desolate family to the master of Cangzhou, a peerless expert at the perfection of divine ability, and now, he even had a chance at verifying the Dao…

Cunning, Dao-Profundity, fortune, and timing—not one could be lacking.

Lu Jiangxian quietly watched him.

'But the timing isn't clear enough, and his fortune isn't deep enough.'

The moment this Daoist Master Xiao had stepped foot on Moongaze Lake, Lu Jiangxian had taken notice of him. He had also heard every word the two Daoist Masters spoke within the great hall with perfect clarity.

'How much of it is true… and how much is false.'

Just like Li Zhouwei, Lu Jiangxian understood one thing:

'The question is, why did the various Golden Cores allow him to come here.'

The white-robed immortal silently gazed at him.

'Xiao Chuting's meaning is that from the dragon's perspective, they need someone from the lake to act. To help him attain the Pit Water position, giving the Dragon-kin a chance to slay the Pit Water True Monarch.'

But in the eyes of the world, who was he, Lu Jiangxian? Xuan'an! A Xuan'an who had already handed over a Supreme Yin treasure and bowed his head in collusion!

"That must be why they were willing to let Xiao Chuting come!"

His gaze was profound as he lightly raised a hand.

A swathe of cold moonlight shone down, pouring over the old man. Scenes began to flow forth one by one: rolling, leaping alchemical flames; a profound mountain suffused with radiant light; a ten-thousand-zhang glacier; the state of Pit Water…

All these scenes converged, finally freezing at a single point in time.

A sky filled with driving snow and endless profound ice. In Xiao Chuting's memory, a vast radiance converged above the horizon, the scene astonishingly bright. Amidst all that light stood a solitary figure.

The person was slender, draped in a feathered robe with profound patterns like rippling water, giving off an androgynous air. Their long hair cascaded like a waterfall. All their features were unremarkable, save for an object one or two fingers' width hanging at their waist. Xiao Chuting did not dare look too closely, and so his vision of it was hazy and indistinct.

Most importantly, the person's face was a complete blur.

A True Monarch.

'Xuan Cang.'

'The True Monarch of the Northern Sea's Profound Mansion, Deepener of Fate.'

Every memory related to this True Monarch had been condensed into a mass and wiped blank, leaving only this single scene.

Lu Jiangxian gazed at Him.

This was the first time Lu Jiangxian had seen the mortal form of a True Monarch of the current age. He wanted to capture even the faintest wisp of an aura from the fragment of memory, but his efforts were in vain.

'He is extremely cautious, leaving not a single trace behind.'

'Who is He guarding against? The Dragon-kin? Luoxia?'

Xiao Chuting's words were not entirely without possibility, of course. This True Monarch Xuan Cang was, after all, grievously wounded and on the verge of death. 

Even when meeting Xiao Chuting, he would have had to lock his aura away completely to prevent the Dragon-kin from prying…

'But what if I think about it differently? He didn't reveal even a hint of his miraculous nature, not even his golden position could be seen. Who is He afraid will recognize Him? The Yue Cultivating Sect? Pristine Water?'

'Or… me?'

He could only watch quietly as the various scenes shifted, but he gained little from it. Then, the snow-filled sky was reflected in his eyes, and a young man's voice slowly drifted over:

'Those on the mountain will not be pleased to see the orthodox position of Water Virtue claimed by a master…'

The scene finally coalesced into the moon-drenched main seat in the great hall. A strange light gradually entered Lu Jiangxian's eyes. In truth, Xiao Chuting's story was perfectly coherent; even Li Zhouwei would have struggled to find a flaw in that moment. But Lu Jiangxian knew many more details, and he could now sense that something was wrong.

'There's one thing… Xiao Chuting must have been deceived.'

'From the perspective of his future path of Dao attainment, he should not be seeking the Pit Water Fruition Attainment.'

Back when Xiao Chuting had sent the Secret Method of the Submerged Flood Dragon Seeking Transformation to the lake, Lu Jiangxian had assumed he was seeking 'Mansion Water.' Although he now understood the full story, his judgment had not changed.

'The Pit Water Auxiliary Position is still his best choice.'

He had thought at the time that the Auxiliary Position also presented obstacles. Now he knew it was due to the 'Pit Water Overflowing and Merging,' but Lu Jiangxian had also calculated that Xuan Cang's so-called borrowing of the Vast Ocean to give him a chance at Dao attainment would not be as easy as he imagined.

The Vast Ocean was to be borrowed, not to vanish. The failure of the Secret Method of the Submerged Flood Dragon Seeking Transformation showed that Mansion Water and Vast Ocean were already on divergent paths. This, in fact, proved that even if it were borrowed, a deep influence between Pit Water and Vast Ocean would remain that could not be easily dispelled—it might even be impossible to borrow it at all!

This was also the source of Xiao Chuting's doubt. He appeared calm on the surface, but Lu Jiangxian knew it was Chen Yin's failure that had instilled such apprehension in him, leaving him half in belief and half in doubt.

'But personal factors are just as significant in a divine ability breakthrough. Xiao Chuting cannot determine if it was due to Chen Yin's own inadequacy or a lingering influence between the two… he has neither the opportunity nor the possibility to try again.'

'Even knowing this isn't good news, he has no choice but to believe unconditionally. There is no other path for him.'

In truth, once the Vast Ocean departed, the path that opened up was not only for the Fruition Attainment, but also for the Auxiliary Position!

The Pit Water Auxiliary Position would also briefly return to normal!

'The Fruition Attainment requires completeness. As long as the 'Vast Ocean' is merely borrowed and not returned, its influence remains, and this influence prevents Xiao Chuting from being complete! The Auxiliary Position, on the other hand, does not have such stringent requirements; it allows for a degree of incompleteness! What's more, the primary position favors the auxiliary!'

If Xiao Chuting were to attain the auxiliary position, the threat he posed to the Dragon-kin would be greatly diminished. Still, Lu Jiangxian estimated that given the Dragon-kin's disposition, their motive to kill him would not lessen by much. His other enemies, however, were a different matter…

'That Nian Yi said Luoxia abhors a master of the orthodox position. But this is an auxiliary to the orthodox position, which would also vex the Dragon-kin. It's quite possible they would have an interest in protecting him.'

More importantly, should the Vast Ocean one day return to the Mansion Water, Xiao Chuting could even leverage this to claim the primary position!

'This way, Xiao Chuting would certainly want the Vast Ocean to return, but he would not be in a rush for it. He would neither defy Xuan Cang's will nor overtly offend the world's various powers, and he would even preserve a path of radiance for himself.'

This point was not difficult to grasp. Lu Jiangxian refused to believe Xuan Cang had not thought of it. He was simply unwilling. He wanted Xiao Chuting to attain the primary position, which would surely lead to his death and ultimately only serve to nourish the Dragon-kin.

'Xuan Cang… what exactly are you plotting…'

Lu Jiangxian mused aloud:

"He only seeks concealment."

Setting aside the True Monarch's intentions, Xiao Chuting's own meaning was quite clear.

In his current predicament, he could not possibly cultivate another divine ability and consider a different path. Xiao Chuting had no backer and was relying purely on the grand tide of events for this one chance. With so many eyes watching from above Badger Prefecture, he could only attain the Pit Water Fruition Attainment!

'The moment he entertains any other ideas, death will come for him faster than Dao attainment!'

His intention, then, was plain to see:

'He knows that my lake possesses Supreme Yin methods, a technique of profound concealment. He hopes that after he is killed by the True Dragons, this power can help him retreat back into his Fruition Attainment. Whether to recuperate or just barely survive… it would still be a chance to live…'

'This way, the Dragon-kin will slay the Pit Water True Monarch on the spot right after his Dao attainment. The cosmic phenomena will align, their goal will be achieved, and naturally, no one will suspect a thing…'

Lu Jiangxian stood with his hands clasped behind him, staring intently at the man.

'And what of the other True Monarchs? Will they use this as an opportunity to probe whether the lake still possesses the power of Supreme Yin?'

For Lu Jiangxian, this was not a difficult act. There was not even a risk of being detected. It was a deal with guaranteed returns.

"It is merely a matter of recording his name!"

To have one's True Spirit reflected within a Supreme Yin Immortal Artifact was the highest form of profound concealment—so exquisite that even the True Monarchs of the outside world would be unable to detect it!

After recording his name, whether or not he could be saved was a separate issue. The important thing was, as long as Xiao Chuting succeeded, Lu Jiangxian would essentially gain a free opportunity to assail the Golden Core realm!

'Even if the Name Ascending Stone is inferior to a Talisman Seed, as long as he becomes a True Monarch, I will obtain ten or twenty percent of the benefit. That is a great boon… to say nothing of having a Pit Water True Monarch recorded on the Name Ascending Stone!'

Furthermore, if Xiao Chuting succeeded and managed to survive, even if just barely, Lu Jiangxian would have a major trump card in his hand!

'Of course, if the Dragon-kin were truly not deceiving him and were willing to coexist in peace, that would be for the best…'

This was an orthodox True Monarch of Water Virtue. By relying on his connection to Him through the Name Ascending Stone, Lu Jiangxian suspected it would not be an exaggeration to say he could obtain a portion of the Pit Water True Monarch's power!

"The only regret is that his chances of success are far too low. It must be so… if he fails, I lose nothing… just a Daoist Master at the perfection of divine ability."

He sighed faintly. The white light in his hand surged continuously, casting its glow upon the man. Lu Jiangxian slowly closed his eyes as if sensing something, then stood with his hands clasped behind him, remaining silent for a long time.

On the floor, Xiao Chuting had been waiting for a long time, and his heart gradually grew dim.

'It seems the lake truly possesses no profound Supreme Yin arts…'

But for some reason, the air throughout the great hall suddenly began to stir. Xiao Chuting's heart trembled. He felt a cool moonlight drape over his body, and finally, a sense of profound mystery rushed into his mind!

It was like a clear stream pouring into his divine ability. Shock was evident in Xiao Chuting's pupils. He hastily closed his eyes to focus his mind and relaxed his body completely!

Contrary to what he had imagined, he felt nothing at all. There was only a slight coolness in his heart before the sense of profound mystery slowly faded.

The old man kept his eyes tightly shut, suppressing the urge to roar at the heavens. He rose to his feet, gave a deep bow, and placed the green bamboo hat back on his head. Restraining his excitement, he said in a low voice:

"This Xiao will remember Your Excellency's grace…"

Beyond his field of vision, the white-robed man stood silently before him. His gaze was frozen, and a look of profound shock was rising in his pupils.

Indeed, since making contact with Xiao Chuting, Lu Jiangxian had found no clues. He had recorded the name, thinking there was no harm in it, but he still needed to handle the loose ends. Yet, when he used the Name Ascending Stone to connect with the True Spirit and read Xiao Chuting's memories once more, he made an even more terrifying discovery.

'Incomplete.'

Under the senses of the Name Ascending Stone, there were several other discrepancies in Xiao Chuting's memories!

Lu Jiangxian was an expert in manipulating souls. Despite his previous careful inspection with his divine sense, he had noticed nothing. It was only by going through the Name Ascending Stone, starting from Xiao Chuting's very True Spirit, that the truth was revealed!

After the events at Mount Duan all those years ago, Lu Jiangxian had long since understood his limits before cultivating a Golden Core—he was not to touch Dao Embryos or Immortal Artifacts!

Only now did he realize his oversight. He stared for a long time, the moonlight essence around him drifting and undulating as the shock in his eyes became starkly apparent.

'The work of a Dao Embryo?'

Lu Jiangxian suppressed the shock in his heart, silently focused on the man's True Spirit, and carefully sensed it. At last, he noticed several anomalies within the long river of the soul's memories.

'Additions? No… Removals? That's not right either…'

These few spots were almost perfectly seamless, even giving Lu Jiangxian a faint sense of familiarity.

'It is a [Concealment].'

'Someone… has concealed several segments of his memory… The technique is so exquisite that even a True Monarch, face to face, would surely fail to notice.'

In that instant, Lu Jiangxian felt a profound shock, immediately followed by a firm resolve flooding his mind.

"This person cannot be Xuan Cang. If He had this ability, He would never be in His current predicament. This is definitely another Dao Embryo, one who made their move far earlier than all the others!"

'This doesn't seem to be a plot aimed at me…'

'A scheme within a scheme?!'

He felt a chill run down his spine.

'Is it aimed at the Dragon-kin? Or Xuan Cang?'

'Which Dao Embryo is it? Are there more than two Dao Embryos in the world?'

Lu Jiangxian was both shocked and horrified by this revelation. Once the initial shock passed, he instantly calmed himself.

'It might not be a Dao Embryo… There is another True Monarch in this world whose mastery of the Dao of [Concealment] is at the pinnacle, second only to the Supreme Yin.'

The Profound Maiden of the Eastern Sea, the long-attained True Monarch of Wondrous Transformation, the Nine Heavens Matriarch of the Profound Valley.

The Master of Valley Water!

'She is also of Water Virtue!'

A chill entered Lu Jiangxian's gaze.

'Considering motive, status, and her divine ability and Dao-Profundity, it is almost certainly Her.'

This made him freeze, and he remained silent for a long time.

'The Valley Water True Monarch.'

In fact, judging from Chi Buzi's words and the rumors circulating in the outside world, this Valley Water Matriarch's relationship with the Supreme Yin ought to be a close one. Not only were many of the traces She left in the world before attaining the Dao related to the Supreme Yin, but Valley Water itself, as the water of concealment, was intrinsically linked to it.

In Lu Jiangxian's own plans, he had considered her at least neutral, if not favorably inclined. One could even say she held goodwill.

'If She truly is connected to the Yuanfu Donghua faction that commands the Supreme Yin, then it would be perfectly natural for Her to make a move for the surviving Intercalary Position of Mansion Water… It's even possible that She was the one who guided and induced Xiao Chuting to come to Moongaze Lake.'

He could not help but marvel.

'So there was another layer to the plan! She has already planted a hidden pawn!'

Lu Jiangxian presided over this place. The Li family was not the main player in this great tide of Pit Water events, yet he could faintly sense the coming of a storm from the north. The light in his eyes grew ever brighter.

'Everyone revealing their own powers… this contest for the Pit Water Dao attainment is truly a grand spectacle!'
