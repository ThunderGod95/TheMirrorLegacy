# Chapter 684: Liaokong

Pristine Water dripped within the grand formation, which shimmered with clear light and pulses of rosy mist.

When Chi Buhua entered, the space was empty save for a single golden pagoda standing unshakable amidst the swirling light.

'That must be Liaokong.'

Chi Buhua needed only a single glance to know that Chi Zhihu, Wu Weibai, and the others were all dead. Suppressing a wave of grief, he immediately activated his ocular art, his hands framing his eyes to peer through the haze.

His technique was profound, and it allowed him to make out a shadowy figure within the rosy light. He could also see the monk inside the pagoda, whose booming voice echoed out.

"Senior! This man is treacherous! I cannot hold him! Attack now!"

Chi Buhua formed a seal, his hands glowing with the light of Pristine Water. He looked up just as Li Xizhi's figure shot toward him. The old man had barely blocked the obscuring mist when he saw, in his peripheral vision, a three-colored light screaming toward him, aimed directly at Li Yuanqin.

"You—"

This was entirely unexpected. He faintly heard the young man's voice, refined yet ice-cold. "First, I will eliminate this unfilial whelp for Lord Xuanfeng!"

"Son of a bitch."

Hearing the curse, Chi Buhua hesitated for a fraction of a second, caught between saving the boy and letting him die. He hadn't anticipated the terrifying speed of the three-colored rainbow. In an instant, it was before Li Yuanqin, aimed straight at his face.

*BOOM!*

A flash of white light flared from Li Yuanqin's body, holding for a moment before shattering like an eggshell. The golden pagoda, arriving just in time, finally caught up to the rosy light, suppressing it with a deafening, grating screech.

"That man from the Azure Pond Sect! What plague-ridden mother would bring a Qi Refinement cultivator in here!"

Liaokong clearly had no idea why Chi Buhua had brought Li Yuanqin inside, but seeing Li Xizhi try to kill him immediately told him the boy's identity was not simple. Adhering to the principle of opposing his enemy's every move, Liaokong intercepted the light, planting the pagoda firmly in front of the two men as he descended behind it.

Chi Buhua’s eyelids twitched. Li Yuanqin was covered in a cold sweat, and seeing that the young man’s fear was genuine, the old man finally spoke. "Monk," he said coldly, "help me capture him, and I will let you leave."

The Buddhist cultivators had nearly annihilated the Azure Pond Sect's main lineage at the border mountains. How could Chi Buhua feel anything but hatred? Yet he was an old man, and deep down, he still felt a sliver of grief for what had befallen the main branch. Besides, he had brought an entire retinue; victory was already assured. If Liaokong weren't a sworn enemy of the Li family—and thus a useful source of trouble for them—and if monks weren't so prone to causing unexpected complications, he might have been tempted to kill him as well.

Liaokong instantly detected the hostility in his tone. The portly monk's expression shifted, but he swallowed his anger. "Who in the world is this Qi Refinement cultivator?" he grumbled. "He's getting in the way!"

"He is Li Xizhi's blood relative," Chi Buhua answered.

Liaokong's eyes lit up. "Excellent!" he exclaimed. "A fine move, Senior. I have just the way to deal with him!"

Chi Buhua had no real need for the monk's help, but he feared Li Xizhi might fight to the death. Having a Buddhist cultivator's methods on hand could be useful. "Make it quick," he ordered.

Liaokong immediately channeled his power into the golden pagoda, which erupted in a brilliant glow. He then produced a golden pearl from his sleeve and swallowed it. A surge of spiritual qi flooded his body and he poured it all into the pagoda, which blazed like a golden sun, its light rippling like water.

'He has some skill.'

Chi Buhua felt a wave of heat wash over his face. As Liaokong focused on his technique, the three-colored rainbow slipped out from under the pagoda. The old man drew a green vase from his sleeve, infused it with the spiritual qi of Pristine Water, and tossed it into the air.

The vase flipped upside down, the flood dragon motif upon it glowing brightly. It spat out a beam of green light that drove back the swirling mist, then began to suck in spiritual qi, successfully pinning Li Xizhi's Rainbow Pierce technique in place.

Li Xizhi's second spell was already streaking through the mist. Chi Buhua locked onto it with his spiritual sense, but a flicker of movement caught his eye. The black-robed young man at his side was smiling.

"Hm?"

The old man reacted like a striking viper. The wrinkles on his face bunched together as his head snapped around at an unnatural angle. His aged eyes stabbed into Li Yuanqin. "Yuanqin? What are you doing?"

Concealed beneath his robes, Li Yuanqin's hand held a jade talisman, already glowing with infused power. "Elder," he said in a soft, gentle voice, "you gave me the formation talisman. It can seal the entrance and exit."

"Oh?"

A muscle twitched in Chi Buhua's old face as a realization struck him like lightning. 'Fubo was afraid I would save Zhihu. Afraid I would see his betrayal and fear that one day I, too, would be abandoned. So he gave the talisman to *him*.'

'I was never supposed to know. He had the talisman but didn't use it, instead revealing it to me to keep the other six outside.'

The next moment, the grand formation in the sky locked shut. Eight distinct runes lit up in the corners, sealing it from both within and without.

The old man's face turned grim. 'So what? How long can this formation hold back six cultivators? While I and Liaokong deal with Li Xizhi… how do you expect to survive?'

His mind seethed with suspicion. Without another word, he raised a hand, and a vicious wind swept toward Li Yuanqin. He would kill him with a single palm strike and take back the talisman.

But a golden light flared. The pagoda that had been hovering in the sky suddenly blazed with multicolored light and came crashing down. Caught completely off guard, Chi Buhua’s face finally twisted into a mask of horrified disbelief. "How is this possible?!"

The golden pagoda slammed into his green vase with a sickening crunch, sending it tumbling. The misty green light dissipated, and the suppressed rosy light shot out like a slippery fish, diving back into the mist.

At the same instant, a sword light that had been lying in wait erupted from the fog. A chill ran down Chi Buhua’s neck, and a cold dread washed over his back. It had to be the second three-colored rainbow he had sensed earlier.

'How…'

Of all the people who might betray him, Liaokong was the last one he would have suspected. He would have sooner believed one of the six men outside was a spy for the Si family. He had never once considered the monk.

"The Way of Emptiness had eighteen of its disciples killed by Li Xuanfeng! His sect and the Wei-Li family are mortal enemies for generations to come! He stood to gain so much by harming them… How could he possibly help Li Xizhi?!"

"Are you insane?!"

The roar died in Chi Buhua’s throat. Not only was the pagoda hurtling toward him, but the monk himself was charging forward, fists flying. But the true killing threats were the sword energy and rosy light right in front of him.

A jade stone on his body shattered, and the three-tailed feathered beast materialized once more, spewing a yellow mist that halted the sword energy. He focused all his spiritual qi into two fingers and thrust them at the rosy light behind him.

*Pfft.*

The menacing glow of light vanished with a muffled sound, transforming into a Dawn Rayfish that dove into the sea below. Chi Buhua never imagined such a demonic beast was present. He was unable to retract his technique in time. The two beams of three-colored light were already at his back. Swallowing blood, he had no choice but to retract his attack to defend himself.

"Floating Light Gathering!"

But at that critical moment, the old man's spiritual sense jolted. Li Xizhi, timing it perfectly, had struck the green vase with a spell, severing Chi Buhua’s connection to it.

It was more than just losing an artifact. The mental backlash caused him to stumble for half a step, and the screaming golden pagoda slammed squarely into him.

"Puh…"

Chi Buhua's cultivation was deep. The robes he wore managed to block the pagoda, but the force still made him spit blood. His technique was interrupted, and before he could react, the rosy light struck his arms, shattering them into a spray of Pristine Water.

The situation had reversed in an instant.

Li Xizhi had studied Chi Buhua beforehand. He knew the old man was vastly experienced, a master of powerful arts, and a direct descendant of the Chi family. His protective treasures were unknown, and the grade of his techniques was certainly far higher than his own.

Thus, his two attacks had a single purpose: to destroy the old man's arms and rob him of his ability to cast spells. With that accomplished, Liaokong's pagoda came crashing down, pinning his body.

Li Yuanqin, meanwhile, couldn't care less who lived or died. He had already scrambled away, head in his hands, and was now huddled at the far end of the formation. The aftershocks of a battle between Foundation Establishment cultivators were more than enough to kill him; even the fine spray of Pristine Water that rained down on him was agonizing. He pulled out five or six talismans, but a rainbow-colored light flashed, and he was pulled into the air.

Before him stood Li Xizhi, handsome and elegant, with gentle brows and gray eyes. Rosy light flowed around his feathered robes, giving him an extraordinary air. One of his hands was clamped tightly around the green vase, which struggled fruitlessly to escape his grasp. With his other hand, he controlled the two beams of light. He looked at Li Yuanqin with an affectionate expression and said softly, "Little Uncle."

Li Yuanqin, looking somewhat disheveled, glanced at him and mumbled, "Greetings… Peak Lord of Changtian."

***

On Green Pine Island, Ning Hejing sat silently in his hall. Before him stood a middle-aged man in rattan armor, arms crossed. Two gourds at his waist trembled slightly, as if something were struggling inside.

This man had broken through the grand formation and fought his way up the immortal peak. The Guest Elders had either been too terrified to stop him or were subdued in a few moves. Ning Hejing hadn't even had time to flee before being cornered.

Fei Luoya stood respectfully at the man's side, a jade talisman in his hand glowing faintly—the source of the grand formation's control.

Ning Hejing had long known he was no good; he had promoted the man specifically to leak information to Li Yuanqin. He showed no surprise now. He slowly closed his eyes and sighed. "Senior Lingu…"

The man before him was none other than Lingu Rao, who had accompanied Li Xuanfeng into the Great Ning Palace all those years ago.

"Scorpion Child" Lingu Rao had once been a name spoken in the same breath as Tang Shedu and Li Xuanfeng. Though he kept a low profile and was not widely famous, in the current Azure Pond Sect, he was a figure far beyond the reach of most. He had defeated and injured Ning Hejing in just over a dozen exchanges. The Foundation Establishment spirit scorpions from his gourds had already poisoned him. Now, he was just sitting on his throne, waiting to die.

"The Lingu family… colluded with the Lin clan… who saved your life. No wonder."

Lingu Rao didn't move. Knowing he couldn't escape, Ning Hejing felt black blood trickle from his lips. "With Chi Buhua and the others gone from the sect, Si Yuanli must have made his move inside as well," he said in a low voice. "Sacrificing Li Xizhi… good… very good."

"Good?" Lingu Rao chuckled softly. "From start to finish, Liaokong belonged to Li Yuanqin. Fei Luoya? You deliberately leaked information, thinking he was the messenger? No. It was always Liaokong. Fei Luoya was only here to prevent your escape."

"Impossible!" Ning Hejing scoffed. "He's a Li! What monk from the Seven Ways would side with them? To willingly become prey for his peers to extend their lifespans? A Purple Mansion cultivator must have intervened!"

"No Purple Mansion cultivator intervened in this matter," Lingu Rao said, his voice quiet. The Eastern Yue man's features were plain, but his gaze was sharp as a blade. "As for why… it was because of an inheritance Li Xuanfeng left behind: the Wrathful Dao lineage of the Qinling Temple and a Buddhist treasure."

Ning Hejing let out a ragged breath, no longer caring about such things. The smiling face of Chi Xunxiao appeared in his mind. "What of the Sect Master?" he asked weakly.

Lingu Rao seemed to just then remember the Qi Refinement Sect Master. "That does not concern you," he answered, shaking his head.

The stern, domineering mask on Ning Hejing's face finally crumbled. He lowered his head, his voice taking on a pleading tone he had never used before. "The Sect Master is benevolent, kind, and a friend to all the peaks. He has never harmed anyone. Daoist Master Buzi is still away… I beg you, Elder, for the Daoist Master's sake… spare his life."

"That does not concern you," Lingu Rao repeated.

Ning Hejing froze like a statue, slumping into his seat. He watched impassively as Fei Luoya approached him step by step. Lingu Rao turned and walked out of the hall, gazing at the brilliant rising sun in the distance.

The golden-red light illuminated his face. From the hall behind him came a heart-wrenching roar. "Chi Fubo! Chi Fubo! You fool, to trust tigers and wolves! You fool!"

Ning Hejing's voice was thick with strangled hatred, yet it still carried the tyrannical, domineering viciousness that had defined him. It echoed from the hall, through the open doors, and across the peak, lingering for a long, long time.

Lingu Rao paid it no mind, his gaze fixed on the horizon.

'Si Yuanli…'

Lingu Rao hadn't actually coordinated his attack with the Si family, but by making his move, he had forced Si Yuanli's hand. 'After all, Si Yuanli was waiting for me to act.'

As long as the Si family remained inactive, the Li and Lingu families were in increasing danger. Moongaze Lake was too remote for the Chi family's reach, so they could only target Li Xizhi. The Lingu family, however, was right on their doorstep, their power in the commandery and on the sea being stripped away piece by piece. Their situation was far more dire.

Si Yuanli was content to watch the Chi family weaken his two allies. He was waiting, letting the dull blade slowly cut away at their flesh, until they could endure it no longer.

And so today, with Li Xizhi, Li Yuanqin, and Liaokong having dealt with two major Chi family figures, Lingu Rao saw his chance and struck. Otherwise, who knew how long Si Yuanli would have waited.

'Now, our two families are the ones who struck first, making us deeply complicit. If Suiguan or Daoist Master Buzi hold a grudge in the future, the Si family won't be the sole target.'

'Whether we act or not, Si Yuanli holds all the cards.'

Lingu Rao knew this well. The longer they waited, the more their families would lose. Better to grant Si Yuanli his victory sooner rather than later. 'You have a Purple Mansion cultivator backing you, so you can sit back and watch the show, making us dance to your tune. But in thirty years… we shall see.'

He dismissed the thought and walked out with a faint smile. The morning sun bathed the sky in gold. The middle-aged man's expression brightened, his eyes showing a sense of liberated ease. He chuckled softly.

"As long as the Xiukui stands, my family will be an evergreen tree."
