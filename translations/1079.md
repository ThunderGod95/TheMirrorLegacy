# Chapter 1079: The Quest for Gold

Li Ximing knew precious little about the Quest for Gold. However, he had been at the Purple Mansion Realm for many years, and Jiangnan was the world's focal point for those seeking such attainment. He'd gleaned some knowledge. Seeing Daoist Master Diyan's current state, how could he not be horrified?

'The legends say one must possess all five methods to even attempt the Quest for Gold. But... four parts Dawn Qi and one part Bright Yang... how is that not five methods?'

A name immediately surfaced in his mind:

'Daoist Master Yuanxiu!'

'It's not that divine abilities of the Purple Mansion Realm path can't be compatible, it's just astoundingly difficult. The Shengyang Acupoint is already overflowing with power. Just cultivating the divine abilities of one's native Dao is as hard as ascending to the heavens—how could one possibly accommodate a foreign, unrelated divine ability?'

'Of course, some Dao Lineages are more closely related than others. With my own divine ability now complete, it isn't impossible for me to cultivate a Li Fire art. But doing so would mean severing my original Dao Lineage...'

Li Ximing had once considered this a dead end. Only later, when speaking with Sima Yuanli about the foregone Daoist Master Yuanxiu, did he learn the truth. Yuanxiu had tried attaining the Dao using four parts 'Upright Wood' and one part 'Gathering Wood'!'

Sima Yuanli, looking utterly forlorn at the time, had told him,

'Regarding my lord's affairs, I consulted a senior. This senior once personally visited the site of my lord's passing. He let out a sigh, saying, "Heavy Wood Weighs Down the Branch." He said my lord "Held to the orthodox while pursuing the divergent, seeking balance yet achieving imbalance." He said my lord used the Intercalary.'

Only then did he understand. Daoist Master Yuanxiu's path to the Dao lay in the 'Intercalary'—specifically, the 'Gathering Wood' occupying the Intercalary Position.

'In the eyes of a Great Daoist Master, cultivating another Dao as the final step isn't a dead end. It's a method of the Intercalary Position, something outside the standard Fruition Attainment. This Daoist Master Diyan... surely he isn't seeking the Intercalary of Bright Yang!'

His expression was fraught with shock.

'In the current climate, with Luoxia actively suppressing Bright Yang and eager for Li Qianyuan's demise... what kind of figure would one who holds the Bright Yang Intercalary Position be!'

But as Li Ximing reeled internally, the Great Daoist Master before him grew even more silent. He looked exceptionally sinister in the faint, flickering lamplight, the dark golden glow reflecting in his pupils. He seemed to be hesitating, weighing what to reveal.

Li Ximing’s shock gradually subsided, replaced by a dawning, belated suspicion. A cold doubt settled in his heart.

'How... how is that possible? How could he possibly contain two conflicting Dao Lineages?'

He paused, then finally broke the silence.

"Is it the Bright Yang Intercalary Position?"

Daoist Master Diyan scrutinized him for a moment, then chuckled.

"Your Highness, since you are aware of the 'Dawn Qi' calamity, you must also know that 'Dawn Qi' and 'Bright Yang' are incompatible. In the past, seeking 'Bright Yang' through 'Dawn Qi' might have been possible. But now? It's a fool's errand, like climbing a tree to catch a fish. Is it not just courting death?"

That sentence struck the very heart of Li Ximing's confusion, nearly causing him to blurt out all his questions.

'Exactly! Seeking 'Bright Yang' with 'Dawn Qi' is courting death, that's undeniable. In my opinion, adding a 'Radiant Origin Pass' divine ability on top of 'Dawn Qi' arts... that's not just dead, that's deader than dead!'

Li Ximing fell silent for a long moment before asking,

"That is true. Bright Yang and Dawn Qi are as incompatible as fire and water. So how, Great Daoist Master, did you manage to establish the 'Radiant Origin Pass' amidst a foundation of roiling Dawn Qi?"

Daoist Master Diyan clasped his hands behind his back.

"Your Highness is correct. By all rights, it canno be done. Were it anyone else, they wouldn't have even been able to stabilize my first few divine abilities. However... I borrowed the legacy of an ancestor."

Daoist Master Diyan turned his body slightly. As he moved, all the white, illusory light within the hall seemed to dim and refract, as if scores of tangible, jeweled swords had suddenly angled their blades, casting their reflections sideways.

"My ancestor, Yin Ni, was originally a disciple from Guanlong. He studied the Dao in a monastery, but after ten years, he still hadn't even achieved Qi Condensation. In frustration, he joined the army. He performed one great deed after another, and within an Immortal Manor, he obtained a predecessor's Thirty-Six Books of Profound Radiance, which he used to form his divine ability. He cultivated all the way to the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm. By the time he was enfeoffed as King Zhaoming, he was rampaging unopposed across Mobei. He then rewrote the Thirty-Six Books of Profound Radiance, combining it with a method for seeking the Golden Attainment bestowed by the Imperial Monarch, to create the Dao-Scroll of the Radiant Bright Manor."

"After my ancestor completed this scroll, he immediately sought the True Gold Attainment. He used the north's greatest fortress, the Spirit's Descent Pass, as his furnace. He used his entire body, his divine abilities, his dharma power, his soul, and his True Spirit as the ingredients to seek that one supreme elixir. He refined it for nine days, and the Imperial Monarch himself personally acted to uplift him and help him achieve the Dao!"

His expression turned melancholic, and he let out a heavy sigh.

"Unfortunately, to achieve the Dao, my ancestor borrowed too much from external Profound Mystery. His spirit was strangled and locked. After nine days of striving, he failed to attain... and perished."

Li Ximing listened, his expression growing solemn.

"Borrowed too much from external Profound Mystery? Spirit-strangulation?"

Daoist Master Diyan closed his eyes briefly, his voice low and somber.

"The so-called external Profound Mystery... the Buddhist Land is one source. The Celestial Dynasty is another. It means to use one's own body to borrow the Profound Mystery of another, instead of cultivating one's own original nature and life-mandate. This is what borrowing heavily from external Profound Mystery means, and so many in the world do it! Even setting aside the Buddhist Land and the Celestial Dynasty, the likes of Dongfang Heyun, the 'Heaven's Horn' of Sword Mountain, the streams of the Western Sea... they all borrow external Profound Mystery. They can borrow a path, but they can never attain the Dao."

Li Ximing had long been aware that cultivators in the Wei state relied on official positions to gain their divine abilities. Daoist Master Diyan had also just mentioned that Yin Ni studied in a monastery for ten years without any success, so he must have also relied heavily on the Celestial Dynasty's system. There was only one point Li Ximing still didn't grasp. He hesitated, 

"But... the Dharma Masters..."

Daoist Master Diyan said dismissively,

"In this day and age, what Dharma Master is still capable of truly achieving the Dao!"

"The Merciful One and Maha in the Buddhist Land—do you think they cultivated their positions themselves? Most of them just wait for a seat to become vacant, then find an opportunity to climb into it. The nature of a Dharma Master has changed. In the earliest days, they were beings of great virtue and power, whose wisdom encompassed heaven and earth. Later, it became about nine reincarnations, transferring one's nature to inherit the role, becoming a Dharma Master after attaining the Dao. But the ones who came after... they just hem and haw, wait for nine lifetimes, and inherit someone else's seat. They are nothing but an empty shell, a Dharma Master in name only."

His expression tightened, as if wary of saying too much.

"In short, borrowing heavily from external Profound Mystery is gravely detrimental to achieving the Dao. Back then, the six founding kings—Xuanji, King Zhaoming, Baiyang, Yongqin, Shouyi, and Luanfu—all perished in succession, unable to achieve the Dao."

"Later, the Wei state was destroyed, and my ancestors were lost in sea. But this Dao-Scroll of the Radiant Bright Manor and King Zhaoming's Daoist Canon survived and were passed down. They were rich in Spiritual Qi and resources. It was passed through three generations of our royal line before I finally exhausted its reserves."

He smiled.

"The reason you don't see anyone else here cultivating 'Dawn Qi' is because this path is transmitted through a single lineage. Only a royal heir can cultivate it. My own aptitude is not poor. I perceived the Purple Mystery at one hundred and thirty-six years of age. By the time I broke through to become a Great Daoist Master, I still had three hundred years of life remaining."

Li Ximing was staggered by this revelation.

He thought of Jiang Boqing, who had cultivated the 'Upper Shaman' path, a complex Dao involving the Shaman-Register and myriad shamanic arts. Even with those aids, Jiang Boqing had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm at thirty and the Purple Mansion Realm at sixty. Reaching Foundation Establishment by thirty wasn't unheard of for a peerless genius—Li Zhouwei had even done it in his early twenties—but the leap from Foundation Establishment to Purple Mansion had still taken Jiang Boqing thirty years.

Yet Daoist Master Diyan had no Talisman Qi to assist him. Even if he reached the Purple Mansion Realm by sixty, he would have had to perfectly refine one divine ability after another and pass the Purple Mystery with ease to master four divine abilities before he was two hundred... In the present day, perhaps only Li Zhouwei, who was practically carried by destiny with the entire world's support, had any hope of surpassing Daoist Master Diyan's speed!

Daoist Master Diyan noted the shock in Li Ximing’s eyes and smiled faintly.

"After passing the Purple Mystery, I spent thirty years cultivating the Dao and refining my divine abilities, cementing my position as a Great Daoist Master. Then, I spent another twenty years contemplating my choice for the final divine ability. The final art recorded in the Dao-Scroll of the Radiant Bright Manor is, in fact, Bright Yang."

He began to pace, his voice softening.

"If I had continued on the path of Dawn Qi, I would have naturally achieved an aura of complete, perfected divine abilities. However, the Dawn Qi Dao I bear is a Great Dao that was modified by the Celestial Dynasty. It is already fundamentally different from the one that exists today. If I were to add a cheap imitation to the original, I might complete the divine ability, but the Quest for Gold would be hopeless."

A trace of doubt appeared on Li Ximing's face.

"And the Dao-Scroll of the Radiant Bright Manor can lead to the Dao?" he whispered. "Your ancestor failed because he borrowed external Profound Mystery, but you are different. You cultivate your own nature. Is your hope of success great?"

But Daoist Master Diyan shook his head, laughing.

"Your Highness is mistaken. There is no 'great hope'. It is still, fundamentally, courting death."

Daoist Master Diyan's smile grew even colder.

"Seeking the Bright Yang Intercalary is an impossible feat. Not only can it not be achieved, the moment I take that step, my death will be imminent!"

Li Ximing stared at him, stunned. But Daoist Master Diyan merely smiled and resumed his pacing, his voice turning eerie.

"Your Highness was correct about one thing: the Imperial Monarch has not truly perished. At least, not yet. The Dao-Scroll of the Radiant Bright Manor he personally left behind, and the Radiant Golden Convergence Method within it, are still effective before the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment. But you must have also considered... Bright Yang itself may not have changed, but Dawn Qi has! The old Dao can still be cultivated, but it is no longer compatible with Bright Yang!"

"The moment the 'Radiant Origin Pass' was formed, the four 'Dawn Qi' divine abilities within my body were instantly subverted. Their colors retracted, the azure and white merging into a chaotic unity. As time passes, a gloom will fester in the darkness, and my Shengyang Acupoint will begin to corrode and shatter!"

The doubt in Li Ximing's heart was instantly verified, and understanding dawned,

'This! This is what makes sense! This is the logical outcome. Even if my Dao-Profundity is lacking, I know how demanding it is to cultivate even one compatible divine ability, let alone one from a Dao that now clashes with the world's order! With Bright Yang completed, it's a miracle he can survive for even half a year without perishing!'

Just as he thought this, Daoist Master Diyan's gaze settled on the bronze lamp beside him. He gently adjusted the wick.

"By using this Thirty-Second Generation Night-Profound Bronze Treasure Lamp to create this chamber, I can merge Molten Fire and dawn light. This allows me to resonate with the Three Yangs and borrow the subtle master-servant dynamic remaining in the other two, which is the only way to suppress the four parts Dawn Qi and one part Bright Yang within me."

Li Ximing scanned the vast, paulownia-wood hall again, raising an eyebrow. 

"So, Great Daoist Master, you were prepared for this all along."

"I was not the one who made these preparations."

Daoist Master Diyan turned his head, his gaze lowered and his expression serene.

"When Bright Yang fell, my ancestor Yin Quan had already passed the Purple Mystery. Things were manageable at first, and he could still wander the overseas territories. But as the Emperor of Qi's actions grew more ruthless, he began to show the first signs of his divine abilities disintegrating. He used a Three Yangs formation to suppress the decay while researching it meticulously."

"Before his death, he left behind the formation diagrams. My grandfather and father then spent their lives perfecting and constructing it, combining it with the many secret arts from the Dao-Scroll of the Radiant Bright Manor. Only then did today's Hall of the Three Yangs Suppressing Dawn and this Thirty-Second Generation Night-Profound Bronze Treasure Lamp come into being."

Li Ximing listened, remaining silent for a long time. He realized Mount Qusi hadn't been planning this for a mere day or two, but for centuries, perhaps even a millennium. He finally spoke, his voice heavy.

"Great Daoist Master... where, then, do you need the King of Wei?"

Daoist Master Diyan’s eyes snapped open, his expression utterly grave.

"I need the King of Wei to succeed. I am the only person who truly cares about his success."

As his emotions surged, ring-like, flame-like patterns appeared in his pupils, overlaid with fractured black lines.

"When I said I am the only one the King of Wei can trust, it was not an empty boast. Everyone else wants to destabilize Bright Yang, or perhaps stall Luoxia. But none of them care if the King of Wei actually succeeds. In fact, for most of them, it would be better if he failed!"

"The Dragon-kin, I'm sure, make grand promises. But they are just playing the odds, placing a small bet in hopes of a large return. Even if it fails, the Dragon-kin will only lose a bit of initiative and a minor opportunity!"

"Only I."

His tone was hard as iron, his gaze glacial.

"Only when the King of Wei succeeds, only when Bright Yang rises again and suppresses Dawn Qi, will my divine abilities naturally transform from this heretical side path into a brilliant, orthodox one. Only then can I walk out of this place with my head held high, descend the sixteen profound steps, and truly seek the Golden Attainment—to risk everything in a final bid for truth!"

"Otherwise, I am nothing but dry bones in a tomb, sitting here waiting to die!"

Li Ximing met his gaze directly. The last vestiges of suspicion surfaced in his mind. But seeing Daoist Master Diyan's raw, sincere emotion, which seemed impossible to fake, he finally spoke again, his voice low.

"Great Daoist Master, your talent is extraordinary. You are one of the foremost figures in the entire mainland. Even if you had just cultivated 'Dawn Qi' normally, how could your future be any less bright!"

His eyes bored into Daoist Master Diyan, a note of sorrow in his voice.

"This current King of Wei... how does he compare to Li Xunquan? To Li Xuan? To Donghuo? Li Xunquan raised a righteous army and nearly destroyed the Great Qi! Cui Mu of Donghuo once posed as a True Monarch and intimidated all the northern cultivators. Even Li Xuan—he had the entire land of Long and Wei, where he was supreme and bowed to no one!"

"Today, the Northern Buddhists run rampant. The Great Song dynasty shines brilliantly, seizing Bright Yang's authority. Luoxia shepherds the world, preparing to cast down the Imperial Monarch. If the King of Wei fails even once, all of Mount Qusi's generations of effort will be for nothing! Daoist Master, why must you take such a gamble? Why place your hope of attaining the Dao in someone else's hands? Wouldn't it be better to just cultivate Dawn Qi? Wouldn't it be better to reincarnate and start anew?"

His tone was sharp, stabbing directly at Daoist Master Diyan.

"A Great Daoist Master capable of mastering all five methods... why would you spin a cocoon to trap yourself?"

Daoist Master Diyan let out a short, sharp laugh. Without a moment's hesitation, his voice low and steady, he answered,

"Because of the method. The method for the Golden Attainment."

Li Ximing had braced himself for any number of arguments, but he never expected this answer. He stared, speechless.

"The method?"

"The most important thing is the method to seek the Golden Attainment."

Daoist Master Diyan's bronze-colored eyes blinked. His expression was solemn, so grave it was almost sacred. His lips barely moved, his voice a low hum.

"The Imperial Monarch specifically bestowed the Radiant Golden Convergence Method. That is what created the Great Dao of using four parts Dawn Qi to uplift the 'Radiant Origin Pass' to immortality. It is the method for the Golden Attainment. It is the secret of True Gold. It is a celestial scripture of the Great Dao. Only with the Radiant Golden Convergence Method did seeking the Bright Yang Intercalary become even remotely possible!"

As Daoist Master Diyan's emotions fluctuated, the candlelight throughout the great hall wavered violently. The almost-tangible Dawn Qi and Molten Fire surged like a flood, straining against their restraints. This, in turn, triggered the radiance of the Three Yangs to flare in the vaulted ceiling, pressing down to suppress the chaotic energies.

Daoist Master Diyan paid it no mind. He took a step forward, staring straight at Li Ximing.

"Do you think the Hall of the Three Yangs Suppressing Dawn and the Thirty-Second Generation Night-Profound Bronze Treasure Lamp were so easily constructed? Without the Radiant Golden Convergence Method, Mount Qusi could have spent another thousand years and never built this grand formation. Without the Radiant Golden Convergence Method, I would suffer from divine ability disintegration even while sitting in this very hall!"

"But as long as this method exists... even if I were to take a grand elixir of the Three Yangs' union right now to suppress my powers, step outside this hall, and attempt the Quest for Gold while risking the utter disintegration of my Shengyang Acupoint... my chances of success would still be greater than if I had tried to seek the Fruition Attainment using five complete Dawn Qi divine abilities!"

His expression was dark. The violent fluctuations of divine ability rolling off him turned the entire hall into a living purgatory. After an unknown time, Daoist Master Diyan parted his lips, his expression heavy.

"I have no choice. And neither do you, Your Highness. Nor does the King of Wei."
