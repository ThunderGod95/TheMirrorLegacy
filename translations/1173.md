# Chapter 1173: Illumination and Shelter

The Great Song Empire, in the heart of the Imperial Capital.

A carriage descended from the northern skies, swaying as it settled upon the ground. Cultivators and common folk alike thronged the streets and watched from balconies, their gazes fixed on the arrival.

'The remnants of Profound Peak...'

'They've brought back some of the turncoats... I wonder what fate awaits them.'

The whispers traveled on the wind, some carried by dharma power, others passed from mouth to ear. Amidst the bustling crowd, a man emerged from the front of the procession.

He was not a tall man, but he was stout and dark-skinned, with a fine sword hanging at his waist. A point of purple light glowed brightly between his brows, catching the celestial radiance of the Martial Cultivation Star above. It lent his otherwise plain features an air of martial authority.

This Holder of the Profound—for that was his title—parted the carriage curtain, revealing a man who shuffled out to the grating sound of iron chains.

The man was gaunt and withered, his body stooped with age or despair. His ashen face was mottled with age spots, and his eyes were narrowed to mere slits. Lanks of black hair and beard clung to his hollow cheeks.

When he took another step, the heavy black cangue locked around his neck became visible. The man leading him pulled the chain, the crisp clatter causing the prisoner to lift his head. He saw that the balconies lining the street were packed with onlookers.

Their path was blocked by a young man on a spirited horse. He was handsome and dashing, dressed in fine silks, a broad, confident smile on his face. He held the reins in one hand, while the other drew a whip.

“General Chen! Congratulations on your triumphant return!”

The moment the young man appeared, Chen Wenyao spun around. Despite the chain in his hand, he dropped to one knee.

“Greetings to the Second Highness.”

The man on horseback was indeed Yang Jiong, the Second Prince of the Great Song Empire.

At the mention of his title, the shackled Kong Xiaxiang did not so much as raise his eyelids. He stood alone, a statue of silent defiance, as he heard the prince laugh.

“By order of His Majesty, my brother and I were to greet you at the Xiude and Xuanwu Gates. What a fine coincidence that you should arrive at mine. Come, General, you will accompany me to the palace!”

At these words, a subtle change came over Chen Wenyao’s face. He merely lowered his eyes and assented. But Yang Jiong was clearly enjoying himself. He urged his horse forward a few steps and peered at Kong Xiaxiang with a smile.

“And who might this old fellow be?”

In truth, Kong Xiaxiang was still a young man. Had his life not been marked by such tragedy, he would still be a pillar of the Profound Peak Gate. But the sight of Kong Tingyun and Kong Guxi taking their own lives before his very eyes had consumed him with a despair so profound it had sapped the very life from him, leaving him looking old and wretched.

Hearing the prince's question, Kong Xiaxiang finally raised his head. His eyes were unnervingly calm as he spoke, his voice trembling.

“I am Kong Xiaxiang, Head of the Kong Clan.”

Yang Jiong led his horsemen forward, his smile widening.

“The Kong Clan. The clan that defied the imperial army and refused to pay homage for years. Tell me... how did you end up like this?”

Kong Xiaxiang remained silent, as though he hadn't heard a word.

The prince’s question drew low laughter from the cultivators watching from the sides. A barrage of mocking gazes fell upon the disgraced members of the Kong Clan. When only silence answered him, Yang Jiong's smile never wavered. He flicked his wrist, and the whip cracked against the iron cangue with a clang, sending sparks flying.

A flicker of pity crossed Chen Wenyao’s eyes, but his actions were merciless. He gave the chain a sharp tug, sending a jolt of dharma power through the iron.

“His Highness asked you a question!”

The Kong Clan had already suffered so much. Once scattered to the winds, its recently reunited members were mostly the old and the weak. How could they withstand such a threat? A wave of soft weeping spread through the scattered group of prisoners behind Kong Xiaxiang.

Yet Kong Xiaxiang remained silent.

The smile vanished from Yang Jiong’s eyes. Just as he was about to speak, a nearby carriage stirred. A voice, clear and transcendent, calm yet powerful, cut through the tension.

“Second Highness, you are delaying the appointed hour.”

Yang Jiong’s expression remained unchanged at the sound of the voice, but he reined in his horse.

“There is no rush,” he called back with a laugh.

A flicker of emotion finally broke through Kong Xiaxiang’s deathly mask. He raised his head slightly, his gaze following the voice to its source. He saw a golden palanquin hovering in mid-air, a young man standing before it.

He was tall and strikingly handsome, his bearing noble. Clad in a white robe, he cradled a sword in his arms. A mark of cyan graced his brow, and his eyes were as dark and brilliant as stars on a moonless night. Wisps of elemental energy, water and fire, coiled around his sleeves like miniature dragons and phoenixes.

'Someone from the Li Clan...'

The instant Kong Xiaxiang’s eyes fell upon him, the oppressive weight of the prince’s presence seemed to vanish. Prince Yang Jiong spurred his horse forward, his gaze hot as it fixed on the spiritual sword at the young man's waist. He laughed.

“Daoist Li, if you have such an interest in matters of the court, why did you renounce your titles and seals of office?”

Unlike the snickering from before, the prince's words plunged the street into a deathly silence. In the balconies above, cultivators who had been watching avidly now averted their gazes, pretending they had heard nothing. The commoners merely exchanged looks of terror.

To put it frankly, while many in the Imperial Capital might never have laid eyes on the Second Prince, Yang Jiong, they had all heard tales of the sword immortal who had been summoned to court only to refuse every office and title offered to him—Li Jiangchun.

While war raged between the north and south, the Imperial Capital had its own currents of turmoil. This prodigy of the Li Clan had entered seclusion the moment he arrived, refusing all visitors. The only person in the entire capital who could command his presence was the Song Emperor himself.

Yet even when personally summoned by the Emperor and offered rank and peerage, this sword immortal from a vassal state had dared to refuse. Only when he could refuse no longer did he accept a token stipend of a single grain of millet, a symbolic gesture of his fealty.

Other rumors, particularly relished by the great clans, also made the rounds. It was said that the Song Emperor—notoriously unaffectionate toward his own kin—had once pitted his two sons against Li Jiangchun in a sword contest. Without even drawing his blade or calling upon his Sword Intent, the young immortal had still managed to slice the jade crown from the Second Prince's head.

'When these two cross paths… nothing good ever comes of it!'

Yang Jiong’s calm but forceful words carried a sharp sting, making Chen Wenyao’s heart ache. He lamented inwardly.

'Why did I have to be the one caught in the middle of this!'

His Chen Clan’s divine ability was fading, with no successor in sight. They were forced to play both sides. His own esteemed elder, Daoist Master Chen Yin, served the Li Clan with utmost dedication guarding their lake, while he himself acted with reverence and humility at the imperial court. He had never expected to be caught in such a predicament.

A hint of confusion flashed in the eyes of the sword immortal above. Just as he was about to speak, the curtain of the golden palanquin behind him was drawn aside. A middle-aged man leaned out and spoke in a gentle tone.

“The Emperor's grace is boundless; we must not be tardy in receiving it. Jiangchun is merely concerned for the affairs of the state. Is that so wrong? I am but a humble servant in the Hall of Martial Cultivation. If Your Highness will not heed Jiangchun's words, then perhaps you will at least listen to the counsel of an Emissary of the True Light Cloud.”

The man was of average height and handsome features. His robes were magnificent, embroidered with golden patterns that gave him an air of noble, otherworldly grace. Yang Jiong’s face fell. The hand resting on his sword hilt relaxed.

“Ah, Marquis Anyang,” he said, his voice tinged with disappointment.

Chen Wenyao lowered his head, a bitter taste filling his mouth.

'This is trouble… someone even more influential has arrived.'

This was none other than Li Jiangchun’s father, Li Zhouluo, the Marquis of Anyang in the Great Song Empire.

This Marquis Anyang possessed no supreme divine ability, nor was he a peerless talent. But he carried the blood of both the Li and Yang imperial lines. He was the younger brother of the renowned King Wei, the grandnephew of the Grand General who oversaw the Martial Halls, and even the three great prodigies of the Li Clan who now held the title of Holder of the Profound had to call him Uncle.

In the current Song court, his station was almost beyond words; the Song Emperor himself had excused him from the ritual of kneeling.

Even a prince like Yang Jiong dared not act arrogantly in his presence. The atmosphere instantly grew heavy. Seeing this, Kong Xiaxiang finally lowered his head with great solemnity.

“My clan's Daoist Master was coerced by the Profound Governance. For the crime of offending His Majesty's celestial might, she has already taken her own life in atonement. We, her humble subjects, traveled south through the night to present ourselves before the imperial court…”

His words shattered the tense atmosphere. Yang Jiong retracted his whip. Chen Wenyao, feeling as if he’d been granted a pardon, quickly led his prisoners forward toward the palace. With a regretful shake of his head and a faint smile, Yang Jiong turned his horse, and the sound of hooves faded into the distance.

Li Jiangchun turned back to the palanquin to find his father’s face dark with anger.

“That Second Prince… he is far too petty!”

Li Zhouluo was always exceedingly discreet, knowing the conflict between the two princes was a delicate matter. He was always courteous to both and showed no favoritism. But the moment Li Jiangchun was involved, his usually placid and polite face would cloud over. Even if a Daoist Master of the Purple Mansion Realm were to appear, Li Zhouluo would stand his ground.

Anyone could suffer a grievance, but not his precious son.

In contrast to his father's simmering rage, Li Jiangchun seemed lost in thought. After a moment of contemplation, he said,

“My Dao foundation is the All-Fragrance Sinks, which resonates with the Lesser Yin. I can faintly sense that he still wishes to challenge me in the Way of the Sword. Had you not intervened, Father, I suspect he would have pressed the issue.”

Li Zhouluo scoffed but said nothing for a few moments before frowning.

“Hasn't the Second Prince already lost to you once before the throne? Why this obsession?”

Yang Jiong's swordsmanship was not to be underestimated. He practiced diligently with the sword arts from the Yang Clan's Daoist Sword Codex and had reached the realm of Sword Origin at a young age. But he had not yet grasped Sword Intent. To challenge Li Jiangchun without it was nothing more than a fool's errand.

Li Jiangchun nodded.

“That is what puzzles me as well. I believe he was harassing the Kong Clan purely to draw me out, but I have never heard him to be a narrow-minded man… It is a true challenge he seeks, not just a chance to vex me.”

Li Zhouluo shook his head helplessly. The golden palanquin had come to a halt before the palace gates. Through the window, Li Jiangchun watched as Kong Xiaxiang’s cangue was removed before he was led into the main hall. The rest of the Kong Clan disciples knelt outside in terror, not daring to make a sound.

Li Zhouluo sighed.

“I will go and deliver King Wei’s letter. It should offer them some measure of protection.”

This was the very reason they had come to the palace. Li Jiangchun nodded gravely, watching his father exit the palanquin. He then parted the curtain just enough to observe the scene outside.

The moonlight was cold and clear. The calls of court officials echoed from within the palace walls. A flock of white cranes filled the sky, their wings beating silently as they descended to perch upon the sweeping eaves of the palace roofs. Li Jiangchun’s crystalline pupils reflected the great birds, each one as large as a man.

“Daoist Master Tingyun of the Kong Clan, guilty of numerous evils… in recognition of her sins, she took her own life, yet is still bathed in the True Light… Her descendant, Xiaxiang, who rejected heresy to embrace truth, is granted this audience… He is to be enfeoffed in the Southern Borderlands, tasked with guarding Yi Mountain, and granted the title ‘Marquis Who Rejects Evil,’ with permission to restore his ancestral rites…”

The melodious chant of the proclamation drifted out. A trace of emotion crossed Li Jiangchun’s features as he listened in silence. A fluttering sound came from the sky. A white crane landed on a single leg beside the kneeling members of the Kong Clan. It bent its legs, stretched out a wing, and solemnly covered them in its shadow.

A second followed, then a third… As the words of the pardon rang out, a dense flock of white cranes descended from the heavens, completely concealing the prostrate figures of the Kong Clan disciples beneath a sea of white feathers.

A ripple of emotion disturbed Li Jiangchun’s composure. He sheathed his sword and stepped out of the palanquin, his gaze bright as he stared at the dense flock of cranes descending from the sky.

A spot of black appeared before his eyes.

His father, Li Zhouluo, dressed in a robe of black and gold, was walking through the lines of grim-faced imperial guards. He moved with a slight bow, bathed in the moonlight. As if startled, the man-sized cranes hopped away from his path, retracting their wings to let him pass. His passage left a dark track through the field of white.

Li Jiangchun watched in silence as his father stepped into a corridor and vanished behind a curtain. A moment later, his father reappeared, his face alight with surprise and joy. He hurried back to the carriage.

“Chun’er!”

Li Jiangchun looked down and saw a brilliant yellow pendant in his father’s hand.

“What is this…?”

“A Spiritual Artifact!”

Li Zhouluo’s face was filled with emotion.

“His Majesty’s grace is as vast as a mountain! He holds no grudges. The entire Kong Clan has been pardoned. Kong Xiaxiang has been made the Marquis Who Rejects Evil and may once again perform the rites for his ancestors… His Majesty also returned Profound Peak’s treasures and the possessions of the late Kong Tingyun. Then, right there in the hall, he had Kong Xiaxiang distribute the Purple Mansion-grade items among the noble houses. Even the Purple Smoke and Xiukui clans, who had offered resistance, received spiritual treasures. All other debts were settled with spiritual resources, a declaration that all grievances were now concluded, never to be brought up again!”

“His Majesty is truly a man of great benevolence.”

Li Jiangchun had met Yang Zhuo before and knew something of his character. He nodded in approval at his father's words. But Li Zhouluo was practically trembling with excitement.

“This Spiritual Artifact… he gave it to our Li Clan! He said it is called the Jade Heart of the Vast Earth, an artifact from the Daoist Tradition of Comprehending Profoundity. He said that with all debts now settled, this was to repay a past kindness owed to our clan!”

Father and son looked down at the Spiritual Artifact resting in Li Zhouluo’s palm. It emitted a captivating glow, a faint brown light pulsing within it. Li Zhouluo’s voice trembled.

“Any artifact from the Daoist Tradition of Comprehending Profoundity is, in this day and age, at least a mid- to high-grade Spiritual Artifact! You should have seen them in the throne hall—not a single person could look away!”

A smile touched Li Jiangchun’s lips.

“A pity… our family has no Daoist Master of the Earth Virtue, nor do we favor that path. We can typically only draw upon sixty or seventy percent of a spiritual artifact's power. For this one, I imagine we could manage forty or fifty percent at best…”

“It is enough to entrust it to one of our Daoist Masters! They will surely find a use for it!”

Li Zhouluo’s face was radiant with joy. He carefully tucked the artifact inside his robes, then eagerly pulled out a white scroll to send the good news back to Ting Province. Li Jiangchun shook his head with a smile, but as he turned to lift the curtain again, a shadow of worry crossed his face.

Countless great cranes were landing once more, slowly covering the dark path his father had cut through their ranks, leaving only a faint, broken black line. From the great hall, the court officials and cultivators from the noble houses began to emerge. They descended the stairs in clusters of two and three, like black specks skittering across a field of snow.

Li Jiangchun’s eyes grew somber.

From a young age, this genius sword immortal of the Li Clan had practiced the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record, a supreme Daoist scripture. He had achieved mastery early, and his understanding had only deepened with age. Now, even without conscious effort, the elemental energies of water and fire coiled within his sleeves, a constant ward protecting his body.

The true mysteries of such a supreme scripture could not be fully unveiled until one reached the Purple Mansion Realm, but it was like a high vantage point from which he viewed the world. It made him acutely sensitive to the subtle flows of fate and fortune. And everything he saw now filled him with a deep sense of unease.

He took a hesitant step forward, startling Li Zhouluo from his joyful reverie.

“What is it?” his father asked.

“It’s nothing.”

Li Jiangchun drew back his foot and gave his father a reassuring nod. He let the curtain fall, rolled up his sleeves, and began to grind ink for his father’s letter.

'The Martial Cultivation Star does not illuminate… it does not shelter.'

Unconsciously, a shadow of gloom settled over the features of the Song Empire’s youngest sword immortal.

'And it is not just Ting Province that the Martial Cultivation Star fails to illuminate and shelter. Besides the Holders of the Profound, there is also myself, my father, and everyone from King Wei and Daoist Master Zhaojing down to the lowest court guard, the women and children—every last member of the Li Clan…'

'Without its light, there is no judgment of virtue or sin. Without its protection, there is no accounting for life or death.'
