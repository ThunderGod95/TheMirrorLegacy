# Chapter 1265: Pacification

His words echoed throughout the cosmos, causing the expressions of the Daoist Masters suspended in the night to shift. Liu Changdie's face was a mask of complexity, Cheng Qian was lost in disappointment, and Yu Xi's gaze dimmed. Even Changyun's smile vanished as he silently clutched his profound umbrella.

'Only now do I recognize the vastness of the universe, and the insignificance of my own being…'

Those who could cultivate to the Purple Mansion Realm might have had different temperaments and ambitions, but which of them was not a genius? Before leaving his mountain, Cheng Qian was the number one talent of Overlook Peak, a prodigy seen only once a century.

Before he achieved the Dao, Liu Changdie was a formation master who roamed the world, seizing every opportunity that came his way. Even Yu Xi—now like a withered skeleton in a tomb—had been full of vigor in his youth, once patted on the shoulder by a Purple Mansion expert and praised, 

"You have inherited three hundred years of Ruzhou's fortune!"

Who among them had not risen by trampling over countless others?

This battle between Gongsun Bei and Li Zhouwei had left them all speechless and ashamed of their own inferiority. Hearing such last words, how could Cheng Qian, or even Cui Jueyin, not be deeply shaken?

How could this not be the heartfelt cry of every Purple Mansion cultivator present!

'Only now… do I recognize the vastness of the world!'

As he spoke his final words, Yin Juexi, being of a more forthright nature, was visibly moved. He even took a step forward and said softly,

"King Wei… this man…"

Though his voice was quiet, it carried clearly through the night sky. Before he could finish, Gongsun Bei began to laugh and said,

"Fellow Daoist, there is no need to plead for me! If those two scoundrels, Jiang Toushou and Xiaodisa, had used my strategy and swiftly taken Xiangxiang, even if they couldn't have pacified Luoxia, they could have eliminated one or two with divine abilities—and it might very well have been you!"

Yin Juexi was cut off, but he felt a tug and a weight as Yu Xi pulled him back. Though the old man did not know him, his eyes held a pleading look as he said,

"The Gongsun clan is humble, without power or influence…"

Yin Juexi fell silent.

The Daoist Master knelt on the ground, the bloodlust in his eyes faded, leaving them bright and full of spirit. Lights flashed across the sky. King Wei spoke no more, instead untying the royal battle-axe from his waist, the glow on its long blade growing ever brighter.

Splitting Light!

For an instant, a brilliant Heavenly Light flashed across the horizon, followed immediately by a dense, cyan-yellow radiance that soared into the sky!

This cyan-yellow light blotted out the heavens, stirring the cold night into a frenzy. A light like morning dew rolled across the sky, yet it was not chilling like an autumn mist, but scalding hot and vibrant. It vaporized all moisture from the ground, kicking up clouds of dust and smoke.

A master of a divine ability had fallen!

General Gongsun Bei of the Great Zhao Divine Suburbs had died in battle before Zanmen.

'Boye… is now in my hands!'

This King Wei raised his long axe and regretfully wiped away a non-existent bloodstain from its blade. He finally spoke,

"I will grant your wish."

As for Gongsun Bei's words, "swiftly take Xiangxiang," Li Zhouwei largely understood their meaning upon hearing them.

Could it have succeeded? It wasn't entirely impossible.

If Great Zhao had only acted a few hours sooner… had they left Zanmen half a night earlier and taken Xiangxiang while Li Zhouwei was still at Mount Liangchuan, they would still have had a fighting chance. Every moment they delayed tipped the scales further against them!

'But by the time I reached Ruzhou and subdued Yu Xi, Xiangxiang had already been greatly fortified. Moreover, when Gongsun Bei and his men arrived at Zanmen, we had already been lying in wait for them at Boye for quite some time!'

With his Spirit Probe, Li Zhouwei could see everything with perfect clarity. Once the situation reached this point, no matter how Gongsun Bei struggled, he could no longer escape Li Zhouwei's grasp.

'Besides, the Buddhist cultivators won't act without profit and won't advance into danger. How could the likes of Jiang Toushou and Xiaodisa truly work with him? The moment he arrived before the pass and found Luoxia silent, he should have known his doom was at hand…'

For a moment, sand and stones flew as a hazy smoke filled the air, obscuring the sky. Li Zhouwei sheathed his long axe and looked back at the crowd. Cui Jueyin took a step back and prostrated himself, followed by a chorus of deferential voices.

As billowing dust engulfed the world, Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod and said,

"I have troubled you all."

"Ultimately, it was King Wei's decisive power that secured the victory!"

Changyun offered a faint smile.

This fellow had always concealed his true strength. No matter who he fought, he would always drag out the battle. Back when he served under Great Zhao, he was utterly mediocre. Yet now, when pitted against Jiang Toushou—a sixth-generation Maha from Mount Dayang who was skilled in both spell arts and Enlightened Artifacts—he had actually fought him to a standstill.

When Gongsun Bei was falling, Xiaodisa had merely watched from the sidelines, but Jiang Toushou had intended to intervene. Unexpectedly, Changyun had tied him down completely, preventing him from lending a hand—had it been Chen Yin in his place, he likely wouldn't have possessed such skill.

Li Zhouwei nodded at him, his gaze finally settling on the great formation below.

The battle between the Purple Mansion cultivators in Boye had been nothing short of earth-shattering. The Qiao clan had huddled within their great formation, not daring to make a move. Even though the clash of divine abilities outside had now subsided, the Qiao family was in a state of utter panic. No one dared to venture out, which made Changyun frown.

Li Zhouwei spoke, "This formation is the only defensible position in Boye; it cannot be lost… I'm afraid we will have to get Jia Zan to persuade them to surrender."

Just then, a man with a scholarly bearing and a calm expression stepped forward and said softly,

"This subordinate can perhaps make an attempt!"

It was Cui Jueyin.

He offered a salute and said,

"The region of Boye is a fertile land beyond the pass. In years past, my ancestor was enfeoffed at Han Pass and granted a fiefdom in Boye. In those days, Boye encompassed the lands of Yinling and Xiangxiang…"

Changyun suddenly understood, he said,

"So this was High Radiance's fiefdom!"

The ancestor he spoke of was none other than High Radiance True Monarch Cui Yan!

Changyun uttered a sound of approval and turned to Li Zhouwei, saying,

"I hear the inscription on the Huai River Map in Your Majesty's possession reads 'Cui Yan of Boye'."

Li Zhouwei nodded as well, looking thoughtful. He took the Huai River Map from his waist as Cui Jueyin raised an eyebrow and said,

"Indeed."

He said softly,

"The True Monarch ruled with benevolence and won the people with his magnanimity. In Boye, every household was prosperous and deeply indebted to his grace. I had thought that after a thousand years, things would be different, but when this subordinate conquered Xiangxiang, I learned from a member of the Wei family that both the Qiao and Wei clans once resided in Boye and received much grace from the old kingdom. An ancestor of the Qiao clan once held the third rank, personally promoted by the True Monarch himself!"

Li Zhouwei nodded and said,

"You may as well go and try."

Cui Jueyin descended on a beam of light, stopping before the formation. He spoke softly,

"Everyone, Great Zhao has been defeated by King Wei and has already fled. I am Cui Jueyin, a descendant of the Cui clan of Guanlong from the former Wei Empire. I invite all cultivators to open the formation and welcome the king, so that we may avoid further bloodshed!"

Upon hearing this, chaos erupted within. A timid voice called out,

"Are you a descendant of High Radiance?"

Truthfully, the bloodline of the Chongzhou Cui clan was quite distant from the High Radiance True Monarch. The True Monarch's direct lineage had produced many Purple Mansion cultivators, but all of them had perished with their nation when Wei fell, leaving none behind…

He could only reply with complicated feelings.

"I am."

The Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Qiao clan had no power to choose to begin with. The great battle was over; they would have to submit to whoever came. Their only hope was that it would not be the monk they had previously turned away. They had never considered that anyone from Great Song would come to protect them.

Moved, one of them said,

"We implore the Daoist Master to save us!"

The great formation rumbled open, revealing a mountain covered in fissures. Raging purple-gold flames flickered everywhere, scorching the land and leaving cracks in their wake. Numerous precious spiritual items and woods had lost their luster in the blaze, and charred corpses could even be seen among the pavilions!

The moment the formation opened, the fire seemed to choke for an instant before leaping up, transforming into a bolt of purple-gold light that tried to flee.

Cui Jueyin caught sight of it and said, stunned:

"The Guangshao Purple-Gold Flame?"

It turned out the Qiao clan's great formation had long been in disrepair and lacked a master to control it. After taking a full-powered strike from the Mahas, its exterior merely flickered, but the interior was already shaking violently. This had actually allowed the spiritual fire within the formation to escape, sending flames soaring into the heavens!

This fire was ranked as a Blazing Fire, possessing the properties of transformation and ascension. Even an ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator would struggle to control it. If a Purple Mansion master had been present, they might have been able to contain it with an ancestral treasure, but the formation only held Foundation Establishment cultivators who were utterly powerless against it…

With the Purple Mansion cultivators battling outside and the spiritual fire raging within, the Qiao clan was on pins and needles. They had watched as the fire grew, piling up casualties. Even if Cui Jueyin had not come to persuade them, they could not have held out for much longer!

Now that the formation was open, Cui Jueyin could not allow the flame to escape. He raised a hand, forming a seal to cast a spell. The profound ruler at his waist shot forth, unleashing a ripple of mountain and river patterns that ensnared the fire.

The Eternal Brightness Steps flickered into existence, spreading out as streams of celestial fire descended to suppress the flame. The Eternal Brightness Steps possessed the power to bind and subdue; while it might have struggled against a flame with a master, suppressing a masterless spiritual fire was a simple task.

Facing the ruined formation, Cui Jueyin could only wave his sleeve to extinguish the lingering multicolored light on the ground. He called out softly,

"Senior Liu!"

A silver light descended in response. Li Zhouwei shifted his halberd, finally turning to survey the assembled cultivators.

He spoke softly,

"Though the Buddhists have retreated, Luoxia is not yet secure. Both Liangchuan and Ruzhou require guardians… Since Daoist Master Yuanbian and Qing Feng are here in Boye, we still need one more powerful cultivator—Fellow Daoist Changyun, I will leave this place to you."

Mount Liangchuan at least had a great mountain for defense, whereas Boye had nothing but a ruined formation. Li Zhouwei naturally assigned his strongest cultivator, Changyun, to this location. He then turned to Yu Xi and said,

"Daoist Master, I must ask you to go to Mount Liangchuan."

Yu Xi was not surprised. He was, after all, a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator. Even if he had fought with all his might in the battle, Li Zhouwei would never be confident enough to station him in Ruzhou.

The old man simply said softly:

"This old one shall guard Mount Liangchuan without fail. I only ask that King Wei, seeing my earnest devotion… will ensure my family's foundation in Ruzhou is not lost."

Although he too had submitted, his tone was now markedly more respectful than before. Li Zhouwei had great need of him at the moment, so he reciprocated the gesture and said,

"I have seen Daoist Master Yu's accomplishments with my own eyes. When the time comes for rewards, I will ask General Yang to report to the throne and establish a Holder of the Profound for the Yu clan to reward your loyalty."

Yu Xi's feelings were a mixture of joy and apprehension.

Being in the north, he was aware of Martial Cultivation and understood this was a golden opportunity to add another Purple Mansion cultivator to his clan, bridging the generational gap. Yet, this also meant the Yu clan was now bound to the war chariot of Great Song. If Luoxia ever returned to Zhao in the future, matters would no longer be so simple.

This was not an insurmountable problem; at worst, the clan could split into northern and southern branches. After all, a portion of their clansmen had already fled south. With Great Zhao's central authority shattered and the Yu clan having lacked any true talents for years, he—their sole hope—had been unable to enter a sect to cultivate. They were not like the Wei or Tao clans and had been all but forgotten. In the past, he had been resentful, but now, it seemed this might not be such a bad thing…

He hesitated for only a moment before weighing the pros and cons. Bowing deeply, he said,

"Ignorant of Your Majesty's celestial might, I foolishly resisted. I am deeply ashamed and dare not claim any merit. Now, in guarding Mount Liangchuan, I will surely repel the forces of Zhao beyond the mountains and not give Your Majesty cause for concern!"

Hearing these words, Cheng Qian, who stood nearby, was stunned. Li Zhouwei chuckled and said,

"Cheng Qian, you and Daoist Master Jingzhao are to go to Ruzhou."

Cheng Qian nodded in understanding. Lin Chensheng gave him a thoughtful glance before immediately riding the winds away. The tension in Yu Xi's heart finally eased slightly as he heard the King Wei say,

"Guard it well, and I will not let your efforts be in vain. Once matters here are settled, I will personally visit Ruzhou."

Yu Xi nodded repeatedly before departing on the wind. Only then did Li Zhouwei turn aside, where Yin Juexi was already presenting Gongsun Bei's posthumous effects.

Though struck by the same art that had shattered Jiang Fuwang's spiritual armor, Gongsun Bei's armor remained intact, merely dim and lusterless. This was precisely because his armor was of inferior quality; it failed to absorb much of the damage even as its master was grievously wounded and fell. It was nothing like the Jiang clan's artifact, which had allowed Jiang Fuwang, a master of only two divine abilities, to escape.

The other item was the blood axe the general had spent a lifetime refining. His other possessions were a chaotic mess. His storage pouch had exploded during the clash of divine abilities, scattering its contents with his demise. Yin Juexi had managed to recover two spiritual resources from the fields, a Lesser Yang and a Dawn Qi, but the rest were scattered to the winds, fated to become some lucky young cultivator's fortuitous encounter.

'For a dignified mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator, he was certainly destitute.'

He weighed the blood axe in his hand, found it was primarily forged from Dawn Qi and Lesser Yang, and put it away with a hint of regret. He then listened to Yin Juexi's cheerful voice.

"Just as predicted, they surrendered at the first sight of your might, collapsing within days! Congratulations, Your Majesty!"

Although the forces at Luoxia were still insufficient to repel a counterattack from Great Zhao, the overall situation had now stabilized. All they needed to do was placate the Tao clan, secure their position, and wait for reinforcements from Great Song. Everything had gone quite smoothly. Li Zhouwei was in high spirits as he rose into the air on the wind, laughing as he spoke,

"Predicted?"

Although the King Wei before him was smiling, as he uttered that word, Yin Juexi still felt an inexplicable pressure. The Daoist Master lowered his head, followed closely, and said softly,

"When this subordinate was at home… cultivating in the mountains, I once had the honor of hearing the teachings of the Great Daoist Master. Although the venerable senior did not know Your Majesty would launch a surprise attack on Luoxia, he predicted that you would one day come here, and that the local cultivators would surrender at the mere sight of your power…"

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow.

"The Great Daoist Master resides far away in the Southern Sea, yet he understands the political situation of Great Zhao so perfectly?"

"The Daoist Master observes the terrain, not the political situation."

Yin Juexi's expression was grave as he said,

"The Great Daoist Master said… small hills are easily moved, but great mountains are hard to find. Luoxia lacks the grandeur of places like Tangdao or Mount Dali, nor does it have the treacherous terrain of Xiaoshi Mountain or Jingchuan. It has only Mount Liangchuan, and its foundations were severed by someone verifying the Dao, leaving it controlled from a commanding height and perpetually out of the hands of Luoxia's cultivators."

"The spiritual qi from the earth veins is insufficient, making even a Purple Mansion-level grand formation seem weak. This means the cultivators of Luoxia have no foundation for a determined defense. The central plains are rife with conflict—a fertile land, but open to attack from all sides. An enemy may leave today, but a new foe will arrive tomorrow. Its masters cannot hold it for long; they live in constant fear and grievance, and so will readily change their allegiance. With generations of such influence, their descendants have come to see submission as the foremost principle of survival."

"The Qiao and Wei were once subjects of Wei; the Yang and Ju were originally generals of Liang; the Jia and Yu were also once feudal lords. All of them surrendered multiple times before submitting to Zhao. Thus, it is said… 'Those who rely on mountains have integrity; those who settle in the plains have no backbone. From a high position one looks down upon the low; from a humble position one is persuaded to surrender.' This is the Submissive Surrender of the Capital Guard, and it is reflected in the divine ability Sorrowful Southern Water. One cannot attack such a place without careful consideration."

Li Zhouwei gave him a smile, a hint of admiration in his eyes, and said:

"A descendant of the martial Yin clan, your heritage is not lost. Tell me, this Yinling, do you see it as high or low?"

Yin Juexi replied softly:

"I fear the issue is one of discordant hearts, not of terrain."

Li Zhouwei laughed heartily, his curiosity toward the Great Daoist Master he had never met growing. He gave one last look at the dark, somber landscape and said:

"Let us go. Accompany me to Yinling."
