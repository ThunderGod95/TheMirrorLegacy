# Chapter 1281: A Request for Sanctuary

Xiao Chuting seemed to guess his thoughts, shaking his head with a smile.

"The Pit Water Mansion's reserves are depleted. Since I cultivate Pit Water, I have some understanding of Mansion Water... This Mansion Water is now flawed, with only four divine abilities available for cultivation, yet the difficulty of seeking the Dao has not decreased. Chen Yin used the Secret Method of the Submerged Flood Dragon Seeking Transformation and still failed to succeed. His journey ends here."

His tone was level, but it was a cold sentence that declared Chen Yin's path to the Dao severed. Li Zhouwei, who had his own suspicions, spoke quietly.

"He cultivates Mansion Water and is indeed stuck at the threshold of three divine abilities. I must ask you, senior, to explain the origin of this so-called immortal threshold of the Purple Mystery."

Xiao Chuting was not surprised, knowing that he too was at the stage of three divine abilities and stuck at the Purple Mystery. He simply said in a low voice, 

"The word 'comprehend' here means to add, to combine, to perceive, and to awaken. Verifying the Auxiliary Position is 'to add.' Verifying the Intercalary Position is 'to combine.' Verifying the Fruition Attainment is 'to perceive,' and verifying the Dao is 'to awaken.' This one word, 'comprehend,' brings together the Fruition Attainment, the Intercalary Position, the Auxiliary Position, and one's own self. The true subtlety lies in how 'comprehend' also alludes to the number three in 'three divine abilities.' Thus, to comprehend the Purple Mystery is to verify the Golden Core!"

"This so-called immortal threshold of the Purple Mystery is, in fact, deeply connected to the act of verifying the Dao during the Quest for Gold. Anyone with true understanding will pause here to comprehend their own path, daring not to advance recklessly!"

He smiled.

"At its root, the issue is the resonance between a divine ability and its corresponding position—what people often call destiny, something that can be neither seen nor touched!"

Li Zhouwei sank into deep thought, while the old man raised his hand, holding up three fingers as he spoke quietly.

"The essence of a divine ability is its resonance with a position. To use an imperfect analogy, say a cultivator possesses the Converging Water divine ability. This ability can resonate separately with the Auxiliary Position, the Fruition Attainment, and the Intercalary Position, thereby granting all kinds of miraculous powers."

"These three positions in turn pull upon the divine ability, like three Spirit Beasts drawing it forward. Together they form a chariot, and the ruts it leaves in its wake are the cultivator's Dao."

The old man stated calmly, "Some say the Fruition Attainment is a dragon, the Intercalary Position a phoenix, and the Auxiliary Position a tiger. Others claim they are a stallion, a mare, and a foal. Each tradition has its own interpretation; in truth, the conditions differ, and there are more than just these three paths, but they can generally be classified into one of these three."

"When a divine ability is still shallow, it is pure yet incomplete, aligning with the Auxiliary Position, which provides the initial force. As the divine ability matures, the Auxiliary Position's influence wanes, but the ability is now half-formed and poised for transformation, aligning with the Intercalary Position, which in turn provides new impetus. By the time the divine ability nears completion, the Intercalary Position's focus is divided, creating the perfect opportunity to attract the notice of the Fruition Attainment!"

"This is the path to achieving the Dao within the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao—a truly ingenious method!"

Xiao Chuting sighed in admiration, then added regretfully, "But the three beasts do not work in harmony. The Fruition Attainment pulls straight forward, exerting the most effort. The Auxiliary Position keeps pace, but it is always stopping and starting. The Intercalary Position, meanwhile, strays ever farther afield, at times even changing its direction completely."

"The further one advances, the more pronounced this phenomenon becomes, and thus cultivation grows ever more difficult."

His explanation was strikingly novel, causing Li Zhouwei's eyes to brighten. The old man, however, continued in a somber tone.

"Until you reach three divine abilities."

"A cultivator might pursue the orthodox path to the Dao by verifying both the Fruition and Auxiliary positions. They might follow the path of Three Alike, Two Different to exclusively seek an Intercalary Position, or the path of Four Alike, One Different to seek both Auxiliary and Intercalary positions. What all these paths have in common is that they involve three native divine abilities. At the critical juncture of three divine abilities, the Fruition Attainment's steed still charges straight ahead, the Auxiliary Position's steed falters, and the Intercalary Position's steed—now at the peak of its strength—has already turned around, stubbornly marching in a different direction."

"And so, the chariot veers off course and grinds to a halt. As this manifests within the Shengyang Mansion, the three divine abilities stagnate and cease to move, rendering the entire Shengyang Mansion as placid and unmoving as a pool of dead water."

As he spoke, the Pit Water divine ability in the air shifted and trembled ceaselessly. The old man continued, "At this point, if the next divine ability a cultivator attempts to form is another native one, the constant interference from the Intercalary Position will lead to repeated failures, though success is still possible. But what if they instead consider the Intercalary path and try to cultivate a divine ability from another Dao?"

"Then the Auxiliary and Fruition positions will obstruct them in unison. Their combined force is greater than that of the Intercalary Position alone, making it utterly impossible to proceed—a difficulty piled upon another difficulty!"

A sharp light flashed in Li Zhouwei's eyes.

"So that's why… cultivators know full well that Three Alike, Two Different is the ancient grand path to verifying the Intercalary Position, yet they almost always choose the road of Four Alike, One Different! It's because the former is simply too difficult!"

"King Wei is truly perceptive!"

Xiao Chuting clapped his hands and sighed, then said, "Of course, there are also cultivators with no hope of verifying the Dao who take shortcuts. Seeing that the Auxiliary Position can no longer pull them forward or that their path is severed, they resort to a lesser road. They cultivate a divine ability from another Dao, attempting to prematurely activate the Intercalary Position's power to gain at least one more divine ability!"

With this single metaphor, Xiao Chuting had not only explained the Purple Mystery but had also resolved several of Li Zhouwei's long-held questions, leaving him speechless as a thunderstorm of realization raged in his mind.

‘So that's how it is!’

His Dao-Profundity was immense, and with just this single point of clarity, his mind was flooded with understanding.

‘If that's the case, then beyond one's own aptitude, Dao-Profundity, and disposition, the order in which one cultivates the first three divine abilities must also influence how easily one can cross the Purple Mystery threshold!’

‘If I were to cultivate a divine ability like Position Arising from Entanglement, one clearly favored by the Fruition Attainment, it would likely spur the stallion onward with greater force, while also weakening the Intercalary Position… Making it easier to cross the Purple Mystery… but harder to achieve the Intercalary Position…’

His gaze burned as he lifted his head to look directly at Xiao Chuting, a smile spreading on his face.

"So… the reason for your incredibly fast cultivation over the past century is because the Pit Water is in a state of overflow, making it exceptionally potent, and because you cultivated the Position Follows Peril divine ability!"

Xiao Chuting brought his palms together.

"Precisely!"

The understanding in King Wei's eyes grew ever clearer, though his tone took on a peculiar edge.

"The orthodox path of Bright Yang surely lies with World's Radiance and Imperial Observation of the Origin. It is said World's Radiance must be cultivated last, so… if this King had cultivated Imperial Observation of the Origin, the Purple Mystery would be somewhat easier. As I have cultivated neither, it must seem to the world that I too face some difficulty with the Purple Mystery."

Xiao Chuting nodded lightly.

"As for Chen Yin… it was because the Auxiliary and Fruition positions of his Mansion Water were weak that he was guided toward the Vast Ocean. But it seems the damage was too severe; no guidance would have helped at that point!"

"Thank you for your guidance, senior."

Li Zhouwei stared at the old man for a long moment, a vague sense dawning on him that his breakthrough was not as impossible as it had seemed. King Wei then stood, his gaze brilliant, and walked down the steps, vacating the seat of honor before finally asking quietly,

"Senior Xiao… whom do you serve now?"

His words were direct, leaving no room for evasion. The old man considered this for a moment before finally replying.

"The True Monarch resides in Cangzhou. His Daoist name is Xuan Cang, and his title is True Monarch of the Northern Sea's Profound Mansion, Deepener of Fate."

The title of a True Monarch!

The moment this title was spoken, it was as if a great resonance shook the hall. Vague images appeared: of profound ice dissolving, of rivers emerging from mountain ranges, of a great river flowing upon the Dao, of Flood Dragons dwelling in lakes, of the Northern Sea surging, and of a great abyss sinking into darkness!

Li Zhouwei's expression slowly changed, his gaze growing deep.

‘Xuan Cang?’

‘True Monarch of the Northern Sea's Profound Mansion, Deepener of Fate?’

A glimmer of understanding sparked within him, and he whispered, "The Dao lineager?"

Xiao Chuting shook his head, his gaze dark beneath his conical hat.

"Mansion Water."

Those two words were like a phantom, creeping up the shadows of the hall with a bone-deep chill, as if to devour the old man who stood amidst the Pit Water.

A chill entered Li Zhouwei's eyes.

Li Zhouwei could have understood if anyone else had helped Xiao Chuting achieve the Dao, but for it to be a Mansion Water True Monarch! There were still True Monarchs of Mansion Water!

The old man looked straight at him.

"The True Monarch is in an Intercalary Position and has been injured and dormant for many years. Back when the Northern Sea's sky tore open, the various positions deliberately shattered the celestial vault, causing the sea to surge upward. This led to the Pit Water overflowing in Cangzhou—this overflow is the so-called excess. Using the entire Northern Sea as their board, they finally wounded Him to His core, which is what startled Him into revealing Himself to the world."

‘Shattering the celestial vault.’

Li Zhouwei's golden pupils shone.

"This was a deliberate act."

Xiao Chuting's conical hat was pulled down low, completely obscuring his face. Only then could his voice be heard, as deep and cold as ice.

"Correct. A deliberate act."

"Pristine Water and the Dragon-kin, at the very least, acted with intent. And of course… there was that Zhibei True Monarch."

Li Zhouwei's eyes gleamed, perhaps understanding what the old man meant earlier about having support from Mansion Water to return the Vast Ocean. Even someone like him could not help but feel a sense of strangeness at this moment.

"You are coordinating with True Monarch Xuan Cang to return the Vast Ocean?"

Xiao Chuting's voice was slightly hoarse.

"There is something King Wei does not know. Most of the current chaos among the Dao Lineages has a reason behind it. Truly returning the Vast Ocean would destroy the Dragon-kin's ten-thousand-year scheme and uproot the True Dragons' foundation. That Golden Core peak expert would act with complete abandon… not even caring about Mount Luoxia or the Underworld!"

"If He and Cultivation Transcendence True Monarch were to strike together, my body and soul would be annihilated on the spot. I would surely die!"

"Furthermore, Lord Xuan Cang is not in a Fruition Attainment; he lacks the ability to reclaim the Vast Ocean in one go. He can only borrow its power for a short time!"

Li Zhouwei frowned.

"Then the True Monarch's current state is…?"

Xiao Chuting finally looked up, his gaze distant.

"His Dao-Profundity is immense, but he is on the verge of perishing. Yet he still has the will for one last battle. The original plan was for me to verify my Dao and resonate with the Pit Water position. He has his own methods to borrow the Vast Ocean from it and fight the assembled cultivators. If he fails, it is only death!"

"The Secret Method of the Submerged Flood Dragon Seeking Transformation was His means of probing for contact!"

His expression was bleak.

"And while he borrows the Vast Ocean for the great battle, the Pit Water position will temporarily cease its overflow, which is the perfect opportunity for me to achieve the Dao! When he falls and the Vast Ocean returns, the Pit Water position will still be the Pit Water position! As for me… I can only pray for good fortune!"

Li Zhouwei said, "Is this what that lord and you, senior, discussed personally?"

The old man adjusted his conical hat, slowly shaking his head as he spoke softly.

"Not entirely—I only learned half from him. The other half came from the Dragon-kin."

Li Zhouwei's gaze sharpened instantly.

"You've met with the Dragon-kin?"

Xiao Chuting nodded frankly and said, "The Dragon-kin said… this is merely True Monarch Xuan Cang's final gamble before death. They can refrain from interfering in my attainment of the Dao if, upon ascending to the Pit Water position, I give them a promise in return."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow at him and watched as the old man continued.

"Should I succeed, I am to maintain the overflow on their behalf, and it must belong to Azure Profoundity. Only when the True Dragon has achieved its destiny can the Vast Ocean be returned to support the Mansion Water, at which point I am to stand with them."

The old Daoist Master smiled.

"A Dragon King from the Dragon-kin came and made it clear to me that even if I ascend to the Pit Water position, I would not be willing to lose the Vast Ocean before reaching the peak of the Golden Core realm myself."

King Wei's expression turned somewhat grim.

"And that's all?"

"That is all."

Xiao Chuting replied evenly, but Li Zhouwei stared at him intently and said,

"Do you believe them, senior?"

Li Zhouwei absolutely refused to believe it!

Li Zhouwei himself had encountered the Dragon-kin, had seen those duplicitous Dragon Princes and Dragon Kings. He, Li Zhouwei, had not even touched upon the True Dragons' core interests and had already faced such repeated betrayals, let alone Xiao Chuting!

‘For a magnificent True Monarch, a True Monarch of infinite divine ability, to make such an arrangement for his affairs after death with a mere Purple Mansion cultivator is already bizarre enough, but to also trust the words of the Dragon-kin?’

More importantly, this was a clear act of invading the Pit Water's domain and aiding an enemy. Yet the Dragon-kin, the Yue Cultivating Sect, and even Pristine Water, the original perpetrators, were content to sit by and watch. They were willing to place the possibility of returning the Vast Ocean into another's hands, allowing Xiao Chuting to travel all the way south from the Northern Sea to Jiangnan!

‘What kind of joke is this!’

Compared to that, Li Zhouwei would sooner believe this True Monarch had some other agenda, that he was cooperating with the Dragon-kin and the Yue Cultivating Sect to use Xiao Chuting to advance some scheme and escape his perilous situation!

He also refused to believe that Xiao Chuting harbored no doubts!

The old man stood silently in the great hall. Meeting his gaze, he gave a soundless smile and said calmly,

"King Wei must think I am bargaining with a tiger. You are correct. Even though they claim my ascension to the Pit Water position to maintain the overflow is beneficial to both the Dragon-kin and the Yue Cultivating Sect, and that I will inevitably collude with them in the end, I do not believe a word of it…"

"I know what they want to do."

The old man stepped forward and said quietly, "Killing Xuan Cang is absolutely beneficial for the Dragon-kin's goal of eliminating the last remnant lake of Mansion Water. They can't wait for True Monarch Xuan Cang to leave his sanctuary; the sooner he comes out for a grand, decisive battle with them, the better."

"And as for me, Xiao Chuting?"

The smile on his face was cold and sarcastic.

"Naturally, I am not meant to succeed. But if I do, all the better for them!"

"The Dragon-kin have held dominion for ten thousand years; they have likely never killed a Pit Water True Monarch before! They have only managed to bring about the sign of Converging Water in the Pit Water… They would be overjoyed to have a newly emerged early-stage Golden Core cultivator like me, one detested by Mount Luoxia, disliked by the Supreme Yang, unseen by the Underworld, and utterly without support!"

"The mainland just happens to have the Yue Cultivating Sect to help them, so I won't be out of their reach. They will certainly drive me beyond the heavens, forcing me to carry the overflowing Pit Water to my death in a dragon's maw!"

He laughed.

"That is the real reason the Dragon-kin are willing to let me be, and even secretly help me achieve the Dao!"

Hearing this, Li Zhouwei understood everything. His golden eyes shifted, and a rare look of emotion appeared on King Wei's face. His voice was slightly hoarse as he said,

"But Senior Xiao still intends to verify his Dao."

"Of course!"

The old man before him, however, lifted his head and let out a chilling laugh from his throat.

"To verify my Dao and then die, I would still be the Pit Water True Monarch, Xiao Chuting! I would be a True Monarch who fell under the combined assault of Dragon Monarchs at the peak of the Golden Core realm!"

"What's more, the one that truly made me resolve myself was Moongaze Lake!"

The chill in Li Zhouwei's expression gradually faded, replaced by a contemplative look.

"In that case, what does Senior Xiao need from the Lake?"

With this question, they finally arrived at the most critical topic. Xiao Chuting's expression grew solemn. He took a step forward, prostrated himself on the ground, and performed a grand ceremony of three bows and nine kowtows toward the main seat.

"Your Excellency took action back then to secretly guide this humble cultivator. I am eternally grateful. For all these years, there has been no call to serve, so it must have been for this very day!"

These words carried immense weight, causing Li Zhouwei to hold his breath and close his eyes for an instant.

The great hall fell into absolute silence, all light seeming to dim. Outside, the scenery was beautiful, the moon bright and clear, but the old man paid it no mind. His expression was sincere, his voice growing lower.

"Xiao Chuting has traveled all this way, seeking nothing else. I seek only a sanctuary!"
