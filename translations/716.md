# Chapter 716: Wenhu

Li Zhouwei hoped that the clan's core members could spend more time on their cultivation. People like Li Minggong and Li Chenghui had already lost years to other duties. The matter of Mount Qingdu had been unavoidable, but everything else felt like a waste of their precious time.

'Of the old Moongaze Lake families, the Yu had a noble ancestry, but their main line was extinct. Fortunately, we gained the An family, who have become a cornerstone of our strength. The Fei family, on the other hand, never had a strong foundation and struggled to produce Foundation Establishment cultivators. As vassals, they were always a step removed.'

The An patriarch, his son, and even his grandsons all held respectable positions within the Li clan. An Siwei was even the first outsider to reach Foundation Establishment under their banner. Their loyalty was unquestionable, but relying so heavily on another family was not a good long-term solution.

Li Zhouwei had been keeping this in mind. As they flew, he took note of the size of each city and the number of cultivators present, making a quick calculation.

"The White Ye Immortal Sect must know by now," he said. "Their spirit vessel can be here in less than fifteen minutes!"

Li Zhouwei had discussed this with Li Ximing beforehand. As a Purple Mansion cultivator, Li Ximing's attitude toward Wenhu had been remarkably lenient, making it clear that he wished to avoid conflict and settle matters peacefully.

The Capital immortals Dao had likely not anticipated the Li clan's sudden, explosive attack. But considering their strange and unpredictable arts, it was safest to assume they had known the moment the assault began.

Li Chenghui nodded. "Fifteen minutes... That's only enough time for us to capture two more mountains. Once the Capital immortals Dao arrives, regardless of how they react, we'll be forced into a stalemate. The borders will be redrawn, and it will be much harder to make a move in the future."

The Capital immortals Dao was a Purple Mansion sect that had relocated from the Eastern Sea, a far cry from the cultivators of Dense Cloud Cave. Wenhu, the most formidable figure in the entire cave, would only be considered a "Peak Lord" in the Capital immortals Dao. Miaoshui was nothing more than a guest retainer.

'Two more mountains...'

Even if they took two more mountains, they would only control forty percent of the territory—not enough to split the region evenly with the Capital immortals Dao. That wasn't good enough for Li Zhouwei. And that was only the first problem.

"Furthermore... the Ding family is at the foot of Hongfu Mountain, the main peak of Dense Cloud Cave..."

When Floating Cloud Cave was breached, the Ding family—a local power with over ten thousand members—had been captured and relocated to Hongfu Mountain. Ding Weizeng was destined to become one of the clan's key commanders, and it wouldn't do to have his people in enemy hands.

Seeing Li Zhouwei's frown, Li Chenghui, who was well aware of the situation, said gravely, "If we can take Hongfu Peak, seventy percent of the territory will be ours."

"Taking it would be ideal. If you and I went together, my aunt and An Siwei could capture the two mountains behind us. But if we fail and get pinned down deep in their territory, we'll be in trouble!"

Li Zhouwei possessed a Purple Mansion-grade talisman called the Xuanqin Baoyou, which could summon a divine ability to protect him. With it, he could move freely through Jiangbei. The talisman was a gift from Daoist Master Yuanwu to Yu Muxian. After the Li clan killed Yu Muxian, it had fallen into their hands.

At the time, only two cultivators in the Azure Pond Sect were skilled enough in the Dao of talismans to have reached the Purple Mansion Realm. One was Chi Wei, whose cultivation of Pristine Water aided his craft, and the other was Daoist Master Yuanxiu, who came from a long line of talisman masters. Li Xuanfeng had asked Daoist Master Yuanxiu about the talisman, and he had recognized it as his own work, as they had both studied under the same master. Thus, Li Zhouwei now had a Purple Mansion talisman at his disposal. Even if surrounded, he could escape. Li Chenghui, however, could not.

As he spoke, the Great Void rippled, and a heroic figure with a swallow's jaw and a bristling beard emerged. He was tall and powerfully built, with the broad back and muscular waist of a tiger, and clad in crimson soft armor, exuding a formidable aura.

"Greetings, Clan Lord!"

Li Ximing's decision to send Ding Weizeng was a timely relief! Li Zhouwei laughed heartily. "Congratulations, Weizeng!"

"This subordinate does not dare accept such praise!"

Ding Weizeng was built like a tiger, a full head taller than the men beside him. Li Zhouwei knew that Li Ximing must have healed his injuries, and he was thrilled. But this was no time for idle talk.

"With you here, Weizeng, I'm confident we can succeed! Clan Uncle, Aunt Minggong, you will lead our forces and secure the rear. Weizeng and I will make a lightning raid on Hongfu Mountain and rescue the Ding family!"

He sheathed his great halberd. Ding Weizeng was stunned by the order, only then realizing his entire family had been taken to Hongfu Mountain. He was deeply moved, but he still advised caution. "Clan Lord, Hongfu Mountain is defended by four Foundation Establishment cultivators, including Wenhu and Wang He. They are not to be underestimated, and they have a Foundation Establishment-grade array. For the two of us to go alone is too risky."

Li Zhouwei gestured toward Miaoshui. "We'll have her, too," he said with a smile.

Ding Weizeng frowned but still summoned a gust of wind to carry them eastward. As they flew at top speed, Li Zhouwei added, "Besides... with the current situation, do you really think all four of them are still guarding Hongfu Mountain? And did I say we were going to launch a direct assault? His Immortal Foundation is Hurricane Ghost Yin. My family cultivates Bright Yang, Thunder, and True Fire. He's walked right into the blade!"

***

"Li Zhouwei broke through Pingshui Hill?"

Wenhu stood on a mountain peak, his expression grim, his heart filled with a terrible unease.

Ever since he learned that Yehui had not gone to the Li clan, Wenhu had maintained a calm exterior, but inwardly he knew things had taken a turn for the worse. The relationship between the Li clan and their backer, the Capital immortals Dao, was bound to sour, and he was caught in the middle. His end would not be a pleasant one.

'What is this madness...'

He was at his wits' end. Though the White Ye Immortal Sect would receive the news no later than he did, he still dispatched a messenger before pacing back and forth in agitation.

'In this situation, my only path is to hold back the Li clan for the Capital immortals Dao for as long as possible!'

His fears from the moment he'd left the Li clan's territory had become reality, but he never thought it would happen so quickly. More tragically, Pingwang Zi's words had also come true.

'A bird seeks a branch, a man seeks a master. There's no chance to play both sides.'

"The men from the White Ye Immortal Sect will be here soon, so I don't have to worry about dying. Right now, no one can stop Li Zhouwei. I have to go myself."

Though he had only been a guest retainer in the Eastern Sea and lacked command experience, he understood the basics of defense. He appointed one person to guard the mountain and took the other two with him as reinforcements.

Wenhu understood deeply that anyone in Dense Cloud Cave could surrender to the Li clan except him. He had been personally recruited by Daoist Master Yehui. The others served him; he served a Purple Mansion cultivator.

'Purple Mansion cultivators are beings on high. There's nothing they can't negotiate. All this territory is just a bargaining chip. If I surrender to the Li clan and the two sides make peace, I'll be the one they sacrifice.'

'My only way to survive now is to throw my full support behind the Capital immortals Dao and resist the Li clan. The more ruthless I am, the better my chances of survival. It won't be more than thirty minutes. Li Zhouwei can't kill me in that time!'

Wenhu was, after all, Yehui's man. He had seen more of the world. While Miaoshui needed Li Zhouwei's prompting, he understood the gravity of his situation on his own. He flew out from the mountain and had traveled barely thirty miles when his vision flashed and a sharp pain erupted in his chest.

"Ah!"

Wenhu vaguely saw a shower of sparks and thick white mist rise from his chest, followed by a searing pain. A brilliant light shot toward him from the distance. He quickly pressed down on the wound, swallowed the blood rising in his throat, and roared, "Li Zhouwei!"

The great halberd grew from a distant meteor to fill his vision. A cold sweat broke out on Wenhu's back. He was confident Li Zhouwei couldn't kill him, but that didn't mean he could survive two strikes from this White Qilin after being caught off guard. He hastily clapped his hands together, summoning a stream of pure qi.

As the qi billowed out, Wenhu reappeared dozens of feet away. The wound on his chest was sealed, but his spiritual qi was draining away in waves. He silently gave thanks.

'Thankfully... Bright Yang is a noble, righteous path. Using its Profound Light for a sneak attack diminishes its power... otherwise, that blow would have been devastating...'

The halberd was already stabbing toward his chest. Wenhu had no time for curses. He activated a white jade artifact and threw up a talisman to block the attack. The young man materialized before him, his golden eyes dark and deep.

"You're a clever one," he said with a smile.

"Clang!"

As he spoke, the halberd slammed into the artifact, shattering the talisman's protective light. The white jade artifact groaned under the strain. Wenhu had specifically bought it after the True Monarch's ascension, and it had indeed proven its worth. He spat out a mouthful of black gas.

"Hoo!"

A gale tore through the forest, thick with black, sinister qi. The light rain falling from the sky seemed to empower his Immortal Foundation, Hurricane Ghost Yin, and frost began to form on the ground.

But Wenhu felt no confidence.

The reason was simple: the Li clan's patriarch had achieved the Purple Mansion Realm through the Bright Yang Dao!

As expected, Li Zhouwei simply drew a small flag from his sleeve and tossed it into the air. In an instant, the wind died and the rain stopped. Five-colored Li Fire—ochre, pale yellow, canary yellow, bright red, and crimson—leapt into existence, bathing the area in brilliant light and burning away the yin energy.

Wenhu felt a wave of helplessness, but at least he had bought a moment. His two subordinates quickly gathered around him. One of them, Wang He, held a feather fan and was Wenhu's most capable officer. His face was etched with apprehension.

Before Wenhu could feel any relief, a reddish-bronze halo appeared. The brawny, bearded warrior materialized in mid-air, a cold sneer on his face, his eyes locked onto them.

"Ding! Wei! Zeng!"

For the first time, Wenhu's mind went completely blank. He instantly understood what had happened. The black qi swirled in his hands, but he could only watch as Ding Weizeng, his expression like ice, slammed a palm down, crushing Wang He. The man stood in the air like a great tiger, watching its prey.

In that instant, envy, jealousy, and terror flooded Wenhu's heart.

Honestly, Wenhu had not wanted to offend the Li clan, nor the Capital immortals Dao behind him. He knew he wasn't even a pawn in their game; the slightest displeasure from either side would result in a miserable end for him.

That was why he hadn't stayed to defend Hongfu Mountain!

Did he not know that holding the mountain was the strategy that would incur the fewest losses? With four men defending the array, no matter how fiercely Li Zhouwei attacked, they would lose no more than half their territory. If Hongfu Mountain held, when the Capital immortals Dao arrived, the Li clan would gain no advantage in the region.

But Yehui had many enemies within the Capital immortals Dao. If Wenhu just sat in the mountain like a dead man, those stubborn purists in the sect would surely speak out. He had to be seriously injured, and losing territory was an expected outcome—after all, his opponent was a Purple Mansion clan, and the attacker was Li Zhouwei himself.

However, if he defended the mountain to the last, the Li clan's interests would be severely hampered, and they would hate him for it. Wenhu had no desire to provoke the Purple Mansion cultivator Zhaojing or the future Purple Mansion cultivator Li Zhouwei. Ceding Hongfu Mountain was the only way to satisfy them.

Thus, between the crime of incompetence and the crime of cowardice and treachery, he had chosen the former.

In his scenario, Miaoshui would most likely surrender. Li Zhouwei would seize the opportunity to occupy the mountain, then turn to besiege him. He would be gravely wounded, and then rescued by the Capital immortals Dao. How the two clans divided the territory afterward would have nothing to do with him. That was the only way to avoid offending either side!

But Li Zhouwei had cornered him here... and Ding Weizeng, the man he had looked down upon, had become a formidable general of the Li clan!

Wenhu nearly lost his composure. He couldn't stop the bitter thought from rising in his heart.

'A hundred cunning schemes are no match for a handsome face and a powerful lineage. A thousand careful calculations cannot compare to a fate that turns disaster into fortune!'

But he was a rogue cultivator who had risen to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the disciples of great sects. His willpower was extraordinary. He instantly regained his clarity. Though the Profound Light searing his body sent up wisps of green smoke, he grit his teeth and did his best to parry Li Zhouwei's halberd.

In terms of pure cultivation, Wenhu was far superior to Li Zhouwei, having already broken through to the late stage of Foundation Establishment. With a different Dao foundation, he might have been able to fight the White Qilin to a standstill.

But now, his artifacts and techniques were inferior, his Immortal Foundation was completely suppressed, and he had been wounded from the start. His spiritual qi flowed with difficulty, and he could only rely on his vast experience and deep reserves to barely hold on.

Li Zhouwei had no time to waste. He formed a hand seal, pointing his index finger forward. A hint of sunlight pierced through the clouds, and a brilliant light gathered at his fingertip.

"Sun's Resonant Parting Art!"

The Sun's Resonant Parting Art was an art of endless variations. At this moment, it reflected the sunlight, seizing control of the jade shield. The dark silhouette of the great halberd plunged toward the wound on Wenhu's chest.

But Wenhu was no ordinary man. He bit down hard on his tongue and spat out a mouthful of essence blood. A roaring sound erupted from his mouth as a torrent of deep black light shot toward Li Zhouwei, shattering the Profound Light around him.

For the first time, a look of surprise crossed Li Zhouwei's face.

"The Great Wind of the Abyssal Depths?"

This was not, of course, the true Great Wind of the Abyssal Depths, famed for its ability to disarm opponents. Wenhu had only managed to imitate some of its profound power using his Hurricane Ghost Yin foundation, but it was enough to catch an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator off guard and cause Li Zhouwei to pause for a fraction of a second.

But Li Zhouwei was familiar with this wind. The Great Wind of the Abyssal Depths from his clan's Chongming Profound Insight Screen was far more powerful. That artifact, however, had an extraordinary origin and was currently in Li Ximing's possession.

He broke free with a slight struggle, and the great wind lost its source. Although Wenhu hadn't expected him to escape so quickly, his next spell was already complete. A black light coalesced around him.

"By my decree!" he said coldly.

A blast of black light erupted, stirring up a hurricane of ghostly qi. A light shone from between Li Zhouwei's brows as Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light flew out to meet it. The two attacks collided with a deafening roar.

"Boom!"

Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light effortlessly obliterated the black light and slammed into the distant Wenhu, who was still controlling his jade shield. The shield billowed with white smoke and was covered in cracks. Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes, his golden gaze sweeping the area.

'A fine technique!'

He took a step north, leaving Wenhu behind. The great halberd shone with celestial light as he thrust it into the empty air. A muffled cry of pain was heard as a figure was forced out of hiding, his face covered in blood. Who could it be but Wenhu?

"To cultivate a minor foundation like Hurricane Ghost Yin to such a degree... you're quite the talent!"
