# Chapter 467: Li Wushao

Fei Luoya finally departed, and after waiting for a few moments, Li Yuanjiao saw a man flying in from the distant valley. It was Yuan Chengdun, with his two short rods strapped to his back. He landed beside Li Yuanjiao who cupped his fist in greeting.

"Thank you, Fellow Daoist!"

Yuan Chengdun laughed heartily and replied, "I could not stray too far without securing the pill! If that fellow had any ill intentions and something happened, I would have no way to explain myself."

Understanding his point, Li Yuanjiao took out the Essence Gathering Pill and handed it over. Yuan Chengdun then revealed two jade slips, saying warmly, "These are our clan's secret techniques... Please ensure they are used only within your clan and not disseminated indiscriminately."

"Of course," Li Yuanjiao nodded in agreement, adding, "In a few days, my younger sister will come to Mushroom Forest Plain. I'll have to trouble your esteemed clan to look after her."

Impressed by Yuan Chengdun's formidable strength, Li Yuanjiao had kept the earlier events in mind. He recalled Fei Luoya's words, and with a smile, he said, "Your strength is truly remarkable... I greatly admire you. If I encounter any difficulties in the future, might I call upon you for assistance, fellow Daoist?"

Yuan Chengdun nodded steadily and replied, "Your son is a disciple under my aunt's tutelage, and our families have been allies for many years. There is no need for formalities; just call on me if needed. A good fight followed by sharing the spoils is always welcome."

"Great! Many thanks in advance, fellow Daoist!"

Li Yuanjiao now recognized Yuan Chengdun as a generous and honorable man, a rare genius of the Yuan Family. They exchanged a few warm words, leaving each with a favorable impression before parting ways.

As Li Yuanjiao flew onward, he thought to himself, This man has a grand bearing, a true hero! To have broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm at thirty-seven is indeed quite impressive.

Reflecting on Yuan Huyuan's complaints, he sighed, "What a pity though. Had he been born five hundred years earlier, the Yuan Family might have secured a place among the three sects and seven gates... But having been born five hundred years late, he can only protect them for a period of time."

As Li Yuanjiao flew on, he carefully reread the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique manual, noting that the last part referenced the Daoist Master Profound Goat which eased some of his doubts.

In the end, with Yuan Su, Xiao Chuting, and possibly Mount Dali supporting us, the balance of power is maintained... The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are unlikely to harbor ill intentions toward us as long as we pick our immortal foundation carefully.

Instead, it is the Buddhist cultivators manipulating fate that are the real danger.

In this grand chessboard of Purple Mansion and Maha, the moves of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were visible and could be guarded against. But when Maha wanted to kill, it was nearly impossible to defend against them once one's fate was sealed.

Ultimately, it's just a concealment technique... nothing too earth-shattering.

He then took out the storage pouch from the pig demon and sifted through its contents before finally letting out a sigh.

"A poor pig indeed..."

The pouch mostly contained various spirit materials with very few Spirit Stones—only thirty-two in total, leaving Li Yuanjiao speechless.

"My family is not part of the three sects and seven gates. The pig demon's belongings had already been promised to the demon fox to smooth things over with the demon den, leaving little for anything extra..."

Dragging the Foundation Establishment Realm pig demon back to the mountain, Li Yuanjiao sealed the creature as usual and handed it over to the clan's cultivators for safekeeping. He then descended to the riverside where his spiritual sense swept over the area, quickly locating the Hooked Serpent.

The Hooked Serpent had an enormous iron shackle forged from ebony ore around its neck with iron chains piercing its body. Its originally dark scales were now caked with mud, appearing black and brown as it lay in the muck like a fallen giant tree.

An Zheyan was sitting cross-legged in midair and was surrounded by the Jade Court Guards, who were the elite among those at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Each of them was holding a metal chain in hand, standing quietly.

"Ancestor!"

An Zheyan quickly rose to his feet when he saw Li Yuanjiao approaching.

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly and asked, "You have reached the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm... Do you have plans to establish your foundation?"

Since the fall of the An Family, An Zheyan had been cultivating with increasing diligence, following the guidance of his wife, Li Feiruo, and had settled comfortably within the Li Family. Over the past twenty-four years, he had attained the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Hearing Li Yuanjiao's question, he sighed and replied, "I am already one hundred and nine years old... Though I have made considerable progress over the past decade, I know my limits. I'm not made for Foundation Establishment Realm. I do not wish to risk my life either; I only seek a peaceful old age."

"Hmm."

Li Yuanjiao's gaze moved from An Zheyan to the Hooked Serpent. The snake demon opened its massive, human head-sized black eyes, and with a clattering of the ebony chains, it moved its head closer in a fawning manner and said, "Exalted Immortal! You're here, Exalted Immortal! This humble demon has been waiting for so long... What are your orders?"

Li Yuanjiao asked, "This Dao foundation of yours, Morning Cold Rain... Which type of metallic essence is it associated with?"

The Hooked Serpent hesitated for a moment, fear flashing across its face.

"I-It's... It's... of the Mansion Water system," it finally said.

Mansion Water?

Li Yuanjiao's interest was instantly piqued, but the Hooked Serpent cried out in terror, "Spare me, Exalted Immortal! Small serpents like me number in the hundreds, if not thousands, in the Eastern Sea. My Dao foundation is impure and unfit for consumption... it would only fetch a low price!"

Seeing the serpent's fearful demeanor, Li Yuanjiao suddenly recalled something Xiao Yuansi had once said—

Dao foundations of the same system can be consumed by one another, but it will sever the path to the Purple Mansion Realm... However, it offers a unique advantage over the ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. No wonder this Hooked Serpent is so terrified... it fears I will sell it to an immortal cultivator of the Mansion Water system!

This serpent hails from overseas and is a demon. Without the three sects and seven gates withholding information to maintain better control over their cultivators, there's much knowledge I can extract from it!

Feeling a sudden surge of excitement, Li Yuanjiao quickly asked, "How many metallic essences exist in the water system? What are their names? How many of them are incomplete?"

The Hooked Serpent, eager to please, quickly responded with a smile, "According to what I have heard from the Serpent Dragon Palace... this type of Golden Core Fruition Attainments is collectively known as the Water Virtue, consisting of what is referred to as the Five Waters—Pit, Valley, Pristine, Converge, and Mansion. Currently, only Pit Water and Mansion Water have yet to be claimed. Exalted Immortal, your dragon serpent belongs to the Pit Water system... consuming me won't do you any good."

"I see!"

Feeling enlightened, Li Yuanjiao realized, Pit Water... that's the metallic essence Xiao Chuting was looking for!

He continued his line of questioning, asking, "If that is the case, where are the Valley, Pristine, and Converge Waters located?"

The Hooked Serpent quickly answered, "Pristine Water had been claimed long ago by a True Monarch from the Azure Chi Devil Gate. Converge Water has always belonged to the Serpent Dragon Palace, but as for Valley Water... this lowly demon does not know. I only know that the position is occupied..."

"Good."

Li Yuanjiao was pleased to uncover such secrets and pressed on, "Do you know the full names of these metallic essences?"

"This humble one lacks a strong background and only knows bits and pieces... I am only aware of the five Fruition Attainments of the Water Virtue. There are also five Fruition Attainments for the Fire Virtue..."

The Hooked Serpent continued stammering, "I-I have heard rumors that within the mainland, there are Three Gold with Fruition Attainments fully realized, leading to the flourishing of the Golden Stone system. Ebony Copper Essence and cold metal are now abundant, their Sharp Qi so potent that even common folk can afford to use iron tools and armor..."

Upon hearing this, a figure in white suddenly flashed in Li Yuanjiao's mind, and he was startled.

"That Wang Xun from back then... so he's truly the descendant of a Golden Core Realm Immortal!"

Back in the day when Wang Xun had visited the Li Family, he mentioned that the Wang Family's ancestor was the leader of the Mainland's Three Gold. Li Yuanjiao had only been half-convinced and skeptical, thinking that only three Golden Core Realm cultivators were left on the mainland.

But now, upon reflection, these Three Gold were not three Golden Core Realm cultivators, but rather referring to the three Golden Stone Fruition Attainments!

The Azure Pond Sect alone had a Golden Core Realm cultivator overseeing it, and counting Wu and Yue States, there could be as many as ten Golden Core Realm cultivators on the mainland.

"Good... good!" Li Yuanjiao nodded slowly, his thoughts turning over in his mind.

Suddenly, he leaned closer to the Hooked Serpent and whispered, "Oh? Since you say that the Golden Stone system's Fruition Attainments had been fully realized, then why are there five Fruition Attainments in the Water Virtue, but only three in the Golden Stone?"

The Hooked Serpent was taken aback, having never thought deeply about this before. Caught off guard, it mumbled, "That is true... why is that? Five Waters, Five Fires, yet only Three Golds..."

Finally, it responded, "This lowly one truly does not know! May the Exalted Immortal discern the truth!"

After several rounds of intense questioning, it was clear the Hooked Serpent had no more valuable information to provide. Li Yuanjiao silently observed the serpent for a few moments, his gaze making the creature's scales bristle with fear.

Knowing that this was a moment of life and death, the Hooked Serpent flicked its tongue nervously and pleaded, "This lowly one has struggled to cultivate for a hundred years just to gain sentience. I entered these lands only to seek spirit waters, with no intent to harm anyone. My spirit water, twin hooks, and serpent pearl have all been taken by the Exalted Immortal... Now, I only beg for my life to be spared..."

Li Yuanjiao, deep in thought, considered the matter.

The matter of the Hooked Serpent was entrusted by Kong Tingyun, who is connected to the Profound Peak. They've shown goodwill to our family many times; the situation should be manageable...

He lifted the serpent and said in a low voice, "I can spare your life, but you must serve my family for the rest of your days. I have borrowed a secret method, and you must cooperate in relinquishing your spirituality... Are you willing?"

The Hooked Serpent, relieved to see a way out, quickly responded, "Yes! I am willing!"

Li Yuanjiao adjusted his sleeves as Li Xicheng arrived with a group of Jade Court Guards. Stepping forward, Li Xicheng respectfully greeted, "Second Uncle."

Li Yuanjiao then asked, "How many Spirit Stones remain in the family?"

Li Xicheng quickly replied, "The family's Spirit Stones are primarily reserved for tributes, leaving only fifty extra. The Green Ox River Embrace Formation cost one hundred and fifteen, with eighty sent from Mount Yu to cover the shortfall, leaving a surplus of fifteen Spirit Stones."

Li Yuanjiao fell silent for a moment.

The materials needed to tame this serpent were worth around ninety spirit stones. The family had three of the necessary items, but the rest would have to be purchased from other families.

He took out fifty Spirit Stones and instructed, "These are from my personal savings along with what we gained from slaying the demons. Gather sixty-five more... that should be enough. Bring them to me in a few days."

After a short pause, he added, "Your aunt is going to Mushroom Forest Plain to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Send a few people to accompany her."

Li Qinghong was somewhat apprehensive of the prospect, but Li Yuanjiao had full confidence in her.

————

Snow fell regularly over Moongaze Lake. Qingdu Peak stood tall in the lake's center and was surrounded by several small hills. The blackish-brown stone peaks stood silently as the green formation barrier activated, isolating the area from the outside world.

The Hooked Serpent coiled its deep-black body atop one of the small stone peaks, raising its head and exhaling a series of white breaths that surged upward toward the mountain.

Li Yuanjiao had warned it several times that if the technique failed, it would suffer severe injuries, and the Li Family had no extra elixirs to spare. The serpent, naturally anxious, continued to exhale white breath.

Before long, a beam of white light rose from the mountaintop and pierced through the sky, then imprinted itself on the serpent's head. It was as large as a carriage. A white mark soon appeared and a portion of its spirituality was extracted, which flew toward Li Yuanjiao who was waiting on the mountain patiently.

Li Yuanjiao descended slowly, the Six Dams Life Matching Unique Technique smoothly functioning as expected. The Hooked Serpent, far from showing signs of weakness, was instead brimming with energy and continuously exhaling cold qi, clearly having benefited from the ritual.

"It seems this truly is a spirit material of the Purple Mansion Realm..." Li Yuanjiao mumbled in awe.

The six points of the Six Dams Life Matching formation naturally corresponded to the six types of spirit materials recorded. At the center, Li Yuanjiao placed a Supreme Yin Osmanthus Blossom, filled to the brim with Supreme Yin Moonlight, though much of it had dissipated wastefully.

With a flick of his hand, the Hooked Serpent's Cold Jade Serpent Pearl shot out and into its gaping maw. The serpent's aura surged dramatically, its scales deepening in color, once again exuding the presence of a demon general.

The Hooked Serpent continued exhaling cold air for an hour, its massive eyes flickering with a cold white light for three full breaths before finally calming down. The snake coiled around the mountain, its body shifting, causing a cascade of rocks to tumble down with a series of sharp, cracking sounds.

It took to the air, casting a shadow over the ground, and upon landing, its form shifted into that of a young man dressed in black, with a dark and fierce demeanor. His eyes were narrow, his clothing tight and practical as he cupped his fist and bowed.

"This subordinate greets the master!"

Li Yuanjiao noticed that the serpent's twin tails were still bare and asked, "Can the hooks on your tail grow back?"

The Hooked Serpent's venom was infamous. Even Kong Tingyun needed to borrow an artifact in order to restrain the serpent's tails. Without those poisonous hooks, its strength would be significantly diminished.

The young man in black shook his head repeatedly and answered, "Master, unless I consume some treasured panacea or spirit water, it will take decades for my hooks to regrow..."

Li Yuanjiao frowned and said, "I will keep an eye out for them. Have you ever taken human form before?"

"Never. In the Eastern Sea, such things are not practiced," the young man replied meekly, "I only broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm about ten years ago and spent most of those years in seclusion at Lake Xian..."

Li Yuanjiao squinted at him. The young man's dark, fierce features made him look vicious and threatening, as if he could devour a person at any moment. Li Yuanjiao remarked, "Why do you look like a villain, just like me?"

The young man seemed taken aback by this comment, pausing awkwardly before replying, "My spirituality is in your hands... so it's only natural there's a resemblance."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, feeling pleased that he had gained a Foundation Establishment Realm ally. His mood lifted as he let out a laugh, saying, "Since you have taken human form, it is time to give you a proper name... We cannot keep calling you Hooked Serpent all the time."

The fierce young man lowered his head in acknowledgment. After a moment of thought, Li Yuanjiao said, "You resemble a black branch... Since you have joined my Li Family, I will name you Li Wushao.[1]"

Li Wushao cupped his fist and respectfully replied, "Thank you, Master!"

Li Yuanjiao laughed heartily, thinking to himself, It's better to borrow names from others; otherwise, Qinghong will complain about my naming sense and secretly laugh at me.

With a Foundation Establishment Realm demon cultivator on his side, many things would now be easier to manage. Feeling a sense of relief, Li Yuanjiao instructed Li Wushao, "Go and meet with Xicheng. Let him introduce you to the family members, so you will not mistake friend for foe in the future."

"Yes!" Li Wushao responded, taking flight right away and heading downward. Li Yuanjiao turned and entered the courtyard, picked up a brush, and began writing a letter to Qingsui Peak.

"I will ask Zhi'er about this Fu Daimu and whether he has any backing... If this can be done, I will enlist Yuan Chengdun or Senior Yuan Si to join us, and we will eliminate him with a five-person ambush..." Li Yuanjiao mumbled to himself as he formulated a plan to deal with Fu Daimu.

"This fellow has been in that region for so long; he must have collected quite a few valuable items—treasured panacea, shamanic spells, and even a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact. Killing him would not only remove a threat but also win over Fei Luoya..."

A rare, genuine smile appeared on his face as he thought to himself, Zhi'er... It has been years since his engagement with the Yang Family's daughter. I wonder if they have any children yet... I must ask him about that.
