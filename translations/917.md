# Chapter 917: The Unfathomable Vacancy

His words, a blunt declaration from the heart, settled like a chill over the mountain, casting everyone into silence.

Li Zhouwei stared at him, his focus sharpening. His voice dropped to a low murmur.

"Senior, your sources are truly formidable."

As his words echoed through the mountains, Yehui lowered his head to sip his tea. Li Ximing, who had been silently clenching his cup, spoke up.

"Now that the various factions have made their moves, the North's true intentions are clear. If the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had known this from the start, they wouldn't have suffered such a catastrophic defeat..."

When he finished, Li Zhouwei stared intently at the Daoist Master. Yehui, however, let his lips part in a silent, mocking smile.

"Known from the start? Among the southern cultivators, some knew, some were ignorant, some were clinging to blind luck, and others had their suspicions. But in the end, they *all* went to the Tangdao Mountain Range. I won't mince words—to say that *any* of the southern Daoist traditions were completely in the dark? That is an impossibility!"

A smile bloomed on his face, as bright and warm as the afternoon sun. "Fellow Daoists," he reminded them, "the 'Hengzhu' is one of the most prominent positions in this world!"

Yehui was astonishingly audacious. His words were chilling. He dared to speak what few would dare to hear, all but stating outright that a True Monarch behind the Hengzhu Dao had watched the entire affair unfold, subtly manipulating events from the shadows.

The Six Scions of Chongming studied at Green Pine Temple, inheriting the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. From that single lineage came six True Monarchs. They established their Daoist tradition under the aegis of the closely-allied Moonlight Origin Mansion. Three of those Monarchs remain active to this day, leaving traces of their presence in the world. Taixu and Taiyu have fallen. The only one left—the most unremarkable of them all—is this True Monarch Taizhu.

The Li family had gathered substantial intelligence over the years and had maintained relations with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition for just as long. They had at least some understanding of every True Monarch. Yet, this True Monarch Taizhu alone had remained utterly silent, seemingly never intervening in any affair.

But as Yehui spoke, a tremor ran through Li Ximing. The words of Hengxing echoed in his ears: 'Lin Jianqi was willing to die for this. How many people in this world could do what Lin Jianqi did!'

'If the Hengzhu Dao might have foreseen this, then did Kui Qi also know? That Daoist Master from the Great Xiukui Monastery... what was his true reason for making a stand before the Tangdao Mountain Range!'

Li Ximing sighed internally. As if in sync, Yehui paused and let out a soft sigh of his own.

"If Changxiao truly dares to make a move, it won't just be a conflict with the Hengzhu dao. He'll be facing the entire Supreme Yang Daoist tradition of Jiangnan. His cultivation is profound, and the South may not be able to touch him for now... but there will be no end to the peripheral skirmishes."

"Baijiang Creek is as good as lost. I made this trip specifically to see you, fellow daoists, to say this: We will undoubtedly be in contact. I hope our two families can let bygones be bygones and offer each other mutual support."

"That is only natural!"

Li Ximing's expression was grave. He felt the need to parse the previous statement to prevent any misunderstanding and quickly replied:

"Whether a Fruition Attainment is prominent or obscure isn't for a single Daoist to decide. The Hengzhu Dao is powerful, true, but the world's Hengzhu spiritual items are exceedingly rare. It's not a simple matter, and not something one can inquire about lightly."

Yehui glanced at a fallen gardenia blossom on the table. "Naturally. I was merely speaking casually. After all, the might of a True Monarch is vast. How could a junior cultivator like me possibly define it with a single sentence? But your words remind me of a phrase I read when I first received my Daoist tradition."

"It said: [A prominent position is never lost; a vacant position is unfathomable. Lower cultivators toil diligently; their proof lies in the remainder]."

"If a Metallic Essence Fruition Attainment is manifest throughout the world, flourishing greatly, then there is assuredly a noble personage occupying that seat. If a Fruition Attainment grows dim and obscure, its Spiritual Qi severed, one cannot simply assume that the great being has fallen... because if they *wish* it, that Fruition Attainment *will* grow dim, and its Spiritual Qi *will* be severed."

"Lesser cultivators can only know which True Monarch *wants* to be known. They can only focus on their own cultivation... But for people like us? Without a Daoist tradition built over countless years, without the heart-to-heart transmission from master to disciple, without detailed records, without different branches of practice to compare... how could we ever compare the power of a Fruition Attainment across centuries and millennia? How could we possibly know which Fruition Attainment is *truly* manifest, which is flourishing in the world?"

Yehui let out a short grunt, his expression turning playful. A burst of sarcastic laughter erupted from him as he stood up and stepped into the Great Void, departing. Only his chilled words were left to echo across the mountain:

"What it means is... creatures like us, who can't even be considered 'lesser cultivators,' shouldn't even *dream* of seeking attainment!"

He dissolved into a stream of purple light and vanished, leaving Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei seated at the table. Their expressions were heavy, and for a long moment, neither spoke.

At length, Li Zhouwei sipped his tea. "It seems this Yehui... not only has the ambition to become a True Monarch, but also harbors deep resentment over his Daoist tradition's lack of standing..."

He was different from them. The Li family were known as imperial scions, and their Bright Yang Dao was renowned. Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing knew exactly who occupied the Fruition Attainment above them and what their circumstances were. Even if they couldn't predict the future, they had a fundamental understanding of their place.

Yehui's Daoist tradition, however, stemmed from a Grotto-Heaven of the Encompassing Profoundity. While his cultivation techniques were exquisite and his Spiritual Artifacts were impressive, he lacked a powerful background. He was ignorant of the high-stakes game being played over the Capital Guard. Even with opportunities that would make most Purple Mansion Realm cultivators green with envy, he still felt lost and anxious about his own path to attainment.

At this, Li Zhouwei began to understand Yehui's motives more clearly.

"If not for that ambition, why would he be struggling to hold his territory in Jiangbei? He's poured his heart and soul into the Capital immortals Dao's mountain gate, and it's immensely valuable, but the risks are mounting daily. Why not just lead the Capital immortals Dao far away from the eye of this storm?"

"It's simply his desire to ascend... He occupied Jiangbei early, hoping to carve out a foothold in the great game between North and South. Whether he contacts the South or the North, his goal is the same: to acquire more information about the grand scheme of things, and about his own path forward..."

Li Ximing had been listening, but he had, of course, already discerned this.

"Judging by his words, he's already cultivated extensive connections in the North... He has been scheming for a long time!"

"It's understandable. To put it bluntly, there isn't a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in the world who doesn't dream of the Purple Mansion Realm, and not a single Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who doesn't gaze up at the Fruition Attainment. The ladder to immortality is more tempting than any divine nectar; it's more alluring than anything."

Li Ximing sighed, and Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze.

The two said no more, a silent understanding passing between them. They stepped into the Great Void, drifting across the lake's surface to materialize within the inner array. The grand hall was dim, dominated by the precious pagoda standing in its center.

"You've been, then..."

Li Ximing asked in a low, uncertain voice. He studied him for a moment, his gaze hesitant. "The Azure Talisman...?"

"I have." A rare smile touched Li Zhouwei's lips. "I received the Talisman of Illuminating Sun and Moon!"

He gave a brief explanation of his Talisman Qi. Li Ximing stroked his beard, nodding in constant admiration. He let out a few hearty laughs and shook his head.

"It seems I won't have to risk my life so desperately in the future!"

At this, Li Zhouwei's expression turned serious. He bowed deeply. "You have endured much hardship these past few years, Elder."

Li Ximing waved him off, cutting him short with a smile. He immediately asked his most pressing question: "Your cultivation level...?"

Li Zhouwei smiled. "The talisman dissolved into an azure mist and elevated my cultivation base. My 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' divine ability, within the Shengyang Acupoint, reached perfection in an instant!"

Li Ximing stared at him, stunned. His expression was a bizarre mix of delight and awkwardness. "Does that mean... we are now at the same cultivation level?"

"Not so."

Li Zhouwei shook his head. The Daoist Master in the gold and white robes had a flash of realization, then clapped his hands in frustration. "You're right... My injuries are still severe. I can hardly be considered at your level."

Li Zhouwei looked slightly awkward. After a brief pause, he explained, "I wasn't referring to your dharma-body... It's just that after the Azure Talisman elevated my divine ability, there was power left over. It coalesced into a mass of pure cultivation, sealed within my Shengyang Acupoint. As soon as I begin cultivating my next divine ability, I can draw upon it at will..."

"Oh!" Li Ximing turned and sat, mulling this over for a moment before letting out a laugh. "It is an Azure Talisman, after all!"

But his head snapped back up, his eyes wide with alarm. "If it can elevate your cultivation, couldn't it instantly perfect all five of your divine abilities?! Have you already cultivated 'World's Radiance'? Have you truly thought this through?"

Li Ximing had heard Tinglan's explanation: World's Radiance was best used as the *final* divine ability. He himself had no hope of reaching that stage, but Li Zhouwei was another matter. At his question, the younger man shook his head with a smile.

"Naturally, I remember the advice..." Li Zhouwei replied, his tone turning serious. "I cultivated 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread,' but I left the azure mist in my Shengyang Acupoint untouched. This is precisely what I needed to discuss with you."

"First, by relying on the Talisman Qi, my 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' reached perfection instantly. Honing a divine ability is a subtle process, and one's Dao-Profundity is personal. It's hard to measure and not a major issue... But if I continue to draw on that power, I will undoubtedly condense my second divine ability almost immediately. That would be a different matter entirely. The moment I fought someone, it would be exposed for all to see."

His expression was grim. "I may be blessed by fate, but not to the terrifying extent of mastering a second divine ability in a few mere days. If anyone witnessed that, they would likely suspect *I* was the reincarnation of Emperor Wei! All factions are already watching me closely. If something so far beyond their comprehension were to happen, it would surely bring disaster down upon us."

Li Ximing nodded gravely as Li Zhouwei continued.

"Therefore, it is best for me to cultivate normally during this time. Once I have forged the second divine ability on my own, I can *then* use the Talisman Qi to bring it to rapid perfection. This is the wisest course, both to protect myself and to maximize the benefit of the Azure Talisman."

"Good. It is best you manage this yourself."

Li Ximing stroked his beard. "Since you've brought up the various factions' plans... this matter with Emperor Wei. Our family is becoming deeply entangled. What are your thoughts?"

Li Zhouwei seemed to have already pondered this. His gaze darkened as he replied softly, "The games played at that level... neither I nor our family are qualified to intervene. In the end, whether I follow the Dragon-kin's arrangement to reincarnate and cultivate again, or whether I am forced into a corner with no choice but to attempt a breakthrough... nothing is set in stone. As I see it, we have only one path: increase our strength and bide our time."

Li Ximing nodded in silent agreement. After a long pause, he retrieved an ink-black jade from his sleeve. "You are still using a mere dharma artifact; it simply won't do. The Viewing Pavilion Platform has been ready for some time. Take these spiritual materials and use them. It's high time you had a proper weapon."

Li Zhouwei had clearly considered this. "My dharma artifact was damaged in the fight with Helian Wumeng," he mused. "I've wanted to repair it for some time, but our 'lake' has always been lacking in the field of artifact refinement. We lack top-tier talent. I can only nourish it slowly myself. While Jiangzong of the clan has studied for many years and achieved some minor success, he is incapable of refining anything to the level of a spirit embryo. We will have to find an expert."

"That shouldn't be difficult. There's still no trace of Ning Wan, which makes borrowing Chu Minglian... inconvenient. However, whether it's Purple Smoke or Xiukui, borrowing an expert from them should be simple enough now."

Li Ximing chuckled, then suddenly recalled something. He produced a small jade vial containing pulsing wisps of pale, azure-white energy. He showed it to Li Zhouwei. "Look at this. It also came from that place."

There were five such vials in total. A few more remained in that hidden realm, but Li Zhouwei had been too focused on his cultivation to examine them. Now, he took one and assessed it.

"It looks like some kind of Spiritual Qi... related to the Supreme Yin. If we really want to identify it, I fear only the Chunyi Dao Gate would know."

Li Ximing shook his head, a headache coming on. "That's what I'm afraid of. I also refined a powerful pill of the Supreme Yin Dao! It would be an incredible treasure for the Chunyi Dao Gate. But whether we ask about this Spiritual Qi or mention the spirit pill... the Supreme Yin has vanished from the world. Once they realize how precious these items are, how do we explain them falling into our hands for no reason? It will only breed suspicion."

Li Zhouwei nodded. "Didn't we also receive word of a cave dwelling from that realm? We can't rush this. Once you have recovered from your injuries, Elder, and the situation in the North stabilizes, you should make a trip. Find a good pretext, and take care of this."

Li Ximing understood. This was a sensitive time. It wasn't appropriate for Li Zhouwei to travel, and he certainly couldn't just vanish overseas to "discover" a cave dwelling in a specific, remote strait. It fell to Li Ximing to make the journey quietly and retrieve the items.

"Alright!"

Li Ximing nodded discreetly and pulled a cauldron from his sleeve. It was a beautiful ivory and gold—the Treasure Elephant Cauldron. He smiled.

"I still owe Dingyang Zi that batch of Serpent Water Dao-Hanging Powder. This is the perfect time to refine it!"

The spiritual energies within the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance were far richer, making it a better place for alchemy. Unfortunately, the Serpent Water Dao-Hanging Powder was a pill of Pit Water and suspended karma; its nature conflicted with the realm's aura of balance. He immediately took out the main ingredient for the powder.

Dingyang Zi had provided the materials. Opening the jade box revealed a palm-sized, blackish-blue scale that shimmered with a faint light: the primary ingredient, a Cangzhou Serpent Scale. All the supplementary herbs were also prepared. He could begin refinement immediately.

A single glance confirmed the spiritual materials were of exceptional quality, which set Li Ximing's mind to work.

'Dingyang Zi wants six pills from this cauldron. I can certainly manage that. But the extras... they'll also be Pit Water pills, which are practically useless to my family. Their application is too narrow, too specific to one Daoist tradition. Unless you have a very particular need, their value is low...'

After struggling for so many years, he valued every Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resource. He examined the scale closely. Not only was its quality superb, but it also looked as if it had been harvested very recently.

'A scale isn't like other materials. This might not mean Dingyang Zi has a *stable* supply, but it very likely means he has more than just this single piece.' Li Ximing's mind raced, and a plan began to form.

'If this refinement is successful, I should pursue a long-term arrangement with him. If he needs this pill refined regularly, I can set aside the extra pills from each batch. Once I've saved up six... that's the equivalent of a full Cangzhou Serpent Scale for myself! *That* is no longer useless. That is a genuine, high-grade spiritual resource I can trade with other cultivators!'

Fired up by the thought, he didn't hesitate for a second. He immediately began the refinement. Flames surged as the True Fire roared to life, casting shifting, brilliant light throughout the dim hall.

Li Zhouwei, meanwhile, excused himself from the hall. His expression was heavy.

'It is time,' he thought, 'to visit the Demon Cave...'
