# Chapter 1160: The Azure Step

A knot of doubt tightened in Touba Ci’s chest, but the flow of Profound Qi from his hands never wavered. He looked at Daoist Master Changyun, who stood holding a treasure saber, and exhaled slowly.

“Daoist Master Zhang,” he asked, “both you and I are scions of True Monarchs. There's no need for this. Why press me so relentlessly?”

A flicker of apprehension showed in his eyes.

Zhang Yun’s divine abilities and Dao-Profundity were considerable among those at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, making him a match for Touba Ci. Furthermore, Touba Ci’s Dao Lineage of Profound Qi was unpredictable by nature; he could hold his own against anyone for a time, so escaping should not have been difficult.

The problem was this Zhang Yun… The Spiritual Treasure in his hand, the Golden Scepter of Void's Dread, was terrifyingly potent. Its power to trap enemies was absolute, a clear sign that he had come well-prepared.

‘Li Zhouwei might still be able to fight, but his divine abilities and dharma power must be nearly spent… The real problem… is Cheng Jiuwen!’

The middle-aged man stood beside the Celestial Gate with his hand on his sword, guarding Li Zhouwei against any potential ambush. Touba Ci did not lower his guard.

‘The Sword Gate's foundations run deep. Even a cultivator at the initial stage of the Purple Mansion Realm is not to be underestimated!’

The Daoist Master of the Touba family had humbled himself, yet Daoist Master Changyun remained utterly without expression.

“The Touba clan is nothing but vassals who took a second name,” he said coolly. “If you count as a True Monarch’s descendant, then the chaotic battlefields of Jianghuai are teeming with them. You are nothing special.”

“If you wish to leave, you may. Shatter your Imperial Seal and be gone.”

The words struck Touba Ci like lightning, and his face contorted with rage.

Zhang Yun’s meaning was unmistakable: how could the Touba family—whose Great Liang dynasty had fallen and whose True Monarch had perished—dare compare themselves to the ascendant Zhang family as heirs of a True Monarch? The insult struck home, and Touba Ci ground his teeth.

“To think I'm being lectured by someone who changed his own name, hiding his true origins and feigning allegiance to another Daoist tradition!”

Zhang Yun’s eyes shifted, a flash of disbelief giving way to chilling amusement. He stared at him.

“Those are not words you are qualified to speak.”

Touba Ci met his gaze with a cold sneer, the bitter humiliation catching in his throat. He said no more. A surge of Profound Yellow Qi began to gather, and intricate, ink-dark patterns spread rapidly across his body as Profound Qi surged forth.

Zhang Yun was already in the air. He unleashed a wave of Metal Malice as his white umbrella unfurled, blocking the tide of incoming Profound Qi. Their gazes locked for a mere instant before another dazzling flash erupted nearby.

“BOOM!”

Another of the Merciful Ones had fallen.

Touba Ci broke away, the point between his brows glowing with brilliant light. He clenched his jaw and decisively activated the Imperial Seal suspended in the air. As faint, snow-white cracks spiderwebbed across it, the pale barrier of light finally trembled, and an overwhelming wave of Profound Qi engulfed the sky.

This Profound Qi was strange. It became fire upon contact with metal and turned to yin when it met yang. It was a vast, unstoppable tide that held back all the other cultivators. The ivory scepter floating in the air shuddered violently before its light died and it fell from the sky.

Seeing Touba Ci play his final card, Zhang Yun showed no intention of honoring his word. Instead, a broad smile touched his lips as he produced an ink-blue, narrow-necked vase with a wooden body and a golden base from his sleeve and aimed it skyward.

Though shrouded in the boundless Profound Yellow Qi, Touba Ci saw the movement clearly. His heart seized with dread.

“Zhang Yun… you!”

Zhang Yun’s expression was implacable. He activated the treasure, and in an instant, the entire expanse of Profound Qi began to flow like a river cascading from the heavens, funneling directly into the mouth of the vase.

More terrifying still, the spiritual artifacts he wore began to tremble violently, threatening to fly from his body. They seemed to be fighting his own divine abilities, trying to escape into the vase’s pull.

Shock and fury warred within Touba Ci. He finally recognized the inexplicable killing intent behind Zhang Yun’s smile. He braced his long halberd against the air, but the weapon’s shaft began to bend under the immense suction.

‘What enmity is there between us that he would go this far?’

It wasn’t that he couldn’t defeat this man, but his opponent’s goal was clearly to stall him. Cheng Jiuwen and Li Zhouwei were here now, but who would arrive next? What if it was that Sword Immortal from the Reflecting Metal lineage?

Worse, the man was holding his own treasures hostage. How could he possibly abandon them?

As the fury on Touba Ci’s face deepened, Zhang Yun’s smile only widened. But then, he felt the Great Void itself tremble as a figure materialized from thin air.

The man was dressed in black robes, his power immense, backed by the convergence of four distinct Profound Qi divine abilities. His lean, cold face was a mask of calm as his gaze fell upon Zhang Yun.

In that moment, the world fell silent. The cascading Profound Qi froze in place, and the trembling spiritual artifacts grew still. Zhang Yun’s expression remained unchanged as he smiled.

“So, the Great Daoist Master has arrived.”

It was Touba Qiye, come to his kinsman’s aid.

This direct heir of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition showed no fear. He simply glanced at the sky with a smirk.

“What is your intent, Great Daoist Master? In this situation, even if I were to kill him, you would have no grounds to blame me…”

Touba Qiye said nothing. He shot Zhang Yun a final, furious glare, then swept up his junior and vanished toward the north. Zhang Yun made no move to stop them, his gaze turning to ice as he watched them depart.

Though rescued, Touba Ci’s face was a mask of humiliation. He swallowed an elixir and spat through clenched teeth,

“I don’t know what madness possessed Zhang Yun. If not for your intervention, Your Excellency…”

Now within the Great Void, Touba Qiye’s expression was just as dark. He didn’t reply, instead turning to face the north and bowing deeply.

“Many thanks, Senior, for allowing us to pass.”

Only then did Touba Ci notice an old man standing nearby, stroking his beard, a gourd hanging at his side. The figure was utterly unmistakable: Wang Ziya of the Numinous Treasure Order.

Touba Ci had witnessed the man’s power before and was deeply shaken. Hearing that Wang Ziya had permitted their escape, he quickly bowed.

“This junior will forever remember Your Excellency’s kindness!”

“I wouldn’t dare claim such a thing.”

Wang Ziya’s smile was restrained, his expression unreadable.

“I have a mission yet to complete, so I lingered. I had no intention of interfering. You both speak too formally… However…”

His eyes narrowed with a probing light.

“It seems His Highness… is not always careful with his words.”

This was clearly the source of Touba Qiye’s grim mood. At Wang Ziya’s words, a fresh wave of fear washed over him. He raised his hand and struck his son viciously across the face. Touba Ci staggered, bowing his head in apology as the Great Daoist Master’s voice dripped with ice.

“What were you arguing with him about?”

His voice trembled with repressed rage.

“Changed his name, feigned allegiance to another Dao… How dare you speak such words! You hold Qi Lanyan in such contempt… but ask yourself, would he ever dare utter such a thing?”

Touba Ci, still reeling, frowned but remained silent. Touba Qiye took a deep breath and conjured a divine ability to shroud them.

“That eminence from the Golden Feather Sect commands the Geng-Dui, capable of transmuting the twin metals. To speak of changing one’s name to advance a Dao Lineage… you… you…”

Touba Ci froze. Touba Qiye’s voice dropped to a whisper, concealed by his power.

“Never mind the name change from long ago. After that eminence was reincarnated, why did he take the generational name ‘Tai’ and the title ‘Yuan’? To which sect does the name ‘Tai’ belong? Wishful thinking or not, he refers to the Master of the Supreme Yang as ‘Senior,’ not ‘Lord’!”

Touba Ci had meant only to mock Zhang Yun, never imagining his words would implicate such a legendary figure. He finally understood the coldness in Zhang Yun’s eyes. The revelation left him utterly dumbfounded.

“How… how can that be possible?”

What did this mean? The world knew the True Monarch’s title was Taiyuan, but Touba Ci would have died before connecting that name to the Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition. Even if it was merely the True Monarch’s own aspiration, it was still the will of a being on that level.

“How can it be possible?”

Touba Qiye’s expression grew complicated. Wang Ziya, realizing that the younger man had truly misspoken from ignorance, shook his head with a faint smile.

“There is no crime in ignorance. That eminence is unlikely to take offense. But his great name and power are renowned even in the Heavens…”

The Touba father and son turned their gazes to him. The heir of the Numinous Treasure Order seemed lost in thought.

“As the saying goes…” he began, his voice distant.

“Let no one say a Monarch's path is a realm apart, for the legacies of the Three Profoundities gather under one roof. To seek the ultimate yin, one must race the moon; to achieve what the sun-chariot cannot, one must embrace the Crimson Virtue. The great clans came to the palace to listen to the teachings of Wu Earth, and even legendary figures have stood before the Golden Lock. He mastered all the immortal spell arts of a bygone age—and this morning, he has ascended the pavilion to pay respects at the Azure Step!”

Both men were lost in contemplation. With a final, parting gesture, Wang Ziya stepped into the Great Void and was gone.

Touba Qiye returned the salute. He waited until the last echo of the man’s voice had faded before flying onward in silence. Only when they were far from Jianghuai did the harsh lines on his face soften. He turned to his son, his voice filled with regret.

“There’s no telling how many great powers were watching Jianghuai just now. Fortunately… fortunately, you truly did not know.”

“It’s not your fault. Few know the truth these days. If I hadn’t followed the regent-king to the north and met a few of the direct descendants myself, I would be ignorant of these secrets as well.”

Touba Ci stood numbly, his mind racing. A chill crept through him.

“Was that why he wanted to kill me?”

Touba Qiye considered this for a moment.

“He likely guessed you had no death wish. Even he wouldn’t dare state these matters so openly. He was merely using your words as a pretext. Jianghuai is not the domain of the Great Zhao. Our family may have once ruled the Central Plains, but in the eyes of the Zhang family, we are nothing more than fallen outsiders. Killing you would earn him merit. Why wouldn’t he take the chance?”

Touba Ci felt his breath catch.

“For that alone?”

Touba Qiye gritted his teeth.

“That Zhang Yun isn’t even afraid of me! In his eyes, so long as the regent-king with his perfected divine abilities is not present, you are just another Helian Wujiang!”

The former hegemon of the Central Plains, the imperial line of Great Liang, had fallen so low. Touba Qiye’s face was grim, his blood running cold. Realizing that to continue this topic would only invite more danger, he changed the subject.

“Let’s put that aside for now…”

The Great Daoist Master’s tone shifted, now filled with a disbelief that bordered on the impossible.

“What in the world happened at Lake Xian? How could Qi Lanyan possibly be dead?”

At the mention of this, Touba Ci’s face twisted in a snarl.

“Qi Lanyan… utterly useless!”

He recounted the events at the lake. Touba Qiye’s expression shifted again and again as he listened. When he heard that King Wei had managed to fight back even while afflicted by the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth, he fell into a stunned silence.

“No wonder,” he murmured, his face pale with shock.

---

A rosy, dust-filled light pulsed across the sky as sandstorms raged below. Shards of glazed crystal rained down, kicking up violent gales across the ravaged earth.

Li Zhouwei drew back his halberd and swallowed the blood that rose in his throat. His fingers slowly clenched into a fist. Though his emotions churned like a stormy sea, his mind was a sea of ice as he murmured to himself:

‘He mastered all the immortal spell arts of a bygone age—and this morning, he has ascended the pavilion to pay respects at the Azure Step.’

The Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth had robbed him of nearly all sensation. His spiritual sense was constricted to his immediate vicinity, leaving him functionally blind. But for that very reason, while feigning unawareness, he had kept his Spirit Probe active the entire time.

Nearly every word spoken between the Toubas and Wang Ziya had reached him. Though the two had been guarded in the Great Void, speaking more with their thoughts than their words, Li Zhouwei had connected the pieces almost instantly.

‘Golden Oneness… Highest Azure…’

‘Highest Azure practices in seclusion, while Golden Oneness resides openly in the mountains…’

‘Golden Oneness isn’t the mortal branch of Highest Azure; they are two parallel Dao-paths.’

He recalled something he had heard long ago, after returning from capturing the Demon King in the Western Sea:

‘The first disciple of Comprehending Profoundity, the clan that Highest Azure favors year after year, the Immortal Lord that Great Liang worships generation after generation…’

This all but confirmed the True Monarch’s origins. He was from the bloodline of a great power of the Comprehending Profoundity tradition, yet after his reincarnation, he had likely received guidance from a master of the Azure Profoundity Daoist tradition—perhaps even becoming a disciple—and it almost certainly was not the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition.

And yet, such a figure still held the title ‘Taiyuan.’

Once that title was connected to Azure Profoundity, the hazy relationship between the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition and the powers of Luoxia Wu Light began to clear. The tight bond between the Golden Feather Sect and the cultivation world of the Yue State became undeniable.

‘No wonder this evergreen of Metal Virtue… holds such an exalted position among the True Monarchs of the world, and even within the Heavens themselves!’

His heart grew calm. He buried these thoughts deep within his consciousness and glanced down at the swirling sands with a hint of regret.

‘It’s a shame… Touba Ci shattered the Spiritual Treasure sealing the area, allowing the other Merciful Ones to escape. Otherwise… my gains would have been even greater.’

Still, what he had gained was by no means small. He had come here, despite his grave injuries, for the sake of immortal merit and to witness this very spectacle.

And, of course, for another important prize.

He turned his head, his vision swimming for a moment before he could focus. He confirmed that the great Profound Tiger was completely suppressed by the combined power of Audience with the Celestial Gate and the Huai River Map, pinned immobile under the vast Heavenly Light.

‘At least… I've secured this strand of Talisman Qi!’

His eyes, veiled by a film of colored light, stared downward for a long while before he finally looked up and turned. Only then did he realize that Daoist Master Changyun was standing before him.

Zhang Yun’s expression was complicated. His gaze swept over the grievous wounds covering Li Zhouwei’s body, and he looked up, his voice filled with awe.

“This humble servant, Changyun, greets King Wei.”

“Daoist Master,” Li Zhouwei replied, “you have upheld justice and helped us reclaim Jianghuai. You shall be rewarded for your service.”

Although the Zhang family did not possess a Crystalline Jade Branch, as a direct heir of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition, Zhang Yun knew the horrors of the Disaster of Crystalline Wu Earth all too well. His thoughts were a tangled mess.

‘Qi Lanyan’s divine abilities were average, but he was a disciple of Guanhua. One blast from that Crystalline Jade Branch must have destroyed that powerful Eye Divine Ability of his. He looks strong on the outside, but he is likely hollowed out from the inside.’

This calamity would only burn hotter with time. It was a miracle that Li Zhouwei was still standing. Terrified that the king might suddenly collapse, Zhang Yun spoke with hesitation.

“I implore you, King Wei… withdraw your forces and recover!”
