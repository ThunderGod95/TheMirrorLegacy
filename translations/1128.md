# Chapter 1128: Xiyang

After seeing his junior clansman off, Li Ximing rode a beam of light back toward the lone mountain. He arrived to find the young man already waiting quietly in the monastery.

"Nanwu, you live a truly carefree life," Li Ximing smiled.

Guo Nanwu had been ordered to hold the line against a Demon King from the White Rock Monastery on nearby Fangya Province. His posting was quite close to Li Ximing's, and he seemed to be handling the task with ease, appearing completely unfazed by his duties.

"I cultivate Heretical Seeking," Guo Nanwu smiled, "which is a method of the Lesser Yang for walking through Yin. It makes escape exceptionally easy, no less effective than Valley Water. That Demon beast cultivated Water Mansion, but it stood no chance of holding me."

Li Ximing, with the Azure Talisman now in his possession, was in excellent spirits.

"I've made a great haul as well!" he laughed.

The two entered together. Daoist Master Dao Mian, dressed in full robes, greeted them with a sigh.

"Only now do I realize the true power of the Jiangnan Immortal Dao!"

Hiding in this desolate Western Sea was, at its root, just a way to seek freedom and preserve one's life-mandate. How could they not be sensitive to such major events? Li Ximing knew this group from the Purple Mansion Realm all felt a sense of shared sorrow. Even a Daoist Master like Dao Mian, who held personal grudges, was moved.

"Senior Liu showed my family a great kindness," Li Ximing replied. "This was merely to remove a weight from his mind. Besides, possessing a treasure is itself an invitation to disaster."

Nearby, Bao Xiang, though her expression was calm, lowered her eyes.

"Tonight, the entire Western Sea is buzzing with talk of King Wei's mighty name!"

Li Ximing just laughed and shook his head, not elaborating.

"Let's speak privately."

Bao Xiang raised an eyebrow and followed him into the inner hall.

"I recall you cultivate Pit Water," Li Ximing smiled. "Is your Dao Lineage still complete?"

The woman looked up, her interest piqued, and her eyes suddenly brightened.

"There aren't many in the Purple Mansion Realm who would dare claim their Dao Lineage is complete. My lineage has been supplemented for generations and has a deep heritage. Pit Water is a widespread Dao Lineage, but we are missing the Man on Creek. It's in Jiangnan... If Senior has this art, Bao Xiang would be eternally grateful for the grace that leads to the Dao!"

"This..."

How could Li Ximing not recognize the name of that divine ability? During his family's initial rise, it had scared him half to death. He shook his head, slightly embarrassed.

"'Man on Creek'... I can only point you toward Cangzhou to ask. Whether you can obtain it will depend on your own karmic affinity. However, I do have a spell art here. It's called the Water-Guiding Transformation Scripture."

He took out a purple jade profound slip and handed it to Bao Xiang. She glanced at the summary and smiled.

"What a marvelous art... This is... this is a technique from the Encompassing Profoundity!"

The spell art in Li Ximing's hand had come from the High Firmament Pavilion; how could it be an ordinary item? Although Bao Xiang didn't seem overly excited, Li Ximing knew she absolutely coveted it. Seeing she had recognized its origin, he simply smiled.

"First, you've been a great help along the way, and I can't let Senior Liu be indebted to you for nothing. Second, I wish to trade it for the spirit object in your possession, the Verdant Profound Sarcophagus."

Li Ximing had, of course, come for the Verdant Profound Sarcophagus. Since he had already acquired the one from Rogue Cultivator Yin Qin, he couldn't be bothered to pay an exorbitant price to another rogue cultivator. He would simply trade with Bao Xiang here and now. The woman was getting a fantastic deal, so why would she hesitate?

"Done!" she smiled.

One was getting something for nothing, the other was secretly snagging a bargain. They struck the deal instantly. With the item in hand, Li Ximing asked with a faint smile:

"That Rogue Cultivator Yin Qin... what's his story?"

Bao Xiang paused.

"He came to the Western Sea to cultivate over a hundred years ago. His cultivation is formidable, and many have suffered at his hands. As for his Dao Lineage... he only ever claims to be one of the rogue cultivators."

"Is that so..."

Li Ximing smiled and shook his head.

"Just a casual question."

He didn't linger, stepping back out.

"I do have one item I must have Senior Dao Mian inspect!"

With a flick of his sleeve, he revealed the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron, handing it to Daoist Master Dao Mian. He then took out three portions of the Verdant Profound Sarcophagus.

"Please, take a look!"

Any Daoist Master who reached the Purple Mansion Realm was shrewd. Daoist Master Dao Mian understood with a single glance.

"What an incredible treasure, Daoist friend. You'd never find something so wondrous outside of Jiangnan!"

The Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron had been obtained from Wanling Heaven, a Grotto-Heaven of the Encompassing Profoundity. It was naturally extraordinary. Li Ximing smiled as he watched the man retract his divine ability. Daoist Master Dao Mian then took a round disk from his sleeve.

The disk was no larger than his palm and shone like silver. Dao Mian collected a wisp of aura from the Verdant Profound Sarcophagus, then took out several Foundation Establishment Realm-level samples of water and fire from his sleeve. He tested them one by one before speaking.

"This Spiritual Artifact stems from the root of Gathering Wood, yet it holds the function of the Whole Pill. The creator's genius is astonishing, far beyond my own. This Verdant Profound Sarcophagus, however, is aligned with water and wood. It lacks a component of Earth Virtue. Based on my years of cultivation, it requires a 'nurturing' Treasured Earth."

He smiled.

"I will spend a few days making careful calculations. I will ensure no mistakes are left."

Li Ximing was startled.

"'Treasured Earth'? It needs another spiritual resource? Without your help, Senior, I would have made a terrible mistake!"

Daoist Master Dao Mian nodded.

"This Spiritual Artifact is extremely potent. Even if you don't supplement it with this earth element, it should still be able to condense spiritual water. It would just be flawed, congenitally deficient, and lacking some of its true marvel. In a battle, if you encountered an art from the Three Shamans and Two Rites, or the Whole Pill and Exiled Qi, this spiritual water might be extinguished. If you just keep it within the clan for internal use, it should be fine."

Hearing this, Li Ximing felt a wave of relief. He sighed, "But this Treasured Earth spiritual resource..."

Guo Nanwu, who had been listening, smiled.

"This junior happens to have a portion of Cliff-Repel Earth."

Li Ximing had no desire to run around searching for this resource. He was overjoyed. He took a Shore-Manifesting White Flower from his robes.

"You've been troubled to come all this way. This Shore-Manifesting White Flower is a spiritual resource of the Lesser Yang path. It's perfect for you. Take it."

Although both were spiritual resources, the Shore-Manifesting White Flower could be directly consumed and was perfectly aligned with Guo Nanwu's Dao Lineage. It was an exceptionally good treasure. The young man's eyes curved into crescents as he cupped his hands.

"Many thanks to Senior for your generosity!"

With all matters settled, Li Ximing was even more satisfied. He finalized the details with Daoist Master Dao Mian and began to calculate inwardly,

'The items from Shehu were divided, but the Spiritual Artifact and the spirit embryo both ended up with Zhouwei. Add to that one spirit object, the Supreme Eaves Radiance, and two spiritual resources, the Dao-Gazing Scales and the Shore-Manifesting White Flower... this harvest is enormous. Far beyond my expectations!'

'And that's not even mentioning the Azure Talisman and the spiritual water!'

...

The sky was a dim, heavy, purple-gold.

While Li Ximing was in the Western Sea, giddy with joy as he gathered spirit objects and counted his gains, the black-robed young man felt a chill in his heart. He had rushed all the way back to Moongaze Lake, settling into the grand formation. He counted the days; he had been gone only half a month.

He did not go to see Sima Yuanli. Instead, he immediately went to the deepest part of the formation, produced the treasured urn, and placed it on a table using a divine ability. With his gaze lowered and hands behind his back, he slowly began to loosen the seal.

He relaxed it by only a fraction, but the vertical patterns on the urn lit up one by one, trembling slightly. A thick, grey qi swirled at the mouth of the urn. It slammed into the pair of golden eyes waiting in the darkness and instantly froze. A low voice emerged,

"This little Demon greets King Wei..."

Now that it was completely sealed in the urn, Shehu's voice was surprisingly calm. Golden light flickered in the dark hall as Li Zhouwei spoke, his tone faint.

"Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant... where did it come from?"

The Demon beast in the urn fell silent for a moment before a voice, thick with hatred and grinding teeth, replied:

"You found my treasure so quickly... Yin Qin must have invited you... Good... Very good..."

Li Zhouwei didn't press the question. He merely watched, the gold in his eyes growing more intense. Shehu couldn't hold onto his sliver of hope.

"It was stolen from Shejie's Golden Land," he whispered. "I carried it all the way from the Eastern Sea..."

Before he could finish, Li Zhouwei laughed, a cold, sharp sound.

"Stolen? This King won't even bother debating whether Shejie's Golden Land could have preserved this spirit root. You carried it from the Eastern Sea? And you just _happened_ to find the one place capable of sustaining a Lesser Yang item? What a joke!"

Seeing the anger in his eyes, Shehu's voice grew urgent.

"I didn't find the place! A Daoist friend... a Daoist friend set it up for me."

At these words, the smile vanished from Li Zhouwei's face.

"This Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant wasn't always so small," Shehu rushed to explain. "Back when I was in the Golden Land, I was suppressed, unable to move. The immortal plant was as tall as a man... Shejie received it as a reward from the Liang Emperor after a Dao debate in the Liang Palace."

Li Zhouwei frowned.'
"You claim you were trapped in the Golden Land, unable to move. How could you know all this?"

Seeing how sharp and suspicious he was, Shehu felt more sorrow than anger, terrified for his life.

"King Wei, you may not know. The Great Liang dynasty was plagued by three great troubles. The first was the flooding of the rivers. The second was the conflict between barbarians and the civilized. The third was the great debate between the Immortals and the Buddhists. At that time, many Buddhists and Daoists were beyond the passes. The Liang Emperor invited all the great cultivators and monks of the world to debate the Immortal and Buddhist scriptures... There were nine debates in total. The Buddhist cultivators won only three, and Shejie was one of the victors... He... he disliked using spell arts to bewilder people. He focused on sincerity and genuine conviction..."

Li Zhouwei's suspicion eased slightly.

"No wonder it took a figure like that so long to subdue a little Demon like you."

Locked inside, Shehu wiped at a cold sweat.

"Later, the void collapsed, and the Golden Land returned to emptiness. I grabbed this spirit root and snatched several Enlightened Artifacts he had been refining there. I fled in a panic, all the way from the Eastern Sea to the Western Sea, and only then did I stop to rest. But when I undid my arts to check, the Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant was withered, almost lifeless!"

"I don't understand Dharma arts, I couldn't save it. I could only let it be. I sold those Enlightened Artifacts for spiritual resources to heal and cultivate. But then... I ran into a great cultivator practicing in the Western Sea..."

"A great cultivator?"

Li Zhouwei's gaze sharpened. Shehu continued,

"His surname was Qu. He called himself Daoist Qu. He had the face of a middle-aged man, but his divine ability was dazzling, terrifying. This little Demon had never seen anyone with such a brilliant divine ability. I was so scared I prostrated myself. But he just claimed to be a minor cultivator from the Xiyang Monastery..."

"I said, 'This little Demon is ignorant, I don't recognize any such immortal monastery.'"

"This Daoist Qu said, 'My Ancestral Master is not within the Five Elements, born of Yin and Yang. He is the First Lesser Yang, the first disciple of Comprehending Profoundity, the Immortal Lord worshipped by Great Liang for generations, the very clan that Shangqing seeks to ally with year after year.'"

"'Guanhua is magnificent, he is His junior brother. Zidu governs the world, revering Him as Ancestral Master. Dongwu and Qingyi bow to Him. Changtang and Wuguan cultivate in seclusion with Him. Xu Xiang built a great tower, begging Him for guidance time and again, pleading for the immortal mountain—hoping it would serve as His imperial palace.'"

Li Zhouwei's brows shot up. The worry in his heart finally took solid form.

"An immortal cultivator from Comprehending Profoundity!"

At this, Shehu's voice began to tremble visibly, whether from fear or excitement.

"When I heard that, my head spun. I assumed this person must be an immortal's messenger. I kowtowed again and again, saying, 'Aiya! My lord, just take my head! You don't need to frighten me so!'"

"But he said, 'I see that you, little Demon, have obtained my Lesser Yang treasure tree. It is the only one of its kind in the world. It was Senior Shejie's karmic affinity. He, too, was a senior of my Xiyang Monastery who entered the mortal world and joined the Buddhists. Now, I will protect this, so it does not also turn to nothingness.'"

Li Zhouwei's expression was grave. Even if he doubted the story, he knew this Purple Mansion Realm Demon beast could never have fabricated such words.

'I've never heard of this Changtang or Zidu... but Qingyi and Wuguan? They're either Immortal Lords or Demon Ancestors!'

'But from his words, this person... he's probably not one of the figures "from the mountain."'

'Shangqing... that's the Golden Feather Sect...'

'The clan that Shangqing seeks to ally with year after year... That means this great lord most likely has the surname Zhang! I could never find the proof that True Monarch Taiyuan's Dharma principles came from Comprehending Profoundity... perhaps it's related to this lord...'

He remained silent, so Shehu continued.

"He chose a mountain, established that wondrous domain, and revived the tree. I may be ignorant, but I knew his methods were profound. I wanted to set up a Purple Mansion Realm formation to protect it, but I was afraid of disturbing his work..."

"He also told me, 'The Small Leaf Shore-Manifesting Immortal Plant is a Lesser Yang spirit root. It was once planted in the palace and nurtured by an Emperor. Wait one hundred years, and it will grow roots. Wait another hundred, and its leaves will flourish. After another hundred years, it will bloom one flower every fifty years. A hundred years after that, it will bloom three. And after another hundred years, it will bloom four flowers every twenty years...'"

He whimpered, "By Heaven's pity, I used so many spiritual resources to nourish it, and it was blooming four flowers in less than five hundred years! But in total, I've only ever gotten just over ten flowers. I used half of them just to feed the spirit root..."

'No wonder he had nothing good on him.' Li Zhouwei's expression hardened. 'By that count, it's only been nurtured for nearly five hundred years. That's one flower every five years... worse than the Neck Feathers. The only advantage is not needing to painstakingly gather Wall-Sinking Water, and the flowers can be used for alchemy... But it's far inferior to that spirit flower the Golden Feather Sect seized from Donghuo.'

Before the Demon beast could complain further, Li Zhouwei sealed the urn with a mental slap. He casually picked up the Spiritual Treasure, his gaze lowered, and remained silent for a long time.

'Xiyang Monastery... was this a scheme?'

He refused to believe that someone from hundreds of years ago could lay a trap spanning so much time, just to ensnare a Li family member carrying a Talisman Seed. Yet, he also refused to believe that this was all a coincidence, free of mortal interference.

'That Daoist Qu doesn't seem like the type to lay plots, but those who came after could easily use his opening move as their own... The arrangement around Shehu is definitely not simple. That Rogue Cultivator Yin Qin... he was likely targeted long ago, just waiting for an excuse.'

'But he cultivates Earth Virtue, and his background isn't shallow. Bound Earth is clearly one of the "mountain" lineages. Besides Comprehending Profoundity... what other faction is there?'

The young man was silent for a long time, staring at the purple light that flowed like water through the hall.

'Suining's meaning was that even if we don't harvest this spirit root now, the spiritual energies will shift and the plant will be ruined anyway. But... if we had cooperated, that place would have been left in Yin Qin's care... Doesn't that mean _he_ would have been the one to ruin it?'

He recalled the man's haste to leave, and his certainty grew.

'The one who truly wanted this spirit root destroyed... could it have been Yin Qin? But if he really is from Comprehending Profoundity, why wait until today? He could have just destroyed the place openly. Why borrow my hand?'

"Lesser Yang... Lesser Yang..."

His eyes were heavy as he slowly grasped the heart of the problem.

'The key is Great Liang and Lesser Yang. The world believes it was a conflict between Comprehending Profoundity and Azure Profoundity. That the Supreme Yang executing the Lesser Yang planted a hidden danger, leaving the Liang Emperor unable to stand alone against the Dragon-kin, which led to the collapse of Great Liang... But is that the truth?'

'But Great Liang was a Celestial Dynasty! The second Celestial Dynasty after the Great Wei... Qingyu Qian implied that the Great Zhao's current plight is also a result of nursing such ambitions. But Wei, Liang, and Zhao... each dynasty was shorter-lived than the last. This means the original perpetrator's precautions are growing stronger and stronger...'

"When the Supreme Yang executed the Lesser Yang, was Mount Luoxia joyous or grieving? How many different voices were there on Mount Luoxia?"

The golden light in his eyes slowly receded. He committed everything to memory, sat on the main seat, and stared at the Spiritual Treasure in his hand, lost in thought.
