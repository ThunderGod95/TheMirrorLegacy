# Chapter 961: Changes

His gaze had only just swept over the endless slaughter below when the disturbance in the Great Void violently intensified. Soft, white light flickered in vast sheets, cascading down like a surging river.

Li Ximing watched silently, estimating to himself. 'That’s the direction of Mount Changhuai.'

But the white light flickered only for a moment. As if drawn by an invisible force, it swiftly condensed back toward its center and vanished, as ephemeral as a flower blooming in the night.

Li Ximing scanned the area again. Nothing seemed out of place, yet his heart pounded in the silent darkness. Not a single Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had appeared. 'The Wu State cultivators… where have they all gone?'

He had no choice but to return to the mortal world. Riding the wind, he swept his gaze across the land below. He still found no cultivators in Mount Changhuai attire. He continued his search, shaking his head inwardly.

The grand array below flickered erratically, appearing incredibly fragile amidst the fires. Groups of cultivators were in the air, raising their dharma artifacts and smashing them down upon the barrier, unleashing wave after wave of thunderous explosions.

He was a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, after all. Though he knew little of Wu State, he could sense the fluctuations in the spiritual tides and the surge of baleful energy. He quickly formed a hypothesis. "It’s related to the earth veins... It seems to be a violent shift in the earth veins, causing the baleful energy to surge. That’s the only reason the array would react this way. Any ordinary formation would have shattered by now."

He saw clearly that while the crowd of lesser Embyronic Breathing and Qi Refining cultivators scrambled and fought over spoils, a single late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm youth was concealed in the air using spell arts, apparently observing something with great care.

Li Ximing casually crooked a finger. Silken threads of Heavenly Light poured down. The youth, caught in a daze, instantly lost his bearings. The Heavenly Light guided him directly before Li Ximing.

When the youth saw the radiant divine ability, how could he not realize he had been summoned by a Daoist Master? His body trembled, and he bowed with deep respect. "Junior pays his respects to Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing noted that the young man showed little fear, mostly apprehension and caution. His reaction was swift; this clearly wasn’t his first time witnessing a divine ability. 'He has a powerful background,' Li Ximing concluded.

He asked coolly, "Which family do you belong to?"

The young man bowed politely. "Junior is Li Nitan, of the Tanshan Li Clan from Wu State. I was assigned by my clan to observe the situation in the Shu region. I never expected to encounter a Daoist Master. Please forgive me for failing to pay proper respects."

'So, the Tanshan Li Clan!'

Wu State was different from Yue State. When the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition carved up Yue State, it left behind only a few territories, controlling them through its influence. Many of the rules still in place were those established by the Immortal Mansion long ago.

Most of Wu State, however, lay under the shadow of Mount Changhuai's power. Apart from the first four sects to submit, nearly every power that rose later had inextricable ties to Mount Changhuai, or had originated from it directly. Over time, nine Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had emerged from this system, establishing what were commonly known as the Nine Surnames of Wu State.

The Tanshan Li Clan was one of them.

Li Ximing understood immediately.

Mount Changhuai styled itself as the "Changhuai Dao," and its rule was strict. Its Purple Mansion Realm cultivators kept to themselves and rarely communicated with the outside world. In return, Mount Changhuai was fiercely protective of these de facto vassals. With such protection, coupled with the fact that the Tanshan Li Clan's own Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was alive, in his prime, and had successors, they truly had little reason to fear any Daoist Master looking for trouble.

But despite their strength, the Tanshan Li Clan had always referred to themselves as a local Li family, and they naturally never dared to cross the Bright Yang Wei-Li. Li Ximing smiled faintly. "We share a family name, it seems."

Li Nitan was no fool. Seeing the Bright Yang divine ability radiating from the man before him, his words struck with full force.

A cold sweat broke out on his back.

"So it is Daoist Master Zhaojing himself!" he said respectfully.

"We are indeed of the same family. My clan was overjoyed to hear of the Daoist Master's ascension... It is just a pity that the Changhuai decree forbids us from freely associating with outside clans..."

"Enough." Li Ximing had no patience for this. He had only grabbed someone for information; he couldn't care less about the Tanshan clan's politics.

"I am just passing through. Tell me what happened here."

Li Nitan replied quickly, "Reporting to Daoist Master, this junior was also just disturbed from his estate and does not know the cause... I only see that the fighting in the prefecture began because of the shift in the earth veins and spiritual tides. The formations protecting many families, markets, and even pill pavilions and cave estates all failed simultaneously."

"How could ordinary folk resist such a temptation? They immediately began to loot, smash, and fight. Amidst the chaos, several of the prefectures's established clans have also become entangled. It appears to be a wave of annexations!"

This was precisely what puzzled Li Ximing. Normally, suppressing local aristocratic families and forbidding such annexations was standard policy for most major sects.

"What about the Changhuai prohibition?" he asked.

Li Nitan smiled bitterly. "Reporting to Daoist Master, ever since Great Daoist Master Pingwen fell, the mountain has been hoping for more Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to emerge. They lifted the prohibitions. Now, many of the restrictions only apply to the Nine Surnames. With chaos erupting, the entire region is in turmoil, and the old order is changing."

'Hoping for more Purple Mansion Realm cultivators?' Li Ximing mulled over the words. Something felt wrong. But as for the true cause of this upheaval, Li Nitan was unlikely to speak freely even if he knew. Li Ximing simply released him, pierced back into the Great Void, and vanished.

Although Li Nitan had appeared calm, he had been facing a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, and his heart was still unsettled. As he silently rode the wind back down, the cold sweat finally stopped. 'To think I'd run into the Moongaze Li Clan of all people!'

The Tanshan Li Clan's foundation wasn't deep. Their ancestor, Daoist Master Tanfu, had originally been a Mount Changhuai cultivator who only attained the Dao after receiving guidance from Daoist Master Pingwen. After leaving the mountain, the one thing their clan feared most was any entanglement with the Wei-Li!

Wu State had indeed seen nine Purple Mansion Realm clans established, but with cultivators falling over the years, some of those "Nine Surnames" were now just empty titles. His own ancestor had been in seclusion for many years, never leaving. He was one of the more powerful cultivators among the Nine Surnames, but his age was great. Now, with his grandfather Li Muyan's ascension, the clan had risen to the second-strongest position. They were in an era of prosperity; how could they risk provoking such trouble?

'Is it really a coincidence? Or is some other family trying to set us up!' He rushed back to his estate. With a few quick palm strikes, he obliterated several demonic cultivators who had been lurking by the mountain, and then immediately took to the air, hurrying to send a report back to his clan.

Sun-Worshipping Mountain.

Li Ximing descended on a beam of light and found the mountain relatively peaceful. Dingyang Zi's apprentices recognized him and hurried over to pay their respects.

Once in Qize, the chaos of Wu State seemed more distant. This area, unlike the densely populated prefectures, was mostly wild mountains and great marshes. With several rogue Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in residence, large-scale conflict was rare.

Although Dingyang Zi was seated by his furnace, chanting and forming seals to control the spiritual flames, Li Ximing could tell from his expression that his mood was foul. In fact, he looked downright grim.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing returned the greeting. His mind was still heavy with questions, so he didn't even ask about the spiritual resources he had come for. Instead, he immediately raised the issue of Wu State. "I saw a vast expanse of white light in the Great Void, in the direction of Mount Changhuai. On my way here, I found all of Wu State has fallen into chaos. Do you know what has happened?"

Hearing this, Dingyang Zi let out a heavy sigh. He turned away from the fire, invited Li Ximing to sit with him in the pavilion, and poured him some tea. He shook his head. "The Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel has shattered."

Seeing Li Ximing's confused look, Dingyang Zi said softly, "Do you know Daoist Master Pingwen? Or, to put it another way... have you heard of Qing Tangyin?"

Li Ximing stroked his beard. "Qing Tangyin... He was a Great Daoist Master of Mount Changhuai."

Li Ximing had indeed heard the name. Right after his breakthrough, when he had gone to the Azure Pond Sect to visit Yuanxiu, he had been present when this same Great Daoist Master fell, causing a massive shift in the spiritual atmosphere.

Dingyang Zi nodded, his expression complex. "Pingwen was his Daoist title. He was born in the Ji State and adventured there in his early years, so he was never well-known in Jiangnan. The Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel was his personal treasure."

"Oh?"

"The Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel is a Spiritual Artifact, but it's no ordinary one. It was cultivated through a specific Dao Lineage, and it's even rumored to be connected to True Monarch Tianwu. It is incredibly potent. He was renowned for it..."

As he spoke, Dingyang Zi's expression turned odd. "He was a capable man in all respects, save one: his miserliness. He was infamous for it among Purple Mansion Realm cultivators."

He shook his head. "Let me give you an example... He had an heir, Qing Jifang, who was also a real piece of work. Before he even reached the Purple Mansion Realm, he was out causing trouble, getting into a rivalry with Touba Lan. When Touba Lan came to visit their Daoist tradition as a guest, Qing Jifang announced he wanted to take out the treasure to show it off..."

"At the time... I and several other Daoist Masters were present, helping Daoist Master Pingwen examine a spirit embryo. We all saw the young master come and ask..."

Li Ximing sensed this story was taking a turn. Dingyang Zi continued slowly, "Daoist Master Pingwen just said, 'This is an artifact of True Martial. I obtained it through my own destiny. What does it have to do with you? What is there to see?'"

The old man gave a sarcastic smile. "Qing Jifang was defiant. He actually dared to mutter under his breath, 'There will come a day when I can look at it!'"

"Oho!" That was an audacious thing to say. Ximing was stunned speechless for a moment. He didn't know how to respond, so he just shook his head with a private, wry smile. "Well, Senior Pingwen did have that son late in life, and only with the help of the precious Radiant Profound Origin. A little spoiling is to be expected..."

Li Ximing had only heard this secret from the Cui family when he was asking about Radiant Profound Origin. Dingyang Zi seemed surprised that he knew of it and paused for a second before continuing, "Daoist Master Pingwen was not a forgiving man. He summoned his son and said, 'Then watch.'"

"The Daoist Master immediately retrieved the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel. He used a profound divine ability to lock it within the Great Void, integrating it with the sect's grand array. He transformed it into a unique type of Spiritual Artifact, one that could never again be removed."

Li Ximing hid a smile. But Dingyang Zi said, "But as I said before, this was not a man who would accept a loss!"

"At first, everyone just treated it as a joke. But as time went on, the cultivators of Mount Changhuai continuously refined and inscribed upon it. The artifact began to spread its power through the Great Void, linking with Mount Changhuai's grand array. It then extended downward, flowing along the earth veins to regulate the spiritual tides and spirit veins of the entire region, secretly bringing them all into profound unity."

"The artifact became a treasure linked to his personal cultivation. He may not have controlled all the spiritual tides and earth veins shifts in the land, but he could influence at least fifty or sixty percent of them. More importantly, it placed a shackle on every power, large and small, under his rule..."

Li Ximing nodded silently, but Dingyang Zi laughed without restraint. "The Daoist Masters of Qize have a running joke: cultivating in Wu State, not only must you pay your tribute, but if you absorb too much Spiritual Qi... you have to pay Daoist Master Pingwen an extra spirit stone!"

Li Ximing sighed inwardly. 'What a pair, that father and son...'

Dingyang Zi's smile faded, his expression growing calm once more as he returned to the point. "And now, that Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel has been shattered."

"Mount Changhuai spent all those years regulating the spirit veins and laying down array nodes, painstakingly building this supreme method for controlling all of Wu State. With the shattering of that artifact, all that effort has dissolved into clouds of True Qi!"

Li Ximing frowned, the pieces clicking into place. 'No wonder the spiritual tides shifted and the Baleful Earth erupted...' He spoke aloud, "This will certainly be a headache for Mount Changhuai."

"Haha!" Dingyang Zi shook his head, a strange look on his old face. "The ones with the headache are the Nine Surnames! After Mount Changhuai lifted the prohibitions, there were very few annexations. That just proves the lands had already been carved up by the deeply entrenched, allied Nine Surnames. Now that this has happened... who knows who will come out on top!"

Li Ximing still felt something wasn't right. He nodded outwardly, but his mind was racing. 'What kind of Daoist tradition is Mount Changhuai? It's one where a True Monarch has manifested! If they truly didn't want the territories in the hands of powerful clans, why would they have spent centuries fostering the Nine Surnames? Giving the prefecture to them was almost certainly a deliberate, long-term arrangement. This sudden upheaval... they must be plotting something.'

'In this day and age... not a single great power is content to stay still.'

He set the topic aside and asked, "Daoist Friend, the reason you invited me here this time was..."

Dingyang Zi calmly averted his gaze. He retrieved two jade boxes from his sleeve, placed them gently on the table, and said in a low voice, "Daoist Friend, please see for yourself."

Li Ximing used a divine ability to open the first box. Inside lay a crimson-gold stone, about the size of a fingernail. Its edges shimmered with a bright white light, and a dense aura of Radiant Fire qi washed over him, coalescing into the phantom shapes of various birds around the box.

Heavenly Star Crimson Gold.

Dingyang Zi said slowly, "This is half a portion of Heavenly Star Crimson Gold. Daoist Master Luo acquired it."

He set that box aside and opened the second. A brilliant light burst forth. Inside was a pool of liquid like a white ocean, faintly refracting multicolored light. The moment it was exposed, however, the light quickly retracted into itself.

"This one is a 'Wandering Metal,' the Huakan Golden Essence."

"'Wandering Metal'? That is rare in Jiangnan," Li Ximing remarked.

Dingyang Zi placed a hand on the jade box, his expression turning serious. "I am acting on another's behalf, so I must be very clear about this transaction."

"This Heavenly Star Crimson Gold is a high-grade spiritual resource, and Radiant Fire materials are always in demand. This item is considered excellent even among Radiant Fire resources, as it has many uses. Your Marvelous Wisdom Whisker, while also rare, was only sufficient to trade for this half-portion. In truth, he only had this half-portion to begin with."

Li Ximing understood perfectly well how much "padding" was in the phrase "while also rare." A spiritual resource derived from a spiritual plant simply couldn't compare to a pure elemental metal like this. From a theoretical standpoint, among the Five Virtues, Wood was the weakest. Spiritual fruits and whiskers were almost always inferior to materials of a flourishing virtue like Radiant Fire.

He shook his head and replied, "To get even half a portion is an excellent outcome."

"Good," Dingyang Zi acknowledged with a smile. "As for this Huakan Golden Essence, it can wash away aberrant light, conceal one's traces, and even help shed karmic ties. It is a rare treasure. It is said that while Geng-Dui is variable, Wandering Metal is balanced. It forms only after being buried deep in the earth, hidden from the world for six hundred years. Very little of it circulates."

"Most importantly, Wandering Metal does not conflict with your Bright Yang attributes. It's often called the 'metal of carefree nurturing' or the 'metal of no cause and no effect.' It can be added to most Spiritual Artifacts without conflict."

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly. His family had encountered a descendant of the Wandering Metal True Monarch—the man known as the Sword Immortal King—so he had a profound appreciation for this "carefree nurturing." He smiled. "And this is from...?"

Dingyang Zi smiled. "Daoist Master Junjian came to my little mountain a few months ago, seeking to trade for something. When he heard I was in contact with you, he was delighted and left this item specifically, instructing me to trade it to you."

"What!" It was the first time in many years that Li Ximing had heard the name Tu Longjian. This was the Daoist Master who had once called Li Yuanjiao his benefactor, but who had, in the end, become the Li family's benefactor instead. He shot to his feet, excited. "Has Senior Tu Long returned to the sect?!"

Dingyang Zi shook his head. "He is currently in the Northern Sea seeking an item. He came to me looking for a spiritual resource of 'Cold Qi'—Cold Cloud Heart-Iron—which he needs to forge a Spiritual Sword."

"Cold Cloud Heart-Iron?" Li Ximing was puzzled. "I don't understand. Why would he forge a Cold Qi Spiritual Sword? Firstly, he doesn't use a sword. And secondly... his Molten Fire Dao is one of the very things that counters Cold Qi..."

Dingyang Zi smiled, shook his head, and sipped his tea. "That's where you're mistaken. The Slaughter Jun Gate originally cultivated cold baleful energy. He naturally wishes to revive his sect's Dao Lineage. I hear he has a junior he values greatly, one who cultivates Cold Qi. About ten years ago, that junior went into seclusion to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Tu Longjian is just preparing for a rainy day."

"I see," Li Ximing said thoughtfully. "It must be for that Gao Xuanzi..."

Dingyang Zi replied, "I have no idea who... I just recall he was smiling and said something about... it being your job to find it."

"But of course!" Li Ximing nodded with a smile. "After all, Ning Wan cultivates Cold Qi, so she has plenty of connections. Plus, Tianwan is in the Eastern Sea. Senior Tu Longjian doesn't want to get involved in any trouble, especially given his past unpleasantness with Tianwan. This is a task for me. I'll ask a few Daoist friends to see to it."

"Excellent!" Dingyang Zi agreed at once, his mood clearly improved. He raised a hand, took out another box, and smiled. "As for this Cangzhou Serpent Scale..."

"Leave it to me!" Li Ximing agreed readily, wishing Dingyang Zi had even more to offer. He was suddenly reminded of the other Cangzhou Serpent Scale he had already acquired, and felt an awkward twinge. 'I can't very well take that one out now. The Pit Water attribute is useless to me; trading it to him for other spiritual resources would have been a good idea... Well, since I have it, I'll just use it to trade for the Cold Cloud Heart-Iron.'

Having accepted the task, his thoughts turned. He retrieved a small, glazed bottle from his sleeve. Inside, a gray, hazy substance drifted uncertainly.

This was something Kong Guxi had brought to the Li Clan back during the fall of Profound Peak. It was rumored to be the scales of a Purple Mansion Realm Demon beast, but no one had ever identified it. All they knew was that it was a Pit Water item, and thus, useless to them.

Since he was coming to Sun-Worshipping Mountain this time, he recalled that the medicinal pills Dingyang Zi himself consumed were of the Pit Water attribute. And Pit Water itself was closely related to the Upper Shaman path. He had specially brought the item to let the old man examine it.

Dingyang Zi picked up the glazed bottle. After a careful look, his expression turned to one of shock. He studied it for a long moment, a fiery heat rising in his eyes. "Daoist Friend," he said, his voice tense, "where did you obtain this?"

Li Ximing had no idea where Changxi had scrounged it up, so he offered a vague excuse.

Dingyang Zi said in admiration, "This is Heart-Armor of the Yù-Beast. It's as fine as dust, and they are indeed scales... but this item is profound and special. It absolutely must not be used to forge a Spiritual Artifact."

"Oh?" Li Ximing was intrigued.

Dingyang Zi continued, "There isn't much of it, but its quality and origin are extraordinarily high, rarely seen in this day and age. I've heard it's meant to be consumed. You must preserve it well. When you find the right time to use a spiritual item of this caliber, it will surely be for a monumental purpose."

Li Ximing had never held high expectations for the items left behind by Daoist Master Changxi. Hearing such a lofty evaluation, he was inwardly shocked. 'Is it really that valuable? No wonder Changxi never used it, even at his death... That old man was more complex than he appeared. He collected quite a few treasures over the years, to say nothing of that demonic embryo...'

'I should ask Senior Chuting about this as well.'

He offered his thanks. After these transactions, his trust in Dingyang Zi had grown considerably. He took out the piece of Blameless Spirit Wood from Chen Yin and handed it over. After a quick calculation, he said, "Senior Chen traded this to me. I hear it's used for making sword hilts, which I have no use for. I'll entrust it to you. If Senior Tu Longjian can use it, please give it to him. If not, perhaps you could trade it to someone else on my behalf."

Tu Longjian had avoided meeting his family several times now. Li Ximing understood that he had his reservations. Perhaps it was because of Li Zhouwei, or perhaps there was some other reason that made a meeting inconvenient.

But judging by his willingness to provide spiritual resources, his heart was still with their family. Li Ximing decided not to cause him any more trouble. Asking Dingyang Zi to be the intermediary was killing two birds with one stone.

After settling matters with Dingyang Zi, he summoned his light and flew straight for the Eastern Sea.

Xuanmiao Temple.

The ancient, simple pavilion stood quietly in the mountain forest, dotted with pale golden lamplight that gave it an elegant air.

Years of repeated warfare had ravaged Jiangbei, transforming the landscape. Forget pavilions, few of the original mountain forests even remained. Yet Xuanmiao Temple had escaped disaster time and again. The pavilion Sumian had personally built all those years ago still stood.

A young man in a tall white-gauze cap and black robes embroidered with mystic clouds sat on the steps. He held two or three bone tablets in his hand, tapping them together with a crisp, clear sound. The door behind him was tightly shut. He smiled. "Daoist Friend Murong has arrived."

The Great Void tore open, and a portly man stepped out. His complexion was rather unsightly. With his hands clasped behind his back, he nodded. "Lord Qi, you seem truly at ease."

Seeing Murong Yan safe and sound, a flash of disappointment crossed Qi Lanyan's heart. He smiled. "Naturally, I cannot compare to Daoist Friend Murong. While you were fighting in Jiangbei, you had a crowd of cultivators to protect you. How could that compare to my lonely vigil here at Xuanmiao Temple?"

Murong Yan heard the sarcasm but merely laughed instead of growing angry. "I was indeed injured," he replied. "Otherwise, I would not have waited so long to seek out Lord Qi."

Murong Yan understood perfectly. Xindu had been the sacrifice in that battle. He himself was never in any real danger. Qi Lanyan's mention of a "crowd of cultivators" was not an exaggeration, even if they hadn't been there to protect him specifically.

He, Murong Yan, knew that many of the higher-ups coveted Wanling Heaven. He even knew that Xindu, with his Floating Cloud Body, would never meet a good end. But he had miscalculated one crucial point: he never expected that day to come so soon.

Even though he himself was unharmed, he felt a profound sense of crisis. He had been kept completely in the dark about Xindu. That was enough.

After retreating from the river, he had sent several letters back to his clan. But the very same lords who had sworn oaths and guaranteed his safety had all fallen silent. They merely offered placating words, urging him to focus on seizing treasures within Wanling Heaven.

'Those bastards sitting high and mighty in the Buddhist Land... they couldn't possibly have been ignorant of Xindu's fate. This was all deliberate. They deliberately kept me in the dark!'

Murong Yan was almost certain that not long after he left the Yan State, a drastic and silent shift in policy had occurred. It was a shift that excluded him—and might even be designed to get him killed.

A deep shadow passed through his seemingly dull eyes as suspicion solidified in his heart. 'I am walking on thin ice.'
