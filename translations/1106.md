# Chapter 1106: Convergent Paths

As Qi Lanyan watched Tao Jiexing ride the wind and depart, his expression turned utterly foul. Rage and hatred coiled in his chest with no outlet. Clasping his hands behind his back, he paced three or four steps across the great hall, his silence heavy.

Below, the Daoist-robed man, Fan Kang, waited for some time. He repeatedly glanced up, trying to read his master's shifting expression, and realized he could no longer remain silent. Daring not to mention the matter of Vast Cicada, he could only broach another topic.

"Master... with Baixiang Valley lost... I fear we can no longer keep the enemy out of the Central Plains. The Buddhist cultivators are fickle, but fortunately... the White Ye Immortal Sect is still in our hands."

"It's useless even if we have it!"

The sharp retort stunned Fan Kang into silence. His brow furrowed with worry. He had no choice but to change tactics, saying reluctantly:

"If they move north after taking Baixiang... beyond Baixiang lies the Central Plains, and its defenses are empty... If they became the first cultivators in centuries to breach the North... perhaps that would..."

This only made the youth in the high seat laugh, a sound devoid of humor.

"Yang Ruiyi would never attack Luoxia... not and provoke the northern kings and all the great clans! The Great Song's wings aren't fully grown. Wasn't killing Vast Cicada enough for him? Does he want to send the entire northern court into an uproar? Li Zhouwei is certainly not stupid enough to walk into such a trap!"

He paused, swallowing his next words, and let out a sigh.

"I almost wish he would continue north. It would save us the headache. But I see it... nine times out of ten, he's coming for White Ye."

Fan Kang understood his implication and said quickly:

"We must dispatch men at once..."

Qi Lanyan shot him a cold look.

"And if I send my people to White Ye, what happens when Yang Ruiyi attacks Shanji Prefecture?"

Fan Kang fell silent once more. Qi Lanyan ground his teeth.

"Baixiang Valley was a total rout. With Vast Cicada dead, we've lost a key general, but the situation isn't beyond saving... The real trouble is that our forces there were completely scattered. Not a single one of those Daoist Masters is a fool, and the South's Exiled Qi is terrifying. They're all nursing their wounds; none of them will show their faces anytime soon. Will Touba Ci listen to me? And we can forget about Chengyun. At best, we can only count on Murong Yan and the Helian clan..."

This was the problem that always plagued Qi Lanyan. The various Daoist Masters of the South, despite their different Dao Lineages, were united—at least outwardly—under the pressure of imperial power and True Qi. The cultivators of the North, however, had nearly all come only because they were summoned. If there was no profit in it, who would be willing to die?

These Purple Mansion Realm cultivators ultimately had a say in things; they couldn't be ordered about like servants. Both sides had suffered a defeat, but the Great Zhao's reaction speed was far slower. As it stood, the forces he had on hand were actually at a slight disadvantage against the South.

This put Qi Lanyan in an extremely awkward position. The Exiled Qi and True Qi were potent. Li Zhouwei, Liu Bai... even Situ Huo were all formidable figures. If the North couldn't establish overwhelming dominance against the South, they were likely facing a second rout!

A tremor of fear ran through Qi Lanyan.

'Once they take White Ye as well, the entire western Jiangbei region, the land between the two rivers, will be consolidated. Taking it back then will be immensely more difficult... And the next thing we'll lose is Shanji Prefecture!'

Cold sweat began to bead on his forehead. Fan Kang, who had been playing dumb and subtly guiding the conversation for some time, finally saw his opening. He took a step forward, revealing his true idea.

"In my view... why not strike Baixiang Valley?"

Qi Lanyan, who had opened his mouth to speak, paused. He looked thoughtful.

"Continue."

Fan Kang quickly organized his thoughts, speaking in a low voice.

"Master... Yang Ruiyi's heart is surely still set on Shanji Prefecture. Baixiang Valley is not his primary target. But if he moves to attack the Capital immortals Dao, Baixiang will almost certainly be left undefended. If we negotiate with Jiang Toushou and offer to move west to pin down their forces, he'll almost certainly be tempted. Retaking Baixiang Valley would also restore some of the honor his Mount Dayang has lost..."

"The key point is... those forces won't have to come from our own reserves."

Qi Lanyan nodded. Fan Kang pressed on.

"As for the Capital immortals Dao... in your disciple's opinion, the South is determined to have it. It's indefensible..."

Qi Lanyan's face darkened further. He was about to speak, but Fan Kang cut in.

"But if we take Baixiang Valley, even as we lose the Capital immortals Dao... what does that situation remind you of, Master?"

Qi Lanyan was quiet for a moment. Fan Kang continued:

"The previous life..."

He barely got the words out before the Daoist Master before him silenced him with a fierce glare. Fan Kang immediately corrected himself.

"The Heavenly Element... the vision from the Heavenly Element."

"If nothing had gone awry, that Wei villain should only have had two divine abilities. Originally, Yang Ruiyi was supposed to defend Tangdao Mountain personally, while Vast Cicada's ambush failed. White Ye was to be seized by Li Zhouwei, and Liu Bai and the others would be defending the Shanji Prefecture region..."

"It was precisely because we anticipated the arrangements of the last life that we put so much faith in the Exiled Qi on Tangdao Mountain, thinking we could avoid changing the grand scheme... We never expected to be used, and for the situation to worsen... But, if we proceed as I've suggested..."

Qi Lanyan's eyes lit with understanding.

"If we trade the Capital immortals Dao for Baixiang Valley... the overall situation will be functionally identical to the previous life!"

Fan Kang hurried forward.

"Exactly! As long as we can stabilize Shanji Prefecture, the Great Adoration Dharma Realm cannot sit idly by. They won't watch the Precious Tusk fall into others' hands. Whether they push someone new forward or send reinforcements south, it won't make much difference in the short term."

"What we must do is keep the grand situation unchanged... only then can we maximize the advantage of the Heavenly Element's foresight!"

Qi Lanyan was actually listening. He looked up, his mind working.

"The real changes are that Vast Cicada is dead... and that Li Zhouwei somehow reached the mid-Purple Mansion Realm... The grand scheme must remain the same... That is the only way to maintain our advantage..."

Even as they discussed the tactical shifts, the very words 'Li Zhouwei's mid-Purple Mansion Realm' left a taste of disbelief in his mouth.

"It completely defies all reason!"

To Qi Lanyan, the matter was simply inexplicable. His plan had been more perfect than the Heavenly Element's vision. He had borrowed a Spiritual Treasure and grievously wounded the man. Even if Li Zhouwei healed, his cultivation should have stagnated—so how did he break through instead?

'Don't tell me the more grievous your injuries are, Li Zhouwei, the faster you cultivate!'

This was a disastrous turn of events. Li Zhouwei's Crimson Severing Arrowhead was one of the most detestable of all Bright Yang divine abilities. With that ability mastered, the difficulty of cornering and killing him had just doubled.

'To say nothing of Li Ximing gaining the World's Radiance!'

Though he now saw the best path to mitigate his losses, his heart remained shrouded in gloom. He suddenly snapped:

"I'm asking you—Li Zhouwei... why did he suddenly reach the mid-Purple Mansion Realm!"

Qi Lanyan's mood shifted as fast as turning a page. Fan Kang, still basking in the relief of having convinced him, never expected the sudden, sharp question. He flinched, his entire body trembling, and stammered:

"Disciple... Disciple doesn't know!"

Qi Lanyan's eyes narrowed, a new suspicion dawning.

"You claimed to know everything about his Quest for Gold. You said you even participated in the final battle, only to be cut down by some 'General Chen'... And yet you 'misheard' his cultivation progress?"

Fan Kang was struck dumb, mumbling:

"Disciple truly doesn't know... Disciple..."

Fan Kang mumbled for a long time before a sudden spark of insight lit his mind. He gasped, clapping his hands.

"Disciple understands!"

Qi Lanyan watched him coldly as Fan Kang rushed to explain.

"I understand! The Great Song... and even Moongaze Lake... they must also be favored by the Heavenly Element! Li Ximing never left Ting Province for the Western Sea—it wasn't because my plan disrupted things, it was interference from another 'child' of the Heavenly Element!"

He was struck by the revelation, practically cheering his own conclusion. But Qi Lanyan merely gave him a cool look and sneered.

"Ting Province? Favored by the Heavenly Element? What fantasy are you dreaming up now?"

Rebuffed so sharply, Fan Kang grew even more frantic.

"Master, I..."

Qi Lanyan cut him off.

"There cannot be a Heavenly Element presence in Ting Province! The renowned Azure Insight Origin Mirror hangs over that very lake! How do you think that damnable troublemaker was annihilated back then? They relied on that supreme immortal artifact! The Heavenly Element can manifest in any corner of the world, but it absolutely cannot go to Ting Province!"

"If the direct heirs of the Li family really had knowledge of the future, would they be in their current state? Furthermore, this is hardly a secret to the great figures above. Do you think the myriad eyes in the heavens are blind?"

Fan Kang was speechless. Qi Lanyan, however, smiled.

"And it is especially impossible for it to be Li Zhouwei."

His words hung in the air. Fan Kang, unconvinced, pressed on.

"Then it must be... it must be one of the Great Song's high ministers! Someone who favors the Li clan, and that's why they interfered!"

Qi Lanyan clasped his hands behind his back and turned away.

"You ignorant boy... Do you think the Great Song truly lacks this Heavenly Element? Don't be naive. They are the Underworld, after all! Did you think you were hiding safely under my protection? The great figures in the heavens have known about you for a long time... and the Underworld knows, too! It's simply that none of those lofty figures wish to personally enter the fray and become entangled in the Heavenly Element's karma. So, they all remain silent!"

Fan Kang stared blankly, but Qi Lanyan's own understanding grew clearer by the second. He sneered.

"However, your reminder has made me understand... It's still uncertain if Yang Ruiyi can see the future. But the Underworld clearly wills the world's situation to conform to the Heavenly Element's prophecies. Otherwise, we wouldn't have this opportunity to trade Baixiang Valley for the Capital immortals Dao! You think this is 'convergent paths'? Wrong! It's that _They_ refuse to let it change!"

"The world's situation may not be in _Their_ hands, but it is squarely within _Their_ sight..."

He swallowed the rest of his sentence. His mind was suddenly clear, as if all the scattered pieces had clicked into place. He sneered inwardly.

'If the world's situation changes too drastically, how can those 'children' of the Heavenly Element exploit their foreknowledge? How could they unearth all the legacies of the Encompassing Profoundity? How could the Chuyi Grotto-Heaven be opened? How would the treasures beneath the first mountain continue to emerge? The death of Vast Cicada must have been an accident, one that certainly displeased the powers above!'

'What we alter... must absolutely not be the _current_ grand situation!'

With this realization, Qi Lanyan's mind was sharp and clear. He clapped his hands decisively.

"I understand! Have Gongsun Bei and the others pull back and go to Shanji Prefecture. I will go with the Helian clan to the Capital immortals Dao. We can't let them conquer it too quickly, or we won't have time to reclaim Baixiang Valley... As for that... Spiritual Treasure... I will find an opportunity to borrow it for Gongsun Bei."

His heart was at ease, but Fan Kang remained drenched in cold sweat, stunned speechless. He whispered,

"Then at the Capital immortals Dao... Nuzi and the others..."

Qi Lanyan sneered.

"Is there any need to ask? Even Tao Jiexing has fled. Do you really think those Buddhist cultivators will obediently stay and die for the Capital immortals Dao?"

But at the mention of Tao Jiexing, Qi Lanyan's tone filled with regret.

"It's a pity. The Tao family relationship is a delicate one to manage, and that Spiritual Qi is now unattainable..."

Fan Kang was jolted back to reality by the comment. He stood silent for a moment, feeling that the Qi Lanyan before him was not just paranoid... he was terrifying. His rebirth had given Qi Lanyan an overwhelming advantage, yet this Daoist Master's mind hadn't yielded in the slightest. Instead, he had only grown more stubborn.

'What in the world is he thinking! Is this path he's walking truly a path to survival?'

This thought tormented Fan Kang. He was not a fool. A man who held the future in his hands was bound to have his own calculations. He ventured:

"I understand... Daoist Master, you are thinking whole-heartedly of Sir Wei's interests. But if that is truly the case, you should be leaning on Sir Xue. And if that fails, you should at least be seeking help from the Chunyi Dao Gate..."

He had barely spoken the words when it was as if he had stepped on Qi Lanyan's tail. A flash of fear crossed the Daoist Master's face, instantly replaced by a cold, dark glare.

"The Wu Light and the Sky-Tower of Transformation are parallel Dao-paths. The Unmoving Temple was established long before the Tongxuan Palace... Even True Monarch Xu Xiang must show consideration for his juniors... My Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao may have been built later, but it inherited a true Dao Lineage and possesses its own dignity. Though we are diminished now, we are still under its protection. There is no 'relying' on that side... If you dare mention this again, do not blame me for cleaning the scum from my own house."

The threat snapped Fan Kang back to his senses. He remembered that this was a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, a being who could incinerate him with a single breath. The anxiety in his heart was instantly consumed by terror. He stumbled back a step, his voice trembling.

"Disciple misspoke!"

Qi Lanyan stared at him, his gaze heavy.

"You are merely too impatient. Withdraw and cultivate."

Fan Kang bowed hastily and stumbled away. Qi Lanyan stood alone in the vast hall, his expression cold and severe.

'Tao Jiexing is naive and untested, so easy to read. From his evasiveness, the Tao family must possess the Flawless Deficient Yin. They simply refuse to produce it.'

'Martial Uncle watched Tao Jiexing grow up. Even Vast Cicada had to call Martial Uncle 'senior'. Given the relationship between the Tao family and my Profound Governance, they have no reason to refuse... It seems someone is actively trying to prevent Martial Uncle from seeking the Dao. This situation plays perfectly into their hands!'

He walked to the entrance of the hall. Cool, clear moonlight spilled across the steps. Qi Lanyan felt a complex knot of emotions tighten in his chest.

"Without power, one cannot attain the Dao. Those who have no desire for it find themselves forced to succeed by others. Yet those who truly seek the Dao find their path blocked by a thousand obstacles."

He paced, unable to set his mind at ease. Turning, he went back inside and sat at his desk, an idea forming.

'Just asking the Chunyi Dao Gate isn't enough. Among the Supreme Yang daoist tradition, the Cheng clan is the only one that pretends to be aloof from the world. They have the least backbone. I must find a way to meet with them again.'

The Daoist Master sank deep into thought. Meanwhile, Fan Kang retreated in a daze, his heart overflowing with dread.

'If I continue to follow him... is there any path to survival left for me?'

In his previous life, Fan Kang had been nobody. He'd stumbled upon a great opportunity and nearly fallen into the hands of the Buddhist cultivators. It was Qi Lanyan who had rescued him, taking him—a minor cultivator with no background or foundation—as a disciple. He knew Qi Lanyan had selfish motives, but hadn't he also enjoyed all the benefits of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao? If Qi Lanyan had merely wanted to use him, there was no need to have ever accepted him as a disciple.

But seeing how stubborn his master was, Fan Kang was truly terrified. A thread of confusion wove through his fear.

'With my destiny from the Heavenly Element... if I were to join the Buddhists... wouldn't that also be a great destiny?'

Back then, joining the Buddhists as a mere commoner would have been valuable enough. Now, carrying the status of the Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao... it was icing on the cake. It was only his conscience that held him back.

'I'll take it one step at a time. If the situation becomes truly impossible... I still have a way out.'

...

The gray clouds hung low, and darkness shrouded the land.

A tall general, hefting a crimson axe, stood suspended in the pitch-black night. After a moment, he glanced at the woman beside him.

"The Exiled Qi and the Upper Shaman are Dao paths skilled in defense, not offense. They specialize in transformation and delay, not in overwhelming force. Yang Ruiyi may have many treasures, but he has not yet passed the Purple Mystery. You may rest easy, Daoist Friend."

His words sent a chill through Kong Tingyun's heart. Gongsun Bei had led Mingxiang and the others south to attack the Great Song. Kong Tingyun had seen long ago that Qi Lanyan had no real intention of achieving victory. This force would have been considerable elsewhere, but to think it could make a dent in the Great Song's heavily fortified Jiangnan was a fool's dream.

'He's just tying down their forces, keeping the Great Song from focusing elsewhere.'

Just as she'd thought. Gongsun Bei had no Spiritual Treasure. Their combined strength was only enough to let them advance and retreat at will within the Exiled Qi. But now, his words clearly signaled that the situation was about to be reversed.

She replied,

"My only concern is for the North."

Gongsun Bei sighed.

"That is beyond our control. We must simply await our orders."

His words were meant as comfort, but they only made Kong Tingyun feel more powerless. Her heart skipped.

'There must have been a great defeat.'

To put it nicely, she, Kong Tingyun, was a puppet. To put it bluntly, she was just a figurehead. But it was precisely this understanding of her own position that gave this intelligent woman an uncommon-sharpness.

Qi Lanyan had always been composed, or at least, he had always maintained the dignity befitting his Sky-Tower of Transformation Dao. He used to at least pretend to be her Daoist friend, discussing matters with her. But now, there was not a single scrap of news. This spoke volumes of the panic—or at least, the paranoia—back at Xuanmiao Temple.

'He's too preoccupied to bother with the pretense anymore.'

This was Kong Tingyun's sorrow. The puppet had been put back in her box. She could only stare silently at the black clouds overhead. Beside her, Gongsun Bei gave her a passing glance.

"Where is the disk for the grand-array?"

Kong Tingyun inclined her head in a polite gesture, sneering inwardly. Her face remained calm.

"Naturally, that is not information I possess."

Nearby, Kong Xiaxiang knelt at the foot of the steps, as still as a statue.

Gongsun Bei gave an awkward laugh, failing to hide the anxiety in his eyes. He stared grimly at the night sky, where a smear of silver-red, like tarnished mercury, was rapidly ascending. As if to break the tension, he frowned and muttered,

"I didn't expect that Cheng Qian to be here... His abilities are quite profound. It's fortunate his cultivation is still low, or he would be a serious problem."

Kong Tingyun said coolly,

"The General cultivates the Dawn Qi, after all. That Dao is known for its unstable main position and its powerful 'intercalary' branches. It is said that 'three parts become the dawn.' When encountering the Whole Pill, which masters transformation, it is natural that he would have many ways to counter you."

Gongsun Bei clearly hadn't expected such an analysis from her.

"You have sharp insight, Daoist Friend!"

Kong Tingyun replied, her voice even.

"I was, after all, acknowledged by the Zhaoyao Mountain lineage. By that measure, I suppose I count as a disciple of Comprehending Profoundity. I have read a Daoist text or two. I cannot compare to the General's vast, battle-won experience."

Though Kong Tingyun was mild and gentle by nature, she was not one to suffer a slight. Her words were like a needle hidden in silk, a subtle warning. Gongsun Bei's talent was high, and he had carved out a great name for himself, but compared to the direct bloodlines of the True Monarchs or the orthodox Dao Lineages of the Three Profoundities, he was nothing. If he were, he wouldn't be in his current position, ordered about by all and sundry.

A thousand years prior, had Kong Tingyun possessed her current Purple Mansion Realm cultivation _and_ her Zhaoyao Mountain lineage, Gongsun Bei would have had to address her as 'Your Excellency'.

He looked as if he wanted to speak, but held his tongue, a new layer of caution in his eyes.

"My apologies... I overstepped."

After a long moment, a streak of light retreated from the fray. It was a monk, clutching a treasure. His face was pale, his body battered, and he descended without a word.

It was Mingxiang.

Gongsun Bei immediately shot into the sky to take his place in the formation. Mingxiang brushed the lingering Exiled Qi from his robes and spat out a mouthful of black blood. His expression, however, was free of worry. He smiled at Kong Tingyun.

"Many thanks for your protection, Daoist Friend."

Kong Tingyun was not a rigid person. Furthermore, since reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, she had come to understand certain... less-known aspects of Daoist Master Changxi. She even knew that Changxi had once been on friendly terms with Tian Langzhi. The Way of Great Desire was infinitely more cruel than the Lotus Temple. She pressed her palms together.

"Great Virtue, you are too kind."

Mingxiang smiled.

"Sect Master, you worry too much."

Kong Tingyun sighed.

"With Exiled Qi filling the heavens, how can I not?"

Mingxiang waved his hand, switching his form of address.

"Patron, be at ease. The grand-array here is not much inferior to the one Yang Ruiyi established on Tangdao Mountain. The South may be able to break it, but not easily."

The monk chuckled.

"Patron, you see these northern cultivators with their profound cultivation, and these Buddhist cultivators acting so arrogantly, but in truth, their situation is far worse than yours. If something truly goes wrong, they die, and that's the end of it. But you? You have the entire Profound Governance, and even greater powers, ensuring your safety."

Kong Tingyun looked at him as he continued.

"What you need to do now is not worry, but to cultivate and break through with all your ability. If you can pass the Purple Mystery, even the masters of Comprehending Profoundity will have to look at you in a new light!"

"Thank you for the reminder, Daoist Friend."

Kong Tingyun was exceptionally bright; it wasn't that she didn't understand this. But of all the cultivators who had come and gone, it was Mingxiang, a monk, who had set aside status to speak such truths to her. She felt a flicker of acknowledgment, followed by a wave of profound bitterness.

'But how much time will I be given? Fifty years? A hundred? Pass the Purple Mystery? My aptitude is dull. It was a monumental struggle just to reach the Purple Mansion Realm. How can I possibly cultivate faster than the likes of Qi Lanyan?'

She lowered her gaze.

'Even with... even with the Art of Rebirth, the chances are slim.'

Kong Tingyun lapsed into silence. An unknown amount of time passed, until suddenly, the gray winds in the sky began to roll back. The spiritual brilliance faded, and all the profound abilities retracted at once, like a great whale inhaling the sea. They vanished back into the dark hall, and the sky fell quiet.

Both she and Mingxiang stared, stunned. Kong Tingyun's hands immediately flew into a series of seals. Just as she began to cast, a deafening, earth-shaking roar of cheers erupted from the foot of the mountain. It came in waves, one louder than the next.

"Great victory at Baixiang Valley!"

The cry seemed to shake the heavens. Kong Tingyun was momentarily speechless. Beside her, however, Mingxiang clapped his hands, his face a mask of pure mockery.

"Oh!"

Then, another cry,

"Vast Cicada has been slain!"

The monk looked even more delighted. His mouth moved, but no sound came out. Kong Tingyun could just barely make out the word he was mouthing.

'Wonderful!'

But she had no time to spare for the feuds between monks. Her gaze was fixed on the southern horizon, which was awash in spectacular color.

Illusory rainbows wheeled across the sky. A deluge of what looked like blood-rain fell, and within the roiling crimson clouds, a great tomb seemed to be sealing itself shut as countless sacrificial objects tumbled from the sky. Kong Tingyun whispered:

"Who has fallen?"

Mingxiang frowned, his fingers blurring as he tried to calculate. But the threads of destiny were a tangled mess. Based on only the roughest deductions, he shook his head.

"No one has fallen... Someone in the Great Song has broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm."

Kong Tingyun focused her gaze, her expression turning grim.

"In Linhai Prefecture."

Mingxiang looked thoughtful.

"That... King of Nanjia, from the Lingu clan?"

"No... The Lingu clan is spent. Lingu Lanying was an accident. How could there be a second? For such a heaven-shaking phenomenon, their Dao Lineage and foundation must be astonishing..."

Kong Tingyun closed her eyes, a look of dread on her face.

"It is the Great Xiukui Monastery."
