# Chapter 1035: Changes in the Northwest

‘But today… I am not in a position to speak of such things!’

Ning Wan paused. Across from her, Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, rising from his seat to pace the floor.

"I've heard," he began, "that Daoist Master Ning presented a dragon's tendon to the Song Emperor."

A sorrowful look slowly clouded Ning Wan's features. "That is correct," she replied.

Li Zhouwei spun around. "Which dragon scion was it?" he demanded.

A dragon's tendon was one of the rarest treasures in the world. Forget using one; merely possessing such a thing was enough to send a chill down a man's spine.

Every member of the Dragon-kin was accounted for, and the disappearance of any one of them would be known instantly. Ning Wan's act was not just a declaration of loyalty to the Song Emperor; it was a resounding slap in the face to the Dragon-kin before the eyes of the entire world. It was an unprecedented act, at least in this era.

This wasn't just her affair. It would have a profound impact on the relationship between the Underworld and the Dragon-kin.

Ning Wan let out a long breath. "Dongfang Ai, of the White Dragon lineage."

Li Zhouwei’s voice dropped to a low murmur. "How did you come by it?"

She shook her head, her voice trembling slightly.

"It was left behind by the Daoist Master… Someone advised me on its nature and how to use it to ensure my survival."

The woman lifted her head, her soft yet resolute gaze meeting his.

"This treasure was what the Emperor wanted," she said, her teeth clenched. "If I didn't give it to him… someone else would have come to take it! What choice did I have? Only by burning my bridges could I find a sliver of hope. From this day forward, the Ning clan can never again sail the seas. Our fortunes are now bound to the Great Song, to rise and fall together!"

Li Zhouwei stared at her, his expression grim. He wasn't surprised by her decision, but he was astonished that Daoist Master Yuansu was at the center of it. A flicker of disbelief colored his eyes.

‘Daoist Master Yuansu… just Daoist Master Yuansu? Even if he possesses a Spiritual Treasure, he's still just a cultivator with a single divine ability. Don't the dragons have Spiritual Treasures of their own? How could he possibly slay a dragon?’

‘And even if he could, why provoke the Dragon-kin? Why push the Ning clan into such a desperate corner? Even if he foresaw this day, there was no need for such a dangerous gamble!’

Li Zhouwei remained unconvinced.

"What Dao did Dongfang Ai cultivate?" he asked quietly.

Ning Wan closed her eyes. "True Qi!"

The answer made Li Zhouwei slowly straighten up. He turned back to the window and posed his final question.

"How will the dragon tendon be used?"

Ning Wan glanced at him.

"Tianwu possessed three Dharma Treasures," she explained.

"The first was the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel, the second was the True Adherence and Abstruse Strategy Whip, and the third was the Martial Seal of Authority and Karma."

"Of these, the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel was a Rank Designation and has long since been shattered. The Martial Seal of Authority and Karma and the True Adherence and Abstruse Strategy Whip were both inherited from his father, the King of Jiangling. They were once mortal items, but ascended with the Emperor to the realms beyond."

Her voice was haunting.

"The Martial Seal of Authority and Karma… the imperial lineage prepared it long ago. They began refining it when the King of Yue first conquered the lands, and it has now reached the pinnacle of Spiritual Artifacts. As for the True Adherence and Abstruse Strategy Whip…"

She met Li Zhouwei's gaze and stated flatly,

"It must be reforged upon the Emperor's ascension. For that, this dragon tendon is required."

Li Zhouwei didn't flinch.

"Was this all calculated by Senior Yuansu?" he asked calmly.

Ning Wan's pupils dilated slightly, a flicker of panic in her eyes. She kept her head down, staring at the teacup before her.

"Perhaps," she murmured, "he received guidance from someone of an even higher station."

Li Zhouwei fell silent for a moment, his gaze drifting past the window frame to the heavens beyond. Billowing clouds and crackling lightning were gathering on the horizon, roiling and surging over the immutable peaks of the Western Mountains before unleashing a torrential downpour.

Through the heavy rain, faint streaks of pale light could be seen zipping through the air-likely escape lights. As the storm clouds blotted out the sky, Li Zhouwei drew his gaze back inside. Ning Wan remained with her head bowed, cradling her cup in silence.

In the span of a few breaths, a burly, bear-chested man in bronze armor landed before the hall. He dropped to one knee with a clang, his breathing heavy.

"Your Majesty! Guyan Temple was besieged and has fallen! The enemy is advancing and has almost reached the Western Mountains!"

Li Zhouwei, his back to the soldier, did not reply. Instead, he slowly looked down at the desk where the resplendent Campaign Cloak of King Wei, with its brilliant, well-defined feathers, lay folded next to a profound banner of violet-blue and black-gold brocade. In the dimming light, their glow seemed all the more piercing.

Ning Wan rose to her feet, lifted the jade tray holding the cloak, and bowed. 

"King Wei… please!"

Li Zhouwei snatched the cloak, giving her one last, deep look without a word. With his other hand, he picked up the violet-blue and black-gold banner and gave it a light shake.

Swish…

In an instant, the banner unfurled into a massive azure and violet standard. A radiant qilin pattern shimmered upon it, majestic and inviolable. Li Zhouwei grasped the pure black staff and struck it against the ground with a resounding clang.

Without a second glance, he handed the royal standard to Zhouda, draped the Campaign Cloak over his shoulders, and strode out of the hall, leaving behind a single, calm, and powerful command:

"March on Guyan."

Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain.

The Golden Hall shone with a glassy, lustrous light. Rows of lotus thrones descended in tiers, surrounded by a forest of golden statues of all sizes, each holding a different golden instrument.

The highest thrones glowed most brilliantly, occupied by several Buddhist cultivators of varying appearances. They avoided each other's gazes, their mutual wariness palpable.

At the very top, a figure sat cloaked in a simple gray robe, a violet, multicolored light flowing around him. His face was a disturbing sight, covered in a dense cluster of small, dark eyes on his forehead and cheeks, all darting about observantly.

This was Maha Zhelu of Turbid Emptiness, a Liangli of the Way of Emptiness.

The Way of Emptiness ultimately lacked a deep foundation. Though Zhelu held the noble rank of Liangli, he had only reached the threshold of the sixth life. His Dao lineage held little prestige, and the high-ranking monks seated around him refused to meet his gaze. But with so many eyes roving across his face, it was impossible for them to avoid his stare completely. Several Mahas nearly twisted their necks trying to look away.

In the middle of the hall, a pale pink Golden Lotus Seat was in bloom. Maha Minghui was propped up on one hand, feigning a nap while his narrowed eyes scanned the assembly.

‘How the times have changed…’ he thought. ‘The landlords and magnates are holding a meeting and have put Compassion’s dog in the seat of honor.’

With the founding of the Great Song, Jiangnan had become a tough nut to crack. Since Buddhist cultivators had always bullied the weak and feared the strong, the Mahas of Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain were all looking for a way out. Only Minghui, who knew the score, feigned sleep.

After a moment of observation, Zhelu's gaze turned cold. He pressed his palms together.

"Everyone… since word has come from the north, we should proceed south."

The hall was silent. Zhelu waited for a long while before finally asking,

"Why is everyone so quiet?"

A nearby Golden Lotus Seat stirred. The six-armed, four-legged Maha Nuzi looked up. Though his cultivation was far below Zhelu's, his background as a confidant of the Peacock from the Great Desire afforded him considerable status.

"I wonder why Immortal Envoy Qi suddenly changed his mind and sent Gongsun Bei over," he said calmly.

"It seems an unnecessary complication. Now our own people are in an awkward position, unsure whether to go or stay…"

Wary of Nuzi’s connections, Zhelu put on a smile. "That is… difficult to speak on. Immortal Master Qi recently took a disciple on Xiaoshi Mountain. He treasures the boy immensely. After bringing him up the mountain, he suddenly started issuing new orders, rerouting several of the southern contingents and specifically pulling Gongsun Bei from his assignment to bring a treasure to the lake."

"A disciple? Isn't Xiaoshi Mountain within our Buddhist Land?" Nuzi frowned in confusion.

"Heh," Zhelu said softly. "The boy was originally from Jiangbei. After the turmoil, he became a novice monk under our jurisdiction. We never knew he possessed such talent that the Profound Governance Pavilion would accept him as a disciple!"

Though his words were neutral, his tone was laced with sourness. To be taken in by Qi Lanyan, who was willing to break rules for him, the boy must have been extraordinary. He could have achieved great things within the Buddhist Land. It was an irksome loss, but Zhelu dared not show his true feelings.

Nuzi’s frown deepened, still puzzled.

He prided himself on his understanding of the Profound Governance Pavilion. Those Daoists were insufferably arrogant and had always looked down on Buddhist cultivators. They placed great importance on karma and disliked cultivators who converted to Buddhism, showing even more disdain for those who wavered between the two paths. Why would they ever accept a novice monk?

‘Something is wrong here… but there's no need for me to dig deeper. Lord Peacock is in seclusion, and when he emerges, he'll be an undeniable powerhouse. Why should I wade into these muddy waters? I'll just protect myself and enjoy the benefits.’

His silence left Zhelu without an ally, and the other cultivators simply exchanged glances, unwilling to speak.

Finally, with a rustle, someone stood up. It was a man with a long, horse-like face and a stern expression: Maha Taixi, from Zhelu’s own Way of Emptiness, rising to support his leader.

"The Shanji Prefecture is a vital location. My strength is limited, so I cannot afford any delays. I will advance from the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter and attack the Wilderness!"

Minghui chuckled darkly and suddenly spoke up. "Taixi Dashi… why not go to Moongaze Lake? You seem to hold quite a grudge against it!"

‘…’

Taixi’s expression froze, rage flashing in his eyes, but he suppressed it.

"My abilities are lacking, far inferior to my esteemed colleagues," he said coolly.

"I am not worthy of such a great responsibility. Besides… General Gongsun will lead his forces to Moongaze Lake. My foundation is of the Veiled Yin. If I were strong, it would be one thing, but in my current weakened state, I would be at a great disadvantage against the Bright Yang. Does the Lotus Temple, with all its study of Daoist law, not even understand such a basic principle?"

He paused, then added with a sneer, "It seems the lack of milk at the banquet has soured Minghui Dashi's mood!"

"Heh!"

Minghui knew exactly who the jibe was aimed at. An insult to Jinlian was an insult to him. His anger flared, and he shot up from his seat. 

"What nonsense!" he laughed coldly. "Just because Gongsun Bei is going, the Buddhist cultivators are no longer needed? Since the Way of Emptiness is presiding, you must send someone to show your sincerity. If you won't show filial respect to the Liangli, do you expect his esteemed personage to go to the lake himself? And who would manage the other fronts then?"

His words were vicious and sharp. Maha Taixi erupted in fury.

"Give you an inch and you take a mile! Don't think I don't know what you're plotting! You just want us to test the White Qilin for you. If you're so determined to serve, why don't you go yourself!"

Minghui roared with laughter, his gaze resolute, his face radiating an aura of righteous dignity. He kicked his lotus throne aside, leaped into the center of the hall, struck a heroic pose, and thundered,

"And why would I not go?!"

The declaration was earth-shattering, like the grand entrance of a hero from an opera. It left Taixi stunned, his mind a complete blank.

‘Huh? What kind of game is this?!’

The other high-ranking cultivators all turned to stare, utterly bewildered.

But Minghui was far from finished. He beat his chest and proclaimed,

"On the previous southern campaigns, my Lotus Temple was unable to participate due to other matters… Now, to show our utmost sincerity and our willingness to die in service of the Dao of Mount Dayang, we wish to lead the vanguard! To spread the fundamental laws of our sacred Dao and save all living beings from the fires of suffering!"

He spoke with righteous tears welling in his eyes.

"I only ask for the Liangli's blessing!" he gritted out.

Most of those present knew what sort of character he was, making the performance utterly bizarre. No one knew what to say. Only Luejin, the Merciful One from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, bowed his head slightly, a look of genuine emotion on his face.

‘This Master Minghui is truly a good man… Master was right to trust him! Of all the areas along the coast, Moongaze Lake has the largest population. A single battle there could cost a hundred thousand lives, yet he braves the danger himself…’

‘The Lotus Temple… despite its reputation for hedonistic monks and barking-dog masters, it produces disciples who are truly devoted to good… There is merit to the Lotus Temple after all…’

Zhelu was just as dumbfounded. The eyes covering his face stared fixedly at Minghui, unable to discern his true intentions. Even more shocked was Mingxiang, Minghui's fellow Maha from the Lotus Temple. His broad face was a mask of horror.

‘My Lotus Temple? Me?’

‘What is my junior brother doing?! Did I agree to this?’

He had every right to be afraid. This was an official war between north and south. There was no need for pretense; Immortals and Buddhists alike could enter the fray. That man Qi planned to make his move while the Great Song was still finding its footing. With Gongsun Bei bringing a Spiritual Treasure, King Wei was sure to fight to the death. No one wanted to be on the receiving end of the White Qilin's wrath—after all, Nuxiao hadn't even managed to reincarnate successfully.

Yet, before they left, his own master had specifically instructed him to follow his junior brother's lead in all things. He could only force himself to remain calm as Zhelu, who had also maintained his composure, narrowed his eyes and spoke in a low voice.

"It is rare to see such devotion from Minghui Dashi. In that case, I will trouble you to select your men."

The moment the words were spoken, Taixi snapped out of his shock. A chill ran down his spine as he saw Minghui turn to him with a solemn expression.

"All matters must follow the Liangli's direction. Ultimately, we need a pillar of our Way of Emptiness. I must trouble Maha Taixi to accompany us south."

Zhelu said nothing, merely turning his gaze upon Taixi. The multitude of eyes on his face swiveled, and Taixi immediately understood. A venomous thought filled his mind.

‘How vicious…’

‘He's determined to drag me into this… Fine… Fine… The Li clan and I are mortal enemies. If Li Zhouwei counterattacks… the blame will surely fall on me! I don't even know how I offended this beast!’

But he had no way out. Gritting his teeth, he stepped down from his throne and bowed to his Liangli.

"I will obey your sacred command!"

Minghui ignored Taixi's murderous glare and scanned the assembly. He spotted a few likely candidates among the cultivators—one dressed in crimson astride a red tiger, another with extra eyes on his face, both from the Way of Emptiness. He pointed them all out, continuing until Zhelu's expression began to shift, at which point he abruptly stopped and smiled.

"Many thanks for the Liangli's approval!"

A smile creased Zhelu's face, the wrinkles bunching up around his many eyelids in a terrifying display.

"General Gongsun and his men have brought the Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform," he said coldly. "They intend to see that qilin fall. Taixi Dashi, you are leading a sizable force. If you fail to suppress the qilin and bring back some of its bloodline this time, be prepared for an inquiry from Mount Dayang!"
