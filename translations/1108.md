# Chapter 1108: The Silver Drum

Golden flames surged skyward as baleful light erupted. In the rolling sandstorm that flickered in and out of view, even the Great Void seemed to undulate. As the long saber slid back into its sheath, blood-like spatters of light pulsed, captivating the soul.

On the earth below, ranks of soldiers stood in grim silence. Their white-jade armor gleamed, and every man held a handleless silver blade, encircling the entire mountain gate. Three Holders of the Profound stood apart, guiding divine abilities and refining treasures. Tens of thousands of silver streams of light leaped from the soldiers, feeding the dense, roiling silver lightning in the sky as it relentlessly battered the great formation.

This was precisely the Stormshatter Wedges!

Although the Stormshatter Wedges were precious enough to be Spiritual Artifacts, their true marvel lay in their divisibility. They could be split into tens of thousands of small, handleless wedges, usable in groups of three or five. They could even be taken out by sect disciples for training. In a situation like this, they could be armed to tens of thousands of soldiers to break a formation in unison.

The Great Void was dark and soundless. A young man stood within it, wearing a tall crown and a black-and-silver Daoist robe embroidered with profound patterns. A purple-striped silk ribbon at his waist glowed faintly, partially obscuring his figure.

He watched as the baleful qi was beaten into a pained, steady retreat. If not for a divine ability sustaining it, its foundation would have already been damaged. The youth’s expression, however, remained utterly unmoved, as if this was all expected.

'Situ Huo... from the looks of it, that's the Heavenly Beard Polished Metal Sutra. It's the Dao Lineage of True Monarch Xuhua, the one who grasped the transformation of primordial metal into magnetism to enter the Whole Pill realm... It seems Situ Tang really was Golden Feather's handiwork. The Dao Lineage must be in Golden Feather’s hands.'

'In other words... that lord's obsession with the Whole Pill isn't just a few centuries old. He used Situ Tang to unlock the Dao Lineage back then, only to seize it in secret... But the Dragon-kin couldn't tolerate it and personally stepped in to cripple him.'

He watched coldly as Helian Wujiang fled for his life.

'The two great unorthodox Dao lineages of the Whole Pill... to think they would collide like this.'

Qi Lanyan had naturally come to retrieve the pair, but that wasn't his only reason. He truly couldn't restrain himself. He had to see it.

The Crimson Severing Arrowhead.

His gaze turned icy as he stared at the Desert Sky-Platform looming over the sect. The hand resting on his sleeve twitched twice.

'A vast desert, crimson light like blood, bright days and dark nights, a gloom as heavy as yin...'

What did this mean?

'This is a supreme emperor's scripture, on the level of those secretly passed down in the Wei Palace—where did he get it?'

This was no simple trinket. It was absolutely not like the Treasure Scripture of the Body Guarding the Tiger Pass, which could be obtained from the Li Clan's old retainers!

'The remnants of the dynasty must have given it to him...'

It was already suspicious whether Xuan'an even possessed the true Bright Yang transmission. The suppression of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead had been deliberate. For Li Zhouwei to be standing here now, wielding such a divine ability, was deeply unnerving.

Qi Lanyan pondered for a long time before finally, secretly, making up his mind.

"He has the Emperor's Scripture for the Crimson Severing Arrowhead now. Who knows if next time it will be the Great Illumination Imperial Monarch Scripture and the Profound Scripture of Origin Contemplation and Manifestation? This cannot be taken lightly. I must report this to my superiors."

Divine abilities achieved in the Purple Mansion Realm were typically derived from fourth or fifth-grade cultivation methods. What truly determined the vastness of a divine ability was one's Dao-Profundity and skill. But that didn't mean the method itself had no influence. If he had obtained one of those true Wei Palace transmissions, his power would be undeniable!

Fan Kang might be able to see the future, but he clearly couldn't know the specifics of Li Zhouwei's cultivation method. What troubled Qi Lanyan even more... was that Mount Luoxia very likely didn't care about Li Zhouwei's methods or divine abilities at all!

'The more powerful Li Zhouwei's divine ability, the more effective he'll be at overthrowing the Wei Emperor... Whether it's the Underworld or Luoxia, they are both incredibly accommodating of his future. To resolve this suspicion... or even to place some limits on him, I need to find a lord from the mountain who _doesn't_ want his divine abilities to become too vast...'

He fell silent for a moment, a candidate already in mind.

'Once this is over, I should make a trip back to Long territory.'

The silver light beneath his feet grew increasingly fractured. Having watched his fill, Qi Lanyan finally made his move. He retrieved a pair of objects from his sleeve.

One of the items was the size of a fist, silver-white as snow. It was an exquisite little silver drum, carved with abstruse runes. Long golden tassels hung from its sides, and tied to it were three small, round mallets of different colors.

Qi Lanyan selected the silver mallet, solemnly regulated his divine ability, and finally tapped it lightly against the silver drum.

"Dong!"

Though the drum was small, the strike unleashed a terrifying silver storm, faintly tinged with gold. It blasted out from the Great Void, instantly engulfing the entire sky at a frightening speed.

"BOOM!"

The Desert Sky-Platform of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead should have borne the brunt of the attack. But at that exact moment, Li Zhouwei retracted his divine ability, shifting and teleporting away. Instead, Situ Huo's roiling golden wind was left to face it head-on.

The golden wind divine ability was visibly annihilated by the lightning. Situ Huo was immediately blasted from the sky. The old fox was extremely cautious; his expression changed dramatically as he sheathed his saber, activating Monarch's Lost Sheep at full power, trying to flee.

But a golden light mixed within the flowing lightning pinned him in place, rendering him immobile!

It wasn't just Situ Huo. The entire sky seemed to be suppressed by that thin, golden light. Helian Wujiang, who was also struck down and coughing up blood; Murong Yan, whose face instantly paled; and even Li Zhouwei... all of them were frozen in place.

The man in the Great Void showed no surprise. He had already unwound the purple silk ribbon from his waist, wrapping it around one wrist. With a hook and pull of his other hand, Murong Yan and Helian Wujiang vanished from the mortal world.

"Kacha."

The thin golden light instantly shattered. The lightning across the heavens rapidly dispersed. Li Zhouwei withdrew his gaze and turned to look at Situ Huo. The old man's expression was ugly. He said nothing for a long moment before finally spitting out a crackle of lightning, a silver light flashing around his lips.

'Qi Lanyan's treasure.'

With the Immortal Mirror, Li Zhouwei had seen everything clearly. The timing of the Crimson Severing Arrowhead's retraction had seemed accidental, but it was he who had intentionally guided it during the fight...

'That silver lightning specifically targets light and baleful qi. It must be designed for large-scale spell-type divine abilities and some manifested, drifting Body Divine Abilities...'

Besides his own, Situ Huo's rolling golden wind, Helian Wujiang's baleful wind form, and Murong Yan's Valley Water divine ability had all been struck by the lightning. They clearly hadn't fared well.

'As for that golden lightning... a charge from Sovereign's Perilous Tread could break it, but he wouldn't be stupid enough to use that casually. If caught off guard, it could turn the tide of battle. The only fortunate thing is... it doesn't seem to have much direct offensive power. Or perhaps he just hasn't used it yet.'

Qi Lanyan might despise Southern cultivators, but Li Zhouwei was keenly aware of the threat he posed. Finally seeing a glimpse of his profound abilities was an unexpected gain. He shifted his gaze and called out a reminder.

"General Situ, even Monarch's Lost Sheep couldn't escape it?"

Situ Huo's expression was still grim. He shook his head gravely.

"He is an 'upper cultivator' from the North, a product of Profound Governance, and he wields a supreme treasure. How could I possibly resist?"

He said the words, but having his life-saving trump card shattered by a single, casual move had clearly left Situ Huo shaken. The two had no intention of giving chase and stopped where they were.

Below them, the dense silver lightning continued to swarm the formation. Li Zhouwei glanced down. The nearby Li Jiangliang immediately turned and barked an order. A heaven-shaking cry rose from the troops below.

"The Northern cultivator has fled in defeat! Open the formation!"

The sound thundered across the land, shaking the entire region. But the mountain remained utterly silent. Not a single movement. Situ Huo descended on the wind, sneered, and said:

"The White Ye Immortal Sect was tormented by that band of Buddhist cultivators, and then several Purple Mansion Realm experts forced their way in... I'd say..."

Li Zhouwei's eyes narrowed slightly. He spoke with keen interest.

"I'd say not necessarily."

Situ Huo retracted his gaze and chuckled.

"Oh?"

"BOOM!"

Sure enough, the lightning surged with growing intensity. A tremor ran through the mountain, and the great formation's light barrier finally dissolved like water. Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow and drew his long halberd. As the Heavenly Light flared, roiling black flames instantly engulfed the sky. From the base of the mountain, a limitless cry for slaughter erupted.

"Kill!"

...

The stone hall at the summit was stained with blood, littered with corpses.

Gongsun Bofan leaned quietly against the stone steps, the true essence and dharma power in his body long since exhausted. His limbs were shattered, his eyes a dull, ashen white. He stared blankly at the ceiling of the greenstone hall, where rolling black flames now climbed the stone, as if igniting something invisible.

The first to fight their way to the Capital immortals Dao summit had, naturally, been the Guest Retainers.

The jade talisman to control the formation had been given to him by Yehui personally. Gongsun Bofan had served under the Daoist Master for a long time. Knowing the situation was lost, he had still fought against many. Though his cultivation was high, two fists couldn't fend off four hands, and he had fallen.

But the group of rebel cultivators needed a scapegoat, so Gongsun Bofan had been left alive. Several unknown Guest Retainers knelt meekly on the path, holding a blood-stained jade tablet. Their faint, unified cries drifted up.

"This humble cultivator pays his respects to the Daoist Master! We congratulate the heavenly soldiers on entering the mountain!"

Gongsun Bofan heard no reply. There was only the faint sound of boots on stone and the vague sensation of a hot wind. Beside the high jade platform, a figure had appeared.

The young man stood with his hands clasped behind him, meticulously observing the formation disk on the jade platform.

Clearly, whether Capital immortals Dao lived or died, who had killed whom, or who had remained loyal to Bai Ziyu, was not worthy of this Daoist Master's slightest attention. The entire Capital immortals Dao, all tied together, was worth less than a single rune on that disk.

'A pity...'

The last wisp of energy Gongsun Bofan was holding onto began to dissipate. His consciousness drifted, but then he vaguely sensed a surge of heat rush into his Shengyang Acupoint. It was like a diver surfacing and taking a sudden, desperate breath. Everything before him snapped into sharp focus.

A pair of golden eyes was reflected in his own.

"Where is the secret vault?"

Only then did Gongsun Bofan realize he was kneeling upright. His limbs felt perfectly normal. Only his shattered armor testified to the brutal battle. The man stared, stunned, as if waking from another life, before bowing his head.

"The Daoist Master did not establish a secret vault. The Dao Lineage is passed down personally; it has its own treasury."

Li Zhouwei wasn't surprised.

Yehui had come to the North-South war as an opportunist; how could he possibly treat the White Ye Immortal Sect as his own sanctuary? Preserving this formation was already his greatest gain.

'A pity... the Song Court will definitely requisition this place. This great formation probably won't fall into my hands...'

But he wouldn't take the man at his word. He stretched out a hand, and nimble black flames danced around his fingertips, as if whispering.

'Attacking the mountain, breaking the gate... nourishing the Dharma Body. But it feels like there was some interference...'

Drawing on his experience at Changxiao Gate, Li Zhouwei knew this couldn't be interference from a mere Purple Mansion Realm formation. His spiritual sense sank, connecting with the Immortal Mirror. In an instant, a complete image of the entire mountain range flooded his mind!

Spirit Probe!

An endless landscape of scenes surged into his mind as every hidden cache was revealed. As expected, the place was picked clean. Of all the spiritual resources stored away, not a single one was noteworthy.

But he searched everywhere, still unwilling to give up. While he appeared to be studying the patterns on the formation disk, he was secretly probing one immortal's cave after another. Finally, he saw the deepest, most extravagant cave—bright with white-gold, a river of purple water flowing through. It was Yehui's personal cultivation abode.

Though lavishly decorated, this place, too, had been emptied of valuables. Only a bottomless purple spring bubbled in the center, gushing with color. Under the Immortal Mirror's unhindered inspection, every detail was visible.

Deep beneath it, drawn by a talisman, was a green jade object!

'Cleverly hidden.'

Yehui hadn't hidden it that deep, just slightly beyond the range of a normal Purple Mansion Realm probe. He didn't know if it was a natural feature or a skill of the Capital Guard lineage, but the cavern containing the object was a fault in the Great Void. It was impossible to get a foothold, which cut off most methods of detection and scrying.

It was being constrained by a talismanic divine ability, but the object was still faintly sensing.

'You audacious bastard, Yehui... you were using the destruction of your own sect to refine a treasure! No wonder!'

The corner of Li Zhouwei's mouth hooked up. He glanced at the kneeling Gongsun Bofan, which made the other Guest Retainers on the side tremble. They scrambled over, fawning.

"My lord! There are one or two minor sect treasuries, hidden around the mountain... The disciples in the sect often take from them..."

Gongsun Bofan was appalled by their stupidity and coldly snapped,

"The petty stores of junior cultivators? What use are they?"

The Guest Retainer instantly fell silent. Li Zhouwei looked up just as Situ Huo stepped into the hall, smiling.

"Congratulations, King Wei..."

Li Zhouwei was somewhat disappointed. Capital immortals Dao was destitute, and now he had to garrison the mountain. The spirit mountain and veins left behind were immovable. It was tasteless to eat, yet a pity to discard. He listened as Situ Huo continued,

"This Capital immortals manpower... King Wei has no use for them, I presume?"

Li Zhouwei understood immediately. Situ Huo's personal strength was exceptional, but he was severely lacking in subordinates. The few Situ clan remnants had low cultivations and were useless for now. The very thing Li Zhouwei cared for least was what Situ Huo urgently needed.

Li Zhouwei said,

"I'll take this one. You can have the rest."

The old man smiled and shook his head, looking slightly disappointed.

"King Wei certainly knows how to pick!"

Li Zhouwei had dealt with Gongsun Bofan before and had a good impression of him. The man was a peak Foundation Establishment Realm saber cultivator. While not some world-beating genius, he was more than adequate. Nurturing a saber cultivator of this level on the lake would cost a significant amount of resources.

Manpower on the lake was already scarce. This was a rogue cultivator who understood reason, possessed a sense of honor, and had a known background. Li Zhouwei gave him a measure of approval. That was why he had specifically saved his life.

Gongsun Bofan had assumed that for opposing the Li family, he would be fated to die a horrible death. He never imagined he would hear such words. He froze for a second, then kowtowed, his voice thick with emotion.

"This one greets Your Majesty!"

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod of acknowledgment but said no more.

"Take me to Yehui's immortal's cave."
