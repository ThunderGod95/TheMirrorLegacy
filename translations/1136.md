# Chapter 1136: Lingering Attachments

On the mountaintop, iridescent light swirled as the Heavenly Light scattered down, drifting among white flowers. Li Jiangliang kept his head bowed, kneeling silently on the ground.

Honestly, Li Jiangliang had been reluctant to say any of this. Although Yang Tianyou was fraught with worry, Li Jiangliang didn't believe his father would truly interfere in the Lesser Yang's affairs. But after he and his wife discussed it at length, he had finally relented.

He had weighed the situation for a long time before secretly steeling his resolve.

'Regardless of the Yang family's attitude, or whether this matter is considered large or small, or what the various factions are debating... all I can do is ensure Ting Province is fully aware of what's happening with the Lesser Yang.'

So, he had used these orders as an opportunity to come and report everything he knew. Hearing his father's question, he looked up.

"I personally believe... the great figures are not worried. But Tianyou and the Great General can't help but overthink things."

Hearing this, Li Zhouwei understood that his son had a deep understanding of the Underworld but knew little about Ting Province. His perspective was skewed.

'Since I am backed by the Immortal Mansion, it's true those high-level figures have no need to worry. But Yang Ruiyi himself has absolutely no real power, let alone Yang Tianyou. She only came here as someone's puppet, to deliver a single message.'

'That line about the "lord handling things appropriately" was really just acknowledging that the Immortal Mansion knew its place. The Yang family reaped some benefit, or perhaps just found their own operations running more smoothly, so they sent someone to offer a token word of praise.'

He sneered inwardly but merely nodded, raising his cup.

"Return and tell them I'm engaged in fierce battles in Jiangbei, relying heavily on their divine might."

Li Jiangliang was taken aback. A flicker of worry crossed his brow, but he didn't press the matter.

"I will remember."

Once the tea was finished, their official business was concluded. Li Jiangliang returned to his seat. Li Zhouwei watched him, his expression softening slightly.

"You have no sons. Have you made any arrangements for the future?"

Li Jiangliang fell silent, his gaze dropping, obscuring the look in his eyes. After a moment, he looked up.

"Father, I appreciate your concern. But Tianyou and I share a deep bond, and I have no intention of taking a concubine. As for adopting an heir..."

He paused, his expression turning serious.

"My brothers do not have many children themselves. As for the other branches, they do not possess the 'golden eyes,' so there is no need to transfer them out of the main line. The Zhou royal house had many successions, and the Chu ancestral line was moved several times. We need not be so fastidious about purity."

These were not pleasant words, but he spoke them naturally, his gaze lowered. Li Zhouwei stared at him before setting down his cup.

"All of you born with the golden eyes are intelligent, and full of your own calculations. I have never interfered in your affairs. You are not like your three older brothers. If you achieve greatness, I doubt the Yang clan would be stingy with a position for you."

Li Jiangliang's expression grew complicated at this. He bowed his head.

"Father, you worry too much... My brothers..."

But Li Zhouwei rose to his feet.

"Since you've come to the lake, I doubt this was your only purpose."

Li Jiangliang nodded quickly, also rising.

"The Emperor has bestowed spiritual goods, a train of carts stretching for miles. They are a reward for Ting Province. Also..."

He lowered his head again.

"The Cheng clan of the Sword Gate has submitted a report. They say that after many years, the Myriad Radiance Sword Tome has revealed a name again. It displayed 'Jiangchun.' News of this will soon spread everywhere. The Emperor has ordered me to summon Jiangchun to the capital."

Li Zhouwei's tone was unreadable.

"This King knew this couldn't be avoided, but I didn't expect them to use this method. Clever, indeed."

Li Jiangliang didn't dare breathe, merely pouring more tea for his father.

"Uncle Zhouluo... also misses him terribly."

But his father seemed uninterested and waved his hand dismissively.

"Go see the Old Master."

Li Jiangliang gave a deep bow and retreated, facing his father as he went. When he reached the courtyard and was about to head down the mountain, the man above him raised his golden eyes. The color within them had grown heavy and somber.

"You and Zhouluo watch over him for me. If anything happens in the Imperial Capital, I will be going to Yang Zhuo to demand his return."

"Yes..."

The young man departed with hurried steps, never leaving his father's sight. The mountain fell quiet, but only for an instant. Footsteps broke the silence, and a bright figure leaped into view, landing gracefully. A youth with a sword on his back emerged, his bearing carefree and his face wreathed in a smile. He bowed.

"Greetings, Your Highness!"

"Jiangchun. You've come out of seclusion."

Li Zhouwei sighed inwardly but nodded with a smile. Li Jiangchun had already risen to his feet.

"It is only because you are here guarding Ting Province, Uncle, that this junior could cultivate in peace."

Li Zhouwei shook his head.

"Your eldest brother has been in seclusion for a long time. I cannot leave this place for an extended period. The Western Shu have a history of scheming. If they try their old tricks again... although Jiangqian's foundation is stable, such a disturbance would be detrimental. Besides... there may be another period of turmoil in the province soon."

Li Jiangchun nodded silently.

"At this juncture, they probably aren't paying it much mind."

Clearly, Li Jiangchun was referring to the efficacy of the Talisman Seed in coalescing a divine ability. To other families, Li Jiangqian had only been in seclusion for eight or nine years; he couldn't possibly be at the critical juncture yet. But Li Jiangchun himself estimated it would only be another year or two.

Li Zhouwei's thoughts, however, were on a different track. As he pondered, Li Jiangchun spoke again, his tone solemn.

"Junior has another important matter to report!"

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. He watched as the young man revealed his palm, where a cyan radiance flared to life, shifting and floating. A sharp aura washed over them.

"What powerful Sword Intent!"

He could clearly sense a severing quality within it. Though faint and small, its quality was exceptionally high, and it seemed aimed directly at one's life-mandate.

But Li Jiangchun hesitated slightly before revealing his other hand. In that palm, another iridescent light appeared, spiraling nimbly as a sparrow.

Crescent Moon Sword Origin!

'Hm?'

Before he could say more, King Wei was on his feet, his gaze burning. He stared at the Sword Intent in one hand and the Sword Origin in the other. After a moment's thought, he asked in a low voice,

"How did you accomplish this?"

Li Jiangchun didn't dare be careless. He explained everything, then respectfully offered the cyan-white sword with both hands, presenting it to Li Zhouwei.

Li Zhouwei stared down at the Qingchi, silent for a long time.

Li Ximing had spoken of this spiritual sword's origins before and had been quite worried. He had even relayed Li Xijun's original words, believing the sword contained an inheritance. This Daoist Master's own thoughts on the matter were:

'To achieve an immortal foundation is to manifest intent; to establish a Dao Lineage for the Way of the Sword... how could that be done by a mere mortal? I fear an ancestor was a celestial being who stooped to reincarnate in the lower realm. When Xijun spoke of Immortal Swords—could this be what he meant?'

This caused Li Zhouwei to sigh deeply. He didn't press further into the origin of the Sword Intent, but said in a low voice,

"Is it really possible... two Sword Intents?"

Seeing Li Jiangchun's hesitant nod, an image of a particular figure flashed into the golden-eyed man's mind.

'True Monarch Shangyuan!'

When that True Monarch was still only at the Purple Mansion Realm, his fame for wielding two Sword Intents resounded throughout Jiangnan! Any discussion of dual Sword Intents inevitably led back to him.

Once a person manifests Sword Intent, it is unique to them; it cannot be duplicated. Even Wang Xun, who visited the Li family long ago—a descendant of a great, living True Monarch—had claimed, 'Even my True Monarch has never seen such a thing!'

'Regardless, Jiangchun's anomaly must be related to the heavens. If that's the case, then True Monarch Shangyuan's Sword Intent... where did _it_ come from?'

'If others were to see this... the trouble would be unimaginable...'

Li Zhouwei said in a low voice, "Since Azure Homeland has been revealed, you will use that Sword Intent and its Sword Origin from now on. As for the original one... do not use it. Continue to refine it in secret."

The young man bowed, his expression worried.

"I just fear the Myriad Radiance Sword Tome!"

The Myriad Radiance Sword Tome of the Myriad Radiance Sword Gate could respond to Sword Intents from thousands of miles away. How could Li Jiangchun not be worried about it? Li Zhouwei's brow furrowed in thought.

"Logically, with the Talisman Seed in your body, you shouldn't be detectable by such things. Yet, the Tome succeeds time and again. I estimate its senses must rely on the Sword Intent that manifests in the Great Void... and even that must have its limits."

"I will look into this. When the time is right, I will pay a visit to the Sword Gate... and probe this matter of Sword Intent. You just focus on advancing your cultivation."

Li Jiangchun nodded, his expression serious. Li Zhouwei added regretfully,

"It's just that we can no longer brush off the Song Emperor."

Li Jiangchun understood his meaning instantly. Far from worried, he looked delighted.

"I have been looking forward to this for a long time! Our ancestors pacified the Eastern Yue, eliminated the Maha, unified the lake, and slaughtered the hordes of Buddhists. When you were at the Foundation Establishment Realm, Uncle, you took up your halberd and carved out a reputation known on both shores, with none in the Three Sects and Seven Gates daring to stand as your equal. I, too, must test myself against the talents of this world!"

Li Zhouwei laughed.

"That wasn't exactly a good time for choosing rivals. Lord Xiangping had the King-Marquis of the Eastern Yue. Lord Tongya had the Yu father and son. My uncle's great-grandfather had the Eighteen Buddhists. My own talent was shallow; I could only find the likes of Situ Mo and Guan Gongxiao to fight. Still... their methods were not unworthy of the heroes of that era."

His expression was one of pity as he continued,

"But in the Jiangnan of today, there is no one worthy of the name. The Dao Children of the immortal sects and the direct heirs of the Underworld remain in seclusion... I fear even the imperial princes are not fit to be your opponents!"

...

Lotus Temple.

The land was sunk in the dimness of night, mountains rising and falling in shadow. Faint dots of golden light were visible. A colossal Buddhist statue stood amidst the range, looking particularly terrifying against the gray-black sky.

Golden light flickered within the temple. In a pool, a milky-white liquid roiled, looking starkly bright in the faint candlelight. A monk soaked within it, his clean-shaven head resting in the lap of a woman behind him. His expression was heavy, and he remained silent for a long time.

After an unknown time, a young novice approached the platform, his face etched with misery. He knelt before the pool.

"Master... the date has been changed!"

These words made the already agitated monk in the pool sit bolt upright.

"You... you... what have you done! I see it now. Logically, you're heavily injured and haven't recovered, so how could you trust him? And you certainly couldn't run off overseas to meet him... Now you've made him suspicious, haven't you!"

At this, Minghui began to slap his own face in remorse.

"This... this was my oversight, Master, but I didn't order this... It's difficult for us to send messages overseas, so I entrusted someone from Yinzhou Island. The plan was, as soon as there was news, he would crush a jade talisman, and I would arrive a month later. I... I forgot to give specific instructions, and I never imagined he would set the meeting directly..."

Hearing this, Jinlian's expression softened slightly. He sighed.

"I expect... he's almost certainly asking you about the 'Great Emptiness Dao-Seeking Disk.' That thing is worthless to us, but to the Way of Emptiness, it's priceless. This complicates things."

He lowered his gaze.

"I see... Just have your disciple-brother go in your place!"

Minghui was instantly alarmed.

"Is that... appropriate?"

Jinlian gritted his teeth.

"What's not appropriate about it! Do you dare to speak forcefully to Li Ximing? Even I hardly dare! The last time you met King Wei, he sensed something was wrong. You dare go again? Are you treating him like a fool?"

"It just so happens... your disciple-brother Mingmeng was a Daoist in his past life. He and Mingxiang are blood brothers. After that last incident, your disciple-brother Mingxiang is already suspicious. When Mingmeng returns and speaks with him, it will naturally help smooth over Mingxiang's feelings about our recent actions!"

Minghui's eyes lit up. He nodded vigorously, showering his master with flattery.

"Brilliant! Master, you are truly brilliant!"

"Pah!"

Although Jinlian was smiling, he spat.

"Useless!"

Minghui just chuckled in agreement.

He had been taken in by the Lotus Temple as a child. Jinlian was quick to curse and beat him, but was also fiercely protective when it mattered. Knowing his master's temperament, Minghui just pressed on anxiously.

"But this 'Great Emptiness Dao-Seeking Disk'... are we to acquire it... or not?"

Jinlian's expression immediately darkened.

"The Way of Great Desire intends to move south. When they come, the Way of Emptiness is sure to follow. Your disciple-brother is already in Jiangnan; how can we stay out of it? This disk... it's both useless and vital. It's merely a focus for their seeking the Dao. The only question is whether we should allow it to fall back into the hands of the Way of Emptiness."

He said in a dark tone,

"If not for this business with the Way of Great Desire, I would have preferred Zhelu to get it. It would have fed his ambition. But he can't make waves anymore. If it falls into his hands, it's as good as giving it to the enemy."

"If it falls into the hands of the Way of Great Desire, that's even worse. To get it, Zhelu would surely grovel and submit. He'd probably stop all his covert actions... wouldn't that just cause trouble for the 'Lord'?"

He narrowed his eyes, a plan forming quickly.

"Mingmeng!"

This place was already connected to the Buddhist Land. In an instant, light flashed, and a young monk stepped out of the void, dropping to his knees.

"Greetings, Master."

Jinlian nodded slightly, his voice chilling.

"The 'Great Emptiness Dao-Seeking Disk' from the Liang era is in King Wei's hands. Some Northern Buddhists, we don't know which, secretly tempted one of his rogue cultivators with a great reward to trade for it. This matter is of vital interest to the Way of Emptiness. You will go see Zhaojing in your junior brother's place."

Mingmeng raised his eyebrows, his expression serious.

"Does Master wish for me to retrieve it?"

"No."

Jinlian shook his head.

"Acquiring it would not only be enormously expensive, it would drag us into the conflict between the Way of Great Desire and the Way of Emptiness. They would certainly plot against you, pull you into their move south, all to force me to hand over the disk..."

"But once we hand it over, the Way of Emptiness's power will soar, and we will have offended King Wei. Caught between north and south, you would face certain death! It would be a massive effort just to roast ourselves over a fire."

Jinlian explained this, mixing truth with falsehood. Mingmeng's eyes lit up, and he nodded repeatedly, sighing with emotion.

"To be able to cultivate under Master is truly the fortune of this lifetime!"

Jinlian couldn't be bothered with his flattery.

"You are to explain the situation to him frankly. Lay out all the implications and warn him: no matter who comes asking, he must not hand it over. Consider it us doing him a favor. Perhaps King Wei will spare your lives for it."

Mingmeng agreed profusely and departed. Jinlian settled back into the milky pool, pondering his arrangements. Minghui watched with a look of utter admiration.

"Master, you truly are Master! That skill for spinning nonsense... I have so much to learn! To be able to cultivate under Master is truly the fortune of this lifetime!"

Jinlian shot him a look and sighed.

"These days, at the mere mention of King Wei, Mahas like Mingmeng are all desperate to avoid him... It's clear Vast Cicada's death scared them witless!"

At the mention of this, Minghui too fell silent.

"Vast Cicada was someone that Lord clearly wanted to protect... yet he died just like that. It was a slap in His face, plain for all the world to see. Everyone says Qi Lanyan lost his nerve and meekly handed over half of Jiangbei... but they forget how Zhelu and the others hesitated. Every single one of them was terrified!"

Back then, Jinlian had cursed his terrible luck. Now, his tune changed completely, his face filled with relief.

"Thinking on it now, we were the ones who received a great blessing... If not for the Lord's favor, the one dead today would be your disciple-brother! And the ones hiding in this temple, terrified... would be us!"
