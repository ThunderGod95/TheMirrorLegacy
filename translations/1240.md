# Chapter 1240: The Old Vassal

This was the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

A faint glow cascaded down upon the man in the platinum Daoist robe, who sat solemnly on the platform. The spot between his fair eyebrows shone with a restrained, sacred golden light.

Having cultivated to this day, Li Ximing was a veteran of a hundred battles; as the first of the Li clan to attain the Dao in the Purple Mansion Realm, he had suffered countless injuries and was exceptionally experienced, so upon consuming a Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill, the deficit in his sea of qi was instantly replenished by a vast amount of divine ability and dharma power.

To his pleasant surprise, his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body seemed to have advanced another step.

This item, when paired with the Secret Method of Sealing the Life-Mandate, often required him to sever his own limbs to forge a connection, yet each time he broke a finger, it was nourished by his flesh and blood. Coupled with the fact that he had frequently nurtured it with his essence blood over the years, it had finally progressed further.

As a result, the water from the Spring of Rebirth that he had retrieved from the World's Navel and refined into the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body had not only greatly accelerated the alternate body's recovery speed but had also, in turn, aided his true self, allowing his injuries to heal with extreme rapidity.

At this moment, he slowly opened his eyes; aside from a slightly weakened aura, he had made a full recovery. Li Ximing shook out his sleeves and took out the alternate body for a look. The small sculpture still had its delicate skin and slightly flushed cheeks, as if it might open its eyes at any moment.

'Although it has advanced, this path is lofty and distant, arduous and winding, and the 'Bright Yang' I cultivate offers no enhancements. Ten steps forward will not grant me any great marvels…'

With mixed feelings of joy and worry, he put away his treasure, stood up, and descended from the pavilion, where he found the young man sitting with his eyes closed in meditation.

Li Zhouwei had long since condensed his six wheels. The moment Li Jiangqian's Imperial Sun-March Sha was sent into this heaven, he had immediately absorbed the qi and consumed a pill, attempting to condense his immortal foundation.

For an ordinary cultivator, condensing an immortal foundation would take two or three years; given the astonishing difficulty of this technique, it would not be surprising for it to drag on for four or five years, yet in the hands of someone with his Dao-Profundity, the immortal foundation was forged in a little over half a year!

Within his sea of qi, mountain mists swirled, vaguely concealing a field of radiance where golden light surged like dragons and flood dragons, alongside the boundless mirage of an imperial garden and a dynastic phantom—this was precisely the immortal foundation, Imperial Observation of the Origin!

Upon this immortal foundation flowed a single white waterfall, like water yet like smoke, cascading down to constantly nourish the radiant immortal foundation below.

'This will be a central divine ability, one that can command and regulate the world!'

Of the various Bright Yang divine abilities, Li Zhouwei had already mastered three. Crimson Severing Arrowhead and Sovereign's Perilous Tread were both methods for charging into battle and slaying enemies, while Audience with the Celestial Gate, though possessing a magnificent might, was more suppressive than agile… now that his immortal foundation was complete, he had a profound realization:

'This Imperial Observation of the Origin, much like Crimson Severing Arrowhead, represents a metamorphosis for my Bright Yang divine abilities. If Crimson Severing Arrowhead and Sovereign's Perilous Tread can be coordinated to give me, with three divine abilities, the capital to move with ease on the battlefield, then Audience with the Celestial Gate feels somewhat clumsy and out of place.'

'Imperial Observation of the Origin will be the great marvel capable of linking the first three divine abilities together, and it is also the watershed moment for Bright Yang to transition into a style dominated by my will and overwhelming momentum! It is for this very reason that Emperor Wei sought to demote Imperial Observation of the Origin to the Eternal Brightness Steps…'

Li Zhouwei's current Dao-Profundity had already surpassed that of many Great Daoist Masters. The mere settling of his immortal foundation into his sea of qi brought him great insights. A strange light flickered in his eyes as he stood up and said:

"Granduncle, you've come out of seclusion!"

Li Ximing nodded, but then noticed a hint of hesitation in the young man before him and asked, puzzled:

"What is it?"

Li Zhouwei shook his head helplessly and said:

"I only just received the news myself. Ji'an is here."

As soon as he said this, Li Ximing understood immediately and laughed:

"What's the big deal? I was actually afraid he wouldn't come!"

Li Zhouwei had wanted to give Li Ximing time to cultivate. For his granduncle, mastering three divine abilities was certainly difficult, but it was no reason to remain stagnant with only two. King Wei said with a serious expression:

"Granduncle, how much more time do you estimate you'll need to perfect 'World's Radiance'?"

Slightly embarrassed, Li Ximing stood with his hands behind his back and said:

"It's not that I lack the will to cultivate, but every time I try, I feel my efforts are great but my progress is small. It's a difficult and frustrating process. When I think about it carefully, a Life Divine Ability is demanding, after all, and requires a high level of Dao-Profundity to cultivate. I was just lucky back then…"

He paused for a moment:

"As it stands now, it will take at least… three to five years."

Needless to say, Ji'an could certainly not wait three to five years. Li Zhouwei frowned for a moment, but Li Ximing sighed and said earnestly:

"You don't need to worry about me. For one, my innate talent is a barrier. For another… even though I enjoyed all the family's resources in my youth, I cannot compare to the direct line of the current Li clan… I'm still somewhat lacking in foundation. You need to pay attention to Que'wan."

He lowered his voice:

"She has been delayed for as long as she has been out of seclusion, and now she must heal your injuries and I hear she even has to establish a mystic realm… Even if I'm completely unfamiliar with such things, won't it cost Que'wan twenty or thirty years? If she suffers several more serious injuries during the conflict between the north and south, how much time for cultivation will she have left? The Purple Mystery is difficult to cross. I fear that by the time you verify the Dao, she'll still be stuck in the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm!"

Li Zhouwei nodded silently, lost in thought for a long while. Li Ximing smiled and said:

"If I had the ability to easily pass the Purple Mystery, I wouldn't be so polite with you all; I'd have gone into seclusion long ago! Since I can't, and I can still move, let me be the one to run these errands."

With a simple cupped-fist salute, he rode a beam of light out of the grotto-heaven, leaving Li Zhouwei in silence.

He had to admit, his elder's concerns were very meaningful. It was highly possible that when he verified the Dao, Li Que'wan and Li Jiangqian would not have passed the Purple Mystery:

'If all my divine abilities are complete and I'm forced by others to verify the Dao, but Que'wan has not yet crossed the Purple Mystery… this is no longer a matter of whether the Golden Oneness is willing to protect her. There might be no benefit for them in protecting her at all!'

Li Zhouwei certainly did not believe these great Daoist traditions truly cared about sentiment. Li Que'wan had to be on the verge of verifying the Dao, with a high probability of success, to gain their favor—she too was racing against time!

As he was deep in thought, a woman emerged from the pavilion, riding a Dharma wind down to the courtyard. With a smile as bright as a flower, she said:

"King Wei has already formed his immortal foundation! So fast!"

Seeing her, Li Zhouwei's smile softened considerably. He briefly asked about her progress with spell arts and divine abilities. Li Que'wan reported the wonders of her Awaiting the Supreme Divine, which made Li Zhouwei raise an eyebrow in a rare show of surprise:

"That is indeed an advantage. It seems that Awaiting the Supreme Divine is the most suitable first divine ability for those who cultivate the Whole Pill."

Li Que'wan nodded and said seriously:

"Your Majesty's calamity need not be delayed any longer."

Li Zhouwei replied with a serious tone:

"My immortal foundation was formed early, and I've spent the remaining time studying this calamity. When I was healing, the difficulty lay in suppressing and dispelling it simultaneously, but within this heaven, I only need to dispel it. Based on my Dao-Profundity, if I can succeed, it will only take three to five years."

The woman also opened her slender hand, and the talisman-like Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure leaped into her palm.

This item had always been quiet, and even when forcibly driven by Awaiting the Supreme Divine, it had merely deigned to be used. But when its true form appeared in this place, it instantly burst into a magnificent radiance, flashing with a dazzling white light. A faint fragrance of osmanthus wafted through the air, and the item itself trembled continuously, as if it were weeping.

Li Que'wan was slightly stunned, feeling a powerful marvel rising from her palm. Before she could ponder the reason for all this, she realized it was a perfect opportunity. She immediately pressed both hands on the item and focused her spirit to activate it:

[Dispel Calamity]!

She had not expected that the Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure, as if answering some summons or having arrived at a supreme sacred land of the Yin, would operate at its absolute peak. Her Awaiting the Supreme Divine failed to control it at all, yet the command sent by her spiritual sense was fully accepted by the Spiritual Treasure.

In an instant, a frigid, snow-like color poured down. Li Zhouwei had already sat down cross-legged. The jade bottle in his palm shattered, and the moon-like pill leaped up and fell into his mouth.

An expanse of cold color converged, like a shard of ultimate ice falling into hot coals. Li Zhouwei's Bright Yang divine abilities seemed to freeze solid, fading away like dark clouds behind a bright moon to reveal a glimmer of light beneath.

It was a small branch shimmering with multicolored light.

This dreamlike object was planted upon his life-mandate, constantly trying to draw the Wu Earth calamity from the world into itself, but it appeared isolated and helpless, cut off by this supreme realm.

That point of cold light fell like a falling star, smashing down abruptly. The color of the Spiritual Treasure, like moonlight from beyond the heavens, enveloped the small branch, grinding away at the five-colored light bit by bit.

…

Pingya Island.

Li Ximing rode a beam of light out and flew all the way to Gardenia Scenery Mountain. As he landed in the place where he had attained the Dao, he saw flames flickering in the mountains, bearing the aspect of a divine ability. He paused for a moment:

'Mansion Water?'

When he reached the forest full of gardenia flowers, he saw a man in black clothes with sinister eyes, his body surging with the radiance of Mansion Water. Li Ximing laughed heartily and said:

"Li Wushao!"

Li Wushao hurriedly returned the salute and said with a sly grin:

"Greetings, Seventh Young Master!"

Li Ximing acknowledged him with a nod, then laughed loudly:

"Well, this is perfect. You've cursed at Master Monks and Foundation Establishment cultivators and still weren't satisfied; now you can have a go at the Purple Mansion Realm as well!"

Li Wushao had not expected this Daoist Master's impression of him to be entirely based on his foul mouth. He laughed awkwardly, unsure how to respond, and after a short pause, muttered:

"There were also the Maha and the Merciful One. They were the ones who really deserved a scolding."

Li Ximing's feelings for Li Wushao were mostly rooted in the various experiences they had shared. As old acquaintances dwindled, these old friends became ever more precious. He had already prepared himself for this demon beast's failure and demise, so he was in high spirits to see that he had succeeded in one go. He just shook his head with a smile. Li Wushao quickly added:

"This old demon is useless, only good for winning with his mouth. Not like King Wei, who can kill them with a single slap, and their entire sect wouldn't even dare to cry for their mothers."

Li Ximing smiled and said:

"You're a figure of some standing now, a divine ability user in your own right. There's no need to speak so crudely."

The old demon's smile was quite chilling:

"I'm just talking with you, Daoist Master. Waving the banner and putting on airs, this old demon learned plenty of that at the Azure Pond… Back during the Great North-South War, I escaped back by putting on an act…"

He immediately fumbled in his sleeve, took out several jade boxes, and handed them to Li Ximing, saying seriously:

"His Highness has gone out to find that Yehui. The young miss left various treasures in my care and has also gone to the inner formation to cultivate… During this time, an old Daoist Master of Radiant Fire came by. The young miss entrusted a spiritual fire to me."

Li Ximing knew, of course, that Li Que'wan had gone to the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance; they had even met at the time. He simply pretended to have just come out of seclusion and nodded. Li Wushao then flipped his hand and, with great solemnity, brought out a wooden box. He opened it gently, and waves of azure light surged out, warm and refreshing like the morning sun.

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. He took it with one hand and saw a mass of azure-gold flame, no bigger than a palm, curled up inside the wooden box. The azure and gold colors intertwined, exuding an air of nobility. As the flame danced, it wove streaks of azure light, and he found he could not look away.

"Dangwood Molten Fire!"

Li Wushao was just about to introduce it when he was interrupted by Li Ximing's outburst. He quickly said:

"Indeed!"

"From the Golden Oneness?"

Li Ximing couldn't help but stand up and murmur:

"The spiritual fire known as Mystic Dangwood Partial Molten Fire… Only the Golden Oneness would have something of this caliber!"

Li Wushao nodded repeatedly and said in a low voice:

"Your subordinate doesn't know that much, but that old Daoist Master only left one message, saying that the Daoist Master would absolutely not be disappointed! He has some spiritual resources that must be harvested and used immediately, so he is already waiting in the north. He left a jade talisman with me and said that once the Young Master is ready, he will harvest them and rush over at top speed!"

"How could I be disappointed!"

Li Ximing exclaimed in admiration:

"The ancients said: Molten Fire is the mother of the Mystic Pill, and True Fire is the father of all artifacts. Both are the fires for refining pills and forging artifacts. The Dangwood Molten Fire is among the best of them. With this fire, I wouldn't be able to sleep if I didn't refine pills!"

He fought back the urge to refine it immediately, silently tucking it into his sleeve. He shattered the jade stone the other had left with a flick of his finger, took a jade box, and looked at its contents:

'Secret Method of the Submerged Flood Dragon Seeking Transformation, a breakthrough method for Pit Water… Vast Ocean…'

Li Ximing thought a bit more deeply than the two younger ones and said softly:

"I heard some time ago that Senior Donghe is already bedridden. How… is he now?"

Li Wushao lowered his eyes:

"When I achieved my divine ability, the old lord took me to see him. I used my Mansion Water divine ability to nourish his body, but he doesn't have much time left."

Li Ximing nodded, his expression somewhat complex:

"In the early years… my family was short on manpower, so he had to handle many things personally. As a result, a 'Pit Water' cultivator like him had to endure decades of hardship in the swirling sands of the great desert."

"My spiritual qi was earned through his toil. He had the aptitude to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, but because of this, he was often stuck in Qi Refining for many years. I owe him for that, but he was loyal and devoted. The old lord tried to procure spiritual items for him many times, but he knew the chances were slim and firmly refused… I had intended to compensate his descendants…"

"But now that heaven has granted this opportunity, with this technique acquired and you having attained the Dao, his time has come."

He straightened his sleeves, took out a pill with both hands, and then a spiritual water. He used a spell to merge them into a pool of shimmering blue medicinal liquid and said softly:

"A Purple Mansion Realm pill is dissolved in here. Though it's not some great elixir, his cultivation is low, so it cannot be used lightly. You take three drops to sustain him, and consume the rest yourself!"

The old demon naturally understood and bowed:

"I will personally act as his Dharma Protector and help him succeed with this art!"

He paused, then said tentatively:

"It's just that… this old demon has had a matter weighing on his mind for quite some time. I was afraid of disrupting important affairs before, so I didn't dare ask. Now that I have a divine ability or two, I'd like to venture to ask the Daoist Master…"

Seeing Li Ximing look his way, the demon beast asked nervously:

"I wonder… does the Daoist Master still remember a monk… named Kongheng… He was also a Guest Retainer in our family in the early years. This old demon hasn't heard any news of him for many years…"

Li Wushao was one of the people in the Li family with the deepest connection to Kongheng. Although he was foul-mouthed, he had always cared over the years. Only now that he had a divine ability did he dare to bring it up!

'Kongheng…'

Li Ximing was silent for a long time before saying softly:

"The Master Monk has his own Dao, and he has walked far on it, farther than any of us can see… But for a figure like him, on the day he attains the Dao, the whole world will see."
