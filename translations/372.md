# Chapter 465: Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual

Li Yuanjiao and Yuan Chengdun waited for a while. A fierce demonic wind blew in from the south, causing sand and pebbles to swirl in the valley. A black demonic mist surged from the horizon, and at the forefront stood a burly man wielding a white bone hammer.

Behind him were several demonic creatures, all of various strange appearances—a wolf and a deer flanked a pig demon in the center as they descended to the ground. Hidden in the Profound Patterned Bottle's mist, Li Yuanjiao performed a hand seal.

BOOM!

The group of demons joyously landed, triggering the Foundation Establishment Realm formation. A green light barrier rose around them, completely isolating them from their surroundings.

The Foundation Establishment Realm demon barely managed to keep its composure while the lesser demons, still in the Qi Cultivation Realm, were terrified. Some stumbled, and others tried to flee.

This Foundation Establishment Realm formation was from an artifact carried by Kong Tingyun, a direct disciple of Profound Peak Gate.

The lesser demons were instantly thrown into disarray. As they struggled in confusion, Yuan Chengdun silently emerged from the black mist, removing the two short rods from his back and delivering a heavy strike without uttering a word.

Golden-blue light flickered around him as his immortal foundation Sprawling Azure Mountain activated. With a heavy stomp on the ground and a swing of his two short rods, Yuan Chengdun shattered the bones of the wolf demon, breaking it into pieces seemingly effortlessly. The other rod struck the deer demon, causing its head to shatter into fragments, its blood splattering everywhere.

They would have made good Qi Cultivation Realm sacrificial offerings!

Seeing Yuan Chengdun kill two demons so swiftly, Li Yuanjiao feared he might continue the slaughter. He quickly maneuvered through the black mist, extending his hand to draw the Qingche Sword from its sheath, the sharp green-white blade gleaming menacingly.

Yuan Chengdun also rushed forward, his short rods gleaming with golden light as fine golden patterns emerged on his face. With a cold expression, he attacked the Foundation Establishment Realm pig demon which was shrouded in dark mist, angrily muttering and raising its bone hammer to block his attacks. The clash with Li Yuanjiao's sword arc produced a harsh, grating sound.

Yuan Chengdun ignored the demon's resistance, his short rods carrying formidable power as he skillfully executed his strikes.

The pig demon, caught between two formidable opponents, was in dire straits. It opened its mouth wide and unleashed a wave of demonic mist, hoping to fend off Yuan Chengdun's assault.

"What crude demonic art! You dare show this off?!" Yuan Chengdun laughed as the golden light of Sprawling Azure Mountain easily dispersed the mist. His rods then struck the pig demon's chest, causing it to spit blood and struggle to maintain its form, its body beginning to swell as it reverted to its original form.

Li Yuanjiao was about to intervene when Yuan Chengdun called out, "No need to interfere, fellow Daoist! It has been a while since I have had the pleasure of pummeling such a clumsy and thick-skinned pig demon... Let me savor this!"

Li Yuanjiao paused for a moment before smiling and stepping back, allowing Yuan Chengdun to continue in his pleasures.

In the dark mist, a golden light shone brightly as the pig demon transformed into a massive creature the size of a grand hall, its black fur-like armor with its green eyes glowing ominously.

Yuan Chengdun remained unfazed, wielding his short rods like hammers. Despite their relatively small size compared to the pig demon, he struck with full force, and the demon, using all its strength, barely managed to block the attacks while shouting loudly, "Sprawling Azure Mountain?! What did I do to offend your Yuan Family that you traveled so far to ambush me?!"

The pig demon noticed Li Yuanjiao but did not associate him with the Li Family. After all, if the Li Family wanted him dead, Li Tongya would have come, and the pig demon would have already been chopped into pieces. There would be no need for such elaborate schemes.

Yuan Chengdun simply replied with a grin, "How many man-eating demons have fallen to my short rods? Whether you offended our family or not, it does not matter!"

The pig demon, with its tough skin and thick hide, could not escape and was beaten relentlessly, crying out in pain and spitting blood.

Sprawling Azure Mountain truly lives up to its reputation, Li Yuanjiao thought to himself.

Yuan Chengdun's way of wielding the rods was unusual, holding them by the ends as if they were short hammers, striking with resounding force. Li Yuanjiao watched closely, noticing the skill in Yuan Chengdun's technique, and could not help but advise, "Hold back a bit, fellow Daoist! Do not kill it!"

As he spoke, a spring of grayish-green water gushed from the ground beneath his feet as a black water serpent coiled and spread out, capturing all the Qi Cultivation Realm demons trembling within the formation.

This rod technique is more than meets the eye... Li Yuanjiao thought as he observed more closely.

Yuan Chengdun's rod technique was likely a legacy passed down from the Yuan Family's connection with Yanyang Temple in the north and was at least a Grade Four technique. It was ancient and powerful, easily beating the pig demon into wailing submission.

Sprawling Azure Mountain must be an immortal foundation similar to Jade Court General, enhancing the body and excelling in combat arts...

After watching for a while, Li Yuanjiao heard the soft sounds of water as the Jing Dragon King returned, dragging along a few Qi Cultivation Realm demons.

"One at the late stage of Qi Cultivation Realm, and two at the early stage..."

The difference between the Foundation Establishment Realm and the Qi Cultivation Realm was like that between mortals and immortals. Li Yuanjiao glanced at them briefly and lost interest, focusing instead on the pig demon that was still howling in pain.

"My commander is of the demon den's direct lineage, sent here on a mission! You better know your place... Ah!"

The pig demon was struck a few more times as its eyes reddened with fury, and its aura surged as it opened its mouth wide, spewing a blood-red torrent filled with countless skulls and bones that all rushed toward Yuan Chengdun.

Yuan Chengdun remained unperturbed, flicking his finger to release a large, crystalline hide. With just a flick, it captured the blood-red river, causing it to crash to the ground like a dead snake, writhing for a moment before going still.

Yuan Chengdun continued his onslaught, switching through several rod techniques as the pig demon, beaten within an inch of its life, collapsed to the ground.

"In just the time it takes for an incense stick to burn... Your rod technique is truly impressive, fellow Daoist!" Li Yuanjiao praised.

Yuan Chengdun, slightly perspiring but in high spirits, replied, "My immortal foundation disperses demonic essence, leaving it unable to cast spells or perform techniques. Its body and artifacts are inferior to mine, and with the formation blocking any escape, it naturally met this fate."

Li Yuanjiao descended lightly, sealing the acupoints and Dao foundation of the pig demon. The black serpent dragon surged, binding all the small demons together before he stowed away the formation plate.

Yuan Chengdun smiled slightly, just about to take his leave when both of them suddenly fell silent.

A man stood just outside the formation.

He appeared to be a middle-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation in his late thirties or early forties. He wore a mismatched Daoist robe, his skin slightly tanned, and his pupils were vertical slits like those of a serpent dragon, emitting a reddish-brown glow as he quietly observed the two men.

Li Yuanjiao and Yuan Chengdun immediately became vigilant. The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator spoke in a hoarse voice, "A member of the Li Family?"

Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist and nodded.

"And you are..?"

The man, wary of Yuan Chengdun, softened his tone, "An old acquaintance from Mount Yue... I am Fei Luoya. How is Daoist Tongya doing these days?"

"Ah, it's you, Senior Fei Luoya! I am Li Yuanjiao."

Li Yuanjiao immediately understood. This man was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator left from Mount Wu and a close neighbor of the Li Family, the Mount Yue cultivator Fei Luoya.

Years ago, this person appeared when the Li Family made Eastern Mount Yue their vassal. Granduncle Li Tongya, borrowing the reputation of the sword immortal upheld by the families of Xiao and Fei, deterred him. Later, they even traded valuable medicines with him. They had some dealings in the past.

Having been fighting on someone else's territory for quite a while, it was no surprise that this Mount Yue cultivator had come to investigate. Li Yuanjiao apologized a few times, but Fei Luoya waved it off, saying in a low voice, "And this is?"

"Yuan Chengdun of the Yuan Family from Mushroom Forest Plain," Yuan Chengdun replied steadily, "I was sent by the elders of my clan to assist the Li Family in slaying demons."

Fei Luoya nodded in understanding, his hoarse voice continuing, "As it happens, I have something I wish to discuss with you."

Yuan Chengdun cupped his fist and tactfully announced, "Now that this matter is resolved, I shall take my leave."

With the mirror in hand and a good sense of the character of the people of Mount Yue, Li Yuanjiao had no fear of letting him go.

Fei Luoya began, "Daoist Tongya's fame for slaying the Maha is truly impressive. Although I live in this poor and remote place, I have heard of it as well. I wonder..."

Li Yuanjiao had avoided this topic once before, but seeing that Fei Luoya was fixated on it, he replied, "The ancestor is currently in seclusion."

Fei Luoya raised an eyebrow. His eyes, made more terrifying by his special cultivation method, stared at Li Yuanjiao as he let out a strange laugh.

"Slaying a Maha with a sword must have left Daoist Tongya gravely injured..."

Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes slightly, but before he could respond, Fei Luoya added, "To provoke a Maha... He must have done that under someone's orders, right?"

Li Yuanjiao, sharp as ever, quickly pieced it together and thought to himself, Granduncle must have used some Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's name to protect himself back then!

His expression shifted as he said, "I see now that Senior shares a deep connection with my granduncle! I apologize for my earlier rudeness."

This comment made Fei Luoya pause in surprise while Li Yuanjiao continued, "Though we are protected from above, there are certain orders... we must follow."

Having spent years doing dirty work under Duanmu Kui, Fei Luoya naturally empathized with this. He had always harbored a favorable impression of Li Tongya and welcomed Li Yuanjiao's attempt to befriend him.

He then said, "Do you know when Li Tongya will leave seclusion? I have a business proposition for him."

Li Yuanjiao responded, "Please tell me, Senior."

"Naturally, it involves killing someone," Fei Luoya said as he paused, his voice turning serious, "I have a peer from the same faction named Fu Daimu, a late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to my south. We have never gotten along. Recently, I heard that his Dao companion is about to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. I sense that this spells trouble for me, and more likely than not, he will come to kill me."

Fei Luoya shook his head as he continued in a graver tone, "Since he might try to kill me, I might as well find someone to kill him first. I have already enlisted the help of another peer from the same faction, but it is still not enough. I was hoping Daoist Tongya could lend a hand; with his help, success would be almost certain."

Li Yuanjiao did not want to be inexplicably dragged into a conflict between Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, so he gently shook his head.

However, Fei Luoya, with his crimson eyes glowing, waved his hand dismissively and said, "If Daoist Tongya does not act, I will have to abandon this place and leave. In the future, if there is a late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm shaman of Mount Yue lurking near your clan, life won't be easy for you either."

Li Yuanjiao raised his eyebrows and looked at the man. Fei Luoya's expression was somewhat indifferent as he slowly continued, "Fu Daimu has a dharma artifact, Mountain of Human Heads, that requires blood qi for sacrificial refinement."

Li Yuanjiao exhaled lightly and asked, "Do the high shamans still have any connection with Azure Pond Sect? I am afraid Fu Daimu might have backing."

Fei Luoya rasped, "How could I, a down-and-out Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, know such things? Your clan has deep connections, so naturally, it falls on your Li Family to investigate this."

Seeing Li Yuanjiao remain silent, Fei Luoya's expression grew serious as he continued, "I did not come here to provoke, but rather to urge your clan to prepare in advance. I, Fei Luoya, simply do not want to leave my homeland and swallow this bitter pill, but your clan cannot afford to relocate either!"

The Mount Yue cultivator paused and lowered his voice, saying, "I am sure you understand the way of the world—without the protection of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, even Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators are just pawns... I have had enough of being tossed around, living in darkness, unable even to step outside my own mountain gate!"

"I have practiced shamanic spells for many years and consider myself to be rather courageous. Please put in a good word for me with that person, fellow Daoist. If we can work together in the future, it'll indeed be a wonderful thing."

After leaving these words, Fei Luoya cupped his fist and took his leave, leaving Li Yuanjiao standing there in silence.

Inwardly smiling wryly, he thought to himself, You're not the only one—even my family is tired of being pawns too... We also long for the protection of a Purple Mansion Realm master of our own!"

Within the mirror world...

The jade slips piled high on Lu Jiangxian's desk had formed a small mountain, with the accompanying stone stool also overflowing with them. The floor beneath his white robe was similarly cluttered with various jade slips, rolling around and leaving no room to step.

"Li Yuanjiao's journey running all over the place this time has yielded quite a bounty!" Lu Jiangxian joyfully remarked.

Li Yuanjiao had truly ventured deep into the core of the Yuan Family's territory, even venturing into the regions of the Yue Cultivating Sect, rogue cultivators, Profound Peak Gate, and various prefectures. He even traveled upstream along the Great River, reaching the borders of the Shen Family, a Purple Mansion Realm immortal clan under the Yue Cultivating Sect's governance.

At present, 668 Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques, 98 Qi Cultivation Realm techniques, 21 Foundation Establishment Realm techniques, and 15 miscellaneous arts had been recorded. Lu Jiangxian materialized them one by one, piling them up on the mountaintop.

Gazing at the vast collection of jade slips, Lu Jiangxian felt a deep sense of security. He slowly reached out, and a glowing blue jade slip materialized in his hand, the Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual—a Grade Six cultivation method, directly leading to a Purple Mansion Realm immortal technique!

This was the first time Lu Jiangxian had acquired a Grade Six cultivation method, and it was also the first complete series of Purple Mansion Realm immortal techniques he had obtained.

This was a legacy that the Yuan Family had secretly safeguarded for 1,600 years, hidden beneath Mount Yuan in their territory, protected by seven layers of restrictive formations that even isolated the great void, making it inaccessible to even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

Of course, under Lu Jiangxian's divine sense, whether it was seven layers or seventy layers of formations, they were useless. The formations that could isolate the great void only caused him a slight pause before he effortlessly bypassed them.

As the Yuan Family's treasured legacy, the Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual was naturally encrypted with secret methods. Unfortunately for them, the jade slip containing the encryption was hidden beneath a memorial tablet, which Lu Jiangxian had also discovered.

After carefully studying this Purple Mansion Realm cultivation technique for a while, Lu Jiangxian was lost in thought.

The Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual centered around the Dao foundation known as Profound Goat, which could be cultivated all the way to form a Purple Mansion Realm divine ability.

This Grade Six cultivation method was the core, accompanied by four related immortal foundations for the Foundation Establishment Realm. Once these were cultivated after breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm, they could lead one to the peak of the realm.

These primary immortal foundations were Azure Crest Manifestation, Sprawling Azure Mountain, Almighty Crag, Abyss Observer, and Profound Goat.

They were all aligned with a single metallic essence, known as Azure Dam Divine Mountain Sprawling Essence.

At the end of the manual, there was an appendix that included a supplementary method, cultivating an immortal foundation called Lower Yang Essence, specifically prepared for cases where a particular immortal foundation could not be cultivated. This could substitute one of the immortal foundations in Azure Dam's Metallic Essence to form the metallic essence.

"Indeed, this is a complete legacy; they even prepared a lower-level substitute Dao Partner... It seems the Yanyang Temple was once a decent Dao lineage..." Lu Jiangxian mumbled softly.

Yuan Huyuan had claimed that much of the legacy from Yanyang Temple had been lost, but now, seeing the completeness of the Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual, it was clear that this was merely a lie to keep things under wraps.

"But the Yuan Family clearly possesses a Purple Mansion Realm immortal technique... so how could they fail to produce a single Purple Mansion Realm cultivator for over a thousand years?!"

Lu Jiangxian studied the technique for a while longer before identifying the issue: it lay in the core immortal foundation, Profound Goat, which required a specific form of Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth known as Variant Goat Profound Qi.

"Refined Yang Profound Qi had to be gathered from Azure Variant Mountain Stone exposed under the scorching sun. It took a year to gather a single wisp, and ten years to obtain a sufficient amount of Azure Variant Qi. Then, using a demon transformed from a sacrificial goat, the qi is repeatedly refined for ten years..."

Lu Jiangxian reviewed the refinement technique meticulously.

The method of gathering this Variant Goat Profound Qi was followed by a dense collection of attempts, all failed attempts to replace the required spiritual qi that were added by later generations.

"Ah, this explains everything... The Yuan Family, after migrating from the north, lost their source of Variant Goat Profound Qi long ago. Their stored spiritual qi gradually dwindled as one Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator after another failed to break through, leading to the decline of the technique...

"As a result, the supplementary Dao foundations became more commonly used by the Yuan Family... But no matter how much they practiced, they could only reach the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm, with no path forward," Lu Jiangxian concluded.

Holding this Purple Mansion Realm immortal technique in his hand, Lu Jiangxian carefully read through the section on divine abilities, feeling a sudden enlightenment. He now had some ideas for the Purple Mansion Realm section of his Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual, which had been stalled.

"However, with so many cultivation methods, I cannot just hand them out freely. If the Li Family were to practice the Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual, it might lead to a conflict with the Yuan Family and attract unwanted attention..."

Lu Jiangxian reconsidered his options.
