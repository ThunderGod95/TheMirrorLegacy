# Chapter 380: Chaos In Cloud Crowned Peak Market

Li Xuanxuan glanced at the man sideways, then seated himself before a desk. Stroking his beard, he said bluntly, "This secret technique is a rare perception technique... Three hundred Spirit Stones and it's yours, Daoist!"

This exorbitant price was clearly inflated, but knowing that he had to finish up soon and leave, the man in black was in no mood to haggle. He rudely snapped, "That's fine! Just hand over the technique... Don't waste my time!"

Seeing that the man was uninterested in bargaining, Li Xuanxuan agreed readily. With this, his suspicion that this cultivator harbored ill intentions increased from seventy to nearly ninety percent in certainty.

Smiling, he proposed, "Your generosity is impressive, Daoist. Let us proceed to the Xiao Residence to formalize this agreement and complete the transaction..."

The black-clad cultivator's demeanor shifted suddenly; his voice turned icy and he narrowed his eyes as he demanded, "What agreement?"

Li Xuanxuan feigned confusion and explained, "Is this your first visit, Senior? When it comes to transactions involving significant amounts, it's customary to involve the Xiao Family for validation and to draft a deed. This safeguards against any discrepancies, preventing any potential losses for you..."

The cultivator, clearly impatient, retorted gruffly, "There's no need for that! Just deliver the secret technique, and that will suffice!"

Li Xuanxuan nodded, still smiling, and reassured the man once more.

"Since you're ready to pay generously, I'll have my assistants fetch the deed from Xiao Residence. It won't be much trouble..."

He gave Li Qiuyang a meaningful look, and Li Qiuyang quickly exited the store. The cultivator in black grunted coldly and clapped his storage pouch, causing an array of dharma weapons to clatter out. An assortment of dharma weapons, each glowing faintly with mana, tumbled out with a clatter.

Among them were swords, axes, and halberds. Some were in poor condition, while others were fairly usable. All of these were smeared with dried blood that crumbled and scattered as they hit the floor.

"These dharma weapons are either of the Embryonic Breathing or Qi Cultivation Realm. Do they cover the cost?"

As his words hung in the air, dark brown dust drifted gently in the sunlight. Li Xuanxuan inhaled quietly and pretended to calculate, though thoughts were racing through his mind.

This man must be a devil cultivator from the north... The thought of such a group lurking here in the Cloud Crowned Peak Market is unsettling. That thunder pearl he carries is far too potent for use against someone of my low stature; it's likely intended to destroy the market's formation eye...

His gaze lingered on the assortment of dharma weapons, knowing deep down that there was no way he could save this store. At least he had already sent Li Qiuyang away; he trusted Qiuyang was sharp enough not to misinterpret his intentions.

"What's happening? What's wrong with you all?"

"Quiet! No fighting in the marketplace!"

The commotion outside grew louder, marked by the roar of mana collisions and the metallic clanging of dharma weapons. It seemed imminent that the group would soon make their move.

Li Xuanxuan's anxiety flared, and he softly said, "This doesn't come close to the agreed three hundred, Daoist!"

"Not enough?"

The black-robed cultivator, increasingly impatient, waved dismissively and reached again into his storage pouch.

Li Xuanxuan, feigning greed, sharply instructed Li Yuanyun who was lingering nearby, "You, get out of here!"

Li Yuanyun, along with a few apprentices of the store, quickly vacated the premises, easing Li Xuanxuan's worries somewhat.

He then called out, "Daoist, may I take another look at that exceptional item you showed earlier? I've been in this business for years, and it's the first time I've seen something so precious! Such a rare item could definitely fetch a handsome price!"

"Oh?"

The black-robed cultivator paused, then burst into hearty laughter as if he had just heard the funniest joke. Regaining his composure, he pulled the black jade pearl from his sleeve and chuckled.

"You have quite the eye! Here, take it!"

He tossed the Thunder Pearl toward Li Xuanxuan, who clumsily caught it. The cultivator then demanded coldly, "Now, hand over the secret technique!"

"Of course, immediately!"

Li Xuanxuan gazed at the precious pearl with a greedy glint in his eyes while retrieving a jade slip from the storage pouch at his waist and handing it over nonchalantly.

As the black-robed cultivator delved into the jade slip with his spiritual sense, Li Xuanxuan seized the opportunity to act. With a swift sweep of his sleeve, he sent the pile of dharma weapons scattering and cluttering loudly across the floor. Amidst the ensuing cacophony of clanging, he quickly burst through the door and made his escape.

"Huh?"

The cultivator surnamed Qiu was enraged upon realizing the jade slip contained nothing more than trivial travelogs and cultivation notes.

"Such audacity!" he cursed angrily.

Furious, he stamped his foot, causing a burst of white vapor to rise that rattled the building. He lunged at Li Xuanxuan, his palm wind transforming into clouds of white qi currents that surged toward his target.

Li Xuanxuan's expression darkened as he quickly activated the shimmering golden talisman that was already in his hand, unleashing a burst of golden light that enveloped him.

As a thick aura of blood-red light erupted, he retreated swiftly like the wind.

————

BOOM!

Li Xuanxuan's golden shield barely withstood a few breaths against the onslaught of the white qi currents before shattering like a fragile eggshell. He could not dodge in time, and part of the skin and flesh on his hand were scoured away, leaving a sight of his white bones exposed to view.

Gritting his teeth, he stifled a cry of pain, channeling all his mana to counter the black-robed cultivator's ferocious attack. He staggered back a few steps, then propelled himself into the air.

Li Xuanxuan had always sold the talismans he crafted for Spirit Stones to send home, neglecting to prepare anything of quality for himself. Feeling secure within the market, the talismans he retained were all only of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

The moment the shield was effortlessly shattered by a simple palm strike, he deeply regretted his lack of preparation.

"GAAAAAAAAHHHH!"

The apprentices, all mere cultivators in the Embryonic Breathing Realm, were caught completely off guard. One moment they were chatting idly outside the door, and the next, they were screaming in agony as white qi enveloped their bodies.

The upper torso of the apprentice closest to the door instantly evaporated, leaving only the lower half of his body behind—two stark, white thigh bones grotesquely standing on the floor.

The others met similarly gruesome fates: some were beheaded, while those who retained their heads managed only a few cries of despair before collapsing.

Li Yuanyun, who was watching the commotion on the street, was unaffected by the white qi but was drenched in cold sweat from fright and screamed in terror.

He was horrified by the sight of an apprentice, who had lost his lower body, crawling toward him with blood-red hands, leaving a trail of crimson on the ground behind him. In his terror, he jumped up and fled without looking back.

Before Li Xuanxuan could even assess his injuries, the cultivator surnamed Qiu was already advancing toward him at a rapid pace. His bamboo hat was raised high, revealing a face marred by scars. His eyes glinted fiercely as he bellowed, "How dare you deceive me?!"

Li Xuanxuan, heart racing, hurled the dark jade pearl like a lightning bolt toward the cultivator's face. At the same time, he activated the Blood Escape Technique, vanishing in a trail of crimson.

The cultivator sneered.

"Ridiculous!"

The Thunder Pearl required a specific spell and mantra to detonate it, which was why the cultivator surnamed Qiu had dared to hand it over to Li Xuanxuan without a hint of fear.

When he saw Li Xuanxuan throw the pearl without any incantation, he merely gave a cold snort and continued to advance undeterred.

BOOM!

The dark pearl exploded in midair with a flash of crimson sparks, lighting up the cultivator's face. He froze, shocked.

"IMPOSSIBLE!" he exclaimed in shock.

Almost instinctively, he reached for a talisman in his sleeve. As he prepared to launch the talisman, he fought the impulse suddenly, stepping back and watching the black jade pearl as it fell, producing only a few tiny sparks.

"Phew..."

The cultivator wiped the cold sweat from his brow and then retrieved the jade pearl. He chuckled coldly. Noting that the crimson light was already too far off for him to catch up to it, he muttered, "What a clever man. He stuck a piece of talisman on this pearl and nearly fooled me with it... Fortunately, years of fighting experience have saved me from wasting a precious protective treasure."

"Unfortunately, I still need to proceed to the formation point. I'll have to let this one go... The Li Family, huh? I've heard they're a sword immortal clan... With Li Tongya dead, I suppose I can lead my people through there..."

He cast a distant glance at Li Xuanxuan and abruptly turned away. Li Yuanyun had already scrambled to his feet and sprinted a dozen chi within moments.

The black-robed cultivator let out a cold laugh and snapped his fingers.

"AH!"

A white aura, swift as a meteor, struck Li Yuanyun's exposed back. He had time only for a brief cry of pain before his skin and flesh vanished, immediately becoming reduced to a heap of white bones that was scattered across the ground.

The marketplace was in chaos, littered with signs of the recent skirmish. In the pulsating light of the white formation, the cultivator surnamed Qiu let out a hearty laugh and flew toward the formation point where he was supposed to be heading to.

Li Xuanxuan, employing the potent Blood Escape Technique, sped forward. Ahead lay the Xiao Family's grand formation, flickering intermittently, its energy undulating like water ripples—clearly on the verge of collapse due to both internal and external pressures.

He stared intently at it. Though it was noon, darkness and swirling devilish smoke enveloped the outside. He paused, hesitant to venture out.

"Who knows how many devil cultivators are lurking outside, just waiting for this formation to break and swarm in... all eager to plunder this market... If I go out recklessly now, I risk becoming the appetizer for those fiends!"

Blood qi and mana were flowing out of him like a river that had burst its banks. Li Xuanxuan could barely endure it, and the vivid red of his shield was also too conspicuous to maintain.

Looking back and seeing that the black-robed cultivator had not followed, Li Xuanxuan quickly deactivated the technique and stumbled into the street, coughing painfully. Every part of his body ached. He checked himself with his spiritual consciousness, only to find himself much thinner with a ghastly visage.

"Fortunately, it's not as bad as it could have been," Li Xuanxuan murmured with a quiet sigh of relief.

He had narrowly escaped death by employing the Blood Escape Technique, bracing for the severe toll it could take on his vital qi. To his surprise, it had merely shortened his lifespan and altered his appearance.

He suddenly winced in pain. The wound on his hand was deep, exposing his bone, and blood was spilling copiously.

Li Xuanxuan sealed the wound with mana, cast several healing spells, and swallowed two pills hastily. "Venturing out now seems impossible. Qiuyang must still be around the marketplace, hiding somewhere... and Yuanyun is probably dead by now..." he muttered somberly to himself.

Li Xuanxuan almost could not breathe. Li Xuanling had only died recently, followed by Li Tongya. Now, with Li Xuanling's son also dead in the marketplace, the weight of his guilt was unbearable...

If not for Li Qinghong, who now stood as one of the two strongest cultivators in the family, and Xicheng and Xijun, who each possessed a spiritual orifice, the lineage of Li Tongya would be on the brink of extinction.

Reflecting on these circumstances deepened Li Xuanxuan's sorrow, a feeling that overshadowed even the loss of years from his life.

Looking at the sky, Li Xuanxuan realized his only chance to escape was to wait for the devil cultivators to break the grand formation and swarm into this marketplace.

He paused to rest, catching his breath and recalibrating the qi within his body. His mind began racing with thoughts.

This invasion is too sudden! Aren't the devil cultivators still in neighboring prefectures...? How did they traverse the vast Mushroom Forest Plain and appear in Lixia Prefecture unnoticed?!

Does... Xiao Chuting know about this?!

He huddled in a corner to remain unseen as more thoughts continued racing through his head.

The marketplace was under the supervision of Xiao Yongling, a cultivator of the Foundation Establishment Realm. However, he was reassigned five years ago, leaving only Xiao Ruyu, who is still a Qi Cultivator here... No, maybe Xiao Ruyu has already left the mountain long ago!

Li Xuanxuan looked up at Cloud Crowned Peak which was shrouded in dark clouds, his heart filled with unease. If Qiu, planted in the market as a spy, was already a peak Qi Cultivator, that must mean that the Cloud Crowned Peak was currently surrounded by Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators!

"Four..."

Li Xuanxuan observed silently. After Xiao Yongling's reassignment, the Xiao Family had only one or two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators left at the marketplace on the Cloud Crowned Peak. They were clearly outnumbered and forced into a defensive stance.

"It takes the time to burn a stick of incense to travel here from Xianyou Peak, and a quarter of that time has already passed."

Li Xuanxuan's expression was grim. He was painfully aware of his modest abilities—merely at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and not adept in combat.

If the situation escalated into chaos, he feared the worst.

BOOM!

The attic before him exploded with a loud bang, and as scorching flames erupted, Li Qiuyang's hurried steps halted. He looked up at the sky, awash with streaks of light, and felt torn.

"That black-robed cultivator is most likely a devil cultivator... Brother Xuan probably sent me out to seek help from the Xiao Family... But given the current situation, the Xiao Family can hardly protect themselves, let alone assist others!"

The marketplace sprawled around Cloud Crowned Peak, crowned by a grand formation that enveloped the entire area. Numerous nodes were scattered throughout the market.

Amidst the dark clouds looming over the peak, Li Qiuyang spotted several black-robed cultivators. It was then that he realized that seeking help by ascending the mountain would be futile.

As the angry shouts of the other black-robed cultivators that were wreaking havoc in the marketplace filled the air, a sense of foreboding grew within Li Qiuyang. Hiding under the eaves, he brooded darkly.

Brother Xuan must be fighting that cultivator right now... That man is a peak Qi cultivator. How can Brother Xuan possibly hold his ground...?

He wanted to step forward but paused, gripped by hesitation.

But I am just an unrefined Qi Cultivator... I'd be killed instantly by the devil cultivators as soon as I stepped out! How can I even stand a chance to help Brother Xuan?!

Outside, the battle raged with cries of pain and splattering blood. Gritting his teeth, Li Qiuyang knew he could not remain hidden for long without being discovered. He quietly activated a Qi Restraining Technique before cautiously venturing out.

The black-robed devil cultivator ahead was an early-stage Qi Cultivator and was wielding a large ax. He radiated a fierce aura, laughing maniacally as he swung his weapon.

Opposite him, a group of Xiao Family cultivators stood in formation, led by a figure who had only recently attained the Qi Cultivation Realm. Li Qiuyang, familiar with the local cultivators, recognized him and recalled their brief interactions.

Behind him stood five cultivators of the third and fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm holding white mana light in their hands that formed a small, shimmering formation. Each time the devil cultivator's axe struck, the formation shook, threatening to collapse under the force.

A chill ran down Li Qiuyang's spine. He had often seen Xiao Family's cultivators resolve disputes with calm efficiency, but now they struggled to hold their ground. It was his first time witnessing such a formidable battle.

The Xiao Family's cultivators are strong, and they have always been regarded as formidable among their peers. Yet, they have to form a defensive formation just to withstand this devil cultivator's assault!

Li Qiuyang reached into his sleeve and pulled out two talismans—one early-stage and one late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm—which he had initially planned to sell for Spirit Stones.

Holding them tightly, he prepared for action.

The Xiao Family's cultivators, sweating under pressure, glanced up and caught sight of Li Qiuyang hiding in the distance. A fleeting relief flickered across their faces before they swiftly resumed a guise of anxiety. Quietly, they marshaled their strength, preparing to coordinate their counterattack with Li Qiuyang.

Understanding their intentions, Li Qiuyang slowly channeled his mana into the talisman in his hand. As soon as it glowed with a red aura, he cried out loudly, "RELEASE!"
