# Chapter 1107: Kuidu

Tiger's Frontier, Great Xiukui Monastery.

The ancient stone bricks were suffused with an air of antiquity. Daoist flags fluttered over grounds buried in snow. The once-famous Great Xiukui Monastery was now empty. Even the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator who used to sweep the summit like a handyman was gone. Withered yellow leaves lay scattered in the snow, painting a scene of utter desolation.

A Daoist Master in black robes stood silently in the courtyard. At his feet knelt a youth, tears streaming down his face as he stammered out his report, periodically pounding the ground in anguish.

Lin Chensheng felt as if he were in a waking nightmare.

"I'm the only one left?"

What was the Great Xiukui Monastery like before he, Lin Chensheng, entered seclusion?

Internally, it was guarded by a contemporary Sword Immortal, the last Xiukui's Choosen One to have entered Profound Truth Mountain. Externally, it had a heroic middle-stage Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master in his prime, his methods superb. And then there was the brilliant rising star, who had achieved the Purple Mansion Realm at a shockingly young age!

If not a power that shook all of Jiangnan, they were at least the undisputed third pillar of the Yue State's Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. They suppressed Crimson Reef to the east and held the line against Ting Lei to the south. He, Lin Chensheng, was a prodigy of Xiukui. When he slew Guo Hong'er at sea, even Daoist Master Tianwan hadn't dared to say a word!

And now? He had emerged from his breakthrough, shattering his bottleneck, high-spirited, ready to carry on the divine ability of the third generation... only to find a dilapidated courtyard and fields of melting snow.

'The Sword Immortal Choosen One... slain in Qinling. The Monastery Lord... captured by talisman and executed. Both fell on the same day... Only my uncle struggles on, but they... they still refuse to stop... They are determined to eradicate our divine ability!'

Lin Chensheng closed his eyes for a long moment. Wiping the tears from his face, he said,

"Take me... to see Uncle."

Lin Ya scrambled to his feet, his face abnormally pale. He led him into the Kuidu Palace, guiding him past a Spiritual Treasure pill furnace and into a hidden passage. They descended deep into the darkness before arriving at a small, hidden chamber.

The room was barely ten feet across, constructed from dark wood. On a small platform in the center rested a palm-sized wooden sarcophagus. An incense burner sat on the floor, holding three spent incense sticks.

A small, brown-patterned pouch lay discarded in a corner.

Lin Ya did not dare to enter.

"Daoist Master, you only need to light the incense!" he wept. "This junior will wait outside!"

Swallowing his grief, Lin Chensheng used a divine ability to light the incense. He waited, but there was no sound. He raised his head, tears welling anew.

"Uncle... Chensheng has attained the divine ability! Uncle!"

After a long while, a sound came from the wooden sarcophagus. Something seemed to be shifting inside. A voice, faint as a whisper, emerged.

"Good..."

The voice was hoarse and trembling, laced with unbearable agony. Yet Lin Chensheng could faintly recognize his elder's voice. His hands shook, uncertain what to do.

"Uncle..." he murmured.

Houfu's voice suddenly grew stronger.

"Did the Lingu family succeed!"

A dark premonition surfaced in Lin Chensheng's heart.

"Lingu Lanying did not fail us!" he cried.

The man in the sarcophagus cried out, his voice thick with sorrow.

"Chensheng... to stand firm is death; to defect is life. Leave Tiger's Frontier. Go to the Yang clan, quickly! Chensheng! Lingu must listen to you... In this flourishing age of True Qi, Xiukui's many treasures will be of great use. You must seize this chance for yourself!"

"Wonderful! This junior now understands the old Daoist Master's intentions!"

Lin Chensheng couldn't believe those words—'To stand firm is death; to defect is life'—had come from his own uncle. He felt nothing but pain, tears streaming unchecked.

"Uncle, please take care... I still need your guidance. Whatever medicines or pills you need, I will fetch them for you!"

The wooden sarcophagus fell silent.

Lin Chensheng knelt, seized by a panic he couldn't control. He didn't know how long he knelt there. He opened his mouth to ask again, but then he heard Houfu's low voice once more.

"I have suffered the calamity of the Crystalline Wu Earth for twenty-five years. For ten years, the pain was like being flayed by knives, chopped by axes, scorched by fire, and drowned by water. For another ten, it was like sharp blades grinding my bones and shattering thunder. The last five years have been spent stripping my soul and seizing my mind."

"I worried Xiukui could not survive this trial, so I endured it all."

The small sarcophagus vibrated slightly, as if its occupant were restlessly turning over. Amidst the drifting incense smoke, Houfu continued.

"When I was born, snow filled the sky, white strands like immortal ropes, yet the moonlight shone through like water. Father was overjoyed. Following ancient custom, he asked a Sword Immortal to grant me a name. That old senior was at Profound Truth discussing the Dao, and he consulted Daoist Master Shang Miao... Her divination skills were astounding. After long consideration, she replied: 'The Supreme Yang lineage is currently in the generation of _Guang_ (Vast). The Xiukui Daoist Tradition is in the generation of _Hou_ (After). He shall be known as Houfu.'"

"A _fu_... is the spiritual cord for a great sarcophagus. To aid in a funeral, one must hold the cord. Thus, I, Lin Wei, am the spiritual cord for the Supreme Yang sarcophagus. Our Xiukui Monastery often deals in matters of life and death, so we did not see this as inauspicious and accepted the name. Thinking on it today, Daoist Master Shang Miao was truly benevolent. It was a hidden warning."

Lin Chensheng stared blankly at the sarcophagus. The man inside, reduced to a sliver of True Spirit and a trace of divine ability, still possessed the unyielding pride of Houfu of the Great Xiukui Monastery.

"The North sought to use my 'noble integrity' to control Xiukui. They thought that by leaving me an escape route, I would cling to the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition's last shred of dignity. They wanted to impale me on the horns of a dilemma, torn between my integrity and the Daoist Tradition. It would have been better if Lin Wei had just died at Xuanmiao Temple! Died twenty-five years ago!"

"Cultivators of the Great Xiukui Monastery can accept execution, but never humiliation! The Supreme Yang has lost its luster. Today, I die for it!"

Lin Chensheng's mind went blank. Colors swirled before his eyes, and a fine, dense cracking filled his ears. The wooden sarcophagus, as if it had been baked under a harsh sun for ten days, crumbled into fragments with a series of sharp cracks.

The glowing gravel and gray ash within spilled out, but the flow was weak, collapsing into a pile that buried his knees.

_Patak._

Daoist Master Houfu, Lin Wei, had exhausted his last shred of life-mandate. A dignified Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, so honored in life, died without a single heaven-shaking phenomenon, without the lament of his Daoist Tradition.

A pile of ash. That was all.

Lin Chensheng knelt in a daze for an unknown time. Only when he heard Lin Ya's terrified kowtowing from outside did he snap back to reality. He numbly picked up the cloth bag from the corner and, his spirit lost, retreated the way he had come.

Outside the hall, the sky was filled with heavy snow under a bright, clear moon.

He walked back to his original spot, his boots leaving deep prints in the snow and withered leaves. The youth followed him out and knelt before him, kowtowing as if he already knew what had happened.

Lin Chensheng looked back at the great hall, a sense of dread and unfamiliarity creeping over him. As the moon climbed higher, the plaque above the entrance slowly began to glow.

Kuidu Palace.

...

The Capital immortals mountain gate was situated above White Ye. The surrounding lands were dominated by hills, and a turbid river surged past, casting a gray, gloomy pall over the landscape. The mountains were riddled with caves and grottos, carved with all manner of ghouls, monsters, and spirits. The high halls, in contrast, were built of seamless bluestone.

The faint light of divine abilities flickered on the ground. After a moment of silence, the portly figure in the highest seat sneered, seemingly to himself.

"It seems you've received your orders as well... A pack of cowards, frightened out of their wits by Vast Cicada's death. Now they're reduced to ordering us around."

As his voice faded, a figure stepped from the Great Void and replied,

"The Helian family is indebted to the Profound Governance. We will naturally do our utmost."

"Utmost?"

The gray light of Valley Water flared as Murong Yan spoke, his voice indifferent. 

"I cultivate 'Valley Water'; I come and go as I please. Your Helian family cultivates Baleful Qi. Without reinforcements from Xuanmiao, would you dare linger? I doubt Li Zhouwei is the only one who came!"

His words were sharp. Helian Wujiang crossed his arms and replied casually, 

"'Valley Water' certainly has its merits in facing calamities... But I ask you, fellow Daoist, if you were in Vast Cicada's position, what confidence would you have of escaping? Li Zhouwei alone is more than you could handle!"

Helian Wujiang lacked a backer like the Murong family and clearly didn't dare challenge the Profound Governance. He deftly deflected the topic, but Murong Yan merely chuckled.

"I appreciate your concern, fellow Daoist... but I am not stained by Bright Yang's karma. My Valley Water divine ability is growing. If we fight, who _really_ stands to lose? It certainly won't be me!"

Helian Wujiang's heart darkened.

He knew Murong Yan was capable. Valley Water was a prominent Great Dao. If this man had used his full strength, the situation here would never have deteriorated to this point. But that fateful battle at the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter had, by a twist of fate, prevented enmity from forming between the Murong family and the Li clan. Instead, it had made Murong Yan aware of the schemes against him from within the Compassion Buddhist Land.

He had changed completely after that. This Daoist Master simply wore that ugly skin-bag, shadowboxing, refusing to commit to a decisive move!

Helian Wujiang shot him a dark look and said in a low voice,

"You had better have an explanation ready, fellow Daoist. Do you truly believe you can stay aloof forever? You walk the riverbank too often; eventually, your shoes will get wet. Your... freedom... is only because the right person has not yet been tempted to act against you."

The threat landed. Murong Yan's face grew visibly darker. The skin-bag he wore was already ugly; this made it grotesque. He had no rebuttal.

'I can avoid it once or twice, but can I avoid it ten or twenty times? As long as those in the Buddhist Land haven't given up, I'll be dragged into this karmic debt sooner or later!'

The two Daoist Masters sparred verbally. Far below them, a man in black robes knelt on the lowest step, his head bowed so low it almost touched the floor, not daring to utter a sound.

A dark shadow fell over Gongsun Bofan's heart.

Ever since Guan Gongxiao and Guan Lingdie had entered seclusion, their own Daoist Master Yehui almost never visited the Capital immortals Dao. The cultivation of the main family's direct line grew weaker with each generation. The Guan family was small to begin with, and its power within the sect had gradually been divided, allowing many Guest Retainers with different surnames to rise.

For Guest Retainers like him, this wasn't necessarily a bad thing. But Gongsun Bofan was no fool. He had long sensed that something was wrong... but what could he do?

'It has truly come to this.'

He didn't recognize either of the Daoist Masters in the hall, but their words terrified him. His mind was reeling when the two above him suddenly fell silent. A calm, flat voice echoed through the hall.

"Activate the formation. Meet the enemy."

Gongsun Bofan knew the order was for him. He scrambled to his feet, fumbling for a token, and shone it at a nearby jade platform.

Above the hall, the sky-blotting black light of the great formation pulsed, then slowly turned transparent. It revealed a horrifying vista: boundless, multicolored blood clouds warring with the Heavenly Light!

A youth stood against the horizon, clad in black-gold Qilin armor. His purple-feathered Campaign Cloak snapped in the wind, magnificent and imposing. A long halberd was planted in the clouds beside him. At his feet stood three Holder of the Profound youths: one in blue-purple armor like a general, one in handsome blue-white robes, and one in a cloud-robe, gripping a profound sword.

Their eyes were all golden.

Gongsun Bofan, a man known for his composure, felt his legs turn to jelly.

'Li Zhouwei... White Qilin...'

The face was familiar, yet foreign. Gongsun Bofan saw only a terrifying majesty, a ferocious aura. The surface-level calm and thoughtfulness he remembered were gone, replaced by something that felt... inevitable.

Scenes from the past flashed before his eyes. He had followed Guan Gongxiao, suffering losses at Li Zhouwei's hands. Decades had passed in a blink—not so long for a cultivator. He himself had progressed rapidly, climbing from the middle stage of Foundation Establishment Realm to its peak, with nowhere left to go...

'And him? He already commands a divine ability, his presence overwhelming all cultivators. He personally slew the fifth-generation Maha, striking terror into the hearts of all who wield such power...'

And Guan Gongxiao? He was still struggling, uncertain if he could even attain a divine ability.

"Clang!"

The two sides confronting each other above White Ye exchanged no words. Li Zhouwei had already drawn his halberd, erupting with power as he plummeted from the sky!

"Boom!"

A brilliant, illusory-white light shot skyward to meet him. It was that Spiritual Artifact, which was neither staff nor sword.

The River-Wall Staff. Murong Yan!

Whether from fear or spite, and even knowing Li Zhouwei's Audience with the Celestial Gate was damaged and unrecovered, Helian Wujiang had chosen to face Situ Huo, leaving Li Zhouwei to Murong Yan.

But the tables had turned long ago. The Li Zhouwei who had just broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, alone and unarmed, was gone.

The man Murong Yan faced now was a middle-stage Purple Mansion Realm King Wei of the Great Song.

Even though Murong Yan had been at this stage for longer, and knew his opponent was injured, his expression was grave. He attacked with his full strength.

In an instant, a gale howled and the world went dark. A vast, golden-sun-drenched desert manifested once more, solemn and immense. Murong Yan's expression flickered. A torrent of gray light surged from him, and though it was a much smaller domain, it steadily held the opposing divine ability at bay.

On the other side, Helian Wujiang squared off against Situ Huo. He touched the three Spiritual Artifacts at his waist, only to receive an indifferent glance from the old man. Situ Huo quietly rested a hand on the golden-red saber at his back and sneered.

"Courting death."

His heart was cold with arrogant fury.

'Even if Li Zhouwei just slew Vast Cicada, you have no right to assume he is more dangerous than I.'

Facing Helian Wujiang, Situ Huo's subservient, shameless demeanor vanished, replaced by the cold, bone-deep arrogance he truly possessed. He looked at his opponent with utter contempt.

Helian Wujiang, though not the strongest of his peers and more focused on cultivation than killing arts, was no easy target. He coldly drew his technique-sword. But as he did, a golden ring echoed, and the man before him vanished!

Monarch's Lost Sheep.

The old man reappeared instantly behind Helian Wujiang, his saber drawn in a vicious arc.

Blood-Omen Tower!

A pillar of blood-light tore through the sky!

After centuries, this blood-drenched blade once again gleamed on the mainland. The crimson light flared and vanished in a heartbeat, fast enough to numb the mind. With two items comparable to Spiritual Treasures used in tandem, Helian Wujiang—a dignified middle-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who knew an attack was coming—was still half a beat too slow.

A red line appeared on his throat. In that same instant, his Body Divine Ability flared, his entire form dissolving into a cascading waterfall of black mist, shot through with streaks of blood, scattering in all directions.

Thousand-Hundred Body.

Golden Malice roiled on Situ Huo's body, clinging to him. He watched the baleful mist disperse, a cold smile touching his lips.

"The great divine ability, 'Clamping Hatred's Mouth,' which shook the Middle Ages... you cast aside the trunk to grasp the branches, turning it into this pathetic little self-preservation art. Pathetic!"

Helian Wujiang, wounded by the saber strike, felt his divine ability destabilize. The blood-light within his misty form pulsed. Unable to speak, he projected his voice with his power:

"Try me, old dog!"

His Helian family, though demonic cultivators who practiced with Baleful Qi, were converts, not founders of the path. Their most talented ancestor had focused on the Whole Pill. They couldn't compare to a true demonic Daoist Tradition like the Touba family, who possessed countless powerful arts. He knew 'Thousand-Hundred Body' was inferior.

But he had his reasons for daring to confront Situ Huo.

'Baleful Qi naturally counters Metal Virtue! 'Thousand-Hundred Body' may be inferior, but it's perfect for resisting his metal-qi divine ability!'

Situ Huo watched him coolly. Reversing his grip on the saber, he drew a bowl from his sleeve and collected the ambient metal-qi. But he didn't immediately move against Helian Wujiang. Instead, he paused and cast a sideways glance at Li Zhouwei.

The old fox's eyes narrowed. He understood.

'Qi Lanyan has abandoned Capital immortals. If he truly intended to defend this place, he never would have sent just these two defeated generals.'

The cultivators at the Capital immortals Dao gate wouldn't even protect Yehui, so they were a lost cause. But Shanji absolutely could not be lost. What, then, was the plan? Situ Huo's heart grew colder.

'Yang Ruiyi's warning wasn't just talk. He is determined to divide my power in Jiangbei... Slowing my breakthrough to the Purple Mystery realm... that's how he maintains his balance of power!'
