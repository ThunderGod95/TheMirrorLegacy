# Chapter 212: Muyuan

Master Jiang was still scanning the surroundings, oblivious to the distant golden light that was headed directly toward him. He took a few steps backward but as soon as he performed another hand seal, a searing pain shot through his abdomen.

The golden arrow had found its mark, causing him to let out a cry of agony. At the same time, he realized that he had been discovered.

"Young master, help me!" he called out, desperation lacing his voice.

Master Jiang, a cultivator only at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, lacked real combat experience as he had devoted his whole life to mastering curse spells specialized in ambushing opponents.

The arrow had pierced deep into his abdomen, sapping his vital qi. The Astral Qi in Li Xuanfeng's powerful attack surged in him painfully, leaving Master Jiang unable to ride the winds for escape.

Beside him, Yu Muyuan paled, gripped by fear. Hearing Master Jiang's cries, he exclaimed, "How is this possible?! We're so far away! Does Li Xuanfeng have some sort of divine ability?!"

Despite his shock, Yu Muyuan moved fast and struck Master Jiang's Shenyang Mansion without any hesitation. Master Jiang's eyes immediately turned bloodshot and blood came spewing out from all the seven orifices of his body.

The Shenyang Mansion was where the soul resided. Master Jiang was already sweating profusely and paralyzed by the pain and upon being struck by Yu Muyuan, he immediately turned limp and collapsed onto the floor like a dead pig.

Yu Muyuan's mind raced as he spoke, already formulating his next moves. He swiftly removed Master Jiang's storage pouches before disfiguring the man's face beyond recognition with a fire spell. Then, he slapped several Wind Movement Talismans onto Master Jiang's body, sending him away like a leaf caught in a gust of wind.

After doing all that, he used his talismans without holding back, hiding inside layers and layers of shields before activating a dharma artifact‚Äîa spirit shield.

Yu Muyuan discarded the two storage pouches into the lake, committing their location to memory before he vanished into the distance.

In the next moment, a second burst of golden light glinted in the sky, accompanied by a middle-aged swordsman who was flying right behind it.

Yu Muyuan's heart sank as terror gripped him.

"Not again! And Li Tongya..! M-My... fate is sealed!" he cried out in fear, almost whimpering

Li Tongya had always been perceptive. With just a glance at Master Jiang's body flying in the sky, he could tell that it was a diversion tactic. His gaze swiftly honed in on Yu Muyuan, who was making a hasty retreat.

Yu Muyuan was always cautious in his actions. The robe he wore could conceal his spiritual sense, making it difficult for Li Tongya to discern his true strength and real identity. Yet, Li Tongya could tell from this person's behavior and movements that he was extremely afraid of him.

"Bastard... have a taste of my blade!" Li Tongya roared, unsheathing his sword and sending a white-colored Celestial Moon Sword arc.

BOOM!

Yu Muyuan had conjured a small floating golden shield from what seemed to be a remarkable dharma artifact of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

It was as expected of a prominent family; despite being an insignificant descendant of the Yu Family, Yu Muyuan possessed a dharma artifact that was superior to Li Tongya's own.

Li Tongya had gotten the dharma sword in his hand from a woman from the Wu Family. As it clashed against Yu Muyuan's shield, the force of the impact sent the shield flying backward, its light dimming amidst the powerful reverberations that echoed through the air.

Undeterred, Yu Muyuan channeled more mana into the shield, striving to withstand the relentless assault.

Unfortunately for Yu Muyuan though, Li Tongya had grown significantly stronger. With another powerful sword slash, he broke Yu Muyuan's dharma artifact into two, which was swiftly followed by yet another strike that pierced through the many layers of shields Yu Muyuan had conjured with a barrage of talismans. Li Tongya's third strike was aimed directly at Yu Muyuan's chest.

Yu Muyuan hastily performed a hand seal, attempting to defend himself in futility. However, before he could complete it, the golden light had already pierced through his abdomen, disrupting his spellcasting.

Now coughing up blood, Yu Muyuan felt another chilling sensation spread through his chest as Li Tongya's sword aura penetrated deeply into his flesh and bone. Shocked by Li Tongya's strength, Yu Muyuan struggled to catch his breath.

With the Law of Celestial Moon, Li Tongya was no longer the man who could only rely on the initial stance of the Celestial Moon Slash technique and the sword arc released by it to overpower his opponents.

Within moments, Yu Muyuan, despite being in the middle stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, realized he was on the brink of defeat. Fortunately, he had prepared for this and kept a piece of white talisman on him. After a moment of activation, a radiant golden glow finally enveloped him.

"A talisman of the Foundation Establishment Realm?!"

Although Li Tongya could have risked decapitating Yu Muyuan with his sword, he deemed it unwise as he was unsure of the talisman's capabilities. Unwilling to risk his life yet hoping to capture Yu Muyuan alive, Li Tongya unleashed one last move with his sword before withdrawing.

The sharp blade drew blood this time, causing Yu Muyuan to grunt in pain.

However, to his surprise, the gray-robed man did not use the talisman to attack Li Tongya. With one decisive motion, he slapped the talisman onto his own head.

BOOM!

A brilliant golden light erupted above Moongaze Lake, engulfing Yu Muyuan in a fiery blaze. Mana fluctuations surged and flickered across the lake's surface for a fleeting moment before dissipating.
ùìØùôßùìÆùìÆùíòùìÆùôóùô£ùíêùíóùíÜùìµ.ùì¨ùì∏ùíé

Stumbling backward to avoid the burst of fire, Li Tongya's expression darkened with silent frustration. He activated his mana to shake the blood off his blade, gritting his teeth as he muttered to himself.

"What a flashy way to die..."

Li Tongya was quite certain that this whole incident was likely the doing of the Yu Family. No other families in the area possessed the power to harm his Li Family or would recklessly employ talismans of the Foundation Establishment Realm in such a manner.

With no further recourse available to him, Li Tongya could only release a frustrated sigh before reluctantly turning back.

Li Tongya recovered another gray-robed man from the depths of the lake, bloodied and lifeless. He removed the man's hood, only to find a charred black mass where his face once was.

"Second Uncle."

Li Xuanfeng descended from the air, his face slightly pale yet still filled with anger as he looked at the corpse in Li Tongya's hands.

"Disfiguring the man's face is useless. Qi Cultivators around the lake are well-known figures. This person was an elderly man and his clothes were still intact. If we just display the body to the other families, I'm sure they'll recognize this person..." he remarked coldly.

By the time Li Xuanfeng had finished speaking, his anger had ebbed slightly. Feeling that something was amiss, Li Tongya shook his head.

"This is not the right place for discussion."

Li Xuanfeng nodded uncertainly. With a surge of magical power, Li Tongya summoned a flame to cremate the corpse in his grasp.

Together, they then soared into the sky and headed back to Mount Lijing.

As soon as they left, two figures emerged on the lake. One had a cold demeanor and white sideburns and was clad in a gray robe that billowed in the wind. Behind him stood a younger figure, who was gritting his teeth as tears streamed down his face.

"Second Brother..." Yu Mugao's voice trembled, his words hoarse with emotion.

Meanwhile, Yu Xiaogui wore a grim expression, his voice barely above a whisper as he mumbled, "How did it come to this..? Master Jiang's death is one thing, but losing Muyuan and arousing suspicion from the Li Family... This isn't worth it at all!"

Yu Xiaogui's resolve remained firm as he refused to intervene and watched Yu Muyuan die before his eyes.

"This wasn't a mere oversight in planning. There's something off about this Li Xuanfeng... I've never heard of someone with a spiritual sense spanning a hundred li. He can't be just a Qi Cultivator... Even a Purple Mansion isn't capable of such a feat!" Yu Mugao exclaimed indignantly.

"That's enough!" Yu Xiaogui cut him off coldly, "Li Tongya isn't dumb. He could have gathered evidence but he chose not to. Although he decided not to pursue this matter and fall out with our family, this incident still marks the beginning of a rift between our families. From now on, we're not even apparent allies but enemies..."

"Father... I understand," Yu Mugao said, standing up straight and wiping away his tears. His expression hardened as he made a cold and steely declaration.

"This is the right time to eliminate An Jingming!"

Meanwhile, on the shore of Moongaze Lake...

Li Xuanfeng and Li Tongya flew in silence for a while before Li Tongya finally broke the silence.

"It's the Yu Family's doing."

Li Xuanfeng's expression darkened, a simmering anger evident as he clenched his teeth.

"I knew it was the Yu Family when I saw you disposing of the body. However, we probably can't confront them right now... If we didn't have that... we would have never known who had done this. Yu Mugao must have employed some insidious tactics to harm Xiu'er in this manner."

Li Tongya's voice turned cold as he spoke with finality in his tone.

"There's no need for further discussion on this matter. The truth will become clear once we return and investigate."

Li Tongya slowly sheathed his sword and continued, "This incident has stirred up quite a commotion... I suspect that everyone on the lake is already aware of it. If my guess is correct, Yu Xiaogui has likely arrived or is on his way to the scene. That was why I suggested that we leave first. Although he might not dare to fight us directly now, it was still better for us to leave quickly."

Li Xuanfeng's heart sank. Although everyone feared the Li Family because it was under the protection of a sword immortal, only members of the Li Family knew that this was merely a facade.

On the surface, the two families had not yet turned openly hostile, but in secret, they had already become enemies. No one knew for sure what would happen from now on...

"Should we... seek assistance from the Xiao Family?" Li Xuanfeng inquired in a low voice.

Li Tongya shook his head in response.

"We should wait until I attain the Foundation Establishment Realm. Besides, the Yu Family has the Yuanwu Peak backing them, and the Xiao Family is trying to lay low for now so they won't intervene in such matters. We'll reassess the situation when the Xiao Family makes their move. We can't always rely on others... we must rely on ourselves."

As they conversed, Moun Lijing loomed beneath them. People had gathered below, kneeling and crying. Li Xuanfeng's eyes welled with tears, unable to bear the sight.

Meanwhile, Li Tongya sighed softly, hovering in the sky above.

Upon arriving at Lijing Town, Li Xuanxuan landed before the collapsed rear hall. Flames were still licking at the wooden structure. Clan soldiers hurried over to him.

Li Xuanxuan swept his spiritual sense forward, allowing the scene beneath the ruins to materialize in his mind.

His face paled slightly as beads of sweat formed on his forehead. He turned his head to the side and asked, "Was the Young Family Head in the courtyard?"

The unconscious Li Pingyi had already been retrieved and taken away to be treated, while a trembling clan soldier stood before him. "Reporting to the Family Head, I saw him earlier... he should have been in the courtyard," he said, his voice timid.

Li Xuanxuan's chest tightened. His face paled and he could almost see stars before his eyes. He dropped onto his knees with a thud and cried out loudly.

"XIU'ER...!"

He continued sweeping the area with his spiritual sense but found only the remains of a few clan soldiers amidst the rubble, along with blood, dismembered body parts, and bone fragments.

There was no sign of Li Yuanxiu. He doubled over, feeling the world spin before his eyes as he wailed in agony.

Hearing the head of the family in such distress, the surrounding clan soldiers and cultivators were filled with horror, joining him and kneeling on the ground as well.

Li Xuanxuan clutched his chest as he struggled to catch his breath. Tears streamed down his face as he spoke through gritted teeth. "W-What... what has happened here..?"

A clan soldier rescued from the rubble kneeled and cried out in agony.

"It was the pearl! The pearl... it unleashed a spell!"

Beside him, Xu Gongming recoiled in shock and fear. It was he who had sent over the precious pearl from the mine to the courtyard.

His vision darkened, never expecting that he would become a suspect in this incident. He got down on his knees and stumbled forward.

"The precious pearl came from the mine! I-I will... go investigate this...!"

"From the mine..?" Li Xuanxuan's face darkened. The Ebony mine had been explored under the leadership of the An Family. Naturally, they were the prime suspects.

Li Xuanxuan let out a frustrated sigh before hissing resentfully, "Is the An Family out of their minds?!"

Despite his turmoil, Li Xuanxuan managed to compose himself. He wiped his tears away and barked a command, "Go and investigate this!"

As Xu Gongming scrambled to leave, Li Xuanxuan lowered his gaze to see Li Yuanjiao, who had already arrived before him. His cheeks were smeared with dirt for he had been searching among the rubble with tears streaming down his face, and they were still dripping from his chin.

Meanwhile, Li Qinghong cradled Li Yuanyun in her arms, both of them sobbing uncontrollably. Several clan elders were kneeling nearby, their aged faces stained with tears. The courtyard was silent, save for the sound of mournful weeping.
ùëìùò≥ùëíùëíùìåùò¶ùò£ùòØ‚Ñ¥ùë£ùò¶ùëô.ùò§ùëúùëö

The oppressive stillness was shattered when Li Tongya and Li Xuanfeng finally descended into the courtyard. Seeing Li Tongya, Li Xuanxuan's tears surged once more, and he spoke with indignation.

"Second Uncle! Xiu'er... he..."

Li Xuanfeng clenched his fists while Li Tongya sighed quietly and approached Li Xuanxuan.

"Come with me..." he said softly.

Li Xuanxuan nodded through clenched teeth, accompanying Li Tongya as they rode the wind toward the mountain.

Meanwhile, Li Xuanfeng stayed behind to investigate. When he finally pieced together the events, he spat angrily, "What a low move!"

As soon as he said that, the rapid sound of hoofbeats echoed nearby. Tian Zhongqing rode in on his horse, carrying a mystery person. He quickly dismounted and dropped the person to the ground, eliciting cries of pain from that person. He then addressed Li Xuanxuan with a respectful bow before speaking.

"My lord, the culprit has been captured. He's a spy from the An Family!"

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Meanwhile in the An Residence...

The An Family had just constructed an impressive, shimmery golden pavilion atop Mount Huazhong.

An Zheyan had commissioned the pavilion for his son, An Jingming, and it had complex formations engraved onto it. It was designed to harness spiritual qi and to stabilize one's soul.

An Jingming sat cross-legged alone within the golden formation, his handsome features illuminated by its soft glow. His long hair was tied back neatly, and he wore crystal-clear gold bracelets on his wrists. A jade ax stood before him, surrounded by a gentle white mist that seemed to lend him an aura of immortality.

An Jingming should have been deep in cultivation, but he was frequently distracted and was unable to immerse himself in his meditation.

Currently at the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, he was far ahead of his father, An Zheyan, in terms of cultivation. This fact filled An Zheyan with pride.

After sitting for a while, An Jingming found himself still unable to concentrate. After another half an hour, he finally rose to his feet, descended the stairs, and pushed open the door to a luxurious hall.

An Zheyan was seated inside, with a wine cup and a pair of silver chopsticks in each hand, watching as seven or eight dancers danced to a beautiful melody in front of him. He had a contented expression, and there was a smile on his lips.

He was just picking up a small piece of rabbit meat from the dish in front of him when he spotted An Jingming descending the stairs in his flowing Daoist robe.

An Zheyan hastily discarded his chopsticks and dismissed everyone in the hall hurriedly.

"Go away, all of you!"

The musicians and dancers quickly scattered as An Jingming approached.

"Did I disturb your meditation, son?" An Zheyan asked, looking somewhat guilty.

"Not at all, since the building has a soundproofing formation," An Jingming reassured his father, shaking his head.

He looked at his father for a moment before continuing, "I've been feeling restless today. Have I forgotten something important...?"

An Zheyan attempted to dispel his son's concerns with a hearty laugh.

"Nonsense, my boy... Don't worry yourself."

However, An Jingming, sharp as ever, sensed that something was aloof and fixed his father with a penetrating gaze.

"Father, you mustn't keep secrets from me! What are you hiding?!" he demanded with a slightly gloomy expression.
