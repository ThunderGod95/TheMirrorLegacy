# Chapter 686: Divine Power

"Divine power is the fruit of a vast Dao foundation. It is born from the immortal foundation, channeled from the Qihai, through the Shengyang acupoint, and past the infinite illusions of the Twelve-Storied Pagoda. When the Juque, Qihai, and Shengyang are all illuminated, the Shengyang 'mansion' ascends into the Great Void, severing the mortal coil and dispelling the world of forms."

Li Ximing sat cross-legged on the jade pillar, having centered his mind for six days. Several jade slips were arrayed before him. The Li family's collection of Daoist arts was not extensive, but most had been granted by the Immortal Mirror and were exceptionally profound, offering much to study and reference.

'The *Radiant Essence Scripture* describes the Purple Mansion as: "Fire rising in the heart, Yang and Ming manifesting inside and out."'

'The *Scripture of Heavenly Radiance and the Waning Sun* says: "Concealing the heart-fire, the sun sets in the southern brightness, ruling the world from a southern throne."'

'The *Golden Book of Divine Attendance* is more succinct, using only four words: "The ultimate transformation of things."'

These were all texts from the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. As Li Ximing prepared to make his own attempt at the Purple Mansion Realm, he had paid close attention to such information, even seeking out Kongheng to ask about it when he was still around.

Kongheng had described it from a Buddhist perspective: "When one's wishes are fulfilled, they achieve infinite light, instantly realize Maha, obtain divine power, and enter the realm of liberation. Wherever their transformations take them, they go with ease, and wherever they reside, they are constantly guarded."

Though each school had its own interpretation, the method for breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm was largely the same: forge the immortal foundation, propel it to the Shengyang acupoint, ascend the Twelve-Storied Pagoda, and pass through the boundless illusions.

It sounded simple, but the very first step—propelling the immortal foundation toward Shengyang—was enough to halt ninety percent of all cultivators.

Each Purple Mansion cultivation art had its own method, but once the immortal foundation left the Qihai acupoint and began its ascent, a cultivator’s entire power would surge. There was no turning back. Failure to break through meant instant death, with no chance of survival.

On its way up, the foundation had to first illuminate the Juque acupoint before entering Shengyang. If a cultivator's dharma power was insufficient, their immortal foundation of too low a grade, or their mastery of the Dao lacking, their energy would be consumed too quickly. They would burn out before even reaching Shengyang, and their life would be extinguished.

Years ago, Li Encheng and the others had rashly attempted their breakthrough after only a few years of seclusion. They had failed, their deaths marked only by a celestial phenomenon, having fallen at the very first hurdle.

'Those who perish at that stage have their cultivation scattered long before. The resulting celestial phenomenon, though vast, is as fleeting as smoke and leaves no precious spiritual treasures behind.'

If a cultivator successfully reached the Shengyang acupoint, they then had to manifest their divine power. The higher the grade of their immortal foundation, the more secret arts they had mastered, and the deeper their understanding of their own Dao, the easier this process would be. It was not a long stage, typically taking about six years.

This was the point where rogue cultivators and members of smaller clans were most likely to fail. Lacking the high-grade foundations, secret arts, and profound comprehension of their peers, they often met a swift end.

Finally, if one could manifest their divine power within Shengyang, they had to use that power to push the Shengyang 'mansion' into the Great Void. In the Immortal Dao, this was known as "severing the mortal coil and dispelling the world of forms." For Buddhist cultivators, it was "pushing Shengyang into the Pure Land to achieve the state of non-regression."

To enter the Great Void, one first had to pass through a state of primordial oblivion, a complete loss of self. One could be trapped there, adrift and unaware, for days or decades. Because the mortal coil was already severed, they would feel nothing, remaining stagnant until their lifespan ran out. The vast differences in time taken to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm stemmed from this stage.

Ning Wan and Yang Tianya were likely trapped at this point. While Ning Wan's situation was uncertain, rumors suggested Yang Tianya was nearing the end of his lifespan in this state, with no hope of escape.

By this point, a cultivator had achieved half the characteristics of the Purple Mansion Realm. If they were to perish now, the celestial phenomenon could blanket an entire region with a shower of spiritual treasures or trigger a natural disaster spanning several prefectures.

When the Yuan family's ancestor, Yuan Licheng, had failed his breakthrough, his death was widely lamented. The ensuing rain had covered several prefectures. Even with the Azure Pond Sect's intervention to prolong the phenomenon, the power of the event itself was undeniable.

Only after breaking through this state of oblivion could one face the infinite illusions. With their divine power in hand, the illusions would pass in an instant. Failure meant the complete dispersal of one's cultivation. Success meant they had truly arrived, and could emerge from seclusion as a Purple Mansion cultivator.

'That's how it is now. In ancient times, a cultivator also had to face the Three Calamities. After surviving those, members of the Thunder Palace would be waiting. One to drive the thunder, another to summon the clouds, they would call down Profound Thunder to punish past misdeeds. Even if you lived an honest life, you were bound to have hurt someone, and you would be made to suffer for it.'

He was fortunate that such tribulations were no longer a part of the process. Given his limited combat prowess, Li Ximing wasn't sure he would have survived.

Having sorted through the crucial steps, he put away the jade slips and retrieved a cinnabar brush from his storage pouch. Infusing it with his dharma power as ink, he watched as it began to glow.

'With the Radiant Violet Pill my master gave me, I shouldn't fail at the first stage,' he thought. 'If I do die, there should be a wealth of spiritual items.'

After a long moment of contemplation, he estimated what the aftermath of his death might look like. He casually set up a formation around the jade pillar, then stood beside it and began to write with a flourish.

"The walls of Great Desert City are crumbling, and gathering spiritual qi is difficult. Should I perish, a convergence of celestial light and swirling sands will fill this place with Radiant Origin. I have bound it with this formation for the benefit of future generations."

"Li family disciple, Ximing."

He put the brush away and flew to the top of the pillar. With two fingers, he lightly drew a circle on its surface.

Though the jade was of high quality, it wasn't particularly durable. The simple motion carved a shallow groove into the stone. Li Ximing blew away the dust and retrieved a small, golden-red ring from his sleeve.

The ring was about the thickness of his little finger, made of a material that was neither gold nor silver, and it glowed with a faint red light. He carefully placed it into the groove he had just carved.

It was the Sun-Gazing Ring.

He didn't know its material or grade, but it was an ancient artifact of Bright Yang, and he had taken it out specifically for his seclusion. Perhaps it would bring him good luck.

He let out a self-deprecating laugh and took out a black jade box. Placing it on the pillar, he opened it to reveal a white stone the size of a fingernail, glowing with a bright, ethereal light that seemed to shift like smoke and mist.

'The Radiant Sky Stone!'

This spiritual item was used for condensing one's divine power. He dared not look at it for too long. He then took out the Radiant Violet Pill, which bore five golden patterns, and placed it next to the box.

He swallowed a calming pill and settled onto a cushion at the base of the pillar. He let the surrounding light and shadow shift around him as he regulated his breath for three months. When he finally opened his eyes again, they were filled with nothing but tranquility.

*Hum.*

A pristine white jade bottle on the pillar's top leaped up and tilted, releasing a perfectly round pill.

Li Ximing enveloped the pill in his dharma power to prevent its medicinal properties from dissipating. But the Radiant Violet Pill was refined from multiple precious herbs. The moment it appeared, it shone with a dazzling brilliance, like a miniature sun rising, bathing the entirety of Mount Wu in light.

He swallowed the pill and felt a searing current rush into his Qihai.

His Qihai was already a roiling sea of bright dharma power, a world of gold and white. Amidst the surging white qi stood the Radiant Origin Pass, a majestic gate of white brick with exquisitely carved battlements. The seventy-two ridges on its corner towers shone brightly, like a gateway to the heavens, its base covered in dazzling patterns of light.

As the sun-like Purple Brightness Pill descended into his Qihai, a rain of Bright Yang power fell, instantly flooding the entire space and submerging everything in golden light.

*BOOM!*

Fortunately, the Radiant Origin Pass, an immortal foundation designed for suppression, reacted at once. As if provoked, the great gate leaped up from the sea of qi and pressed down on the miniature sun, containing its power and keeping the pill intact.

'Good.'

This saved him the effort of having to suppress it himself. With his Qihai now like a flash flood, Bright Yang power surged into his limbs and meridians. Ignoring the painful swelling in his body, he exhaled a torrent of celestial light and formed a seal with his hands.

"Ascend, immortal foundation!"

He activated the arts and incantations from his Purple Mansion cultivation method. The Radiant Origin Pass trembled in his Qihai, the Jewel Steps technique upon it shining ever brighter. Filled with a sense of great creation and joy, the immortal foundation transformed into a streak of golden light and shot upward, leaving the Qihai behind.

For an ordinary cultivator, the immortal foundation leaving the Qihai was a sign of impending death. Even with the cultivation art's incantations to stabilize it, his Qihai felt like it was deflating, its dharma power pouring out through the opening to propel the Radiant Origin Pass, rapidly thinning.

But as the Radiant Origin Pass moved, the suppressed Purple Brightness Pill flared back to life. A fresh rain of bright light fell, and his Qihai was once again brimming with vitality.

'Thank heavens for this precious pill!'

The Purple Brightness Pill was refined from two Bright Yang treasures and nearly a hundred other spiritual herbs of the same affinity. It was this immense power that kept his Qihai full. Without it, Li Ximing would already be drenched in sweat, burning his own life essence to push his immortal foundation upward.

With the pill's help, all he had to do was guide the foundation steadily on its course.

He calmed his mind, focusing his entire consciousness on the immortal foundation, oblivious to the changing light and darkness of the outside world. He didn't know how much time had passed when he finally saw a light before him, his immortal foundation having entered a vast, hazy space.

'The Juque Palace!'

The three keys to the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao were, from top to bottom, Shengyang, Juque, and Qihai. After the six spiritual wheels merged, the Juque became indistinct. From Qi Refinement to Foundation Establishment, the only one a cultivator could perceive was the Qihai.

*BOOM!*

The Bright Yang power from the Purple Brightness Pill found a new outlet, pouring into this vast space. The dharma power in his Qihai was rapidly drained, nearly half of it converging in the Juque Palace.

As the Radiant Origin Pass flew in, the haze before Li Ximing was illuminated by celestial light, revealing a landscape of pure white. The ground of the Juque Palace was covered in something like a blanket of snow, at the center of which stood a high platform.

And floating above that platform was a bright, perfectly round object.

'The Talisman Seed?!'

He had never imagined he would find it in his Juque Palace. He instinctively looked down at his Qihai.

The Purple Brightness Pill there had been mostly consumed, leaving only a thin layer of dharma power. At the bottom of his Qihai, the round, brilliant Talisman Seed lay quietly.

'There's one in the Qihai too? Are they the same?'

This was not the time for deep investigation. Without a moment to spare, he rested briefly before commanding the Radiant Origin Pass to leave the Juque Palace and continue its ascent.

Now, without the aid of the Purple Brightness Pill, he was raising the immortal foundation on his own. It felt like carrying a heavy bronze cauldron. Cold sweat immediately beaded on his brow, and a chill ran down his spine.

Even so, he was far better off than most. His starting point had been the Juque, not the Qihai. A cultivator like Chi Zhiyun would likely have another one or two pills similar to the Radiant Violet Pill to consume, pushing them all the way to Shengyang in one go.

It wasn't that he didn't have other pills, but if he lost focus for even a moment, the immortal foundation would begin to fall. The energy from an ordinary pill wouldn't even compensate for the loss from that momentary lapse. He estimated he would need something at the level of a treasure herb.

'My family doesn't lack treasure herbs… but no one has ever broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm before. No one knows the details of what's required.'

Beads of cold sweat dripped from his face. This part of the journey was far more grueling than the first. The path was treacherous, the Twelve-Storied Pagoda like twelve steps that he had to climb while carrying the immense weight. The pressure was so intense that blood began to seep from his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.

After what felt like an eternity, his vision went black. Then, finally, a faint light appeared ahead, revealing a small mansion floating on a sea.

The water was a clear, green, dotted with lotus blossoms. Twelve white bridges spanned the shores, and a white light shone in the sky. Looking closer, he saw that the sun illuminating this realm was the Talisman Seed.

'So there's one in the Shengyang Mansion too! That makes sense… the three mansions are a vital secret of cultivation. How could one be favored over the others?'

Before he could take a closer look, the Radiant Origin Pass plunged into the mansion, causing the sea to churn violently and overturn several lotus flowers. A wave of dizziness washed over him, and he couldn't stop himself from spitting out a mouthful of blood.

"Pah!"

He quickly swallowed the rest of the blood. He knew he was badly injured, but his heart was filled with elation.

'I finally made it!'

Thanks to the Radiant Violet Pill, he had only suffered a heavy injury, far from the point of utter exhaustion. He focused his mind, gathered his remaining dharma power, and formed a new seal with his hands, setting the Radiant Origin Pass within the Shengyang Mansion.

The light from his foundation warmed his mind, and his spiritual sense felt wonderfully comfortable. His body, however, was in stark contrast—as weak as a mortal's, as if it might collapse at any second.

He dared not delay. While the Radiant Origin Pass was stable and required little effort to maintain, he forced his eyelids open.

His vision was dim, and he could see nothing clearly. He used his spiritual sense to guide his hand, using his last bit of power to open the jade box. The thumb-sized white stone flew out and gently attached itself to the center of his brow.

The Radiant Sky Stone immediately came to life. It squirmed like an insect, its surface covered in tiny, fine scales. It burrowed into his forehead, breaking the skin and entering his Shengyang Mansion.

The Radiant Origin Pass was still suspended in mid-air when the Radiant Sky Stone flew in. The Pass immediately descended, its seventy-two corner ridges glowing brightly, bathing the space in dazzling light.

"...Sensing the seventy-two profound attributes of Bright Yang, today I seek the inner from the outer, seek life from nature. May the thousand divine officials all come to my aid. May the divine light shine within, bringing clarity and spiritual grace. May the five decays and five calamities be melted away by this..."

He chanted the incantation, and the Radiant Origin Pass in the sky began to tremble violently.

"May old age, sickness, and death no longer touch me. May my nature and life be eternal, and may my vow be everlasting!"

The Radiant Origin Pass shook more and more fiercely. A vast torrent of white qi flowed down like water. Two golden, hollowed-out lanterns on its corner towers lit up, and a radiant staircase appeared, each step igniting in sequence.

The Radiant Sky Stone evaporated like white steam, its essence pouring into the immortal foundation. Li Ximing's mind was filled with an endless, brilliant light as he cycled through one set of incantations and hand seals after another.

After an unknown amount of time, he vaguely saw a white qilin leaping through the world and heard the cry of a white cicada. The celestial gate shattered, its white bricks crumbling like broken tiles. From its center, a rainbow-colored light emerged, flowing and dancing in the air.

A wave of exhaustion washed over Li Ximing's mind. The primordial oblivion enveloped his consciousness, a hazy state between waking and sleeping. His vision turned to gray.

Everything in the Shengyang Mansion froze. The sea no longer rippled, the lotuses stopped blooming, and the rainbow light solidified in place. All movement ceased.

But the sun in the sky paused for a moment, then cast down a beam of light as cool and clear as water.
