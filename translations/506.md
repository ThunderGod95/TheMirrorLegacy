# Chapter 761: Old Acquaintance

Lijing Town.

Lijing Town was now the largest town by the lake; it even surpassed Milin Town at the center of Milin Prefecture. The area had been ravaged beyond recognition, and since the Li Family no longer acknowledged the Milin prefectural system, they had divided the region into several towns for separate governance. Now that the population was spread out, none of the other towns could compare to Lijing Town.

The restaurant was bustling with noise. People moved up and down the pale red wooden steps, while a monk sat alone at the highest level. His head was cleanly shaven and his eyes were quietly fixed on his wine cup.

Those who dined and drank in this place were not ordinary folk; most were scions of prestigious families. Several guests kept anxiously glancing over, unease in their hearts. After a quarter of an hour, they hastily ended their banquets and scattered in all directions.

Soon, the upper level of the restaurant was deserted, and even passersby grew sparse. Cultivators in white armor began appearing among the thinning crowd. Li Chenghuai arrived with his men and ascended the stairs without hesitation.

Since the Li Family was currently undergoing many personnel changes, there were numerous vacancies. As both his cultivation and age had reached the necessary threshold, Li Chenghuai now served under his cousin Li Chengliao. As the direct son of Li Xizhi, he was someone Li Chengliao frequently relied upon.

But just as he entered the building, he was promptly stopped by a middle-aged man in white robes. The man had a rather handsome face and had the calm demeanor of someone in his middle years.

An Siwei’s presence was imposing, and his expression was serious as he spoke softly, "You are of the Qingdu bloodline, Young Master. It's not appropriate for you to go in person. Allow me to meet him instead."

Chen Yang stood behind An Siwei, dressed in black, his brows slightly close-set and his eyes flickering with unease and suspicion. Li Chenghuai clasped his hands in acknowledgment and nodded, letting the two of them proceed.

When they climbed the crimson steps, they saw the monk still seated at the table, which was now filled with fine wine and meats. It seemed he had gathered them from the hastily abandoned tables nearby. It was an awkward sight.

He didn’t eat. He only poked at the food with his chopsticks and stared blankly into space.

When he saw the two approach, An Siwei clasped his hands and spoke in a soft tone, “Greetings, master. I am An Siwei of the Li Family... I wonder, master...”

The monk had slightly short eyebrows. Though his face was clean and bright, and his hair completely shaven, there was still a faint trace of a hardened, resolute air about him.

He gently tapped his jade chopsticks together and finally spoke, “An Siwei of the Li Family... Quite capable indeed...”

His voice was hoarse, carrying a hidden chill that did not show on the surface. An Siwei grew suspicious at his cryptic reply and asked, “Forgive my ignorance, master. I cannot grasp your Zen words. What do you mean...”

The monk poured himself a drink and replied quietly, “They once said Li Tongya and Li Xuanxuan were so ambitious that they seemed like wolves in human skin. I never believed it, but looking at the outcome now... perhaps it wasn’t so unbelievable after all.”

The wine let out a chime as it splashed into the jade cup. An Siwei could detect the disrespect in his words and felt displeased, replying curtly, “It seems this master has heard some rumors... but the times shift and the Mandate of Heaven changes hands. A single judgment cannot define the outcome.”

The monk let out a cold, dismissive laugh at the mention of the Mandate of Heaven and asked, “Who is An Jingming to you?”

An Siwei’s expression darkened at the question. After a moment, he replied, “He was my elder brother.”

A cold wind suddenly swept through the building as a young man in white robes appeared.

He raised his sword-like brows slightly. “I am Li Xijun. Greetings, Master Monk.”

Though the Li Family did not follow the Dao of Buddhism, they could still roughly judge a person’s strength. Li Xijun could feel the monk’s heavy and oppressive presence; he carried a clear sense of threat. A trace of wariness rose in his heart.

The monk remained seated, and replied hoarsely, “Xu Mu of the Five-Eyed Temple. Greetings, fellow cultivator.”

It’s him...

Li Xijun was familiar with the name. A few days ago, they had captured two people, and the old Daoist Fu Yuan of Mount Xiaoshi had clearly been influenced by the Five-Eyed Merciful One. It seemed this monk had deliberately released him to probe for information.

That monk’s name had been mentioned, and it was indeed Xu Mu.

Li Xijun spoke with a faintly cold tone, “Master Monk, your methods are impressive indeed. Borrowing the bodies of cultivators to spy upon others...”

Xu Mu waved his hand dismissively and replied calmly, “A mere trick, nothing more.”

He stared at Li Xijun’s brows and eyes for a moment, as if trying to recall something, then spoke, “I once entrusted something to your esteemed family. I wish to meet Li Xuanxuan... Is he still alive?”

Li Xijun remained silent for a moment, then gestured to An Siwei, who quickly departed toward Qingdu.

Master Monk Xu Mu pointed to the seat opposite him and smiled, “Xijun, please have a seat for now.”

He continued, “Even in the North, I heard of Li Tongya. He did great things... Such a pity that he fell in the end. Grudges and debts, aren’t they all meaningless in the end?”

Li Xijun stayed guarded, wary of any hidden intent in his words, and chose not to reply. Xu Mu, undisturbed, pulled a copper sword from his sleeve.

Its cold gleam illuminated his face as he spoke softly, “In our youth, he and I once crossed blades. Back then, I still had a worldly name.”

He flipped the sword over and said in a quiet voice, “Yu Mujian.”

At that moment, the restaurant fell utterly silent. It was so quiet one could hear a pin drop. The atmosphere turned eerie. Chen Yang stood to the side, every hair on his body standing on end. It felt as if he were balanced on the edge of a blade, caught between advancing and retreating.

Li Xijun’s expression remained calm. He placed one hand on his sword and spoke softly, “So it’s you, senior.”

Xu Mu didn’t respond, and the atmosphere sank into heaviness once more.

Creak.

An old man hurried up the stairs. Li Xuanxuan was holding an axe-shaped dharma artifact that hadn’t been used in decades. His robe was slightly disheveled as he stared intently at the two figures.

Clang!

Li Xijun had already drawn his sword. The long blade angled toward the ground as he positioned himself protectively in front of the old man. His other hand had crushed a jade talisman, and his eyes were locked on the monk before him.

Xu Mu let out a sigh and replied, “It’s been a long time... Daoist Xuanxuan.”

“And you are...” Li Xuanxuan was stunned by the voice. He stared closely at the monk’s eyes and brows; there was something familiar about them. After searching his memory twice over, he finally matched them with a cultivator he once knew.

Shock surged through him, and his lips trembled slightly as he said, "You... you've actually returned!"

"The sharper the advance, the swifter the retreat. The strength of a blade lies in how it is concealed before it's drawn." Xu Mu sat quietly, his gaze fixed on the copper sword. The cold, radiant gleam cast a pale light on his clean, white face.

He said hoarsely, "In my youth, I wielded my edge recklessly, left my family in anger, went to the northern frontiers, slew devil cultivators, honed my swordsmanship, walked thousands of miles on foot, and crossed the Taihang.

"I poured all my emotion into the sword and cast everything else into emptiness. Now, looking back at the past hundred years, my eldest brother perished, consumed by endless schemes. Our family was extinguished. My second brother sacrificed himself to stop a formidable foe, burning to death when his cover was blown. My youngest brother sought immortality to survive, only to be slain by our enemies..."

At that moment, hair slowly began to grow atop Xu Mu’s head, and his body grew broader and more imposing. He looked more and more like his prime. Yet his eyes never left the sword in his hand.

"I, Xu Mu, have pondered what Senior Tongya once said for many years. Now that I believe I am ready... I’ve come back to reclaim my sword."

Crack.

Heavy white mist burst from all five of his orifices, sweeping through the restaurant. Buds sprouted from the wooden stairs only to quickly rot away. The steamed chicken on the table twitched twice, grew feathers, cried out twice within the white mist, and crumbled into dust.

Li Xijun drew his sword and swept the white mist rushing toward them aside. He then lifted both companions and sent them outside the restaurant in the same breath. Chen Yang, being farther away, was merely brushed by the edge of the mist. A few threads from his gray robe’s hem drifted loose and fell.

White mist surged out with each breath Yu Mujian exhaled. Though it stopped flowing from his five orifices, it still billowed from beneath his robes.

He spoke coldly, “I wonder how much of Li Tongya’s true teachings you’ve inherited, Xijun.”

Li Xijun sheathed his sword and formed a seal with one hand, suppressing the surging mist. He replied calmly, “There are many mortals here. Master Monk, please take this duel with me to the lake.”

Yu Mujian narrowed his eyes slightly, drew his sword, and stepped forward. He vanished and reappeared over the lake in an instant. Li Xijun followed a step behind, his figure also appearing above the water as snow began to fall from the sky.

Yu Mujian reversed the copper sword and rested it at his waist. The blade was thick, rounded, and dull-edged, but it glowed with a dim yellow hue. White mist surged toward it, gathering into a swirling, flowing mass.

He spoke, “This sword is called Copper Cache. It was forged from copper mined in Yan Mountain, quenched in waters from Piaoming Mountain of the Northern Sea, and tempered with the fires of Mount Cituo in Yinghua Prefecture...”

Li Xijun’s sword-like brows lowered slightly as he watched closely, a hint of weight pressing on his heart, That sword is indeed unusual... I wonder if I can match it. Mount Qingdu is protected by a Foundation Establishment Realm formation. No matter how mad he gets, the younger ones should be safe.

Pressing his hand against his sword, Li Xijun remained motionless and responded, “The name of my sword is Han Lin.”

Without warning, Yu Mujian unsheathed his blade. The white mist immediately surged like waves and stretched out over the lake like a curtain. The gleam of frost was like sharp blades as it crackled and hissed with immense power and weight.

The white blade flew across the lake. It seemed slow, yet it was incomparably fast. The mist churned the waters into a frenzy and suffocated the hearts of all who felt its pressure.

Li Xijun immediately released the technique he had long prepared, Slaughter Jun Kui Light. He pressed two fingers together, and dozens of streaks of white energy erupted outward. The shimmering light rippled, transforming into cold snow as fine as pine needles. It was carried on the wind, converging into a single stream that rushed toward the white mist.

But Li Xijun wasted no time. The moment he finished casting the spell, he leapt into the air, drawing his slender sword, which flared with a fierce, snow-white radiance. Though the area around him had been swept clean by the impact, flakes of snow began to fall once more.

The Celestial Moon Slash blazed bright for an instant, carving a path through the surging, wave-like white mist. Yu Mujian saw it clearly, excitement flickering in his eyes. He stepped forward and swung his sword once again.

Just then, a sudden brilliance lit up the sky above. Blinding light poured down, making Yu Mujian’s heart skip a beat. That radiance condensed into white stone bricks that interlocked together to form a massive fortress gate in the air.

“Who dares trespass?! Such gall!”

The gate towered high, its white stone pillars etched with countless mysterious runes and shamanic curses. A young man in Daoist robes stood atop the structure, and shouted in a mix of shock and fury.

Yu Mujian had to raise his head and draw his sword. Dazzling light shimmered like a scorching sun within the gate’s archway, burning away the white mist and searing the skin on his face.

Li Ximing was indeed both startled and enraged. He had been in secluded cultivation for years, well aware of how thin their family had been stretched by Azure Pond Sect’s conscription. So he occasionally kept watch, and Li Xijun had long prepared methods to summon him if needed.

Now, for the first time, Li Xijun’s summoning method had awoken him. He had rushed out only to see white mist churning over the lake and a buddhist cultivator drawing his sword on his younger brother. Fury ignited within him, and a deadly intent surged forth.

He mobilized the vast reserves of his qi sea without hesitation, unleashing his cultivation without concern for depletion. Each white stone within the Radiant Origin Pass began to glow. The blinding white at its center shone with searing intensity. Yu Mujian, suddenly under attack, remained calm and simply reached out.

He pulled a long cloth from his sleeve and gave it a shake in midair. A flurry of golden runes fell out like tadpoles, floating eerily in the air before assembling into a golden barrier that shielded him completely.

The techniques of buddhist cultivators were often difficult to read. Li Ximing couldn’t immediately tell if this was a dharma artifact or a spell. With a single thought, he sent the Radiant Origin Pass crashing downward.

Boom!

The brilliant white fortress gate slammed down with a thunderous crash. Yu Mujian dodged twice but couldn’t evade entirely. The Radiant Origin Pass slammed directly onto the golden barrier. Light and light collided, releasing a hiss of white mist as suppression forces surged.

Meanwhile, Li Xijun had already broken free from the white mist. He stirred a swirl of brilliant snow into motion and flicked his long sword upward, sending three nimble, cunning streaks of white light into the mist.

Yu Mujian had only just managed to resist Li Ximing’s radiant pass. The runes on his body rang out with a metallic clang. Only then could he free a hand to withstand the force. Halfway through a spell seal, he had to frown and halt.

He swept away the white mist in front of him with his sleeve, and caught a streak of flowing light between his fingers. The white sword light writhed violently in his grip, letting out harsh, grating screeches.

Before he could react further, his other hand flicked out, capturing another streak. Only then did he have the chance to draw the copper sword at his waist. A surge of white mist burst out, forcing both streaks of light away.

The first streak of white light had left a small puncture on the back of his hand, yet Yu Mujian didn’t seem to care. He casually wiped it, sealing the bleeding hole with ease.

“Good!” Rather than anger, joy filled his face. His eyes lit up with a mix of surprise and delight at the sword technique. He sighed in admiration, “What a marvelous sword technique! What an ingenious method! So free of convention, as if it was born from the Outer Heavens... But you’ve yet to grasp its true essence. If the creator themself had wielded it, those three streaks of light might have left me spinning helplessly!”

He continued murmuring in joy, but the strain of the battle was causing the golden glow surrounding him to flicker. The Radiant Origin Pass specialized in suppression and erosion; it was capable of grinding gold to dust in mere moments. Its power was not to be underestimated.

Though Li Ximing didn’t possess many impressive combat techniques or experience, the cultivation method he used was a solid fifth-grade one. When he unleashed his late Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation to its fullest, his ability to suppress Immortal Foundations rivaled even the elite descendants of the Three Sects. Even Yu Mujian had to momentarily rein in his wandering thoughts and showed a hint of surprise.

He knew his own limitations. That golden rune barrier was no ordinary spell; it was one of Five-Eyed Temple’s top techniques, and one he had honed for decades. The spell was normally unshakable by Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, yet it was already buckling after only a few breaths under this pressure.

He freed one hand, emitting white light, using it to prop up the Radiant Origin Pass. With the other, he pulled out a golden talisman and began casting, chanting, “Empty Prison Case, All Sentiments Revealed...”

After chanting the spell, he strained with the hand supporting the Radiant Origin Pass and gave the gate a symbolic jolt. Then, he lightly stepped to the side, slipping out from beneath it and appearing ten steps away.

The golden barrier around him brightened swiftly, gradually returning to its full radiance. Yet behind him, snow suddenly began to fall. The snowflakes drifted sideways in unison by an inch, revealing a streak of piercing white brilliance. An icy, radiant sword light streaked through the air, aimed straight at his back.
