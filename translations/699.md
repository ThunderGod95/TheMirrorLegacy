# Chapter 699: Gao Xuanzi

On Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

Li Ximing paused, his hand resting on the jade box. He tapped it lightly and looked at the old man before him, his tone sincere.

"Since our families share such a bond, I must ask—what plans have you made for the future? Please, tell me what you can."

Li Ximing didn't believe for a moment that Daoist Master Changxi was seeking help on a whim. 'His lifespan is nearly at its end. He must have been making arrangements for decades. He certainly has a few cards left to play… and in his original plans, I was never a factor.'

Since the Profound Peak Gate was asking for the Li clan's aid, Li Ximing could not ignore their history. But he needed to understand the situation clearly. At his question, Changxi’s expression turned serious, and he let out a long sigh.

"I won't hide it from you, Zhaojing. My Profound Peak Gate… we migrated from Jiangbei. We don't belong to the Green Pine lineage, nor are we affiliated with any of the ancient Immortal Mansions. As a result, we've faced much prejudice in Jiangnan over the centuries. I’ve relied on my reputation alone to keep us afloat. In truth, there are very few I can call on for aid."

"Now that my time is short, even fewer are willing to lend a hand. Over the past century, I have managed to secure the help of two parties."

"The first is a Purple Mansion sect in the eastern reaches of Jiangbei, east of the Chengyun Gate. It is called the Xuanmiao Temple, presided over by an Elder Daoist Master Qi, whose title is Sumian."

Li Ximing recognized the name. In the last decade, two Purple Mansion cultivators had returned from overseas, establishing two new sects in Jiangbei. One was the White Ye Immortal Sect, and the other was this Xuanmiao Temple.

Seeing Li Ximing’s recognition, Changxi continued, "The second is an overseas mountain called Mount Jingyi. Its master, Daoist Master Xuanyi, has taken a direct descendant of my clan as a disciple."

"I have a few other minor arrangements, but they are hardly worth mentioning, lest I make a fool of myself. Perhaps one day I can arrange an introduction for you…"

Changxi was not close enough to Li Ximing to reveal all his cards, and a general understanding was enough for Li Ximing. He had no desire to meet these allies just yet. Who knew what kind of sects the Xuanmiao Temple and Mount Jingyi were? The Xuanmiao Temple was located right next to the Chengyun Gate—was there friction between them? If other Purple Mansion masters misunderstood his intentions, he could find himself unwittingly drawn into some factional conflict.

"I must first visit the other clans to return their courtesy," he replied. "There is no rush to meet them."

Changxi stroked his beard. "It was I who was being inconsiderate."

Having come this far, Li Ximing hesitated, the earth-virtue dharma artifact warm in his hand. Finally, he asked the question that had been weighing on him.

"I've heard that you were once close with Situ Tang… is there any truth to this?"

The Li family's history was short, but their information network was effective. In the early days, the Kong family and the Situ family were connected by marriage, their relationship nearly as close as that of the Xiao and Li clans. And the Situ family was the Golden Tang Gate—now the Li clan's mortal enemy. How could Li Ximing not be wary?

Situ Ku was still imprisoned beneath Mount Qingdu. If his next move against the Golden Tang Gate ended up dragging in a host of Kong family members, and he had already agreed to protect them, he would be caught in an impossible situation.

His question made Changxi fall silent. The old man studied his expression and said in a low voice, "I won't hide it from you. In the early years, my family and the Situ family were indeed friends. Situ Tang, for all his arrogance, was generous and forthright with those close to him. He held most of the Jiangnan sects in contempt and was likewise ostracized by the Seven Gates. When I traveled around seeking allies, he was the only one willing to see me. We developed a friendship and even arranged a marriage alliance."

"But he was a reckless man who offended countless Purple Mansion cultivators. After his death, I dared not associate too closely with the Golden Tang Gate. The sect fell into internal strife. His sons, though highly talented—two of them even reached the Purple Mansion realm—all looked down on me, despite their outward politeness. Our ties gradually faded."

He understood the enmity between the Li clan and the Golden Tang Gate and had no intention of mediating. He only sought to clarify his position, even offering a quiet warning.

"All cultivators know that Situ Mo has the backing of the Golden Feather Sect. You must be careful, Zhaojing. The Golden Feather Sect has been dominant for three generations. Their power is unrivaled in the Yue State, and they have more Purple Mansion cultivators than they show… Be extremely cautious."

The last thing Changxi wanted was for Li Ximing to pick a fight with the Golden Tang Gate. The Profound Peak Gate was already in a precarious state; if the Li clan collapsed while trying to help, his own sect's fate would be even worse.

"Thank you for the reminder, Elder," Li Ximing said, nodding gravely. He weighed the situation for a moment. The mid-grade earth-virtue dharma artifact, the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, still sat on the table. He pushed it back toward Changxi.

"Senior Changxi, the bond between our families needs no further proof. If the Profound Peak Gate is in trouble, my Li clan will help. This artifact is too valuable. It is not right for me to accept it under these circumstances."

Changxi stroked his beard, a flicker of surprise in his eyes. "What do you mean, Zhaojing?"

Li Ximing thought for a moment before explaining. "Our families should support each other as allies on the same path. The Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger is a mid-grade Purple Mansion dharma artifact. You should keep it for now and see if you can use it to leverage greater support from other powers. It could alleviate some of the pressure you face. You don’t need to use it to win me over."

"If the time comes when your lifespan is truly at its end and you have no other options, then give it to me. It will strengthen my hand, and I will be better equipped to handle the pressure from all sides."

Daoist Master Changxi was stunned. He seemed not to have expected such a response. He was silent for several seconds before his voice grew thick with emotion. "All those years ago, Tingyun advised against… she said some things she shouldn't have. I am truly sorry, Zhaojing."

Li Ximing knew he was referring to when Kong Tingyun had advised Li Qinghong to give the Radiant Sky Stone to Li Zhouwei instead. He shook his head. "I am not blind to the bigger picture, Senior. It was because of her reminders that I understood Senior Tingyun's earnest intentions. Not to mention the years of support, or how she helped cover for my brother when he got into trouble in the Eastern Sea. I remember all of it."

When Li Xizhi had accidentally trespassed on the Dragon Clan's territory, it was Kong Tingyun who had stepped in, using Changxi's name as a deterrent to quell Chi Zhiyun’s murderous intent. In the end, only Kong Tingyun had ever truly treated the Li family with genuine kindness.

His words made Daoist Master Changxi understand that it was Kong Tingyun's friendship that held the greatest weight. He sighed. "Zhaojing… your clan truly acts with…"

Li Ximing couldn't bear to hear it. He feared the other Purple Mansion masters would label him with the high-minded title of a "righteous cultivator" only to use his clan for their own ends. He quickly cut him off with a smile.

"It is your own foresight in preparing multiple escape routes that gives my Li clan the courage to help. If the situation were so dire as to threaten our own foundation with imminent collapse, I would not dare make such a promise."

Changxi nodded silently. But he knew that if not for the Li clan's sterling reputation, he would never have dared to present the artifact in the first place. Any other Purple Mansion cultivator from the Eastern Sea would have graciously accepted it, then simply walked away after he died.

Changxi's expression grew solemn. He flicked his sleeve, releasing a curtain of earthen-yellow light that enveloped them. His tone shifted back to how it was at the beginning, no longer trying to flatter Li Ximing with the address of 'Daoist Friend.'

"Little Friend Ximing, I will be honest with you," he said in a low voice. "Within my sect, three cultivators at the peak of the Foundation Establishment realm are in seclusion."

"Three?"

Li Ximing was taken aback. Changxi's face had transformed into that of an old, white-haired man as he murmured, "The first is my great-grandson, Kong Haiying. I have kept his existence a secret, and he has been cultivating in seclusion since he was a boy, long before Tingyun. He entered seclusion with a Purple Mansion spiritual item, the Roaming Pass Treasured Earth. Although it's not a perfect match for our clan’s Fool's Mountain Chase, it's far better than what most have. He has been in seclusion for over forty years now—too long, otherwise he should have emerged before my time runs out."

"The second is a retainer of our family, Fu En. It was rumored he died overseas years ago, but he has been in secret seclusion for over twenty years. His chances of breaking through are not high; it is merely an attempt."

"The third is Tingyun. She has been in seclusion for fifteen or sixteen years. Her natural talent isn't high, and she was more of a long shot. Though her character is excellent, her understanding of the Dao is shallow. She had the lowest chance of them all. But unexpectedly, she had a fortuitous encounter within a grotto-heaven, and her chances of a breakthrough are now slightly higher than Fu En's."

A clever rabbit has three burrows, and Changxi had clearly made many preparations. Li Ximing now understood why the Profound Peak Gate had so few late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators—Changxi had been pushing them to attempt breakthroughs for years.

After a moment's consideration, Li Ximing felt a sense of relief. If Kong Haiying succeeded, the Li clan's timely aid would be a perfect gesture of support. A sudden realization dawned on him, and he smiled inwardly.

'What an old fox… He probably wasn't revealing this out of gratitude! Even if I had refused, he would have told me about Kong Haiying to tempt me.'

He gave a solemn nod of agreement. Changxi thanked him several times. Suddenly, Li Ximing’s ear twitched.

"My apologies, Elder," he said. "The other guests have arrived at the mountain. We shouldn't keep them waiting."

The two rose into the air on the wind, continuing their discussion in hushed tones as they flew toward the main assembly.

***

"The Purple Smoke Immortal Gate! Kong Yuzi has arrived!"

Li Jiangqian’s gaze swept across the attendees. Beside him, Si Tongyi looked up just as a woman in a yellow, feathered robe descended among the tables. Before he could get a good look, another announcement rang out.

"The Slaughter Jun Immortal Gate! Gao Xuanzi has arrived!"

This name made Si Tongyi narrow his eyes. A murmur of interest went through the crowd as everyone turned to look. A gust of cold air swept through, and snowflakes materialized in the clear sky as a young man appeared at the Slaughter Jun Gate's designated seats.

The young man wore dark blue robes pleated and embroidered with frost patterns, covered by a thick brocade cloak. Sword tassels were faintly visible at his waist, and the collar was trimmed with a circle of fine, snow-white fur that framed the elegant lines of his jaw.

His lips were pressed into a thin line, his skin a touch pale, and his eyebrows were sharp and defined. His eyes were a grayer shade than those of the Li clansmen, and they held an unusual, almost demonic allure, which he quickly masked with a faint smile.

"Hmph."

Li Zhouwei took a sip of tea, his golden pupils shifting slightly. The courtyard was abuzz with lively conversation, yet it seemed everyone was discreetly observing this Gao Xuanzi.

'I've never seen him before…'

'The Slaughter Jun Gate has such a figure among their core disciples?'

'He appears to be a sword cultivator…'

Gao Xuanzi sat down. He was the sole representative from the Slaughter Jun Gate, and the dozens of empty seats around him made his solitary presence stand out starkly among the other delegations.

He seemed unconcerned, however, simply stroking his jade cup as if familiarizing himself with its texture. His gaze traveled forward, meeting Li Zhouwei's from across the expanse.

Both appeared as young men. One with solemn golden eyes, clad in white and gold armor, majestic and imposing. The other with cool gray eyes and pale skin, dressed in elegant fur-trimmed robes, as serene as winter snow. Their gazes locked in the air.

Li Zhouwei's grip tightened on his cup. The man was, after all, a core disciple of the Slaughter Jun Gate. He offered a rare smile in acknowledgment. Gao Xuanzi returned the smile, his eyes filled with approval.

"Daoist Master Zhaojing… has arrived!"

With the representatives from the Three Sects and Seven Gates all present, Li Ximing finally appeared at the head of the assembly. The Purple Mansion masters raised their cups in unison, the core disciples bowed in respect, and the unaffiliated cultivators at the lowest tables prostrated themselves, a sea of bowing heads.

"Congratulations to the Daoist Master on achieving your divine ability!"

The cry shook the heavens, scattering the clouds above. Auspicious mists swirled in the sky. Li Ximing returned the salute, and as music filled the air, the spiritual banquet began.

Changxi had already returned to the Profound Peak Gate's seats. Li Ximing did a quick survey of the guests. Tianque of the Golden Feather Sect, an impatient man, strode forward with a female cultivator named Zhang Duanyan, holding a bluestone box.

The Golden Feather Sect was now the hegemon of the Yue State. Li Ximing rose to greet them, observing the etiquette of a junior.

Zhang Duanyan spoke respectfully, "The Golden Feather Sect presents the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier as a congratulatory gift to the Daoist Master!"

The stone box presumably held the artifact. Li Minggong stepped forward to accept it.

Tianque laughed heartily. "Zhaojing, you are an alchemist, after all. If you ever need any spirit herbs in the future, you must come to me. My Golden Feather Sect is rich in resources. I guarantee you will be satisfied."

Li Ximing naturally responded with polite pleasantries.

Tianque then added, "My sect possesses two Bright Yang dharma artifacts. If you have need of them, please send someone to retrieve them. It will save you the trouble of refining your own."

"I will remember that, junior that I am," Li Ximing replied cautiously.

Just as Tianque turned to leave, Hengli, dressed in his Li-Fire Daoist robes, flew over. Bi Yuzhuang, standing beside him, presented a jade bottle with a smile.

"The Hengzhu Sect offers a portion of Pure Feather Li-Fire to congratulate the Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing felt a touch of awkwardness. The animosity between Tianque and Hengli was common knowledge, and with the two of them here together, the air was thick with tension.

Hengli's voice was rough and booming. "Daoist Friend Zhaojing, there is no need for formalities between our sects! My clan has also studied the art of crafting Bright Yang artifacts. If you need anything, I will personally forge it for you!"

'They're putting me on the spot…'

Li Ximing shook his head inwardly. Tianque had spoken loudly on purpose, and not just Hengli, but nearly everyone present had heard him. Hengli's words were a direct challenge. He was a magnanimous and straightforward man, but also stubborn and ruthless when offended. Li Ximing smoothed things over diplomatically. Hengli clearly had no desire to linger and soon departed.

With those two gone, the rest were easier to handle. Changxi had already told him that the Sword Gate, the Xiukui Monastery, and the Purple Smoke Gate had sent Foundation Establishment cultivators. The representative from the Purple Smoke Gate was the next to approach.

"The Purple Smoke Gate presents the Tome of Adamant Flame Alchemy to congratulate the Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing nodded slightly and raised his cup. The female cultivator, Kong Yuzi, poured a cup of wine for her master and returned the gesture from the side, avoiding a direct address.

As Kong Yuzi hastily retreated, Li Ximing finally had a moment to observe the delegation from the Slaughter Jun Gate. He saw the young man, who likely cultivated a cold-type energy, and found it logical.

'Although Tu Longjian cultivates Molten Fire, the Slaughter Jun's main lineage is the cold energy of the Lesser Yin Dao… so this is not surprising. The young man certainly has an impressive bearing…'

Gao Xuanzi was smiling faintly, his gaze directed toward a nearby table. Li Ximing followed his line of sight and saw Li Xuanxuan, surrounded by a crowd of well-wishers. Music swirled around them as the old man laughed heartily, downing cup after cup of wine. It had been a hundred years since Li Ximing had seen him so carefree.

A smile touched Li Ximing's lips. He took a step forward and materialized at the empty tables of the Slaughter Jun Gate.

Gao Xuanzi immediately stood and clasped his hands in a salute. His eyes held an enigmatic glint, and his voice was a respectful murmur laced with a smile.

"Greetings, Daoist Master Zhaojing."
