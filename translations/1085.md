# Chapter 1085: The Disguise

The spiritual island of the Chunyi Dao Gate, known as Chunyi Island, was located in the Fenkuai Sea Region. Nestled among its mountains was the famous Seajade Peak. An old man in red robes paced the mountainside, his hands clasped behind his back. He waited for some time before a middle-aged sword cultivator finally descended from the heavens.

"Brother Ji'an!"

Hearing this, the old man quickly returned the courtesy and replied,

"Lingjiao…"

The sword cultivator nodded slightly in acknowledgment. His bearing was elegant, his refined features suggesting an exceptional pedigree. This was Daoist Master Fuxuan, a sword cultivator from the Chunyi Dao Gate who practiced the arts of the Supreme Yin.

The old man before him was none other than Daoist Master Ji'an, the one who had relinquished Mount Pai'er in the Northern Sea's Cang Prefecture. The two appeared to be old acquaintances, and the sword cultivator spoke with matching warmth.

"Old brother, your time cultivating on Dushan Island—how has it been?"

Daoist Master Ji'an stroked his beard and nodded.

"It's a valuable place, to be sure. Unfortunately, it has been used for far too long. Subsequent generations were unrestrained, drawing out too much of the baleful energies of metal, lightning, and fire. It's quite depleted now. Besides… its origins are a mystery."

A shadow crossed Fuxuan's features, and he shook his head.

"That island lies on the edge of the coastal waters, east of Chunyi. It wasn't large, initially. An ancestor granted it to a junior to seek a breakthrough and establish his family. But he later made some errors and was expelled from the sect. He took his clansmen and left, and the island was handed over to the Qu Clan."

"Who would have thought that the Qu Clan's new Daoist Master, having just broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, would die a violent, premature death? The Qu Clan had no choice but to become our vassals. After a hundred years, they finally produced a young master with great promise, only for him to perish in the recent turmoil. They've fallen on harder and harder times... which is why they now wish to invite you, my friend, to establish your own gate on Dushan Island. The earth veins there have been rising and expanding in recent years. It was once a fire island, but it has since gained energies of metal, stone, and lightning. And it's very close to Chunyi..."

Daoist Master Ji'an paced a few steps, hands clasped behind him. He understood perfectly. Accepting this island meant, in all likelihood, tying himself to the Chunyi Dao Gate's chariot. He remained silent in contemplation before finally speaking.

"I hope to be able to glimpse the 'Great Scripture of Radiance'!"

"I understand!"

Fuxuan started to lead him down the peak, but he suddenly felt the jade talisman in his sleeve grow warm. A sense of unease struck him. He quickly reassured his guest.

"Leave this matter to me. I will be sure to make inquiries with Ting Province!"

He then excused himself and hurried away, flying swiftly over the sea. Following the guidance of the jade talisman and a trail of azure blossoms drifting on the waves, he landed on a desolate reef cluster.

Sure enough, a man in azure robes stood there waiting, his hands behind his back and a smile on his face.

"Daoist Friend Xi… long time no see!"

Fuxuan looked utterly exasperated. He stepped forward and sighed.

"Chi Buzi… what kind of mischief are you up to this time?"

Xi Lingjiao and Chi Buzi were acquaintances, of a sort. They had shared some grievances in their youth, but the Chunyi Dao Gate's rules were strict. Even though a matter concerning an ancestral inheritance had forged a slight bond between them, Xi Lingjiao knew he shouldn't associate closely with this man.

"You fiend… You already knew my Venerable Daoist Master was attempting his breakthrough. You could have just ridden the winds, hidden in a cloud bank, watched from afar, and left when you had the chance. Why must you show yourself and stir up trouble?"

Chi Buzi's smile faltered.

"What kind of reasoning is that? How could I, Chi Buzi, be the sort of person to sneak around, uninvited?"

Fuxuan gave him a peculiar look, staring fixedly.

"Haha." Chi Buzi laughed twice, then his expression turned serious. "I'm not here to cause trouble for you. I want to meet Li Ximing of Ting Province. I can never seem to find the right opportunity on a normal day."

Fuxuan immediately misunderstood, his face hardening.

"Today is the day of my Honored Master's breakthrough! You had better think very carefully about what you're doing!"

"Lingjiao, you misunderstand!" Chi Buzi shook his head, letting out a laugh. 

"Do I look like someone who would seek revenge for those few relatives of mine? Even if Chi Wei himself returned from the dead, I'd run him through without hesitation if he blocked my Dao path. I simply have important business to discuss with Li Ximing."

"His clan holds some... misunderstandings about me. I'm afraid he'll turn and flee the moment he sees me, which would just cause unnecessary complications."

The sword cultivator pressed his lips together.

"That's probably a mess of your own making."

Chi Buzi was thick-skinned. His expression unchanged, he simply smiled and stepped closer.

"Isn't that why I've come to ask you, brother? Just let me onto the island. Find a place for me... so I can meet him."

Fuxuan was no pedant; in fact, he was known as one of the most open-minded Daoist Masters in the Chunyi Dao Gate. Still, the request gave him a headache. 

"It's not that I mean to slight you, but this is a public event. My Honored Master is personally presiding. If he takes issue with your presence, this will not end cleanly!"

But Chi Buzi just sneered.

"You needn't worry. Just go and report it. Your master's heart is like a clear mirror; he won't make things difficult for you. Besides, the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition is here, and even people from the Changhuai Daoist tradition and Cultivation Transcendence have come. How could Azure Pond not be represented?"

Fuxuan knew he had to report it. Shaking his head in resignation, he led Chi Buzi back toward the peak. Chi Buzi waited on a nearby islet, standing with his hands behind his back, gazing into the far west.

He, Chi Buzi, had traveled far and wide recently, searching all the way from the Northern Sea to the Southern Sea, investigating several Ancient Daoist Traditions.

'It's difficult to ask about the great one directly, but inquiring about the Fox-kin isn't hard at all.'

He had gathered a significant amount of information. Standing with his hands clasped behind him, his mind was already turning.

'This Fox clan... they truly are inextricably linked to the Immortal Mansion. I heard that the old ancestor of the Fox clan—that old Demon who perfected its divine ability countless years ago—was personally enlightened by an Immortal Mansion cultivator!'

'This so-called Immortal Mansion cultivator... could it be the one with the Daoist title Xuan'an?'

'But the more sensitive information... concerns that *other* Immortal Mansion cultivator, Li Jiangqun. If that's the case, why would Xuan'an completely ignore Li Jiangqun?'

Chi Buzi knew a fair bit about that affair, and his suspicion deepened.

'By that logic, the source of Li Chejing's Supreme Yin Moon Radiance must be compromised. It almost certainly came from the master of the Fox-kin... who must be Xuan'an, the power behind the Li Clan.'

'And since all of Xuan'an's schemes are hidden beneath the cover of the Dragon-kin, it's almost certain the two sides are secretly in league.'

Every word Dingjiao had spoken back then was precious to him, worth savoring and dissecting. The most important, of course, was the mention of Moongaze Lake.

'"Guidance upon Moongaze Lake..." "...went to Moongaze Lake and then roamed free beyond the seas..."'

Those were Dingjiao's exact words! And yet... Chi Buzi's own memory of his time on the lake was a complete blank. If he wanted to recover that missing piece, he would have to involve the Li Clan.

'More importantly, I must convey the Dragon-kin's stance—or at least, my arrangements with the Dragon-kin—back to that 'Lord'. He surely knows already, but I must make a full show of my loyalty. Better still if I can reach a tacit understanding with the Li family in the process.'

He stood with his hands clasped, his expression distant and shadowed.

'I just fear Li Ximing won't believe me.'

The azure-robed man waited a while longer. When the sword cultivator finally returned to fetch him, Fuxuan's expression was indeed strange, a look of complete surprise on his face.

"This way, please!"

Chi Buzi immediately stepped onto his Verdant Cloud and flew toward the island, grinning. When they reached the summit of Seajade Peak, he glanced into the Great Void and saw it shimmering with multicolored light.

"I haven't seen a spectacle this lively in many years."

Fuxuan led him onto the peak but clearly had no desire to speak with him, pretending not to hear the comment. As they entered the main grove, he warned him one last time.

"Do not cause a disturbance!"

Mist and clouds coiled through the mountain grove. A Daoist Master in white-gold robes stood within a pavilion, discussing important matters with a frown.

Li Ximing had brought Li Que'wan and Li Jiangchun along, intending to let them mingle with the juniors from the various Dao lineages. He had just seen them settled in the grove when he was pulled aside by Chen Yin upon reaching the summit.

Though it had only been a few years, Daoist Master Yushui was completely transformed. The sword cultivator, once gentle and possessing a strength that defied his age, was now white-haired and ravaged by grief. A cold light filled his eyes as he stood silently in the pavilion, his grim aura making one shudder.

The death of Chen Xuanyu had clearly dealt him a staggering blow, one so great it even took Li Ximing aback. He could only steady the older man.

"Venerable Master… my condolences."

Seeing Li Ximing, Chen Yin managed to force a slight smile.

"Congratulations on achieving the Life Divine Ability, Zhaojing. You must forgive my current state."

Li Ximing could only sigh in silence. Chen Yin didn't hesitate, his voice devoid of emotion.

"I hear the Song Emperor is selecting candidates to become a Holder of the Profound in the north. Are you aware of this, Zhaojing?"

Li Ximing had heard rumors, so he nodded. The old man cut straight to the chase.

"My clan has a junior named Wenyao. He is also a good friend of Jiangliang. The Li Clan has considerable influence in the Song Court. This position... I hope you can secure it for my family. Name any compensation you require, Ximing. Just ask."

Li Ximing understood. The old man made no effort to be subtle, raising the azure blade in his hand.

"You know that I sold my family's fortune in exchange for this spiritual sword, Ximing, but do not worry that I have nothing left to offer. Xuanyu was a peerless talent, a genius of our family's Way of the Sword not seen in three centuries. This spiritual blade was meant for him. Now that he has been murdered... our lineage is broken. Only Wenyao remains as a sliver of hope. I... I have little use for this anymore."

Li Ximing's heart grew heavy at his words.

"Senior, there is no need for this. In my clan, only Jianglong has any prospects for such a thing, but he currently serves under the Great General. You should be petitioning the correct channels."

Chen Yin was a sharp man and understood the hint. He nodded grimly.

"Many thanks for the guidance."

He sheathed his azure blade and walked away, his retreating figure the very picture of desolation. Li Ximing mulled over the man's rare 'commodity' for a moment. Just then, he saw Fuxuan approaching and smiled.

"Greetings, Senior Fuxuan!"

Fuxuan returned a polite smile.

"I have someone to introduce to you, Ximing."

In that instant, the Great Void trembled and an azure light flared. Li Ximing looked up—and froze.

A man in azure robes was strolling through the grove. He had long, flowing hair, azure robes, and startling green eyes. A small, exquisite bronze tripod hung from his waist, and he toyed with a string of black jade beads. He looked every bit the transcendent, otherworldly cultivator.

But Li Ximing's pupils constricted in an instant.

"Bu... zi!"

His first instinct was to bolt. He was already half a step into his escape, but fearing an ambush in the Great Void, he forced himself to stop. His Immortal Mirror activated instantly as he snapped,

"Senior, what is the meaning of this?!"

Fuxuan flushed with embarrassment at the outburst, inwardly cursing Chi Buzi's name. But the deed was done. He could only step forward and hurriedly try to smooth things over.

"Zhaojing, please! This fi... Daoist Friend Buzi has come in goodwill!"

Li Ximing's Immortal Mirror swept the area, already mapping an escape route through the Great Void. He instantly confirmed that Chi Buzi wasn't, in fact, here to kill him. He let out a silent breath of relief, but as his gaze focused on the man, his heart leaped into his throat.

Within the vision of the Immortal Mirror, the man was shrouded in a faint, illusory, multicolored light!

He spoke coldly, simultaneously retracting his Spirit Probe and schooling his features to hide his shock.

"What is there for me to discuss with... *him*?"

Fuxuan's embarrassment intensified. He was already cursing Chi Buzi internally. 'This fiend... usually he can talk the heavens down, a veritable silver-tongued devil. Now he doesn't dare squeak!'

But Chi Buzi was fully focused, carefully observing Li Ximing's expression. Only then did he offer a bow and smile.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, you needn't worry. If I cared a whit about Azure Pond, I would have become their pawn long ago. Do you think you could have avoided me so easily if I had?"

"But I have much to discuss with Ting Province. I have already crossed the threshold of the Purple Mystery and now seek only perfection. There is great potential for cooperation with King Wei. Even if you won't consider it for your own sake, Zhaojing, you should at least consider it for King Wei!"

He stood with his hands clasped, supremely confident, staring fixedly at Li Ximing. He watched as the man in the white-gold robes replied with a grim face and a cold voice,

"You know exactly what 'good deeds' you've done!"

Li Ximing appeared utterly resistant, his expression brimming with hatred. And yet, his mind flashed back to the past—to how miserable Chi Buzi had been on the lake, to the exact words he had spoken. He knew it all. What made him pause wasn't the strange light around the man, and it certainly wasn't the talk of King Wei. It was the memory of Chi Buzi from that day, the clear abnormality of his spiritual soul.

'This Chi Buzi... he is the only Purple Mansion Realm cultivator without talismanic protection to have ever looked directly at an Immortal Artifact!'

Chi Buzi was sharp. He heard the probe in Li Ximing's words loud and clear. He stepped forward, his voice turning cold.

"I know exactly what I've done. What are you going to do about it?"

His face was a natural mask, concealing a cold, unscrupulous heart. Though he was bluffing, he delivered the words with such crisp, arrogant certainty that it gave one pause.

Li Ximing fell silent, regarding him with cold eyes.

'Venerable Daoist Master Yuanshang is about to break through. There's no telling how many powerful entities are watching. This is no place for such a conversation!'

But Chi Buzi had already closed the distance. His eyes narrowed, and he spoke in a low, level voice.

"Have you already forgotten whose world this is? Have you forgotten how Li Jiangqun perished on that lake?"

Li Ximing watched him take a seat, perfectly at ease, and replied, "Then perhaps the Great Daoist Master can enlighten me."

Chi Buzi's gaze was distant.

"Back then, Li Jiangqun became a Form and Shadow... one formed from the great Supreme Yin Six Wheels. He possessed a Moon-Glaze body and walked the lands of Jiangnan. Though his spiritual sense was limited, he could steal treasures from Chi Wei, but they were captured back by him with a simple divination. He was a supreme-tier Profound Body!"

He spoke of Chi Wei as if discussing a complete stranger, his tone flat and without a ripple.

"Chi Wei mentioned that, more terrifyingly, the Profound Body was imbued with all manner of hidden arts. This type of divine ability required the Profound Body to experience the mortal world, cultivating the true path step-by-step. Li Jiangqun had secretly embedded a Karma-Drawing Heavenly Light Talisman within it. The moment that vessel shattered, it would instantly summon the Supreme Yin Profound Light to annihilate both spirit and form."

Hearing this, Li Ximing's heart trembled as if the sky were falling.

'Supreme Yin Profound Light!'

'Is it a coincidence, or is it the very same thing? The exact same name... Supreme Yin Profound Light!'

A secret the Li Clan had guarded for a hundred years had just been uttered as if it were nothing. Li Ximing was shaken to his core. Chi Buzi continued quietly,

"With such a profound technique at play, the other Purple Mansion Realm masters didn't dare touch that karma. They certainly wouldn't allow him to perfect that divine ability and become a true Profound Body of the Purple Mansion Realm. He was indeed at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm with five divine abilities, true. But few knew his Form and Shadow was from an ancient Daoist tradition, one that required tempering in the mortal world, like a new avatar, to break through. It wasn't perfected at the time, so he wasn't truly complete. When the time came for the siege, countless Foundation Establishment Realm disciples from every sect threw themselves into the fray, wave after wave, until that Moon-Glaze body was utterly ground into dust."

Chi Buzi's voice was low and detached.

"If even Li Jiangqun ended up like that, it's clear that 'Lord' of yours can barely protect himself. He's struggling just to hold on to Mount Dali. What makes you think he can intervene in the affairs of the Bright Yang Dao?"

'Lord?'

The word made Li Ximing flinch. But he smiled.

"King Wei wishes to achieve his Dao. His only path lies with the True Dragons!"

As soon as this was said, Fuxuan, who had been listening intently, finally understood. He had personally witnessed the exchange between Wei Xuanyin and Chi Buzi. Hearing this, it all clicked into place.

'This fiend... he's finally thrown in his lot with the Dragon-kin. He's preparing for the Converging Water!'
