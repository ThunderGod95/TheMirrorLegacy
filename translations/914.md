# Chapter 914: The Greater Good

A screech-owl wailed in the sky. Houfu, who had been standing aside like a phantom, shed tears. He took a step back from the roiling black light and pulled a white talisman from his sleeve.

The talisman’s markings were profound, radiating a brilliant light that pushed back against the darkness. The screech-owl circling ever higher in the sky seemed to receive some summons. It struggled, descending with great reluctance, drawing all the black light with it. It transformed back into a talisman and flew into the white one.

Then, the great crows shrieked. They plummeted from the sky, smashing into the ruined pillars and the throne. Blood splattered everywhere as they crashed to their deaths, one by one. In less than fifteen minutes, the ground was littered with bird corpses. Their wings were stiff, their eyes wide open—a scene of utter devastation.

The black fog on the horizon also seemed to be suppressed by something. It did not spread; instead, it steadily weakened and vanished.

A Daoist Master with three spiritual penetrations and a Great Daoist Master sword immortal with four... both had fallen at the same instant. What an overpowering, dominant display of force.

Bursts of light flashed across the sky as the black aura finally receded. The grand array's light dimmed. A woman materialized in the wind, descending nearby. She furled her dharma umbrella, remaining silent.

It was Hengxing.

Li Ximing stood amidst the field of bird corpses. Tinglan had stepped aside. They watched Houfu walk slowly to the front of the steps. The brown-robed man tucked the talisman back into his sleeve, his expression already calm. He plopped down on the spot where Kui Qi's body had been.

He raised an eyebrow and said quietly, “I am following my Martial Uncle's last command. We are retreating to Jiangnan.”

Beside them, Hengxing's expression was incredibly complex. Her gaze was lowered, concealing the emotions in her eyes. Her vermilion lips pressed together. Several breaths passed before Li Ximing noticed two streams of tears rolling down her fair face. She seemed to be sobbing.

“That stubborn fool! Did he—did Lin Jianqi—not know how dangerous this was? He had finally reached the Purple Mansion Realm…”

The cultivators had all sensed something unusual about this conflict between north and south, but none could have imagined the North would be this ruthless. Hengxing's words were more of an outburst. It made Houfu lower his head. He replied, “Everyone makes their own choices. If you take a risk, you bear the consequences. Thank you both for considering the greater good…”

Hearing this, Hengxing was overcome with grief and anguish. She gritted her teeth.

“Year after year, you sealed your Daoist tradition, allowing the demonic and the Buddhists to run rampant. Who knows how many people died then! But now he decides to act noble? Why not prioritize the 'greater good' now? Why not harvest the blood qi of a few thousand mortals? Use some Purple Mansion Realm spiritual items? With the power of your Great Xiukui Monastery, how could you not save him?”

“‘Prioritize the greater good’... why not prioritize it now? If your Great Xiukui Monastery had prioritized the 'greater good' from the start and become the next Azure Pond, if you had used the Heavenly Embryo Dao, you would have been able to resist the North's demonic forces and Buddhists!

“Even if it meant harming countless cultivators and commoners, wouldn't that have been better than letting those devils and Buddhist cultivators sweep across all of Jiangbei? Even now, if the greater good is what matters, shouldn't you have saved Lin Jianqi first? It's just condoning murder! Have you not done that enough?”

Finishing her tirade, she turned to Tinglan and wept. “At worst, you’d have another Chi Wei, and at least *he* could have managed the situation. But no, you couldn't walk the righteous path to the end, and you kept up your ambiguous ties with the North. This conflict... this conflict... in past years, wasn't it just a sordid deal between you few northern families and the Buddhist cultivators? Back then, when you sat by and watched the Murong family advance south, did you ever think of today? Bargaining with tigers! And now that disaster has struck…”

At this, she finally choked on her words, falling silent. Tinglan wept silently. Houfu raised his head, his eyes listless.

“What is the greater good?”

“My Xiukui name was never famous. We were once just a branch office of Tiger's Frontier. The world fell into chaos. Then, True Monarch Taiyue came from the sea, took over the branch, and established a Daoist tradition, naming it the 'Kui Cultivating Sect' (Xiu Kui). He brought peace to the land.”

“The True Monarch passed down his Daoist tradition to two disciples. One was named Lin, our Great Xiukui Monastery's ancestor, Ancestor Honglan. He was given mastery of the Celestial Xiukui. The other was named Nian, ancestor of the current Nian family, Daoist Master Dongtai. He was given mastery of The Unsurpassed.”

Daoist Master Tinglan said nothing, listening to him continue.

“Later, the True Monarch pursued the Dao and traveled with Daoist Master Dongtai and several others to Jiangbei, where they established the Yue Cultivating Sect (Xiu Yue). Ancestor Honglan stayed to preside over the Kui Cultivating Sect. When the ancestor fell, his final will was to establish a monastery. He decreed the 'Xiu' in our name, which meant 'to cultivate', be replaced with the 'Xiu' of 'Xiukui', and added the word 'Great'. Thus, the Great Xiukui Monastery was founded.”

The man's expression was bleak. “By lineage, Yue Cultivating and Xiukui are from the same master. By apprenticeship, Yue Cultivating is our Upper Sect. This land of Jiangbei, this Sanxi, even the Xiuyue Mountain Gate... Lord Lou Xing, Martial Uncle Kui Qi... they all went there to train.”

Li Ximing felt a mix of sorrow and shock.

'Yue Cultivating Sect never made a move...'

The man before him continued in a low voice, “The Immortal Mansion once decreed that immortals and mortals be separate. All sects were to hide in the mountains, forbidden from ruling, and all were to honor the Green Pine. None were to act under the name of the Supreme Yin. *That* was the greater good back then.

“Later, the Immortal Mansion sealed itself and vanished. In all of Jiangbei and Jiangnan, only four sects truly upheld that rule.”

“Yue Cultivating, Sword Gate, Xiukui, and Hengzhu.”

Tinglan remained silent as Houfu spoke softly. “Beneath my Great Xiukui Monastery, the mountains are filled with countless temples. This is our foundation. Before Martial Uncle Kui Qi, we rarely intervened. Even when Li Jiangqun called himself the heir of Supreme Yin, Lord Lou Xing merely went to Yue Cultivating Sect to study; he didn't join his banner.

“When it comes to non-interference, my Great Xiukui Monastery's rules are no less strict than Sword Gate's. We just live deep in the mountains, untouched by the common moral code, without your spiritual pines or sword manuals. But when the time came to change, it was just as difficult for us.

“Coming to today, I'll be blunt: aside from your Hengzhu affairs, my Great Xiukui Monastery has wronged no one. Martial Uncle Kui Qi's fall today was *also* for the Supreme Yang Dao Daoist tradition! He, too, prioritized the greater good! Otherwise, we could have just hidden in Tiger's Frontier. What would Jiangbei's fate have to do with us?”

Houfu slowly closed his eyes. “The Azure Pond affair was just the Chi family. They are already annihilated…”

Hengxing wiped her tears and shook her head.

“Do you think I don't understand?”

“This isn't the time for argument. I just have a few questions. Everyone in the world sees the 'greater good,' but how many truly act for it? The golden Daoist tradition in the northern mountains—their words are so righteous. Isn't everything they do for *their* greater good?

“This so-called 'greater good,' it's vital, yes, but most of the time it's just a tool the righteous path uses to temporarily lower its own standards. It just forces some people to compromise and endure. Sometimes, it's even used to justify abandoning morality entirely. How many evil deeds began with 'considering the greater good'? How much slaughter has been committed in its name?”

She spoke with furious tears. “Lin Jianqi was willing to die for it. But how many people in this world can be Lin Jianqi?”

With that, Hengxing turned away. A few tears scattered, transforming into a crimson wind. It plucked a black feather from the ground, passed through the array, and drifted away, dissipating into a red mist.

Houfu stood silently on the steps, watching her depart. After a long time, he sighed and asked, “How is Ning Wan?”

Tinglan lowered her gaze. “She returned to Azure Pond. No word yet.”

A deep weariness surfaced in the brown-robed man's eyes. Cultivators from the Great Xiukui Monastery were known for their pride, and Houfu especially so. This ordeal had left him exhausted. He looked at Li Ximing and said in a low voice, “We’ve made a fool of ourselves in front of Zhaojing. You may take your people back when you see fit. We still need to... clean up. I will come discuss matters with you again later.”

Although the conclusion had been drawn long ago, Li Ximing still felt a sense of gloom.

'We couldn't even hold the Sanxi region. From now on, the Buddhist cultivators will be right across the river...'

The retreat of the Supreme Yang Dao Daoist tradition from Jiangbei was terrible news for Li Ximing. Once the Buddhist cultivators and demonic cultivators entered Baijiang Creek, who knew how much trouble would follow?

“Alright…”

He agreed. Houfu fumbled in his sleeve and took out a jade box. He lifted the lid, revealing its contents: a palm-sized, ink-black stone cylinder, its concave parts flashing with brilliant color.

“Please take this, fellow Daoist. We feel terrible about your injuries... I don't have the Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill with me, but I will arrange for one to be sent to you.”

Li Ximing refused a few times and did not accept it. He quickly took his leave. Houfu shook his head silently.

“Have someone deliver it to Moongaze Lake. Although the lake itself was unharmed, they were badly frightened. We can't let them have second thoughts.”

Helian Wumeng had been intercepted by Li Zhouwei, after all. If not for that, the lake would have seen a massacre. The incident seemed small, but its implications were not. It was a troublesome matter to resolve.

Tinglan watched him go. “He’s been short one Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill for a long time. The Bright Yang spiritual essence is good, but we have a finite supply. You need to be careful with it…”

Houfu looked helpless. "I know. But times are different. Now that Jiangbei is lost, we will face difficulties everywhere. We didn't even get Secret Diffusion's item. We can't be sure we'll get anything next time. We must be frugal and plan for the long term.

“But Li Ximing is different. Martial Uncle had him stay in the array and gave specific instructions. His intentions were obvious. He specifically mentioned the spiritual essence, so we must give it…

“Others see it the same way. Li Ximing is close to us and gave his all to bog down Helian Wumeng. If he doesn't get a good reward for that, no one else will be tempted to work for us either. And besides, there is still Li Zhouwei!”

Houfu rubbed his temples. Now that it was his turn to be in charge, he was starting to understand Kui Qi's old frustrations. “As for the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill you mentioned, since it's what he needs, we'll keep it on hand. It will give us more flexibility next time.”

“Mm.”

Tinglan acknowledged. “Now that we’ve returned to Jiangnan, things will probably be easier... Xiao Chuting's intervention this time was unexpected... I wonder what the future holds…”

“We must thank him for this, but we cannot rely on him in the future.” Houfu's expression held a trace of regret. “He cultivated Pit Water long ago and forcibly carved a path for himself. Although Pit Water has no master, that path is incredibly difficult. He was only able to return because Mount Xianyou's plans are not yet complete.”

Li Ximing left the main hall and exited the inner array. He saw the sword cultivator from the Jade True Dao sitting by a green stone, drinking alone.

Daoist Master Zhusheng asked, “How is fellow Daoist Kui Qi?”

Seeing Li Ximing's mournful expression, he knew the news was not good. He patted his sleeves, stood up, and observed a few moments of silence. He shook his head, clasped his hands behind his back, and said, “I saw fellow Daoist Hengxing rush out without even stopping. I knew things must be bad.”

Li Ximing exchanged a few pleasantries. Zhusheng said, “I heard from Tinglan that you have the Aged Courtly Path Sutra. When there's a chance, I'd like to take a look. I'm mainly interested in the Courtly Red Dust Qi. My own Daoist tradition mentions it, so it would be best if I could see it.”

A portion of Courtly Red Dust Qi had already been pledged. Who knew how many years it would be before he got more. But it was worth mentioning. Zhusheng could see he was distracted and bid him farewell. Li Ximing left from the side exit, his heart heavy with worry.

He returned to the great hall. Li Minggong was still waiting. She reported, “Word has come about the Fei family. The Family Head's intention is... to ask the Tangdao Mountain Range.”

How could Li Ximing not know Li Jiangqian's meaning? But Li Minggong hadn't experienced the family's recent turmoil; she only knew that Fei Qing'yi had rebelled and felt she had to ask. Li Ximing's expression, however, was icy. He waved his hand.

“Go directly to Wen Wu. Tell him to take care of it.”

On this matter, Li Ximing felt a deeper, lingering fear than Li Zhouwei and the others. Li Minggong's expression turned grim. She hurried off, leaving Li Ximing sitting alone in the hall.

The Daoist Master poured himself a cup of tea. His gaze drifted to the dark waves roiling in the distant night sky. The evening sun was completely obscured, unable to bleed even a hint of red through.

He sat in quiet contemplation. A long time passed before he rested his hand on the table and lifted his cup.

'Yehui... what will he choose...'

…

Xiaoshi Mountain.

The sunset was like blood. Wreckage littered the ground. A colossal golden visage stood in the clouds, radiating layers of light. On the ground, monks scurried about and Master Monks rode the wind, a grim, murderous aura hanging over them.

The Buddhist cultivators were not like those of the Immortal Dao; they didn't set up as many arrays. Several Merciful Ones had conquered Xiaoshi Mountain and were immediately moving on to the Tangdao Mountain Range. They had no time to secure the area. The three Buddhist cultivators who had gone north had not yet returned, but they were encamped near the main peak of Tangdao. This place was left relatively empty.

It wasn't until a Merciful One flying past picked up Helian Wumeng and brought him back to garrison here that the sporadic resistance finally died out.

The man, who wore eighteen glass prayer beads at his waist, held a long-handled scythe-like blade. He approached, riding a cloud of baleful qi. His expression was calm, but seeing the ant-like swarm of monks and Master Monks on the ground, a trace of disgust rose in his eyes.

'Like weeds. They spring up wherever they go...'

Just then, a nun flew over, treading on a lotus throne. She wore a joyful expression and smiled.

“Greetings, General Helian! I am Nuxiao, serving under the Great Desire…”

Helian Wumeng glanced at her. The Buddhist cultivators had, at least, just sent someone to support him. And while this woman's cultivation was lacking, her status was clearly not low, implying she had backing. He suppressed some of his coldness and said casually, “So, it is Merciful One Nuxiao.”

He seemed to recall something and gave a cold sneer. “I imagine you are perfectly aware of what I saw on the riverbank. Are you here eagerly sniffing for news?”

After all, the great war that had made the Helian family's fortune was the Qi Emperor's crusade against the Wei crown prince. As a Purple Mansion Realm expert of the Helian family, Helian Wumeng certainly knew of the entanglements between these Buddhist cultivators and the Wei and Li families.

Unexpectedly, his question made Merciful One Nuxiao look rather disappointed.

“The General is correct... but that man's destiny is too great. He is not someone a minor figure like me can touch. Perhaps one day, in a great siege, I might be able to snatch a bite or two from the sidelines. That would be fortunate enough…”

'Who do you think you are? That Audience with the Celestial Gate is already adept at killing Merciful Ones. Once his wings are fully fledged, you’d be brave just to show your face in front of him!'

Helian Wumeng was proud and held himself in high regard. In all his years of fighting, only that man had earned the right to be called his lifelong nemesis after a single battle. He naturally looked down on these Buddhist cultivators. He sneered, his disdain obvious.

The nun before him, however, simply beamed, not minding his cold reception in the slightest.

“I’ve come into possession of a treasure. Seeing the General's return, I came specifically to ask if you would honor me with a look!”
