# Chapter 1084: The Invitation

Jinghai.

Dust plumed on the official road. A long, unbroken column of troops snaked like a river, their beginning and end lost in the distance. The man at their head flicked his whip absently, his mind clearly elsewhere.

'Sending me to the Southern Borderlands... What kind of assignment is this, really?'

Li Jiangxia's gaze drifted, skimming the distant mountain scenery. All the confidence he'd shown in the palace was gone, replaced by a heavy mood.

'The Southern Borderlands...'

It wasn't that Li Jiangxia was unwilling to go to such a remote place. And Li Ximing wasn't a harsh person; he might even have words of praise for him. But his thoughts were on other matters.

'Now that I am a Holder of the Profound, I don't need to be leading troops. The best thing would be to find a quiet place to properly forge my immortal foundations and elevate my divine ability...'

Jiangbei might look like it was descending into chaos, but the great war between north and south had just ended. No new major conflicts would erupt anytime soon. The White River region, nestled between Tangdao Mountain and Moongaze Lake, was actually one of the few places one could cultivate in peace.

The Southern Borderlands, on the other hand, while not a threat to his life-mandate, was plagued by constant skirmishes. How could he find any time to cultivate there?

His mood had thus been sour for the entire journey. He rode his prized steed in silence, eyes narrowed slightly.

'I wonder which secret art Li Jiangqian has reached. The family's Li Fire cultivation method is formidable; he must be on the second or third art by now. The honor of being the first to break through to the divine ability realm should fall to him!'

Li Jiangxia actually hoped Li Jiangqian would succeed. A smile touched his thoughts.

'That elder brother of mine is the most decisive and strategic. The path he finds will surely be extraordinary. As his younger brother, I'll get to see his methods and skills firsthand. It will be a good reference.'

As he was pondering, he suddenly looked up, sensing something. In the distant mountain peaks, lightning flashed and thunder roared. Snow billowed as divine abilities clashed, shaking the Great Void itself. His mind went still.

'They've already started!'

His expression turned solemn. He sank his spiritual sense into his sea of Qi, connecting it upward to his Shengyang Acupoint.

High in the sky, the dense clouds suddenly dispersed. The Martial Cultivation Star blazed with sudden, brilliant white light. A wisp of water and fire surged from his dantian, transforming into the miracle of True Qi!

He rose, treading on water and fire, and saw the distant wilderness trembling. A mountain-sized, black-backed great Demon was crouched among the peaks. It commanded a dark, jade-green light. It had four limbs and a tail, a lean, canine body, and a round, flat head that looked unsettlingly human. Its face was covered in a thin layer of white fur, and its eyes were pitch-black, its mouth filled with sharp fangs.

The Demon's face was ferocious. With its hands raised, it was physically holding up an immense Celestial Gate hovering in mid-air. A man in pale-gold Daoist robes stood atop the Celestial Gate, hands clasped behind his back, his expression ice-cold.

It was Li Ximing!

Li Jiangxia channeled his water and fire and laughed loudly.

"Ancestor! I'm here to help!"

The Daoist Master raised his eyebrows, looking at him with considerable surprise. He saw the young man press his palms together at his chest, join two fingers, and raise them to the level of his brow. Li Jiangxia intoned:

"Light of Serene Pacification!"

Instantly, the stars in the sky flared. Water and fire intertwined and fell abruptly, transforming into a fiery rain like sweet dew. It scattered down, covering a hundred-mile radius. A single beam of light shot out from within it, striking the Demon's body squarely.

The Demon let out an earth-shattering roar. Li Ximing considered this for a moment, thinking to himself:

'What a powerful Profound Light!'

'With my current insight, while this light is a far cry from the Great Parting's White Brilliance, it's already not inferior to my own Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light!'

'Even more remarkable is the natural ease with which he manipulates water, fire, and True Qi within that light... It's completely unlike what a Bright Yang cultivator should be capable of.'

He lowered his head and sighed inwardly.

'It truly is different. Seeing him use this Dharma Art so easily, his potential is probably far higher than the supposed upper limit of a Merciful One... No wonder Situ Huo was so eager to cozy up to him!'

He smiled faintly, pulled him up onto the Celestial Gate, and said,

"Jiangxia, you're here? Are you coming to..."

"I am under orders to guard the Southern Borderlands for you, Daoist Master!"

Even though Li Jiangxia had expected it, seeing for himself that Li Ximing's attitude toward him was good, the young man secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He felt a bit more at ease and, while forming hand seals to cast an art, he asked,

"Which Demon King is this?"

"It's Great King Black-Back, one of the Bifeng Mountain Lord's subordinates."

Li Ximing replied casually, applying pressure with his arts, but in no apparent hurry.

"He cultivates 'Gathering Wood.' He only became a Demon King by leveraging the martyrdom of Yuanxiu. He's a black-backed demon dog with a trace of noble blood. I had to suppress him for a full incense stick's time before he'd show his true form."

In truth, Li Ximing's combat strength was quite high. With his spirit fire, he could probably even fight on autopilot. But when you added the terrifying Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire, it was enough to make anyone take notice. And of all things, this Demon just had to cultivate Gathering Wood!

Merging Fire burning Gathering Wood... it was like a wildfire in a dense forest. It wouldn't stop until everything was burned to cinders!

'If I really got serious... one blast of the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire, and nine times out of ten, he'd be screaming for his ancestors!'

But he didn't need to dwell on it. Right now, Can Lufu was surely watching from the Great Void. For Li Ximing, just knowing his advantage was a victory in itself. He naturally wouldn't alert the enemy; he would just treat this as Emperor Song's mission and drag it out, going through the motions.

He turned his head and smiled.

"I was just dragging my feet here, putting on a lazy show. Now that you've shown up, you're going to scare that old snake into pulling his piece back!"

Li Jiangxia raised an eyebrow and grinned. Sure enough, thunder rolled from the south as dark clouds swept in. Another Demon King was rushing over as a reinforcement. Li Ximing immediately retracted his divine ability, letting the dog Demon go.

This Demon, however, was used to lording over the Southern Borderlands. Being suppressed by a single divine ability was already humiliating. Seeing the two of them ignore him as if he were nothing, he was so angry he started to laugh. He didn't hold back, sneering coldly,

"You're cultivating a dead-end path that'll get your ancestors killed, and you still dare to point fingers at Lord Bifeng? What are you?!"

This remark made Li Ximing, who had been about to pack it in, pause. He gave the Demon a strange look. Li Jiangxia, however, just raised an eyebrow and sneered.

"What a loyal 'Gathering Wood' hound, daring to bark at the gate of Bright Yang and Li Fire. Just wait until King Wei perfects his divine ability and comes to Can Lufu's mountain to capture you. We'll see then if Can Lufu dares to step out and repay that loyalty of yours!"

This retort struck Great King Black-Back silent. How could he not know Can Lufu's way of doing things?

That mountain lord had escaped from the Dragon-kin, but he still lived under the shadow of those centuries. He was cautious to an extreme, seeing the Dragon-kin's intent to kill him in everything. If Li Zhouwei one day truly perfected his divine ability and came to the Southern Borderlands, how would Can Lufu possibly dare to show his face?

He retreated in a hurry, but Li Ximing was frowning.

'Among the Demon Kings under Can Lufu and those friendly to him, this newly broken-through Great King Black-Back is the easiest to eliminate. I just hope I didn't scare him off for good.'

So, he pulled back and started to head back with Li Jiangxia, his mind turning over other thoughts. He smiled and said,

"You wielded that True Qi divine ability today with such natural ease!"

Li Jiangxia knew what he was asking. He bowed slightly and replied,

"With the blessing of Tianwu, when I cultivate True Qi arts, it is as if I were a true cultivator. With the bestowed Qi, I naturally grasp all sorts of Dharma Arts. It is related to my mental state and Dao-Profundity, not this junior's own ability!"

Li Jiangxia held nothing back, explaining all the wondrous aspects one by one. Li Ximing finally asked the most crucial question.

"Buddhist cultivators draw upon the light of the Buddhist Land. If they are cut off from the Great Void, they become like rootless water, greatly weakened. This Tianwu True Qi... does it have a similar flaw?"

Li Jiangxia shook his head slightly.

"The light of Tianwu is bestowed by the Martial Cultivation Star. It has nothing to do with the Great Void. Unless one trespasses into the domain of a True Monarch or enters a land where Martial Cultivation does not shine, it will not be diminished..."

Li Ximing paced a step.

"Impressive..."

A Holder of the Profound, by raising their Shengyang Acupoint, gains the power of a divine ability, but not a specific, concrete one. They still require all the other powers of the Great Void, like water and fire. Back then, Li Jiangliang compared them to a Merciful One. Their strength is similar, but their essence is fundamentally different.

A Merciful One's cultivation involves verifying their position in the 'non-retrograde' land of the Buddhist Land—in immortal cultivator terms, their Shengyang Acupoint is _in_ the Buddhist Land. Thus, no matter how they die, unless the Great Void itself is severed, they always have a path of retreat. But a Holder of the Profound's Shengyang Manor never leaves their mortal shell. Instead, it is sensed by the Martial Cultivation Star, and the divine miracle descends from the heavens, surging within their Shengyang Acupoint.

If a Merciful One is a tenant farmer of the Buddhist Land, a Holder of the Profound is, to put it nicely, a favored guest retainer. To put it bluntly, they are a private soldier. They are not someone's personal property. While this grants them more freedom, death is true death. The divine miracle is immediately reclaimed by the star in the heavens, ready to be bestowed upon the next person appointed by Emperor Song, with almost no loss.

Everything has its pros and cons. Because of this, Li Jiangxia could even return the Profound Light and continue cultivating his own divine ability!

But while he praised it aloud, his heart was noncommittal. He sighed inwardly and mused,

'What Daoist Master Diyan mentioned, 'holding multiple external Profound Mysteries,' must be this path... It seems to be for those with no hope of achieving the Dao.'

The two had only been talking for a moment when a cultivator in white robes drifted down from the mountains. His eyes were bright and shining, full of spiritual energy. It was Cheng Qian!

But this Daoist Master Cheng Qian was not alone. Another Daoist Master appeared beside him, riding a cloud. He wore a robe patterned with waves and crescent moons, a light silver satin jade belt at his waist. His features were exceptionally handsome. He bowed slightly and smiled.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing... I have long heard of your great name!"

Li Ximing's spiritual sense swept over him and detected an aura of 'Supreme Yin.' His heart leaped.

'A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Supreme Yin Dao!'

This was the first time he had ever met a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Supreme Yin Dao!

His family had risen from obscurity relying on an Immortal Artifact that gushed Supreme Yin Moon Radiance day and night—an artifact that was very likely a supreme Dharma Treasure of the Supreme Yin Dao. He already felt a natural affinity for cultivators this Dao, and he found the man before him pleasing to the eye. He hesitated for a moment, then returned the bow politely.

"This Daoist Master is...?"

The young man raised a hand, his smile exceptionally warm.

"I am Che Hong, of the Chunyi Dao Gate!"

The suspicions in Li Ximing's heart were instantly confirmed. He bowed again.

"So it is a Daoist friend from the Chunyi Dao Gate!"

Although it was their first meeting, the atmosphere was harmonious. Li Jiangxia was perceptive and quickly bowed.

"Please, Daoist Masters, discuss your important matters. This junior was ordered to garrison the Shaman Kingdom, and my army is still on the road. I won't delay you."

He excused himself from the group. Cheng Qian, however, wore an odd expression and asked,

"Was that one of your family's Holders of the Profound? He must be King Wei's son... the one with the golden eyes."

This question made Che Hong turn his head in surprise. Li Ximing didn't want to elaborate and brushed it off with a few words. Che Hong listened for a moment, caught on, and smiled.

"I suppose I have some affinity with your noble clan! Years ago, I was on the coast with Qi Qiuxin, standing guard against the Purple-Gold demonic cultivators, when I unexpectedly met a member of your clan—she was... wielding thunder..."

Li Ximing had heard Qi Qiuxin mention this once. He understood immediately and smiled.

"That was my aunt, from the Qing generation, named Hong! ...She now serves at the Thunder Pool!"

Che Hong was visibly stunned. He froze for several breaths before saying, shocked,

"She... She is the Thunder Maiden of the Profound Pool... To think we have such a connection! My name is Xi Chang... The Thunder Maiden might remember me..."

Li Ximing just smiled. Che Hong, however, looked extremely chagrined and let out a long sigh.

"I have been disrespectful!"

Li Ximing shook his head, not acknowledging the apology, and simply asked:

"Daoist Master, your visit this time...?"

Che Hong finally snapped out of it. He rose, retrieved a white, osmanthus-patterned scroll from his sleeve, and held it with both hands, his expression solemn.

"By the grace of the Marsh's first light, our Dao is pure and one. We, the descendants, dare not be complacent. Our Daoist Tradition's Great Daoist Master, of the Yuan generation, named Yuanshang, now seeks completion. We respectfully invite fellow Daoists of the Immortal Mansion to observe the Profound Mystery, for the benefit of posterity..."

The two men in the mountains both froze. Cheng Qian immediately took a step back, avoiding a direct line, and said in a shaken voice,

"A Great Daoist Master is seeking the Dao!"

'Yuan... shang?'

Li Ximing had never heard this name, but just from his Daoist title, he knew this was an elder Daoist Master of a senior generation. He shot up from his seat, stunned.

"This...!"

Che Hong said gravely,

"Please."

Li Ximing composed his shocked expression, bowed very solemnly, and accepted the white, osmanthus-patterned scroll. He unfastened it and saw it was filled with flowing script. The invitation at the end was addressed to: Daoist Master Zhaojing and Daoist Master Minghuang of the Jingzhou Moongaze Marsh Family.

According to the rules of the Immortal Mansion, his family did indeed count as a vassal family. It was just that this status was no longer respectable, and no one had mentioned it for years. Reading it filled him with emotion. He rolled up the scroll and asked:

"The Great Daoist Master cultivates...?"

"Supreme Yin!"

Li Ximing was not unaware of the traditions of the Jiangnan Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. Whenever a Great Daoist Master undertook the Quest for Gold, numerous cultivators would gather. It was just that after his own breakthrough, the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition had begun to decline. In all these years, the only one to properly attempt the Quest for Gold was Yuanxiu.

But Daoist Master Yuanxiu had used a strange secret art and couldn't suppress his Dharma body as he neared his breakthrough. It happened too suddenly, and no invitations were sent. Yuanshang was now the first in a long time!

He felt a sense of hope, even anticipation. He said with great sincerity,

"I wish the senior predecessor success in his Quest for Gold and ascension to become an Immortal of Heaven and Earth!"

Che Hong pressed his lips together and nodded.

"According to the old rules, you may bring one or two juniors to observe the ceremony. Originally... this was also to help the juniors form some connections..."

Li Ximing's eyes lit up at this. He instantly had candidates in mind.

'For the Supreme Yin Dao, Jiangchun is the most suitable! And maybe Que'Wan, who is about to enter seclusion... it would be a huge benefit for both of them! It's just a pity about Zhouwei... he's the one who needs it most...'

He nodded repeatedly, then glanced at Cheng Qian, noticing the Daoist Master's face was full of envy. As an overseas cultivator, he naturally had no right to attend.

Li Ximing's only concern was,

"It's just... I'm under orders to guard this mountain. It wouldn't be right to abandon my post..."

Che Hong smiled slightly and replied:

"The Yang Clan is aware of this. They should have already dispatched a cultivator to take over your watch."

Li Ximing understood immediately.

'No wonder... Two Daoist Masters were already more than enough. Why add Li Jiangxia into the mix!'

He was suddenly delighted and replied:

"I will go get my juniors and head to Chunyi immediately!"

Che Hong smiled.

"Please go quickly and return soon. Daoist Master Chen Yin has already arrived at Chunyi. He has asked for you three times, and is urgently pressing me to bring you over!"

Li Ximing quickly agreed, his mind bright with a new idea.

'That Great Pill of Supreme Yin of mine has been sitting in the clan treasury for so many years. I'll take it with me. I might just be able to sell it to the Chunyi Dao Gate for a good price. The timing is perfect!'
