# Chapter 778: The One From Miao Family

Mount Qingdu.

Dawn had just risen from within the mountains, gradually flickering over the treetops. The jade-like path shimmered beautifully; it was often called the Azure Steps by the families around the lake. It was a metaphor for the path of ascension.

A young man quickly descended the steps, his bearing noble and composed. He wore a platinum-white Daoist robe with tightly fitted cuffs, giving him a clean and decisive appearance. Though he was bathed in golden morning light, his pupils were partially hidden in the shadow of his nose bridge and only glimmered faintly with gold.

A cold and stern black-robed youth followed closely behind robes. His voice was low and steady. “Your Highness, the new disciples from each family have all entered the estate...The numbers are down by twenty percent compared to last year.”

Li Zhouwei was just seventeen, and had focused solely on cultivating the perception technique art. When Li Xizhi and Li Ximing were his age, they had just reached the Qi Cultivation Realm, yet he had already reached the fifth stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Li Zhouwei was undoubtedly the finest talent in the family in several generations.

Chen Yang too had outpaced his peers by a wide margin. Since he had only reached the Qi Cultivation Realm a few years ago, he was hailed as the most gifted outsider in a hundred years. Many within the family believed it was due to his half-direct bloodline from the main family. Though he was widely praised, it was seen as expected.

“Twenty percent.” The two strolled across the peak, both well aware of the reason behind the numbers. Li Zhouwei slowed to a stop with his hands clasped behind his back, golden flecks of light swirling within his pupils.

The glow no longer had the strange and eerie hue it once did. Now, it clearly radiated the brilliance of mana. The golden flecks came from the Grand Veined Golden Eyes that Li Xizhi had brought back years ago.

He had refined the Grand Veined Golden Eyes quite early. This Bright Yang perception technique art was no easy feat. Ancient cultivators of the Wei State’s Li Family once needed twenty years to master it, yet Li Zhouwei had done so with ease.

Chen Yang was extremely skilled in reading people and assessing situations. He cupped his hands and replied, “The war up north remains uncertain... These people are afraid. They're afraid that if they send their family's youths here, they'll be sent to the northern front in a few years...

“They’ve each kept one or two behind, sending the rest away under the pretext of training trips. Some were sent to the east, others to the west. This limited the intake to just twenty percent. Since the spiritual orifice talent pool fluctuates yearly, it's hard to argue against it.”

Li Zhouwei and Chen Yang reached the foot of the mountain, where the lake shimmered with golden light. Several cultivators in the Embryonic Breathing Realm were navigating boats across the water, activating Water Dividing Techniques and diving beneath to mine minerals.

Li Zhouwei’s eyes were half-lidded as he asked, “How many are we short?”

Chen Yang replied respectfully, “Chen, Dou, Xu, Tian, and Lijing have all seen slight increases compared to last year. The four towns of Huaqian and the seven cities of Huayu have each decreased by ten percent. As for the eight towns of Wutu, many are from the region of Mount Yue, so their numbers remained steady. But the population in Milin has withered, dropping by a full twenty percent...

“The missing names on the registry fall under the Jade Court’s supervision. I dare not inquire.”

Li Zhouwei listened, his glowing pupils casting a glance over the water’s surface as he replied, “These families have been graced for many years and are considered loyal. Chen Yang, go verify the registry and personally question each household. Also, send a few family letters to the northern front.”

Chen Yang nodded in understanding. His tone was respectful, but a hint of a dark smile played at his lips. “Your Highness... Just once?”

Li Zhouwei waved his hand and said, “Just once, for now.”

Chen Yang took his leave, and Li Zhouwei stood by the lakeside for a moment, a hint of coldness flashing across his face.

Li Xijun had been gravely wounded in that great battle and had to enter seclusion to fan his spark of life. Li Ximing had been forced to emerge. He was now patrolling the lake on one end while still refining pills and tending to Li Xijun. As a result, household affairs had been left unattended.

He had grown old enough to temporarily take over matters on Mount Qingdu. The constant mobilization had forced them to not only send people north but also dispatch others to investigate various regions. Manpower was already stretched thin.

Investigating abroad was far more dangerous, mostly because of devil cultivators slipping into towns and devouring people. Taking this much risk for mere mortals hardly seemed worth it to the families. Li Zhouwei knew perfectly well that several houses under his rule were especially unwilling. However, he had no patience to negotiate.

“I’ve just taken over household affairs, and in times of upheaval, it’s best not to act too harshly... otherwise...” muttered Li Zhouwei.

So he sent Chen Yang. On the surface, it was a simple inquiry, but in truth, it was a warning. Chen Yang’s fierce and ruthless nature made him the perfect candidate for such a task.

Li Zhouwei rode the wind upward toward the mountaintop. At the summit, he saw a stone platform, flowing with brilliance and etched with intricate patterns.

A dark golden halberd was planted at its center. Its long shaft curved like a crescent moon, with a luminous white arc etched in the middle. It was shrouded in mysterious and exquisite spiritual energy as it silently radiated brilliant light that rendered the surrounding vegetation lifeless and pale.

Beside it lay a circular dharma artifact. It was a golden-red ring, about the width of a pinky, made of neither gold nor silver.

“Two ancient dharma artifacts...” said Li Zhouwei in a low voice.

Both were ancient artifacts. The halberd, in particular, came from a grotto heaven and radiated pure brilliance. Together, their value might not surpass the entire Li Family, but they were certainly worth as much as all of the family’s Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts combined.

In the current Li Family, not even Li Ximing had a proper dharma artifact. Li Xizhi still used a Qi Cultivation Realm sword, yet they had prepared such precious artifacts for him.

“Now that I’ve broken through to the fifth stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, I can finally lay hands on these ancient dharma artifacts!” said Li Zhouwei.

Li Zhouwei stepped forward, passing through the formation that veiled the stone platform. Dazzling light flared before his eyes. The halberd had been sealed for ten years, and the formation surged with Bright Yang energy. Without the protection of the formation, the platform itself would have turned to white sand.

Li Ximing had once tried using this artifact. Even though he possessed a Bright Yang Dao foundation, the halberd had only glowed faintly in his hands. It emitted a few bursts of brilliance and nothing more.

He merely lifted the artifact, then returned to pill refinement, never bothering to refine or claim it. Even now, no one knew its name.

Li Zhouwei slowly approached the great halberd. Its blade had begun to hum and tremble with white light. Slowly, two ancient characters emerged along the halberd's shaft.

Da Sheng.

He gently gripped the long handle, and the halberd shivered as it started to greedily devour his mana. The golden light in Li Zhouwei’s pupils overlapped and intensified as he slowly began to draw it forth.

Buzz... buzz... buzz...

The halberd rejoiced as he refined it. A burst of golden light shot from the arc at its center, landing on him and transforming into the image of a Vast Sky Bright Yang.

The golden light vanished in an instant. As Li Zhouwei pulled the halberd free, a sudden clarity dawned in his heart, Da Sheng Halberd.

The halberd did not emanate much killing intent. It had been forged long ago and placed within a grotto heaven by members of Green Pine Temple. It had rarely tasted blood, and had instead been nurtured by the unified spiritual qi of that world.

He couldn’t calculate exactly how long it had been, but it had likely rested there for over five hundred years. Thus, it was brimming with spiritual energy and teeming with vitality. Yet, it was devoid of bloodlust.

Li Zhouwei gave it a thorough inspection. The halberd’s sturdiness and sharpness needed no further mention. After all, it had been forged in ancient times and nourished for centuries. It was far more powerful than modern dharma artifacts.

Once mana was infused into it, the halberd released invisible white light. Enemies struck by it would feel as though they were under a scorching sun. They would feel restless and would be drenched in sweat.

Within the halberd’s central arc lay further mystery. There was a hidden brilliance that, when activated by a Bright Yang Immortal Foundation, could bestow its wielder with radiant power. The user would be cloaked in divine light, and be able to walk upon brightness. The wielder could seize flame and radiate fearsome majesty.

Li Zhouwei was instantly satisfied. Though he had yet to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm and could not use it to its full potential, this ancient dharma artifact felt extremely compatible with him. It was as if it breathed alongside him.

A fine dharma artifact indeed!

He slung the halberd across his back and glanced at the golden-red Sun Seeker Ring nearby. Though this dharma artifact had no distinguishing features beyond its toughness, he couldn’t take his eyes off it.

So familiar...

Li Zhouwei stared at it for a few seconds, tempted to take it with him. Unfortunately, he’d heard this dharma artifact was an important relic of Green Pine Temple and could not be taken lightly.

He exited the grand formation and arrived at the foot of the mountain, where he suddenly saw An Siwei descending rapidly on the wind.

The middle-aged man spoke gravely, “Reporting to Your Highness, a man has arrived outside the formation. He claims to be from the Miao Family of Thunder Island in the Southern Sea. He wishes to visit Qingdu...”

“A member of the Miao Family?” Li Zhouwei’s expression darkened slightly as he said coldly, “Our elders are still patrolling the lake. Send up a signal flame. As for the Miao Family representative, let him wait at the pavilion below the mountain.”

The matter of Li Qinghong had long been discussed within the family. There was a high chance the Miao Family had come with ill intent. Their timing was precise, striking just as the Li Family’s presence had thinned and Li Xijun was gravely wounded. It was a truly perilous situation...

“I wonder if it’s Miao Quan... I’ve heard the man is quite formidable. If he were to suddenly act out, it could indeed become troublesome.” Li Zhouwei folded his arms and asked, “Was he willing to enter the formation and speak in detail?”

“I asked... Although he looked uncomfortable, he eventually nodded in agreement,” replied An Siwei.

When he heard that the man was willing to enter the formation, Li Zhouwei had a clear idea in mind, Either he doesn’t harbor much ill will... or he has no real grasp of our strength. He’s just relying on the backing of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. But once inside the Foundation Establishment Realm formation, with a late-stage Establishment Realm cultivator operating it, he’ll be walking straight into danger...

Since the Miao Family had shown a willingness to talk, the Li Family naturally preferred fewer enemies over more.

Li Zhouwei responded with a touch of courtesy and instructed, “Serve him tea.”

He immediately started to calculate deeply. His father, Li Chengliao, arrived within the formation as well.

When he heard how polite the Miao Family representative was, he frowned, and Li Zhouwei said gravely, “It’s probably because the reputation of Bianyan’s Immortal Bow frightened them. The incident where Murong Wu was killed within fifteen minutes.”

The father and son discussed the matter in detail and soon devised a response. Li Zhouwei spoke softly, “Father, please take your position and stand guard. I’ll wait for uncle.”

Li Chengliao nodded calmly and left. Lights flickered outside the formation, indicating that Li Ximing had not been far away. He soon arrived, riding the wind.

Li Ximing, clad in a golden Daoist robe, had searched around the lake but found nothing of note. He had only slain a few devil cultivators. Most of the day had passed, and he was feeling rather frustrated.

He grumbled, “What a bothersome task... I have to keep checking for any traces of Foundation Establishment Realm activity. Eighth Brother really has patience, to spend half a year on something like this.”

Li Xijun was seriously injured, so Li Ximing would have to take charge himself for the moment. He didn’t mind, but as he counted the days, the secret techniques he was waiting on still seemed far off. This was giving him a headache.

“The Purple Mansion Realm... how incredibly difficult it is to attain!”

When he returned to the mountain and saw Li Zhouwei, he was momentarily stunned by the youth’s fifth stage Qi Cultivation Realm strength. Li Zhouwei spoke first, giving a brief summary of the situation.

“Let him come up, then...” said Li Ximing.

When he heard that the visitor was from the Miao Family, Li Ximing’s head only ached even more. Still, he had no choice but to shoulder the responsibility. So he maintained his calm composure.

Li Zhouwei understood his uncle’s temperament. He summoned Li Chengliao and Li Xuanxuan on his behalf, preserving the elder’s dignity as he gently added, “Father has already received the news and is waiting in the hall. Uncle only needs to be present; there’s no need to say much.”

Li Ximing blinked at him in surprise, then understood and grinned. “Good!”

Li Zhouwei infused mana into the Da Sheng Halberd, causing the dharma artifact to shine brilliantly. The central arc glowed with a dazzling radiance.

He handed the artifact over and said in a grave tone, “The Miao Family hails from the Southern Sea, where devil cultivators are most numerous. Such people often fear power but not virtue. The renown of the Immortal Bow of Mount Bianyan carries great deterrence, so surely, there’s some hesitation in their hearts. Uncle, place the halberd by your side and observe coldly.”

Li Ximing’s eyes lit up and he nodded. “That, I can certainly manage.”

He rode the wind upward and descended into the main hall, taking his seat at the head. The Miao Family representative entered the hall shortly after.

This Miao Family member had a square face, thick brows, a burly frame, and wore strange clothes. It was neither truly Daoist nor monk-like. Two large bronze bowls were tied at his waist. However, his manner was polite.

“I am Miao Ye of Thunder Island! Greetings, fellow Daoist!”

Miao Ye, too, cultivated the Thunder Dao, so his voice boomed like rolling thunder. Li Ximing leaned slightly in his golden robe. The crescent-shaped Da Sheng Halberd stood tall beside him.

He looked down and said, “I am Li Ximing. Greetings, fellow Daoist.”

Whatever else one could say, Li Ximing had a commanding presence. His cultivation was deep, and one hand rested on the armrest as the teachings of his father, Li Yuanping, seemed to come alive from memory. His bearing had become vividly refined.

Miao Ye’s eyes landed on the Da Sheng Halberd, and its familiar form nearly made him leap up. His heart dropped, thundering like a storm, and he thought to himself, So it was him! It was Li Xuanfeng in the Grotto Heaven! He killed Yu Muxian... and seized this halberd from Tang Shedu!

Miao Ye had once entered the Green Pine Grotto Heaven and chanced upon this very halberd. He had fought bitterly with Situ Chen of the Golden Tang Gate for it, only to run into Tang Shedu.

He had nearly lost his life fleeing in panic from Tang Shedu. He had only survived because a group arrived and inadvertently saved him.

They said Li Xuanfeng had joined the Ning Family... but this weapon is clearly in the hands of the Li Family! Of course, it’s still Li. Hard to draw the line between them!

Miao Ye had long wondered which family Li Xuanfeng truly belonged to. Now, clarity dawned. He looked at Li Ximing with new eyes. He could see streams of radiant light flowing from the man. His Immortal Foundation was no ordinary one. His aura was dense and powerful. This was clearly a veteran at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Though he had never heard of Li Ximing before, the man’s strength was clearly formidable. Weighing the situation, Miao Ye lowered his voice and smiled. “I’ve long heard of your renown, Daoist. I once met Senior Xuanfeng in the secret realm and he saved my life. I’ve always felt immense gratitude toward your esteemed family... It is truly an honor to meet you today.”

“Oh?” Li Ximing’s face showed a flicker of interest as he asked, “I’d like to hear the details.”

Miao Ye recounted the story carefully, beginning with his encounter with Situ Chen. He mentioned the Golden Tang Gate twice, only for the expression of the elderly man nearby to instantly darken. He was clearly displeased by the name.

Li Xuanxuan had personally endured a Golden Tang Gate ambush and had never forgotten it. Li Ximing knew this well and coldly added, “So it was the Golden Tang Gate... Worry not, fellow Daoist. Situ Chen is dead, he perished in the Eastern Sea.”

At first, Miao Ye didn’t think much of it. But when he repeated the story a few more times, a chill suddenly crept through his heart, The Li Family and the Golden Tang Gate are clearly hostile towards each other. There’s been no word of Situ Chen ever since the grotto heaven incident... Fallen in the Eastern Sea... Could it be... he was killed by Li Xuanfeng too?
