# Chapter 1166: A Lonely End

The Exiled Qi churned ceaselessly in the sky. Amidst the mountains, the colors grew faint, sinking into an absolute darkness. Without the protection of the great array, the mysterious power of the Exiled Qi had already submerged the forest, cutting off all spiritual sense.

An icy chill crept through Kong Xiaxiang's limbs. He numbly raised his head and staggered up from the ground, feeling as if his heart was submerged in freezing water. He couldn't breathe, his head spun, and the world around him was an impenetrable smear of ink.

He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and squinted, trying to make sense of the gloom. After a long moment, he spotted a touch of whiteâ€”two withered, haggard eyes set in a lifeless face.

"Old Sect Master... Grand-uncle..."

"The Daoist Master... the Daoist Master has taken his own life."

Kong Xiaxiang shifted on his knees. The old man was still sitting stiffly beneath a tree, his head resting against the trunk, revealing an ancient, wrinkled neck. He had sliced it more than halfway open himself, exposing the grayish-white of his trachea and bloodless flesh.

The sword that had belonged to the previous sect master had long since slipped from his grasp and lay plunged into the earth beside him. His legs were buried limply in the mud, his hands splayed at his sides. He cut a grotesque figure, like a tree stump rotten from the roots up.

"...Old Ancestor... you too..."

Sobbing, Kong Xiaxiang shuffled closer and fumbled to sit by the old man's side. He cupped the man's face in his hands, pressing his palm against the wound in his throat. Only then did a flicker of life return to those two dull eyes as they fixed on him.

"Old Ancestor..."

Tears streaming down his face, Kong Xiaxiang gently channeled his dharma power into the old man's body. But Kong Guxi only stared straight at him. A dirt-caked hand rose and rested softly on the younger man's face, his ancient lips moving twice.

Kong Xiaxiang couldn't hear. He lowered his head, bringing his ear right to the old man's mouth, and finally caught the hoarse, slurred words.

"The Kong... the Kong Clan..."

Though indistinct, the two words were colder than ice. The first sect master of the revived Profound Peak Gate trembled, tears flowing freely as he answered, 

"Old Ancestor... I understand... Just hold on a little longer. It's for the Kong Clan... It's for the Kong Clan..."

He felt the old man before him give the faintest shake of his head. A wisp of icy, residual breath, as fine as a silk thread, brushed against Kong Xiaxiang's cheek.

"A happy... occasion. Don't... don't cry..."

A cold blade seemed to pierce Kong Xiaxiang's lungs. He shivered, his teeth chattering. He raised a hand woodenly and wiped away his tears.

"This junior... won't cry anymore..."

His response seemed to spark one last struggle in the man in his arms. Kong Guxi's eyelids shot open, revealing a flash of panic. Though he was at death's door, his hand suddenly clenched Kong Xiaxiang's collar. Compared to his strength in the Wilderness all those years ago, this grip was faint, yet it felt so heavy that Kong Xiaxiang couldn't breathe. He could only stare, stunned.

Kong Guxi groaned. The wound on his neck tore wider, and a broken stream of air hissed from his windpipe. He summoned every last ounce of strength in his body and forced a single, agonizing word from between his teeth.

"Smile."

The word seemed to drain the last of the old man's energy. His eyes rapidly grew dim. Kong Xiaxiang watched him fall slowly backward until his head struck the tree with a hollow thud. His desiccated pupils dilated, staring unseeingly at the sky behind Kong Xiaxiang, his eyes refusing to close even in death.

A dead, dark silence still hung over the mountain.

The middle-aged man remained kneeling like a statue, staring into the old man's unblinking eyes. An eternity seemed to pass, or perhaps only an instant. Then, with a start, he released his hold and scrambled back a few inches before slowly turning his head.

The pavilion behind him had long since collapsed under the weight of the celestial phenomenon, now just a field of ruins in the oppressive gloom. Trees, blasted by the fallout from the fallen divine ability, were uprooted and scattered across the ground. One raised a branch high, pointing toward the heavens.

A white Daoist robe was snagged on its tip.

"Sect Master... Sect Master!"

Kong Xiaxiang's wails echoed through the mountains, as mournful and sharp as a wild ghost haunting a lonely grave. He wept and laughed in turn, clutching the old man's body tightly, watching as it slowly crumbled to dust in his hands.

The lightning had vanished from the sky. A light patter of rain began to fall, swiftly escalating into a torrential downpour. The storm snatched the white robe from the branch and swept it away into the boundless, ink-black heavens, leaving only the relentless rain to wash away the endless suffering from his body in the darkness.

---

The Exiled Qi in the sky gradually receded, the radiance of the Veiled Yin long since gone. High above, Tinglan stared at the gates of Profound Peak, her expression complex. She remained silent.

Truthfully, her relationship with Profound Peak was not a good one. The grudges between them were convoluted and difficult to resolve. Yet, watching that Daoist Master take her own life in midair, she felt a tightness in her chest that left her unable to speak.

The heavens, filled with divine abilities, and the earth, covered in armies, stood silent. Rain streamed over their armor. Before the great bronze hall, the man stood in silence for a long time.

Yang Ruiyi's heart was a maelstrom of emotions.

Anger? It had scattered when the heavens and earth changed color. Hatred? There was only the bitter frustration of an effort wasted. There was even... a sliver of pity. He felt as though he had punched a wad of cotton; the result was hollow, oppressive.

Beneath that oppression lay a fog of confusion.

'What are the higher-ups thinking?'

He, Yang Ruiyi, hadn't known Wei Xuanyin was here, but it was impossible that his superiors were unaware. And yet, they had allowed one of the enemy's most powerful figures to infiltrate the area... to what end?

'To injure Wei Xuanyin and damage his Dao path? Was it necessary to take such a risk? Could it be... they actually intended to kill him!'

He knew that if Kong Tingyun hadn't taken her own life, Shanji would now be a raging battlefield. Whether Wei Xuanyin could have escaped unscathed was uncertain, but it would have been tantamount to gambling with the Song Emperor's prestige and authority.

Yang Ruiyi didn't doubt their willingness to take risks, but he couldn't see any conceivable benefit that would justify such a gamble. This was the root of his unease. Even though Kong Tingyun's suicide had resolved the crisis, a lingering fear remained.

'Could the Northern Daoist Tradition have wanted to use our hands to eliminate Wei Xuanyin? But he's one of the few remaining pillars of the Guanhua Daoist Tradition!'

He had no time to ponder his doubts further; they sank deep into his heart. Yang Ruiyi's lips parted slightly.

"The Kong Clan."

"The Kong Clan is innocent."

The Heavenly Light shone brightly as King Wei, standing amidst the fading divine abilities, finally spoke. The four words prompted a nod from Yang Ruiyi, who quietly declared,

"The chief culprit is dead. The Kong Clan's disciples will not be pursued."

The statement echoed through the air, but no answer came. Darkness shrouded the silent gates of Profound Peak, from which the faint sound of muffled sobs could be heard. After a long while, Sima Yuanli stepped forward as if waking from a dream and said respectfully,

"The Celestial Dynasty is virtuous and does not blame the common folk... Great General..."

Yang Ruiyi gave him a hurried wave and turned to the others, his voice tinged with weariness.

"This battle has been long. You are all exhausted. Return to your posts..."

Only when his gaze fell upon Li Zhouwei did some color return to his eyes. He gestured for him to approach and said with gravity,

"In this great battle, King Wei's contributions were monumental!"

Li Zhouwei shook his head.

"The highest merit belongs to the Sword Immortal."

Yang Ruiyi offered a strained smile and lifted a sleeve.

"King Wei is too modest... Without you, Qi Lanyan could not have been slain. I must now return with the imperial decree and report to the Emperor to request rewards for Ting Province."

His words carried a congratulatory tone, but Li Zhouwei merely offered polite pleasantries in return. Yang Ruiyi didn't dare linger.

"King Wei is injured and should not travel... I will escort you back to Ting Province."

The young man didn't move. The multicolored light in his eyes burned brightly as he replied,

"This king appreciates the Great General's sentiment, but matters in Jianghuai are not yet settled and still require your attention. There is no need for an escort."

Yang Ruiyi could only nod grimly as Li Zhouwei continued,

"Though the Kong Clan has cut ties with Profound Peak, they carry a heavy burden of infamy. The past wars also took a toll on many southern disciples. The Kong Clan has old ties with my lake and often resides in Shanji. I fear they will require protection."

Profound Peak Gate had offended the Yang family too grievously. Even with the Daoist Master's suicidal sacrifice, much animosity remained. Anyone else would never have dared to make such a request. But coming from King Wei, it made Yang Ruiyi sigh in explanation, "The Emperor is a man of broad virtue and great grace. His recalling of the Martial Inquiry and Tranquil Purity Vessel is a sign of his approval..."

Li Zhouwei nodded. The three from Ting Province took their leave, soaring away on cascading waves of Heavenly Light. They soon arrived back at the lake, where the vast, purple-gold array, now somewhat dimmer, materialized in the distance.

Though they had won, Li Ximing's mood was foul. On the one hand, Li Zhouwei's injuries were worsening; on the other, there was the fall of Kong Tingyun. Whether considering the friendship between their two families or the personal bonds spanning three generations, he was filled with sorrow.

He lamented, "I had wanted to go down and gather them at the lake, but I fear Moongaze Lake will be anything but peaceful from now on... It would only bring harm to their family..."

Li Zhouwei's eyes were shut tight, the aura of calamity still clinging to his face, etching a subtle trace of pain between his brows. He said,

"I will write a formal request to the Song Emperor for a minor title. It would be best to relocate the Kong Clan further south, away from the conflicts of the shore, so they can maintain a low profile and avoid attracting another disaster."

Seeing his condition, Li Ximing could not dwell on other matters. He quickly turned his head.

"Jiangqian... go to the Eastern Sea..."

He trailed off, a sudden sense of danger making him hesitate. He immediately changed his mind.

"Don't leave the Song State. First, make a trip to Jianghuai and find old Daoist Master Shanbai. Ask him for his counsel... However, this calamity is beyond what ordinary people can handle, so he will likely be powerless. On your way back, visit the Sword Gate and see if you can ask for advice from Senior Heaven's Horn!"

Li Jiangqian immediately clasped his hands.

"This junior will leave at once!"

He had emerged from the great war between north and south almost unscathed. Igniting his Radiant Fire, he shot northward in a blur of motion. Li Zhouwei did not stop him. He landed within the inner array and hurried into the main hall. Only then did he take a step forward and laboriously cough up a mouthful of blood.

Before the blood could touch the ground, it dissolved into smoke in an interweaving of Wu Light and Heavenly Glow.

He sat in the main seat and shook his head.

"I fear this injury will not be easily resolved."

He then took a jade box from his sleeve and handed it to Li Ximing.

"The Song Emperor provided a piece of Chuchun Hanging Wood. I must trouble Grand-uncle to prepare it as medicine. I see you are also injured. Horn Wood excels at healing, so you should take some as well."

Li Ximing simply shook his head.

"I have my Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body. After many years of cultivation, it has reached a state of mastery. These wounds are superficial and will heal easily..."

Li Zhouwei didn't press the matter. He lifted his sleeve slightly and produced three items.

One was a demonic blade, little more than an inch long, shaped like an exquisite dagger of gold and iron. Another was a long whip that coiled like a serpent, thick with Baleful Qi and freezing to the touch. The last item, a Dao sword, had a weaker sense of Baleful Qi; its mystical patterns spoke of an orthodox immortal lineage, but its blade was shattered in two, rendering it useless.

Bound by Bright Yang light, these were the relics of Helian Wujiang.

With the fall of the Daoist Master from the Tiefu Kingdom, nearly all of his Spiritual Artifacts had fallen into Li Zhouwei's hands. The others were either unwilling or did not dare to contest his claim, so they never even brought it up. It was a complete windfall. Helian Wujiang's storage pouch had shattered upon his death, its contents scattering into the Great Void like a celestial scattering flowers, destined for some fortunate soul at some unknown time and place.

But those items were secondary. Even the few Enlightened Artifacts they had acquired were sufficient compensation. These three Spiritual Artifacts were the true prize, enough to fully equip a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master.

Li Zhouwei hadn't expected to be able to finish Helian Wujiang, so these gains were a pleasant surprise. Looking at the precious artifacts in his hand, his expression softened, and he said with a smile,

"Of the three, the blade is the most exceptional, the sword is slightly inferior, and the spiritual whip is merely a handy weapon. I do not cultivate Baleful Qi, so it feels too light in my hand, but the materials are excellent."

The Helian family, after all, had deep foundations. Helian Wujiang had died suddenly while covering the retreat, losing three Spiritual Artifacts at once. Li Ximing, who had been frowning this whole time, finally showed a hint of delight and produced a long-necked bottle from his own robes.

"Gongsun Bei's Night Supplanting Bottle is here as well!"

He set the bottle down and then brought out the Heavenly Nurture Urn, holding it aloft with his divine ability. From its dark mouth, strands of golden light struggled to escape, seeking a Buddhist Land. On their way from Baihai Creek, Li Ximing had successfully captured the black tiger.

Li Zhouwei nodded slightly, his expression turning serious.

"With these four Spiritual Artifacts, whether we trade them or melt them down to be reforged, it's enough to arm Jiangqian. And this black tiger... is enough for Que'Wan to receive her investiture. By my calculations, even if achieving the Whole Pill proves difficult, she should be emerging from seclusion soon."

Li Ximing breathed a sigh of relief.

"The gains have been immense... but at the cost of your injury..."

Li Zhouwei shook his head. The colors in his eyes flickered, his mind clearly elsewhere.

"It's hard to say if our gains were great... but we certainly witnessed a good show. We're finally no longer being led by the nose. They were forced into a head-on confrontation, and just as I thought... only when the situation spins out of their control do they reveal more of their secrets..."

"Five Daoist Masters fell in a single battle. The overt and covert struggles between the north and south are truly insidious."

Li Ximing's gaze was fraught with worry. He listened as Li Zhouwei coughed twice, then smiled.

"It was always said that the Heavenly Glow nurtured the Buddhists, but now we know that's not the whole story. As it turns out, the Yang Clan did not want Cheng Xunzhi to die, yet the Way of Great Desire still obeyed them. Otherwise, how could Tangdao Mountain have fallen so easily? From this perspective, Tangdao Mountain never needed to be defended. As long as Jianghuai was reclaimed and the Sword Immortal arrived, the Way of Great Desire would have had to retreat unless they wanted mutual destruction!"

His tone turned to ice.

"I once thought Liu Bai was a pawn the Yang Clan sacrificed to appease the Way of Great Desire, forcing him to join the Buddhists. Now, it seems the machinations behind it... run far deeper..."

A shock went through Li Ximing. "You mean... Liu Bai was... intentionally sacrificed?"

"Whether he was or not, the Mahas and the Merciful One are watching. At the very least, we can ask Cheng Qian about the situation at the time."

The King of Wei spoke coldly.

"I've long known the south was up to no good, and now I've seen the depths of their shadowy tactics... They are truly cold-blooded and without gratitude, shameless in their depravity. Compared to them, Luoxia almost seems to have a sense of dignity!"
