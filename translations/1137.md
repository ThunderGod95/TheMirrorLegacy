# Chapter 1137: Savoring the Rain

Minghui laid on the flattery thick, calming his Master down. After coming down from the main hall, he thought it over and over, slapped his head, and with a single step, arrived at the resplendent, shining Buddhist Land.

The full name of the Way of Joyful Bliss Buddhist Land was the [Twelve Realms Great Compassionate Good Dharma Corresponding Land]. It was attested by their own Ancestral Master, the Great Compassionate, Joyful Lotus-World Aspect, who achieved this at the base of Mount Dayang, becoming one of the Seven Aspects.

The ancient Buddhists did not cultivate through reincarnation. When their physical lifespan ended, it was 'Attestation Complete, Returning to Emptiness'. They did not use their Buddhist Lands to accept people, only cultivating and attesting their own bodies. What they attested was the Golden Land, which was also called the [Response Body] at the time. These varied in size, lacking the clearly defined ranks of today.

It was only after Su Xikong and Shijia Li established the Dao lineage for the modern Buddhists that the concept of the Buddhist Land truly came into being. At that time, the Buddhist Land referred to the Chandana Forest, where all the Dharma Masters resided.

Later, as the Seven Aspects expanded, new Buddhist Lands were differentiated. It was no longer appropriate to call them Golden Lands, so they were termed various [Response Lands]. The Chandana Forest, however, was where the true bodies of the Dharma Masters resided, and it was the sole [True Land].

The Great Compassionate, Joyful Lotus-World Aspect was among the very first group of Dharma Masters to transition from the Daoist Tradition to the Buddhist one. Their status was sublime. This Buddhist Land was pure, quiet, and peaceful, floating lightly at the peak of infinity. Gold covered the ground, endless silks abounded, colorful waters rippled, and lotus flowers bloomed. Everyone's face was filled with joy, free from worries about food or drink. They just sat upright, discussing sutra principles with one another, perfectly content.

They had already transcended the many sufferings of the mortal world, their merits and cultivation complete.

His Master had never liked staying here; it was always his First Disciple-brother, Mingzang, who managed the place. Minghui strode inside. People on both sides pressed their palms together in greeting, and he nodded in return. He passed by layers of golden steps and curtains, beyond lamps shaded by profound Dharma mysteries, and finally saw a monk.

The monk was tall and slender, his hands pressed together, chanting sutras by candlelight. Seeing Minghui enter, he raised an eyebrow and said,

"Little disciple-brother."

Minghui's expression darkened.

He asked, "[Horizon's End of Contemplation]... that side... how are things?"

The Seven Aspects were responsible for assimilating Spirit Beasts and expanding their Buddhist Lands. Each had its own spirit mountain. The most famous were the Compassion Dao's Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour and the Great Adoration Dharma Realm's [Boundless Wondrous Void Cave]. Some others have already fallen into decline, such as Wrath's [Hall of Horns and Furs] and Emptiness's [Temple of No-Delusion Mystery]...

The Way of Joyful Bliss's [Horizon's End of Contemplation] was located in the extreme west of the Western Sea, bordering the Abyss of Weak Water. On its spirit mountain resided the descendants of the Fenglin, the various demons of the Mansion Water!

At this mention, First Disciple-brother Mingzang's expression remained calm, but he sighed.

"There is still activity. Gloom Mountain has sent word to the Buddhist Land several times. They say the ritual disk on the mountain is trembling, showing signs of Pristine Water."

Hearing this, Minghui's expression turned ugly.

"Is it really true?"

His disciple-brother nodded and sighed.

"Could it be... they're settling old scores with the Fenglin?"

Minghui felt his jaw tighten. He shook his head and whispered,

"That Fenglin back then was truly formidable. It was just trapped by an incomplete Mansion Water. It actually joined forces with Dongfang Tianye. One wished to rule the mountains and rivers, the other desired to open up lakes and marshes for the Mansion Water... In the end, heaven and earth were shaken. They were subdued and fell together at the hands of the Liang Emperor and the Demon Monarch..."

"Although the Dragon-kin and the Liang Emperor hadn't yet parted ways at that time, the matter with both Dongfang Tianye and the Fenglin was considered settled. What reason is there to rake it up again? If they truly wanted to settle scores, they wouldn't have waited until today!"

"Ever since the Great Liang was founded, Gloom Mountain's status has plummeted. That's just how it is. With the prestige of our Dao Lineage to deter them, few would dare to get any ideas."

"I just fear... it's that Chi Buzi!"

Mingzang's expression flickered.

"What makes you say that?"

"A cultivator... a great cultivator... who can come and go as he pleases in the Abyss of Weak Water... above Gloom Mountain... how many of those are there in the world? Since the ritual disk gave a clear reading, and it wasn't Mansion Water but Pristine Water, who else could it be? It must be him!"

Minghui, in his youthful form, paced two steps and said angrily,

"There's something unnatural about that guy! He's caused trouble at the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour several times, testing its limits. Now that the people from the Mount Dayang contingent are heavily guarding the place, ready to catch him in the act, he's gone still again... Master said that green-eyed ghost defected to the Dragon-kin. If so, none of this is surprising!"

His eldest disciple-brother sighed heavily, growing more anxious.

"The man is elusive, and his Pristine Water Dao-Profundity is terrifying. He's already on the same level as Wei Xuanyin. Even I am not his match. To deal with him... we can only rely on Master!"

Minghui's expression flickered. He stood up anxiously and paced a few steps. "This is truly troublesome. As long as he hasn't perfected his divine ability, Master has more than enough power to suppress him. But Master's Dharma Body isn't yet complete... it's not a good time to act rashly."

A new layer of anxiety crossed his face.

"Here's what I'm thinking. Since his movements are covert and he hasn't actually attacked, he must be after something. Even if it's the life-mandate of a Spirit Beast, that's something we can negotiate..."

As soon as he said this, Mingzang's expression soured.

"So you're proposing we conspire with him?"

Minghui bowed his head slightly.

"My apologies, disciple-brother," he said, gritting his teeth. "You know Master's spell arts. The [Buddhist Shame] is now complete, and it's the precise time to cultivate the [Evil Terror]. Gloom Mountain has a Great Karmic Affinity with him. If he learns about this, he will definitely go there and raise hell. This is not a good time for that! I urge you, disciple-brother, to prioritize the greater good!"

Mingzang was silent for a moment before replying, "Continue."

Minghui lowered his gaze.

"I had previously used an excuse to leave, intending to go speak with him myself. But now Master has assigned the matter to disciple-brother Mingmeng. That means only he can go. First disciple-brother, you are in charge of affairs... When he reaches the Eastern Sea, I'm hoping you can give him a last-minute instruction: to go and meet with Chi Buzi!"

Mingzang was silent for a long time before finally letting out a breath.

"I suspect... he might still be aiming for Master after all."

...

A fine, endless rain.

Purple qi drifted over the archipelago amidst the endless drizzle. Cultivators flew back and forth, busy among the layers of palaces. The sky gradually darkened, and the flying boats that came and went, riding rays of clear light, grew fewer. Everything was steeped in the fine rain and the encroaching night.

The highest pavilion was exceptionally tranquil. A pale purple curtain of light drifted and swirled, its colors faint. Clear rainwater streamed over the steps, only to be scattered by a pair of boots.

The man was of average height, his Daoist robes fluttering. His features were regular, his eyes holding the hint of a smile. A dot of Heavenly Light rested on his forehead, giving him an air of dashing elegance.

The Daoist Master in white-gold robes stepped up to the pavilion and saw a woman sitting under the eaves, seemingly watching the rain. When she suddenly noticed him, she set down the long-necked jade pot in her hand.

"Exactly ninety days," she said. "And still, it rains."

Kuang Yu was dressed in a pale azure skirt, a thin white silk ribbon tied at her waist. A few dark ornaments hung from one side. Her black hair was softly coiled and held in place by a simple jade hairpin. It was a striking contrast to her usual, simple hairstyle, and it made her appear surprisingly gentle.

She was tall for a female cultivator, standing a full head taller than Tinglan despite her youth. Her usual attire was crisp and bright. In truth, her features were soft, and with her hair coiled this way, she looked even more stunning.

Li Ximing discreetly averted his gaze.

"It rains nine days out of ten in the Xinyu Archipelago," he replied. "It would be stranger if it stopped. The rain has its own flavorâ€”the soft murmur, the rustling of the curtains."

"Hehe." For some reason, she laughed. Standing up, she led him inside.

"I was worried this place wouldn't be as pleasant as the Heavenly Light-filled Ting Province. I even performed a divination yesterday. Cast it three times, just trying to get one clear day."

'The mere weather is something she could change with a single thought. Why would a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator need to divine it three times? She was just debating whether to disperse the rain or not.' Li Ximing chuckled. He met her gaze again, then turned his face slightly.

"I've really put you through a lot of trouble."

'She's clearly a bit flustered herself.'

Seeing him turn away, the woman smiled in secret triumph. Her fair face brightened, and a teasing light entered her blue-purple eyes.

"Daoist friend Ximing," she said, "this [Yin-Yang Mutual Refinement and Conjunction Method] is a secret oral tradition, an orthodox method that must be practiced step-by-step. It's not simple at all. Have you come to understand it?"

Li Ximing gritted his teeth.

"If I didn't understand it, would I have achieved my Bright Yang for nothing?"

Kuang Yu already felt insecure. His retort made her cheeks flush instantly. 

"Then I must ask you for a pointer or two."

Although Kuang Yu possessed a divine ability, she had cultivated at Hengzhu since she was young, living a secluded life. She had no experience with men after achieving the Purple Mansion Realm. How could she win a battle of wits against Li Ximing? The Daoist Master smiled faintly.

"When Yin and Yang join, water and fire merge. It begins with regulating the qi. The qi becomes a dense mist, and one gradually attains the receptive principle..."

He sat upright on the stone stool and took her hand. It was warm in his grasp. Kuang Yu, however, stiffened instantly, her eyes wide as she stared at him blankly. The man before her gazed at her gently and smiled.

"The qi enters the mansion of the Three Profoundities, connecting the upper and lower. It plucks the marvel of water and fire balancing, capturing the light of yin and yang's union. Thus, true yang ascends, and partial yin descends..."

Kuang Yu staggered and found herself right in front of him. Caught off guard, she felt his other hand come to rest on her waist, throwing her into a panic. Her lips parted slightly, but she quickly bit down, turning her head away.

Li Ximing, however, clearly sensed her slender waist. After a moment of tension, it unexpectedly softened, pliant beneath his hand. Now it was his turn for a teasing light to enter his eyes.

"The mouth produces fluid, the myriad bones open their stores, stirring the divine mystery. The yin becomes bright as the moon, the yang rises as brilliant light. For six hundred and eighty short nights, and one thousand eight hundred long dawns, one thus obtains, gradually passing the threshold. This is called 'Flowing'."

The hand on her waist pushed gently, while the hand holding hers pulled. Kuang Yu tumbled into his embrace, landing squarely against his chest. The impact knocked her hairpin loose.

She gasped, "You..."

Li Ximing held her. The hand that had been holding hers now took charge, guiding her wrist to rest against his chest. He quickly released it, instead cupping her chin, tilting her head up.

Her beautiful face was instantly before him, closer than close. He saw the elegant curve of her neck, her tightly pressed lips, her flawless, pink-dusted cheeks, and, beneath lowered lashes, her flustered, blue-purple eyes.

He had guessed right. Her eyes were round and lovely, and the panic and humiliation that made them blink added to their charm.

A very faint, cool fragrance drifted to him.

The woman was powerless, but she stubbornly kept silent, twisting her head to avoid his hand. Then she found the man's expression had turned serious. His lips parted slightly, and a low voice commanded,

"Focus your spirit and calm your qi!"

As a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, her ability to focus her mind was extremely strong. Kuang Yu immediately met his gaze, her eyes clearing, filling with focus and tranquility. The two faced each other quietly, their breathing gradually falling into sync.

The [Yin-Yang Mutual Refinement and Conjunction Method]!

A faint radiance immediately emanated from behind Li Ximing, veiled in plumes of rolling mist. The woman's waist grew softer, and a pale, illusory grey light appeared behind her, the two radiances reflecting one another.

Her light breath brushed his face. As the technique slowly circulated, Li Ximing found that her clean fragrance became increasingly distinct.

The scent was cool and exceptionally elegant, like autumn rain outside the pavilion, carrying a rustling chill. Only after that coolness did the fragrance emerge, like a white apricot blossom struck down in a distant, snowy rain. It was faint, yet perfectly clear.

With her short breaths, it seemed to drift near and far, like clear, cold wine that only reveals its vivid, tender red hue when gathered in a bowl.

He was lost in it, silent for a long time. He didn't know how much time had passed until the woman in his arms suddenly shifted. The hand resting on his chest tapped lightly.

Li Ximing was completely absorbed, having lost himself. After a few more breaths, Kuang Yu grew anxious. With a twist of her head, her smooth chin finally broke free from his grasp.

That movement was like a great bell tolling in his ear. Li Ximing snapped back to awareness. The white apricot blossom in his mind resolved back into the beautiful woman before him. A trace of confusion flickered in his mind as he realized Kuang Yu had gone completely limp in his arms, her head lolled to the side, panting weakly.

The woman looked as if she had fainted. Her face was beaded with sweat, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. She had no strength at all, lying limply in his embrace.

His expression turned awkward. He quickly slid one hand under her arms to support her back, while his other hand sifted through her dark hair to support her head.

"Daoist friend Kuang Yu?"

Kuang Yu blinked, and two tears streamed down her pink cheeks. She took several gasping breaths before saying angrily,

"You're so greedy! Were you trying to drain me dry?"

The first stage of the [Yin-Yang Mutual Refinement and Conjunction Method] is the Respiratory Induction Art. It relies on balancing the yin and yang qiâ€”you exhale, I inhale; you inhale, I exhaleâ€”to harmonize yin and yang and allow the divine abilities to complement each other. Li Ximing's Bright Yang divine ability was inherently dominant and drew heavily on yin. In his moment of absorption, he had, in a single go, completely drained Kuang Yu's sustaining qi, almost causing her cultivation to break!

Kuang Yu was still unable to rise, remaining in his arms. He apologized repeatedly, hastily grabbing the jade pot.

He filled a cup and passed it to her, saying, "Xinyu, your clear qi is truly... fragrant."

The woman just turned her head. The two tears slid down and dissipated into motes of clear light. The flush on her face vanished, returning to its usual fair, bright, and clean appearance. A trace of resentment lingered in her eyes. She dodged the tea he offered and stood up.

"Allowing you to 'savor' me for three days. It seems it was my mistake."

Only then did Li Ximing realize that what had felt like the snap of a finger had actually been three days. He felt invigorated, his dharma power unified. He quickly said,

"My mistake, my mistake. The Bright Yang is a bit... intense."

But a smile still lingered in his eyes. He struck a pose and shook his head. 

"That was only the first-level method of 'Respiratory Exchange'. The Wondrous Spirit has not been ferried, the Profound Union not yet connected... When we get to _that_ part..."

Kuang Yu was an sharp-witted woman to begin with. She saw at a glance he was teasing her again. Stubbornly refusing to show her annoyance, she quickly cut him off, feigning anger.

"Oh, really! They all say this Daoist Master Zhaojing is so steady. It turns out you're just a smooth-talker. It's called an 'exchange', but you were intentionally 'savoring' me. Who could withstand that?"

"In that case..."

Before she could react, her hand grew warm. The man had taken it again. His other hand found her waist. Kuang Yu pressed her lips together as she was pulled back into his grasp. The man looked down at her and smiled warmly.

"This time, it's your turn to 'savor' me."
