# Chapter 103: No Room For Escape

Li Xiangping sat quietly by the fire which illuminated his face with a golden-red sheen. His clothes were worn and torn, and he seemed utterly exhausted.

The ends of his leg hair were curling up from the heat of the flame, but yet, his gaze remained laser-focused on the yams roasting in the fire pit.

He had been fleeing from danger to danger these days and had narrowly escaped death at the hands of Qi Cultivators multiple times now. He has already grown accustomed to deaths having killed countless Mount Yue’s generals, and having experienced rallying people to assault Great Jueting.

Li Xiangping’s demeanor had changed from that of a privileged courtyard dweller to that of a rugged man. The blood and flames of the multitude of battles have toughened him up, gradually turning him into another Jianixi.

“Great King! Mu Jiaoman has gone to Mount Wu... and no one knows what his intentions are!”

Instead of correcting his way of addressing Li Xiangping, Ahuici, and his men even managed to influence Li Qiuyang and Chen Donghe to refer to Li Xiangping as the Great King as well.

Chen Donghe’s leather armor bore a cut, revealing a crimson wound beneath the dirt and dried blood stains. With a map in hand, he traced the routes and patterns with his fingers thoughtfully.

“You must tread carefully, Great King!” he advised with a grave expression.

“Indeed.” Li Xiangping chuckled as he silently grasped the crystal-clear pearl in his pocket.

He’s most likely seeking help from a cultivator of the Foundation Establishment Realm. I can’t continue wasting any more time and I ought to think of a way to send this... thing home as soon as possible!

Li Xiangping had been fighting westward and had acquired the transparent pearl from the altar of a major tribe.

Sensing the Profound Pearl Talisman Pearl in his Qihai acupoint reacting to it, he decided to take it along with him as he figured it probably bore a connection to the mirror at home.

Glancing mischievously at Chen Donghe, who had an extremely serious look on his face, Li Xiangping decided to tease him.

He looked up at the boy with a mischievous smile.

“Hey, He’er, are you smitten with my daughter, Tian’er? Shall I arrange a marriage for you?” he teased with a cheeky tone.

Chen Donghe’s handsome face immediately flushed and his eyes darted down to stare at his toes silently, embarrassed. Li Qiuyang burst into laughter immediately which earned him a kick from Chen Donghe in response, though the boy did not dare to meet Li Xiangping’s gaze.

Li Xiangping shook his head and chuckled. “If Tian’er accepts it, I have no objections! My only condition is that you must take her as your first wife!”

Hearing the approval of his potential father-in-law, Chen Donghe blushed even more, struggling to speak.

“I-I’ll... never... disappoint Tian’er...” he mumbled, stumbling over his words in deep embarrassment.

The crowd erupted into laughter, and Chen Donghe immediately wished the ground would just swallow him then and there.

Ahuici laughed so hard that he coughed.

“Sheesh, the men on Mount Yue snatch any woman they fancy as their wives, no one does things like you people.”

“You want to try doing that?” Li Xiangping asked with an eyebrow raised and a teasing smile.

Ahuici quickly begged for mercy, his quick reaction amusing Chen Donghe so much that he even forgot about his own embarrassment earlier.

The aroma of roasted yams filled the air as Li Xiangping savored his meal. It reminded him of his younger days when he and his elder brother, Li Changhu, would secretly roast yams by the fire pit. Li Changhu always found ways to make him snacks back when he was just a twelve or thirteen-year-old boy.

Beside him, Li Qiuyang scanned their surroundings with caution, ever watchful for the piercing gaze of the eagle eyes in the sky. His gaze then fell upon Li Xiangping, his eyes brimming with profound reverence.

Li Xiangping has led them through countless perilous situations and has achieved remarkable victories. Just as the people of Mount Yue revered Jianixi as their king, Li Xiangping’s soldiers believed their leader to be invincible.

While everyone’s attention was on Li Xiangping, he suddenly dropped the yam he was eating which fell onto the ground with a thud. His expression was frozen in disbelief.

The Evade Death Prolong Life talisman qi, which had crossed his mind countless times in moments of crisis and peril, suddenly illuminated brightly. A profound sense of danger gripped Li Xiangping as he glimpsed a vision of himself kneeling on the ground, blood spewing from his mouth, surrounded by desperate cries for help.

“I’m going to die... There’s no escaping it...,” he gasped quietly, “There’s no delaying it!”

He felt a chill run down his spine and immediately felt lightheaded.

Hands trembling, he snatched the map from Chen Donghe and grabbed a piece of burning charcoal from the fire pit with his bare hands. Closing his eyes for a moment, he began scribbling on the map.

“Great King!” Chen Donghe was flabbergasted and did not know what to do, falling onto his knees helplessly as he watched Li Xiangping worryingly.

After Li Xiangping had finished scribbling on the map, he shoved a transparent pearl into his hand.

“Mu Jiaoman will definitely be back after I’m gone. Follow this path eastward to return home!” he instructed hastily, his voice filled with curt urgency.

But before Chen Donghe could respond, Li Xiangping cut him off.

“No matter what happens, you must deliver this pearl to Li Tongya!” he hissed through tightly gritted teeth.
𝕗𝕣𝐞𝐞𝘄𝐞𝚋𝚗𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗹.𝚌𝕠𝚖

“Everyone!” Li Xiangping rose to his feet, ignoring Chen Donghe’s stunned silence.

“After I’m gone, all of you must head east with Donghe. Do not linger here!” he commanded loudly, his voice full of conviction.

Li Qiuyang and the others were at a loss for words, watching as Li Xiangping’s voice grew softer as he sank to the ground weakly.

“Great King!”

“Family Head!”

Li Xiangping lifted his gaze and watched the blazing sun in the sky as an array of illusions danced before him. It was as though a piece of the sun itself had broken off, hurtling toward him like a shooting star.

The broken piece burned brightly before landing on his chest, scalding his senses. He once roasted a chief from Mount Yue alive and now... the same pain and agony consumed him.

“Great King!”

The world darkened around Li Xiangping. Although he could not see anything, he felt someone’s weight on his body and wet tears falling onto his cheeks.

Despite the agony, a faint smile tugged at his lips.

“What a low blow...” he murmured weakly.

Li Xiangping’s long hair fell in disarray, revealing sparse white strands. He has lived to an age where ordinary farmers would have had grandchildren of their own and would have suffered very few grievances in life.

Yet... the only thing on his mind was the Li Family, surviving amidst myriad forces.

From the void emerged thick black qi, enveloping his gray-black eyes and withering his body. Li Xiangping coughed up black blood.

“I’ve... lived a great life!” he proclaimed with all his might, his voice hoarse and strained.

Memories flashed before him before finally settling on a meandering river where a teenager had just caught a green-tailed fish, then picked up a broken bluish-gray mirror with a curious look on his face. The sunlight illuminated his face and a dazzling smile graced his lips.

The black qi dissipated as quickly as it had appeared, snaking its way back into the void as Li Xiangping’s body withered completely.

However, a gray light suddenly burst forth from Li Xiangping’s Shenyang Mansion.

Every last trace of the black qi was absorbed by the talisman qi in his Shenyang Mansion like a hungry ghost devouring a feast.

Only Li Xiangping’s withered corpse remained kneeling on the ground, a final white light exuding from his Qihai acupoint before gently fading into the void too.

Almost instantly, the crowd let out a loud cry in unison.

“It’s a curse! He was killed by a curse! Jianixi, you coward!” Ahuici cried out in anguish.

“Family Head!”

Chen Donghe wept before Li Xiangping’s body, clenching his fists with such might that they bled.

Sobs filled the air as Li Qiuyang made his way forward, eyes red and glistening.

The sound of flapping wings suddenly filled the air, silencing Chen Donghe’s cries. He was stunned for a moment before immediately pressing his ears to Li Xiangping’s chest.

“Everyone, quiet!” he yelled at the crowd with a deep frown as he tried to focus. The cries and commotion immediately ceased at his command, and after listening for a few moments, he carefully laid Li Xiangping’s body on the ground.

With trembling hands, Chen Donghe placed his fingers gently on Li Xiangping’s pale lips. He applied a little force to part them and immediately heard the flapping noises growing louder.

Ahuici and Li Qiuyang, standing on opposite sides of his body, were visibly stunned. They, too, kneeled down to check.

Buzzzz...

With a sudden force, Chen Donghe watched as a grayish-black locust burst out violently from Li Xiangping’s mouth. Its body was adorned with barbs, the patterns on its wings resembling leaves.

It bounced in Chen Donghe’s hand for a moment before taking flight, its wings flapping rapidly as it whizzed away.

“This is...”

“Locusts! So many locusts!”

The people shouted in alarm as thousands of grayish-black locusts emerged from Li Xiangping’s body, soaring into the sky like a dark storm. People stumbled backward in pain as the swarm of locusts flew past them, their barbs hurting their skin.

“Donghe... This is...” Ahuici’s voice slowly trailed off.

Chen Donghe, with tears still streaming down his face, grabbed Li Xiangping’s Ebony Bow and cast a glance at the disappearing corpse.

As the locusts slowly escaped into the night sky, Chen Donghe gritted his teeth in anger.

“Move out! Don’t let them catch you!” he commanded fiercely.

Meanwhile on Mount Lijing...

A bright, gleaming white pearl emerged abruptly from the void, before returning back into the mirror on the stone platform which stirred up a flurry of pale moonlight.

Just then, a sigh echoed through the courtyard.

“Li Xiangping, it has been twenty-five or six years since you last picked me up...”

The memory of the boy who was catching fish in the river remained vivid in Lu Jiangxian’s mind, but the boy had fallen to the west.

Lu Jiangxian felt a whirlwind of emotions in him, threatening to spill out at any moment. Before the words could form on his lips, he found himself at a loss... his words drowned out by emotions.

He felt a surge in his divine sense and mana as the information recorded in the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed flowed into the mirror.

Li Xiangping had perished because of a curse. His cultivation had stopped at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, but the amount of mana that came from the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed greatly exceeded Lu Jiangxian’s expectations.

“The feedback from the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed seems to not only be related to cultivation but surprisingly also involves intangible aspects such as luck and fortune. He absorbed Jianixi’s fortune and siphoned Mount Yue’s blessings.”

Light gathered in Lu Jiangxian’s mirror, and the Supreme Yin Profound Light was also dancing around it... its power was now strong enough to vanquish cultivators at the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm.

The increased mana capacity allowed him to release five beams of Supreme Yin Profound Light consecutively, which was enough to confront a cultivator of the Foundation Establishment Realm—though he would need three days to recover afterward.

“The black qi of that curse was converted from talisman qi... I wonder if it changed after the talisman qi within Li Xiangping’s body devoured it.”

Lu Jiangxian has spent the past few days in the courtyard, studying the structure of the curse, but progress was slow. Fortunately, he did not require sustenance nor did he require sleep, hence he was able to devote over a decade to his studies without the need for haste.

“That pearl though...”

Lu Jiangxian gulped. His desires had diminished greatly since becoming an artifact spirit, and he made every effort to focus on the activities at the foot of the mountain to keep his emotions and priorities in check.

Yet... the precious pearl Li Xiangping had acquired stirred an unexpected longing deep within him.

Outside the courtyard...

Li Tongya was teaching Li Xuanling swordsmanship when a shiver suddenly overcame him, causing him to stop abruptly.

“What’s wrong, Father?”

Li Tongya furrowed his brow as unease crept into his body.

“Nothing,” he replied after a brief pause, waving his hand dismissively.

I better have a grand formation set up on Mount Lijing as soon as possible... I feel vulnerable without a reliable formation for protection.

Clang!

The sudden impact on the door and windows drew the attention of Li Tongya and Li Xuanling instantly.

Li Xuanling approached cautiously and opened the window, revealing a scrawny grayish-black locust that had crashed into it. Its upper half had been smashed against the window, prompting him to peel it off from the glass suspiciously before turning back to face his father.

Li Tongya already knew that it was a locust with the help of his spiritual sense, but he felt an inexplicable sadness as he examined the locust more closely.

“Huh?”

Under Li Tongya’s analysis, the locust revealed no trace of demonic energy, yet a strangely familiar sensation lingered.

“Let’s venture into the mountains again tomorrow and see if we can gather any information about Xiangping.”

Shaking off the unsettling feeling, Li Tongya stretched out and tossed the locust out of the window.

“Don’t lose focus now... read the Profound Water Sword Technique manual carefully,” he urged his son gently, an unreadable expression on his face.

However, as soon as those words left his mouth, the noise of a commotion reached his ears. Li Xuanxuan entered happily, cradling a bundle in his arms.

“Second Uncle!” he exclaimed.

Li Tongya’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.

“Is it a boy or a girl?” he immediately asked, hardly able to hide the joy in his face.

Li Xuanxuan had married a woman from a different clan with a spiritual orifice two years ago. However, she was not really gifted in cultivation and had only condensed the Profound Scenery Chakra, thus attaining only the first stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.

Li Xiangping had also picked a few beautiful mortal women for Li Xuanxuan to take as his concubines, and now... this child marked the first direct descendant of the Li Family’s third generation.

“It’s a boy!”

Li Xuanxuan could not contain the smile on his face as he cradled the baby closer.

Seeing this, Li Tongya chuckled fondly.

“This is our Li Family’s first third-generation heir. Have you thought of a name yet?” he asked.

“According to the generation name, it should include Yuan!” Li Xuanxuan said as he laughed softly, playing with his child for a moment before getting lost in his thoughts.

“I’ll name him Li Yuanxiu,” he said finally.

“Li Yuanxiu...” Li Tongya repeated thoughtfully, before nodding approvingly.

“That’s a good name,” he remarked fondly as he glanced at the child once more.

“How many children did your concubine bear?”

Li Tongya’s sudden question prompted Li Xuanxuan to look up. “A boy and a girl, they’re three and five this year,” he replied.
𝗳𝐫𝚎𝗲𝚠𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝘃𝚎𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺

Li Tongya fell deep into thought before speaking.

“In the future, the direct descendants of our Li Family will be part of the major sect... the children of the concubines without spiritual orifices will be assigned to the minor sect, and the ones with spiritual orifices will be part of the major sect, along with the direct descendants. For the children of those in the minor sect, the ones without spiritual orifices will form the branches, while those with spiritual orifices will be reinstated into the major sect,” he spoke with a degree of solemnness in his voice.

Li Xuanxuan took a moment to digest the information before finally nodding in understanding.

“There are more than two thousand members in Ye Clan now. What do we do with the children with spiritual orifices from those in the branches?” he asked.

“They’ll be part of the minor sects... that’s as far as they can go,” Li Tongya answered after a moment of contemplation.

Considering Li Qiuyang’s current status as a branch member of the Li Clan, if he were to father a son with spiritual orifices, he could be reinstated into a minor sect. However... if his first grandson possessed spiritual orifices, he would not be able to be reinstated into the major sect.

“This ensures that all members of the major sect are direct descendants of grandfather...” Li Xuanxuan said slowly, finally realizing the reasoning behind the system.

Li Tongya’s uneasy expression caught his attention.

“Is something wrong, Second Uncle?” he asked, slightly hesitant.

With a weary look on his face, Li Tongya sighed deeply before speaking once more.

“I’m still worried about Xiangping... I’ll take advantage of the night and make a trip to the west. You stay here and watch over the family.”
