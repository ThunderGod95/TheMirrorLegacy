# Chapter 1048: Crushed

"Dragon King…"

Chi Buzi watched the distant chase for a moment but quickly lost interest. It was just a few minor cultivators squabbling. He turned his attention back to the great dragon beside him.

With a single step, the creature of the Hornless Dragon lineage summoned a table and chairs of jade-white emerald from the surface of the water. A flagon of spirit wine rested silently on the tabletop. The Demon beast sat and gestured with a smile.

"Please."

Chi Buzi took his seat with composure. The Demon beast’s smile remained.

"At a banquet today, the Monarchs were discussing how the Undefeated King of Brightness gave birth to all manner of evils. The elders in my clan performed divinations and concluded that such a thing could only happen because the monarch-father was unwell, his yang energy stagnating. This piqued my curiosity, so I made a special trip to see for myself."

He raised his cup and nodded to the Great Daoist Master before turning his gaze to the horizon.

"I never thought I would run into you, Master," he said coolly. "Why don't we watch together? Once this little drama concludes, we can speak properly."

A flicker of interest appeared in Chi Buzi’s venomous eyes. He smiled.

"This humble cultivator is at your service."

The sea and sky were a brilliant, clear blue.

The storm had subsided as quickly as it had appeared, leaving the heavens bright and sunny. Li Jiangnian set the two cultivators he held onto the ground and retracted his true essence.

"The winds here are fierce and the waters are teeming with Demon beasts," he said softly.

"You two are only of mixed-qi. You must be more careful next time; you won't always be lucky enough to run into me."

The two men immediately dropped to their knees, weeping with a thousand thanks.

"Honorable elder… we will never forget this for as long as we live! You saved our lives!"

They had been traveling through the sea when they were suddenly caught in a demonic squall. They owed their survival entirely to his intervention. Who would have thought such a kind soul existed in the Eastern Sea? Their gratitude was boundless, a testament to their incredible fortune.

Li Jiangnian stood where he was, basking in the warmth of their tearful thanks. A pleasant sense of satisfaction washed over him.

He knew they weren't good men. As a scion of an Immortal Clan, he could tell at a glance that they regularly consumed blood-food. But then, how many cultivators in the Eastern Sea didn't? It made no difference to him. All he cared about were these few words of genuine, heartfelt gratitude.

When their thanks had run dry, Li Jiangnian adopted a lofty posture and spoke gently,

"I have saved you today, so you must no longer consume blood-food. Focus on performing good deeds and accumulating merit. Your virtue will surely be rewarded."

The two men on the ground exchanged a peculiar look, but they quickly agreed, 

"Yes, yes, of course." 

They watched the masked young master ride the wind and soar away before they began to whisper animatedly.

"Was that… the Jade Young Master from the reef isles?"

The other man nodded with conviction. "It had to be him. That kind of talk about not partaking of the mortal world… sounds exactly like something he'd say. We’re lucky, brother. We got out of that with our lives. I hear he’s generous, kind-hearted, and easy to get along with. With this connection… maybe we can get a spot under his command and sip some of the meat broth…"

His companion’s eyes lit up, but his expression remained a bit strange.

"His behavior is bizarre, though… No blood-food, performing good deeds… Does that sound like a cultivator from the Eastern Sea? He talks about good being rewarded, but the real reward is the wealth he has to share. All the people he helps end up clinging to him, praising him like he's their own father…"

"That's enough!"

The words sent a chill down his companion's spine. He grabbed his friend's arm, his face pale.

"We’re too badly injured," he whispered urgently. "I've never been to this island, but it looks inhabited. Let's find the locals and get a few households' worth of blood-food to recover."

While the two demonic cultivators schemed, the renowned Jade Young Master was already humming a tune as he soared through the sky, feeling utterly pleased with himself.

In truth, Li Jiangnian was a coward. In his early days, he had been terrified of leaving home, certain he would be murdered. But when he finally ventured out, he discovered that no one recognized him. He lacked the golden eyes, the aura of Bright Yang dharma power, and the dignified bearing of his clan. Even if he claimed to be the son of King Wei, no one would believe him.

Coming to the Eastern Sea all these years ago had been an immense relief. He fashioned a mask for himself and lived a life of leisure. The islanders all respected him. For the first few years, Li Que'wan would still force him to practice his spell arts, but then his older sister went into seclusion to cultivate a secret technique. Finally, no one was left to control him!

Only then did he truly taste the wonderful life of an immortal scion. A single call brought a hundred responses; no one dared to defy him. Though he was timid and still mindful of the rules from his life back at the lake, never daring to parade around the island with a large entourage, he was clever. Under the guise of training, he traveled far and wide, helping rogue cultivators and collecting their fawning praise.

Sometimes, when he was in a foul mood and his hands itched for action, he would seek out islands with weak defenses. Relying on his superior strength, he would pretend he was about to launch a massacre to eradicate demonic cultivators. He would wait until the cultivators who consumed blood-food kowtowed desperately, crippling their own cultivation, and then, after savoring their pleas and flattery, he would depart magnanimously. Even if word of his actions spread, he was seen as a paragon of righteousness. He had even earned the title of the Jade Young Master.

Compared to this, his old life by the lake had been nothing but misery!
Though he occasionally felt a pang of guilt, aware of his own ugly thoughts, the feeling of absolute power was more intoxicating than any brothel or gambling den. He would quickly cast the regrets aside. Now, as he rode the wind contentedly, he squinted and saw a fierce streak of Merging Fire in the distance.

"Hm?"

Li Jiangnian narrowed his eyes. As he channeled his true essence, the form within the Merging Fire became clear, startling him.

'A cultivator…'

The man was ferocious, his face covered in brutish muscle. He wore a black daoist robe, and his expression was savage. In his hand, he held a circular dharma artifact that pulsed with the thick light of Merging Fire.

Fleeing before the fire was a silver streak of escaping light. Within it was a young woman with delicate eyebrows and red lips. Her cheeks were slightly full, making her exceptionally pretty. Her dharma robes were gone, leaving her in a thin white shift that revealed a graceful and alluring figure.

But she was clearly injured. Her face was as pale as paper, and blood stained her lips, giving her a pitiful, heart-wrenching appearance. She gasped for breath.

'This should be the right direction… Deer Weeds Island…'

Guo Gemei’s heart was pounding with terror.

Her family needed to repair their Great Purple Mansion Formation and was short on materials. The younger generation, under their parents' orders, had taken spirit items to various market cities to make purchases. It shouldn't have been a life-threatening task; she had done it more than once. But somehow… after a few minor disputes with this man, he now wanted to kill her!

She knew he was a cultivator from Crimson Reef Island, and she knew her own clan had always warned her that those from Crimson Reef were not to be trifled with. She had swallowed her pride and held her tongue. She never imagined that a single retort would earn her a death sentence!

'The Moongaze Li Clan is an ally of my family, and I've rested on Deer Weeds before… If I can just make it there… someone will save me!'

She fought desperately for her life, but Li Jiangnian, watching from above, paused and understood the situation at once.

'So, a chase between two minor cultivators…'

Neither of them was very powerful. Li Jiangnian observed them coldly for a few moments and recognized the man's attire.

'Merging Fire… he's from Crimson Reef Island. My family has never been on good terms with them. And today, he just so happens to fall into my hands.'

He immediately soared into the air. Spreading his five fingers, he summoned the rolling winds. A jade-like color crept over his body, transforming into a dazzling suit of jade armor. His stooped figure was completely hidden beneath this immortal foundation, giving him the sudden appearance of a handsome and heroic figure, as elegant as a jade tree in the wind.

_Jade Court General_!

With a thought, a jade spear materialized in his palm. Li Jiangnian raised his arm and threw it with all his might.

_Voom…_

The jade spear shot forward like an arrow of light, arriving in an instant. The brutish man was only at the Qi Refining realm; how could he possibly withstand such an attack? He had no time to react. He looked down abruptly to see the spear had pierced through his chest, leaving nothing but an empty cavity.

He couldn't utter a single word. A futile spurt of blood escaped his lips before he exploded into countless flames in mid-air, raining down from the sky. Guo Gemei was already at her limit. The sudden turn of events left her both terrified and overjoyed. But then, a vast wave of Jade True light swept over her. She coughed up a mouthful of blood, the magical wind beneath her feet faltered, and she began to plummet.

In a flash, an arm that seemed forged from solid jade caught her. Overwhelmed with fear, Guo Gemei could only cry out, "Thank you, Senior!"

A gentle, youthful voice replied,

"There is no need for thanks. Crimson Reef Island and my Deer Weeds have long been enemies. It was merely a small effort!"

"Deer Weeds?!"

Guo Gemei now understood why he had helped her. A wave of shock and joy washed over her, followed by a strange fluttering in her heart. Hearing that soft, young voice, a blush rose to her cheeks. She pursed her red lips, her own voice becoming delicate.

"So you are the Young Master of the immortal isle!"

Her words sent a rush of heat to the back of Li Jiangnian’s head. Guo Gemei was truly beautiful. As she lay softly in his arms, the smooth, snow-white skin of her neck was exposed, forcing him to swallow hard.

The Jade True shockwave had, of course, been deliberate. He wanted her to fall right into his embrace—wasn't that how it always happened in the storybooks?

Guo Gemei was a few years older than him and saw through his ploy. She smiled knowingly, and Li Jiangnian immediately blushed. But his mind raced, and he quickly averted his gaze, feigning awkwardness.

"My apologies… Miss. My family is very strict. I have been cultivating alone for over thirty years… and have given little thought to the propriety between men and women…"

'A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator at thirty!'

As Li Jiangnian shifted, Guo Gemei instinctively wrapped her arm around his. She knit her brows and let out a few soft hums.

"It hurts…"

Li Jiangnian immediately raised his hand and said with a serious expression, 

"Let me heal your injuries."

With a slightly trembling hand, he placed his palm on her neck. A surge of Jade True dharma power flowed into her, causing her face to flush an even deeper red. However, while the _Jade Court General_ ability was powerful, it possessed no healing properties; in fact, it could even hinder recovery. Li Jiangnian was unskilled in this area to begin with, and he was afraid of hurting her. He focused his full attention on the task, cold sweat beading beneath his mask.

Guo Gemei, however, was oblivious. The mask completely hid the man's face. How could she know that this Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was struggling with her minor injuries? The cool, jade-like touch lingered on her neck, making her blush deepen.

His dharma power surged through her limbs, a distinctly sensitive feeling. And the external manifestation of the _Jade Court General_ was that of a mighty, heroic, and dashing immortal general. For a moment, Guo Gemei's heart was thrown into turmoil.

'The disciples from the Southern Sea that Father found for me… how could any of them compare to a young master from an Immortal Clan? And one so tall and powerful…'

In that moment, as if guided by fate, she raised her hand. Her slender, jade-like fingers touched the man's mask. She stared at him intently, causing Li Jiangnian to freeze. He looked back at her, dumbfounded, his heart pounding as he lost himself in the moment.

It wasn't that Li Jiangnian had never been with a woman. Though his family was strict, after coming to the Eastern Sea, plenty of women had thrown themselves at him. But he was born ugly, and he was an extremely sensitive person. He saw the revulsion in their eyes, which always left him feeling dejected and resentful.

'This is too perfect… to have a woman look at me with such tenderness. It should stay this way forever…'

He had always thought that gaining the world's approval was his life's greatest dream. But seeing the look in her eyes, that desire was met with a strange, more extreme form of satisfaction. It left him trembling, lost in a daze from which he could not escape.

Then, he felt a coolness on his face.

Guo Gemei, her heart filled with amorous feelings, had removed his mask.

The woman's affectionate pupils dilated to their absolute limit. The lingering tenderness had not yet faded. She took a deep breath, a swallowing motion freezing halfway down her throat before being suppressed. Her expression twisted into a look of disgust so profound it was horrifying.

If his father Li Zhouwei’s allure was an unearned gift from the heavens, an effect of his Metallic Essence that made people naturally fall for him, then Li Jiangnian’s ugliness was, in a way, just as powerful. Even though the Jade True power was adept at transformation, and he had spent the first half of his life trying to change his appearance, the result was still an innate, uncontrollable ugliness that repulsed people on sight—and in this moment, he had no time to use any artifice to conceal it.

This very ugliness had made Li Jiangnian an expert in reading expressions. His swollen, narrow eyes easily caught her look of barely suppressed nausea. The man's face twitched, twisting the lingering smile on his lips into a chaotic mess.

It made him even uglier, yet a sliver of hope remained in his eyes.

Guo Gemei desperately tore her gaze away. A strained smile appeared on her deathly pale face. Her hands, now hard as stone, pushed against his chest. Her once-soft body went rigid.

"Young Master," she said woodenly, "I am fine now."

He had been through this a hundred, a thousand times before. But this time, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. When this perfect moment shattered into a million pieces, what rose from the depths of his heart was not sorrow or dejection, but a terrifying, electrifying storm of rage.

'Bitch!! Bitch, bitch, bitch!'

His pupils, patterned with the texture of jade, instantly turned bloodshot. The hand that had rested on her tender neck as gently as a lover's suddenly clenched. Her delicate flesh, like tofu, burst between his fingers, splattering everywhere.

A look of stunned horror was frozen on Guo Gemei's face as her head flew high into the air. Her lovely chest and graceful body exploded, reduced to an unrecognizable paste in the furious cultivator's grasp, unleashing a rain of blood!

In the space of a breath, she had been crushed to smithereens by a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator.

The splattered blood coated his Jade True form. The blood-soaked immortal cultivator held her lone head in his hands and let out a hysterical roar.

"How could you?! How could you! I saved you… I saved you! You were supposed to love me, you bitch!"

The flesh on the severed head disintegrated into ash amidst his roars, splattering across his face and hair in a mess of red and white. All that remained was a delicate, pretty skull, the pale-white ligaments contracting, reflected in his eyes.

Li Jiangnian froze.

He frowned distractedly, as if trying to identify what he was holding. In an instant, the skull felt like a red-hot branding iron, and he dropped it as if struck by lightning.

"..."

Li Jiangnian staggered back a few steps in mid-air, a chill seeping into his very bones. He stumbled onto a reef below, landing like a bewildered pelican, standing numbly in the water.

"Bitch…"

In a daze, he hurriedly looked down and began to wash his hands with trembling fingers in the seawater that came up to his waist. He scrubbed for a long time, but the bloodstains in the crevices of his hands would not come clean. Only then did he belatedly retract his immortal foundation and stand there, blankly.

His reflection in the water showed a figure in a white robe, without a single speck of red. As the miraculous power faded, the woman's flesh and bone had already been cleansed away by his dharma power.

Still, the man took off the robe and threw it into the sea, watching it drift away like a departing spirit. He put on an identical one, then stared at his reflection for a moment. His own face nearly made him vomit. He quickly fumbled in his sleeve for his mask, but his hands were shaking so badly he couldn't get a grip. It fell from his left hand to his right, then slipped into the water. After several attempts, Li Jiangnian finally managed to place it back on his face.

The sun was setting rapidly in the distance, painting a beautiful scene across the sea and sky. Li Jiangnian hid his cold hands in his sleeves and stared blankly at the water's surface, suddenly feeling as if he were trapped in a deep dream.

_Gurgle…_

In the twilight dusk, a ripple disturbed the calm water. The woman's bleached skull was pushed back by the waves, bobbing to the surface like a playful fish. A few shreds of red flesh clinging to it swayed in the current, looking all the more crimson in the light of the setting sun.
