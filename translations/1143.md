# Chapter 1143: A Blade Astray, A Son Exchanged

A searing radiance filled the air, tinged with a crimson glow as rich as blood.

Within the pavilion, yin and yang qi churned ceaselessly around a man seated in cross-legged meditation. His lips were ruby-red, his teeth impossibly white. A storm of gray and white light swirled in his eyes, and his hands, resting on his knees, were clasped in a sacred lotus seal.

Li Ximing gazed at the figure before him, a flicker of satisfaction in his eyes.

This was his Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.

Having acquired water from the Xuanmiao Great Treasury's Spring of Rebirth, he had used the Surrogate Body Ascension Art to finally refine it into this vessel. The Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was now astonishingly lifelike. Beyond the vibrant color of its lips and teeth, its complexion was brighter, making it nearly a perfect replica of Li Ximing himself.

He took a step forward and activated a spell art. The Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body raised a hand, revealing fingers as flawless as jade. With a gentle pinch, the skin broke, and beads of crimson blood welled up.

'The Spring of Rebirth has entered its hundred bones, transforming into its flesh, bones, and marrow. It is complete.'

This meant that his external incarnation had finally moved beyond the realm of a mere clay statue, touching upon the ability to evade disaster and ward off evil.

He closed his eyes slightly and sat down in meditation to compose himself. The Light of the Six Harmonies rose like a brilliant, iridescent cloud, mingling with a thick Heavenly Light before pouring into the glabella of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body before him.

The statue trembled. Its nostrils flared slightly, and the color drained from its eyes, leaving them completely blank. It stood up and took two somewhat stiff steps, but its movements quickly became natural.

'It can be used for research, alchemy, meditation… And if I were to animate it with the unique companion-to-gods ability of my World's Radiance, I could even use it for battle. Fighting a Purple Mansion cultivator would be difficult, but it could probably handle a few Merciful Ones…'

Li Ximing tested its capabilities one by one, his eyes widening in amazement as he began to grasp its potential.

'This Spring of Rebirth is truly remarkable. It seems to have more than just the ability to evade disaster; it feels almost like a true, mobile body.'

In Li Ximing's view, the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body was still fundamentally a clay statue, one that had merely been touched by the qualities of gilded refinement and disaster evasion. An ancient cultivator would have likely dismissed it as an unorthodox and impractical creation. But in the current era, when combined with the animating power of his World's Radiance, it was quite formidable.

'Although animating it with World's Radiance would consume the Light of the Six Harmonies from this divine ability, making it unworthy for use against mere Merciful Ones, and this alternate body is too precious to risk in battle… but time is on my side, is it not? With the Surrogate Body Ascension Art, there is still room for it to grow.'

'For now, using it to evade disaster and ward off evil is its proper path.'

With a flick of his wrist, the alternate body, a mirror image of himself, dissolved into light and drifted down, solidifying into a small statuette. It felt neither like wood nor porcelain, but glowed with a vibrant, exquisite beauty.

At that exact moment, two jade talismans—one large, one small—hanging from his waist flared with a simultaneous, scorching heat.

Li Zhouwei and Ting Province were both sending warnings!

Li Ximing froze for a bare instant, then his heart seized with alarm. He took a single step out of the pavilion door, his ears filling with the roar of flames. The man in crimson robes was startled awake at the same time, his expression grave as he looked immediately to Li Ximing.

Without a second thought, Li Ximing commanded,

"You're to exit the grotto-heaven and wait within the formation. I'll go out first."

Then, the sun and moon receded, and the light around him submerged. Daoist Master Zhaojing dissipated the aura around him, his figure materializing over the surface of the vast lake.

By now, the lake waters were a gloomy, dark expanse. Inky black clouds rolled in from the north, and the sky, once filled with esacpe lights, was now empty. The appearance of Li Ximing's Heavenly Light on the horizon was like a calming balm, instantly easing the oppressive atmosphere.

But Li Ximing's own expression grew more complicated.

On the northern horizon, a roiling barrier of Jade True brilliance blocked countless streaks of light. But pressing down against it was a torrent of Li Fire, a colossal waterfall of flame that stretched to the heavens. The two forces clashed violently. A jolt went through Li Ximing's heart.

"The northern cultivators are invading… Zhusheng is at the White River!"

Ever since the Great Song had taken control of most of Jianghuai, Moongaze Lake no longer had to face the northern conflicts directly. But if the northern cultivators had broken through to the White River, Li Ximing could not stand by and watch.

'Where is Minghuang? Where is Yang Ruiyi? If Zhusheng is at the White River, who is left to guard Tangdao?'

He didn't hesitate for a moment. He crossed his hands, gave a sharp twist, and snapped off his own index finger. Tossing it into his sleeve, he used Sealing the Life-Mandate. Only then did he ride the wind, soaring through the Great Void. As the dazzling Jade True light ahead grew brighter, he faced the oncoming dark clouds, took half a step forward, and while advancing, extended his spiritual sense to connect with the Immortal Mirror.

Spirit Probe!

The scene at the White River instantly became clear. The figure within the raging True Fire shone brightly. Dressed in golden robes, he sat calmly within a hexagonal pavilion formed from the True Fire itself, his fine beard dancing in the air, his eyes radiating a sharp brilliance.

'Shilou Yingge.'

The other stream of Jade True light, belonging to Liu Bai, was bright but wavered unstably. Fortunately, waves of Exiled Qi surged forth, and a great cauldron hung in the sky, neutralizing the various lights. This sight made Li Ximing's heart sink.

'But this Protector-General… his injuries haven't fully healed, have they…'

Liu Bai had been a meritorious official in the pacification of the Southern Sea, but he had paid a heavy price. The Yang clan had bestowed upon him many healing spiritual treasures, but Liu Bai did not possess the Sovereign's Perilous Tread. Moreover, the path of a Jade True cultivator was one of refinement and purity; recovery, no matter what, required time.

A sense of dread rose in Li Ximing's heart. But as the Spirit Probe continued, the scene within the Great Void unfolded before his eyes.

To the left stood a man with a sanctimonious air, wearing a tall crown and broad-sashed, flowing black robes. His eyes were closed, and he held a brightly lit halberd, its colors frozen and interwoven with Profound Yellow Qi. His other hand held a large, luminous seal, poised to strike.

To the right was a tall, powerfully built man with a ferocious expression and a face covered in scars. He gripped a heavy, blood-colored axe that looked as if it might drip blood at any moment. More fatally, in his other hand, he held a small, high platform, its colors deep and concentrated with a terrifying amount of Dawn Qi.

'Touba Ci and Gongsun Bei!'

'The Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform!'

A chill shot through Li Ximing's mind.

'Is this ambush for me? Or for Minghuang?!'

The Xiguang Parting-Light Treasure Platform was a renowned Spiritual Treasure. Wielded by Gongsun Bei, with Touba Ci lying in wait—if he were to fall into their trap, Li Ximing would be utterly annihilated.

His heart went cold. The iridescent light at his feet slowed for a fraction of a second as a flicker of hesitation crossed his mind.

'This...'

But after that brief moment of indecision, Li Ximing’s heart calmed instantly. The Heavenly Light at his feet remained steady, continuing its course straight toward the Jade True radiance.

The situation on the battlefield was unknown. If he hadn't used Spirit Probe and had only known that two mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivators were waiting in ambush with a Spiritual Treasure, he would never have dared to advance. But precisely because Spirit Probe had shown him everything so clearly, he now dared to proceed.

He rode the light forward, drawing ever closer. Before he had even entered the spiritual sense range of an ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator, the lavishly dressed Daoist in the Great Void opened his eyes. A flash of Profound Yellow Qi appeared within them, his five fingers tightened around his halberd, and he turned his head to look.

This movement alerted Gongsun Bei. The iridescent light from the Spiritual Treasure in his hand flickered, and he whispered,

"Your Highness?"

Touba Ci observed for a moment, then narrowed his eyes and shook his head.

"Li Ximing."

The general considered this, then raised an eyebrow.

"Since it's not Li Zhouwei, perhaps we should wait a little longer."

Touba Ci's eyes reflected the unfolding scene. He didn't answer, but the Daoist Master in his vision had already halted, observing them in silence. This made the Liang descendant frown.

What neither of them expected was for the Jade True cultivator in the midst of the raging True Fire, who had appeared utterly focused and stern, to suddenly speak. His voice was like the chime of jade, crisp and clear,

"Is that Daoist Master Zhaojing? Do not come any closer!"

'Damn it!'

Gongsun Bei's expression changed drastically. A look of regret crossed his face, and his heart pounded. He had no time to ponder whether this was an ability of the Jade True divine ability, a sense from Martial Cultivation True Qi, or an effect of the jade wheel behind his opponent. He immediately raised the Spiritual Treasure.

But Touba Ci's halberd was faster.

The instant Liu Bai activated his divine ability, Touba Ci sensed it. The halberd slashed through the Great Void like lightning, unleashing a torrent of interwoven Profound Yellow Qi that surged across the void with murderous intent.

Before the iridescent light even reached him, a sense of crisis washed over Li Ximing. The Surrogate Body Ascension Art was constantly active, and its disaster-evading effect manifested, causing a numb heat to spread across his chest.

"Edict"

In a single thought, a wave of azure-yellow light rippled outward. Li Ximing's figure, blazing with Li Fire, shifted sideways by a single step, a ray of Supreme Yang Responding-to-Li light appearing in his palm.

Though there were two other Spiritual Treasures left with the Li family, the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument had long been given to Li Jiangqian, and the other, the Heavenly Nurture Urn, was not a defensive artifact. He could only rely on this less-than-brilliant spell art to defend himself. Fortunately, with the foresight, his movement techniques were proficient. He took that step, riding the Li Fire, and narrowly dodged the halberd's light.

The torrent of Profound Yellow Qi slammed into a small hill, leveling it. The Daoist Master, already prepared, immediately rode his light south. He reacted with incredible speed; Gongsun Bei, who had intended to raise the Spiritual Treasure, was forced to give chase instead.

Touba Ci's expression shifted, his gaze turning cold.

"Gongsun Bei!"

Gongsun Bei glanced back abruptly, catching the warning in his eyes.

Li Ximing knew nothing of the northern cultivators' plans, but how much did the three of them know of the Great Song's arrangements? They only knew to come south to suppress Li Zhouwei, but upon entering the White River, they had run into Liu Bai. And now, Li Ximing had appeared out of nowhere.

Where was Li Zhouwei?

To chase or not to chase?

A shadow passed over Gongsun Bei's face, but he didn't ponder for long. His voice was low.

"His Highness's meaning is… to kill Liu Bai first? Can we even kill him? With that Exiled Qi Spiritual Treasure, it won't be easy."

Touba Ci shot him a cold glance and said,

"And you think you can finish him off just by chasing him?"

Gongsun Bei's gaze was heavy. He glanced toward the far side of the lake and said softly,

"Lord Qi's intention was… to force out those few Wei descendants. Now that Li Ximing has appeared, where is Li Zhouwei? Liu Bai is injured, and his Exiled Qi is a tough nut to crack—strong in defense but weak in offense. Shilou Yingge is enough to handle him. If we pursue Li Ximing with our full strength, Li Zhouwei will have no choice but to show himself."

Hearing him bring up Qi Lanyan, Touba Ci was clearly displeased. But Gongsun Bei was no longer willing to waste time. He was already riding the Dawn Qi in pursuit, his low voice carried by a divine ability,

'If Moongaze Lake remains peaceful and Li Zhouwei escapes, the three of us will surely be blamed! But if we attack Ting Province and he isn't there, we can still blame it on the Song court's arrangements!'

Gongsun Bei had spent years navigating between various powers and was adept at such schemes. Touba Ci was used to acting domineeringly and, when forced to submit, was unaccustomed to such intricate thinking. However, he understood a simpler truth—without Gongsun Bei, he was useless here alone.

He rose upon the Profound Qi, his expression dark, and muttered coldly,

'Qi Lanyan, that fool who doesn't know how to delegate. I'd like to see what kind of mess he can make of this!'

...

Baiye.

Clouds and mist rolled as the light of the four realms was refined. The grand formation in the mountains fluctuated ceaselessly under the pressure of various divine abilities. A golden radiance shone upon the earth, revealing massive golden bodies one after another.

In the center was a thousand-eyed, pink form, its light overlapping in wondrous ways. To its left was one with swirling patterns and floating clouds; to its right, one riding a fierce tiger and wielding a long staff. The multicolored lights shone on an old man's face, causing him to narrow his eyes slightly.

The two colossal figures to the left and right were terrifying, but they were merely Nuzi and a newly ascended Maha Bashan of the Way of Great Desire. Situ Huo paid them little mind. His gaze swept past their golden bodies to settle on the thousand-eyed golden statue behind them, and on the young monk in mortal form who stood before it.

"Zhelu, Mingxiang…"

These two—one a Liangli Maha, the other a disciple of the master of Lotus Temple—were the main force of the Buddhist cultivators attacking Baiye.

Even so, the sharpness and vigilance in Situ Huo's eyes were not intense.

'Something's not right…'

It wasn't that the enemy was too strong or too weak, but that their strength was…awkwardly positioned.

'Mingxiang's skills are decent, and Zhelu is a Liangli. Although he can't compare to those from the more prosperous Buddhist traditions, he still has their blessings, making him only slightly weaker than a late-stage Purple Mansion cultivator… Even if they don't exert their full strength, together they are enough to threaten my life…'

'But I'm not the only one in Baiye. Tinglan is still by my side, and we have the protection of the grand formation… Yang Ruiyi would never fully trust me; someone must be on their way… How could they possibly take me down quickly?'

He, Situ Huo, possessed more than just the Blood-Omen Tower! He also had another Spiritual Treasure that had allowed him to escape perilous situations several times, the Monarch's Lost Sheep. Simply surrounding him with superior numbers would not give them an easy advantage.

He could only assume that Qi Lanyan's focus was not on Baiye. Feeling a mix of relief and a schadenfreude-like glee to watch the tigers fight from his mountain perch, he stepped into the air. The Blood-Omen Tower in his hand pulsed with a deep crimson light, as if drawn from the depths of hell, dyeing the sky a bloody scarlet.

Situ Huo's figure reappeared elsewhere, the long saber in his hand streaking across the sky, transforming into a gigantic blade of blood that descended upon Nuzi.

At the same time, a surging light of profound unity and white lightning erupted, stripping all other lights of their power and shattering the radiant light before the Maha, causing Nuzi's expression to change.

Double Destruction!

This was clearly the Maha's first encounter with Situ Huo. He had not expected his opponent to dare engage in close combat while heavily besieged. But as a trusted subordinate of the Peacock, his skills were not to be underestimated. He opened his great mouth and spat out a dusky-yellow Golden Land, filled with brewing illusions of infinite beauty.

Faced with the menacing blood blade, the dusky-yellow light shattered with a boom. An intensely rich brilliance burst forth, shaking the heavens and earth and forcing back all the bloody qi.

But the stalemate between brilliant light and blood qi did not last long. Tens of thousands of pink, illusory lights merged into one, forming a column of pink light that stretched from heaven to earth and suddenly slammed down.

"Boom!"

Zhelu was, after all, a Liangli of the Way of Emptiness. Though he wavered in the conflict between north and south, his abilities were considerable. The radiance from Situ Huo's slash with the Blood-Omen Tower was instantly pinned beneath the column of light, unable to move.

'A good chance!'

What followed was a dazzling treasure bracelet, a descending treasure sword, and a jade pestle like an emerald, each one having stored power for some time. The many golden bodies had attacked in unison.

But in that brief instant, the man's figure blurred slightly, and the many spell arts and Enlightened Artifacts that had locked onto his aura all faltered.

"Boom!"

The numerous spell arts missed their mark, exploding in a thick cloud of brilliant light, but the old man was nowhere to be seen. Situ Huo reappeared in the distance, a wide smile on his face, and shouted,

"King Wei has arrived!"

These four words struck like a clap of heavenly thunder. Below, the many Merciful Ones coordinating their assault on the grand formation and the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion fell into disarray. A guilty look flashed across Zhelu’s face while Nuzi was visibly terrified. For a brief moment, all the resplendent light in the sky seemed to freeze, and there was even a brief, strange silence.

The golden figure did not appear. Nuzi, having just been attacked and then frightened, became enraged with humiliation and roared,

"Idiot! That Qilin can't even leave the lake!"

This shout, filled with confidence, instantly steadied the hearts of the many Merciful Ones. They let out a soaring Buddhist chant,

"Great Desire is Limitless!"

"First Gain, Then Lose!"

But then, the mountain-sized, thousand-eyed golden body suddenly shuddered and let out an earth-shattering roar. Nuzi's face, covered in golden script, abruptly froze. He snapped his head up.

A pair of golden eyes were reflected in the pupils of his golden body.

The sun, moon, and stars in the sky began to fade at an alarming speed. A vast darkness enveloped them, and a gigantic setting sun descended from the horizon, stripping the golden bodies of their radiance. A sandstorm of swirling dust and the glint of broken, blood-stained armor swept through, blowing the brilliant light away.
