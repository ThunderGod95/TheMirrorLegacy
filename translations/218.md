# Chapter 235: Chi Wei

"I dare not forget." Li Tongya nodded.

Xiao Yuansi placed his tea bowl down, saying warmly, "Our two families should establish a marriage alliance and support each other...Does the Li Family currently have any unmarried direct descendants?"

"Indeed, we do," Li Tongya replied respectfully and used his mana to send a voice transmission to Li Xuanxuan.

"Bring up all of the Yuan and Qing generation... except for Qinghong and Yuanyun."

Li Xuanxuan hurried off to make the arrangements while Xiao Yuansi studied Li Tongya carefully and said with a smile, "If I'm not mistaken, you have established your immortal foundation through the River One Qi Technique, which we traded with your family. It should be called Boundless Ocean."

"That's right," Li Tongya replied, cupping his fist.

Xiao Yuansi became serious and said, "Achieving one's immortal foundation is significant. Since you have succeeded, I should give you some advice."

"Please do, Senior!"

Seeing Li Tongya respond earnestly, Xiao Yuansi sipped his tea and said softly, "Boundless Ocean and our Man On Creek share the same origin, these two immortal foundations are closely related. If you encounter a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator with either immortal foundation, be extremely careful!"

Li Tongya looked up, immediately thought of something and asked, "Are there any taboos?"

Xiao Yuansi nodded and continued, "Boundless Ocean and Man On Creek are types of immortal foundations that the ancient Daoists called Dao Partners... Demonic and devil cultivators refer to them as Shared Pills. Such immortal foundations have many connections and can complement each other, however, If you meet someone with impure intentions, they are likely to..."

Xiao Yuansi paused, struggling to find the right words.

"They might... dig out your own immortal foundation and consume it to supplement theirs," he finished his sentence.

"Consume..?"

Li Tongya was silent for a moment before asking quietly, "Senior, how common is this practice?"

"Not common," Xiao Yuansi replied as he shook his head and explained, "First, this method is risky and may cause madness. Moreover, it is hard to find Dao Partners... Consuming them requires considerable skill in alchemy. Second, although it greatly enhances one's cultivation and makes the immortal foundation more marvelous, the person will be stuck at Foundation Establishment Realm and will not be able to advance to the Purple Mansion Realm. Only those who have no hope of breaking through and are desperate might attempt such a feat."

Li Tongya sighed softly and asked Xiao Yuansi, "Senior, which types of immortal foundations are considered Dao Partners of Boundless Ocean?"

Xiao Yuansi folded his sleeves and replied, "The first is Darkening Clouds, the second is Boundless Ocean, the third is Man On Creek, the fourth is Holding the Ridge, and the fifth is Grieving River Departure."

Seeing Li Tongya carefully noting them down, Xiao Yuansi transmitted more information to him with mana.

"These immortal foundations are also coveted by Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. However, to claim an immortal foundation, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator must first carefully cultivate and implant a Dao seed starting from Qi Cultivation Realm... We do not need to worry about that."

"I understand, Senior," Li Tongya nodded, finally realizing why Chejing had been targeted by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Azure Pond Sect. He sighed softly and smiled bitterly. "A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator may improve their cultivation by stealing an immortal foundation, but they struggle to advance to Purple Mansion Realm... There must also be hidden consequences for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who take one!"

Xiao Yuansi nodded curtly and became more cautious in discussing the topic, speaking in a low voice, "With proper preparation, Purple Mansion Realm cultivators can gain significant power by taking an immortal foundation. Although it is not as perfect as one cultivated by oneself, it drastically shortens their cultivation time. Naturally, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators seek it eagerly..."

While they were whispering, Li Xuanxuan arrived with the others. Li Yuanjiao held Li Qingxiao's hand while Li Xuanxuan's wife followed with Li Yuanping in her arms.

Li Tongya smiled, "These are the juniors of the Yuan and Qing generation in our family. Please take a look, Senior."

The two children looked nervously at Xiao Yuansi. Li Yuanjiao stepped forward and said respectfully, "Greetings from Junior Li Yuanjiao, Senior!"

Xiao Yuansi glanced over them, focusing on Li Yuanjiao, who at just seventeen or eighteen had already reached the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. He nodded.

"Li Yuanjiao... that's a good name."

Li Tongya added, "There was originally another eldest child, but he was assassinated by the Yu Family..."

"The Yu Family..." Xiao Yuansi stroked his chin and offered his condolences, speaking softly, "I have heard about them in Lixia Prefecture. When my clan uncle reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, the Yu Family also sent someone to offer congratulations. I have heard their actions are ruthless and tyrannical, and now I have seen it for myself."

After speaking, Xiao Yuansi shook his head and returned to the topic at hand with a smile. "It is just that your clan has no suitable girls of age, so I cannot make a proposal. Our family has an unmarried direct daughter who could marry Yuanjiao... What do you think, Brother Tongya?"

"This is out of the question!"

Li Tongya was stunned at how Xiao Yuansi proposed this marriage and immediately exclaimed, "Such a marriage alliance between our families would be us overreaching! This cannot be allowed..."

"Ah." Xiao Yuansi smiled warmly and continued, "I see that Qingxiao is only about three to five years old and has not grown up yet. We can wait a few years, there is no rush."

Li Tongya dismissed the younger ones and bowed deeply, saying earnestly, "A direct daughter marrying our Yuanjiao is really inappropriate! Please reconsider, Senior!"

"Don't worry, Brother Tongya! The ancestor favors your clan... I'll handle this, and there will be no problem from our side," Xiao Yuansi said, attempting to persuade him further.

However, Li Tongya remained bowed, saying solemnly, "I know you mean well, Senior, but our family cannot accept it... Please reconsider, Senior!"

Xiao Yuansi paused, thought for a moment, and seemed to understand something. He then said quietly, "I did not consider this carefully... Please forgive me, Brother Tongya."

"You're too kind, Senior!" Li Tongya replied as he thanked Xiao Yuansi.

Xiao Yuansi then stroked his beard and continued, "In that case, we do have a direct concubine-born daughter named Xiao Guiluanâ€”who is excellent in character and appearance. She is surely a perfect match for Yuanjiao!"

"Thank you for your understanding, Senior!" Li Tongya immediately agreed, then paused when he recalled something.

"I heard from Donghe that your family's main peak is called Mount Xianyou, and there is a river named Yue River... Is that true?" he asked.

"Yes," Xiao Yuansi nodded, slightly puzzled.

Li Tongya then asked, "Senior, do you know Xiao Xianyou?"

Xiao Yuansi's expression immediately grew serious, and with a wave of his hand, the courtyard gate closed tightly. Mana flowed around it, isolating them.

"Brother Tongya... how did you learn that name? Xiao Xianyou is from our line and is the ancestor's second uncle!"

Li Tongya hesitated and then recounted, "I once obtained a sword and when I channeled River True Essence into it, I obtained a secret technique known as River Crossing Torrential Step, which was created by Ancestor Xianyou..."

"Is that true?" Xiao Yuansi was overjoyed at this news. Li Tongya took out the sword, but the emblem of Lingyu Gate had already been replaced by a generic engraving. Xiao Yuansi took a closer look at it and shook his head in disappointment.

"It is just a standard dharma sword, with nothing remarkable about it," he said finally.

Li Tongya nodded and pulled out a jade slip, saying softly, "Since this belongs to your family's ancestor, I'll return it to you, Senior."

"This..."

A footwork technique was precious, and for Li Tongya to offer it so freely left Xiao Yuansi stunned. He wanted to refuse, but words failed him.

River Crossing Torrential Step held exceptional significance to the Xiao Family, far beyond that of an ordinary Grade Three footwork technique. Xiao Yuansi sighed quietly and said, "Brother Tongya, your integrity is impressive, but I do not know what to offer in return. Is your clan lacking anything at the moment?"

The evening wind swept through the mountains, drifting through the forests of Azure Pond Peak before reaching Chi Wei on the mountaintop. His white hair fluttered in the breeze, and his wrinkled eyes squinted.

He reached out to touch his face. He could have used a younger visage, but after living for hundreds of years, Chi Wei no longer cared about beauty... or ugliness.

Scattered figures stood among the clouds. Chi Wei's reputation was not as prominent as Duanmu Kui's, but Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from the three states of Yue, Wu, and Xu still came to observe him.

Standing behind him was Chi Zhiyun, his face full of sorrow and reluctance. He watched Chi Wei's moon-white patterned robe fluttering in the wind and said softly, "Ancestor, the matters in the sect have been resolved..."

Chi Wei remained silent, standing on the mountaintop, facing the evening breeze while he reminisced. He smiled and said, "Zhiyun, what do you think of this man named Chi Wei?"

Chi Zhiyun was puzzled but cupped his fist respectfully and answered, "The ancestor is the cornerstone of the Azure Pond Sect... With immense power, he dominates an era, learned beyond mortal comprehension, profound as a deep pool, and possessing extraordinary bearing..."

Chi Wei laughed heartily and shook his head as he heard this, then waved his hand. "Dominating an era? I cannot compare with Duanmu Kui and Li Jiangqun. As for being learned beyond mortal comprehension, that is nonsense! I am not even a match for that old flood dragon and am inferior to both Xiao Xianyou and Tang Yuanwu," he replied rather bitterly.

He paused, his expression thoughtful and his gaze sharp. He laughed, "...And as for being profound as a deep pool, I'm nowhere near Xiao Chuting."

"Xiao Chuting?!"

Chi Zhiyun searched his memory for this name before finally recalling it, leaving him stunned. He mumbled, "Xiao Chuting... Xiao Chuting... from the Xiao Family in Lixia."

Chi Zhiyun wasn't stupid. He looked up abruptly and exclaimed, "Xiao Chuting has broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm?!"

"Hmm..." Chi Wei smiled broadly, then nodded toward a point in the clouds.

Chi Zhiyun mumbled in disbelief, "How could that be?! How did he obtain Purple Mansion Realm techniques, let alone find secret divine abilities... or even have the courage to do so?!"

"Courage..." Chi Wei chuckled hoarsely, "Do not think of Azure Pond Sect as some superior sect that treats all beings like pawns. The world is full of talents scrambling to climb up like fish crossing the river. For the Azure Pond Sect to hold its current position..."

Chi Wei paused, sighing.

"It is like sitting on a hot pan over burning coals!"

Chi Zhiyun simply stuttered, unable to speak, and Chi Wei continued, "You young ones have grown up hearing my name, believing me to be a hero who dominated an era..."

"Is that not true?!" Chi Zhiyun protested indignantly, saying firmly, "You prevented the calamity, drove away the demons, swept across the southern border, and eliminated the monsters... Ancestor, you have saved millions of people. Even if tens of thousands were sacrificed for your cultivation, so what? These people should remember that without our protection, they would not be alive..."

"Humph!" Chi Wei scoffed, shaking his head, "I am but a petty man. From the age of seventeen, when I stole Li Jiangqun's pouch, to now... at 377 years old, swallowing human pills to extend my life... it is all the behavior of a scoundrel! Shameful to behold!"

"I borrowed Li Jiangqun's influence and collaborated with various sects to eradicate two gates. I destroyed Lingyu, and eliminated Xiao Xianyou. Every year, I harvested families and refined the disciples who absorbed the foundation of moonlight... The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have all seen this," Chi Wei said as he looked up and smiled, calling out to the dark night sky.

"Everyone above can hear me clearly... Tell me, does that not make me a scoundrel?!"

In the sky, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators looked at each other with varying expressions. Some sighed softly, some sneered in disdain, while others hummed coldly.

After a while, a cool female voice spoke, "If you are not a scoundrel, then who else is worthy of the name?"

"You!" Chi Zhiyun was enraged but remained silent, wary of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators above. Chi Wei simply nodded with a smile. The sunrise was already on the horizon, but he stood still.

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators also watched him silently. They had all lived for at least a century and were in no rushâ€”at least not as much as Chi Wei was.

The rising sun gradually illuminated the world as pure qi floated upward and murky qi sank. The essence of the sun and moon blended harmoniously, creating the perfect conditions for a breakthrough. Divine light began to rise from Chi Wei's body, and his expression remained calm.

As the celestial energy of the sun and moon reached its peak, Chi Wei's spiritual sense activated. A faint glow flew out from his Shenyang Mansionâ€”his divine ability, Heavy Murkâ€”now in full effect.

Chi Wei took a step forward, and his vision cleared. Two indistinct figures appeared among the clouds. Chi Wei laughed heartily and called out, "So, you two are here to collect my remains!"

The two figures had long grown accustomed to the varied scenes of Purple Mansion Realm breakthroughs and hence were not offended by his jest. One of them laughed sharply and called out to him.

"Chi Wei... your day has finally come!"

Chi Wei waved indifferently as his appearance grew increasingly youthful and handsome, but there was still a sinister air about him. Four more divine abilities flew out from his body, stirring up the spiritual qi of the heavens and earth that danced around him.

The five divine abilities combined into one radiant light, weaving together and transforming into five colors: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. They merged and soared, and one figure from above muttered, "He's using the Five Elements Command Metal Technique..."

Chi Wei flicked his fingers, and a pill appeared in his hand, radiating colorful light and emitting a rich fragrance. Its brilliance illuminated the surroundings, and the observers above craned their necks, murmuring in curiosity.

"Oh?"

The two indistinct figures noticed this phenomenon as well. One of them asked sharply, "What kind of pill is that?"

The other squinted and replied softly, "Judging by its appearance, it should be Lake Moon Autumn."

"Indeed."

The first figure, after examining Chi Wei's other immortal foundations, laughed and said, "That is also a viable method!"

Chi Wei put the pill into his mouth and waited for a few breaths, but only felt faint movement. Panic set in, and his expression shifted rapidly. He was clearly going through a range of emotions. Anger and fear appeared on his face as he shouted in anger, "Old flood dragon! How dare you deceive me with a fake pill?!"

The five-colored light drawn by the divine ability continued to burn, gathering into a bright point of light. The two indistinct figures above snickered in unison. "Chi Wei! You've been swindled!"

All the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators widened their eyes, pointing at the glowing light. Chi Wei quickly adjusted his mindset and sighed with closed eyes. He pushed his palm forward, summoning the essence of the sun and moon to pour into the light.

Five bright and light-colored beams gradually emerged above the light, floating downward before slowly fading away. The light point grew brighter while the colored beams vanished.

"Indeed, not as good as Duanmu Kui..."

Those above exchanged thoughts through their spiritual senses, while the two indistinct figures in the sky prepared their techniques, awaiting the emergence of the metallic essence.
