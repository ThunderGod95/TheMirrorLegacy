# Chapter 596: The Six Platforms of the Grand Hall

Li Yuanjiao was witnessing Supreme Yin Moonlight outside of his family's residence for the first time. Encased in a silver-plated ancient jade bottle adorned with ancient talismans, it was placed reverently on a jade platform, further shielded by an ancient spirit barrier. Even in this grotto heaven, it was clear this object was treated with the utmost respect.

The jade platform was intricately carved with various formations, suggesting it was once used to assist cultivation or extract secondary spiritual qi. However, these formations had long since lost their functionality, now appearing as mere decorative patterns.

In his family's secret chamber, where streams of moonlight essence flowed freely, Li Yuanjiao had grown accustomed to its silvery glow. It was ordinary to him—almost mundane.

Yet, when placed in this ceremonial setting, its rarity and value became strikingly evident. The silver-white radiance was dazzling. Li Yuanjiao remained composed, but the cultivators around the platform began to recognize the item. The atmosphere quickly grew tense.

The Jiangnan region had once been the site of the Moonlight Origin Mansion, with its Daoist legacy passed down through generations of immortal sects. Each family guarded its collection of ancient techniques, smithing methods, and divine abilities, making such treasures highly coveted. Even if one couldn't use it personally, delivering it to a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master would bring immense rewards.

The gathered cultivators' eyes grew bloodshot, their greed palpable. Only a few retained their composure, and even those few seemed less immune to temptation than ignorant of the object's true nature.

Among them, the tall and slender Xun Yizi, dressed in dark Daoist robes, was the first to recognize the treasure. He gripped the corner of his robe with one hand while clutching a purple sandalwood duster in the other. His wide, unblinking eyes seemed ready to fall from their sockets.

Sweeping his gaze across the crowd, Xun Yizi spoke first, saying, "There are six of us here, four from the three sects and seven gates of Yue State. If this treasure is to be shared, it should remain with Yue State. Overseas cultivators would do well to leave immediately!"

His words carried an obvious implication. Both Zhong Qian and the red-robed man's expressions shifted subtly. The red-robed man sneered and retorted, "Xun Yizi, your petty schemes are laughable. Trying to drive others away with vague words—how dare you bring such trickery to the table? I, for one, will flip the table over!"

Laughing aloud, he cupped his fist toward the surrounding five people and declared, "Let it be known to all: this treasure is none other than the long-lost Supreme Yin Moonlight! The ancient texts mention it under names such as Veiled Supreme Yin Qi, Great Moonlight Instrument, or even Extreme Yin. They all refer to this very item!"

The booming voice echoed across the clouds, causing a ripple of spiritual energies to stir nearby. It was as if the speaker feared no one would recognize the object and loudly proclaimed its identity, watching the surrounding cultivators' expressions of shock and awe with a triumphant laugh.

"Guo Hong'er!" The face of Xun Yizi, clad in dark robes, darkened severely. He muttered the name under his breath, while the red-robed man, unperturbed, casually dusted off his robes and slid a token into his sleeve.

With an indifferent hum, he turned and walked away, "Fight amongst yourselves as you will. Consider this my courtesy to all of you—Crimson Reef Island will not be joining the fray!"

His parting words left Xun Yizi seething with rage, his fury plain as he realized the trap Guo Hong'er had laid for him. The glances from the others surrounding the platform told him that there would be no peaceful resolution now.

The tension hung thick in the air for several moments before a young cultivator dressed in black cupped his fist respectfully and said, "Such treasures are beyond my means. I shall not involve myself in this matter."

The speaker was none other than Zhong Qian. Known for his low profile, he clearly recognized the immense trouble possession of this item would bring. Without hesitation, he turned and flew off.

Xun Yizi scanned the remaining four individuals and the faint, hidden presences lingering in the clouds above. He spoke in a deep tone, "If anyone here withdraws, consider it a personal favor to Xun Yizi of the Changxiao Gate."

His plea fell flat, eliciting little response. The cultivators stood silently, their gazes fixed intently on the silver-shrouded treasure atop the jade platform. Realizing diplomacy had failed, Xun Yizi abruptly sprang into action, his hand reaching for the object.

BOOM!

A thunderous explosion erupted as five or six artifacts flew toward him, intercepting his grasp. Expecting resistance, Xun Yizi feinted, drawing back his outstretched hand and instead attacking a nearby cultivator with his purple sandalwood duster.

"You!" The cultivator yelped.

Chaos unfolded as beams of light shot across the sky, their radiance interweaving in dazzling displays. Several cultivators unleashed their Immortal Foundations, their artifacts clashing with deafening force.

Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao and Tu Longjian remained aloft, silently observing the unfolding battle. Tu Longjian squinted, his spiritual sense weaving in and out as it exchanged information with the token hanging at his waist. He waited for the opportune moment.

Li Yuanjiao swept his gaze across the field and spotted Kong Tingyun using her jade orb to block incoming attacks. She stood quietly at the battlefield's edge, one hand supporting the small golden mountain she seemed to be weighing, considering where to hurl it.

Having witnessed the devastating effects of Kong Tingyun's golden mountain before, Li Yuanjiao knew its unanticipated power, especially against spellcasting cultivators.

Tu Longjian hoisted his slender, pole-like golden hammer, appearing ready to strike. Li Yuanjiao spoke softly, "Fellow Daoist, that cultivator from the Profound Peak Gate is an old acquaintance of mine. Perhaps we could coordinate our efforts."

Tu Longjian nodded in understanding. "Let us strike now. None of them seem particularly formidable."

He wasted no time. Tu Longjian hoisted his golden hammer and descended with the wind, streaking downward like a bolt of lightning.

Tu Longjian's hammer was an unusual dharma artifact, slender and elongated. The hammerhead itself was only about half the size of an average human head, while the shaft more closely resembled a spear or polearm. Its design made it seem less like a traditional hammer and more like a long-handled weapon as it swung downward with precision.

The golden-robed cultivator below, his affiliation unknown, caught sight of the descending hammer. His expression shifted instantly to shock and fear as he recognized the descending figure, Tu Longjian!

Abandoning the spell he had been casting, he ignored his opponent entirely and slapped the jade pendant at his waist. Streams of light surged upward from his body and coalesced into a formidable shield.

A sharp, shattering sound rang out as the shield splintered and dissolved into dust under the hammer's force. Tu Longjian pursued his target without pause, striking with relentless precision. Within a dozen exchanges, the cultivator took a heavy blow to the chest, spat out blood, and fled into the cloud sea, vanishing without a backward glance.

Li Yuanjiao recalled Tu Longjian's earlier words and decided not to intervene. Instead, he activated the Profound Patterned Spirit Mist, edging slowly toward the battlefield's periphery.

As he approached, a woman in a pale yellow-green feathered robe turned sharply toward him, her voice cold and alert, "Who goes there?"

Li Yuanjiao subtly revealed the outline of the Profound Patterned Spirit Mist. The woman, Kong Tingyun, hesitated, her expression uncertain. "Brother Yuanjiao?"

"It is me," he replied calmly.

Kong Tingyun's tension eased, her face lighting up with a mix of relief and surprise. "You made it in as well! At least I have someone to rely on now... You should be careful—this place is full of hidden dangers."

Li Yuanjiao hovered midair, speaking evenly. "I entered with a companion to gather qi on the island. We had not expected to end up here."

"I see..." Kong Tingyun retreated a step, distancing herself slightly from the main battlefield. The two observed from a vantage point among the clouds as she quietly explained the situation. "The item in the center is Supreme Yin Moonlight. It is nearly impossible to claim, but I am here to see who ultimately takes it."

She smiled slyly, her eyes narrowing with a hint of cunning. "Right now, it is out of reach... but that could change."

Li Yuanjiao understood her implication and nodded lightly. The two exchanged a few words as the battle below began to resolve itself.

The cultivator in black robes, Xun Yizi, had initially been the strongest among the combatants. His superior techniques had allowed him to fend off their attacks until Tu Longjian intervened, disrupting the stalemate and unwittingly easing the pressure on Xun Yizi.

Now, the two stood at a tense impasse around the jade platform, while the other cultivators who hadn't yet withdrawn continued circling the battlefield in the surrounding cloud sea.

Xun Yizi looked visibly displeased. He recognized Tu Longjian immediately, as well as the Six Ding Merging Fire Token at his waist. This ancient spirit artifact was famed for its ability to subdue demons and was equally formidable against cultivators.

As Tu Longjian activated the token, torrents of gray flame surged outward, exuding oppressive heat. The surrounding cultivators instinctively stepped back, shielding themselves from the scorching energy. Xun Yizi, standing closest, broke out into a sweat under the blazing pressure.

Xun Yizi and Tu Longjian both leveraged the unspoken rule that no one in a grotto heaven wanted to risk grievous injury. However, the moment Tu Longjian produced an ancient spirit artifact, the situation reversed.

Better to avoid him for now... there will be plenty of time for him to suffer later! Xun Yizi stepped back several paces, gritted his teeth, and ultimately retreated into the cloud sea, disappearing from view as Tu Longjian had anticipated. Tu Longjian shook his head slightly, channeling his power into the silver spirit barrier.

As the silver-white spirit barrier's engraved jade rabbits lit up one after another, Tu Longjian performed a series of incantations. The barrier rapidly shrank into his palm, and he collected the jade bottle, scanning the cloud sea. The surrounding cultivators hesitated briefly but eventually withdrew.

Kong Tingyun glanced at him, quickly understanding, and asked, "This Tu Longjian—is he your friend?"

"An acquaintance," replied Li Yuanjiao with a slight nod.

Kong Tingyun appeared worried, muttering softly, "This man is formidable. Among the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators here, he is likely among the top-tier. Be cautious and measured."

The two watched as Tu Longjian stowed the treasure. A flicker of light crossed his gaze, and in moments, he located them in the cloud sea. Flying over, he greeted Kong Tingyun with a cool, distant tone, "Greetings, Fellow Daoist."

Kong Tingyun returned the gesture politely. Tu Longjian turned to Li Yuanjiao, his tone notably warmer. "Senior, we should head for the mountains without delay. If we tarry, we will miss the chance to claim something valuable."

————

Li Xuanfeng and his two companions departed the small courtyard, employing swift footwork techniques as they ascended the mountain. The cave dwellings they passed were desolate, clearly having already been explored by cultivators who then moved toward the summit.

As they approached the mountain's peak, they came upon more than ten figures gathered before a grand hall, silently examining the formations etched into its surface. None made a move to enter.

Li Xuanfeng narrowed his eyes, quickly spotting a familiar figure in golden robes amidst the crowd. The man was youthful and handsome, with twin blades strapped to his back, his entire form enveloped in dark, black flames.

It was no surprise to Li Xuanfeng to see Situ Chen here, given that he had been tracking him. Avoiding unnecessary attention, Li Xuanfeng shifted his gaze to the grand hall itself.

The hall, constructed primarily in shades of pale blue and white, exuded grandeur. The floor was paved with white jade-like tiles, etched with elegant patterns, while massive jade pillars flanked the entrance. At the far end sat an immortal throne, flanked by six jade platforms.

On each platform rested a jade box. Five of the boxes sat undisturbed, faintly glowing. However, the final platform presented a peculiar sight.

Two figures were frozen there, one sitting cross-legged with a pale face, one hand resting on his knee and the other clutching his chest, a gleaming sword impaled through his torso. The blade protruded from his back, flashing cold light.

The second figure kneeled before the jade platform, left hand raised as if to seize something, right hand planted on the ground. The jade box from the platform lay cracked on the floor, its corner chipped.

These figures appeared lifelike, as if only moments ago locked in fierce combat. The scene seemed to have been frozen in time, the hall itself preserving their moment of confrontation.

From Li Xuanfeng's vantage point, the inside of the jade box was visible—completely empty save for a small, circular indentation. The hollow was approximately the thickness of a pinky finger, suggesting it once housed a ring-shaped dharma artifact.

At the very center of the grand hall stood a massive copper bell, adorned with two peculiar and intricate patterns. It hung silently, suspended in the middle of the hall, exuding an aura of mystery.

Beneath the bell, six meditation mats were arranged neatly, with an assortment of items placed upon them. Most of these were partially opened ancient tomes, alongside small, portable dharma artifacts.

These items were either set atop the mats or carefully placed beside them, creating an impression of abundance yet maintaining a remarkable sense of order.

The formation within the hall flickered intermittently, casting an ever-changing glow. The cultivators gathered outside the hall stood still, none daring to step inside. They watched intently, exchanging cautious glances, each waiting for someone else to make the first move.

Lin Chensheng cast a glance at the scene and transmitted a message quietly with his mana, "Do you recognize the two people in the hall?"

Li Xuanfeng squinted, observing the figure with a sword through their chest. The robes looked familiar, and after some thought, he realized they bore a resemblance to the attire of Azure Pond Sect, though not entirely identical.

Beside him, Bi Yuzhuang spoke softly, "Could that be... Yu Xiuxian? Was he not the senior disciple of Yuanwu Peak?"

"It seems... it might be..." Lin Chensheng carefully examined the figure, nodding as he spoke in a low tone, "Yu Xiuxian was killed by Guo Er back then. Yuanwu Peak even stormed into the Eastern Sea, causing a huge uproar until Guo Shentong made extensive reparations. I did not expect that he truly died here in the grotto heaven!"

The two discussed for a while, glanced at the other unidentified cultivator's remains, and eventually gave up trying to determine their identity. Suddenly, they saw a streak of golden light rise in the distance. It followed the emerald jade pathway and eventually descended in front of the grand hall.

The golden light slowly dissipated, revealing two figures. One was a man with a grim expression, clad in a black-and-gold daoist robe, wielding a long halberd. His cultivation was at the late Foundation Establishment Realm, and he stood staring at the figure inside the grand hall. His daoist robe bore a striking resemblance to the attire worn by the skeleton within the hall, sharing at least seven parts of its design.

The second individual was also at the late Foundation Establishment Realm, dressed in flowing white robes that exuded an otherworldly elegance. He held a longsword in one hand, while his waist was adorned with a crystalline, translucent jade buckle. His jet-black hair flowed freely, and his expression was cold and indifferent as his sharp gaze scanned the grand formation.

Lin Chensheng and Bi Yuzhuang exchanged glances, their suspicions solidifying. Lin Chensheng whispered, "That is Tang Shedu from Yuanwu Peak! Judging by his attire, the skeleton inside must be Yu Xiuxian... As for that man in white, I have never seen him before."

Li Xuanfeng remained silent, his gaze seemingly casual but briefly pausing at the jade buckle on the white-robed man's waist. Within his heart, he murmured quietly, Yu Muxian...!
