# Chapter 747: Discerning Truth from Falsehood

Below, Guest Elder Wu had already retrieved the items. At Kong Guxi’s nod, the guest elder immediately brought a stand forward, upon which sat two neat rows of soul lamps. They rested on a base of some dark, unknown wood, their faint blue flames flickering gently.

The bottom row held only life jades, clearly belonging to disciples and guest elders of little importance. The row above belonged to Kong Qiuyan’s generation; their soul lamps were already more than half extinguished. Higher still were the lamps of Kong Guxi’s generation, larger and more ornately carved, yet only three of the ten remained lit.

On the next tier, the lamps were almost entirely dark, save for a single flickering flame that Li Ximing recognized as Kong Tingyun’s. One level higher, on a gilded base, another solitary lamp burned brightly. This one, he presumed, corresponded to Kong Haiying.

At the very top rested a single, extinguished lamp on a jade throne inlaid with gold and silver patterns—the lamp of Changxi. Its presence alone made the stand astonishingly heavy, but as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Guest Elder Wu held it steady.

He wore a fawning expression, but the members of the Profound Peak Gate looked away in shame. To see the ancestral soul lamps, which were so revered in the ancestral hall that no one dared even touch them, brought out and presented like a platter of food was a deep humiliation.

But no one paid them any mind. All eyes were fixed on the lamps with a mixture of curiosity and awe. Only a crimson-robed young man standing behind Li Zhouwei kept his gaze fixed on the members of the Profound Peak Gate, his golden eyes sweeping over their faces.

Nearby, Sun Bo was gently patting Kong Guli’s sleeve in a comforting gesture, while Kong Qiuyan stood with her head bowed and eyes closed. Only Kong Guxi, the Sect Master of the Profound Peak Gate, stood at the forefront, his posture one of utmost reverence. Sensing the young man’s gaze, he lowered his head even further.

Li Jiangqian withdrew his gaze and gave a subtle nod to Li Quewan beside him. The woman, dressed in a long skirt of cloud-like satin, also glanced at Kong Guxi and asked through a secret art, “Is that the Sect Master of the Profound Peak Gate? The Daoist Master wants to investigate, so he had best cooperate.”

“Without Kong Guxi, the Profound Peak Gate’s lineage would have collapsed long ago. How else could they have held on until today?” Li Jiangqian replied. “I heard Granduncle Chenghui speak of him once. Let’s see how he handles this.”

The crowd remained silent, though whispers and speculations were already flying through private channels. Li Ximing was aware of this, but simply said, “Sect Master, please, explain.”

Kong Guxi hurried to comply. He stepped forward, lifted a sleeve, and pointed to the brightest soul lamp on the gilded base, the one a tier above Kong Tingyun’s. “This is the soul lamp of my granduncle, Kong Haiying.”

Several people craned their necks to get a better look. Li Ximing remained silent, letting Li Zhouwei speak for him. “Bring forth his portrait.”

Before Kong Guxi could even react, someone from below had already produced a scroll. Li Wen took it and unfurled it, revealing the image of a middle-aged man with a broad forehead and a square jaw. Tucked beneath it were at least a dozen other portraits, all depicting the same man with minor variations.

Kong Guxi knew without asking that they had been painted separately by his own disciples and guest elders to ensure accuracy. He simply lowered his head and said nothing. Guest Elder Wu stepped forward, examined the soul lamp, and announced respectfully, “Daoist Master, though Lord Haiying was often in seclusion, he made an appearance just before his breakthrough. I saw him then. The aura on this soul lamp is identical to his. This is without a doubt his soul lamp.”

It was an undeniable fact that the aura of a soul lamp was identical to that of its cultivator. Several others, including rogue cultivators who had met Kong Haiying, came forward to corroborate the claim.

Only then did Li Ximing sweep his spiritual sense over the lamp, committing the aura to memory.

He could have used the Immortal Mirror to learn the identity of everyone in seclusion, but such a matter had to be handled with extreme discretion. More importantly, of all the Profound Peak cultivators, he had only ever met Kong Tingyun. This meant that even if the Immortal Mirror revealed the faces of those in seclusion, he wouldn’t be able to identify them. Appearances could be easily disguised, and a Purple Mansion cultivator could fundamentally alter their own features. Only one’s aura was immutable.

Now that he had the aura from the soul lamp, he also had his people gather information on Fu En—his aura, cultivation level, and physical description. Though Kong Guxi was puzzled by the request, he complied without question. Fu En was rumored to be dead and thus had no soul lamp, but they managed to find a dharma artifact he had refined with his own blood. His portrait depicted a scarred, brutish-looking man whose features were far from flattering.

With this, Li Ximing was confident he could identify the person in seclusion. But this grand, public display was not merely about identifying an aura. It was about creating a justification for his subsequent judgments and actions. Whether he attributed his knowledge to divination or shamanism, it would prevent others from growing suspicious.

Kong Guxi remained kneeling, his posture unwavering. Finally, the Daoist Master on the seat of honor spoke.

“Do you have any of their personal belongings?”

Without a moment’s hesitation, Kong Guxi replied respectfully, “After several decades, most have been lost. Apart from Fu En’s artifact, which was preserved by chance, most of their other dharma artifacts have changed hands and lost their connection. Fortunately, Lord Haiying has living descendants. As for Lady Tingyun…”

“It matters not. Bring what you can.”

Li Ximing nodded. This whole affair was merely for show, so the details were unimportant. The items from Kong Haiying and Fu En would suffice. At his command, someone went to make the arrangements.

The public part of the proceedings was over. The vague request for “personal belongings” had planted a seed, leaving ample room for the various families to speculate. Now, whatever he did next would seem reasonable. Li Ximing waved a hand, dismissing the outsiders, and kept only Kong Guxi behind.

“I paid a visit to the Purple Smoke Gate and spoke with Daoist Master Tinglan,” Li Ximing said. “Shanji Prefecture cannot be held, and your sect’s mountain will be difficult to protect.”

A chilling cold spread through Kong Guxi’s heart. But Li Ximing quickly added a word of comfort. “Don’t overthink it. The old master foresaw this. It’s possible that neither of them is even within the sect. I am currently seeking a Daoist Master skilled in the divinatory arts to determine Kong Haiying’s exact location. If they are not on the mountain, we can make other plans.”

His words were like a torrent of scalding water, instantly melting the ice in Kong Guxi’s heart. His eyes reddened. ‘That’s right… The Ancestor was meticulous in his planning. He must have anticipated this. I mustn’t despair! I mustn’t despair!’

Seeing that he understood, Li Ximing vanished into the Great Void. Kong Guxi kowtowed deeply before rising and striding out of the courtyard. Though tear tracks still stained his face, his steps were markedly lighter. Li Chenghui was waiting outside the courtyard and spoke a few perfunctory words about confidentiality, but with so many eyes having witnessed the earlier events, secrecy was merely a pretense—a formality that Kong Guxi nevertheless acknowledged with solemn promises.

Once Li Chenghui departed, the entire mountain fell silent. The clamor of moments before seemed like a gust of wind, arriving and departing with equal swiftness. Feeling a bit faint, Kong Guxi exited the hall and saw that the stand with the soul lamps had been left in the courtyard. Kong Guli was staring at it from the steps, lost in thought.

He started to walk over, but noticed that Kong Qiuyan was gone. In the distance, he saw Kong Yu kneeling just outside the courtyard, kowtowing toward the table of soul lamps. Kong Guxi quickly stopped, not daring to approach or interrupt him. He simply called out, “Great-Granduncle…”

Kong Yu continued to kowtow, the sound of his forehead striking the ground echoing with dull thuds. After a full nine prostrations, the old man fell still, his face pressed to the ground. Kong Guxi waited a moment, but his spiritual sense screamed that something was wrong. His expression changed drastically as he rushed forward, crying out, “Great-Granduncle!”

He lifted Kong Yu and was met with a smear of dark blood that dripped from the old man’s nose.

The dark blood trickled like a small stream down the old man’s face, following the curve of his nose and neck. The face that was once so often wreathed in cheerful smiles was now dark and fixed in a rigid expression. The old man’s eyelids were pulled back to a shocking degree, revealing far too much of the whites of his eyes. His lips were twisted from repeated convulsions into a grotesque, mocking smile, and a look of profound terror was frozen deep within his gaze.

Kong Guxi felt a jolt of pure horror. The old man was dead.

His mind felt as though it had been struck by a hammer, and his vision swam with stars. He was paralyzed by a disbelieving terror, and it was only after two or three breaths that he heard Kong Guli shouting from behind him. “Why?” Kong Guxi asked blankly.

He had been prepared for any hardship, but he had never imagined that Kong Yu would take his own life so abruptly. Though the old man was aged and melancholic, he had never seemed suicidal… The situation had been awkward, yes, but it was nothing compared to the deep despair of the day the Ancestor’s last will was revealed. Perhaps this truly signaled the end of their mountain home, but that day had not yet come, had it? Was this necessary?

If it was the work of a divine ability… Li Ximing himself had just been on the mountain. Any such influence would have to have come from the Daoist Master himself. Had someone struck in the few dozen breaths since he left? What benefit was there in harming this old man?

His rational mind was shattered by this incomprehensible turn of events. For a moment, he didn’t even think to lower Kong Yu’s body, not until Kong Guli rushed over to take it from him. Kong Guli and Kong Yu came from two very close branches of the family, neither of which had been highly regarded in the past, and their bond was deep. He wailed as he took the old man’s body into his arms. Kong Guxi stood frozen, his pupils slowly dilating. He soon regained his senses and declared in a mournful voice, “Great-Granduncle could not bear to witness the destruction of the Profound Peak Gate, and so he took his own life.”

***

At the Profound Peak Gate.

Li Ximing tore through the Great Void and landed before the mountain. With a flick of his finger, a jade pendant flew from his sleeve. As it shone upon the grand array, the Purple Mansion-level formation, the Hundred Mountains Concealed Storage Spirit Array, opened on its own. Li Ximing stepped through with ease.

At this stage, the Li family was already in de facto control of most of the Profound Peak Gate’s assets. Only their scripture repository and treasury remained untouched. The grand array was no exception; Li Ximing’s authority within the formation now far surpassed Kong Guxi’s.

His light flared as he appeared within the array. He connected his spiritual sense to the formation’s core, ensuring the Great Void was sealed off. In an instant, every corner of the Profound Peak Gate was laid bare to him. The number of disciples on the mountain was pitifully small; he could scan several peaks before spotting one or two people.

As his thoughts turned, the locations of the various seclusion chambers appeared in his mind. ‘Connected to the grand array… there are five active seclusion chambers… and the one Kong Guxi showed me was separated from the array. That means… there are six in total.’

He adopted a thoughtful expression, but inwardly, he was reciting an incantation. ‘Li clan disciple, Ximing, respectfully petitions the Immortal Mirror: Patrol the unseen, plumb the subtle, pierce the profound, and illuminate all creation. Seize the ghostly, and expose the divine.’

He felt a chill emanate from his Shengyang Acupoint. The world around him, both in reality and in the Great Void, remained unchanged, but the range of his spiritual sense exploded. The entirety of the Profound Peak Gate, in all its truth and illusion, manifested within his mind.

‘As I thought… the chill from the Immortal Mirror doesn’t travel through the Great Void… It’s truly beyond the detection of gods and ghosts…’

He knew that very few things could function over vast distances. Soul lamps, life jades, arrays, secret arts—all used the Great Void as their medium. That was why a battle between Purple Mansion cultivators in the Great Void could often cause them to malfunction. In theory, one could even inadvertently destroy someone’s life jade or cause a small array to suddenly weaken or strengthen… But the chill from the Immortal Mirror, though he knew its source, seemed to appear from nothing, defying all his understanding. The thought sent a shiver down his spine.

He pushed these stray thoughts aside and focused. His spiritual sense found the nearest seclusion chamber and passed through its protective wards as if they weren’t there. Inside the pitch-black chamber, a skeleton sat cross-legged on a meditation mat, surrounded by scattered flecks of golden light.

“A failed breakthrough to Foundation Establishment. It’s Heavenly Gilded Helm.”

This was almost certainly one of the enforcers Changxi had cultivated. He hadn’t made it through the trial, and with the Profound Peak Gate in its current, empty state, no one had been around to tend to his body. It had simply been left in the cave.

Li Ximing withdrew his spiritual sense and moved to the next chamber. He found the stone room completely empty, with only the formation operating on its own.

He checked the remaining three chambers one by one. Aside from another corpse, the other two were also empty. Finally, he arrived at the chamber Kong Guxi had pointed out—the one where Kong Tingyun was supposedly in seclusion.

This place was deliberately hidden, not even connected to the grand array. The gate was forged from Profound-Vein Stone, which isolated the inside from the out and was beneficial for cultivators of the Earth Virtue. Li Ximing’s spiritual sense passed through the stone and found the interior covered in a thick layer of spirit earth. The spiritual energy was incredibly dense, and within it, a cold, star-like point of profundity glimmered.

The cultivator’s physical body seemed to have mostly dissolved into spiritual energy to fuel the breakthrough, and it was shrouded in the dense mist. But the aura was laid bare before him, and in the next moment, Li Ximing recognized it.

“It’s Fu En…”

Inside the seclusion chamber meant for Kong Tingyun… was the guest elder, Fu En!

‘Such dense spiritual qi. The Profound Peak Gate truly provided him with the best conditions… They even used spirit stones to enrich this place. It’s far better than my own setup back on Mount Wu. And this man, though just a guest elder… his cultivation is remarkably solid…’

“But Changxi, oh, Changxi… who was it that died all those years ago?”

With the soul lamps of both Kong Haiying and Kong Tingyun still burning, Changxi’s plan became clear. He knew his sect would inevitably be occupied. He had arranged for those two to be somewhere else entirely, leaving only Fu En behind on the mountain!

As for the one who had perished back then… it was most likely a pawn, a substitute meant to die in his place!

“So… when my Li family can no longer withstand the pressure and is forced to abandon the Profound Peak Gate, the only one who dies will be Fu En. As for Kong Tingyun and Kong Haiying… they are somewhere safe, calmly working on their breakthroughs…”

“In that case… I cannot wait any longer…”

If it had been Kong Haiying or Kong Tingyun—direct descendants of the Profound Peak Gate—Li Ximing might have gritted his teeth and tried to find another way, some way to save them. But the person inside was merely Fu En, a guest elder who had no connection to his family. He could not continue to bear the pressure of holding Shanji Prefecture and the Profound Peak Gate for him…

Li Ximing sighed softly. It was a desperate situation for the person in seclusion—to be in the middle of a breakthrough, only to have their sect become someone else’s property. He could imagine the despair. But he had never considered himself a saint. He had no obligation to make sacrifices for a stranger and invite disaster upon his own clan. He could only offer what help he could without harming his own interests.

‘Since the mountain must be relinquished,’ he thought with a quiet sigh, ‘I will do my best to negotiate with the Purple Smoke Gate. When they send a Purple Mansion cultivator to take over… perhaps they can be persuaded to leave him here to finish his breakthrough. His chances of success are slim anyway. When he eventually perishes, his essence will only enrich the spiritual qi of this place. And in the one-in-a-million chance that he succeeds… he’s still just an outsider… We can discuss it further.’

He organized his thoughts, crafting the narrative he would present.

‘Alright… from this moment on, the soul lamps were tampered with by Changxi. The first to die will be Kong Haiying, who is actually Fu En inside the sect. Kong Tingyun will be declared missing. By relinquishing the mountain this way, I can ease tensions with the Capital immortals Dao and give the Purple Smoke Gate a satisfactory explanation. Whether they believe me or not is a problem for another day.’
