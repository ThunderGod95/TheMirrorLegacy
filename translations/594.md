# Chapter 929: Mistake

Tu Longjian gave a respectful salute. Daoist Master Pu Yu merely sat silently at the table, smiling as he looked into his cup.

Tu Longjian pondered for a moment, then asked in a low voice, "Daoist Master, you are versed in the arts of Yin and Yang. What is the usual price for performing such a technique?

"Several of the necessary treasures are native to my Penglai. I can retrieve them easily. This spell isn’t costly to cast on someone at Foundation Establishment Realm, especially since he’s young and his cultivation is clear and pure... But this art is a closely guarded secret of our lineage and unknown to ordinary immortals.

"Let’s set the price aside for now. I have one question: if I could ask Junjian to resolve it for me?" Daoist Master Pu Yu looked at him, a probing light in his eyes, and said with a smile, "Using this art on a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator is extremely rare. After all, death means death. I dwell in Penglai and wander often. There would be no reason to make advance preparations... If one could prepare in advance, why would one need to die in the first place?"

He stood up, looked back at Tu Longjian, and said with deep meaning, "However, it makes no sense. As soon as you reached the Purple Mansion Realm, you visited my Penglai several times and even waited at the foot of the mountain for years just to see me. Your intention was clear. If we look at it from this angle..."

The smile slowly faded from Daoist Master Pu Yu’s handsome face as he said quietly, "Junjian, did you foresee today’s events the moment you broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm? Even with the great upheaval of Xu State’s civil war in between? That’s beyond calculation. Even a Maha would feel ashamed compared to such planning. Was it a dharma relic? Or the workings of someone else?"

Tu Longjian could only smile bitterly in his heart. He hadn’t prepared for years specifically for Li Xijun! Tu Longjian had worked to build ties with Daoist Master Pu Yu all this time solely for Guo Er, who was sealed inside the Six Ding Merging Fire Token!

Tu Longjian had been mentored by Guo Er for many years. Guo Er had once obtained treasures alongside Zhang Cuotian and others within the Green Pine Temple’s grotto heaven. Later, Tu Longjian had escaped danger thanks to a technique Guo Er left behind there. Since he owed him a great debt, Tu Longjian had always sought to find Guo Er a new body.

It was well known that Daoist Master Pu Yu of Penglai was a master in such arts, which was why Tu Longjian had visited him repeatedly. As for Li Xijun, his case was truly just a timely coincidence.

Tu Longjian replied, "If I merely wanted to sever ties with the Li Family, I wouldn’t need to go to such lengths... The matter with the Li Family is just a coincidence.

"In my youth, I was displaced and lost all my family and friends. Their bodies were scattered and vanished over time. Upon hearing that Senior possessed divine arts to govern Yin and Yang, and is close with Judge Yang, I thought to request your aid, to inquire of the Underworld where my kin’s remains lie..."

He did not bring up Guo Er directly. Instead, he voiced a matter that had long weighed on his heart and said softly, "Even if I can’t know where their bones fell, even if my father and kin ended up in someone’s belly or were turned into dharma artifacts, as long as I can know, I, Junjian, will repay the favor handsomely."

"I see." Daoist Master Pu Yu’s narrow eyes narrowed further as he looked at Tu Longjian thoughtfully. He turned his jade cup, and replied, "So it truly was a coincidence... Junjian, you have a kind heart. In longing for one lost friend, you’ve saved another. Such is fate."

He asked no more and responded, "Li Xuanfeng entrusted his orphan to me, since we once shared a fated connection. Though he is gone, he still barely counts as part of the Li Family. I’ll handle Li Xijun’s matter. Penglai happens to have recently grown a piece of Gaoxuan Bright Frost. I’ll carve out sixty percent and fashion a body for him."

Tu Longjian let out a breath of relief when he realized he wasn’t being threatened with the soul, and drew something from his sleeve. The command token was interwoven with red and black patterns.

A misty red glow formed from the Six Ding Merging Fire Token as he gave it a gentle tug. It was half gold and half silver as it hovered in his palm.

Inside the command token, Guo Er wailed in anguish, his cries shaking the heavens, but Tu Longjian pretended not to hear and said respectfully, "I cannot use Senior’s spiritual item without recompense. This Crimson Gold White Flame was something I obtained before attaining divine abilities. Please accept it as compensation."

Centuries ago, a great snowfall blanketed the Northern Sea, forming a five thousand kilometer snow mountain. Spiritual items of Cold Essence became abundant. But even among them, Gaoxuan Bright Frost was exceptional. At the same time, even if six-tenths were carved out for Li Xijun, it still wouldn’t surpass the Crimson Gold White Flame. Daoist Master Pu Yu understood it was meant to aid the ritual and accepted it with a smile.

The two exchanged a few casual words before Tu Longjian saw him off at the cave entrance. Returning to his desk, Tu Longjian sat down and brought two fingers to his lips, exhaling a puff of flame.

The flame quickly formed into a human shape and immediately wailed, "Tu Longjian! You—you—you! You used my treasure to curry favor—how unreasonable!"

Tu Longjian, rarely seeing him so flustered, was delighted inwardly, but kept a stern expression as he said quietly, "Senior, what are you saying? Do you know why I did this?"

Guo Er glared at him in frustration and replied, "Isn’t it just to repay your precious senior’s favor?"

"Not at all." Tu Longjian replied with a serious expression, "I must repay Senior Yuanjiao’s kindness. Yes, but this was also for your sake.
𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑛𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮

"Think about it. Pu Yu is from Penglai. He is ambiguous in nature, neither righteous nor evil. When crafting an immortal body, who’s to say he won’t plant any hidden tricks? If you enter it unaware, wouldn’t you suffer terribly?"

Guo Er, who had been watching all along, had truly not considered this and paused in surprise. Tu Longjian said earnestly, "Once he finishes shaping the body, you too are skilled in this Dao. Though not as accomplished as the Daoist Master, with Li Xijun as precedent, you can inspect and take precautions."

Guo Er had no more words. He looked like he wanted to nod, but held back. After a long pause, he muttered gloomily, "Fine, fine, fine..."

On his end, Daoist Master Pu Yu left the Slaughter Jun Gate and made his way toward the Eastern Sea, traveling through the great void. As he formed seals and cast spells, the blue light in his hand transformed into a cyan sparrow that glided through the void. He silently calculated, Li Xijun... I should examine him thoroughly. This time, Tu Longjian invited me personally, and the timing checks out. There’s nothing suspicious. Even if someone backs him, they can’t fault me.

He gently pressed on the jade box within his sleeve, his heart stirred slightly, Li Xijun’s soul is unusual too. It's cold as snow, as if carrying a thread of fate. Those Purple Mansion Realm cultivators simply aren’t skilled enough to notice it.

In truth, Daoist Master Pu Yu had sensed it when holding the soul. It had resisted slightly when leaving the body, as if it had been tethered to something. These were classic signs of being entwined with fate.

Since Li Xijun was so unusual and the spirit item matched his Immortal Foundation, reshaping a body for him would not be difficult. Daoist Master Pu Yu then began to consider Tu Longjian’s request to find his kin.

His Penglai did indeed have close ties with the Underworld. Judge Yang was a frequent guest, so Tu Longjian’s request wasn’t hard to fulfill. Pu Yu only pondered, Judge Yang’s Nine-Layer Attribute Net is formidable. I’m not sure if that True Essence fell into his hands. Asking directly would be inappropriate; it's best to leave it alone.

A white ocean appeared below his feet, and a small mountain began to surface. Atop it stood a simple Daoist temple. Before even landing, Daoist Master Pu Yu called out, "Bring me the Gaoxuan Bright Frost!"

Eastern Sea.

Waves surged across the sea as hundreds upon thousands of sword shadows from Level Beam peppered the surface. The overcast clouds completely smothered the sun; towering waves crashed skyward; and the entire region was shrouded in mist.

The grand formation that had cloaked everything had been fully revealed. It radiated pulses of golden light as it fended off the dharma artifacts launched by those outside. A red-robed woman had a complicated expression as she activated a petal-shaped ritual implement and knocked down several incoming dharma artifacts.

At Bi Yuzhuang's side, the Feng brothers each wielded spell arts, blocking most of the incoming dharma light. The few that slipped through merely caused faint ripples on the formation's surface, doing little harm.

Yet Bi Yuzhuang felt deeply uneasy. Wang Fu had already been in dire straits, but as a direct disciple of Changxiao Gate, it made no sense for him to die within a few moves.

He had held out for fifty exchanges, and unleashed three talismans in a row. Bi Yuzhuang had even forced out the life-saving Purple Mansion Realm talisman that she had dispelled with a prearranged one of her own.

But now there was a growing crowd outside the formation; the cultivators of Qingzhou Workshop had arrived. Alarmed, Bi Yuzhuang had wanted to end the battle swiftly, but the formation suddenly trembled violently, on the verge of collapse.

"Not good..."

The formation in Bi Yuzhuang’s hands was a treasured item called Yellow Cotton, a formation plate of the Auspicious Essence Dao. It was considered outstanding even among Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. By rights, it should have easily lasted a while longer.

Yet the moment those cultivators arrived, the formation had begun to shake uncontrollably. Bi Yuzhuang quickly realized something was wrong. When she connected to the formation plate through spiritual sense, she took a closer look and saw eight cultivators outside each holding a golden, slightly illusory spike, while another held a jade talisman linking the eight.

"Engraved Golden Astral Profound Destroyer!"

Bi Yuzhuang instantly recognized the dharma artifacts’ origin. It was a treasure from the Golden Feather Sect, famed alongside Azure Pond Sect’s Deadly Thunder Formation Destroyer. Eight of them would be more than enough to trouble a Foundation Establishment Realm formation like hers!
𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑛𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮

This was disregarding the immense value of Yellow Cotton, which was a portable formation plate and nearly impossible to buy. If it were to be broken by these dharma artifacts, the loss would be devastating. It wouldn’t last nine hits against the Engraved Golden Astral Profound Destroyer, which was barely ten seconds of time.

Once the formation broke, not only would the cultivators pour in, but Wang Fu, with his storage pouch full of escape techniques, would immediately flee. Since Li Qinghong and others were secretly aiding her, even if Wang Fu escaped, Bi Yuzhuang could not let them expose their tracks.

She had no choice but to bring the Feng brothers out of the formation to confront the enemy and block the Engraved Golden Astral Profound Destroyer herself. She didn’t believe that this would let Wang Fu escape death, but the worry weighing on her heart remained—not for Wang Fu, but for her Daoist Master.

Why is the Engraved Golden Astral Profound Destroyer of the Golden Feather Sect here? How did they track us down... Changxiao Gate must have acted... this may ruin the Daoist Master’s plans...

She knew that once she left the formation, Daoist Master Hengxing would stay behind to guard it. Although she only understood part of her Daoist Master’s schemes, the circumstances clearly looked grim.

While she thought furiously from outside the formation, the battle within was nearing a conclusion.

Wang Fu’s robes fluttered wildly. His body was riddled with wounds, as lightning coursed over his skin. His bloodshot eyes reflected the crashing strikes outside the formation, yet there was not a trace of joy on his face.

Before him, Li Qinghong rode thunder, commanding lightning at her feet, while Chen Xuanyu held a pitch-black sword in his arms, his expression calm and unreadable.

"Fellow Daoist Li!" Wang Fu looked solemnly at Li Qinghong, his voice hoarse and expression even tinged with acceptance. A large bell trembled and flew forth from his side, blocking part of the surrounding sword qi. He gasped and asked, "I know full well I’ve become a discarded pawn. I presume my private ties with Minghui were exposed before the Daoist Master... He hates Jinlian, and so he wants me dead..."

As he spoke, a deeper thought seemed to flicker in his eyes. He said quietly, "I simply don’t understand what I have done to offend your esteemed family... to warrant being hunted down like this?"

Li Qinghong exhaled deeply and did not answer. One hand held her spear at an angle, while six silver-white command tokens circled the other.

Chen Xuanyu’s sword essence grew sharper, his voice low, "Pay him no heed. Be on guard for deception."

Seeing her silence, Wang Fu growled bitterly, "Changxiao Gate refused to find me a Purple Mansion Realm technique, and I did not resent him for it. But why wouldn’t they let me seek it myself? Lesser Yang is a Dao lineage of Great Liang. If I didn’t travel north to inquire, how else was I supposed to find my Dao?"

Li Qinghong found his words a little too deliberate. As she summoned silver lightning to crash thunderously down on Wang Fu’s great bell, she thought to herself, Though Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are powerful, they can’t observe what’s happening inside this formation unless they pierce the great void and enter. Even Changxiao Gate can neither hear nor see inside here.

She observed quietly. She let her spiritual sense run along the lightning pulses and eventually spotted a jade inside Wang Fu’s storage pouch flickering with dharma light. She silently made note of it.

Beside her, Chen Xuanyu gave him no more chances to speak. Sword light danced from his blade, falling like a rain of blades and pounding on the bell with thunderous booms. Lightning poured like rain, threatening to slice through Wang Fu’s body and forcing him to raise the bell once again for protection.

Cornered and out of options, Wang Fu could do little. Chen Xuanyu had anticipated his movements and flung a golden ring from his sleeve, which transformed into a flash of gold that struck down like lightning. With a deep clang, the bell’s radiance dimmed and its dharma light dispersed completely.

Wang Fu was just beginning to panic when he suddenly felt burning heat across his face, as though under the noonday sun. A brilliant white light seemed to emerge from nowhere into the sky and coalesced into a towering radiant gate.

The gate shimmered with radiant light as it crashed down with blinding speed. Caught mid-movement, Wang Fu had no time to react. He sighed inwardly, There was one more after all!

Li Ximing had been hiding within the clouds above Hengzhu Dao Gate as backup in case Wang Fu tried to flee. This strike had been long prepared, and was backed with immense power. The Radiant Origin Pass was of high grade and landed squarely upon Wang Fu.

Wang Fu’s internal mana was nearly spent. That single blow shattered all his techniques. Several dharma artifacts fell apart, and the Radiant Origin Pass impacted the sea, unleashing a thunderous blast.

Boom!

Li Ximing didn’t dare be careless and channeled all his power to suppress Wang Fu. Li Qinghong dispelled her lightning and descended with Chen Xuanyu. Most of Wang Fu’s body was pinned beneath the glowing barrier, unable to move, and what little mana he gathered was steadily dissolved by the Radiant Origin Pass. His head, exposed outside, remained completely still.

Naturally, the Li Family didn’t dare kill him themselves. The middle-aged man saw their hesitation and said softly, "I’ll do it."

Sword essence flowed along his blade as he ended Wang Fu’s life with one strike. Li Qinghong flicked her spear, hooking Wang Fu's storage pouch. Li Ximing withdrew his mana and retrieved Wang Fu’s corpse. Removing his robe, he drew a small silver-white box from the sleeve.

"Hm?"

But it wasn’t the right time to investigate. Suppressing his unease, he followed the others and slipped into the clouds. Above them, celestial anomalies slowly emerged, gales howled and demonic murmurs buzzed through the sky.
