# Chapter 976: The Azure Cauldron

Li Zhouwei took stock of the situation, his brow furrowing as he discreetly activated his Spirit Probe ability.

The reason was simple. With every passing moment, more streaks of light flashed across the sky. It was clear that the formations others had chosen were not as robust as this one. They had likely already secured their treasures and moved on to the second or even third mountain peak.

On one of the three peaks he had previously claimed with his Heavenly Light, an intruder had already appeared. The man, dressed in white robes and wreathed in lightning, was clearly a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from Thunder-Hearing Island, and he seemed to be searching for something specific.

Further in the distance, another white light shot through the air like a meteor, closing to within a few miles. Its trajectory was unmistakable—it was headed directly for Xinhu Palace, the very building he stood upon.

'I can't delay any longer!' he thought. 'I might be able to detect them early, but those other families could have their own secrets. They might know exactly which places in this grotto-heaven hold the greatest treasures... which is why they're heading straight for this spot!'

His mind made up, Li Zhouwei looked up. A ray of golden light shot from between his brows, soaring into the air. It flew above the sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues, transforming into a cascade of ever-shifting Heavenly Light, ready to suppress them. Only then did he step forward and place his hands on the rim of the great azure cauldron.

"Hnngh..."

The instant he touched it, his eyebrows shot up in surprise. He narrowed his eyes. Dark clouds immediately gathered above Xinhu Palace, crackling with intense purple-white lightning. At the same time, his Spirit Probe revealed that the auras within the sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues had instantly surged to a new level. He could feel a palpable sense of danger!

'This is bad! I'm about to be trapped between them!'

The strange phenomenon alone was enough to put him on high alert. He retracted his divine ability, his body instantly dissolving into boundless Heavenly Light, plunging the great hall into shadow. Barely a breath later, drawn by the commotion, someone rushed into the hall.

The newcomer wore white robes, his eyes slightly narrow. A purple gourd hung from his waist, and he was wreathed in purple lightning so dark it was almost black, coiling around him like dragons and tigers. His face was stern and righteous, projecting an imposing aura. It was none other than Miao Huanzun, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from Thunder-Hearing Island.

He zipped into the hall as a streak of purple lightning, his movements frantic. His gaze darted around, full of suspicion. When he saw the azure cauldron, his eyes lit up, but then he noted the disarray in the hall and his heart clenched.

'Something is definitely wrong. The formation here has clearly been broken, but there's no one in sight!'

'To leave a spiritual treasure like this untouched... they must be after something bigger. Or perhaps... they're lurking nearby, waiting for the right moment?'

He scoffed inwardly, feeling little fear. The celestial phenomenon was obvious; every cultivator in the area must have seen it. As a cultivator of the Thunder Dao, he could not pass up an opportunity like this. There was no room for hesitation. Though his mind raced, his hands were already on the cauldron, surging with both divine ability and dharma power.

The azure cauldron didn't budge.

A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's combined divine ability and dharma power could move a mountain with ease. But this cauldron was far heavier than any mountain. Whatever it contained, it possessed a weight that his divine ability alone couldn't lift. Miao Huanzun had not cultivated a Body Divine Ability, and his initial attempt had been careless. He focused, concentrating intense purple light in his palms, and tried again. This time, he finally lifted it.

"Clang!"

He hoisted the cauldron from the floor. Dense lightning flared, turning into a pillar of purple-black light that shot toward the sky. But before Miao Huanzun could even feel a moment of triumph, a white light flashed above. A chariot pulled by a horned beast tore through the air, and a man appeared.

The man was dressed in silver-white robes, with a high crown and a wide sash. His feathered attire was magnificent, and clouds billowed beneath his feet, giving him the air of a true immortal. He gripped a halberd in his hand and swept in with a loud laugh, his voice cold.

"A little greedy, aren't we, Daoist friend!"

The lightning-wielding man cursed inwardly, his heart sinking.

'Touba Ci?!'

The Touba family's prestige was immense. In the past century, they had finally begun to emerge from the shadow of the Great Liang's fall. Geniuses had been born to their line one after another, each possessing profound dharma power and mastery of Daoist arts. The Miao Family had its own heritage, true, and had even produced a genius ancestor. They couldn't afford to offend powerful Daoist traditions, let alone a scion of the Touba family with his formidable backing!

On any other day, he would have yielded. But he absolutely could not let go of the treasure in his hands. Furthermore, his cultivation had advanced significantly in recent years, thanks to a cultivation method and divine ability a junior member of his family had obtained from the Green Pine Temple. A flicker of defiance sparked within him. His expression darkened, and he opened his mouth to spit out a bolt of visceral, purple-black lightning.

"BOOM!"

But the great halberd smashed down, unleashing a ripple of Profound Yellow Qi that shattered the lightning bolt. The Touba scion reached for the azure cauldron, his smile still in place but his eyes ice-cold with warning. Miao Huanzun's face, however, lit up with a brilliant glow as he activated a divine ability.

"Supreme Yang Exhalation!"

A roiling storm of Profound Thunder instantly erupted around his body. Touba Ci was momentarily blocked. He was just about to draw a Spiritual Artifact when he froze, his expression changing dramatically.

The sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues on the mountain had all opened their eyes. With stiff, grinding movements, they turned their heads to glare at the intruders.

The Touba scion's face drained of color.

'Sixteen Profound Divine Officials! They're still active!'

He instantly retracted his hand in apprehension. But Miao Huanzun looked no happier; a profound chill crept up his spine. His Life Divine Ability was screaming a warning, making the hairs on his neck stand on end.

The Daoist Master barely had time to turn his head before his pupils dilated in horror.

The sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues were charging.

And what magnificent statues they were! Five of them, appearing as Martial Monarchs, strode upon shimmering profound mists. Another five, clad in the armor of immortal generals, rode atop seven-colored auspicious clouds. These ten held golden weapons and had swelled to the size of mountains. The remaining six resembled civil officials of normal human stature, holding immortal banners or precious talismans.

The eyes of these imposing statues were all solid gold. They channeled dharma power, their cold, emotionless pupils scanning in all directions before fixing squarely on him.

'What are these things!'

His spiritual sense was suppressed, but his Life Divine Ability clearly identified the statues as the source of the danger. The purple gourd at his waist flew into the air, unleashing a torrent of lightning. In an instant, a purple-black deluge submerged the ten mountain-sized statues.

"RUMBLE!"

But the statues simply glowed, neutralizing the lightning as it struck them. They walked straight through the thunderous waterfall, their massive shadows enveloping Miao Huanzun in an instant.

Though chilled to the bone, the Daoist Master's reactions were swift. His pre-activated lightning escape art flared with purple light. Harnessing the supreme speed of lightning, he teleported laterally, narrowly dodging the enveloping radiance, but the shockwave alone nearly made him cough up blood.

'What?'

'In this day and age, with souls being so obscure, arts like shamanic spirit statues and external dharma bodies are a joke. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could spend ages refining one and end up with a puppet at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Both Li Que'wan and Li Chenghuai have things like that—they're completely useless. As for a Purple Mansion-level spirit puppet... no one has seen such a thing since Duanmu Kui's time. It's pure fantasy!'

But seeing this, how could Miao Huanzun not be utterly terrified? He knew these sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues would be strong, but he had never imagined _this_. His brief clash of divine abilities revealed that the statues' physical bodies were comparable to a Bodhisattva seat, and that was _before_ considering the Treasured Artifacts and spirit embryos they held, all of which were empowered by the grotto-heaven's Profound Foundation.

Sixteen of them... their combined power likely rivaled a true Lotus Seat. If they formed a formation... even someone like Wei Xuanyin would have to turn and flee!

Miao Huanzun barely had time to remount his purple lightning when six beams of [Profound-Guarding Spirit Official's Dharma Light] shot out, locking onto him. He cursed inwardly, but a hazy spiritual mirror dropped from above, struggling to deflect the beams. The Touba scion, his expression grim, barked an order.

"Miao! Hand over the cauldron! We get it out of here, _then_ we split it!"

Miao Huanzun's face was grim. Why would he agree to that?

'Who knows if these statues are chasing me because _I_ touched the cauldron, or if they'll chase whoever _holds_ it. If it's the former, I'd just be doing all the dirty work for Touba Ci!'

He stubbornly refused to let go. Touba Ci was forced to change tactics. He used a divine ability of Profound Yellow Qi to block the advancing statues while thrusting his halberd forward, striking the cauldron hard.

The cauldron was already in a fragile state, barely suppressing its contents. How could it withstand such a heavy blow? The vibrating azure lid was thrown open, and a pillar of pure, purple-white light erupted, shooting straight into the sky like a column connecting heaven and earth.

"BOOM!"

The divine ability and dharma power Miao Huanzun was using to hold the cauldron instantly vanished. The azure cauldron shot skyward, and the brilliant purple-white light enveloped the entire area, as if all other colors in the world had been consumed by it. The [Sixteen Profound Divine Officials] froze in unison, their heads tilting upward.

The first thing to fly from the cauldron was a massive, purple-gold mace of Profound Thunder. It radiated bolts of lightning like a thousand falling stars. Three small, brilliant lightning swords followed closely behind it, shimmering with multicolored light. Every eye was instantly drawn to them.

Close behind them came eight wisps of lightning, each with a unique form and aura. All were terrifyingly powerful and brimming with spiritual energy. They immediately scattered, fleeing in all directions, making Miao Huanzun's eyes turn red with greed.

'Spiritual Artifacts! Purple Mansion Spirit Lightning!'

Spiritual sense was restricted in Wanling Heaven, but a spectacular light show like this was visible to all. The surrounding cultivators, who had been mere flickers of multicolored light in the distance, all stopped to watch. A commotion erupted. Spiritual Artifacts were rare sights, and now several were floating right before them. Who could possibly resist? Lights surged from all directions as divine abilities began to clash.

The Sixteen Profound Divine Officials seemed confused for a moment, but then, showing surprising intelligence, they split up. Each rode a beam of light, scattering in all directions to pursue the escaping artifacts. This, however, was exactly what the cultivators wanted. With the statues no longer acting in concert, their threat was drastically reduced.

Amidst the purple chaos, Touba Ci's gaze remained casual. The crescent blade on his halberd flicked out, hooking toward the great azure cauldron, which had just settled down and was now emanating a soft, green glow.

'I'll take this first, _then_ I'll deal with the others in the sky!'

"Vmm!"

The azure cauldron released a brilliant flash of light. Touba Ci's expression changed, his eyes narrowing slowly.

On the other side of the cauldron, a man had appeared, taking the opportunity to seize the Spiritual Artifact. His arm held the cauldron steady, and his piercing golden eyes met Touba Ci's across the distance.

Touba Ci's expression darkened, but he wasn't surprised. Both he and Miao Huanzun knew there was someone else hiding in the hall. He just hadn't expected the person to ignore the treasures in the sky to fight him for the cauldron. He spoke coolly.

"So, it was you."

His face remained impassive, but dense Profound Yellow dharma power surged down his arm and into the halberd. His divine ability and dharma power flared to their peak as he tried to yank the Spiritual Artifact back toward him.

Li Zhouwei exhaled sharply. Dense, scale-like golden patterns erupted on his palm and climbed up his arm. Even the corners of his golden eyes shimmered with light. The azure cauldron held firm, not moving an inch.

Touba Ci's expression turned ugly. "A Body Divine Ability?" he said, his voice cold. "Fast..."

The swirling cloud of Profound Yellow Qi behind him expanded violently. A great seal emerged from it, radiating multicolored light as it swelled in size, preparing to suppress Li Zhouwei. Four large characters were visible on its face:

[Shengle Touba]!

But Li Zhouwei was more than prepared. The Heavenly Light in the sky had already coalesced into a vast, white celestial gate. Blinding light shone down as auspicious clouds filled the air, adorned with fluttering banners. Tens of thousands of golden-armored soldiers stood upon those clouds, weapons at the ready, a sight so grand it drew the attention of everyone in the vicinity.

"RUMBLE!"

The next instant, a cataclysmic boom echoed. The descending 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' slammed into the seal as if striking adamantine. The gate faltered, straining against a massive force that threatened to overturn it. It teetered precariously, but it held, pinning the Touba seal in place.

Both Touba Ci and Li Zhouwei were inwardly shocked. Touba Ci couldn't believe his family's famous seal, renowned for its resistance to suppression, had been pinned. Li Zhouwei, on the other hand, was stunned that his Audience with the Celestial Gate was struggling so much.

Shock aside, Li Zhouwei's 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' was at its limit, but it _was_ suppressing the seal. Taking advantage of his planned attack, Li Zhouwei unleashed his Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light from between his brows. But Touba Ci was ready and quickly summoned a mirror to block it.

"CLANG!"

The two lights clashed in mid-air. Touba Ci's expression began to sour. He poured all of his Profound Yellow divine ability into his halberd, but the force coming from the azure cauldron was only increasing. A halberd wasn't a whip; he couldn't maintain his grip.

They were deadlocked for a moment. Touba Ci weighed his options. The cauldron wasn't his primary goal, and this man was relentless. If he delayed any longer, he'd miss his chance at the mace in the sky. He made a snap decision, flipping his halberd and soaring into the air to join the fight for the Spirit Lightning. He shot back a cold parting word.

"This isn't over!"

Li Zhouwei's expression was just as grim. Touba Ci was strong, and that stalemate had cost him precious time. Three Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues were already closing in, intent on retrieving the azure cauldron.

Still, the worst of it was over. At least he wasn't like Miao Huanzun, empty-handed and chasing desperately through the sky. He spun, swinging his halberd around to defend. The weapon instantly expanded to a massive size, blocking the sky-blotting sword and golden staff of the enormous statues.

"CLANG!"

The sword and staff struck the halberd's shaft simultaneously, erupting in a blast of golden-yellow Heavenly Light. Li Zhouwei tested the weight and sighed inwardly.

'Truly ingenious craftsmanship!'

A third statue summoned a silver-white profound bell. It flew high, casting down a gentle light that sought to imprison him. Li Zhouwei, all the while scanning the chaotic battlefield for a chance to grab the Spirit Lightning, fixed his gaze on that bell.

'It's a spirit embryo... what a brilliant technique. They must have been equipped with corresponding spirit embryos in advance, allowing the statues to draw nourishment from the grotto-heaven's Profound Foundation!'

His golden eyes scanned the area. With a sharp _clang_, he parried the two large statues and inverted his halberd, which shrank back to its normal size. His gaze remained fixed on the silver-white bell, sensing the concentrated metal-qi within it as a plan formed in his mind.

'These statues are in three groups. Two groups can grow to the size of mountains—they must be from some unknown Ancient Merging Daoist tradition. The last group, the six human-sized ones, seem to be spirit officials, and each is different... This one, with its aura that's like metal but not quite... it's just like the Vault Metal my uncle described!'

'The quality of these things is high. Even if they can't be preserved long-term, I have to deal with them anyway. I might as well capture this one. Before it dissipates, I can give it to Senior Liu, who cultivates Vault Metal! The same logic applies to the others... If I find suitable ones, I can capture them and trade them.'

After all, just having these three statues chasing him was a waste. A fiery realization struck him.

'Forget everything else. Of these sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues... these six normal-sized ones are the real treasures!'
