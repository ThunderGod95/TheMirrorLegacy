# Chapter 863: Chiluo

The *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was an art of brilliant and majestic power, a manifestation of the Bright Yang itself. In terms of sheer spectacle, few techniques could compare to its magnificent and radiant display. Now, a mountain-sized Celestial Gate materialized in the sky, casting its light in all directions. To the north, the temple tenants prostrated in worship; to the south, the common folk kowtowed in terror.

The three Merciful Ones felt as if a colossal mountain range was pressing down on them, rendering them immobile. A continuous, grinding pressure descended from the celestial gate, layer by suffocating layer. Li Ximing then raised a hand to his lips.

“Hmph.”

He exhaled a breath of red and white energy that transformed into a torrent of shimmering golden *Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire*, which poured down toward the base of the gate. Erupting alongside it was the scorching violet flame of the Bright Yang, instantly turning the area into a sea of fire.

Sweat poured from the three figures as the golden lacquer on their Dharma Bodies began to melt, dripping into the blazing inferno below where it evaporated with a sizzle. This only served to strengthen the divine ability's oppressive force.

Worse still, the sacred light from the Buddhist Land above was severed, causing the protective, life-sustaining iridescent glow around them to weaken significantly. Only the innate Treasure Light of their Dharma Bodies still flickered, offering a feeble defense against the surging flames.

Regardless of the trio's desperate struggle below, Li Ximing sat calmly atop the Celestial Gate, a realization dawning on him.

'So this is why Daoist Master Kui Qi had to call me back,' he thought. '*Audience with the Celestial Gate* is incredibly effective against these Merciful Ones. Its grinding suppression and ability to sever their connection to other powers strike right at their weakest point!'

Every divine ability had its unique strengths. *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was renowned for its oppressive power. While it didn't grant Li Ximing the decisive, enemy-slaying force of Yehui's or Changxiao's techniques, once it gained the upper hand, it crushed its opposition with the inexorable, righteous might of a great mountain. The Merciful Ones, who possessed no divine abilities of their own, were utterly pinned.

As the white celestial gate in the sky pressed down with ever-increasing weight, the two Merciful Ones in the back turned anxiously to their leader. One of them spoke in a low voice, "Master Pingling, we juniors have only recently ascended to the Buddhist Land. Our power is weak and our standing is low. We beseech you to borrow a divine ability from the Buddhist Land to preserve our three Dharma Bodies!"

The three-eyed Merciful One in the lead hesitated. He was faring slightly better than the others. While channeling his own power to help them resist the pressure, he watched them sweat profusely, their golden lacquer melting away in the True Fire. He gritted his teeth and sent a telepathic message.

"This divine ability is bizarre beyond belief. You think I don't want to borrow power? We may have our place in the Buddhist Land, but our pleas can still reach it. The problem is, the light from the Buddhist Land might not be able to descend! I don't serve directly under a Developing Wisdom or a Golden Lotus Seat—how could I possibly have that much Faith Power?"

His two companions, however, looked at him with suspicion. They knew that if this fire kept burning, Pingling might last until reinforcements arrived, but they certainly wouldn't. Realizing he was just trying to avoid shouldering the burden alone, they could only say in low voices, "We are willing to lend you our strength, Master!"

A flicker of delight crossed Pingling's face, but before the words were fully spoken, a brilliant white light shot out from within the flames. Concealed by the radiance of the gate above, it struck like a venomous snake. The hammer-wielding Merciful One barely had time to raise his Dharma Tool before letting out a cry of agony.

"Ah!"

The light struck his metallic eyes, and his left eye instantly exploded into a shower of golden dust. The three Merciful Ones didn't dare hesitate any longer. They formed hand seals in unison, and the three-eyed Pingling began to chant urgently.

"The eight directions are without measure, all is Xuwang. Right and wrong, all are but empty thoughts… Where the Treasure Light shines… for inconceivable merit, only our Buddhist Land seeks verification! This lowly cultivator beseeches a divine ability!"

Li Ximing's *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was growing stronger by the moment. He suddenly looked up, sensing a tremor in the Great Void, as if another world was drawing near. Auspicious clouds materialized in the sky, and a single, five-colored beam of light descended.

The ray of light was only about the size of a person’s head, a lone pillar attempting to reach its target. However, it was halted above the *Audience with the Celestial Gate*, its brilliance shining down upon the technique itself.

The moment the light touched his ability, Li Ximing frowned, feeling a searing pain. The *Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen* immediately rushed to intercept it, but the colored light passed through unhindered. It was only diminished by the grinding power of the celestial gate, losing more than half its strength before it finally passed through the radiant barrier and landed on the three-eyed Merciful One's head.

As the light entered him, Pingling's eyes shone with a crystalline light, and dense runes lit up across his body. Two more arms burst from his back and pressed against the base of the *Audience with the Celestial Gate*, attempting to heave the massive structure upward.

Li Ximing merely glanced at him, the Profound Light in his brow re-forming. A cold smile touched his lips, and his eyes gradually turned a pale gold. He formed a hand seal, his resolve hardening.

'Well, well, well. Instead of using that power to escape, you actually think you can overturn my *Audience with the Celestial Gate*? Let's see you try!'

Holding nothing back, he circulated his spiritual qi, and the radiance of his divine ability intensified. The light within the celestial gate became blindingly brilliant, washing the world in white.

This sight caused Vija in the sky to look on with surprise and Taixi on the ground to grimace. Daoist Master Kui Qi, however, was not surprised at all; Xiukui was clearly aware of both the True Fire and the *Audience with the Celestial Gate*. He simply exhaled a puff of black smoke.

Taixi's expression was grim. Though he had expected these three idiots to cause trouble, he hadn't thought they would be so thoroughly suppressed so quickly.

His own power was a notch above Chen Yin's, and with the *Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl* to contain his opponent's Water Mansion, he had already gained the upper hand. Seeing the situation, he shook his head inwardly and began to ponder.

'They said Chen Yin and Li Ximing would be too occupied to intervene, yet here they both are. Could it be that Zhelu was never confident and was just tricking me into taking the lead? If that's the case, don't tell me there's a Lingmei waiting in the Great Void as well?'

The political machinations within the Buddhist Land were no less complex than those of the Immortal Dao. Although Taixi and Zhelu were both Mahas of the Way of Emptiness and ostensibly on the same side, there was a clear power disparity. Zhelu had been the one to promote Taixi, so Taixi acted as his subordinate, but he had never let his guard down. His heart sank as a thought took root.

'Zhelu, you have plenty of Merciful Ones under your command, not to mention those who serve the Golden Lotus Seats... yet you couldn't bear to send two of them? Meanwhile, five of my men were deployed, and two have already lost their Dharma Bodies. Dammit... that Tinglan and Qiuhu, they are just in the early Purple Mansion Realm. Kui Qi might need a Maha, but he could also be tied down by a group of Merciful Ones?'

The formation array in the sky that was suppressing Tinglan and the other cultivator belonged to someone else. Taixi couldn't grasp the situation and had no news from Zhelu. A feeling of wrongness crept over him. He stood still, pinching his fingers together in a divinatory gesture. Half of his eye instantly transformed into a sphere covered in dense runes, allowing him to peer through the Great Void toward the Buddhist Land, urgently sending out a call for aid.

Meanwhile, the Merciful One Pingling was in an utterly wretched state. His four arms, straining against the ever-heavier Celestial Gate, flickered in and out of existence. The other two, shielded by his efforts, were finally able to catch their breath, but their expressions were just as grim.

It wasn't that Pingling insisted on a futile last stand; it was that he had no choice. The colored light was a divine ability granted by the Buddhist Land, and there were only a few types available. You got what you were given. He wasn't a Maha who could wield a variety of wondrous abilities at will. Worse, the power had been slashed by sixty percent by that insidious *Audience with the Celestial Gate*. What good could it possibly do?

But their troubles were far from over. Li Ximing wasn't about to wait. A streak of white light shot through the air—the *Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light* had returned.

Fortunately, the other two had a moment's respite and hurriedly used their Dharma Tools to block it. The hammer-wielding Merciful One took the brunt of the blow and coughed up a spray of golden dust. But then, a flash of bright light streaked through the sea of fire. The Profound Light flared, and a pale golden sleeve wreathed in golden flames swept out from within!

Li Ximing had planned this strike for some time. While the *Sun's Resonant Parting Art* didn't synergize perfectly with his True Fire, he had personally descended in his Dharma Body. Using the *Valley Wind Guide-Fire*, he had gathered an immense concentration of flames in his palm. Finally, catching his opponent off guard, he slammed it viciously into the hammer-wielding Merciful One's chest.

Li Ximing possessed no Body Divine Ability, so the Merciful One should have had a chance to react. However, one of his hands was occupied blocking the *Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light* with his hammer, while another arm had been scorched by the fire. He was a fraction of a second too slow and had no choice but to take the palm strike head-on.

"BOOM!"

An intense burst of True Fire erupted. The Merciful One let out a single howl as a column of Purple Mansion Realm True Fire instantly punched through his chest, sending golden fragments flying. The three-eyed Merciful One's eyes widened in fury. He retracted all four of his hands, absorbing the full force of the celestial gate's pressure, and slammed them down into the flames.

"Pow!"

Li Ximing took the hit, his body dissolving into light and retreating. Suppressed by the divine ability, the three had no way to pursue him and could only watch as he reappeared atop the gate.

The hammer-wielding Merciful One was charred black, a massive wound nearly cleaving his torso in two. Sixty to seventy percent of his aura had vanished. He spat out mouthfuls of golden lacquer and muttered, "What a vicious fire art!"

From their perspective, Li Ximing's palm strike had come without any warning. He must have been secretly chanting, using his divine ability to mask the fluctuations of his True Fire while he slowly gathered its power. It was an undeniably vicious tactic. Li Ximing, having returned to the gate, spat out a mouthful of Bright Yang light. Protected by the *Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen* and his opponent's rushed counterattack, he had only suffered some internal turmoil. He nodded to himself.

'These monks' bodies are tough... but thankfully, they're clumsy.'

The palm strike had no real divine ability behind it; it was pure True Fire and Talisman Qi. Against someone like Changxiao or Yehui, whose movements were enhanced by their own abilities, such a direct attack would never have landed. But against a Merciful One, it was far easier.

Seeing this, the three below were filled with dread. If this continued, Li Ximing would slowly torture the other two to death. Pingling had to send a hurried, low-voiced message.

'This man is treacherous, a true scion of Wei Li. Every single spell art he cultivates is clearly designed to counter us Buddhist cultivators. He is a true enemy of our path, and his strength cannot be underestimated. We can't delay any longer!'

He delivered the message with urgent speed, and the two behind him nodded in vehement agreement, their faces pale with lingering fear as he brought up the situation inside the main battle.

'The *Immeasurable Water and Fire* is too terrifying. It severs the Great Void. Not only can those inside not perceive the outside world, but they are also afraid of causing collateral damage. We would have been better off facing the enemy out here and simply praying to the Buddhist Land for aid.'

The three of them had actually been relieved when they were sent out. The woman inside, standing atop a purple pavilion and wielding an earthen gourd, was unleashing *Immeasurable Water and Fire* that could only be described as the bane of the Merciful Ones. Other techniques merely severed the Great Void; her fire completely erased it! If even a speck touched you, the Great Void would be annihilated wherever you fled. If you were heavily injured, you wouldn't even be able to die and return to the Buddhist Land!

The *Immeasurable Water and Fire* was troublesome enough on its own, but the *Supreme Minister's Gourd* it was channeled through—a legacy of the Purple Smoke Gate—amplified it to the point where the flames were about to engulf the entire grand array. If not for the personal intervention of the Maha Zhelu, the chaos inside would have been unimaginable.

The three of them were the weakest, so they had been sent out, spared from facing those terrifying flames. But now, trapped under Li Ximing's suppression, it was only a matter of time before their Dharma Bodies were ground down, and all their cultivation wasted.

Just then, the eight-armed Dharma wheel in the sky finally lit up. A red-skinned, green-eyed monk emerged, riding a short-furred tiger whose coat burned like flames, giving it a majestic and imposing air.

He stepped through the air, a hint of relief still lingering in his eyes, though his expression was somewhat grim. His gaze swept across the Celestial Gate spanning the heavens, and he froze for a second before a look of delight appeared.

"A remnant of Wei Li!"

He strode forward and grabbed at the air, pulling out a crimson pagoda. His eyes bulged with fury as the pagoda shot out a beam of light. The red-faced Merciful One roared, "You still dare to act so presumptuously!"

An intense sense of crisis washed over Li Ximing; he knew this newcomer was no simple opponent. He whirled around, the Profound Light from his brow shooting forward to meet the attack. A deafening explosion echoed in the sky. As the smoke cleared, the red-faced Merciful One was already upon him, riding his tiger, his iron-like palms crashing down toward Li Ximing's face.

The *Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen* flashed into existence, only to be shattered by the palm strike. The tiger beneath the Merciful One let out a sudden roar. A great chanting of sutras filled Li Ximing's ears, causing his spiritual qi to stagnate and forcing him to retreat.

Unexpectedly, this person's Dharma Body was incredibly powerful. He didn't pause for an instant. A red light flared in his eyes, and he opened his mouth to spew a rain of crimson flames.

Although the Geng Mountain Spiritual Absorption couldn't evade fire, Li Ximing's *Audience with the Celestial Gate* bolstered his Dharma Body, granting him greater resistance to flames. Furthermore, standing upon the gate itself, he was shielded by its Profound Light. He took the brunt of the fiery attack with only a slight pain in his chest and no serious injury. But the flames clung to him. He immediately brought two fingers together and spat out his own *Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire*.

The red-faced Merciful One fought fiercely, his strength clearly on another level compared to the three below. But he knew he would still struggle against an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, so he remained on high alert. He was merely scorched back a single step, using his pagoda to block the attack.

The pagoda was forged from Geng Metal. While all fires could refine metal, and it was thus vulnerable to True Fire, Geng Metal was the most fire-resistant of the three major types. The newcomer, Chiluo, was also a master of flames, allowing him to temporarily suppress the fire.

With the *Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire* redirected, the flames at the base of the celestial gate finally died down, and the great gate began to tremble.

Li Ximing sighed internally. He used a divine ability to extinguish the flames on his chest. Facing the red-faced Merciful One's advancing pagoda, the *Audience with the Celestial Gate* finally lifted from the ground. He dropped into its center, using the technique's power to shield himself.

Having been roasted by the True Fire for so long, the other three were finally free. The Treasured Artifacts of the sword and hammer wielders were slightly warped from the heat. They flew up into the air and respectfully said, "Our thanks, Lord Chiluo!"

"It's nothing!"

The red-faced Merciful One had eyes only for Li Ximing and had no time to waste on them. His eyes flashed as he shielded the three from the descending Profound Light. He recalled his pagoda to block the *Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light*, his mind racing.

'I must devise a plan to kill this man!'

Li Ximing stood unshaken, his hand hovering near the spiritual artifact hidden in his sleeve.

If this battle concerned his own interests, he would have continued to pin down the three without hesitation, clashing head-on with Chiluo. He would have held on, at least until the two weaker Merciful Ones were beaten to the point where they could no longer fight. That would have been the best way to defeat all four of them.

But this battle was someone else's problem. To fight so fiercely and allow Chiluo to get into close quarters would inevitably result in injury. Whether that pill he had could heal him was one thing; after so many years of struggle, he knew how much time and energy it took to recover from a single wound, and he had no desire to waste any more.

Besides, his opponents couldn't surround him with a formation, and the *Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass* gave him a means of escape. There was no need to fight these four to the death. He stood quietly, observing.

'Every one of these Merciful Ones who sees me is filled with greed. They won't let this go easily!'

Just as he predicted, Chiluo was already forming hand seals for a new technique, with the other three protectively surrounding him. Li Ximing's gaze hardened, falling once more on the hammer-wielding Merciful One, whose body was already battered and broken.

'First, I'll send this fool on his way!'
