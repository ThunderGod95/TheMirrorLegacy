# Chapter 969: A Turn of Events

Frost gathered as biting cold energy rolled in waves.

"Crack."

The sound of fracturing ice echoed through the hollow cavern. The moment Li Zhouwei landed, the boundless darkness of the subterranean chamber was instantly banished by light.

As the two Daoist Masters from the Bright Yang Daoist Tradition set foot in this place, they realized just how dense the spiritual energies echoing through the cavern were. Despite being constantly suppressed and absorbed by a divine ability, the energies still roiled, faintly threatening to swell into a storm.

More importantly, these energies seemed to be gushing forth from the earth veins and water channels below. A single misstep, and they would likely erupt with uncontrollable violence.

'I wonder how long this has been suppressed... If it weren't kept in check, spiritual veins would have surfaced all over the region long ago. The lands above would be buried in a perpetual blizzard, a frozen waste.'

The light radiating from the two men's bodies caused the thick frost to show immediate signs of melting, threatening to shatter the hard-won equilibrium. However, a surrounding divine ability of swirling white light quickly converged, freezing all fluctuations in place.

Tianwan stood within the cavern, watching them with a spectral, unnerving gaze.

Li Ximing loathed her. He even harbored a deep-seated hatred. Setting aside the feud over Crimson Reef Island, there was the incident with the Radiant Sky Stone. While it had technically been an exchange, it had cost his brother, Li Xijun, his life. Li Ximing knew his own family had been the ones trying to seize the spiritual item, so they didn't stand on moral high ground, and he wasn't consumed by thoughts of revenge. Still, faced with the person directly responsible, a visceral, emotional revulsion was inevitable.

If Tianwan's divine ability weren't superior, and if she hadn't largely kept to herself these past years, and if she hadn't also become a bitter enemy of Changxiao... reason dictated it was unwise to antagonize both parties simultaneously. Otherwise, Li Ximing truly couldn't have mustered a single civil word for her.

Now that Li Zhouwei had made his landing, Li Ximing could only hang back, his face a cold mask, pointedly refusing to look at her. He listened as his junior spoke, his voice frigid,

"Senior... it is a significant breach of protocol to come to our Wilderness unannounced!"

But Tianwan merely stepped down from her central dais of ice and snow and said quietly,

"Have you two come seeking Li Quantao?"

At her words, Li Zhouwei's suspicion was confirmed. He linked his divine ability with his grand-uncle's, his thoughts racing,

'It really is Hongxue Gate!'

The former ruins of Hongxue Gate were located in the Wilderness. Li Zhouwei had his suspicions the moment he saw this Great Daoist Master, and now, upon hearing Li Quantao's name, he was certain.

Li Ximing's perpetually cold expression softened slightly, and his heart stirred.

'So it really is about Li Quantao... He was brother Xizhi's close friend. The Old Master was always worried about him... To think he was here all this time...'

Amidst the flashes of white light, another figure suddenly rushed in from a distance, materializing quickly. He wore a Daoist robe of dark-patterned blue and had a bitter expression on his face.

"Fellow Daoists!"

It was Daoist Master Xuanyi of Mount Jingyi!

He and Li Ximing had met once before and were on reasonably good terms. He never expected to run into him here! 'He must be in the area stabilizing the earth veins.' Li Ximing was slightly startled, musing internally,

'The Chunyi faction is powerful, and he's at odds with the Chunyi Dao Gate. It's only normal he'd seek help from Crimson Reef Island...'

Li Ximing's expression softened slightly as he nodded in greeting. The ice-and-snow beauty before them spoke, her voice low,

"Ning Wan was overwhelmed trying to manage the Azure Pond, which gave me the opening to capture Li Quantao at Chengshui Marsh. I have been searching for Hongxue's legacy for years and had already located this place. She fell a step behind and even lost Li Quantao. So, I came with Xuanyi to open this hidden cache."

"Since you two have found your way here, we can agree not to interfere with one another. Once my business is concluded, I will hand Li Quantao over to your clan. All I want is the Hongxue Dao Lineage."

She gave a slight smile, and the chill snowflakes swirling through the cavern seemed to drift upward at her expression.

"This is your territory, after all. Once this is done, I can allow your clan to choose one spiritual resource from the findings."

Li Ximing remained silent. Li Zhouwei, however, began to pace slowly, taking in the surrounding scenery of ice and frost as if admiring it. Then, he spoke quietly,

"You've sent quite a few messages to the Azure Pond, haven't you, Senior?"

Tianwan's smile slowly faded. She stared at the golden-eyed man, listening to the White Qilin's heavy voice reverberate through the cavern.

"Since Li Quantao has been in your hands for some time, Senior, and you are capable of opening this place yourself... why did you insist on cooperating with Senior Ning Wan?"

He turned his head, his illusion-piercing golden eyes boring straight into hers.

"Because this place is located in the Wilderness. Perhaps opening the Mystic Realm wouldn't cause a massive disturbance or attract too many Daoist Masters, but it would be impossible to hide from the masters of the Wilderness. At that time, the one guarding the Wilderness was Daoist Master Ning... You knew you couldn't hide it from her, Senior, so you chose to cooperate."

Tianwan didn't answer. Li Zhouwei continued,

"Which means... there must be more than one or two parties coveting the Hongxue Dao Lineage. The stakes must be so high that you can't easily deter lesser rivals, and there must be other, more troublesome powers who would be all too happy to intervene... That's why you had to keep this a secret."

Li Zhouwei stated calmly,

"You don't need to humor me, Senior. Our two families have no friendship to speak of. And this isn't just about us being the masters of the Wilderness. The truth is, if my family decides to speak up, we can ensure you never achieve your goal."

A cold expression finally crept onto Tianwan's face. "The Azure Pond is riddled with holes," she said flatly. "It can't keep a single secret."

Her voice was laced with ice.

"Must we become mortal enemies? It seems the two of you don't care about Li Quantao's life."

Their relationship was already poor, and Tianwan's power was sufficient to suppress them both. With the prize before them being so critical, she pressed on,

"Does the White Qilin still not see the path ahead? Changxiao is waiting for an opportunity, and you are the only one he fears. I have no desire to offend your clan, but if you insist on ruining my plans, will Zhaojing still be able to travel to the Eastern Sea? A hundred years from now, what path will be left for your Li Clan?"

The atmosphere between them plummeted to a freezing point. Xuanyi was mortified. He had been invited here to help, not to make an enemy of the Li Clan. He had the sudden, powerful urge to turn invisible and flee.

"By all means, Fellow Daoists, try me. Crimson Reef Island is nothing but a burden to me. But if the Li Clan is thrown into turmoil, how many of your kinsmen will die because of you?"

The words had barely left her mouth when the young man before her began to laugh.

His brow and eyes seemed to contort, sinking deep into his skull. Dense, platinum-white scales materialized around his neck. He smiled, revealing rows of fine, sharp white teeth, and his voice dropped to a hoarse, magnetic rumble, like the low growl of a beast.

"Dying for me... is that not as it should be?"

His pupils had transformed into perfect, gold-white rings. He grinned.

"Crimson Reef is a burden? Is Moongaze not? You dare try to hoard this prize for yourself, right in front of me? I will make you regret it."

A heavy silence fell. Xuanyi's expression froze, his eyes wide with disbelief as he stared at Li Zhouwei's transformed appearance.

'He really is the White Qilin!'

Tianwan, despite being so rudely rebuked, showed no outward sign of wrath. She only frowned, her heart simmering with annoyance. She knew she couldn't kill the man before her.

'He truly is the White Qilin...' she sighed internally. 'You can't judge him as a man. He has the heart of an autocrat, concerned only with himself.'

She truly felt a pang of apprehension. Li Zhouwei's status was unique. He would achieve his divine ability with incredible speed. And while his ultimate demise was certain, he would have a period of blinding brilliance before then. People like him always followed through on their threats. She, Tianwan, had betrayed the Golden Feather. She had no powerful backing, and a long life ahead of her. She intended to plot for the True Monarch realm in the years to come and could not afford a single misstep. Hadn't even Changxiao gone into hiding?

Never mind Tianwan; even Li Ximing was secretly startled. Xuanyi quickly stepped forward to play the peacemaker, hissing in a low voice,

"Wanling Heaven is nearly upon us! This is no time to fight and get injured... It's truly unwise..."

Tianwan narrowed her eyes and relented, her voice low.

"Since Ning Wan is in hiding, your clan is the only one left to guard the Wilderness. You can mask the disturbance for me. That is far better than having the powers from the North find this place, in which case none of us will get anything!"

"As for the Hongxue Dao Lineage, we will divide it."

She adopted a posture of grudging acceptance, though her eyes remained unsettlingly calm.

"I must have the cultivation manuals and the spell arts. Among the other items, there is also something I am determined to get!"

Li Ximing looked as if he was about to speak, but she cut him off, her voice haunting.

"I need more than just a Dao Lineage cultivation manual. If you push me too hard, Fellow Daoists, I might as well invite the Northern Daoist Traditions here. Trading the Hongxue Dao Lineage in exchange for my, Tianwan's, allegiance... I imagine they would find that a very attractive bargain."

"I must have this. I will not hesitate, even if it means getting entangled in the conflict between the North and South!"

She answered with iron certainty. Li Zhouwei merely sneered, flicked his sleeve, and turned to leave, his chilling words lingering behind him,

"I don't care how you two divide it. My family will be taking a share!"

With the "bad cop" gone, the atmosphere relaxed considerably. Li Ximing, unwilling to speak further with Tianwan, turned to Xuanyi and said flatly,

"Fellow Daoist, if you agree, we will stand guard above and mask the spiritual energy fluctuations."

Xuanyi, still trying to smooth things over, quickly agreed. "Yes... yes... We'll be imposing on your clan, then! There's still time... We can discuss the details later!"

Tianwan gazed at Li Ximing, her eyes bright and piercing, as if she understood the source of his enmity. "That incident back then," she said softly, "was indeed a plot against Tu Longjian, but wasn't your clan also leveraging the situation for your own gain? Sacrificing a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in exchange for a Radiant Sky Stone... it was just a transaction. Are you really going to lay all the blame on me? That same Radiant Sky Stone helped make you who you are, Li Ximing. Why cling so stubbornly to right and wrong?"

It would have been better if she had remained silent. At her words, Li Ximing, who had already started to leave, couldn't stop himself from spinning back around.

"If not for the divine ability's interference, Guo Hongyao would not have attacked, and you would not have intervened! None of this would have happened! Wasn't it only because your scheme failed that you 'compensated' us with the Radiant Sky Stone? How dare you speak of 'making' me!"

He threw the words at her grimly and vanished, stepping through the Great Void. As he left, he faintly perceived Tianwan frowning, a thoughtful expression on her face, as if she had gleaned some new information from his outburst.

---

Li Ximing rode a beam of light back into the mountain. Li Zhouwei was already seated within, calmly sipping tea. He smiled upon seeing him.

"That was a good way to rattle Tianwan and keep her from trying to control the situation. This matter is clearly vital to her. We have nothing to lose, whereas she does. The item is in our territory, so we deserve a share by right!"

Li Ximing's mood wasn't exactly stellar after that last exchange, but he quickly composed himself, managed a smile, and said,

"Don't be fooled by her sour expression. As long as she gets the key item she's after, she doesn't care about the rest. She was prepared to give us a share from the start. That was just a strategic retreat, feigning concession because she was afraid we'd push our luck. Otherwise, why would she have agreed so easily?"

Li Zhouwei nodded in agreement. Li Ximing then changed the subject. "Was that one of your transformation arts? With destiny bound to you, it was truly imposing."

In truth, Tianwan had looked terrified, and Li Ximing had felt uneasy himself. He'd only used the word "imposing" to be polite. Li Zhouwei, however, merely waved it off. "It looks intimidating, but the 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' is far from complete. It's nothing. To be compared to the ancient White Qilins, I'd need to be at the peak of the divine ability realm. If 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread' were perfected, I might be able to borrow a fraction of its power and tap into its unique marvels."

"I see."

Li Ximing took a seat and refilled Li Zhouwei's tea. As he sent for Li Jianglong to come up, he sighed.

"I know... If the situation weren't so unstable, we wouldn't have to play along with her. I just don't know how much of what she said was true. If she really does ally with the North, it would be disastrous for us."

Li Zhouwei remained noncommittal, though his eyes were clearly deep in thought. "She was right about one thing, though. You've been active across the seas recently, Grand-uncle, and the Wave-Suppressing Mansion is becoming more important. Tianwan is manageable, but Changxiao is the real threat. Once our family is stronger, he's the one we must deal with first."

Li Ximing replied, "There's still Cheng Yan to worry about."

"Cheng Yan is no threat." Li Zhouwei mused, "If we weren't worried about tipping our hand, with his meager abilities, our family could have dealt with him long ago... As for now..."

Just as he was contemplating this, Li Jianglong arrived from down the mountain and bowed to them both. Li Ximing gave him his instructions.

"There's something beneath the Wilderness. I want you to instruct our people to adjust and update the great formation. Shift some of the mountain ranges, stir things up, and create some spiritual energy fluctuations to provide cover."

"And remember, do it slowly, meticulously. Drag it out as long as possible. The key is to always have some kind of spiritual energy disturbance active to mask the real one."

"Yes, sir!"

Ever since his last talk with Li Zhouwei, Li Jiangqian had entered seclusion to polish his cultivation and had yet to emerge. Both of the talisman-holders were secretly racing against time. Li Jianglong, however, was highly capable and more than up to this task.

The two had just finished their arrangements when they suddenly looked up, sensing something. "Who is it?" Li Zhouwei asked, his brow furrowed.

A moment later, a report came from the foot of the mountain,

"My lords, Si Xunhui of the Azure Pond Sect is at the foot of the mountain. He says... he says... Daoist Master Qinghu is here to pay his respects."

Li Ximing froze for a second, then shot to his feet, exchanging a look with Li Zhouwei. The same name flashed through both their minds,

"Si Yuanli!"

They had both sensed the aura that abruptly descended outside the mountain. Si Xunhui was a direct descendant of the Si family, and given the timing, the person outside could only be Si Yuanli, who had been in seclusion for many years!

Li Zhouwei looked thoughtful. He glanced at Li Ximing and said quietly,

"Grand-uncle, you meet with him. I'll go keep an eye on the Wilderness."

Li Zhouwei had never had much contact with the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. Unsure of Si Yuanli's purpose, he naturally let Li Ximing, who always played the role of the affable peacemaker, feel him out. Li Zhouwei dissolved into light and vanished. Li Ximing, though inwardly surprised, plastered a joyous smile on his face and rode the wind out to greet their guest.

"Is that Fellow Daoist Si gracing us with a visit? Congratulations... truly, congratulations!"

Outside the mountain, amidst clusters of clouds, stood a middle-aged man with a sword on his back and a scroll at his waist. He was also wreathed in smiles.

"Indeed it is!"

Li Ximing's eyes swept over him, guessing that the scroll at his waist was the Huai River Map. At this, his enthusiasm grew even warmer.

The two Daoist Masters, who had barely met, now greeted each other with all the warmth of long-lost friends. Li Ximing laughed as he ushered him inside.

"It really is you! Senior Yuanxiu mentioned you to me several times back in the day. I always figured your breakthrough to the divine ability realm was only a matter of time. I'm truly happy for his sake... How is it that the Azure Pond hasn't announced the good news?"

At the mention of Yuanxiu, Si Yuanli's false smile gained a flicker of genuine emotion. He adopted a serious tone. "It was precisely because of a reminder left by my old ancestor. I came to see you at the first opportunity, Fellow Daoist. I haven't even reported the news to my sect yet!"

'That old fox...' Li Ximing cursed inwardly. 'So the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda wasn't a free gift after all!'

Though he cursed inwardly, Li Ximing's expression was one of deep emotion. "To think, when I broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm all those years ago, the first person I saw was Senior Si. And now, you've rushed to see me... It just shows the profound karmic bond between our two families."

"Indeed, indeed."

Si Yuanli was keen to build an alliance and get involved in the current situation. Li Ximing, eyeing the Spiritual Treasure with hopes of borrowing it, was happy to play along. The two shamelessly flattered each other for a while, solidifying their families' "friendship," before finally sitting down at the table. Si Yuanli sighed.

"How the times have changed. It's truly unpredictable!"

He began to ask for details, and Li Ximing leaked a few pieces of information. As expected, Si Yuanli eventually asked,

"Baijiang Creek becoming the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter... was that truly Qiuhu's doing?"

Li Ximing smiled inwardly but shook his head with a grave expression. He simply raised one hand and pointed a single finger upward.

"Hsss..."

Si Yuanli's expression changed instantly. Li Ximing, intent on frightening him, thought to himself,

'The Azure Pond has finally fallen into chaos. I can't let this fellow think he's above it all and just focus on his own plans!'

His expression hardened as he spoke. "Fellow Daoist, do you recall a certain painting you once made?"

Si Yuanli was clearly taken aback and hesitated, unable to recall. He had loved painting all his life; how could he remember one specific piece? He watched as Li Ximing continued in a somber tone,

"The one depicting... that great personage."

At this reminder, Si Yuanli's heart trembled. He remembered. "That..."

Li Ximing's expression was complex. He frowned. "Did you know... your every move is seen by that personage? He borrowed that painting of yours to manifest. He even... he even asked in a cold voice... why you painted him to look so ferocious!"

"What?"

Si Yuanli's face went white. He shook his head instinctively, only for Li Ximing to add,

"You didn't even add color... but when he looks at it, what difference does that make?"

Li Ximing's description was so specific that Si Yuanli could pinpoint the exact moment he'd painted it. A chill went down his spine. "I... how could I have known..."

But Si Yuanli recovered quickly. After the initial panic, suspicion began to creep in. "While painting him may have been disrespectful... it was still used to help him take action in Jiangbei... It shouldn't... it shouldn't be that serious, should it?"

But Li Ximing's face was a mask of worry. "That would be for the best. But seeing as Fellow Daoist Ning still doesn't dare show her face... I fear something terrible has happened!"

Si Yuanli was a naturally suspicious and anxious person. The suggestion struck a nerve, and he nodded silently, his unease growing. Li Ximing seized the opening to change the subject. "What are your plans now, Fellow Daoist?"

Si Yuanli stroked his beard thoughtfully. "Wanling Heaven is about to descend... The fall of a Grotto-Heaven is always a major event, and I am naturally drawn to it. I will observe it... After that, I plan to visit a few old acquaintances of the Si family."

"But I also came here on a personal matter."

He smiled, hesitating for just a moment as if considering something, before beckoning Si Xunhui forward. "Xunhui... I'm sure you know him, Fellow Daoist. He is your esteemed brother's disciple and a direct descendant of my family. I've come this time... hoping to deepen the bond between our families by arranging his marriage."

"Oh?" Li Ximing hadn't expected him to be so direct and was momentarily put on the spot. Si Xunhui was, without a doubt, an exceptional talent. "Is that so? And who is the young lady he has his eye on?"

Si Yuanli stroked his beard, as if weighing his words. "I hear that Moongaze has several young women of the main line who are of a suitable age for Xunhui. I wonder... if you have any candidates in mind, Fellow Daoist?"

Li Ximing's greatest fear was hearing him say the name 'Li Que'wan'. He was absolutely unwilling to marry her off, and Si Xunhui would never agree to marry into their clan. He breathed an inward sigh of relief and frowned as if in thought. "We don't have many young women in our main line, and fewer still who are outstanding. Que'Wan's ambitions lie far and wide, and Quexi is confined to the blessed lands. There is... one other girl, Li Queyi. She is currently in the Xinyu Archipelago."

Although he knew she was the perfect candidate, he put on a troubled expression and shook his head. "The only pity is... she is a disciple of the Purple Smoke Gate. Her marriage is no longer a matter for the clan to decide. It's entirely up to her."

"Oh?"

Upon hearing this, however, Si Yuanli's expression actually turned to one of satisfaction.

He also doted on Si Xunhui. He had brought up the proposal mainly as a gesture of goodwill; whether it worked out or not was a simple matter of a compatibility. But the news that she was a disciple of the Purple Smoke Gate genuinely piqued his interest.

"This is an excellent match. We should just let the young people meet on their own. If it's meant to be, it will be. There's no need to say it was a clan arrangement. They can simply be two disciples from different sects who fell in love. That way, neither has to formally join the other's family register, and if any trouble brews in the future, it won't cause a scandal."

Li Ximing was also quite satisfied. He had visited the Xinyu Archipelago once and had an excellent impression of Li Queyi. Si Xunhui was practically one of their own already, handsome and exceptionally talented. It was only because the Si family was in an awkward position right now; otherwise, it would be hard to say who was getting the better end of the deal.

'Her personality is gentle, and she's very obedient. Si Xunhui, on the other hand, is extremely ambitious and sharp. If this truly works out, it would be a great opportunity for her. The Si family is resourceful... It's hard to say how deep this alliance could go, but maintaining a good relationship is always for the best.'

Both men were pleased with the arrangement, and Si Xunhui, standing to the side, was both shocked and overjoyed. The two seniors chatted about recent events and exchanged pleasantries, before Li Ximing seized an opportunity.

"Fellow Daoist Si, do you happen to know of the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill?"

At this, Si Yuanli paused, a strange feeling in his heart. "Naturally. Back then... in the Great Ning Palace, I was with an elder of your clan when we... acquired it."

The elder Si Yuanli referred to was, of course, Li Xuanfeng. He had always addressed Li Xuanfeng as a "Fellow Daoist," but out of respect for Li Ximing, he'd referred to him as an elder. Li Ximing shook his head with emotion. "I had heard that story, which is why I guessed you might have a Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill. I just thought I would ask..."

"I see!" At Li Ximing's question, Si Yuanli became hesitant. "Well... it's a precious pill. Are you, Fellow Daoist, looking to make an exchange for it?"

Li Ximing immediately realized that Si Yuanli, being naturally suspicious and having just broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm, was on high alert. He was afraid of being tricked into a bad trade. Now was not the right time to press the matter; it would only breed distrust. Besides, the Upper Shaman spirit embryo wasn't even formed yet, so there was no rush. He simply smiled.

"You've heard of Dingyang Zi, I presume. If you find yourself in Qize, you can ask to see the items I've entrusted to him. If anything there interests you, feel free to send me a message."

"Excellent!"

This was a much more palatable proposal. Si Yuanli smiled and nodded. Soon after, he took his leave, riding the wind up. He led his junior out through the formation and away from the great lake before finally speaking.

"Well? Are you satisfied?"

Si Xunhui smiled and bowed. "I will follow your arrangements completely, Daoist Master!"

Si Yuanli retracted his gaze, the smile fading from his eyes. Li Ximing's words began to circle in his mind, and his expression clouded over.

'The painting... He borrowed my painting to make his move... Suiguan is also an insidious, treacherous bastard. What was the meaning of that painting...?'
