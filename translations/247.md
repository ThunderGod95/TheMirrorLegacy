# Chapter 270: Raze to the Ground

Jiang Heqian sneered malevolently. His expression was so sinister and venomous that it even caused a slight change in the expressions of the guest cultivators present.

"Brother Heqian, our deep-seated hatred will finally be avenged today. Let us set off quickly! This is no minor skirmish on the eastern coast... we must be cautious," said Fei Wangbai.

It turned out that Jiang Heqian was an old acquaintance of Fei Wangbai, arranged to stir trouble among the families on the eastern coast. Despite many searches carried out by the Yu Family, they never found him, as he lived on a small hill near the Milin Prefecture.

Jiang Heqian, barely able to contain himself, growled viciously, "Let's go!"

————

Milin Prefecture was a flat region with lush forests, where the rich, dark, and moist soil could be squeezed to produce oil, making it an excellent place for nurturing life. Despite the numerous disturbances caused by the tens of thousands of Yu Family members, the land could still sustain hundreds of thousands of common people.

As roosters crowed and dogs barked, signaling the start of a new day, sunlight shone across the five immortal mountains of Milin Prefecture. Shadows rose from the mountains, and Yu Family's cultivators soared with the wind toward the central plain of the prefecture.

At this convergence point of the five immortal mountains, the spirit veins intertwined, nurturing vast stretches of spirit fields. The marketplace of Milin Prefecture was situated here, its formation hidden by the convergence of the five ground veins.

This grand formation had been meticulously crafted by the Yu Family, utilizing the family's ancestral Jade Court Guarding Formation, which not only defended against attacks from Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators but also empowered those within the formation. It had cost Yu Xiaogui a significant amount of Spirit Stones.

Yu Xiao'ou sat leisurely on a redwood chair, twirling his gray beard as he reached for an ancient book. As the eldest brother of the Xiao generation in the Yu Family, he was a peak Qi Cultivator at over 120 years old. Having long abandoned the idea of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, he took up a position in the marketplace, no longer cultivating but spending his days reading and watching plays, enjoying a rather comfortable life.

He had only read two or three pages of the book when he caught sight of a person approaching him hurriedly with a group of clansmen, calling out repeatedly, "Eldest Master! We have heard that the Li Family has attacked Mount Huazhong! The ancestor went there alone! The family head has sent people over, saying that we need to mobilize the family's cultivators."

"What?!"

Yu Xiao'ou sprang to his feet instantly, slapping the table in anger and panic, exclaiming, "Old Fifth is always so impatient and reckless! How could he go alone?! Li Tongya is notoriously cunning and malicious... What if the Li Family has set a trap? Li Chejing is now a Sword Immortal, how can we underestimate him?!"

The group was immediately struck dumb, falling silent right away. Yu Xiaogui was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, and only a few dared to address him as "Old Fifth" so casually. Given Yu Xiaogui's sullen nature, no one dared provoke him. Yu Xiao'ou's words caused them all to tremble with fear.

Yu Xiao'ou, having cultivated for over a hundred years, immediately saw through the overconfidence of Yu Xiaogui and Yu Mugao. The old man's jaw trembled and his beard quivered. "Where is Clan Uncle Yufeng?" he demanded anxiously.

"We do not know!"

A flurry of panic spread among the elders instantly. Yu Xiao'ou attempted to stabilize the situation hurriedly, shouting, "Silence!"

As the elders looked over at him, Yu Xiao'ou scolded them, saying, "You are all so old, yet you panic like this? Grab your weapons and follow me to Mount Huazhong to find Yu Xiaogui!"

The group nodded repeatedly and was about to take off when a loud voice called out to them, stopping them in their tracks.

"Wait!"

A young man in black clothes leaped out from the crowd, his voice stern, holding a letter up high.

"By order of the family head, we are not to go to Mount Huazhong!"

The elders immediately halted, looking around in hesitation. Yu Xiao'ou grew even more frustrated. He wanted to curse but then remembered his nephew Yu Mugao's intelligence. He held back his temper and huffed, "If the family head has a plan, just say it straight! Stop dilly-dallying!"

The young man hesitated given Yu Xiao'ou's seniority, and hurriedly apologized. Seeing him delay things even further, Yu Xiao'ou glared and cursed again, "Useless fool! Speak!"

The man stopped and shouted, "The family head's intention is... for all of us to head to the southern coast and attack Mount Lijing!"

Upon hearing these words, everyone held their breath and pondered. Yu Xiao'ou immediately understood that Yu Xiaogui was likely not in grave danger at Mount Huazhong, but merely entangled. He then clapped his hands, which caused his grizzly beard to flutter.

With his vast experience, he could infer the situation from the instructions alone. He quickly regained his composure, nodding repeatedly. "Mugao is truly vicious! It's no wonder he's Xiaogui's son. Like father, like son—the wicked produce the wicked! Listen up, everyone! We'll attack Mount Lijing!" he exclaimed.

As soon as Yu Xiao'ou had finished speaking, there was a scattered cheer from the crowd. Some looked at him in a daze, while others suddenly understood his intention. Seeing the varied reactions of the Yu Family's members, Yu Xiao'ou felt a burning anger rising within him. He kicked the man in front of him to the ground and cursed, "You idiot! Make sure to cover up the Yu Family name on your clothes and artifacts! Who attacks and leaves their name behind?! Idiot! Even a mortal shopkeeper would have more sense than you lot combined!"

The man, plump and hefty, rolled three times before getting up, nodding repeatedly.

Only then did the Yu Family cultivators come to their senses. They hurriedly tore their collars or used illusions to conceal their identities. Yu Xiao'ou's eyes turned red with rage as he cursed them all, saying, "These useless fools, all they do is eat and drink! What else can they do?!"
𝙛𝒓𝒆𝙚𝒘𝒆𝓫𝙣𝓸𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝒄𝒐𝓶

His heart felt like it was being scorched, and he shivered with cold anger. Suddenly, a thunderous roar erupted, causing dust to fall from the entire hall and the ground to shake violently.

Yu Xiao'ou felt a sudden chill in his heart and stepped back in dismay, his lips quickly losing their color. He clutched his robe tightly and muttered in a daze, "The Fei family... It is the Fei family... Uncle Yufeng... What has happened to Uncle Yufeng?"

Yu Xiao'ou felt dizzy. The few people below looked at him in confusion, whispering, "Is the grand formation being activated? Who dares to strike at this moment... Where is the ancestor? We must wait for the ancestor to arrive!"

Yu Xiao'ou steadied himself, feeling utterly exhausted. With a deep sigh, he ordered, "Maintain the formation flags and prepare to face the enemy!"

The Yu Family's cultivators entered the formation to hold their positions, while Yu Xiao'ou took command of the Jade Court Guarding Formation's diagram. The formation immediately brightened considerably.

In the sky, Fei Wangbai was clad in gray, his face indistinct.

"Fellow Daoist... I will leave this Jade Court Guarding Formation to you."

His voice was hoarse and raspy.

Jiang Heqian had also concealed his face, but neither his voice nor attire was disguised, and the mist covering his face was barely effective. His features were vaguely discernible, as if he didn't fear the Yu Family recognizing him

He replied coldly, "Rest assured, my friend! This Jade Court Guarding Formation was passed down personally by my grandfather... The Yu traitors only know that it can harness the power of the earth veins and combine multiple formations, but they are unaware of its true secrets!"

A milky white light screen rose from the formation below, and Yu Xiao'ou's face appeared faintly on the formation as a thunderous noise sounded.

"Why have you attacked our Yu Family's marketplace without reason? Please reconsider your actions; our ancestor is..." Yu Xiao'ou said, attempting to buy some time.

However, Fei Wangbai's sleeve swept across the formation, instantly producing a massive explosion from the formation that forcibly interrupted Yu Xiao'ou's words. His robe and cloak fluttered silently behind him. Fei Wangbai, fearing recognition, did not take out his spear. The power of his immortal foundation surged secretly, quietly activated.

Jiang Heqian sneered coldly, his expression twisting with rage while he clenched his teeth. Alone and unafraid, jade-like patterns emerged in his eyes. As he pressed his palms together, six jade-like beams of white light burst forth from his body, and the jade patterns extended from his elbows and his earlobes, floating in the air like white silk ribbons.

As soon as his immortal foundation had manifested, the Yu Family members below were visibly stunned, some even losing control of their formation points, which caused them to flicker slightly. The shock came from seeing Jiang Heqian's immortal foundation, which was identical to that of the Yu Family's old ancestor, Yu Yufeng, from many years ago. Such a sight caused them to speculate wildly amongst themselves.

Yu Xiao'ou was utterly horrified, looking as if he had seen a ghost.

"Jade Court General...! How is this possible?!"

Jiang Heqian had cultivated the immortal foundation, Jade Court General, from the Aged Courtly Path Scripture. This scripture had long lost its crucial essence—the Celestial Dust Qi. The Yu Family had only managed to preserve a portion of this spiritual qi, which was used on Yu Yufeng. Since then, no one had succeeded in cultivating it.

Now, seeing this cultivator activate his immortal foundation, the Jade Court General, Yu Xiao'ou's mind went blank, filled with countless conjectures.

He was so distracted that he ignored the two people attacking the formation, murmuring in a daze, "It is you..."

The two outside the formation did not give him a chance. Fei Wangbai did not use his spear, only suppressing the Jade Court Guarding Formation with spells and physical attacks.

Jiang Heqian leaped forward, placing his palms on the formation. The jade-like patterns extended from it and seemed to come alive, drilling into the milky-white formation and quickly spreading across its surface.

"What is this..."

Yu Xiao'ou's mind was in turmoil, and he noticed the formation growing increasingly unstable. His control over it, maintained through the formation diagram, weakened. His heart raced, feeling a mix of disbelief and inevitability. He murmured hoarsely, "It's the Jiang Family..."

The formation continued to shake, visible cracks now appearing on the Jade Court Guarding Formation as it flickered even more. Yu Xiao'ou heard terrified screams and faint sobbing outside the hall, and his grip slowly loosened.

CRACK!

The Jade Court Guarding Formation, painstakingly set up by the Yu Family and connected through the spirit veins of the five immortal mountains, shattered like fragile paper under Jiang Heqian's spell. The milky-white barrier faded, turning into countless streaks of light that disappeared into Milin Prefecture.

The dense cluster of buildings below was finally revealed. The Milin Prefecture marketplace was not yet open, and it was mostly occupied by Yu Family's cultivators and guest cultivators. With two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators among the invaders, the Yu Family's cultivators who had lost their formation's support fled in all directions.

Fei Wangbai's guest cultivators descended upon various formation points. Jiang Heqian, without hesitation, moved to the tallest palace, smashing its dome with a single step and landing swiftly inside.

BOOM...!

Yu Xiao'ou, struck by the backlash from the shattered Jade Court Guarding Formation, felt his organs ache and his mana drained completely. His body felt hollow, making an escape by flying an impossible task. He could only watch as tiles and rubble fell from the dome, retreating futilely.

"Are you... from the Jiang Family?"

Yu Xiao'ou no longer thought of fleeing, his expression complex due to the flurry of emotions he was feeling. Recognizing Jiang Heqian's cultivation of the Jade Court General, his targeting of the Yu Family and his method of breaking the Jade Court Guarding Formation, combined with Jiang Heqian's resemblance to his late wife, Yu Xiao'ou was convinced of his suspicions.

The Yu Family and the An Family had originally been external cultivators under the Jiang Family. After the Jiang family declined, the Yu and An families slowly carved away at them, piece by piece. Both families had Jiang Family's blood, and now, seeing a member of their former main family standing before them, Yu Xiao'ou's emotions were exceedingly complex.

Jiang Heqian's eyes barely opened, his pupils possessing the same jade-like clarity that Yu Yufeng had once had. His terrifying gaze bore straight into Yu Xiao'ou.

Jiang Heqian did not speak, using only his jade-like eyes to stare penetratingly into Yu Xiao'ou which caused him to stumble backward pathetically. Although Yu Xiao'ou was from the Xiao generation, his age surpassed that of Yu Yufeng due to accumulated years. His mother was from the Jiang Family, his grandmother was from the Jiang Family, he had married into the Jiang Family, and in the end... he was the one who murdered those in the Jiang Family.

Yu Xiao'ou's mind was flooded with chaotic visions—his mother, his grandmother... their eyes overlapped in this moment, like lightning flashing through his aged mind. Even without making a move, Jiang Heqian had already driven Yu Xiao'ou backward in retreat, one step at a time.

Poof!

Yu Xiao'ou figured that the middle-aged man before him might be his wife's younger brother, or even his cousin, or perhaps a distant relative. But before he could reach a conclusion, the jade-like hand had already pierced through Yu Xiao'ou's chest, extracting his still-beating heart.

A surge of intense satisfaction washed over Jiang Heqian, but the old man's sorrowful and shocked eyes made him feel a pang of remorse—a discomfort akin to swallowing a fly. He could not bear to look directly at him, and the ferocity in his gaze slowly faded into a wet, painful expression. Jiang Heqian soon got lost in his own thoughts.

Perhaps this old man is my brother-in-law, or even my uncle... or perhaps a distant relative.

Lowering his head, Jiang Heqian slowly withdrew his arm, causing Yu Xiao'ou to spit out a mouthful of blood, staining his gray beard with streaks of red. Yu Xiao'ou strained to see the middle-aged man's face, noticing his distinct upright and decent features. Despite the fierce and venomous eyes, they still bore a striking resemblance to his late wife—full of vitality with a subtle melancholic look.

His mind flashed back to the dim candlelight on their wedding night, when the woman's sorrowful gaze fixed on Yu Xiao'ou. At fifteen, Yu Xiao'ou had been utterly entranced, stroking her long hair and calling her Heqing lovingly.

As the world spun, Yu Xiao'ou felt the cruel irony of fate. His chest heaved like bellows as saliva dripped from the corners of his mouth due to the agonizing pain, falling drop by drop. Uncontrollably, urine seeped out, and the pitiable old man shuddered as he uttered two words weakly from his lips.

"Qing'er..."

Jiang Heqian laughed coldly, seemingly mocking him. Yu Xiao'ou only lowered his head to look at the white arm piercing through his chest. His wrinkled old hand gently, tenderly patted the arm, as if in comfort.

The last breath that had sustained his aged body finally left his body. Yu Xiao'ou's life force dissipated, and he slowly bowed his head, slipping into darkness.
