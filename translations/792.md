# Chapter 792: The End of the Line

Li Zhouluo remained silent, watching the Sect Master Kong collapse to the floor. Dili Guang, seeing this, shut the great hall's doors tight. The hall first fell into dimness before the lamps within flickered to life. Kong Guxi muttered, "Clan Head... Clan Head... Daoist Master... Daoist Master, he! I... *Ai*!"

This was, after all, a monumental event, so Li Zhouluo did not press him. He stood for a while, waiting until Kong Guxi finally seemed to regain some clarity. The old man brushed at his own hair, which had turned stark white in just a few short years, and bowed.

"The Ancestor is dead, and the Profound Peak Gate has crumbled. For years... one refused aid, another watched with folded arms. We were fortunate to receive the help of the Immortal Clan, allowing a few juniors in the clan to survive. This kindness... this old man has etched it into his heart. The entire Kong Clan has etched it into their hearts...

"Now, the clouds have parted to reveal the moon. The Tongxuan Dao lineage has come to our rescue, delivering us from the sea of suffering and allowing us to return to our mountain gate. However, our Dao lineage ends here. From this day forward, there is only the Kong Clan. There is no more Profound Peak."

"Senior Kong Tingyun is still out there... Rest easy, esteemed elder..."

Li Zhouluo offered a few words of comfort. Kong Guxi listened respectfully before replying, "Since the Profound Peak Dao lineage ends here, there is no longer any talk of Daoist scriptures. I have already brought the *Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra* of the Fool's Mountain Chase. Please... Moongaze... accept it!"

He retrieved a jade-yellow slip from his sleeve, knelt with a thud, and offered it up with both hands clasping either end. Li Zhouluo rushed to help him up, but his cultivation was far inferior to the other man's; naturally, he couldn't lift him.

Kong Guxi choked back a sob. "Since we are going to the Sacred Writ Gate , the *Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra* must be returned to the Xuanmu Divine Writ Dao lineage, returned to the sect. In the future, my descendants will have meager fortunes and shallow fates. We may not be able to continue cultivating the Great Dao of Profound Light Moving Mountains... Please, Moongaze, keep a copy!"

He snapped his head up, his eyes bulging wide. His already gaunt face looked doubly aged beneath that intense stare. He stared deeply at Li Zhouluo, clutching his sleeve tightly, and moaned incoherently, "Leaving it with your esteemed clan is good... leaving it here is good. This is a fine cultivation method, one with a long history. Fifty years... a hundred years from now, they can take a look, yes...?"

The sentence was disjointed, the "they can take a look" seemingly referring to the Li family. But his eyes, bulging as if they might fly from their sockets, and his pleading gaze had their intended effect. Understanding struck Li Zhouluo like lightning.

'Returning the *Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra* to the Xuanmu Dao lineage is a certainty. They will surely have methods to sever the inheritance. Whether the Kong family can borrow it to practice in the future... remains unknown...

'He is leaving a copy of the *Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra* at Moongaze Lake, waiting. Fifty or a hundred years from now, when the Sacred Writ Gate lowers its guard, someone from his Kong clan might have the chance to come and view it. They will not have their Dao path completely severed, left with no chance to ever rise again!'

He placed his hand over the old man's. In a voice that was both soothing and deliberately ambiguous, he said, "The Daoist Master is concerned... Why stop at only a hundred years?"

The words worked. Kong Guxi pressed the jade slip into his hands, whispering, "The *Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra* is here... it's just a Purple Mansion Dao lineage, nothing more. My gratitude is endless. This is just a small token..."

His face was a deathly white as he remained kneeling, trembling as if having just survived a terrible danger. He quickly took his leave. The *Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra* felt heavy in Li Zhouluo's sleeve, compelling him to hurry back to the main seat.

He inspected it with his spiritual sense. It was indeed the *Profound Light Mountain-Moving Sutra*. Not only that, it also contained *Viewing the Pavilion Terrace, Forged in Fire* and another manual, *The Art of Wondrous Earth and Moving Treasured Mountains*, which detailed the art of shifting and moving mountains.

Li Zhouluo placed the jade slip quietly on the table. The image of Kong Guxi's eyes still lingered in his mind. After witnessing the plight of the Profound Peak Sect Master, he suddenly felt his own situation wasn't so troublesome. He gave an order:

"Ask Protector Cui to make a trip... personally escort the members of Profound Peak back to their mountain gate. Ensure all courtesies are perfectly observed. We must not allow others to misunderstand."

Dili Guang immediately departed. A woman in white robes, carrying a sword, entered the hall and waited below. Li Zhouluo dismissed the contingent of the Jade Court Guard, then lowered his voice. "Xinghan..."

Li Xinghan hadn't been able to attend the meeting in Qingdu Hall, but as the current eldest sister of the First branch, she knew a great deal. Her expression was grim. She stepped forward and cupped her hands. "Those elders are all too accustomed to using public office for private gain. They have made things difficult for you, brother."

Li Zhouluo gave a dry laugh. "Right now, I'm thinking about Xingsai. Zhoufang and the others still feel it isn't enough. They don't just want compensation; they want shelter..."

He explained the lengthy affairhow to provide these people with care without breeding new problems. Every detail had to be calculated. Li Xinghan listened, sighing inwardly.

Putting herself in his shoes, given Li Zhouluo's family status and background, he lacked neither resources nor Dharma Artifacts. He had only taken the position of Clan Head because there was truly no one else left...

Li Xinghan also knew clearly that Li Zhouluo, representing the Fourth branch, was the sole heir, and his maternal clan influence here was weak. With Li Chenghuai in seclusion, one could even say Li Zhouluo *was* the Fourth branch. He lacked the natural support of elders and core pillars that the First and Second branches possessed when they held power. He was inherently at a disadvantage.

Seeing him in such a difficult position, she could only listen quietly. Li Zhouluo finished his tirade, paused, and asked, "How is Fifth Brother now?"

At the mention of Li Zhouming, a hint of a smile touched Li Xinghans lips. "I just came from his place. Didn't you give him that White Falcon Gold? He came down from Mount Qingdu and didn't even change his clothes, just rushed back to forge hairpins. Who knows which songstress he's trying to please this time..."

Their opinion of Li Zhouming had clearly changed. Normally, such words would carry a tone of helpless exasperation, but now they held more amusement. Li Zhouluo shook his head. "Elder Chen will meticulously note this down against him again. Ive only just realized that hes the one who truly sees things clearly. Anyone else in the clan gets a demerit recorded at Qingdu and they look like theyre attending a funeral. Only himhe gets noted down, gets punished, and makes the exact same mistake next time."

They both chuckled. Li Xinghan replied, "I need to set off again soon to enter the mountains and train my sword. But before I leave, I'll see Uncle Cheng and have a good talk with him."

Li Zhouluo nodded repeatedly. "Cheng" was Li Xinghan's direct uncle; her words carried immense weight. He said quickly, "Thank you, sister!"

Li Xinghan cradled her sword and departed briskly. Li Zhouluo busied himself in the hall. Only half a quarter-hour passed before Chen Yang entered unexpectedly. The man bowed and said respectfully, "Clan Head, wonderful news! Wang Quwan has successfully broken through and forged the Floating Cloud Body!"

Li Zhouluo's eyes lit up. He strode quickly out of the hall and looked up. Sure enough, floating clouds obscured the sun in the north. He asked, "Excellent! The Essence Gathering Pill the Daoist Master gave him was not wasted. He truly did not disappoint. Where is he?"

Chen Yang replied, "Judging by the celestial phenomenon, he has just broken through. He is almost certainly on his way to pay respects! His seclusion spot isn't far from here. The floating cloud has been rising for some time. I reckon he'll arrive at any moment."

"Good!"

Wang Quwan was not just anyone. For one, the man represented the clans of Jiangbei. The Wang Clan had mobilized their entire clan to help the Li family defend Jiangbei. Furthermore, he had been personally promoted by Li Ximing. His significance was extraordinary.

Moreover, Wang Quwan's sword Dao cultivation was not weak, and he had long held a reputation. That Floating Cloud Body was no simple lineage; it represented an immortal foundation of the Body Divine Ability, and it was highly compatible with artifact refinement. This man's future was truly bright.

Li Zhouluo hurried back to the main seat, pulled out a jade slip from the side, glanced at it, and said, "I hear he is also a sword cultivator. It is only right to reward him with a Dharma sword. Protector Chen, what artifact does he currently use?"

Chen Yang replied, "I am told it is a common, low-grade Qi Refining item."

Li Zhouluo nodded immediately. "A Foundation Establishment artifact cannot be bestowed lightly, but a peak-grade Qi Refining Dharma sword possesses both value and significance... Let me check the treasury... There is still one peak-grade Qi Refining Dharma sword, obtained during the North-South conflict. Quickly, bring it for inspection."

Wang Quwan would certainly come to pay respects immediately. Dili Guang understood time was tight and hurried off. Chen Yang said, "Clan Head, I will go outside the island to greet him!"

Li Zhouluo watched him go, feeling a quiet sense of relief. He waited only a moment before a man stepped forward to pay respects. This man had average features, trod upon clouds, and carried a sword on his back. His gaze was resolute, his steps steady. He bowed. "Wang Quwan of Jiangbei greets the Clan Head!"

The man was unremarkable in appearance, yet held quite the reputation. Li Zhouluo smiled and helped him up. "Congratulations, Quwan! It is truly not easy for Jiangbei to produce a sword cultivator such as you."

Dili Guang returned at the perfect moment, holding a jade box. Li Zhouluo took it with one hand and opened it. Inside lay a longsword. The blade shimmered with intersecting gold and blue light, emanating a pure aura. One glance confirmed it was of the highest grade.

Li Zhouluo smiled. "This sword is three chi, one cun, and two fen long. It weighs fifty-two jin and one liang. Its base is Jinghai Cold Iron, forged with Golden Essence from the bottom of the Great River. Its color resembles the waters of Jinghai, and its patterns depict the Golden Beast of the Clear River. Its name is..."

This sword had been seized as spoils. Although the materials were discernible, no name was engraved on the blade. Li Zhouluo paused slightly, then bestowed a name ripe with meaning.

"Jingxi Qing!"

Wang Quwan was a sword cultivator; no sword cultivator dislikes Dharma swords. The "Jingxi Qing," as a peak-grade Qi Refining weapon, was even higher quality than Li Xinghan's previous Northern Jade. Although Wang Quwan was now the head of the Jiangbei clans, he had relied on his Wang surname and his own two hands to fight for his position; he did not come from a prominent background. He immediately bowed. "Clan Head! This is too precious!"

Li Zhouluo shook his head. "Your family exerted great effort defending Jiangbei. This is a reward you deserve. From now on, it also represents the status of your Jiangbei Wang Clan at Baijiang Creek. How can we speak of its value? If we must speak of value, this sword is worth less than that Essence Gathering Pill."

Since Li Zhouluo insisted, Wang Quwan could only accept the jade box with both hands. His gaze toward the Dharma sword was filled with an undisguisable affection. He clutched it to his chest as if it were a priceless treasure, thanking him repeatedly.

Li Zhouluo knew this man's reputation; he was definitely reliable and capable. That he had emerged from seclusion and immediately received a sword personally bestowed by Li Zhouluo was deeply significant. This solved an urgent problem for Li Zhouluo. He wasn't in a rush to put the man to work, simply asking smilingly about matters in Jiangbei.

After inquiring for a time, Li Zhouluo learned that Wang Quwan's elder brotherthat Alchemist of the Wang Clanhad gone missing on an outing years ago and hadn't been heard from since. The one managing the family at home was his younger brother, Wang Quyu. Li Zhouluo had heard of this man; he too was talented, and though his aptitude was inferior to Wang Quwan's, his methods were formidable.

He studied Wang Quwan's expression and asked, "How... is your sword Dao cultivation? With your sword qi already formed, sword essence should not be far off, yes?"

This was, naturally, flattery. Sword essence was exceptionally difficult to achieve. As expected, Wang Quwan shook his head. "Sword essence is nowhere in sight; I hit a bottleneck long ago. I am merely hoping to borrow and read the sword Dao scriptures from around the lake, hoping they resonate with the sword Dao of Jiangbei, and see if I can walk my own path."

According to custom, Wang Quwan still needed to pay respects to Li Xuanxuan, Ding Weizeng, and the others. Li Zhouluo let him go, his mood greatly improved. He ordered the small windows on both sides of the main hall opened. The hall brightened instantly, morning light spilling inside, illuminating the tabletop in brilliant light.

The dawn light climbed the jade racks, flowed over the glistening scales of the Coiling Dragon Pillar near the table, and reflected onto the main seat. It passed over Li Zhouluo, casting faint, shimmering scale patterns across the far wall.

***

After Kong Guxi left the hall, he returned to the island, lost and desolate. His elder brother, Kong Guli, was waiting below, looking preoccupied. When he saw Kong Guxi's expression, the old man already anticipated the answer and covered his face in silence.

Kong Guxi didn't say an extra word. He took a few steps, only to see Fu Yuezi approach and bow respectfully. "Gate Master."

Hearing this title, Kong Guxi felt a hundred conflicting flavors well up in his heart. He was about to speak when he noticed a vast swathe of floating clouds surging on the northern horizon. They were white and misty, reaching straight to the heavens, blotting out the sun.

"Someone else has reached Foundation Establishment."

He shrank into himself, forgetting even to close the courtyard gate, simply watching Kong Guli and Fu Yuezi pack their things... In truth, there was nothing to pack. They were merely waiting for the Li family to escort them. To avoid looking like they were just sitting and waiting for their fate, the old men kept themselves busy with pointless tasks.

After about fifteen minutes, the sound of urgent footsteps and horse hoofs suddenly echoed from the streets and alleys, followed by the sharp, crackling explosion of firecrackers. Several people were shouting in the alleys:

"Great joyous news! Great news! Lord Wang Quwan of the Jiangbei Wang Clan has forged an immortal foundation! Great news... great news! Come and share in the good fortune, collect your rewards and gifts... Come, come..."

One auspicious shout followed another. The two Profound Peak disciples guarding the gate also received immortal rewards and joined the congratulations, starting to laugh. For them, joining the Sacred Writ Gate and ending their lives of wandering and dependency was naturally a good thing. They hadn't thought too deeply about it. Now, they too were cheerful, and the courtyard was filled with thunderous, joyous laughter.

The laughter rang out for a long time before a clear voice finally intervened. "Everyone disperse. The honored guests are resting inside. It is not good to be so rowdy."

It was Cui Jueyin's voice. He always spoke gently, and he understood that Kong Guxi inside was not feeling well. A trace of pity moved him to disperse the crowd. The people finally scattered.

The sounds of joy and laughter faded as they spread out in all directions. Cui Jueyin raised his eyebrows slightly, catching the sound of heavy, suppressed crying from the courtyard. He could faintly make out choked sobs:

"Gate Master... Gate Master!"

"Fu Yuezi... go join the Li family... Go and join the Li family! In any case... in the end, following me to the east will just be more suffering..."

"Gate Master! What are you saying..."

"Brother... rising and falling, such is the way of the world. Outside, the gongs and drums celebrate; inside, we grieve our end. A twenty-year-old minor branch is just beginning its rise; a three-hundred-year-old immortal clan is reaching its demise. Our luck has run out! Our fate has reached its end... Let us go to the east!"
