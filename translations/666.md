# Chapter 666: The Nature of Demons (Part 1)

*Crack.*

The snows of the North Sea never melted. Amidst an endless expanse of white, gale-force winds scoured the mountain peak where an old man sat in silent stillness. A fishing rod of pure white jade extended from his hands into the vast sea of snow, its crystalline line pulled taut, disappearing into the boundless ice sea far below.

Xiao Chuting had remained here, motionless, for decades. Wind and snow swirled past him, yet not a single flake ever touched his robes. His hands, holding the rod, were as steady as if they had been cast from iron.

A series of soft sounds cut through the howling wind as a figure descended, riding the currents of air. Two medicine pouches swayed at his waist, and his hair was threaded with white. It was Xiao Yuansi, his voice warm and sincere as he spoke.

"Greetings, Perfected Master."

"Ah, Yuansi, you've come," Xiao Chuting acknowledged, his voice deep. His hands remained perfectly still as he asked casually, "Did you deliver the medicinal pill to the Li family?"

Xiao Yuansi had long understood that none of his actions or thoughts could ever be hidden from this ancestor. He bowed respectfully. "I did, Perfected Master. In my sentiment for my former disciple, I acted without first reporting to you. Please, forgive my transgression."

"Good."

Xiao Chuting’s expression remained placid. "You've always thought me heartless," he said gently, "but you handled this poorly. Sometimes, ruthlessness is the only way to save someone. In this, you see things less clearly than Tu Longjian."

"Junior..."

Xiao Yuansi started to speak but fell silent. Xiao Chuting gave him no chance to continue.

"I've known for a long time that the Li family possesses a Purple Mansion cultivation method," the old man said softly. "When the Eastern Fire Grotto-Heaven fell, the secret records of the Dongli Sect fell into the hands of the Three Sects and Seven Gates. Their secrets were laid bare for all to see. Although the Grotto-Heaven itself contained little of true value, its legacy was rooted in the Wei-Li lineage, and the details alone were deadly."

"When Li Ximing achieved Foundation Establishment, the celestial phenomena were unusual. Si Boxiu paid a visit. By cross-referencing the Dongli Sect's records, he not only determined the grade of the technique but even identified which Purple Mansion method it was!"

Xiao Yuansi remained silent as the old man continued, "It is the fourth-grade *Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art*. It requires a specific spiritual qi—the Golden Sun Radiant Origin Qi. That is why the Li family holds onto that old city wall beyond West Screen Mountain so fiercely. They are simply harvesting qi."

"Of course, Si Boxiu doesn't care whether the Li family's method is complete or not. A Purple Mansion cultivator in the Li family would be a welcome development, but their absence is hardly a loss... None of that is the real issue. It’s of little consequence if they have the method. How many who follow such a wild path ever truly succeed? Even if one did, they would be another Changxi at best. The problem... is Li Zhouwei."

Xiao Chuting sighed. "He is a Purple Mansion Seed, and that is no mere pleasantry. His bloodline is extraordinary, surpassing even Chi Buzi's. He is no Changxi! Do you have any idea how many eyes are on him!"

"And as for the Radiant Sky Stone, few in Jiangnan want to see it used on Li Zhouwei. While they may not act openly against him, none of them wish him well."

The old man’s voice dropped lower. "Tu Longjian, for all his cunning, is not old enough. He could never outwit Tianwan. The moment he made that wager with her, countless people would have conspired to harm Li Xijun. Even if he had won the Radiant Sky Stone, with Li Xijun dead, it would have been as useless as not having it at all! That's why Tianwan dared to let those two rogue cultivators act. She knew someone would help them from the shadows..."

Xiao Yuansi let out a deep sigh. "This junior... I do not understand."

Xiao Chuting said, "Look at the situation now and you will. Li Qinghong has gone to the Eastern Sea, and Li Xijun is dead. Who can restrain Li Ximing now? He is a man driven by the pursuit of immortality. Do you truly believe he won't use the Radiant Sky Stone to attempt a breakthrough himself? Who could resist such a temptation? How could it possibly be saved for Li Zhouwei?"

"My goal, and Changxi's, was to apply pressure on Li Ximing. He understood this himself. But with the pill you delivered, he can no longer sit still! His attempt at a breakthrough is a path to certain death, and it will exhaust the family's resources..."

Xiao Yuansi bowed his head, saying nothing. He too understood the overwhelming allure of the Purple Mansion realm. Li Ximing's final words to him had almost certainly been a pretense.

The old man before him sighed again. "Right now, the other Purple Mansion masters are likely hoping Li Ximing attempts his breakthrough. One more or less makes little difference to them, and he is almost guaranteed to fail. He has no concept of the true dangers involved. He sees the cultivators of the Three Sects and Seven Gates succeed and assumes the odds are as simple as they appear."

"I deliberately created obstacles for you, hoping to delay the pill's refinement until after Li Ximing went into seclusion. My intent was for it to be delivered to Li Zhouwei. But you... you pushed yourself to the point of injury just to get it there in time..."

The old man gave him a long, deep look and sighed. "So be it. Let your bond as master and disciple be fulfilled."

For a full quarter of an hour, Xiao Yuansi stood frozen, unable to utter a single word.

"You may leave..."

Xiao Yuansi departed, his spirit crushed. Xiao Chuting remained, his fishing rod held high. Only when his junior's presence had faded completely did the raging snowstorm around him begin to calm. In that instant, the look of disappointment vanished from his face, replaced by a deep, calculating calm.

'Yuansi is sincere and kind, and he's one of our own,' he thought. 'How could the other Purple Mansion masters possibly suspect him? Their attention will only be drawn to probing Li Zhouwei.'

He gave the long rod a slight lift, yet it seemed to weigh more than a mountain. The entire snow-covered peak trembled, and in the next moment, sheets of snow began to slide, gathering momentum into a thunderous avalanche. Far below, from the depths of the ice sea, a single point of light began its slow ascent.

***

*Mount Dali*

The peaks of Mount Dali were cloaked in white. Under the moonlight, the forest was a sea of silver trees. Li Zhouwei gazed into the distance at the undulating mountain range. A few plumes of black smoke rose against the snow, where small groups of patrolling demons stamped their feet and laughed around crackling bonfires.

Mount Dali was situated in the far north of Jiangnan. It snowed every year, but never for long, and the locals treated it as a beautiful, fleeting sight. The old White Ape standing beside Li Zhouwei looked out and spoke, his voice ancient.

"Your Highness... it's been a hundred years since a human was eaten on Mount Dali. The yao here have grown simple. They have forgotten the taste."

"That is a credit to our ancestors," Li Zhouwei replied with a nod.

They descended onto a snowy peak, the snow crunching softly underfoot. A group of demons was gathered around a fire pit before the entrance to a deer demon's cave, warming themselves.

Their arrival startled the group, but instead of fleeing, a demon with the face of a deer and enormous ears stepped forward. Its cultivation was only at the fourth layer of Embryonic Breathing, yet it could already speak human words.

"Hey, you there!" it called out with a strange accent. "Are you here to gather herbs? Come, warm yourself by the fire..."

Before it could finish, the tiger demon leading the patrol nearly jumped out of its skin in terror. It grabbed the deer demon, forcing it to its knees, and cried out in a panicked voice, "This lowly one greets the two great lords!"

The tiger demon was a Qi Refining leader and had already developed its spiritual sense. It recognized the two newcomers as Foundation Establishment cultivators. A single glance from the White Ape had nearly scared the life out of it, and it prostrated itself on the ground.

"Go and announce us," the old ape said, his voice deep and resonant. "The Li family has come to visit the Cave Master."

Li Zhouwei paid the commotion little mind. As he waited before the cave, the deer demon's words echoed in his thoughts. 'It's been a hundred years. My family has come and gone from Mount Dali, trading spirit rice for spiritual items, gathering herbs, and extracting essences. The demons here haven't preyed on humans for a long time; they've become naive and trusting. Our cultivators, needing their help, have often treated them with courtesy, leading to such harmony.'

"Your Majesty speaks the truth!"

Just as the thought crossed his mind, a howling spiritual wind gusted from the cave. A middle-aged man wrapped in a robe emerged, his dark hair unbound and his eyes a deep brown. A large shield was strapped to his back. "This lowly one greets the Great King!" he boomed.

He bowed deeply. Li Zhouwei frowned and moved to help him up. Lu Ken had always addressed his elders as a 'Fellow Daoist,' and such a deep bow disrupted the established seniority between them. "Senior, what is the meaning of this?" he asked, surprised.

Lu Ken rose, a wide smile on his face. "We can discuss that later. When we see the White Qilin, we must first pay our proper respects. Hence, the bow."

Though his face was all smiles, the reverence in his eyes was unmistakable. It was clear he shared the same sentiment as the Dragon Prince, Dingjiao, and saw him not as a man, but as the White Qilin.

The deer demon wasted no more words, leading him into the cave. The interior was vast, its stone walls as smooth and white as jade, with clear, elegant veins running through them. Lesser Demons bowed along the sides, and the ground was covered with cushions made from the pelts of beasts—mostly wolves and tigers.

'A deer demon as the cave master,' Li Zhouwei mused. 'The wolves and tigers of the northern yue must be on the verge of extinction...'

After they were seated in the place of honor, Lu Ken’s brown eyes glanced at the White Ape, and he immediately began to apologize. "I've been visiting a friend in the Helin Mountains for the past few years... we traveled together to the Southern Borderlands. The journey back and forth took years. I only just returned to the mountain. My apologies for the delay."

Li Zhouwei didn't believe a word of his excuses but acknowledged them politely before getting straight to the point. "My family has sent a number of letters recently, which I'm sure you have seen. We wish to meet with Senior Bai Rong. Do you have any news from the Demon Cave? We would ask you to contact him for us."

"It's already been arranged!" Lu Ken laughed, clasping his fist. "Fellow Daoist, rest assured. The moment I returned, I reported to the Demon Cave and received a message. They were merely waiting for your arrival. I will send for him at once."

He lowered his voice. "Over the past few years, my master has gained the great favor of a Great Demon, and his status in the cave has risen. After accumulating his foundation for so long, his innate talent blossomed after he reached Foundation Establishment, and he has won the allegiance of many Demon Generals. He is a great lord now!"

It was clear that Bai Rong's rise in status had brought Lu Ken considerable benefits. His face beamed with pride and joy as he ordered the other demons to prepare a grand banquet, while sending another to the Demon Cave to summon Bai Rong.

The White Ape observed the preparations and commented softly, "Cave Master, this is quite a magnificent feast. A great deal of meat."

Although Lu Ken didn't recognize the White Ape, he quickly surmised the old ape's considerable age. "Fellow Daoist, may I ask your age?"

"Four hundred and sixty-some years..."

The answer clearly surprised Lu Ken. "Impressive," he said with admiration. "To answer your question, although we are deer demons, a meal with meat is always better than one with plants. Even mortal deer... have a habit of eating birds, snakes, and insects..."

"It is all instinct," he continued, then hesitated. "Besides..."

Lu Ken couldn't bring himself to say, 'most demons also eat humans,' but Li Zhouwei understood the unspoken sentiment. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, silently acknowledging that in Lu Ken's eyes, he too was one of the demons. Otherwise, the deer demon would not have caught his words at the last second.

"Lu Ken!"

Just as the White Ape and Lu Ken were chatting, a loud call came from outside the cave. A streak of purple fire shot through the air and solidified within the cavern, revealing a youth dressed in a wide-sleeved, blue-green robe. A string of brilliant silver beads hung around his neck. His features were sharp and narrow.

"I'm here!" he announced.

Lu Ken hurried to bow. The youth strode forward, his smile fading slightly as he studied Li Zhouwei with a hint of confusion. "You're the White Qilin... right. I heard Li Xijun died, too..."

"Li Xijun was my grand-uncle."

"Oh!"

With that, Bai Rong seemed to sort out the generations. "Ah... I go into seclusion for a bit, and in the blink of an eye, decades pass. Your family’s cultivators just keep changing... It's said that humans have short lifespans, but from what I've seen, disaster at the hands of others is a far greater threat than the limits of nature."

"Your family truly are the descendants of the Bright Yang. The lords in the demon cave have spoken of you, called you a White Qilin. Looking at you now, I see they were right."

Bai Rong warmed up quickly, his manner becoming relaxed and open. He glanced at the deer demons below, who were all staring up at the food with eager eyes, and said with some exasperation, "You've really picked up bad habits from those humans. Must you put on such a show just for me? They're already dying to start eating. Hurry up and send them out so they can have their fill."

Lu Ken bowed respectfully and, understanding his master's meaning, quickly dismissed the lesser demons, herding and kicking them out of the main hall. He then thoughtfully sealed the heavy stone door and stood guard outside.

Once the door boomed shut and the cave's defensive array began to hum, Bai Rong smiled. "There aren't many people left in your Li family that I know. I remember a little old fellow... from Tongya's nephew's generation. Last time I visited the lake, he was the only one I could really talk to. Is he still around? If he's gone, I can't be bothered to visit anymore."

"The elder's health is still robust."

Li Zhouwei knew he was referring to Li Xuanxuan. So many years after Li Tongya's death, the bond between their two families had naturally weakened. That Bai Rong still remembered was a testament to their former friendship.

Bai Rong didn't delay. He asked about the purpose of the visit, and Li Zhouwei stated it plainly.

"This junior had been cultivating in the Eastern Sea. I have come at the request of the Dragon Prince, Dingjiao, to seek your assistance on behalf of the Dragon Kind in the matter of Listening to the Abyss."

Bai Rong chuckled. "I know... The dragons put some thought into having you act as their messenger."

His expression turned serious. "My ancestral grandmother and Dongfang You were never on good terms. They weren't enemies, but they certainly didn't get along! If Dongfang You weren't already dead, and if my master wasn't on good terms with the dragons... Hmph, that Dingjiao fellow would never have dared to ask."

Li Zhouwei remained silent, listening.

"He may not have told you everything," Bai Rong continued in a low voice, "but I can guess. He wants to go to the Southern Sea."

"As foxes, we are forbidden from entering the sea. But since the Dragon Prince has asked... this matter is not too difficult. I don't mind making a trip on my master's behalf."

Li Zhouwei felt a wave of relief. He didn't covet the spiritual tool Dingjiao had offered; in fact, he had no intention of accepting it. Forging a good relationship with the Dragon Kind was far more important.

As Li Zhouwei considered this, Bai Rong let out a laugh. "Then it's settled. White Qilin, you will accompany me to the Southern Sea."

"Hm?"

In this affair between the dragons and the foxes, Li Zhouwei had always seen himself as a neutral messenger. He had been careful not to favor either side, but now the winding path of this matter had led directly back to him.

"This junior's cultivation is shallow, and I know nothing of these ancient affairs. I fear I will only slow you down, Senior."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, but Bai Rong was just smiling at him. In his human form, the youth still possessed a foxy aura, and his voice was tinged with a subtle sharpness.

"White Qilin, Dingjiao wants more than just to Listen to the Abyss. He wants to befriend both of us. If you don't go... the whole thing falls through."

"Besides," he added, his expression growing solemn. "With Li Qinghong gone, you won't be safe on the lake for long. You'll have a much easier time with me and Dingjiao... At our side, at least no one will dare to get any ideas."
