# Chapter 719: Establishing the Baijiang Command

Ding Weizeng stood waiting outside the main hall when Qu Bushi ambled up. Despite a minor injury, the old man was practically glowing with satisfaction, every wrinkle on his face creased into a smile. He hummed a little tune as he approached, first offering congratulations before taking Ding Weizeng’s hand and whispering, “I’ve finished organizing the land deeds for the Floating Cloud territory. I’m about to present them to the family head. Has the Ding Clan made arrangements? Are you returning to your ancestral lands… or have you chosen a new place to settle?”

Ding Weizeng understood the old man’s intentions. Having just surveyed the spirit fields, Qu Bushi would know exactly which plots were fertile and which were barren. This was his way of offering an inside tip. Yet Ding Weizeng remained perfectly composed. “Senior Qu,” he said steadily, “my family will be moving to the lake to continue our cultivation on the isles.”

“Oh! Congratulations are in order, then!” Qu Bushi exclaimed.

Realizing that even a valued general like Ding was being relocated, he understood that the family’s control over the Floating Cloud territory would be strict, leaving no room for maneuvering. He let go of any notion of settling his own people there, gathered his robes, and headed inside, muttering to himself, ‘When did Ding Weizeng become so humble? Back in Floating Cloud Cave, he wouldn’t hesitate to scowl at Fu Dou’s own son. Now he’s as proper as that An Siwei…’

Qu Bushi actually had a decent impression of An Siwei. The young man was a typical cultivator from the mainland, one who had scraped his way past the Foundation Establishment threshold through sheer luck, potent elixirs, and a dense spiritual environment. In the seas, his standing would likely be even lower than Qu Bushi’s.

‘At least he comes from a good family,’ Qu Bushi mused. ‘His father was incompetent but had the good sense to pledge allegiance to the nascent dragon, becoming a loyal vassal for generations. Even Ding Weizeng has to treat him with courtesy.’

His thoughts wandering, Qu Bushi looked up. At the head of the hall, a young man in golden-white armor was writing something with his head lowered. To his left stood another young man of about the same age, clad in silver armor and a black robe, his eyes dark as lacquer, arms crossed. To the right, a resplendent woman in palace attire pondered thoughtfully, her hand shielding a brilliant treasure lamp.

These were three of the four most powerful figures in the Li family. He had heard there was another overseeing matters on the lake, but he had yet to meet them. Qu Bushi clasped his hands respectfully. “I have completed my survey of the Floating Cloud land deeds and have come to report to the family head!”

“Proceed,” Li Zhouwei replied without looking up.

“In the Floating Cloud region,” Qu Bushi began respectfully, “there are a total of two thousand and fifty-one spirit fields. Of these, two hundred and eleven are of the highest grade, five hundred and sixty-one are of middle grade, and one thousand two hundred and seventy-nine are of the lowest grade.”

Moongaze Lake was said to have ten thousand spirit fields, but most were controlled by the various peaks, and the majority were barren plots whose yields barely covered the cost of their upkeep, so they were left fallow. Since every field had a different spiritual density, discussing area was meaningless. Li Zhouwei cut to the chase. “Elder Qu, your Immortal Foundation is the Palace of Concealed Storage, and you are well-versed in agriculture. What is your estimate of the total output?”

“I have calculated each one,” Qu Bushi said deferentially. “The yield should be around ten thousand catties. If we install a full array of formations and properly regulate the water channels, it could exceed twenty thousand.”

“Truly a rich land.”

The Li family’s control was strongest along the southern and eastern shores of Moongaze Lake. The towns below the main peaks, excluding labor costs, contributed all their output to the clan, amounting to a yield of roughly fifty thousand. Pingya Island was primarily for cultivation and could be disregarded. The various families left behind by Daoist Master He on the western shore and the Fei family on the northern shore each contributed over ten thousand, and the hundred families of the eastern shore added another ten thousand. All told, the total output approached one hundred thousand.

This hundred-thousand-catty figure, however, was just for calculation. Now that the Li family no longer paid tribute to the Azure Pond Sect, they didn’t plant spirit grain exclusively. Vast tracts of land were used to cultivate more precious resources for Qi Refinement cultivators, like Pinewood Fruits and Lacquer Ridge Grass. The actual yield from land dedicated to spirit grain was only around thirty thousand.

This meant that Floating Cloud Cave, which constituted half of the Baijiang Creek region, already produced a fifth of Moongaze Lake's total output. It was an astonishing figure.

“No wonder so many sects and families have settled north of the river,” Li Minggong remarked. “Only lands this fertile could support such a dense population.”

Li Zhouwei did a quick mental calculation. ‘Our ten thousand spirit fields yield a hundred thousand catties, which translates to nearly a thousand spirit stones in annual income. But our clan has grown massive. First, the number of cultivators we support is staggering. Second, the stipends for our Foundation Establishment cultivators are extremely generous. And third… we have yet to establish our own market.’

‘Although life in the clan has become comfortable,’ he thought, ‘after deducting costs and salaries, the annual surplus is quite small—only ten to twenty percent of our income… less than a hundred spirit stones.’

A surplus of a hundred spirit stones a year might not sound like much, but it was actually an immense sum. It meant that every month, the clan generated enough wealth to cover the entire life savings of a Qi Refinement cultivator. Every year, they could build a top-tier Qi Refinement formation. In three to five years, they could construct a full Foundation Establishment-level grand array.

The only awkward part was that without their own market, most of their surplus was stored as spirit grain and other resources. These often spoiled from improper storage. The supply of spirit stones in the Jiangnan region was limited; if they tried to convert all their surplus, they would only succeed in driving up the price of spirit stones.

‘Besides, items at the level of treasure panaceas are rarely traded for spirit stones. It’s also nearly impossible to buy all the materials for a Foundation Establishment grand array with spirit stones alone.’

Li Zhouwei hesitated for a moment. While a ten-thousand-catty yield was worth a hundred spirit stones, spirit resources were often harvested annually. It would be a shame to lose these lands before the crops matured.

“For now, have Siwei arrange for spirit grain to be planted. There’s no rush to build top-tier formations, either. It would be a waste if we have to leave in a hurry.”

Qu Bushi nodded and withdrew. Li Zhouwei was now left with the headache of storing this massive amount of spirit grain. He sighed inwardly. Li Minggong, sensing his concern, spoke up. “Now I understand why the Xiao and Yuan families designated large swathes of spirit land and spent a fortune to cultivate just one or two valuable spirit plants. But we’ll only be occupying these places for a short time… so that approach isn’t suitable for us.”

“Indeed,” Li Zhouwei said gravely. “For now, we’ll convert some of the larger spirit fields at home to grow White Origin Fruit. We’ll have to dip into our reserves for the time being…”

Fortunately, this headache was limited to the ruins of the Floating Cloud territory. In the Dense Cloud territory, they simply needed to levy taxes on the established families—a much simpler and faster process. After discussing the matters in detail, Li Zhouwei asked Li Minggong to return and guard their home base, finally concluding the affairs of Baijiang Creek.

At last, he had a moment of peace. He gestured for Li Chenghui, who had been standing by his side, to sit. “Uncle, what are your thoughts on the cultivators from White Ye?”

Li Cheng paused, his brow furrowed. “They won’t be easy to deal with. I’ve already made inquiries. The one in the colorful robes is a direct descendant of the White Ye sect named Guan Lingdie. Her Immortal Foundation is the same as the Lingu family’s, Sorrowful Southern Water.”

“As for the saber-wielder, Gongsun Bofan, he was originally a rogue cultivator from north of the river. He cultivates the Pit Water, the Way of the Jing Dragon King, and has since joined the White Ye Immortal Sect. His saber techniques are formidable. The last one, the young lady from the Song family, is the daughter of a prominent northern clan.”

This intelligence matched Li Zhouwei’s own assessment. He thought for a moment. “Guan Lingdie’s words were sharp, but her combat experience is not to be underestimated. Gongsun Bofan’s Dao lineage is profound, not at all like a common rogue cultivator. As for Song Yunbai, her presence suggests that the White Ye Immortal Sect’s control over its territories isn’t particularly strict.”

Guan Lingdie was, after all, a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion clan. She had managed to hold off both Li Chenghui and An Siwei, even managing to injure the latter on her own. Her strength was not to be taken lightly. Li Zhouwei committed their names to memory. “And as for the Profound Peak Gate… they truly have no one. It’s a sign of their decline.”

He had a point. Kong Guxi, the esteemed sect master of the Profound Peak Gate, had been locked in an even fight with the daughter of a minor northern clan. If not for the Profound Peak’s numerical advantage and the White Ye’s early retreat, the casualties might have been far worse.

This situation was a direct result of Daoist Master Changxi’s repeated demands for his descendants to strive for the Purple Mansion realm. When the opportunity of the Upper Evil Spirit Storage arose, Changxi had been overjoyed, and several of his core descendants had entered seclusion, leading to the current state of affairs.

It was for this very reason that Kong Tingyun later ascended to the position of Sect Master, gradually earning Changxi’s favor and bringing the Profound Peak Gate and the Li family closer. It was, Li Zhouwei mused, a true testament to the workings of fate.

“The Profound Peak Gate still has Fuyuezi on Yuezhou Island,” Li Chenghui offered as a comfort. “His strength is considerable. He can contribute when the time comes.”

Li Zhouwei remained silent. After a moment, Chen Yang came up from below to report that the various families of the Dense Cloud territory had sent their representatives. The initial arrangements were settled, and the territory was, at least for now, under their control.

“With Dense Cloud secured… it is time we returned to the mountain. I must see the Daoist Master.” Li Zhouwei put down his brush.

“There’s still the Northern Brocade River King waiting in Baijiang Creek,” Li Cheng reminded him.

“Of course…” Li Zhouwei, who had been pondering who to station as a guard in the Dense Cloud territory, nodded. “I intend to establish a command post for the Baijiang Creek region to govern Floating Cloud and guard Dense Cloud. An Siwei is capable enough to manage the administration of Floating Cloud, but he lacks the strength to defend it. I’m afraid I must ask you, Uncle, to assume this post and oversee things here.”

Li Chenghui had fought alongside Li Zhouwei through more than a decade of peril; they knew each other too well for pleasantries. He simply nodded. “I will do my best to protect this place.”

Li Zhouwei considered for a breath before continuing. “Since the Secret Diffusion Sects have been broken and Hongfu Mountain has been conquered, it is time for a new order in the Floating Cloud and Dense Cloud territories. With Manghuazi Mountain as the border, the southern part of Floating Cloud will be renamed Funan, and Dense Cloud will be renamed Midong. We will establish the Baijiang Command, headquartered on Hongfu Mountain. The official positions and decrees… the clan will send them shortly.”

He let out a small laugh. “If we can hold these two territories and Funan begins to generate an income, the salaries for the command post can be drawn directly from the rear. It will be far more convenient.”

It was still a form of puppet rule, but Li Zhouwei was determined to secure the legitimacy of their claim. He wouldn’t call it a Gate or a Cave, but a Command, an entity that could be dissolved at any time. They had already burned their bridges with the White Ye Immortal Sect, and no one in the Midong territory expected the Li family to last long anyway. They were all just living day by day, so there was no need to worry about winning their loyalty.

“As for the Northern Brocade River King…” Li Zhouwei had already thought this through. “He knows a great deal. In his eyes, I am a figure on par with Dragon Prince Dingjiao. It would be utterly inappropriate for me to visit his estate. My presence would only make him suspicious and cause him to overthink things. But we cannot let such a valuable asset go to waste. You should go in my stead. He will not dare to be disrespectful.”

Li Chenghui nodded.

“He’s not some esteemed guest of the Dragon Palace as the rumors claim; he’s a minor figure there,” Li Zhouwei continued. “You only need to be clear on one point: the dragons are not to get involved in our affairs. He can gather information and help with the waterways, which is useful enough.”

“Qu Bushi, Ding Weizeng, and Miaoshui will all remain here with you. You cannot manage this all on your own. If you need anything, do not hesitate to ask the family. Aunt Minggong is just across the river on the northern shore, a short trip from Funan, and can provide timely support. As for Wenhu…”

A smile touched Li Zhouwei’s lips. “I will take him to Gardenia Scenery Mountain. Let the other families see… that our Daoist Master is not so easily trifled with.”

Wenhu, despite his cunning, had been incredibly unlucky. In addition to the man, Li Zhouwei planned to take the flower python back as well. He had been at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment for years; using a talisman ritual to break through to the late stage now would not seem abrupt.

However, with the Li family’s recent ascension to a Purple Mansion clan, they were no longer a minor family under the thumb of the Azure Pond Sect. Any major event was likely to attract the attention of other Purple Mansion cultivators, making the ritual a tricky affair.

Rituals conducted at the foot of their mountain could be disguised as local Moongaze Lake customs, but a ritual on the mountain itself would involve secrets from the *Sacrificial Rites Manual*. If another Purple Mansion expert saw through their methods, it would be disastrous.

They should have consulted the Immortal Mirror, but ever since it had vanished into the Great Void, they hadn't been able to see its physical form even when invoking its power. They didn’t know what phenomena consulting it might produce. With the Li family in the spotlight, Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei dared not be careless and had postponed the matter.

‘It would be best to wait until a Purple Mansion-level array that can isolate the Great Void is established before performing the ritual,’ Li Zhouwei thought. ‘But even if we can’t perform the ritual right away, we can still bring the flower python back first…’

As his thoughts drifted, Li Chenghui walked with him to the riverbank. Li Zhouwei came back to himself with a sigh. “This will be difficult for you, Uncle. But remember, everything else is secondary. Your own safety is what matters most. We can afford to lose this land. If something were to happen to you, it would be a blow to the very foundation of our family.”

The Baijiang Command might look like the domain of a regional tyrant, but it was anything but a comfortable post. Daoist Master Changxi could pass away at any moment in the next few years. If the situation changed, the Baijiang territory would be the first to fall. When the cultivators of White Ye swarmed over, a moment’s hesitation could mean being completely surrounded.

Li Cheng knew this well. He steadied himself and replied, “I command the thunder. In our family, no one surpasses my escape arts. With Profound Thunder in the Thunder Pool and the protection of the grand array, if I am determined to flee, no Foundation Establishment cultivator can stop me.”

Li Chenghui saw the group off, then summoned a bolt of lightning and flew back, his mind already racing. He was a man of his own ideas. ‘I should make some preparations,’ he thought. ‘Since I can use the Dragon Prince’s reputation to my advantage, and Ying Hebai is the master of three rivers… think of how many water spirits he commands. Won’t they be like a network of eyes spreading through every waterway? If I make an agreement with him, a flare of light over the White Ye Immortal Sect’s domain could be reported by a demon here in an instant!’

Although a demon’s flying speed couldn’t compare to that of a Foundation Establishment expert, a warning could be sent with the simple crushing of a jade talisman.

With a plan in place, Li Chenghui felt more confident. He summoned Ding Weizeng and the others. After looking them over, he said, “Weizeng, come with me to the river.”

Ding Weizeng acknowledged the order. Below them, the dark, overgrown slopes of Manghuazi Mountain stretched out. The mountain’s grand array had long been dismantled, and the demons had scattered, leaving it empty. The two landed by the river, where they saw the figure of an old man in black robes materialize. He had clearly been waiting for them and hurried over, bowing deeply.

“Shui Zhao greets you, my lord.”

Li Chenghui nodded and announced, “Are you here at the invitation of the Northern Brocade River King?”

“Indeed!” The old demon Shui Zhao beamed, then squatted down and transformed. In his place was a black turtle the size of a house, its four limbs marked with brownish-yellow patterns, clearly a unique breed. Its neck was remarkably long, and its voice was a low hum like a great bronze bell.

“I have been awaiting your esteemed arrival for some time!”
