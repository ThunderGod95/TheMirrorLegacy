# Chapter 745: Pills and Formations

Though the night was deep, the Purple Smoke Blessed Land was a realm of perpetual light.

Wisps of purple qi coiled and ascended, creating an ethereal, immortal atmosphere. The qi ebbed and flowed like a tide, revealing and concealing a landscape of countless peaks in its thick, violet clouds. The glow of magical formations shot into the sky, bathing the entire domain in a brilliant radiance.

At the very center, pavilions and galleries floated upon the purple qi, a breathtaking sight. A Daoist Master in a white robe with gold trim descended on a beam of light, followed by a younger man with the air of a scholar. The purple qi parted before them, revealing a long, translucent staircase of purple jade.

The Purple Smoke Gate disciples they passed along the way bowed their heads in respect, whether they recognized the Daoist Master or not, only rising after he had passed. Li Ximing noted this with a silent nod of approval.

'The Purple Smoke Gate has a long and venerable history,' he thought. 'Their etiquette is quite strict.'

This visit was not solely about the Profound Peak Gate. The two families had much to discuss, and Li Ximing had never intended to come alone. However, the core members of his clan were either in seclusion or recovering from injuries, and the few who remained were busy managing critical affairs. After careful consideration, he had chosen to bring Cui Jueyin.

'Those other guest elders would be an embarrassment,' he mused. 'Ding Weizeng is qualified, but he's nursing a minor injury. Besides, he lacks polish and has never seen the wider world. Cui Jueyin, a direct descendant from Chongzhou, is the most suitable choice.'

A female cultivator descended on a cloud to greet them. She wore a pale yellow feathered robe, a brightly colored sash fluttering at her waist.

“Greetings, Daoist Master Zhaojing!”

The woman bowed. The Daoist Master in the white and gold robe returned the courtesy. “Is Daoist Master Tinglan present?” he asked.

Li Ximing had corresponded with the Purple Smoke Gate some time ago and only made the trip after confirming Tinglan had returned to the sect. His question was merely a formality. The woman in yellow replied, “My master returned to the Blessed Land half a year ago. She had planned to leave on the twenty-second, but after receiving your letter, she stayed a few extra days and sent me to wait for you here.”

She led the way, the purple qi swirling around them. Li Ximing turned his head slightly and spoke in a low voice to Cui Jueyin, who followed behind him. “This is the Purple Smoke Immortal Gate, of the Green Pine Supreme Yang Dao Lineage.”

The young man maintained a respectful posture, his eyes wide with wonder at the purple qi flowing through the mountains. He acknowledged the information with a soft sound of assent, a sense of ease settling over him.

Cui Jueyin was a stranger in these lands, but even in his year of relative seclusion, he had learned of the Three Sects and Seven Gates. For a Purple Mansion cultivator like Li Ximing to offer such an explanation showed that he was treating him as one of his own juniors. An ordinary Foundation Establishment subordinate would never have received such personal attention.

The three of them proceeded deeper, finally arriving at the palace complex floating on the purple qi. The spiritual energy here was even richer, and a special kind of energy seemed to flow up from the steps beneath their feet, dissipating like smoke.

Though only one of the Seven Gates, the Purple Smoke Gate’s foundation was deep. Their mountain sect, known as a Blessed Land, was a place of sublime beauty. Chongzhou Island was a fine place in its own right, but it paled in comparison. Cui Jueyin was filled with awe.

The Purple Qi Dao lineage was exceedingly rare overseas. While one might occasionally encounter a demonic cultivator of that path, an orthodox sect with such an immortal air was unheard of. Cui Jueyin’s gaze swept over the drifting purple mists, feeling their profound power.

The woman in yellow led them to the highest point, but here there was no palace. Instead, a smooth, translucent platform of purple jade stretched before them. The purple qi here had taken on a faint, luminous yellow hue, darting back and forth beneath their feet.

A laugh echoed through the air. “Greetings, Daoist Brother Zhaojing!”

Li Ximing looked up to see a woman standing on the platform. Unlike the usual purple attire of the sect’s members, she wore a magnificent autumn-yellow satin dress embroidered with butterfly patterns. Her features were delicate, her eyebrows thin. A touch of cyan at the corners of her eyes enhanced her beauty.

'So this is Daoist Master Tinglan,' Li Ximing thought. 'She seems to have a taste for finery.'

Only Li Ximing and Tinglan had the standing to openly appraise one another. Both the Purple Smoke cultivator and Cui Jueyin kept their eyes lowered, not daring to look directly at a Purple Mansion master. Whatever Tinglan thought of him, Li Ximing simply smiled in return. “You are too kind, Daoist Sister. I had heard your title was one of great beauty, and now that I see you in person, I find you are truly a celestial fairy.”

Daoist Master Tinglan laughed and thanked him for the compliment. “I am originally a cultivator from the northern land of Qi,” she explained. “My style of dress is a bit different from that of the Jiangnan region. I hope you do not find it strange.”

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. 'A cultivator from Qi? It seems she is not from the Kan family. Qi is the Gao family’s territory… Surely she isn’t a Gao, is she?'

While Li Ximing was still pondering this, Daoist Master Tinglan spoke again, her voice gentle. “My surname is Yi. I was once a loose cultivator and array master from Bolie Prefecture. I received the guidance of my master, Daoist Master Zipei, and achieved my Divine Ability here in the Blessed Land.”

Li Ximing nodded. Tinglan continued, “I have been traveling for many years and am not often in the sect. I only saw your letter upon my return. I apologize for making you wait, Daoist Brother.”

Li Ximing didn’t believe a word of it.

'When Changxi was alive, he visited the Purple Smoke Gate several times and never saw a soul. Even when my family sent inquiries, we received no response. Now that Changxi has fallen and we have proven our strength on the river, you suddenly appear, ready to divide up Shanji Prefecture. How convenient.'

For a loose cultivator to become a direct disciple of Zipei and break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, Tinglan was no simple character. Li Ximing didn’t let his thoughts show. Everyone sought to avoid risk and maximize their gains. He simply replied, “It was no trouble. The search for our predecessor’s whereabouts is the highest priority.”

Daoist Master Tinglan merely smiled and nodded at his words, saying nothing more. With a light sweep of her sleeve, a table and chairs materialized on the jade platform, seemingly formed from the platform itself. A jade pot sat on the table, the tea inside boiling, steam billowing from its spout.

“Please!”

As they took their seats, Tinglan asked, “You sought me out, Daoist Brother. Is it concerning an array for your clan?”

She had provided the perfect opening. This was indeed one of Li Ximing’s goals. He nodded. “My family has only recently been elevated to an Immortal Clan, and we are indeed lacking a Purple Mansion-level spiritual array. The Purple Smoke Gate is a great sect of array masters, and you, Daoist Sister, are a grandmaster of the art. I came to ask for your guidance.”

Tinglan glanced at him and smiled. “You are no slouch yourself, Daoist Brother.”

In truth, Li Ximing had only just broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm and was hardly a master of alchemy. Tinglan, for her part, was not yet capable of setting up a Purple Mansion array on her own. The exchange brought a wry smile to both their faces, and they dropped the pretenses.

Li Ximing’s expression turned serious. “Please, instruct me.”

Tinglan nodded. “There are three crucial elements to a Purple Mansion Grand Array,” she began softly. “First and foremost is the spiritual item at its core. Second is the foundation of the array. Last is the Divine Ability and dharma power of the cultivator setting it up.”

“The foundation of the array consists of the spiritual energy, the earth veins, the Great Void, and the array’s nodes. Though incredibly expensive, these are often manageable for cultivators like us. The true difficulty lies in finding a suitable spiritual item for the array, and in the fact that not every cultivator’s Divine Ability can properly channel the wondrous properties of such objects.”

Li Ximing considered her words.

“Your clan must first acquire a Purple Mansion-level spiritual item,” Tinglan continued. “Then, I can come and assess it. If we proceed, I have a few friends who can assist. It would take about three to five years before the array is operational.”

She paused, clearly thinking of the Profound Peak mountain sect, and poured him a cup of tea. “However, if you have a Purple Mansion array that can be moved, that changes things entirely. I would still need to survey your lake, realign the earth veins, and fill in lakes or level mountains where necessary. It would be a great deal of work upfront, but the setup would be much faster and far less expensive.”

The tea was surprisingly good, far better than anything Li Ximing or Daoist Master Changxi could brew. He took a sip, noticing Tinglan’s unusual enthusiasm for the matter. “So it takes that long,” he said. “I was hoping for your assistance, Daoist Sister, but I didn’t realize it would require such a monumental effort…”

Tinglan had been waiting for this. “Do not worry, Daoist Brother. I also require your help. I need you to refine a pill for me.”

“Refine a pill?” Li Ximing frowned. “Is it something your own Divine Ability cannot handle?”

For a Purple Mansion cultivator, creating pills was a simple matter of shaping them with a wave of the hand. If it required his intervention, it was surely no ordinary pill.

At his question, Tinglan nodded slowly but did not speak. She turned to the female cultivator in yellow. “Danying, take our young friend on a tour of the Blessed Land.”

Cui Jueyin understood immediately. After a nod from Li Ximing, he and the woman departed swiftly. The purple mist closed behind them.

Only then did Tinglan speak. “When cultivators like us use our Divine Abilities for alchemy, we can only manage pills for the Foundation Establishment or Qi Refining realms. We are not like you, who have practiced the Dao of Alchemy from the start. For you, the Shengyang Acupoint pushing into the Great Void is a state of perfect balance between yin and yang. For us, if we put our full power into refining, over time our Divine Ability will inevitably affect our Shengyang residence, throwing our yin and yang out of balance. I even have to rely on Hengxing for decent Essence Gathering Pills. Anything more powerful is simply beyond me.”

She took out a jade slip, casually broke the seal with a wave of her hand, and placed it on the table. “Please take a look, Daoist Brother,” she said with a smile, “and tell me if it can be done.”

This was an unexpected boon. Li Ximing picked up the slip and began to read.

“Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill”

As expected, it was a Purple Mansion-level pill of considerable complexity. It required an incredibly precious Purple Mansion spiritual item, Immeasurable Water and Fire, as a harmonizing agent. The ingredients had to be refined with Divine Ability sixteen thousand, two hundred times before the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness could be used as the pill’s body.

Li Ximing gritted his teeth. 'You people of the Purple Smoke Gate… so wealthy! Even Tinglan, who isn't a Kan, is this extravagant. Immeasurable Water and Fire, Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness… if I could obtain either one of those, I’d be happy for three days straight…'

The slip didn’t list the pill’s other primary ingredients, only the secondary ones, the general procedure, and a description of the refining difficulty. There was no mention of the pill’s effects, but as an alchemist, Li Ximing understood enough.

“This is a Valley Water spiritual pill for extracting and gathering primal essence… not exactly an orthodox concoction…”

He pondered for a moment. “I must ask, Daoist Sister, do the primary ingredients include spiritual items of the Veiled Yin or Radiant Essence type?”

“Of course not!” Tinglan’s attitude brightened considerably when he didn’t immediately refuse. She smiled. “I anticipated that! It is precisely because of the Valley Water that it clashes with the Hengzhu rites. That is why Daoist Brother Hengxing dared not refine this pill for me. If it contained something like Veiled Yin… I wouldn’t dare ask for your help either.”

Now Li Ximing understood why she hadn’t sought out Daoist Master Hengxing. He weighed his options. 'The difficulty of this pill is unprecedented. Fortunately, the challenge lies in the refining process, not in an insurmountable barrier of Divine Ability. At worst, the yield will be low, and it will take more time. It’s not impossible.'

He thought for a moment more, then asked for confirmation. “Do you have the Immeasurable Water and Fire?”

Tinglan nodded and had someone bring a large stone box from the base of the mountain. She opened it with her Divine Ability and took out a small, palm-sized clay pot. Its surface was smooth and covered in intricate gold and white patterns.

The moment the pot was placed on the table, it appeared perfectly ordinary to the naked eye. But in Li Ximing’s spiritual sense, a thunderclap exploded. He perceived an intertwining of water and fire around the pot, so intense that the surrounding spiritual energy fled from it as if from a cursed star. In the Great Void, a new peak seemed to rise out of nowhere.

“I have the spiritual item,” Tinglan said, her voice filled with hope. “But this Immeasurable Water and Fire repels spiritual energy. Controlling it with one’s Divine Ability is incredibly draining. Are you confident, Daoist Brother? If you are to use this fire for alchemy, you might need to prepare some spiritual pills to maintain clarity of mind.”

But Li Ximing cared little for Immeasurable Water and Fire. His spiritual sense swept over it, and his Talisman Qi reacted. As long as it was fire, it could not escape the control of his Talisman Qi’s Valley Wind Guides the Flame. He never used his spiritual sense to control fire; it cost him nothing. How else could he have single-handedly supplied the Li family’s demand for pills while still cultivating?

“As long as the primary ingredient is not a fellow cultivator, and it does not violate my clan’s principles, I can attempt it,” he said. “However, my skills are not yet perfected. I fear I can produce no more than three pills.”

“Excellent!”

The Daoist Master in the autumn-yellow dress was pleasantly surprised by his confidence. 'Bright Yang accompanied by Radiant Fire,' she mused. 'It has control over fire, but is not fire itself. Perhaps that gives him an unusual degree of mastery over Immeasurable Water and Fire…'

Her confidence in him grew. Daoist Master Tinglan smiled and nodded, her expression turning serious. “If you can refine this pill for me, and your clan has a suitable spiritual item, then I will handle the array for Moongaze Lake. If… you intend to move an existing array… I can handle that as well. The value is not equal, of course, so I will compensate you with other things.”

Li Ximing had his own Whole Pill Purple Mansion spiritual item, but he had no intention of revealing it just yet. He let out a slow breath and raised an eyebrow. “I do have one question. Daoist Master Chuting of the Lixia Xiao Clan is a far superior alchemist than I. Why did you not seek him out? You might have gotten more pills and not wasted such a precious ingredient as the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness.”

Li Ximing had known of the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness since he was in the Qi Refining realm. It was a Purple Mansion-level spiritual water, also known as Primal Water, capable of cleansing one’s immortal foundation and bringing the dead back to life. Its preciousness was second only to treasures like the Supreme Yin Moon Essence.

There were many life-saving spiritual items, but few that could truly cheat death. Furthermore, the ability to cleanse one’s immortal foundation could allow a mediocre cultivator to leap into the ranks of the elite, rivaling the direct descendants of Purple Mansion clans.

Once used in alchemy, the Immeasurable Water and Fire could be recovered, but the Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness would be gone forever. The thought of such a loss made Li Ximing’s heart ache.

At his question, Daoist Master Tinglan shook her head. “I did consider seeking out that senior… but I would not be able to get an audience with him. Even if I did, I would not dare trust him. And even if I gritted my teeth and did trust him, the price would be astronomical. That old man’s mind is as deep as an abyss. You, Daoist Brother, are far more approachable.”

Li Ximing nodded, a strange feeling creeping over him.

'So, I’m the budget-friendly, more desperate, and easier to manipulate option…'

Daoist Master Tinglan glanced at him slyly and chuckled. “Don’t overthink it, Daoist Brother. My Purple Smoke Gate has a great need for refined pills, and several of my friends are also struggling with this. If this venture is successful, there will be many more pills to refine. There are great benefits for both our families in the future.”

Li Ximing listened to her empty promises, murmuring his assent. Tinglan pushed the jade slip toward him. “I will leave this with you for now. It contains some notes and insights on alchemy from a predecessor. Perhaps you will find it useful.”

Li Ximing was indeed tempted by the Purple Mansion-level insights in the slip, but he didn’t move. He finally understood the source of his unease.

'So, Tinglan’s real purpose in meeting me was for alchemy. It likely has nothing to do with Shanji Prefecture… Oh, Kong Guxi… you are willing to give up Shanji Prefecture, but she may not even want it! She’ll probably make you beg her to take it!'
