# Chapter 435: The Separation of Immortals and Mortals

Li Yuanping returned to the town, his heart still aching with anger and sorrow. His eyes were bloodshot as he entered the main hall which was dimly lit, with two small flickering lamps barely illuminating the space.

Dragging his exhausted body along, he sat on the highest seat and picked up a document, only to find himself unable to focus. Frustrated, he coughed twice, swallowing the blood that rose in his throat.

Dou Yi hurried in, climbing the steps quickly. Li Yuanping spoke in a low voice, "Prepare the ink."

Dou Yi obediently ground the ink, and after finishing, Li Yuanping waved him away. Taking up the brush, Li Yuanping gradually calmed down, taking some time to think through his thoughts carefully.

The position of family head required balancing the external branches of the clan, managing the spirit fields, and distributing the clan's stipends. It involved managing the benefits of nearly the entire clan, from those in the Embryonic Breathing Realm to those in the Qi Cultivation Realm. Ever since Li Xuanxuan became the family head and established the four lineages, the rule of single succession had been set.

Now, with the Li Family firmly under the control of the main family endowed with the talisman seed, the family head could be appointed arbitrarily, with the wise ruling and the foolish obeying.

But once this precedent was set, future descendants of the main family, whose bloodlines would become more distant and whose backgrounds would differ, might begin to support different lineages, leading to internal strife.

"If it comes to that, the position of family head will become a tool for power struggles among the talisman seed-bearing cultivators, used to exploit the family... Moreover..."

As Li Yuanping's emotions settled, his thoughts became sharper, and he mused, "Seeing how things are with Ming'er, he is ultimately not fit for great responsibility. If the Li Family were handed over to him, how could he suppress the external branches? How could he control someone like Li Jiman?"

The hall was silent, with only Li Yuanping sitting high above in the dim light, his gaze fixed on the flickering lamps. His voice was low as he continued solemnly, "In the end, the family lacks a figure of great power to maintain order. Foundation Establishment Realm may be achievable, but the Purple Mansion Realm is far beyond reach. Without significant fortune, the family is destined for decline or division..."

He stared blankly ahead of him as the first light of dawn slowly crept into the hall. His elder brother, Li Yuanjiao, stood quietly at the entrance, unnoticed by Li Yuanping, who was deep in thought.

As the morning light climbed the steps of the main hall, Li Yuanping spoke in a muffled voice, "The current clan law was established by our great-grandfather. In those days, the family had only a few in the Embryonic Breathing Realm... how could he have foreseen today's situation? Simply following the old laws may not be the best approach..."

Only then did Li Yuanping notice Li Yuanjiao standing before him. His gaze was sharp as he spoke softly, "Brother, if I were to die, who in the family should take the lead, suppress the external branches, command Mount Yue, and manage the clan while nurturing the younger generation?"

Li Yuanjiao hesitated before answering slowly, "At present, only Xijun is capable of such a task. Aside from him, Xicheng is too kind, and Ximing is..."

"It is indeed difficult to pick among those in the generation of Xi and Yue! They are all highly talented. By right, none should be singled out to lead. But if their generation passes without a strong leader, and the next generation lacks a dominant figure, what then?" Li Yuanping asked.

Li Yuanjiao vaguely understood the meaning behind his words and replied, "If that happens, it cannot be helped."

"Brother, I intend to reform the clan system."

He suddenly stood up and declared, "The authority of the family head is far too great, a system established during the time of Lord Xiangping... But how many in the clan can match him? This method centralizes power and benefits, but it is truly too difficult to manage. Our descendants cannot always produce individuals with exceptional cunningness but moderate talent. What happened with Ximing may seem coincidental, but in truth, it reveals that our family can no longer sustain such a system of governance. Sooner or later, something will go wrong."

Li Yuanjiao looked at him intently, saying nothing for a long time. Finally, he replied gently, "Do what you must. I will support you."

Li Yuanping seemed to have fully recovered from his disappointment in his eldest son, but there was a lingering sense of melancholy as he said in a deep voice, "First, we'll measure the spirit fields, record everything... and begin to decentralize power!"

————

For prestigious clans, it was nearly impossible to fully account for privately held spirit fields. Even the Azure Pond Sect couldn't accurately assess the spirit fields of the clans under its jurisdiction, having to rely on a rough estimate based on the number of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators when collecting tribute.

The reason was simple: as long as an illusionary formation was in place, a small piece of land could easily blend into the vast mountains and seas, making it virtually impossible to detect unless by sheer chance or a sweep of one's spiritual sense.

Although the Azure Pond Sect had specialized techniques for breaking formations, it was unrealistic to inspect every cun of land thoroughly, so they had to rely on estimations based on earth veins and spirit veins.

This same reason explained why so many remnants of the Immortal-Devil War still existed within the sea, with their protective formations so advanced that even if one were to bash their head against them, they still would not be able to find the entrance.

However, when Li Yuanjiao summoned the mirror, he was able to see every cun of the Li Family's land clearly. He could immediately identify which prominent families had secretly built small courtyards and demarcated spirit fields, as they were all exposed before his eyes.

"Indeed..."

This situation was inevitable. Every prominent family under the Li Family's rule had privately developed spirit fields. In the barren lands that the Li Family had deemed worthless, they had secretly enclosed courtyards and set up illusionary formations to plant spirit paddies.

This was considered the lesser offense. Over the years, as more external cultivators joined the family, they had come into contact with many cultivation methods from rogue cultivators. Not all children with a spiritual orifice were sent to the Li Family; some external cultivators even ventured out to seek other opportunities, never to return.

Li Yuanjiao's gaze swept over the area, noting that even some minor sect cultivators of the Xi and Yue generation were involved. He sighed quietly.

"These lands may be barren, but they are still free! After all, no matter how good the family's lands are, most of the yield still has to be handed over. It is far more satisfying to grow and harvest for oneself."

The family had inspected these spirit fields twice before, and those remaining were within the allowed regulations. Li Yuanjiao carefully documented everything and returned to the hall, where Li Yuanping had been writing furiously for some time.

When Li Yuanjiao returned, Li Yuanping took the map he had drawn and circled several immortal mountains. After pondering for a moment, he spoke softly, "Brother, I have carefully studied the old methods from Lixia Prefecture and the current practices of the Yuan Family... Take a look at my plan."

Li Yuanjiao lowered his head to examine it, and at the top were large letters: Dual Clan System, Peak and Town Counterbalance.

Li Yuanping, his face pale but eyes bright, explained, "Now that our family has more cultivators than ever, I want to separate the clan system from the sect system, placing the clan above and the sect below, separating immortals from mortals. Cultivators would join the peaks and form the clan, while mortals would descend the mountain and form the sect. Unless specifically assigned for demon extermination, none are permitted to descend the mountain.

"When an external or clan member develops a spiritual orifice, they will be sent to the main peak of Mount Lijing to cultivate, where our family cultivators will carefully guide them. Those with high aptitude will continue their cultivation, while those with lower aptitude will be sent to other peaks.

"Each immortal mountain will establish its own office, dispersing the descendants of the four lineages into them. They will have a peak master, an enforcer, and a clan chief... All spirit fields below the mountain will no longer be individually assigned but managed by the respective immortal mountains.

"The cultivators of each immortal mountain will rotate and be reassigned regularly. The collected spirit resources will be sent directly to Lijing and delivered to the cave dwelling on Mount Meiche. As for the family head... the head will handle promotions and assignments, while the clan chiefs and enforcers will monitor the clan's affairs. With the mirror in the family, any embezzlement of spirit resources is almost certain to be exposed!"

Li Yuanping's eyes gleamed brightly as he went on, "Looking at today's situation, many of the external and branch cultivators are stealing spirit paddies, searching for treasures, transporting spirit resources, and seeking the Dao outside because there are no other paths to take within the family aside from cultivating spirit paddies. Without the opportunity for advancement, there is naturally no loyalty."

Finally, he concluded, "Under this new system, not only would our family no longer need to find large talentless direct descendants to manage the family and maintain stability, but it would also create positions and ranks that would attract people to align with our family..."

Li Yuanjiao read through the detailed regulations. Naturally, Li Yuanping had included much more than he had mentioned verbally. The plan was filled with various checks and balances, cultivation restrictions, and measures to curb corruption and rebellion.

"If this is the case, the Clan Affairs Courtyard will need many more personnel for oversight, and the various ranks will require clan stipends to maintain integrity..." Li Yuanjiao frowned as he read, realizing that while Li Yuanping's plan could indeed appease most cultivators, it would significantly increase the Li Family's governance costs. He hesitated, weighing the potential benefits against the losses.

However, Li Yuanping smiled confidently and responded readily, "Cultivating immortality and seeking the Dao is inherently one of the most greed-driven pursuits. Our family will soon be able to produce elixirs. Once these are tied to the ranks, many will flock to them! Besides, the desire for power is one of the Nine Calamities; when combined with other incentives, few can resist."

He added in a low voice, "As long as the external and branch families are eager to climb the ranks, they can be used by us. We will not need to rely on producing a genius every generation who can suppress and command them; even ordinary people will suffice. Even in normal times, we could promote people at will based on the lists provided by the Clan Affairs Courtyard... This would allow us to manage the family even in the midst of cultivation."

Li Yuanjiao gradually became intrigued, picking up where Li Yuanping left off, "This way, our family would not need to constantly monitor the external families. As long as we keep an eye on a few outstanding individuals and marry them into the family, the mirror will keep everything under control, allowing us to secure our position on the immortal mountain..."

"Exactly."

Li Yuanping agreed and continued, "Even if we have to distribute more clan stipends, so what? Brother, you are about to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm; the family will soon be very different."

Li Yuanjiao finally nodded in agreement, saying, "But in the end, it is because we descendants are unworthy, unable to concentrate power in one person, so we must delegate power and benefits to maintain stability. I just wonder... I just wonder how we will face our ancestors."

Li Yuanping nodded silently, comforting him, "Maximum benefit does not always mean maximum stability. As our family continues to expand, division of power will become inevitable... We cannot afford to lose."

Li Yuanjiao spoke with him for a while, feeling heavy-hearted, and then set off for Mount Wutu, intending to spend some time stabilizing his cultivation before entering seclusion to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Mount Yuting.

The snow on Mount Yuting remained pristine and bright. Li Xijun opened his eyes, exhaling a breath of white mist that collided with the longsword in his hand, forming a thin layer of frost.

"The Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual is indeed a Grade Three technique, cloaking me in dew and snow, allowing me to ride on cold winds."

His white robes fluttered as his power reached the first heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. His true essence was as pure as frost which was swirling all around him, and combined with the sharp blade in his hand, he appeared untouched by the world.

In just over two years, three members of the Xi and Yue generation had broken through in succession, adding three Qi Cultivators to the Li Family's main lineage.

Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong had both gone into seclusion one after the other, and both the main lineage and external branches of the family had made significant progress. The number of minor sect cultivators in the Yuan and Qing generation was few, but with the Xi and Yue generation, the minor sect cultivators, mainly from the first and second lineages, had begun to take charge of the spirit fields.

According to the Li Family's ancestral laws, most of the descendants of Li Mutian's illegitimate brothers had gradually transformed from minor sects into side branches due to the rarity of spiritual orifices, slowly fading from history.

With the restraint of offspring by the two major sects of the Xuan and Jing generation, Li Xuanling and Li Xuanfeng, it was not until the third generation that the minor sects of the four lineages in the Li Family began to flourish, led by the minor sects formed by the illegitimate sons of Li Xuanxuan and Li Yuanyun, who took over the power of the previous generation.

Of course, Li Xijun saw this as a favorable development. It prevented the emergence of hundreds of mortal elders of his father's generation, but brought the estranged minor sect closer to the center of power and thus resolved many conflicts.

"Young master."

An Siming, with a sword at his side, approached and cupped his fist respectfully.

Li Xijun, who had been in seclusion for a year and a half, suddenly noticed that An Siming's spirit and demeanor had changed. He seemed more hopeful in life and was more motivated. Li Xijun could not help but laugh at this observation and ask, "Have you taken a wife?"

An Siming was taken aback, shaking his head repeatedly before continuing, "You must be joking, young master! Young Master Xicheng is already waiting at the foot of the mountain."

Li Xijun descended gracefully to the foot of the mountain, where his elder brother, Li Xicheng, had been waiting for some time, clad in leather armor. He looked more mature now, seeming to be around twenty-six or twenty-seven years old.

Li Xicheng was also at the Qi Cultivation Realm, practicing the River One Qi Technique. He had married a woman from the Tian Family and taken concubines mostly from the An Family, so he had many children, most of whom were two or three years old.

As a father to so many children now, Li Xicheng had grown a beard and tied his hair, exuding a dignified presence. He greeted Li Xijun with a warm smile, saying, "It has been a long time, brother."

Li Xijun nodded slightly and landed beside him. A nearby horse snorted, eyeing him warily.

Li Xijun scanned the area with his spiritual sense, noting that the sides were filled with cultivators, primarily his illegitimate brothers and external branches of humble origins, all standing respectfully on either side.

As a youth, Li Xicheng had loved to protect his kin and befriend cultivators. Those who had benefited from his kindness now flocked around him.

Li Xicheng waved his broad hand, and the crowd dispersed right away. The two brothers strolled along the stone path, and Li Xicheng, in a warm tone, said with a smile, "This past year, while you and Ximing were in seclusion, there have been significant changes in the family. The family head has reformed the clan system; it is no longer as it was before."

He then recounted all the events of the past year and a half. Li Xijun frowned as he listened, and when Li Xicheng finally finished, he added, "Now, the changes have taken effect easily. Several immortal mountains have been restructured, and the construction of grand palaces is in full swing. All the cultivators are cooperating, contributing their money and effort..."

"They would naturally cooperate!"

Li Xijun thought it through quickly and understood the situation clearly. His expression darkened, and he said coldly, "The clan has given them power and stipends. They are not fools; of course they are pleased!"

Li Xijun spoke these words, but inwardly he pondered to himself, No wonder the spiritual qi on Mount Yuting has diminished significantly. It turns out that cultivators have entered the mountain! The family should start building a spirit-gathering formation so as not to delay the cultivation of the main lineage.

Li Xicheng quickly smiled, trying to smooth things over, "They are not taking it for free. The clan has assigned them various tasks, and now they are out there working—even bringing in some extra income for the family!"

Seeing that Li Xicheng still did not understand, Li Xijun looked around, saw no one nearby, and sighed as he spoke his thoughts.

"Brother, our elders have reluctantly divided their power. As juniors, we should feel ashamed, not proud..."
