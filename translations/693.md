# Chapter 693: Martial Brothers

Si Yuanli strode down from the main seat. With a flicker of his spiritual qi, the painting he had been working on ignited, the fine paper curling into a ball of crimson flame on the jade desk before collapsing into a pile of black ash. Dantai Jin dared not look, following closely behind him.

"Xiao Chuting?" he asked, his voice low and urgent.

"He must have had a hand in this!" Si Yuanli replied under his breath. Though his face was a mask of calm, the wide, hurried strides betrayed the turmoil within. "At first, I thought Xiao Yuansi acted alone, taking advantage of the old man's absence in the Northern Sea and a push from other factions to force the pill refinement... but now, it's clear. Xiao Chuting even used his own descendant as a pawn! The 'Man on Creek' of Pit Water... he truly lives up to his name."

"For the past century, since reaching the Purple Mansion Realm, Xiao Chuting has been infallible, maneuvering between the Azure Pond and Golden Feather Sects until he became one of the most formidable figures of his generation... I never should have assumed he had miscalculated!"

Dantai Jin murmured, "Could it be... that Li Ximing is the most cunning of the four 'Xi' siblings? That he's been playing the fool all this time?"

Si Yuanli considered this for a moment. He gathered the hem of his robes and rose into the air on a gust of wind. "Unlikely," he said, shaking his head. "There are no secrets from those with fate-seeing divine powers. Besides, the heavens wouldn't be so generous. Li Xizhi and Li Xijun were already exceptional talents, and I hear Li Xicheng was also a man who gives his all. How could there be yet another in Li Ximing?"

"Xiao Chuting was certainly involved in the planning, but there's something else strange about this. Either there's a problem with Li Ximing's celestial phenomenon, or there's a problem with the man himself. When the Daoist Master returns, I will ask for his guidance."

He flew with Dantai Jin toward the Heaven-Probing Pavilion. As the immortal structure slowly came into view, Si Yuanli composed himself, a brilliant smile spreading across his face.

'Fortunately, I've always been careful to maintain appearances,' he thought. 'My attitude now won't seem out of place. If I hadn't laid the groundwork, rushing over like this would appear far too eager and opportunistic.'

***

“I, Zhaojing, Li Ximing of the Moongaze Li clan, have this day achieved the Bright Yang divine power..."

The resonant voice pierced through the Great Void, brushing against the Azure Pond Sect's Heavenly Origin Dao Spiritual Formation. The array, sensing only sound and no hostile power, merely shimmered once before letting the announcement pass.

The voice swept through the entire Azure Pond mountain range, echoing and lingering until it reached the pavilion perched high above the clouds.

*Clink... clank...*

The jade talismans hanging in the pavilion chimed, stirred by the sound waves. On the top floor, a middle-aged man in feathered robes looked up, staring blankly at the clouds.

Behind him stood a man in black, his face grim. Shadowy, serpent-like tails writhed beneath his robes. He, too, was frozen in place, his expression one of utter disbelief.

"Ximing?"

Li Xizhi listened to the announcement repeat several times. His eyebrows shot up, a shocked, almost dreamlike smile gracing his lips. He paced the floor of the pavilion, the world so quiet he could hear the crisp, clear chimes of the jade talismans.

"Ximing... Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing?!"

He murmured the name, a flush rising to his cheeks. It all felt so unreal. "I was still scheming how to protect Zhouwei," he chuckled, "and my brother has already reached the Purple Mansion Realm..."

Li Wushao, standing beside him, looked even more incredulous.

'Damn it all... am I now the spirit beast of a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan?'

A wave of exhilaration washed over Li Xizhi. He laughed, a rare loss of composure, his steps light as he pushed open the pavilion window. In the distance, several streaks of light were speeding toward them.

As the voice spread across the better part of Yue State, Li Xizhi felt a mysterious warmth rise in his sea of qi. The tri-colored talismanic energy of his Rainbow Pierce Skyway technique grew brighter, shining with a newfound brilliance.

"My Rainbow Pierce Skyway has advanced to the next level!"

Li Xizhi paused, then understood immediately. The power of Rainbow Pierce Skyway was tied to his status. With the news of his brother's breakthrough, his own standing as one of the three 'Xi' of the Li clan had soared. The change was palpable!

"It seems I've benefited as well!"

He smiled as he watched the approaching lights. A sharp knock came at the pavilion door, and a youth hurried in. He wore an exquisite jade crown and silver-white robes, a magnificent red brocade cloak draped over his shoulders. He bowed with a jubilant air.

"Congratulations, Master! A joyous occasion! Daoist Master Zhaojing has forged his divine power!"

After a flurry of congratulations, he finally turned to Li Wushao with a smile. "Greetings, Guardian!"

Li Wushao had been cultivating alongside Li Xizhi, while the more powerful Li Qiyun had been dispatched to guard the spirit jade mine in the Helin Mountains.

Li Wushao returned the greeting. Behind the first youth stood another, a head taller and powerfully built, a bow slung across his back. His expression was serious, but his eyes shone with joy.

Li Xizhi, who always prized composure, couldn't help but laugh aloud at such wonderful news. His face was alight with excitement as he stroked his beard. "Duan'er, quickly, open the side gates of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion. You stand at the main gate to receive our guests. Have Junwei wait at the secondary gate."

He quickly regained his poise, though his eyes still danced with amusement. "The Sect Master is coming. See that you don't neglect him."

The youth in red and white was his eldest disciple, Quan Yuduan, a relative of the late Quan Yi. The powerfully built young man behind him was his second disciple, Zhao Junwei.

After Tuoba Chongyuan killed Quan Yi, only his elderly mother was left. Li Xizhi had cared for her until she passed away a few years prior. Unwilling to see the Quan line fade, the old woman had written several letters to relatives outside the sect. To honor her wishes, Li Xizhi found Quan Yuduan among some distant kin who had been reduced to country squires and brought him into the sect.

A year later, while inspecting the family's spirit jade vein in the Helin Mountains, Li Xizhi took Zhao Junwei, the son of a local hunter, as his second disciple. More than a decade had passed since then.

"As you command, Master!" Quan Yuduan replied, turning to leave with a spring in his step. The boy was ecstatic, and even Zhao Junwei, who had only been cultivating for ten years, understood the significance of the Purple Mansion Realm. The two of them were clearly overjoyed, and laughter filled the pavilion.

Li Xizhi smiled softly.

In his earlier, more precarious years, he hadn't dared to grow too close to the major families. Thus, both his disciples came from humble backgrounds. Quan Yuduan could at least be considered the son of a wealthy family whose ancestors had been cultivators, and he possessed decent talent. Zhao Junwei, however, was a true commoner with mediocre aptitude. Fortunately, both were diligent, and Zhao Junwei's character was particularly outstanding.

'Si Yuanli is here...'

He gently tapped the jade window, watching the two familiar streaks of light arrive. He turned and walked out of the pavilion just in time to see Si Yuanli approaching with a look of utter delight.

"A truly joyous occasion!" Si Yuanli boomed. "Daoist Master Zhaojing's success is an inspiration to us all! For your esteemed family to become an Immortal Clan is the greatest news this century has seen!"

Li Xizhi responded politely, his gaze drifting past Si Yuanli to the smiling man behind him.

'Dantai Jin!'

He was no stranger to the man, who had joined the sect a decade ago. Rumor had it he was the prized disciple of an overseas Purple Mansion cultivator, one who had been aided by Daoist Master Yuanxiu, Si Boxiu, in the past. With Si Boxiu's lifespan dwindling, this was clearly one of the arrangements he had made for the future.

After exchanging pleasantries, Si Yuanli smiled. "I've sent someone to the Southern Borderlands to summon Yuanqin. He will be overjoyed to hear of your family's great fortune!"

'Yuanqin...'

Li Xizhi hadn't seen Li Yuanqin much in recent years. After his Foundation Establishment, he had taken the Ning family to guard the Southern Borderlands. Perhaps because of his sensitive position, he rarely contacted Li Xizhi.

Just then, another figure approached the pavilion. He wore vine armor, a gourd tied to his waist, and carried a commanding presence. It was Lingu Rao, the "Scorpion Child," who had once been as famous as Li Xuanfeng.

The middle-aged man clasped his hands and smiled. "Congratulations, Pavilion Master!"

The three families were still, overtly and covertly, on friendly terms. Si Yuanli also greeted Lingu Rao as a senior. The atmosphere was warm and lively, with smiles on every face.

After offering their congratulations, the visitors from the other families departed. For the rest of the day, a steady stream of guests arrived at the pavilion. Li Xizhi greeted them all, and it wasn't until sunset that he finally had a moment to himself.

"Yuduan," he said softly, "have they all been seen off?"

Quan Yuduan bowed. "There is one person still downstairs, Master. He's been pacing back and forth for a long time, too afraid to come up."

"Oh?" Li Xizhi knew exactly who it was. "And who might that be?"

"The Qingsui Peak Master!" Quan Yuduan replied with a cold smile.

He was no pampered fool. Life as a country squire was full of its own petty squabbles, and his childhood had not been without hardship. How could he not know about the feud between his master and the Qingsui Peak Master, Yuan Chengzhao?

While Yuan Chengzhao had been stewing below, Quan Yuduan had greeted the other guests with a warm smile but had not spared him a single glance. If not for Yuan Chengzhao's status as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he wouldn't have even shown him that much courtesy.

Li Xizhi shook his head. "He is your martial uncle, after all. Go and invite him up."

Quan Yuduan complied and went downstairs. A moment later, the deep, polite voice of his second disciple, Zhao Junwei, could be heard.

"Martial Uncle... please!"

Quan Yuduan, who wore his heart on his sleeve, clearly had no desire to bow to Yuan Chengzhao and had passed the task to the more diplomatic Zhao Junwei. Li Xizhi heard his junior martial brother's sigh, then the sound of him straightening his robes before the door creaked open.

"Chengzhao pays his respects to Senior Brother!"

Yuan Chengzhao didn't dare to look at him, dropping to his knees.

Li Xizhi stood bathed in the golden light of the setting sun, hesitating.

Yuan Chengzhao had always feared him. Their own master, Yuan Tuan, was perpetually absent, so Li Xizhi had always filled the role of the stern elder. To Yuan Chengzhao, he was less a senior brother and more a master.

But human nature is a tangled thing. Despite his fear, Yuan Chengzhao had repeatedly bowed to the Chi clan and placed obstacles in Li Xizhi's path. When Chi Buhua had tracked him down, he had used one of Li Xizhi's old personal items—an item that Li Xizhi was certain had come from his junior brother.

The irony was that after the Chi clan fell and the Si family began their purge, his terrified junior brother's first act was not to come to him, but to run to Si Yuanli. He had knelt, clutched Si Yuanli's leg, and begged him not to reveal that Chi Buhua had gotten the item from him, fearing Li Xizhi's wrath.

'To be so utterly lost! Why would Si Yuanli ever hide such a thing for me? He'd be delighted to see us at each other's throats!'

Li Xizhi's gaze was filled with disappointment. He had watched this boy grow up on the mountain and truly felt a mentor's affection for him. He knew Yuan Chengzhao was weak, but he never imagined he could be so utterly clueless.

Kneeling on the floor, the Foundation Establishment cultivator was already drenched in a cold sweat.

"It has been many years," Li Xizhi said softly. "It seems your misfortune has become your fortune."

Yuan Chengzhao knew exactly what he meant, and the hair on his neck stood on end. In recent years, Si Yuanli had not been stingy with his gifts. Yuan Chengzhao's own talent wasn't poor, but he had relied on the Si family's resources to reach Foundation Establishment. Si Yuanli, all smiles on the surface, had never missed an opportunity to prop up a member of the Yuan family who held a grudge against Li Xizhi.

"Senior Brother... I was wrong," he pleaded, his voice choked with grief. "I was forced... Both Chi Zhiyun and Chi Zhiyan, and later Chi Fubo and Chi Buhua... and now the Sect Master... I couldn't afford to offend any of them! Chi Buhua was at the peak of Foundation Establishment, and I was just a lowly Qi Refining cultivator. When he asked for the item, how... how could I refuse!"

He began to weep, his head striking the floor with dull thuds. Li Xizhi looked away, gazing at the distant sunset.

"You set foot on a path of no return long ago," he said quietly. "The moment you coveted power and accepted the position of Qingsui Peak Master, you became the Chi clan's pawn. You were a piece meant to counterbalance me, and no matter who held power, they would never let that piece go."

"If, on that day, you had been able to quiet your heart and refuse the temptation of power, if you had taken a mission to leave the sect and distance yourself from the Azure Pond... would you be in this position today?"

Yuan Chengzhao could only sob and knock his head against the floor. "You're right, Senior Brother! You're right! I was blinded..."

"You need not say such things," Li Xizhi said. "In truth, no one could have predicted today. I should have died in the Eastern Sea long ago, and your Yuan family would have rightfully reclaimed this immortal peak. A perfect ending."

"But the world is full of surprises. If not for Daoist Master Zhaojing's breakthrough, you would still be reaping benefits from every side."

Yuan Chengzhao choked on his sobs, unable to speak.

Li Xizhi lowered his gaze, a trace of sorrow in his heart, but his face remained calm. "There is no need for tears. Go back to where you came from. For our master's sake, all that has passed is forgiven. Do not seek me out again."

He raised his teacup. "Junwei, see our guest out!" he called.

Yuan Chengzhao was aghast. Zhao Junwei stepped forward, but his Qi Refining cultivation was not enough to move the kneeling man.

"I acted foolishly and harmed you, Senior Brother," Yuan Chengzhao cried. "I have no face to return. I will remember your years of guidance for the rest of my life..."

"Be well, Senior Brother... I must protect my clan in this life and cannot serve you. Your kindness... I will repay it in the next..."

He struggled to his feet, his face streaked with tears. "I still wish we could ride the winds together as we once did, soaring across the prefectures, chasing the Dawn Rayfish, and listening to your teachings..."

"But now... that is no longer possible..."

He bowed and backed out of the room. Li Xizhi remained silent. Zhao Junwei escorted him all the way out.

Quan Yuduan, however, simply pursed his lips. He walked briskly to Li Xizhi's side and bowed. "Master, on this joyous occasion, should we make plans to return to the lake?"

Li Xizhi's voice was gentle. "We should. The Azure Pond Sect will also be sending a delegation to offer congratulations. We will travel with them."
