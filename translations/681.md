# Chapter 681: Ambush (Part 1)

The Eastern Sea.

Night rippled across the water, but Green Pine Island remained brightly lit. The forests on the Azure Pond Sect’s immortal peak had been thinned, replaced by a grove of iron pillars. Streaks of dark red blood, remnants of some unknown beast, trickled down the metal, slowly turning to smoke.

A middle-aged man with a sinister air emerged from the forest of pillars, the treasures hanging from his waist jingling with every step. Upon seeing him, a group of cultivators hurried to offer fawning greetings.

“Greetings, Lord Fei!”

This was Fei Luoya, once a disciple of Mount Wu. He had visited the Li family several times in the past, begging for a path to escape his circumstances, only to be captured by Li Xuanfeng and sent to serve the Ning family. Decades had passed since then.

Fei Luoya’s reddish eyes flickered over them, but he offered no reply. A few guest elders scurried to his side, attending to his every need with obsequious praise.

Fei Luoya was ruthless and cunning. He had spent years clawing his way up the ranks through any means necessary. Hailing from Mount Wu, he was well-versed in the treacherous shamanic arts, which proved highly effective in the Southern Borderlands and fueled his steady ascent.

A few years ago, he had finally caught the eye of the Ning family’s main lineage and earned the trust of Ning Hejing, rising to his current station. No matter how much these Azure Pond guest elders might despise him in private, they had to address him as “Lord” to his face.

Fei Luoya untied a jade pearl from his waist and swept it around him, creating a barrier to prevent eavesdropping. Only then did he speak in a low voice.

“Have you scanned the area with your Dharma artifacts? Is there any movement from the Earth Abyss?”

“None, my lord,” one of the men replied, stepping forward. He presented a palm-sized, turquoise mirror with both hands. “Li Xizhi has not been seen for years. It is likely he has already perished.”

“Not even the Flowing Light Mirror can detect him.”

Fei Luoya pocketed the ancient Dharma artifact. Years ago, he had been nothing but a poor member of the Eastern Yue. Now, he casually used treasures that chimed and clattered as he walked.

‘He’s from the Eastern Yue, through and through,’ the guest elder thought, his face a mask of smiles while his mind churned with disdain. ‘He’ll never lose that tacky habit of hanging every trinket he owns on his body…’

Fei Luoya glanced at him but said nothing. With a flick of his sleeve, he dismissed the crowd and turned back into the iron forest.

Within a pocket of absolute darkness, Ning Hejing sat clad in soft red armor. Opposite him, a portly monk sat with his hands pressed together, a faint smile on his face. A small, sealed letter lay on the stone table between them.

Ning Hejing’s expression was grim. He watched Fei Luoya approach before picking up the letter again.

“A message from the sect.”

The letter was creased from being opened and refolded dozens of times. “Chi Fubo’s people have already left the sect,” Ning Hejing said gravely.

The violent energies within the Earth Abyss had gradually subsided. Li Xizhi was not yet dead, which meant his emergence was only a matter of time. Ning Hejing considered this for a moment, then asked, “Master Monk Liaokong, what news from Chi Zhihu?”

The monk, Liaokong, had a fortunate and guileless appearance. He smiled amiably. “Chi Zhihu plans to make his move against Li Xizhi above the Sea of Reefs. The grand formation is already in place. The moment Li Xizhi passes through, the formation will be activated to ensure his demise.”

“Good…” Ning Hejing’s voice was calm and low. “With you as his backup, Chi Zhihu will have no trouble killing him. And once he does, Si Yuanli will no longer be able to feign ignorance!”

Ning Hejing spoke as if the two were his most trusted confidants, making no effort to hide his intentions. “I must thank you, Master Monk. This plan could not have succeeded without your aid.”

He had chosen to promote Fei Luoya because the man was resourceful and, more importantly, held a grudge against the Li family for seizing his territory, which made him relatively trustworthy. But the one he truly valued was the monk before him.

‘The enemy of my enemy is my friend.’

Setting aside the long-standing conflicts between the Li family and the Buddhist cultivators, the eighteen monks Li Xuanfeng had slain on the river were reason enough. Ning Hejing had seen with his own eyes how deeply Liaokong was committed to the Li family’s destruction and how much effort he had poured into this scheme.

“Daoist Master Suiguan is, after all, a Chi. With Chi Buzi away, it seems Daoist Master Yuanxiu truly has no interest in the position of sect master. The Si family, however, will not be so easily bullied. The moment Li Xizhi dies, Si Yuanli will be forced to retaliate.”

Liaokong sought to eliminate an enemy of his faith, while Ning Hejing wanted to spark a war between Chi Fubo and the Si family. Their goals aligned perfectly. Liaokong had immediately set about approaching Chi Zhihu. That old brute was hot-tempered and had been desperately seeking allies to deal with Li Xizhi; the monk’s arrival was a godsend.

Ning Hejing reviewed the plan in his mind and found no flaws. “That snake demon is nothing special,” he muttered. “It’s a miracle he even survived the Earth Abyss. But even if his luck holds, what can one man and one demon do? Chi Zhihu has three allies, plus you, Master Monk, all concealed by a grand formation. There is no escape!”

“Once Chi Zhihu has killed Li Xizhi, you will immediately reincarnate back in the north, and our hands will be clean…”

Fei Luoya listened, then frowned. “But… my lord, the Earth Abyss has many exits. What if Li Xizhi returns to Green Pine Island to recuperate instead of heading for the Sea of Reefs? Wouldn’t the trap be for nothing?”

Ning Hejing laughed. “That is where you are mistaken.”

The fat monk beside him gave Fei Luoya a meaningful look and shook his head. “Benefactor… this is the result of a divination I performed a few days ago. I needed one of his personal belongings, but unfortunately, Changtian Peak was inaccessible.”

“Fortunately, Li Xizhi once resided on Qingsui Peak. Using an item obtained from Peak Master Yuan, I was able to divine that Li Xizhi has already reached the Sea of Reefs.”

“In fact, he arrived there some time ago and is healing in secret. I will be taking my leave of you two shortly to head there myself.”

Ning Hejing smiled at Fei Luoya. “I only just learned of this myself and hadn’t had a chance to tell you.”

Fei Luoya feigned a sudden understanding, showering them with praises for their brilliance. The two men laughed heartily, but a chill crept through the Eastern Yue man’s heart.

‘He doesn’t trust me.’

Fei Luoya didn’t believe for a second that Ning Hejing had “only just learned” this. All his efforts—sending him to scan the various branches of the Earth Abyss with Dharma artifacts, ordering him to search everywhere—had been nothing but a diversion. He had been deceived along with everyone else.

The man stood silently, his expression serene, but a storm of thoughts raged within him.

***

The Sea of Reefs.

Located on the edge of the Hetian Sea, the water here was shallow and dotted with countless stone reefs. Li Xizhi emerged from a tunnel at the bottom of the sea, having just arrived.

He had hidden in the Earth Abyss for a long time but remained in good condition. Li Wushao, however, was listless and had yet to recover. The old demon, now in human form, was so pale and weak he could barely move. He remained behind to recuperate in a temporary cave residence carved near the exit.

The Dawn Rayfish, Li Qiyun, had fared better. The orange feathers on his cheeks were much brighter now. He had already reverted to his true form to carry Li Xizhi north. Man and fish became a streak of rosy light, moving at astonishing speed.

Li Xizhi consulted a map in his hand. “The nearest market is just ahead,” he said softly. “I’ve been down there for years, and my supply of pills is completely depleted. We’ll buy some more so Wushao can properly heal…”

He seemed utterly without a care, yet his eyes constantly swept over the reefs below, as if searching for something. After flying for a short while, the water beneath them began to boil. Several pillars of white light shot into the sky, coalescing into a shimmering white barrier.

“Li Xizhi!”

A thunderous shout echoed across the sea. Li Xizhi brought the Dawn Rayfish to a halt and looked up. Several figures had appeared above the water. The leader, a Foundation Establishment cultivator with a coarse face and a triumphant expression, was none other than Chi Zhihu.

Behind him stood three guest elders: two middle-aged men in red robes at the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm, and an elderly man in white robes at the late-Foundation Establishment Realm. They all looked familiar; they were Chi Zhihu’s trusted retainers, and Li Xizhi recognized every one of them.

‘Guest Elder Zhao, a Bright Yang cultivator; Xia Yun, who cultivates Molten Fire; and Wu Weibai, the Eastern Yue man stationed overseas…’

Li Xizhi’s gaze swept over them without a trace of fear. He smiled warmly. “Is there anyone else? You might as well all come out at once.”

“You!”

Chi Zhihu had long harbored a deep dislike for Li Xizhi. Seeing the young man’s fearless expression as he rode a magnificent Dawn Rayfish, his triumph quickly soured into vigilance. He remained silent.

He scanned the Dawn Rayfish with his spiritual sense and found it was only at the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm. Relief washed over him. Without giving Li Xizhi a chance to speak, his expression hardened. “Attack!”

In an instant, three beams of Dharma light shot toward Li Xizhi. One was as brilliant as the sun and blindingly fast. Another was searingly hot, attempting to envelop him in flames. The last was a cool, pristine light that snaked through the air, watching him like a venomous serpent.

These three were not merely guest elders of the Azure Pond Sect; they were Chi Zhihu’s most trusted followers. The Dharma lights they unleashed were dazzling and far from ordinary. Chi Zhihu himself stood ready, his hands forming a series of seals as potent spiritual energy pulsed around him.

“Impressive,” Li Xizhi praised with a nod. He gave the Dawn Rayfish a gentle pat, and the creature vanished from beneath his feet. A cauldron-shaped rosy light appeared in his hands as he gave his sleeve a light flick.

“Calamity Dispelling Heart Cauldron!”

The Dharma light that shone like the sun had barely reached him when it was sucked into his palm as if by a great whale, disappearing completely. With another flick of his sleeve, Li Xizhi released the stored energy as a brilliant glow that collided with the searing red light, shattering it into a shower of sparks.

The initial probe was over. Li Xizhi’s form dissolved into several streaks of rosy light, leaving the last Dharma light to dart about aimlessly like a headless fly.

“What a technique…” Wu Weibai, the sole late-Foundation Establishment cultivator among the four, murmured in admiration. His Dharma sword flew from his hand, only to collide with something moving at incredible speed. It wobbled and fell back into his grasp.

Two streaks of rosy light reappeared from the opposite direction. Li Xizhi’s shadow flickered in the air as he sheathed his sword, then vanished once more.

‘His movement technique has reached a profound level!’

The four attackers froze. The elder, Wu Weibai, had seen Lingu Xia in action years ago and knew just how troublesome these elusive light cultivators could be. “Your Highness!” he said gravely.

Chi Zhihu, though reluctant, drew a mirror from his sleeve. He hadn’t expected to need it so soon, and being forced to use it after a single exchange was a blow to his pride.

*Hum!*

The mirror was clearly no ordinary artifact. The moment it appeared, a moving speck of rosy light became visible within the grand formation. A ray of sunlight shot out from the mirror, chasing after the speck.

*Tss!*

While the mirror’s detection ability was formidable, its offensive power was lacking. The ray of sunlight struck the rosy light and vanished without a trace. In return, a brilliant glow shot back toward them—another victim of Calamity Dispelling Heart Cauldron.

The four had studied Li Xizhi’s *Dawn Dew Gathering Technique* before the ambush and were familiar with its techniques. They recognized Calamity Dispelling Heart Cauldron at once.

‘Calamity Dispelling Heart Cauldron is not an easy art to master… He must have spent a great deal of effort on it.’

Chi Zhihu’s eyebrows twitched. He deflected the returned attack with a quick reaction, and a bead of white light pulsed in his hand. “No more delays! Finish this quickly!” he commanded coldly.

He was confident that his preparations were more than sufficient. Four cultivators should have been enough to suppress Li Xizhi, and he still had the monk hiding in the shadows. His only fear was that reinforcements might arrive. “Stop being so timid!” he roared.

*Clang!*

The bead of white light shot from his hand and struck something in mid-air. Unable to dodge, Li Xizhi materialized from the rosy light, his expression finally turning serious. He brought his hands together in a seal.

“Scatter.”

A burst of rosy light erupted from his hands, momentarily pushing the bead of white light back. He drew a fan to block an incoming Dharma sword, already preparing his next art.

“Rainbow Phantom Split”

A multicolored light bloomed, splitting into more than a dozen copies of Li Xizhi. The sky filled with rosy light, momentarily stunning the four attackers. They immediately activated their ocular arts, but they couldn't see through the illusion. Their Dharma lights and swords wavered, their targets lost. Even the bead of white light hesitated.

*Bang!*

In that brief moment of confusion, a loud crash echoed in their ears. A dazzling streak of rosy light flashed past and slammed into Guest Elder Zhao, who was still forming his hand seals.

“Pah!”

He had no time to react. He coughed up a mouthful of blood, his protective Dharma artifact unable to shield him in time, and plunged headfirst into the sea.

“What!”

The rosy light solidified into a youth clad in colorful clothes, with feathers adorning his face. He smiled as he dove into the water after Guest Elder Zhao. Chi Zhihu cursed under his breath and whipped out a talisman.

“Protect me!” he yelled. His spiritual qi surged into the talisman. He glanced back and saw his other two retainers still busy trying to dispel the clones. He cursed them again, but several streaks of rosy light were already converging before him. An orange-yellow speck of light pulsed twice, so bright it made his eyes ache.

‘Not good…’

He felt his hand suddenly go light; the talisman had vanished. His eyes watered from the pain. When he could finally see again, he was horrified to find that every one of the dozen Li Xizhi clones was now holding an identical talisman.

The next moment, all the clones dissolved into motes of orange light and disappeared, leaving only the rosy glow that drifted aimlessly through the formation.

The very first art Li Xizhi had ever mastered was Floating Light Gathering. It was not only his specialty but also the signature technique of a light cultivator. After years of refinement with talismanic qi, his mastery of it had reached a divine level.

“You!”

His two remaining retainers quickly moved to shield him. Wu Weibai sighed and sent a message with his spiritual qi.

‘Your Highness, this man’s Floating Light Gathering is terrifying. If you intend to use a talisman, you must inform us beforehand.’

Although Chi Zhihu had warned them to be ready, the fault was not theirs. Knowing the enemy possessed such a technique, he should have retreated behind them before drawing the talisman, not shouted for protection after it was already in his hand.

Wu Weibai’s words were diplomatic, but Chi Zhihu, unaware of his own lack of combat experience, inwardly blamed his men. A knot of frustration tightened in his chest, mingled with a growing fear of Li Xizhi’s profound skill.

‘I never heard he was so talented with his arts! He hid his abilities well!’

Author's Note: *I know many of you aren't fond of the Azure Pond Sect plotline, so I've been putting it off. But it's a necessary part of the story. I'll try to wrap it up as concisely as possible in the next few chapters before the time skip. With the New Year holiday, everyone is busy, so it will be difficult to release extra chapters. Thank you for your understanding.*
