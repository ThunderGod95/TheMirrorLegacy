# Chapter 957: Azure Pond

The river surged, its dark waters churning violently. Shards of broken ice tumbled and collided, flashing like the fins of some unknown behemoth surfacing from the depths, radiating a bone-chilling light.

The black-robed old man stood frozen in mid-air, staring forward in utter disbelief, his lips trembling.

Qu Bushi was not a skilled fighter. He had been flying high above, observing the situation and ready to provide support. He hadn't sensed a thing when the thick fog first began to roll across the battlefield.

But as the roiling mist swept past his feet, retreating northward like a tide, he found himself watching, mesmerized and blank, even though it hadn't touched him directly.

In a single breath, the battlefield had gone from deafening chaos to absolute, dark silence.

The thunderous, imposing charge from the north bank had vanished. Those monks, one after another, who had fearlessly crossed the river seeking their next life, were now nothing but white bones. They stood, legion, in the dark rain, their silence terrifying.

His vision dimmed, and his spiritual sense felt as if it were coated in dust. Endless white bones, twisted into different postures, stood in the darkness. Most of them seemed to be staring blankly right at him. Qu Bushi still couldn't process what had happened; he only felt a creeping, profound horror.

As if waking from a nightmare, Qu Bushi finally recognized that something was terribly wrong. He stood frozen for another moment, then slowly looked down. Two full breaths passed before he mumbled:

"A divine ability... A divine ability!"

His whisper instantly became a frantic shout that echoed in the night. Qu Bushi scrambled to summon the wind, fleeing south in a panic. He had only just started when he heard a low call from nearby:

"Elder Qu!"

Li Zhouming appeared on the wind, his expression panicked. He didn't dare ignite any spiritual light. When he saw Qu Bushi, his pupils dilated in horror.

"Old man Qu... you!"

Qu Bushi looked down, his vision blurring. Only then did he realize his entire lower body had already turned to white bone. A heavy, overwhelming urge to fall unconscious washed over him. He mumbled, "Ah... I've been hit by the divine ability!"

Li Zhouming had been farther from the battle's center and was less affected by the divine ability's wave. He was on the riverbank to regroup with his brothers but had stumbled upon the old man instead. A pang of sympathy struck him.

He quickly grabbed the old man, infusing his own Bright Yang dharma power to protect his heart. With frantic speed, he flipped open his sleeve, retrieved a small, pale red flower, and stuffed it into the old man's mouth. He glanced left and right at the deathly quiet Wilderness and whispered frantically,

"There's no one left... Go! We have to get back to the north bank, old man Qu! You can only be saved if we get back to the mountains."

He lifted Qu Bushi and, looking at the fields of bone below and in the distance, his eyes suddenly stung with unshed tears.

"What in the world were we fighting? What did they even die for? Millions of lives... did a single one of them even understand why!"

He quickly composed himself and shot forward. The powerful divine ability still lingered over the battlefield, dulling his spiritual sense and distorting his perception of distance. After flying for a while, nearing the battle's center, an immense wave of dharma power suddenly washed over him.

"Who's there!"

A chill shot through Li Zhouming's heart. He hesitated, then realized the surging dharma power glowed with a silver light. It was holding aloft a woman in feathered robes. Her dark brows were tightly locked, and a thick, bloody aura was mixing with the silver radiance erupting from her body.

"Que'Wan?"

Li Zhouming's heart clenched. But Li Que'wan's speed was astonishing. She shot past him, giving him only the briefest glance before vanishing into the oppressive darkness.

'What's happening!'

The intense radiance and spiritual wind left Li Zhouming stunned. He hesitated for a fraction of a second, but finally grit his teeth. His Bright Yang dharma power flared to life, illuminating his own spiritual light, and he turned to chase after her.

But Li Que'wan's Dao-Profundity and cultivation base were both far beyond this 'uncle' of hers. Li Zhouming flew for a long time and nearly lost her. After weaving uncertainly through the darkness, he finally spotted the glint of silver light again.

It turned out Li Que'wan had already landed on the ground, the flickering silver light making her position clear.

The short, intense burst of dharma power had left her face extremely pale and slick with cold sweat, plastering strands of dark hair to her temples. The woman paid it no mind. One hand formed a seal while the other swept her sleeve heavily across the ground.

The scattered bones were instantly cleared away. She fell to her knees and, using her dharma power, pulled a round, lumpy object from the mud. Li Zhouming finally staggered to a halt beside her. He looked down, and his pupils shrank to pinpricks.

The object was a person's head.

The man had a square face and thick eyebrows. His eyes were clamped shut, his jaw clenched so tightly that the muscles in his cheeks bulged. But the flesh of his face looked as if it had been blasted by some force, shredded and torn like tattered cotton.

The head rested on a ruin of shattered bone and flesh. The man's upper body was incomplete, lying in the sand of the riverbank with organs spilled around it. His entire lower half had been reduced to white bone, looking so brittle it might disintegrate at a touch.

Piles of talisman ash and fragments of dharma artifacts were scattered near the head. Li Zhouming felt as if he'd been struck by lightning. He collapsed to his knees beside Li Que'wan, crying out in horror:

"Zhouda!"

This was, indeed, Li Zhouda!

Li Zhouda always led the charge in battle. His cultivation and skills had grown rapidly over the years, but against a cataclysmic divine ability of this level, he had been among the most deeply affected. Even with the talismans and dharma artifacts from the clan protecting him, and despite clearly taking decisive measures to save himself when the wave hit, he was now only a moment away from death.

Li Que'wan gave two pained coughs, spitting up a mouthful of blood essence. Her hands moved, gently tapping a point on his forehead before she began stuffing a Wanling Flower into the head's mouth. She looked up at Li Zhouming, her eyes red, and said hoarsely,

"Uncle, you should go..."

Li Zhouming wanted to say more but didn't dare interrupt her rescue. He finally understood why she had rushed here. 'The divine ability's power is still lingering. Although the mist has retreated north, its power is thin, having covered such a vast area. But normal divination methods would never be able to find family members. The only way was to rush to the heart of the battlefield and use shamanic arts to calculate their location within the affected zone...'

'But no matter how thin, it's _still_ a divine ability! To use shamanic arts to bypass that power and find someone... I can't even imagine the price she must have paid!'

His heart ached with sorrow and pain.

'We never even got to have that drink to celebrate my breakthrough...'

Li Que'wan had no time to spare for him. With a wave of her sleeve, all kinds of spiritual items appeared. She began feeding them into the head's mouth without a second thought. Li Zhouda's condition was already hopeless, but if she could just keep him alive for a little longer... he could still be saved by _that_ divine ability!

Though tears of desperation streamed down her face, her decade of practice in concocting spiritual items kept her hands steady and fast. Most importantly, she possessed the one-of-a-kind, life-saving treasure: the Wanling Flower!

Li Zhouda's aura had already faded to its lowest point, but the spiritual items were tenaciously holding his life in place. As time dripped by, Li Que'wan was sweating profusely. She looked up again, her voice urgent, "Uncle... go get Elder Sun to help!"

Li Zhouming jumped up, flustered, but a brilliant light descended from above. His elder brother's back was already standing before him.

Li Zhouda's eyes snapped open. In an instant, bone and flesh sprouted from his neck. The spilled organs and mangled upper body leaped from the mud as if they had legs, reassembling themselves beneath his head. Even his original armor was reformed, coalescing from Bright Yang Heavenly Light, identical to before. The warrior sat up, turned away, and violently spat out a mouthful of black blood.

At the same time, Qu Bushi, whom Li Zhouming had been holding, miraculously regrew his lower limbs. He stabilized himself on his cloud and bowed deeply, weeping.

"My deepest thanks, Daoist Master!"

Li Que'wan stood up, a wave of relief washing over her. But her anxious expression only eased slightly. She said urgently:

"Uncle... I fear there are still others..."

Li Zhouwei nodded to her. Only then did she and Li Zhouming notice someone else standing behind Li Zhouwei, clearly just rescued as well. His face was extremely pale, but it couldn't hide his exceptional, heroic aura. It was Li Jiangxia.

Just then, the divine ability rippled. All across the riverbank, soldiers in golden armor and robes materialized, riding on beams of light. They fanned out across the land, searching everywhere. In an instant, the darkness was filled with countless brilliant lights, blazing like fires in a lightless forest.

Li Zhouwei's gaze swept over the endless fields of bone, a storm of emotion churning in his chest. 'As long as I participate, as long as the Li family deploys cultivators... Suiguan simply doesn't bother to distinguish between friend and foe. It wasn't just the Buddhist cultivators and civilians from the north who were slaughtered. Even the Li family and Azure Pond cultivators who crossed from the south bank were wounded and killed all the same...'

"Elder Brother!"

Li Zhouming nearly burst into tears, forgetting his usual formalities and calling him "Elder Brother" directly. Li Zhouwei helped Li Zhouda to his feet, then looked at Li Que'wan and praised her.

"You've done well."

After coughing up the black blood, Li Zhouda's complexion looked much better. He was a straightforward man, and his face showed little relief from surviving his ordeal. Instead, it was overflowing with deep hatred and rage. He offered his thanks and tried to kneel again.

Li Zhouwei held him up, his own brow furrowed. "It's good you were quick-witted," he said in a low voice. "You managed to preserve most of your sea of qi. I'll seal it for now to prevent your cultivation from dissipating... We'll perform the full restoration when we get home."

He lifted the three of them into the air and, in a flash, crossed the distance back to the small pavilion on the mountain peak.

Li Jiangqian had entered seclusion some days ago, so the pavilion was empty. Li Zhouwei left Li Jiangxia there to tally their numbers. "Count our casualties," he ordered in a low voice. "Do not act rashly. Just hold the south bank."

Li Jiangxia bowed and accepted the order. Li Zhouwei then took Li Que'wan all the way to the island and entered the inner formation before he finally asked,

"How are your injuries?"

Li Que'wan bowed.

"I only expended some blood and qi for the high-speed flight. The area was indeed difficult to divine, so once I reached the battlefield, I secretly used the Immortal Artifact to pinpoint his location. I did not lose much of my lifespan."

Her eyes were still red. "I just... I don't understand what kind of Pristine Water divine ability... could be this cruel!"

Li Zhouwei had already expected this. He nodded silently. "It was Suiguan," he said softly. "This matter isn't just about the Azure Pond Sect. The millions of people the Buddhist cultivators moved to Jiangbei all these years... it was all in preparation for today! It was for Wanling Heaven!"

Suiguan had revealed the location of Wanling Heaven. The vision in the Great Void had persisted for a long time and was only now beginning to fade. It was clear from Suiguan's actions that Wanling Heaven's descent was only a matter of time!

'Anhuai Heaven, Wanling Heaven... both are renowned grotto-heavens in Jiangbei. Back then, Anhuai Heaven's Metallic Essence attracted attention from all sides, even drawing out cultivators at the Purple Mansion Realm. Wanling Heaven is even more ancient and esteemed. The chaos it brings will surely be even more intense!'

Seeing him lost in thought, Li Que'wan said, deeply shaken, "So it was Daoist Master Suiguan... But the cultivators below... they only know it was an Azure Pond Pristine Water divine ability. They are all saying Daoist Master Ning used some terrifying, forbidden treasure..."

"On my way back, I saw cultivators everywhere in a state of terror. Even in the long struggle between north and south, such a cruel method has not been seen in hundreds of years!"

"Azure Pond's reputation as a demonic sect... is now likely number one in all of Jiangnan. It can never be erased... Daoist Master Qiuhu... I wonder how she will face this!"

...

_BOOM!_

Thunder cracked, and the world lit up for an instant. In the flash, one could faintly see specks of ghostly white dotting the darkness—the spectral gleam of bone.

The river along the Wilderness bank had flooded, spanning several miles to lap at the foot of the peaks. Even on the highest ground of the bank, the water was ankle-deep. Scattered figures stood in the water or hovered just above its surface, as silent as statues.

Ning Wan rode the wind and snow back, her expression already calm. She landed on the Wilderness peak, where Lin Wuning stepped forward to receive her.

This man, who had been so spirited and confident since taking power in the sect, now looked utterly lost and terrified. He bowed before her, stammering,

"Ma... Master..."

Ning Wan's gaze swept across the peak. Not a single Azure Pond cultivator dared to meet her eyes. All of them wore strange, unsettled expressions. The only exception was Li Yuanqin, who stood calmly to the side, waiting.

Suiguan had vanished with a simple, "What has this to do with me?" He disappeared as strangely as he had arrived, as if he had never been there at all, leaving her to return alone and face the terrified gazes from the riverbank.

As a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had mastered 'Serene Listen', Ning Wan never suffered from illusions. If she had this feeling, it meant Suiguan had already used some profound technique.

If it could affect her, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, then the low-level cultivators across Jiangnan would likely, slowly, forget Suiguan ever existed.

'What a method... truly, what a method. It must be some art to sever karmic ties, to escape retribution, and thereby nurture his own life-mandate!'

"What is it..."

Ning Wan masked her thoughts, gazing quietly at her disciple. Lin Wuning grew even more fearful and whispered,

"The people from Purple Smoke... and Xiukui... they suddenly withdrew. Without a single word... I'm afraid something's happened. They're say... saying..."

Ning Wan's expression cooled. "There is no need to speak with them further," she said flatly.

Lin Wuning didn't know how to reply. He followed Ning Wan into the Main Hall of radiance and waited as she took the main seat. He was about to speak again when the sound of urgent footsteps came from outside. A disciple rushed in and fell to his knees.

"Reporting, Daoist Master! Shanji Prefecture... is under siege by Daoist Masters from Profound Peak Gate! The Master of Sacred Writ Gate has vanished... We heard... we heard their sect is in total chaos, and their main lineage seems to have evacuated long ago..."

Ning Wan seemed not to hear him. Her expression was complex. "Does the Profound Mystery Realm have unusual phenomena?"

The disciple froze, then shook his head, confused.

"Not that I've heard..."

The woman finally closed her eyes, a deep weariness settling on her features. Her divine ability, 'Serene Listen', was being overwhelmed by so much malice and hatred that it had activated on its own, climbing to its absolute peak. The true feelings of everyone on the mountain flooded into her ears.

Lin Wuning kneeling in the hall; Si Tongyi standing silently in the mountain; Fei Qingyi and Qin Xian waiting in the side hall...

From her own Ning family heirs to the inner disciples of Azure Pond, from the visiting rogue cultivators to the fleeing commoners... The wails of grief, the panic of the lost, the cold laughter of observers, the bitter resentment, the burning hatred that wished to flay her skin and eat her flesh...

The roiling aura of Pristine Water had devoured more than just the millions from the north—it had also consumed Azure Pond disciples, heirs from various families, rogue cultivator attendants... even the common people of the Wilderness.

In that instant, her sight pierced straight into everyone's hearts. Vaguely, Ning Wan felt as if she were back at the Pristine Merging Owl Pool, back within that roiling, formless gale. That harsh, ugly voice echoed in her mind once more:

"When I'm dead, and you're sitting here on this Pristine Merging Owl Pool all alone, _then_ you'll know what real trouble is."

In the deep gloom, that gaunt, ghost-like face materialized, its eyes looking as if they would fall from their sockets, still staring at her.

"You are the Lord of Azure Pond! Whether you like it or not, it is no longer 'the Ning family of Azure Pond'..."

"It is—'the Azure Pond of the Ning family'!"
