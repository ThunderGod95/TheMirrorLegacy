# Chapter 1251: Pressing Concerns

The two of them settled only on the time and personnel for the handover, leaving the rest to their subordinates to arrange. Li Que'wan said little more, and after a few polite remarks, she prepared to rise and take her leave, never imagining the Daoist Master before her seemed intent on keeping her. He hesitated.

“Suyun… has been to Golden Oneness?”

Li Que'wan pondered for a moment, uncertain of his intentions, before speaking.

“Yes, I went. I requested a Dao Lineage to bring back for my cultivation.”

There was no need for further details on the matter; that single sentence made the stances of both sides clear. Lin Chensheng seemed to let out a subtle sigh of relief and asked:

“Golden Oneness possesses something called the 'Unimpeded Stone'. Did they show it to you?”

Li Que'wan was taken aback by the question and answered in a low voice:

“To have received a Dao Lineage is already more than I could ask for. I have never heard of any 'Unimpeded Stone'.”

Lin Chensheng fell silent for a moment before replying.

“My Xiukui sect has some understanding of the 'Whole Pill' Dao. In years past, only the Hengzhu and Xiukui sects had 'Whole Pill' cultivators. A senior of my tradition possessed a significant Dao inheritance and claimed this path required one to refine themselves to a state where 'Life and Death Are One, Water and Fire Are Unfeared'. He perished while attempting to harmonize water and fire to step beyond the Purple Mystery.”

He continued, hesitating slightly.

“Before his breakthrough attempt, he paid a visit to Golden Oneness, hoping to view the Spiritual Treasure. Unfortunately, he was refused. That is why I remember it so clearly.”

Li Que'wan knew that the Xiukui sect possessed an 'Un-harming Stone' of great renown. A flicker of doubt crossed her mind; she feared it was not as simple as merely remembering it well. She probed,

“I have also heard of your sect’s reputation regarding the 'Whole Pill' Dao…”

Lin Chensheng shook his head.

“You flatter me.”

It was impossible to tell if his words were laced with sarcasm. Li Que'wan didn't take the bait, and Lin Chensheng continued:

“He obtained a great deal of Dao inheritance, all of which remains within my sect. Now that Suyun has come, I cannot let you return empty-handed.”

Li Que'wan quickly tried to refuse, but his tone held an air of finality. In a flash, he retrieved a jade slip and pressed it into her hand.

“This is nothing precious. The Hengzhu Daoist tradition borrowed it for study in the past. I believe it suits your path. Even if you cannot use it yourself, it will be useful for instructing disciples or entrusting to a Guest Retainer. The Dao inheritance of Golden Oneness is surely profound, but listening to all sides brings clarity. Consulting various sources in one's cultivation is never a bad thing!”

Lin Chensheng had long ceased to consider the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass his own! With Qi Lanyan's death, the debt of gratitude and grievance had been settled. He had never thought to ask for anything in return; now, he felt he had received a favor he couldn't repay and was determined to gift her this technique.

Li Que'wan understood his sentiment and had no choice but to accept it graciously. Lin Chensheng wasn't wrong, and besides, she had Cheng Qian, who was like a Guest Retainer to her family. Such things would always find a use.

'After all, Golden Oneness's explicit stance is still to forbid the world's divine abilities from touching the 'Whole Pill' path. Even if they made an exception for me, I could hardly turn around and leak the Dao Lineage I received from them to Cheng Qian…'

She thanked him repeatedly, then stepped across the Great Void. Heading west, she took out the several jade slips and began to read them casually. After only a few glances, however, her expression slowly grew solemn.

“There is truly something to these…”

If the two scriptures, Awaiting the Supreme Divine and White Nurturing, were grand and archaic, bearing the orthodox Dao of radiance in every concise character, then these scrolls delved from the shallow to the profound, exploring every minute detail. They contained not just the Dao, but also arts!

'The quality is varied, and it's hard to judge the rest, but one of the spell arts is quite peculiar.'

This art was called the 'Sand-Pointing Curse Art'. It appeared to be a 'Whole Pill' technique tinged with the methods of an 'Upper Shaman'—a distinctly Xiukui style that allowed one to borrow the power of others!

'My own shamanic arts are too profound, often being grand Dharma Arts. While these techniques are closer to spell arts, they are deeply connected to the Upper Shaman. With the experience of my predecessors and the foundation of my own Dao-Profundity, I can progress by leaps and bounds!'

Even if this art was a tier below techniques like Emperor Qi's Light in terms of grade, it just so happened to fall squarely within Li Que'wan's specialty. A mere glance was enough for her to grasp a great deal, to say nothing of what she could achieve if she dedicated time to cultivating it!

A hidden light gleamed in the woman's eyes. Only now did she understand what Lin Chensheng meant when he said, "I believe it suits your path."

'The insight of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition is truly something else. Even if he reached the Purple Mansion Realm not long before I did, his judgment is by no means inferior!'

Soon, she arrived at Jiasuan Prefecture. Li Que'wan wasn't acquainted with Lingu Lanying, so she didn't descend to disturb her. She discreetly activated her Spiritual Treasure and waited for the time it takes for an incense stick to burn. Only then did she see a man in black robes, looking refreshed and invigorated, arrive fashionably late.

Li Que'wan glanced at him and said with a hint of helplessness:

“How did it go?”

Li Wushao's smile still held a sinister edge, but his voice was low.

“It was quite fruitful!”

A stir went through Li Que'wan's heart. Master and servant exchanged a look but said no more as they made their way toward the lake. Yet, just as they set foot upon it, they saw the small mountain ahead flash with golden light as fierce flames shot into the sky. The phenomenon pierced the heavens, as if crimson dragons and soaring phoenixes danced across the sky, a truly magnificent sight!

The light illuminated her pretty face, making it glow. The woman's eyes lit up as she rejoiced inwardly.

“What an astonishing phenomenon! Grand-Uncle must have succeeded!”

She rose upon the wind, accelerating toward the mountain. Sure enough, she heard hearty laughter echoing from within. A man in a white-gold Daoist robe stood with his hands clasped behind his back as he strode out. Li Que'wan simply smiled and moved to greet him.

“Congratulations, Grand-Uncle!”

Li Ximing looked at her with great enthusiasm, patting her shoulder twice without saying much. The old Daoist Master behind him, however, was a mess of anxiety and elation. He wanted to follow but remained rooted by the furnace, watching over it with great concern as he called out:

“Daoist Friend Zhaojing! Daoist Friend Zhaojing… th-th-this… is it… a success?”

Although Li Ximing's aura was somewhat depleted, the feeling of accomplishment from this breakthrough in his alchemy made his face radiate with joy. He looked up and smiled.

“It hasn't fully succeeded yet…”

Ji An's face fell with disappointment, but Li Ximing continued with a grin:

“But Senior can set your heart at ease! For the remaining five years, we need only nurture it and patiently await the pill's formation!”

Ji An's expression immediately brightened, and he nodded repeatedly. At his side, Liu Changdie smiled and cupped his hands in congratulations. The little old man accepted the gesture with a blush, rubbing his hands together in excitement.

“I understand! I understand!”

From the look of him, even if the armies of North Zhao were storming the mountain at that very moment, the old man would charge forth to defend the furnace without a second thought!

Li Ximing shook his head with a helpless smile. It was, after all, a chance to step beyond the Purple Mystery; losing one's composure was understandable. He turned to Liu Changdie and exclaimed in wonder:

“What divine ability is this! Truly formidable!”

He had personally experienced Liu Changdie's 'Heavenly Harmonising Fullness', so he felt its effects most deeply. He praised,

“I have been blessed by Auspicious Qi and Azure Proclaimation before, but your divine ability is completely different… While it cannot aid in the pill's formation or enhance its quality, it seems to have accelerated the refinement process!”

Liu Changdie smiled and shook his head.

“This is 'Harmonising Metal'. It once produced a figure who could hold up the heavens. This divine ability focuses on gathering essence, which is why it aligns somewhat with the Dao of alchemy. Unfortunately, it clashed with the Radiant Fire, so I couldn't be of greater help.”

“It was more than enough…”

Upon hearing the words 'Harmonising Metal', a flicker of gloom crossed Li Ximing's eyes, but he praised aloud:

“Without you, this would have taken me several more years.”

Having channeled his divine ability for so long, Liu Changdie let out a long sigh and shook his head.

“You two haven't seen each other in a long time and must have much to discuss. I will watch the furnace for you. Go on!”

Li Ximing cupped his hands in thanks and began walking toward the island on the lake, remarking with feeling:

“Time truly flies by in the blink of an eye when refining a pill. Fortunately, I have some skill. For the duration, I can nurture the pill and continue my cultivation simultaneously!”

He chuckled and added with a resigned air:

“That way, I can avoid another inquiry from King Wei…”

Li Que'wan smiled to herself, but her thoughts were still on what Li Wushao had said. She sealed the doors to the hall, turned, and fixed an inquisitive gaze upon him. The smile on the demon beast's face faded, replaced by a deep frown. He spoke in a low voice.

“Daoist Master… do you know the origin of the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique?”

Li Ximing had just poured the tea. Hearing the name of this technique, his expression shifted slightly. Li Que'wan, taking the cue, shook her head as she listened to the demon beast continue:

“Years ago, Lingu Lanying had a spirit pet I was on good terms with. In conversation, it unintentionally revealed… that her ancestor, Lingu Xia, who cultivated the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique, left behind a Hooked Serpent before she ventured out to seek the Dao…”

“Remembering that Young Master Xizhi is a Heavenly Glow cultivator, I relayed these exact words to him… He entrusted someone from the Yang family to investigate, but they found nothing, only that the art was a Dao Lineage of the Azure Pond Sect. It had a long and rich history and was obtained by an ancestor of the Chi family. The Daoist who created the technique was said to have cultivated in the area around Mount Duan…”

“So, the Yang family told Young Master Xizhi: his destiny lies on Mount Duan.”

Li Wushao's expression grew progressively darker. He lowered his voice.

“But this subordinate has pondered it for many years and feels something is amiss—in all of the vast Jiangnan, even including the north, where can a second Dao Lineage that cultivates Heavenly Glow be found?”

Li Que'wan fell silent and turned to look at her grand-uncle. Li Ximing quietly set down his teacup, saying nothing.

How could she not know? How could Li Ximing and Li Zhouwei not know? Li Xizhi had been trapped on Mount Duan in a state of semi-imprisonment by the Underworld. For all these years, it was a subject they never broached. Li Que'wan simply lowered her gaze and asked:

“What have you found out?”

Li Wushao's expression was grave.

“When that old creature saw me, it immediately addressed me as 'Old Ancestor' and dared not disobey. It told me everything about what happened to Lingu Xia back then.”

“What it said… had many discrepancies with the Yang family's account!”

“Oh?”

Li Ximing stared at him intently as Li Wushao spoke:

“The Dawn Dew Gathering Technique was indeed obtained from Mount Duan. An Azure Pond cultivator acquired it after befriending someone during his travels. This cultivator was indeed named Chi, with the given name Rui, and was a high-level cultivator. The person who gave him the technique was not anonymous; he had a surname—Xue.”

“Xue.”

Li Ximing was not surprised. He said flatly:

“That's rather normal.”

Li Wushao lowered his eyes.

“This Daoist Master Xue and Chi Rui got along splendidly, so they exchanged spell arts on Mount Duan. He gave him the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique, telling him to select a successor to promote the Heavenly Glow Dao Lineage.”

“When Lingu Xia received the technique, all of this was written clearly within. Yet, in Young Master Xizhi’s copy, there is not a single trace of it.”

Li Ximing stood up and rubbed the bridge of his nose, murmuring:

“So that's how it is… This technique must have been given to him by someone from Qingsui Peak… And the Yang family's marriage proposal, they approached us on their own initiative…”

Though he didn't elaborate, Li Que'wan understood him perfectly. Li Wushao, however, hesitated for a long moment before adding in a low voice:

“There are a few other rumors…”

As they both looked at him, Li Wushao continued:

“It is said that Daoist Master Xue left word that… any junior who attains the Dao through this art may seek him out. As for where to find him, he did not specify…”

Li Ximming remained silent for a long time, standing frozen in place.

'What is the Underworld's game… Do they fear that because of this rumor, Brother Xizhi might head north and join the Luoxia Sect, thereby influencing our family's allegiances?'

'But if that's the case, why did they go to the trouble of altering the technique and luring him, a son-in-law of the Yang family, to cultivate Heavenly Glow in the first place? Weren't they just asking for trouble?'

'And what is so special about Mount Duan that requires Brother Xizhi to remain there?'

Li Que'wan studied his expression and discreetly waved her hand, signaling for Li Wushao to withdraw. The demon beast understood her gesture and quickly excused himself. The woman waited a long while before speaking softly:

“Grand-Uncle… there are also the Dragon-kin…”

Li Ximing turned his head, his voice low.

“Yes…”

From this new perspective, he seemed to reach a new understanding.

“Yes. The eyes upon him are not just the Yang family's, but also the Dragon-kin's… Dongfang Heyun has mentioned him more than once. If he were just some minor cultivator, how could he possibly…”

Li Ximing sighed.

“Que'wan… there must be other pieces on the board concerning him. There must be some arrangement, unknown to us, upon which the Underworld, the Luoxia Sect, and the lords of the Dragon-kin can all agree…”

Li Ximing felt a sense of vertigo. He glanced at the woman with her eyes downcast and said hoarsely:

“We… we have truly walked this path in complete ignorance! It's true… in this vast world, I cannot find a single other Heavenly Glow cultivator I have ever met!”

But the woman's gaze was firm. She said in a low voice:

“Grand-Uncle! You speak of an arrangement they all agree on. This matter involves the shadow of Heavenly Glow, the hand of the Yang family, and the attention of the Dragon-kin… This junior has an immature thought. From beginning to end, there is only one thing that could make those three parties reach a consensus.”

Li Ximing turned his head slightly as Li Que'wan's haunting voice continued:

“The death of the Wei Emperor.”

“It does not concern whether the King Wei succeeds, only that the Wei Emperor dies.”

Her usual gentle demeanor vanished, replaced by a resolute determination in her eyes. She gritted her teeth.

“This has been the true stance of all three parties from the very beginning…”

Li Ximing paced around the hall with his hands behind his back, a deep anxiety etched between his brows. He spoke in a low, somber tone.

“Do they need to be so meticulous, so cautious? It is said that the Luoxia Sect and the Underworld have Immortals, and the Converging Water Dragon King was the final victor of the bloody struggle between the nine sons. Li Qianyuan… a cultivator at the peak of the Golden Core realm, should be a figure they can handle at will. Yet it requires the three powers to join forces and take such precautions!”

“Just what kind of person is He!”

He shook his head, bewildered.

“I don't understand… and it's fitting that I don't. You returned from Golden Oneness, and your words about Tianhuo… it seems the figure behind Golden Oneness is no longer an ordinary Golden Core cultivator. And yet, He is widely rumored to be merely in the early stages of the Golden Core realm…”

Li Que'wan said in a solemn voice:

“I'm afraid that matters of Fruition Attainment and Immortals are not for cultivators like us to comprehend.”

Li Ximing shook his head, but the woman stood up and said seriously:

“I will not disturb you further, Great-granduncle… King Wei emerged from seclusion a few days ago with many instructions. He said the great war is imminent, and with only five years remaining, Que'wan's divine abilities and cultivation have yet to reach perfection…”

Li Ximing started slightly, then understood in an instant. His expression grew grave as he watched her step into the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, riding the light back to her mountain peak. He thought to himself:

'Five years… that will be enough!'
