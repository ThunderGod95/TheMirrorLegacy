# Chapter 952: A Joyful Occasion

The jade bottle stood quietly on the table, its three vertical lines glowing faintly. A vaporous white energy formed pale halos of light. Li Zhouwei gazed at it, his heart stirring, and slowly stepped forward.

But that single step caused the jade bottle on the table to tremble. The white energy, as if agitated, converged at the bottle's mouth. In an instant, it transformed into a swirling, continuous beam of white light. It rose slowly, then shot toward him like a comet!

Li Zhouwei's pupils dilated. He instinctively wanted to leap away but managed to suppress the urge, forcing himself to stay still.

He felt a roiling eruption within his Shengyang Acupoint. The divine ability and dharma power on either side parted like a receding tide. A speck of white light emerged from the center. It flickered, as if drawn by some unseen force, and swiftly descended through his twelve-fold tower, dropping into his Sea of Qi.

The dharma power in his Sea of Qi also parted. His Sovereign's Perilous Tread released waves of dark-gold light, rising like the morning sun breaking through clouds, reaching up to receive it!

The scattered white energy swirled around the Sovereign's Perilous Tread, rapidly condensing into a brilliant white light about a finger's width. It looked like a tiny talisman, and it drifted down to adhere to the dark-golden radiance.

If this had happened before, Li Zhouwei would have hesitated, needing time to think. But he had just received the Illuminating Sun and Moon. How could he not recognize this?

'Talisman Qi?!'

Li Zhouwei's mind was still somewhat blank, his heart pounding.

'There’s more Talisman Qi?! The second immortal foundation gets it too?!'

In that brief instant, he first bowed deeply. He silently moved away from the main seat of honor, turned, and exited the room. Only then did he manage to calm his racing heart.

He turned his spiritual sense inward, slowly inspecting his Sea of Qi.

Within the Sea of Qi, the Sovereign's Perilous Tread immortal foundation was pulsing with light. But as his spiritual sense sank into it, this Talisman Qi did not respond, nor did it transmit any of its profound marvels or transformations.

He analyzed it for a long moment before understanding gradually dawned, and joy began to blossom within him.

This talisman was different from those received during sacrificial rites. It didn't seem to resonate with his personal life-mandate. It merely submerged itself into the immortal foundation, exerting the inherent function of Talisman Qi: to drive his divine ability and dharma power, and to continuously resonate with the foundation beneath it, nourishing and interfacing with his dharma power.

'The most significant effect... is that it increases the speed at which the immortal foundation is perfected! And it can temper my dharma power day and night, without rest!'

Based on Li Zhouwei's brief perception, its operational speed seemed much slower than his own cultivation, but this was still an extraordinary boon.

A typical Purple Mansion Realm cultivator took five to ten years to perfect an immortal foundation. Li Zhouwei's own speed was faster, and with the boost from Sovereign's Perilous Tread itself, he had originally estimated it would take about three years. Including the time to _form_ the foundation, he could attempt to condense a divine ability every five years. This was already half the time of a normal cultivator, who would take ten years or more.

Of course, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator raising an immortal foundation into a divine ability rarely succeeded on the first try. Three to five attempts were not uncommon... meaning it would still take over a decade to form a second divine ability. And _that_ was considered extremely fast within the Purple Mansion Realm.

This was why Li Ximing hadn't been in a rush to cultivate for the past two or three years. In the grand scale of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's life, this period was very short, and he was still far from forming a divine ability.

But now, if he (Li Zhouwei) were to stop cultivating entirely to focus on studying spell arts, the immortal foundation would still be catalyzed by the Talisman Qi and slowly perfect itself. He estimated it would take only five or six years. If he also entered seclusion to cultivate, the speed would be even faster—perhaps less than two years!

In the time it took others for a single attempt, he had enough time to account for three failures. Although the Purple Mansion Realm became harder to cultivate in the later stages, the time saved by this automatic cultivation was a tangible, solid boost to his cultivation base and Dharma Arts. 'After all, not everyone can achieve lightning-fast breakthroughs through self-cultivation. Not everyone is Chi Buzi or Daoist Master Zimu!'

'Whether it's the Murong family, the Touba family, or even the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition, they all have their own methods to help achieve a divine ability. They might save some time or even increase the success rate. But compared to the tyrannical efficacy of my family's Talisman Qi, their methods are probably on the level of Mount Luoxia, the Underworld, or the Dragon-kin!'

'I wonder if this catalytic speed is related to my own cultivation speed, or to the difficulty of cultivating the immortal foundation or the divine ability itself...'

He ran the calculations, feeling a thrill of excitement. He opened his eyes and hurried downstairs.

Li Ximing was in seclusion below, his aura calm and steady. Li Zhouwei didn't want to disturb him, but he knocked lightly on the door. Instantly, golden light flowed out like water.

Li Ximing saw his urgency and paused, stunned.

"Did the northerners break through to the lake?"

Li Zhouwei laughed. "No," he said, ushering him upstairs and explaining the situation in detail.

"It's possible that by entering this place, obtaining the immortal ascension method, and forming a second immortal foundation, one can then receive Talisman Qi from the bottle... But I don't know the exact conditions. It might require breaking through in this top-floor attic, right in front of this treasure..."

"I didn't dare delay. I see that Uncle-Grandfather is also cultivating a Dao foundation. Even if you can't form one every five years, one every ten years would be magnificent. This opportunity cannot be missed, so I came down to get you!"

Li Ximing was dumbfounded. He mulled over the words for a long time before saying with a hint of regret:

"Then I truly miscalculated! I should have cultivated this immortal foundation much earlier. Then I wouldn't be sitting here envying Tinglan's Traversal Token!"

Li Zhouwei smiled.

"It's even better if you have it. You can accelerate your cultivation while practicing your Dharma Arts at the same time... What is Uncle-Grandfather's cultivation level now?"

Regret was one thing, but Li Ximing's eyes were now filled with hope and anticipation. The second divine ability, once impossibly distant, suddenly seemed much closer. He shook his head.

"It's only been about half a year. Naturally, I can't compare to you. But a single Purple Mansion spirit pill has a tremendous effect, and it's still not fully refined in my Sea of Qi... I estimate it will take less than a year."

"I was preoccupied with cultivating the Great Radiance of White Brilliance. I wasn't expecting to form a divine ability on the first try anyway. This is even better. I'll just hurry up and condense this immortal foundation, then I can just wait."

Li Zhouwei nodded repeatedly, his mood much improved. He touched his waist, revealing a jade talisman that was glowing with a warm, clear light. It was a report from the Li family's direct lineage outside. Since it hadn't shattered, it wasn't urgent and didn't require him to exit seclusion.

He smiled, a light flashing in his eyes, and cupped his hands.

"I shouldn't stay here too long, lest others get restless. Now that I've completed my cultivation, I'll go out and take a look. Who knows, there might be good news."

He dissolved into light and vanished. When he opened his eyes again, he was inside the Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda. Under his feet, arcs of silver lightning rippled like water.

As soon as he exited the main hall, his golden eyes flashed. His spiritual sense swept out in all directions. A small smile touched his lips, and he walked quickly, soon appearing in a side hall within the inner array.

The hall door was slightly ajar, revealing the faint flickering light of Dharma Arts. A delicate-featured young boy was sitting at a desk, meticulously studying a wooden slip spread open in the center, which was covered in elegant, inked characters.

The child had rather pale skin and refined features. He was so young that his appearance was almost androgynous. Though he had yet to mature, one could already see the handsome figure he would one day become.

Li Zhouwei pushed the door open and entered. The boy immediately looked up, covered the wooden slip, and scrambled somewhat awkwardly off the high chair, his voice still childish.

"Chun'er pays respects to the Daoist Master!"

Li Zhouwei had never met him. 'The boy has no spiritual sense, so he shouldn't be able to gauge my cultivation. He's a clever one.' He strode closer, his golden eyes narrowing with a smile.

"You recognize me?"

Though Li Jiangchun was young, his etiquette was perfect. He bowed.

"Mother often taught me that those with golden eyes are of the Daoist Master's bloodline. I have met my older brothers. If I meet one I don't recognize, even if his robes are different from the ones in the painting, he must be the Daoist Master."

Li Zhouwei's Yuan'e Soft Armor had been sent to Qize. He was wearing simple white robes for a change, making him harder to recognize. He smiled and sat down beside the child.

"What cultivation method did you obtain?"

Li Jiangchun simply shook his head. "I do not know what the Daoist Master is speaking of."

Li Zhouwei paused for a moment, then let out a short laugh and shook his head. A faint golden light shimmered behind him as he began asking the boy about his birth date and his hobbies. He had only asked a few questions when he heard hurried footsteps outside. Li Jiangqian, clad in crimson robes, pushed open the door, bowed in the courtyard, and said respectfully:

"Congratulations on exiting seclusion, Father!"

Li Zhouwei nodded, his smiling gaze still fixed on the child. Li Jiangchun hopped down from the chair again and bowed.

"Big Brother said the secret must not be told to anyone. Once spoken, the listener will die, and the speaker will also die... I have heard the Daoist Master has many transformations. This junior has offended you, senior."

"Hahaha!"

`Li Jiangqian` was a calculating one. 'He must have been afraid the child wouldn't understand the gravity, so he resorted to threats.' Li Zhouwei had no intention of correcting him. He laughed with obvious amusement, his good mood apparent. Turning to Li Jiangqian, he gestured to the kneeling boy.

"Pang Yunqing is truly worthy of her famous family. She has taught him very well."

Li Jiangqian had only heard that last part, but he understood the situation completely. He retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve, stepped forward, and presented it with both hands.

"Reporting to Father. We obtained a [Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record] and the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra... The first is an extremely profound Dharma Art! The second... it cannot be transcribed..."

"Oh?"

A flash of understanding crossed Li Zhouwei's pupils. He accepted the slip and glanced at it, a sound of admiration escaping him.

"What a fine set of spell arts!"

Although Lesser Yin didn't conflict with Bright Yang, he himself would certainly never cultivate this kind of Dharma Art. Li Zhouwei merely scanned it before handing it back with a smile.

"When you return this time, fetch the Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity for him to read."

The more he looked at Li Jiangchun, the wider his smile became. He took the boy's hand.

"The Lesser Yin path is rare in our family, and rare in all of Jiangnan, but its power is far from small. Since you obtained this today, you must cultivate it diligently."

Li Jiangchun respectfully agreed. When he looked up again, his golden-eyed... 'uncle' had vanished. He committed the words to memory. He followed his brother out, passing through layer after layer of arrays, until he finally saw his father.

Zhouluo looked nervous. He was sitting in a side seat in the vast hall, restlessly rubbing the hilt of his sword. When he saw the two emerge, he looked up, his expression a mix of joy and apprehension.

"How did it go?"

Li Jiangqian had taken the boy on the pretext of visiting the two Daoist Masters to request a Daoist method. But Zhouluo, recognizing the critical timing, seemed to recall something.

As a core member of the direct lineage, he knew that all children visited the hall at age six. He understood it was a family procedure. He had undergone similar treatment himself, though he only vaguely remembered kneeling before _something_. He had likely been passed over, his own opportunity missed. The thought made him anxious as he inwardly speculated:

'It isn't just about testing talent or bestowing a method. Other than Que'Wan, whom the senior selected personally all those years ago, perhaps all the other children must go through this step: paying respects to the ancestors' Dharma swords to appeal for a wisp of spirituality.'

He was lost in thought when he saw Li Jiangqian smile.

"Congratulations... congratulations!"

Zhouluo jolted, his eyes wide with shock and joy. Li Jiangqian shot him a meaningful look. Zhouluo beamed.

"I'll go pick out a sword manual for our little brother right now!"

...

Li Zhouwei took a single step and reappeared above the shimmering surface of the lake, his light descending onto the Viewing Pavilion Platform. The red-robed old man was stroking his beard as he tended the fire. Li Jiangzong was beside him, bent at the waist, listening to the old man's explanations with rapt attention.

Li Jiangzong cultivated True Fire and was being trained as the Li family's next-generation artifact refiner. He had clearly not been idle these past days. He had a good reputation in the clan, and he was exceptionally polite toward Chu Minglian, humbly seeking his guidance.

This was a common sight, which was why Li Zhouwei was able to take it in at a glance. As he landed on the platform, everyone bowed. Li Jiangzong came forward to greet him, his face full of joy.

"Not bad!"

Li Zhouwei offered a word of praise. Chu Minglian also hurried to turn and bow respectfully.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

"Progress has been quick."

Li Zhouwei glanced around and saw that all twelve positions on the platform were now filled. Among them were several green-robed cultivators he didn't recognize. He instantly understood. As expected, Chu Minglian explained:

"Ever since Daoist Master Ning came here, she heard the Daoist Master was perfecting a spirit embryo and sent several people over to help. The Grand Ascension is already in the nourishment stage. It's just a hair's breadth from completion. I must ask you to take a look, Daoist Master!"

The Viewing the Pavilion's Divine Ability, Forged in Fire could accommodate up to twelve Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators assisting at once. The Li family hadn't had that kind of manpower, so they had been rotating six people. Ning Wan had plenty of cultivators under her command, so she had sent help.

'If I hadn't come out of seclusion three or five days early, it would have been finished anyway. Now, it just needs the final push.'

After speaking, Chu Minglian hesitated for a moment before adding in a low voice:

"This humble one also discovered something that must be reported... The treasure accepts the fire and the refinement process with remarkable ease. Its internal patterns are clear and flow naturally... This humble one suspects... suspects this item has a significant history."

He was clearly uncertain and didn't dare say more. Li Zhouwei, however, reacted instantly. He raised an eyebrow.

"Is it a spirit embryo from an ancient cultivator that has degenerated over time?"

Chu Minglian kept his voice low.

"It is highly likely..."

Li Zhouwei nodded slightly. The Grand Ascension had been recovered from the Green Pine Grotto-Heaven. The speculation was reasonable. Perhaps it had originally been a spirit embryo locked onto the platform by some secret art. It might have degraded due to the long passage of time or some change in the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment.

As they spoke, his Bright Yang divine ability surged along the lines of light, gradually dyeing the spirit embryo suspended above the platform with color. The divine ability and dharma power within his body depleted rapidly.

"Omm!"

As he poured his dharma power into it, the final stage of the refining process was completed. The Viewing Pavilion Platform erupted in dazzling golden light. The long halberd shrank into a single point of gold and drifted gently into his palm.

The gold expanded from his palm, revealing the deep-golden halberd. The long tines at its end curved like a crescent moon, large enough to almost obscure Chu Minglian's entire upper body.

The haft of the halberd extended down to the platform, its round, blunt golden tail striking the dais with a crisp sound. At once, respectful congratulations echoed from all sides.

Grand Ascension!

This dharma artifact had come from the Green Pine Temple Grotto-Heaven. Its fundamental quality was extremely high, placing it at the very top tier of spirit embryos. Even before, it could augment him with its bright light. The halberd could also project a glaring sunlight to affect his enemies. Now that it was fully refined, its marvels manifested one by one.

The first was [Attachment].

This marvel had clearly evolved from its former light-augmentation ability. When he wielded the weapon, the light of the Bright Yang would augment it, condensing a phantasmal halberd of light over the physical weapon. This phantom could engage in Splitting Light to defend against an opponent.

The original light-projection ability had also ascended to a new level. After being refined by his divine ability and nourished by spiritual essence, the glaring sunlight from the halberd now concentrated into a single beam, forming the [Luminous Grasp] marvel, which was nurtured within the halberd's core.

It was still a projection, but this marvel was quite different. Each time it was used, it would release a [Luminous Grasp White Light]. This bright light was tangible. If it missed its target, it would not dissipate; instead, it would follow the movements of the weapon.

Much like many Bright Yang Spiritual Artifacts, the number of [Luminous Grasp White Lights] was linked to the owner's divine ability. The more Bright Yang divine abilities he mastered, the more [Luminous Grasp White Lights] he could release at once.

'It really does favor the strong and scorn the weak.'

Li Zhouwei was nonetheless deeply satisfied. In his current situation, just having a suitable weapon was a massive improvement, to say nothing of one with two exceptionally useful marvels.

With a light flick of his finger, the Grand Ascension transformed into a streak of golden light and vanished into his palm. He soared into the air, and in an instant, he arrived at the northern shore.

Snow was drifting down over the banks. The sky above was a chaotic maelstrom of light and clashing colors. Waves of divine ability power rolled out relentlessly—a fierce battle was clearly underway. The falling snow stopped abruptly at the river's edge. On the far side, roiling demonic smoke gathered, encircling a lone figure. Li Zhouwei needed only a single glance to recognize the face.

'Helian Wumeng.'
