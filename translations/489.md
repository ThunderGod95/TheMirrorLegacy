# Chapter 727: Chenghui

Heaven and earth reflected within the mirror.

The world was shrouded in gloom. Moon-white buildings lined up in neat rows, nestled among the rocky terrain. These jade-like palaces were mostly curved and gleaming, with massive stone beasts crouching along the cliffs. All of it appeared silver-white under the moonlight.

Lu Jiangxian sat quietly before the jade table, a faint azure glow emerging in front of him.

The moment Chi Buzi appeared on Zongquan Island, Lu Jiangxian was jolted awake. The contingency he had left within Chi Buzi’s soul quickly transmitted everything back. Various scenes of the Eastern Sea flickered through his pupils.

Two seconds later, Lu Jiangxian once again sat properly at the jade table.

Chi Buzi.

Back then, Lu Jiangxian implanted a hidden trick in Chi Buzi’s soul. It was partly to steal memories and partly to suppress him. Now, having obtained the Immortal Official’s memories, he immediately sensed something was wrong.

If memories were transmitted back... then the contingency within the soul must still be active.

Lu Jiangxian frowned and reviewed the memories. Sure enough, over the years, Chi Buzi had engaged in a battle of wits with the Immortal Official from the Water Mansion, wandering all across the Four Seas in search of traces of the so-called Immortal Court.

Those memories had been hastily fabricated by Lu Jiangxian to explain the Immortal Official’s origins. How could they match reality? After circling the Four Seas, both man and soul realized something was amiss.

Yet, this realm’s Daoist traditions resembled those of their previous life while differing in many ways. Various Dao Seed techniques had real foundations. After a brief quarrel, the split soul had to admit that the Immortal Court had indeed collapsed and vanished during some ancient immortal-devil war.

The Immortal Official’s soul was originally a fragment of Maha Jinlian Maha, a being of strange and demonic origin. Upon realizing the Immortal Court was gone, it immediately developed wicked intentions and sought to seize Chi Buzi’s body and live again.

The two battled endlessly. One was a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, an old devil from Azure Pond Sect. The other fancied himself a man of the righteous path, yet was equally cunning. They schemed against each other for over a decade.

In the end, Chi Buzi succeeded in assimilating the talisman qi, and the Immortal Official was devoured. Yet the radiance in Lu Jiangxian’s hand clearly confirmed that the Immortal Official had, over the years, mastered the soul arts of this path and might still be hiding somewhere deep in Chi Buzi’s soul.

That restriction within Chi Buzi’s soul still shimmered faintly. Despite their bitter battle of cunning and betrayal, neither Chi Buzi nor the Immortal Official had touched that seal. It was as if they had a mutual, unspoken agreement.

Lu Jiangxian sat silently upon the jade throne for a while. He was no longer the same man he once was. In his heart, he speculated, Chi Buzi might very well know the Immortal Official isn’t dead. Perhaps he doesn’t dare kill someone connected to me... deliberately handing over leverage to make me think he’s under control.

As for joining forces against Pristine Water...

Lu Jiangxian naturally had no impulse to confront Pristine Water now. The more he understood this world, the more cautious he became. All he wanted was to focus on restoring the mirror, why would he provoke Pristine Water?

I can’t even step out of the mirror, how could I possibly drag him down from his Fruition Attainment? thought Lu Jiangxian.

Those figures were still fighting beyond the Outer Heavens. His true body was hidden in the great void and he could faintly sense its tremors. If he revealed even the slightest trace, he feared he’d be immediately perceived.

Shangyuan has ascended to become a True Monarch...

Lu Jiangxian set aside the numerous techniques and spell arts in those memories for now. He stirred his divine senses and indeed found that the various Shamanic Talisman Dao arts he’d previously developed had all changed. There was an added ingredient of Jade True Essence Catalyst that made them quite different.

He sat quietly before the stone table, calculating inwardly, Over the past century, I’ve come to gradually understand this world. Not only the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, but even many Golden Core Realm cultivators are now familiar to me...

In Yue State, there’s Azure Pond Sect’s Pristine Water, Golden Feather Sect’s Taiyuan, and Yue Cultivating Sect’s Taiyue. That makes three True Monarchs. Wu State is similar in size to Yue, and I only know about Changhuai’s Taiyi. There are probably two or three there as well. So Jiangnan should have around six True Monarchs.

The Eastern Sea has two dragon kin. I've heard Valley Water is among them. The Northern Sea reportedly has two, and the Southern Sea is about the same size as the East. Altogether, the Four Seas should have about nine.

And then there are the Wang and Xie Families, Mount Luoxia, the Underworld... there’s quite a number overall.

By his calculations, the Immortal Dao alone had ten True Monarchs, clearly dominant. No wonder the Northern Buddhists had kept their heads down all this time...

And as for ancient True Monarchs, there must be even more of them!

From the Immortal Official’s memories, Lu Jiangxian had gathered much information. What he desired most, however, was to trace his own origins. For it was very possible that he had a previous life, and had been the lord of the Moonlight Origin Mansion.

After reviewing everything, he still felt that the identity of Yingze was the most likely.

First, his mirror was a treasure of moonlight origin. It was said the Moonlight Origin Mansion possessed the Sun-Moon Profound Light, possibly formed from both the Supreme Yin Profound Light and Supreme Yang Profound Light. It was a perfect match for Yingze, which symbolized both yin and yang.

Second, Yingze belonged to Green Pine Temple, and the Sun Seeker Ring bore the inscription Green Pine Temple Lu Jiangxian. This was another match.

But most importantly, Green Pine Temple’s grotto heaven reflected itself above and below, wasn’t that exactly like a mirror? And that grotto heaven had been forged by Yingze.

With these three clues aligning, Yingze seemed the most likely identity.

The Golden Feather Sect’s Taiyuan called Yingze ‘senior,’ so Yingze must have been at least a True Monarch, possibly even a Dao Embryo...

But things weren’t so easily concluded. Two matters still left him uncertain, he thought, The Lord of Moonlight Origin Mansion was said to be an Immortal Lord, Yingze might fall short of that. And Li Jiangqun has seen me, which means I was still active in the more recent ancient times, while Yingze seems to have perished long ago.

So he could only list Yingze as a suspect for now. He continued thinking, In any case, at least five True Monarchs are lying in wait for this Yingze. Mount Luoxia has a Dao Embryo and so does the Underworld. Exposure must be avoided at all costs.

He hadn’t even considered Chi Buzi’s suggestion as he only found the man troublesome. With a sigh, he muttered, “At the very least, Pristine Water is in a bad spot, he’s bound to suffer injuries this time and will have no energy to manage those beneath him.”

He conjured those memories into form, and soon a collection of ancient texts that were all stored within azure jade slips appeared before him.

Chi Buzi had been cautious, only allowing him to see the Foundation Establishment Realm chapters of Azure Pond Sect techniques... but Pristine Water’s five Daos were all complete.

He specially selected these five paths, which were Dark Floating Compliant Cloud Sutra, Lucid Marsh Profound Cave Sutra, Ugly Sunflower Water-Seeking Method, Clear Serenity Dusk Sutra, and Dew Tribulation Falling Petal Art.

These corresponded to Pristine Water’s five techniques, Heavy Murk, Spring’s Echo, Sunflower Concealment, Clear Dusk Rain, and Purging Dew.

Lu Jiangxian set them aside for now. Naturally, he wouldn't allow the Li Family to cultivate these techniques. They would serve only as references for his own spell art and the study materials related to the Pristine Water Origin Talisman Essence.

After all, the path of Pristine Water was closely tied to talismans. In Jiangnan, talismans were easily refined, perhaps this connection would offer some inspiration, thought Lu Jiangxian.

Lu Jiangxian didn’t examine the rest of Azure Pond Sect’s techniques in detail. He just glanced through several spell arts that all bore distinct characteristics of Azure Pond’s methods and footwork techniques.

After a full review, he stumbled upon something interesting.

It was an old biographical text that Chi Buzi had specifically found, hoping the split soul might recognize someone within it.

The book was quite peculiar. The author’s surname was Chen, Chen Xuanxiang. Lu Jiangxian brought it forth, transforming it into a small book he held in his hands.

“On the 21st day of the 11th month in the year before winter, in the early days after the chaos settled, I was betrothed young to a Li lady. I returned with my mother to Ning State and gained the service of two retainers, Xiao and Quan... I traveled south and roamed all across Jiangnan.”

This man had lived long ago, nearly a thousand years prior, during the flourishing era of the Yuan Family, when the Dongli Sect still existed. Remarkably, the text recorded news of the Six Sons of Chongming:

“Taiyue, Taiyi, and Taiyu shone brightly in the lead. Taixu, Taizhu, and Taiqing rose in their wake. The Dao lineage of Green Pine glowed brilliantly in the near-ancient era...”

Lu Jiangxian studied it closely, matching each name one by one. A strange feeling welled up in his heart, So that means... These were all disciples of Yingze...? One sect with four Golden Cores Realm cultivators? Maybe even six...

Doubt lingered in his heart, and he mused silently, “Just what kind of Dao lineage... was Green Pine Temple?”

———

Zongquan Island.

Li Qinghong waited a while inside the cave dwelling, but no response came. Even Chi Buzi's presence had vanished. The spring within the cave, once murky, had returned to clarity, and the tinkling sound of flowing water had disappeared.

She exhaled softly in the cave and did not dare to think too much. Turning back, she exited the residence. All was utterly still. Zongquan Island was cloaked in night, the formation intact, without a single disturbance or ripple of alarm.

Just outside was the ritual platform of the Profound Thunderpool. Li Chenghui was seated upright upon it in cultivation, barely three meters from the cave entrance. He had sensed nothing, not even the sound of knocking had reached his ears.

Li Qinghong stepped lightly outside. The starlit sky above was bright and serene. After enduring the falling of the sea, the dragon swallowing the purple pearl and the arrival of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, even someone as resolute as she no longer had the heart to cultivate.

She had barely stepped out when Li Chenghui, nearby, was instantly roused. He rose steadily and said in a deep voice, “Aunt, the matter the family asked us to investigate some years ago, we’ve finally found a lead.”

Li Qinghong immediately understood and asked, “Is it regarding the Bright Yang treasure?”

She had received a letter from Li Xijun, instructing her to keep an eye out for several Bright Yang treasures in the Eastern Sea to assist Li Ximing’s breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm. Despite her efforts to investigate, there had been no results. Now reminded, she thought in her heart, A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could take our lives as easily as reaching into a sack. Ximing is already at the late-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. How many secret techniques has he mastered, and what are his chances?

But Li Chenghui had uncovered something else and simply said, “There’s a Dao lineage in the Scarlet Pristine Sea that cultivates Bright Yang. It’s located in a remote area to the east, and we’ve now found its exact location. We might pay them a visit, perhaps it will yield something.”

Li Qinghong asked for more details, and Li Chenghui presented a jade slip. Within, everything was meticulously recorded. Even the estimated truthfulness of the gathered information and how the retreating sea might alter the terrain for easier identification were recorded down.

He also offered a detailed report on recent changes to the island such as how much land had been revealed as the sea receded, how it was managed and how it was fairly distributed between the incoming family members and the native residents. Everything was orderly and transparent.

Li Qinghong read through it, and the worry in her brows eased slightly. She spoke gently, “Good child... among the Radiant Lure generation, only Chengliao, Minggong, and you have proven yourselves. Chengliao is now the family head, and Minggong is gradually taking hold of family affairs. Only you remain here with me, at the far edge of the sea... it’s been hard on you.

“Your elder brother... he didn’t send you here out of disregard. The family simply had no one else suitable. Please try to understand.”

Li Chenghui shook his head. He had always been silent and unambitious, diligently handling family matters with order and fairness. He never spoke of right or wrong. It was rare for him to speak in a deep tone, “Whether by reason or sentiment, even considering the heir, eldest brother is the family head. I know my own abilities well. Managing this small island is more than enough for me.”

He added quietly, “The three of us cultivated together since childhood, yet our cultivation cannot compare to our elders. We are far from it. Whenever this is discussed, I feel uneasy and unworthy. Things as they are now... are good. I am content.”

What Li Chenghui said could be called the shared burden of the entire Radiant Lure generation. From eldest Li Chengliao to youngest Li Chenghuai, they simply could not match the former generation.

No matter how hard these sons worked in cultivation, they found themselves far behind the records left by their fathers and grandfathers. No effort seemed enough. And then came Li Zhouwei, rising like the morning sun which made all others seem dim in comparison.

These children were sincere and clever. They looked at one another and felt unworthy of their place on the Qingdu rolls. This eventually led to the Radiant Lure generation’s voice within the family growing faint. Most did not dare not speak up at all.

Li Qinghong understood all this. Li Xijun had written to her several times on the matter. Nowadays, it was increasingly difficult to bestow talisman seeds, which meant one could not receive the formal initiations. The younger generation already lacked talent, without these two supports, how could they possibly catch up?

As for the heir Li Zhouwei, Li Qinghong naturally held great hopes. But she had seen too much in her life. What was highly anticipated often fails, and what was done without expectation often succeeds. Back when she left Li Chenghui to cultivate the thunder arts, she had her own reasons.
𝚏𝐫𝚎𝗲𝕨𝐞𝐛𝕟𝚘𝐯𝚎𝗹.𝕔𝐨𝗺

She simply encouraged him by saying, “I’ve prepared various pills for you. Now, with water falling and thunder rising, cultivation progresses quickly. It’s the perfect time to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. To speak frankly, you’re the only one in Radiant Lure who still has a real chance.

“Work hard on the island. The mainland shifts constantly, and a Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough is a remote hope. Success means joining the immortal families. Failure... if something changes in the family and we’re no longer here, someone must remain at Foundation Establishment Realm to steady things. Whether retreating overseas or gathering remnants... at the very least, you must reach Foundation Establishment Realm.”

After Qinghong had spoken to such an extent, Li Chenghui was startled. He stared at her blankly for a moment, then understood. He bowed deeply and said solemnly, “I, Chenghui, will keep this firmly in heart and dare not slacken.”

Li Qinghong nodded, then soared into the sky on lightning, speeding off in the direction marked on the jade slip. Li Chenghui stood quietly for a moment.

Li Chenghui had once been content. As one of the top Qingdu scholars in the family, governing a small island was effortless for him. He had simply wished to manage it well and await reassignment from the family.

But Li Qinghong had seemingly seen through his heart. Her words stirred something in him. Though his eyes remained lowered, there was now a subtle gleam within them. He sat back down in meditation, restraining the surge in his chest as he faintly resonated with the thunderclouds above.

If the family falls into turmoil, then I shall be the contingency. I will bear a spear and ride thunder into the fray.
