# Chapter 670: A Plea for Some Respite

'Dingjiao really puts on a show…'

The entire street beside Li Zhouwei was now cast in shadow. A crowd of cultivators scattered in all directions, fleeing beyond the grand array. In an instant, the area was empty. Bai Rong muttered, "This Dragon Prince..."

The surroundings were in an uproar as people fled. The two mortal children from before had long since vanished. Before Bai Rong could finish his sentence, a silver-white bolt of lightning leaped out from the marketplace. It danced across the ocean a few times before flying toward the Azurewater Scaled-Beast, and a man's resonant, powerful voice called out:

"Miao Ye of Thunder Island pays his respects to the Dragon Prince of the Clear Seas and Serene Pools, Inheritor of the Azure!"

Li Zhouwei had met this man before. He had come to Moongaze Lake years ago demanding the Duruo Spear. His strength was considerable, and after some private inquiries about his ancestors, Li Zhouwei learned he was now stationed in the Southern Sea.

Miao Ye placed his hands on his knees and knelt in the water. He withdrew his hands, went down on one knee, and bowed three times in succession, his gaze lowered, too terrified to speak.

Li Zhouwei activated his ocular art, his vision exceptionally sharp. He could see that the one cracking a whip atop the Azurewater Scaled-Beast was a demon general with bulging gills and black armor. His expression was foul. He flicked the long whip and barked, "This has nothing to do with you! Get to the side and wait!"

Miao Ye looked as if a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He stepped aside and stood by, ordering someone to bring up a meal of blood-food. The black-armored demon general shouted them away, saying impatiently, "The Dragon Monarch's birthday is approaching! No blood is to be seen in the Eastern Sea. Take that foul stuff away. If the master sees it, there's no telling what trouble you'll be in!"

The Dragon Monarch's birthday was still half a month away. How could Miao Ye not know this? Why else would he have brought up blood-food? It was clear the other party was just looking for a reason to berate him. He bowed and scraped, thanking the general for the reminder, and waited respectfully to the side.

Miao Ye repeatedly apologized. Bai Rong and Li Zhouwei watched as they made their way out of the marketplace. The fox sneered. The area around them was now completely empty; all the cultivators had cleared out.

Li Zhouwei exited the water barrier and looked around. The surrounding waters were murky. The vast, yellowish-green seabed had once been covered in coral and seagrass, with glowing yellow spiritual items nestled beneath. Now, it was nothing but turbid sand and stone, likely swept away by a violent squall.

"The Miao Family only harvests these things once every few decades, and now they're all gone..."

The dragon race was known for its domineering nature, but there was no need to humiliate the Miao Family so thoroughly. Li Zhouwei found it a bit puzzling. Bai Rong looked at him with a smile and whispered, "Thunder Island once obtained a treasure that the dragon race valued greatly. Both the Black Dragon and White Dragon lineages sent people to trade for it. After much deliberation, the Miao Family gave it to the envoy of the Black Dragon lineage..."

Bai Rong looked a little gleeful, relishing their misfortune. "They had to offend one side or the other, and the White Dragon lineage was thoroughly disgusted. Naturally, Dingjiao wouldn't have a good attitude on his way here. Miao Ye knows this full well and is terrified of giving him any excuse. He's completely stressed out."

Li Zhouwei finally understood. He asked, "What kind of treasure was it? The dragon race is the master of the Eastern Sea's riches. What could possibly make them compete for it?"

"Radiant Profound Origin!"

As soon as Bai Rong said the name, Li Zhouwei understood. "So it was for the sake of dragon heirs."

The Radiant Profound Origin was just an ordinary Purple Mansion Realm spiritual item, nothing special to the dragon race. However, it happened to have the effect of aiding childbirth, which made it incredibly valuable.

The two of them had now arrived before the Azurewater Scaled-Beast. Miao Ye still stood with his head bowed, not daring to move. He might have recognized Li Zhouwei, but the respectful expression on his face didn't waver in the slightest, and his aura remained calm.

'He's a man of deep cunning.'

Li Zhouwei noted him with a glance. The black-armored demon general approached with a smiling face, put away his whip, and said, "My lords, this way please..."

Bai Rong walked swiftly into the hall with him. Behind them, everything instantly dissolved into infinite, swirling waves of azure and blue, churning into a maelstrom. It was clear the Azurewater Scaled-Beast was on the move. Li Zhouwei steadied himself and heard a clear, bright laugh.

"Fellow Daoists!"

Standing in the center of the hall was a youth with white horns. His robes were embroidered with waves and flood dragons, and his light blue eyes looked over with a smile. He took a step forward in his golden boots, and Dingjiao announced in a clear voice, "Dingjiao, White Flood Dragon of the Clear Seas and Serene Pools, Inheritor of the Azure, greets you, fellow Daoist."

This greeting was clearly directed at Bai Rong. The fox flicked his pale green and white sleeves, and his voice, light and melodious, adopted a tone completely different from before as he replied, "Bai Rong, the Plain-Hearted Fox of Moongaze Lake, pays respects to the Crown Prince."

"Excellent..." Dingjiao laughed heartily, appearing to be in high spirits. He invited the two to be seated, then feigned surprise and said, "So, Bai Rong is a Plain-Hearted Fox, with a bloodline so close to the Lord of Mount Dali! I have been neglectful. Had I known your identity, fellow Daoist, I should have come out of the hall to welcome you. The fault is mine."

"Your Highness jests."

Bai Rong, with his slender eyes and handsome features, sat holding his wine cup. His tone was soft and graceful, his smile perfectly composed—a stark contrast to his usual playful demeanor. He said tactfully, "I was fortunate to receive the grace of the Mountain Lord's blood pool, which tempered my very nature and allowed me to be reborn. I am unworthy of such ceremony."

Dingjiao looked as if he had just realized something. He nodded and clapped his hands lightly. "Then your fortune is profound indeed," he said softly.

The two exchanged a few more cordial words before Dingjiao turned his attention back to Li Zhouwei, his expression growing serious. "Minghuang, I was in the wrong last time for neglecting you. Now that this matter has come to fruition, I am deeply grateful and will not forget it."

What Li Zhouwei wanted was a favor from the dragon race, not their spiritual artifacts. That spiritual ring of the Bright Yang path was certainly powerful, but it wasn't something he could use. He shook his head and said, "Your Highness is too kind. It was all thanks to Senior Bai Rong's assistance. I cannot take the credit."

The three of them chatted for a while. Bai Rong revealed a side of himself completely unlike before, demonstrating great social grace. He told a few eloquent stories, lavishing praise on Dongfang Heyun several times. Dingjiao listened with a smile, and both host and guests were pleased.

The Azurewater Scaled-Beast moved with incredible speed. Time passed as Li Zhouwei listened to the other two converse. Finally, he felt a slight tremor, and a demon general with long whiskers came forward to report, "Reporting to my lords, we have arrived at the Grave Abyss."

Dingjiao rose and began to walk, guiding the two of them as he spoke softly, "Minghuang, you may not be familiar with this place. Let me explain. We are south of the Southern Sea, in a place called the Grave Abyss."

The group flew up from the scaled beast. Before them lay a vast, empty expanse of sand. Stone islands of various sizes were scattered in a radial pattern around a colossal abyss in the center. Gazing into the distance, they couldn't see the other side of the chasm.

The islands on both sides of the abyss were fractured and broken, some as large as cities, others as small as houses, stretching out as far as the eye could see. Seawater flowed into the great chasm through a spiderweb of fine channels, and below was infinite darkness.

Dingjiao gazed into the depths and said quietly, "Before the great celestial shift, this place was a continent as vast as Jiangnan, but sparsely populated. While Jiangnan had a hundred million people back then, this place had no more than ten million."

"During the celestial shift... two Immortal Lords fought here, shattering the entire continent. The spiritual qi vanished, and to this day, no living creatures can survive here. My dragon race calls it the 'Grave Abyss'... it is the counterpart to the 'World's Navel' in the Eastern Sea."

Bai Rong nodded. It seemed to be his first time here as well. He looked around with great interest and said softly, "I've heard that because there is no spiritual qi here, the Great Void does not exist. Even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators must descend and fly normally..."

"Correct." Dingjiao said softly, "This place extends all the way to the Netherworld, where the Underworld is located. It is said that the officials of the Underworld use this as an entrance and exit."

As he spoke, he descended silently. The three of them were quickly swallowed by the infinite darkness. Li Zhouwei watched the seawater cascading down on both sides, frowned, and murmured, "This Grave Abyss is terrifyingly vast. How has the water of the Southern Sea not been drained dry? It's hundreds of times larger than the celestial hole in the Northern Sea. Even if the entire Southern Sea rained down, it wouldn't be enough to fill it..."

"Could it be like the corner of the sea, where the water falls into the depths and immediately returns to the ocean as water veins?"

Dingjiao shook his head and explained, "The seawater doesn't fall into the Grave Abyss from all directions. This area is just one inlet. If you were to fly south for a while, you'd find the ground is higher than the sea level, and no water is falling."

Li Zhouwei nodded in understanding and added a word of caution, "There's no spiritual qi here. We'll be in trouble if we run out of dharma power..."

"Don't worry." Dingjiao took out some white pearls from his sleeve, considered them for a moment, then put them back. Instead, he produced a black, disc-shaped spiritual artifact. It instantly grew larger, forming a platform beneath their feet. He said apologetically, "My personal mount, Chengyun, is ill-suited for travel within the abyss."

Bai Rong nodded, then asked with some doubt, "But this tale about this abyss leading to the Netherworld... I've never heard it before. After all, we are not familiar with the affairs of the sea. Could Your Highness elaborate?"

He offered a brief apology for his ignorance. Dingjiao waved his hand dismissively and said in a low voice, "This story dates back to the era of the Qi State. The Northern Qi replaced the Wei. The former Wei Crown Prince, Li Xunquan, raised an army and for a time controlled the Long region, which people then called Long Wei. A certain lord from my family was living in Wei at the time and became close friends with someone there. They got along very well."

"Later, a great drought struck the south. The lord went personally to bring rain. When he returned, he found his friend had been murdered. So he traveled all the way here, descended deep into the abyss, flew all the way into the Netherworld, met with a judge of the Underworld, and brought the person back."

Li Zhouwei was stunned at first, then his heart pounded with excitement. He asked in a heavy voice, "So when a person dies, their soul is truly taken to the Underworld, just like in the legends? And they can be brought back?!"

But Dingjiao hesitated. He said quietly, "When a mortal dies, their soul undoubtedly scatters. But I've heard that everyone in the world is registered on the Underworld's lists. If one practices the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, the Underworld even knows their cultivation level and techniques. As for capturing souls... that sort of thing shouldn't happen anymore."

"But..." The fierce hope that had surged in Li Zhouwei's heart was instantly extinguished. He lowered his head, a question unspoken.

Dingjiao replied, "I've inquired about this as well. I heard it was because that person was born before the celestial shift and also practiced the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao... so the Underworld arrested him according to their laws. For those born after the celestial shift, unless they fail when attempting to form a Golden Core, the Underworld doesn't get involved."

Seeing Li Zhouwei's distress, Bai Rong changed the subject. He secretly recalled something and asked softly, "What if an immortal cultivator is not on their list?"

"Not on the list?" Dingjiao glanced at him, shook his head, and smiled. "That would mean they practice the Dao of Shamanic Talismans, or the method of nourishing one's nature by consuming qi!"

The white fox lowered his head thoughtfully. Li Zhouwei, however, was only disappointed for a moment before he composed himself and asked in a low voice, "I have heard the name Li Xunquan. There were constant uprisings in the north back then, and many gained significant traction. There were two attempts by the Wei's Li family to restore their kingdom. Later, there was also a Li Xuan... I just don't know what happened to him afterward."

The Li family had gathered a great deal of information over the years and paid special attention to such matters, but it was impossible to find out more in Jiangnan. It was a rare opportunity to hear about it in the Eastern Sea.

Bai Rong glanced at Dingjiao and said softly, "He was killed by the Qi Emperor. His head was hung over the city of Dianyang and wasn't taken down for nine years."

Dingjiao fell silent. The spiritual artifact beneath their feet bobbed gently. Li Zhouwei's breath caught, his expression darkened, and he stared into the endless blackness.

'What is Dingjiao really trying to do...'

Throughout the journey, Li Zhouwei had come to appreciate Dingjiao's status. This Crown Prince of the White Dragon lineage was likely one of the most distinguished figures in the world.

'The Eastern Sea is vast, and the dragon race commands many Purple Mansion Realm demon beasts. If he truly needed something, couldn't the dragons send a great demon of the Purple Mansion Realm to help him?'

'Leaving aside others, Dongfang Heyun alone is strange enough...'

'Bai Rong is a Foundation Establishment fox demon, and his cultivation method isn't specialized in hearing. Perhaps his bloodline or a few special techniques give him keen senses, but could he really compare to a Purple Mansion expert with their divine abilities?'

'Judging from the attitudes of the two demons... this matter was jointly arranged by the fox and dragon races... What in the world is it, and why did they have to bring me along...'

'Bai Rong said Dingjiao wanted to befriend me... is that why he brought me here? Is there some benefit for me in this...'

He pondered this for a while. They sat in silence for several days. Both Dingjiao and Bai Rong had stopped speaking. Dingjiao was completely quiet, while Bai Rong's expression was intensely focused, his ears twitching slightly.

He slowly stood up, listening for a moment. White fur began to sprout from his skin, and with a shake of his body, he transformed into a pure white fox, without a single blemish.

The fox's two ears stood erect. Surprisingly, a third ear was situated between its brows, triangular in shape with the tip pointing upwards. Viewed from the side, it resembled a white horn, fluffy and exquisitely formed.

Having revealed his true form, Bai Rong crouched on the disc as they continued deeper. Dingjiao remained motionless, watching them quietly. The spiritual artifact flew slower and slower, until it finally came to a stop.

Dingjiao said softly, "There is a sound here. Bai Rong, listen closely. The dharma power in my artifact is running low. If you can't hear it here, we will have to go deeper."

Li Zhouwei couldn't hear a thing; he found the silence around them terrifying. Bai Rong paused, then shook his head. "Please, let's fly a little further."

Silently, Dingjiao urged the artifact forward. They flew for a full half-hour through the pitch-black surroundings, devoid of any light, as if trapped in an endless, oppressive void, before stopping again.

Bai Rong twitched his ears and frowned. "It's a man's voice..."

The fox listened for another quarter of an hour, then said in a low voice, "He's saying..."

Bai Rong seemed uncertain, his expression tense. He lay down again to listen more carefully, then looked stunned. He whispered, "The... chains... burning... hot, beg... something..."

Li Zhouwei's heart tightened upon hearing this. Dingjiao frowned, his voice low and deep as he asked, "Did he say anything else?"

Bai Rong listened again for a while. Dharma power circulated through his body, and a purple glow mixed with mist swirled around him. The white fur on his ears turned a deep violet, strand by strand. After a quarter of an hour, he said quietly, "Nothing else. Just that one sentence."

His expression was one of shock. He paused before continuing, "His voice is at times as high as a tiger's roar, heart-rending, mixed with the sound of coughing up blood. At other times, it's as sharp as a mouse's squeak, piercing enough to shatter stone. It's utterly terrifying."

"He is saying..."

"The Dharma chains are scorching hot, and bind too tightly. I beg for some relief."

Dingjiao's eyebrows shot up, his expression a mixture of cold fury and shock. He was silent for a moment, then took a jade bottle from his sleeve, placed it in his palm, and said in a low voice, "Plain-Hearted Fox, keep listening."
