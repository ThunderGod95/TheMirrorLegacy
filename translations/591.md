# Chapter 922: Seizing The Prize

Guo Hongyao had only been gone for fifteen minutes, yet Guo Hongkang was already growing anxious where he stood. His once-settled mood turned uneasy. He flew northward for a kilometer or two but, fearing schemes or ambushes, dared not go farther.

"Perhaps Li Xijun has someone backing him. Guo Hongyao might act fierce against Li Xijun alone, but if she runs into that thunder cultivator Li Qinghong, she’s no match at all..." muttered Guo Hongkang.

He figured Guo Hongyao’s life shouldn’t be in danger. Although Guo Shentong had vanished for years and the east and west sides of Crimson Reef were now allies in name only, Guo Hongyao’s branch was still one of direct descendance. She should still carry plenty of life-saving treasures.

"I’ll wait a little longer... If there’s no word from her after an hour, she’s probably used some talisman to escape. I’m carrying something too important to just stand here."

Guo Hongkang waited quietly, one hand on his magic sword. He closed his eyes while his other hand lit up with red light, two fingers pressed on the Shenyang Mansion point between his brows. Using a spell, he extended his spiritual sense to its limit, yet he still couldn't sense anything.

He had no choice but to give up and open his eyes. In the hazy distance, he saw a reddish-gray glow. It was clearly the hue of Merging Fire. Alarmed, he quickly clutched the talisman Guo Hongjian had given him, thinking, She already used a talisman after just fifteen minutes? Li Xijun is only at the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. His sword aura barely counts as strong, not overwhelming. Either he’s hiding his strength, or he has help.

Guo Hongkang immediately made a decision and began retreating silently. His original plan to wait an hour was instantly abandoned as he muttered, "I’ll give her fifteen more minutes!"

Guo Hongkang was one of the top talents among the collateral branches. He secretly cultivated many techniques and had a bright future. But even so, he didn’t dare offend Guo Hongyao, afraid this woman might go mad.

"If not for that, I wouldn’t care whether she lived or died!"

He waited anxiously for a few seconds until he finally spotted a streak of light flying toward him from the distance, swaying unsteadily. Its mana aura was so dim it was hard to discern, but it was faintly tinged with white mist.

"Hm?"

Guo Hongkang’s eyes narrowed as he looked closely. The figure collapsed headfirst onto the shore. Her protective mana completely dissipated, revealing a pale and delicate face. Who else could it be but Guo Hongyao?

Her flame token lay dim and stuck in the ground beside her. She was covered in blood, and her dharma robe was dulled, stained in a blend of gray-red and crimson. It was rather garish against the island backdrop.

Serves her right! Guo Hongkang felt a surge of satisfaction. He immediately connected her condition to the distant gray-red glow and chuckled inwardly, The fool must’ve suffered terribly. She used up all her hidden talismans just to stop the guy... If I hadn’t been here when she fled, she wouldn’t even have her life left!

He drifted on the wind toward her, still curious, I wonder what that white light was... maybe some top-grade escape treasure’s light trail.

Guo Hongkang slowly descended. On the island shore, Guo Hongyao had already swallowed several pills, her complexion visibly recovering. Guo Hongkang approached a few steps closer and saw a coldly gleaming sword lying under her robes, still stained with blood.

Realizing she had slain Li Xijun, he sighed and offered his congratulations, "Congratulations, my lady, on slaying your foe."

The Guo Hongyao before him appeared gravely injured, struggling to breathe, and gasped, "Come here!"

Startled by her shout, Guo Hongkang shivered and quickly stepped forward. He saw her clutching her waist, struggling to rise. Her delicate hand lifted the sword that gleamed like snow, and her face twisted in pain as she barked, "Take it already!"

Though inwardly scornful, Guo Hongkang maintained a respectful expression and quickly reached out to grab the sword’s sheath. But it sank heavily into his hand, and he looked up, puzzled.

It turned out Guo Hongyao hadn’t let go of the hilt. Her graceful hand held the sword as if she had drawn it countless times before. Her pale fingers were defined and elegant, even beautiful.

At that moment, Guo Hongkang’s gaze moved past her hand to land on Guo Hongyao’s face. Her expression was icy as frost, and her eyes brimmed with killing intent.

Guo Hongyao had always been beautiful, but the usual look of petulance and impulsive discontent was now gone. In its place was an untouchable solemnity, like standing amidst a snowstorm.

The chilling and imperious stillness made her look less like Guo Hongyao and more like that snow-clad Daoist Master Tianwan.

Clang!

Guo Hongkang was less than a meter away from Li Xijun, who had transformed into Guo Hongyao. He was holding Han Lin’s scabbard in his hand when all he saw was a flash of snowy white. A chilling light rose from his throat.

The moment Li Xijun drew his sword, Han Lin slashed clean through Guo Hongkang’s throat, severing his head in one swift strike. Snowflakes scattered like a storm.

Li Xijun didn’t know what relationship the two had, but he knew Guo Hongyao was irrational. A show of agony covered everything better than polite behavior; any inconsistencies in attitude would be excused under the pain she’d endured.

As expected, Guo Hongkang suspected nothing and followed Guo Hongyao to the grave. He was also decapitated by Li Xijun in one strike.

"You—!"

But Guo Hongkang was not Guo Hongyao. Shock barely flickered through his pupils before he acted, not to save himself, block the blow, nor retreat, but to activate the talisman in his hand.

Boom!

A blinding gray-red light burst out. The potent Merging Fire in his palm turned pure black. It was like a massive stone dropped into a lake as it splashed fire in all directions. The seawater around the island was instantly drawn away, and Merging Fire swirled wildly, creating a vast, hollow crater over the sea.

The Merging Fire talisman exploded right next to the two of them, engulfing both in an instant. Li Xijun’s body was flung backward, trailing a long streak of gray flame. Guo Hongkang’s head, already severed by Li Xijun, was blasted away by the Merging Fire.

Body and head flew in different directions. His eyes glowed red as his head spun midair, still muttering faintly. However, his body halted midair amidst the firelight. It calmly formed seals with his fingers to control the wind and deflect Merging Fire. Its robes billowed as it turned to chase after the head.

Guo Hongkang’s decision was unquestionably wise. The instant use of the talisman showed his composure and caution in crisis. Had he not kept it ready in hand, how would he have disrupted Li Xijun now?

Though his head was already gone, only few could take action in that moment of overwhelming fear. Yet he had triggered the talisman without hesitation. Had he hesitated by even a second, he would’ve followed Guo Hongyao and become another soul slain under Li Xijun’s sword.

Li Xijun swallowed blood and skidded to a halt in midair. Frosty mana burst from his Qihai acupoints to resist the Merging Fire clinging to him, but the flames still danced across his body. His vision was shrouded in gray haze; he could barely see.

"My eyes... they’re injured..."

The only way he could have taken such a powerful talisman blast at close range and only suffer injuries to his eyes and face was due to Guo Hongyao’s dharma robe. Though he hadn’t refined it, it was of the Merging Fire and could resist flames to some degree, allowing his body to rise with the fire rather than be incinerated.

His spiritual sense was still usable. Li Xijun spat out a mouthful of blood, letting the blood mist ignite and vanish into flame. Frost flared beneath his feet as he reversed his longsword and flicked out three streaks of sword light.

Guo Hongkang was the one who cast the spell and also cultivated Merging Fire, so by any measure, his injuries were lighter than Li Xijun’s. He had already retrieved his head, but the sword essence coating his neck was like a heavy frost, making it nearly impossible to reattach.

"Sword Essence! Li Xijun!"

Frightened, he fumbled for his pills, only to see three pale sword lights already drifting his way. Li Xijun had reverted to his original appearance, his eyes burned to ashen gray and red-gray Merging Fire still flickering over his body.

In that brief moment, Guo Hongkang understood that he needed time to heal the wound on his neck, and Li Xijun needed time to expel the notoriously sinister and difficult Merging Fire from his body. One of them had to die within the next dozen or so exchanges.

"Guo Hongyao... how is that possible?! It hasn’t even been fifteen minutes since she left, and she still died to him when she had to fly part of the way?!"

At this point, he already regarded Li Xijun’s swordsmanship as equivalent to that of a direct descendant from a sword sect. One hand released several talismans to defend, while the other summoned Merging Fire to form two beams of gray light as he cast a spell and shouted, "Strike!"

The two beams of gray light instantly shot across the sea at high speed. They didn’t even bother to intercept the sword light, they simply slammed straight into Li Xijun, erupting into clusters of gray fire around him.

Li Xijun showed no fear. A band of color flared from his sleeve as the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, which he had held back earlier to avoid exposing his identity, lit up beside him. The mysterious golden light of the screen enveloped him and firmly blocked the gray fire.

Crimson Reef Island did not belong to the Jiangnan Dao lineage, and none of the seven of Chongming Hall practiced the Merging Fire Dao. So the paintings on the screen didn’t activate, but the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, as an ancient-technique dharma artifact, was more than enough to block this spell.

On the other side, Li Xijun’s sword light likewise didn’t bother cutting through the flames, it simply headed straight for Guo Hongkang. The three agile, cunning sword streaks danced as they struck, shattering his protective shield.

"Thank goodness!"

Guo Hongkang watched the sword light in fear. The distance between him and Li Xijun wasn’t great, and since he believed this was the sword cultivator who killed Guo Hongyao in just a few moves, he thought he’d be sliced clean through. But now he exhaled in relief, even feeling a touch of delight as he thought, It must be the pain from the Merging Fire causing his sword technique to be off!

Such things weren’t rare, and the situation was all too familiar for Merging Fire cultivators like him. Once Merging Fire latched onto someone, it damaged treasures and harmed life itself. The longer it lingered, the deadlier it became. The pain was beyond what ordinary people could bear.

Now I’ve got a chance, thought Guo Hongkang.

Since his spell couldn’t stop his opponent, and as Li Xijun drew closer, Guo Hongkang, who had been preparing for a while, finally summoned a flying needle from his acupoint. It was gray-black, about a finger long, and unadorned, yet Guo Hongkang was overjoyed as he and shouted, "Go!"

Li Xijun had already drawn very close when he suddenly felt a stabbing pain in his Shenyang Mansion. His face twisted with both pain and cold. With a single thought, the azure light on the screen beside him flickered, casting a sheet of dark blue radiance around him.

Heavy Abyssal Gale!

The Heavy Abyssal Gale technique of the Chongming Profound Insight Screen was a suppression art, specifically meant to neutralize flying swords and dharma lights. It immediately seized the black needle in midair and slowly ground it to a halt. Although Li Xijun had blocked the needle, he still coughed up blood.

Pfft!

Even though the black needle had not struck him, it had still agitated the Merging Fire inside his body. The assault from within and without threw his insides into chaos. Forcing himself to stay conscious, Li Xijun activated Radiant Snow Pine Ridge, clearing pain and distraction from his mind. The blade in his hand lit up inch by inch as he advanced several steps.

"Damn it!" muttered Guo Hongkang.

When he saw the sword cultivator approach once more, rendering his treasured dharma artifact useless, Guo Hongkang panicked. The fire in his hand blazed, yet now he noticed that the sky was filled with heavy snow. Feather-like sword qi fell upon him, each like a blade piercing through his body, forcing a wretched scream from his throat.

Autumn Moon’s Harmonious Echo!

All Guo Hongkang felt was a shattering sound by his ears. The three streaks of sword qi vanished, while cold surged through his Shenyang Mansion. He had no Foundation Establishment Realm dharma robe to protect him, so his body was instantly reduced to minced flesh, dissolving midair into a rain of fire.

The black jade box tumbled downward, but Li Xijun seized it in midair. Merging Fire still throbbed painfully in his chest. He tucked the box into his robes and rode the wind, fleeing swiftly into the distance.

Though the Merging Fire was still active and he couldn’t use his perception arts for the moment, he had already made a sound deduction, This place is too close to Xifeng Island. Someone will surely come looking! I must leave immediately!

————

Profound Peak Gate.

Clouds swirled and music echoed on Yuexi Peak, the main summit of Profound Peak. The Daoist Master in the central seat wore plain robes, his white hair glistening like jade as it hung down.

He raised his brows and looked to the side, smiling, "Fellow Daoist Junjian?"

A black-clothed man sat at the guest seat nearby, brow slightly furrowed, with a trace of iciness in his elegant expression. He only looked up at the clouds atop the peak, and when the Daoist Master addressed him, he replied, "I certainly don’t have any Bright Yang spirit items..."

He nudged the white jade cup before him, raised his brows to glance at the senior Daoist Master Changxi, and said softly, "Changxiao was busy earlier cleaning up Chengyan’s mess... so he was severely restricted on all sides. He won’t act recklessly now. Although Yushui lacks a Life Divine Ability, both Daoist Masters Hengxing and Kuangyu have taken action... The two of them used Life Divine Abilities to shield everything, Changxiao won’t be able to divine it. This move can no longer be reversed."

Tu Longjian gently shook his head and replied, "The junior doesn’t seem so simple. Changxiao is a master of manipulating fate; it’s still too early to draw conclusions."

The young man raised his brows slightly, then turned to look at Changxi and said, "All of you seem happy to let things unfold this way. Crimson Reef Island also wants the Six Ding Merging Fire Token in my possession. Even Daoist Master Xiao has gone to the Northern Sea. Everyone keeps passing the matter around, until it’s forced to my doorstep, leaving me no choice but to go against Crimson Reef Island."

Daoist Master Changxi, with his head full of radiant white hair, spoke gently, "That’s how it is. Even if you don’t want to choose a side, they’ll force you to. If you wish to remain blameless, you must walk alone."

Tu Longjian stood, gazing calmly at the elder before him, and spoke softly, "Thank you for your guidance, senior. But this time, Crimson Reef Island made the first move. Either Tianwan did it intentionally, or her divine powers were lacking. Either way, reason is not on their side. I have no reason not to intervene."

You’re only willing to go because they’re in the wrong! Otherwise why would they have sent Guo Hongyao in the first place?

Daoist Master Changxi gave him a long, deep look and sighed. "The Li Family are clever people. Their deep push into the Eastern Sea may well rely on your favor. In this chaotic world, even cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm who wield divine powers will end up like Dong Hua if they act solely out of emotion and righteousness."

Tu Longjian laughed heartily as he played with an exquisite and charming small golden hammer that was no larger than a palm. As the great void opened before him, he stepped in, leaving only one sentence behind, "As long as my conscience is clear, that’s enough."
