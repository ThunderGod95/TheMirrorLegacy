# Chapter 704: A Double Blessing

Ding Weizeng finally processed what had happened. He bowed low, a gesture as grand as a toppling mountain of jade. The Divine Ability had even healed his throat, allowing him to speak for the first time in ages, though his voice was raspy. "Weizeng thanks you, Daoist Master," he croaked. "I will never forget this gift of a new life."

Li Ximing shook his head with a gentle smile. "Your wounds are grave and not yet fully healed. My Bright Yang Divine Ability is not primarily for healing, though it has the power to foster life. Your Qihai acupoint is one of the Three Mansions—not something I can mend with a mere word. For now, I have only sealed the damage to prevent it from worsening."

Li Ximing's own body was formed of pure Bright Yang; he could remake it at will. Ding Weizeng, however, was a different matter. A damaged Qihai acupoint could not heal on its own. It would require a rare treasure, like an Earth-Gazing Bloodstone or the Primal Essence of Heaven Unity. The latter was a form of Purple Mansion Spirit Water, which the Li clan did not possess. They did, however, have half an Earth-Gazing Bloodstone remaining.

But Li Ximing had no intention of using it. 'His Qihai is only damaged, not shattered,' he thought. 'Using the Earth-Gazing Bloodstone would be a waste. All we need is a Purple Mansion cultivator skilled in healing. A brief application of their Divine Ability would suffice. The stone is too precious for this.'

The Li clan did not cultivate with blood qi, making the stone's other properties all the more valuable. Li Ximing treasured it. "I have my own methods for dealing with your Qihai," he said aloud. "As for your eyes, though I have regenerated them, they have not yet been nourished by your immortal foundation. It will take time for you to refine them and restore your sight fully."

"My gratitude, senior," Ding Weizeng said, his voice low and solemn as he bowed again. Freed from his bonds, his true stature was apparent. He was far larger than an ordinary man, with broad shoulders, a powerful waist, and a fierce, bearded visage. He looked like a crouching tiger.

Li Zhouwei watched, immensely pleased. He felt the weight of the White Shadow Golden Clasps in his sleeve and stepped forward to help the man up. "I remember you from the battle on Baijiang Creek," he said warmly. "Fu Dou was trying to kill me, and you fought my clan uncle so fiercely you nearly gained the upper hand. You made an impression. It seems we got to know each other through conflict. Your Palace-Yang Tiger foundation is truly impressive. My Uncle Chenghui will be thrilled when he hears of this."

Ding Weizeng, a ruggedly handsome man, had believed his life as a cultivator was over. He never imagined the Li clan would save him. Now, understanding the turn his fate had taken, he knew what to say. "Greetings, Clan Head," he said, bowing. "In the past, I served a different master. I failed to recognize you and gave much offense. Please forgive me."

Nearby, Qu Bushi, who had befriended him during their captivity, grew anxious. 'This boy,' he thought, 'Floating Cloud Cave is destroyed, and he's still talking about a 'former master.' He's too dignified to grovel or curse his old loyalties. A true son of Jiangbei...'

Li Zhouwei simply helped him up again. Li Ximing observed this with a nod. "Weizeng, go to Gardenia Scenery Mountain and wait there for now."

With his hands clasped behind his back, Li Ximing flicked his sleeve and vanished. But Li Zhouwei was more elated than anyone. He took Ding Weizeng by the arm, led him to the hall's entrance, and said in a low voice, "Worry not, Weizeng. Once you have recovered, we will need you to stand guard over the Baijiang Creek territory in Jiangbei."

The Baijiang Creek territory was home to more than just the Floating Cloud Cave! Ding Weizeng froze, the shock contained within his gaze, not once betraying itself on his face. Li Zhouwei saw this and knew the man possessed a deep composure. A wide smile spread across his face.

Ding Weizeng merely said in a measured tone, "Thank you, Clan Head. I only worry I might offend the Daoist Master on the mountain. Are there any rules or customs I should be aware of?"

"Our Daoist Master is an amiable man," Li Zhouwei replied. "Just be at ease."

Li Zhouwei gestured for a guard to escort Ding Weizeng away. Qu Bushi watched with hopeful eyes. The old man was no fighter, but he was an expert in surveying earth veins and nurturing spirit fields. Li Zhouwei didn't yet know his character well enough to keep him on the main island. "The former territory of the Floating Cloud Cave is in disarray," he said. "My clan uncle has already returned there. Elder Qu, you know their spirit fields well. Please go and lend him your assistance."

Qu Bushi was as cunning as they come. The moment he heard this, he dropped to his knees with a thud. "I have lived a wretched life," he wailed. "Even at the Floating Cloud Cave, I was a weakling anyone could push around. To be valued by an Immortal Clan and given such responsibility… from this day forward, I will follow only the Daoist Master and the Clan Head! I swear I will never have a disloyal thought!"

Li Zhouwei dismissed him, feeling a sense of relief. The old woman, Jiang Huzi, was still standing by. Her aura was pure, and her age was considerable, so Li Zhouwei addressed her respectfully. "Senior, what are your plans?"

Jiang Huzi coughed. "I do not have many years left," she answered. "I only hope to find a small mountain among the families on the eastern shore, settle down, and live out my days making talismans for a modest living."

Li Zhouwei nodded but wasn't about to let such a resource go. "Senior, an art as profound as yours cannot simply be allowed to vanish," he said with a smile. "Have you considered passing on your knowledge and establishing a lineage?"

His words made Jiang Huzi hesitate. She considered it for several long moments before finally nodding. "Since you are willing," Li Zhouwei continued, "I will find cultivators with an aptitude for the Dao of Talismans from the families around the lake. You may screen them, Senior, and take eight or ten disciples. From them, you can choose the most outstanding to inherit your legacy."

Jiang Huzi placidly agreed. Li Zhouwei allowed her to depart on her own, and after the Wen brothers, Yi and Shan, gave their thanks and left, only the Qi Refinement cultivators remained. There was little to discuss. Li Zhouwei picked out a few whose auras seemed relatively clean and sent them to work under Qu Bushi. The rest were led away to the dungeons.

With the hall finally empty, Li Zhouwei let out a long breath. He turned to Li Minggong. "Aunt, we know nothing of that Jiang Huzi's origins. We must watch her closely."

"I understand," Li Minggong nodded. She had gained the most from the Dharma Assembly. The Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier she had acquired from the Golden Feather Sect was a remarkable treasure, and her power had risen significantly. Li Zhouwei pondered for a moment before continuing.

"Though the cultivation of the Wen brothers is unremarkable, we still don't know their true history. They must be observed carefully in the mountains on the western shore..."

With Li Ximing's breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm, the Li family had ascended to the rank of an Immortal Clan. They could now openly recruit Foundation Establishment experts as retainers, and men like Qu Bushi and Ding Weizeng would hardly dare harbor disloyal thoughts. The clan's shortage of manpower had been alleviated overnight.

"Aunt—" Before he could finish his thought, both he and Li Minggong looked up in astonishment, their gazes fixed on the sky outside the hall.

In the very next instant, Li Zhouwei transformed into a streak of brilliant light and shot into the air. Across the lake, every Foundation Establishment and late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator looked up, their eyes turning west.

There, on the western horizon, clouds churned in a great vortex at the edge of twilight. From its center, a pillar of milky-white light erupted, piercing the heavens and bathing the west in its glow.

Li Minggong was a moment behind him, stepping into the air. She studied the phenomenon for a breath before speaking in surprise. "Someone at the Purple Mansion Realm just failed their breakthrough to the Golden Core."

"Indeed," Li Zhouwei affirmed, his gaze distant. "It's coming from the direction of Mount Changhuai."

As the sun began to rise in the east, a subtle shift occurred. The world seemed to clarify, as if a heavy, oppressive weight had been lifted from it. Distant sights grew sharper, and the spiritual qi in the morning mist felt fresh and sweet.

Li Minggong looked up, feeling the spiritual qi within her stir and flow more freely. Li Zhouwei's golden eyes glinted with surprise. "The spiritual aura of the entire Jiangnan region... it's changed..."

For over thirty years, the spiritual qi of Jiangnan had been dominated by the Upper Evil Spirit Storage. This atmosphere favored the cultivation of Earth Virtue, demonic arts, Mansion Water paths, and blood qi, while actively suppressing the ancient immortal daos. This had little negative impact on the Li clan; the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao was not considered an ancient path, and their recent absorption of blood qi had, if anything, accelerated their progress.

Feeling the clear spiritual energy of the world rising around him, Li Zhouwei looked at Li Minggong. "The spiritual era has only been in place for thirty-odd years. By all rights, it should be at its zenith. For it to shift now..."

Li Zhouwei nodded grimly. "The death of that Mount Changhuai cultivator is no ordinary event. We must consult the Daoist Master."

He dispatched a messenger to Gardenia Scenery Mountain and landed in the courtyard with Li Minggong. He was about to speak when his brow furrowed again. His golden pupils dilated, his expression turning sharp. The mark of the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light between his brows began to glow faintly as he fixed his gaze on the entrance to the hall.

An instant later, the radiant Grand Ascension Halberd materialized in his grip. "Who's there?!" he demanded, his voice like ice.

Li Minggong hadn't sensed a thing. A half-beat behind, she summoned her own flames. Lacking an ocular art, she took a half-step back, shrouding herself in fire as a precaution.

A flicker of grey light pulsed, and a wisp of black energy coalesced at the entrance to the hall, forming the figure of a man. He had a high brow, grey-black eyes, and a faint smile. He looked utterly unremarkable in his simple brown robes, a sword hanging at his waist.

As his form solidified, he quickly waved a placating hand. "It has been many years," he said with a chuckle. "Your mastery of the Radiant Splendor arts has grown truly formidable!"

"Little brother!" Li Minggong cried out, her face breaking into a joyful smile. She dismissed her flames and rushed forward. "It's you! You've finished your seclusion! But why was there no celestial phenomenon?"

The man was none other than Li Chenghuai.

Li Zhouwei's tense expression melted away, and the Grand Ascension Halberd vanished. He offered a respectful salute. Li Chenghuai, looking vibrant and full of energy, laughed. "Elder Sister, have you forgotten? I cultivate the Shamanic Talisman's foundation, *Untraceable Presence*. It conceals my form, hides my aura—spiritual sense cannot find me, and the naked eye overlooks me. One would need a divining talisman to even sense my presence. What phenomenon could there possibly be?"

He paused for a moment, studying their faces. "From the look of you both, it seems the clan's situation has stabilized?"

Li Chenghuai had entered seclusion during the clan's most difficult period, a time when Li Zhouwei was still being hounded by the Floating Cloud Cave. He had been deeply worried, which was why he had come straight to the main hall. But to his surprise, Li Minggong let out a giggle, covering her mouth with her hand. "Little brother," she said, her eyes dancing, "Clan Uncle has reached the Purple Mansion Realm!"

"Oh..." Li Chenghuai froze. A flush crept up his neck as he stared blankly into space. Several long seconds passed. "What?"

Li Minggong beamed. "It happened just a few days ago! All the major families came to offer their congratulations. We had several Purple Mansion cultivators attend the Dharma Assembly in person. It was a magnificent affair! If only you'd emerged a few days sooner, you could have seen it all!"

Li Chenghuai felt as if he were dreaming. It was utterly unbelievable. "Then our clan..." he whispered, "is now a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan?"

"Precisely!" Li Zhouwei confirmed.

Li Chenghuai could no longer contain his joy and burst into loud, incredulous laughter. "You're not joking, are you? Then... what about the Floating Cloud Cave?"

"The Floating Cloud Cave? We destroyed them!"

As Li Minggong recounted the events, an irrepressible smile spread across Li Chenghuai's face. He let out a long sigh of relief. "During my seclusion, I worried constantly about the clan. It took me nearly a year of conditioning before I even began the breakthrough process. It was an arduous struggle, and I was growing weaker by the day. Fortunately, the Essence Gathering Pills gave me the strength to persevere."

"I still had a long road ahead, and success was far from certain. But then, I felt the spiritual qi of the world suddenly shift. In that instant, countless new insights flooded my mind. It was as if the heavens themselves were aiding me, and I broke through in a single, fluid motion!"

"So that's it!" Li Zhouwei and Li Minggong exchanged a look of sudden understanding. "It was the change in Jiangnan's spiritual aura! An event like this might not happen in decades... What a blessed opportunity!"

Li Minggong sighed in amazement. Li Zhouwei was also deeply moved. "On the path of cultivation," he said, "the role of fate and fortune can truly never be underestimated."

He sighed once more, then broke into a smile. "Since you've broken through, Uncle, this is another great blessing for our clan. Aunt Minggong no longer needs to stand guard here; she can now go to Jiangbei... First, however, you should pay your respects to the elders, share the good news, and take over the affairs of Mount Qingdu."

"Of course," Li Chenghuai said thoughtfully. He immediately took his leave to pay his respects to Li Xuanxuan. Meanwhile, Li Zhouwei took out a sheet of paper and began to write with a flourish. 'I must also send a letter to the main sect,' he thought, 'and inform the elders of this joyous news.'

Li Minggong waited by his side. After a moment, an old man approached them. He had a bald head, a snow-white beard, and a sturdy frame. It was An Zheyan. At nearly one hundred and seventy years of age, he had mellowed considerably. He bowed. "Reporting to the Clan Head," he said. "A message from Gardenia Scenery Mountain. The Daoist Master left with Ding Weizeng some time ago. Their destination is unknown."

An Zheyan was one of the clan's most senior and loyal retainers. Li Zhouwei nodded to him, then turned back to Li Minggong. "Aunt, let's you and I make a trip to Jiangbei first."

***

"Great-Grandfather... Great-Grandfather, you needn't see me out..." Li Chenghuai said as he emerged from the hall. But Li Xuanxuan, beaming, held fast to his hand and walked him all the way to the entrance. This string of joyous news had brought a healthy, ruddy glow to the old man's face, making him look years younger.

"Huai'er," the old man said, his voice thick with emotion, "your father was always the most sensible of his generation. Now that you've reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, he would be so, so proud..."

Li Xuanxuan rambled on, lost in memory, and Li Chenghuai listened in silence. The old man pulled him aside and took a brocade box from his robes. "Huai'er," he whispered, "when Ximing achieved his Divine Ability, your parents came back to visit. Xiao'er came to see me as well. You, however, were in seclusion and missed them. They only met with Zhouluo... they had a good talk and gave him many spiritual treasures."

"Your father left this with me for you," he continued, opening the box. "It is a Supreme Feather Night-robe. Dharma Artifacts for Upper Shamans are exceedingly rare; he spent years searching for this one. He said that if you succeeded in your breakthrough, it was to be yours. If you failed, it would go to Zhouluo."

Li Chenghuai's gaze lingered on the robe, and he let out a slow breath. Li Xuanxuan then added, "Your mother also came to see me privately. She left this for you—a Secret Talisman of the Night Ghost. It's a direct-lineage heirloom of the Yang family. I don't know what it does, but she wanted you to have it..."

Both items lay within the brocade box. Li Chenghuai accepted it in silence. A pang of pity went through Li Xuanxuan. "For many years... your father could barely ensure his own safety, and he's not a man of many words. Your mother, as a direct heir of the Yang family, has always had her hands tied. You must not blame them... Now, with Ximing's breakthrough, and your father as the Master of the Heaven-Probing Pavilion, he finally has the power to help you. But he would find it hard to say these things himself."

Li Chenghuai shook his head. "It was never about the Dharma Artifacts."

Li Xuanxuan patted his shoulder. "There is nothing that cannot be resolved between a father and son. Look at me... I lost my own father at birth, my mother in my youth, and my own sons in my middle years. Now, in my old age, I tend to their graves. Even your Uncle Ximing, for all his power, carries this same regret... Cherish your family."

"Now, both you and your father are Foundation Establishment cultivators. Others would be green with envy... For now, go and see to the affairs of Mount Qingdu. After a few days, you should take a trip to the Azure Pond Sect."

Li Chenghuai tucked the brocade box into his sleeve and took his leave, his voice thick. He took a moment to compose himself before silently riding the wind across the lake.

He replayed the words of Li Xuanxuan and Li Zhouwei in his mind, and a knot of apprehension tightened in his stomach. '*First, go and see to the affairs of Mount Qingdu*... It seems Zhouluo hasn't been managing things well.'

Not daring to delay, he changed course and headed straight for Mount Qingdu. Passing through the defensive formation, he saw the flickering lights of the main hall and could faintly hear the sounds of someone grinding an inkstone and turning the pages of a book.

Li Chenghuai knocked gently on the door.

A clear voice called from within. "Is that you, clan brother? Please, come in!"
