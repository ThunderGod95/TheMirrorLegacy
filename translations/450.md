# Chapter 637: Retribution and Response

Li Xuanfeng lowered his head, knowing it was not his place to respond. He remained silent as Yuan Su raised his hand and casually said, "Go to the Eastern Sea again and kill for me."

With a flick of his wrist, Yuan Su retrieved a piece of cloth from his sleeve, densely packed with names. Among them were prominent surnames and sects, though most of the names were unfamiliar and belonged to young individuals, with only a small portion being Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

Li Xuanfeng nodded, carefully received the list, and tucked it into his robe.

Yuan Su then pulled out a jade talisman from his own robe, his voice low. For the first time, his usual lazy demeanor gave way to an air of weariness and age. "This is an artifact from northern Buddhist cultivators. It can conceal your thread of fate. Use it to kill and avoid being traced."

As he watched Li Xuanfeng accept the talisman, Yuan Su waved his hand with little interest. "Go. Get it done cleanly within ten years."

Li Xuanfeng bowed and retreated. Once he had left the cave dwelling, he carefully examined the list. On it were names from locations such as Crimson Reef Island, Golden Tang Gate, the Han Family, and even people from Profound Peak Gate, Hengzhu Dao Gate, and Azure Pond Sect. The sheer number of cultivators listed was staggering, and their inclusion would almost certainly offend the entire Yue State and the Eastern Sea region.

As Li Xuanfeng descended and disappeared into the mist, Ning Heyuan kneeled on the other side of the jade platform, his face drenched in sweat.

Yuan Su slowly stood and moved beside him, his voice soft. "Do you understand?"

Ning Heyuan lowered his gaze, trembling as he said, "Daoist Master... is this truly necessary?"

Ning Heyuan was no fool. He could clearly see the situation. The Ning Family had no one capable of restraining Li Xuanfeng. If Yuan Su were to die unexpectedly and Ning Wan failed to break through, the family's future would be precarious.

Yuan Su, having reached his status as a Daoist Master, was naturally meticulous and cunning. He wouldn't rely solely on Ning Hemian to secure Li Xuanfeng's loyalty. If the time came when Li Xizhi and Li Xuanfeng, both Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, held sway over the sect, and the Li Family continued to rise, the question of who would serve whom would be unclear.

By secretly ordering Li Xuanfeng to kill these people, Yuan Su ensured the Ning Family would have leverage over him. If the matter were ever exposed, it would spell Li Xuanfeng's ruin, leaving him no place to hide.

At the same time, once Li Xuanfeng was burdened with these blood debts, Yuan Su wouldn't need to act himself. Li Xuanfeng would sever ties with the Li Family entirely, achieving multiple objectives with a single stroke.

Still, no matter how much Yuan Su controlled Li Xuanfeng, Ning Heyuan could not feel the same sense of security as when Yuan Su was alive. Trembling, Ning Heyuan tearfully pleaded, "Daoist Master... I am of little use and still have much to learn from you. Without you, the family would lose its pillar of support."

Daoist Master Yuan Su paused briefly, his expression twisting. Beneath his robes, his hand clenched tightly as though suppressing something within himself.

A Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master's predicament was unlike that of ordinary people in power. When ordinary people grew old, they became senile, weak, and powerless to act on their desires.

But a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator retained their divine abilities and full consciousness until their very last breath. They could do nothing but watch as their own end approached, with the signs of their imminent demise looming over them. This terrifying clarity surpassed that of mortal death by a thousandfold.

Thus, it was not uncommon for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to wreak havoc in their final days, unleashing violence on friends and family alike. Ning Heyuan had heard of such cases before. Seeing Yuan Su's darkening expression, he quickly fell silent.

After several long breaths, Yuan Su slowly opened his eyes. His face twisted with malice as he stepped forward and spat out a single word, "Leave."

Ning Heyuan quickly scrambled out of the cavern, the jingling of his footsteps echoing in the quiet as the stone door closed heavily behind him. Yuan Su was left standing alone in the cave dwelling.

Ning Tiaoxiao clenched his teeth in silence and let out a deep breath. As the mist inside the cave dwelling dissipated, faint ghostly lights emerged on the stone walls, revealing exquisitely detailed faces etched into the surface.

Ning Tiaoxiao stared intently at these faces, counting their numbers. With a quick calculation, despair washed over him. He muttered in a low voice, "Burn the records, erase the names, replace the real with the false, and confuse truth with illusion. The world will have no clear path to follow."

"Brother Qun..." Ning Tiaoxiao continued absent-mindedly, "Chi Wei once said, in a world where the righteous path is sealed, all crooked paths become the righteous way. Brother Qun... my life's span is nearing its end. I have not encountered any immortals. Instead, I have drunk the blood of the people for a hundred years and committed countless evils. All that is left is to wait for death."

As the mist gradually rose, his figure disappeared into the swirling white vapor. Bowing his head as if in repentance, the spirit water flowing across the ground ceased its motion and began to float silently.

"For this is the only way to protect our clan." His voice reverberated in the cave dwelling.

————

"Daoist Master Yuan Su is planning for the matters after his death. This is a token of allegiance." Li Xuanfeng left the cave dwelling and flew straight back to his residence. Only upon arriving did he take out the list of names to examine it carefully.

As he narrowed his eyes at the list, his hands trembled slightly. One name after another surfaced in his mind, and, as he had expected, many of the families listed had close ties with the Li Family.

"...Yuan Su... what a masterstroke." Li Xuanfeng sighed.

Saying nothing, Li Xuanfeng walked into his residence in a daze. In the courtyard, Ning Hemian was sitting under the warm sunlight. A child sat nearby, reading aloud. For a moment, Li Xuanfeng stopped in his tracks, crossing his arms as though caught in a distant memory.

It was a scene so familiar: soft sunlight, a tranquil courtyard, and even a featherless wild goose wandering aimlessly about.

Yet this was Yi Mountain City, where the imposing atmosphere discouraged geese from flying above. The Ning Family's thresholds, carved with formation patterns, were far too high for a goose to enter.

"Dear husband!" Ning Hemian exclaimed in joy, raising her head. Her bright eyes sparkled with happiness, shaking Li Xuanfeng to his core. Her gentle words, spoken softly, didn't register with him. Inside, his emotions surged violently, making him feel nauseous.

Two faces flashed back and forth in his mind, causing him to clench his teeth until they almost shattered.

Pale-faced, Li Xuanfeng stood there motionless, haunted by the memory of his wife and child's brutal deaths. The horrifying scene interwove with the present reality, forcing long-buried memories to surface despite his efforts to suppress them.

He panted heavily until Ning Hemian approached and lightly shook his arm, her gaze filled with concern and affection. Only then did the shadows in his mind recede. He waved his hand lightly, signaling that he was fine.

Quickly regaining composure, his face returned to normal. He sat for a moment on a stone bench, his eyes vacant and unfocused.

Who was he supposed to take revenge on? He knew much of the truth now: the deal between Chi Wei and Jiang Boqing had forced Golden Tang Gate to strike southward. At the time, Chi Zhiyun had refused to dirty his hands, leaving the Ning Family to oversee matters covertly.

But Chi Wei was dead, and so was Jiang Boqing. Who now could bear the brunt of his vengeance? Should he target Ning Wan, who orchestrated the matter, or the Ning Family as a whole? Should he lay the blame entirely on the Chi Family? Lost in thought, Li Xuanfeng grasped his golden bow and shut his eyes tightly.

"Now, I have been ordered to kill, to massacre families allied to my own, merely as a token of allegiance. How is this any different from what Golden Tang Gate, the Ning Family, and the dogs of Azure Pond Sect did before?" Li Xuangfeng lamented, "How am I any better than the one who murdered Yu'er and my son? I have enjoyed the wealth of the immortal clans, taken a wife, and sired children. If Yu'er knew, she would surely spit on me in disgust."

His brow furrowed deeply, and his face darkened with grief. His lips trembled, and as night quickly fell, it felt as though a cold, venomous fire consumed him from within, leaving him frozen and dazed.

The courtyard was now empty, with only Ning Hemian sitting softly beside him. She clasped his hand silently, her expression calm and patient.

He raised his eyes to look at her, but the words refused to come out. His throat felt like it was full of thorns. After a long pause, his trembling voice finally broke the silence, "Mian'er, the Daoist Master has ordered me to kill."

Ning Hemian, ever perceptive, lowered her gaze as she took the list of names from his hand. Slowly gripping his hand tighter, she forced herself to say, "This is... a token of allegiance."

Li Xuanfeng's heart felt like a cold stone, lodged deep and immovable, as he watched Ning Hemian, her face pale, begin to read aloud, "Xiao Fu... the sixth grandson of Xiao Guitu... Kong Gusun, the nephew of Kong Yu himself! Cheng Xun'en... an inner disciple of Sword Gate... though not highly regarded, still a member of Sword Gate... Daoist Master... what is he thinking?!"

Ning Hemian abruptly stood, her face as white as paper, as she prepared to rise with the wind. But Li Xuanfeng caught her wrist, his lips bloodless as he spoke in a low voice, "Our family killed Yu Muxian."

The words struck Ning Hemian like thunder. She slumped back into her seat, staring at Li Xuanfeng, who refused to meet her gaze, his eyes fixed on the ground. The two sat in silence, husband and wife with no words to bridge the gulf between them. Finally, Li Xuanfeng spoke, "There is no other way forward. If the heavens and earth condemn me, let the punishment fall upon me alone. I will not allow it... to implicate others."

Ning Hemian's hands slowly fell to her sides as she sat quietly, watching him. Under the moonlight, his temples had turned completely white.

In September, the rain fell incessantly.

The population of Lijing Town had dwindled over the past few years. With unceasing rain, the crops could not grow and instead rotted in the fields, leaving them black and useless.

Famine had already begun to spread in the surrounding areas. Stable factions managed to survive better. As long as Qi Cultivators could soar with the wind, they could always trade for abundant grain elsewhere. In the fertile lands of Jiangnan, starvation could be avoided with effort.

The Yu Family had fragmented into six or seven smaller clans, allowing the townsfolk to live slightly better lives. With their population thinned, these newly established clans were eager to recruit cultivators of humble origins. Additionally, under the warnings issued by the Li Family, they generously distributed grain to avoid conflict.

Li Chengliao was in the main hall, holding his young heir on his lap as they read together. Suddenly, a figure entered from below.

The man, clad in armor and carrying a massive golden hammer in one hand, was tall and imposing—Li Wen.

As a rare talent among the Li Family's branch members, Li Wen had steadily risen to the peak of his power. Loyal and steadfast, his twin golden hammers had guarded several generations of clan heads, though they were rarely needed.

Li Chengliao had gradually taken over authority from Li Xicheng, and Li Wen had become a banner under his command, signaling his clear succession as the family's head.

Li Chengliao treated the old retainer with respect. After setting his son, Li Zhouwei, down from his lap, he looked up. The burly man spoke, "Master, Lord Lu has come to see you."

"Master Lu?" Li Chengliao wasn't surprised. Master Lu was the one responsible for Yu Mugao's death and the Yu family's subsequent fragmentation.

He was about to ask further when Li Wen continued, "He has been intercepted by Senior Wushao over the lake. Unable to advance or retreat, Senior Wushao has summoned Ancestor Ximing, and the three are currently at a standoff."

Li Wen, despite his rugged demeanor, spoke slowly and deliberately. The gravity of the situation was clear. Li Chengliao raised an eyebrow, quickly stood, and hurried outside. As he ascended with the wind, he asked, "He is merely a Qi Cultivator. How could he warrant the attention of two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators?"

He hesitated briefly but soared into the sky, observing from a distance.

————

Master Lu, dressed in flowing white robes and holding a fan, landed gracefully on the lake's surface. He faced the Foundation Establishment Realm demon before him without a trace of fear.

Taking a few steps into the air, he noticed a man in golden daoist robes flying in his direction. Once the two joined together, Master Lu finally restrained the frivolity on his face, offering a fist cup with a smile, "A visit from an old friend—would the two of you invite me in for a seat?"

Li Wushao's expression darkened as he fixed his gaze on Master Lu. This man was clearly at the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm, making it impossible for him to be just a guest cultivator of the Yu Family. Li Wushao stood ready, awaiting Li Ximing's command.

Li Ximing, though feeling uncertain in his heart, forced himself to stand firm. Despite being out of practice, his upbringing in etiquette gave him just enough composure to respond appropriately. With a calm demeanor, he gestured and said, "Please, Fellow Daoist."

Master Lu showed no sign of concern and followed the two into the formation. Once inside, he chuckled softly and cupped his fist again. "I am Jiang Heqian. I once had the honor of joining hands with Daoist Tongya against a mutual enemy. I wonder if your esteemed clan still remembers."

These words sent a chill down Li Ximing's spine. He had read the family histories and was well aware of who Jiang Heqian was.

Years ago, during the Yu Family's peak prosperity, with two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators overseeing their affairs, they had established the Milin Marketplace to further expand their influence. However, this had simultaneously infringed on the interests of many factions, even drawing the dissatisfaction of the Xiao Family.

In response, Li Tongya had united various forces, not only killing the ancestor of Yu Family but also destroying their market. During this assault, he had collaborated with Fei Wangbai and Jiang Heqian, a descendant of the Jiang Family. This partnership had dealt a severe blow to the Yu Family.

Jiang Heqian played a pivotal role in the incident, enabling the Yu Family's grand formation to be easily breached. Li Ximing had only read about this name in the family's history books, yet now, seeing the man in person, he felt as though a figure from history had stepped into the present, bringing with it a profound sense of the passage of time.

However, this feeling was soon replaced by an intense sense of dread.

This man is the last survivor of the Jiang Family. The Jiang Family was founded by outer disciples of the Moonlight Origin Mansion. Countless factions have sought him over the years, but his whereabouts had always remained unknown. And to think... to think he disguised himself as a mere Qi Cultivation Realm guest cultivator, endured decades in the Yu Family, orchestrated the death of Yu Mugao, and ultimately caused the Yu Family's fragmentation...

At this thought, a moment of realization dawned on Li Ximing.
𝒻𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘸ℯ𝒷𝘯𝘰𝑣ℯ𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝘮

No wonder... no wonder the Yu Family, once a big clan, lacked any means of maintaining stability and crumbled so easily. If not for Yuanwu Peak's intervention, the Yu Family wouldn't have lasted this long! So it was all his doing, pulling the strings from the shadows... an eye for an eye, blood repaid with blood!

Back in its heyday, the Jiang Family had been a powerful force. The Yu and An families had been subordinate branches of the Jiang Family. However, after the Jiang Family's main lineage fell from power, several surrounding immortal gates had quietly pushed its downfall, leaving it shattered.

The Yu Family had been the greatest beneficiary of the Jiang Family's collapse, producing numerous talents over the following decades and rising to prominence. Yet Jiang Heqian, through a century of patience, had methodically delivered his revenge, returning the favor in full.

As the initial wave of disbelief passed, Li Ximing mulled it over and found that the plan was indeed feasible. The Jiang Family's inheritance likely included techniques for concealing one's aura. While these techniques might not fool Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of equal rank, they were more than enough to deceive Qi Cultivators.

After Yu Xiaogui's death, the Yu Family no longer had any Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. No one remained who could uncover Jiang Heqian's true cultivation level. Even spies from other factions, at most possessing moderate cultivation, would not have been able to see through him.

Ingenious... truly ingenious... Li Ximing praised inwardly.

Jiang Heqian seemed thoroughly satisfied with the expression on Li Ximing's face, as if savoring the gratification of a long-sought revenge. He let out a hearty laugh, pointing northward, and said with a smirk, "Well? With Yu Mugao's head and this grand gift, does your clan find it satisfactory?"

His laughter grew wilder, carrying a hint of madness, but he eventually calmed, his tone turning somewhat regretful. "It is just a pity... Daoist Tongya and Wangbai cannot witness this with their own eyes. It would have made the revenge all the sweeter!"
