# Chapter 759: Desperate Flight to the Eastern Sea

Changxiao's reputation was immense. He and Guo Shentong had once shocked all of Jiangnan when they escaped a Grotto-Heaven with priceless treasures, right under the nose of a Purple Mansion cultivator's grand scheme. After achieving the Purple Mansion realm himself and founding his own Dao lineage, the Daoist Master became known as one of the foremost experts in manipulating the strings of fate.

Yet, his face was genuinely gentle and sincere. If not for the shrewdness in his eyes, he might have even appeared simple and honest. He held the lantern with a delicate touch, and his voice was deep and resonant.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing! It has been too long!"

A chill crept through Li Ximing's heart, but his voice betrayed nothing.

"Greetings, Senior Changxiao. I was just sparring with Daoist Friend Yehui and was on my way back. I did not expect to run into you, Senior. Is there something I can help you with?"

Changxiao lifted the lantern slightly, maintaining a careful distance from Li Ximing and securely blocking the path west through the Great Void. He watched him quietly before speaking.

"I had a grand-disciple. His worldly name was Wang Fu, and his Daoist title was Yu Fuzi. He was stationed in the Eastern Sea in his early years. He was a bit of a libertine, but his talent was undeniable... A pity... he was later killed by a cultivator of the Hengzhu Immortal Dao."

"At first, I didn't know the reason why. Only later did I learn that you, Daoist Friend, desired the Bright Radiant Sky Stone. You conspired with the Hengzhu, and it cost him his life... Heaven and earth bore witness to this matter. The traces remain in the Eastern Sea. Surely Zhaojing hasn't forgotten?"

His expression was placid, his eyes fixed on Li Ximing, searching for any flicker of emotion.

The man before him kept his head slightly bowed in an attitude of reverence. Changxiao studied him carefully. This Li Ximing seemed to lack any remarkable presence. His robes were conventional, and his expression was a mix of guilt and fear. Changxiao frowned slightly.

'Li Ximing…'

In the instant Changxiao paused to think, a dazzling radiance erupted from Li Ximing. Profound Light illuminated the void as the vibrant splendor of Bright Yang burst forth. A celestial gate rose from nothing, adorned with dragon banners, luan-drawn chariots, and jeweled standards.

The illusory colors of the Supreme Yang and the glow of Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light converged, climbing the ornate, bright-white celestial gate. Billowing clouds of iridescent light surged directly toward Changxiao's face.

Facing the rushing Bright Yang divine ability, Changxiao simply lifted his sleeve, revealing his arm. He formed a hand seal.

"Fall!" he commanded.

Behind him, a field of brilliant white dots materialized, dense and dazzling against the pitch-black of the Great Void. With that single word, the Bright Yang divine ability at his feet shattered. Countless streams of radiant light scattered in every direction.

Li Ximing was already gone.

The moment Changxiao had spoken, Li Ximing knew his guess was right. The man had come with ill intent. Fearing some hidden trick, he didn't bother to reply. He poured all his accumulated divine ability and Dharma power into the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, transforming into a streak of light and vanishing into the void.

'The matter with Wang Fu… What nonsense! That Bright Radiant Sky Stone was bait, a hint pointing toward Tu Longjian, but the fact that my family ended up with it was the result of a gamble. How can he possibly place the blame on my family's head!'

Li Ximing had been present when Wang Fu died. The man's last words had been clear.

'He hates Jinlian... so he wants me dead!'

It was obvious that Wang Fu had been nothing more than a disposable pawn. Changxiao was just using his death as a convenient excuse!

As Li Ximing fled at maximum speed, Changxiao remained unhurried. He took a leisurely stroll through the Great Void, pinching his fingers together in a divination three separate times. Only then did he vanish, a streak of light tearing through the void in hot pursuit.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing… you took a spirit item from my Purple Mansion. Because of this tribulation, you have come to the Eastern Sea. Who here can possibly help you?"

Li Ximing's attack had been a diversion. He had summoned *Audience with the Celestial Gate* only to vanish an instant later. Now, riding the tiger in his desperate escape, he pushed its concealment abilities to their limit. But he found that the profound blackness of the Great Void around him was slowly lightening, shifting to a deep gray.

'He's already caught up.'

Changxiao was approaching from the south at an incredible speed. Li Ximing had bought himself only a moment's lead, and his only option was to flee east. Changing direction now would be foolishly closing the distance between them. The wondrous power of the Geng Tiger Dao began to activate, his form growing increasingly faint.

Compared to Li Ximing's life-or-death flight, Changxiao had barely quickened his pace. Holding his lantern, he watched Li Ximing's form fade into the distance. Suddenly, he spoke, his voice ethereal, rustling like wind through leaves as it crossed the void to Li Ximing's side.

"So the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger truly is in your hands. That old man from Profound Peak is a clever one, knowing that preserving your life was paramount... But it's not enough."

The lantern in Changxiao's hand brightened. Flames no larger than a thumb ignited on each of its twelve silver-and-gold-inlaid corners. The flames themselves did not give chase, but an intense wave of True Fire erupted from the lamplight. Li Ximing's fading figure instantly snapped back into sharp focus, and the surging power of the True Fire bore down on him, illuminating his back.

Li Ximing felt a searing heat on his back, but he could still bear it. However, the lantern's power clearly grew with proximity. As the seconds ticked by, the roasting sensation intensified.

'True Fire again!' he thought.

This wasn't surprising. Changxiao had entered the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven as a pawn of a Purple Mansion cultivator, so the Dao lineage and spiritual artifacts he obtained would naturally hail from there. Yehui's own lineage had been seized from Zhang Lingshu, also a product of the Mirrored-Mirage Grotto-Heaven. That Grotto-Heaven's fame was widespread and its arts diverse, but their spiritual artifacts were almost certainly of a similar nature.

'Yehui… Changxiao… their Dao lineages come from the same source. Yehui's great offense against my family long ago was nothing more than a declaration of his stance… which means this plot began even earlier… it must have started when the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion first moved against us!'

'Whatever Changxiao is plotting against my family… he began laying the groundwork long ago. It's even possible that my breakthrough to the Purple Mansion realm disrupted his plans to some extent… leading to the current situation…'

'And Yehui was always hesitant, unwilling to burn his bridges completely. Even at the end, he withdrew his technique. He probably wasn't truly on the same side as Changxiao, but Changxiao must have some hold over him! That would explain his inconsistent actions, his constant restraint. He might have even been hoping I could escape Changxiao's grasp!'

His spiritual sense spread through the Great Void, evading the True Fire. He saw Changxiao's willow-leaf eyes, and a realization struck him like a thunderbolt.

'And Changxiao used precisely that… Why force a reluctant Yehui to participate? That reluctance, that restraint, was the key to his entire scheme!'

Changxi had left him the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger as a trump card. The only way to ensure Li Ximing would engage in a prolonged, traceable fight all the way to the Eastern Sea was to have Yehui—who, under Purple Smoke's authority, had no desire to make a true enemy of the Li family—be the one to make the move. This double, or even triple, layer of assurance was what made Li Ximing confident enough to fight without immediately hiding his trump card and fleeing back to Moongaze Lake on his spiritual artifact.

How much of this scheme Yehui understood was unclear, but it was his half-hearted obedience to Changxiao, his constant attempts to mediate, that had become a tool in Changxiao's plot.

A lone Purple Mansion cultivator could travel silently through the Great Void, but a battle between two was far more conspicuous. Once their fight reached the Eastern Sea and promptly ended, the watching cultivators—perhaps even Sumian and Tinglan—would disperse. Changxiao could then emerge at his leisure, cornering him in the isolated waters of the Eastern Sea.

'I can't fathom his entire plan… but that, at least, is part of it…'

The True Fire at his back, while different from before, felt familiar, lending credence to his theory. Li Ximing exhaled to calm himself. He stopped thinking about whether Tinglan and the others were complicit or if he had simply unraveled the plot ahead of time. Staying alive was all that mattered now.

'Since Changxiao also follows the Mirrored-Mirage Dao lineage… he might have techniques related to thunder. I must be careful!' he silently warned himself. 'Thank goodness my foundation is Bright Yang… If it were anything else… either the True Fire or the Profound Thunder would have been a perfect counter to me!'

With the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger's concealment nullified, Li Ximing stopped trying to hide and simply focused on speed, streaking through the Great Void. Changxiao, lantern in hand, steadily closed the distance.

"Daoist Friend Zhaojing, we were merely discussing old times. Why leave without a word? It is rather impolite!" he called out softly.

"Senior Changxiao! If we are to discuss the past, why block my path home? Once I return to the mainland and find a place to heal, I will naturally send an invitation for you, Senior, so we can discuss things in detail. There is no need for such hostility, chasing me through the Great Void!"

Hearing this, Changxiao chuckled. He continued his inexorable approach, the scorching True Fire searing Li Ximing's back. Li Ximing's voice was grim.

"Rise!"

In an instant, the ornate, bright-white celestial gate materialized from the void. The intense Profound Light held Changxiao back for only a moment before the terrifying True Fire crashed down like a river of crimson, spilling over the sides of the gate and incinerating everything in its path.

Li Ximing's face turned a ghastly shade of pale, clearly injured by the backlash. He had only managed to open a sliver of distance before he heard Changxiao finish casting a spell.

"*Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art*, strike!"

Li Ximing immediately sensed a small, silver-bright vase flying toward him from behind. It moved with incredible speed, appearing as solid as a real object despite being a spell. He flicked his wrist, sending a jet of purple flame to intercept it.

"Hmph!"

But before the purple flame could connect, Changxiao snorted. A silver, circular disk flew out from behind him, engraved with golden osmanthus patterns. It shone upon the purple flame, and a burst of cold moonlight erupted, completely extinguishing it.

Employing the same trick as before, Li Ximing dove out of the Great Void. He emerged into a world of churning waves and dark, rolling clouds. He was met instantly by a flash of white light that had clearly been waiting for him in the physical world, and it shot straight into his eyes.

'A divine ability from Changxiao!'

He felt as if a spike had been driven into his skull. His vision swam, and his mind filled with a gray fog. The divine ability he had been half-forming nearly dissipated.

Fortunately, a cool sensation rushed into his mind, soothing the chaos. As his senses returned, he caught a glimpse of Changxiao emerging nearby and immediately plunged back into the Great Void.

But having broken through to the Purple Mansion realm only a few years ago, how could he possibly be a match for Changxiao? His mastery of the Great Void was far inferior. He had only just pierced through the veil when he was met head-on by the silver vase, which tilted and slammed down on him. The blow was staggering. Stars exploded behind his eyes, his chest seized, and he gasped for breath. Relying on that thread of coolness to maintain his posture, he spurred the tiger onward.

A moment later, Changxiao tore into the Great Void just as Li Ximing was pulling away. But this time, Changxiao didn't attack immediately. Instead, he watched with a look of surprise.

"Something's wrong…"

Changxiao had been a Purple Mansion cultivator for many years. He knew exactly what effect his divine abilities and arts should have, with only minor variations depending on his opponent's own powers. This was completely unexpected.

"To take a direct hit from my divine ability, followed by the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art*, and still be able to control a spiritual artifact… there must be something else at play. Either his soul is unusual and his destiny different, or he possesses some treasure that can keep his spiritual sense clear."

The next moment, he broke through into the physical world in pursuit. A torrential downpour lashed the surface of the sea, and the world was plunged into darkness. But mere rain could not impede the vision of a Purple Mansion cultivator. He stepped onto the wind and gave chase.

The Treasured Vase had left Li Ximing dizzy and disoriented. The circulation of his Dharma Body was sluggish, and even his divine abilities felt clumsy. Changxiao caught up to him twice. Forming a seal, a brutally intense, multi-colored beam of profound light, as thick as a fist, shot from between Changxiao's brows.

Li Ximing felt a mortal chill crawl up his spine. He immediately tore open his own chest, his organs shifting and rearranging to create a large cavity through his torso.

*Boom!*

The profound light shot straight through the hole. But a Purple Mansion cultivator's attack was not so easily thwarted. The beam was composed of two intertwining strands that rapidly expanded, cutting both up and down. Li Ximing, now at the end of his rope, was forced to act. His body split with a sickening tear, the two halves diverging to evade the attack.

Changxiao's brow-light swept through the world, leaving two trails of white vapor that boiled the sea and sent fish and shrimp tumbling through the air. His eyes watched, devoid of emotion, as Li Ximing's body reformed and continued its desperate flight.

"*Audience with the Celestial Gate* is said to be an art divine ability, but it has traces of a body divine ability. I miscalculated."

He spoke of miscalculation, but it was Li Ximing who was suffering. Splitting his body had allowed the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art* to seep deeper, its effects growing more severe. And yet, his mind was now completely free of distracting thoughts, replaced by a crystalline clarity filled with fierce resolve.

'I am no match for him, but even Changxiao must have his own concerns. I will drag this out for as long as I can… a moment, a day… Unless my Shengyang Manor is utterly annihilated, if I can just escape far enough… I will show this old bastard something he'll never forget!'

Though they had only just reached the edge of the Hetian Sea, still a great distance from the far eastern reaches of the sea or the World's Cape, Li Ximing swallowed his own blood and pushed himself faster. He drove his divine abilities without regard for the cost, a bloody light beginning to glow around his body.

The influence of the *Treasured Vase Merging Profundity Art* was immense, but fortunately, Li Ximing's spiritual sense remained lucid. No matter how great the interference, he could use his sheer willpower to compensate. He suddenly looked back, raising the *Audience with the Celestial Gate* to defend himself, only to see a cloud of gray smoke gathering in Changxiao's hands.

The Daoist Master smiled.

"The Hetian Sea is far enough from Mount Luoxia, and this is dragon territory, where Luoxia's authority doesn't reach… We've been at this for the better part of a day, and there's been no reaction from the upper sect…"

Li Ximing ignored him, speeding further away, his urgency mounting.

'I've reached the edge of the Hetian Sea. This is unequivocally dragon territory. I cannot use the Supreme Yin Profound Light here… I have to get beyond this sea. Disappearing into the east is my best bet. The World's Navel is out of reach… but I must at least get to the far eastern edge of the sea, out of the dragons' sight.'

His grip tightened on his spiritual artifact.

'Even if I have to detonate the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger, even if I have to sacrifice my Dharma Body… as long as a single sliver of my Shengyang can escape to the east… I can survive!'

He flew onward with his head down, only to see a cloud of gray smoke drift in from high above, starkly visible against the dark storm clouds. Blinding flashes of lightning brewed within the smoke, mirroring the storm in the heavens. Changxiao's voice, amplified by the Profound Thunder in his spiritual artifact, echoed across the sky.

"Your family's Bright Yang truly isn't a front for Mount Luoxia! In that case, I won't let you run any longer!"
