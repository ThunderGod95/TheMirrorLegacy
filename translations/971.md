# Chapter 971: Nanxiang

Ever since Li Zhouwei had been revealed to the public, the Golden Feather Sect's attitude had improved considerably. Daoist Master Tianhuo had visited the Li Clan several times, always polite and amiable. The "Qilin's Radiance Shining Sun Divine Scroll," which had benefited the Li Clan so much, had been a gift from them...

And as long as the Li family sent them Neck Feathers, the Golden Feather Sect would exchange Profound Shell Flower-Leaves for them, regardless of whether they needed them or not. Their intention to help was obvious. Now, with Daoist Master Tianhuo asking so directly, their stance was even clearer.

Li Ximing looked at the young man's smiling face and began to weigh his options.

'This... isn't bad. After all, there are too many Daoist Traditions in the north. Who knows how many of them are targeting our family... not to mention the Buddhist cultivators who are certain to enter. If we can get the Golden Feather Sect to provide some support, it would naturally be a good thing...'

He smiled. "I'm just afraid we'll drag down your immortal sect!"

"Ah..." A smile touched Daoist Master Tianhuo's eyes, making him appear even more dashing. "That's not right... Your noble clan has many talented individuals. How could you speak of being a burden? Our two families share six generations of friendship and a hundred years of peace. Our ties have been strong ever since Senior Tongya and my Golden Feather Sect's Dao-child. We should let the younger generation interact more."

He brought up the old matter of Zhang Yun, making Li Ximing nod with a smile. At the Purple Mansion Realm, both families knew the truth. It had all been a result of calculations back then. The so-called "friendship" was just a story to fool the ignorant masses. He muttered inwardly:

'When they need us, it's "six generations of friendship" and "a hundred years of peace." When they don't, it's "that minor clan on the lake" and "come when you are summoned." The Golden Feather Sect's surname is Zhang, but very few of those Zhangs have ever shown any real goodwill to my Li family...'

Still, exploring this Mystic Realm wasn't a core interest. It only involved a few Foundation Establishment cultivators. The Golden Feather Sect wouldn't stoop to playing tricks in a matter like this. He smiled. "You are absolutely right, Daoist Brother!"

He reached into his sleeve and took out a round pearl engraved with the markings of a spirit tiger. With a subtle manipulation, it instantly transformed into a palm-sized spirit tiger. Li Ximing sent his thoughts, listing off several names: "Li Jiangxia, Ding Weizeng, Li Jianglong, Li Wushao, Chen Yang..."

These individuals were chosen either for their high cultivation or for their formidable skills and abilities. He sent no more. However, when it came to the crucial pair, Li Jiangqian and Li Que'Wan, Li Ximing hesitated.

Li Que'Wan had gone to the Eastern Sea over half a year ago and was already at the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. He wasn't sure if she had emerged from her seclusion yet. Li Jiangqian was at the lake, but he had been in seclusion for a long time, taking pills to perfect his cultivation.

Li Ximing had no intention of disturbing their seclusion just to enter this Mystic Realm. Unlike Li Zhouwei, who was now exposed to all, Li Jiangqian and Li Que'Wan were his clan's Purple Mansion Seeds. He had deliberately kept them low-profile for years. At most, the outside world knew they had good cultivation arts; they knew almost nothing about Li Que'Wan.

If they shone too brightly in the Mystic Realm, they would certainly attract everyone's attention and be marked by rivals. If Li Ximing was ever tied down, there was no guarantee their enemies wouldn't make a move in secret.

The people he was sending in were not high-level. The only one who was, Ding Weizeng, didn't even have the Li surname. This, too, was a subtle form of protection.

'It's just some Foundation Establishment-level stuff... It's not worth risking the Purple Mansion Seeds. The ones best suited for this kind of work are Guest Retainers with other surnames, like Ding Weizeng!'

This place was extremely close to the lake. He just had the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger transform into its Mountain Tiger divine ability and carry the message back.

His gaze swept across the Great Void, identifying the attendees one by one. Aside from the few Purple Mansion cultivators who had already been waiting by the shore, all the other major powers had arrived. There were also a few unfamiliar faces, likely from the northern aristocratic families. He just didn't see the newly ascended Si Yuanli, who must not have arrived yet.

In the western clouds stood Qi Lanyan. Slightly ahead of him was Daoist Master Yehui, still riding that crow of his—which might have been a Spiritual Artifact or a spirit embryo. When he saw Li Ximing look over, he nodded with a smile.

This Yehui was a scheming man. Back when he decided to wade into these muddy waters and defect to the north, he had paid the Li family a visit. Li Ximing hadn't understood why at the time, but thinking back, Yehui must have used that visit to make it clear he bore no enmity and wanted to settle old grudges, all to avoid becoming a casualty of the conflict between north and south.

A little further away, an aqua-robed woman stood quietly, saying nothing. Her eyes, gazing over from afar, were filled with complex emotions.

When her gaze met Li Ximing's, her lips parted slightly, and she sighed, lowering her eyes.

"Daoist Brother Zhaojing..." Li Ximing's thoughts were interrupted by Daoist Master Tianhuo, who spoke in a low, mysterious tone. "Look to the north."

Li Ximing looked over. Two divine abilities were floating in the north, radiating light. One was a murky white, the other a hazy fog. Just looking at them made him feel uncomfortable.

Daoist Master Tianhuo whispered, "That's Gongsun Bei, who cultivates Dawn Qi, and Zong Chang of the Great Zhao imperial court, who cultivates Veiled Yin. Your noble clan must be wary of those two."

Li Ximing felt a chill. As the two appeared, he saw that Gongsun Bei was tall and imposing, wearing armor and carrying a crimson axe. His gaze was like a sword, and a scar marked his face. He did not look like someone to be trifled with.

"Dawn Qi..." Ever since he began cultivating, Li Ximing had heard that his own Dao Lineage feared Dawn Qi, so he had always paid it special attention. He had only ever heard that the Golden Feather Sect had a powerful Dawn Qi Dao Lineage. Now, finally seeing a Dawn Qi Purple Mansion cultivator, he frowned.

Zong Chang wore a python robe. She was short, with the face of a woman, but though her features were elegant, her aura was one of deceit and danger, twisting her entire appearance. She was staring at him intently. The long, male-style robe pooled at her feet, and beneath it, deathly pale skin was visible. Several glistening black venomous bees flapped their wings, crawling and flying in the robe's shadows.

Daoist Master Tianhuo frowned, whispering, "The Veiled Yin cultivates in groups. They favor debauchery and proliferation. Their true forms resemble shrews. Those who cultivate the upper-body aspects resemble bees and ants; those who cultivate the lower-body aspects give birth to a hundred evils... This person has cultivated to the point where hardly anyone normal is left in the Zhao court."

He whispered, "Do you know of Maha Taixi? Before defecting to the Buddhists, he also cultivated Veiled Yin. If you trace the lineage, he would be her Martial Uncle."

Li Ximing nodded grimly. Daoist Master Tianhuo shook his head. "Her cultivation art is special. She will eventually defect to the Buddhists as well; it's been this way for generations. They exhaust their use, feeding on the Fuqi's destiny to transform into Buddhists... Because of this, even though she looks like a cultivator now, you can consider her one of the Buddhist cultivators."

"As for Gongsun Bei... he's just a dog raised by the great families."

Li Ximing finally had a clear picture. "The north is truly a chaotic mess."

"Isn't it?" Daoist Master Tianhuo shook his head slightly. "Although the Great Zhao is just an empty shell, it's a very useful shell. Countless factions are mixed together inside it, all intertwined. It's nothing like the south."

He said with deep meaning, "The Yue State, however, is no 'empty shell'."

As they spoke, the Great Void began to tremble violently. Dazzling streams of white and purple light fell from the sky, weaving together. A chain of Daoist temples emerged from the distance, its shadow slowly solidifying in the Great Void.

This stretch of temples had a circular border. It scraped against the fabric of the Great Void at high speed, erupting in brilliant golden sparks, only to be expelled by the Great Void and rain down upon the mortal world's Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter.

A golden rain began to fall on the bone-covered hills. Li Ximing glanced at it. It was 'Spirit-Mausoleum Gold,' a Wandering Metal-path material, at the Qi Refining level. Incredibly precious for rogue cultivators. A scramble immediately broke out below.

As he observed, several streaks of light sped over from the lake. Li Ximing glanced down. The Heavenly Light shone, and he gave a few orders. Daoist Master Tianhuo nodded with a smile. As expected, several Golden Feather Sect cultivators flew over to greet his group. Li Ximing looked closely and, sure enough, Su Yan was among them.

Although this was just a game being played by Purple Mansion cultivators, Li Ximing remained cautious. He gently stroked his waist, unfastening the azure and yellow Reveal River, and gave it a few commands. The item immediately vanished from the Great Void.

"Weizeng, if you run into trouble in the Mystic Realm, use the spirit embryo to suppress them."

Ding Weizeng was standing amidst the roiling white mist, speaking gravely with the Golden Feather Sect man. Hearing the voice from the sky, he quickly bowed. "I receive the Daoist Master's immortal decree!"

At his words, everyone present, from both the Li family and the Golden Feather Sect, bowed their heads respectfully. Daoist Master Tianhuo saw this and smiled. "Zhaojing truly dotes on his juniors."

Li Ximing turned his head and said quietly, "For a hundred years, my family has only been able to watch others play their hands, fearing their hidden cards. Things are different now. This is why we achieve divine abilities—so our descendants can have hidden cards of their own, so they have backing, and so they can stand proudly alongside the descendants of other immortal lines, not just surviving by being fierce and ruthless."

Daoist Master Tianhuo's smile faded. He seemed to recall something, and a complex look crossed his face. He said wistfully, "Once you reach this level... the chance to survive by being fierce and ruthless... is a luxury you can no longer afford."

Li Ximing was silent. The two tacitly dropped the subject and focused their attention on the Mystic Realm before them.

Li Ximing activated his divine ability, infusing his Heavenly Light. As the Mystic Realm destabilized and briefly connected with the outside world, he peered inside. The hazy colors faded, revealing elegant, densely packed immortal pavilions. At the highest point was a great purple hall with golden characters written above its entrance:

"Nanxiang Hall."

Although it was just a glimpse, all the divine ability cultivators saw it clearly and began to whisper among themselves. Daoist Master Tianhuo said softly, "As expected. It's one of the Nanxiang Daoist traditions."

Li Ximing looked at him. Tianhuo explained, "The Three Profounds are all the same. The direct lineages are few and far between. Encompassing Profoundity is in decline and not well-known now, but many of its ancient branches were famous. Those still famous today... in order... are the Northern Palace Divine Thunder, the Aegis of the Transverse Dam, the Four Secrets of Nanxiang..."

"No need to say more about the Thunder Palace; it's the pinnacle of Encompassing Profoundity. Everyone knows it, though it's not seen now. The Aegis of the Transverse Dam cultivates Azure Manifestation; Dams-Goat Temple Palace belongs to them. The remaining 'Four Secret Dao Lineages' we often mention are, in fact, these Four Secrets of Nanxiang."

With this explanation, Li Ximing finally connected the dots. He had just heard about the Hongxue Dao Lineage. He counted on his fingers, "Secret Diffusion, Secret Enclosure, Secret Elevated... That still leaves one missing."

At his words, Daoist Master Tianhuo first nodded, seemingly surprised he knew of "Secret Elevated." But when he heard the end, he couldn't help but laugh out loud. "Daoist Brother, you can't see the forest for the trees..."

Li Ximing's interest was piqued. Daoist Master Tianhuo continued to scan the Mystic Realm with his divine ability as he said leisurely, "This last lineage... one of its branches was active along the riverbanks for many years. In ancient times, they even lived in the Moongaze Marsh! Although the Dao Lineage moved away long ago, some of the names for people and places were left behind... right in your territory, Daoist Brother!"

Li Ximing froze. He thought back to the names around the lake and said in disbelief, "Milin Prefecture... Secret Forest?!"

Daoist Master Tianhuo laughed. "Precisely!"

This Daoist Master Tianhuo was famously playful and loved seeing this exact look of dawning realization. His fun having been satisfied, he seemed to be in an even better mood. "And you still have the empty shell of the Six Xin Harmonising Metal Talisman, don't you!"

That single sentence perfectly revealed the Golden Feather Sect's all-encompassing surveillance. A chill crept into Li Ximing's heart. He replied, surprised, "I do!"

The Six Xin Harmonising Metal Talisman in the Li family's possession had long since been stripped of its essence, leaving only a patterned shell. Although the material itself might have some value, it no longer held any wondrous power.

Li Zhouwei had mentioned this to him before. The greatest value of the empty shell wasn't the remaining spiritual materials, but the intricate patterns carved into it that had once manifested its power. The reason it was kept hidden in the clan was for this very purpose—if a promising junior appeared in the future, or if Jiangzong's artifact refining skills reached a high enough level, they could study the shell to create an imitation, much like their Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman.

Daoist Master Tianhuo brought this up and smiled. "The Twelve Profound Talismans are possessions of Encompassing Profoundity. The Jiang family's ancestors were from the Ning State and received the Secret Forest Dao Lineage. This is the reason why the Six Xin Harmonising Metal Talisman was able to find its way into the hands of the Milin Jiang family! Do you understand now, Daoist Brother?"

His revelation about the "Twelve Profound Talismans" was like a sudden enlightenment, clearing Li Ximing's mind.

'Of course! No wonder... no wonder. The clues were there all along. Our own Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman imitates the "Six Shocks Profound Thunder Talisman" from the Dao of Thunder-Guiding and Cloud-Anchoring. That Dao Lineage originated from the Dams-Goat Temple Palace, which is also Encompassing Profoundity!!'

'And that's why the "Six Ding Merging Fire Talisman"—which was so famous on Crimson Reef Island and later obtained by the Dragon-Slaying Senior—was given by the Dragon-kin to Guo Shentong, who came from an Encompassing Profoundity Grotto-Heaven. It was a return of a lineage item...'

Li Ximing never would have dreamed this could be connected to his own family. He stood stunned for several seconds, but as he thought it through, the pieces slowly fit together.

'The Chongming Profund Insight Screen we got from the Great Ning Palace was inscribed with "Jiang Bing" and "Chen Xuanli." This is proof the Jiang Clan came from Jiangbei. When the Ning State fell, the Jiang, Chen, Li, and even the Azure Pond's Si family were all scattered... all of them deeply connected to Encompassing Profoundity...'

"Thank you for the guidance, Daoist Brother!" Li Ximing said with genuine sincerity. Just then, the Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter filled with a purple haze, and golden clouds appeared as the Mystic Realm finally landed, releasing a boundless surge of spiritual energy.

"The Mystic Realm has stabilized!"

At that moment, Daoist Master Tianque, who had been silent, quietly raised his head. The Dharma mirror in his hand reflected a faint purple light, casting it into the Great Void. This made Daoist Master Tianhuo smile.

"Fellow Daoists! There is a treasure in this Nanxiang Hall... Let's make it a prize. We shall see who it's fated to fall to!"

The assembled divine ability cultivators sneered or nodded, each sending their juniors into the realm. Daoist Master Tianhuo also raised his hand and looked at Li Ximing with a smile. "We'll help each other, but there's no need to drop them in the same place. We wouldn't want to reduce our gains."

Li Ximing naturally understood. Though they were allies, they should split up upon entering to maximize their profits. He agreed softly, watching as Tianhuo gently sent his juniors in.

Li Ximing, however, was laughing inwardly. On the surface, he pretended to close his eyes and concentrate, casually tearing open a rift in the Great Void as if he had no interest in what was inside. But secretly, he had already begun to focus his spirit.

'Li Clan disciple Ximing respectfully requests the Immortal Mirror to patrol the shadows and seek the minute, to see through the profound, to illuminate the eight directions, to capture ghosts and investigate spirits...'
