# Chapter 504: Hengzhu Dao

Li Xijun and Kongheng rode the wind southward, traversing through Mushroom Forest Plain with Li Xuanxuan flying closely behind them.

Suddenly, Li Xijun recalled something and pulled Kongheng aside. "Master Monk, since you're using Thunderpool as an opportunity to cultivate, why didn't you mention it earlier?" he whispered.

"I have heard that Jiangnan was dangerous so I truly didn't dare to take the risk as my cultivation technique is of a high grade. While your esteemed family suspects I harbor ill intentions, I'm also afraid you might rob me and kill me..." Kongheng admitted, rubbing his smooth bald head.

He opened his narrow eyes and let out a sigh before continuing, "Allow me to clarify, fellow Daoist... The cultivation method I practice requires the nine thunders of heaven and earth. However, the fruition attainment of this cultivation technique is still suspended between heaven and earth, and the thunders I require are difficult to locate. Only when a thunder cultivator breaks through can one of the nine thunders be born during the establishment of the immortal foundation.

"Before the elder of my temple passed away, he spent a considerable time deducing the future and finally learned that one of these thunders would be born in Jiangnan within the next hundred years. He advised me to come here and also predicted a calamity that could help hone my mind..."

He then lowered his gaze, adding softly, "Fellow Daoist Yuanjiao always doubts me, but to be honest... My Liao River Temple is even worse off than your esteemed family. After the Abbot's passing... I've felt like a lost dog, with nowhere to turn."

Li Xijun nodded slightly, feeling a sense of alertness rise within him. "How long has it been since the elder of your esteemed temple passed away?" he asked.

"It has been... more than forty years," Kongheng replied.

Li Xijun calculated silently, realizing that this was around the time when Lingyanzi from the Purple Smoke Gate fled to his home, where his ancestor rescued him and their family acquired the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique.

"More than forty years... Jiangnan now has several thunder cultivators. If this is part of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's scheme, it must have been laid down more than forty years ago..."

Although Li Xijun had never seen Lingyanzi, he had read about him in the Family History and knew that Li Tongya was the one who dealt with him back then.

Lingyanzi... could not have deceived the ancestor. This means Lingyanzi might be unaware that he has inadvertently become someone else's pawn... Purple Smoke Gate... Could this be the scheme of their Daoist Master?

He then asked, "Master Monk, do you know of Thundercloud Temple?"

Kongheng shook his head slightly, indicating that he did not know. Li Xijun contemplated this information.

It seems I must find an opportunity to visit the Purple Smoke Gate and speak with Lingyanzi, he resolved silently.

Li Xijun guessed the worst possible scenario and thought to himself, The abbot of the Liao River Temple likely deduced that Lingyanzi and the others would bring this item from Thundercloud Temple, so he sent Kongheng out into the mountains!

As Li Xijun mulled over this silently, they had already passed through Changxiao Gate's Helin Prefecture. They landed in the mountains at the other end of the prefecture and took a brief respite.

Li Xijun harnessed the power of his eye technique and noted the swirling snow qi as he surveyed the landscape. He then said softly, "This should be the place. We just crossed Mount Quanwu, and ahead lies the Helin Mountain Range, where the earth veins converge and several types of water veins described in the Chilling Snow Series meet."

The purpose of this trip was a mix of both truth and deception; on the surface, Li Xijun was here to gather cold water.

Li Xuanxuan wore a gray coat and followed behind with a stern expression.

Kongheng gazed at the beauty of the mountains and rivers before him, exclaiming, "Jiangnan is indeed rich in water veins!"

Li Xijun nodded in agreement, then turned to Li Xuanxuan and said respectfully,

"Granduncle, you've also read the Chilling Snow Series while on the way here. The Helin Mountain Range is vast. We should split up to search for it; we might find it sooner that way."

Li Xuanxuan nodded at the suggestion. Li Xijun then looked at Kongheng and said, "Although the spiritual energy in the Helin Mountain Range isn't particularly strong, and there are no famous spirit items or demonic creatures, there may still be some roaming devil cultivators. I would appreciate it if Master Monk could keep an eye out for them while my granduncle and I scout the area."

"Sure," Kongheng replied.

Seeing that Li Xijun was acting thoughtfully and methodically, Li Xuanxuan nodded approvingly before choosing a direction to start his search.

After watching him leave, Li Xijun turned to Kongheng, saying, "Master Monk, please keep an eye on my family's elder while I head to Hengdong Prefecture."

Kongheng nodded in agreement and offered him a few words of advice.

Li Xijun then rode the wind northward, passing through the two large mountains of the Helin Mountain Range as he made his way to Hengdong Prefecture of the Hengzhu Dao Gate.

As soon as he flew out of Helin Prefecture, he was greeted by a vast plain that was peppered with clusters of buildings and pavilions of various sizes. Hengdong Prefecture was a large place with millions of inhabitants, overseen by Hengzhu Dao Gate for many years, making it one of the most affluent prefectures in Yue State.

After flying for a while and taking in the view of the expansive and fertile fields around him, Li Xijun felt puzzled.

"Hengzhu Dao Gate... has no immortal mountain?" he wondered aloud.

As he was contemplating this, a figure approached from the front, gliding effortlessly on a cloud. Dressed in white adorned with gold and red cloud patterns, the person had thin lips and large eyes below long brow bones that set him apart from typical Jiangnan people.

"Greetings, fellow Daoist... I am Bi Chengjuan from the Hengzhu Dao. May I ask which sect or gate you represent?"

Bi Chengjuan's deep eyes and sharp nose made it difficult to read his expression. After scrutinizing Li Xijun from head to toe, he quickly deduced that Li Xijun did not belong to any of the three sects or seven gates. However, he chose to phrase his question diplomatically.

"Li Xijun of the Qingdu Li Family. I am a humble cultivator from Moongaze Lake," Li Xijun replied warmly.

Bi Chengjuan's surprise was evident as he nodded in acknowledgment and said, "Ah, the Li Family... I saw the surprisingly clear aura in your eyes and thought you hailed from a certain Dao lineage in Wu State."

Li Xijun humbly downplayed the compliment and Bi Chengjuan continued politely, "Have you traveled far to visit us? What brings you here?"

"I've heard that the Hengzhu Immortal Dao possesses the Tranquil Purification Technique, which can eliminate inner demons and resolve mental burdens. I have an elder who is plagued by his own inner demons, so I've come to seek a cure," Li Xijun replied earnestly,

Bi Chengjuan was clearly experienced and was not surprised by such a request.

"I have no issue with helping out another fellow Daoist, but I must clarify one point first..."

He paused before continuing in a serious tone, "The Tranquil Purification Technique is not a superior immortal method; it's only a Grade Five cultivation technique and might not be effective for some inner demons. If you seek a cure, you must prepare for that possibility, fellow Daoist!"

"Of course, I understand that some limitations exist," Li Xijun replied matter-of-factly.

Bi Chengjuan nodded, then apologized for being blunt as he went on to explain, "Over the years, people who were not cured by the spell have blamed the disciples who performed it. Some even blamed the Hengzhu Dao... Our Dao has faced criticism over the years so we have no choice but to exercise extra caution."

Seeing Bi Chengjuan's demeanor, Li Xijun felt more positive about him.

This Hengzhu Dao is quite different from Azure Pond; it surpasses all the other gates in the northern part of Yue State... That's truly rare!

After clearing the air, Bi Chengjuan warmed up a lot more, smiling as he asked, "This is your first time visiting Hengzhu Dao, right?"

"That's correct," Li Xijun replied.

Bi Chengjuan explained, "The Hengzhu Dao has a long history. Over generations, we have been known simply as Hengzhu Dao. However, some busybodies later began categorizing various institutions into sects and gates, which led people to refer to us as Hengzhu Dao Gate. This term gradually became widespread, making it difficult to change."

He looked somewhat frustrated as he continued, "The Daoists from the north all refer to us as a Dao Sect. In truth, it is not so. My Hengzhu Dao cannot be compared to Azure Pond or Golden Feather. Although we all follow the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, Hengzhu Dao follows the path of ancient cultivation!"

Li Xijun listened attentively as Bi Chengjuan continued explaining in detail, "To be honest, the cultivation methods of my Dao are closer to those of the Great Xiukui Temple in the east. Both Hengzhu Dao and Xikui Dao were established many years ago as sub-mansions of the Moonlight Immortal Mansion."

He chuckled lightly and said, "Because of this, the Great Xiukui Temple is also facing the same situation and is frequently referred to as the Xikui Dao Gate. The Daoists there are much more ferocious, they'll give anyone who referred to them with the wrong name a good beating."

Li Xijun nodded thoughtfully, noting that Bi Chengjuan seemed to care a lot about speeches. He then looked at the faces of those under the rule of Hengzhu and praised, "Your esteemed Dao is indeed quite ancient!"

"Don't mention it..." Bi Chengjuan replied sadly before changing the subject by asking, "Could you please stay for a few days? I need to return to set up the formation and prepare the necessary pills."

"Of course... how many Spirit Stones will that be?" Li Xijun replied, cupping his fist.

Bi Chengjuan remained polite, but his price was firm.

"Only fifty Spirit Stones will do," he replied.

Li Xijun felt a twinge of pain at the cost but had no choice but to nod in agreement. He took out twenty-five Spirit Stones from his storage pouch as a deposit before taking to the wind again.

Once outside the Hengzhu's territory, Li Xijun grew anxious, unsure of how to bring this up to Li Xuanxuan. His granduncle had been in a position of power for a long time, and although he now bore the weight of spiritual turmoil, he still looked intimidating whenever he wore a stern expression on his face.

Upon landing in Helin Mountain Range again, Li Xijun took out the jade pendant and tried locating his granduncle and the monk. However, the distance between them was probably too great so he could not pinpoint his exact location. After circling around, he finally found them.

He saw Li Xuanxuan standing by a small hill, silently casting spells, while Kongheng stood beside him, guarding him. Li Xijun approached and scanned the terrain with the secret technique in the Chilling Snow Series.

He felt a rush of joy and exclaimed, "So, there is indeed cold water hidden in the water vein underneath here!"

The two performed a series of hand seals and worked together for a while, causing the ground to tremble slightly as a crack as big as a hole the size of a baby's mouth was created in it. Shimmering blue water surged forth, and Li Xijun quickly took out a jade bottle to collect it.

"It's Forest Cold Water... capable of nourishing true essence with cold qi," he remarked.

This spirit water of heaven and earth, while not particularly rare, was located at the intersection of the earth veins. Compared to the Heavenly Pure Essence, it hardly measured up to it.

Yet for Li Xijun, it was a treasure—it could be used to refine true essence and practice the Slaughter Jun Kui Light. He stored it away carefully, feeling his mood improving significantly.

A rare smile also appeared on Li Xuanxuan's face as he suggested, "I'm lucky to have found it so quickly. It's only been a day; we can find some more to keep at home..."

Li Xijun apologized first, then got on his knees and said, "I've heard that Hengzhu Dao has methods to exorcize demons... Why don't we go and take a look first, then come back to search for more?"

Li Xuanxuan glared at him and shouted, "No! What's the big deal? I'll just take two pills before drawing talismans as I usually do... That has always worked!"

Li Xijun gritted his teeth and said firmly, "I have already flown to Hengdong Prefecture and paid the fee earlier. Please come with me, Granduncle."

"YOU!"

It was only at this moment that realization dawned upon Li Xuanxuan. He was too stunned to speak for a moment before finally exclaiming, "I can't believe you and Ming'er are teaming up against me!"

Li Xijun simply bowed his head and replied, "I was too impulsive... If Granduncle refuses to go, everything will be wasted."

Of course, Li Xuanxuan understood what Li Xijun was trying to say. After a long pause, he finally said, "Don't do that again!"

He glanced at Li Xijun then launched into a long-winded lecture about his father, Li Yuanyun, then his grandfather, Li Xuanling, and finally recounted how frugal Li Tongya was when he was still alive—who was too cautious to spend even a single Spirit Stone.

Li Xijun listened silently until he finished speaking before saying, "If Great-grandfather were alive, he wouldn't want to see you torturing yourself like this."

Li Xuanxuan stopped talking immediately and flew in silence for a while. Finally, he murmured, "I didn't notice it back then... If only I could go to Zhenhui Temple in my younger brother's place..."

He turned his head, his aged face stained with tears.

"I, Li Xuanxuan... I will never say another word!"

The old man covered his face and continued lamenting, "I owe him too much... I owe him too much... If Brother Ling were alive, he would have reached the Foundation Establishment Realm by now, unlike me... I am useless! As a result, your father died right in front of me, and I fled alone! How can I face you?! How can I face him?! It would be better for me to die!"

Li Xijun was moved and tried to comfort him, saying, "But our family is doing a lot better now..."

Kongheng, who was standing nearby, had always been an empathetic person. Hearing the old man's distress, he thought to himself, I always thought Li Xuanxuan was a pedantic and stubborn old man... I never realized there was such a story behind him. Clearly, my cultivation is still lacking...

The three of them rode the wind toward the territory of Hengzhu Dao. Bi Chengjuan quickly approached, sweeping his gaze over the three men before eyeing Kongheng warily. His tone turned somewhat cold as he asked, "Where are you from, Master Monk?"

Confused by his attitude, Kongheng replied, "I used to be a Buddhist cultivator from the north but I'm now a guest cultivator of the Li Family."

"Guest cultivator of the Li Family..?"

Bi Chengjuan's expression darkened, but fortunately, he did not show hostility immediately. He merely continued coldly, "Ah yes, Moongaze Lake is near the Great River... I supposed it isn't surprising that the Li Family would take in a few monks."

Sensing the tense atmosphere, Li Xijun quickly clarified, "This is Master Monk Kongheng from Liao River Temple. He practiced in Mobei and followed ancient Buddhist cultivation techniques, strictly adhering to the precepts... Please forgive any misunderstandings..."

Bi Chengjuan realized his mistake and his expression finally softened as he sighed and apologized, "I was too impulsive... I'm truly sorry!"

With a mournful face, he continued, "Many years ago, Murong Xia traveled south, wreaking havoc and eating people everywhere... He even killed my eldest sister! My ancestor fought valiantly, alarming the Azure Pond Sect to intervene, but in the end, nothing came of it."

Bi Chengjuan gritted his teeth and added, "Two of the three Purple Mansions Realm cultivators from my family were dispatched, yet we were still humiliated!"

Master Kongheng then mumbled quietly, "The Murong Family... They seem to practice the Compassion Dharma Form."

"Compassion my ass!"

Bi Chengjuan appeared to be offended by that comment and seethed with anger, saying hatefully, "That Murong Xia killed my eldest sister! H-He... even allowed her soul to appear and persuade my ancestor... Can you believe such a thing is possible in this world?!"

Li Xijun felt a pang of grievance at this revelation, secretly astonished by the strength of the Murong Family.

Hengzhu Dao's Purple Mansion Realm cultivator actually endured such humiliation...?

Bi Chengjuan sighed, then apologized again for letting his emotions get the better of him. He took out five shimmering golden pills from his chest pocket and then said softly, "Please prepare yourself, fellow Daoist..."

He then pulled out a jade knife and explained in a dull tone, "These are body pills that correspond to the five acupoints of the mind... It is part of the ancient cultivation method. I'll cut open your skin and flesh, insert the pills, and then use a secret technique to seal the wounds."

Noticing the surprised expressions on the faces of those around him, he explained, "These pills are engraved with tiny formations. When you enter my Dao's Tranquil Profound Conversion Formation shortly, they will dissolve naturally and help eliminate your inner demons."
