# Chapter 1193: Demoting the Final Tower

A stream of Pure Qi surged forth, and the swirling azure and white energies below it instantly shuddered. They split apart, warring against each other as Li Que'wan steadied her divine ability once more, her hands forming the seals of an ancient incantation.

The Elucidating Profundity Bestowed Jade Method!

As this marvelous art, a direct legacy of the Three Profoundities, began to circulate, the twin streams of azure and white qi boiling ceaselessly within the treasured cauldron seemed to find an outlet. They burst forth and shattered into a brilliant expanse of Supreme Yin radiance. An unknown amount of time passed before Li Que'wan finally felt the balance of yin and yang within the cauldron tip. A crisp crack, like shattering glass, echoed in her ears.

The floor of azure and white energy began to trickle like morning dew forming a stream, which in an instant erupted into a torrential flood. Scorching moonlight blazed as if a rainbow were drinking from the sea, and Li Que'wan felt her divine ability and dharma power plummet at a terrifying rate, draining the color from her face.

'This is bad!'

Without a moment's hesitation, she produced a brilliantly colored spirit pill. Li Ximing often gained surplus pills when refining them for others. Years ago, when he traveled to the Western Sea, he had refined a Precious Heart Mystic Swan Pill for a wandering cultivator. The pill was meant to help the woman achieve a breakthrough, but after hearing of the wondrous uses of her 'Awaiting the Supreme Divine' ability, Li Ximing had gifted it to her instead.

Now, with her own power being consumed so violently, Li Que'wan couldn't afford to be frugal. She swallowed the pill in one gulp. The cascade of moon-dew reversed its course, swirling back into the cauldron. The violent fluctuations of her divine ability made the mystic cauldron groan under the strain. She urgently pushed with her spiritual sense, and the Spiritual Treasure hanging high above descended, casting down a crimson light that scattered its mysterious power and stabilized the vessel.

After some time, the sound of rushing water finally quieted. Li Que'wan dared not relax. She took out a host of materials—alchemical reagents like golden sand, liquid mercury, Cinnabar, and gemstones. Their colors were varied, but their spiritual qi was almost undetectable, like materials typically used by cultivators in the Embryonic Breathing or Qi Refining realms. The most valuable among them was merely a treasured herb suitable for the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Yet, as these unremarkable items were tossed into the cauldron, the churning water began to congeal. Before long, a bright moon was suddenly reflected in the cauldron's shimmering, watery depths, followed by the tinkling sound of glass falling to the floor.

Li Que'wan didn't dare let her guard down. She cradled the cauldron, gently nurturing it for over a month before she finally allowed herself to breathe. She tapped it lightly, listening to the echo, then formed a seal and produced a jade slip from her robes.

'Extract lead and add mercury, the nine returns are done. With the three yins expended, who can say the work is done?' she recited internally.

She waited for three breaths. Seeing no ominous signs from the spell, she slapped the jade slip against the cauldron's body three times. The divine ability sealing the lid shattered along with the slip. As jade powder rained down, a clean fragrance washed over her. A dense pulse of spiritual energy surged out, only to be continuously quelled by the perfectly balanced yin-yang atmosphere of the grotto-heaven.

This spiritual pulse was terrifyingly potent. Even within this impossibly dense spiritual environment, it advanced with irresistible force, bursting from the cauldron and slamming against the windowsill of the small courtyard. The doors flew open, the entire frame shaking, and even the lamps on either side of the entrance flickered.

Outside, Li Jiangqian, who had been cultivating with his eyes closed, was jolted awake. A trace of worry flickered in his golden eyes as his form dissolved into a wave of roiling Li Fire that stopped just before the window.

"How is it?" he asked.

He was answered by his kinswoman's joyous cry.

"Brother… it's a wondrous treasure!"

Amid the brilliant white light, a lotus of Pure Qi leaped out.

The lotus was as large as a basin, with six petals as white as peonies. Its stem shimmered with seven colors that shifted and flowed without end. Though it was clearly a treasure condensed from Pure Qi, it looked as delicate as a new spring onion, so fragile a breath could break it.

Li Que'wan gently took it and, after a moment's inspection, her lovely features overflowed with delight. She turned, only to find that her Great-Granduncle had also descended from the pavilion. She hurriedly bowed.

"A treasure of Pure Qi," she announced, "the Five-Dredging Lotus Radiance!"

A strange light danced in Li Ximing's eyes.

"So there really is Pure Qi," he replied. "And it's a spiritual item!"

The joy in Li Que'wan's eyes deepened, quickly followed by profound shock. 

"I've only read about this in ancient texts. This… this isn't a spiritual lotus that grew naturally. It's a manifestation of spiritual qi that has absorbed the essence of heaven and earth and condensed on its own!"

Li Ximing frowned at her words.

"Just spiritual qi?"

The young woman paused, then instantly understood and smiled.

"Greate-granduncle, you only know half the story. The usual ranking of spiritual qi, spiritual resources, and spiritual items doesn't really apply to Pure Qi. Every Pure Qi spiritual item in this world shares a common trait: it is perfectly balanced and aligned with one's life-mandate, without flaw!"

"Take Supreme Yin for example. Supreme Yin Moon Radiance is of a higher grade, while Profound Minister Moon Essence is denser in spiritual energy. But for Pure Qi, its spiritual potency is always perfectly proportional to its grade. This holds true for everything from the world-rare Five-Dredging Lotus Radiance to the commonplace Lesser Clear Spirit Qi."

Realization dawned on Li Ximing, and he nodded slowly.

The woman continued with a smile, "In the ancient Immortal Dao's Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature, the 'qi' they originally referred to was Pure Qi. It was known as the Mother of All Qi, the Master of All Profundities!"

"And this Five-Dredging Lotus Radiance has exactly that effect! The five dredgings pertain to the body, soul, nature, life-mandate, and apertures. When this Pure Qi is consumed, all five are cleansed and revitalized, gradually returning to their primordial state!"

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian's expression grew serious.

"It can repair the Dharma Body and restore one's life-mandate," he murmured, "but it can also affect the ever-mysterious soul?!"

Seeing Li Que'wan nod, his heart soared. He mulled it over, a strange feeling prickling at him.

"Apertures?" he repeated.

Li Que'wan's expression was complicated.

"Your guess is correct, brother."

The confirmation made Li Jiangqian's face twist into an odd expression. Li Que'wan sighed with a hint of helplessness.

"The aperture it dredges is, of course, a spiritual aperture! If a mortal were to consume this, the first four dredgings would have no effect, but the fifth would grant them a spiritual aperture, allowing them to cultivate just like a Purple and Gold cultivator!"

Though their own family's Talisman Seed had the miraculous ability to open the path of cultivation for those who couldn't, its use was reserved for the exceptionally gifted, most of whom already possessed spiritual apertures. This was the first time the Li family had ever obtained a spiritual item with such an effect.

Li Jiangqian didn't respond, instead looking discreetly toward Li Ximing. Li Que'wan caught his glance and understood instantly. She realized her great-granduncle had been silent for some time.

"Daoist Master…" she began softly.

A bitter look crossed Li Ximing's face.

"Among the world's great cultivators, many have had mortal descendants," he said quietly. "I'm not the only one with such regrets. There was Li Chengzhi… and others. Years ago… I had an uncle who died of melancholy. And even before that… alas…"

The old Daoist Master's gaze was complex.

"The truth is, whether it was my uncle or Li Chengzhi later on, the family knew they were secretly searching for any method that could grant a mortal a spiritual aperture. Even my own great-grandfather has been keeping an eye out for years. In the two centuries our family has been established on this island, the number of people who have searched for such a thing… if not ten thousand, then at least a thousand."

"And now we've found it… but…" Li Ximing let out a long, soft sigh. "They knew it would be precious, but they could never have imagined it would be so rare that ninety percent of Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters couldn't obtain it even if they begged… They struggled their entire lives for nothing… dreamed their entire lives for nothing!"

Li Jiangqian remained silent, his eyes fixed on the spiritual item.

Li Que'wan sighed.

"Besides the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed, this junior has heard of one other item that can open spiritual apertures for mortals: a type of Treasured Qi. But it vanished from the world long ago."

Li Ximing seemed unwilling to dwell on the topic and waved his hand. Li Que'wan understood and formed another seal. The hazy white light atop the cauldron was swept away by a mercury-like tide of her divine ability, and from within, a flash of azure blue was drawn out.

It was six finger-sized azure jade beads, each shrouded in hazy moonlight and radiating waves of chilling qi. If not for the dense, perfectly balanced spiritual energy of this place, they would have likely triggered a snowstorm.

'A Supreme Yin spiritual resource!' Li Que'wan thought. 'Six of them!'

She immediately took out a jade box and gathered them with her divine ability. Li Ximing, comparing them to the texts of the Chunyi Dao Gate, quickly identified them, his face filled with astonishment.

"This is the Revering Radiance Moon Vein!" he exclaimed. "The scriptures of the Chunyi Dao Gate record that when a Woven Jade cultivator achieves the Dao, heaven and earth sense the Supreme Yin Fruition Attainment and bestow this item. It can be consumed to dissolve karma. In ancient times, it was the main ingredient for the 'Moon Medicines' and 'Cold Stones' that Woven Jade Immortals often gifted to their subordinates!"

His mastery of the Dao of alchemy was profound; the moment the beads touched his hand, he understood their medicinal properties. He let out a breath of pure delight.

"With this, success is virtually guaranteed."

But the boiling white light in the cauldron had still not dissipated. As Li Que'wan reined in her divine ability, one more object leaped out. It flowed like water, drifting on white smoke, until it was suppressed by the Spiritual Treasure and delivered before the three Daoist Masters.

'Oh?'

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. The object before him seemed like water, but was not water; like jade, but not jade. The more he looked, the stranger it appeared. He studied it for a long while but couldn't identify it. Meanwhile, Li Que'wan, whose spell had not yet fully dispersed, cried out urgently, "Brother!"

Li Jiangqian immediately raised his hand. A torrent of divine ability, bright as a column of light, surged forth, just managing to pin down a wisp of soft, white moonlight that was trying to slip away from the cauldron's rim.

'There's more?!'

A wave of joy washed over Li Ximing, mixed with dawning excitement.

'Truly worthy of being the Final-Tower Sinking Primal!'

The Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument, empowered by the Great Parting Scripture, already possessed the ability to bind and restrain. No matter how miraculous this escapee was, it was forced to return under the Spiritual Treasure's suppression.

"So the 'Whole Pill' realm grants such heaven-defying abilities," Li Jiangqian said with a teasing smile. "It's enough to make me envious!"

While Li Ximing was reveling in the surprise, Li Que'wan, now breathing a little heavily after retracting her spell, recognized the water-like, jade-like object in his hand. Her brow furrowed.

"Great-Granduncle… that is an item of the Lesser Yang."

Li Ximing started, then looked closer.

"It really is…" he frowned. "Strange… how did something of the Lesser Yang emerge from a refinement of Supreme Yin?"

Logically, the Art of Demoting Yin was a process of converting between higher and lower forms of Supreme Yin. The Final-Tower Sinking Primal was not mentioned in any records, so producing Pure Qi or even the three types of yin was something Li Ximing could comprehend. But for an item of the Lesser Yang to appear left him baffled.

"No wonder it didn't look like anything I know… Perhaps the Final-Tower Sinking Primal exceeded the limits of the Art of Demoting Yin, and with a 'Whole Pill' cultivator like you present, some unexpected transformation occurred…"

This was a matter for Li Que'wan to ponder. Li Ximing simply took the object and asked about it. The young woman roused from her thoughts and said seriously,

"This object appears to be water, but it is actually light. It is the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance of the Lesser Yang. It can confound the spirit, trap wonders, and ward off disaster. It is exceedingly rare. Within any Lesser Yang Dao Lineage, it would be considered a treasure no less valuable than my Six-Aspect Ceremonial Hue!"

Hearing the effects of the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance, Li Ximing's mind began to race.

'It can confound spirits and ward off disaster. If the opportunity arises, I can use this to create a grand array! If not… there is still Cang Tiaozi of the World's Navel…'

The Lesser Yang treasure they had acquired from the Western Sea years ago, the Supreme Eaves Radiance, had been traded away to Cang Tiaozi. His Dao lineage was desperately trying to collect Lesser Yang spiritual items and seemed quite hard-pressed. Even if Li Ximing pressed for a favorable deal, Cang Tiaozi would likely agree.

He had already mentally assigned the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance to the great array on the Western Mountains. Meanwhile, Li Jiangqian retrieved the soft white light from the Spiritual Treasure. Li Que'wan glanced at it and sighed with regret.

"This is Qi Moon White Dew. It is indeed a Supreme Yin spiritual item… but its properties are mainly defensive. It should be used to forge a protective Spiritual Artifact… What a pity."

Although the Revering Radiance Moon Vein was precious, it was ultimately just a spiritual resource. If this final item had been a primary ingredient for consumption, it would have been perfect for the Li clan's current needs. As it was, the Moon Vein would have to serve as an auxiliary component.

But Li Ximing did not seem too disappointed. He quickly smiled and shook his head.

"One cannot expect everything to go perfectly. We have the Revering Radiance Moon Vein and the Profound Minister Moon Essence, plus the aid of your Spiritual Treasure. King Wei's injuries can most likely be healed… it will just require refining a few more batches of pills."

Li Que'wan nodded, though a hint of guilt remained in her expression.

"It was this junior's lack of consideration and my unrefined divine ability. I lost control midway through the process, and it seems I broke the material down too far. If my power were stronger, I wouldn't have refined it into so many scattered and miscellaneous things…"

Li Ximing laughed heartily.

"In the matters of this world, fortune and misfortune are intertwined. Besides, we still have four portions of the Final-Tower Sinking Primal remaining. After seeing so many fine spiritual items this time, there will surely be more to come. Do not worry!"

He gathered the various treasures and said seriously,

"You have spent too much of your precious time on family matters these past days. This task is complete, leaving only the matter of the god-conferring rite… there are a few things to negotiate at Mount Qusi…"

He trailed off. The youth in crimson robes beside him stepped forward with a smile.

"Since we have sufficient spiritual items, I ask that Great-Granduncle first focus on preparing the medicinal pills for Father. The mundane affairs outside the grotto-heaven can be left to this junior!"

Li Ximing had absolute confidence in Li Jiangqian's abilities.

"True enough," he chuckled. "Your sister's divine ability is unique; she should test all the Spiritual Artifacts in the family's collection. If you can handle matters here, you can decide for yourself what kind of Spiritual Artifact to refine for her. There's no need to ask me."

He delegated several more tasks, but a lingering concern remained.

"Since I achieved my current realm, I have spent many years building our family's reputation. Your father doesn't handle external affairs, so I have managed all our relations. Some who appear close are merely allied by circumstance. Others with whom we have little contact still hold deep bonds of friendship. And then there are a few individuals to whom our ancestors owe debts of gratitude. These relationships must not be neglected."

His words made the young man smile. Li Jiangqian's golden eyes were calm and confident. "Rest assured, Great-Granduncle," he said with a smile. "I have long since committed all those names to heart. I will not make a mistake."
