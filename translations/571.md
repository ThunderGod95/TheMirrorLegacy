# Chapter 883: Scattered Geng, Drifting White

Moongaze Lake.

The sky was bright, while the lake water was clear and crystalline. Qingdu Peak stood tall in the middle of the lake. Stone steps wound up the mountain to the great hall. An old man, wrapped in a gray-blue cloak, paced in slow circles in front of the grand hall.

Li Xuanxuan waited a moment before finally seeing a spear-wielding man land in front of the hall. At the ninth stage of Qi Cultivation Realm, he brought his hands together in salute and said respectfully, "Siwei greets the Lord."

"How is the situation by the shore?" Li Xuanxuan raised him to his feet and hurriedly asked.

This man was none other than the calm and composed An Siwei, son of An Zheyan. The handsome and dignified man replied quietly, "What I saw just now was no illusion. To the north, everything along the river where the Fei Family moved was dyed in crimson, numbering over a million. It was mixed with glazed glass, golden sands, and various treasures, drawing cultivators to scavenge. There were figures everywhere.

"I overheard... those from the north say it was a sign of a fallen Buddhist cultivator."

Li Xuanxuan twirled his beard, heart sinking. He tightened his grip as he replied, "Buddhist cultivators excel in reincarnation. If one has truly fallen, it likely means the battle has reached a critical turning point."

"My lord says the same as well..." An Siwei was clearly referring to Li Xijun, who was still investigating by the shore. Before he finished speaking, frost and snow stirred before the hall, and Li Xijun swept in with the wind, the Han Lin hanging from his waist, his face still slightly pale.

"Xijun!" Li Xuanxuan called out to him.

Li Xijun returned the salute before speaking softly, "Quite a few Master Monks may have fallen. There seems to be some spirit artifact suppressing the riverbank, and the situation looks much better. Earlier there were a few devil cultivators circling around, but now not a single one remains."

He pressed a hand to his sword and took a step forward into the hall. After a moment of thought, he said in interest, "Seems Mount Bianyan may not be such a good place after all. The real experts are full of schemes. If the riverbank is held, then where would the devil cultivators go next?"

Li Xijun’s words eased Li Xuanxuan's mind considerably. The old man raised his brow and looked into the distance as he noticed a surge of silvery-gold aura from the north. He immediately grew alert.

Li Xijun’s perception technique was the most formidable. He had already seen through it. He exhaled lightly, and his eyes glimmered with unusual brilliance. The trace of worry between his brows vanished as he turned back with a smile and said, "It’s a great victory!"

He instantly relaxed inside, loosening the grip on his sword hilt. A new thought arose in his mind, Seems there was truly a scheme at play! But since I’m stationed in the rear, I haven’t heard much. Maybe Chi Zhiyan played a brilliant move... but if it was a scheme by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, then things are about to get very interesting!

Li Xuanxuan still couldn’t clearly see the distant figures, but when he saw thunderous clouds dyed in colorful light and golden aura glowing with Bright Yang as well as heard Li Xijun’s words, his heart relaxed. He had spent half the night anxious, but now his face could not hide the joy.

"The ancestors must be watching over us, this looks like a great victory!"

He gradually recognized his own younger kin, and counted several of them, but he did not see Li Xuanfeng’s figure. Instead, he noticed a man in white armor, around whom the others respectfully gave way as he walked. His status appeared extremely high.

The old man immediately said, "It seems there’s a high-level cultivator as well. That white aura is blinding, I can’t make out his face. We should’ve gone out to greet him earlier, so as not to be disrespectful!"

Li Xijun was briefly surprised, then understood that Li Xuanxuan did not cultivate a perception technique and couldn’t see clearly. He smiled inwardly and nodded solemnly, "It should indeed be more formal. Let us go and greet them together!"

The group rode the wind together to welcome them. Li Xijun stepped slightly ahead of Li Xuanxuan. When he sensed the family jade pendant at his waist glow in response, he was reassured and respectfully stepped aside with a junior’s bow.

Splash...

Li Xuanxuan’s eyes first fell on Li Qinghong, who was always valiant and spirited, though now a trace of worry lingered in her brows. Li Ximing and Li Xizhi were beside her. They looked somewhat worn out but bore no serious injuries.

Only after he calmed himself did he focus on the white-armored cultivator in the center. The man wore a tiger-headed black helmet that extended to his cheeks, and seemed extremely imposing. His pupils were pale, while his hair and beard were jet black. He seemed to be in his prime.

Faint white patterns shimmered across his face and neck, so glaring they made it difficult to look at him directly, let alone observe his features. Li Xuanxuan found his figure vaguely familiar and thought, This golden aura is even colder than my second brother’s Geng Metal. It might be a high-level cultivator of the Dui Metal Dao?

He dared not look further and turned his gaze away, but even before the man arrived, his presence already made everyone feel as if blades were cutting their faces. Li Xuanxuan grew more doubtful, pondering, Could this be a Daoist Master from the Golden Feather Sect? What ties could he possibly have to our family?

When the group finally approached, Li Xijun spoke in a gentle voice, "Greetings to all brothers and elders."

His voice was as clear as ever. Li Ximing and Li Xizhi looked dispirited and did not respond immediately. Even Li Qinghong turned to the man in the center.

Li Xuanxuan was puzzled when he heard a slightly hoarse male voice say, "No need for formalities."

Drip...

A drop of clear dew rolled off Li Xuanxuan’s gray-blue robe. Autumn dew had begun falling all over the lake, its sound crisp and piercing.

The sound made the old man lift his head instantly to meet those eyes. He said in a daze, "Xuanfeng...?!"

The pale patterns on Li Xuanfeng’s face had faded. His eyes were sharp and spirited. Having just slain a host of Buddhist cultivators, his suppressed killing intent had transformed into an indescribably majestic aura. His armor made him look all the more divine, like a celestial general descended from an Immortal Mansion.

Yet his face looked just over thirty. In an instant, Li Xuanxuan was pulled from breathless disbelief back into the past. The old man gave a soft grunt, his face slightly flushed as he said, "Second Brother..."

"Elder Brother." Li Xuanfeng replied softly, and the autumn dew over the lake grew even more intense, like a sudden downpour.

Beside him, Li Qinghong appeared worried and gently said, "Why don’t we head into the peak first..."

Li Xuanxuan, once the head of the family and no ordinary elder, quickly picked up on something from the junior’s expression. He stepped forward swiftly and led the white-armored Li Xuanfeng into the hall.

But his heavy gaze never left his younger brother’s face. His eyes were slightly red, as if studying something closely.

Li Xuanfeng had shed all his youthful arrogance like a divine bow weathered by time, revealing only a perfected essence. It wasn’t just Li Xuanxuan who was stunned, even Li Xuanfeng himself would likely pause if he saw his own reflection!

Li Xuanfeng took his seat and glanced around at the younger generation. After a moment, he brought up a matter in a quiet voice, "Qinghong, that Helian Changguang has been slain by my hand. You need not worry about him anymore."

Li Qinghong’s almond-shaped eyes reddened slightly. She nodded, not interrupting him. Li Xuanfeng’s pupils shifted slightly, and his voice remained calm, "All the Buddhist cultivators along the riverbank were slain, frightening the northern cultivators into retreat. Mount Bianyan sank without a trace. The Chi Family’s direct descendants and forces perished there. Si Yuanli acted under an immortal command and fanned the flames. Though it may appear righteous, enmity between the Si and Chi Families has now taken root.

"If I were to die, the Jiangnan families would surely celebrate. The Azure Pond Sect would fall into the hands of Si Yuanli and Lingu Lanying. Though Si Yuanli has some good in him, he is by no means indecisive. He will act when change comes."

His iron-hard face lacked some of his father’s calm, but it carried the domineering air of one who had slaughtered countless cultivators. His every word was chilling, "The five prefectures are where the Yuan Family once supported the Chi Family. With Yuan Tuan and Yuan Chengdun dead, how can there be no resentment? Huyuan is kind but weak, while Hudu is venomous and ruthless. Should the balance shift, they may not remain loyal.

"The Yu Family was fragmented by the Chi Family. Only Yu Yuwei could have united them, but he died early, so rising again will be near impossible.

"The Lingu Family is deeply entrenched and has long harbored ambitions. They have ruled the Southern Sea for generations and are an esteemed family of Mount Yue, allied by marriage to the Xiukui Family. Si Yuanli will surely court them with favor, and they may serve as his support...

"The Ning Family’s fate hinges on Ning Wan. Ning Heyuan likely has no chance of survival. Since the family will fall to Ning Hejing, they cannot be trusted lightly..."

His gaze swept across the crowd and landed on Li Xizhi. He said quietly, "Xizhi... Our Li Family has labored through three generations to reach the ranks of the Jiangnan families. The Chi Family has grown too large to control. Si Yuanli will surely use you. Handle family affairs on your own initiative."

"Rest assured, Second Great Uncle." The graceful and composed young man nodded, showing his usual poise. He said softly, "I only worry about Uncle Yuanqin..."

"It is of no concern." The white-armored man sat upright and spoke in a low voice, "He knows his limits."

Li Xizhi withdrew thoughtfully. Li Xuanfeng opened his eyes and looked at Li Qinghong, his voice softening, "Qinghong, if I am not around, you alone are best at combat among the family members. Thunder arts are fierce and explosive. Keep to the seas, deter those with ill intent, and do not involve yourself too deeply in the sect’s inner duels."

"Yes," replied Li Qinghong.

Only then did Li Xuanfeng turn to Li Ximing. Li Ximing had always feared him, and kept his head lowered, not daring to speak. The man before him merely asked, "Ximing, how confident are you in reaching the Purple Mansion Realm?"

Li Ximing felt bitter inside, his heart full of sorrow, and answered heavily, "Less than twenty percent."

Li Xuanfeng nodded, and said gently, "That’s already considered good. Don’t rush for quick success... Where is Minghuang?"

"He’s gone to the Eastern Sea, and has yet to return." Li Xijun answered softly.

Li Xuanfeng looked at him and spoke calmly, "You have a true passion for the Sword Dao. It’s a shame our family has held you back. Not everyone is born with the bearing of a sword immortal. Even Wang Xun had to travel the world. You should get out more."

Li Xijun paused slightly, only to see Li Xuanfeng turn to the elder nearby. For the first time, a slight tremor entered his voice, "Xuanling was the same back then. Once is enough, there’s no need for it to happen again.

"Bring the family registry."

Li Xijun immediately withdrew, and before even two seconds passed, he returned with a purple jade slip, along with a book pressed beneath it. Li Xuanfeng took it gently, placed the jade slip casually on the table, and lifted his hand.

Clang...

Golden aura gathered in his hand, condensing into a pen of interwoven gold and silver. He turned to a single page marked 'Uncle Branch,' then flicked the brush across it.

"Li Yuanyu." He handed the items to Li Qinghong and said hoarsely, "You’re the most perceptive of all when it comes to reading people. You saw it clearly. I handled this matter poorly, but I have no more chances. From here on, you must keep a close watch over things..."

Li Xuanfeng exhaled a breath of golden energy and fell silent. After a moment, he unfastened the brocade pouch at his waist, casually lifted its restriction, and gently drew out a white bow with his other hand.

This white bow was forged from transformed Geng Metal. Li Xuanfeng carefully examined the mystic bow that had accompanied him through a lifetime of battle, gently caressing it. The words 'Golden Age' on the bow vanished, shifting and transforming into two new words, 'White Lightning.'

His voice grew gentler as he said, "I wielded gold metal in the rightful position, and finally completed this bow. The rest of my belongings in the storage pouch shall remain with the Yu Family. This celestial bow, let it be passed on to Yuanqin."

Li Qinghong vaguely saw golden sands rolling beneath her feet. Realizing Li Xuanfeng’s time was short, she simply nodded. The white-armored man rose for the final time, silver-white light rippling across his face, and his voice rang out like clashing metal, "In the war between North and South, I killed without count. Murong, Helian, Emptiness, Compassion, all fell to my blade in blood debt...

"Now I enter stillness, and their resentment may rest for a time. Let no younger of the family travel north without reason, lest they fall victim to others. I, Li Xuanfeng, have committed the greatest bloodshed and done much evil. To fall by killing is only just, there is no resentment."

All those beneath the hall bowed their heads as tears streamed down their faces, but the man laughed heartily, pulling the sobbing Li Xuanxuan to his feet. He sent everyone else out of the hall with a light wave of his hand.

The doors slammed shut, and he laughed, "Brother... Our second uncle disliked wine, so the three of us never dared drink much. Now that all is settled, how about one final drink?"

A golden flask appeared in his hand, and he dropped a few glistening Wanglin Blossoms into it. Pouring it into jade cups, he smiled as he filled one for the weeping old man. Though his voice was slightly hoarse, it carried the boldness of one seasoned in war.

"Brother!"

Li Qinghong and the others stood outside the hall. The woman raised tear-filled eyes to see radiant brilliance flooding the entire hall, casting two shadows upon the door.

One brother cried, the other laughed, and their voices rang out. They spoke of green swords and white blades, of casting down fiery clouds, of throwing swords through wood, of youthful daring, of subduing serpents and felling monks, and of moonlit whales sinking beneath the tide...

The two laughed, argued, jested, and gambled with wine. When they spoke of shooting down the Lord of Golden Tang Gate with an arrow, they drank three rounds first, their arrows illuminating Chengshui Tomb, raising their cups in mutual respect.

Then they spoke of tearing apart the Yan State demon general with bare hands. They slammed the table and clinked cups as they told the story of slaying eighteen monks, slaking each toast with a full bowl.

Their laughter even drowned out the sobs outside the hall that echoed through the mountains. Li Xuanxuan had never felt so unrestrained and free. He spoke of things long buried, and Li Xuanfeng before him laughed heartily, bold and unflinching.

But the brilliance within the hall slowly began to fade, though the elder’s voice remained strong, "Xuanfeng! Back then, the seat of leadership... it should have been yours and Xuanling’s!"

Li Qinghong’s tears gradually ceased and her almond eyes fell. Only one shadow remained on the hall doors. Everyone looked up, listening as the old man shouted and cursed, wept and laughed, yet no one ever responded to him again.

Splash...

The autumn dew fell like rain from the sky, urgently drumming against the rooftops. A cold wind swept through the mountains, rustling the leaves with a loud whisper. It passed over everyone present, but not a single person summoned their mana.

The clear, transparent autumn dew rolled down their Dharma robes, circled once or twice in the muddy soil, and gradually gathered into a stream, washing the dirt down the stone steps and leaving behind a patch of cold, pristine clarity.

Li Qinghong lifted her head. The heavy clouds in the sky had scattered. Dusk deepened, stars began to twinkle, and the distant lake roared with waves. A few dark reefs rose from the surface, glinting faintly with metallic light.

She stepped forward quietly and gently pushed the hall doors open. Inside, starlight and moonlight cast a soft, warm glow. The dark-colored steps stood out clearly, and the old man was slumped asleep against a pillar, dressed only in a white inner robe. Thankfully, someone had kindly draped his gray-blue cloak over him.

In front of him was a scene of chaos, as the table was soaked in spilled wine. Yet across from him, everything was neat and tidy. The white bow stood upright by the desk, and a jade cup sat perfectly placed at the edge, filled with clear wine that reflected the moonlight, as if untouched.

A single Wanglin Blossom floated in the wine.

Her gaze slowly moved across the dark table. The only source of light in the grand hall was a charm, two fingers wide, placed on the corner of the desk, etched with intricate patterns. Everything was clean and orderly, as though the host had simply stepped away.

Li Qinghong did not step inside. She knelt lightly outside the door, her voice slightly muffled, and murmured softly, "Second uncle..."
