# Chapter 700: Take Action

Chi Zhiyun’s voice was stern and sharp, forcing Chi Zhiyan to lower his head in silence. He paced back and forth on the jade platform for two rounds, feeling irritated. Beside him, Ning Hejing’s expression was grim as he spoke, "Since we have already offended him, Li Xizhi must have harbored resentment in his heart for a long time. Even if he dies, Li Xuanfeng will surely investigate. If he uncovers anything, he will turn his hatred toward us again.

"Why not go all the way and wipe out the entire Li Family? Tear down Moongaze Lake, and as for Li Xuanfeng…"

Chi Zhiyun pressed his hand against the jade throne and pondered for a moment. His thick eyebrows arched slightly, his pristine white robe draped over the silver celestial seat. He still felt a trace of irritation in his heart as he murmured, "If we really kill Li Xuanfeng, then all the trouble we went through before would have been for nothing! Destroying Moongaze Lake is fine, but once we fall out with the Yue Cultivating Sect, who will act as our vanguard? Who will hold off the Buddhist cultivators coming from the south?

"Out of the thirty-six peaks, nineteen are stationed to guard the Four Seas, six are scattered across market towns and the remaining eleven must also consider Daoist Master Yuan Xiu. Only six peaks are truly available for deployment. When the time comes, who will be sent to fight against the devil cultivators and Buddhist cultivators?"

His speech grew increasingly fast, carrying a ruthless edge. He cast a cold glance at Ning Hejing and asked, "Will you go?"

Ning Hejing naturally lowered his head and shook it. Though he held considerable power within the sect, his innate ability was weak. Achieving Foundation Establishment Realm had already been a struggle for him. How could he possibly take on such a task? He could only shake his head.

Chi Zhiyun then turned his head toward Chi Zhiyan and asked, "How about sending you?"

Chi Zhiyan remained silent as well. He had aspirations of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm and was already preoccupied with his cultivation. How could he afford to go and risk his life in battle? Chi Zhiyun sneered coldly, saying, "Or should we send a few elders from the family? Who among us can command them? Or perhaps send our brothers? If they get injured, it won't just end there. Our uncles will demand a hefty price.

"Should we send the Yu Family instead? After Yu Yuxie was devoured by the ancestor, their entire family scattered, and they have no one left to use. Or should we send the Yuan Family? Yuan Tuan and Yuan Chengdun have already been harmed by you lot!

"Only the Jiachuan Lin Valley Family still has some talents left, and even if we select one or two more from Linhai Prefecture… it’s far from enough!"

Chi Zhiyan was utterly humiliated by the relentless questioning. He had nothing left to say and could only reply, "I was reckless… But… but forgive me for speaking frankly, is the current situation really our responsibility? Isn't it all because of the ancestor…"

Chi Zhiyun shot him a sharp glare and responded, "What a pity that Yu Muxian is dead… Leaving behind only Tang Shedu and Yu Su…"

When it came down to it, the Azure Pond Sect had very few truly reliable people. Daoist Master Yuan Xiu was a solitary cultivator. He was cold and stubborn, following only his own path. Chi Zhiyun would never dare to mobilize him.

The elemental forces had once again taken control of the southern border. Though it would likely return to the hands of the Ning Family in a few years, Chi Zhiyun only found it troublesome. He lowered his voice and asked, "You deliberately sent him to find Yuan Tuan… he most likely won’t survive…

"Regardless of whether Li Xizhi lives or dies, an explanation must be given. None of the major families are blind, especially the Yang Family. We killed their son-in-law…"

A headache overtook him. He could only wave his hand and say softly, "Find a scapegoat…"

The two quickly nodded and withdrew. Only then did Chi Zhiyun slowly take his seat, covering his forehead with his hand. He closed his eyes as if recalling something else.

The Dragon Clan has always despised us, and those Dragon Monarch descendants are lurking around Thundercloud Temple. How can we act recklessly? Brother Yan is too naïve… If we offend a Dragon Monarch, it will only bring disaster upon us!

At this thought, Chi Zhiyun could no longer sit still. He hastily picked up a jade slip from the table and assigned several people from the sect to track down leads.

Zongquan Island.

After several days of secluded cultivation, Li Xizhi sank his spiritual sense into his qihai acupoints. He saw a vast ocean of iridescent clouds and mist, with various colors drifting about. Compared to the usual dense cloud smoke, it appeared thin, a sign that his injuries had yet to heal.

Amidst the deep sea of clouds, not only did multicolored light drift but a dark blue cloud smoke also weaved through. It pushed aside the surrounding mist and condensed into a single mass.

Li Xizhi observed for a long time before realizing something was amiss.

He had assumed that when Dongfang Heyun’s mana invaded his body, it would cause great destruction. Yet, to his surprise, it merely left him cold throughout. Using his talisman qi, he was able to dissolve and expel most of it quickly, leaving only this lingering mass in his qihai acupoints.

The residual mana had gathered on its own, forming a compact mass in his qihai acupoints, floating obediently amidst the mist. It seemed ethereal and could be easily dissipated by his own mana, let alone with his talisman qi.

What does this mean…

Li Xizhi had read many Daoist texts. This kind of intrusive mana usually dispersed throughout the body. The mana would invade the organs and cause destruction, never gathering into a single entity like this.

He studied it closely and sensed the subtle changes in the mana. It didn’t seem like an offensive technique but rather an art of perception. He quickly came to a realization.

Dongfang Heyun wants to spy on the situation in Azure Pond Sect…

Muhai had achieved the Purple Mansion Realm and was a direct descendant of the Dragon Monarch. He was rumored to be the seventh son of the current Dragon Palace ruler. He was not someone to be trifled with. How could he tolerate Azure Pond Sect humiliating him without retaliation?

On the surface, he had sent Dongfang Heyun to hunt down Li Xizhi to fulfill an old agreement, but in truth, he was using this opportunity to plant a spy in Azure Pond Sect and monitor its movements through Li Xizhi.

And this completely unguarded approach clearly conveyed to Li Xizhi, he thought, The life granted to you by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was not granted to you for free…

Moreover, making this technique so obvious as a spying method would instill fear in Li Xizhi, preventing him from carelessly seeking the Muhai’s aid. The entire ploy was clear now.

Having already suffered betrayal by the Chi Family, Li Xizhi fell silent and hesitated.

"The Chi Family wants to use Muhai as a blade, but Muhai is one of the top cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm. He will surely retaliate… And yet, I am the one who suffers, caught between them, unable to offend either side…"

Now that Li Xizhi understood the situation, he sighed deeply, not daring to erase the mana cluster recklessly.

Li Qinghong had only waited two days on the island. She practiced thunder techniques, summoned wind and rain and cast spells to conceal the iridescent anomalies caused by Li Xizhi’s healing process. After three days of waiting, the sealed stone door finally opened.

Since achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm and receiving the blessing of the Immortal Foundation Realm, Li Xizhi had developed an innate noble aura. His features had become smoother and more composed compared to his youth. However, his current pallor lent him the appearance of a frail nobleman.

Dorlaken's Thoughts

Some readers might wonder why some Daoist Masters like Yuan Su and Yuan Xiu have spaces in between while some Daoist Masters like Yuanwu have no space in between. The reason: Yuanwu is the only one that had no space because it is his real name, the other two were Yuan Su and Yuan Xiu, which are their titles.Yuan Su is from the Ning family, while Yuan Xiu is from the Si family.And Yuanwu is from the Tang Family with the name being Tang Yuanwu.

Li Qinghong descended in a flash of lightning and entered the cave dwelling. Li Xizhi first cupped his hands in greeting, then shook out his tattered feathered robe, where a handprint remained on his back. Li Qinghong asked, "What happened?"

Li Xizhi responded concisely, "I was betrayed by someone from the sect and lured into a forbidden area of the Dragon Clan, where I encountered a demonic dragon of the Purple Mansion Realm.

"He had his own reservations and was unwilling to act as a blade for Azure Pond Sect, so he let me go. However, he placed a restriction on me that allows him to observe my surroundings."

Li Qinghong listened to his matter-of-fact tone, but she could well imagine the sheer terror of escaping from a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Upon hearing his final words, she was even more startled, realizing that certain topics could no longer be discussed freely. She hurriedly asked, "How are your injuries?"

"Dissolving the mana left within me has been relatively easy." Li Xizhi’s expression remained calm as he spoke gently, "Initially, it would have lingered in my body, hindering my recovery and damaging my mana, but I have been able to dissolve it quickly. The remaining injuries, while severe, will not obstruct my cultivation path and can be healed with time."

Li Qinghong nodded, pondered for a moment, then asked in a hushed voice, "Was it Chi Zhiyun?"

Li Xizhi shook his head and sat down with his aunt in the cave dwelling before replying, "Aunt, you may not know this, but although Chi Zhiyun has past conflicts with our family, he values his reputation. As long as his bottom line is not crossed, he conducts himself in a fair and upright manner.

"If he truly intended to harm us, how could our family have survived on the lake until now? He would have long found an excuse to wipe us out. As long as he cares about his public image, he cannot openly send people to harm me."

Li Xizhi’s speech quickened slightly as he continued in a soft voice, "This matter is either due to his carelessness, allowing someone to exploit a loophole, or it was the Ning Family attempting to completely control our household and orchestrate my downfall. If it is the latter, it is less concerning. Yuan Su’s lifespan is running out, and our granduncle’s reputation is formidable, so there is no major threat. I'm only afraid that it's the former."

Though Li Qinghong was devoted to her cultivation, she was also a perceptive woman. She frowned and said, "I'm afraid this incident will provoke Chi Zhiyun into wiping everything out in one go! I've seen his methods before. When he decides to be ruthless, he's far more terrifying than the likes of Ning Hejing and Chi Zhiyan."

Li Xizhi nodded solemnly and said in a serious tone, "Aunt, I must ask you to accompany me to Profound Peak Gate! Senior Kong was a close friend of my father. With her as a witness, we can distance ourselves from this matter. I can claim that I never went to Qunyi, that only the Han Family was involved and that no harm was actually done. This should put Chi Zhiyun at ease."

Though this was his outward reasoning, deep down, he had another concern in his heart, I don’t know what kind of person Daoist Master Suiguan is, but if he hears that I escaped from a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, he may personally come to investigate. That would be disastrous!

Li Xizhi wasn’t particularly afraid of his internal talisman seed being discovered. After all, even Chi Buzi had failed to detect it back then. If his internal restriction was found, it wouldn’t be a huge problem. But if the talisman seed retaliated and killed this peak Purple Mansion Daoist Master, Jiangnan would be thrown into chaos.

Suiguan is no ordinary person. If he dies here, Pristine Water will likely emerge on the spot, stepping out from the grotto heaven and dragging me back home to find the Immortal Mirror.

Li Xizhi silently weighed his options, realizing that this course of action was inevitable. Li Qinghong pondered briefly before she said with a sigh, "Even after being harmed, we must pretend as if nothing happened... Such is the fate of the weak."

Li Xizhi nodded in agreement, then Li Qinghong soared into the sky on a flash of lightning. Li Xizhi concealed himself behind her, and together they departed, crossing the Shallow Sea toward Profound Peak Gate.

Both of them traveled at an astonishing speed. After half a month, they landed on the shores of Lake Xian, where Li Qinghong rode her lightning toward the gates of Profound Peak Gate in Shanji Prefecture. The sect shimmered with pale-white radiance, and its cultivators bustled about, appearing quite busy.

She had one of the sect members report to Kong Tingyun and deliberately said, "I heard that my nephew Xizhi is at your esteemed family’s senior’s residence. Please inform Kong Tingyun."

Before long, a streak of golden light shot out from the mountain. Kong Tingyun, dressed in her usual deep indigo robes, approached with evident delight.

"Qinghong, my dear sister!" said Kong Tingyun.

Although Daoist Master Changxi was not particularly renowned in the Purple Mansion Realm, Kong Tingyun was still a descendant of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. She had taken numerous treasured panaceas over the years, giving her an appearance even younger than Li Qinghong’s. She looked no older than her early twenties. With great enthusiasm, she greeted her, "It’s been so many years! What brings you here to visit me?"

Li Qinghong, now carrying an even more refined aura, had her long hair tied as usual. She replied gently, "I heard that Xizhi was here with you, and I was worried. So, I came to check on him."

Kong Tingyun’s ears twitched slightly as she listened to a private mana transmission, then smiled and said, "Please, come into the mountain first."

She activated the formation, and Li Qinghong waited for a brief moment before entering. She landed on Kong Tingyun’s immortal peak, and Li Xizhi revealed himself, bowing respectfully, "Many thanks, Senior."

Kong Tingyun smiled slightly, glanced at him twice, and thought to herself, He carries himself with more noble grace than his father. He must take after that Xiao Family woman.

Though their families were close, she dared not act too familiarly, lest she invite unforeseen trouble. She first said, "Don't rush to thank me. Speak of your business first."

Moongaze Lake.

Li Xijun patrolled the lake for a full round before gracefully landing in the town. Just then, a swirl of gray wind surged toward him and transformed into a human form before him. Li Wushao clasped his hands and spoke softly, "My lord, the heir has emerged from seclusion."

Li Xijun gave a slight nod and stepped forward to the hall's entrance. At the highest seat sat Li Chengliao who wore long garments. He gazed downward at Li Zhouwei, who stood holding a halberd. The boy had broken through after just half a year, achieving the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Li Xijun glanced at him, mentally calculating his age. Li Zhouwei was only thirteen, achieving the Qi Cultivation Realm even earlier than An Jingming had back in the day.

Minghuang had the boost of a Talisman pill, adding an entire level effortlessly. The medicinal power and spiritual energy he received were incomparable to what An Jingming had...

But An Jingming’s cultivation method, especially during the Embryonic Breathing Realm, allowed for rapid advancement. Comparing the two, it's hard to tell how vast the difference truly is.

After some thought, he stepped into the hall. Li Chengliao and his son turned their gaze toward him, but Li Xijun simply waved his hand and said, "No need for formalities."

He did not say much, only speaking in a low tone, "Xizhi is not on Green Pine Island. I've received other news. The golden rain was indeed caused by the fall of Yuanwu."

At these words, a faint smile appeared on Li Chengliao's face. He smoothed his robe and replied with a clasped hand, "I will make the necessary arrangements at once."

Li Xijun nodded, his thoughts drifting. His hand rested on the hilt of Han Lin, the slender sword gleaming faintly. He gazed at the morning light outside the hall, an unease settling in his heart.

This is a critical moment... yet Xizhi is not in the sect... He only said he went to visit the Han Family... but at a time like this, could something have gone wrong?

Li Xijun silently weighed his options, even hesitating about deploying forces to the eastern shore. However, this opportunity was too rare to pass up. His family had worked hard to secure the right connections, delaying further might cause unforeseen complications.

Standing at the foot of the steps, he observed the quiet mobilization of troops within the town. After calculating the timing, he finally took flight and soared toward the eastern shore.

I can't wait any longer... Granduncle’s letter mentioned that Shangyuan’s breakthrough is imminent and instability in Jiangnan is growing. I must act swiftly...
