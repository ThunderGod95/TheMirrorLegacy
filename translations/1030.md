# Chapter 1030: No Distinction Between Black and White

"Oh…"

Li Zhouwei's words caught him off guard, lodging in his throat. For a long moment, Minghui was speechless, managing only an awkward, formal bow.

"My apologies for the offense!"

He raised his eyebrows, still feeling his performance lacked sufficient greed. With a thick-skinned grin, he added,

"And… and also the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood that Fellow Daoist Zhaojing promised me all those years ago…"

Only then did Li Zhouwei feel he truly looked the part of a monk. He mulled it over.

'Right… there's that Daoist Master Yan in the Eastern Sea. If Uncle achieves World's Radiance, getting the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood back is just a matter of time.'

Seeing how wealthy the monk was, however, sparked an idea.

'The north has been occupied by Buddhist cultivators for many years. A vast number of Immortal Dao treasures have fallen into their hands, most of which they can't even use… just as our Treasured Artifacts have little value in the south. Exchanging spiritual resources from the north could be a very profitable path.'

'The Lotus Temple is playing both sides, dissatisfied with both Mount Dayang and the Viewing Pavilion. Whether their discontent is genuine or just a facade, their words can't be trusted. But this channel for offloading Enlightened Artifacts cannot be severed.'

Though he didn't trust the Lotus Temple, he knew he'd be dealing with many more Buddhist items in the future. This thought brought a measure of tolerance. He took the treasures from Minghui's hands and replied, "My uncle has already received news. He won't keep you waiting long. I'll pass your message along… however…"

He looked up. "I wonder just how many spiritual resources the Maha, or rather, the Lotus Temple, has available for trade."

Minghui paused, then nodded eagerly. "My master has a fondness for collecting Immortal Dao treasures. He has… quite a few…"

Li Zhouwei considered this. "I need something that can aid in breaking through a divine ability."

Minghui racked his brain, fumbling in his sleeve for some time before finally producing a small box. He hesitated.

"Has the great master heard of… the Supreme Concealed Origin?"

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"You have impressive connections!" he said, a note of suspicion in his voice.

Minghui shook his head repeatedly, pressing his palms together.

"It is rumored that Mount Dayang possesses the Supreme Concealed Origin. This item resonates with the Immortal Pure Qi, and when catalyzed within a Grotto-Heaven, it produces a unique spiritual qi called the 'Soul-Listening Purple Intent Qi'."

"This substance is beneficial to the Immortal Dao. While it doesn't significantly increase one's cultivation base and is difficult to use in alchemy, it does have some effect in augmenting divine abilities. My master left behind a good deal of it. When I achieved the rank of Maha, he gave me a portion to aid my practice, instructing me that the north and south are originally one Dao, and that constant contemplation would surely yield benefits…"

A pained expression flickered across his face as he opened the jade box.

"Please, have a look, great master!"

As Li Zhouwei lifted the lid, he saw layers of purple intent sealed within the box by dharma power. The moment his spiritual sense swept over it, he felt his divine abilities stir. His golden eyes flashed.

"Is this… Purple Qi?"

Minghui smiled.

"Precisely! Purple Qi is one aspect of the Heavenly Cultivation Purple Qi Immortal Origin Metallic Essence. It is intimately connected to the Immortal Dao and perfectly suits your needs, Fellow Daoist!"

Li Zhouwei examined it for a moment longer before nodding. "Excellent."

The monk beamed.

"I lack my master's talent," Minghui said with a nod. "My research into this has been fruitless. I would rather trade it for some more practical spiritual resources. I'll melt them down with these golden artifacts and forge a fine treasure—many of your wondrous items are useless to me. Something more direct would be best… something indestructible, or that can traverse the Great Void. Those are the kinds of abilities I can certainly put to use!"

Li Zhouwei thought for a moment. "The Crane-Embrace Stone… would that be of use to you? It can be used to embellish a dharma artifact, granting it the ability to travel through space. It belongs to the way of True Qi and is compatible with all Daos."

Minghui had never actually heard of this Crane-Embrace Stone, but hearing it had the power of spatial travel was enough to know it wouldn't be a wasted trade. He was secretly relieved, but on the surface, he feigned a sudden realization and smiled.

"That's exactly what I need!"

Li Zhouwei nodded in agreement.

Unfortunately, the Crane-Embrace Stone was still with Li Ximing and couldn't be retrieved immediately. They agreed to have it delivered later. Li Zhouwei reached into his sleeve, sighing internally.

'Of the items I gained in the Grotto-Heaven, aside from the Li Fire resources, almost everything has been spent. Even of the things I got from Mount Changxiao, only the Bound Heart-Ice is worth mentioning… In the end, it's never enough!'

The Blazing Fire in Minghui's possession had come from the north and been refined by Buddhist cultivators. Now, it had passed from Minghui's hands to Li Ximing's with what seemed like a lack of caution. The Blazing Fire wasn't something their family needed, but fortunately, they possessed the Intercalary Sun Art. Although it had little to do with Blazing Fire, they could experiment. At the very least, they had to erase any traces of Buddhist refinement.

'For Uncle, this is a trivial matter.'

Minghui was, after all, one of the Northern Buddhists. Li Zhouwei saw no reason to prolong their conversation. He summoned the wind and departed, heading west.

Minghui lowered his hands. Despite having given away a treasure, he showed little regret. He wiped his hands on his kasaya, tucked the pile of golden artifacts into his sleeve, and began to ponder.

'That's only enough for thirty percent of the spiritual fire. I wonder how much Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood I'll get.'

His master's soul had encountered a problem, which had once shattered his cultivation path. In the years since, he had risen from the ashes, switching to another Dao. He had made rapid progress in his spell arts, achieving great things in both the Immortal and Buddhist paths. The matter of his soul was no longer so urgent.

Minghui felt a knot of anxiety.

'None of the affairs this man is involved in are simple… Just standing on the sidelines is a risk to one's life. Now he's gone and fought a Dragon Prince. How am I supposed to navigate this mess!'

'Forget it, forget it… I'll go back and ask my master. I'll just repeat their words exactly and let him analyze them. Perhaps he'll see something I don't. That White Qilin is already getting suspicious. I can't be so lavish next time… I need to act greedier…'

He dismissed his auspicious cloud, and with a push of his foot, transformed into a streak of brilliant golden light, vanishing into the Great Void.

---

An unknown amount of time passed before the mist over the sea began to thicken. Thunder rumbled ceaselessly in the sky. Layer upon layer of black clouds stacked high, as if some colossal creature were swimming through the air.

Demonic clouds billowed within the dense fog. The black-robed man still stood against the horizon, hands clasped behind his back. A swirl of violet-black energy churned in his eyes, his expression complex.

'Dragon King Beihai… Dongfang You has been dead for many years… He is the master of the White Dragon lineage now.'

Despite having just fought a major battle with Li Zhouwei and being hastily driven away by Dongfang Lieyun, Guangfou's gaze was perfectly calm. He stared silently to the west until a soft voice spoke beside him.

"Well?"

The cold, murderous intent was gone from the demon dragon's eyes, replaced by clear suspicion. "Their guess is a safe one, but I don't believe Luoxia would do such a thing."

"Oh?" The voice beside him gained a hint of emotion. "You think them incapable?"

Guangfou shook his head.

"They are capable, but they wouldn't do it right under the nose of the Underworld. It would be pointless and would violate Luoxia's principles. Or rather—Luoxia would disdain to do so."

The voice paused. "Even if it means allowing a new master to ascend to the throne of Bright Yang?"

Waves of demonic qi rippled from the demon dragon's sleeves. He raised his eyes to the heavens, his gaze fixed on the distant sun half-submerged in a sea of clouds.

"Whether he can ascend is hard to say," he said flatly.

"But they won't be afraid. When the Jade True Monarch ascended, did you see any fear in the heavens? On the contrary, they celebrated for the world, for the Heavenly Glow. They celebrated that the old Jade True master would never return."

"And with his departure, the world gained a measure of peace."

---

In the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance.

The clouds swirled with iridescent light. Li Ximing slowly awoke from his meditation, and the Heavenly Light within the pavilion instantly dimmed.

He rose and lifted a hand. A few specks of golden light emerged from his fingertips, circled his wrist, and returned. The Daoist Master, dressed in white-gold robes, looked up slightly.

"My World's Radiance is complete!"

Cultivating this World's Radiance Immortal Foundation had cost him more than just a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual pill—it was a Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill from the Bright Yang Dao. Not to mention the immense time and effort!

'No wonder people resort to seizing another's Immortal Foundation… This cultivation session required not only a Purple Mansion Realm spiritual pill and a Golden Core-level Grotto-Heaven and Blessed Land, but I also had the boost from Talisman Qi! Without it, my speed would have been three or four times slower. How long would it have taken then!'

He sighed inwardly.

'Even after all that, the chance of failure was still high. If I lacked the proper cultivation art or got stuck at the immortal threshold, I could at least go out and make arrangements, which would be somewhat relaxing. But to have a divine ability right in front of me and be unable to grasp it… it is truly a trial of the mind.'

Li Ximing took a step forward, leaving the Grotto-Heaven and appearing within the inner array. With another step, he was in the midst of Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

The mountain was bathed in shimmering Heavenly Light. A young man stood under a gardenia tree, lost in thought. Seeing Li Ximing appear, Li Zhouwei turned and clasped his hands.

"Uncle!"

Li Ximing smiled. "You've returned quickly!"

"It's been almost half a year." Li Zhouwei's expression was somewhat grim. He shook his head. "I fought a Dragon Prince on Yinzhou Island. My whereabouts have been exposed, so I didn't have time to go to the Southern Sea. I had to rush back. The only consolation is that the matter with Minghui was resolved, so it wasn't a completely wasted trip."

"What?!"

A jolt of shock went through Li Ximing. "A Dragon Prince? Dingjiao? How did things escalate to that point!"

Li Zhouwei paced as he recounted the events on Yinzhou Island, his voice heavy.

"I had long suspected that Guangfou couldn't kill me, but the moment Dongfang Lieyun appeared, I could finally breathe easy. Now, I have met with both the Underworld and Luoxia. More importantly, the Yang clan offered me a kingship. I, Li Zhouwei, am now an open piece on the chessboard. The Dragon-kin are unlikely to remove me rashly."

"Perhaps if I had refused the Yang clan's offer that day, there might have been a slim chance I would have died on Yinzhou Island. If someone were to make a move, it would likely have been the White Dragon."

Li Ximing was stunned. "The White Dragon? Dingjiao? But… wasn't he friendly toward you?"

Li Zhouwei shook his head silently.

"Not him. Dragon King Beihai. Dingjiao was just following orders. Back then, he was only in the Foundation Establishment Realm; his perspective was completely different."

In truth, Li Zhouwei never believed there was any real conflict between the various lineages of the Dragon-kin. They might have different stances, but their ultimate goal was the same.

"Uncle, the different lineages' attitudes toward me simply represent the various considerations of the Dragon-kin…" Li Zhouwei's voice dropped.

"When it comes to me, the Dragon-kin are conflicted, both emotionally and strategically. Of course they don't want me to accelerate the fall of Bright Yang… but that doesn't mean they feel any particular closeness to Li Qianyuan. As I said during our fight, if the Dragon-kin truly had the ability and the desire to save Bright Yang, why would I, Li Zhouwei, even exist today?"

"The very fact that I exist, that a White Qilin can come and go from the Dragon Palace, proves that at their core, there must be a faction among the Dragon-kin that wants Li Qianyuan dead!"

He enunciated each word carefully. "As long as the throne has a master, who is to say who cannot sit upon it?"

Li Ximing met his gaze, and understanding dawned.

The contradictory stance of the Dragon-kin pointed to another possibility—they also wanted him to seek the proof of Bright Yang, but the result of attaining that Fruition Attainment must be his ascension! A True Monarch friendly to the Dragon-kin would be a great help to their own path to truth!

'You, Li Zhouwei, either don't seek proof, or if you do, you must succeed!'

Li Ximing opened his mouth to speak but stopped as Li Zhouwei gave a sardonic laugh.

"As for the reincarnation through Metallic Essence? I don't know if you believe it, Uncle, but I certainly don't."

How could he, Li Zhouwei, command such respect? Why would the Dragon-kin help him? Because he was Bright Yang. But since he had reincarnated to cultivate another path, why would they still help him? If he could bring them no benefit, why would the Dragon-kin show such compassion as to expend a portion of Metallic Essence for his reincarnation? Were they short one Purple Mansion Realm cultivator?!

'By retracting one's essence, one can form a golden rainbow. If becoming an immortal requires the Dao, how could they let you attain it so easily!'

As a ploy of the Luoxia immortals, the play's demons mocking the mountain was not just Luoxia guessing at the Dragon-kin's tone; it was a biting satire of their methods!

From the very beginning, the reincarnation through Metallic Essence was likely just a ploy to placate him and send him to his death!

'This is precisely why the Dragon-kin seem so hesitant. It has nothing to do with any lingering affection for the Wei-Li clan. What a joke. The mighty Dragon-kin, remembering some old sentiment for a Wei-Li descendant? Preposterous!'

This meant that the so-called reincarnation proposed by the White Dragon lineage, led by Dongfang Lieyun, was meaningless. The Dragon-kin either couldn't do it, or didn't want to! They were merely playing it safe, not believing he could succeed, and wanting him to not challenge the Fruition Attainment, but to die quietly!

That was why Guangfou had sneered during their battle, saying things like,

"Who despises the Wei-Li Bright Yang? Is it Dingjiao, or is it me? Li Zhouwei… have you thought it through?"

So, was Guangfou as friendly to the Wei state as he claimed? No! He was not friendly to Li Qianyuan, but to the _position_ of Wei-Li Bright Yang. He would support whoever could sit on that throne. This was the true will of the Dragon-kin—they would rather have a new Bright Yang True Monarch to support them than a half-dead Li Qianyuan! That was the will that drove Guangfou to act!

And the aggressive Black Dragon lineage didn't fully trust him either. Guangfou was just testing the waters, deliberately provoking him to see if he possessed the rebellious heart—and the ability—to seize the throne!

In that exchange, the rebellious heart was even more important than the ability.

But the White Dragon lineage was watching from the sidelines like a tiger. Li Zhouwei was ninety percent certain that Dragon King Beihai was playing it safe, desperately hoping he would serve his purpose by drawing the north's attention, run his course in the world, and then quietly perish!

That was why Dongfang Lieyun had specifically pointed out the meaning of the Pure Yang Bracelets!

Li Ximing stared into his nephew's golden eyes. After a long silence, he said, 

"They have you trapped… caught in the middle. Not a single one of them has a clear stance…"

Li Zhouwei slowly closed his eyes.

"A clear stance… whether to kill me or to fully support me, both come at a price. Both would invite countermeasures from the other two groups. It's not that they can't afford the price. They are waiting."

"If I am truly worthless, they will plot my demise. If I am truly a rebellious Bright Yang, one who could ascend to the Monarch's throne, I may not be as domineering as High Radiance in his prime, ruling his subjects through righteousness. Instead, I would be like the reverse of the Yang Cusp, feigning loyalty while plotting dissent, using cunning to defy one's Monarch. How could I fear the stalemate between two lineages?"

Li Ximing watched him quietly, watched as his junior revealed a chilling smile.

"They… are worried I'm not wicked enough!"
