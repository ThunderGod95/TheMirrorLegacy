# Chapter 1230: Nurturing

The two Daoist Masters waited silently outside, while inside the great hall, the radiance had grown overwhelmingly dense; silver and crimson light gradually separated, at one moment resembling falling Cinnabar, and at the next, rolling mercury, as the Mansion Water covering the floor began to boil in unison.

Li Que'wan hovered in the air, the Edict Pill Spiritual Treasure in her hand blazing with light. The Supreme Yin Spiritual Essence, long since placed within it to nurture, gradually responded to a summons; it was as if the crimson light in the sky receded like dark clouds, allowing a single point of clear, moon-like radiance to pierce through and scatter across Li Wushao's face.

Drawn by the power of the Supreme Yin, the Mansion Water instantly erupted with countless mysteries. Li Wushao's entire body began to boil, and he could finally no longer maintain his original form. His whole face pulled forward, and within the roiling Mansion Water, he transformed into a ferocious Hooked Serpent with bleak, pitch-black skin!

This old demon had benefited immensely from the Li clan's rise, from having his fate bound to theirs in the beginning to years of enjoying the resources of the Azure Pond Sect, leaving every inch of his flesh and bone saturated with spiritual energy. Amidst the vast Mansion Water, his form suddenly dissolved from top to bottom, transforming into a surging, dark spiritual liquid.

Li Que'wan's expression was incredibly solemn as she pushed her divine abilities to their absolute limit, channeling the entirety of her life's cultivation in shamanic arts and the Dao. Lifting the Spiritual Treasure in her hand, she abruptly extended her senses to connect with it!

This put immense strain on Daoist Master Cheng Qian, who was maintaining the mystic pool. He felt his dharma power being drained faster than he could supply it, and his expression changed drastically. He could only grit his teeth and pour everything he had into the effort. That single moment stretched into an eternity for him, and ultimately, unable to endure, he coughed up a mouthful of dharma blood.

Before this mouthful of dharma blood could even hit the ground, all the light in the sky vanished as if it were a dream. The great hall, once limitlessly bright, plunged into darkness in an instant. The dharma lamps and various decorations on both sides had long been completely eroded by the divine ability and dharma power, leaving only a pitch-black darkness where one could not see their own hand.

"Creeak!"

The woman at the head of the hall had just regained her footing when the tightly sealed doors suddenly swung open. Light from the outside shone in, revealing a floor covered in debris and a shallow layer of Mansion Water. Li Jiangqian strode quickly to her side, but before he could even ask, the woman had already opened her hand, revealing the silver and crimson Spiritual Treasure.

A fine new pattern had appeared on the Spiritual Treasure, resembling a black Flood Dragon. It was coiled ferociously around the thumb-sized treasure, rising and falling amidst clouds of silver and mercury, a truly wondrous sight.

Li Que'wan simply smiled and nodded.

Li Jiangqian had been prepared for the worst, so his eyes lit up and his face finally broke into a joyful expression. Li Ximing, who had followed him in, let out a sigh of relief and quickly helped Daoist Master Cheng Qian to his feet, saying with gratitude:

"It is all thanks to Daoist Master Cheng Qian's assistance!"

These words also made Li Que'wan look over, her gaze filled with the same sentiment.

This was no mere pleasantry. In Li Que'wan's view, Li Wushao's ability to safely pass this trial was firstly due to the Supreme Yin Spiritual Essence being far too precious, compensating for most of the deficit caused by the premature condensation. Secondly, it was due to Daoist Master Cheng Qian; without the help of this early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, who had also achieved the 'Whole Pill', things would have been several times more difficult.

This Daoist Master had even coughed up his own dharma blood to help, so he naturally deserved significant credit. However, faced with Li Ximing's words, Daoist Master Cheng Qian just shook his head and hurriedly said:

"Senior is too kind!"

He had yet to regulate the divine ability within him, and his face was etched with anxiety and bitterness. Before the Li family members could say anything more, he coughed twice and said hastily:

"This was my duty, there is no need to say more, it's just..."

"I was supposed to be handling my Master's funeral arrangements, but I never expected to be delayed for over half a year. So much time has passed... I am needed back at Overlook Peak... Please allow me to make a trip to the Eastern Sea!"

Daoist Master Cheng Qian had clearly not anticipated spending so much time here when he first arrived. His anxiety was plain to see, which made it difficult for Li Ximing to press the matter. He could only take a medicinal pill from his robes and place it in the man's hand before watching him depart.

Once the man was gone, Li Jiangqian turned back and asked in a low voice:

"How is it?"

Li Que'wan just shook her head. After a moment of sensing, she raised her slender hand, extended her index finger, and gently bit it open. She smeared her blood across her red lips, and only then could a low cough be heard from her throat. After more than ten breaths, she spoke in a hoarse voice:

"My shamanic arts were struck by the Proclaimation Earth divine ability, which should have caused a major backlash. I shouldn't have been able to cast spells for a year or speak for two—not even use divine abilities to transmit my voice. Fortunately, the Obscure Talisman provided some protection, and after more than half a year, most of it has been resolved."

"As for Senior Wushao."

Though her voice was hoarse, her original gentle tone could still be heard as she said softly:

"With the emergency aid from myself and Daoist Brother Cheng Qian, we induced the condensation early, using the Supreme Yin to harmonize with the Mansion Water. He is much better now, but the remaining nurturing time may have changed."

"That's not an issue."

Li Jiangqian nodded repeatedly and paced a few steps within the hall, while Li Ximing asked with concern:

"The important thing is that you've passed this trial. How are your injuries? To have dragged this on for over half a year must have been difficult!"

At the mention of this, a smile appeared on Li Que'wan's face as she said:

"Thank you for your concern, Grand-Uncle. In the end, I only took a single palm strike from Qing Jifang. It's just that he possesses three divine abilities and is highly skilled in spell arts, while my Awaiting the Supreme Divine has no defensive wonders, making the injury seem particularly severe."

"But I have the Mystic Tablet Edict Pill!"

She smiled and said:

"Although the treasure wasn't on my person during the fight, I've been holding it constantly for the past half-year, and its top-tier Hidden Profundity wonder has been operating every single day!"

"The Profound Coffin Crimson Water is originally Mansion Water from the lake that nourishes earth and wood. It possesses the wonder of transformation and the virtue of nurturing. Continuously nourished by the Hidden Profundity wonder, it's equivalent to consuming a portion of a pill refined from this water. Over the past six months, my injuries haven't been getting worse day by day, but have been subtly improving!"

She then raised her wrist, and indeed, the pattern on her arm that looked like shattered glass had healed significantly. The surface was smooth as new, though a faint glimmer of broken light could be seen beneath the tender white skin.

Li Ximing had never considered this possibility. Greatly moved, he nodded repeatedly, a look of joy on his face as he said:

"As expected of a Spiritual Treasure... this one wonder alone is enough to make one endlessly envious!"

After Li Que'wan spoke these two sentences, her voice had already become clear again. She turned her hand back over and took out the jade bottle, returning the large Horn Wood pill. She pressed her lips together and said:

"I no longer have need of it. It's more important for Grand-Uncle to focus on his recovery!"

Li Ximing knew his current state was quite poor. He shook his head, first looking at Li Jiangqian, and said:

"Jiangqian... is there any news on the Imperial Sun-March Sha?"

A golden glint coalesced in Li Jiangqian's eyes as understanding dawned, and a secret joy bloomed within him. He said with great solemnity:

"Junior has kept this matter in mind at all times. The moment I received the news, I immediately dispatched people to Chengshui Marsh. With Senior Zhong's connections, we didn't face any obstacles!"

His tone then shifted, growing softer as he continued:

"According to the returning men, there was indeed a response from Chengshui Marsh, and they were able to extract that strand of qi... Perhaps because it was excavated by someone long ago, damaging the tomb, the process is very slow. Although the qi-gathering art said it would take five years, in reality, it will be even slower... It looks to be at least nine to ten years."

"Ten years!"

This was no small problem. An ordinary Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could afford to wait, but Li Zhouwei's cultivation speed was extremely fast. Ten years was probably enough time for him to attempt to raise his immortal foundation twice! If he succeeded on the first try it would be one thing, but if he failed, the time required would multiply. Li Ximing's brow immediately furrowed, but fortunately, Li Jiangqian quickly added:

"If that's the case, we definitely won't make it in time to coordinate with Father's cultivation. Therefore, your son also made private inquiries and learned from Daoist Master Tinglan of the Purple Smoke Gate... that there are three other royal tombs in Jiangnan."

Li Jiangqian said seriously:

"One is in Western Shu; it's the former tomb of King Wu of the Xiao clan. I sent people to take a look. Not only is it small and insignificant, but it has also been robbed by others. They couldn't extract anything from it at all..."

"And another... is the former tomb of the Yue State Emperor, beneath Sword Gate."

But the youth before him was clearly dissatisfied, saying:

"I feigned sending people to purchase spiritual items to probe the situation. Although it's better than King Wu's tomb, it lacks any grand atmosphere. There is one last place, in Yi Mountain City."

Li Ximing was slightly stunned, and the young man said:

"The Chu Emperor!"

He seemed to have paid close attention, having collected intelligence over the years and already possessing a deep understanding of these matters. He explained smoothly:

"Yi Mountain City was built on a barren mountain called Mount Lingqiu, which was originally the site of the Chu imperial mausoleum. The people of Chu often held sacrificial rites there. Besides the royal capital, it was the most important location. At the time, it nurtured fields of crimson gold, and the mountain contained the essence of Profound Li. Later, when the Great Chu was about to fall, the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion excavated it completely, moving the coffins and everything into their grotto-heaven."

"But this Mount Lingqiu that was left behind is much better than Chengshui Marsh!"

Although Ning and Chu were both ruled by emperors, even at its peak, the Ning State was not half the size of the Chu State. Not to mention that the Great Chu had passed down through generations, producing more than one True Monarch. In contrast, the Ning State's only truly significant emperor was the founding lord, Tianwu.

Li Jiangqian said with a serious expression:

"And Yi Mountain City is one of the Ning clan's trump cards. We also have an elder holding a high position there who can handle the loose ends for us. As long as there are no accidents, this qi will certainly be obtained within these two years."

Li Ximing had long known he would have a solution. If it were anyone else, they likely would not have been able to handle it so quickly, and the matter might have even fallen to him to inquire about. Greatly relieved, he finally accepted the pill from Li Que'wan's hand. He formed a sword sign with two fingers, placed it before his lips, and conjured a small golden flame.

The Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire was a golden-red flame, and it hovered affectionately at his fingertip. Most spiritual fires possessed a spirit. Li Ximing had obtained this fire several decades ago, and it had been with him through thick and thin, making it a great Meritorious Official. It would be impossible to say he had no feelings for it. With a heavy heart, he took out the small bowl from Nine Mounds from all those years ago with his other hand, sealed the fire just as before, and said:

"Since you have both made arrangements, I can take this pill and enter seclusion with peace of mind. It is not convenient for your sister to go to the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. Once you obtain the qi, you can just deliver it to your father."

Li Que'wan's Spiritual Treasure was currently being nurtured within her divine ability. Although its various wonders could already be used, Li Wushao had not yet completely fused with the Spiritual Treasure, making it inconvenient to bring into the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. Yet, she could not be separated from it, so she was unable to set foot there.

"Yes!"

The two answered in unison, and Li Ximing transformed into a streak of light and departed.

Li Que'wan was perceptive. Although Li Ximing had departed decisively, she could see his reluctance. Cradling the mystic bowl, she sighed:

"This makes me feel uneasy accepting it!"

Li Jiangqian also took this matter to heart and said with a serious expression:

"Without this True Fire, Grand-Uncle's alchemy will be clumsy. We should take this opportunity to gather spiritual items and find a way to get him a flame that excels at pill concoction!"

His original plan had been to use his own Vast Desert Li Flame to transform a spiritual fire, but the victory in this battle had unexpectedly changed his mind. He said in a deep voice:

"I had thought this fire was mediocre, but I didn't expect its effect in dispelling Proclaimation Earth to have some miraculous properties. Qing Jifang returned in defeat and will surely plot against our lake again. Preserving this fire will be of great use at a critical moment."

"In that case, we really don't have many spare spiritual flames to convert, only Grand-Uncle's Red Pheasant Surging Li Flame... To actually convert it will be another major expense!"

Li Que'wan nodded thoughtfully. Just as she was about to speak, she suddenly saw a streak of flowing light fly over, shaking the Great Void, and an old, weathered voice called out:

"Is Daoist Friend Zhaojing present? Ji An has come as promised!"

At these words, Li Que'wan's expression changed. She exchanged a look with her brother, a sudden realization dawning on her:

"That's right! There's still this matter!"

This Ji An was none other than the old Daoist Master, a friend of the Chunyi Dao Gate, who had reached an agreement with the Li family years ago for a copy of the Great Scripture of Radiance. Their family had promised to refine a pill for him, but the timing was terrible, happening right when Li Ximing was heavily injured and his True Fire sent away...

Li Jiangqian's expression grew slightly grim.

Back then, this old Daoist Master had traveled a thousand miles to their door, and this pill was a significant part of the reason. Although he had been courteous and given them plenty of face, now that Li Ximing was in seclusion to heal for several years, it was likely his time would be wasted.

Seeing Li Que'wan's slightly worried gaze, Li Jiangqian composed himself, a faint hint of a smile in his eyes, and said:

"It's not necessarily a bad thing... Whether this turns out good or bad is just a matter of a few words! Leave it to me. You can focus on your recovery."

With that, he rode a flame out and appeared over the sparkling lake surface. Sure enough, he saw the red-robed Daoist Master standing before the formation, his wrinkled face wreathed in smiles as he said:

"Little Friend Changli, long time no see! I heard your esteemed clan fought Qing Jifang until he was heavily injured and forced to retreat. Truly formidable."

Li Jiangqian's face was filled with sorrow. He sighed and said:

"Senior overstates things... Heavily injured and forced to retreat—that's just a rumor spread outside. This junior cannot accept such praise..."

Ji An pondered for a moment, a faint sense of foreboding rising within him. He followed Li Jiangqian down to Gardenia Scenery Mountain. The young Daoist Master served tea, and Ji An chose his words carefully:

"I previously made an agreement with your esteemed clan that I would come to the lake once I had gathered all the spiritual items. I wonder if Zhaojing..."

Li Jiangqian lowered his head and let out a soft sigh:

"Grand-Uncle was injured by Qing Jifang!"

Ji An had anticipated this, but hearing the news confirmed still made his expression turn troubled. He didn't say much, but asked politely:

"How are his injuries?"

Li Jiangqian said somberly:

"Quite severe."

At these words, Ji An's face became grim. Before the old man could speak, he heard Li Jiangqian say with a serious tone:

"Grand-Uncle has always remembered Senior's matter. He has already consumed a treasured Horn Wood pill he was saving and has gone into seclusion!"

Ji An's mood eased slightly, but Li Jiangqian's brow grew dark as he said:

"Senior's timing is perfect. Even if Senior had not come, I would have gone to the Chunyi Dao Gate to find you."

"Oh?"

Ji An's gaze sharpened, and the young man before him said with a dark expression:

"Some days ago, people from the great desert came and took away the True Fire that Grand-Uncle was most skilled with for alchemy, leaving him like a tiger with its teeth pulled. He has all this skill in the Dao of Pills, but can't use much of it."

"What?!"

Ji An had not expected such a strange turn of events and was momentarily struck dumb. He narrowed his eyes and said:

"Tianque?"

"Precisely!"

Li Jiangqian wrung his hands and sighed, his expression sorrowful. Ji An pondered for a long time. He picked up his tea, then hesitated and set it back down on the table, saying:

"What Changli means is..."

Li Jiangqian's face showed a look of apprehension as he said:
"I wonder, old Master... what is your relationship... with the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition?"
