# Chapter 686: Bone Carving Skin Exchange

The person who arrived was Xiao Yuansi. His expression was gentle and his cultivation had already reached its peak. Merely standing there, he exuded a faint medicinal fragrance. The cloud patterns on his cuffs were a light golden hue and his demeanor was warm. He said, “No need to be so polite...”

Li Ximing had gone to the Xiao Family several times to seek him but each time he returned empty-handed. Later, the Xiao Family sealed the mountain which made it even harder to see Xiao Yuansi. Now, feeling sentimental, Li Ximing asked several questions in succession, “How is Master’s cultivation now? Are you preparing to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm?!”

“Still lacking a bit of refinement,” Xiao Yuansi responded warmly to each question.

During the short time Xiao Yuansi had been present, Li Xijun had already begun to speculate, thinking, It seems that Mu Moli and Ju Wu were lured out by the Man On Creek. The Xiao Family specifically made this trip, so they must have some intentions.

The Li Family’s trip was only to Mount Wu, what else was there that could be worth Xiao Chuting sending people over? The white-clothed youth shook his sleeves and first expressed his gratitude, “Many thanks for your assistance, senior.”

Xiao Yuansi waved his hand lightly. Whether they were thanking him for effortlessly capturing Mu Moli or for luring both man and beast out of the mountain, both parties understood in their hearts. Then, Li Xijun smiled and said, “I was troubled, unsure of the taboos and depths of Mount Wu. Since you are passing through, senior, I hope you can offer some guidance.”

“Alright, then let’s go take a look together.” Xiao Yuansi glanced at him in surprise, chuckled softly, and agreed, saying, “Speaking with Xijun is truly like a refreshing spring breeze.”

Xiao Yuansi paused for a moment. He could no longer hold the crimson light, which Mu Moli transformed into, in his hand. The crimson light then transformed into a bare head attached to a short segment of spine. Mu Moli opened his mouth and was going to beg for mercy.

Xiao Yuansi placed a finger on the center of his eyebrows. In an instant, Mu Moli lost his consciousness and drifted into a hazy dreamlike state. With a flick of his sleeve, Mu Moli melted into it like snow under sunlight.

After casting a spell to take him in, Xiao Yuansi finally spoke with slight apology, “Our Daoist Master has some matters to inquire about regarding Mount Yue.”

At this point, Li Ximing understood that Xiao Yuansi had come specifically for Mount Wu. He traveled with the wind and soon saw a narrow-eyed monk also flying over, golden light forming into a bundle of chains, tightly binding a panther-like demon.

Ju Wu had only managed to escape a few miles before Kongheng had already been waiting nearby. The demonic beast had suffered some minor injuries and had no chance of escaping from the Master Monk’s grasp. In just a moment, it was captured and brought back.

“The Master Monk has arrived,” said Li Ximing, stepping forward to greet him.

Xiao Yuansi glanced at Kongheng and said softly, “Take this demonic beast into the formation. It may be of use.”

Kongheng glanced at Li Xijun and gave a slight nod before silently landing beside the group and replied, “Kongheng greets the senior.”

Xiao Yuansi nodded and looked at the pitch-black formation beneath his feet. Li Xijun brought Ju Wu forward and said in a deep voice, “Open the grand formation.”

Ju Wu stiffened his neck but couldn’t utter a word. His fierce expression masked his inner fear. Li Xijun glanced at him twice, then pointed to Xiao Yuansi and spoke softly, “This is Senior Xiao of the immortal family at the Purple Mansion Realm, a nephew of the Daoist Master. Even if Jiao Zhongzi returns for revenge, he will still fall into the hands of the Daoist Master, so there is no need to worry.”

Seeing the change in Ju Wu’s expression, he continued saying, “Or is Jiao Zhongzi currently in seclusion overseas, attempting to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm? Do you think he can succeed?”

Ju Wu’s expression shifted several times. Jiao Zhongzi had been missing for years and Ju Wu truly had no idea where he was. Looking at the group’s demeanor, Mu Moli was likely dead. This demon had some relation with Mu Moli. With its friend slain, it sorrowfully shut its mouth and was unwilling to speak.

Li Xijun drew his sword and pressed it against Ju Wu’s neck with the icy blade biting into its skin. With that, Ju Wu immediately spoke, “To enter and exit this formation, a shamanic talisman is required. I have it on me. Loosen my bindings slightly and I will retrieve it for the Exalted Immortal.”

Among the cultivators present, any one of them could take his life. Li Xijun wasn’t worried about him playing tricks, so he signaled Kongheng to loosen the restriction. Ju Wu swept his gaze over the group and then looked at the Purple Mansion immortal descendant standing with his hands behind his back.

He opened his panther-like mouth, extended his blood-colored tongue and spat out a brown shamanic talisman. With a command toward the pitch-black formation, the mist dissipated instantly and revealed the great mountain hidden within.

Li Xijun nodded slightly. They could have forcefully broken through the formation but by taking this indirect approach, they preserved this rare shamanic array. This way, there would be no need to construct another grand formation to protect the mountain in the future.

As they drew closer to the mountain, the surrounding magical winds dissipated and made it feel as if they had sunk into quicksilver. With the grand formation now open, Ju Wu’s mentality shifted and he hastily explained, “Mount Wu once housed a supreme treasure. Over the years, mulberry trees have grown everywhere and the spiritual energy here has become heavy. When immortal arts are used here, the clarity of their essence is greatly diminished. The most affected is the art of wind-riding.”

“That must be Answers to a Beggar’s Questions Under the Mulberry Tree!” Xiao Yuansi frowned slightly. He possessed a flying shuttle which was a dharma artifact, meaning he wasn’t necessarily unable to fly here. However, considering the others, he spoke gently, “Let’s go up from the foot of the mountain and take a look.”

They descended toward the foot of the mountain and indeed saw the land covered in mulberry and pagoda trees, forming a dark landscape. White jade steps lined the mountain with spring water gushing forth, flowing in a stream of translucent green. The sound of rushing water echoed around them. The many jade stones bore the marks of time, their luster dimmed, revealing an ancient aura.

Li Ximing praised the sight. As the group ascended the steps, they reached a platform. Li Xijun, holding his sword, swept the area with his spiritual sense and saw below them a group of swine-like creatures sprawled haphazardly.

These creatures lay limp, their eyes were vacant and devoid of intelligence. Around their necks were jade collars engraved with formation patterns that were glowing faintly. Their bodies were bare and covered in various markings.

Their cultivation realms varied, some were at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, others as high as late stage Qi Cultivation Realm. However, all of them lay there mindlessly, dazed and unresponsive.

Seeing the group’s silence, Ju Wu stepped forward awkwardly and explained, “Shamanic spell arts often require blood sacrifices. These were... specifically raised... as offerings.”

Kongheng, having traveled extensively and seen much, had encountered such things often in the north. His eyes shut tightly, his face showing faint anger as he said gravely, “Human livestock.”

Li Xijun remained silent. So-called human livestock were akin to consumables like rice meat and blood slices. They were often made from cultivators, refined using various spiritual materials and alchemical substances. Finally becoming what they now saw.

“Judging by this, the Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators of Northern Mount Yue are all here.” Li Xijun responded softly, “Northern Mount Yue does not harvest resentment qi and blood qi. Instead, they stack up Qi Cultivation through sheer numbers of people, only to later turn them into human livestock...”

Xiao Yuansi glanced at the scene but remained silent. He gently lifted his sleeve and shook out a medicine cauldron.

The cauldron was entirely gray-white, appearing extremely sturdy. A gust of gray wind rose from its mouth, stirring among the human livestock. Screams erupted as flesh and skin flew in all directions, exposing eerie white bones. Chunks of meat peeled off the pig-like creatures’ faces, and eyeballs rolled to the ground.

In just a few seconds, their skin and flesh were stripped away. In the next, they dissolved into pools of blood. Another few seconds later, even their bones were reduced to dust.

Xiao Yuansi formed a seal with his fingers once more. The blood on the ground surged toward the cauldron and was swallowed cleanly by it. The jade surface beneath was left pristine, without a single trace. It was as if the human livestock had never existed.

What a remarkable dharma artifact...

The two brothers exchanged a glance. Kongheng let out a soft sigh and said warmly, “Shangqi Xun Wind... Such masterful technique, senior.”

Xiao Yuansi shook his head, seemingly lost in thought. He continued walking up the jade steps, where he soon encountered a vast jade wall along the cliffside.

The wall was covered with carvings of numerous spells. Some for transformation, others for blood sacrifices, venom curses, or hexes. Most required blood qi, resentment qi, or sacrificial offerings to cast. These were all of Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realms. They were of little use to cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Ju Wu quickly explained, “Over the past centuries, Duanmu Kui occasionally had the whim to teach shamanic spells. There were six times in total. Everything he taught is recorded on this wall.”

Xiao Yuansi carefully examined every detail and committed it to memory. On the other hand, Li Xijun only casually glanced over it as he awaited his own people to record the inscriptions. Looking around, he did not find the spells that Mu Moli had previously cast, so he asked about it.

Ju Wu answered, “That green-faced ghost was something Mu Moli developed on his own... He kept proper talismanic rituals and transformation techniques at the Foundation Establishment Realm strictly to himself. There was no way he would teach us that!”

Ju Wu had clearly studied at Mount Wu itself, and spoke with evident resentment, “He got his hands on celestial texts and wielded Purple Mansion Realm shamanic spells with ease. Back then, he alone overpowered Chi Wei, Zhang Tianyuan, and Qing Jifang, while we, on the other hand, didn’t even have a single Foundation Establishment Realm shamanic spell to use!”

It’s no wonder that after Duanmu Kui’s death, the Mount Wu crowd defected to Azure Pond overnight...

Li Xijun listened carefully. It became clear that Duanmu Kui had never truly treated the Mount Wu cultivators as disciples. As such, the Mount Wu crowd had long shared a silent grievance. If they had possessed the strength to resist him, it was entirely possible that some would have abandoned Mount Wu for Azure Pond while Duanmu Kui was still alive.

As they spoke, Xiao Yuansi had memorized all the inscriptions on the jade wall. He stepped forward and spoke softly, “Answers to a Beggar’s Questions Under the Mulberry Tree is likely a Grade Seven or higher scripture. Only a few secluded sects from grotto-heaven and the cultivation techniques of Mount Luoxia could compare to it, let alone its exceptional material quality.”

Once they reached the summit, they saw a jade platform with numerous pillars of varying heights. These were inscribed with formation patterns for gathering spiritual energy. It seemed to be a dedicated cultivation ground.

The jade pillars varied in height, with the tallest featuring a jade throne, seemingly arranged according to status. They found a jade pool in the center, its blood long dried into blackened traces. A skeleton lay within, grotesque and grim.

Xiao Yuansi halted momentarily before stepping forward. He located the second-tallest jade pillar and tapped it three times in a precise sequence. The pillar instantly started to radiate light, its formation patterns glowing in sequence before ejecting a stone tablet. Xiao Yuansi caught it gently, brushed his hand over its surface and wiped away the protective layer of magical light.

Noting the astonished expressions of those around him, Xiao Yuansi remained silent for a moment before speaking, “There was a shaman who was a close friend of my uncle, Xiao Chuchou. His name was Dilu Tianfu. He specialized in talisman arts and also dabbled in demonic cultivation. His strength was formidable.”

A pained and complicated expression flashed across his face at the mention of Xiao Chuchou. His fists clenched unconsciously, and his breath grew slightly heavier as he continued, “Some time ago, as his lifespan approached its end, he sought to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. He rode the wind to my family, intending to entrust his affairs to us, only to learn that my uncle had long since passed away. So, he sought me out instead... He feared he would not survive his attempt to ascend and, having no heirs, left all his belongings behind. He also mentioned that he had hidden something in Mount Wu, which I have come to retrieve.”

When he saw Li Xijun nod in understanding, Xiao Yuansi handed the jade tablet to him and spoke softly, “You all examine this first. I will retrieve the rest.”

This is the reward.

Li Xijun accepted it with thanks, while Xiao Yuansi rode the wind toward a secluded part of the mountain. Meanwhile, Li Ximing gathered around to take a look at the jade tablet, which was engraved with an ancient secret technique.

Bone Carving Skin Exchange.

This secret technique recorded the Six Paths Blood Seeding Art, which required a certain level of cultivation to perform. The cultivator must capture a demonic beast alive and forcibly channel the demonic beast’s cultivation into themselves. This involved personally carving one’s bones and peeling one’s skin, then infusing their own body with the demonic beast’s blood and flesh, thereby absorbing its cultivation for personal use.

This technique required a demonic beast that shares a Dao resonance with the cultivator. Once it was completed, it allowed the user to assimilate the demonic beast’s cultivation, effectively possessing two Dao foundations within one body. This resulted in an immediate surge in power but, of course, permanently severed the possibility of breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm.

“So, this is a demonic technique of Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace.”

Both of them had keen eyes and quickly discerned the nature of this technique. It was merely another method of consuming another’s Dao foundation. Every sect had records of similar methods and several major devils during the Devil Plague had practiced it.

This technique was rarer in the mainland, but it was more common overseas, where cultivation techniques were spread more freely and with fewer taboos. Many Purple Mansion and Golden Core Realms cultivators practiced it. They usually practiced it by refining humans instead of demonic beasts, which yielded a higher success rate and a better integration with their Immortal Foundation.

Li Ximing, who harbored ambitions for the Purple Mansion Realm, glanced at it but found no interest. He silently stepped away and began examining the other jade pillars. Li Xijun, however, took the jade tablet, looked over it briefly, and read aloud, “During the process... one experiences the utmost pain in the world, nearly obliterating one’s consciousness. Once mastered, one may be influenced by demonic natures... which can lead to changes in temperament.”

Li Xijun immediately clicked his tongue in surprise. Cultivation manuals were always written with extreme conciseness, often omitting even the author’s name. For it to specifically mention ‘pain’ was already notable, let alone ‘the utmost pain in the world’. It was likely even more excruciating than the Molten Metal Cave, which was infamous for its agony-based cultivation.

“What a shame. Too many drawbacks... Otherwise, it could be useful...” said Li Xijun.

Li Xijun was genuinely considering it. Not everyone could be like Li Xuanfeng. If the family’s resources were pooled into producing just one Purple Mansion Realm cultivator or even simply an invincible Foundation Establishment protector, this technique could be an option.

This technique has too many flaws, but it is still a useful method. Our family should consider collecting similar ones, thought Li Xijun.

He silently continued to ponder as he transcribed the jade tablet. He had long since abandoned any hope for the Purple Mansion Realm and had no personal ambitions. As long as he could protect his elder brother, Li Ximing, and his grand-nephew, Li Zhouwei, he would feel fulfilled.

My path to the Purple Mansion Realm has already been severed, so be it. If it means creating an invincible Foundation Establishment Realm guardian like Ancestor Xuanfeng, then I alone can still support the family even if Ximing fails to break through.

Li Ximing did not notice this, but Kongheng, who knew Li Xijun well, saw it clearly. He guessed at Li Xijun’s thoughts and mused to himself, I’ve heard that Li Yuanyun spent his life struggling in cultivation and died destitute at the border towns. He was the most neglected of his family... Yet somehow, his line produced the brilliant Xijun brothers. How interesting...

As everyone remained lost in thought, Xiao Yuansi drifted back with an elated expression. It seemed he had gained much. There was even a trace of a smile on his face.

“Senior!” said Li Xijun as he returned the jade tablet. Xiao Yuansi glanced at it, stored it away without much thought and instead asked, “Xijun, does your esteemed family have intentions of unifying Moongaze Lake?”

As soon as these words left his mouth, Li Ximing appeared slightly awkward, while Li Xijun fell silent in contemplation. The atmosphere cooled instantly. Sensing the tension, Kongheng subtly stepped away, closed his eyes and began chanting scriptures.
