# Chapter 809: The Great Peacock Karma

Daoist Master Houfu was not a man of many words. Perhaps owing to his Xiukui lineage, he had a gloomy disposition and a reputation for being prideful. Li Ximing had always considered him a serious and cautious man.

Hearing Houfu say such a thing caught Li Ximing completely off guard. He had to hide his internal laughter.

'Oh, this is good. This is very good.'

But the peacock before them, who resembled a middle-aged man, narrowed his eyes. His colorful monastic robes pulsed with light as he spoke in a frigid tone, "Daoist... do you take me for a blind man!"

Houfu might have been bluffing, but the peacock certainly didn't buy it. If the great Daoist Master of the Azure Pond Sect, Chi Buzi, were truly present, how could he, Yu Guang, possibly still be standing here? Those two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators far surpassed him in strength. Yet, the pair before him were acting furtively and trying to change the subject. They must be terrified of provoking the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour!

Confidence surged in the peacock. He sneered, "I have heard that Chi Buzi is a green-eyed wraith with unbound hair, dressed in azure robes and golden tassels. His Divine Abilities are astonishing. How can two skulking curs like you possibly compare to him? Now, move!"

At those words, Houfu’s expression visibly darkened. His voice turned gravelly as he replied, "A brightly feathered chicken dares to bark like a rabid dog?"

The tension between them was thick enough to cut. If a fight broke out, Li Ximing would be the one forced to act. He quickly stepped forward, adopting a mild tone. "My colleague and I discovered this place together. By rights, what we find here is ours. How can it possibly belong to the Peacock Dao lineage?"

Yu Guang laughed, infuriated. He roared, "Stop playing dumb! You are merely stalling for time! Fine! I will see for myself exactly what kind of characters you are!"

His sleeve billowed as he summoned a vortex of iridescent flame from the void. The fire blazed fiercely even within the sea. With two fingers joined and his palm thrusting upward, he sent the flames smashing toward Houfu.

'It seems a fight is unavoidable...'

Li Ximing frowned slightly. 'I still underestimated Yu Guang’s position within the Buddhist Land. It seems that for a Merciful One—who is bold enough to maintain a path of retreat back in the Buddhist Land—the mere threat of two Purple Mansion cultivators isn't enough to make him retreat without testing us.'

They had already agreed that Li Ximing would be the one to fight. The Purple Mansion spiritual fire wasn't yet in hand, so Li Ximing couldn't refuse. He was preparing to raise his hand when the small bag in mid-air, still absorbing the treasure light, suddenly radiated a dark luster. From its flanks, the brilliant radiance of the Supreme Yang crackled and burst forth.

The Supreme Yang radiance moved naturally through the water, drifting before Houfu to intercept the attack. The Supreme Yang is the First Manifestation, and it instantly smothered the iridescent flames. As the two forces collided violently, Houfu’s icy voice cut through the turmoil: "Old mongrel, if you actually force my hand, you and your peacocks cannot afford the consequences!"

Yu Guang took one look and realized the pocket-like Dharma Artifact in the air was indeed no ordinary item. His lips moved, but no sound came out. A long bronze staff materialized in his hand. He took a single step into the void and vanished.

An intense warning sense flared in Li Ximing! The Profound Light between his brows pulsed, searching frantically, and his face stung with incipient pain. He cursed inwardly.

'Dammit... this colorful, bald donkey bullies the weak and fears the strong...'

Fortunately, Audience with the Celestial Gate inherently possessed aspects of a Body Divine Ability. The point of Profound Light between his brows was potent; it paused only a fraction of a second before locating the bronze staff striking toward him. Li Ximing’s lips buzzed, and he spat out a torrent of purple fire.

When he had previously dispersed the auspicious clouds unseen, he had used Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger specifically to avoid revealing his Bright Yang Divine Abilities. Now that he was in a direct confrontation, exposing the Bright Yang abilities was unavoidable; his Dharma Artifact was actually the more identifiable item. Thus, Li Ximing kept his artifact hidden, relying only on his Bright Yang flames to counter.

The purple fire transformed into a blazing violet serpent, slithering up the bronze staff and burning the Dharma power coating it with a sizzle. But Yu Guang’s momentum was ferocious. The staff flared with brilliant light, pressing the attack straight toward Li Ximing’s face.

*Bang!*

Li Ximing raised a hand, his palm reinforced by the Dharma power of his Bright Yang Divine Ability, and deflected the staff. His Dharma body shuddered from the impact. He seized the momentum to enter into the Great Void, only to feel a fiery sting erupt in his palm.

'This Merciful One... his Dharma body is impressively strong.'

Li Ximing had no intention of revealing the true form of Audience with the Celestial Gate—that would be tantamount to announcing his identity. By using only his Bright Yang abilities, he left himself some room for denial later.

Sure enough, the monk reversed his grip on the staff, his eyes widening in suspicion. "Bright Yang? Are you from the Cui family?"

The peacocks, after all, lived overseas. The most famous Bright Yang lineage in the Eastern Sea was unquestionably the Cui Clan of Chongzhou Island. Although the Li family had recently visited and the Cui clan had claimed their Purple Mansion experts were depleted, the Peacock Sea was too distant for Yu Guang to know this. His immediate suspicion falling upon the Cui clan was perfectly logical.

Now that Li Ximing had escaped into the Great Void, the monk did not pursue. Instead, he immediately dove toward the sea trench below. Houfu reappeared behind his pocket-like Dharma Artifact, placing both hands upon it to accelerate the absorption of the remaining treasure light.

Li Ximing had no choice but to step out of the Great Void, materializing in front of the monk to block him again. The monk instantly grew impatient. He hammered down twice with his staff, forcing Li Ximing back, then snatched a round disc from his sleeve.

The disc appeared to be bronze, glowing with an iridescent sheen. Its surface depicted a magnificent, multicolored Buddhist mural: a vast, vibrant ocean dominated by a spirit mountain that pierced the clouds. Spanning the sky above was an enormous peacock, roaring at the heavens. Kneeling beneath it was a naked woman, her face filled with piety, holding two swaddled bundles. The bundle in white cloth held an adorable, chubby baby; the bundle in red held a tiny, pink peacock, its beak open in a cry.

The eyes of the roaring peacock in the mural suddenly blazed, shooting twin beams of crimson light. Li Ximing was already wary and had preemptively entered the Great Void, yet he still felt a piercing pain between his brows. An instant later, a five-colored flame erupted onto his Dharma body. Sparks flew with the sharp sound of shattering glaze. *Crack!*

"Not good!"

After his ordeal with Changxiao, the sight of these flames struck terror into Li Ximing’s heart. He jumped several miles deeper into the Great Void. A box of spiritual water immediately materialized, and he slapped his Bright Yang Divine Ability over the wound, feeling a wave of soothing coolness.

Only then did he dare to inspect the damage. He found the flames had already vanished, leaving only a small, mottled mark on his Dharma body, about the size of a fingernail.

'Oh... that’s it? That’s pathetic.'

He felt a bead of sweat. Compared to Changxiao’s Dharma Art, this monk’s attack was a complete joke. Yet one was plain and simple, the other dazzling. Li Ximing stepped out of the void, purple flames erupting once more. The monk used his treasure to shine on him again. After several clashes, the monk demanded, "Which Dao lineage do you belong to, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing had once teamed up with Kongheng to suppress the [Wrathful Visage] Merciful One, Fu Xia. At that time, Fu Xia had already fallen to the level of a Master Monk, yet his Dharma body had endured their combined assaults unharmed. Now, Li Ximing was facing this new peacock with his full Purple Mansion cultivation, and this monk's Dharma body was clearly not weak. Unwilling to reveal his true Divine Abilities, Li Ximing found himself at a disadvantage relying on his Dharma body alone.

But Li Ximing lacked Houfu’s intimidating background; his only goal was to block the monk. He deliberately stalled for time. "This humble one is Gu Feng, merely a rogue cultivator from the Southern Sea. The item below now belongs to us; it has no fate with the Merciful Ones. I must ask you to retreat." He offered politeness before hostility, adding a threat, "Once the Great Daoist Master below finishes, your lineage may end up losing another Dharma Body today!"

Lingdu wasn't a "Great Daoist Master" at all and had no intention of revealing himself. Li Ximing was purely bluffing. Yet, although the peacock had forced Li Ximing onto the defensive, he possessed no decisive Divine Abilities. Annoyed by Li Ximing's persistence, the monk actually began to show hesitant, half-believing signs of withdrawal.

Yu Guang halted mid-water, his expression darkening. 'These two are acting suspiciously. This man has been fighting me this whole time but refuses to reveal his true Divine Abilities. If I force this into a battle to the death, am I not just forcing his hand to kill me? And that person holding the bag... that Dharma Artifact is far from simple. If that truly is the Supreme Yang lineage, this is deeply troublesome.'

He had to remember: the Great Bestowal Temple of Bronze Splendour had *just* lost a Merciful One. This group, hiding their faces and identities, was suspicious to the extreme. Could they be the very cultivators who murdered Yuse? If so, staying here meant death!

Li Ximing didn’t know if Yu Guang had truly believed the bluff or if the monk simply lacked the confidence to break through his defenses. 'The peacocks of the Great Bestowal Temple must have lived too comfortably in their Peacock Sea,' Li Ximing mused. 'How do they compare to the cutthroat cultivators of Jiangnan? He won’t commit to fighting, yet he won’t fully retreat. He’s just wasting the opportunity. If he rushed down right now, he might even be able to negotiate a share. Since we clearly don't want to expose ourselves...' Their minds were on completely different tracks, their judgments worlds apart. But the Merciful One's intention to withdraw was solidifying.

Yu Guang ceased his attacks. He didn’t dare direct his parting words at Houfu, who held the suspected Supreme Yang treasure. Instead, he fixed Li Ximing with a glare, clasped his hands together, and said coldly, "Daoist Gu Feng, you have taken an artifact of our Buddhist Land. Karma will surely follow. You may return it personally to the Buddhist Land, or retribution will find you, and you will lose both your life and your treasure. This old monk has given his warning. We will be waiting!"

Li Ximing almost laughed at the peacock’s sanctimonious display. He shook his head and replied, matching the hostility, "If you bald-feathered birds don’t leave now, we will be the ones sending you back to the Buddhist Land—in pieces!"

Yu Guang’s expression turned venomous. He finally vanished.

Li Ximing recalled his Dharma power and flew toward the shallower water. The pillar of treasure light had already weakened to the thickness of a finger. Houfu gave the bag a final tug, absorbing the remnants, before turning to Li Ximing and nodding. "My thanks, Zhaojing. You bore the burden this time."

That bald bird was fierce in appearance but timid in reality, intimidated entirely by Houfu’s Supreme Yang artifact. Li Ximing hadn't even needed to deploy Audience with the Celestial Gate. This hardly counted as taking the fall; at most, he had attracted a flicker of suspicion. In exchange, he was getting a Purple Mansion spiritual fire. How could that possibly be considered a burden? He cupped his hands. "It is I who must thank Daoist Houfu!"

He meant it sincerely. Although Houfu's artifact was now exposed, he hadn't needed to reveal it. Since the plan had designated Li Ximing as the fighter, Houfu could have easily remained hidden and let Li Ximing shoulder the entire confrontation. Without the deterrent of that Supreme Yang radiance combined with Houfu's verbal threats, Yu Guang would likely never have withdrawn.

Houfu waved him off, his voice heavy. "That Yu Guang brought the [Peacock’s Providence Disc]. That was unexpected. If not for the fact that his cultivation base is insufficient and he clearly has not earned the treasure's full recognition, this confrontation would not have ended so easily."

"So it was the monk who was weak, not the treasure that was all show."

Li Ximing nodded, seizing the opportunity to ask, "I seldom encounter the artifacts of Buddhist cultivators. Do all of them possess their own spirituality? Why do they reach the point of needing 'recognition' from the wielder?"

Houfu sneered. "A Dharma Artifact is a tool, and a Daoist Master is a person. A Buddhist treasure is also a tool... but does a Merciful One even count as a person? Within the Buddhist Land, they are nothing but slaves to the Mahas. If a wealthy man acquires a fine carriage, is the driver necessarily more esteemed than the carriage itself? If one is a landlord, the tenant farmer is less valuable than the ox. It is the same principle. Whether it's 'recognized' or not simply depends on whether the master decides to assign that ox to that farmer."

His words dripped with sarcasm. "That [Peacock’s Providence Disc] is the personal treasure of the Peacock’s Son. It should be equivalent to one of our Dharma Treasures. It really ought to have its own classification..."

Li Ximing frowned. "That is precisely my confusion. Why don’t the Buddhist cultivators delineate their items clearly? A Master Monk uses a Treasured Artifact, a Merciful One uses a Treasured Artifact, and a Maha also uses a Treasured Artifact. Isn’t that incredibly confusing?"

At this topic, Houfu’s sarcastic smile deepened. He retrieved his bulging, sack-like Dharma Artifact. "If they delineated them clearly, what grand opera would the Buddhist Land have left to perform? How many Dharma Treasures has the Immortal Dao passed down through the ages? And how many Dharma Treasure-level artifacts has the Buddhist Land managed to create? We must exceed them tenfold! And what if we compare Dharma Treasures? My Supreme Yang lineage alone can name seven distinct Dharma Treasures! And that’s not counting all those lost to the ages."

"How could those idiots from the Seven Paths ever accept such a comparison? So, within the Buddhist Land, only a treasure personally wielded by a Maha is called a Enlightened Artifact. If a mere Merciful One wishes to use one, they must formally *request* it!"

Li Ximing finally nodded, his understanding clearing. 'If that's the case,' he thought, 'then artifacts at the Dharma Treasure level are vanishingly rare among them. This means the status of the Peacock clan is likely far greater than even the rumors suggest.'

They exchanged a few more words before Lingdu’s aged voice suddenly echoed in their ears: "Fellow Daoists, the matter here is concluded. Please grip the lotus seed in the web of your thumb, take a wide detour through the Great Void, and cover your tracks. Come to Nine Mounds."

Joy flashed in Li Ximing’s heart. He exchanged a glance with Houfu. Without another word, they immediately split up, vanishing into the Great Void.

Once inside the Great Void, Li Ximing felt a coolness radiating from the web of his thumb. He flew east through the void, going all the way to the Sea's Cape. He then looped more than halfway around the Cape, almost reaching the World's Navel, before finally turning toward the Nine Mounds immortal mountain.

By the time he arrived at the mountain, two days had passed. Houfu was already waiting in the courtyard before the main gate, sipping tea. He was clearly waiting. Seeing Li Ximing finally arrive, he remarked, "Zhaojing is exceedingly cautious."

'How can I not be cautious? I was the one who fought. The Bright Yang lineage isn't known for stealth, unlike your Xiukui path that comes and goes without a trace...'

He merely cupped his hands and smiled. "My apologies for making Senior wait!"

So much time had been wasted that Houfu didn't bother offering him tea. He swept the entire tea set away with one motion, eliminating any chance for small talk, and the two proceeded inside together.

Passing through a maple forest, they found Lingdu leaning on his cane. Standing before him was another person—a tall figure dressed in profound black robes, cinched at the waist by a white and green sash. His dark hair was bound neatly, cascading down his back.

Perhaps hearing their footsteps, the man turned. He possessed the features of a young man, strikingly elegant, but his pupils were faintly red, radiating an unsettling, demonic aura. He did not look like a benevolent figure.

Seeing that even Lingdu stood respectfully a half-step behind him, Li Ximing knew who this must be. Beside him, Houfu lowered his head—for the first time Li Ximing had seen—and spoke with deep deference. "Junior Houfu greets Daoist Master Yuandao!"

Li Ximing quickly followed suit, bowing deeply. "Junior Zhaojing pays his respects to the Great Daoist Master."

Li Ximing had long heard tales of this Great Daoist Master of the Dantai family, Dantai Lingtong. This Daoist Master Yuandao had supposedly already refined his *fifth* Divine Ability, placing his cultivation even higher than Si Boxiu's! He was a Great Daoist Master at the absolute peak of the Purple Mansion Realm. Even a Maha would not dare act arrogantly in his presence and would have to treat him as an equal.

After they completed their bows, the Great Daoist Master’s temperament proved entirely contrary to his unsettling appearance. His voice was warm, polite, and calm as still water, entirely lacking in arrogance. "Please, both of you, sit."

Li Ximing sat down obediently. Houfu also seemed unusually subdued. Only Lingdu moved comfortably, preparing tea for the three of them. Daoist Master Yuandao looked over with a smile. "How is fellow Daoist Lou Xing these days? It has been some time since I last saw him."

The question was clearly directed at Houfu. Li Ximing kept his gaze low. Houfu replied gravely, "The Ancestor was stuck comprehending the 'Purple Mystery' for a century, and it wore down his spirit. Although he has now broken through... he does not have much time remaining. He often speaks to me of the Great Daoist Master's Divine Abilities... He misses you greatly."

Daoist Master Yuandao rested one hand on the table as he accepted the small cup from Lingdu. Li Ximing caught a glimpse of a fine, dark sandalwood prayer chain looped around his wrist. The Great Daoist Master nodded, then turned his gaze to Li Ximing. "The next generation is truly formidable. I had thought Houfu achieving his Divine Ability so young was impressive, but I did not expect Zhaojing to be his equal. A rogue cultivator attaining the Purple Mansion Realm in less than a century... truly remarkable."

Given the stature of the man sitting before him, the Li family’s meager foundation was nothing. Calling Li Ximing a rogue cultivator wasn't wrong. Li Ximing would not correct him, replying only, "Junior was merely fortunate. It cannot compare to the Great Daoist Master’s vast abilities."

Daoist Master Yuandao chuckled softly. "We troubled you this time. Lingdu did indeed acquire the spiritual fire from that palace monastery... Lingdu!"

Lingdu quickly retrieved a small, vermillion ceramic bowl from his robes and placed it carefully on the table.

The bowl was exquisite and delicate, no larger than a baby’s fist. It was smooth and immaculate. Within its dark interior, a single, grayish-red flame, no bigger than a grain of rice, flickered, surrounded by a faint five-colored halo.

Daoist Master Yuandao sipped his tea. Seeing that Li Ximing didn't recognize the item, he explained, "This is the [Small Peacock Karma Merging Fire]. You can refer to it simply as [Small Peacock Karma]. Do not be fooled by its rice-grain appearance in this bowl; if released, it would likely swell to the size of a mountain peak."

He continued, "This fire is a transmutation of the [Lustful Merging Fire]. That fire is the second type of fire exhaled from the beaks of coupling Yuwu birds... The first fire they exhale corresponds to the Supreme Yang; this second fire corresponds to Bright Yang, possessing the effect of sexual union."

"Thus, the ancient Yuwu birds were omens of wanton revelry in broad daylight. This is the reason."

This level of esoteric Dao discussion left not only Li Ximing stunned, but even Houfu was staring at the bowl with rapt attention. The Great Daoist Master paused. He flicked a finger lightly, and the sound of a great bell chimed, echoing across the entire immortal mountain.

Lingdu explained from the side, "The Great Daoist Master is discussing ancient True Monarchs and Demon Monarchs. He must first alert the disciples to guard themselves, lest the Merging Fire descend in response to the mention and burn the forests."

Daoist Master Yuandao paused briefly, then continued, "This fire was obtained by the Great Peacock and passed to his eldest son. That son entered the Buddhist Dao—his name must not be spoken—and cultivated this fire into the [Great Peacock Karma]. From his seat, the [Small Peacock Karma] was born. This is that flame."

He concluded, "The [Small Peacock Karma] can be classified as a Merging Fire. Among Purple Mansion spiritual fires, its power is considerable. It ranks in the mid-to-upper tier, at least."

Li Ximing felt a mix of joy and regret.

He had long prepared himself for the possibility that the spiritual fire he received would not be the Li Fire he desperately wanted. The world's flames were myriad... Yet he had participated resolutely, driven by the Intercalary Sun Art. The Intercalary Sun Art was originally Tu Longjian’s great opportunity; it allowed certain flames to be converted between paths, primarily involving the Li, True, and Molten Fire paths.

However, the *Art* did not cover every flame within those three categories, and furthermore, the Merging Fire path existed entirely outside its scope. Li Ximing had already prepared himself for the inability to convert it. He was not a greedy man—any Purple Mansion spiritual fire was a massive gain.

Although this was a Merging Fire, based on the Great Daoist Master’s words, its power was exceptional. Li Ximing still felt the exchange was more than worth it. Joy filled his heart, but another doubt immediately surfaced.

'I merely attracted a flicker of suspicion. Do I truly deserve such a reward? This Merging Fire practically has the word "Peacock" written all over it! If I actually use this against an enemy, won't I be cementing myself as the culprit?'

If Daoist Master Yuandao hadn't explained its origin, Li Ximing would have accepted it after some polite refusals. But since the Great Daoist Master was sitting right here and had been so explicit, Li Ximing had no choice but to state respectfully, "A flame of such power... this Junior is unworthy to receive it. Please, Great Daoist Master, take it back!"

Hearing this, Daoist Master Yuandao raised an eyebrow slightly and shook his head. "There is no need for such ceremony. Your family is a power under the Immortal Mansion's governance. My Supreme Mound Dao lineage has deep ties to the Immortal Mansion. It is only natural to look after one of our own. It is just a spiritual fire."

Li Ximing was inwardly staggered. 'A Dao lineage with deep ties to the Immortal Mansion... If they are contemporaries, does that mean the Dantai family is on par with the founder of the Mansion? Even if they are a level below, that still makes them a "Three Sects" level power... No wonder he is so formidable! The Dantai family’s background is truly profound!'

He hurriedly bowed again. "Senior! One should only receive reward proportional to their merit. This Junior dares not be greedy. Furthermore, this [Small Peacock Karma] is a treasure of the peacocks. For this Junior to take it would be like holding a burning coal... I absolutely dare not accept it!"

Daoist Master Yuandao did not move, allowing him to complete the first bow. Only then did he reach out, gently halting Li Ximing's attempt to bow further. "Zhaojing, you are too polite," he said softly. "Set your mind at ease. Since I have explained this matter to you, I naturally have no intention of harming you."
