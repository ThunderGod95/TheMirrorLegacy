# Chapter 1262: A Scheme Within a Scheme

The night gradually darkened as bright stars hung in the sky. Faint moonlight drifted along the mountain ranges and fell upon the undulating forest, revealing a brightly gleaming pass atop a majestic peak.

The pass looked as if it were built from white stone, its radiance magnificent and its divine light brilliant. It was less a pass and more a celestial gate—it was Zanmen, the first pass from the Central Plains into the Guanzhong region.

Great Wei was founded in Guanlong, its foundation lying within the pass. This very pass had been constructed by the Wei Emperor's general, Lian Fu, and was named Han Pass. After the fall of Wei, it was abandoned by the Qi Emperor and lay in ruins for many years.

When the Great Liang was established, the Touba clan, believing themselves the inheritors of the Wei lineage, established their capital in Guanzhong and rebuilt the pass. Touba Xuantan dispatched his younger brother, Touba Xuanzan, to forge the pass using Bright Yang, giving rise to the Zanmen of today.

Because of this history, the place shone with the light of the Bright Yang. A stream of light came speeding over, and upon striking the Bright Yang light, flakes of azure fell. Gongsun Bei's expression grew somber, and he halted his advance.

News of Luoxia's fall reached the Zhao capital late in the night, startling the secluded Gongsun Bei from his cultivation. He had rushed from Gaoping, while Jiang Toushou, who had been preparing to journey to the great desert, had urgently turned back from Shuofang. Both had spent a considerable amount of time, and by the time all parties had finished their bickering, the various divine ability wielders arriving at Zanmen found that it was already the evening of the second day.

Nearly a full day and night.

Gongsun Bei even found it somewhat laughable.

'A day and a night. It only took Great Wei a day and a night to pacify the Sushen beyond the passes.'

Yet for Great Zhao, Luoxia, a fertile land just beyond the pass, had been out of contact for a day and a night, and they had not even managed to dispatch forces from Zanmen. Even when Great Wei had been on the verge of collapse, it had only taken Cui Jun, stationed in Shuofang, ten double-hours to reach Luoxia and face the enemy.

'Even a junior cultivator would have acted faster.'

But in the current situation, everyone in the imperial court had to bear responsibility. The complete fragmentation of Great Zhao had granted the regional clans and the Seven Aspects immense power, and that naturally came with a price.

The sky gradually dimmed. Gongsun Bei gazed into the brilliant white distance—the illusory multicolored lights of divine abilities above Luoxia's zenith had ceased, giving him an extremely ominous premonition.

He spoke in a low voice, "Mount Liangchuan… there are no signs of a battle?"

The clouds behind him were permeated with a faint golden radiance as Jiang Toushou withdrew his divine arts, transforming into a sharp-chinned monk flanked by a nun and an old Buddhist monk. The nun was unremarkable, but the old monk stood on the yellow earth, draped in the color of black gold, appearing quite imposing.

Buddhist cultivators had always enjoyed displaying their sanctity before others, and now, being forced to maintain a low profile, they seemed extremely ill at ease, their gazes heavy.

Gongsun Bei was both surprised and delighted when he saw the old Buddhist cultivator behind him.

'This Jiang Toushou is truly capable, he actually managed to invite Xiaodisa!'

This Xiaodisa was the sixth-generation Maha of the Way of Great Desire. He had been cultivating in the Xiao Mountains due to certain karmic ties, and it was by chance that an order came down from the mountain, allowing Jiang Toushou to successfully invite him!

Clearly, Jiang Toushou had planned this for some time; his words in the imperial court had not been entirely empty boasts!

The monk's hands never stopped moving, his thumb constantly tapping against his knuckles. His gaze grew increasingly grim. After an unknown amount of time, he finally spoke in a cold tone:

"It's no wonder no news came from the sacred mountain. The Yang family has made a move; it's impossible to calculate. But some earlier information has come through. Several people saw Li Zhouwei soundly defeat Lu Fu in Xiangxiang. It must have been the Yang family's doing, allowing him to infiltrate without anyone noticing. That old fool Jia Zan has definitely surrendered."

If Luoxia were a sea of fire and chaos, Gongsun Bei would have been more at ease. Now, it was utterly silent, with not even a whisper from the nearby region of Boye. How could he not be suspicious?

They all understood it clearly in their hearts.

'Since Li Zhouwei could mysteriously appear in Xiangxiang, he could just as silently lie in ambush in Boye, before Zanmen, or on the road to Liangchuan!'

The general's alarmed and uncertain gaze swept around.

Jiang Toushou simply said, "I'll just send someone to take a look."

He flicked his finger, and a brilliant, multicolored light scattered down, seeming to open the gates to some distant paradise and drawing forth a ray of golden light. The golden light landed and transformed into a monk, who bowed before the group and said in a low voice:

"Greetings, my lords…"

This person was cloaked in golden flames, his eyes downcast, and his aura was not overbearing. Even though he was extremely humble, Jiang Toushou showed him no courtesy, saying coldly,

"Nuyan—you scout the path ahead."

This person was none other than Nuyan, the Merciful One of the Way of Great Desire.

Nuyan's expression changed drastically.

This old fellow had quite a history. He had accompanied Nuxiao to contend for Bai Yinzi back then and had his Dharma Body carelessly destroyed by Li Ximing. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Later, Nuxiao died at Moongaze Lake, but he managed to survive!

After his injuries had healed slightly, he was sent to serve as a hidden soldier at the White Ye Immortal Sect due to his past transgressions. This was supposed to be an unpleasant assignment, but unexpectedly, Li Zhouwei launched a surprise attack on Baixiang Valley and slayed Vast Cicada in battle. The situation changed dramatically, allowing him to escape with his life once more.

But in the great battle of Lake Xian, Maha Nuzi fell. Nuyan had been relying on this disciple-brother to survive. With his sins still unatoned for, he immediately fell into deep trouble and was locked away in Mount Dayang's Chang'a Prison.

This Chang'a Prison was a place for criminals. The cell next to his housed Five-Eyed, who was still living in a cauldron of oil to this day. Nuyan's crimes were lighter, and after enduring his share of suffering, he was promptly sent to Jiang Toushou's side.

How could he not know who was beyond the pass! Even Vast Cicada had died; how many moves could he, Nuyan, withstand against that person? He probably wouldn't even have a chance to disintegrate and return to the Buddhist Land!

'The Way of Great Desire ignores me, and now this Jiang Toushou wants to harm me!'

But there was no path of betrayal for Buddhist cultivators; they had already surrendered their very life-mandates, so what could he do now? He could only lower his gaze and say,

"I fear I will be suppressed by the enemy and unable to bring back news… I ask that my lord grant me a treasure, so that I might send a warning."

Jiang Toushou's expression softened slightly. He gently turned his hand over, revealing a pale white talisman, and said,

"This item was a gift from a friend of the Precepts Dao and is called a Law-Finding Trace Talisman. Carry this talisman forward. If any divine ability is concealed and observing from the distant Great Void, this talisman will respond immediately!"

This talisman was clearly nothing special; forget Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasures, even some simple concealment arts could evade it. Its advantage, however, was its extremely wide range. If the enemy had an ambush, it was impossible that every single person would possess a concealment technique.

So he sent him on his way and sat upon the pass to wait. After a while, Gongsun Bei saw that he actually dared to sit there and wait, and felt both shocked and furious, a sense of disappointed anger rising within him. He couldn't help but speak,

"Lord Jiang, why not dispatch several people to take a look at Mount Liangchuan?"

Although Jiang Toushou was unaware of the situation, he knew that this was absolutely not the time to divide their forces. His expression changed drastically as he said,

"Absolutely not!"

The Maha continued,

"I've heard that the last place where the divine ability's power faded was Ruzhou. That demon must have attacked from the southeast. The Tao clan are like pigs and dogs, with no loyalty to the state, but they won't necessarily surrender at the first sign of trouble. It's possible… that demon is preparing an ambush for our reinforcements at Mount Liangchuan!"

Jiang Toushou was already prepared for the worst. He added,

"And… what if Mount Liangchuan has already fallen! Wouldn't that be seeking our own doom?"

Gongsun Bei frowned and said,

"But we cannot delay any longer. He must be consolidating his control over Luoxia. Whether there's an ambush or not is hard to say, but if we don't send people east soon, we'll be facing not just the Song soldiers, but also the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of Luoxia!"

Jiang Toushou was momentarily speechless, but then he saw Gongsun Bei say,

"I have a plan. I ask Lord Jiang to send a few people to Mount Liangchuan to create a diversion. Whether they are ambushed en route or in Boye, they absolutely cannot afford to ignore it."

"Even if Mount Liangchuan has fallen, Li Zhouwei won't have many men there. Jiang Fuwang is resourceful and quick-witted. If I'm not mistaken, he must have gone to Mianchi to get reinforcements. As long as we send men north and they call for aid from afar once battle breaks out, he will surely lead his forces to support them."

Jiang Toushou asked doubtfully:

"Then what about you and I?"

Gongsun Bei said in a low voice:

"We abandon Boye and immediately take a detour. We will gather all our strength and head to Xiangxiang!"

His expression was grave.

"Boye is guarded by the Qiao clan… they have no Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, Lord Jiang. A clan without a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator will stubbornly defend their great array, and they would certainly not dare let another clan's Purple Mansion Realm cultivators enter and do as they please. I am extremely confident—only those with Purple Mansion Realm cultivators will surrender; those without will not dare to!"

"There has been no major conflict in Boye, so it certainly has not fallen. There's no need to even look! If Xiangxiang and Liangchuan are threatened simultaneously, Li Zhouwei will inevitably be stretched thin—we have Zanmen at our back, which he cannot attack even if left undefended. He, however, has nothing behind him!"

As soon as these words were spoken, before Jiang Toushou could even reply, the Xiaodisa behind him paled dramatically.

These two were in cahoots. Who else but him, Xiaodisa, could lead men to Mount Liangchuan? He had come reluctantly in the first place, so how could he put himself in harm's way to test an ambush? His face quickly darkened as he said:

"I came with good intentions to assist you, but it turns out you two want me to be the bait! Is this how Mount Dayang conducts its affairs?"

He appeared utterly furious. Jiang Toushou had just sent a man from the Way of Great Desire to his death, so it was truly difficult for him to say much at this moment. He also had other concerns,

"But… what if Li Zhouwei is hiding in Boye? If we advance deep into Xiangxiang and he cuts off our retreat, what then? We'll have his sharp blades on one side and a Xiangxiang whose array has been seized at our feet. Zanmen is indeed indestructible, but we would have gone too far. If your guess is wrong and Boye has already fallen, it will cost us our lives!"

"The great arrays of the Jia and Wei families fell just like that, without any response. Why couldn't Boye's? We should first probe the situation in Boye before making further plans—if we gather our divine abilities, and there is an ambush here, we can turn the tables on him and catch him off guard."

Gongsun Bei was left speechless.

'Still probing? Has reading scriptures in a temple made you stupid! This is Li Zhouwei! This is a battle where every second counts! Did Li Zhouwei probe his way through family by family? What a joke!'

He said urgently,

"The families of Luoxia are only looking at the overall situation. They will side with whoever holds the foundation. Li Zhouwei's momentum is overwhelming. Now, he's beset on all sides and must suppress the local regions to intimidate the various families."

"If Xiangxiang is threatened, Jia Zan will rebel. If Ruzhou falls, Yu Yang will betray him. The more territories we threaten, the more unstable the divine ability wielders under him will become. He absolutely cannot allow us to split our forces! He must be seeking a direct confrontation with us, a great battle in Boye. How can we let him have his way!"

"We cannot wait any longer!"

Jiang Toushou's eyes showed a hint of hesitation, and he cursed inwardly,

'How could this Xiaodisa possibly cooperate! He's extremely wary of me and would never agree to split our forces!'

As expected, the old monk had already taken a step forward, staring grimly at the Daoist Master before him, and said,

"General Gongsun is anxious and perhaps a bit too reckless!"

Gongsun Bei was stunned to hear this. He said urgently,

"I cultivate divine abilities and do not hesitate to risk my life. You two are Buddhist cultivators, so why do you cherish a mere Dharma Body so much?!"

Xiaodisa was not a good-tempered person to begin with. Being questioned so bluntly, he immediately grew angry and cursed,

"Gongsun, you little brat! You have offended the Li clan and are burning with killing intent, yet you dare to use my Buddhist divine abilities to further your malicious agenda! Do you take all Buddhists for three-year-old children!"

Gongsun Bei never imagined he would receive such a reply. He laughed in fury and said,

"I only wish to salvage this perilous situation and alleviate our predicament slightly, so that we will have some room to maneuver next year! Besides, if Buddhist cultivators have no intention of harming the Li, then why did Vast Cicada and Nuzi die! You are short-sighted, clinging to life and profit, so why bother hiding behind some grand banner!"

He couldn't be bothered to argue with the person before him anymore. He glared at the silent Jiang Toushou and said angrily,

"Does Lord Jiang share his opinion?!"

Jiang Toushou was silent for a moment. He pressed his palms together. No matter how dissatisfied he was with Xiaodisa, with a great battle imminent, he had to mediate. He said seriously,

"I am aware of General Gongsun's sincere heart… The Maha also has his doubts, considering General Gongsun's history with that demon…"

Seeing that he wouldn't call him a Wei remnant to avoid karmic entanglement, nor was he willing to call him King Wei, and had settled on 'demon' as a compromise, Gongsun Bei felt as if hot oil were boiling in his heart, a violent rage surging,

'Fierce in appearance but timid in heart, devoid of both grace and authority. He's not even worth one of Qi Lanyan's fingers! No wonder he was utterly outmaneuvered when he led his men south!'

Xiaodisa, however, sneered.

"General Gongsun is not wrong. If the general is willing to pledge allegiance to my Way of Great Desire, I am not against fulfilling the general's wish!"

Gongsun Bei was not actually a good-tempered person; it was only his humble origins and years of living under others' roofs that had forced him to suppress his nature. Seeing the other party continue to humiliate him, his voice finally turned cold:

"I, Gongsun Bei, have conquered barbarians and pacified the northern tribes of Wuchuan. Though I may not be a hero of this age, I am a valiant knight of the Yanmen region. How could I stoop to serving under the Chandana Forest!"

These words were powerful and resonant.

But they also tore away the last shred of civility.

Xiaodisa's expression instantly turned to ice, and Jiang Toushou's face changed as well.

He stared at him coldly.

"Gongsun Bei, you have a lot of nerve!"

The general ignored him completely, simply sitting down on the gatehouse as if he had already sunk into meditative cultivation, not uttering another word.

Silence fell upon Zanmen. Jiang Toushou's expression grew uglier, and seeing this, Xiaodisa found it difficult to speak as well. He also turned around and closed his eyes in contemplation.

The group waited in silence until a vibrant, multicolored light rose from the horizon. A golden body the size of a mountain peak stood up abruptly, accompanied by a deafening roar!

It was Nuyan!

Jiang Toushou gave a cold glance and realized that what had startled him was merely an early-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. He glanced at the jade talisman in his palm, deliberately turned it towards Gongsun Bei, and his urgent divine ability echoed,

"News has arrived. The great array of Boye is sealed shut, and an ambush is suspected… We will leave the pass immediately!"

But Gongsun Bei couldn't be bothered to explain anymore. He slowly opened his eyes, their depths colored with a faint gloom:

'My life is forfeit, I will be done in by these two Buddhists!'

…

Boye.

The colors in the sky were slowly spreading across the heavens. Yin Juexi's expression was somewhat grave as he pinched a stream of light between his fingers, frowning at the golden body in the distance and sighing inwardly.

He and Liu Changdie had received their orders and had come all this way, hoping to find a tactical opportunity.

But the Qiao clan's Purple Mansion Realm grand array was clearly displayed in the Great Void. After scouting the area, he found that this clan had no Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of its own. The moment they saw divine abilities flashing to the south, they were like birds startled by the twang of a bowstring and had activated their great array.

Faced with such a declining clan, Yin Juexi was truly at a loss for a time—he couldn't even find someone to communicate with! As soon as he approached the Purple Mansion Realm grand array, the array would sense him. The Qiao clan was also a major clan and feared the Life Divine Ability; they would never respond to a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator!

Although Yin Juexi could find some Qiao clan members within the prefecture, it was clear that the people inside the array would not open it for the sake of a few clansmen. He decided not to alert the enemy and simply watched the array operate in silence.

Liu Changdie, who had come with him, was of the 'Vault Metal' lineage, skilled in setting up arrays, not breaking them, so he said even less. Li Zhouwei had anticipated this and had given instructions. Thus, Yin Juexi had remained stationed in Boye, waiting in the Great Void and observing the approaching reinforcements.

What he probably didn't expect was that this wait would last a full day and a night. Yin Juexi found it hard to believe, even thinking that the Zhao forces had given up on this excellent breakthrough point and had decided to advance through Liangchuan instead.

It wasn't until this Buddhist cultivator arrived furtively that he finally realized just how slow Great Zhao's reaction speed was…

'If I had known this, the two of us could have followed the King of Wei to pacify the other regions and come back later. It wouldn't have been too late at all!'

He activated a jade talisman to alert Li Zhouwei while quietly waiting, circulating his 'Assistance in Usurpation'.

This divine ability could perceive disturbances and had some scouting capabilities, making it suitable for this location, which was how he was able to detect Nuyan from afar.

The monk made his way to the front of the array, only to be unexpectedly met with the Qiao clan's cold shoulder!

The Qiao family didn't dare let cultivators from the south in, but they were even more terrified of letting a single Merciful One in—Buddhist cultivators had a notorious reputation. How could they open their own great array and place their lives in one person's hands, gambling on the monk's goodwill?

But responding was a problem, and not responding was also a problem. It was better to remain silent and defend themselves!

This, however, startled Nuyan.

'Could it be that Li Zhouwei has already arrived and is waiting silently within the array, just waiting for the cultivators to fall into his trap?'

This was highly likely—he, Nuyan, was merely a Merciful One, a small fry to the Great Song. The people in the array remaining inactive was naturally to bait a bigger fish!

At this thought, he didn't dare to linger. While using the jade talisman to warn Jiang Toushou, he pushed the other talisman to its limit. An invisible light flowed out, finally discovering Yin Juexi, who was waiting quietly in the distance.

'Assistance in Usurpation' was a divine ability that could stir the world, its radiance brilliant and extremely difficult to conceal. Although Yin Juexi had secret techniques from his Dao to suppress his aura and was hiding far away, he was ultimately detected by the talisman!

On the other hand, Liu Changdie, who was closer, was of the Vault Metal. His concealment was subtle, and he easily evaded the talisman's detection.

Nuyan, however, was already as skittish as a startled bird. The moment he detected the aura of a divine ability, he didn't even try to gauge the opponent's strength. Without a second thought, he pushed his own divine ability to its limit, his entire Dharma Body igniting as he transformed into a streak of golden light to flee!

Yin Juexi knew this was bad.

"Since they've dispatched troops, it can't just be one Merciful One. There must be many divine ability wielders!"

Without hesitation, he also shot up, retreating slightly. Cultivation Transcendence allowed for extremely fast movement through the Great Void, and he vanished in an instant!

Jiang Toushou, however, did not hesitate. He exchanged a look with Xiaodisa, and the divine arts they had long prepared were instantly unleashed. They soared up on light, revealing their forms!

One had a face like white jade, his sharp chin like a lotus calyx, his golden body covered in a cold glaze. His fingers were held in the flower-plucking mudra, and between them was hidden a necklace of one hundred and eight skulls, flashing with a golden-white light. The purple smoke around him transformed into various horrors, all bearing ferocious fangs.

The other was cast from black copper, his fleshy topknot like a stacked mountain. He held a black urn forged from meteoric iron and wore a kasaya that was neither silk nor hemp. Its hem trailed on the yellow earth, and his ankles were bound in heavy shackles that shone with a dark light.

The two sixth-reincarnation Mahas revealed their forms simultaneously. They did not pursue Yin Juexi deeply, but instead enveloped the Qiao clan's grand array in Boye and the surrounding prefectures. The sound of Buddhist chanting filled the heavens and the earth!

At the same time, other golden bodies manifested throughout the world, taking their seats one after another. A total of four appeared, instantly forming an array that drew upon the light of the Buddhist Land, causing all the multicolored lights to brighten by more than a degree.

Jiang Toushou's eyes shone brightly for a moment.

'Even if Li Zhouwei himself were here, facing such suppression, he would absolutely not be able to escape easily!'

The rolling Buddhist light shone down, smashing into the great array with a tremendous roar. The Great Void was also filled with myriad colors, finally forcing out a faint golden light that stabilized itself in the mortal world.

'He didn't come from within the array?'

Jiang Toushou was stunned, only to realize that the person trapped by the two of them had only two divine abilities and was an unknown Daoist Master.

The two of them had been aiming for the cultivators within the array, but their sudden attack had inadvertently trapped the concealed Liu Changdie nearby!

Jiang Toushou's brows furrowed instantly, great suspicion rising in his heart, but he knew this was no time to hesitate.

"There's no time to worry about that!"

The purple energy in his palm pressed down without hesitation, carrying with it a torrent of divine arts. Xiaodisa also raised his black urn and smashed it down with a crash. In an instant, light and electricity intertwined, multicolored lights flowed, and killing intent surged.

These Merciful Ones, acting in concert with the two sixth-generation Mahas, had already stirred the Buddhist Land, causing a paradise to faintly appear on the horizon!

The terrifying thing was not them, but the descending light of the Buddhist Land, which, like a spring breeze, severed the connection between the Great Void and Liu Changdie to a minimum, while drawing him infinitely closer to the descending Buddhist Land!

Faced with the overwhelming killing intent, Liu Changdie was not panicked—if he didn't have a few divine arts up his sleeve, how would he have dared to linger near Zanmen?

A silver light flickered between his brows, and a touch of gold had already appeared between his two fingers.

The Profound Vault Invitation Letter.

As he completed his cultivation of Heavenly Harmonising Fullness, this Spiritual Treasure in his hand instantly shone with a completely different color. Behind him, a deep, buried ocean of gold seemed to surface. An invisible gate opened with a rumble, ignoring the suppression of the Buddhist Land and easily swallowing him whole.

The Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master thus vanished under the terrifying killing formation of two sixth-generation Mahas and several Merciful Ones connected to the Buddhist Land, leaving not a single trace behind!

'What?!'

Jiang Toushou's pupils dilated instantly.

'What Dao Lineage is this? Metal Virtue? Is there such a Metal Virtue?!'

But it was all too late. The intense light struck the Purple Mansion Realm grand array beneath their feet, creating a world-shaking sound!

"BOOM!"

The mountains shook, the earth veins trembled, and the entire scene swayed. Screams were drowned out by the roar of the earth. Splashes of color flashed in the Great Void, only to see a white umbrella suddenly open at the zenith, bursting forth with countless streams of golden energy.

Then came a laugh.

"We have been waiting for you for quite some time!"
