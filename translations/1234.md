# Chapter 1234: Matters of Metal

The Supreme Yang Talisman shone resplendently, suspended high above the golden peak, its radiant yet gentle light cascading down to weave amongst the white clouds.

Tranquility reigned within the cave dwelling where purple light coalesced, and after an unknown amount of time, a faint sound finally emerged, as if someone were striding from an impossibly distant place across a boundless void, drawing gradually nearer before a man at last descended upon the wind.

This man was clad in golden robes, his sleeves embroidered with motifs of desert winds and flames, and a length of silk-like treasure was draped over his arm; with a placid expression, he landed within the cave dwelling and heard a voice.

"How is it?"

Amidst the hazy purple qi, a True Fire blazed fiercely where a middle-aged man sat cross-legged in the seat of honor, the space between his brows a swathe of crimson that made him resemble a god; the golden-robed youth lowered his eyes with a slight smile and said:

"It seems guests are about to arrive; I was specifically asked to step outside."

This was none other than Daoist Master Tianhuo, who had just emerged from the grotto-heaven!

Daoist Master Tianque was not surprised, his attention focused more on the youth as he raised an eyebrow and remarked:

"So, your 'Heavenly Gilded Helm' is finally perfected!"

Daoist Master Tianhuo's expression was placid.

"If it were not, I would have been too ashamed to return to the Esteemed Upper Azure Palace!"

Though his divine abilities had greatly advanced, a hint of melancholy lingered in his eyes. He shook his head and said:

"I am, after all, of the spirit-aperture-opening path; after the Purple Mansion Realm, progress is as difficult as ascending to the heavens. Even with the backing of a tremendous divine ability, this is where my journey ends. Attaining the Purple Mystery is now utterly beyond my reach, which is why I sought to try for the Wandering at Ease."

"The outcome was much as Martial Uncle predicted. I have become too deeply entangled in the mortal world and can no longer cultivate this path."

Tianque's own Dao was similarly without a bright future. Although the two of them were esteemed direct descendants of the Golden Oneness, they had to meekly accept it now that their paths had reached their ends. He sighed and replied:

"The Dao of 'Wandering Metal' is practiced within the mountain, but it is ultimately not yet mature. Let it be..."

Daoist Master Tianhuo shook his head, pushing the thoughts aside, and instead asked:

"Has there been any news from Sumian's side?"

The Great Daoist Master of True Fire rose to his feet and said:

"The fire has been extinguished. Duanyan feared he might fake his death to escape and even used a special treasure to verify it. Barring the intervention of a Golden Core cultivator, he has indeed perished. Now we just have to watch for the phenomenon in the Southern Sea."

He turned his head.

"What of Qi Qiuxin?"

Daoist Master Tianhuo slowly shook his head and said:

"It is the classic flaw of a rogue cultivator's heritage. They cannot find someone with a lofty disposition and Dao-intuition to elevate their aptitude; instead, they find someone with high innate talent and attempt to temper his mind to increase his Dao-Profundity. Although we have given him a helping hand, entering the Purple Mansion Realm will not be a problem. But when he leaves the grotto-heaven, whether he lives or dies will depend on his own fortune."

The emotion in his eyes was calm as he continued:

"We have long since given him what was promised. If he perishes one day, we will simply go and retrieve it."

Evidently, while the Golden Feather Sect had no intention of going back on their word, they did not think highly of this member of the Qi family, nor did they wish to involve themselves further. Tianque merely said:

"I suspect that with a moment of carelessness, he will first die at the hands of Situ Huo!"

"That would be even better."

Daoist Master Tianhuo replied casually, already hearing the resounding chimes of the profound bell outside the cave dwelling. He strode forward, and with a single step, he was outside the cavern of swirling purple qi. Zhang Duanyan was already waiting on the mountainside, listening as someone from the peak announced the visitor:

"The Li Clan of Moongaze, Daoist Master Suyun, has come to pay a visit!"

'Suyun... a fine Daoist name.'

Tianhuo concealed his thoughts, a brilliant smile appearing on his face as he stepped forward upon a cloud. As expected, a woman emerged from the mountain mist. She was dressed in simple white robes, with almond eyes, red lips, and a vermilion dot at the center of her brow, exuding an air of refined grace.

'Li Que'wan... it really is the Golden Book, the very one from Anhuai Heaven. The Li Clan had no Purple Mansion Realm cultivator back then... nine times out of ten, the Green-eyed Ghost gave it to her family. He burned so many cultivation arts, yet he was quite generous in giving them away himself.'

Tianhuo appraised her for a moment. The person before him had already offered a polite salutation, saying:

"Greetings to you, Daoist Masters. Congratulations, Senior Tianhuo, on the great advancement of your divine ability. Attaining the Purple Mystery is within your grasp!"

Clearly, not only did Li Que'wan recognize him, but she also knew the specifics of his divine ability cultivation. A reminiscent smile touched Tianhuo's lips as he replied:

"There is nothing to celebrate! This is the peak of my cultivation in this lifetime. You, on the other hand, have only just entered the Purple Mansion Realm, yet you've already beaten that medicine-birthed brat of the Qing Clan into a state of utter confusion. Now that is true prowess. The future truly belongs to your generation!"

Daoist Master Tianhuo had always possessed a sharp tongue. Even though they both belonged to the Western Shu alliance, he showed no courtesy when mentioning a certain person, calling him a medicine-birthed brat to his face. Li Que'wan naturally chuckled inwardly but did not reply to his barb.

The two parties appeared cordial as they proceeded together toward the cave dwelling higher up. They came to a place amidst a mountain forest and took their seats according to their status as host and guest. Zhang Duanyan began to pour tea, smiling as she said:

"We must apologize. Things are so busy at the lake, yet we had to trouble Daoist Master Suyun to make a special trip. I asked a few days ago whether we should go to the lake ourselves, but we feared it might seem too forceful and cause other families to misunderstand."

Given the difference in their status, it was impossible for the Golden Feather Sect to make a second trip. Politeness was one thing, but Li Que'wan was decisive. She took the small earthenware bowl from her sleeve, placed it gently on the table, and said with thanks:

"I must thank the Upper Sect for granting us these five years. Only then was my family's senior able to refine the elixir!"

Zhang Duanyan accepted the small item, her slender fingers touching the rim of the bowl for a brief inspection, while Daoist Master Tianhuo replied:

"You are too courteous, fellow Daoist. By my calculations, even if King Wei's injuries are not fully healed, they should at least be under control, simply requiring more time to slowly wear away. A senior of my clan once suffered this same calamity; it is indeed difficult to handle."

Li Que'wan's heart stirred.

'Now that I am here, whatever he does, he will likely first want to display his own capabilities and put on an air of predicting the unseen. Which is to say... it is highly probable that in the eyes of these esteemed figures, King Wei's progress is exactly as he described.'

She observed his expression, lowered her head slightly to feign hesitation, and said aloud:

"Things are not quite so optimistic..."

Daoist Master Tianhuo merely smiled and did not bring up the topic again. He took the small bowl from Zhang Duanyan's hand and said with a serious expression:

"Fellow Daoist Zhaojing is quite meticulous. This is an item from the Nine Mounds, is it not? It has been delivered untouched. However, I am still somewhat curious."

He smiled and said:

"I wonder what treasure your esteemed clan used to make that gaudy sparrow, Yuandao, loosen his beak."

After only three or four exchanges, Li Que'wan had come to appreciate just how venomous the man before her was. Qing Jifang was one thing, but Daoist Master Yuandao had been quite good to her clan. She could only pretend not to hear and said:

"That is a secret matter of the Nine Mounds."

Tianhuo gave a noncommittal smile.

"I won't make things difficult for you; I can guess well enough on my own. He snatched this item in his early years to prepare for a rainy day. Now he has given up on the True Fire path and feared we would ask him for it, so he simply tossed it away early."

'So it is because this fire resonates with a certain ancient position, making it beneficial for the Great Dao of True Fire!'

Li Que'wan became more certain, but since her own brother had already put up a bluff, she could not be the one to expose it. She adopted a look of sudden realization and said with a tremor in her voice:

"So that's how it is!"

Tianhuo and Zhang Duanyan exchanged a subtle glance. The young man said:

"Duanyan, go and bring the cultivation art."

Zhang Duanyan bowed and departed like a wisp of smoke. Tianhuo, meanwhile, wore a faint smile and said:

"That great battle in the Great Void, I heard it was quite spectacular. And the 'Vault Metal' Dao... was there such a thing?"

Li Que'wan nodded.

"He is a close friend of my clan's Daoist Master."

Tianhuo set down his jade cup, the smile on his face unwavering, but he seemed to weigh his words for a moment, as if considering how to begin. After a long while, he said:

"This person, does he count as a member of the Li Clan?"

Li Que'wan perceived the deeper meaning in his words and instantly grew vigilant. Her heart filled with doubt, and she had a premonition of misfortune. On the surface, however, she maintained a puzzled expression and replied:

"Senior Liu is a good friend of our clan's Daoist Master. He came from the Eastern Sea to set up a formation for us and lent his aid when he encountered the great battle. He has shown great kindness to both King Wei and my Li Clan."

Seeing that Tianhuo was beating around the bush without stating his intentions clearly, she did not press him, instead using her own elder's reputation to shield Liu Changdie. This earned her a rather surprised look from Tianhuo, who thought to himself:

'So she is not solely focused on seeking the Dao after all.'

The young man smiled, then very decisively gave up his probing. He clasped his hands behind his back and said distantly:

"All matters of Metal Virtue under heaven fall under two banners: one is the 'Golden Oneness of Highest Azure', and the second is the 'Contemplative Unfolding of Wandering Metal'. If 'Vault Metal' belongs to a rogue cultivator, then so be it, but if he joins a sect, that becomes a matter worthy of suspicion."

For the first time since Li Que'wan had arrived at the mountain, the smile vanished from the young man's face. Tianhuo's expression was grave as he said:

"Whether 'Vault Metal' can be unlocked, when it is unlocked, and even when someone verifies the Dao through it, are all major events concerning the fundamental laws of our two Daoist traditions, as well as critical matters involving multiple parties. It cannot be taken lightly."

"He was a rogue cultivator before, and no one paid him any mind; he was merely a pawn to be used in a larger scheme. 'Vault Metal' was the safest choice. But once he is under someone's banner, there is a risk of him disrupting the entire situation."

Li Que'wan understood his meaning and fell into a moment of contemplation. She simply went along with his words, saying softly:

"My clan's foundation is shallow. How could we have any intention of interfering in the matters of Metal?"

Tianhuo shook his head and said:

"With the 'Profound Vault Invitation Letter' in his hands, that foundation is no longer shallow. The Dragon-kin sent that item over with who knows what intentions; it cannot be ignored. This is not to pressure you, fellow Daoist, but a reminder. If my clan does not handle this, others will, and their methods will be far less civil."

The woman felt the heavy warning in his words and frowned.

"Then what is senior's intention?"

Tianhuo said in a low, distant voice:

"This matter is exceedingly simple, and I will not have King Wei's friendships damaged. I have here a 'Harmonising Metal' technique. I ask that you take it back with you. Whether he cultivates it or not is entirely up to your esteemed clan, and the consequences will be borne by that Daoist Liu himself."

'Harmonising Metal!'

Li Que'wan was well aware of the 'Harmonising and Vault Lock'! Liu Changdie was a Vault Metal cultivator; what end would he meet if he cultivated 'Harmonising Metal' as his second divine ability? With the two divine abilities locked together, it was likely that not even a True Monarch could help him cultivate another one!

'How utterly thorough!'

Seeing the look of horror in her eyes, the expression in the young man's own eyes grew unprecedentedly solemn as he said:

"Let me be clear with you. This cultivation art is not meant to harm him, but to prove his innocence. When someone comes to take his life later, do not blame it on my Golden Oneness!"

The emotion in Li Que'wan's eyes froze for a moment. After a long period of contemplation, the woman said:

"I fear he will not live long enough to cultivate several more divine abilities..."

Tianhuo smiled.

"If he cultivates one or two more, the ones coming to the lake might be Qing Yunyang and Wang Jinglue. Of course, Daoist Master Jinglue is probably too busy; the one to come would be Wang Xun."

A chill spread through Li Que'wan's heart.

She did not know who this Qing Yunyang was, but he was certainly an important figure in the Qing Clan. And Wang Jinglue was no stranger; she had heard his name before—he was Wang Xun's father!

'So the Qing Clan is also concerned... That is why the Dragon-kin's 'Profound Vault Invitation Letter' was delayed for so long and delivered just before the great battle. If it had been delivered earlier and the Qing Clan had found out, a truly terrifying figure would have descended upon the great desert back then! He would have certainly killed him and destroyed my clan's great formation as an afterthought...'

'I see now. The Dragon-kin wanted to make a move but did not wish to offend my clan, hence the roundabout approach!'

Hearing this, Li Que'wan already understood the deeper meaning behind the man's words. She finally rose and gave a deep bow.

"On behalf of Senior Liu, I thank the Golden Oneness."

Tianhuo chuckled lightly and said:

"Rest assured, as long as he cultivates that Harmonising Metal, I guarantee no one will ever be able to trouble him again. However..."

His tone shifted as he continued:

"If he is willing to accept this favor from me, I also have a matter to entrust to him."

Li Que'wan raised her eyebrows and saw him smile.

"The day my father verifies his Dao draws near. As his son, I have a filial duty to fulfill. I hope he can witness the phenomenon of the Harmonising and Vault Lock. I hope that he can spare a day when the time comes to meet with my father."

The young master said with a serious expression:

"There will only be benefits for him in this, no harm."

'So there was this consideration as well... the Golden Oneness is truly calculating!'

Li Que'wan sighed inwardly and replied:

"I will be sure to pass on the message."

She composed herself and looked up.

"However, there is one matter I do not understand, and I ask that senior enlighten me."

Tianhuo looked at her quietly for a moment, then said with a smile:

"Please speak."

Li Que'wan stared at him intently and said softly:

"It is often said that there are three Metals in the world. Since this is a matter of Metal Virtue, should there not be another house?"

Tianhuo had not expected her to ask this. He was momentarily stunned, then chose his words carefully.

"This is one of the hidden secrets, but it is no secret at all to the great figures. Since you have asked, fellow Daoist, I will mention it."

"The earliest Three Metals of the mainland were, in fact, three houses: my Evolving Splendor of Highest Azure, the Contemplative Unfolding of Wandering Metal, and the Heavenly Mandate Who Grasps the Vanguard... which is to say, the Sword Gate."

'Evolving Splendor of Highest Azure... Evolving Splendor.'

At the mention of the fallen True Monarch of the Sword Gate, Tianhuo's expression did not change in the slightest; he remained smiling as he said:

"Not long after the great figure of the Sword Gate fell, my own esteemed elder took a step further, changing his position to grasp Dui (Reflecting), yet he drew the great attention of the Geng position. With a supreme art, he forged his own path, changed the name of Dui (Reflecting), and acted in matters of Metal. Using his past self and his revolutionary self to reflect the Geng position, in truth, that path of Geng Metal still points to my esteemed elder!"

"This is the result of my elder verifying his Dao, and it is why my Dao has two Dao-paths. If you must have a name for them, the Three Metals are Contemplative Unfolding of Wandering Metal, Evolving Splendor of Highest Azure, and World-Rushing Golden Oneness!"

Even if Li Que'wan knew nothing about Metal Virtue, the words he spoke sent a cold sweat down her back, and her heart pounded in her chest.

'What kind of profound ability is this! What kind of power is this!'

One must know that from ancient times to the present, all who tried to claim a second Fruition Attainment had perished. Even the Great Sage, hailed as the First Demon Monarch of the world, had met his end on this path. Even if Taiyuan was merely reflecting and attracting the Geng position, to be able to make everyone in the world subconsciously refer to the Three Metals as complete was by no means a simple feat!

'Such a person... is he truly just a Golden Core cultivator... He cannot be far from the Dao Embryo, can he!'
