# Chapter 1183: Edict of Life

While Li Ximing was refining spiritual resources, he sat amidst the mountains, pen in hand, carefully weighing his words. After a moment's pause, a woman in a red dress approached respectfully and bowed.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

With the Chengming generation having withered away, Li Minggong was one of the family's last remaining elders. Her cultivation was at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm, making her the most dependable person for such a task. Li Ximing tucked away a golden scroll and placed it in her hands. He was about to instruct her to travel to the Golden Feather Sect when a thought gave him pause.

'This is hardly a simple errand. A Foundation Establishment cultivator traveling alone is like a beacon in the eyes of every Daoist Master, certain to attract unwanted gossip... Besides, if the Golden Feather Sect sends back any sensitive information and she happens to overhear it, who knows what dangers might arise.'

As he considered this, he looked up and saw the rising light of the Lesser Yang outside the mountain's protective array. A look of delight crossed his face as he opened the barrier to welcome his guest.

"Nanwu, you've arrived!"

The visitor was none other than Guo Nanwu, who had just returned from the Southern Sea and paid a visit to the Qusi.

This young Daoist Master had been a great help over the years. He was always courteous, and even as the Li family’s power and divine abilities grew, he had never adopted a fawning attitude. He was diligent in his duties and accepted the rewards he was due without fuss, which put Li Ximing greatly at ease.

Hearing Li Ximing’s greeting, he returned the salute and said simply,

"Congratulations!"

Li Ximing gave a modest nod, and Guo Nanwu continued in a low voice,

"I delivered the Profound-Name Dao-Malice Sword to my disciple-brother. He examined it carefully."

"He said the most valuable component is the Profound-Name Dao-Malice itself. Beyond that, the blade can yield a spiritual amalgam of Malice-Mound Copper and Simulated-Focus Mercury… If we let him handle the disassembly, the terms will be the same as always. Aside from those three components, the remaining materials will be his."

Li Ximing had no objection.

"That is as it should be."

"He also mentioned wanting to trade some of his own spiritual resources for that spiritual amalgam," Guo Nanwu added. "However, I recalled that Que'Wan has successfully formed her Whole Pill, for which the Simulated-Focus Mercury would be quite useful. I have not yet agreed, nor did I mention this to him. After all... now that your clan has a Whole Pill cultivator, you can separate the amalgam yourselves if you take it back."

The fact that Li Que'wan had achieved her breakthrough was a secret known only to Guo Nanwu, which lent their relationship a certain intimacy and made conversation easier. More importantly, it solved Li Ximing’s immediate dilemma.

'He's the perfect person to go in my family's stead!'

Guo Nanwu was practically one of his own. Traveling under the light of the Lesser Yang, he would be far less conspicuous than a Foundation Establishment cultivator running back and forth. And even if the Golden Feather Sect sent a reply, Li Ximing had seen for himself how discreet this Daoist Master was; he wouldn't breathe a word of what wasn't meant to be said.

Overjoyed, Li Ximing said,

"Thank you, Nanwu... you've come at the perfect time. I have a favor to ask of you!"

He took out the golden scroll, sealed it with a divine ability, and placed it in Guo Nanwu’s hands.

"Que'Wan has succeeded," he said in a low voice, "and while we can't have the news spreading and causing a nation-wide sensation, we must inform the Golden Feather Sect..."

Guo Nanwu accepted the scroll without a change in expression, tucking it into his robes with a slight nod and a smile. Li Ximing deliberated for a moment before casually retrieving the two malicious Spiritual Artifacts that had belonged to Helian Wujiang.

"King Wei is gravely injured," he sighed. "I've been on pins and needles with anxiety. Que'Wan and I have been scrambling to gather all manner of spiritual items. I've had these two things on hand, but no time to refine them. If I delay much longer, I fear there won't be time to reforge them..."

Guo Nanwu understood the unspoken request. He took the artifacts and said,

"I understand. Since King Wei is so seriously wounded, my Dao Lineage cannot simply stand by. I happen to have a year or two of free time, so I'll lend the family by the lake a hand."

Li Ximing hadn't expected it to be so easy. He shook his head, moved, but then he caught an underlying tone in Guo Nanwu's words.

"Nanwu, is something the matter?"

The young Daoist Master’s expression turned serious.

"It has been many years since this junior's breakthrough, and I have failed several times to manifest a second divine ability. By a fortunate turn of events, I received some spiritual resources from your esteemed clan, and over the years, I have been nourished by several of your pills. I am now showing signs of a breakthrough and plan to enter seclusion to pursue it!"

When they had first met, Guo Nanwu had only achieved his divine ability twenty or thirty years prior. Now, fifty years had passed. It was time. A hint of joy appeared on Li Ximing’s face.

"That's not slow at all!"

But his guest's words sparked another thought.

"Kuang Yu has also been in seclusion for some time now," he said hesitantly, "but we've heard no news from the Qusi..."

"Hah!" A smile broke through Guo Nanwu's usually stoic expression. "The Cultivation Transcendence divine ability is notoriously difficult to attain. It's only right that it takes a little more time. But by my count... it should be soon."

Li Ximing felt no awkwardness, simply nodding in acknowledgement.

"If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask."

The Daoist Master bowed, took the two Spiritual Artifacts, and departed. Li Ximing nodded to himself.

'Even if this is a favor owed to the Qusi, he has handled it exceptionally well. To be on the verge of a breakthrough and still have the composure to run menial tasks for my family... We may treat him well, but I should find a way to properly reward him when the opportunity arises.'

He settled back down, noting that his own spiritual resources were nearly refined. He finally got down to business, sealing the grand array and focusing his entire being on the cauldron. For eight months he worked, feeding the furnace with True Fire to supplement its inner marvels and adding thirty-nine varieties of minor catalysts. In one month, he tempered the Horn Wood and Valley Water; in another, he purified the Pristine Water. Soon, white smoke billowed forth. He knew the batch of pill essence was perfectly refined, and a swell of pride rose within him.

'Progress... definite progress! I estimated it would take a full year to liquefy the spiritual items and resources, but I finished in less than one!'

He reduced the heat, letting the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire roast the concoction gently. As he rose, he reached into his sleeve and produced a small, glazed vial.

It was the East Life-Mandate Vase.

The vase yielded its treasure only once a year. Accounting for the delays of travel, the completion of this 'Azure Proclaimation' blessing art was only a few dozen days away. Li Ximing had invested heavily in this batch of pills; he could afford to wait.

'I remember... 'Azure Proclaimation' is one of the Three Shamans and Two Rites... I should let Que'Wan take a look at this Spiritual Artifact.'

Li Ximing stared at the cauldron, his mind racing. As he waited, he conjured the Light of the Six Harmonies, intending to call for her. But just then, he heard the subtle sound of a gardenia blossom falling to the ground—his junior had already arrived, a pleasant smile on her face.

"Greetings, Grand-Uncle..." Li Que'wan curtsied and smiled. "This junior has been waiting for some time. As soon as I sensed the grand array's seals had loosened, I came at once to share the good news with you!"

Li Ximing had been working on this pill for nearly a year; the timing was critical. He looked up, his eyes filled with anticipation.

"The Spiritual Qi—is it ready?"

Li Que'wan produced a small cauldron from her sleeve and presented it to him.

"This junior was quite fortunate," she said with a smile. "The nurturing is complete!"

With a delicate flick of her finger, she drew something from the cauldron. It was a silvery-white substance that shimmered like liquid starlight, as heavy as mercury. It coalesced in her palm as frigid energy rolled off it in waves. Moonlight seemed to pour into it, and the rich fragrance of osmanthus blossoms erupted, threatening to blanket the entire mountain before she contained it in her palm with a divine ability.

It was the Profound Minister Moon Essence.

As this supreme-grade Spiritual Qi made its magnificent appearance, Li Ximing instantly sensed how extraordinary it was. Unlike the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance, which was noble, reserved, and silent as a shadow, this Profound Minister Moon Essence was brilliant, dense with spiritual power, and possessed an air of absolute flamboyance.

"Truly worthy of being a Spiritual Qi second only to the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance... Based on spiritual sense alone, it’s hard to tell which is the nobler of the two!"

Li Ximing took it, turning it over and over in his hands like a priceless treasure. Drawing on his many years of experience, he made his judgment.

"This substance... with just a few supplementary catalysts, it is ready to be made into a pill!"

The conclusion brought a shared sigh of relief, quickly replaced by unconcealed joy. Li Ximing admired it for a long moment before Li Que'wan spoke thoughtfully.

"This junior was still worried. By my judgment, this substance is still a hair's breadth shy of being a true spiritual resource."

Her expression grew more serious.

"My Dao is rooted in the transformation of material properties, where the classifications are absolute, unlike the Dao of Pills where deficiencies can be compensated for. Spiritual Qi is Spiritual Qi, and a spiritual resource is a spiritual resource. The densest Spiritual Qi approaches the quality of a spiritual resource, just as the densest spiritual resource approaches that of a spiritual item. These are the very boundaries that define the three."

"Therefore, while this can be used as a spiritual resource in a pinch, it cannot be subjected to the Art of Demoting Yin, because it is already at its limit. There is nothing left to demote."

Li Ximing nodded. Without his Heavenly Heart Oneness Pill Art, he too would find such fine distinctions difficult to work around. He sighed in mild disappointment, but Li Que'wan showed no sign of regret. Instead, she smiled and produced a small, cyan jade cauldron.

"But Grand-Uncle, you mustn't forget the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron."

"The Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron" Li Ximing’s mind lit up. "The Renew ability!"

This treasure cauldron possessed the power of Renew. It was this very ability that had allowed them to transform the Verdant Profound Sarcophagus into Profound Coffin Crimson Water. It was a unique effect; if one placed within it not a water-attribute spiritual item, but a spiritual resource that did not clash with 'Gathering Wood', it would be transformed into a corresponding spiritual essence.

"You mean... a Supreme Yin spiritual essence!"

Li Que'wan nodded with a gentle smile. She had clearly thought of this the moment she acquired the artifact.

"A spiritual essence," she said seriously, "has inherent properties but no life-mandate. It is the purest distillation of spiritual resources and objects. If we were to refine a large quantity of Profound Minister Moon Essence within it, I believe the result could rival a true Supreme Yin spiritual item!"

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing in an instant. His voice trembled as he replied,

"The Supreme Yin Moon Radiance, the Art of Demoting Yin, and the ancient artifact of Gathering Wood... not a single one can be missing. It's truly indispensable. If this works, then with enough time and manpower, my family will possess a Supreme Yin treasury—a production line that can elevate a substance from the level of Spiritual Qi all the way to a spiritual item!"

Li Que'wan had conceived of this plan long ago, but hearing him voice it still sent a thrill of excitement through her.

"As for time and manpower," she said with a small smile, "the process of converting Supreme Yin Moon Radiance into Profound Minister Moon Essence still requires my personal attention. However, the Renew ability of the Biting Qingyuan Profound Cauldron does not! That is one of the divine marvels of the Spiritual Artifact. As long as I oversee the process once or twice to perfect the formula, anyone can do it!"

"I wouldn't trust anyone else," Li Ximing said happily. "Leave it to me!"

Li Que'wan laughed.

"That might not be necessary!"

Li Ximing caught her hidden meaning and looked up sharply, only then noticing the change on her brow.

Between her fair eyebrows, she had always worn a single dot of Cinnabar. Now, flanking that crimson circle were two new, faint, petal-like crimson marks. They were subtle, almost imperceptible, but they could not escape the eyes of a Daoist Master.

'A Spiritual Treasure!'

As if on cue, Li Que'wan extended her hand. The white light in her palm faded, replaced by a crimson glow, and she revealed a silver Spiritual Treasure.

It was different now. It was encircled by a golden halo that gave it a new, solemn dignity. Sheets of glowing runes emerged from it, orbiting the treasure in silent flight.

"In my hands, this treasure has four divine abilities. One of them, the Blessing of Divinity, is effectively a Purple Mansion-level laborer that requires no cultivation!"

"Of course!" Li Ximing nodded again and again, the delight on his face growing more intense.

Li Que'wan, however, spoke with a tone of awe.

"Granduncle, I must tell you, the marvel of this Spiritual Treasure's Blessing of Divinity is simply staggering!"

She didn't pause, taking out a jade slip as she continued her explanation.

"The so-called Blessing of Divinity allows a mountain demon to receive a benediction, rectifying its wicked nature. It connects to the Profound Truth above and guides spiritual divinities below. It contains a spirit and receives the treasure, thereby guarding the gates of a sect. This divine marvel can enfeoff a demon beast, binding its very life-mandate to this Spiritual Treasure. By then swallowing a special pill, the demon can borrow a divine ability through the treasure's power!"

"But the fundamental principle of this art is substitution. This 'blessing' is incredibly domineering. The power doesn't come from some enfeoffed spiritual divinity. The true source is this: the Mystic Tablet Edict Pill!"

As a cultivator of the Whole Pill, she had already gained a thorough understanding of the treasure's mechanics, even if she did not know its origins. 

"The orthodox use of this Spiritual Treasure," she said gravely, "is to start with a Foundation Establishment-level demon beast. You first seize its life-mandate and contain it using the treasure's divine ability. Then, you force the demon to cultivate around the pill. The guest becomes the host; the demon uses its own life-mandate to nourish a nature-spirit, which is in turn tethered to the Spiritual Treasure and granted the status of the Purple Mansion Realm. By feeding it various resources, pills, and even spiritual items, it can perform feats akin to divine abilities without actually possessing any."

"So while the demon beast appears to have been blessed with a title, in truth, it has become nothing more than a vessel for the Mystic Tablet Edict Pill!"

This was clearly the first time she had encountered such a concept, and she was visibly shaken.

"This 'spiritual divinity' goes far beyond borrowing heavily from the external Profound Mystery. You can't even say it lacks control over its own life-mandate..."

The distinction was stark. An ordinary cultivator, master of their own life-mandate, was like a roadside vendor managing their own profits and losses. A Holder of the Profound was like a merchant forbidden from opening their own shop. The Merciful Ones and Mahas of the Buddhist Land were backed by a great market consortium, but were still a pawn who must surrender their earnings—at least they still possessed their own life-mandate. But this Blessing of Divinity was on another level entirely. Not only were your profits forfeit, but your entire inventory belonged to another. Your very life-mandate became a power source for the artifact, to the point that your original self must borrow its own power back!

'I thought the cultivation methods of our age were twisted enough,' Li Ximing thought, 'but these ancient cultivators were the true masters of the art!'

"That's not so bad..." he mused, nodding. "But... when Yang Ruizao told me about it, that wasn't the impression I got..."

Li Que'wan nodded eagerly, her tone shifting.

"The difference lies in the Yang family's techniques!"

"The Yang clan's art is called the Art of Assisting the Spirit and Guarding Orthodoxy. It was created by a great cultivator and tailored specifically for this treasure. It's an incredibly brilliant method designed for use on demon beasts that have already reached maturity."

"Once the pill enters the demon beast's body, they cultivate in tandem. The pill slowly devours the original host, using its divine abilities, dharma power, and even its life-mandate and soul as fuel to forge a new Dharma Body through the Spiritual Treasure's enfeoffment!"

Li Que'wan's eyes burned with intensity as she added with a note of regret, 

"Logically, no matter how powerful a single Spiritual Treasure is, it is still just one person and one artifact. It could never compete for a True Spirit against the Buddhist Land, which was forged by countless Buddhist and Daoist sages. The reason the Yang family was so confident is that the spiritual divinity created by this edict of life has no True Spirit to speak of. The original demon beast is, in fact, already dead. The enfeoffed Dharma Body simply houses its former memories, giving its actions a semblance of true spiritual life."
