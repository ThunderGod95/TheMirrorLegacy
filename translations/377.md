# Chapter 476: Meng Taizhi

Li Yuanjiao and Fei Luoya exchanged a few words, both clearly in high spirits as they left the Great Jueting with smiles on their faces. Zhu Xian and Li Wushao, their followers, trailed behind.

Li Yuanjiao noticed Fei Luoya surveying the surroundings with keen interest and asked, "What plans do you have for the stretch of lush forests and fertile lands between Great Jueting and Eastern Mount Yue?"

Fei Luoya's slit eyes met Li Yuanjiao's gaze sharply as he replied, "When Fu Daimu was still around, all I could think of was running away at a moment's notice... I've never thought of overseeing Mount Yue. However, now that I have such a huge territory, I'll have to appoint several of my men to help gather spirit items, hunt demons, cultivate Spirit Paddies, and earn a certain amount of Spirit Stones annually..."

Li Yuanjiao chuckled and suggested, "My family excels in these endeavors. Why don't we share the land? Since the territory is yours, my family will manage the operations for you. I'm confident that in ten years, we'll see profits exceeding twenty Spirit Stones annually."

"Oh?"

Fei Luoya nodded slightly then asked a few more questions before subtly shifting the topic toward the Azure Pond Sect's Fuchen Peak. Noticing Fei Luoya's disinterest in a partnership, Li Yuanjiao exchanged a few more pleasantries before taking his leave.

Li Wushao, who had been silent, spoke only after they had flown a hundred li.

"Master, how severe is your injury?"

When Li Yuanjiao endured a dual sword strike from Zhe Ledai, Li Wushao feared for his life. Since his spirit was bound to Li Yuanjiao, any harm that befell him would spell the end for Li Wushao too.

Li Yuanjiao waved dismissively as he replied, "I'm fine. Once we return to the peak, you should enter seclusion and take the Clear Cloud Elk Fruit to regrow the two hooks on your tail."

"Thank you, Master!"

Li Wushao expressed his gratitude repeatedly, to which Li Yuanjiao simply responded, "You're part of the Li Family now; there's no need for such formalities."

Just then, a handsome young man in white approached them. With a sword slung across his back, he cupped his fist and greeted Li Yuanjiao.

"Congratulations on your success in exterminating another evil, Second Uncle!"

This young man was none other than Li Xijun.

Li Yuanjiao, eyeing him suspiciously, asked, "Is something amiss at home? What brings you all the way out here?"

Li Xijun replied softly, "I feared that Fei Luoya might attempt deceit or worse, so I couldn't help but watch from afar."

Li Yuanjiao turned to him with a puzzled look and asked slowly, "We were more than a hundred li away from here within a grand formation... You can see all the way over there?"

Li Xijun nodded, the frost and snow qi in his eyes swirling densely. He replied, "Thanks to the Radiant Snow Pine Ridge I received, my vision is exceedingly sharp, capable of dispelling illusions and discerning details. Even through formidable formations, I can glimpse the flowing mana lights and thus gauge the situation."

Li Yuanjiao's face lit up with pride as he nodded in approval.

"Excellent! You must try cultivating the Spirit Eye Perception when we return. With such a talent, you might be able to master it easily and wield it effectively."

As Li Xijun nodded in agreement, Li Yuanjiao continued, "Fei Luoya refuses to let our family intervene even though his territory could yield significant profits with our manpower..."

Li Xijun paused thoughtfully before realizing something and said, "Uncle, do not worry! Fei Luoya does not grasp the complexities of governance... He is alone; how will he manage every aspect by himself? He may think appointing a few Qi Cultivators will suffice, but when reality hits, he'll soon realize that he needs our help."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, adding, "Exactly. The ways of Mount Yue are entrenched‚Äîgreed and fearlessness run deep. In Eastern Mount Yue, it took two Qi Cultivators and twelve Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators at Jade Capital from the Jade Court Guards enforcing strict discipline day and night to achieve what we have... Fei Luoya has no experience in these things and will definitely struggle."

The uncle and nephew conversed for a while before descending on Qingdu Peak. Upon landing, Li Xijun, with a solemn tone, said, "Clan Uncle! Our family has settled into Qingdu. Rogue cultivators now refer to us as the Li Family of Qingdu, thus solidifying our position. The old suffix Lijing no longer suits us... perhaps it's time for a change."

Whether Qingdu or Lijing, Li Yuanjiao was not concerned with titles and replied with a tone of indifference.

"As you wish, set it as you see fit."

As the group landed on the peak, a little girl squatting in front of the courtyard sprang up, smiling and running toward them.

"Father! Brother!"

"Xiang'er," Li Yuanjiao greeted. His daughter, whom he cherished deeply, had seen him rarely due to his years of seclusion and breakthroughs. This distance had caused some estrangement, and her bond with her cousin was evidently stronger, given how she grabbed Li Xijun's hand happily.

Observing them, Li Yuanjiao remarked with a chuckle, "Jun'er seems much more mature now."

With a warm smile, Li Xijun replied, "Uncle, Xiang'er will be tested for her spiritual orifice next year. I wonder if she will have one..."

Li Xijun wore a gentle and doting expression on his face. It was at this moment Li Yuanjiao realized that Li Xicheng and Li Ximing also had a gentle and subdued demeanor, which was strikingly different from his own fierce nature.

This generation is becoming more and more like those from the other prestigious clans out there... Li Yuanjiao mused silently with pride.

The Li Family's rapid ascent from humble beginnings to prominence meant they lacked the necessary wealth and connections. Due to various insecurities, the members of the first three generations were far from saints.

However, members of the generation of Xi and Yue, particularly Li Xicheng at the foot of the mountain, displayed a generosity and calmness typical of members from prestigious clans.

Li Xicheng, along with Li Xizhi and Li Ximing, were approachable and easy to converse with, but Li Yuanjiao was still uncertain as to whether this was their strength or weakness.

Yuan Chengdun and Xiao Ruyu also carry an air of submission, thanks to their substantial family backgrounds and influential connections... This made them adept at forming alliances and maintaining harmony.

These younger members had been fortunate to receive training in both cultivation and politics from an early age. It was only natural that they found the world to be sweet as honey, given that others deferred to them, showing respect to avoid conflict. They were also lucky to have the guidance of elders to keep them disciplined.

It's hard to determine whether being easygoing and generous or ruthless and cautious is better. Life is full of uncertainties, and it's challenging to make definitive judgments. As for Xijun...

Li Yuanjiao's thoughts trailed off as he turned his narrow gaze toward Li Xijun and suddenly called out to him.

"Jun'er."

Li Xijun lifted his head, his face noticeably more handsome than Li Yuanjiao. Frowning slightly in confusion, he tilted his head to express that he was waiting for him to continue.

Li Yuanjiao said softly, "It's often wise to keep a low profile. There's no need to be perfect. Make minor errors, suffer small setbacks..."

Li Xijun grew even more confused as he stared at his uncle, only to hear him say, "Even Ximing and Xicheng make mistakes, but I never worry because they always correct themselves. Yet you... I noticed that you have never faltered, and even hold a disdain for the world."

For the first time, Li Xijun felt the shock of being thoroughly understood. He could only stare back blankly, wordlessly.

Li Yuanjiao continued hoarsely, "My Big Brother was also a bright and gifted child since birth. He had only made one mistake in his life‚Äîpicking up that thunder pearl. Good fortune often punishes the bold... Never underestimate this world."

The tragic fate of Li Yuanxiu served as a life lesson for all of them. His error had since introduced numerous troublesome rules to the Li Family and had shaped Li Yuanjiao into the skeptical and anxious man he was today.

Li Xijun bowed deeply, acknowledging his uncle's advice.

"I shall heed your wisdom, Uncle."

After imparting his advice, Li Yuanjiao felt a sharp pain in his back and tightness in his chest, and was reminded of the wound Zhe Ledai had inflicted on him. He knew he needed to address it urgently.

"I've sustained a minor injury and must recuperate. The seclusion of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator is long, and so I might be unavailable for a few years. Manage the family well in my absence, your brothers will follow your lead. Always consult with your seventh uncle on any matter."

Li Xijun nodded thoughtfully and, as Li Yuanjiao left, he lifted Li Yuexiang from the ground, saying softly, "Come. Big Brother will take you on a walk."

On Mount Lijing...

Dressed in brocade fur, Li Yuanping sat at the end of the hall as usual. Despite his pale face and slightly sunken eyes, he looked in better health after consuming a talisman pill, which had aided in his breakthrough to the Jade Capital stage recently.

This is as far as I can go...

Though the talisman pill had facilitated his breakthrough, it was but a fleeting reprieve. His cultivation still hung in a precarious balance, and another attempt at advancement could hasten his demise.

Setting aside the letter he had been reading without any apparent change in his expression, he motioned for Li Xicheng at his side and whispered, "Is Meng Taizhi and his daughter around...?"

Li Xicheng cupped his fist and replied, "Meng Taizhi had ventured out to gather qi and has only just returned. I have already sent someone to summon them."

As soon as he finished speaking, an old Qi Cultivator at the ninth heavenly layer, with a dignified demeanor, entered the hall. He came up, cupping his fist as he greeted, "Rogue cultivator Meng Taizhi greets Family Head."

Li Yuanping acknowledged him with a wave of his hand and then got straight to the point. "No need for such formality, Elder Meng. I heard that you can craft Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts... Is that true?"

Meng Taizhi nodded and replied confidently, "I have some expertise in crafting artifacts and am quite skilled with Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts. If you wish, I can craft such artifacts for your family to offset the cost of gathering Qi."

Li Yuanping smiled and inquired further, "Refining artifacts is no small feat, Elder Meng. How much time can you dedicate to this task?"

Meng Taizhi responded with a bow, "Should your clan provide the materials, producing one artifact every two months is feasible."

Li Yuanping nodded thoughtfully and remarked, "That's sixty artifacts over ten years... That's quite an impressive number."

The Li Family typically acquired dharma artifacts by looting or purchasing them at a high price. These artifacts were crucial for distributing power within the peak's hierarchy and rewarding the younger members. If they could secure this batch of artifacts, it would greatly ease their future endeavors.

Our family possesses Ebony Ores, which are ideal materials for crafting Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts... With these, setting up new offices on future peaks will be more convenient!

Yet, he harbored suspicions about Meng Taizhi's seemingly generous offer and wondered about his ulterior motives. Clutching Xiao Yuansi's letter, he speculated, Meng Taizhi and his daughter could gather qi themselves... Their willingness to assist us might be concealing deeper intentions.

Li Yuanping was reluctant to owe anyone a favor. Glancing at Li Xicheng beside him, he offered a diplomatic smile and said, "It would be improper to trouble you, Senior, especially after your long journey. Fortunately, my family still has some reserves. Perhaps we could commission your services for now and offer some compensation, Elder Meng."

Meng Taizhi cupped his fist and replied, "You're too kind, Family Head. Assisting with such a modest task is hardly a problem. However..."

Having already anticipated the "however" from Meng Taizhi, Li Yuanping waited for him to continue.

"My daughter possesses the talent to conjure core flame necessary for refining pills, but alas, as a lowly blacksmith, I lack the skills to guide her further..."

He bowed deeply and added, "At the age of one hundred and eighty, my years are numbered. My greatest concern is my daughter's future, particularly in securing an alchemy legacy to establish herself... Should we acquire your family's alchemy legacy, we promise to maintain secrecy!"

"Refining a dharma artifact for your family is merely one way to express our gratitude. I'll be happy to help in any way I can, as long as it is within my capabilities!"

So this is his intention!

Feeling a sense of clarity, Li Yuanping placed the letter he had been holding on the desk and spoke calmly, "Elder Meng, there is nothing else my family needs right now. I understand your urgency to secure the alchemy legacy, however, I must consult with the ancestor of my family first."

"Yes, Family Head!" Meng Taizhi said right away, thanking him several times. Li Yuanping inquired about a few more details, discussed unrelated matters briefly, then dismissed him.

Li Xicheng, who had been observing quietly, stepped forward and suggested, "Family Head, given that Elder Meng and his daughter possess unique talents and skills, why not consider recruiting them into our family? Once Meng Zhuoyun attains the status of an alchemist, Brother Ming's burdens will be significantly alleviated..."

"Hmm," Li Yuanping murmured thoughtfully. He gathered the small letters scattered on the desk, sliding them to the corner, and then said, "Take a look at these."

Li Xicheng approached the desk and began to read through the small pile of letters.

"I have reached the Crimson Reef Island Market of the Eastern Sea... there is no alchemist surnamed Meng here... nor have anyone heard of any by that surname leaving the area..."

"I am now at Chunyi Island of the Eastern Sea..."

"I am now at Bamboo Creek Island of the Eastern Sea..."

After Li Xicheng finished reading all the letters, Li Yuanping explained, "I've already sent people to each of the islands to trace the origins of Meng Zhuoyun and other spirit items, but there's no record of any cultivator surnamed Meng skilled in crafting artifacts, nor any recent departures of such cultivator from the Eastern Sea."

"Even the locations Meng Taizhi mentioned led nowhere," Li Yuanping added, tapping the desk.

"His background remains a mystery, making it difficult to trace his origins. Without definitive information about his past, can we just simply recruit him into our family?" he asked, prompting his junior to think.

Seeing the contemplative look on Li Xicheng's face, Li Yuanping continued, "There's no rush. We have a decade to investigate this matter thoroughly. Just stay vigilant and patient, and we'll eventually uncover the truth."

"I've arranged for a team to assist you once you assume leadership of our house. They will methodically follow up on these leads," he said.

Li Xicheng nodded, feeling the weight of his responsibilities. Having observed Li Yuanping navigate similar challenges over the years, he now understood the difficulties his cousin, Li Ximing, had faced.

Although he had only taken over the restructured Li Family, he could already imagine how much harder it must have been for Li Ximing to handle everything in the past.

Just then, a clan soldier approached to report that An Zheyan and his two sons had returned from their survey of the ore vein on the southern shore.

"Excellent! Bring them in immediately," Li Yuanping responded, his spirits lifted as he coughed lightly.

Soon, three men entered the hall together, led by a Qi Cultivator with a shiny shaved head, who was at the ninth heavenly layer.

He cupped his fist and greeted, "An Zheyan greets Family Head!"

Li Yuanping nodded.

Despite looking like a strong bear, An Zheyan's tone was deferential as he continued reporting, "I have completed my investigation on the fourteen anomalies along the southern shore, two were ore veins and seven water veins of high value. Congratulations are in order, Family Head!"

"Two ore veins?!" Li Yuanping exclaimed, rising quickly to his feet.

"What type of ore veins are they?"
