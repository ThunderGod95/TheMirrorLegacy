# Chapter 1119 The Pear Garden

'Western Sea...'

Li Suining was no stranger to this name; he even felt a sense of dissociation.

In his second life, Li Zhouwei had also come to ask him. But at that time, Li Suining hadn't been unconscious for a year. He had already met with Li Xuanxuan and dealt with the affairs of the West Bank. When King Wei came asking, Li Suining had been truly embarrassed.

Because in his first life, Li Zhouwei and Li Ximing had never gone to the Western Sea at all. If anything, it was only Li Ximing who had suffered a major setback there in the early days and, by a twist of fate, failed to make the trip. Li Zhouwei had not slain Vast Cicada and was, at that time, still recovering from his injuries.

The situation now, however, was completely different.

He had considered it carefully at the time and ultimately gave his approval.

'Western Shu and Xiangxiong Kingdom are locked in a fierce battle. The Western Sea, Poluoduo, even the Land of Long and Moxi are all stirring. There is turmoil everywhere, but also opportunities to profit from the chaos.'

Thus, to acquire the Wall-Sinking Water, Li Ximing and his companion had gone to the Western Sea. Although the Li Suining of that time did not yet possess a Cave-Heaven and only held Li Zhouwei's trust, he knew none of the details. However, he had never heard of Li Zhouwei or the others suffering any injuries.

'With the current combined strength of Daoist Master Zhaojing and King Wei, it's not enough to run rampant on the mainland, which is teeming with prodigies. But in that remote place, there truly aren't many who could afford to provoke them!'

After all, the Western Sea was not large, and navigating the winds there was difficult. It was never a place suited for the younger generation to cultivate, only marginally better than the outer seas. What kinds of people holed up in the Western Sea? Either they were of the Yangya ilk—figures with no heart for seeking the Dao and no inclination toward a sect, who only dreamed of closing their doors to become local tyrants—or they were of the Qingyan ilk—cultivators who had offended powerful figures, practiced forbidden arts, and dared not show their faces outside.

As for the lower-level cultivators, they were few and far between, mostly demonic cultivators.

In other words, Li Suining could tell Li Zhouwei with full confidence this time, that the outcome of the Western Sea trip would be good!

Not only that, but many years later, Li Suining had seen Li Que'wan in the mystic realm, using Profound Coffin Crimson Water to practice her spell arts and suppress her injuries. He once heard her lament,

'This water was refined by the Daoist Master in the Western Sea. It's just a pity I was still in seclusion and couldn't assist. We were short one part of Treasured Earth to harmonize the water and wood. If we'd had that one part of Treasured Earth, I could have corrected this... But it's a pity... the foundation is ruined.'

Li Suining asked at the time,

'Refined in the Western Sea... was it using the Piting Qingyuan Treasure Cauldron in Aunt's hand?'

Li Que'wan nodded.

'That Rogue Cultivator Yinqin is despicable. He took a spiritual ingredient back, promising the Shore-Manifesting White Flower, but to this day, he's only sent back a single flower. He claims the spiritual aura has changed and he needs to settle accounts... If he can't be clear about it, we might as well just chop down that spiritual root!'

Li Suining had some understanding of this latter matter. It was an old agreement with a Western Sea cultivator. But later, the spiritual aura in the Western Sea supposedly changed. The man began making excuses and stopped sending the deliveries to the lake. It was impossible to know if he was telling the truth. By that time, the conflict between the North and South had grown taut as a bowstring, and no one had the spare energy to deal with a cultivator from the Western Sea.

'Perhaps that rogue cultivator saw that the family lacked the power to go to the Western Sea and demand it... That's why he was hemming and hawing, making excuses, and not sending anyone.'

He carefully sorted through his thoughts and replied,

"This venture is highly auspicious. It is only lacking earth. Judging from the divine mystery, it must involve the refining of a spiritual item. It would be best to add one part of Treasured Earth to the process."

Li Zhouwei's expression grew thoughtful as he heard the precision of the reply. 

"One part of Treasured Earth..."

Li Suining instantly caught his meaning. He immediately regretted not having asked Li Que'wan exactly how much "one part of Treasured Earth" was.

'It seems I'll have to ask about every detail from now on... so I won't be put in such an awkward position again...'

Li Zhouwei, however, quickly grasped the point.

"I understand. So there's such a calculation involved, it's not just a matter of throwing in spiritual items. How about this... If any refining needs to be done, we'll postpone it if we can, preferably until Que'Wan comes out of seclusion. If it truly cannot be delayed, I will carefully consider adding some Treasured Earth."

Li Suining's eyes lit up. While moving aside the clan scrolls on his desk, he picked up the teapot to serve him.

"That is the first matter. The second should involve the division of a spiritual root. There is a risk of complications from a change in the spiritual aura. I hope the Daoist Master can settle things in one go. At worst, it might be a bit wasteful... but just cut it down for the materials."

"Good."

The light in Li Zhouwei's eyes grew sharper. He accepted the tea, nodded slightly, and after a long moment, spoke.

"The Heavenly Element's ability is truly remarkable. No wonder Senior Changdie was able to thrive as a mere rogue cultivator all those years ago..."

"I cannot compare to Senior..."

Li Suining could only lower his head, his heart a knot of complexity. But he saw Li Zhouwei staring at him, his golden eyes glittering.

"You are injured?"

How sharp were Li Zhouwei's eyes! With a single glance, he had seen that Li Suining's foundation was damaged and his lifespan was diminished. This was no trivial matter!

For those in the Purple Mansion Realm, this was a matter of one's life-mandate. For cultivators below that realm, the term 'foundation' was more familiar. Such an injury usually occurred when escaping a battle of life and death, or after suffering some other catastrophic blow. Once it appeared, it was not only difficult to mend but would very likely impact all future cultivation and breakthroughs!

The injury Li Xuanxuan had suffered at the market back then had damaged his lifespan, causing endless harm. But the sight on Li Suining now was even stranger. To Li Zhouwei, it looked more like he had lost a significant amount of life-span, but the greater price his body should have paid seemed to have been covered by the favor of the Heavenly Element within him.

The loss of life-span was severe and irreversible. For practitioners of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao, there was basically no cure—unless one surrendered their True Spirit to the Buddhist Land, became a vassal, and converted to another path. Only a few, rare divine abilities could increase it, and even those were exceedingly scarce.

'Although it's serious, at least it won't greatly impact his cultivation... I wonder if Senior Changdie had such an injury. But seeing as he was able to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm... if he did, it must have been this type, with minimal impact...'

A hundred thoughts spun through Li Zhouwei's mind in that short moment. Li Suining, hearing the question, was stunned at first. He then recalled the blood he had spat upon waking and quickly shook his head with a forced smile.

"It's not really an injury! Just a small mishap during cultivation..."

What kind of "mishap" could damage one's life-mandate and shorten one's lifespan?

Li Zhouwei frowned. He quickly connected this to Li Suining's year-long seclusion and the natural way he had just mentioned Liu Changdie. An answer formed in his mind.

'When I asked him about the Heavenly Element back then, he was completely oblivious. Now, he acts like an expert...'

But Li Zhouwei did not expose him. Instead, he said in a low voice,

"Do not be impatient for quick results. This... must be taken slowly."

Li Suining's heart trembled. Staring into those golden eyes, he was at a loss for how to reply. Li Zhouwei's tone carried an inexplicable undercurrent as he smiled.

"The 'Heaven–Governing' path is Heaven's calculation. You and I, we are Man's calculation. We will have to test it to see which is superior."

...

The night was deep, but the courtyard was utterly silent. A mournful aria rose and fell, its lingering notes coiling around the beams, seeming to never end.

"A family's blood, a year of hate—I knock on every ancestral gate, why is there no reply? Can it be the stars and moon were all in vain... The loyal die, the treacherous remain. I trace the karmic chain... and find only dark water swallowing the prison door!"

In the Pear Garden, the audience stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence. Outside the courtyard, however, flames flickered. Medicine boiled over a roaring stove. Beside it, an old man, though his hair and beard were silver, remained robust. He gently waved a fan, waiting. When the time was right, he added medicinal pills. He poured the concoction out in three batches, let it cool, and carried the tray upstairs.

"Hilarious! Hilarious! Before the ancestral stones, before the ancestral stones... a land up in smoke! I've roamed every mountain and ridge, only to earn sleepless night after sleepless night..."

The dharma lamp in the attic was even dimmer. There were few spectators; only a single table was placed by the railing, a man slumped over it. Beside the railing stood a young master. Several opera robes hung on the wall, their dark red cuffs fluttering in the breeze. The old man carried the tray and said,

"Old Ancestor..."

Only then did the man at the table shift his gaze from the stage below. His hair and beard were stark white, almost withered.

"Shuya... just set it down."

"Yes."

Li Xuanxuan's turbid old eyes glanced at him.

"Let the servants handle these things. You're getting old. Don't trouble yourself."

Li Shuya was Li Que'wan's elder brother. He had been sent to serve Li Xuanxuan decades ago due to some past turmoil. In the blink of an eye, the young man had become an old one, yet he remained as meticulous as ever.

Li Shuya was a direct witness to the old man's declining health. He glanced at the cup and stood waiting silently to the side.

Li Xuanxuan had no choice but to lift the cup. He drank it down hastily, set his manuscript aside, and said,

"No matter how good these pills are, they have their limits. They aren't doing much good anymore. Report to Jiangzong. Tell him not to send any more."

"Yes."

Li Shuya silently carried the cup out. A moment later, rising above the faint, lingering opera song, came the stubborn sound of medicine being boiled outside, the clink of the porcelain stove. Li Xuanxuan could only sigh, his gaze falling quietly on the opera costume hanging in the room.

This robe was entirely crimson, embroidered with flowing gold thread, and paired with a colorful crown. In the Pear Garden, an actor wearing this costume usually represented the ruler of the Li family. Sometimes, they would also carry a bow and sword, as seen in the recent tragedy of the Jiang and Yu families, _The Recent Usurpation_, or the story of the Li family's rise, _Expelling the Vicious_.

'After all, in recent years, Jiangzong, Jiangqian, and Jianglong have all used a unified Family Head system. It's not surprising this custom exists...'

Ever since that year's Lament for the Fleeting River, Li Xuanxuan had made a point to attend every new play that appeared among the common folk. This current play, The Recent Usurpation, was a tragedy. For its costume to also be hanging on the wall meant something more—this play had been personally composed by a direct descendant of the Li family.

It was none other than the profligate young master standing by the railing with his hands clasped behind him, the one who had yet to utter a single word.

Li Zhouming.

Li Xuanxuan always made time to see the juniors. It was no secret his health was failing. Many felt pity, some were even overcome with grief, but only this profligate young master visited one day, accompanied him the next, traveled with him, ate with him—behaving as if he would never leave his side.

He held an extremely simple bamboo tube. Inside were finger-width tokens of various sizes, inscribed with the names of different plays, one after another. They looked especially rustic in the faint light.

As the music swelled, Li Zhouming turned his head. He was startled to find that, in the shadows, a Daoist Master had appeared beside him, the Heavenly Light between his brows shining brilliantly.

Li Ximing, however, simply waved his hand, his gaze fixed on the actor on the stage below.

"Look! Look! His sad tears cross the foul river, he kills wantonly, yet dares to speak of brotherly blood! He lingers here, he lingers there... It turns out he killed his brother—to teach his younger brother treachery!"

Making a show of weeping, the actor playing the young master of the Jiang family—with two short, flimsy flags on his back to signify his low cultivation—was quickly carried off the stage. This marked the end of the first act.

The music slowly faded. The old man had already risen from his seat.

"Daoist Master, you've come."

Li Xuanxuan always called him Daoist Master. It wasn't a sign of distance; it was a sign of pride. Li Ximing had grown used to it over the years. He smiled. 

"Seeing Grandfather enjoying such refined leisure, Grandson feels more at ease."

Li Xuanxuan just shook his head and sighed.

"The situation is urgent. You mustn't worry about me. I've lived this long; how could I not know how to take care of myself?"

The old man's gaze was laced with concern.

"But for the Daoist Master to come seeking me so late at night... I wonder what the matter is."

Li Ximing smiled, his eyes sweeping over the crimson robe on the wall. 

"Grandfather misunderstands. Grandson is going on a trip to the Eastern Sea. It is nothing urgent. I simply received a letter from Senior Liu and wanted to bring Grandfather along to meet him. You can also see the An family and the Li family members on the island... They miss you dearly."

The old man hesitated.

"This..."

Just then, Li Zhouming strode over and affectionately took the old man's hand. 

"Old Master, weren't you just mentioning Senior Liu the other day? He has already achieved the Purple Mansion Realm, but he cannot come to the lake. He must miss you terribly."

Li Xuanxuan sighed and smiled.

"I'm just afraid of making a fuss and troubling the Daoist Master."

Li Ximing shook his head and waved his hand slightly. A streak of green light leaped from his sleeve, landing and transforming into a page-boy with clear, bright features. He warmly helped the old man up. "Old Master, do you remember me?"

Most old men have a fondness for such child-like figures. Li Xuanxuan only needed two glances before he broke into a laugh.

"The Shi'er tree has attained the Dao, and to think it's so mischievous!"

Li Ximing couldn't help but smile. With a flick of his sleeve, a thick darkness enveloped them. In an instant, they flew into the Great Void, speeding away. Once the old man was settled, he let out a long sigh.

"Changdie is a capable man."

Li Ximing smiled but said nothing. His expression was somewhat peculiar.

"Master has taken an interest in short plays recently... I heard Zhouwei mention it once... something called Lament for the Fleeting River..."

The old man's smile faded slightly, as if he were preoccupied. Li Ximing continued naturally,

"I went to listen to it once in private. The actors at the Pear Garden are quite good. In the audience, some were sighing, some were sympathetic, some were angry. But in this Grandson's opinion... the tune is a bit too tragic."

Li Xuanxuan was silent, staring intently at this grandson who had long since shed his mortal flesh and become a Daoist Master. He listened as Li Ximing continued softly,

"Ming'er may seem idle, and his mind isn't on proper business, but he is actually very sharp. Even if Grandfather says nothing, he can guess much of it. What's more... I heard he was the one who originally arranged the music for that Lament for the Fleeting River. Now that the words and music no longer match, how could he not know?"

Li Xuanxuan remained silent, listening as Li Ximing said,

"And... this play. Grandson believes it should not be allowed to spread too far. Que'Wan is one thing, but Jiangqian is a deeply suspicious man. I fear this will stir up trouble."

The old man said, "I understand."

Silence reigned in the Great Void, filled only with an empty echo. After an unknown amount of time, the Daoist Master slowly averted his gaze. He closed his eyes tightly, his lips moving, but no sound emerged:

'A single point of transcendence is the truest.'
