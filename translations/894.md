# Chapter 894: Signs of a Southern Push

'The Golden Tang Gate has been in decline for years. After the Azure Pond faded, they survived by relying on the Golden Feather Sect's mediation. But after they acquired that Situ family's spirit rope... the Golden Feather Sect stopped managing their affairs. Primordial Magnetism is determentail to Whole Pill, and it's common knowledge that Qiushui is trying to break through to Fruition Attainment. Tianhuo's rage is understandable.

'Perhaps wiping out the Golden Tang Gate was something the Golden Feather Sect tacitly allowed, or was even powerless to prevent. But for the Tangdao Mountain Range to transform into a treasure land of Primordial Magnetism... that was likely beyond their calculations.

'The northern powers are a tangled mess. Is this a warning strike from Mount Luoxia, or just the petty meddling of the Emptiness Dharma Master and the Great Desire Dharma Master? Or perhaps... both?'

Li Ximing stared quietly at the jade cup. He'd had his doubts, but from Tianhuo's perspective, the Golden Feather Sect had been utterly humiliated. The lesser cultivators might not grasp the full picture, but which of the assembled Purple Mansion Realm masters lacked insight? Even if they didn't perceive the subtle shift in the gilded qi, they all saw the effect that the surging Primordial Magnetism had on the world's spiritual aura.

'It's like an Immortal sent a servant down the mountain, and the servant immediately stepped on a tiger's tail. But seeing the servant was acting on orders, the tiger couldn't pounce. Instead, it's left to wonder if the Immortal is trying to prevent its own cub from growing up.'

Li Ximing sighed. The Golden Feather Sect, despite its Golden Core backing, was forced into silence. Firstly, the current situation was restrictive; True Monarch Taiyuan was likely still beyond the heavens. Secondly... while the Golden Feather Sect had many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, unless they had Daoist Master Qiushui herself make a move, they probably couldn't force the Emptiness, Great Desire, and Helian factions to retreat.

But with True Monarch Taiyuan absent, would the Golden Feather Sect really allow Qiushui to intervene? And if she did, how would they manage the fallout?

Tianhuo departed, seething with rage, but Li Ximing's expression only grew darker.

'They're building a temple on Tangdao Mountain. The Golden Feather Sect's message is clear: they're washing their hands of it.'

The implications of that were profound.

The Way of Emptiness hadn't just destroyed the gate and left; they were building a temple on Tangdao Mountain. With the Golden Feather Sect refusing to intervene, this incident had escalated far beyond simple plunder. Would the Buddhist cultivators really stop there? The balance between north and south was already fragile. What if they continued their push southward? The fall of the Golden Tang Gate meant the western gateway of the Xu State was compromised. Beyond those mountains lay the Brahma Cloud region, and just past that... they would be right at the doorstep of his Moongaze Lake.

The Golden Tang Gate was hardly a righteous sect, but there was a reason it had managed to cling to life for so long. Its sudden annihilation was an embarrassment for the Golden Feather Sect, but for his Li family, it felt like a dagger pressed to their backs.

'No wonder Tianhuo came to me...'

Li Ximing had long known the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's position was precarious. But his family was on the riverbank; what other path could they take? He sighed, using his own divine ability and dharma power to disperse the lingering traces of power on the cup. Just then, he heard Ding Weizeng report that Jiangxia and Li Que'wan were requesting an audience.

Li Ximing waved them up, his mind still elsewhere.

Li Que'wan entered first, followed by Jiangxia, who strode forward with the confidence of a predator. They bowed. Li Ximing got straight to the point.
"What is the situation in Jiangbei?"

The woman spoke, her expression fraught with worry.

"The Buddhist cultivators wouldn't touch Chengyun Gate, so they crossed the mountains through the former Golden Tang Gate lands. They've seized the entire territory and established the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple. Now, they've crossed the creek and entered the Brahma Cloud Territory. All the local powers, great and small, are terrified. It looks like they're ready to surrender at the first sign of trouble."

"In the east, Su Yan has joined the Golden Feather Sect. The demonic cultivators infesting the Capital immortals Dao's territory have fled, but the Daoist tradition itself was still grievously wounded. We hear that Merciful Ones are still active in the territory, acting with utter arrogance, but there's been no sign of Daoist Master Yehui."

'They really crossed the mountains!'

A headache bloomed behind Li Ximing's eyes. "That damned Yehui," he muttered. "Still hiding, even now. Past Midong is his own territory. Is he just going to abandon his Daoist tradition?"

Cursing was one thing, but ruthlessness had its merits—a path Li Ximing himself couldn't walk. South of the Brahma Cloud Territory lay Funan and Midong, regions the Li family had long monitored. The two juniors had clearly come to ask about them. Jiangxia stepped forward, his voice ringing with conviction.
"Daoist Master! Give the order, and we will lead a contingent. With all our Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators advancing as one, we can take Funan and Midong in less than an hour!"

Funan was just across the river, on the north bank. The Li family had always treated it as their buffer against the north; it couldn't be abandoned. But the situation was growing more critical by the moment. Li Ximing stood and flicked his sleeves.

A colorful light flashed, and four dharma artifacts materialized on the desk.

All four dharma artifacts emanated an ancient aura: a saber, a spear, a feathered fan, and a precious pearl. Their designs were simple but refined, each one a high-quality piece. The best among them was the Azure-Pure Pearl. It pulsed with the Dao of Purple Qi, shining like a bright star. Its quality surpassed Li Minggong's Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier and nearly rivaled Li Zhouwei's Grand Ascension. It was impressive enough to make Li Ximing pause and admire it.

"This Azure-Pure Pearl is without a doubt an ancient dharma artifact," he said, impressed. "Unfortunately, no one in the family has made significant progress in the Purple Qi Dao. I'll hold onto it for now."

His own cultivation technique, after all, relied on Purple Smoke. Taking this pearl was the right move. The other items—the Circlet Spike, the Cloud-Parting Fan, and the Bright-Flame Saber—were all of a quality comparable to the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier. They would be excellent additions for the Li family members.

Li Ximing's expression turned serious. "These are not normal times. We're facing the Buddhist cultivators from the north. Distribute these items, then go to the north bank and await my command."

"Yes, Daoist Master."

They replied in unison, bowing before they departed. Li Ximing had no time for further arrangements. He transformed into a streak of bright light and vanished.

Outside Moongaze Lake, the distant Great Void shimmered. The power of Primordial Magnetism from the north was still in flux, silently warping the Great Void. Clearly, the fallout from the Tangdao Mountain Range incident was worsening. Following a spiritual guide, he soon found Ning Wan within the Great Void.

The Lady of Qiuhu greeted him, her voice gentle.

"Greetings, Zhaojing. Your timing is perfect. I was just about to find you."

Li Ximing's expression was grim. He cut straight to the chase.

"The Buddhist cultivators are showing signs of pushing further south. Qiuhu, what are your plans?"

The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's territory was concentrated along the coast. The eastern half of Jiangbei was shielded by Chengyun Gate, Capital immortals Dao, and Xuanmiao Temple. But the Golden Tang Gate, the western gateway, was gone. The only thing south of it was his Moongaze Lake. Ning Wan naturally understood the stakes. She couldn't afford to alienate him now. Hearing his direct question, she replied in a low, serious tone, "Rest easy, Zhaojing. I've already sent word to Xiukui and the Sword Gate. If the Golden Feather Sect won't act, *we* cannot sit idly by."

She was clearly focused on this matter. "Are you aware," she continued, "that a certain Helian Wumeng from the Helian family has also arrived from the north? He's involved with the Way of Emptiness, and he is unquestionably a demonic cultivator. For them to arrive with such momentum... this is no simple matter."

Li Ximing wasn't sure if the Golden Feather Sect had already contacted her, but he felt a small sense of relief. "Whether we fight or negotiate," he replied, "we must draw a line with the Buddhist cultivators. We will need the help of all our allies. I will make a trip to the Capital immortals Dao. If the seniors arrive, tell them to find me there."

Li Ximing wasn't acting out of kindness. Even if Yehui didn't return, the Capital immortals Dao was trapped, just like the Li family. Everyone in the Capital immortals Dao would be a potential ally, united by a common enemy. If a war truly broke out, a flood of Master Monks pouring south could shield one flank and absorb pressure. At worst, he couldn't let the Buddhists destroy them for free. If the Capital immortals Dao fell, the Wilderness would be next.

'Guan Gongxiao and his people can still fight. I must prepare for the worst.'

As for the Brahma Cloud region, it was impossible to know how dangerous it was now. Li Ximing was certainly not willing to go alone. If he projected his senses into the Great Void, he had no idea how many Mahas or Merciful Ones he might find. He would only expose his own abnormalities. It was better to do the opposite and head to the Capital immortals Dao.

Ning Wan understood his thinking. Even if Li Ximing didn't go, she would have to rally them anyway. She nodded. "Agreed. Even if Yehui doesn't return, we can't let the cultivators of our Immortal Dao die for nothing. Daoist Kui Qi and I will join you there."

Her expression turned slightly helpless. "As for Xuanmiao Temple," she said, changing the subject, "I saw Senior Sumian. He revealed himself and took Fei Qingfei away. I thought it would be Chengyan, but it was him. Old Qi used a divine ability to mask it, and while clever, it couldn't fool my Serene Listen."

Ning Wan had cultivated a Life Divine Ability, and her own Daoist tradition and Spiritual Artifacts were exceptional. Although Sumian had inherited a portion of the Comprehending Profoundity Daoist tradition, he was ultimately no match for Ning Wan and had silently revealed his presence.

Perhaps Xuanyi had mentioned something, or perhaps the Li family's relationship with her was simply much better than Xuanmiao Temple's. Now that they were in the same boat, she was being completely transparent. This made Li Ximing sigh.

'Fei Qingfei is just a mortal... Why would Sumian take her? What could he possibly want with her?'

...

The gates of the White Ye Immortal Sect.

Brilliant golden light flickered in the sky. A golden-bodied effigy with a crimson face and sharp fangs bestrode a crimson tiger, looming on the horizon as large as a mountain. Its blue-red eyes blazed with fire, and its voice was a rolling thunder, loud enough to make a crying child fall silent.

"I wonder where Senior Yehui might be? This humble one is Chiluo, and I wish to meet the Senior!"

The voice scattered the clouds. Above the sect gate, a halo of purple light rippled with violent waves. The Purple Mansion Realm grand array was clearly operating at full power, sealing off the Great Void with an imposing show of force.

Chiluo, of course, couldn't actually break the Purple Mansion Realm array. But he delighted in watching the people inside panic at his display. He roared with laughter, the sound shaking the heavens.

He appeared to be reveling in the chaos, but the flames burning behind him flickered incessantly, forming a wheel that pulsed without pause. It seemed to be calculating changes in the Great Void and the mortal world, ready to flee at a moment's notice.

After all, Yehui was a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm master with three Divine Abilities.

Inside the grand array, the black-robed Sect Master's face was so dark it looked like it might drip blood. He watched the giant outside battering the array like a drum. Below, cultivators stumbled and fell, blood trickling from their ears. He was furious, but he knew his own Daoist Master was not going to appear.

'It's not just this Chiluo. Reports say... there are at least three or more Merciful Ones in our Capital immortals Dao territory...'

Guan Gongxiao had been worried sick these past few years. Demonic cultivators were running rampant inside, causing chaos, but he had to be wary of the Great One taking notice and couldn't act freely. He finally waited until that person left, only to turn around and have a Daoist Master from the Golden Feather Sect descend and take Su Yan away.

*Boom!*

Golden light streaked in from both sides. Guan Gongxiao's heart sank. He saw one new Merciful One holding a sword and another a saber. Both were enormous and looked dangerous, just not as ostentatious as the one riding the tiger.

The purple light of the array rippled violently. Guan Gongxiao began to panic. 'Two over there, two over here... even the Purple Mansion Realm grand array can't withstand this kind of assault!'

Just then, iridescent clouds gathered in the sky, shimmering with light. Chiluo snapped his head up, his expression wary. The markings on his face flickered and twisted as if in anger. He cursed:

"Li Ximing! You dare show your face!"

*BOOM!*

A brilliant light tore through the sky, splitting the dark clouds. Two shining pillars of a Celestial Gate emerged, banners fluttering in their wake. Golden phoenixes accompanied them, descending from the heavens trailing radiant flames.

'This thing again!'

None of the three Merciful Ones dared to remain below. Not one of them dared to receive the attack. They dissolved into qi and fled, scattering in different directions. A torrent of Heavenly Light rolled out, sweeping the area and forcing all cultivators to retreat. A Daoist Master in white-gold robes descended, standing atop the Celestial Gate, his expression icy and his tone equally sharp.
"Friends, you cause chaos in the territory of my Immortal Dao, making life miserable for the people. Are you perhaps eager to return to the Buddhist Land?"

Chiluo was genuinely wary. He had no desire to fight Li Ximing in this dangerous territory. It was still a mystery whether Yehui was present or not. If he got pinned down by the Audience with the Celestial Gate and a three-ability Yehui suddenly emerged... Chiluo could just close his eyes and wait for death.

'I was just here to probe for Yehui's location and test the reaction of the surrounding Daoist traditions... That's why I made such a scene. I can't afford to lose this dharma body.'

He didn't dare advance. Instead, he summoned the light of the Buddhist Land from afar, laughed loudly, and shouted, "What? Has Daoist Li come to play the hero? We are spreading the true dharma, promoting the sacred path. What business is it of yours, all the way from the south? It's not your place to interfere!"

The Buddhist Land was not far from here, and the cultivators from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had not yet fully assembled. Although Li Ximing knew he was only facing these three, he was in no hurry to start a major battle. He hovered the Celestial Gate above the Capital immortals Dao's main gate, confronting the three and said calmly, "Then come up and promote your 'true dharma'."

Chiluo saw he was unmoved, not budging an inch. His Buddhist Land network was well-informed; he knew Li Ximing possessed both a spirit embryo and a Spiritual Artifact, a far cry from the man he used to be. Why would he risk his own dharma body to test that blade? Moreover, since Li Ximing was here, Ning Wan and Kui Qi couldn't be far behind. He wheeled his tiger around and retreated, but he was secretly observing, judging their strength.

Li Ximing wasn't afraid of a stalemate. He had a perfect grasp of the surrounding Great Void. He watched as Guan Gongxiao rode the wind, flying out of the protective array, and cried, "Daoist Master, your righteousness is profound! This lowly one has received your grace... I am endlessly grateful!"

Li Ximing couldn't tell how complex the man's emotions truly were. But in this world, shared interests were the strongest bond. This was true for the Golden Feather Sect, and it was true for the Capital immortals Dao. The Capital immortals Dao's ambiguous stance had always been precisely because of this.

Li Ximing kept his expression cold. "I just can't stand Buddhist cultivators," he said flatly. "Where is Yehui?"

Guan Gongxiao bowed deeply. "Reporting to the Daoist Master, my Daoist Master found a fortunate opportunity and has been traveling overseas. We do not know his current whereabouts, nor when he will return..."

Guan Gongxiao's emphasis on a "fortunate opportunity" was twofold. First, it implied Yehui *could* return, the only question was whether it was *worth* returning. Second, it implied Yehui wasn't injured or in seclusion, but his strength was intact—still a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm master with three Divine Abilities.

He quickly added, "My Daoist Master spoke with me several times in the past. He said that Moongaze Lake and our sect are natural allies. It's just... he had a weakness held by Daoist Master Changxiao, which forced his hand in the Profound Peak matter. He felt great shame over it... Now... now... everyone in the Capital immortals Dao... we all owe the Daoist Master a debt of gratitude!"

He began to weep with emotion. Li Ximing glanced at him, not caring how much was real and how much was an act. He just frowned.

"Recall him. Now. The Buddhist cultivators are at your gate. If he doesn't make a move, all he'll find when he returns are your corpses!"

As he gave the order, his heart sank.

'Xuanyi mentioned that Yehui struggles when fighting Buddhist cultivators... but surely not to *this* extent!'

At this thought, Li Ximing slowly turned his gaze back to Guan Gongxiao.

'The Daoist Master isn't here, but didn't he leave his direct disciple behind? He must cultivate the same techniques. I can judge the master by observing the student.'

He studied the man and asked in a low voice, "Have you clashed with the Buddhist cultivators? What are your impressions?"
