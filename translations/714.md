# Chapter 714: Sumian

“‘Treasured Earth’?”

The Earth Virtue Dao was one of the rarest lineages in the world, and Li Ximing had never even heard of Treasured Earth.

“Treasured Earth is a type of Earth Virtue that nurtures plant life and promotes the growth of crops,” Changxi explained. “It can nourish people and artifacts alike. It is because of this ability that old Daoist Master Qi has extensive connections with the cultivators of the north.”

Seeing the understanding in Li Ximing’s eyes, the old man continued in his gravelly voice, “The Manifestation and Returning Earths of the ancient Jixian Immortals are almost entirely lost to time. Wu Earth and Bound Earth are still relatively common, but Treasured Earth is even rarer. It is perfectly normal that Zhaojing would not know of it.”

Li Ximing looked up. “I was originally thinking of introducing you to him,” Changxi said. “Now is the perfect time. You can bring your man along, and he can heal him while you’re there.”

Changxi had prepared two safety nets for the Profound Peak Gate. The first was his alliance by marriage with the Xuanmiao Temple, securing Daoist Master Qi as a backer. The second was having his direct disciples study under Mount Jingyi in the Eastern Sea. Li Ximing’s need to heal Ding Weizeng played right into his hands.

Although this Daoist Master Qi—Sumian—sounded like someone worth knowing, Li Ximing asked cautiously, “What is his background? Which lineage does he belong to? Are there any entanglements?”

Changxi was prepared for the question. “He comes from the state of Zhao, originally a cultivator from near Mount Yan. By some stroke of fortune, he obtained his Daoist lineage and went to the Eastern Sea, where he achieved his Dao. He is already four hundred years old.”

“The Daoist Master is advanced in age and prefers to act with caution in all things. He befriends cultivators from all over to ensure the future security of Xuanmiao Temple. This is not the sort of person who invites trouble… Furthermore, his lineage is a special branch of Earth Virtue, so there will naturally be no complications.”

Having lived for centuries, Changxi understood Li Ximing’s concerns and laid them out plainly. This piqued Li Ximing’s interest in meeting the man. “What is his cultivation level?” he asked.

“Initial-stage Purple Mansion!”

Li Ximing frowned. A bitter expression crossed Changxi’s face. “Zhaojing must understand… we are Earth Virtue cultivators!” he said with grave sincerity.

“Any given Earth Virtue lineage has only a handful of practitioners… To reach the Purple Mansion Realm at all is a stroke of immense fortune. Where would one find others of the same path to consult with? Most of us have no powerful backing… which makes things even more difficult.”

A look of regret washed over him, and he lowered his head, his expression weary.

“There are only so many ways for us to complete our lineages. In my younger years, I was arrogant, thinking only of finding Purple Mansion-grade techniques. After hitting a wall for over seventy years, I finally gave up that hope and started searching for Foundation Establishment techniques instead.”

His words were veiled, but Li Ximming understood immediately. ‘Searching for Foundation Establishment techniques… that can only mean he intended to use a path-continuation art to seize another’s Immortal Foundation. Changxi has no Life Divine Ability, no skill in alchemy, and no profound Daoist lineage. From the looks of him now, it clearly did not go well.’

Changxi was nearing the end of his lifespan, his recent years sustained only by medicine. Recalling these past events brought a look of remorse to his face, which was now veiled by a faint, gray aura of death.

“There are many who cultivate the Bound Earth Dao, but at the Foundation Establishment Realm, they all practice either Fool’s Mountain Chase or a substitute for it. I finally managed to find two manuals among rogue cultivators, but their quality was far too low…”

“The Profound Peak Gate already lacked successors. I could not bring myself to make my own disciples cultivate a path just to extend my own. So I sent the techniques out into the wilderness and the Eastern Sea, intentionally providing some resources to see if anything would come of it.”

“But I have no Life Divine Ability, and who knows which Daoist Master from which sect… simply erased them with a wave of his hand. Or perhaps the techniques themselves were just too inferior. Not a single person succeeded. Few even reached the Qi Refining stage.”

“In over a hundred years, I only had a few successes. But I knew nothing of this method and had to research it all myself… In the end, nothing came of it. I could only accept them as guest retainers.”

The path-continuation method was clearly no simple matter, especially for a small sect like Profound Peak Gate. Li Ximing mentally calculated the timeline. “The Green Pine Grotto-Heaven… Tingyun went, did she not?”

“She did.” Changxi nodded and sighed. “I had no right to a share of the old Mirrored-Mirrage Grotto-Heaven. Fortunately, the Green Pine Grotto-Heaven appeared later. I fought tooth and nail just to send Tingyun inside. She transcribed three techniques from the Three-Drum Wall, and all three were dead ends!”

“I spent the better part of a century modifying them… scattering the manuals and then gathering the disciples to check on their progress. I finally managed to revise one of them by sixty or seventy percent… but by then, it was too late.”

A self-deprecating smile touched Changxi’s lips. “Blame me for being arrogant at first, and then for overreaching. A hundred years passed in the blink of an eye. And what if I had succeeded in mastering that divine ability? I would still be facing death. This half-finished technique can only be left for my descendants… If the Profound Peak lineage can be preserved, a successor can pick up where I left off. In less than a hundred years, they could at least cultivate a second divine ability.”

A chill went down Li Ximing’s spine. The old man’s words seemed to be aimed at him, a subtle warning using his own life as an example. He remained silent.

“The Three-Drum Wall in the Green Pine Temple left us three techniques,” Changxi continued. “If a successor can revise another one, in five hundred years, my Profound Peak Gate will have a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator. And who can predict the fortunes of future generations? Perhaps one will find a way to cross the threshold into the immortal realms.”

Seeing that Li Ximing was still silent, he finally offered his advice directly. “We are not of the Green Pine lineage, after all. We cannot cultivate it just because we wish to. I have seen how your clan searches for techniques; your Bright Yang lineage is also incomplete. You must be careful.”

Li Ximing nodded in acknowledgment. A visit to Xuanmiao Temple was certainly in order. Not only was the old Daoist Master of Treasured Earth a significant figure, but his own plans for Jiangbei would benefit from the temple’s support.

‘Besides, it was Daoist Master Chuting who suggested I seek out Changxi. With his skill in divination, he clearly saw no problem with it… perhaps he even hoped my clan would get involved in Jiangbei.’

He and Changxi took to the air. Li Ximing activated his divine ability, lifting Ding Weizeng from where he waited below, and together they flew into the Great Void. As they traveled through the ethereal plane, Li Ximing took the opportunity to ask, “Daoist Master, what are your thoughts on the matter of Dense Cloud Cave?”

Changxi looked slightly embarrassed. Li Ximing’s words were polite, but to Changxi’s ears, the meaning was clear: ‘My people are already on the move, securing the Floating Cloud territory and have now crossed Baijiang Creek… Where are your Profound Peak disciples?’

“My clan’s cultivators have already reached the wilderness,” he said quickly. “They are using artifacts to conceal themselves and are secretly advancing toward Dense Cloud Cave.”

“Dense Cloud Cave is merely a subordinate of the White Ye Immortal Sect. Yehui has no Life Divine Ability and is not skilled in divination. He will not be able to predict this.”

Li Ximing wasn’t worried about Yehui, but about Changxiao. However, those two had no real friendship, only a shared interest in opposing his clan. He considered this and replied, “Xuanmiao Temple is but a stone’s throw from Baijiang Creek, so it can be watched over. Besides, you and I appearing at Xuanmiao Temple at this time… who knows what suspicions that will raise.”

The White Ye Immortal Sect had a few notable figures, but Li Zhouwei was carrying the Li clan’s trump card—a Purple Mansion-grade talisman. Li Ximing’s only fear was that the White Ye sect might be prepared and that Li Chenghui and the others would be lost. Hearing that the Profound Peak disciples were on their way, he finally felt at ease.

After a brief conversation, they emerged from the Great Void. A deep black cliff loomed before them on the edge of the sea. Massive waves crashed against it, creating a thunderous roar.

Cultivators could be seen flying to and from the cliff. A short distance away, the terrain rose into a small, verdant hill. There were no pavilions or halls, only a scene of natural beauty, with a single Daoist temple at its peak.

Changxi led him toward the temple. The great array was already open, shimmering with a clear, rippling light. A young man stood before the gate, dressed in a simple white robe, his Daoist cap faintly glowing. He was tall, with slightly deep-set eyes, not looking like a southern cultivator.

“Greetings, Daoist Master Changxi, Daoist Master Zhaojing.” He bowed his head, performing a perfect circular salute. “This humble Daoist welcomes you both! My master has been waiting for some time for your esteemed arrival.”

“It has been a while, Qiuxin. Your cultivation has improved again!” Changxi laughed, his tone warm and familiar, like one speaking to a junior of his own family. They landed within the temple grounds, and Changxi headed for the main hall.

The hall was plain on the outside, but the interior was furnished in rich, dark colors. The scent of incense hung in the air. Li Ximing’s gaze swept across the room. At the head of the hall was a white cloth hanging, on which was painted a faceless Daoist riding a donkey.

“Daoist friend Changxi! It has been too long!”

A middle-aged abbot walked out from within the hall. He had a squarish face and wore simple, unremarkable clothes. This was, of course, the master of Xuanmiao Temple, Daoist Master Sumian!

He bowed, then looked at Changxi’s face. The abbot seemed to know some art of qi observation. His expression changed. “My friend… how have things become so dire?”

Sumian and Changxi were clearly old friends, and both were Earth Virtue cultivators. A sense of shared sorrow filled his face with worry. Changxi returned the bow. “Mount Jingyi had some trouble a few years ago. Xuanyi asked for my help. I didn’t expect to receive a minor injury, and with the recent shift in the spiritual atmosphere, my complexion has worsened.”

Li Ximing watched closely. At the mention of Daoist Master Xuanyi, Sumian frowned slightly but said nothing more. He sighed. “The workings of heaven are boundless and ever-changing. The Upper Evil Spirit Storage can no longer hold… It is beyond our power. So be it, so be it!”

Sumian was also an Earth Virtue cultivator. The current spiritual atmosphere, the Inward Heart Surging Profundity, was detrimental to earth, which was clearly not a good thing for him. He looked up at Li Ximing. “You must be Zhaojing!”

“I am… Greetings, Senior!”

“Ah,” Daoist Master Sumian smiled. “Zhaojing, no need for such ceremony. Please, come inside.”

They entered, offered incense together, and then moved to the rear courtyard. “My Xuanmiao Temple carries the lineage of the ancient Tongxuan Palace,” Sumian said leisurely. “The painting you saw depicts True Monarch Xuxiang of Tongxuan Palace, who attained the fruition of the ‘Treasured Earth’ Dao…”

“So, a True Monarch.” Li Ximing had already suspected as much when he saw the faceless painting. ‘Since the lineage is so grand, yet he only has a single Purple Mansion divine ability, it is likely not the orthodox line,’ he thought. ‘Nine times out of ten, he stumbled upon a piece of the inheritance by chance.’

Sumian led them to the rear courtyard. In its center stood an ancient, bronze-colored alchemy furnace of excellent quality. Other than that, there were only a few meditation cushions. After they were all seated, with Ding Weizeng standing respectfully to one side, Sumian picked up the conversation. “Changxi, did you come this time to introduce Zhaojing?”

“Indeed.” Changxi drew a breath, his face reverting to its middle-aged appearance. He made a gesture and gave a brief introduction, but Li Ximing had already been briefed on the old Daoist Master, and Sumian likewise knew of the newly ascended Purple Mansion cultivator. They exchanged some pleasantries.

Sumian’s attitude toward him was friendly. “I hear Zhaojing is an alchemist,” he joked. “I will have much to ask of you in the future. I must make sure to build a good relationship with you now!”

“Senior is too kind!” Li Ximing knew not to take such words at face value. Judging by the alchemy furnace in the courtyard, it was entirely possible that Sumian’s skill in alchemy surpassed his own.

The requirements for alchemy were a balance of yin and yang within the Shengyang Acupoint and a vibrant Cinnabar Cloud within the Sea of Qi, where water and fire were in harmony. These conditions were rare, but for a Purple Mansion cultivator, they were trivial.

A Purple Mansion cultivator could shape their own Sea of Qi. Never mind a vibrant Cinnabar Cloud and the harmony of water and fire; they could even create the unified yin and yang and the vast heavenly glows required by a weapons refiner. Aside from a few specific lineages, most Purple Mansion cultivators could mold their internal environment as they wished.

Balancing yin and yang in the Shengyang Acupoint was slightly more difficult, but as long as one’s lineage was among the twelve core Qis, or not too heavily skewed toward yin or yang, it could be gradually adjusted.

Li Ximing was born with these conditions, but cultivators like Changxi could also practice alchemy if they so chose. It was merely a matter of proficiency… they simply wouldn’t be as naturally gifted as Li Ximing.

Changxi, listening nearby, feared Li Ximing might ask an awkward question. He quickly interjected, speaking on his behalf, “Daoist friend Sumian has taken a great interest in alchemy in recent years. He cultivates ‘Treasured Earth’ and is a northern cultivator, quite different from those in Jiangnan… You can let him take a look at your retainer.”

“Then I must trouble you, Senior!” Li Ximing smiled and bowed.

Sumian had already noticed Ding Weizeng. He beckoned him over, took his wrist, and diagnosed his condition without a moment’s thought. He nodded. “A fine ‘Palace-Yang Tiger’! Your Immortal Foundation is the same as that of Daoist Master Yanque of the Hengzhu Dao, two hundred years ago. He was a great cultivator of his time.”

He released his hand, formed a seal with one hand, and with a gentle pull, drew a handful of ash from the alchemy furnace. He sprinkled it into a jade bowl, then broke a branch from a willow tree in the courtyard. He deftly dipped it in clear water and said in a warm voice, “Do you practice alchemy or weapon refining? Your Dantian is damaged, and your yin and yang qi have been leaking. I will mend it for you now, but you will no longer be able to practice alchemy or weapon refining in the future.”

“Replying to the Daoist Master,” Ding Weizeng said respectfully, “this lowly one never had such fortune to begin with.”

Sumian had him hold the jade bowl. He then took the water-dipped willow branch and struck him twice across the abdomen. “Close your eyes!” he commanded.

Ding Weizeng shut his eyes just in time to see a multicolored light of a divine ability spray from Sumian’s mouth and flow over his body. A faint light stirred between Li Ximing’s brows. He knew that Ding Weizeng’s injury was already healed.

‘Healed, just like that!’

Of all the things Sumian had done, only the handful of ash, burned from some spiritual material, was even remotely mystical. The rest were all common items. An injury that was incurable for Foundation Establishment and Qi Refining cultivators, save for a few special spiritual medicines… was healed, just like that!

Seeing their astonishment, Sumian smiled and shook his head. “Not at all. On one side, we have Bright Yang; on the other, Bound Earth. My Treasured Earth merely acted as a medium, creating a situation where the heavenly sun shines, all plants flourish, and life abounds. I simply borrowed the Purple Mansion dignities of you both and took a small shortcut…”

“But it is more than enough to demonstrate the Daoist Master’s profound skill!” Li Ximing praised. From what he had seen, Sumian acted with integrity. Regardless of his hidden thoughts, his conduct so far suggested he was reliable and worthy of friendship. He smiled. “Weizeng, quickly, thank the Daoist Master!”
