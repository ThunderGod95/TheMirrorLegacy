# Chapter 975: Crow Fire

The sky was clear and bright, casting the ranks of mountain peaks into shadow. A sea of mist drifted past, pierced by summits that seemed to connect heaven and earth. A golden sheen covered everything. Myriad streams of glazed, immortal light descended like golden mist, thousands raining down like trails of starlight, bathing the vast, glass-like platform in brilliant radiance.

Li Zhouwei stood bathed in the ethereal light, his long halberd resting lightly at his side. He tilted his head back, watching as the last streams of multicolored light faded into the distance, descending upon scattered locations. After countless silent ages, Wanling Heaven was finally stirring with activity.

"It's a carnival," he murmured.

As soon as he entered, Li Zhouwei felt the difference. Certain arrays and treasures in this grotto-heaven were clearly still active. Most notably, his connection to the Great Void was severed. Both his Shengyang Acupoint and his main body were sealed inside this domain.

This was similar to the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, so he wasn't surprised. Like every other Purple Mansion Realm cultivator just arriving in Wanling Heaven, his first thought was of an exit strategy.

'No connection to the Great Void... that means I can't enter or leave at will. Getting in was easy, but getting out will be hard. There are probably only two ways: find the grotto-heaven's official exit, or... use a Great Void-walking technique.'

He raised his hand, preparing to test a divine ability, but his eyes narrowed.

Wisps of golden dharma power, like smoke or mist, were drifting from his palm, trying to fly towards the dome of the grotto-heaven. With a thought, Li Zhouwei's divine ability quickly wrangled them back.

He closed his eyes and sensed it carefully, a hypothesis forming instantly.

'There's a wondrous suppressing and absorbing effect in this grotto-heaven. It seems to be the after-effect of an array or treasure, vast and endless... It's constantly trying to drain the divine ability and dharma power from my body. If a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator came in here, they'd probably die from dharma power exhaustion within six hours.'

Fortunately, the suppression force wasn't too strong in this location. His dharma body was tough, and even before he had mastered his Body Divine Ability, this interference wouldn't have been enough to force him out, let alone now. It was just less convenient than the outside world, and his spiritual sense was restricted to within three zhang.

That was fine in his peak state, but if a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was heavily injured and had to fight this constant draining effect, their dharma power and divine abilities would fail. What was terrifying was that in this grotto-heaven, the Shengyang Acupoint of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator resided within their dharma body. If the dharma body was destroyed, the Shengyang Acupoint couldn't even flee to the Great Void! It would be exposed to this suppression, and any escape technique would be useless.

'The opportunities here may be limitless, but it's also a death trap in disguise. Even if your enemy doesn't hunt you down... you could still perish from your injuries!'

'As for the limited spiritual sense... that's just a minor inconvenience.'

He glanced down and saw the ground dotted with the colors of divine abilities.

The grotto-heaven was vast. The various Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had a tacit agreement. When landing, they would all release the glow of their divine abilities, shining brightly like lotuses blooming on the earth, signaling that the area was claimed. This prevented cultivators from accidentally running into each other due to their restricted spiritual sense.

After all, at this early stage, opportunities were everywhere. No one would intentionally land in the same spot and waste time competing.

Li Zhouwei hadn't chosen his spot randomly. As he entered, he had scanned the area with his golden eyes. A sweep of his Spirit Probe ability led him to a nearby mountain peak with the most powerful array-aura. It was glowing brilliantly, likely a grand palace from the path of Auspicious Qi.

But as the light washed over his face and he neared the ground, he didn't descend immediately. Instead, he put two fingers to his lips and blew, exhaling a dense cloud of Heavenly Light.

The Heavenly Light split into three parts and shot down from the sky. With a roar, it precisely struck three peaks surrounding the main palace, claiming them as a diversion for later exploration. Only then did he leisurely descend toward the palace itself.

_Tap._

He landed softly on the wide summit platform. Instantly, twelve lamp platforms lit up, blocking the glazed light from the sky. The palace before him was tall and magnificent, and a watery, rippling light washed over him.

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. He saw a stele on the platform, inscribed with dancing golden characters:

【Xinhu Palace】.

The palace had a powerful aura. The main platform was vast, supporting a bright, shining golden palace. Below the high platform, eight smaller palaces were built into the mountainside, all glittering.

As Li Zhouwei took a step forward, a pale white barrier of light immediately shimmered into existence. Strands of Auspicious Qi swirled within it, isolating the inside from the outside. He probed it with his spiritual sense and nodded to himself.

'As strong as I thought!'

This array was a product of Auspicious Qi, far surpassing his own Zhaoguang Profound Purple Spirit Array. Li Zhouwei had never seen the Profound Turtle Mansion-Guarding Spirit Array, so he couldn't compare them. But if he tried to break this array by himself, it would not only be loud, but it would take an eternity.

But Li Zhouwei had already assessed the situation before landing. This wasn't a problem. He simply formed a hand seal and activated his divine ability.

The palace's original master, existing within a grotto-heaven, had never intended this array to repel powerful enemies. Its main function was to aid in cultivation and provide isolation. The array's bases were the eight small palaces on the mountainside, which allowed it to cover a larger area and envelop the entire mountain in its wondrous effects to help disciples cultivate...

Golden light began to glow in his eyes. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light erupted from the point between his brows, forming a golden beam that shot across the mountain. With a _boom_, it shattered the array formation of the nearest small palace.

He didn't hesitate. He turned his head slightly, and the bright golden beam swept across the mountainside. The sound of shattering echoed as his figure flickered, moving like a streak of golden light, weaving through the peaks. In a mere moment, he reappeared in his original spot.

By now, all the small palaces on the mountain were in ruins, looted clean. A glow of Bright Yang light manifested in his hand, holding eight long incense sticks with golden bases and silver patterns.

'These eight small palaces seem to be sacrificial halls... Although each had different patterns and styles, they all stored one of these gold-patterned profound incense sticks.'

Li Zhouwei didn't know their purpose, but he could tell they were at the Purple Mansion Realm level. He casually stored them in a golden box and turned his attention back to the main array.

The array's light had dimmed significantly, its divine ability suppressed. However, it was still connected to a divine ability deep underground, retaining some of its power. He assessed it.

"When ancient cultivators built grotto-heavens, they often used a great divine ability to carve an array base at the bottom of the heaven, called a 'Profound Foundation'. These arrays on the mountain peaks can connect directly to Wanling Heaven's Profound Foundation to gain a power-up... That must be what this is."

"The foundation of this Wanling Heaven is truly deep. Even though the master had little intention of repelling enemies, and even with its array bases destroyed, the mere connection to the Profound Foundation still leaves it with Purple Mansion Realm-level power..."

He stepped forward and gave his arm a shake. He didn't use his dharma body, nor did he draw the Grand Ascension. Instead, he unhooked the Radiant Sun King's Halberd from his waist.

What Spiritual Artifact could be more suitable for this?

He gripped it tightly. The Splitting Light wondrous effect activated instantly. The grotto-heaven's power suppressed the light, confining it to a three-foot radius, but he smashed it against the white barrier with a _boom_. The array brightened for a moment, and a white scar appeared where he had struck.

Li Zhouwei's eyes lit up. 'It really is just borrowing power from the grotto-heaven's Profound Foundation! With the grotto-heaven in its current state, that power is like water without a source!'

Before the mark could fade, the next blow from the halberd landed on the exact same spot. Light exploded repeatedly. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd was incredibly cumbersome, but it was Li Zhouwei's most powerful Spiritual Artifact. A cultivator who had achieved the Body Divine Ability would still cough up blood if hit by it, let alone an immobile array taking dozens of hits?

The array's light flickered faster and faster, finally emitting a strained, cracking sound. Countless white fragments scattered and dissolved into flowing light on the ground.

"Good... to be this sturdy... it actually withstood dozens of strikes without any reinforcement!"

Li Zhouwei put away the Spiritual Artifact. The palace doors, however, wobbled unsteadily. Hit by the shockwave of the divine ability, they collapsed with a crash, revealing the scene inside.

Sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues lined the hall, eight to a side. They were astonishingly tall, their heads touching the roof beams and their feet planted on the floor. They held spears and banners, halberds and swords. Deeper inside stood sixteen massive pillars, each ten arm-spans around, painted with patterns of raging flames and murals of the Mansion Water's drowning depths.

Carved on the beams were Crimson-Eyed Ember-Pelt Crows. Around the pillars perched thousands of folded-wing sparrows. The plinths were carved as Plume-Throated Profound Turtles, and at the foot of the steps crouched Three-Eyed Chaoshan Beasts. All these Spirit Beasts had their heads bowed, not daring to look up. The central hall was perfectly round and exuded an air of supreme nobility.

'What incredible grandeur!' Li Zhouwei's eyes flashed. 'My Spirit Probe ability was right. This must be the most valuable place in the entire mountain range—perhaps even a ceremonial or sacrificial ground for a Dao Lineage! No wonder the array was so tough!'

Not only that, but under the observation of his Spirit Probe, he could see that divine ability was condensed within the sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues. They were spiritually potent and secretly linked to the Profound Foundation deep within the grotto-heaven. If they awakened, their power would be extraordinary.

His golden eyes swept over the statues again and again, but a question rose in his heart. 'What Dao Lineage is this? Why does the divine ability and dharma power on these statues feel so unfamiliar? It's Ancient Merging, without a doubt, but a kind I've never seen before...'

Growing wary, he stepped forward into the hall. He tried to look at the main seat, but a large standing screen completely blocked the view.

The screen was painted with a Crimson-Eyed Ember-Pelt Crow. It had a small head, a short neck, and a long, hooked beak. Its back was hunched as if poised to strike, and its messy feathers seemed to roil and flow like flickering flames.

The crow's beak was raised high, its mouth open, aimed at the highest point of the screen. A single, bright white flame burned fiercely where its beak pointed.

'A Yuwu bird... or at least a descendant or related species.'

The small white flame was extremely active, constantly twitching. It seemed to be struggling, yet also dancing with joy. An intense, intimidating wave of heat washed over him, making his whole body feel scorching hot.

'Worthy of an Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition! How extravagant!'

A delighted smile spread across Li Zhouwei's face, and he chuckled to himself.

'Uncle-Grandfather is in luck! I've found a spirit fire for him already!'

The screen was actually enshrining a Purple Mansion Realm spirit fire!

He reached out, lifted the screen, and examined it closely. He quickly sensed something was wrong.

The screen had three panels. The first showed the Yuwu bird raising its head and crying out. The second, much lower, showed it with its beak closed, as if in congress. The final panel showed it with its head tucked under its wing, as if sleeping.

But each panel had a corresponding empty slot.

'There should have been three spirit fires...'

But as he pondered this, the Crimson-Eyed Ember-Pelt Crow on the screen suddenly turned its eyes and stared straight at him!

In that instant, the flames on the screen flared, and the white spirit fire poured down, filled with killing intent.

Li Zhouwei, far from being alarmed, laughed with amusement. "Insolent beast!"

His shout wasn't loud, but it cracked like thunder, instantly scattering the white spirit fire. But it also caused every statue in the great hall to come alive!

The thousands of sparrows took flight, the Three-Eyed Chaoshan Beast whipped its head around, the Plume-Throated Profound Turtle roared, and the Crimson-Eyed Ember-Pelt Crows on the beams spat fire. All of them lunged at him. Li Zhouwei didn't even bother to draw the Grand Ascension. He just laughed.

"Scram!"

With one kick, he shattered the stone turtle. He reached up, tore a Crimson-Eyed Ember-Pelt Crow from the beam, twisted its wings, and threw it aside.

"You're just carvings that absorbed some spiritual energy," he scoffed. "You've been nurtured by spiritual qi for a thousand years and gained a sliver of a spirit fire's authority, but you don't even have the sense to see who you're dealing with!"

At this, the Three-Eyed Chaoshan Beast squatting at the steps froze, turning back into a statue. Li Zhouwei couldn't be bothered with it. He plucked the Purple Mansion Realm spirit fire from the screen. A quick scan with his spiritual sense told him what it was.

It was, of course, Merging Fire. But it was different from common Merging Fire; this flame carried an aura of radiance. Li Zhouwei had obtained Supreme Yang spiritual items before and was very familiar with this aura. It was the power of the Supreme Yang Dao. Joy flooded his heart.

'It must be a Merging Fire related to the Supreme Yang! Any spiritual item, let alone a spirit fire, increases in value immensely just by being associated with the Supreme Yang!'

The spirit fire was searing hot in his hand and tried to escape. Li Zhouwei couldn't refine it instantly, but he suppressed it with his rolling Bright Yang divine ability, crushing it into a tiny, immobile speck of radiance in his palm.

With its power source gone, the screen crashed to the floor in a heap of gold and stone, revealing what lay behind it.

Glazed light filled the air. In the center of the hall sat a square, green-bronze cauldron.

The cauldron had a stark, angular design. It wasn't large, but the profound patterns covering it were extremely complex, mostly depicting flying birds. Its belly was engraved with the pattern of a Profound Giant Turtle over a carving of a lake.

The square lid of the cauldron was trembling slightly, as if it were sitting on boiling water, rattling at the edges. Blinding white light pulsed from it, and faint arcs of lightning could be seen leaping from the seams before being yanked back by a wondrous effect. A stinging aura filled the air.

With just one look, Li Zhouwei understood.

'An item of Profound Thunder from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist tradition!'

He didn't rush forward. His gaze slowly moved down to the swirling array patterns the cauldron was suppressing. He grew cautious.

'I walked deep into this hall, and the sixteen Profound-Guarding Spirit Statues did nothing. It seems they were meant for this. The moment this cauldron is moved, the statues guarding Xinhu Palace will, in all likelihood, activate...'
