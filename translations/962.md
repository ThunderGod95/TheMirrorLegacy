# Chapter 962: Mushroom Forest Plains

Qi Lanyan idly tossed a small bone fragment in his hand. He looked up, a smile playing on his lips. "Well now, Daoist Murong... what brings you here?"

Murong Yan stood stiffly in the courtyard, his expression dark.

Those figures in the Buddhist Land were definitely plotting something, using him—Murong Yan—as their pawn. But this smiling Qi Lanyan was no better!

'Those old fools in the Buddhist Land want to use me as a shield. But I am a Murong. Even if I'm not from the imperial line, I'm still a direct descendant. The worst they can do is exploit me, or perhaps force me into their Buddhist Land... But Qi Lanyan? That bastard genuinely wants me dead!'

The Murong clan and Viewing Pavilion had never seen eye to eye; their animosity wasn't new. When the Great Liang collapsed and warlords rose, the Qi family was crushed by the Murong clan. The Qi ancestor, Qi Wang, was even captured by Murong Dechang and forced into a lifetime of service... The Qi clan had always prided itself as a noble family of Yincheng, enfeoffed by the Zhou dynasty. With their supposedly highborn blood, they already looked down on 'outer barbarians'—how could they possibly stomach such a humiliation!

Back then, the entire Qi family swore an oath in blood and tears, dedicating themselves to becoming the mortal enemies of the "Murong barbarians." With the passage of time and the Murong's rise to power, things had calmed down on the surface. The Qi family kept quiet. But who knew what they truly thought in their hearts?

Murong Yan knew this encounter was trouble the moment he saw him. Today, it was clearer than ever. Even though his own backing was unstable, bowing his head to Qi Lanyan would only lead to humiliation.

His expression turned cold. "Naturally," he said flatly, "I am here to await Lord Qi's instructions."

Qi Lanyan stood up with a pleasant smile, appearing perfectly courteous.

"Instructions? There are no instructions. I only ask that Daoist Murong station your forces outside the mountain. Once there's a result from the Grotto-Heaven, we will invite you all to enter... Oh, right. And Lord Gao... is he willing to come in? I just fear that if a conflict arises with the Li clan, it might... dampen his spirits!"

Shilou Yingge had always insisted his surname was Shilou. Qi Lanyan was just playing dumb, deliberately calling him 'Gao'. His smile was blatant mockery. Murong Yan replied coldly, "Daoist Shilou always follows your arrangements. I have no idea who this 'Lord Gao' is. As for Touba..."

"Enough!"

He had barely uttered the name 'Touba' when a clear, cold voice drifted from the hall doors behind Qi Lanyan, cutting him off sharply.

A cold sweat instantly beaded on Murong Yan's brow. He scrambled to bow toward the hall. "I did not realize Lord Wei was present!"

Murong Yan didn't need to look to know that Qi Lanyan was sneering behind his back.

The hall doors opened softly, and a voice summoned him. Murong Yan hurried forward. Sure enough, a man in white robes stood within the hall. He was holding a small box, seemingly admiring its contents, his face bathed in a faint, golden glow.

Seeing him enter, Wei Xuanyin set the box down and said formally, "You have endured much, Daoist Murong."

Murong Yan merely shook his head cautiously.

Wei Xuanyin glanced at him. "I had assumed the Yan Kingdom would manage this," he said casually, "and I did not wish to disturb the plans of the Great Virtues. I did not expect this... misunderstanding. Perhaps the news was delayed, which caused you alarm, Daoist Murong."

What could Murong Yan say to such a direct question? Complain about his own backers in the Buddhist Land and expose his own weakness? He could only swallow his bitterness and force a smile. "The Buddhist Land did provide some guidance... It was my own fault. I was too eager and misinterpreted their intentions!"

It was impossible to tell if Wei Xuanyin believed him. He simply nodded.

"Both our sides lost many good subordinates this time. Once we are inside the Grotto-Heaven, we can certainly support one another and recoup our losses... In a few days, the Lord of the White Victory Dao will arrive. He will stop first at Luoxia. The proper welcoming ceremonies are, of course, essential. We are not well-versed in such etiquette, so we must ask Daoist Murong to handle the reception."

"Yes..." Murong Yan agreed in a low voice, his heart pounding. Wei Xuanyin's words sounded pleasant, but they gave him no comfort.

'The Viewing Pavilion faction may be Luoxia's lapdogs now, but Qi Lanyan cultivates the Horn Wood Dao and Wei Xuanyin cultivates the Veiled Yin Dao. Neither path is related to the Luoxia orthodoxy, and they certainly don't share Luoxia's tolerance or magnanimity toward immortal cultivators...'

He wasn't as guarded against Wei Xuanyin as he was Qi Lanyan, but he felt no particular goodwill either. He forced a smile. "I will follow your instructions, my lord. However, I've heard that Daoist Friend Zong Chang and Daoist Friend Gongsun have already reached Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain. They should be arriving soon..."

With Wei Xuanyin present, any thought Murong Yan had of negotiating with Qi Lanyan or pressuring the Yan Kingdom evaporated. He could only retreat, frustrated and empty-handed.

Qi Lanyan didn't even lift his gaze. Only after Murong Yan was gone did his smile vanish.

"Murong Yan really was completely in the dark. Those 'compassionate visages' in the Buddhist Land are truly ruthless. Compassion is one thing, but a Murong is another... Still, I suppose it makes sense."

Wei Xuanyin shook his head, looking displeased. "You acted too rashly in this matter."

Seeing Qi Lanyan's confusion, he continued in a low voice, "Do you know why Murong Yan faced this calamity?"

"There has been no word from Lord Xue, and the Mountain offers no protection. The longer this drags on, the more suspicious the northern powers become. They are starting to grow covetous of Li Zhouwei..."

"The Way of Compassion is no different. With the precedent of the Undefeated King of Brightness, and seeing the Mountain's continued silence, how could they not feel greedy for the White Qilin? Li Zhouwei isn't easy to convert, but if they could _kill_ him and forge a great karmic bond, the benefits would be no less than swallowing the Yan Kingdom."

"So, they started scheming. They ignored Murong Yan, hoping he would meet with disaster. They want this karmic entanglement to grow, hoping it will eventually be big enough to drag the entire Way of Compassion into the conflict."

"But Murong Yan is a true seeker of immortality—otherwise he wouldn't have so firmly chosen the Valley Water path. He covets a Golden Attainment and feels ashamed to be confined to a mere Buddhist Attainment. He would only consider becoming one of the Buddhist cultivators as an absolute last resort. Why would he willingly become their sacrifice? That's why he was cut off from all information."

Qi Lanyan fell silent. Wei Xuanyin continued softly, "But the Mountain's stance remains unclear, and the Way of Compassion is obviously hesitant. Murong Yan, after all, is exceptionally talented. Li Zhouwei, on the other hand, could be a fool's errand—a total loss. They want Murong Yan injured and resentful, a variable they can use to enter the game at the right moment. But they don't want him dead. That's why they behaved so contradictorily, cutting off his information while simultaneously protecting him in the Great Void."

Understanding dawned on Qi Lanyan. Wei Xuanyin continued faintly,

"Unfortunately for them, someone tipped their hand—perhaps to deliberately spite the Way of Compassion. Or perhaps that White Qilin's golden eyes are just that formidable. He must have sensed the figures in the Great Void. He held back, never unleashing his True Fire. The gambit failed, and now Murong Yan is on high alert. He's unlikely to stick his neck out like that again."

Qi Lanyan was silent for a long time before asking, "Martial Uncle... what are your thoughts?"

But Wei Xuanyin simply lowered his gaze, saying nothing. After a long moment, he finally lifted his writing brush, his eyes still fixed on the desk. "The Way of Compassion wasn't the first to have such ideas," he said quietly, "and they won't be the last. We wait."

He rolled up the scroll from his desk, tucked it into his sleeve, and picked up the small box. It immediately bathed the room in a pale golden light. Qi Lanyan glanced over. Inside, a small seal, perhaps two fingers wide, was set into a base, its side just visible.

Wei Xuanyin shook his head and smiled. "I'm going to the Eastern Sea... to see an old friend."

...

The sky brightened as the Morning Glow spread across the horizon. A vast, vibrant plain stretched out, following the fertile banks of a small stream. Soon, several streaks of magical light sped into view.

The young man in the lead had a noble and refined bearing. He wore an elegant feathered robe with a jade belt at his waist, clearly the scion of a wealthy or powerful family. He rode a silver-scaled steed that shimmered with a brilliant light.

The young woman beside him was dressed in a simple white skirt, yet the fabric itself seemed to glow faintly. Her features were clear and beautiful, and she carried an ethereal, otherworldly air.

The young man smiled faintly and gestured to the lands before them. "Tianyou, this is Fengxiang Prefecture, part of the Mushroom Forest Plains. It's a treasured land with unique scenery..."

"Oh?" The young woman glanced at him with a smile. "Have you been here before, Brother Liang?"

Li Jiangliang laughed. "I rested here once during my travels south. A companion told me about this place. It used to be occupied by the Eastern Yue, who worshipped a great elephant. Later, a cultivator named Yuan Chengdun wiped them out and seized their dharma artifact. He settled in this prefecture, and it's been named for that event ever since."

Yang Tianyou said softly, "So, it was him."

The two stopped within the prefecture city, and a crowd of people immediately rushed forward, bowing obsequiously. "Young Master!"

The young man waved his hand dismissively, his brow furrowed. "Who is in charge here?"

The crowd immediately prostrated themselves, a ripple of fear passing through them. After much shuffling and pushing, a middle-aged man was finally forced to step forward.

The man's hair was mostly gray, giving him an aged look. Though his features had a trace of nobility, he was missing one eye and his beard was unkempt. He stumbled forward and bowed deeply.

He was visibly terrified. He shuffled forward to take the reins of Li Jiangliang's horse, bowing his body humbly to the side. "This... this lowly one greets the Young Master," he stammered.

Li Jiangliang glanced at him and smiled. "Which family do you belong to? Your cultivation isn't bad. You can show us around."

The man dropped to his knees with a thud. "This lowly one is no more than a slave! I fear my words would only soil your honorable ears!"

Li Jiangliang's smile didn't waver. "Speak. You have my permission."

A stir went through the crowd; all eyes turned to the man. He bowed his head even lower, revealing the gaunt, protruding vertebrae of his neck. "This lowly one... is... Yuan Fuyao," he trembled.

"Oh!" Li Jiangliang gave his steed a light kick. The silver-scaled spirit-beast snorted, yanking the reins from the man's grasp. "What a coincidence!" Li Jiangliang laughed.

He swung off his horse as he spoke. Another man, this one with a full head of white hair, hurried from the crowd. He shoved Yuan Fuyao aside, pulling him back, his own face wreathed in a subservient smile. "This lowly one is Ding Xiding! I greet the Young Master!"

Though the old man's hair was white, his eyebrows were thick and his expression was hearty. He seemed incredibly excited. "My lord... my lord... this way, please!"

Yang Tianyou likewise dismounted from her Spirit Beast, and the two walked forward, immediately surrounded by the bustling crowd. One of Li Jiangliang's attendants, who seemed to know Ding Xiding, chuckled. "Old man Ding! I remember you bragging about how you and the great Lord Celestial Moon Sword were sworn brothers. What's wrong? Now that his family is here in front of you, you've gone mute?"

The old man's face flushed crimson. His thick eyebrows shot up, but the boasts that had once come so easily now stuck in his throat. All he could do was stammer, "Back then... I... I did see him..."

Li Jiangliang smiled. "I know... the Ding family. You once had a presence by the lake, bordering the An clan's territory."

At these words, Ding Xiding's eyes filled with tears, and he nodded frantically. "The Young Master is incredible! So well-read in history, to remember such an old affair... This lowly one is endlessly grateful!"

Back when Li Tongya first achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm, he had been filled with sighs and jealousy, refusing to speak of it. But as Li Tongya's fame spread and the Li family produced more and more Foundation Establishment cultivators, he gradually began to brag about his connection. By the time the Li family had a Purple Mansion Realm expert, Ding Xiding dared not speak of it at all.

Now, to be mentioned by a junior of that great man's family, he felt so honored that he wept on the spot.

Meanwhile, Yuan Fuyao—the man he had once fawned over, calling him "Young Master" at every breath—was cast aside like rubbish, standing alone and shrinking in on himself.

The crowd escorted them into the prefecture's main hall. Li Jiangliang gave a wave of his hand, and they all dispersed like the wind.

Yang Tianyou smiled. "This place is too close to Moongaze Lake. Everyone knows of the Li family, and all the local gossip revolves around the lake. I'm afraid everyone knows about Yuan Fuyao's little story."

Li Jiangliang shook his head with a laugh. "There's no need to give him a hard time. We still need to win the people's hearts, after all. Your brother just finished settling the Yuan clan; it wouldn't look good for me to cause trouble now... Besides... I rather think I should thank him."

Yang Tianyou clearly knew what he meant and shook her head, amused. She and Li Jiangliang wandered through the prefecture for a while, observing their surroundings.

"We still need to deal with the small local clans," he said in a low voice.

"That part is easy. The problem is, we have too few of our own people. And it's not like every one of them is a standout. Once we spread them across the vast Mushroom Forest Plains, it will be even more of a problem..."

Yang Tianyou looked helpless. She frowned, a simple expression that her beauty made all the more charming. "My family is small... I've brought everyone I could. Our other territories are also busy; I can't just leave everyone in this one place..."

Her tone shifted as a hopeful look entered her eyes. "But there are so many cultivators back at the lake, and all of them are capable. Could you... borrow a few reliable people from your family? They don't need to be at the Foundation Establishment Realm. A few at the Qi Refining level would be enough. What we're missing are people we can trust."

Li Jiangliang instantly looked awkward.

He truly didn't want to ask for people from the lake. It wasn't that he thought they'd refuse—his cousin Li Que'wan, who managed clan affairs, and his second brother, Li Jianglong, would certainly help him. But all his siblings were contributing to the family. He wasn't just failing to contribute; he was now asking the family for a handout! Worse, it wasn't even for his own cultivation; it was a favor for someone else. The situation was mortifying.

"Well..." he stammered.

He was silently trying to figure out how to respond when he looked up. They had reached the prefecture's bustling market square. As his eyes swept casually over the noisy crowd, the jade talisman at his waist suddenly grew warm. His expression froze, his features warring with a mixture of disbelief and delight.

Li Jiangliang's gaze shot through the crowd. There, standing by a stall with his hands clasped behind his back, was a man in crimson robes. He was tall and slender, with striking features that gave him an exceptional air, setting him apart from the crowd. His eyes, though smiling, were set close to his brows, giving him a venomous look. They were slightly narrowed, and his pupils... his pupils were a brilliant, glittering gold.

The man seemed to turn his head casually, and flashed him a radiant smile.

Li Jiangliang turned to look at Yang Tianyou, who was still watching him with that hopeful, smiling expression. His heart sank. He sighed.

"You'er... come and meet my Eldest Brother."
