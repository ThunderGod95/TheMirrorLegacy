# Chapter 356: Conclusion

As soon as Li Yuanjiao put away the jade seal, he caught sight of a stream of light rising in the distance, quickly approaching them. A man and a woman were riding a flying shuttle and soon landed nearby. Several Azure Pond Sect disciples rose on their flying shuttles promptly, forming hand seals as they shouted in unison, "The Azure Pond Cloudliner is here, who goes there?"

The woman, riding the flying shuttle, furrowed her brows but did not stop. She bypassed the disciples, and the spells they cast were futile as they were blocked by a few talismans she threw out, causing them to fall heavily to the ground.

These disciples were outer disciples of the Azure Pond Sect, only slightly higher in status than attendants, and were all at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. The woman managed to barge through them, panting as she landed beside Li Yuanjiao.

"Brother!" she urgently called out.

"Qingxiao?!"

Li Yuanjiao was taken aback, greatly shocked. The female cultivator before him, her face slightly flushed, was none other than Li Qingxiao. She was only at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, yet she stood behind him with her hand on her sword, watching the others intently.

Li Yuanjiao, understanding that Li Qingxiao had come to support him, felt deeply moved but also slightly angered. He whispered sharply, "Why are you so reckless?!"

A man at the back hurriedly stepped forward, pulling Li Qingxiao behind him, and awkwardly cleared his throat before speaking in an apologetic tone.

"Xiao Xian of the Xiao Family greets the immortal sect's Emissary. My wife does not understand the rules and has been disrespectful… I hope you can forgive us."

"No matter." Yu Muxian's gaze lingered briefly on Li Qingxiao and Xiao Xian before continuing, "I will not hold you here any longer. Feel free to go about your business!"

"Thank you, Emissary. Yuanjiao shall take his leave now," Li Yuanjiao replied as he discreetly glanced at Yu Muxian's robe. Li Qingxiao seemed bewildered and was about to say something but closed her mouth obediently after receiving a stern look from Li Yuanjiao.

The Li Family members, feeling as if they had received a pardon, quickly flew off. Li Qingxiao and Xiao Xian, unable to fly since they were not Qi Cultivators, followed on their flying shuttle.

After traveling a few li, Li Qingxiao complained, "Brother, how could you keep such a huge matter from me?! I only heard about it from home. Did Yu Muxian… give our family any trouble?"

"No, he did not." Li Yuanjiao shook his head and explained the situation to her briefly. Then, he turned to Xiao Xian and cupped his fist. "I apologize for my younger sister's ignorance!"

"No apologies needed!" Xiao Xian hurriedly replied, waving his hands.

"I am only an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator without much ability and rely on Xiao Family's influence. This was not only Qingxiao's impulsive decision; I've considered it as well."

Seeing Xiao Xian speaking up for Li Qingxiao, Li Yuanjiao thought more highly of him. Li Qingxiao, ignoring the politeness between the two men, nodded thoughtfully and said, "I heard Yu Muxian is the precious son-in-law of Daoist Master Yuanwu and usually does not involve himself with the Yu Family. From what I have seen, he seems quite unkind and unloyal…"

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly, distracted as he was still thinking about the jade buckle. Xiao Xian hesitated briefly before speaking in a low voice, "Not necessarily… I have a clan uncle who was close to the Yu Family. He mentioned knowing the younger generation of the Yu Family."

Feeling it was awkward to speak about the Xiao Family's past attempts to support the Yu Family, Xiao Xian reluctantly continued as both Li Qingxiao and Li Yuanjiao were looking at him expectantly.

"My clan uncle once said that the Yu Family has four successors! Yu Mugao is thoughtful and resourceful, Yu Muyuan is bright and courageous, Yu Mujian is pure-hearted, and Yu Muxian is gentle and generous… If Yu Muxian leads, with Mugao, Muyuan, and Mujian as his supporters, they will shine for generations. No one could oppose them."

He paused, feeling somewhat embarrassed. Now that Yu Muyuan was dead, Yu Muxian was heartless, and Yu Mujian had left the family, only Yu Mugao was left struggling to support the family. Xiao Xian could not help but think to himself, Clan Uncle said it with such confidence... no wonder he has not returned home for years. He must be afraid of becoming a laughing stock.

While he pondered silently, he spoke, "Judging by those words, Yu Muxian should not be this heartless."

Li Qingxiao looked thoughtfu as she said, "Who knows? Perhaps he feels he cannot afford not to be heartless, to gain others' trust, or maybe..."

Her voice became soft and eerie as she continued, "Perhaps Tang Yuanwu has cast some divine ability on him, planted some spell in his mind… I have heard that the Purple Mansion Realm's divine abilities are the most sinister. It is possible that one of the old ancestors from the Azure Pond Sect has taken over his body."

With these words, both of them felt a chill down their spines. After a brief silence, Xiao Xian whispered, "He's a Daoist Master… Let us not call him by name so casually."

Tang Yuanwu had been a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator for many years. He founded Yuanwu Peak and then went into seclusion to cultivate a second divine ability, passing the position of peak master to his son.

Tang Yuanwu's son managed the peak for many years and reached the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. It was only a few years ago that he perished in an attempt to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, forcing Tang Yuanwu to come out of seclusion to take over once more.

Xiao Xian explained all this and added, "Yu Muxian also married Tang Yuanwu's daughter. He is quite famous in the sect, and it will not be long before he becomes the master of Yuanwu Peak."

Li Yuanjiao finally realized why Yu Muxian was so eager to stabilize the situation around the lake—it was all to prepare for his ascension to peak master. He nodded slowly as it all came together in his mind. The group landed before the Li Family's mountain, where Li Yuanping was already waiting in the courtyard.

"Borhter Ping!" Li Qingxiao called out.

Li Yuanping was momentarily stunned upon seeing her but then greeted her happily, "Sister Qingxiao!"

Li Qingxiao, having been married into the Xiao Family for several years, had grown accustomed to their ways. Despite her ordinary looks, her elegant attire made Li Yuanping take a moment to recognize her.

After a brief chat, she smiled and said, "I have not seen our parents in years. I will first take my husband to greet them, and then come down the mountain to discuss matters with Second Brother."

"Of course," Li Yuanjiao responded with a tender smile as he nodded. After Li Qingxiao and her husband went up the mountain, he then hurried into the hall and asked in a low voice, "Has there been any unusual activity at home?"

Li Yuanping nodded calmly and replied, "Ximing, Xizhi, and Xijun all had visions. When I asked them carefully, they all described seeing a man in white holding a jade buckle."

Originally, Li Ximing had been cultivating in Lijing Town under Li Yuanping's watch. With Li Xizhi preparing to enter the Azure Pond Sect, he had been spending more time with their mother. Li Yuanping had already called the children back and hidden them on the mountain.

Li Yuanping himself had not received any talismans and thus felt nothing significant. However, Li Yuanjiao had felt it profoundly. He shook his head and said gravely, "This is... caused by the immortal mirror. Up the mountain we go!"

On Mount Lijing...

The two men quickly undid the layers of protective formations and strode into the courtyard. The garden was lush and vibrant, bathed in golden sunlight, exuding a sense of vitality.

They hurried to the ancestral hall, pushing open the thick stone door. Immediately, a burst of white qi current rushed out, forcing them to step back as a chilling sensation enveloped their bodies.

The mist swirled in the courtyard, causing leaves and flowers to fall. The green branches turned yellow and withered, creating a cascade of dead leaves. In an instant, the once spring-like courtyard moments before had turned into an autumn scene, filled with a chilling atmosphere.

Li Yuanjiao stepped into the secret chamber and saw five or six small osmanthus trees that had sprouted within. Snow-white jade rabbits and yellow-green toads hopped around on the ground, filling him with astonishment.

The ground was covered with fallen osmanthus flowers, and white moonlight mist spread everywhere. A bluish-gray mirror floated in the air, emitting ribbons of bright light, exuding an impressive aura.

"This is..."

Li Yuanjiao carefully stepped around the hopping toads and rabbits on the ground, approaching the stone platform. He greeted respectfully, "Descendant of the Li Family greets the immortal mirror!"

Whether it was his words or the gradual departure of the Dawn Cloudliner returning to the Azure Pond Sect in the south, the light on the mirror gradually dimmed but remained dazzling.

Li Yuanping, only at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, could not withstand the aura and dared not enter the chamber until the light had faded slightly. Even then, he felt the cold biting into his bones.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the various phenomena in the dark chamber exploded, transforming into thick moonlight, resembling wisps of pure white mist. They swirled rapidly around Li Yuanjiao, who was kneeling in the center. Before him, the mist condensed into a jade buckle.

Li Yuanjiao kneeled before the stone platform, watching the moonlight coalesce into the clear jade buckle. With a solemn expression, he said, "Li Yuanjiao, a descendant of the Li Family, has received the command..."

The radiance slowly receded and the mirror reverted to its dull, gray state. The moonlight flowed back into the mirror from the stone platform. Li Yuanjiao bowed once more before standing up slowly.

The two brothers exited the dark chamber, the stone door closing silently behind them. Li Yuanping then said gravely, "Brother, Yu Muxian is a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, and a member of the Azure Pond Sect at that... We must plan carefully."

"I understand," Li Yuanjiao replied, narrowing his eyes. He continued in a low voice, "Besides, it seems Yu Muxian has also benefited from that jade buckle. He constantly keeps it hidden in his sleeve, often rubbing it subconsciously... His remarkable achievements and rapid cultivation on Yuanwu Peak must be linked to this treasure."

"That makes it even harder!" Li Yuanping exclaimed in exasperation as he shook his head and said seriously, "First, we should send Xizhi into the sect to gather information. As long as the jade buckle remains with Yu Muxian, we can eventually find a way to get our hands on it."

Nodding, Li Yuanjiao left the courtyard with his brother. Li Yuanping continued, "Regarding the matter of the Golden Yang Radiant Origin, this is of great importance and concerns our future path. It will take considerable time and effort. We need a reliable and capable Qi Cultivator to collect the qi."

"Are you suggesting...?" Li Yuanjiao's voice trailed off as his mind conjured up a name. He exchanged a glance with his brother and asked, "Uncle Chen Donghe?!"

"Exactly!" Li Yuanping pursed his lips and continued, "To the west of Moongaze Lake lies the territory of the Golden Feather Sect, with several deserts... We can send someone to search that area. If there is no pass that stretches a thousand li, we may have to head north."

"Go ahead and make the arrangements," Li Yuanjiao responded, fully trusting Li Yuanping. When he noticed Li Yuanping's pale complexion, he frowned and asked, "Why do you look so frail? There are many family matters to handle... Let Xicheng get some practice. Use more spirit herbs and do not strain yourself."

"Heh." Li Yuanping shook his head and replied, "My body is inherently flawed, like a leaking jar. No amount of spirit herbs will help. Maintaining my current cultivation without regression has already consumed many resources."

As they spoke, they arrived at a small courtyard at the foot of the mountain, taking seats one after the other. Li Yuanping waved his hand to shift the topic away from himself and continued, "Speaking of Xicheng... he is soft-hearted and indecisive, popular among the younger generation, but not fit to manage the household. A few days ago, I gave him some tasks, but he was indecisive and was easily swayed by others' opinions. I had to send him to Mount Yue to manage the Spirit Paddies."

Although Li Yuanjiao trusted him, Li Yuanping made sure to explain the situation to avoid any misunderstanding, lest his brother thought he was mistreating the eldest son of the second lineage.

Li Yuanjiao, holding a cup of tea, replied, "It is not a big deal. I see Xijun is clever. Both he and Ximing show great promise. We should not be too hard on Xicheng."

Li Yuanjiao, once fierce and bloodthirsty, had mellowed significantly after enduring the deaths of his older brother and granduncle.

Placing his cup down, he recounted Yu Muxian's visit in detail. Li Yuanping sighed, "Now that a Fei Family disciple has entered Yuanwu Peak, they are at least a junior fellow of Yu Muxian, possibly even his disciple. They will find it hard to align with us as before..."

"More than that..." Li Yuanjiao shook his head and was about to respond when he was interrupted by a well-dressed woman entering the courtyard.

She greeted warmly, "Brother, Yuanping."

Li Qingxiao had just ascended the mountain, meeting a few from the Yuan generation. When she asked about the family's situation, Li Yuanping explained everything in detail, speaking softly, "The family has been doing well these past few years... The ancestor has also gained some insights and is in seclusion for cultivation. You do not need to worry."

"All right..." Li Qingxiao's eyes were slightly red, showing a hint of reluctance. She spoke softly, "My husband has finished his duties in the clan over the past few years. We planned to return to Mount Yu, but when I heard about this, I hurried over. I cannot stay long and have to quickly bid farewell to our parents."

"Mount Yu is quite far from Moongaze Lake. If anything happens at home, it will be difficult to return promptly," she explained, then kneeled and bowed deeply.

"I must trouble Big Brother and Brother Ping to take care of my parents. Qingxiao is forever grateful!" she said.

"Just go without worries..." Li Yuanjiao said as he turned to the side, refusing her formalities. He shook his head slightly and continued in a low voice, "Focus on assisting your husband on Mount Yu. Do not worry about family matters to avoid unnecessary gossip. In a few years, when you have children, bring them back to see me."

"Yes!" Li Qingxiao responded gently and left with Xiao Xian on their flying shuttles.

Li Yuanjiao then turned to Li Yuanping and said, "Soon, I will return to Mount Wutu for seclusion. By then, Qinghong should also be out of seclusion. While she stabilizes her newfound power, you may approach her for any issues."

"Understood..." Li Yuanping responded, watching Li Yuanjiao calculate the time.

Li Yuanjiao then spoke in a serious tone, "Inform Qinghong that three months from now, on the Earth Pig day, wait in the mountain together. I will come home then."

Translator Note: What is Earth Pig Day (Ji Hai Day)?

The Chinese calendar uses a 60-year cycle called the sexagenary cycle, which combines two sets of symbols: the 10 Heavenly Stems (like a set of numbers) and the 12 Earthly Branches (like a set of letters).

Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches:

Heavenly Stems: These are like numbers from 1 to 10 (Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin, Ren, Gui).

Earthly Branches: These are like letters from A to L (Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Wu, Wei, Shen, You, Xu, Hai).

The cycle combines one stem with one branch to create 60 unique pairs, like "1A," "2B," etc.

Ji is the sixth stem, and Hai is the twelfth branch.

Hence, Ji-Hai (Earth Pig) Day is one specific combination in this 60-pair cycle. It represents a specific day in this cycle, which repeats every 60 days.

TLDR: "Ji-Hai Day" is like a special code or name for a specific day in a traditional Chinese 60-day calendar cycle, similar to how we have names for the days of the week. This cycle repeats every 60 days. We don't really use this system anymore in the modern day.

Example:

Li Yuanping was momentarily puzzled, not understanding the significance of the date. The annual sacrificial ceremony was in winter, which was far from that date. Unable to contain his curiosity, he asked, "What is this about...?"

"It has been five years..."

Li Yuanjiao sighed deeply, his lips barely moving as he used his mana to transmit his voice to Li Yuanping's ear, "It has been five years since the ancestor's life jade broke. Following his instructions, we should open the entrance to Meiche cave dwelling to welcome his immortal remains."
