# Chapter 1170: Intercalary Yin

When Li Ximing heard this, he finally understood. He praised the idea internally.

'So that's the plan. He wants to resolve everything at once, without having to petition two different families.'

Ji'an’s plan was, in a word, perfect. Li Ximing’s mastery of the pill Dao was renowned not only on the mainland but throughout the Eastern Sea as well, placing him among the foremost alchemists in the world. Furthermore, the Li Fire and Bright Yang lineages were closely related. Since Li Fire cultivators could not refine pills themselves, who better to turn to than a Bright Yang master like him?

He smiled and asked, “Senior, do you have a pill formula on hand?”

Apprehension still lingered in Ji'an’s eyes. He pressed his hands together and said,

“I have a few, but they are merely scattered formulas, none of which are worthy of such a spiritual fruit… In my view, its medicinal properties must not be broken apart. They must be fused into a single Mystic Pill!”

Li Ximing had expected as much. Li Jiangqian, however, began to laugh.

“So, Daoist Master, you’ve traded a fire and an instrument for one of our family's cultivation arts, and now you wish to trade the Parting Si Apricot Fruit for our Dao Lineage. But whether it’s the life-mandate induction art or the Li-Light wondrous method, how could they be worth only a single spiritual object? The life-mandate induction art, in particular, is noble and profound. For an elder senior such as yourself seeking to transcend the Purple Mystery, it would be an invaluable reference.”

Li Jiangqian still felt the offer was insufficient, but his words were pleasant, prompting Ji'an to reconsider. The newly ascended Daoist Master continued,

“How about this, my family will keep the Li-Light wondrous method for ourselves and provide you only with the life-mandate induction art. This will satisfy our desire to keep something of our Dao Lineage private.”

Ji'an didn’t particularly care how many techniques he received in the exchange, so he breathed a sigh of relief and agreed. But just as the young man before him relented on one point, he immediately seized upon another.

“Pill refinement, however, is a different matter entirely. There are the monarch, minister, assistant, and envoy ingredients—countless spiritual resources that you will still need to provide. Not to mention, since this will be a great pill, the labor will be even more taxing on my family’s elder…”

Li Jiangqian’s words were veiled, but he was alluding to a common practice in alchemy—a refiner would typically keep one or two pills from a successful batch. Since this was to be a single, unique Mystic Pill, there would be no extras to take.

At his advanced age, Ji'an naturally understood the implication. His eyes burned brightly, and rather than being alarmed, he seemed almost pleased.

“If you can truly forge a Mystic Pill, I will certainly not be stingy with my gratitude!”

A faint smile touched Li Jiangqian’s lips.

“There’s an old saying: a well-fed guard is a loyal guard. Since you’ve given me the Parting Si Apricot Fruit, there will be many times in the future when we will need your experience. A favor is a favor, but this should also put your mind at ease.”

Ji'an looked up, a hint of surprise in his eyes. He glanced at Li Jiangqian, marveling inwardly as he understood the young man’s meaning.

If they truly wanted to be unscrupulous, the Li family could easily tamper with the pill. They could secretly refine the spiritual fruit into a mother-son pill, keeping the smaller one for themselves and using the larger one to deceive him. Forging all the spiritual ingredients into a single pill was incredibly difficult; splitting them into two would actually be easier.

If their methods were flawless, he would never know the difference. With Li Ximing’s superb alchemy skills and a host of supplementary ingredients, Ji'an likely wouldn’t even be able to tell the difference after consuming it.

Li Ximing himself hadn’t even considered such a scheme, but Li Jiangqian had been the Family Head for a long time. He was well-versed in all the dirty tricks exchanged between rogue cultivators and clans. He handled the situation with practiced ease, pointing out the potential for deceit with a smile.

Ji'an feared entanglement with karma in Jiangnan and likely wouldn’t be able to personally oversee the pill’s creation. He would rather the other party ask for more upfront than have the single remaining chance in his life ruined by their greed. Hearing Li Jiangqian address this suspicion directly, and also hint at using him as a reference for a future breakthrough to the Purple Mystery, all of Ji'an’s doubts vanished.

“With how your clan conducts its affairs… I can be completely at ease!” he praised.

Li Jiangqian smiled without a word. Though he had only just reached the Purple Mansion Realm, he needed no grand oaths. He had already gained the upper hand in their negotiation. Ji'an stroked his beard and nodded, willingly conceding.

“I have also spoken plainly with His Highness. I will naturally be the one to find the supplementary ingredients for this furnace… I have already made some preparations. It may well empty my life’s savings, but even though I have lived this long in vain, I still have some connections. I should be able to gather two or three sets of the spiritual resources to offer as payment.”

Li Jiangqian lowered his gaze slightly, calculating how much more he could squeeze from the old man. Li Ximing, however, was observing Che Hong’s attitude. He put down his cup and sent a telepathic message.

'The grand formation west of Ting Province must be established, and it requires spiritual resources. We might as well agree. It can be considered giving face to the Chunyi Dao Gate… After all, if he transcends the Purple Mystery, he’ll be a Great Daoist Master.'

After this quiet persuasion from Li Ximing, Li Jiangqian put on a show of sighing deeply. He looked at Ji'an and said,

“Since we share the same Dao Lineage, I will treat you as a fellow sect member. There will be much I need to ask of you in the future… Please allow me to impose upon you then!”

Hearing that the Li family had agreed, Ji'an was overjoyed. He thanked them twice before his expression turned serious.

“From now on, I will be a guest at Chunyi. Changli, feel free to seek me out whenever you wish!”

With an agreement reached, the old man’s face broke into a wide smile, the wrinkles crinkling with joy. He placed the Crimson Gold Hundred-Turn Spear on its box and pushed them both forward.

“My spiritual fires were originally stored at my old sect on Mount Pai'er. Who would have thought that while I was away, the spiritual atmosphere in Cang Province shifted, causing a great flood that damaged two of my spiritual fires. It has taken until today for them to recover!”

The old man did not leave immediately. Li Jiangqian chuckled, then produced a blank jade slip. His spiritual sense converged within it, and strands of Li-Light gathered upon its surface, turning it as red as fire. He handed it to Ji'an.

“Please.”

Ji'an nodded repeatedly, accepting it with both hands. He closed his eyes and began to read with ravenous intensity. After a long moment, his eyes filled with shock. He let out a long breath and sighed,

“Truly wondrous! Truly wondrous…”

He had only heard Li Jiangqian claim it was comparable to the ultimate treasures of an immortal sect and had assumed it was an exaggeration. He never imagined that every word would be so exquisite, far surpassing his own former techniques. Joy filled Ji'an’s heart.

'Good… There wasn’t a single false word…'

As his spiritual sense withdrew, the Li Fire clinging to the jade slip began to flare, shattering the slip into pieces. In a slight daze, Ji'an stepped into the Great Void, leaving a single sentence hanging over the Jade Terrace.

“Please wait a moment!”

As the old man hurried away, Che Hong finally spoke.

“Many thanks to both Daoist Masters for making this possible!”

He was already holding a jade slip. He presented it to Li Ximing with a solemn expression.

“These are three types of disaster-averting pill formulas from the Cold Night Woven Jade Pill Scripture that can be refined by outsiders. Please, Daoist Master, take a look!”

Che Hong hadn’t even stated his request, which put Li Ximing in an awkward position. He felt he couldn’t accept it, but couldn’t refuse it either.

"It would be improper to take your esteemed sect’s precious methods for nothing…” he said politely.

Che Hong’s expression was one of resignation.

“You’re too kind, Daoist Master. While this pill scripture is indeed precious, in the past several hundred years, it has been used for refinement no more than ten times. Even fewer cultivators have come to borrow it… Please, read it first… we can discuss compensation later.”

Li Ximing had no choice but to accept the jade slip and close his eyes to read.

The three pills were the Azure Step Flawless Pill, which used Yin-Leap Qi as its monarch herb; the Mystic Shore Spirit-Guiding Pill, which used Shore Ya Moon Treasure as its monarch herb; and the Yin Solemn Treasure Body Powder, which used Deep Night Solemn Qi as its monarch herb.

Not only had he never heard of these monarch herbs, but the various techniques and keys within the formulas were exceedingly difficult. Taking the easiest of them, the Yin Solemn Treasure Body Powder, as an example, its difficulty was on par with the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill of years past.

Seeing Li Ximing deep in thought, Che Hong sighed.

“In this day and age, it’s difficult enough to find a single Supreme Yang or Supreme Yin spiritual resource, let alone the specific ones required by these formulas!”

Li Ximing opened his eyes, his expression complicated.

“Is there no other way?” he asked tentatively.

Che Hong paused, choosing his words carefully.

“You should be aware of the Clear Yin Womb Herb… This item has the wondrous ability to generate all things. Its lower-body aspects form Valley Water, while its upper aspects form Supreme Yin. My sect possesses a secret art called the Elucidating Profundity Bestowed Jade Method, which can transform it into one of these three spiritual items for you!”

Although he said this, he didn't hold out much hope. If it weren't for the fact that Ting Province was backed by the fox clan, making it highly likely that Supreme Yin spiritual items remained, he wouldn’t have even brought it up. He could have just told Li Ximing the names of the monarch herbs and let him retreat in the face of such difficulty.

As expected, a troubled look appeared on Li Ximing’s face. Li Jiangqian, who had been listening all this time, felt a stir in his heart.

'The Elucidating Profundity Bestowed Jade Method, a transmuting art…'

As his eyes filled with contemplation, Li Ximing had already made up his mind. He cupped his hands and said,

“I will inquire about these spiritual items… but your esteemed sect has studied the Supreme Yin for many years. Do you have any spiritual items or resources that could serve as substitutes?”

Che Hong hesitated.

“Yes, our sect does have access to a few sources of Supreme Yin resources, as well as several types of spiritual qi. However, we have none in our vaults at present. I can try to find some for you…”

Li Ximing had previously obtained Nightshade Spirit Grass from the Chunyi Dao Gate, which he had sent to the Qusi long ago when forging the halberd for Li Zhouwei. He also needed several Supreme Yin resources as assistant ingredients. With the favor from Ji'an, he felt at ease accepting the offer and fell silent, pondering.

Li Jiangqian waited a moment. Seeing that the two had finished their discussion, he tentatively asked,

“The Elucidating Profundity Bestowed Jade Method… to think such a wondrous art exists, capable of such simple transmutation. When I look upon the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, it is like gazing up at a great mountain!”

Although the Supreme Yang had lost its luster in the current age, Che Hong still smiled and nodded at the compliment.

“The ancient era was filled with countless wondrous arts and techniques. To obtain even a fraction of one is to possess incredible power. It is a pity our sect only obtained this single art. I have heard that there is a corresponding art in the Immortal Mansion called the Elucidating Transformation Na Yuan Intercalary Method. It can harmonize all waters, allowing one type of water virtue to transform into another… The wonders within are beyond words!”

Hearing this, Li Jiangqian felt a jolt. Even Li Ximing, who had only caught fragments of the conversation, looked up. A strange feeling bloomed in both their hearts.

'To change one type of water virtue into another… this is…'

'The Intercalary Sun Art?!'

The Li family ancestor had obtained that art from Daoist Master Junjian. It was a wondrous technique for converting one type of fire virtue into another, and they had benefited from it immensely over the years, giving them many paths of retreat. As their family climbed step by step to the pinnacle, they came to realize just how terrifying the art was. Now, hearing of such a similar technique, how could they not feel a sense of dissonance?

'In that case, the art in the Immortal Mansion is… its counterpart, the Intercalary Yin Art?'

A tempest of thoughts raged in Li Jiangqian’s mind. He put on a look of amazement and asked,

“Such an immortal art actually exists! Could you elaborate on it?”

Che Hong paused for a second but found nothing strange in the request. What cultivator with divine abilities wouldn’t stop to ask about such an immortal art? He organized his thoughts and said,

“Its origins can no longer be traced, but it is said to be a secret art passed down within the ancient Three Profoundities. It’s unknown which of the Profound Heads first passed it down, but it spread through exchanges between their Dao Lineages…”

He chuckled, then added pointedly,

“Of course, this 'spread' was only among the direct lineages of the Three Profoundities. They used it to convert spiritual items and practice special techniques. Some say it contains the great Dao of intercalation and surplus; others say it holds the wondrous art of weaving jade and concentrating radiance. Even… True Monarch Chilang of the Heavenly Lang Terrace once revealed during a sermon that it ‘contains the Dao of derivation and the power of transmutation. To master eighty or ninety percent of it is to shed the shell of immortal or god and enter the gate of the true beginning.’”

Li Ximing was silent for a long time before he murmured,

“Shed the shell of immortal or god… Cultivators in this age flock to nothing more than becoming an immortal, attaining the Dao, and taking a golden position. Is being an immortal or a god still not enough?”

Accustomed to reading ancient texts, Che Hong hadn't found it strange. But now that Li Ximing pointed it out, he too was taken aback. He chewed on the words for a moment before replying,

“In the ancient era, the concepts of intercalation and surplus were complete. What they called 'immortals and gods' were likely more than a single step away from the absolute peak.”

Li Jiangqian silently committed this to memory, but he was more focused on the practical applications of the Intercalary Yin Art and the Intercalary Sun Art. 

“You mentioned that this immortal art contains the great Dao of intercalation and surplus… I wonder whose theory that was, and which True Monarch achieved it?” he asked quietly.

Che Hong smiled.

“That can be considered a doctrine of my Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. As for achievements, they are countless. A famous example… would be the True Monarch with the Daoist name Chongli. He established the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion, which was the backer of the Chu State. Later, a descendant from the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion, with the Daoist name Nan Zhao, tried to walk his old path. Unfortunately, he failed just short of success…”

'Nan Zhao…'

Realization dawned instantly in Li Ximing’s mind.

The name was not unfamiliar. It belonged to the original owner of the Spiritual Treasure in Li Jiangqian’s hands, the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument. His secular name was Lu, and he had even left behind the Southern Li Ingestion Method within the treasure.

'His last words are within the Spiritual Treasure. He wished to turn the tide, to ascend to an auxiliary position of Li Fire to save the dire situation of the Encompassing Profoundity. It’s a pity he ultimately fell, leaving behind only a name and a single, regretful sentence passed down to this day…'

He merely felt a sense of melancholy, but Li Jiangqian seemed to have grasped something crucial. He silently clutched the Spiritual Treasure in his sleeve, which resembled a Golden Core, his expression deeply thoughtful.

'The position of Li Fire has a master. Without seeking the path of surplus or intercalation, one cannot forge a Golden Core!'

'With the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion’s legacy—the Southern Li Ingestion Method and the Intercalary Sun Art—in my hands, I already have the qualifications to investigate further. This is my opportunity… and it is very likely… the path I must walk in the future!'

He was lost in thought, but in a mere moment, the old man clad in crimson Li Fire robes had returned, stepping out of the Great Void and striding closer, his face beaming with joy.

“Daoist Masters! Please, look!”

In his palm rested a small incense burner. It was made of brass, depicting phoenixes vying for flames and inscribed with profound Daoist patterns. Inside, black sand was piled high. Though it was no bigger than his palm, the grains were fine and numerous, as if an entire black desert had been shrunk into the burner.

As he channeled his divine ability, a thumb-sized Li Fire bloomed within the censer. It was a unique, jade-like brownish-yellow, covered in dense, intricate patterns that gave it an exquisitely refined appearance.

Ji'an smiled.

“This is the Vast Desert Li Flame. I obtained it from the Feather-Shedding Land. It possesses an endlessly generating flame and an aura of boundless immensity. It cannot be used for alchemy or artifact refinement, but it holds a magnificent and righteous intent of both envelopment and destruction. In this day and age, it is truly a rare sight!”

“This flame is one of the few that does not fear Earth Virtue. So long as there is a flaw in an Earth Virtue, this flame will have a chance to surge forth. It is especially effective at suppressing the Manifestations Earth aspect of Earth Virtue!”
