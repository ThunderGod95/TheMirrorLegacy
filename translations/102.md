# Chapter 109: Exploration

Li Tongya soared into the air with the couple and flew out of the market, heading southward for several hours.

He was not afraid of a sneak attack or siege from these rogue cultivators. After all, the cultivation technique practiced by the rogue cultivators was only of Grade One quality, having consumed various unrefined qi.

Even if three or five rogue cultivators surrounded him, they would not be able to hold him back, especially with his superior River True Essence. Li Tongya decided to assess the situation when they arrived.

As they traveled, Li Tongya carefully discussed details with the couple. He discovered that the cave dwelling they sought was located on the south shore of Moongaze Lake, more than two hundred miles away from Lichuankou Village.

The twists of fate in this world are truly unpredictable. Our family has been farming the south shore for decades, yet we never stumbled upon this cave... Xu Yangping and his wife simply landed on this small continent in the lake for a rest, and by chance, they encountered this valuable discovery during the great drought.

While silently caught in his thoughts, Li Tongya spotted an ordinary-looking man seated on the jagged rocks ahead, with a long saber resting on his knees. He seemed to be meditating.

“Brother Zhang!” Xu Yangping landed and called out with a smile, cupping his fists.

The man turned to face Xu Yangping.

“This is Brother Zhang Yun, a Qi Cultivator who has attained the third heavenly layer and is quite knowledgeable about formations... he just arrived at Moongaze Lake a few days ago to visit the market and has kindly agreed to assist us,” Xu Yangping quickly explained.

Zhang Yun quickly got up and cupped his fist respectfully, silently observing Li Tongya’s River True Essence. Xu Yangping proceeded to introduce Li Tongya to him.

In return, Li Tongya cupped his fist in respect.

As he observed Zhang Yun’s bright and thorough true essence and listened to his claims of expertise in formations, Li Tongya secretly evaluated him.

I suspect this person isn’t just a rogue cultivator. There’s no Zhang Family in this region, and if he isn’t using a false name, he likely has connections to the three sects and seven gates.

While Li Tongya remained vigilant, Zhang Yun continued to explain patiently—though his excitement was evident.

He pointed toward the water beside the small continent.

“During your absence, I studied this cave dwelling... it appears to belong to a cultivator of the Foundation Establishment Realm, dating back at least two to three hundred years,” he explained.

Upon hearing this, Xu Yangping’s eyes lit up with excitement as he exclaimed, “That’s rare indeed!”

Zhang Yun nodded.

“I’ve heard that in ancient times, Moongaze Lake was known as the Great Moon Pool, spanning an area of three thousand miles and was abundant with Mountain Pool Spiritual Qi... in fact, this was where the Moonlight Origin Mansion used to be located. There were numerous cave dwellings, but as the landscape changed, the lake gradually dried up—leaving only the present Moongaze Lake,” he spoke, his eyes unreadable.

Unable to contain her curiosity, Lin Jingyi eagerly asked, “Do you know how to get us inside, Brother Zhang?”

“Of course.”

Zhang Yun nodded confidently. The group performed a series of hand seals and cast Water Avoidance Spell on themselves before stepping into the water, stopping at a break in the riverbed.

With a swift motion of his long saber, Zhang Yun revealed numerous patterns on the stone wall, followed by the emergence of a dazzling white formation.

Zhang Yun reacted quickly and performed another hand seal, shooting out three long and thin jade wedges, each nailing into the formation. With a strong tug, three long and thin glowing white chains materialized in his hands, each connected to the jade wedges.

“Take these, fellow Daoists,” he instructed as he tossed out two chains to the other two men with him. Together, they poured their mana into the jade wedges.

This guy really sure knows a thing or two...

Li Tongya felt as though he had broadened his horizon as he channeled his mana through his hand. He grew more convinced that Zhang Yun had an extraordinary background, and his presence here could possibly be calculated.

Li Tongya began meticulously scanning the surroundings around him, searching for potential escape routes.

With heightened caution, he made a conscious effort to conserve his mana. After a full day of channeling mana, they finally saw the silver formation begin to flicker as night fell. After a slow night, the formation finally shattered—revealing the dark abyss that was the entrance to the cave dwelling.

As a huge amount of lake water rushed in, they swiftly cast a few Water Avoidance Spells at the entrance to block it.

Standing before the dark entrance, the four hesitated. A silent exchange ensued, their eyes meeting in a moment of mutual hesitation. In each other's gazes, they discerned the same shade of uncertainty.

“Shall I go first?” Zhang Yun offered, brandishing a light yellow wooden shield from his storage bag.

Xu Yangping looked at the dharma weapon in his hand from behind him, then followed silently behind Li Tongya with a serious look on his face.

After only a few steps into the cave, a foul stench invaded their senses, immediately causing the couple to gag. Li Tongya, who had been holding his breath since entering the cave remained unaffected and unfazed.

He silently glanced at Xu Yangping, and the two immediately recognized the vigilant look in each other’s eyes. Their true essences surged, poised for action at a moment's notice.

Xu Yangping seems to have doubts about Zhang Yun’s true intentions... if he was indeed working with Zhang Yun to deceive me, he wouldn’t get Lin Jingyi involved in the first place. Looks like he has sensed that something must be off, hence becoming on guard.

As if in response to his thoughts, Xu Yangping’s voice echoed in Li Tongya’s mind. It was transmitted through his spiritual sense and his voice was tinged with apprehension.

“Brother Li, I fear this man may not be an ordinary rogue cultivator. Jingyi and I must have misjudged him... I fear this won’t end well for us.”

Zhang Yun surveyed the cave dwelling ahead of them, the glow of the spell in his hand illuminating every corner of the cave.

Within the cavern, a wide space unfolded. At its center stood a towering crystal column, adorned with the coiled skeleton of a massive snake. Among the eerie white bones and fangs, a lone blood-red orb was suspended inside its jaws.

The orb hovered gently, emitting a faint crimson light that contrasted starkly against the pristine white lance embedded in the ground—its silver gleam casting an ethereal glow throughout the cave.

The spiritual qi within the cave dwelling was as rich as in the cave dwelling on Mount Meiche. This cavern, spanning several acres, seemed to stretch endlessly into the depths, its atmosphere tinged with an overwhelming yin qi.

“Oh, it seems we’ve stumbled upon a demon general’s lair!” Zhang Yun exclaimed, kicking aside decayed bones before turning back to address Li Tongya and the couple with disappointment.

“I thought this would be a cave dwelling that belonged to a cultivator of the Foundation Establishment Realm... but it seems like it belongs to a serpent demon instead!”

Xu Yangping and the others shared in Zhang Yun’s disappointment. Demons of Foundation Establishment Realm have taken form, and often possess knowledge in formations and alchemy. However, demons were notorious for their lack of inheritance, preferring to consume spirit items rather than passing them down to others... This meant that there would not be much left for them to discover.

“There were countless little snakes in this cave, but all of them have been preyed upon by the demon and turned into sustenance for its cultivation,” Zhang Yun remarked as they navigated through the labyrinth of snake remains.

The group explored the entirety of the cave. All of the remains, bones, and ashes in there belonged to either humans or animals—their belongings, including their storage pouches, had vanished.

“Hmm?” Zhang Yun muttered as he scanned the surroundings with his spiritual sense. From the ashes, two jade slips emerged. After a brief inspection of them, he tossed them aside in disappointment.

“What a poor demon... it must have exchanged all its treasures into spirit items and spirit elixirs to aid in breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm... the jade slips have been sealed. Since the demon couldn’t sell them, they were left here buried in the ashes,” Zhang Yun explained as he turned around to face his companions.

He chuckled and continued, “The Purple Mansion Realm is no easy feat to achieve!”

“What are the contents of those two jade slips, Brother Zhang?” Xu Yangping asked inquisitively as he cupped his fist in respect.

Zhang Yun shot him a glance before replying.

“One of them is the Blood Dharma Manual from my sect—the Golden Feather Sect—while the other is the long-lost River Mountain Sutra of the Lingyu Gate after it was destroyed. You’ll need the secret seal of the Golden Feather Sect to unlock the first one, and a secret technique to unlock the other one... both of you should just give up on them.”

Xu Yangping exchanged dismayed glances with his wife as Li Tongya withdrew to a safer area, his hand tightening around the hilt of his sword. Faint glimmers of white light were prancing around it, hinting at the latent power of the Celestial Moon Slash technique that was ready to be unleashed at any given moment.

“Do not be so alarmed, Brother Xiao.”

Zhang Yun said as he smiled at Li Tongya, carefully eyeing his sword that was already humming with power in its sheath.

“I’m familiar with the River One Qi Technique of the Xiao Family... it was my father who personally bestowed it upon them.”

Li Tongya’s face betrayed a look of surprise before he quickly masked it with a quick regain of his composure.

“Is your purpose here solely to retrieve the Blood Dharma Manual, Brother Zhang?” he asked, an eyebrow arched.

“Not really...”

Zhang Yun's expression faltered slightly. “Actually, I was sent by my master to search for a cave dwelling... I had no idea Brother Xiao was seeking the River Mountain Sutra. My intrusion was unintentional!” he explained.

Li Tongya was taken aback by this revelation, his mind racing. His expression betrayed his feelings of unease.

“I spent over a decade searching for the whereabouts of this cave dwelling, I never anticipated being preempted by this couple... when I saw Brother Zhang, I assumed it was because your sect also had an interest in this item,” he interjected.

Zhang Yun waved his hands dismissively.

“Nonsense! With the bond between our families, how could the Golden Feather Sect harbor any desire for the River Mountain Sutra?”

Xu Yangping and his wife were left bewildered by the conversation. Caught between the conflicting agendas of two powerful factions, they felt trapped, perspiration beading on their brows as they realized they had unwittingly stumbled into a dangerous situation.

Damn it, Li Tongya is also a disciple of a sect. Now, we’ve become pawns in their game!

The couple silently edged backward, ready to make a hasty escape. However, their small movements caught Zhang Yun’s attention, prompting him to turn and fix them with a sly smile.

“I’ll deal with Brother Xiao’s problem first!” Zhang Yun exclaimed with a laugh as he swung his blade toward Xu Yangping. Xu Yangping’s hair stood on end as he quickly grabbed Lin Jingyi and made an attempt to retreat.

Unfortunately for him, Zhang Yun had practiced at least the Grade Three cultivation method and had consumed pure Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth.

Although Xu Yangping had attained the Qi Cultivation Realm, he practiced common cultivation methods. Since he possessed no decent qi gathering method, he had consumed various unrefined qi. It was no surprise that he was no match for Zhang Yun’s prowess.

In a swift and ruthless display like Li Tongya when he murdered the Qi Cultivator of the Ji Family back then, Zhang Yun decapitated Xu Yangping with a series of slashes, ignoring Lin Jingyi’s pleas for mercy. He soon turned his attention to her and with another slash, she fell to the ground, lifeless.

“These rogue cultivators are truly worthless,” Zhang Yun sneered as he turned around.

Although Li Tongya’s face remained composed, Zhang Yun’s actions chilled Li Tongya to the bone. As Zhang Yun silently picked up the couple’s storage pouches, Li Tongya could not help but reflect on the power held by the three sects and seven gates in the world of immortal cultivation.

Without the authentic technique Jing’er brought home from the sect, I could have been killed by someone else, like these two rogue cultivators.

Zhang Yun suddenly turned toward Li Tongya with a proposition. “I guess the cultivation method is settled. As for these inner core and dharma artifacts... who’s going to pick first...?”

Without waiting for a response from Li Tongya, a cruel sparkle lit up his eyes.

“Why don’t we settle this with a duel?! Saber against sword, winner takes the pick of the loot!” he exclaimed.

Li Tongya had seen Zhang Yun’s skill when he decapitated Xu Yangping earlier and was aware that Zhang Yun’s techniques were not any superior to his Profound Water Sword Technique and River One Qi Technique. Besides, he also had the Celestial Moon Slash technique which was packed with explosive power.

I mustn’t back down at this moment!

With a confident smirk, he drew his sword, unleashing a burst of white light that had been contained in his sheath.

“Sounds good!” he replied with a dangerous smile.

As soon as he drew his sword, a white sword qi flew toward Zhang Yun, causing him to cry out in alarm and surprise.

“Hey, that’s cheating!” he exclaimed.

However, he was able to react fast enough, releasing the saber qi he had been storing for quite some time. It clashed against the sword qi, creating a thunderous noise that caused their clothing to flutter and rustle loudly.

Li Tongya staggered slightly under the force of the impact but managed to dissipate it quickly. Zhang Yun, however, remained steadfast despite taking a direct hit. He stifled a grunt, indicating that he had sustained minor internal injuries.

Nevertheless, he chuckled.

“You’ve backed off! Take your cultivation method... and I’ll take the peak Foundation Establishment Realm demon’s inner core. You can have this dharma weapon of Foundation Establishment Ream.”

Reluctant to argue further, Li Tongya simply nodded.

“Fine, my mission is already complete as long as I can retrieve this cultivation method for my elder anyway,” he replied with a shrug of his shoulders.

Both of them then collected their items before exiting the cave.

“That sword technique of yours is quite impressive!”

Li Tongya was about to offer a modest response, but Zhang Yun quickly spoke again before he could respond.

“The Golden Feather Sect’s promise to the Daoist Master Chuting still stands... once that old fart, Chi Wei, dies, the Xiao Family will be backed up by the Golden Feather Sect... so please, give more consideration to the matter.”

Li Tongya was instantly stricken with horror as his mind reeled with the revelation.

Daoist Master Chuting?! Xiao Chuting has already attained the Purple Mansion Realm? No wonder the Golden Feather Sect treats the Xiao Family with such deference...

What’s that promise about? If Chi Wei, the old ancestor of the Azure Pond Sect, dies, the sect’s influence will likely diminish greatly. What schemes are the Xiao Family and the Golden Feather Sect plotting...?

Zhang Yun blinked and continued in a low voice, “Even if you’re not truly loyal to the Xiao Family... it doesn’t matter. With a few Foundation Establishment cultivators ready to unite, turmoil will inevitably ensue sooner or later.”

Li Tongya shook his head and chuckled.

“Brother Zhang, you jest.”

With a laugh, Zhang Yun patted his brocade pouch and departed on his flying shuttle, leaving Li Tongya to contemplate his words.

Wary that Zhang Yun was still around the vicinity, Li Tongya decided to sit and cultivate until nightfall. As darkness enveloped the land, he utilized the Qi Restraining Technique and flew toward Lixia Prefecture before circling back to the Li Residence.

However, as he flew over Mount Lijing, he noticed a sea of white below him. A sense of foreboding gripped him as he descended toward the mountain. The courtyard was decorated in white and he saw Li Xuanxuan clad in mourning attire.

“What happened?” he asked carefully.

Li Xuanxuan shivered. He could not even speak at the sight of Li Tongya and merely fell to his knees onto the ground. With trembling hands, Li Xuanxuan handed over the Ebony Bow and spoke.

“A few days ago, Chen Donghe and the others returned... saying that... that uncle... had been killed by a curse...” he choked out between sobs.

Li Tongya froze, and the joy from acquiring a new cultivation method and dharma artifact instantly dissipated. His fears and premonitions had finally been proven true.

“I understand,” he murmured softly before turning away to hide his emotions.

The two stood on the mountain for the longest time, each not saying a word. It took a while before Li Tongya broke the silence again.

“Go get the clothes he usually wore and bury them in the family mausoleum, alongside your grandfather and father.”

Li Xuanxuan nodded solemnly, and Li Tongya wiped away a tear before issuing another instruction.

“Make sure everything is done in proper order. Leave a space in the center for me.”

“Understood.”
