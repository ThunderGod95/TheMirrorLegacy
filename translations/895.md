# Chapter 895: The Sword that Pacified Three Heads

Sweat beaded on Guan Gongxiao's forehead. He was terrified, and he hurried to explain.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, we have already engaged them. Those Buddhist monks and Master Monks can neutralize my Dharma Arts. They often just shine a Buddhist light or a colored light, and it’s like pulling the foundation from a tall building. My arts collapse, dissipate, and I'm forced to bow... They are not easy to deal with."

"However, these fellows are vulnerable to dharma artifacts. Although their bodies are tough, they are unarmed. When it comes to a real fight... they aren't *too* difficult to handle."

Guan Gongxiao couldn't possibly be unaware of his own Daoist tradition's strengths and weaknesses. He probably knew long ago that the Capital Guard's methods were ill-suited for fighting Buddhist cultivators. Now that Li Ximing was asking, he was being very clear.

'Dharma Art nullification... I've never heard that Yehui possessed as many Dharma Arts as Changxiao. He just had a pair of Spiritual Artifacts on him that could create flames and lightning. The Capital Guard... it's often said their methods are those of ghosts, spirits, and mountain spirits. It's normal for them to be countered and suppressed by Buddhist techniques.'

As he finished speaking, the cultivators from the Capital immortals Dao had already approached, trembling with fear. At their head was the saber-wielding Gongsun Bofan. He came forward, bowed, and said respectfully.

"Greetings, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing glanced at him and asked:

"How is the Song family?"

Bringing up the Song family was really just asking about Song Yunbai. Among the Great One's lovers, she had the highest cultivation. Guan Gongxiao's expression dimmed, and he replied in a low voice.

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, she was already taken away by a Daoist Master. We did not see his face, but judging by his clothes and the clogs on his feet, we estimate... he is a cultivator from... Qize in the south of the Wu State."

The Song family were supporters of Capital immortals, but having a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator taken away without a sound was definitely not a good thing. It was just like the Fei family of Moongaze Lake; Fei Qingya, who wasn't even that important, had left, and Li Ximing had wanted to throw the entire Fei family into Tiger's Frontier. How could Song Yunbai, who was one of the Song family's primary decision-makers, be any different?

Furthermore, Qize was the largest marsh in the south, and most of the cultivators there lived under the shadow of Mount Changhuai. Only a few Daoist Masters and that one Sword Immortal, Duo Ling, were rogue cultivators. She had most likely attached herself to the Wu State's number one hegemon, Mount Changhuai!

'This Mount Changhuai is even stronger than the Golden Feather Sect... Geographically, it dominates its own corner of the world, calling itself the Changhuai Daoist tradition, and all its vassals treat Changhuai as the orthodox line. No wonder he's so nervous.'

Li Ximing, enjoying the drama, listened idly. Only then did he see several streams of light cut across the sky.

Leading them was naturally the current head of the Great Xiukui Monastery, Kui Qi. He had a long face and fine eyebrows, still wearing that same black robe, a black-cord dharma artifact tied at his waist. He carried the green-patina-mottled Great Concordance Kui Copper Sword.

With him was Tinglan, who had been in seclusion for many years healing her injuries. She looked to be in good spirits and was frowning as she spoke. Perhaps because the occasion was formal, she was no longer wearing her favorite autumn-yellow robe, but was instead dressed in purple, holding the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion.

Behind them, on one side, was Houfu, a cloth bag tied at his waist. He had dealings with Li Ximing overseas and nodded in greeting from a distance. On the other side was the gentle and beautiful Ning Wan, holding the Great Snow's Severing Edge.

These four were the Daoist Masters of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition who roamed Jiangnan. Not counting those who disliked or were unwilling to show themselves, these four alone could decide the fate of more than half of the Yue State.

At their side, Guan Gongxiao prostrated himself, not daring to look up. The cultivators around him nearly collapsed to the ground. Chiluo, who had been in the Great Void, had naturally fled long ago. Li Ximing casually instructed,

"Take your people and guard the west. When the fight starts in the south and the people on the lake move north, you will also lead your forces and come west."

With that, he withdrew his Divine Ability, rose on a beam of light, and was the first to bow in greeting.

"My deepest thanks to all you fellow Daoists!"

The four Daoist Masters returned the courtesy. Kui Qi's demeanor was the most magnanimous. He extended one hand in a welcoming gesture and said in a clear voice:

"Zhaojing, you are too kind. We shall proceed together. We cannot let the Seven Ways linger and defile the lands of Jiangbei."

Li Ximing expressed his thanks, took a step, and moved forward with them. He saw the Great Snow's Severing Edge in Ning Wan's hands, which was etched with a scene of the Profound Snow and Supreme Yin rising in the cosmos, and sighed inwardly:

'The sword cultivators of Jiangnan would probably die without regret if they could just touch this blade...'

Houfu saw him looking at the Great Snow's Severing Edge and just smiled:
"This sword is one of a kind. Apart from Daoist Master Donghua's Bili, this is the only one. Compared to it, Situ Huo's long saber Blood-Omen Tower, which he wishes he could use as a pillow, is just scrap metal. Guo Shentong's Arrogant Waves would also be inferior, weaker by thirty percent."

As he finished speaking, Tinglan smiled from the side.

"You can't just compare them like that. What kind of people are *they*..."

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators pressed forward using their Divine Abilities. Kui Qi listened to Daoist Master Houfu's idle chatter, his tone relaxed, but one hand rested on his sword, rubbing it. He sighed,

"There's no comparison!"

Although Daoist Master Houfu seemed relaxed as he chatted, Li Ximing still sensed Kui Qi's faint hesitation, as if he was anxious and worried about something.

'After all... they have to face the Way of Emptiness's Zhelu and Taixi, and the Way of Great Desire has at least Vija and Nuzi present. Although we don't know what losses the Buddhist cultivators suffered in the earlier conflict or how many remain, there is still a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Helian family on the sidelines... and that's not even counting the Merciful Ones within the Buddhist Land.'

Although a Merciful One's strength was less than a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's, they were troublesome enough in groups of three or five. It was even more trouble if there were two or three Golden Lotus Seat disciples mixed in, who knew some Dharma Arts and had experience fighting Immortal cultivators.

He followed the group forward and soon saw the radiance of the Buddhist Land in the sky. Golden clouds gathered over Tangdao Mountain, and Primordial Magnetism flashed.

The mountain itself was already impossibly tall, a mass of jagged rock. Now, two enormous golden statues stood there. One was covered in ten thousand eyes, terrifying to the extreme. The other had twelve arms and three heads, wreathed in rainbow light. Its eyes were like stars above the clouds, glittering with light; its hands were like suspended mountain peaks, wreathed in crimson clouds. They were truly as large as mountains.

These two Golden Bodies were only a head shorter than the highest peak. They used Tangdao Mountain as their high-backed immortal throne, sitting firmly upon it. One faced west, one faced east, and they were surrounded by Merciful Ones, looking magnificent under the thick, colorful light.

Before these Golden Bodies, the Daoist Masters were no larger than ants. Yet, their arrival caused the colorful clouds to pause. The Merciful Ones, who had been sitting or standing on either side, immediately flew up on the wind and clasped their hands in greeting.

"Esteemed Daoist Masters, what leisure brings you to visit our Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple!"

Li Ximing recognized at a glance that the two on either side were the sixth-generation Zhelu of the Way of Emptiness, who presided over the Buddhist Land, and the fifth-generation Vija of the Way of Great Desire!
He was no stranger to these two Mahas. They had been the main force in the ambush on Tinglan and Qiuhu all those years ago, and were only forced back by Daoist Master Lingmei of the Sword Gate. For these two to be personally guarding this place... it seemed the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple that the Way of Emptiness and Great Desire had established on this mountain was, as expected, of the utmost importance!

Daoist Master Kui Qi's expression was grim. Seeing the two Mahas in the mountain putting on a false show, sending only a Merciful One over without a word, he was naturally furious. He said coldly:

"The Northern Buddhists have occupied Tangdao Mountain and taken on these giant forms. Do you intend to cross the mountain and come to Baijiang Creek next?"

"Back then, the True Monarch wielded his sword and nearly slew the Sea of Desire's Maha, Liangli, forcing him to swear a great oath not to cross the river for three hundred years. Do you intend to break that oath today?"

Li Ximing understood. Vija was not like Zhelu; he was not the number one. Behind him was the Maha Liangli of the Sea of Desire, who presided over the Buddhist Land, and his cultivation was likely even higher...

'So he was once struck down by True Monarch Shangyuan.'

Vija seemed very calm when this was mentioned. His twelve hands stretched out behind him, and his voice rumbled:

"My Great Desire's Liangli sought instruction from the Jade True and benefited greatly. He is very grateful and will naturally not break his oath. It is just that the Way of Emptiness is moving south, so I came to lend a hand."

Li Ximing, however, was silently pondering.

'I've never heard of this incident... Could it be because a Dharma Master from the Way of Great Desire intervened to save someone?'

He hesitated slightly, but this guess seemed very likely. After all, True Monarch Shangyuan was a Jade True Sword Immortal; anyone who died by his hand was truly dead. It wasn't impossible that this had provoked a Dharma Master to intervene. And if a Dharma Master had acted, it was possible that the impact of the event was suppressed, even if someone had witnessed it. Besides, True Monarch Shangyuan was not one to boast...

Kui Qi couldn't be bothered to argue with him. He just rested his hand on his sword and said,

"There is nothing more to say. The Golden Feather Sect has no say over Tangdao Mountain, but Baijiang Creek is the territory of our Immortal Dao. If you all insist on crossing the river, then we will settle this today."

A voice finally spoke from within the mountain. It was Zhelu. His thousand eyes blinked, and his voice was chilling,

"The Great Snow's Severing Edge is heaven-shakingly powerful, truly formidable. In Lingmei's hands, it is even more so. But the matter of Baijiang Creek will not be clear until we have fought a match."

"As for you, little girl, I fear you are not in your true body!"

His words were aimed squarely at Tinglan!

"Your sect's Migration Token... We of the Buddhist Dao have seen it before!"

If Tinglan was indeed a decoy formed by the Migration Token, and her injuries were not yet healed, then they would be short one person...

The moment this was said, Li Ximing knew this could not be resolved peacefully. But Tinglan, at his side, acted as if she hadn't heard, smiling at Zhelu. At that moment, the entire sky flashed with brilliance, and two more Golden Bodies appeared in the heavens on either side!

Taixi and Nuzi!

But it was far from over. Baleful Qi surged from the earth, and ground-flames erupted, soaring into the air. They streaked through the sky and quickly transformed into a middle-aged man dressed in pure white feathered robes, adorned with Lapis Lazuli.

The man was handsome, holding a long-handled pole-blade that was entirely pitch-black, looking like neither a saber nor a spear. His snow-white feathered robes billowed in the wind. His hair was unbound, and eighteen Lapis Lazuli beads hung at his waist. He raised his eyes and smiled.

"So this is what a Southerner looks like. Nothing special!"

Li Ximing could tell just from his appearance that this was an expert in weaponry. He heard Ning Wan sigh beside him.

"Helian Wumeng."

The sky was filled with Buddhist fiends, their presence overwhelming. Yet, the reaction from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition's side was muted. The Daoist Masters in the front at least bothered to look, but Houfu just lowered his head, admiring the Baleful Qi beneath his feet.

Strangely, although the enemy's posturing was immense, no one on their side rushed forward either. Only a few Merciful Ones flew up, preparing to form a defensive array. Perhaps they, too, were waiting for Lingmei.

Kui Qi gazed at the Golden Bodies from afar, then turned slightly to reveal Ning Wan behind him.

A rift tore open in the Great Void. Ning Wan stood respectfully, holding the sword, as a man materialized before her.

This man was eight feet tall, thin but upright, dressed in robes of black and white. A single gourd hung from his waist. His brow bones were full and sharp, and his hair and beard were neatly bound up in a topknot. His hands were clasped behind his back, and his eyes were calm, fixed on the Golden Bodies.

His aura wasn't particularly outstanding. If not for the thick glow of Divine Ability around him, he might have passed for a village schoolteacher. But when he stood before the group, all the Supreme Yang Daoist Masters bowed together and said respectfully,

"We respectfully welcome the Great Daoist Master!"

This man was the Great Daoist Master of Xiukui, a contemporary of Zipei and the Three Yuans, the Sword Immortal renowned for his prowess in combat: Lou Xing!

Back when the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was a dazzling constellation of stars, with the Three Yuans standing side-by-side and the Two Purples shining brightly, this very Daoist Master Lou Xing was famous even then for his skill in battle!

One had to remember that even Daoist Master Zipei of the Purple Smoke Gate, who was known for her cultivation base and *not* for combat, was still able to make the Buddhist cultivators shrink back in her dying moments. How much more, then, this man standing before them?!

In an instant, the clouds in the sky froze. The rainbow light and Treasure Light paused. The wary Helian Wumeng extinguished his Baleful Qi. Taixi and Nuzi were so terrified they stopped their transformations. Seeing that fair hand grip the sword, no one dared to make the first move.

'He's here! He actually came in person! The battle hasn't even started... We haven't seized a single piece of land in Jiangbei, only the insignificant Golden Tang Gate, and the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition has already summoned their Sword Immortal?!'

The Sword Immortal raised his eyebrows, his gaze lifting. His entire aura changed instantly. His Spiritual Sense had already locked onto all the cultivators, pressing down like Mount Tai, immovable and vast. His voice was level,

"You have all wanted me to come to Jiangbei for a long time..."

He held the Great Snow's Severing Edge, seeming to savor it.

"That monk was right. Nothing will be clear until we have fought. I knew you were trying to force my hand. Since that is the case, you must all bear the price of my appearance."

The moment he spoke, Zhelu, on the mountain, practically exploded. He ignored the sense of crisis warning him that a single move would bring a blade down on him. His entire body bloomed with radiant light, his thousand hands and thousand eyes simultaneously emitting a pink glow. The others, seeing someone else taking the blow, felt as if they'd been granted amnesty. Who cared about Zhelu now? They turned to flee!

But a Sword Immortal's strike takes but an instant.

The sharp, snowy momentum of the sword surged. The emblem of the Profound Snow and Supreme Yin rising in the cosmos, the scene of autumn yielding to winter as heaven and earth merged—all of it appeared at once. After several hundred years, the Great Snow's Severing Edge finally displayed the pinnacle of the union between the divine and Sword Intent before the cultivators. Lou Xing's Way of the Sword and his cultivation pushed its range to the absolute maximum!

'Unless Jingzhan or Murong Xia were here, who could face this sword strike without spitting blood, without feeling utter despair!'

The falling snow scattered, resonating with his perfected Divine Ability. In an instant, every cultivator present was suppressed, unable to even open the Great Void. The thousand-eyed Maha, Zhelu, whose soul had nearly fled his body, leaped into the air, only to suddenly freeze.

The sword light was sharp, and it lanced his Dharma Body, creating cracks all over it, but it wasn't aimed at him!

Instead, it was Vija, who had just turned to leave, whose expression didn't even have time to change. He had no time to defend. He stared at the terrifying sword light that was rapidly expanding before him, locking onto both his soul and his Dharma Body, and terror pierced his heart.

"Ah?"

Wind and thunder churned in the sky. The sword strike landed. The several Mahas and that fiend could finally connect to the Great Void. The thousand-eyed Maha on the mountain, having narrowly escaped death, had no intention of helping. It was every man for himself. He immediately released an infinite, illusory brilliance and instantly fled.

And the Sword Intent, like light, instantly vaporized the Merciful Ones who had the misfortune of being in the sword's path, turning them to ash.

"Krr-chak..."

Next came the sound of the Maha's trump cards and Treasured Artifacts being shattered, the sound of Lapis Lazuli breaking vibrating endlessly from within the Great Void, rising and falling.

In an instant, the pink light and the sword light vanished together. The light of the cold moon retracted. The Maha's main body disappeared, and the Sword Immortal was also gone. A rain of brilliant, pink light fell from the sky. Three massive heads, trailing dust and smoke, tumbled from the sky, smashing toward the ground amidst the flashing Primordial Magnetism. They blotted out the sun, their Treasure Light like stars, their black aura like night!

The dozen or so Merciful Ones nearby still hadn't reacted, frozen in place by the falling snow, which made the descending heads look like blazing meteors. Li Ximing shot forward on his beam of light, hearing Kui Qi's sharp roar.

"Seize this opportunity!"

The Maha was gone, but there were still Merciful Ones in the sky, suppressed by the sword light and unable to escape!

Although Li Ximing didn't know where Vija and the Sword Immortal had gone, it was clear Vija had lost half his life. He could see the golden opportunity before him. How could Lou Xing have acted just to kill one person? This sword strike hadn't consolidated its power on a single point; it had scattered its Sword Might to suppress the entire Tangdao Mountain. Wasn't it precisely to create this situation?!

He was overjoyed.

'Every one we kill now lessens the pressure in the future!'

Almost before his thought had faded, Tinglan's avatar in the sky dissipated. Instead, her true body appeared at the highest point of the horizon, her robes fluttering, holding a small, greyish-white gourd.

The Supreme Minister's Gourd!

The lid was already open, and a ball of flame immediately leaped out. It was a shimmering, two-toned radiance of cyan and blue. The long-prepared Immeasurable Water and Fire poured out, turning into a rain of fire that filled the sky.

The Immeasurable Water and Fire was a special Spiritual Fire that severed connections to the Great Void! Empowered by the Supreme Minister's Gourd, who knew how long it had been accumulating in the Great Void. In an instant, it released thousands of fiery streams, raining down on the head of nearly every Merciful One.

But Immeasurable Water and Fire was, after all, a Spiritual Fire, not suited for quick victories. Even enhanced by a Spiritual Artifact, it was still a step slower than a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. The range of the shattered Great Void rapidly expanded. The four Supreme Yang Daoist Masters attacked in unison. A purple pavilion soared, white snow scattered, a black cord bound, and radiance descended!

"RUMBLE!"

Li Ximing's 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' descended from the sky, trailing a glorious radiance. Seizing the perfect moment, it smashed down onto a golden platform at the foot of Tangdao Mountain!

Three Merciful Ones had been sitting cross-legged there. Suppressed by the terror of the Great Snow's Severing Edge, they had only just managed to fly up. Only one of them, with four arms and two heads, was stronger and farther away, and he barely managed to shift his position.

"BOOM!"

Purple flames and Heavenly Light flashed together. The other two had no time to move at all and were simultaneously pinned beneath the celestial gate. A bright plume of energy erupted as the ground cracked open, and the cliffs on either side shattered and came crashing down.

The four-armed, two-headed Merciful One beside them finally reacted to the lightning-fast turn of events. He had narrowly avoided the celestial gate, and a chill ran down his spine.

'If I get pinned by that right now, I'll definitely lose this Dharma Body!'

But the despair was far from over. His desperate dodge had barely avoided the gate, but it left him no time to escape into the Great Void. That two-toned radiance of cyan and blue was already right in front of him.

'Disciple-brother Huakong!'

Following the desperate shouts of his two disciple-brothers from within the array, all traces of the Great Void vanished from the four-armed, two-headed Merciful One's Spiritual Sense as the fire arrived...

'Damn it... this Immeasurable Water and Fire again!'

The power of the Immeasurable Water and Fire was spread too thin, and most of its power had been spent just reaching him. It wasn't actually a threat to Huakong. The problem was that it severed his connection to the Great Void, which was utterly disgusting!

Fortunately, Huakong knew two Dharma Arts. He slammed his two palms against his chest and instantly split into three illusory Golden Body phantoms, all identical, lifelike, and moving in different directions.

The Supreme Minister's Gourd was not without the ability to distinguish a true body, but it was simply too far away, and the area it was affecting was too large. It was overextended. Confused by the two decoys, the fire could only slip harmlessly through the gap in the middle and drift away.

This Merciful One, Huakong, felt the heat on his face but not a shred of relief. He looked up in despair. The man in the white-gold Daoist robes had, as expected, abandoned the celestial gate and was already stepping through the light to stand before him. A ripple of blue-green light spread out. His Dharma Body, which had been perfect and complete, suddenly felt heavy, as if sinking into a swamp.

The range of this mountain-and-river pattern was enormous. It not only bound him, but his two disciple-brothers, trapped in the bright light, were also struggling against the blue-green glow!

'Zhaojing Li Ximing!'

The light of Reveal River rippled in the air. The Merciful One's heart seized with panic, but he felt a wondrous power responding.

Monarch's Balance!

The blue-green light of Reveal River paused for the briefest moment. But as the Spiritual Ruler hesitated in the air, the Merciful One's two phantoms vanished like snow under a hot sun.

Huakong wanted to spit blood. He brought two hands together in front of his chest and summoned two golden hammers with his other two hands, smashing them directly at the Daoist.

But the Daoist in the white-gold robes just pursed his lips. A jet of red-and-white interwoven flame immediately shot from his mouth, crossed the distance in an instant, slipped between the two hammers, and descended as a brilliant golden-yellow.

Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire!

At the same time, both his hands ignited with a bright white Li Fire. The Sun's Resonant Parting Art activated, coating his palms. He raised his hands and caught the incoming golden hammers.

"CLANG!"

The 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' enhanced his Dharma Body, resonating with the Sun's Resonant Parting Art, and he was further augmented by Reveal River. The two hammers, which his opponent had swung in haste, only managed to explode in a burst of white Li Fire against his palms. Their momentum was greatly slowed, and he held them fast.

But the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire was already pouring down like molten rock, streaming down the Merciful One Huakong's cheeks, searing him and making him scream. A thick, golden-lacquer-like liquid dripped down his chest.

"Wmm..."

In the sky, the greyish-white Supreme Minister's Gourd finally stopped spouting flames. This highly sentient Spiritual Artifact was faithfully executing its master's orders. It scanned the mountain range, and, whether out of anger or because it still recognized Li Ximing, its mouth once again aimed at the four-armed Merciful One who had dodged the fire but failed to escape into the Great Void.

The four-armed Merciful One felt a chill shoot up his spine.

'You damned plague!'

Li Ximing naturally seized the opportunity. In an instant, a brilliant light shot from between his brows. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light lanced out, striking at point-blank range, open and righteous, sweeping toward the man's face.

Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light followed the path of Radiance. In such a direct, face-to-face confrontation, its power was amplified. The Merciful One before him could only cry out in grief.

"This is bitter! I've fallen for his scheme!"

The vast and mighty Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light passed straight through the brilliant glow he desperately spat from his mouth to block it, striking him squarely on the brow, which was already dripping with golden lacquer from the Purple Mansion Realm True Fire.

"Pfft!"

With a muffled sound, his head was pierced through. His heart went cold. Only one thought remained in his mind.

'Self-detonate!'

He had been hit by two Spiritual Fires and one Hidden Light, all striking him where he was weakest. The Immeasurable Water and Fire had cut off the Great Void, making it impossible to communicate with the Buddhist Land. If he was hit by that fire again, he would truly perish!

"BANG!"

He was incredibly decisive. Almost in the same instant as the Hidden Light struck, a dense golden light exploded outward. The two-toned cyan and blue fire streaked across several miles, arriving a moment too late, adding fuel to the fire as it landed on the empty Dharma Body left behind.

Li Ximing sighed inwardly.

This aspect of the Buddhist cultivators was truly annoying. Unless they were ambushed in advance, even with a unique Spiritual Artifact like the Supreme Minister's Gourd and its Immeasurable Water and Fire, as long as they had the slightest intention to die, they were incredibly hard to kill. At most, they would just lose a Dharma Body...

'What a pity!'

"Shhh-laa!"

With Huakong's body destroyed, a pink radiance mixed with brilliant light shot into the sky, transforming into a cascade of pink flower petals that burned to nothing in the dazzling flames, leaving not a trace behind.

As the flower-rain drifted down, Li Ximing swept his gaze over it, then pulled back, landing atop the celestial gate. He stamped his boot on the gate, and his Divine Ability and dharma power surged into it, stamping the 'Audience with the Celestial Gate', which had just started to waver, firmly back down. Then, he pointed two fingers, sending the Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire under the gate.

Li Ximing hadn't been personally driving the Divine Ability; he had been dividing his attention to suppress it. It wasn't impossible for these two Merciful Ones to break free. If that four-armed Merciful One hadn't been so unlucky, he wouldn't have perished in one go, and Li Ximing would have been forced to return to suppress them.

As a result, these two Merciful Ones, who had just begun to shake the gate, felt a heavy weight settle on their shoulders, and their hearts turned cold. Streams of red, white, and golden flames rushed in.

'Disciple-brother Huakong... was slain by him just like that!'
