# Chapter 1134: The Valley Method

'The injury is from Merging Fire, but its roots are in the life-mandate. Among all the injuries to the world's Dao Lineages, this one ranks among the most troublesome to remove...'

'Nourishment from Valley Water would be best, but he isn't a Valley Water cultivator. A medicinal pill cannot easily penetrate the depths of the life-mandate as Merging Fire can. Only when the Water Mansion receives it and the clear water transforms it can there be success.'

Since Dao Mian had asked him to refine the pill, this line of thinking had certainly been verified many times. The key ingredient was a Pulse-Heart Origin Valley Liquid, a spiritual resource of Valley Water hidden deep within the earth. This 'Earth Water' accumulated without releasing. Once it pierced deep into the life-mandate, it would surge forth, its imagery transforming to become a 'Cave Spring'â€”which was, naturally, the clear water.

This old cultivator, who was of the Whole Pill nature, had researched this healing method for many years and clarified all its principles. Even so, with Li Ximing's current, terrifying pill arts, the refinement was still incredibly difficult. It took a full thirty-one days just to get the pill on the right track, leaving him feeling drenched in a cold sweat.

'This is, after all, a spiritual water refinement method. My Valley Wind Guide-Fire technique is useless, so I have to handle every single step personally... If I hadn't achieved World's Radiance, I'm afraid I would have truly suffered.'

As he released his hands from the furnace, he felt his six senses exhausted and his divine abilities drained. He used World's Radiance to seal the furnace and harmonize the various energies within. Tapping two fingers to his waist, he found the jade stone meant for contacting Liu Changdie was glowing brightly.

'Hm? We're on the same island. Why use a jade stone to send a message...'

Though he received the message, he didn't immediately step out into the air. Instead, with a flick of his sleeve, his figure appeared outside the pill room. He took two steps, and just as expected, a man hurried over and bowed.

"Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing glanced at him. The man looked middle-aged, with a robust body and a steady expression. Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

"Clan Brother... it has been some years."

Hearing this, Li Wen revealed a look of panic and knelt to the ground.

"Daoist Master, you praise this lowly one too much!"

This man had once been a pillar of the Li family, loyal and devoted, wielding two golden hammers. But his cultivation method was insufficient. As the Li family rose, he was slowly left behind. He had been left to guard this remote overseas island, holding authority over nearly all of its defenses. This was a sign of great trust. Li Ximing shook his head.

"When I was young, I vividly remember you, Clan Brother, guarding Father with your golden hammers, vigilant from dawn till dusk. Why be so modest?"

Li Wen pressed his forehead to the ground.

"I would not dare."

Li Ximing saw that his essence, qi, and spirit were full, and he carried a dignified air. Feeling moved, he quickly adopted a serious tone.

"Senior Liu..."

The jade stone on his person was warm; it was clearly Liu Changdie's doing, not wanting to disturb his refinement. Li Wen just said,

"Daoist Master, just after you entered seclusion, two groups of people came to the island. They wanted to trade for the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill you possess. Daoist Master Yuanbian was afraid you might come out at just the wrong time and find it difficult to refuse. He had this lowly one come to remind you. He said if I saw you exit seclusion, I must ask: if you have no intention of trading, you need not show yourself... For now, they have both been put off."

Li Ximing was stunned.

"Two groups of people? For the Heavenly Oneness Essence Extraction Pill?"

The strange look in the eyes of Xiang Chun and the other man when he had extended Li Xuanxuan's life flashed through his mind. He found it amusing and silently shook his head. But the man before him continued,

"Ten days ago, another Daoist Master came to the island. He's been discussing something with Daoist Master Yuanbian, and seems to have a request. That Daoist Master is on the island discussing the Dao with him, waiting for you to emerge."

He lowered his gaze and added, "One more thing... people from Yinzhou came. They said... there was news, and they handed something over to Daoist Master Yuanbian."

Li Wen actually didn't know if this was Liu Changdie's personal business or a Li family matter, but his loyalty was absolute, and he reported it without omission. Li Ximing's eyes lit up.

'That copper basin... There's news from Minghui!'

He immediately took a step, his form floating gracefully until he appeared in a pavilion on the island. He saw two Daoist Masters, one in white and one in gray, playing a game of chess.

The person sitting across from Liu Changdie had a face as pale as paper, with pitch-black eyes. Though he seemed animated, there was clearly something strange about him. Li Ximing, with his hands behind his back, made a light pinching motion. His Life Divine Ability instantly sensed it.

'It's a Dharma Body... no weaker than my Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body, just specialized in a different direction.'

He lifted his sleeves and smiled.

"And this is...?"

The person before him had already risen lightly to his feet.

"This lowly one is Cang Tiaozi, a cultivator from the World's Navel. Greetings, Daoist Friend Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing bowed, and the ethereal man immediately explained,

"My Dao involves internally cultivating the five forms, with my life-mandate taking on the Valley aspect. I do not show my true body to others and walk using an air-sac. I ask for your understanding, Daoist Friend!"

"It is no matter!"

The Li family had seen a fair number of 'Valley Water' cultivators. The one they were most familiar with was actually Murong Yan from the north. That man had fought Li Zhouwei many times and also walked about wearing a skin-bag, only revealing his true body during combat.

He smiled and nodded, but his mind was more focused on the man's origins.

'He doesn't call himself one of the rogue cultivators, nor does he name a sect. Just one phrase: World's Navel... a place where Valley Water resides...'

But the man before him was direct and decisive.

"There are several Daoist friends in my Dao who are in urgent need of Lesser Yang items. You are likely aware of the history. I have come this time for the Shore-Manifesting White Flower and other Lesser Yang spiritual items in your possession!"

Cang Tiaozi was naturally referring to the matter in the Western Sea. Li Ximing had heard from Daoist Master Yin Qin long ago that the items in Shehu's possession had all ended up with Cang Tiaozi. When he thought about it, he himself had cut off the man's source of wealth. He nodded gravely.

"I only have this one Shore-Manifesting White Flower. However, I also have a Supreme Eaves Radiance. Would you be interested in that, Daoist Friend?"

A slight smile touched Cang Tiaozi's paper-pale face.

"It is actually that level of radiance... Excellent."

He then revealed several spiritual items from his sleeve, all shining brilliantly. Li Ximing swept his gaze over them and found himself in a difficult position. The other party's foundation was clearly deep; he had come prepared. Not only was every item precious, but there was even one Bright Yang spiritual item!

This spiritual item had sharp, distinct edges, its radiance held within. It was a spirit stone, its surface covered in dense, pale-white lines like the veins of a leaf. Resting in a box of black jade, it looked exceptionally tempting.

Cang Tiaozi said pointedly, "This is the Shield of White Sun!"

Li Ximing's heart stirred.

Although he had never obtained this item, he had heard its great name. Several of his own spirit embryos had been refined using the spiritual essence derived from it, which had been a reward from the Great Xiukui Monastery.

"'Guardian' implies the duty of 'governing'. A Yang Guardian is born from the act of Bright Yang governing a state and upholding justice. Unlike the Radiant Sky Stone, which is born of heaven and earth, this item was only born during the Wei period, appearing before the tombs of kings, princes, and high ministers."

Li Ximing listened for a moment. He was slightly tempted, but his hesitation was just as strong.

'I've collected quite a few Bright Yang items over the years. Zhouwei's weapon and armor are both taken care of. I don't really have a use for this... It's not as practical as Li Fire or Whole Pill.'

Seeing his silence, Cang Tiaozi straightened his posture, glanced at Liu Changdie, and smiled.

"I see, Daoist Friend... that you have cultivated an external body."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow with great interest.

"You have sharp eyes, Daoist Friend."

Cang Tiaozi smiled faintly and said quietly, "The external body arts of this world belong to many Dao Lineages. Some originate from divine abilities, others from spell arts. Whether it's the Divided Aspect of the Supreme Yin or the Form in Transition of Cultivation Transcendence, although they are numerous and chaotic, they all fall into one of three categories."

"First is the great Dao of divine ability. Second is to hide from disaster and avert calamity. And third... is to smear mud and sculpt statues. The first two, in particular, require spiritual resources as vast as the sea, and most cannot bypass my Dao of Valley Water..."

A trace of confidence appeared on his pale face.

"I flatter myself to have some small ability in this area. I can ask around on your behalf."

Li Ximing truly hadn't expected to be persuaded from this angle. He fell silent for a moment, his heart secretly moved.

'The three categories Cang Tiaozi mentioned are, in fact, the upper, middle, and lower paths described in the Marvelous Scroll of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body...'

His Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body had a low starting point, created solely for the purpose of taking on injuries. After years of nourishment, its progress had been painfully slow. He had been forced to halt his research into this spell art long ago...

'This is a perfect chance to let him take a look... to see if he can recognize the roots of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.'

He raised an eyebrow and smiled. His Life Divine Ability circulated as he pinched off a wisp of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body's aura.

"My methods are unorthodox and naturally can't compare to your profound origins, Daoist Friend. Perhaps you could examine it for me?"

Cang Tiaozi took it casually. His bright red lips parted, revealing a completely empty void within. He placed the aura in his "mouth" to taste it.

"Daoist Friend... this is a method of the Encompassing Profoundity."

He said gravely, "Regarding external body arts, all Three Profoundities have their own legacies, but they are most prevalent in the Encompassing Profoundity and the Azure Profoundity. They are numerous and intertwined, yet fundamentally different."

"The Azure Profoundity is ethereal. They use 'Form and Shadow' and Divided Aspects, aiming for the Quest for Gold. That external body is cultivated step by step, a method to seek immortality and advance further!"

"The Encompassing Profoundity governs the heavens. They 'Refine Gold to Cultivate the Dao', completely forgetting the self. Once this external body is perfected, they must transfer their life-mandate into it, shedding their mortal coil!"

"As for Comprehending Profoundity..." The man paused, a hint of taboo in his expression, before continuing hurriedly.

"Comprehending Profoundity values the original body and life-mandate above all else. They would rather discard their Dao-fruit and refuse reincarnation than practice external body arts... The few methods they do possess are exceptionally mysterious."

He emphasized, "Of course, regardless of which of the Three Profoundities, these are all what we would call the first-class great Dao of divine ability."

Li Ximing nodded silently. The description of the Encompassing Profoundity's 'Refining Gold to Cultivate the Dao, completely forgetting the self' was exactly as the marvelous scroll had described!

'This 'refining'... means seizing the essence from the original body. And 'forgetting the self' means... forgetting the _former_ self, which is transferred into the new Dharma Body.'

As Li Ximing was lost in thought, Cang Tiaozi continued,

"As for the second-rate methods of 'hiding from disaster' and 'smearing mud statues', their applications are widespread. Many have been scattered among the various daoist traditions. The Majestic Jeweled Visage that the Buddhist cultivators have erected all over the north is, in essence, one such application. That is why they shatter the instant the main body dies."

"Some who specialize in these have formed their own dao lineages, and their methods are not to be underestimated. In your Jiangnan, there is a Daoist Master Yuanxiu. The 'Yellow Dao Profound Talisman' in his hands is one such branch, and it possesses considerable power for averting disaster..."

"As for your own method, Daoist Friend, it can preserve the life-mandate and separate you from calamities. Although it is not fully developed, I can see that its roots are exceptionally profound."

Li Ximing sighed inwardly. He knew full well which category his own art fell into. He smiled.

"It is merely 'smearing mud statues'."

The man paused, then replied, "Within my World's Navel, there is a certain spring. It occasionally produces an essence that can 'dot the eyes' of such creations. It is often borrowed by Daoist friends from traditions 'Beyond the Profound'. If you were to take some back, Daoist Friend, and use it with other top-tier spiritual items to refine your external body, I guarantee a qualitative change!"

Li Ximing was genuinely tempted, but he knew the other party absolutely needed the items he held. He remained impassive. Hearing that he would _still_ need to find other top-tier spiritual items, he put on a troubled expression.

"I am not proficient in this Dao. I fear it will be like drawing water with a bamboo basketâ€”all for nothing."

Cang Tiaozi finally frowned, his expression turning difficult. He sighed.

"If you are willing to give me the Shore-Manifesting White Flower as well, Daoist Friend, I will add a secret method from my sect. It can nourish and transform that spring water, allowing it to protect your external body at a critical moment... I only ask that you do not leak this method to others."

At this, even Liu Changdie looked tempted. Li Ximing, however, became more alert. He raised an eyebrow and smiled.

"You trust me that much, Daoist Friend!"

Cang Tiaozi merely shook his sleeve, offering a pale smile. His two ink-black eyes stared at Li Ximing.

"Not at all... My Dao was transmitted by the Lady. Over the years, it has been lent out for study many times... I have yet to hear of anyone who dared to teach it recklessly."

Li Ximing's heart settled, and he nodded lightly. Cang Tiaozi also visibly relaxed, a look of profound joy on his face. He produced a jade slip and began to copy the method into it, speaking as he worked,

"You may read this secret method, Daoist Friend. As for the treasure, without a special Water Mansion Spiritual Artifact to preserve it, it will dissipate the moment it leaves the grasp of a divine ability... I will return now and have someone deliver it to Ting Province."

With that, he stood up and immediately took his leave. Li Ximing pondered for a long time before raising his head.

"Senior Liu... do you know of these 'Beyond the Profound' Daoist traditions he mentioned?"

Liu Changdie also seemed to be thinking, his brow deeply furrowed.

'The One-Qi White Globe Stone he worked so hard to trade for is also a Lesser Yang item. How interesting... I wonder what he plans to refine...'

He was deep in thought when Li Ximing's question startled him. He smiled.

"That's simple enough. They are Daoist traditions that do not fall within the Three Profoundities... The most ancient and famous is 'Penglai'. At the True Monarch level, there is also the Northern Dark Mansion. A step below that, you have the Southern Songzhou Luoshe..."

Li Ximing raised his eyebrows, surprised to hear the name of the North Star Lady's residence. Liu Changdie saw his reaction and said,

"Regarding the Sundering of the Lesser Yang, Xiyan considers itself the orthodoxy of Comprehending Profoundity, and the Dragon Monarch considers himself to be of the Azure Profoundity. Only this Lady has never declared her position..."

Li Ximing's thoughts deepened, and he nodded silently. Liu Changdie then, as expected, brought up the matter of Xiang Chun and Shanbai coming for the pill, a bitter smile on his face. Li Ximing simply said,

"It's not that I won't help them. But unless they can produce a treasure capable of extending the life-mandate of a Qi Refining cultivator, they absolutely will not be getting this pill from me!"

Liu Changdie nodded in firm agreement. He took a small scroll from his robes.

"News from Yinzhou Island."

Li Ximing glanced at it. It was indeed from that monk, Minghui. The meeting date, however, was set for two months from now. So much for his 'urgency'.

Seeing this, Li Ximing's heart settled. He casually wiped the message with his divine ability, set a new date, and had it sent back. Liu Changdie nodded silently.

"It's inconvenient, with your pill refinement..."

Li Ximing felt a pang of embarrassment. What pill refinement? The precious pill was already on the right track; he just needed to leave his divine ability here to nourish it...

'I'll just... I'll just have to make that monk wait. His Dharma Body was destroyed anyway. He's bored stiff and has nothing but time...'

His expression unchanging, he politely took his leave. He made his way to the heart of the great formation, faced the faintly pulsing light of the array, and took out the jade slip. Closing his eyes, he began to study it intently.
