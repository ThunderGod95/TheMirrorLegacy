# Chapter 1196: The Cicada’s Grasp

Hearing his words, a hint of pleasure touched Li Jiangqian’s heart. He replied,

“I must thank the seniors of Mount Qusi for all their trouble. You’ve helped my family a great deal, and this junior is deeply grateful.”

“The Great Daoist Master is one of King Wei’s own. There’s no need for such formalities,” Xuanyi said, nodding in approval as he handed over the Spiritual Artifact. “I acted out of respect for the friendship between our families, and because I owe the Great Daoist Master a debt. It was no trouble to make this trip.”

Li Jiangqian had long been paying attention to the matter concerning Diyan that Li Ximing had mentioned. Now, hearing that Diyan had not only taken his own share but also intended to pick the Mount Qusi Dao Lineage clean, a thought took shape in Li Jiangqian’s mind.

‘Perhaps Granduncle guessed wrong. Mount Jingyi and Mount Qusi don’t answer to the same authority at their core, nor are they in a subordinate relationship. In the future, if a true life-or-death crisis arises, seeking his help will be useless. He’s someone you can negotiate the spoils with, not an ally you can bind yourself to.’

He sized up the man covertly, though his words were nothing but courteous as he accepted the item.

“While this artifact was forged in the current age,” Xuanyi explained, “the two spiritual items at its core are of the highest quality, granting it several wondrous properties. The most formidable is the Returning Creek. Vast Cicada himself focused on this property during its refinement. It allows one to escape from the direst of predicaments, fearing neither suppression nor attrition.”

“Although there is a cooldown between uses, its power is absolute. The vast majority of divine abilities are incapable of suppressing it.”

“Oh?”

Li Jiangqian’s eyes lit up.

‘A fine treasure,’ he thought. ‘This is exactly the kind of ability I’ve been lacking! But what a pity… what a pity! It’s a Valley Water artifact, and it’s combined with Metal Virtue. The union of metal and water is unfavorable to my Fire Virtue… alas…’

Unaware of Li Jiangqian’s inner turmoil, Xuanyi continued with an approving tone,

“This ability alone ensures this treasure can be passed down through a clan for generations. It is, at minimum, a mid-grade artifact. But your esteemed clan will benefit from more than just that. It also contains the Long Yue Variable Gold!”

“This material gives rise to a divine ability called Endless Transformation, a manifestation of the Metal Virtue’s way of change. Its potential is limitless. Once activated, the lotus exudes a murderous aura that dulls the luster of other artifacts, causing them to fall like rain. An enemy would find themselves unable to even hold their weapon, trapped by their own power.”

Li Jiangqian’s brow slowly furrowed in doubt.

“I’ve never heard of such a Dao Lineage.”

Xuanyi chuckled wistfully.

“You’re not alone. Even those from Mount Qusi have never seen its like. When this artifact’s abilities first manifested, the Great Daoist Master borrowed it for three days to study it. He told us that this was a rarity in the world, something that never should have appeared in a place like this.”

The words set Li Jiangqian’s teeth on edge.

Xuanyi went on, “The final, minor ability is called Mercury Contention. It can refract all forms of light. Though not powerful, its range is vast, capable of creating illusory forms across both the Upper and Lower Rites.”

“Mercury Contention?”

His younger sister cultivated a method of material properties, and the mention of mercury immediately made Li Jiangqian think of the Whole Pill. He couldn’t help but sigh.

“It seems this is better suited for my little sister. I wonder if she’ll succeed.”

“Fate will run its course.”

Xuanyi offered a word of comfort, a hint of emotion in his voice. Seeing his natural reaction, Li Jiangqian guessed Guo Nanwu had kept his mouth shut and quickly changed the subject.

“My understanding of the Dao is shallow. I never knew that the union of metal and water could produce mercury, yet without the true wonders of lead and mercury, it merely occupies the role of refracting light…”

That one simple sentence sent a jolt through Xuanyi’s heart. He was secretly astounded.

‘Shallow understanding? This boy… his comprehension is terrifyingly high! Even I, upon receiving this Spiritual Artifact, lacked the insight to question it so quickly!’

Outwardly, he simply smiled.

“Coincidentally, I asked the very same question. The Great Daoist Master’s knowledge is as vast as the heavens, and he answered, ‘This mercury is not true mercury. The ancient cultivators often used lead and mercury as metaphors for yin and yang, stating that the sun’s essence is the mercury of the heavens, while the earth’s lead is the moon’s true light.’ This so-called Mercury Contention is, in fact, an internal struggle within the radiance of the supreme yang.”

A sense of gravity settled over Li Jiangqian. He leaned forward, his focus absolute, but the man before him fell silent, as if it were difficult to continue. After a moment, Xuanyi finally added,

“The Great Daoist Master spoke no further on the matter, saying only, ‘To speak more would be to risk heavenly retribution!’”

Li Jiangqian was exceptionally sharp. Knowing the origin of the Long Yue Variable Gold, and recalling the old tales of Taiyuan that Wang Ziya had left behind in the Great Void, an idea instantly clicked into place. He stroked his jade cup, a cold smile forming in his mind.

‘Father said that Taiyuan possessed a Azure Profoundity Dao Lineage and seized Taiyu’s position. Could he have been referring to this? The timing isn’t impossible. The radiance of the supreme yang… which Supreme Yang’s light did Taiyuan receive?’

He fell into silent contemplation. Xuanyi did not disturb him, merely smiling as he held his cup. He watched the crimson-robed, golden-eyed young man sigh.

“How profound. But what does the union of metal and water have to do with the Supreme Yang?”

“If it were that easy for us to understand, we would have all embarked on the Quest for Gold long ago! This artifact has no name; the Great Daoist Master named its abilities himself. Since your clan has a cultivator of the Whole Pill, you may as well inscribe a name of your own.”

Xuanyi shook his head and passed over two other items.

“These two were forged by the Helian family, scraping together their resources year after year. They are unremarkable, save for the saber, which has some merit. I came here today not only to arrange this, but also to discuss another matter with Fellow Daoist Zhaojing…”

Li Jiangqian raised an eyebrow as Xuanyi continued.

“Changli, do you remember a man named Kong Gumo?”

‘How could I forget? The Kong Clan’s last remaining seed at the Purple Mansion Realm.’

The Kong Clan had been bled dry, pushed to its absolute limit. They had found a place of rest, but in Li Jiangqian’s eyes, Kong Gumo remained a potential threat.

As his master, Xuanyi was clearly conflicted.

“The Kong Clan is now utterly alone. Our two families are the only ones you could call close. I came today specifically to discuss him. In the first half of my life, I was burdened by my sect’s feud and suppressed beneath the sea by the Chunyi Dao Gate. While I didn't suffer greatly, I also achieved little. I am ashamed. Besides my direct grandson, I have no truly capable disciples. Looking back, it is he, the one shouldering a blood fued, who has shown the most promise. He may yet be a great help to my family.”

Li Jiangqian understood he was laying his cards on the table; otherwise, he would never have used the words “blood fued.” He sat up straighter and smiled.

“Which family's blood? Which sect's feud?”

Xuanyi sighed.

“The fued is Profound Peak's, as worthless as mud, but the blood is of the Kong Clan, which he treasures it like pure gold.”

“Is this feud as high as the heavens, or as deep as the Earth Abyss?” Li Jiangqian asked.

“It is comparable to both,” Xuanyi sighed. “But as things stand, the heavens are higher still.”

Hearing this, the young man shook his head.

“Aren't you afraid, senior?”

The white-robed Daoist Master rose, and his black boots crushed the fragrant gardenias carpeting the ground. He smiled.

“He is not an ungrateful person. He is still young, full of spirit, and holding onto that anger is what will fuel his breakthrough to the Divine Ability realm. I will not suppress him. Once he succeeds and gains more experience, he will understand how the world works and learn to endure.”

Li Jiangqian remained skeptical.

Xuanyi shrugged.

“His clan is still in the south! I forced him to marry several women from my own clan, and now that they are with child, I see a rare smile on his face. I know he will not act impulsively. This world is filled with people bearing grudges. Look at Changxi—his entire family was annihilated, and was his hatred not also as high as the heavens? He bowed his head for a time, telling himself that one day he would have his revenge. And just like that, a lifetime has passed.”

Li Jiangqian nodded.

“And what about you, Fellow Daoist? Can we afford to involve ourselves in such matters?”

“Haha.” Xuanyi clapped his hands and laughed. “The heavens are too high. How could they possibly notice an ant?”

He spoke from the heart, but seeing the disbelief on the young man’s face, he revealed a little more.

“Besides, my ancestors have their own connections, and we are quite close to Heavenly Pavilion Heavenly Glow. It is rare to find a disciple like him. I am not afraid… not afraid at all!”

“As for your esteemed clan… what is a small favor between us? The karma King Wei shoulders is far heavier than this. Should the day come when he can bear it no longer, what difference would one more louse bite make?”

“In that case, what you mean to say is…” Li Jiangqian, having already grasped the situation, raised an eyebrow.

Xuanyi looked embarrassed.

“I wish to give him my full support, but after refining the last Spiritual Artifact, my coffers are quite empty. I have my eye on a certain Converging Water spirit medicine, but time is growing short, and…”

“I understand,” Li Jiangqian said, smiling as he stood.

If Li Ximing were here, he would have agreed without hesitation. Li Jiangqian, however, always weighed the return on investment.

This is no small matter,’ he calculated internally. ‘From the looks of it, Mount Jingyi likely has a Grotto-Heaven or an even greater power backing it. And he cultivates Earth Virtue! Given his familiarity with the north, he might even be from a celestial lineage…’

‘If so, this could be the breakthrough my plans need. A few decades should be more than enough time. By then, my cultivation will be far greater, and my family will have shown immense kindness to the Kong Clan. Xuanyi’s lips are sealed, but Kong Gumo’s might not be.’

He smiled.

“This is hardly a difficult matter. When you are ready to make the trade, Fellow Daoist, simply ask my family for any spiritual resources you lack. As for the breakthrough pill, I will ask my grand-uncle to personally see to it. We will ensure this matter is brought to a successful conclusion!”

“Your righteousness is profound, Changli!”

Since his arrival, Xuanyi had found the young man to be both warm and agreeable. His favorable impression grew, and after a few more words, he took his leave. Li Jiangqian saw him off past the great lake and returned slowly, lost in thought.

‘If he has value, then this debt of gratitude must be secured. It seems Kong Gumo is still secretly close to his clansmen, though he probably doesn’t know the full story. Once he reaches the Purple Mansion Realm, he will surely return to ask questions…’

‘This favor, then, must be ingrained in the minds of his family. They must be reminded of it constantly. After all, if even hatred is forgotten with death, how much more fleeting is gratitude? Kong Guxi is dead, so Kong Xiaxiang must not die. I must protect him and ensure he tells Kong Gumo everything with his own lips.’

‘A perfect way to kill two birds with one stone.’

A shrewd glint flashed in his eyes. He summoned a few men and waited quietly on the mountain. Before long, Li Suihuan led a broad-faced, robust man in a robe up the path. The man fell to his knees with a thud and crawled forward on the steps.

“Greetings, Daoist Master!”

This was a tiger demon named Yan Hu.

Originally a creature of the Southern Borderlands, he had fled to the mountains and formed a connection with the Li family. Li Ximing had intended for him to act as a liaison between the Southern Borderlands and their lake, helping to gather spiritual resources. But as the powers on the Great Western Plateau grew and Poluoduo underwent changes, the Demon King allied with their family was driven out and replaced by an enemy. Their connection was severed, and the demon was relegated to menial tasks.

He prostrated himself fawningly, feeling the oppressive heat of the Radiant Fire as a cold, heavy voice washed over him.

“I am sending you back to the Southern Borderlands to gather information on spiritual items.”

Yan Hu was a minor demon with little power, useless in a fight. The days of strutting through the Southern Borderlands on borrowed authority were long gone. He had been living in a stupor for years and was stunned that this newly ascended Daoist Master would summon him for such a task. He was overjoyed but dared not try to bluff his way through.

“This humble demon was driven out of the southwest once before and nearly lost his life… I don’t know if now…”

“You need not go deep.”

Hearing the voice from above, Yan Hu timidly raised his head. Li Jiangqian took a sip of tea and said placidly,

“Just go and try your luck. I hear there is a place called Black Lacquer Ridge. You came from there, and many Demon Kings reside nearby. Go and listen for any news.”

Li Jiangqian would never openly send someone. He would use his family’s existing grudge as a pretext, which also allowed him to keep tabs on the Bifeng Mountain Lord. Who would dare object?

The demon understood. He nodded repeatedly and was about to rise when the Daoist Master added nonchalantly,

“There is a new city outside the ridge, enfeoffed to the Marquis Who Rejects Evil. Though my family has ties to them and they owe us favors, we cannot openly support them due to their past crimes. You may visit from time to time, but you are forbidden from meeting with anyone from our family there. Do you understand?”

Yan Hu stared blankly for a moment before rising, half-dazed and trembling.

‘Idiot!’

Li Jiangqian frowned and dismissed him. Just as he was about to issue another command, the silent youth beside him spoke in a low voice.

“Junior will have Guest Retainer Sun, that old servant of Profound Peak, go and put on a show of mourning. Even if this demon’s soul is searched, they will find nothing.”

At these words, Li Jiangqian whipped his head around to properly study his nephew. Two pairs of strikingly similar golden eyes met in the air. A flicker of fascinated surprise crossed the young man’s face, and he smiled.

“Kong Gumo is attempting to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. Our family has provided the resources.”

Li Suihuan nodded calmly.

“Junior will inform Guest Retainer Sun.”

Li Jiangqian nodded and watched his nephew depart. He stood, paced around the mountaintop a few times, and clicked his tongue, muttering with a wry laugh,

“Jianglong, oh, Jianglong… you were good for something after all. What a fine son you produced. It’s a good thing you had the sense not to take him with you!”

The moment the words left his lips, a clear laugh rang out from behind him.

“He is one of our family’s greatest treasures, you know!”

Li Que'wan emerged from the Great Void, treading on an azure wind. A small, exquisite green cauldron hung from her slender waist, its presence seeming to brighten the entire mountain. Without turning, Li Jiangqian said with a note of regret,

“To think I am his inferior in this regard.”

The woman smiled.

“Heavens be praised, has Daoist Master Changli had a fit of compassion? To find the time to shelter the Kong Clan?”

Li Jiangqian took a sip of tea and sighed.

“I suspect Xuanyi has a background connected to Comprehending Profoundity. Befriending him is part of the arrangements for Father’s path forward. In a few decades, should anything happen or any mysterious treasures appear, we will have someone to ask.”

His words were flawless. Li Que'wan paused, a serious expression on her face as she nodded thoughtfully. Before she could dwell on it, Li Jiangqian eagerly picked up the small Valley Water lotus from the table and placed it in her hands.

“This is perfect for you! Why don’t you name it?”

Li Que'wan channeled her divine ability, and as she sensed the artifact, a wondrous light played across her features. After a long moment, she said,

“It’s incredibly powerful… it would rank highly even among our family’s Spiritual Artifacts!”

She seemed moved.

“But its main ability is for escape, which is somewhat redundant for me. I’ve been thinking that we should follow the example of the Three Profoundities disciples, with each of us having our own specialized set of spiritual items. Even if this is unsuitable for you, brother, it could be given to Grand-Uncle. Besides, its power to nullify the light of other artifacts would be perfect for King Wei.”

Li Jiangqian smiled.

“Having cultivated the Whole Pill, you arrange these things with lightning speed. This humble Radiant Fire cultivator is at your disposal.”

Her brother’s silver tongue was something Li Que'wan was long accustomed to. She carefully examined the refinement marks on the lotus, formed a seal, and said,

“Since it can subdue artifacts and possesses the ability to escape and refract light, let’s call it the Subduing Creek Splitting Light Lotus.”

Li Jiangqian was indifferent to such matters. As long as it was useful, he wouldn’t have cared if she called it the Valley Water Lotus. He had his sister inscribe the name with her divine ability.

“You’ve only just had a moment to cultivate. Why have you come out of seclusion already?”

Li Que'wan extended a delicate hand. In her palm, circles of crimson-blue light appeared, and a stream of spiritual water, fragrant with wood and rain, swirled around her fair wrist with a life of its own.

“In the past few months,” she said with a smile, “I seized the opportunity to master the Hidden Profundity divine ability. I have successfully refined the Profound Coffin Crimson Water into this Spiritual Treasure!”

She demonstrated its power, her expression turning serious. “Water and fire are the agents of refinement. Fire excels in attack, while water excels in defense and nourishment. The golden scripture states: ‘Converging is the conjoining marsh; Pit, the mounded marsh; Pristine, the celestial marsh. These are the Three Marshes. Mansion is Cavern Essence; Valley, the Pure Origin. These are the dual origins. The nature of Water Virtue transforms within the Three Marshes and dual origins.’”

Though the words were concise, they carried an air of supreme authority. Li Jiangqian’s eyes lit up, understanding that his sister was sharing her insights. He committed them to memory as she continued.

“Though the names ‘conjoining marsh’ and ‘celestial marsh’ are rarely used now, the other traditions persist. The Profound Coffin Crimson Water is a Mansion Water and should have been called Profound Coffin Cavern Essence. However, it is tinged with the wood virtue from the crimson flowers that grow in it, rendering it impure. Hence, it is simply called Crimson Water. The disadvantage is a greater vulnerability to fire, but its impurity also lends it the virtue of nurturing, which aids the growth of Pure Origin.”

“I said the Subduing Creek Splitting Light Lotus would be somewhat wasted on me,” she explained, “because its source, the Returning Creek Valley Water, is a rare type that does not promote healing. Thus, it cannot be considered Pure Origin and does not align with my Profound Coffin Crimson Water.”

Seeing Li Jiangqian’s disappointed frown, she added,

“However, now that I have refined this spiritual water into a treasure, it has added a surging current of water and wood qi to my dantian. With that accomplished, I had some free time and came out to handle the matters of the god-bestowal ceremony and the spiritual formation.”

“A grand formation for the Purple Mansion Realm will require countless complex nodes. The cost is not the issue, but the time it will consume. It is a matter best handled sooner rather than later.”

Li Jiangqian had taken over Li Ximing’s worldly duties for precisely these reasons. He set down his cup, his expression grave.

“You’re right. Our family’s great lake formation was constructed by Daoist Master Tinglan, with the aid of Daoist Masters Kui Qi and Ning Wan. Now, Daoist Master Kui Qi, the most skilled of them, has passed. As I see it, we have two options for the new formation.”

He held up a hand and ticked off a finger.

“First, Daoist Masters Ning Wan and Tinglan. Second, Senior Changdie.”

“Furthermore, a grand formation of this scale requires a core treasure to build the formation plate, and not a low-grade one. Putting aside our spiritual waters and fires, the family’s other spiritual items are either reserved for the mystic realm or for your future weapon. That leaves us with only a few options: the Mystic Banquet Nectar of the Upper Rite, the Clear Li Malevolence Cloud of the Radiant Fire lineage, the Trinary Yang Annual Radiance of the Lesser Yang, the Qi Moon White Dew of the Supreme Yin, and the Profound-Name Dao-Malice, which will require a bit more time. Five items in total.”

He listed them from memory.

“A formation circulates qi. The Mystic Banquet Nectar is used for gathering qi, so using it as the core shouldn’t impede its function, making it a good fit. The Clear Li Malevolence Cloud is somewhat lacking in quantity, but it could be used to create a personal training ground for me. The Trinary Yang Annual Radiance and the Profound-Name Dao-Malice are both high-quality, but their Dao Lineages are incompatible.”

“As for the Qi Moon White Dew…” Li Jiangqian shook his head. “It is far too conspicuous. It’s unsuitable for something as immobile as a formation. If someone grew greedy, they would practically be helping our enemies destroy it. It is better to keep it on my person for now.”

Li Que'wan nodded in agreement as her brother continued with a frown.

“Senior Changdie cannot easily travel to Jiangnan, which would make the Eastern Sea the ideal location. However, in a meeting of three parties, our family would be the host, and our absence is not an option. We should not take such a risk or cause such a commotion.”

“While you were in seclusion, I drew up a list of four options and sent messengers to the south and east. One was to consult Daoist Masters Ning Wan and Tinglan. The other was to have Daoist Master Yuanbian of the Wave-Suppressing Mansion review them. I wanted to gather both parties’ perspectives.”

He smiled.

“My personal thought is to have Daoist Master Yuanbian lead, with the two masters from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition assisting. We should hear back from them in a few days. We will review their findings, then forward the Supreme Yang proposal to Daoist Master Yuanbian. He can combine the best of both and devise a superior plan.”

Li Jiangqian’s considerations were so thorough that Li Que'wan found she had nothing to add. She pondered for a moment, then smiled and nodded. Before Li Jiangqian could speak again, a middle-aged man hurried up the mountain, his eyes fixed solely on him. He bowed respectfully and announced,

“Daoist Master, a reply has arrived from Daoist Master Situ!”

The man was calm and steady, a saber at his waist. It was Gongsun Bofan.

He had been saved by Li Zhouwei and had changed his allegiance, but he had never been accepted into the Li family’s inner circle. He was thus stationed in Jianghuai, tasked with errands like delivering messages. Li Jiangqian casually took the letter, dismissed him, and then explained to his sister,

“Sometime ago, Grand-Uncle acquired a copy of the Situ family’s ancestral Secret Art of Shouyi's Attainment from some Buddhist cultivators. He sent it to Situ Huo to inquire. It seems we finally have a response.”

The young man read the divine script on the letter, a look of keen interest spreading across his face.

“It’s good news… Situ Huo was said to be in seclusion, but he has emerged for some reason. It seems he was truly tempted!”

“I imagine he has a great many treasures,” Li Que'wan commented.

Li Jiangqian nodded, a puzzled look on his face.

“He is willing to trade a Pristine Water spiritual resource called Spring Morning Drizzle. I’ve never heard of it.”

He looked at her questioningly. Without a moment’s hesitation, Li Que'wan answered as if reciting from a family ledger.

“It is very rare and is formed post-natally. It requires a specific type of qi condensed from the fine rains of the spring equinox, which must then be nurtured in combination with Treasured Earth. This is called Spring Suspended Qi. The amount needed is astronomical… it could not be refined without the resources of a great Daoist Tradition.”

A strange expression crossed her face.

“I am not unfamiliar with it. While reading the family’s Daoist scriptures, I came across the method for gathering Spring Suspended Qi and made a special note of it. I just have no idea where he could have obtained it.”
