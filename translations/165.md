# Chapter 175: The Changing Situation

Shamoli spent several months on the territory of the Easterners, finally understanding what true enjoyment meant. The sight of those veiled, graceful dancers nearly made his eyes pop out of their sockets.0

A few of the Li Family's younger members took him to watch operas, hunt, taste wine, stroll through markets, and participate in cockfights and dog races. Every day was filled with delightful living.0

"Damn it, the folks in the west are really a bunch of fools!"0

Shamoli finally realized why those tribesmen from Mout Yue who returned from the east often looked down upon their western counterparts. Life in the east was completely different, it was relaxing and comfortable. The only headache for Shamoli was the complex and sensitive political life in the east.0

Whenever Shamoli spoke, nine times out of ten, his words would offend someone, leading them to silence him with displeased faces. Unintentionally offending people became a routine until he learned to be cautious, choosing to stay quiet and just smiling happily unless absolutely necessary.0

"Young master!"0

When Shamoli came back to his senses, he saw someone approaching him. After a moment of recollection, he realized that this person was Li Yuanxiu's half-brother, which in Shamoli's view was akin to a royal family's distant relative.0

He quickly replied, "Greetings, brother!"0

The man was slightly taken aback, but since he was accustomed to Shamoli's bluntness, he did not take it to heart. He smiled and asked, "Do you like these dancers?"0

"Yes! Of course, I like them," Shamoli immediately grinned. After spending a few days here, he figured out a pattern—if he expressed his liking for something, nine times out of ten, it would be delivered to his room the next day.0

"The only downside is the strict rules of the Easterners. Unlike at home where you can just drag away anyone you fancy, here, you can only have these dancers..." Shamoli sighed in regret.0

Just then, the courtyard gate creaked open, and a young man in a black robe entered. Upon seeing him, everyone else bowed their heads in silence while Shamoli's eyes lit up. "Brother Jiao!" he called out warmly.0

Li Yuanjiao entered the room, glanced around, and was pleased that the useless ones in the family could finally contribute. They got along well with Shamoli and had likely extracted a lot of information from him.0

Seeing Shamoli's visibly flushed face from mild intoxication, Li Yuanjiao placed a jade box on the table in front of Shamoli, saying with a smile, "I got some spirit fruits recently and immediately thought of you, cousin. These are for you!"0

Shamoli was overjoyed, thinking to himself, Li Yuanjiao really is my pillar in the Li Family. He has brought me several gifts these past months, each of them excellent spirit items!0

Shamoli expressed his gratitude as he took the jade box, pondering over how much he could fetch for such a spirit fruit. Naturally, Li Yuanjiao was well aware of his thoughts. He knew Shamoli's daily activities like the back of his hand.0

Li Yuanjiao then reminded him, "Cousin, I hope you still remember the great endeavor of reclaiming your throne!"0

"Of course I remember!" Shamoli's already red face turned a shade deeper. During his first few days in the town, he remained focused on his endeavor of reclaiming the throne thanks to Li Yuanxiu's constant reminders. But lately, he had almost pushed the matter to the back of his mind, engrossed in daily pleasures.0

"I must speak frankly, cousin. If you can't even attain the Qi Cultivation Realm, you won't be able to stay on the throne even if our family managed to place you there... You need to remember this clearly!"0

This warning stunned Shamoli, sending a shiver down his spine, cursing himself internally for even considering selling the fruit.0

Gratefully, he said, "Thank you for the reminder. I'm extremely grateful! After arriving here, I've already broken through to the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. I will definitely focus on my cultivation from now on and break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm as soon as possible!"0

Li Yuanjiao nodded and left, leaving Shamoli in the courtyard, his gaze still fixated on the dancers. Meanwhile, everyone else was looking at him.0

Shamoli looked in the direction Li Yuanjiao had gone, then cleared his throat and said, "Continue dancing, tonight will be the last... I-I'll start cultivating tomorrow!"0

Li Qiuyang, standing at the side with a sword, remained silent. Assigned to protect Shamoli, he had been by his side day and night and had come to understand the nature of this young man quite well. He sighed quietly, thinking to himself, The lineage of the Mulu clan is decent. Although this guy is just a self-indulgent scion, he still managed to reach the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm in his twenties! How unfair…0

Touching his graying sideburns, Li Qiuyang realized that he was already forty-five years old. Yet, he had only just condensed the Jade Capital Chakra and attained the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. A wave of sorrow washed over him.0

My cultivation speed has been declining day by day. After sixty, cultivators of both the Embryonic Breathing Realm and Qi Cultivation Realm will see a drop in their blood qi. I wonder if I'll ever break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm in this lifetime, to fly with my qi and roam the heavens and earth…0

I started on the path of immortality at eight and seized every moment to cultivate diligently… I've never squandered my time away outside from completing the tasks required by my family. Yet, I might end up dying just like any other mortal, while this self-indulgent scion who spends his nights in revelry, is on the verge of reaching Qi Cultivation Realm... Life is really unfair.1

Hiding in the shadows, Li Qiuyang looked increasingly aged, harboring a barely suppressible longing.0

Uncle Tongya has watched me grow up since I was a child and naturally harbors a bit of affection for me as a younger family member… If I ask him for a pill, perhaps I still have a chance to break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm in this lifetime..?"0

Li Qiuyang, lost in thought, could not help but let a wistful smile cross his face, only to abruptly quell his longing. He scolded himself internally.0

With all these talented juniors emerging in the family, not to mention Yuanxiu and Yuanjiao, even Qinghong is making rapid progress. How could I justify wasting precious pills on an old man like me?0

Li Qiuyang bit back his impulse, resigning himself to silence, observing Shamoli without uttering a word. This middle-aged man had dedicated most of his life to the family's cause but yet… in the end, he refrained from asking for a single pill from the family.6

"Hahahahaha, how charming!"0

Shamoli's laughter echoed in the courtyard, the dim light reflecting off Li Qiuyang's gray hair, highlighting his age even more. He seemed out of place amidst the lavish scene. Like a statue, he silently watched over Shamoli as instructed by his family.2

"Senior, the Xiao Family has received the letter and asked me to bring back their reply, expressing their thanks."0

Chen Donghe knocked on the door of the cave dwelling, presenting a jade slip to Li Tongya. He accepted it and scanned it with his spiritual sense.0

Xiao Yuansi's warm voice filled his mind.0

Having received Brother Tongya's message today, our ancestor has already made a trip into the territory of Mount Yue. With Mount Wu sealed off and left unable to attend to other matters, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of Mount Yue is preparing for a breakthrough to the Golden Core Realm within the next six to seven years, during which signs will surely appear in the heavens and earth.0

Within the sect, I've also learned that all twelve disciples of Mount Wu are Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators who have already made deals with the three sects and seven gates. Once this Purple Mansion Realm dies, Mount Wu will cease to exist, with its Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators each leading people to join the three sects and seven gates.0

It's possible that three or four of them will remain within Mount Yue to establish their own sects or families under Azure Pond's governance. If your clan has any ambitions, you must act swiftly after that person's death to take advantage of such an opportunity. Once the situation stabilizes and Mount Yue's Foundation Establishment Realm has divided the territory and established relations with the sect, any further plots will become difficult!

After reading the jade slip, Li Tongya pondered for a while, formulating a plan in his mind. After a while, he turned and instructed Chen Donghe, "Get Xuanling here."0

Li Xuanling, already waiting at the entrance, entered upon hearing the call.0

Chen Donghe excused himself and Li Tongya whispered softly to him, "Read this jade slip."0

After Xuanling read it, he lowered his head in thought, then heard Li Tongya say, "With Mount Wu about to vanish, the west will see the rise of several Foundation Establishment Realm families under Azure Pond's governance. Our Li Family can seize this opportunity amidst the turmoil to take over Eastern Mount Yue."0

Li Xuanling nodded in agreement, then listened as Li Tongya declared solemnly, "Help Shamoli attain the Qi Cultivation Realm swiftly. As Mount Wu remains sealed, we shall assist Shamoli ascend the throne under the guise of minor upheaval and secretly gain control over Eastern Mount Yue. Once Mount Yue's Purple Mansion Realm cultivator dies, we'll immediately claim Eastern Mount Yue for our Li Family using the Azure Pond Sect's name. Those Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators from Mount Yue, having just lost their backing, won't dare to act rashly!"0

"I understand," Li Xuanling replied in a respectful tone, pondering for a moment before speaking softly, "When those Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators have divided their territories and become part of Azure Pond Sect, they will learn of the Sword Immortal's fame and would not dare to oppose our family. It's likely they will even seek to ingratiate themselves with us like the Yu Family. If handled properly, our Li Family can gain the territory of Eastern Mountain Yue without any effort!"0

"Correct!" Li Tongya nodded, then proceeded to give him his next instructions.0

"There are still a few years left, take a Snake Essence Pill with you, and feed Shamoli with them until he reaches the Qi Cultivation Realm."0

Nurturing Shamoli to reach the Qi Cultivation Realm within six years was somewhat challenging, but not impossible. After all, it only required breaking through two stages, unlike normal cultivation which required steady progress step by step. They could just invest in him with Spirit Stones and spirit fruits without caring about the stability of his foundation. Besides, the consumption of unrefined qi was easier than proper spiritual qi from the environment. However, this also meant that his cultivation progress would suffer in the future, forever unable to attain the Foundation Establishment Realm.0

"I'll make sure it happens!" Li Xuanling replied, ready to leave when Li Tongya suddenly stopped him, asking, "Who is currently looking after Shamoli?"0

"It's Brother Qiuyang, Father," Li Xuanling answered.0

Li Tongya calculated the time, saying gravely, "Li Qiuyang should be around forty-five by now, and I heard he had just recently broken through to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm... Shamoli is an outsider after all. Although these spirit items are for acquiring the territory of Eastern Mountain Yue, we can't explicitly say so. Qiuyang has never requested anything from the family aside from the usual allowance of Spirit Paddies and Spirit Stones over the years. I fear he might perceive this situation as unfair... Call him over."4

Li Xuanling quickly nodded and left. Not long after, there was a gentle knock at the stone door of the cave, and Li Qiuyang's respectful voice came from outside the door.0

"Greetings from Li Qiuyang, Clan Uncle!"0

"Come in."0

Li Tongya put down the jade slip he was holding, glanced at the white hair at Li Qiuyang's sideburns, and said warmly, "In my memory, you're still that little boy on the platform, getting tested for a spiritual orifice. Time really flies, and in the blink of an eye, you have your own large family and have become one of the elders! Your diligent and earnest effort over the years has not gone unnoticed by me."0

Li Qiuyang slightly bowed his head, his eyes moist. He then replied apprehensively, "If not for the family, I would just be an old farmer tending the fields today… I am grateful for the family's kindness and dare not be negligent."1

Li Tongya nodded approvingly, flipping his hand to reveal a small brocade pouch. His expression turned warm.0

"You're a cultivator at the Jade Capital Stage now, yet you don't even have a storage pouch. This is an old one that I used in my youth. It doesn't have a very large capacity, but you can use it for now."0

"Absolutely not!" Li Qiuyang was shocked, knowing the storage pouch was worth a dozen or two Spirit Stones, far beyond what he could afford.0

His usual allowance went to cultivation, and he could not even produce half a Spirit Stone from his pockets. He repeatedly protested, "I can't possibly accept this!"0

Li Tongya waved his hand dismissively and tied the brocade pouch around Li Qiuyang's waist. He clapped his own storage pouch and took out a small jade bottle.0

"This is a Snake Essence Pill, refined by our family. Take it for now. If you can't break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, come back up the mountain to find me," he said softly.0

Li Qiuyang was stunned, his eyes reddening but he found himself unable to refuse such a tempting offer that could potentially let him live for another hundred years.0

He stammered in gratitude, "Thank you… for this kindness that I do not deserve!"0

Li Tongya said sternly, "Nonsense! You deserve this more than the younger generations in the family! Over the past thirty years, you have taken care of our spirit fields, guarded the mine, and eliminated demon beasts. There's no one more dedicated in our family than you!"4

Tears welled up in Li Qiuyang's eyes as he continuously thanked him. Li Tongya comforted him with kind words before sending him off from the cave dwelling.0

Meanwhile in An Residence on Mount Huazhong…0

An Jingming stopped in front of the grand and luxurious hall. Today, his father, An Zheyan, was again feasting in the hall. This hall began construction the day An Zheyan became the family head and was completed on the day of An Jingming's birth. However…underneath its splendor lay the bones of countless craftsmen.0

An Jingming sighed softly, his eyes filled with confusion which quickly turned to anger as he looked at the lively scene.0

With the Yu Family in the north coveting our lands, the Li Family in the south rising like the sun, and even the Ding Family we brought here growing ambitiously bold, our family still feels no sense of crisis and indulges in luxury!1

An Jingming strode forward angrily, only to encounter several mortals bowing their heads as they passed, carrying a large basket dripping with blood. The fear on their faces was palpable, and they dared not meet his gaze.0

"What's going on?!" An Jingming roared as he blocked their path, his voice cold. The mortals had no choice but to drop the basket and kneel, revealing several fingers that rolled out toward An Jingming's feet.0

"The... the bear paw the Family Head ate today..."0

An Jingming closed his eyes, already understanding the situation. An Zheyan was not lustful or greedy, but had an insatiable appetite and was brutally cruel. Any dissatisfaction with the cooks' work led to executions; a poorly stewed bear paw resulted in chopping off the chef's fingers, and an undercooked pork shoulder meant cutting off the chef's legs. Daily, cries could be heard from the mountain hall.0

"Never mind, I get it already."0

An Jingming shook his head, feeling powerless as he could reprimand anyone in the family except his father.0

Stepping into the grand hall, he found An Zheyan drinking with a stern face but smiling upon seeing An Jingming. He called out to him, "My family's pride and hope has arrived!"0

"Father," An Jingming greeted him respectfully and then said, "I have something to tell you."0

"What is it?" An Zheyan frowned, distracted by the stewed bear paw, not expecting An Jingming to solemnly say, "The day of our death and the annihilation of the An family is imminent!"
