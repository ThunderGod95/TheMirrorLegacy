# Chapter 925: Feathers from Beneath the Neck

Li Ximing immediately rose and landed on the central white pool. Filled with anticipation, he reached out his hand, his spiritual sense connecting with the great array.

"Rise!"

The surface of the white pool rippled instantly. Faintly, the two characters for "Feather Transformation" lit up at the bottom. Six streams of light surged forth, tumbling over each other to land in his palm, where they solidified into six long, pure-white feathers.

Each feather was six inches long and perfectly white. Though they were feathers, they felt like a single, seamless piece, as if cast from silver. Their edges were extraordinarily sharp. Under the faint, ambient glow of the cave mansion's dharma power, the surface of the feathers revealed a pattern of fine, dense scales, shimmering like a rippling current.

A Mansion Water-type Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resource: Neck Feathers!

Li Ximing quickly retrieved a jade box and carefully placed the six Neck Feathers inside. He then drew up a small amount of Wall-Sinking Water and gently added it to the box to nourish the spiritual resource.

Strangely, once removed from the pool, the Wall-Sinking Water turned perfectly clear and transparent. It made the six feathers in the box gleam even more brilliantly, the water shifting as if alive.

With the six Neck Feathers in hand, Li Ximing felt even more content. Although he did not cultivate the Mansion Water path, Neck Feathers were Purple Mansion Realm resources nonetheless, and six was by no means a small number.

He lowered his gaze and began to calculate.

'Six white feathers represent six hundred years. The Wall-Sinking Water in the pool is at seventy percent, so that's seventy years. A total of six hundred and seventy years... Six hundred and seventy years ago, the Yuan family fled south to Jiangnan, and the Azure Pond Sect had only just been founded... To think there was a Mansion Water cultivator of such profound skill back then!'

He crossed the pool and once again communicated with the array. A crisp, chiming sound, like crystal, echoed from all around. On the smooth walls of the great hall, six ornate doors materialized, each facing a different direction.

These were the other side halls.

Li Ximing stepped into the first one. It was a long corridor that opened into its own separate space. His spiritual sense swept the area, counting sixteen small chambers apparently used for storing spirit items. Every chamber was empty and spotless. The first one showed faint traces of bottles and jars, but the remaining rooms were sealed, untouched by even a speck of dust. He couldn't tell if they had never been used or had simply been cleared out long ago.

Li Ximing entered the first chamber and sorted through it. In the end, he only found two small boxes of White Partridge Origin Spring. This was a Foundation Establishment Realm-level Mansion Water fluid, adept at nourishing other items. Back then, Tinglan's Primal Essence of Heavenly Oneness had been preserved using this very substance. The boxes were empty now, clear proof that whatever they had held was long gone.

'The master of this Wave-Suppressing Mansion seems to have had no disciples or descendants,' he thought. 'He'd rather build sixteen storage rooms and use only one, without leaving a single cultivation abode for his juniors...'

'But now that it's fallen into my family's hands, we can make some modifications when our people arrive. We can convert these sixteen spirit storehouses into proper cultivation abodes for the younger generation to use.'

He stepped out and moved to the adjacent hall. A wave of intense heat washed over him. This was a forging workshop, built from black stone and bricks. A large artifact furnace stood in the center, surrounded by various spirit tools hanging from the walls. A stream of pure black Mansion Water fluid trickled down, following glowing patterns etched into the floor.

To the side was another small pool, clearly intended for quenching. The Wall-Sinking Water within it was strikingly different from the pool in the main hall; it was crystal clear, with a faint azure tint.

'It really is a Mansion Water artifact forging method. This black liquid must be Wushe Spirit Water. Out in the world, people use this to practice Dharma Arts or store it in spirit bottles and dharma artifacts for combat...'

Li Ximing knew little about artifact forging, so he gave the room a cursory glance. Finally, his eyes landed on a long, ink-black saber submerged in the quenching pool.

He only needed that single glance to understand.

"An ancient dharma artifact. Most likely, it's a degenerated spirit embryo."

He stored it away and mentally ran through the list of Mansion Water cultivators in Jiangnan's Purple Mansion Realm. An idea quickly formed.

'Senior Chen Yin cultivates the Mansion Water path. Although his Daoist tradition is no longer passed down, there really aren't any other Mansion Water experts at the Purple Mansion Realm. I must go and see him!'

He quickly moved to the next hall, which was the personal rear chamber of the Wave-Suppressing Mansion's master.

Compared to the opulence of the main hall, this place felt spartan. Though spacious, it was no larger than a courtyard. Most of it was paved with simple, ancient bluestone bricks. The furnishings were ordinary; there was no bed, making it feel more like a study. On the desk, a simple ink brush rested on a single sheet of paper.

Li Ximing's gaze swept over the elegant, flowing script.

"Deep winter conceals weakness; flourishing lakes gather form. This is the nature of Mansion Water. With Cold Qi and Valley Water both present, how can the Mansion Water path not be proven? My only regret is that the *Yu* seized the *Yuan*, the Profound Giant Turtle lost its vastness, and from that day, our natures could never merge!"

The characters were pure black, emitting not the slightest trace of light. Yet the white paper—made of some unknown material—seemed like polished white jade, its curled edges suffused with a soft halo.

The desk was otherwise empty, save for this brush and paper. Directly in front of them lay a jade slip. It was not sealed or locked, but it contained only a Qi Refining method. Li Ximing probed it with his spiritual sense and recognized it immediately.

*River and Stream One Qi Art*—which grants the Immortal Foundation 'Vast Ocean'!

Li Ximing stared at the handwriting. He silently took out a jade box, lifted the paper, which felt more like a jade tablet, and placed it inside. He gazed at it for a long time.

'How can the Mansion Water path not be proven? My only regret is that the *Yu* seized the *Yuan*, the Profound Giant Turtle lost its vastness, and from that day, our natures could never merge!'

'Vast Ocean' was the foundation achieved by the Li family's first Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Ancestor Li Tongya. It wasn't just Li Ximing; every cultivator in the Li family knew the description by heart:

'The Pit Water's 'Vast Ocean', anciently called the 'Jing Dragon King'... This must be the 'vastness' he was talking about!'

'*Yu*... so one of the aspects of Pit Water was originally *Yu*. The records state: "In the streams and ridges of Jiangnan, there is a water-shooting, inch-long insect. It attacks a person's shadow with its qi, killing them without remedy." That... does seem to fit...'

Pit Water was always known as the water of difficult streams and gullies. Li Ximing was accustomed to this and had never questioned it. But looking at it now, something felt wrong.

'Why change the name? How could Pit Water ever be known for its 'vastness'? A change must have occurred. Mansion Water is known as the path of lakes and marshes. Now, the lakes and marshes are withered, which aligns perfectly with 'lost its vastness'...'

'I've just never heard of any clear suppression or conflict between Pit and Mansion. I've only heard that Pit and Converging Water can be reconciled using Harmonising Metal. But there is no known method to harmonize Pit Water and Mansion Water.'

He felt a creeping chill. Though his Dao-Profundity wasn't exceptionally high, he understood the implications.

'Pit Water stole the 'vastness' from Mansion Water. The 'Vast Ocean'... Given the domineering and solitary nature of the Dragon-kin, how could they possibly tolerate another Daoist tradition claiming the title 'Vast Ocean'? If Senior Xiao ever tries to certify his Pit Water path, the Dragon-kin are almost certain to become a problem!'

His gaze flickered, finally settling on the jade slip before him.

'*River and Stream One Qi Art*... Even if it's not connected to the Lingyu Gate, it *is* connected to the Ning State's Chen Clan. And as it happens, Chen Yin cultivates the Mansion Water path. Although the two Chen clans are not one and the same, the pieces still line up!'

The implications left him silent. The Xiao family and the Chen Clan had an ambiguous history, their ancestors sharing many connections. It seemed everything was rooted in the distant past. He dimly foresaw the immense hardships awaiting Xiao Chuting on his path. Wordlessly, he exited the hall and moved on.

Of the three remaining halls, one was completely empty. There was nothing but a circular, altar-like decoration on the floor, painted with water patterns, which was also empty. Li Ximing pondered this and formed a hypothesis.

"A spirit tree was once planted here. The master of the Wave-Suppressing Mansion must have taken it with him when he left..."

Another hall was a scripture pavilion. Though beautifully decorated, its master had clearly neglected it. Not only was the space small, but the shelves were bare. It didn't look as though they had been emptied, but rather as if nothing had ever been placed on them at all.

Having found nothing in these two, Li Ximing finally arrived at the profound gate standing opposite the forging workshop. He pushed it open, his heart brimming with hope.

It was, indeed, the alchemy hall!

The space was vast, adorned with Mansion Water patterns. In the center stood a towering, pagoda-like alchemy furnace of blue and gold. At its six corners, statues of roaring Profound Giant Turtles, each three or four times the size of a man, faced the furnace, their mouths emitting a faint glow.

The moment he stepped inside, the hall lit up. Lamps ignited with the undulating light of a lake, their reflections intertwining, bathing the entire hall in shimmering, watery light.

"What a furnace!"

Li Ximing's eyes lit up. He strode forward and placed a hand on the furnace, sensing it carefully.

'It's just as I thought: a Mansion Water alchemy method...'

The central furnace was named Vast Lake. It wasn't a single dharma artifact, but rather a construct of several components, each forged as a separate dharma artifact, then assembled into this massive furnace. It was linked to the formations, creating a complex alchemy array system embedded into the hall itself.

The six roaring Profound Giant Turtle statues were also part of the system. If Li Ximing guessed correctly, the moment the furnace was activated, the six statues would spew Mansion Water fluid, channeling it to the central furnace to aid in the refinement process.

'If the mansion's original master used a Mansion Water technique to refine pills, this furnace is likely on par with the Purple Mansion Realm level. For ordinary fire refinement, it would be far inferior, but it's still leagues beyond the Treasure Elephant Cauldron.'

He circled the Vast Lake alchemy array, treasuring the sight. He was stunned.
'Did this mansion belong to more than one Purple Mansion Realm cultivator? Unless one was simply born with the knowledge, how could a single person achieve such mastery in both alchemy *and* artifact forging!'

He walked down from the furnace platform, deeply satisfied. He fought back the strong urge to fire it up for a test run.

"Although this furnace is for Mansion Water use, it probably won't harmonize well with my Pit Water. It'll be hard to fleece Dingyang Zi a second time with this... but it will certainly be useful in the future."

Loaded with gains, he pushed open the door of the alchemy hall and returned to the main chamber. The Spiritual Qi here wasn't as rich as in the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, but it was still an extravagant luxury for the clan's younger generations.

He smiled as he arrived before the rippling Feather Transformation Pool and pondered for a moment.

'The Spirit-Storing marvel is wondrous. It can condense Wall-Sinking Water, filling the pool over a hundred years, and then transform it into the Purple Mansion Realm spiritual resource, Neck Feathers.'

His expression grew thoughtful. He vanished from the spot, reappearing in the artifact hall. Moments later, he returned, holding the water from the quenching pool, now condensed into a sphere of Wall-Sinking Water in his palm.

Li Ximing flicked his finger. The sphere of Wall-Sinking Water immediately sank, pouring entirely into the Feather Transformation Pool!

'Must I really wait for it to condense on its own? Can't I just collect Wall-Sinking Water and pour it in myself?!'

It worked. As the water level rose, the pool's contents began to dilute. The clear, transparent Wall-Sinking Water turned a milky white the moment it entered the pool. The mansion's array roared to life, the Base of the Profound Mansion began to condense its power, and its profound marvels permeated the water.

Based on the array's feedback, Li Ximing estimated that this new batch of Neck Feathers would finish condensing in just one year!

His joy was written all over his face. He stared at the pool with unconcealed excitement.

"So *this* is how it's meant to be used! Otherwise, who could possibly wait a hundred years? How many centuries does a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator even have!"

"This is a true money-tree! It's equivalent to a Purple Mansion Realm spirit tree, endlessly producing spiritual resources. Even a Purple Mansion Realm spirit tree isn't guaranteed to produce one resource every single year! *This* is the true power of this marvel. This is its real purpose!"

"It can't create them from nothing, of course. It still requires a significant amount of Wall-Sinking Water. Over time, the price will inevitably rise. The key is to find a massive, stable source... But what an incredible boon, to convert a low-tier spirit item into a Purple Mansion Realm resource! This so-called Wall-Sinking Water... I used to think it was just a waste of space in my storage bag!"

He admired his work for a while longer, then studied the entire mansion one last time, inside and out. Finally, he brought himself to leave. The stone door sealed behind him. He stood for a moment, staring at the words Wave-Suppressing Mansion as he gathered his thoughts.

'The connection to the Ning State Chen Clan is unavoidable. But regardless, my family *must* station troops on Long Helm Island.'

After all, this Purple Mansion Realm array was bound to the land; it was impossible to move. He feared that even all the array masters of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition working together could not guarantee the array's marvels would still function if relocated. The only option was to send people here.

"Besides, there's that baleful lake outside. It isolates Spiritual Qi, acting as a natural barrier against Purple Mansion Realm cultivators."

He transformed into a streak of light, not forgetting the spring eye of the Baleful Earth Coldspring within the lake. He plunged into the water and, just as before, saw thick black ice forming at the bottom. The Pit Water qi, manifested by the Trial of the Pit marvel, blew like a rolling gray wind across the ice, continuously transforming the Baleful Earth Coldspring into Dark-Seal Baleful Liquid.

But it was only on this second look that he realized a shocking truth: the so-called Base of the Profound Mansion for the Profound Turtle Mansion-Guarding Spirit Array *was* the Baleful Earth Coldspring spring eye! The water veins, earth veins, and spirit veins were all merged into one. The Baleful Earth Coldspring and the baleful lake were, in fact, *products* of this Base!

'He didn't build the array here because of a natural baleful lake. He used the array's profound marvels to *create* this lake over the centuries! This Spiritual Qi-void barrier was part of his plan from the very beginning!'

'What's more, the three veins are merged as one. If anyone tried to shatter this array by force, the entire mansion would collapse. Forget the Grotto Egret Profound Water, even the main halls wouldn't survive! This level of array artistry is simply divine!'

Li Ximing observed the Base of the Profound Mansion in utter disbelief, sighing with emotion.

'This is the handiwork of a celestial figure! Never mind anyone else, even if Daoist Master Zipei—the one with the highest Dao-Profundity in all of Jiangnan—came to set this array, she probably couldn't achieve such a masterful, harmonious, and natural integration!'

He scanned the area a few more times. His spiritual sense estimated there were three or four portions of Baleful Earth Coldspring under the black ice, but no other treasures to speak of. He transformed into light and traveled through the earth veins, emerging on the surface moments later.

Outside, the night wind was strong, and the sea was a sheet of black. Pinpricks of light dotted the island. His mood was excellent. He soared into the sky and began the journey back.

His official excuse for leaving had been to travel to the Southern Borderlands in search of a spirit fire. He couldn't just return to the lake so quickly. He still had ample time. He entered the Great Void, looped around to the southwest, and flew toward the Southern Borderlands.
