# Chapter 1053: Preparing for the Purple Mansion Realm

Li Jiangqian ascended the mountain from below and knelt amidst the forest, his voice respectful.

"Congratulations on achieving your new divine ability, senior. This junior is overjoyed and deeply honored."

It had been some time since Li Ximing had last seen him. During his years of secluded cultivation, he had involved himself little in worldly affairs. Li Jiangqian’s attire had become simpler; he wore only a plain, light-white Daoist robe that gave him a different air. Li Ximing looked him over and smiled.

"Your time is precious. I've made you wait."

Li Jiangqian bowed.

"It was no long wait. I passed the time listening to my cousin Jiangchun recount the changes of the past few years. I have been reflecting ever since. The world is changing far faster than I anticipated... The matter of my own divine ability cannot be delayed."

Li Ximing knew he had always been a man with his own ideas and wondered what was on his mind now.

"I heard that Jiangxia was assigned to guard the Wilderness and that Jianglong is still in the imperial capital. Both brothers have their ambitions. The Purple and Gold Palace is a great opportunity... What are your thoughts on the matter?"

Li Jiangqian smiled faintly.

"It is not for this junior to say. My brothers are dedicated and will surely not neglect the family."

Li Ximing simply shook his head and changed the subject.

"How goes your cultivation?"

At this, Li Jiangqian's expression turned serious.

"Of the four secret arts in the Scripture of Heavenly Radiance and the Waning Sun, I have mastered the third, Setting the Snare. Only True Flame remains. Its difficulty is immense. I have studied it closely, and its mysteries are as vast and profound as a boundless sea. I fear... it is not something I can master in five or six years. Even if all goes smoothly, it will likely take a decade."

The words gave Li Ximing a headache. As a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator himself, he understood the difficulty of secret arts. The Bright Yang arts he had studied back then had been thoroughly analyzed and explained, written with perfect clarity—far simpler than the scripture Li Jiangqian held.

'Not everyone can be like his father, after all...'

Li Jiangqian did not dwell on his own struggles but lowered his head slightly and continued,

"Over the years, several secret letters have arrived from overseas, written by my younger sister, Que'Wan. Her progress is not slow. The Golden Book of Divine Attendance contains five secret arts, and she has already mastered three of them!"

"Three?" Li Ximing was taken aback.

Because she had to practice shamanic arts year-round, Li Que'wan's cultivation had always been a step behind Li Jiangqian's. When he was mastering his second secret art, Heavenly Apricot, she had only just begun her first. Yet now, her pace was faster.

Li Jiangqian nodded with a smile.

"Her shamanic practices have greatly enhanced her Dao-Profundity, which in turn has aided her mastery of the secret arts. Even though her cultivation method is more difficult than mine, she is still a bit faster."

Li Ximing smiled and nodded, letting the topic pass. He counted on his fingers, a frown creasing his brow.

'Ten years for True Flame... and that's if things go smoothly. Then he'll need to enter seclusion to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm... By my standards, that's another ten years. Two decades will pass in the blink of an eye. By then... Minghuang might already be a Great Daoist Master.'

Li Jiangqian was still young. If the world were stable, Li Ximing wouldn't mind waiting twenty, forty, or even sixty years. But he understood Li Zhouwei's dilemma all too well.

'He needs the support of a Purple Mansion cultivator to suppress the Buddhist cultivators. Twenty-odd years... that's a bit too long...'

He looked intently at Li Jiangqian and asked in a low voice,

"True Flame... must you truly master it?"

The question was all Li Jiangqian needed. He understood at once and replied solemnly,

"That is precisely what I came to discuss with you, Daoist Master. I propose we abandon this art and seek my divine ability directly!"

He paused, a hint of regret in his eyes.

"When you were in seclusion, I had already asked the old master about this. But he firmly rejected the idea, insisting I master every secret art before making the attempt... So I had no choice but to return to my cave-dwelling."

Li Xuanxuan was always more protective. Li Ximing, however, was different. He frowned and nodded.

"If things don't go smoothly, it could be more than a decade... We truly cannot afford to wait. In that time, with the help of medicinal pills, you could have already refined an additional divine ability..."

And Li Jiangqian had not even received his talisman qi yet. If everything went well, the two divine abilities he would gain after reaching the Purple Mansion Realm would come to him with incredible ease. Reaching the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm would not only be a certainty but would happen with astonishing speed.

'A mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator, a decade or so sooner... that's enough to change the entire situation.'

Li Ximing pondered this for a long time. Kneeling on the ground, Li Jiangqian's mind was also racing, his emotions a mix of caution and complexity. His personality dictated that he would never allow the slightest mishap in a life-threatening event like a realm breakthrough, nor would he pass up any opportunity to increase his chances of success. But the current situation... the more he heard, the more unsettling it felt.

'Father is seeking the path of Bright Yang... and the conflict between the north and south is escalating. If something goes wrong, it will be a world-shattering catastrophe...'

A shadow fell over his thoughts.

'I once believed Father could protect us for three hundred years with ease. Now, it seems that is far from enough. The quest for the Gold depends on the state of the world; it certainly won't take more than a century. In an extreme case, it might only be sixty or seventy years...'

Of everyone at Moongaze Lake, his father, Li Zhouwei, was the one he could never read. He had no idea how confident his father truly was. In such circumstances, Li Jiangqian always prepared for the worst.

'If something happens to Father, I need enough power to protect myself... preferably as a Great Daoist Master... someone valuable enough to be noticed by the great powers...'

Given the urgency, Li Jiangqian could wait no longer. One secret art, True Flame, would take over a decade. Opportunities are fleeting; where would he find another ten years to spare?

'Reaching the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm won't be difficult, but the legendary immortal threshold of the Purple Mystery is no joke. I cannot wait.'

Driven by these considerations, Li Jiangqian bowed solemnly before the Daoist Master.

"Father is entangled in the north-south conflict, and the lake faces constant threats. At this time of crisis, Jiangqian is unwilling to wait any longer!"

Li Ximing gave a heavy nod and reassured him,

"You need not be anxious. I have considered this matter deeply."

He produced a box from his sleeve, revealing the spiritual item within.

Inside lay a perfectly round, brilliant golden pearl. Feather-like patterns drifted across its surface, and a deep golden light swirled within, emanating an exceptionally profound aura of Radiant Fire. Li Ximing explained,

"I asked about this item. It is a Golden Li Amber Pearl. It is of immense help to Radiant Fire cultivators. It can enhance divine abilities and be used to forge dharma artifacts, though it cannot be consumed to heal injuries. It is also an ideal spiritual item for a breakthrough!"

This treasure had been obtained from the Radiant Fire Palace in the grotto-heaven, prepared by the senior named Lu for his lineage's successor. It had clearly been chosen with great care. Li Ximing handed it over, then produced a jade vial.

"This is an Embracing-Feather Uniting-Heart Pill. I acquired it back in Poluoduo while refining pills for a Radiant Fire Demon King. It's a Purple Mansion Realm pill, made with incredibly potent ingredients to trade for spiritual fire. It will be more than sufficient for your needs."

Li Jiangqian quickly accepted them, but before he could offer his thanks, Li Ximing waved him silent. With a flip of his palm, he revealed a Spiritual Treasure that shone like a Golden Core—it was the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument!

"This is an extremely precious Spiritual Treasure," Li Ximing said. "It belongs to your father, who intended to give it to you long ago. I have merely been keeping it for him. Within it lies a wondrous mystery, a form of Dao-Cultivation that can assist in cultivating divine abilities of the Radiant Fire and True Fire path."

He offered a slight smile.

"It is only because of this marvelous Spiritual Treasure that I am willing to let you attempt your breakthrough early!"

Li Ximing's preparations were nothing short of meticulous. He spoke with deep meaning,

"When your father rushed into seclusion on the sea all those years ago, he didn't have conditions like these, to say nothing of myself. These items... even most Immortal Sects couldn't gather them all. Your father prepared each one for you. You must remember this."

Tears streamed down Li Jiangqian's face as he kowtowed.

"I will engrave the family's kindness in my heart... and I will not fail your expectations."

Li Ximing sighed softly. "Have you chosen a location?"

Li Jiangqian shook his head.

"It can only be on the lake. Anywhere else... I would not feel at ease."

Li Ximing had considered Wave-Suppressing Mansion. He thought to himself:

'The spiritual aura in Jiangnan is unlikely to change. In some ways, it's safer than being overseas. But there's always a chance our family won't be able to defend it, and enemies could break through...'

'Que'Wan will definitely be at Wave-Suppressing Mansion. In that case, Jiangqian should stay on the lake. They will be in seclusion separately. If something happens to one location, at least we can ensure one of them survives.'

He agreed to the plan and, with a flick of his sleeve, declared,

"You will enter seclusion within the inner array. The spiritual qi there is stable, and you will not be disturbed. I will personally activate the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument and use my divine ability to lock the Spiritual Treasure within the great array to aid your breakthrough!"

## Pingya Islands

Brilliant Heavenly Light always shone upon Gardenia Scenery Mountain. Farther from the mountain and out over the lake, the radiance dimmed considerably. Li Suining traveled with haste, landing before the grand hall on the island just as a man in hemp clothes was descending the steps.

"Guest Retainer Nantanchen!"

Li Suining offered a slight bow, and Nantanchen cupped his hands with a smile. 

"Greetings, Young Master!"

Much like in his previous life, Nantanchen, the Nanzhang cultivator of humble origins, had revealed a talent for alchemy and had quickly taken charge of the family's pill-refining operations. Li Suining had come to see the old master, Li Xuanxuan. Seeing Nantanchen coming from the hall, he knew the man had been reporting directly to the elder. He smiled kindly.

"Congratulations, Guest Retainer."

Nantanchen shook his head, bowed again, and quickly departed. Li Suining watched him go, strange feelings and lament rising within him.

'Chen Jinxi... he actually fell...'

Chen Jinxi was Chen Yang's own son and a pillar of the Chen Clan. He had later reached the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, and alongside Chen Jinguang, they were known as the Twin Jewels of the Chen Clan. While not widely famous, they were ranked among the top cultivators of the vassal families on the lake.

'This recent battle was unexpectedly fierce. He was killed, and even Nantanchen seemed moved by it, going to offer his condolences...'

This was what struck Li Suining as odd. In his past life, Chen Jinxi had suppressed Nantanchen for a lifetime, thwarting him at every turn. Their conflict had been bitter, and the entire Chen Clan had never shown Nantanchen any kindness. Upon hearing of Chen Jinxi's death, Nantanchen should have laughed three times over.

'With his pillar gone, Chen Yang has suddenly reined himself in, with no mind to bother Nantanchen. That must be why he has risen so quickly in this life...'

He sighed with mixed feelings, but his greater concern was the situation on the shore. He was perpetually worried.

'King Wei was likely injured more severely this time and probably won't be coming out of seclusion anytime soon. Thankfully, no major disasters have occurred.'

He walked forward quickly and entered the great hall, announcing respectfully, 

"This junior, Suining, pays his respects to the old master!"

A curt grunt answered him, bidding him enter. Li Suining bowed again. 

"Suining's cultivation is complete. I have come to request a pill!"

He looked up and found the old man before him was gray-haired and weary, leaning back in the main seat. He seemed troubled, a book held in his hands. In the ambient light, his aged eyes seemed clouded, looking startlingly close to the image from Suining's memories. For a moment, Suining was lost in a daze.

'The master... he has aged so much.'

Li Xuanxuan, however, seemed not to notice. He stood with a pleased expression.

"You've finished regulating your qi... you're ready to break through!"

Li Suining quickly put on a smile. Li Xuanxuan helped him up personally, his eyes filled with approval.

"Sometimes I can't tell anymore," he sighed. "Whether it was Que'Wan or your younger granduncle back then, you children who grew up by the lake are all so sensible. The ones who grew up here on the islands... they just don't like to listen."

Li Suining thought he was referring to Li Zhouming and shook his head in confusion. Li Xuanxuan sighed again.

"That cousin your Uncle Jiangzong gave you... Li Suiqing... the older he gets, the more disobedient he becomes. His father was in seclusion for most of the years after he was born, but he was clearly taught by others. I don't know how he turned out this way. He's managed to displease everyone. But enough of that. Today is a happy occasion for you, let's not speak of such vexing things..."

Understanding dawned on Li Suining.

His uncle, Li Jiangzong, now handled most of the family's affairs and was a rare talent. He had a legitimate son, Li Suiqing, who was utterly useless.

Suining remembered him vividly. Li Suiqing had a mischievous personality, which he could curb when scolded by the elders, but his greed was an incurable flaw. He was repeatedly punished, eventually being sent out to a market town where his corruption was so severe he was dragged back to Qingdu and was never heard from again.

As the family grew, so did the number of both good and bad seeds. Since Suining wasn't at the Jade Court, he didn't know the details, but Li Suiqing's status was significant, and he was a great source of pain for Li Jiangzong, which was why Suining remembered him. He offered a few words of comfort.

"Cousin is still young... he still needs the old master's guidance."

Li Xuanxuan seemed agitated.

"How can he be considered young? Zhouming is at least always by my side, so I know his nature. I've observed Suiqing too. He isn't mischievous; he's malicious... How much can an old man like me change him?"

Suining was amazed by his sharp insight and drew a quiet breath, shaking his head inwardly.

'This is while King Wei is still around... Once he's gone, and the few Purple Mansion cultivators disappear or fall, that's when the real chaos will begin...'

As he was thinking, a cultivator in white robes rushed into the hall. He was an unfamiliar face with a low cultivation base. He announced himself three times before being allowed to enter, his face streaked with tears. He fell to his knees and cried out,

"Old Master... my old ancestor... he can't hold on any longer!"

Li Suining felt the old man before him freeze. Li Xuanxuan gasped for breath, stood up, and asked in a daze,

"Qiuyang... is it Qiuyang?"

The white-robed cultivator could only nod, sobbing. Tears welled in the old man's eyes.

"Qiuyang is even a few years older than me. It hasn't been easy... not easy at all! He was burned by the Merging Fire. Even with so many spiritual pills and Sun Bai's personal treatment, it only prolonged his suffering in his final years..."

A chill ran through Li Xuanxuan's limbs. He tossed the book onto the table and hurried out of the hall. Filled with concern, Li Suining quickly supported him, using the wind to help him along.

They flew all the way to the lakeshore before the old man seemed to come to his senses. Suining felt an icy grip on his wrist as the elder suddenly clutched his hand, choking back a sob in a state of bewildered helplessness.

"Suining... how much time do I have left to watch over you all? The Qingdu branch is arrogant, the Jade Court is strict, and the Daoist Masters only have eyes for a select few. Their minds are on heavenly matters. The day I'm gone... who will be there to unite the four branches of our family!"
