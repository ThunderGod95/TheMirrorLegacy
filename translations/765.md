# Chapter 765: Inquiries, Before and After

**Funan.**

The main mountain of Funan seemed much emptier than before. A young man in silver armor and black robes stood at the peak, with six ancient-style silver tokens hanging from his waist. His long spear was planted in the ground beside him, occasionally sparking with motes of lightning.

A woman in a red palace dress, holding a six-pointed brazier from which a feather-like flame danced, quickly ascended to join him. The young man looked up wearily, setting aside the thin paper in his hand.

"Elder Sister, you've come. Is Situ Mo here? What word from Weizeng?"

"No," Li Minggong shook her head, her expression heavy with worry. "There's no need to worry about Weizeng. Bringing him into the family back then was an exceptionally wise decision. He can hold his own now and is completely loyal. With him watching the front lines and us stabilizing the rear, Situ Mo will not move easily."

"I came this time because I received news from the main family..."

She handed the letter to Li Chenghui. The young man read it, his calm expression shifting to surprise. "Fu Jie was killed..."

They exchanged a look. Li Minggong sealed the hall doors and lowered her voice. "It no longer matters which young master is using this to weaken Profound Peak's prestige and influence. In short, the matter is trivial. What's important is Crimson Reef Island. Guo Hongjian appearing in person—that is a major event."

Li Chenghui read the letter twice more. "Jiangqian is ruthless, decisive, and willing to sacrifice Profound Peak. Jiangxia, though arrogant, prefers the open and righteous path and feels pity for the common people. This arrangement is correct. There is no need for us to be reassigned."

"As for Crimson Reef Island... let Guo Hongjian do as he pleases. The man doesn't look very bright; in truth, he relies entirely on Yehui's instructions. We can only wait."

Li Chenghui pondered this for a moment, confused. "But Capital immortals Dao is being far too polite to our family. Ever since they conquered the mountain gate, they haven't seemed particularly keen on avenging themselves against Profound Peak or Kong Haiying. Otherwise, why would there still be no reaction after all this time?"

Just as Li Minggong was about to answer, the hall fell deathly quiet. The great array shuddered slightly. The tightly sealed doors rattled violently, as if pushed by some unseen force.

*Creee...*

The hall doors swung open naturally, from the inside out. A cold wind rushed in from outside. Li Chenghui felt the wind, bone-chilling and sharp, and shot up from the main seat. His heart sank.

'Purple Mansion!'

To a Purple Mansion realm expert, the mountain's array was no different than air. For such a cultivator to bother pushing the door open upon entering was already a sign of considerable friendliness. Regardless of who the visitor was, neither of them had the right to remain standing. They moved to the side, bowing low to welcome the guest.

"We juniors of the Li clan respectfully welcome the Daoist Master," Li Minggong said deferentially. "We wonder which esteemed personage has graced us..."

A figure in a simple brown robe materialized before them, faintly radiating a profound and mysterious light. Neither sibling dared to look up.

"We pay our respects to the Daoist Master," Li Minggong said.

The Daoist Master's voice was surprisingly amiable, though it carried a heavy, deep resonance.

"No need for such ceremony! I am Sumian, the Abbot of Xuanmiao Temple. I searched the seas for several circles, but I never found a trace of the Daoist Master, so I came here to ask you two."

They quickly guided him to the main seat and stood respectfully to the side. Only then did they see the Daoist Master's true appearance: he was dressed as a layman, appearing middle-aged. Age did not show on his features, but his voice was deep.

"Rumors are flying everywhere, and going directly to the Lake is inconvenient. Seeing as you two are both here, I turned aside to ask... has Daoist Zhaojing returned?"

Li Minggong hesitated instantly. But facing a Daoist Master, she couldn't exchange a glance with her brother. In that brief moment of hesitation, Sumian sighed.

"No need to hide it. The sea is in chaos; I heard the news as well. Pursued by Changxiao. I am just asking for any sign, any trace of his whereabouts. Any small bit of news would keep the two of us from being this worried."

Li Chenghui couldn't coordinate a story with his sister, so he could only listen as Li Minggong replied, her voice fraught with worry, "Reporting to the Daoist Master, we have not returned to the Lake for several days, but we have received no news whatsoever of the Master's return... We do not know his current situation."

Sumian studied Li Minggong, as if discerning something. After a long moment, he demanded, "Then where is Li Zhouwei?! Things are in such a mess, and he still hasn't come out to stabilize the situation? Must he wait for Capital immortals Dao to attack?! Without him here to stand guard, how can a few of you possibly withstand their plots!"

At Sumian's sharp question, Li Minggong looked awkward. She had no choice but to answer, "The Family Head has gone into seclusion..."

Sumian flicked his sleeve, appearing impatient. "Any time would be better than this one! Your Lake is not some great nexus of spiritual qi; his breakthrough will probably take even longer!"

Li Minggong paused, then said hesitantly, "Yes... a breakthrough from Foundation Establishment can be long or short. We juniors cannot predict the time... Our direct lineage..."

"Enough!"

Sumian cut her off with a wave of his sleeve before she could finish. "You two just focus on defending Funan. You don't need to worry about the Wasteland. I will go find Yehui and ask him for the details."

The two quickly expressed their thanks. When they finished bowing and rose, the Daoist Master had already vanished. Li Chenghui felt a deep sense of unease. He hesitated twice, but the question he wanted to ask remained unspoken.

Li Minggong’s worry only deepened. She paced the hall anxiously. "Daoist Master Sumian usually manages nothing, but in a true crisis, he appears..."

Li Minggong stopped abruptly. Li Chenghui also looked up, thoughtful. He had detected a strange floral scent in the air. A clear breeze drifted in from the courtyard, hovered, and then coalesced in the hall, forming a person.

This woman wore an autumn-yellow satin robe embroidered with butterfly patterns. Her face was lovely, with thin eyebrows and two small dots of teal pigment at the corners of her eyes. The moment she appeared, she raised a hand to stop the siblings' movements, frowning.

"Chenghui... Minggong... it is you two, correct?"

They understood immediately: the previous Daoist Master had barely left, and a second one was already in their hall. They had no choice but to retreat to the side and bow respectfully. "We pay our respects to the Daoist Master."

The female Daoist Master kept frowning, though her voice was melodic and gentle. "Rise... I am Daoist Master Tinglan from the Purple Smoke Blessed Land. I have a question or two for you. There is no need for such ceremony."

She seemed to briefly scan the hall’s furnishings. "Has a Daoist Master with willow-leaf eyes, carrying a bright lantern, been here to find you?"

She paused for the briefest instant, then asked, "Never mind... *has any* Daoist Master been here to find you?"

Li Minggong replied respectfully, "Daoist Master Sumian was just here..."

She recounted the entire previous conversation. The female Daoist Master paced one step in the hall, then sat down in the main seat, silent.

Her makeup was exquisite. As she sat there quietly, she was as refined as a divine statue. Illuminated by the dawn light, a faint, weak rainbow halo pulsed behind her head. Daoist Master Tinglan’s expression, however, was not beautiful. Her eyes had even turned somewhat sinister.

The satin-robed Daoist Master narrowed her eyes slightly and spoke, enunciating every single word.

"I just came from Xuanmiao Temple. Old Daoist Master Qi is right there in the temple. He has not moved at all."
