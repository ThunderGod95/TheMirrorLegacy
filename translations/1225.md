# Chapter 1225: The Manor's Aid

The Absorbing Gold's Heavenly Profound Light held its radiance beneath the tongue, with the lips and teeth as its gate. Li Que'wan's spell had wiped away her opponent's lips and teeth, sealing the grand Dharma Art—which had been charged to its absolute limit and was ready to erupt—inside his own mouth. What other outcome was possible?

Qing Zhuo's Dao-Profundity was immense; he naturally understood this with perfect clarity.

‘This is far more than a simple backlash from a failed spell!’

Since beginning his cultivation in the mortal realm, he had never traversed the Great Void with such urgency. He pushed his movement technique to its absolute limit, just barely managing to touch the man's back as the golden light in his mouth reached its peak intensity.

As a direct descendant of the Qing clan, Qing Jifang's command of spell arts was certainly up to par. Yet, what stunned everyone was that the grand Dharma Art he had poured all his power into neither struck an enemy nor missed its mark—it detonated inside his own mouth.

A violent roar thundered across heaven and earth as the desert winds churned, giving rise to a terrifying golden storm.

This golden light concealed an infinite vitality, its radiance exceptionally brilliant, like bamboo shoots breaking through the soil after a spring rain. It scoured the sky with tens of thousands of blade-like lines that obscured the lightning fire, scattered the fire clouds, and surged toward the heavens!

A stillness fell over the great desert.

"Pfft!"

Amidst the world-shaking storm, Liu Changdie stood in the distance, his gaze filled with shock, feeling a sharp pain on his face as if it were being sliced by knives. He vaguely heard the low sound of someone spitting blood. Li Que'wan's own face turned pale as she suffered the backlash, coughing up a mouthful of golden blood!

‘Is that… a shamanic art?’

In an instant, all eyes shifted to the young woman's face, filled with utter shock.

‘To think such a shamanic art exists…’

Even Yehui, who had been completely suppressed but was still desperately holding back the Great Daoist Master, shifted his gaze, a strange light glinting in his pupils.

‘That Dao-Profundity… is by no means shallow!’

But these thoughts lasted only for an instant before a solemn, soft shout was heard from the sky.

"Settle!"

The voice was like a great bell, and the golden storm raging wildly across the sky was instantly pacified. The aftershocks of the spell dissipated into nothingness, revealing the man at its center.

It was Qing Zhuo.

The middle-aged Daoist Master wore a grave expression. One hand was pressed on Qing Jifang's shoulder, while the other was formed into a sword sign, pointed sideways before him. At his fingertips, an amber-like bead was spinning ceaselessly.

The bead was no larger than a fingernail, as warm and smooth as jade, yet its power radiated outward, blanketing the surroundings. It was this very treasure that had quelled the storm of golden qi in the world!

But Qing Jifang, protected by him, remained motionless.

The Great Shu general's clothes were intact and his posture was upright, seemingly unaffected in the slightest. But as one's gaze traveled upward, one would see that there was nothing above his shoulders. At his neck, there was only a pale-white windpipe and writhing flesh.

He looked just like a headless corpse!

Qing Zhuo was not surprised in the least; he even let out a slight sigh of relief.

The injuries Qing Jifang had sustained were no ordinary wounds; the Absorbing Gold's Heavenly Profound Light was not an external spell, but one that had exploded from the inside out! In that instant, Qing Jifang had endured not only the spell's backlash but also the divine ability of the Profound Light erupting from within!

‘To lose only his head is already a testament to this clan uncle's deep foundation and his extremely profound mastery of the art, which allowed him to suppress some of it!’

As this scene appeared before everyone, even Li Ximing, who had anticipated it, could not help but widen his eyes in secret delight.

"Excellent!"

How could he allow his opponent a moment's rest? While fending off the Spiritual Treasure, he had already shut his eyes to sense the Merging Fire!

That was right; in that brief moment, the Golden Kite Purple-Gold Alms Bowl that Qing Jifang had sent out to suppress the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire was already burning red-hot and trembling nonstop. The divine ability at the bowl's mouth was rapidly dissipating, allowing the bright white flames to leap out.

Qing Jifang himself knew that the Golden Kite Purple-Gold Alms Bowl could not hold back the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire for long and had intended to fight a decisive battle quickly. But how could he have anticipated such a turn of events, to be so miserably plotted against by a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with a single divine ability!

Qing Zhuo immediately frowned and sighed inwardly.

‘This clan uncle is still too arrogant! The Li family is furious, so much so that they won't even give a shred of face to my Mount Changhuai!’

Qing Zhuo actually held no ill will toward the Li clan. In fact, he was extremely supportive of this Bright Yang aristocratic family for diverting Mount Luoxia's energy, wishing the commotion they caused was as big as possible… but Qing Jifang's life was also his bottom line!

He moved his two fingers forward, and the amber-colored bead spun even more furiously, stopping before the Merging Fire. In an instant, a suppressive force descended, and the Merging Fire, which had been pouncing like a ravenous wolf, froze in mid-air, turning into a vivid tableau.

A full breath of time passed before Qing Jifang's fragile hands finally showed a slight movement. His little finger rose to touch his thumb, and immediately, the halo of a divine ability pulsed.

Divine Life Invocation.

In a flash, the man's figure transformed into a sky full of gray wind and soared upward. Clouds roiled in the sky, thick with a malevolent aura, as countless golden threads wove and shuttled through them, finally coalescing into a great Dharma Body clad in armor and robes!

This Dharma Body was brilliantly golden, as if condensed from golden threads, and as large as a mountain. It had even detached from the original body, gathering and tidying the chaotic dharma power. Only then did Qing Jifang finally catch his breath, his eyes filled with boundless shock and rage. Even his divine ability and dharma power trembled in the Great Void!

When he had fought Li Zhouwei back then, even if Qing Jifang had suffered a small loss, it was hidden away from others' sight. Even so, it had remained on his mind for many years…

‘Li Zhouwei is a White Qilin… a man on the verge of death. It's one thing for him to have his moment of glory, but a mere nobody… dares to plot against me…’

When had he, Qing Jifang, ever suffered such a loss, ever been so humiliated!

He soared into the air, but Qing Zhuo remained where he was, his gaze locked on him, seemingly wanting to say something but holding back. He finally shook his head with a sigh and stepped into the Great Void.

And all that remained in place was the single, spinning amber bead.

Qing Jifang, his heart filled with a wicked fire, caught the bead with one hand while stepping forward. The rope that had been suppressing Li Ximing also leaped up, moving recklessly towards Li Que'wan!

Li Que'wan had just been injured, so how could Liu Changdie ignore her? The divine ability that had long been gathering in his hands, a tapestry of colors, transformed into a disk-like silver pattern. He did not meet the speeding Spiritual Treasure head-on, but instead gently raised his hand and tapped Li Que'wan's body.

In an instant, Li Que'wan's presence vanished without a trace in the Great Void. A brilliant gate opened in the sky, locking away the cascading gray qi. She immediately understood, crossing two fingers before her as a bright moon lit up in each of her eyes!

Profound Bestowal Glazed Talisman.

The mysteries of the Supreme Yin responded, allowing her to evade the lock of various Spiritual Treasures. Li Que'wan's figure was like a drop of clear water merging into the great ocean, and she instantly vanished from the vast desert.

Li Ximing, on the other hand, having just escaped from under the Spiritual Treasure, was in no hurry to rescue his junior. Instead, he formed a hand seal to cast a spell. All sorts of crimson light coiled between his two fingers, coalescing into a golden light filled with runes. It was precisely the Great Parting Golden Radiance!

He made no attempt to hide his intention; he wanted to force Qing Jifang to intervene and interrupt him!

Qing Jifang's injuries had not yet healed, and his Spiritual Treasure had missed its mark. His heart was shrouded in gloom. His spiritual sense vibrated, transmitting his words with a divine ability, full of shock and anger.

"Danyin!"

These words struck the Great Daoist Master controlling his divine ability in the sky like a bolt of lightning. A deep shadow fell over the eyes of this pillar of the Sun clan; he understood that this was Qing Jifang's warning!

‘In his eyes, the fact that I've been held up by a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator for so long without being able to offer any support, not even from a distance, is already extreme negligence!’

If he still failed to provide aid, he would surely incur his resentment.

But the frustration in his, Danyin's, heart at this moment was no less.

‘Besides, who could have expected… that this Yehui was hiding his strength so deeply!’

Danyin and Yehui had once shared a karmic affinity. More accurately, it was a junior of the Sun clan, Daoist Master Shen Sou, who, at the first divine ability stage, had fought fiercely with Yehui over a spiritual item in the Eastern Sea. Danyin had intervened to assist, forcing the man to retreat.

At the time, Danyin had been quite dismissive in his heart.

‘The Capital Guard's lineage is incomplete within the Ancient Merging, and rogue cultivators are everywhere. To this day, there are few orthodoxies that have produced anyone who has achieved a divine ability… what future could it possibly have!’

But it was precisely this Daoist Master from an incomplete orthodoxy who had dealt him a heavy blow just as he broke through to become a Great Daoist Master, when his divine ability was at its most powerful in his entire life. 

The initial clash had even put him, Danyin, at a disadvantage… Qing Jifang's loss of face was one thing, but was he, Danyin, covered in glory?

His Gathering Wood Dao Lineage was skilled in defense and entrapment. Even if his strength was inferior, he could temporarily hold back an enemy. It was not like Upright Wood, which lacked the advantage of a swift and decisive battle… and facing lightning fire, he fought with a heart full of frustration!

As his four divine abilities manifested together, the Capital Guard's Daoist Master had fallen into a disadvantage and was even being heavily suppressed. Given a little more time, Danyin was confident he could land a heavy blow. But with Qing Jifang's order, he had no choice but to give up his great advantage, soaring up to provide urgent aid.

Gathering of Bitter Herbs!

His target was Li Ximing!

There was no other reason. Although Danyin did not recognize Liu Changdie, he did recognize the legendary Vault Metal Dao. Moreover, the man held a Spiritual Treasure. Who knew what power stood behind this middle-aged man who had come to help?

‘It’s better to target Li Ximing. We're already enemies, and at least I know what I'm dealing with!’

This divine ability responded extremely quickly. The turquoise ocean spread out once more, covered by thousands of plants and trees, carrying a strong intent of imprisonment and sealing. Li Ximing had fallen for this trick once before and knew he could not block this divine ability head-on. He took a single step, and flames flickered beneath his feet.

Tread on Flames!

Li Ximing had barely reached the entry-level of this Li Fire art in his early years, and in the time since, he had been either refining pills or practicing spells, so he had not improved much. But ultimately, it was enhanced by his fire control techniques, and Li Fire incinerated wood. Furthermore, Danyin was acting in haste, allowing him to escape in an instant!

But the newcomer was, after all, a Great Daoist Master. He faced him as if facing a great enemy, immediately dispersing the spell that was meant as a threat. As expected, what came for him was that ghostly figure, arriving by means of a divine ability.

Falcon's Roost.

Nearby, Qing Jifang had lost track of Li Que'wan. His gaze, sharp as a sword, flashed past Liu Changdie. The Spiritual Treasure, having failed to catch Li Que'wan, immediately moved to suppress Liu Changdie, who was closer. Meanwhile, he himself rushed towards Li Ximing in almost an instant.

Luminous Dredging!

The fine golden threads were much dimmer than before. They descended from the sky, falling towards Li Ximing, as his figure transformed into a gray wind and swept over.

With a Great Daoist Master and a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from a direct Golden Core lineage attacking together, Li Ximing felt a chill shoot up to his mind. A great sense of crisis arose. He pushed World's Radiance to its limit, successfully blocking the damaged and greatly weakened Luminous Dredging. Without hesitation, he activated the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass for a second time!

The stars in the sky suddenly shattered, and his figure shifted. Li Ximing moved horizontally several dozen feet. As he stabilized himself, the light waves of Shichuan surged, resisting the external enemy. At the same time, he unhesitatingly grabbed the Heavenly Yuwu Merging Fire and held it before him.

"Weng!"

As expected, a dark light flared, stabbing straight at his eyes. Burned by the Merging Fire and resisted by the light of the Supreme Yang Responding-to-Li, it finally dissipated. The aftershock still struck his face with searing pain, as if he had been burned by fire, and thick white smoke rose from it.

It was Danyin.

Li Ximing was now battle-hardened and had already seen his Falcon's Roost. He understood that the other had the miraculous ability to occupy the ground he had just left, waiting to ambush him. How could he fall for it!

At that moment, having extricated himself and gained a moment's respite, Yehui was already pursuing from afar to assist without any pause. A mountain conjured from the Great Void fell, suppressing the white jade fan that was about to land on Li Ximing's head. With his other hand, he pinched two talismans of lightning and fire, summoning a profound and mysterious light that landed on Li Ximing. He transmitted his voice with a divine ability, shouting sternly.

"Fellow Daoist Zhaojing!"

Both of them knew this was the most dangerous moment; a single misstep could be fatal. Li Ximing immediately relaxed his body and mind. He felt himself surrounded by purple water and supported by white qi, which moved him several feet, allowing him to narrowly avoid the radiance of the amber jade bead. Only the Qingchi was not fast enough and was fixed in place by this wondrous Spiritual Treasure!

Elsewhere, the Heavenly Nurture Urn hung high in the air, swallowing all the gray wind that descended from the sky.

But Li Ximing felt no joy at all. The Great Daoist Master's face had already appeared, the light between his brows condensed to an extreme. He stared straight at Li Ximing, making his hair stand on end with an infinite sense of crisis!

Although Yehui was a cunning person, he had given his word earlier, and now he was truly doing his best. His face grew cold and frosty. The golden light in his eyes exploded, erupting with a blood-red color, forcefully holding the Great Daoist Master, who had pushed his divine ability to its limit, in place. 

His own divine ability still pushed Li Ximing back, protecting him from behind, his eyes sinister and frigid.

‘The person I, Bai Ziyu, want to protect—you think a piece of trash like you can touch him!’

The hand he had been preparing behind his back had already moved to the front, shining with an earthy yellow light.

Three Abodes.

The iridescent light surged out, landing entirely on the Great Daoist Master's eyes. Danyin, unable to move, was struck squarely. But his Gathering Wood divine ability responded, causing his eyes to dissolve, and a new pair grew in the empty sockets, completely unharmed.

Yehui, however, was only using this as a delaying tactic, his own heart filled with an infinite sense of crisis—Qing Jifang was already descending from the sky with boundless rage. He had actually abandoned Li Ximing. The amber bead in his hand spun, not only immobilizing him but also striking towards his temple!

‘It's the Heavenly Amber Heart-Sacrifice Pearl! I absolutely cannot let it enter my body. If I'm careless and get hit by this move, it will be a fatal disaster!’

He forcefully twisted his head, trying to avoid the critical temple area, while urgently recalling his Spiritual Treasure for aid. Just at this critical moment, a swath of purple lightning appeared in the sky. A lightning mace descended from above, while another point of silver light appeared in front of Qing Jifang. That pretty face was icy cold.

Awaiting the Supreme Divine!

The Divine Corpse suddenly appeared, shaking both inside and out!

‘I've been waiting for you!’

A surging killing intent erupted from Qing Jifang's Dharma Body, which was entwined with golden threads. Although he was held in place by the divine ability, a single golden thread suddenly descended on the woman's head, connecting straight to the sky. Above the clouds, his headless true body appeared, the divine ability in its hands, which had been gathering power for a long time, suddenly flared brightly!

He, Qing Jifang, had been waiting for a long time!

Li Que'wan felt all the divine ability and dharma power in her body surge towards the top of her head. For a moment, she could not move. Her face was cold, and she raised her hand with apparent difficulty, looking as if she could only await her death, but her heart was completely calm.

A white-haired figure abruptly appeared before her, blocking the path of the divine ability. A hand full of wrinkles was already gripping the hilt of the sword at his waist, drawing a longsword that carried with it rolling waves.

Daoist Master Yushui, Chen Yin!

The old man's face was fierce, his gaze filled with hatred as he looked at the figure in the sky. His divine ability was already operating at its peak, and rolling Mansion Water poured forth, condensing before him into a vast, seemingly solid abyss of water.

This sword cultivator, who had attained the Dao many years ago, carried a chilling killing intent and hatred. The light of the spiritual sword in his hand was brilliant, tinged with a faint blood color. It split from one into a hundred, and from a hundred into a thousand. The countless streams of sword qi that gushed out were like surging waves, actually severing the Earth Virtue divine ability that descended from the sky.

‘Hundred-Light Fractal Sword Art!’
