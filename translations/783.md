# Chapter 783: Good Tidings from Purple Smoke

Swirls of purple qi permeated the air as an ancient, long boat hovered silently. The lake below reflected its violet hue. Standing on the deck was a girl in a pink skirt, gazing into the distance. Her face was round, her ears small and delicate. This was Li Queyi, the second young lady of the Jiangque generation.

Li Queyi stood upon the deck, surrounded by the other young girls who looked to her as their elder sister. They had clearly failed to gain entry to the sect; their spirits were low, and they kept their heads down, afraid to speak.

As Li Queyi felt the spiritual boat move beneath her feet, her own anxiety grew. They were returning from the Purple Smoke Blessed Land, personally escorted by the sect itself—an impressive honor. But the significance of this spirit boat was complex. Where it chose to land—hovering over the lake versus settling upon the isle—was a delicate matter of protocol. With the Li family’s Purple Mansion expert missing, their clan could not afford any further loss of prestige.

As Li Queyi fretted, another girl at her side—this one possessing a slightly colder demeanor—spoke up. She looked to be only eleven or twelve; though her features had yet to fully mature, their refined beauty was already apparent. Head held high, her face beaming with undisguised pride, she whispered to a companion:

"So *that* was the Purple Smoke Blessed Land... What an incredible place! I doubt even the cultivation grounds of celestial fairies or divine maidens could be any better than this!"

Li Queyi shot her a nervous glance before quickly turning her gaze forward again. She didn't relax until the spiritual boat finally settled upon the isle, landing softly on the ground. When she saw the Purple Smoke Gate cultivators disembark on their own, making no demands for a formal reception, she finally breathed a quiet sigh of relief. Lowering her gaze submissively, she followed them off the boat.

"Greetings, fellow Daoists!"

An elderly man dressed in dark blue robes moved forward to receive them. The young cultivator leading the Purple Smoke delegation didn't recognize him. Confused as to why the Li hadn't sent a Foundation Establishment expert to greet them, he nonetheless maintained a welcoming smile and offered enthusiastic congratulations. "Senior! This is wonderful news! Your esteemed clan having two disciples accepted by our gate is truly a joyous occasion."

The elder seemed momentarily startled, but his face quickly broke into a broad smile. The children were ushered forward, dispersing like running water, until only two girls remained before the hall: one older, perhaps seventeen or eighteen, and one barely past her tenth year.

The girl in the pink skirt was, naturally, Li Queyi. Li Xuanxuan wasn't surprised; among the girls of her generation, Li Queyi’s talent was second only to the eldest, Li Quewan. The family had pinned their hopes on her. He nodded, smiling in approval.

The second girl, however, was unexpected. She was the young daughter of a remote lineage within the First Branch, dressed in white robes that matched her aloof temperament. Li Xuanxuan had met all the candidates; he recognized her as Li Quexi. Because she had been brought in from outside the main isle, her generational name had been added later, and it didn't adhere to the standard conventions of the four main branches.

"Excellent! Excellent!" Li Xuanxuan was genuinely delighted.

The cultivator opposite him, however, froze. Someone in the delegation had clearly recognized the elder and was stunned that Li Xuanxuan himself had come. Unsure how to properly address him given the circumstances, they hesitated for several breaths before pushing Ling Yanzi forward.

This man was ancient. Years ago, after being hunted by the Changxiao Gate, he had fled until Li Tongya saved his life. He had visited the Li family then, and now he was here to accept a disciple.

Li Xuanxuan bowed deeply. "Senior... I trust you have been well since we last met."

Ling Yanzi’s hair and beard were snow-white, and he clutched a simple wooden staff. His eyes filled with complex emotions as he nodded silently.

He had met the members of the Xuan generation before. He remembered the youthful Li Xuanfeng and Li Xuanling, how they had joked with him. Back then, Ling Yanzi had just escaped death and was recuperating on Mount Lijing. He vividly recalled the steady strength of the middle-aged patriarch and the vibrant, ambitious energy of the youths. Now, looking up, all that remained before him was this frail, withered elder.

"You are... Xuanxuan... the eldest brother..." Ling Yanzi mumbled.

Li Xuanxuan nodded softly. "The old senior still remembers. Of those who were on the mountain that day, I am the only one left."

"I remember," Ling Yanzi’s voice was hoarse with age and memory. "A brush with death... how could I forget?"

The two men looked at each other, seeing both a stranger and a familiar ghost. Their attempts at pleasantries felt hollow, lacking genuine warmth, laced instead with a subtle, shared dread. They were two souls who had barely clung to life against the ravages of time, each terrified the other might speak a memory that cut like a needle.

An awkward silence stretched between them. Seeing this, Li Zhouluo, standing just behind, quickly stepped forward. "Esteemed elders, please continue your conversation," he said respectfully. "This junior can handle the arrangements here."

Li Xuanxuan indeed had matters to discuss with Ling Yanzi, and the two elders made their way toward the main hall. Just then, Li Quewan and Jiangxia arrived, riding the wind. They began arranging accommodations for the Purple Smoke disciples. The Foundation Establishment expert who had led the delegation smiled amiably at Li Zhouluo. "This one is Wen Wu, a cultivator from Mu Zuo Peak. I specifically requested this mission to meet the Clan Head, as there is a particular reason..."

He clasped one hand behind his back, walking casually as he chatted with Li Zhouluo. It was rare to see a male cultivator from the Purple Smoke Gate. "The situation is rather interesting," he smiled. "Your disciples originally came to Ziqi Peak seeking apprenticeship. Your Li Queyi, despite being slightly older, is already condensing Qi—specifically, Jade True Qi. Since our sect has several compatible cultivation methods, it wasn't considered a conflict, and she earned Senior Ling Yanzi’s approval."

"But then, unexpectedly, after Li Queyi had been accepted, my own master—Peak Lord Qian Lizi of Mu Zuo Peak—happened to visit. She saw Li Quexi and immediately took a liking to her. She petitioned the Gate Master directly and accepted her as a disciple."

Wen Wu looked vibrant, and his eyes, which seemed enhanced by some ocular art, flowed with light. A clear joy was visible in his gaze as he spoke softly. "This is truly a wonderful stroke of fate. As the Eldest Disciple of my peak, I felt it necessary to come to the isle personally. First, to inform the Clan Head and observe the proper etiquette. Second, I needed to meet her family members and explain the situation clearly."

Li Zhouluo instantly understood and nodded inwardly. "This is wonderful news," he smiled. "Since Senior is being so considerate, I will personally guide you to meet them on the isle."

Mu Zuo Peak was clearly in a different league than Ling Yanzi’s Ziqi Peak, which had nearly seen its lineage severed multiple times. Peak Lord Qian Lizi was a renowned Foundation Establishment expert, known by the title "Treasured Vase." The fact that this Eldest Disciple, Wen Wu, was himself at the late stage of Foundation Establishment spoke volumes about the peak's strength.

Furthermore, despite the chaotic reception, Li Zhouluo had clearly observed that Ling Yanzi—a Peak Lord and a sect elder—had walked half a step *behind* Wen Wu. The other Purple Smoke cultivators all deferred to Wen Wu as their leader. Clearly, this Eldest Disciple's status was exceptionally high.

'I wonder if a Daoist Master intentionally arranged this... Regardless, having one more disciple accepted is undoubtedly a good thing.'

This was the first good news Li Zhouluo had received in days, and he felt a weight lift from his shoulders. Beside him, his elder sister, Li Quewan, held Li Queyi with one hand and Li Quexi with the other. Her thoughts, however, took a darker turn.

'From what I know of Ling Yanzi’s disciples... every one of them has either shallow cultivation or has hit a bottleneck they can't surpass. I suspect the only reason that old man chose Queyi is because her talent is high *and* she's already at the Qi Refining realm. If he'd taken an Embryonic Breathing novice, he'd likely die of old age before she ever reached Foundation Establishment.'

'Looking at how powerful Mu Zuo Peak is now, and how pathetic Ziqi Peak has become... Ling Yanzi doesn't have many years left to protect anyone. In the future, the lives and treatment these two sisters receive... I fear they will be separated by a gulf as wide as heaven and earth.'
