# Chapter 1214 Xiao Pass

Li Que'wan's answer came tumbling out, but in the next instant, she frowned and said:

"But there is one thing I don't understand. Old Daoist Master Chen's family name… is that of the Yuyang Chen Clan. Although there are rumors that their Dao lineagers are somewhat similar… Mansion Water is the Chen Clan's Great Dao… but in the end, there is no conclusive evidence."

Li Jiangqian said nothing, instead producing a map of the mainland and overseas with a turn of his hand. He examined it in detail, the contemplation in his eyes growing ever deeper, and said in a low voice:

"There's more to it. Although that clan is said to have no connection with Lingyu Gate, in my view, they are merely afraid of karma, just like another Tanshan Li Clan."

Li Que'wan frowned:

"How can you tell?"

Her elder brother paced, a look of gradual understanding dawning in his eyes as he said in a heavy voice:

"Because of the Great Song."

"Back then, the arrangement of power in Jiangnan seemed to have formed naturally, but to say the Yang Clan used no methods to achieve it is utterly impossible. Since the Underworld intends to walk the path of True Qi, their present scheme was not planned in a single day."

His gaze was sharp as he said seriously:

"Do you remember how the Ning State was established?"

Li Que'wan focused her thoughts:

"True Qi… the Wanling Immortal Sect…"

She understood that her brother was definitely not talking about these two widely known facts. After a slight pause, she said:

"The great families?"

"Correct."

Li Jiangqian said softly:

"Ostensibly, the Great Ning was the result of the great families' joint support. The prominent families of the Ning State in those years were few, led by the Li and Jiang, and assisted by the Sima, Chen, Su, and Xi, followed by others like the Xiao, Ruan, and Quan… all in all… Look at these first few surnames; besides the imperial Jiang Clan, almost all of them now have Daoist Masters or entire clans! And even for the surnames from which only a few scattered individuals survived, most now hold official posts in the court… Do you remember Quan Yuduan, that disciple of the Grand Uncle from overseas? Even he received a fiefdom long ago."

"The new dynasty must also have the old ministers of True Qi that the Ning State possessed. The great ones have been secretly protecting the noble families of the Great Ning one by one, which is why Mount Changhuai nurtured these nine surnames. There is definitely a bloodline connection here. The Yue State probably had the same idea, but their plans were simply disrupted by the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition…"

"But the Yang Clan's arrangements in all this were also numerous. The Sima Family goes without saying. The Chunyi Dao Gate said my Li Clan also has the blood of the Ning State's Li, and the Su Clan was taken by the Wu State… If the Wuzhu Gate and Hongxue immortal sects hadn't been carved up back then, perhaps there would be even more today…"

His expression was grave as he said:

"I hadn't noticed anything at first, but now I've secretly learned from Cheng Qian that the Great Song wants to seize Overlook Peak and establish a so-called protectorate-general. It's impossible that they don't covet the nearby seas at all. With the Chunyi Dao Gate right under their noses, could they abandon their ancestral foundation and relocate the entire sect? This matter of Overlook Peak is a case of the drinker's heart not being in the cup; the true target is the Xi Clan!"

Li Que'wan said in a low voice:

"And the Chen Clan… must it also be the Chen Clan of old?"

Li Jiangqian nodded slightly. Li Que'wan silently drew a breath and said:

"In that case… for the Xiao Clan to withdraw from Jiangnan… wasn't that an incredibly risky move? How did Old Daoist Master Xiao manage it!"

Li Jiangqian's expression was grave as he slowly shook his head.

Xiao Chuting had once been an important backer for the Li Clan. A single marriage contract had been of great help to the Li Clan in its early years, to the point that even today's fourth branch contained the blood of the Xiao family… And his methods were heard of and quite feared even by juniors like Li Que'wan and Li Jiangqian, who had never met him.

Now that Li Que'wan had mentioned it, Li Jiangqian simply clasped his hands behind his back and nodded, his gaze peculiar:

"It's hard to say how the Xiao Clan extricated themselves, but if so, then I miscalculated before… Chen Yin has campaigned in all directions and is often wounded, yet he was able to perfect his third divine ability in just over twenty years. This is definitely not a matter of exhausting his foundation… but rather… the support of the Xiao Clan!"

His golden eyes flickered slightly:

"Don't forget… this Daoist Master Xiao… before my Li Clan had even risen, was an alchemy master renowned throughout Jiangnan… He has likely already become a Great Daoist Master by now. With his support, for Chen Yin to merely perfect a divine ability—not condense one—it's not strange for his progress to be unstoppable."

Only then did Li Que'wan nod, her expression strange, and said:

"The Chunyi Dao Gate hinted to our family that Daoist Master Xiao might intend to compete for the Lingyu inheritance. Could he be planning for this matter? If Chen Yin were to become a Great Daoist Master and join forces with him… there would indeed be a much greater chance of success."

These words left her brother unsettled for a long time. He shook his head with some hesitation and said softly:

"I don't think so… First… judging from Zhang Duanyan's attitude back then, the Golden Feather's regard for Su Yan is definitely not low. This matter would certainly offend the Golden Feather Sect. Chen Yin is willing to risk his life for his clan, but he would absolutely not do something with endlessly disastrous consequences for Xiao Chuting."

He shook his head lightly and continued:

"Second… the Golden Feather Sect controls all eight directions. Chen Yin's affairs may seem secretive, but how could they not know? They won't just stand by and watch Chen and Xiao join forces."

"This matter… is by no means simple."

Li Que'wan frowned and said:

"Regardless… between the Xiao Clan and the Golden Feather, there will most likely be a struggle. Otherwise, the Zhang family wouldn't have repeatedly, intentionally or not, brought Su Yan to the lake, and even offered reminders. The past relationship between the Xiao and Li is also a factor. If that day truly comes, how should our family conduct itself?"

These words made Li Jiangqian's expression turn grim. He understood the Golden Feather's methods and couldn't afford to offend this former backer. He knew in his heart that his own elders were even more unwilling to let the Xiao family down. He only sighed and said:

"Right now, we're busy dealing with the Western Shu affair, so let's not rush. After this great battle is over and your existence is known throughout the Song state, by all reason and sentiment, we on the lake should hold a grand event. At that time, we'll discuss it properly with Grand Uncle and Father, and use the opportunity to invite the Xiao family…"

"No matter which side we support, we must have a plan in mind!"

Although half of Li Que'wan's own fortune and Dao path rested in the Golden Feather's hands, she was absolutely unwilling for her family to do anything that would grieve their allies and gladden their enemies on her account. She nodded silently, then took her leave and departed for the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, leaving Li Jiangqian standing on the mountain, his expression slightly grim:

'Xiao Chuting… it seems he has the heart for seeking the Dao…'

'Does he seek the orthodox position… or does he wish to become a second Yuanxiu?'

The light in his eyes burned, gradually changing:

'Kan (Pit) and Li, water and fire, generate and overcome one another. Since both are of an orthodox nature, if I can witness his Quest for Gold, perhaps it would be of great help to me…'

Li Jiangqian sat quietly. He didn't know how much time had passed before he heard the sound of footsteps on the mountain. Ding Weizeng hurried over, bowed before him, and said in a deep voice:

"Reporting to the Daoist Master! A day ago, the Western Shu launched a major military campaign, exiting from Kuimen and sending troops to the Xingyuan Dao of the Zhao State. They have broken through several passes and are now in a great battle with the Zhao State at Mount Xiao!"

Li Jiangqian rose abruptly, his expression changing slightly as he asked:

"How many Daoist Masters?!"

Ding Weizeng's face was grave as he replied:

"Looking northwest from the great desert, the heavens and earth are five-colored, interweaving and blending, countless to behold."

…

The night was pitch-black, and a fierce wind rolled. A mountain range like a colossal dragon rose and fell between heaven and earth, but in the sky floated countless gray clouds, like a vast, boundless gray sea, all of it held back beyond this mountain range.

A Daoist Master upon the clouds had a cold and gloomy expression. He stood with his hands behind his back, looking silently at the few great formations that dotted the mountain range, shining brilliantly.

'So this is Mount Xiao.'

Qing Jifang had always been an extremely arrogant man. As a direct descendant of the Qing Clan and the sole heir of a Great Daoist Master, he was qualified to look down on ninety-nine percent of the cultivators in the world. But in this war against Zhao, Qing Jifang had, for once, lowered his stance and applied all of his mental energy.

'The people of the nine surnames are all here. Although their numbers in the Purple Mansion Realm are few, there are still six of them… The people of the four sects were useless and were absorbed into the imperial court early on. Adding the cultivators from my Changhuai, and excluding the few guarding against the Song state, almost all the Daoist Masters of the entire Western Shu are here!'

Changhuai's accumulated power from dominating Shu for so many years was no empty boast. For this campaign, there were three Great Daoist Masters alone. Besides the newly ascended Old Daoist Master Sun, head of the nine surnames, and Daoist Master Wu Gan from the palace, they had even deployed one of Changhuai's very own Great Daoist Masters, Ping Yan!

'I waited these extra few years precisely to turn one Great Daoist Master into three, plus the numerous other forces… If we had set out from Tongmo… it would have been enough to smash through the Song state… yet we still cannot conquer this place…'

The facts were cold and merciless. The magnificent mountain before him, stretching endlessly and seeming to cleave the world in half, fortified by a top-tier great formation from the previous dynasty, still stood before him like an iron wall. Such a surprise attack could not shake this natural chasm. In fact, as reinforcements from the Zhao State continuously arrived, the hope of passing through this place grew ever smaller.

Qing Jifang didn't feel he was inferior to Yang Ruiyi, yet that lucky fellow, who in his eyes possessed mediocre talent and had been reluctantly propped into his position, had pacified Jianghuai. Meanwhile, he himself, full of ambition, had been beaten bloody against this barrier. This plunged his mood into a deep gloom, as if he were ready to devour someone at any moment.

The cultivator by his side was extremely tall, with a long beard, well-defined eyebrows, and a refined appearance, but on his back he carried a long saber. His expression was placid, yet his cultivation was shockingly that of a Great Daoist Master. He turned slightly and said:

"Your Highness need not be so troubled."

He was a Great Daoist Master, after all. Seeing him speak, Qing Jifang had to show some courtesy, shaking his head with a sullen face.

This Daoist Master Wu Gan saw his expression and sighed silently to himself.

Compared to the Great Song, the Western Shu was naturally at a geographical disadvantage. What kind of place was Jianghuai? To put it bluntly, aside from its sabers, Jianghuai had no magnificent mountains worth mentioning. But what kind of place was Mount Xiao?

'The place where the Wei Emperor rose to power… Throughout the entire Wei dynasty, through successive monarchs, territory was gained and lost, yet no one was ever able to cross this magnificent mountain from the south. Even when Wei fell, and the Qi Emperor fought all the way to Guanlong… the pass was completely unguarded, and still the rebel armies from the land of Shu could only mill about here…'

This was also why territory constantly shifted between the Song and Zhao, and why the Shu kingdom's attacks could only ever delay the Zhao people. Back then, the Wei state had to have High Radiance True Monarch personally oversee Jianghuai, but they never paid any mind to what lay beyond Mount Xiao. What's more, behind the mountain now was the capital of Great Zhao. For Qing Jifang to try and cross this place, did he really think the Zhao court was full of dead men?

'Spoiled rotten, that's what he is. Utterly consumed by arrogance.'

He waited for a moment, but the man before him remained silent, so he had no choice but to speak again:

"It is not advisable to delay here for too long. I fear it will ruin the situation, and we will return with nothing to show for our efforts."

Qing Jifang's expression was icy as he said faintly:

"What the Great Daoist Master says is correct. But if we set out to the east, the march would be long, and we would be attacking Luoxia. Even if our strength is such that we don't fear an attack on Shu… and even if we could conquer it, could we hold it?"

"If we cannot hold it and ultimately have to withdraw, wouldn't we just be destroying the great families of Luoxia first, letting the Great Song pick up an easy bargain?"

Wu Gan was silent for a moment.

In truth, Qing Jifang's reasoning was not wrong. The Underworld's schemes were extremely insidious. Moongaze Lake could be said to be blocking the east entirely. The Wei state in this ancient land of Jing Province was a layout that Luoxia had personally overseen, almost cutting off any possibility of the Western Shu advancing eastward. Coupled with the Golden Feather within and Mount Xiao without, it was like a cage trapping the Western Shu.

'And whose fault is it that you fought the White Victory Dao for so many years, yet still failed to open up a detour from the west into the northern Long lands… You even have to pass through the territory of the Xiangxiong Kingdom each time.'

He could only reply:

"Entering Luoxia doesn't necessarily mean we have to slaughter everyone… Great Zhao is weak right now. We could simply relocate the populace into Shu and absorb those few Purple Mansion Realm families from the Central Plains… That would also count as cultivating martial virtue."

Wu Gan's insight was extremely keen, and this was almost the best path forward. Yet Qing Jifang turned a deaf ear to his words, looking down at the mountains and rivers before him without saying a word. Suddenly, someone came up and stopped before them, wreathed in lightning. It was none other than Li Muyan.

This Daoist Master looked to have recovered greatly from his injuries. He said in a low voice:

"Your Highness, Chen Yin has left Yuyang. He should have already gone to Moongaze Lake to stand guard."

As soon as these words were spoken, Qing Jifang's expression became even more unsightly. A hint of ruthlessness appeared in his eyes as he said faintly:

"The reason I didn't enter Luoxia from Xiaoshi is that Xiaoshi is on the Song border. I was afraid of alerting Moongaze and the Song court, causing them to dispatch Daoist Masters to that area… so that we wouldn't be too passive when the time comes to attack the lake…"

"I never thought… that Li Jiangqian… would react so quickly… Fortunately… the Song court has yet to respond."

Only then did Wu Gan understand that this Highness was still scheming against Moongaze Lake. He was speechless for a moment, then replied:

"Your Highness means to say…"

Qing Jifang's gaze gradually grew cold. He turned around and said faintly:

"If we can't take Mount Xiao, so be it. We'll take the old road. Have Old Daoist Master Sun take a detour through the highlands, and I will arrive immediately…"

"Li Muyan!"

As he spoke, the Daoist Master beside him quickly responded. Qing Jifang said grimly:

"You will take some men to Tongmo and harass the Chen Clan. You must keep the Great Song's attention fixed on the southwest. Make a great commotion… It would be best if you could force the Song court to question Chen Yin."

Li Muyan could tell at once that this was a task that would offend people. He secretly gritted his teeth, but his face gave a solemn nod. As Qing Jifang drew out a pearl-like Spiritual Treasure, he continued faintly:

"You will wait there. Find out how many cultivators are on guard. If Chen Yin returns, then we'll consider his Chen family sensible… When I move my army back, someone will take your place. For now, attract the main forces of the Song state in Tongmo…"

Li Muyan nodded quickly and said in a low voice:

"And if he… is dead set on not going back?"

"Not going back?"

Qing Jifang began to laugh, his icy gaze holding a faint trace of anger as he said faintly:

"Then we'll reverse it. This time when the army returns, the north will draw their attention. Moongaze need only destroy the great formation; no need for casualties. Two Great Daoist Masters will rapidly head south to break through Yuyang with you—Yuyang doesn't have as many rules as Moongaze Lake, nor any Bright Yang they're afraid of being destroyed. As many people as we send can go, as long as they withdraw in time."

Qing Jifang was an extremely murderous person, and when he vented his anger, he did so completely on a whim, without reason. As soon as he said this, both Li Muyan and Wu Gan's faces changed. One feared the retaliation of an unattached mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, while the other understood that Mount Changhuai wouldn't want to dirty its own hands and would definitely send him, which would surely harm the cosmic harmony and sully his reputation!

Li Muyan didn't dare to object, but Wu Gan spoke with a grave expression, his voice soft:

"Your Highness, the Chen Clan is…"

"How could I not know! We're not killing Chen Yin and that Holder of the Profound, just destroying formations and killing cultivators. It's not as if we're wiping out their entire clan. Why so many taboos!"

Qing Jifang's figure had already vanished into the distance, leaving only a cold voice hanging in mid-air:

"Old Daoist Master Sun and fellow Daoist Shen Sou must be greatly looking forward to this. Doesn't Chen Yin love to guard the lake for another family? Then let him guard it to his heart's content."
