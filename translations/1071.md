# Chapter 1071: Casting Out Dissidents

The hand fled frantically through the air, pursued by two layers of hazy grey light. Changyun needed only a single glance to understand the situation.

His origins were lofty, and he had cultivated his eyes with special spiritual items. Combined with an exceptionally high-grade technique, he could see through transformations even a Great Daoist Master might cast. He was not fooled.

He recognized Minghui instantly. With a flick of his sleeve, a white umbrella slid free and unfurled in the air.

The moment the umbrella opened, twelve-colored light burst from its ribs and slammed headlong into the seemingly weak grey light. A thunderous crash echoed out. Three autumn leaves, each as large as a man's head, came spiraling down, buffeted by a gentle breeze.

But from these leaves, three winds erupted—one blue-grey, one jet-black, and one grey-white. They swept down from above, making the earth tremble. Clumps of black soil surged into the sky as a massive hurricane rose from the flat ground.

The arcane wind's power was immense. The umbrella immediately issued a strained creak, and Changyun's expression turned grave. He pinched a talisman between two fingers to block the heavy yin mist, then raised his other hand and called out in a low voice:

“Minghui!”

Minghui had indeed lost his dharma-body, reduced to a single arm. A pair of eyes and a mouth had been carved into the palm, and the terror in his expression was still visible. He cried out in a desperate voice:

“Daoist Master, save my disciple-brother!”

But Changyun's expression turned suspicious. “Who is attacking?”

Minghui, still shaken, cried,

“You ask me? Who can I ask? The Untraceable Presence is upon them! If it's not Yang Ruiyi, who else could it be!”

Changyun recognized the tone was genuine and his heart eased. After another careful inspection, he gripped the white umbrella, formed an incantation with two fingers, and touched them to his brow.

Using his divine ability and spell arts, he gazed into the distance. He found the area had become a hazy grey expanse, like a ghostly region of the Underworld. Countless skeletal ghosts climbed over one another, their tangled bodies forming a sky-piercing mountain. Above, thousands upon thousands of kites, owls, dark crows, and vicious raptors wheeled in the gloom. Only a pale white temple stood at the mountain's peak, looking as if it might collapse at any moment.

Changyun's vigilance intensified. He shifted his gaze abruptly and, just as he suspected, saw a Bronze Xuanming Chariot standing at the highest point. Long bronze steps snaked down from it, flanked by green lanterns burning with pale blue flames.

‘Yang Ruiyi...’

Changyun's brows furrowed. He stood firm under the white umbrella, but his sense of wrongness peaked.

He had originally assumed Yang Ruiyi was using the Great Song's full might to strike north, using Moongaze Lake to pin down Vast Cicada. The goal, he thought, was for a lone army to penetrate deep and split the east from the west. And yet, Yang Ruiyi's true self was still here!

He had to understand, both Minghui and he had based their agreement on the assumption that Yang Ruiyi would _lead_ an attack here. Minghui and his disciple-brother would suffer a total defeat, and Changyun would swoop in to save them... They weren't supposed to be stubbornly holding out for reinforcements!

This meant the all-out attacks from Li Ximing, Tinglan, and the others had failed to buy Yang Ruiyi his opening into the north. He hadn't even made it halfway across Jiangbei.

Once the many Daoist Masters from the north gathered, Yang Ruiyi, whose forces were already far inferior, would undoubtedly be forced to return empty-handed. The south might even suffer a grievous blow to its vitality!

‘Could it be? Did Yang Ruiyi's gamble backfire spectacularly...’

He immediately shifted his gaze to the mountain peak, to the brightly shining temple. There were no figures inside, only the bones of monks and scattered golden robes. Atop a mountain of corpses sat a single monk, perfectly upright. His face was pale, but he was stubbornly chanting the Classics.

‘It's Mingxiang.’

Changyun was on good terms with the Lotus Temple and naturally recognized this rising star. Mingxiang hadn't used his full strength in the great battle on the lake, but Changyun estimated his power was second only to Vast Cicada and Zhelu!

But even if Changyun had overestimated him, a doubt now surfaced, and he shuddered in alarm:

‘It must be a trick! That's not Yang Ruiyi inside!’

The Exiled Qi in Yang Ruiyi's possession could be ranked as the Dao Lineage most antithetical to Buddhist cultivators. When that Exiled Qi Spiritual Treasure suppressed an area, it was enough to completely sever any Buddhist cultivator not at the Maha or Liangli level from the Buddhist Land, making it impossible for them to borrow even a shred of power. Mingxiang wasn't Jinlian; it was absolutely impossible for him to hold out this long unscathed!

The pitch-black baleful qi in the sky grew infinitely dense. Changyun spun around, noticing the path he had taken was disappearing bit by bit. Yet, he didn't immediately move to leave. Instead, a thoughtful expression crossed his face.

“Daoist Friend Changyun!”

The astonishment and doubt on Changyun's face vanished. He looked down, pensive, only to see the expression on the hand in his sleeve suddenly freeze. A crimson light flared within its two eerie eyes, shining straight into his!

“You!”

The Daoist Master's figure froze. He hesitated for a split second, but the hand in his other sleeve, pinching a talisman, finally relaxed. Gritting his teeth, he squeezed his eyes shut and activated his divine ability!

“Pfft!”

Even though Changyun was a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with an extremely strong Dharma Body, he couldn't withstand such a strike while undefended. His shimmering silver eyes shattered instantly. Two streams of golden blood trickled from their corners. He had lost his eyes!

He cried out in pain and decisively raised his arm, striking the severed hand with his sleeve. Golden light shattered and black energy dispersed amidst screams echoing from all directions. Changyun's chance to escape had vanished. He held nothing back, roaring in fury:

“You dare deceive me with a transformation art!”

The yin qi in the sky pressed down. Six talismans flew out one by one from the tightly shut bronze door, scattering innumerable spirits that converged to suppress Changyun.

The white light from the temple grew dimmer, but with Changyun now sharing the burden, it gained a moment's respite. Mingxiang sat cross-legged before the temple, hands pressed together, his face a mask of piousness.

Minghui's severed limb had been shattered by Changyun's palm, but Mingxiang showed not the slightest grief. He only sneered inwardly:

‘Junior Brother, it seems he's understood!’

As he sneered, a small segment of golden nasal bone was revealed within his robes. It buzzed, using wondrous dharma power to transmit Minghui's thoughts:

‘Changyun is clever. He already knows the one in this territory isn't Yang Ruiyi. But it's not just us who hate Qi Lanyan! Changyun was forcibly summoned here by him; what good feelings could he have? He's even less willing to offend the south. So, he quickly destroyed his own dharma-eyes to withdraw from the front lines. Now he has a perfect excuse for "failing" to recognize Yang Ruiyi!’

Changyun's dharma-eyes were powerful. What fell into his robes just now wasn't a transformation art at all, but a device from Minghui himself. It was secret collusion, all to help Changyun shed responsibility!

‘Right now, my dharma-body is "destroyed" from resisting the south. Master will have a reason to protect us. Once the Exiled Qi seals this place, who will know what really happened? Can they pin this on us?’

His voice grew colder as he laughed viciously.


‘Let Mount Dayang and Qi Lanyan find nothing! Let Yang Ruiyi give them a heavy blow! You lot from Mount Dayang... did you think my disciple-brother and I are made of clay? If we were really just dogs and horses for you to command... then my Way of Joyful Bliss wouldn't be counted among the Seven Aspects!’

...

### Xuanmiao Temple

Distant lights flickered, casting a painful, brilliant red glow. The dharma lamp before the platform wavered, its light cold and eerie. Above, a young man in a long white-gauze cap and a Daoist robe of black clouds and Profound Mystery patterns stared intently at the chessboard.

It was none other than Qi Lanyan, the one stirring up Jiangbei!

The youth playing chess against him wore blue robes and had clever, spirited eyes. A small water-sparrow stood on his shoulder. He looked at Qi Lanyan with a smile.

“Shanji is in chaos, yet Lord Qi remains so calm.”

Qi Lanyan picked up a chess piece.

“Shanji has Gongsun Bei and Murong Yan,” he said softly. “It will be fine for a short while. Yang Ruiyi hasn't shown himself, so you and I cannot act rashly.”

He tapped the table and raised an eyebrow.

“I'm more curious. The Capital immortals Dao faces the Wilderness directly... Daoist Friend, you were invited here. Aren't you afraid?”

Yehui smiled.

“I trust you, my lord.”

Yehui was an inherently selfish person. His only worry was for his sister's few children, whom he had sent overseas long ago. He didn't care at all if everyone else died a thousand or ten thousand times. His words were pure flattery.

Qi Lanyan didn't believe him either. “Jiangbei has roughly three main routes,” he said coolly. “West is Xiaoshi and Tangdao Mountains, behind Baijiang Creek. Middle is Chengshui and Capital immortals. And East is Xuanmiao, behind Shanji...”

“Which route do you think Yang Ruiyi will attack, Daoist Friend?”

Yehui picked up a piece, studied the board, and said quietly,

“Great Song doesn't want to break any specific sect; it wants to control the world's situation. From the land of Yue to controlling the region between the Huai, and then restoring the power of the Chu State... But in the Yue lands, there is a thorn in their eye, a spike in their flesh. If it's not removed, Yang Ruiyi cannot rest or eat in peace.”

He placed his stone.

“Shanji.”

If one had to name the one thing Profound Governance Pavilion had done to most disgust the Yang Clan, it was undoubtedly planting the nail of Shanji in the south. Once Shanji Prefecture is lost, even if Great Song conquers all the lands of Shu, the Song Emperor will still bear the shame of having lost his dynasty's former lands!

“Not so.”

Qi Lanyan nodded and smiled.

“They definitely want to take Shanji, but they lack the strength for a direct assault. It should have been a slow plot. But Yang Ruiyi has one weakness I do not: he has a Song Emperor above him. Once he attacks, he _must_ achieve results.”

Yehui's expression was grim.

“Your Lordship's information is quite thorough.”

He couldn't fathom how Qi Lanyan had confirmed the relationship between Yang Ruiyi and the Song Emperor. He could only assume the information came from the powers backing him.

Qi Lanyan said in a low voice, “Since he can't take Shanji, he can only enter from the center. He'll cut off Capital immortals in the middle and sever the connection between Xuanmiao and the Zhao State. First, this coordinates with the other force attacking Western Shu. Second... it gives the Song Emperor an answer.”

Yehui was extremely sharp.

“So, my lord, you planned this all along, intentionally sacrificing Capital immortals.”

Qi Lanyan smiled. “Not exactly... I still have a use for you.”

He lifted his sleeve, revealing a jade talisman glowing faintly.

“Below Chengyun, beside Capital immortals, there is a Brahma Cloud Cave. Daoist Friends Changyun and Mingxiang have already lost contact, trapped inside. Yang Ruiyi must have arrived. Please, Daoist Friend, call Zong Chang and the others. Go to Shanji first and strike against Liu Bai. Preferably, take Yufu Prefecture!”

Yehui immediately stood.

“My lord is truly brilliant... But that Spiritual Treasure is powerful. If our group goes east, Changyun and Mingxiang alone will have trouble stopping him...”

Qi Lanyan smiled coldly.

“I long ago arranged for Daoist Friend Vast Cicada to hurry nearby. With him there, he should be able to stall Yang Ruiyi. The people from Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain have already gone.”

Yehui repeatedly called him brilliant and cupped his hands in a salute. He turned to leave, though inwardly he was noncommittal.

‘Vast Cicada will go? Bullshit! He would never ignore a juicy prize like Moongaze Lake. That means he must still be at the lake. Qi Lanyan only mentioned him to have grounds to punish him later. As for how the trapped people die, it has nothing to do with him.’

‘Since he could trap Changyun and Mingxiang so silently, it's definitely Yang Ruiyi. But if his whereabouts are known, why is Qi Lanyan still sitting here? Why not seize the chance to strike south?’

Yehui's face was a mask of respect, but inwardly he felt something was extremely off. He couldn't help but turn back.

“Lord Qi...”

Qi Lanyan shook his head and smiled.

“I have my own place to be.”

The youth watched Yehui leave. He stared at the chessboard again. After a while, a man in Daoist robes approached, bowed before the platform, and said respectfully, “Master!”

Qi Lanyan hadn't brought any disciples from Profound Governance Pavilion on this trip, yet this disciple calling him Master was wearing their robes. Even more bizarre... his cultivation was only at the Qi Refining stage!

“Rise.”

Qi Lanyan smiled at him. The man rose after bowing.

“Master, right now...”

Qi Lanyan withdrew his hand from the board and turned to him. “Yang Ruiyi cannot afford to lose any more southern territory. Losing one piece there can't be compensated for even by ten pieces in the north. He won't just ignore Shanji; there must be a backup plan. Yehui and the others will certainly return empty-handed. There's no need to go.”

The man bowed his head. “Master's words are wise...”

He knelt on the ground.

“Master...” he said, his voice cautious, “why not make a trip to Ting Province... to where that Wei spawn is...”

His tone was grave, but his voice trembled slightly, as if he had suggested something deeply disrespectful.

Hearing the words “Ting Province,” Qi Lanyan closed his eyes and exhaled heavily.

“I understand your eagerness, but this is not the time. Li Zhouwei is very safe right now. If I go there alone, am I supposed to join forces with Vast Cicada? I'll just get dragged in myself. Besides, even if you kill everyone on the lake, he might not come out, and we still might not be able to kill him.”

He seemed troubled.

“We failed to eliminate him before his wings were fully fledged, so a forced siege is meaningless now. The goal of slowing his cultivation has been achieved, but the trend of the great north-south situation cannot change...”

The youth stood up, tossing the chess piece in his hand.

“When the great chaos begins,” he said softly, “and the various lords personally enter the field, and we add fuel to the fire from the sidelines... only then will it be possible to complete this. Relying only on us, even borrowing the might from the mountain... is not enough.”

The man below said, “I just fear...”

He hesitated, but the words he left unsaid were terrifying. Qi Lanyan gritted his teeth.

“Besides, you saw for yourself whether it succeeded or not, didn't you!”

The man below fell silent.

Qi Lanyan closed his eyes. “Say no more. I am going to Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain.”
