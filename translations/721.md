# Chapter 721: The Cui Clan of Chongzhou

Li Ximing studied the old man’s weary expression as he calmly accepted the item. He offered a few words of comfort, then casually asked, "Senior, have you found a home for your Still Earth spiritual artifact, the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger? If not, you could always give it to the venerable Daoist Master Sumian, or even Daoist Master Xuanyi."

Changxi sighed wistfully. It was clear this was a plan long in the making, and one that had yet to bear fruit. "I have other gifts for Sumian," he replied. "As for Xuanyi, I have made arrangements for her as well. These days, those who would dare accept it won't help, and those who would help won't accept it. It remains in my hands. When my time is up, I'll have it sent to Zhaojing."

Hearing this, Li Ximing knew that the chances of trading the spiritual artifact for the support of a Purple Mansion cultivator were all but gone. In the end, it would be sent to his own clan to ease Changxi's conscience. "Take care of yourself, senior," he said. "The Profound Peak Gate's domain is vast. It would be best to recall the island's garrison leader from Yuezhou."

Changxi knew his clan was short on people; Fuyue-zi was the only one left to manage things. "I've already sent him out," he said, his voice raspy with age. "He is to give Yuezhou to Mount Jingyi. Once it is done, he will return. Zhaojing need not worry."

Li Ximing sighed inwardly for the old man but said no more. He nodded and took his leave, traveling from the Profound Peak Gate through the Great Void until he emerged into the Eastern Sea. The light of Converging Water shimmered everywhere he looked.

He journeyed through the Great Void, and whenever he encountered one of its towering peaks, he knew it would harbor spiritual items or waters. He would break through the boundary, casually collect them, and move on. Along the way, he gathered six spiritual items suitable for Qi Refining cultivators and one spiritual water—a Baleful Earth Coldspring.

The spring was guarded by a hook serpent, which likely used it for its own cultivation. When Li Ximing appeared, the demonic beast was so terrified it froze, not daring to make a sound. Given that they were in the territory of a dragon-kin, Li Ximing spared its life, took the spiritual spring, and departed.

In less than a night, by his reckoning, he had reached the Great Void above Chongzhou Island. He saw the illusory radiance of Bright Yang rippling through the void, forming a milky-white barrier of light that enveloped the island below in a brilliant glow. Li Ximing was slightly surprised.

'A starved camel is still bigger than a horse... The Cui clan of Chongzhou has a Purple Mansion formation... Impressive, truly impressive!'

With his hands clasped behind his back, he tore through the Great Void and came to a stop at the island's edge, standing upon a shaft of celestial light. Immediately, vibrant clouds gathered, interwoven with threads of purple and gold, and the sky turned bright and clear. Li Ximing released his spiritual sense, sweeping it across the island, and located a cultivator who looked to be from the main family line. He took a step forward.

The next moment, his figure materialized behind the patrolling cultivator. An intense celestial light immediately burst forth, casting a stark white glare upon the surroundings.

The man spun around instantly, his pupils dilating. He was frozen for a moment, then immediately dropped to his knees, trembling from head to toe. His face drained of color in terror, his eyelids twitched uncontrollably, and he stammered in a hoarse voice, "Chongzhou... Cui... Xinzhan, pays his respects to the Daoist Master!"

It was no wonder Cui Xinzhan was in such a state. He was merely a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator; to him, even a Foundation Establishment cultivator was a formidable figure. For a Purple Mansion master to suddenly tear through the Great Void before him—the fact that he could speak at all was a testament to his courage.

Li Ximing hadn't meant to frighten him so badly. "Go inform your elders," he said casually, "that Daoist Master Zhaojing of Moongaze Lake has arrived."

"Yes, sir!" Cui Xinzhan scrambled to his feet, drenched in sweat and so drained he nearly collapsed. He rushed toward the formation, and as he called out at the entrance, a streak of light descended before him, materializing into a woman holding a golden hoop.

She bowed her head respectfully and said, "Cui Wanqing of Chongzhou greets the Daoist Master! A senior from Moongaze Lake visited us in years past. To now be graced by your celestial presence is the greatest honor for all of Chongzhou!"

His own aunt had indeed visited Chongzhou Island, a fact Li Ximing was well aware of. He gave a slight nod. "I've come this time to honor the friendship between our families. There's no need for such ceremony."

When Cui Wanqing heard he was a Daoist Master from Moongaze Lake and saw that he cultivated the Bright Yang Dao, she knew his surname must be Li. Feeling a sense of kinship, she had come out to greet him personally. "This way, Daoist Master, please..." she said with a gentle smile.

She led Li Ximing into the formation. However, this was merely the outer Foundation Establishment array of the island. The Cui clan had fallen on hard times, and though they possessed a Purple Mansion formation, it was only large enough to cover the core mountain at the very center. The rest of the island was protected by arrays suitable for Foundation Establishment or Qi Refining cultivators. And though the Cui and Li families were close, there was no reason to invite a potential threat directly into their home right away.

Li Ximing looked down and saw bustling crowds of mortals below. They showed little fear, most simply lowering their heads and moving aside. The population was remarkably dense. "Chongzhou governs its people well," he praised.

Cui Wanqing smiled, a hint of pride in her expression. "As the Daoist Master knows, the Bright Yang Dao is a path of worldly engagement. Many of our clan's cultivation arts and secret techniques focus on governance, with personal cultivation as a secondary benefit. That is why our numbers are so large. The number of cultivators and clan members who migrate elsewhere each year is quite substantial!"

"Most of the Cui cultivators and families in the Eastern and Southern Seas can trace their lineage back to Chongzhou. Every ten years, Cui clan members from all over the world return to the island. It is truly a grand event."

With this explanation, Cui Wanqing made Chongzhou's standing clear. With the White Dragon's line backing them, no one dared to trouble them, and it was considered a good thing for distant relatives bearing the Cui name to return and pay their respects.

Just as they set foot on the steps leading to the main hall, a middle-aged man hurried out to meet them. He had a stern expression, with a long mustache that drooped at the sides. He approached, turned sideways, and bowed with utmost respect.

"Junior Cui Xianye greets the Daoist Master!"

Though older, Cui Xianye was far less at ease than Cui Wanqing. The man, who appeared to be of a similar age to Li Ximing, was extremely reserved. He kept his head pressed to the ground, not daring to rise. "My father is currently in seclusion and cannot personally welcome you. As the acting head of the island, I, Xianye, offer you a welcome on behalf of the Cui clan."

"Rise."

Li Ximing smiled and entered the hall. Cui Xianye led him to a seat and personally served him tea. "Some years ago, the Li family of Moongaze Lake corresponded with our Cui clan of Chongzhou," he said respectfully. "However, the letter came from a senior who cultivated the path of thunder. My elders were unsure of its authenticity and did not dare to place their full trust in it. But now, seeing you, Daoist Master, we know you are of the true Bright Yang lineage."

Li Ximing chose not to dwell on the past. The Li family had indeed been obscure and struggling back then. Their situation was slightly better now, but they had only just begun to make a name for themselves. The fact that the Cui clan had provided them with any information at all, even without handing over the full lineage, was generous enough. He nodded. "Indeed. Travel was inconvenient then, so contact was sparse. We can communicate more frequently from now on."

His intention to let bygones be bygones was clear, and a wave of relief washed over Cui Xianye. "Thank you for your understanding, Daoist Master," he said, bowing.

Li Ximing cut to the chase. "How many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators does the Cui clan have at present?"

Cui Xianye answered quickly. "Daoist Master, our island was once home to Daoist Master Mingzan, my great-grandfather. He passed away over a century ago. Several elders of his generation suffered from spiritual energy backlash while in seclusion and showed signs of passing away in recent years. My father also entered seclusion some time ago, so there are currently no Purple Mansion Realm cultivators on the island."

"However," he continued, "a descendant from my great-grandfather's ninth branch, who migrated away long ago, has achieved the Purple Mansion realm. His Daoist name is Yangya. He resides in the Western Sea, in the far west, and has established his own foundation there. He rarely returns, only visiting when a major event occurs."

Li Ximing frowned. The Cui clan's bloodline was strong, and they possessed numerous cultivation arts that led to the Purple Mansion realm. With no external threats and judging by the spiritual energy on Chongzhou—which should have produced more than one Bright Yang Purple Mansion cultivator—it was an excellent, resource-rich land. It was unthinkable that they couldn't produce a single Purple Mansion cultivator.

He had come hoping to find allies, and a seed of disappointment took root. "The Cui clan has cultivated this land for a thousand years. Surely your strength should be greater than this."

Cui Xianye hesitated before speaking. "Daoist Master, it is not just my great-grandfather. His younger brother was also a Purple Mansion cultivator, but he died in service to Li Xunquan when his kingdom fell. My great-great-grandfather was also at the Purple Mansion realm; he and two of our most talented elders fell while following Li Xuan. During the era of the Dongli Sect, Chongzhou was its vassal territory, and all our clansmen were conscripted. Every last one of them perished. As for how many Foundation Establishment cultivators and Purple Mansion masters were among them... no one knows."

He refilled Li Ximing's cup. "This junior means no offense," he added. "I am merely answering your question. I beg your forgiveness."

His words left Li Ximing speechless. Though everyone claimed that the Moongaze Lake Lis were descendants of the Wei-Li, it was not something he dared to openly admit. He could only sigh. "The Cui clan's loyalty and sacrifice are truly moving."

After Cui Xianye's explanation, Li Ximing's tone softened considerably. "My Li clan began as a small lakeside family with an incomplete Dao lineage," he said gently. "I have come this time for two reasons. First, to honor the friendship between our families. Second, to inquire about your lineages, in the hopes of completing my own. I will, of course, offer fair compensation."

Cui Xianye had clearly anticipated his purpose; after all, Li Qinghong had inquired about their Bright Yang lineage once before. "Rest assured, Daoist Master," he said. "Our family has preserved the Bright Yang lineages. May I ask which Dao you cultivate?"

Li Ximing saw no reason to hide it. He tapped his teacup. "Audience with the Celestial Gate."

"Ah, a Divine Ability of the Celestial Gate Arts."

His term, "Celestial Gate Arts," clearly referred to the entire system of high and low-grade cultivation methods related to Audience with the Celestial Gate, including the Radiant Origin Pass. Cui Xianye watched his expression and explained, "The orthodox Bright Yang path has three spells, one body, and one Life Divine Ability. The spell art Divine Abilities are 'Audience with the Celestial Gate,' 'Crimson Severing Arrowhead,' and 'Imperial Observation of the Origin.' The Body Divine Ability is 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread,' and the Life Divine Ability is 'Luminous Heart.'"

Li Ximing only knew that 'Imperial Observation of the Origin' was his clan's 'Eternal Brightness Steps,' and he had heard of the 'Luminous Heart' in the Eastern Sea. The others were new to him. After a moment to process, he asked, "Do they have other names?"

As he expected, Cui Xianye replied, "Indeed, Daoist Master. 'Imperial Observation of the Origin' has always been passed down exclusively within the imperial palace. The version available to outsiders is called 'Eternal Brightness Steps.' 'Luminous Heart' was also known in ancient times as 'World's Radiance.' Only these two are widely circulated. As for the myriad lower-tier Dao foundations, there are far too many to list. I will present you with a catalog later."

Li Ximing was delighted and nodded. Cui Xianye continued respectfully, "The Divine Abilities for 'Imperial Observation of the Origin' and 'Luminous Heart' can only be bestowed by the imperial family itself. We do not have them here in Chongzhou. We only possess 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' and 'Sovereign's Perilous Tread.'"

'The Body Divine Ability, Sovereign's Perilous Tread!'

A wave of elation washed over Li Ximing. It was almost too hot to contain. Besides the 'Luminous Heart,' this Body Divine Ability was the second thing he had hoped to obtain on this trip!

Ever since his Foundation Establishment days, he had heard of the power of such foundations—from the Yu family's 'Jade Court General' to Ning Tiaoxiao's famous 'Spring Echo.' Even Daoist Master Sumian had praised Ding Weizeng's 'Palace-Yang Tiger.' After hearing Changxi speak so often of the advantages of a Body Divine Ability, his heart had long been moved!

At this moment, he felt nothing but gratitude for his Bright Yang lineage and the legacy left by his predecessors, which had spared him the struggles faced by men like Changxi. He nodded and smiled. "I wish to study them. What is your price?"

Li Ximing knew that Purple Mansion cultivation arts were priceless. Back at Hengzhu, the minimum exchange for a Purple Mansion spiritual item was a Purple Mansion art or a spiritual artifact. The Cui clan of Chongzhou was not a family to be trifled with, especially given their deep historical ties to his own.

He saw Cui Xianye hesitate for a breath. Since Chongzhou had no urgent needs, he pondered, "Daoist Master... do you have a Bright Yang Purple Mansion spiritual item?"

Li Ximing had expected this question. It reminded him of his own clan's past struggles. "I would like one myself," he said with a hint of wistfulness. "Unfortunately, the only one my clan fought tooth and nail to acquire has already been used."

Cui Xianye asked again, "Then... does the Daoist Master have a Bright Yang Purple Mansion spiritual artifact?"

He paused, then added, "We would not dare ask for a spirit treasure, only a spiritual artifact. And we cannot accept an embryonic one, as we have no Purple Mansion cultivator with the divine ability to refine it."

Li Ximing sipped his tea. "I have a spiritual artifact, but it is not of the Bright Yang Dao."

"This..."

Now it was Cui Xianye's turn to be hesitant. Seeing his difficulty, Li Ximing asked, "What is the nature of your clan's 'Audience with the Celestial Gate' lineage?"

Although he lacked a suitable spiritual artifact, he possessed a Bright Yang Purple Mansion cultivation art. A one-for-one exchange would not be unfair. In response to his question, Cui Xianye answered, "It is the _Upper Mansion Audience Scripture_, a fifth-grade cultivation art... with... three secret methods."

Doubt flickered in Li Ximing's mind.

He remembered Kong Tingyun once asking Li Qinghong how many secret methods the Li family's art had. Li Qinghong had said one, and Kong Tingyun had replied, 'That's quite normal.' At the time, he thought she was just being polite. Considering his clan's _Scripture of Heavenly Radiance and the Waning Sun_ and the _Golden Book of Divine Attendance_, it seemed to him that most clans should have at least four or five secret methods, if not six or seven.

But now, he saw that the illustrious Cui clan's art had only three. Meanwhile, the _Radiant Essence Scripture_ in his possession had a staggering nine!

For a moment, he didn't know how to respond. A single thought surfaced in his mind:

'A blessing and a curse.'

He remembered Xiao Chuting mentioning the _Secret Records of Dongli_. Most cultivation arts of the Bright Yang lineage were likely catalogued within it! And the phenomenon from his own breakthrough to Foundation Establishment had been witnessed by many!

But what had he used for that breakthrough? Not the _Radiant Essence Scripture_, but the _Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art_! He had switched to this Purple Mansion art later on.

Why had Daoist Master Yuanxiu and the others always considered him a non-threat? It must be because the _Secret Records of Dongli_ contained an entry for the fourth-grade _Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art_, likely listing it with one secret method, or perhaps none at all. And Si Boxiu had observed his breakthrough phenomenon perfectly...

But when he later broke through to the Purple Mansion realm, he had been using the new art, and its phenomenon was something no one could comprehend. Now, if he were to trade his cultivation art, did the Cui clan have any related records? If someone from their clan used this art to break through, would it be discovered?

The fact that the _Golden Hall Radiant Origin Art_ was in the _Secret Records of Dongli_ proved that the arts bestowed by the Immortal Mirror were pre-existing techniques. This meant the _Radiant Essence Scripture_ could very well lead to disaster.

'And the Eldest Scion cultivated this in the Eastern Sea, so his case isn't a useful reference...'

All these thoughts flashed through his mind in an instant, but Cui Xianye's mind was racing just as fast.

'The Moongaze Lake Li family started from nothing. The Purple Mansion art they luckily obtained probably can't compare to our _Upper Mansion Audience Scripture_, let alone the number of secret methods... His silence... only confirms it.'
