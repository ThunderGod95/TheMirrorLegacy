# Chapter 881: Better To Act Decisively

Lingu Lanying’s seemingly baseless remark caused the surrounding cultivators to subtly change expressions, turning Si Yuanli into the center of attention.

He didn’t need to think too hard. Just by looking at the crowd’s furious expressions, he knew that Chi Zhiyan’s orders and actions had long been deliberately leaked by the esteemed families. These cultivators may lack deep heritage, but they were no fools. Who among them wasn’t bitter right now?

Sending aid to Mount Bianyan?

If Lingu Lanying hadn’t brought it up in public, Si Yuanli wouldn’t have treated it as a matter of concern at all. Though the northern cultivators had retreated, the south was ultimately weaker, and who would dare act rashly with Li Xuanfeng on the verge of death?

Si Yuanli had only intended to dismiss the crowd, then secretly send a few to scout the north. He could then claim to the Chi Family that it was a rescue mission. With the riverside barely secured and no orders from the south, who could call him a liar?

Once the riverside crowd dispersed, only a few direct descendants of esteemed families would know what he had done. But Lingu Lanying’s blunt question had thrust him into the spotlight, leaving him prickling with discomfort under so many eyes.

This isn’t just about putting me in an awkward position...

The riverside fell silent. Si Yuanli stood slightly to the side, meeting the gaze of the green-robed woman before him. Her eyes showed no aggression nor outrage, only calm.

He realized the sword in his hand had gone cold. Though more calculating than his older brother Si Yuanbai, the moment he met that gaze, his heart had skipped a beat.

Any family that had lasted a century within the Azure Pond Sect represented more than just itself. It symbolized vast power behind the scenes, and at times, a particular voice, the Purple Mansion Realm.

In a moment so full of scrutiny, if someone from the Li Family spoke, Si Yuanli had to consider whether it was actually Xiao Chuting’s will. If someone from the Yuan Family acted, he had to wonder if Buzi had returned.

The Lingu Family, a naturalized house of Mount Yue, had stood firm for three hundred years and guarded the Southern Sea on the Azure Pond Sect’s behalf. Though their roots were deep and tangled, their true strength lay in being the in-laws of a Daoist Master from the Great Xiukui Temple.

Lingu Lanying’s words represented more than just the Lingu Family, it also signified the stance of Jiachuan Prefecture, the Southern Sea cultivators, and even the shadow of the Lin Family from Xiukui.

His mind raced. Neither Lingu Lanying nor the Southern Sea cultivators had any real conflict with him. Their provocation was not meant as an attack, but a confirmation. They wanted a response from him, whether it be a vague evasion or a polite deferral.

Which cultivator present wouldn’t see through an attempt to shirk responsibility? As long as Si Yuanli wasn’t a diehard loyalist of the Chi Family, their resentment wouldn’t land on him. But then again, the Chi Family were no fools either.

The sword cultivator calmly sheathed his weapon as he said, "Chi Zhiyan has gathered elite forces and stationed them at Mount Bianyan, which is protected by a grand formation. The northern cultivators are being forced to detour around it. Mount Bianyan should be several times safer than here. They ought to be secure."

With a single sentence, he set the tone, indirectly confirming the rumors spread by the esteemed families and pinning the blame squarely on the Chi Family. Only then did he continue, "But the minds of devil cultivators are unpredictable, and their methods are strange. Who knows what schemes they may have? If the rescue fails, it would be a grave mistake. I will personally lead a team to investigate, in case a devil cultivator returns for an attack."

He spoke crisply and efficiently. Lingu Lanying nodded along, and several peak masters and daoists close to the Lingu Family stood behind her in contemplation, while the rest of the cultivators whispered among themselves and turned to peer at him.

Si Yuanli spoke warmly, "Everyone, please rest for now. The promised Essence Gathering Pills and spirit items will be fully distributed within three days. As long as I, Si Yuanli, am here, not a single one of you will be shortchanged."
𝙛𝒓𝒆𝙚𝒘𝒆𝓫𝙣𝓸𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝒄𝒐𝓶

A chorus of cheerful voices rose from below. Si Yuanli stood with his hands behind his back on the riverbank, meeting Lingu Lanying’s smiling face.

His eyes narrowed slightly as the woman before him softly said, "Be at ease, senior. There are no unusual signs in the sky, and no one has fled back in defeat in a long time. It must surely be safe."

That reminded Si Yuanli; he didn’t believe in peace and safety at all. With such a perfect opportunity, the fall of Mount Bianyan was inevitable. The current silence could only mean the truth was being concealed.

Chi Zhiyan is finished.

Si Yuanli likely knew best of everyone how many were still at Mount Bianyan. For that very reason, he still found it hard to believe.

Chi Zhiyan, second only to sect master Chi Zhiyun in the Chi Family’s direct descendants, along with seven direct descendants, from Chi Liangzhe to Chi Dongqing, plus numerous peak masters and daoists of the Chi Family, whether by blood or marriage... and even Ning Heyuan from the Ning Family.

The two most talented generations of Chi Family juniors had been deliberately kept within the sect, only to be taken out by Si Boxiu. Then, they perished with him inside the grotto heaven!

The situation at Mount Bianyan was entirely unlike that of the riverbank. Chi Zhiyan was no Li Xuanfeng. Suddenly, Si Yuanli realized that Lingu Lanying’s question had been inevitable. His heart grew clear with insight, There is no room for diplomacy in sect strife and faction struggle. From the moment I chose to defend the riverbank, I had already taken a side. Be it the Li Family or the Lingu Family, the will of the people is clear.

A look of decisive clarity finally emerged on Si Yuanli’s face as he thought in his heart, In the path of shifting power, only speed and ruthlessness prevail. To seek compromise is to invite ruin. Better to be resolute!

Mount Bianyan.

Billowing demonic smoke drifted over the bloodstained mountaintop. A black boot sent ripples through a pool of blood as the sharp-eyed black-robed youth looked up at the sky raining with blood.

The green-robed cultivator before him had a handsome face and ethereal attire, yet the sinister glint in his eyes added a terrifying edge. He stood with sword in hand, his face covered in blood.

His dharma robe was slashed in several places. His complexion was pale and grim as he panted heavily, struggling to exhale the chilling air that had invaded his lungs.

"Chi Zhiyan..."

The black-robed youth said the name with a smile, and the blood pool beneath his feet trembled slightly with his voice.

Yu Jiang stood with arms crossed, three bone tokens circling around him, and smiled. "I heard you're the sect master’s younger brother from Azure Pond Sect. Well then... how do you like this grand gift?"

"Brother Yu Jiang, why waste words on him?!" Master Monk Xuwang let out a hearty laugh, though his eyes betrayed urgency. The spells in his hand grew fiercer and more relentless, breaking Chi Zhiyan’s tendons and bones. If not for the sturdiness of his dharma robe, he would have already collapsed.

Severed heads lay at his feet, their faces still frozen in terror. Chi Zhiyan gasped for breath, blood dripping steadily from his collar.

In just fifteen minutes, he had exhausted all his trump cards.

Chi Zhiyan’s innate talent was decent, but his strength was not outstanding, and he rarely needed to engage in battle. There was a clear gap against these opponents. If not for several powerful items on him, he would have been killed already.

As a core member of the Chi Family, he naturally carried Purple Mansion Realm talismans, multiple even. But after fifteen minutes of fighting, he had only used one, and even that had been neutralized through the combined efforts of his opponents.

Meanwhile, Yu Jiang’s shamanic arts had begun to take effect. When Chi Zhiyan reached for the embroidered pouch on his waist a second time, it had turned into a damp, furry golden rat, its long tail tied to his belt as it let out shrill squeaks.

How bizarre!

Chi Zhiyan carried not only Purple Mansion Realm talismans, but also a rare talisman that allowed a brief escape into the great void. It was tied to his wrist and was yet unused. Despite his repeated attempts to activate it, it showed no response.

Chi Zhiyan’s gaze moved past his opponents to the sky. His heart gradually calmed. The great void here had already been sealed. Even if Purple Mansion Realm cultivators could come and go freely, his talisman alone would not allow him to escape.

By command!

The black-robed youth cast another spell. Chi Zhiyan’s longsword suddenly transformed into a colorful lizard that twisted and bit at his wrist. Chi Zhiyan no longer had the strength to dispel the spell, he simply reached for his waist, hoping to switch weapons altogether.

Squeak, squeak!

The fat golden-furred rat squeaked again, and only then did Chi Zhiyan remember that the pouch could no longer be used. A wave of despair rose in his heart, To think I would fall here!

He didn’t know what had happened in the south, but the swarm of devil cultivators from the sky had sealed off Mount Bianyan. Demonic light shimmered in every direction.

To be fair, Mount Bianyan’s defenses were not weak. There were over ten peak masters, all of significant strength. Only four devil cultivators among the enemy were formidable, and the grand formation had only been breached in a few spots. They still had the strength to fight.

But the north did not only bring Yu Jiang and his three companions, but many more devil cultivators that surged from the south. Though they were weaker, they mercilessly slaughtered the Qi Cultivation Realm disciples on the mountain. Since the main four were holding off the top defenders, the key nodes of the formation were quickly dismantled and lost all brilliance.

The peak masters were then executed one by one. Chi Liangzhe, Chi Dongqing, and others had fallen before his eyes. Chi Zhiyan gradually understood that he had miscalculated, I should have abandoned the riverbank and let the devil cultivators sweep down from there, instead of having them trap us at Mount Bianyan! There would have at least been a chance to escape!

Chi Zhiyan’s heart turned cold. His storage pouch still held pills and talismans, yet Yu Jiang’s persistent spells prevented him from using them, while Xuwang pressed closer with ruthless aggression.

Finally, blue rain began falling from the sky. The blue rain was laced with droplets of blood, pouring over the battlefield. The Hooked Serpent seal floating in the air reverted to its true form and hovered silently.

The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal has been broken!

He could no longer see Ning Heyuan through the hazy rain. All he saw was a delicate-looking man in a python robe emerging with a long whip in hand, lashing out in a cold flash.

Splurt!

Chi Zhiyan could only raise both arms to block. The last of his mana had run dry. His dharma robe dimmed, and a searing ray of colored light pierced his chest. His heart turned utterly cold.

Xuwang’s palm strike pierced through his chest and shot upward, shattering his face as well. In that fleeting instant, what remained of Chi Zhiyan’s consciousness flickered, So I’ve ruined my brother’s great plan after all!

Boom!

As he fell, several beams of golden light mixed with rainbow hues shot into the sky. Xuwang suddenly rose into the air. Countless corpses and blood below him lifted with the surge, shining with golden radiance.

Wisps of soul-like pure energy rose skyward, flowing into his body. Xuwang sat cross-legged midair as a golden lotus bloomed beneath him, joy lighting up his face as he thought, Destiny has arrived!

————

Within the great void.

A vast, multicolored radiance condensed within the great void. Layers of iridescent clouds drifted like smoke as a dark-purple alms bowl hovered silently in the air, trembling slightly, yet unable to move.

A single dot of amethyst light rested upon the bowl. It was gleaming faintly, yet it was as immovable as a mountain. Just like that, the treasured Kongsijiang Demon Bowl, refined over many years by a Maha, was pinned in place within the great void, unable to advance or retreat, hovering dumbly in the air.

A woman in purple robes was standing before it. Her black hair was pinned back with an ordinary white hairpin. An elegant brow lifted as she looked northward, her gaze landing on the vast, round shape of Anhuai Heaven suspended within the great void. She said nothing.

"Zipei..." Maha’s voice echoed from near and far, tinged with fury, rumbling across the great void like a multitude speaking in unison, "It was one thing for you to ruin my plans, but now you won’t even let it go. What is it you want?"

Li Xuanfeng carried the fated weight of the north-south conflict. The Maha had been lurking in the great void, awaiting changes within Anhuai Heaven. But when he sensed such a ripe opportunity, he could no longer restrain himself.

If I could seize such a dense fate, wouldn’t that be perfect?

Though the Maha could not act directly, there was still a host of Master Monks in the north. He summoned them and granted the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl with the goal of forging a Merciful One under his command.

If one of them killed Li Xuanfeng and became his Merciful One, it would not be just any servant; he would gain a powerful subordinate. Then, with the Merciful One’s fate in his hands, he could absorb that destiny to nourish himself, skipping much of the effort required for cultivation.

The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl had three transformations. He had only used two. Though they had been summoned by a Master Monk rather than wielded by him directly, they were already more than enough to deal with Li Xuanfeng.

He had intended to take more time and let a few more monks die so their fate could gather, thus he had not unleashed the final transformation. Who would’ve thought Zipei would suddenly interfere, causing the prize already in his grasp to slip away!

That wretched woman actually didn’t enter Anhuai Heaven? How is that possible? thought the Maha.

To put it bluntly, with Shangyuan and the others now gone, Zipei was already the most formidable cultivator in Jiangnan. If she had entered Anhuai Heaven to compete with the others, she would have secured a significant share. Who could have predicted that she would show no interest?

Now, his treasured artifact was suppressed by Zipei’s divine power, trapped and unable to act. The Maha could neither advance nor retreat. He glared at her with hidden fury, secretly growing uneasy.

He had taken advantage of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's momentary absence in the south to summon two transformations of the Kongsijiang Demon Bowl. Though it had not been wielded by his own hand, relying on those monks to enact his plans was already crossing the line. Now, feeling guilty, he found himself at a loss for words.

Daoist Master Zipei finally spoke, "The bald monk certainly crafted a fine dharma artifact. So many transformations, all just to target a single Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator!"

She tilted her head slightly to the side, and a flicker of violet light spun atop the bowl. The Kongsijiang Demon Bowl shook violently, emitting pained wails.

Maha’s voice boomed in fury, "Fellow Daoist, are you trying to break the rules?"

Zipei watched coldly, her divine ability drawing forth a swirl of gray mist. The mist dispersed and transformed into three kinds of flame, each falling into her hands.

She lifted her head and said coldly, "You, Daisi, are no more than a Maha of two incarnations, and you dare speak to me of rules? Even Zhelu wouldn’t presume so much. Get lost while you still can!"
𝐟𝐫𝕖𝗲𝘄𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝕧𝐞𝚕.𝕔𝕠𝐦

Maha Daisi’s radiance flickered in the great void, bearing the flavor of forced restraint. He truly dared not retort. Retracting the wailing Kongsijiang Demon Bowl, his eye-shaped glow dissolved into a patch of rainbow mist and retreated northward.

An ordinary Merciful One possessed only early stage Purple Mansion Realm strength and lacked divine protections, making them comparatively weak. Even those who had cultivated for years were barely equal to an early stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

Only after becoming a Maha would one gain true power. It took three incarnations to reach mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, and five to seven to approach the late stage. Frankly speaking, Daisi was no match for the woman before him. He had no choice but to swallow his anger and flee like a defeated dog.

Zipei lowered her eyes, quietly gazing at Anhuai Heaven before her. The grotto heaven was gradually fading away, while the aura of Metallic Essence pulsed in and out, releasing a sudden, thunderous roar.
