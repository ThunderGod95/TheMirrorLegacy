# Chapter 177: Father and Son of the An Family

At the head of the table, An Zheyan was toying with a piece of bear paw on his plate. Hearing these words, he raised his eyebrows and pushed up the leather hat on his head. His expression immediately shifted, now marked by fleshy folds as he visibly tensed. He said sternly, "What do you mean by that?"

An Zheyan's tone was relatively gentle, devoid of any reproach, indicating that An Jingming truly was the apple of his eye. Any other clan member who dared to utter such words would have been executed on the spot; only from An Jingming's mouth would these words prompt An Zheyan to take him seriously.

"The Yu Family acts tyrannically, full of ambition, while the Li Family is reserved and quietly ruthless. Our An Family is caught in between, struggling to look after both ends. Father, aren't you afraid?"

Standing in the courtyard, with the sunlight reflecting off the gold bracelets on his wrists, the young An Jingming stood tall against the wind, staring directly at his father at the head of the table.

"Well..." An Zheyan was at a loss for words for a moment before saying, "Haven't I already followed your advice by drawing the Ding Family to Moongaze Lake, maintaining a tripartite balance? The Yu Family has also promised not to attack the families that pay tribute... If the Li Family ever invades from the north, the Yu Family will surely not stand idly by and watch them expand... there's nothing to fear then. You just need to focus on your cultivation. Once you've reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, our family will have a place on the lake. Wouldn't that be wonderful?"

An Jingming clenched his teeth and shook his head, unable to muster anger at the sight of his father's contented face. He swung his sleeves and said softly, "Father! What makes you think the Yu Family will just sit idly by and watch me attain Foundation Establishment Realm? I dare not even leave our family's grand formation now. As I slowly increase my cultivation year by year, the Yu Family will eventually become impatient and will surely find an excuse to kill me!"

An Zheyan was momentarily stunned, his mouth moved but no words came out. Unable to formulate a rebuttal, he could only ask, "What do you suggest then?"

Clearing his throat, An Jingming said in a voice still tinged with youthful timbre, "Our family's awkward position is due to its poor geographical location... caught between the Li and Yu families. The best strategy now is to sell Mount Huazhong to the Li Family, letting them face the pressure from the Yu Family directly. The two families could sign a pact, in turn, making the Yu Family feel the threat of the Li Family's rise."

An Jingming continued to lay out his plans, "I've heard that Li Tongya has reached the eighth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm, which could draw the Yu Family's attention. The two families supporting each other from east to west, I could marry a girl from the Li Family, leveraging the might of the Sword Immortal to deter the Yu Family. Once I've reached the Foundation Establishment Realm and if Li Tongya succeeds in his breakthrough, we could support the Li Family against the Yu Family... If Li Tongya fails, then we could lead both families, with each party getting what they need."

As An Jingming was still speaking, An Zheyan's lips trembled, and his complexion turned unsightly. He interrupted his son, slamming his silver chopsticks down.

"No, absolutely not! Do you know how many spirit fields are on Mount Huazhong, feeding how many of our clan members?! We fought tooth and nail to get it; how can we just hand it over to the Li Family!"

An Jingming sighed lightly, realizing that An Zheyan's character would never allow for the ceding of Mount Huazhong. Thus, he solemnly suggested, "Since Father is reluctant to give up Mount Huazhong, I have another plan. The key to the Li Family is Li Tongya...He is extremely cautious, fully focused on cultivating in seclusion in the south, and difficult to remove. However, if we can ally with the Yu Family against Li Xuanling and Li Xuanfeng, eliminating one of them, could Li Tongya still remain indifferent?"

Continuing, An Jingming said, "With the Yu Family currently favorably inclined toward us, there are opportunities to be utilized. Yu Mugao is a dark and ruthless man, difficult to deal with. If we can unite with other families to assassinate Yu Mugao, the threat of the Yu Family can be significantly reduced."

An Zheyan was confused, seeing him aim to kill Yu Mugao on one hand and remove Li Xuanling and Li Xuanfeng on the other. He was unable to follow his son's ambitious line of thought. He murmured, "So, does our An Family side with the Yu Family or the Li Family?"

"Both sides!" An Jingming softly chuckled, lifting his head slightly as he declared, "As the Yu and Li families harbor mutual suspicions, our An Family has the opportunity to sow discord and navigate both sides. Regardless of who dies, or if both sides suffer no casualties, it's as good as setting a feud between the Yu and Li families."

An Zheyan, somewhat moved by this, pondered for a moment before hesitantly saying, "But... neither side is foolish. How could they simply act as you suggest?"

"Don't worry, Father," An Jingming assured, "It is precisely because neither side is foolish and they are wary of each other... Fear leads to murderous intentions. The conflict between the two families is inevitable, and we are merely a catalyst. Father just needs to follow the script I've taught you, ensuring that both families betray each other, resulting in mutual destruction."

In the estate at the foot of the mountain in Lijing Town, Mu Yalu paced around the courtyard before taking a seat on a stone bench. A servant hurriedly served her tea.

Since it was discovered that Li Yuanjiao had spiritual orifice and extraordinary talent, Mu Yalu's days in the main courtyard had significantly improved.

Previously, Li Xuanxuan rarely visited her courtyard and Mu Yalu always tried to keep a low profile, minimizing her presence. Once Li Yuanjiao started spending more time on the mountain, Mu Yalu instantly became one of the most significant figures in the courtyard.

"Madam, this tea was sent over by the main family yesterday. This month, they've sent gifts to the courtyard three times already," whispered a servant girl beside her.

This woman, a descendant of the Mount Yue refugees who had assimilated completely with the Easterners, was brought into the courtyard personally by Mu Yalu and was deeply trusted by her.

Upon hearing this, Mu Yalu nodded slightly, and the servant girl added softly, "Since Young Master Xiu and Jiao'er get along well, the first madam has always been displeased. But in recent years, ever since Jiao'er was found to have spiritual orifice, she has started to curry favor..."

Mu Yalu gestured for her to stop talking and said quietly, "The first madam is crafty. Over the years, she has managed the concubines in the family well, and Xiu'er has been well-taught; he's capable of managing a household and is no ordinary person. She sees Jiao'er as Yuanxiu's future right-hand man, hence naturally wanting to maintain a good relationship with me..."

Setting her small teacup on the table, Mu Yalu softly inquired, "Have you found out about the matter I asked you to investigate?"

"Yes Madam, the man's name is Shamoli—the fourth son of Mu Jiaoman. He is now residing on the eastern side of the town," the servant girl replied obediently.

Mu Yalu smiled, her eyes slightly crinkling as she spoke gently, "What a godsent opportunity! In the future, Mount Yue will become even closer to the Li Family, and when Jiao'er grows up, he can also receive some support from the Mulu clan."

Although the servant girl did not understand why Mu Yalu considered it a godsend opportunity, she felt happy seeing her madam so delighted. However, their conversation was interrupted by a gentle knock on the door.

"Mother, I've returned!"

Li Yuanjiao's cheerful voice came from outside the door.

"It's the young master!" the servant girl exclaimed happily as Mu Yalu quickly stood up and walked to the door, gently pushing it open to see Li Yuanjiao standing there with a beaming smile.

"Jiao'er!"

Mu Yalu stepped forward to embrace him, softly asking, "Are you accustomed to living on the mountain this year?"

"It's been all right! My siblings have all been quite nice to me," Li Yuanjiao chuckled and swiftly entered the courtyard to sit beside the stone table, taking the teacup in his hands. He quietly asked, "Has Father been in seclusion on the mountain this year? Has anyone troubled you at home?"

"Not at all," Mu Yalu replied with a soft voice, refilling his cup with water.

Li Yuanjiao sighed in relief as he continued, "Stepmother has been quite kind to you. There haven't been any petty schemes in the family, which has really eased my mind. At least Brother and I won't have to worry about it!"

As Mu Yalu nodded and smiled, Li Yuanjiao paused before seriously adding, "I've been dealing with affairs in the Clan Affairs Courtyard with brother these past few days and learned quite a lot."

Mu Yalu raised an eyebrow at him, observing as Li Yuanjiao put down his teacup. He then whispered, "Mother, have you sent someone to inquire about Shamoli's news?"

Mu Yalu was momentarily shocked, nodding with a hint of unease before she responded meekly, "Yes..."

Li Yuanjiao shook his head, advising, "Mother, given your sensitive status, it's better to have someone ask me these things directly on the mountain. In the future, avoid inquiring yourself. Li Family's territory is not like Eastern Mount Yue; the Clan Affairs Courtyard has many eyes and ears around. I'm afraid you might inadvertently give them something to hold against you, Mother..."

Mu Yalu was instantly alarmed and anxious, her voice filled with concern as she asked, "Could this lead to any consequences?! Has Mother caused you trouble?"

"It's nothing serious," Li Yuanjiao reassured, taking a sip of his tea and smiling. "It's not a big deal. Besides, Brother gave me that secret letter to handle myself. I just wanted to remind Mother," he continued with a small grin.

"That's a relief."

Mu Yalu sighed softly. After a brief exchange, she had the servant girl leave and then softly asked, "Does... Lord Yuanxiu treat you the same as before?"

"Yes," Li Yuanjiao's voice lowered in response, "In our family, where only my brother from the direct lineage can cultivate and with the family being sparse in numbers—regardless of legitimacy or gender—all descendants with spiritual orifices are treated equally. I haven't faced any mistreatment; on the contrary, I've received tremendous benefits!"

"That's very good," Mu Yalu visibly relaxed, only for Li Yuanjiao to continue, "I've heard that the family is considering adopting me into fourth granduncle's line, who is solely focused on his cultivation in the southern border without any interest in taking a wife for himself. I came today to get your opinion on this matter..."

"What?!" Mu Yalu was stunned, feeling as though fortune had suddenly smiled upon her. She asked hesitantly, "You're talking about... the Qingsui Sword Immortal?"

"Yes."

Li Yuanjiao was quite shocked himself when Li Xuanling confided in him about this intention. Observing his mother's disbelief, he softly added, "Father... He has agreed to it. If you are fine with it, I'll become the direct descendant of the fourth lineage, which will be greatly beneficial in the future."

"Good."

Mu Yalu nodded as she heard this, her primary concern always being her son's well-being, thus agreeing without hesitation. After pondering for a moment, she whispered, "That way, you could compete with Yuanxiu for the position of the young clan head..."

"Mother, you must not speak nonsense!" Li Yuanjiao shook his head firmly, stating, "I respect my brother the most. The position of the young clan head can only be his. In this life, I only wish to support him well—with no other intentions."

"That's fine too," Mu Yalu replied with a smile, thinking about how to convey these exact words to the main household.

"However, regarding Shamoli, he's quite the pleasure-seeker..."

The mother and son discussed further regarding the newcomer, with Li Yuanjiao detailing Shamoli's personality.

"Not everyone can be adept at human relations. The Li Family is only kind to its own and those under its rule. Shamoli, falling into you and your brother's hands, is rather unfortunate!" Mu Yalu laughed.

"What's there to pity about him when he's being handed a throne on a silver platter?" Li Yuanjiao dismissed, laughing heartily.

Mu Yalu watched him with a joyful eye, from Li Xuanxuan to Li Yuanxiu, she realized that both were not at all simple-minded men.

She thought to herself, Every one of the Li Family is cunning and bad, focusing outward for now... By the sixth or eighth generation, when kinship thins, internal strife will surely happen. Fortunately, my son was born early and is thus spared from having to compete with similarly shrewd characters.

Atop Mount Lijing, Li Tongya stepped through the air, his figure shifting like a phantom. Around him, several reflections that looked like water gleamed, floating around his figure for a moment before dissipating with a soft splash.

"I've finally mastered the River Crossing Torrential Step! Now, I have an added layer of protection against enemies... Unless facing against a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, I can escape with ease even if I can't win," Li Tongya mumbled to himself gleefully.

The River Crossing Torrential Step had three stages. The initial stage was not too challenging, but it became significantly more difficult with progression. It took Li Tongya seven to eight years just to master the first stage.

Li Tongya's practice of the River One Qi Technique from Lingyu Gate, a foundational technique that shared origins with this footwork technique, should have sped up his training.

However, these past few years, his focus was on cultivation, aiming to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm before sixty. Thus, this footwork technique was only revisited during cultivation bottlenecks, taking him seven to eight years to master what should have taken three to four.

Only Li Xuanling from within the family showed a natural aptitude for this technique, mastering it early on. No other clan members were known to have succeeded.

"It's unbelievable that among the vast Li Family, no one could master the Pill Flame Secret Art and produce a Pill Flame..."

Li Tongya thought again. Among the members of the Xiao Family, far larger than the Li Family, only Xiao Chuting and Xiao Yuansi could conjure the Pill Flame. This put things into perspective for him.

"No wonder Yu Muxian of the Azure Pond Sect is so valued by the Yu Family... I'm guessing there are also certain conditions to meet before one can refine artifacts."

Just as Li Tongya settled on the mountainside, a voice transmission entered the formation, echoing in the cave dwelling.

"An Zheyan from the An Family is here to visit. Please open the formation, Brother Tongya!"

"An Zheyan..?"

Li Tongya paused momentarily. He had little interaction with this individual, having only divided the Lu Family's assets in tacit agreement. He wondered about the purpose of today's visit.

After opening the formation, Li Tongya sat for a moment. Soon, Li Xuanling led An Zheyan inside. Li Tongya glanced at him and courteously said, "Greetings, Brother Zheyan."

"No need for formality, Brother Tongya!" An Zheyan grinned, returning the greeting. His bald head was now adorned with a gray-white leather hat that made him look less like a butcher from the secular world, but more like a wealthy landlord.

"Word has it that Brother Tongya has broken through to the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Truly remarkable!"

An Zheyan, taking the offered tea, smiled. It had been decades since their last meeting. Back then, their cultivation realms were comparable, but now An Zheyan was at the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm while Li Tongya had already reached the eighth.

"You're flattering me, Brother Zheyan..." Li Tongya replied with a shallow smile. He decided to cut to the chase.

"What brings Brother Zheyan here today?"
