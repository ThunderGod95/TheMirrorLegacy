# Chapter 1210: The Golden Art

'My Chunyi...'

Yuanshang looked uneasy, staring intently at the person before him as his lips moved slightly.

'My Chunyi... is too ruthless for the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, yet fails in its duties as a remnant of the Immortal Mansion... what role... what role does it even play, it's not clear at all!'

He truly could not bring himself to say such words. After a long, brewing silence, he finally just sighed and replied:

"Venerable Senior, Chunyi did not participate in the events of that year."

'Of course... if you had truly been entangled, you would not be here today...'

Tang Xie stared at him and said quietly:

"This is no longer a question of whether your Dao lineage was involved... Do you truly believe you were sent here because your method for verifying the Dao was unclear? Even if the heavens have been reclusive in recent years, what technique could they possibly lack... Why would they need you to investigate it yourself."

Yuanshang was shaken, looking at him in disbelief, while Tang Xie hinted with perfect composure:

"There is surely conflict within the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition that backs you. If you cannot discern the various origins of what happened back then, it will be useless even if you lay out the entire Daoist tradition with perfect clarity!"

This was as much as Tang Xie could say. He finished his tea and fell silent, so Yuanshang had no choice but to gather his thoughts, suppress the terror in his heart, and speak softly:

"That year... the Immortal Mansion had not long been in seclusion, the royal family of Yue State still possessed some power, and the Dongli Sect had been destroyed for some years. I was still cultivating at sea, and at that time... my master was there as well."

"A cultivator suddenly appeared on Moongaze Lake, practicing a lunar Daoist tradition. They said... his cultivation was only at the Foundation Establishment Realm, and he was traveling south, making his way through Yue State."

Yuanshang hesitated for a moment, then said:

"At the time, the powers that be must have known of this cultivator's origins, which is why the three great sects and the various Dao gates sent people to investigate..."

Tang Xie frowned and said:

"The three great sects?"

Only then did Yuanshang remember that he was a reclusive cultivator from a grotto-heaven, and he paused to explain:

"The three great sects of my Jiangnan are, first, the Golden Feather Sect of the Highest Azure Daoist tradition; second, the Yue Cultivating Sect of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition; and third, the Azure Pond Sect, also of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition... back then, it was still a demonic sect. All three originated from Azure Profoundity and received its profound grace, which is why they are grouped as the three great sects."

"And among the various Dao gates of that time, the Supreme Yang ones were Purple Smoke, Sword Gate, Xiukui, and Hengzhu."

"As for the restâ€”Lingyu Gate, Hongxue, Snow Wings Gate, Searing Radiance, and Wuzhu Gate... they have nearly all been destroyed, with only one house barely clinging to existence. People today may not know, but in truth... the bond between these five houses was no weaker than the ties within the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition."

A nostalgic look appeared on Yuanshang's face as he said:

"Traces of this closeness remain to this day... The last Daoist Master of Hongxue was called Guansue, and the old Daoist Master of Snow Wings Gate was called Guanxu... The Yang family also has a Guanxuan..."

Tang Xie made a quick calculation on his fingers and said:

"People of Encompassing Profoundity?"

"Precisely."

Yuanshang sighed:

"They were all under Encompassing Profoundity, having transitioned from the era of Ning State. Their territories were mostly distributed along both banks of the river, so they could in fact be called the Wanling Daoist tradition. The earliest Purple Smoke Abbey was also originally part of the Wanling Daoist tradition, but True Monarch Taixu studied the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and thereby changed paths. Even so, they maintained a degree of closeness and were considered the most amicable toward the Wanling Daoist tradition among all the Supreme Yang factions."

"Initially, these houses were quite harmonious. But as more and more years passed after they crossed the river, with the Wanling Upper Sect no longer presiding over them, friction arose between them. Estrangement gradually set in, and some... grew close with the royal family of Jiangnan."

Tang Xie immediately understood:

'They fell in with the Underworld.'

Yuanshang paused for a moment, then continued:

"At the time, the word was of a Foundation Establishment cultivator who had obtained the Dao of the Immortal Mansion... How much can someone at that realm truly obtain? He was just another lucky soul. The cultivators of my Dao did not get involved, and my master... was preoccupied with his own affairs and paid it no heed."

"But in what was merely the snap of a finger for someone at the Purple Mansion Realm, everything was turned upside down. It turned out that the Foundation Establishment cultivator was a clone from the 'Divided Aspect' technique, acting in Jiangnan simply to travel through the mortal world. In truth, a great Daoist Master of the Purple Mansion Realm was in seclusion on the lake, with the surname Li, the name Jiangqun, and the Daoist title Donghua."

As he spoke of this, the Woven Jade Immortal's expression once again grew uneasy, and he said:

"When my master heard of this, his expression changed instantly. A Great Daoist Master, a fellow Daoist of Azure Profoundity, and he dared to use the 'Dong' generation name!"

His expression was complex as he sighed:

"That is a generational name only a True Monarch's direct disciples are permitted to use! The founder of the Yue Cultivating Sect back then was Daoist Master Dongtai! If all he claimed was true... then who was backing him?"

"My master was preoccupied with his own affairs and could not spare the attention for some time... He..."

His heart grew somber:

'He knew his own conscience was not clear, so he did not dare to inquire closely,'

"and in the midst of his indecision... they had already made their move."

Tang Xie, who had been listening casually, now sharply lifted his head, raising an eyebrow.

"They?"

"Led by Golden Oneness and Azure Pond, and supported by the various Dao gates of the Wanling Daoist tradition."

At these words, Tang Xie concisely identified four factions:

'Traitors from the Supreme Yang, the Underworld, Highest Azure... and considering Luoxia's current control over the world, the role played by that Heavenly Glow must have been dishonorable as well.'

Tang Xie was secretly stunned by the weight of these implications, his bronze pupils shifting slightly as he said in a low voice:

"That couldn't have been easy, could it?"

"Of course it wasn't easy..."

Yuanshang said softly:

"I heard that even the Great Void was used to set up a formation, casting the world into a murky gloom. They even said... it drew forth a manifestation of the Supreme Yin Profound Light, that there were other contingencies, and that a certain True Monarch was injured!"

The look in Tang Xie's eyes deepened, causing Yuanshang's expression to turn grim. He glanced around, his feelings growing ever more complicated, and said softly:

"Senior, your meaning is..."

Tang Xie nodded, saying:

"Since the heavens have accepted you, Chunyi Dao Gate must not have been complicit. But you must understand... now that you have reached the Woven Jade Dao, you no longer represent only Chunyi. Everything that the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and the Immortal Mansion experienced is now your history."

How could Yuanshang not understand now! His heart filled with dismay:

"You're right, Senior... My perspective has been too narrow... To think I was still considering only Chunyi... So this was all about the strife in Jiangnan..."

His heart sank for a moment:

'If that's the case, according to this senior's speculation, could either Taiqing or True Monarch Taiyuan having a good time? Even Taiyue would have to be terrified! All these years... the only noteworthy thing He has done is cultivate True Monarch Shangyuan...'

Although the two seemed to be conversing pleasantly, one was an ancient who had arrived with a heart full of apprehension, while the other was a Woven Jade Immortal who had attained the Dao in a daze; their moods could not have been more different!

As Yuanshang, he had survived a scene of utter annihilation and had instead ascended to immortality. His heart was filled with boundless joy and gratitude, and he saw the heavens as his backer and the source of his Daoist tradition, harboring no suspicions. But Tang Xie's words had been a sudden awakening, forcing him to consider the heavens' deeper meaning bit by bit.

This Woven Jade Immortal slowly retreated from the joy and calm of his attainment, his mentality undergoing a radical change. He could not help but begin to reconsider, slowly picking up thoughts he had once let fall:

'The Supreme Yin is clearly in power now, so my attainment of the Dao was part of its plan... As for Li Ximing, who was at Moongaze Lake and delivered that Mystic Pill into my hands, his role is hard to say... but the Chi Buzi mentioned by the Dangjiang Immortal official... is almost certainly a hidden pawn.'

'He is also a member of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition... What for? To seize the Pristine Water?... None of this is without a trace... The heavens' arrangements are laid out in far more places than just this one corner...'

Having heard so much, the Woven Jade Immortal's thoughts were gradually led astray by Tang Xie. He said bleakly:

"Which is to say, the great figures are all well aware of the discord in the Chongming, it's just that the time for a reckoning has not yet come..."

'This child can be taught!'

Tang Xie praised him inwardly and said softly:

"You are a Woven Jade Immortal now!"

He reminded him:

"You may not yet know the significance of a Woven Jade Immortal, but in any great war to come, you will certainly participate. Though your friend Daoist Zhengao is formidable, at most he will fill an Auxiliary Position for the Supreme Yin. You will be his right arm!"

Yuanshang's heart trembled as Zhengao's words at that time suddenly came to mind, and he silently demurred:

"My strength is meager..."

Tang Xie said in a low voice:

"Let me be blunt, Chunyi Dao Gate may not be completely clean. What you need to do... is to consider how to extricate your Daoist tradition and how to contribute when the time comes... not waste your time here, agonizing over what mistakes your tradition has made!"

Yuanshang pressed his lips together, stood up, and bowed deeply.

"Many thanks for your guidance, Senior!"

Seeing him lost in thought, Tang Xie nodded inwardly. But having resolved Yuanshang's matter, there were still doubts lingering in his own mind. He felt waves of unreality wash over him, and he could vaguely see his own pitiful cave again.

'Not good...'

He instantly understood that his time here was growing shorter and shorter. Feeling both reluctant to leave and anxious, he immediately waved his hand and said:

"I have a matter I must ask you."

"Please speak, Senior!"

Tang Xie was clearly much more urgent now, his copper-colored whiskers trembling as he asked for confirmation:

"The Highest Azure Daoist tradition you mentioned, is that truly the one of that True Monarch Taiyuan?"

Yuanshang nodded slightly, and Tang Xie's expression instantly turned grim, as if his mind were filled with troubles. He said somberly:

"So it really is Him! I heard He later pledged allegiance to Azure Profoundity. So He was involved too... This is trouble..."

If that was the case, he could almost be certain that this True Monarch Taiyuan also stood in opposition to the heavens.

'His Dui Metal Fruition Attainment... was likely seized from the hands of a supporter within the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition!'

This was something that would be shocking to any cultivator today, yet Tang Xie felt it was not at all surprisingâ€”he had seen too many examples of people acting for the sake of Dao-Profundity and Fruition Attainment, not to mention he had heard of this person long ago:

'Zhang Yuanyu... then it's not strange at all...'

Yuanshang had not expected that out of all the True Monarchs, he would first ask about Taiyuan, and was immediately perplexed:

"Although I have heard this great figure's methods are profound, rumor has it His cultivation... is not as great as that of Cultivation Transcendence. Among the great figures, Changhuai is first, having already reached the late stage of the Golden Core Realm..."

Although he had attained the Dao, he had lost all his divine abilities. He knew nothing of cultivation methods, not even the specific details of Golden Core cultivation, only that this True Monarch Taiyi's cultivation was extremely high, and he was perhaps a great threat to the heavens.

Tang Xie shook his head noncommittally.

"Taiyi, Qing Changhuai... I know of Him. Of all the True Monarchs in the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, only His name ever reached me... At that time, He showed signs of a breakthrough, and those outside feared He was plotting for the Treasured Earth, so they came specifically to ask me..."

His expression was grave as he shook his head:

"This True Monarch's Dao-Profundity and vision are indeed in a class of their own, but His Dao-path... it's complicated. From the perspective of my Numinous Treasure Daoist tradition, His path is already severed... The late Golden Core Realm... is meaningless."

Yuanshang had never expected to hear such treasonous and undisguised words from him and was momentarily stunned. But on second thought, the person before him was also of a True Monarch's status, so it was not so strange. He just murmured:

"How can it be... meaningless..."

A trace of pride rose in Tang Xie's eyes as he said calmly:

"It is said that 'divine abilities have traces, but the Dao-fruit has no stages.' Golden Core cultivation is not like the Purple Mansion Realm, where there is a clear path to follow. Or rather, the path for each Fruition Attainment is different, and they cannot be compared."

As an ancient cultivator who had seen immortals, no matter how destitute he was now, that insight and pride were always hidden within him. In ancient times, he would have dared to comment on even an ordinary True Monarch! It was only after reaching the heavens that he had silently put away this arrogance.

He immediately chose his words carefully and said coolly:

"You must know... Zhang Yuanyu is not as simple as holding the orthodox position of 'Dui Metal.' He has twice made a fool of all the immortals in the world, and the achievements He has attained on the Geng and Dui Daos are enough to look down on the ancients. His current position is backed by a long past of ruling and transforming the Geng and Dui Daos."

"You have attained the Dao too recently, so it's difficult for me to explain the differences clearly, but there is one thing you must know..."

His expression was stern as he said softly:

"I know the past but not the present, so I do not know which lifetime of His this is... But there is at least one point... All the achievements and cultivation Taiyi has obtained today, Zhang Yuanyu had already achieved in His first life. Their situations were even eighty percent similar, yet He dared to cast it all away like a worn-out shoe!"

"If Taiyi wants to reach Zhang Yuanyu's position, He would first have to reincarnate, then scheme without error for two thousand years, eliminate two or more True Monarchs, and have a great figure willing to promote him..."

"That is almost impossible."

Tang Xie's gaze was somber:

"This was both a scheme and a unique, opportune time. Even if Taiyi has the ability, the world is no longer as it was... If these two were to fight, Taiyi would certainly lose. Late Golden Core Realm? A rapid rise in cultivation is merely a matter of good fortune, but He cannot be a Dao Embryo, and dares not be one in the future, so it represents nothing at all."

He said seriously:

"Taiyuan alone, unless a Dao Embryo or an Immortal Artifact appears, no one can suppress Him!"

This Divine Core Cultivator before him was praising the True Monarch Taiyuan outside the grotto-heaven to the extreme. How could Yuanshang ever have heard such gossip among True Monarchs! He was speechless for a moment, but Tang Xie, as if his words were not intense enough, continued somberly:

"Furthermore, do you think He cannot cross the threshold to the mid-Golden Core Realm? Not at all. All the Dao-fruits He has obtained in the past reveal another factâ€”as long as He does not fall, the next Dao Embryo will be Him, with ninety percent certainty!"

He sneered:

"In such a situation... leaving two steps as a buffer, in my opinion, is very likely a concession He is making to Luoxia and the Underworld."

Having said this, he could already feel the lifting force slowly weakening, and his form was gradually becoming ethereal. This Divine Core cultivator already had a conclusion in his heart and swallowed the rest of his words:

'Which is to say, if the heavens were to rashly intervene, Luoxia and the Underworld would join forces to resist the enemy, and both taking a step back would very likely facilitate this True Monarch's attainment of the Dao... which would be tantamount to aiding the enemy...'

At this moment, he had largely understood the predicament faced by the great figures in the heavens being in seclusion, with Zhengao holding the fort. He sighed inwardly:

'To appear in the world for a day is to have the whole world as an enemy... but only this... is worthy of the heavens' hesitation!'
