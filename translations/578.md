# Chapter 896: The Beginning Of Total Achievement

Li Xijun considered all this and remained cautious, but unfortunately, the jade box was completely empty inside. It had no grooves or fixed protrusions, and was simply a hollow container.

Before the two could discuss further, a bolt of lightning flashed down onto the island. When the purple light dispersed, it revealed a female cultivator in a feathered robe, holding a spear.

Her voice was gentle. "I’ve inspected the island. Including the surrounding islets and wetlands, it covers roughly fifty kilometers.

"That’s not small at all."

Although Moongaze Lake was famed as a one thousand five hundred kilometer wide lake and the largest in Yue State, it was no longer comparable to its ancient size. In the west, its narrow stretch reached Mount Xiping, and in the east, its tributaries extended into the Wilderness. The lake islets were all flat reed marshes. Even at its peak, the lake only spanned about five hundred kilometers. The island at the heart of the lake was already considered massive.

The lightning of this forbidden formation seemed harmless to Li Qinghong, instead gathering affectionately on her Duruo Spear as arcs of violet lightning danced. She said, "Have you managed to uncover anything from this forbidden formation?"

"Aunt."

Though Li Ximing was an alchemist, the Li Family’s heritage covered formations, pills, talismans, and tools. After a few days of study, he had found some clues and bowed in reply. "This grand formation doesn’t seem to be a creation of later generations. The patterns are ancient, and the four pillars within symbolize Merging Fire, Converging Water, Molten Fire, and Valley Water. Since all four remain intact, it retains great power."

Li Xijun picked up the thread of conversation. "This appears to be an ancient formation, and not one set by Chen Taoping. The Fei Family’s Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation on the lake is also ancient. They may share a common origin. I sent someone to the Fei Family to retrieve the formation core and personally went home to fetch this jade box."

Li Xijun explained its background in detail. Li Qinghong took the jade box and examined it. The white box shimmered in her slender hands, and a flash of purple lightning flickered over it. Before she could speak, a person and a white ape descended from the sky.

"Greetings, esteemed elders!"

The person and the ape were, of course, Fei Tongyu and the white ape. Fei Tongyu was not strong enough to enter the formation alone, so the white ape had waited for him outside.

Fei Tongyu had taken medicine and looked much better. As soon as he landed, he knelt and raised both hands, presenting a small flag. The small flag was colored dark yellow and black, its edges embroidered with dark silver patterns, and it emitted a misty, shadowy aura. It was quite beautiful.

He hid his two missing fingers behind the flag and bowed as he spoke respectfully, "The core of the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation, the Profound Boundless Flag, is here."

"You are too polite, senior." Li Xijun spoke politely, sidestepping to avoid the bow, and immediately helped him up, his expression warm.

Li Qinghong accepted the flag and responded gently, "Xijun is right. Brother Fei is one of our own; there’s no need for formality."

Fei Tongyu merely stood respectfully with his head lowered. Li Xijun took a closer look and remarked, "So the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation belongs to the category of Boundless Essence. That’s quite rare in the South."

The Boundless Essence qi appeared as a dark yellow hue. The one most knowledgeable about it among the Li Family was Li Xizhi. He had once crossed paths with Tuoba Chongyuan, a cultivator of Boundless Essence. Emperor Wu of Liang held the title of True Monarch Tiancheng of Boundless Essence, a true monarch of that very path.

Li Qinghong began speculating, If I’m not mistaken, the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation must’ve been established during the Liang dynasty. That would explain the use of Boundless Essence. Back then, the formation must have been quite formidable. Now that Liang is gone, I suspect it has lost over sixty percent of its power...

Even weakened, the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation had long been the strongest on the lake before the Li Family’s arrival. Ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators could not easily breach it, and the Fei Family had relied on this formation to endure for generations.

Sure enough, Fei Tongyu nodded respectfully and replied, "Replying to the elders, this formation was where our ancestors once resided. It dates back to the Great Liang era. When Great Ning cultivators attacked this place, it was cultivators from Ning State who guarded the river and set it up. Our family history does record its weakening."

Fei Tongyu paused slightly and lowered his head, "Though ancient, this formation has never failed in all these years. The only exception was when our old ancestor was slain. That man walked through the formation as if it didn’t exist. Neither the formation plate nor the flags responded. It was as if they respectfully let him leave."

Li Qinghong tilted her head slightly and met Li Xijun’s gaze. The young man appeared deep in thought, Cultivators of Ning State who guarded the river?

Li Xuanfeng’s relics had included a letter from the Great Ning Palace, written by a cultivator of Ning State to the Sima Family. It once mentioned, Your family has long stood guard along the riverbanks...

Could it be that this formation once belonged to the Sima Family?

Li Xijun suppressed his doubts, took the formation flag, and carefully compared it to the markings on the ground. After a while, he said, "It was likely crafted by the same hand."

Li Ximing exhaled slightly, shook his sleeves, and said, "That makes things much easier! If we have the core artifact as a reference and invite a Formation Master, a few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators working together can break this formation. It’s just a forbidden formation now, so it’s not that difficult to deal with."

The three rose together. Li Xijun first looked at Fei Tongyu and said gently, "Senior, you may return for now. I still need to copy the patterns from the formation flag to break the formation. I’ll need to borrow it for another two or three days, and will return it afterward."

Fei Tongyu responded with a respectful bow and was escorted out by the white ape. Once he had left, the three of them exited the formation together. Li Ximing looked quite satisfied, thinking, That’s two birds with one stone. Now we also control the formation’s secrets. No matter what happens in the future, at least this grand formation won’t be able to cause much trouble.

Li Xijun nodded slightly. The formation markings just now did seem to come from one hand. Regardless of whether it was true, it was the right story in front of Fei Tongyu. He said softly, "There must be both power and sacrifice when drawing others into allegiance. Gaining the formation flag this way is far gentler than other methods. At least it doesn’t damage the dignity of the rest of the Fei Family, and it spares Fei Tongyu from being caught in too awkward a position."

"This kind of thing really is your specialty, Eighth Brother!" Li Ximing shook his head in admiration. Li Qinghong was still examining the jade box in her hand.

Li Xijun turned and said, "Make a copy of the patterns and send a portion to Brother Zhi as well. Let’s investigate in the sect for any connection. The Fei Family is a cautionary tale. These ancient formations, techniques, and dharma artifacts are indeed powerful, but if we don’t know who the original owner is, we may end up letting outsiders come and go as they please."

Now that they were speaking of ancient techniques and dharma artifacts, Li Ximing’s eyes lit up. He took something from his sleeve and tossed it into the air, where it spun and expanded, transforming into a man-sized incense burner.

The burner was entirely crimson-red, its three legs carved with beast faces. Its sides had an image of a three-eyed creature, neither wolf nor tiger, its four feet stepping on cloud smoke. It was vivid and lifelike, a depiction of the famed ancient Three-Eyed Mount Tiao Beast.

Only the base bore the word Sima, glowing faintly. After spending a long time refining it, Li Ximing had finally succeeded and was quite satisfied, This burner is called Cuoxiang. It is a Foundation Establishment Realm ancient dharma artifact, and different from most current dharma artifacts. It is not meant for combat.

Seeing the other two look over, Li Ximing began to explain, "This burner excels at nurturing fire and burning incense. It can not only preserve multiple spiritual flames but also suppress fire veins, transforming the malignant aura they emit into spiritual smoke. Such an effect is unheard of."

He formed a seal with his fingers, and a flame leaped from the burner, taking the shape of a bird. The Li Family’s sole spiritual flame, the Long Marching Fire Essence, had been stored within.

The Li Family’s Wutu Mountain had a fire vein of average strength. It was suitable for alchemy but somewhat lacking for refining artifacts. Fortunately, the Yu Family was well-established. Their Milin Mountain had two fire veins, one for alchemy and one for refining, both with long histories. This dharma artifact would certainly be of use.

Li Ximing’s talisman qi, the Valley Wind Leading Fire, was already capable of refining flames. After demonstrating the burner's fire-nurturing ability, he continued, "Even better, this burner has a Qi Nourishing function. It can store all kinds of spiritual qi without them interfering with one another. Most spiritual qi can be gently sustained inside, preventing it from dissipating over time."

This effect was truly impressive and made Li Xijun’s eyes light up.

The Li Family now had dozens of qi gathering methods, and each type of spiritual qi had different containment requirements. What’s more, each spiritual qi required a special jade vial, which added up over time. These vials had spatial properties but still couldn’t be stored in a storage pouch.

"Send it to the Jade Court..." Li Xijun murmured, then said softly, "No, better to send it to Milin. We can set up a new department there that’s solely responsible for qi gathering."

The Li Family was growing ever larger, and allowing the Jade Court Guards to centralize too much power was not ideal. Responsibilities needed to be distributed. Li Xijun had already begun laying the groundwork for a new system, intending to use the move to the lake islands as an opportunity to reform.

Li Qinghong understood his intentions. The woman reflected inwardly, Cuoxiang is a family treasure, and the painted screen isn’t far off in value. Pity the refinement process is so difficult. The mana I’ve poured into it has vanished without a trace... who knows when I’ll finish refining it.

Cuoxiang was in Li Ximing’s hands, while the painted screen was naturally in Li Qinghong’s. Neither had been fully refined yet. The Li Family still didn’t know anything about the golden talisman and mercury droplets, but Si Yuanli, who had accompanied Li Xuanfeng, most likely knew about it. Li Xizhi had already begun inquiring.

As the three descended onto the peak, they were met by Li Xuanxuan, who held a letter in his hand, his brow tightly furrowed. Li Xijun stepped forward and greeted respectfully, "My lord, this is..."

Li Xuanxuan simply handed over the letter, which Li Xijun began reading, Ning Hejing, Chi Fubo, and others, in accordance with the late sect master’s final immortal command, appointed Chi Zhiyan’s son, Chi Xuxiao, as sect master overnight... Promoted Chi Zhihu, Xia Yun, Ning Hede, and others to roles in the General Affairs Hall, Xieqi Peak, Immortal Tribute Office, and Cloudliner Office...

At midnight, Si Yuanli returned to Azure Pond Sect, admitting he failed to aid in time. Chi Xuxiao did not fault him and instead rewarded him generously...

Li Xijun read in silence. Li Ximing took the letter next, frowning as he spoke, "How did a Qi Cultivation Realm sect master suddenly appear?!"

The letter stated that Chi Xuxiao was only twelve years old and at the second stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. It had been over three hundred years since the Azure Pond Sect had a sect master of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Li Xuanxuan could only shake his head as he said, "All I can see is that Si Yuanli is in for a rough time. None of them seem to have good intentions toward him."

The group sat down in the main hall and the letter was passed around. Once it returned to Li Xijun, he read it twice again, then said quietly, "The Azure Pond Sect’s response was shockingly fast... but this move was unexpected..."

The white-robed young man rested a hand on his sword hilt, speaking in a low, calm voice, "They’ve gone and appointed another sect master. What are Ning Hejing and the Chi Family thinking..."

Most of the names in the letter were unfamiliar, save for a few recognizable ones and Chi Zhihu of the Chi Family’s second lineage. The rest were likely either remaining Chi loyalists or members of the Ning Family.

Li Xijun said, "In truth, since Chi Zhiyun hasn’t emerged from seclusion, there was no need to rush. They could have just promoted a few Chi Family and loyal members into key positions, drawn in the noble clans, and observed the situation calmly...

"Though many families are dissatisfied with the Chi Family, Chi Zhiyun is adept at winning people over. Most of the sect’s daoists still recognize the Chi Family. Doing this now only makes them look weak."

Of course, all of these moves by the Chi Family, the families, and the daoists assumed that the Daoist Master Yuan Xiu, Si Boxiu, was either missing or unwilling to interfere. If Si Boxiu chose to act, replacing Chi with Si at the Azure Pond Sect would be a matter of a single command.

Li Qinghong nodded and said softly, "Judging from Si Yuanli’s actions, at the very least, Yuan Xiu has no ulterior plans... otherwise, why would he enter the hall and admit guilt?"

Li Xijun took a moment to gather his thoughts, then said decisively, "Chi Zhiyun couldn’t possibly have left any true command behind. If he foresaw today, he wouldn’t have appointed a child. This so-called command is definitely forged.

"My humble guess is that there was some compromise between Ning Hejing and the Chi Family... maybe the Chi Family doesn’t trust Ning Hejing, and Ning Hejing fears being discarded once used. Many scenarios are possible. In any case, this appointment list or Chi Xuxiao himself is the result of that compromise..."

Everyone fell into thought. Li Xuanxuan studied the situation, quietly taking it as a lesson as he pondered the inter-lineage systems, then said, "No matter which family it happens to, the collapse of a main bloodline like this will take decades to recover from, especially since the Chi Family’s Purple Mansion Realm cultivators has gone missing..."

Li Qinghong raised her teacup and took a sip at the mention of the Chi Family’s missing Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, lowering her eyes to conceal her expression.

Li Xijun slightly raised an eyebrow and continued, "That’s true. The sect master has been appointed, and it does come with its advantages. It’s better than doing nothing. Now it’s up to Si Yuanli to worry about resolving the situation.

"In any case, the chaos at the Azure Pond Sect has already begun. Yuan Xiu’s faction is deeply entrenched and ambitious. The Chi and Ning faction may have the name, but their strength is inconsistent..."

Although the Li Family had long anticipated turmoil in the Azure Pond Sect, events don’t always unfold as expected. Who could say whether Si Boxiu would personally intervene? Who could predict whether Ning Hejing and the others would passively await their fate?

If the Si Family advanced with unstoppable momentum and seized control of the Azure Pond Sect under the leadership of a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, then how well would those uncontrollable esteemed families fare afterward under the eyes of the Si Family?

Whoever held that position, be they named Si or Chi, their stance would be the same. The only difference was that the Li Family rendered prior service, so the Si Family might show some leniency. But would they truly allow an entire lake region to fall wholly into the Li Family’s hands?

To most, the current situation seemed perfectly normal. Yet only Li Xijun quietly let out a breath of relief. Even his brows relaxed, his eyes grew bright, and he changed the topic, saying, "As for our Li Family."

The white-robed youth exhaled, his tone now far more relaxed as he spoke softly, "With the upper sect in chaos, factions at odds, offerings neglected, and the esteemed families left unchecked, we should seize this moment to fulfill our family’s century-old ambition!

"Devour the Great Lake, enter the island at the heart of the lake, become the head of a prefecture, seize spirit items, and pursue the Purple Mansion Realm..."

He paused. Clad in white as pure as snow, his voice turned sharp and resolute, each word ringing with force, "Complete the work of six generations!"
