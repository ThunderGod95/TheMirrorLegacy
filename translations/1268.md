# Chapter 1268: Divergent Stratagem

At these words, Tao Jiexing was stunned, standing in place in utter disbelief, as if unable to discern whether what he had just heard from King Wei was sincere or merely a jest. He murmured:

“Let them all fall?”

King Wei smiled.

“Should they not have fallen long ago?”

He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, pacing slowly as he spoke.

“These were once the official residences of the Wei State, appendages of Bright Yang. They were seized when no one was watching over them, a matter we chose not to pursue, but they have now been in use for a thousand years. Now that I have come bearing the great momentum of Bright Yang, it is only natural that I take them back.”

Tao Jiexing’s lips parted and closed, as if he had been struck dumb. It was a long moment before he spoke.

“These are the fated opportunities of their ancestors… I fear they will not accept this…”

“If you wish to frame it that way—then you can consider this my fated opportunity now.”

The King Wei before him chuckled and said lightly.

“Luoxia is now a land of great battles, and there will be no shortage of them in the future. Should fortune prove unkind, it may even become a place of entanglement between the Song and Zhao. Fellow Daoist Tao, surely you do not believe… that these mystic realms can be held for much longer?”

“The day the people of Song withdraw, the Zhao generals will come for blood and bone. After a time, the people of Song will return again. Besides your Tao family, what other house can remain here in peace? It is merely a matter of when.”

He spoke nonchalantly.

“Rather than enriching the enemy, it is better to present them to me.”

The peace in Luoxia had lasted for far too long. Tao Jiexing could not imagine anyone would dare move against the mystic realms of the great families, much less that the King Wei before him held such a view of the future. He remained standing, dumbfounded. With a complex expression, Xuanwei pushed the junior aside, stepped forward, and said,

“King Wei speaks truly.”

He sighed.

“The Qiao clan has been out of contact with their mystic realm for many years; there will be no one inside. With the demise of Gongsun Bei's Dawn Qi, I fear those with insight have already begun to worry about its fall… It is not unexpected… It is just the Wei clan’s…”

Xuanwei’s voice was sincere as he probed,

“Under such instability, there are bound to be openings, and it would not be difficult to enter and retrieve things. As mystic realms are now rare in the world, leaving one or two behind would be a gift to the immortal cultivators of future generations…”

On this point, Xuanwei was correct. Mystic realms in the world were now exceedingly few, and the cost of sustaining them was exorbitant. When a grotto-heaven was opened, the cascading fall of its attached mystic realms was unavoidable. For any that could be maintained, some families would go so far as to move their entire clan to it!

It was only because this place was in Luoxia; had it been just over a mountain in Jianghuai, or anywhere near Moongaze Lake with even the slightest potential for use, Li Zhouwei would have defended it to the death!

Hearing his words, Li Zhouwei smiled.

“Senior Xuanwei—that will depend on the sincerity of the various families!”

He turned and strode out from the pavilion. Tao Jiexing scrambled to follow, while Xuanwei, lost in thought, paused for a full breath before stepping forward and speaking in a low voice,

“King Wei!”

Li Zhouwei had already reached the threshold of white jade. He paused briefly, listening to the Daoist Master’s grave voice,

“Does King Wei truly intend to occupy Luoxia for the long term?”

Silence descended between the pavilions. The figure of King Wei was gone, leaving only the bright morning sun shining in from outside.

Xuanwei was silent for a long time. At his side, Tao Jiexing’s face flushed slightly as he said in a low voice,

“This… what kind of conduct is this! Is this not… Martial Cultivation!”

Xuanwei’s train of thought was broken. He chuckled, turning around with a hint of mockery in his expression.

“It seems you have also heard the tale of that Song Emperor ascending the throne and reclaiming the Yue State.”

Tao Jiexing said only, “I have heard a little of it.”

Xuanwei said, “The great families before his rise remained great families after his rise, only more numerous, not fewer. Thus, geniuses emerged in droves, each Holding the Profound, a situation beneficial and without harm. That is True Qi. And so you thought Luoxia would be the same.”

He smiled.

“But this one is a White Qilin, not a Stone-Embracing Crane—just as he said, he is here to pacify Luoxia!”

Tao Jiexing grew extremely uneasy.

“Martial Uncle, I understand everything you are saying. This is the way of Bright Yang. But must one not consider the current situation? Luoxia has only just been stabilized, the people are filled with anxiety, and the various cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm are wavering. To move against the mystic realms now, will it not stir resentment?”

“Furthermore, since the Great Song favors the great and noble families, if he acts so inconsiderately, how can the Song Emperor simply stand by… I fear it will destroy any accord!”

Since the Tao family had sided with Song, they had yet to see any benefit, or even formally declare their allegiance. Naturally, they did not wish to see turmoil erupt so easily in Luoxia. Tao Jiexing’s concerns were thus quite genuine.

Coupled with Xuanwei’s final question, Tao Jiexing naturally grew anxious and could not help but ask,

“This King Wei… does he truly have no intention of staying? Does he plan to simply plunder Luoxia before retreating with a light cavalry, handing it back to the Great Zhao?”

“He has offended all the great families in one go. I fear he does not intend to take many people back with him; they will each just Hold the Profound and leave behind a utter mess. If so… who will dare to surrender to him in the future…”

“And our position will become even more awkward!”

Tao Jiexing sighed incessantly.

Xuanwei’s gaze was burning as he said, “Quite the opposite.”

Tao Jiexing was taken aback, but the middle-aged man before him offered no further explanation. Instead, looking like someone thoroughly enjoying the spectacle, he continued,

“Go to Boye at once. Ascertain the status of the major mystic realms and ensure the Qiao clan has not left behind some measure that would prevent them from falling.”

Tao Jiexing had not expected his own elder to have reached some inexplicable, tacit understanding with King Wei, and to seem even more eager. Xuanwei glanced at him again and sighed.

“You are always so quick to blame Qi Lanyan, but when it comes to the shifting of situations, you are, after all, inexperienced with the world. Your heart is set on the Dao, and you see things less clearly than he.”

“Just watch.”

He drew near the windowsill, looked up at the sky, and lamented:

“Mystic realms falling like comets… this land has not seen such a sight for a thousand years…”

…

Mount Liangchuan.

Beyond the heavens, clouds of qi roiled like dragons. In the distance, flames raged furiously, while closer, ink-black raindrops beat incessantly upon a grand formation. An old man stood on the mountain’s peak, his body wreathed in blazing Li Fire. He touched the blood at the corner of his mouth, wanting to speak but hesitating.

“It has been six hours…”

Jia Zan had, of course, been guarding this place for a long time. When news came of Gongsun Bei’s fall, he knew the situation was decided and redoubled his efforts—but his divine abilities were meager, and his efforts were of little use.

Now, wounded again, he could only raise his eyes to see a lone figure standing in the air.

The man was dressed in long robes and possessed an extraordinary air. He stood upon a hazy, flickering flame as divine abilities converged upon him, illuminating heaven and earth in an astonishing display.

‘In the end, Daoist Master Chiguang did not come. Instead, a man named Qian Yan has arrived…’

The matter was urgent, so not many cultivators had come from the north. They hailed mainly from the two closest territories: the first being Mianchi, and the second the Great Adoration Dharma Realm. But in this world, everyone looks out for their own interests. Even though Jiang Fuwang had indeed feinted and gone to Mianchi instead, the situation remained unclear, and not many cultivators were willing to follow him.

The only one of any consequence was this Qian Yan.

This man was the martial nephew of Daoist Master Chiguang, a cultivator from the Linxiang Pavilion of Mianchi. He had been at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm for many years, and his profound skill in the Dao of alchemy gave him a deep foundation. He was a particularly famous great cultivator in the entire northern region!

With him in the lead, along with two Mahas from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, they were difficult to resist. Jia Zan first used the grand formation to hold them off for a time. When Yu Xi rushed to the scene, he naturally threw himself into the fray, while Jia Zan could only rely on the Li Fire in his hands to give the others pause.

Although he was a True Fire cultivator, the Li Fire he possessed was exceptionally potent. Its light and darkness were in constant flux, and it was named the Threefold Radiance Li Fire. It could break through the concealing transformations of Qian Yan’s Molten Fire. Thus, even though he had retreated into the formation, he was still constantly monitoring the situation, his light shining in all directions.

But as he was contemplating, he suddenly sensed something. He looked eastward with a sense of unease and saw a brilliant multicolored light shining from the direction of Ruzhou, so bright it was impossible to miss!

‘This is bad! Something has happened in Ruzhou!’

His expression changed drastically. He looked to the heavens with shock and suspicion, and sure enough, he saw the expanse of Valley Water that filled the sky begin to tremble violently.

Jia Zan acted decisively, once again pushing the grand formation to provide support. With the roar of a cascading waterfall, the formation’s light flared brightly for a moment, like a brilliant, rising star, sweeping away the roiling clouds.

“Dong!”

A golden radiance enveloped the cosmos, temporarily suppressing numerous divine abilities. Two figures descended urgently, retreating one after the other. The one in the lead was hale and hearty despite his age, with a full head of white hair. It was none other than Yu Xi!

The old man was utterly frazzled at this moment. Without even a chance to catch his breath, he activated a divine ability and gazed far into the east!

“Boom!”

A violent roar once again shook the heavens. A faint, multicolored light shot skyward, filling Jia Zan with an alarmed uncertainty. Yu Xi seemed to have sensed something, and he cried out in horror,

“No! That is my family’s grand formation!”

Yu Xi’s service to the Li clan had been forced by the greater situation, but he had one bottom line—the safety of the Yu clan! It was one thing for Ruzhou to be attacked, but for the Yu clan’s own grand formation to be shaken… how could he not be horrified?

Jia Zan felt his scalp tingle, a sense of dread washing over him. As he expected, he saw the old man rise up in fury, unable to remain a moment longer.

“Wait here while I go save Ruzhou!”

“You must not!”

Jia Zan had no choice but to brace himself and step forward.

“Venerable Uncle, please wait… The situation is unclear. If you go east rashly, I fear you will fall into an ambush!”

The great families of Luoxia often intermarried, so it was acceptable for Jia Zan to address Yu Xi as 'Venerable Uncle'. But no matter how sincere his words, the old Daoist Master’s gaze never left the east. He said in a deep voice,

“I cultivate Valley Water. I do not fear an ambush.”

Jia Zan spoke again with urgency,

“Venerable Uncle! Qian Yan and the others hesitate outside the formation because they too cannot see the situation clearly, and there is no profit to be made. That is why they are not harassing us much, merely putting on a show… But everyone has seen the scene in Ruzhou. If you leave, Venerable Uncle, I fear those villains will be moved to break the mountain and plunder it.”

Although Jia Zan’s divine abilities were not great, he at least had a clear view of the situation. His words were urgent, but Yu Xi’s were just as much so,

“The Yang clan will surely have no intention of protecting them. If my entire clan is annihilated, what then? It will be over in an instant!”

Just then, a silver light flashed, and a figure materialized. It was a woman with a solemn expression, who also spoke,

“Senior, please wait!”

In truth, Yu Xi had no need to consider Jia Zan’s opinion. The only reason he had not yet moved was to give King Wei some face by waiting for Li Que'wan to speak. Seeing the woman appear, he immediately asked,

“Fairy Suyun, has King Wei gone to Ruzhou?!”

Li Que'wan knew that Li Zhouwei was still in Yinling, but she could not say so now, even though she knew. She said softly,

“Senior, King Wei has made many arrangements. His location at this moment is not for you or I to know…”

Yu Xi’s expression changed. Just as he was about to speak, Li Que'wan gently reminded him.

“Furthermore, your clansmen have already been moved into the Yang family’s formation. Though the Yu clan’s grand formation is shaken, there is no need to fear for casualties! It must be that the Daoist Masters who went there wished to concentrate their forces rather than defend two locations, which is why your clan’s grand formation was shaken!”

In the affairs of the world, fortune and misfortune are intertwined. The very method Li Zhouwei had used to control the Yu clan had now become the reason its people were saved—if not for that action, the Yu clan would have been in grave danger!

After she spoke, Yu Xi finally calmed down significantly. The old man said in a deep voice,

“But I cannot be without worry—if the contents of my formation are plundered by those Buddhist cultivators, I would beat my chest in regret. And furthermore…”

His gaze was grim as he was forced to continue:

“Suyun, there is something you do not know. My Yu clan’s mystic realm is somewhat different. We cannot control its entrance and exit. The entrance is right inside the formation. Without my protection, if the grand formation shatters and one or two of those Merciful Ones steal in to occupy it, it would bring an even greater shame upon my ancestors… Even in death, I, Yu, could hardly atone!”

‘A mystic realm?’

Only after he had spoken did Li Que'wan understand the source of his desperation. The wealth of the great families of Luoxia was renowned. If it were truly seized by these Buddhist cultivators, it would indeed be a troublesome matter.

Seeing her lost in thought, Yu Xi said urgently,

“Though King Wei has pacified Luoxia, many parties are watching like tigers eyeing their prey. They absolutely intend to test the waters, and harbor an even greater desire to invade and plunder!”

A Luoxia under the rule of the Zhao State was a place few wanted to rescue, as there was almost no benefit to be had. But a Luoxia that had almost entirely surrendered to King Wei was different. That was a prize to be taken with real blades and spears. From all directions, every party harbored thoughts of getting a piece of the pie.

How could Yu Xi not see the same logic that Jia Zan saw? Qian Yan and his cohort might be lax in their attack due to a lack of profit, but the Buddhist cultivators in Ruzhou, with a prize to be won, could attack with an entirely different level of intensity!

That was the true source of Yu Xi’s urgency!

Jia Zan could not help but nod in his heart, his gaze fixed gloomily on the east. Suddenly, his eyes lit up.

“It seems a grey qi is soaring into the sky… I fear King Wei has already won over the Tao clan and has sent people to reinforce them!”

Yu Xi’s gaze was half-believing, half-doubting. He pondered for a moment, then shook his head.

“If that boy Jiexing were here, I would believe it. But you, fellow Daoist, do not possess the Eye Divine Ability. How can you be certain it is the Tao clan based on a mere plume of grey qi? It is ultimately unreliable.”

Li Que'wan, however, discerned something more.

‘This old Daoist Master is not just worried about the Buddhist cultivators; he doesn’t trust the cultivators of his own Luoxia, not even the Tao family, let alone the Daoist Masters from the south…’

This thought was perfectly normal. With the grand formation shattered and its treasures scattered, no one could be at ease… On a battlefield, one could not keep an eye on everything at all times. With Yu Xi himself absent, once a great battle was over, everyone would go their separate ways. Who would know where anything had gone?

‘But I absolutely cannot let him go back now! If he is not here, Mount Liangchuan will surely fall!’

Li Que'wan hesitated for only an instant before saying firmly,

“If I am not mistaken, King Wei is surely on his way. If the old senior is truly worried, I will go back and take a look on your behalf first!”

“What?”

This time, it was Yu Xi’s turn for his expression to change.

“Absolutely not! If something were to happen to you, fellow Daoist, how would I explain it to King Wei!”

In his panic, the old man had even addressed her as 'fellow Daoist'. Li Que'wan, however, simply smiled.

“Senior can rest assured!”

As she spoke, Li Que'wan’s form dissipated and vanished, causing Yu Xi’s pupils to widen instantly. Jia Zan, however, had witnessed this once before. His heart was now settled, and the expression on his face relaxed as he smiled and said,

“Senior Yu… how do you think King Wei appeared in Luoxia without anyone knowing?”
