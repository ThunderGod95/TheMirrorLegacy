# Chapter 329: Return

On Wutu Peak, clouds and mist enveloped the surroundings entirely. Sunlight pierced through the pale white fog as a young man dressed in black exhaled slowly. Spiritual energy and qi flowed into his mouth like mist, competing to enter, creating a rather mystical scene.

"Whew..."

A beautiful young woman sat on a large rock nearby, dressed in jade armor. With a spear laid across her lap, absentmindedly reading the light-colored jade slip she held in her delicate hands. Tiny characters were finely engraved on the edge of the jade slip—Wing Clipper Spear technique.

The woman mimicked movements with her hands silently. The young man beside her let out a long breath, exhaling white mist. When he finally opened his eyes, the morning glow was slowly rising on the horizon. His face was full of worry as he said, "The ancestor has been gone for several days, and we have not heard any news."

Li Qinghong, who was beside him, put down the jade slip in her hand and picked up the spear on her lap. She then jumped down from the stone, saying sullenly, "Maybe I should go out and look for him!"

"No!" Li Yuanjiao exclaimed as he quickly shook his head, getting up to stop her and saying solemnly, "When the ancestor left home, he specifically instructed me to take good care of you. I called you to Mount Wutu to guard you personally, precisely to prevent you from going out alone to look for him..."

Li Qinghong flipped her hand to put away the jade slip and shook her head with some frustration.

"Who can calm down like this?! I have read this spear technique from the Xiao Family over and over again, but I cannot help worrying about him. When you cultivate, you keep glancing at the sky, making no progress either!" she exclaimed in exasperation.

Li Yuanjiao shook his head and took out a warm jade from his bosom, which was dim and had faint cracks. Li Qinghong leaned over to look and opened her mouth, but no words came.

After the Li Family became a prestigious clan, Li Tongya had specially sought someone to craft this item. He initially wanted to use items like soul wood or soul lamps, which could indicate life or death, but was deterred by the high cost and could only opt for the relatively cheaper life jade.

As long as the life jade was nourished with a drop of blood for a certain period of time, it could show the life and death status of the blood donor. It was already quite expensive and required at least the power level of the Qi Cultivation Realm to use. Hence, only a few Qi Cultivators of the Xuan generation and Li Tongya had one made.

This item should have been in the ancestral hall. Li Xuanling and Li Xuanxuan took theirs to the market, and Li Xuanfeng's life jade had lost its effectiveness due to long neglect. Only Li Tongya's remained at home, and Li Yuanjiao had specifically taken it out and checked it from time to time.

Seeing the life jade dim and lifeless, the siblings exchanged a glance, seeing the worry in each other's eyes. Li Qinghong sighed deeply, her delicate brows furrowing as she said softly, "In the past, with Father and Grandfather guiding us, I always felt secure... Now that you and I must support the family, the path ahead seems dark and perilous, filling me with dread."

"Indeed!" Li Yuanjiao felt this most deeply among the children, as Li Tongya had personally entrusted the Li Family into his hands. When he took the jade box, it felt unbearably heavy, almost suffocating him.

After pondering for a moment, he said softly, "The effect of the Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit Talisman is excellent. I am now at the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm! Within twenty years, I might hope to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm..."

Li Qinghong had just broken through to the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and hearing this, she was somewhat envious.

"No wonder it is a Foundation Establishment Realm talisman qi... It is truly remarkable. You used to cultivate slower than I did, but now you have surpassed me!" she commended.

As they were chatting, a young man who resembled Chen Donghe approached them. He looked to be about twenty years old but was already at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. He was Chen Mufeng, Li Qiuyang's disciple, now transferred from the market to assist Li Yuanjiao.

"Young Master, Young Lady."

Chen Mufeng respectfully saluted and reported, "Young Master Yuanping requests your presence. He says there is news!"

"What?!"

The siblings were overjoyed, exchanging a glance before immediately taking flight toward Lijing Town, without saying another word.

Mount Wutu was not far from Lijing Town. Li Yuanjiao's Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit had the effect of manipulating clouds and mist, while Li Qinghong's Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow enhanced her flying speed. Hence, their flight was significantly faster than that of ordinary Qi Cultivators. They landed one after the other in the courtyard, where Li Yuanping had been waiting for some time and quickly came forward to greet them.

"Brother! Sister Hong! I have received news about our ancestor!"

Li Yuanping did not wait for them to ask questions and immediately shared the news he had received.

Li Yuanjiao was initially overjoyed as he heard the news, exclaiming repeatedly, "Good! Good!"

After thinking for a moment, doubt crossed his mind and his brows furrowed slightly.

"Can this news be trusted?"

"It is about seventy percent reliable..." Li Yuanping began, aware of the many doubts, and continued, "The ancestor calculated that it was a nine-out-of-ten chance of his death before he left, and surviving would be difficult. Who knew the news would spread like this... It does not seem like something a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator could achieve; if it were a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, it would be more believable..."

"Slaying a Maha Reincarnate..." Li Yuanjiao smiled bitterly and said, "Just think about it, and you will know it is impossible. What about the massive difference between a Maha and a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator? Besides, the Maha manipulates fate; if they die, it is likely a deliberate act... they are probably eager to reincarnate into the next life!"

Li Yuanjiao made a small joke amidst his bitterness. Li Qinghong, who idolized her grandfather, believed in the news almost completely, unable to suppress a smile as she said softly, "The Maha must have suffered a loss. Since the matter is settled and the life jade is not broken, we should wait quietly for the ancestor to return."

"That makes sense..." Li Yuanping nodded, seeing the life jade Li Yuanjiao held. With this, he gradually felt more at ease. After a few more quiet words, Li Qinghong spoke again.

"Now that the ancestor's reputation has spread, it will not be long before everyone knows about this. There will be grand celebrations proclaiming the Sword Immortal Clan, and families around the lake and nearby will come to congratulate us and bring us small gifts..."

Despite her words, Li Qinghong did not look pleased. Her delicate brows furrowed and the two brothers, Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanping, exchanged worried looks with each other. Li Yuanping nodded and said, "The ancestor has not returned yet. With such fame, there will inevitably be some trouble... We will just have to accept the congratulatory gifts with stiff upper lips and adapt as we go along."

"That is a minor issue."

Li Yuanjiao rubbed the Dragon Coiling Pillar sword at his waist and said rather grimly, "What worries me more is that the ancestor has killed the Maha Reincarnate... Who knows how many Buddhist cultivators we have offended?!"

Upon hearing this, both nodded with a look of dread on their faces, clearly having anticipated this outcome. Li Yuanping sighed heavily and said in a muffled voice, "It will not be long before grandfather's reputation echoes throughout both Jiangnan and Jiangbei... Along the river, there are countless sword cultivators, rogue cultivators, and small Buddhist temples. Many troubles will arise from this!"

Li Yuanjiao glanced at his younger siblings and calmed the situation by saying, "Fortunately, the ancestor is safe. Let us wait and see how this turns out."

While they were talking, they saw a figure descending from the sky. Dressed in a gray robe with a solemn and dignified expression between his eyebrows, his face was full of sorrow. His sleeves were dotted with wet spots, and he looked weary.

"Father!"

"Family Head!"

The three siblings cried out in surprise.

The person was Li Xuanxuan, who had been stationed at the marketplace. As soon as he descended from the sky, the three younger ones quickly kneeled in respect. Li Xuanxuan waved his hand and took out a few fragments of jade from his sleeve, his voice deep with emotion and sorrow as he spoke.

"Xuanling... has passed away."

Li Xuanxuan's words struck the three like a thunderbolt. Li Yuanping and Li Yuanjiao turned pale, and Li Qinghong raised her head in shock, her face turning ashen. She stared at the piece of shattered jade in Li Xuanxuan's hand and could only stutter out a few words that were barely audible.

"Passed... away..?"

Her complexion became deathly pale as if drained of all blood. Li Xuanling was her father, and upon hearing this news, her heart shattered. She sank to the ground, covering her face and remaining silent.

Yu Clan, Milin Prefecture.

"Li Tongya?"

Yu Xiaogui's face was dark, and the stone door behind him closed slowly. His aura was imposing, indicating further progress in his cultivation. Kneeling before the stone door, Yu Mugao was dressed fully in black with his head lowered, obscuring his expression.

"A Maha in the north was reincarnated at Duanchen Temple and had already ascended to Master Monk. Somehow... he killed Li Xuanling, but was eventually killed by Li Tongya..." Yu Mugao answered respectfully.

Yu Xiaogui frowned deeply, then sneered and waved his hand dismissively.

"Impossible! I have fought with Li Tongya... he's only slightly stronger than me. What do you take a Maha Reincarnate for? Not even Li Chejing, the sword immortal himself, could handle one!"

Yu Mugao nodded in agreement and replied, "There must be more to this than meets the eye."

Seeing Yu Xiaogui's furrowed brow, Yu Mugao cupped his fist and spoke warmly, "Father, Yu Muxian has already broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and attained his immortal foundation. I heard that in a few years, he will personally visit the lake during the next tribute collection."

"What? Xian'er has broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm?!"

Yu Xiaogui was overjoyed, laughing heartily. However, his expression soon shifted and he looked at Yu Mugao suspiciously and asked coldly, "We are all family... Why do you address your younger brother like that?"

"Brother?"

Yu Mugao raised his head and sneered coldly, "You may see him as a son, but he does not see you as a father! You do not know, Father, but Yu Muxian is now the treasured son-in-law of Tang Yuanwu.[1] He could even betray our own ancestor to gain the trust of the Azure Pond Sect... why would he care about our little Yu Family?!"

Yu Xiaogui was stunned by his words, and he grabbed Yu Mugao's collar in fury.

"What did you say?!"

"Yu Muxian has long seen our family as a stepping stone... He knew about our ancestor's death long ago! We have nurtured him since childhood, spent great efforts to send him to the sect, supported him for decades, and let him build connections within the sect... Yet, when our market was destroyed and our family declined, he refused to say a word! He even conspired with the Azure Pond Sect to betray our ancestor and specifically had Chi Zhiyan warn me..."

Yu Mugao, always a schemer, had long noticed that his brother Yu Muxian was no longer the same. He recounted event after event, leaving Yu Xiaogui in a daze, unable to believe the words he was hearing.

"How... how could this be... Despite our sincere devotion to Muxian, how could he..."

Yu Xiaogui's face was a mix of both disbelief and anguish, making his pain all the more evident in his expression.

Yu Mugao stared into his father's eyes and said harshly, "Father... do not hold any more hope for him!"

Yu Xiaogui slowly released him and took a step back, seemingly still processing Yu Mugao's words. After a long silence, he finally spoke, his voice final and decisive.

"Go get your Fourth Uncle."

"Fourth Uncle has passed away." Yu Mugao replied softly.

Yu Xiaogui's expression changed dramatically, and he looked up in shock. "He is a Qi Cultivator barely over seventy years old... how did he die?!" he roared.

"He embezzled family funds... I killed him."

Yu Mugao answered matter-of-factly, his words leaving Yu Xiaogui feeling weak. His face turned pale, and he clenched his teeth. After a long pause, he finally said, "Go get your Sixth Granduncle."

"Sixth Granduncle colluded with rogue cultivators, selling spirit rice at a low price. I killed him too," Yu Mugao answered.

Yu Xiaogui looked up at him in disbelief, his lips trembling. Suddenly, he realized that something was wrong... deathly wrong. While he had been in seclusion, everything outside seemed to have been turned upside down. His face flushed red as he asked, "How many people have you killed?"

"Fifty-eight of our granduncles, sixty-seven uncles, and one hundred ninety-four cousins, all with undeniable evidence of their heinous crimes."

Yu Mugao's expression remained respectful, but his words were chilling, causing Yu Xiaogui to step back and stare at him in disbelief.

"You... you... wretched beast! You!"

Yu Xiaogui raised his hand high and slapped Yu Mugao hard, sending him stumbling back a few steps. His anger was uncontrollable and his eyes were red with fury.

"Beast! Beast! Is there anyone you dare not kill?!"

Yu Xiaogui's face turned crimson, his imposing aura surging as he cried out hoarsely, "Your Fourth Uncle personally carried you to Milin Prefecture and sought a marriage alliance on your behalf. Your Sixth Granduncle raised me... yet you... you... They are your family! Mugao! How could you be so foolish?!"

"I know, Father."

Half of Yu Mugao's face was bright red from the slap, with blood dripping from the corner of his mouth. Yet his expression remained calm as he spoke softly, "In extraordinary times, extraordinary measures must be taken. Without such actions, the Yu Family would not survive beyond three generations."

Li Tongya rested for a while in the forest. Using his finger as a sword, he cut a block of wood from a tree, hollowed it out with a wave of his hand, and placed Li Xuanling's head inside carefully. He then carved another piece of wood as a cover, meticulously securing it.

His eldest son's death was tragic, and Li Tongya spent half a day using his mana to mend and repair his son's appearance as best as he could, making it somewhat presentable.

Carrying the wooden box, Li Tongya flew intermittently, finally reaching the Li Family territory. He cast a spell to clean the mud and dust from his body, concealed his presence, and entered Mount Lijing quietly.

The small courtyard on Mount Lijing was spotless, clearly having been cleaned regularly. Li Tongya placed the wooden box on the table, used his mana to send a message, and then went inside to change his clothes and compose himself. By the time he returned, the younger generation had already gathered outside to pay their respects.

Li Tongya sat high on the main seat and looked around. Li Qinghong was the most grief-stricken, weeping inconsolably with her face covered. Her beautiful almond eyes were now red and swollen as she sobbed quietly.

Li Xuanxuan had returned from the market. His years of business had given him a shrewd and calculating demeanor, and his hair was now streaked with white, showing signs of age. He stood silently, staring blankly at the wooden box, lost in thought, and said nothing.

Li Yuanping's pale face looked even worse, his eyes filled with deep resentment. Standing between them, Li Yuanjiao's face was sorrowful but he remained calm, gripping the Dragon Coiling Pillar sword tightly in his left hand with his lips pressed together.

Li Tongya sighed and handed the wooden box to Li Qinghong. She wiped her tears and took it silently, not saying a word. Li Tongya, his voice slightly hoarse, asked, "Has Yuanyun arrived yet?"

Li Yuanjiao stepped forward and replied, "I have already sent someone to Eastern Mount Yue to bring him back."

Li Xuanling had a son and a daughter—Li Yuanyun and Li Qinghong. However, Li Yuanyun, lacking a spiritual orifice, had always been pretty much invisible in the family. This was the first time Li Tongya had summoned him back to Mount Lijing. Hearing this, he nodded and fell silent.

For a while, the courtyard was filled only with Li Qinghong's sobs. The younger generation remained silent, watching Li Tongya's weary and pale face with a sense of foreboding.

After the time it took to burn a stick of incense, footsteps approached from below. The courtyard door creaked open and a middle-aged man stumbled in. He was plump, with dark circles around his eyes, and his lips were trembling.

The middle-aged man fell to his knees in front of Li Tongya with a thud, his voice tinged with sorrow and muffled by tears as he spoke softly.

"Yuanyun, your unworthy grandson, greets Grandfather..."

1. Tang Yuanwu was briefly mentioned in Chapter 236 before, but not much is known about him at this point. ☜
