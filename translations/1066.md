# Chapter 1066: Protecting Ting Province

As Li Ximing entered the hall, he was met by a flow of dark light. The man at the head of the room set down his brush and strode down quickly, an eyebrow raised in a smile.

"Brother Ximing, you're here!"

The greeting was surprisingly warm. It was only then that Li Ximing remembered they were technically relatives. Clearly, this meeting wasn't with the Great General, but with his brother's wife's brother.

The Great General's features were unremarkable on their own, but this welcoming smile transformed him. He seemed less like a high commander and more like a common brother-in-law greeting a favored relative, exuding simple kindness.

Despite the other man's familiarity, Li Ximing was hesitant to reciprocate too eagerly. He simply offered a cupped-hand salute and smiled.

"Great General, you're too courteous."

Yang Ruiyi smiled, gesturing for him to sit. He produced a gleaming jade pot and poured tea.

"I've been here for some time, but it's been dreadfully busy. And with you in seclusion refining pills, we've had no chance to meet. I've invited you today to discuss the situation in the north."

"Please, General, speak your mind."

Li Ximing replied readily. Yang Ruiyi, however, seemed to hesitate, choosing his words with care.

"This northern expedition was launched under the banner of vengeance. But after so many years of turmoil between north and south, the Daoist Masters who remain... they all pale at the mere mention of the Buddhists. Their enthusiasm is low."

"King Wei is valiant and a brilliant strategist. He was the only one who could truly shoulder this burden and rally the hearts of the generals. But now, he is in seclusion and has not emerged. This has made the other cultivators even more doubtful, anxious, and hesitant. That is why I specifically asked to see you, hoping to reach him."

There was no chance Li Ximing would let him disturb Li Zhouwei. At the mere suggestion, his eyes reddened. He began to recount the grievous wounds the last great war had inflicted upon his family. Yang Ruiyi listened patiently, his expression unreadable. When Li Ximing finished, he said calmly:

"I understand the Li family's contributions. This time, I have invited you here specifically to protect Ting Province."

Li Ximing faltered, stunned. Yang Ruiyi's expression was grim.

"The Emperor has entrusted the northern front to me," he said, "and I see the situation clearly. Qi Lanyan and his cohorts are still holding back their full strength. Hot on their heels, the Vast Cicada from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm has arrived. And I am almost certain the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple has brought in forces from Mount Dayang as well."

He lowered his voice.

"The Zhao State is immensely powerful. I know this well. To be blunt, our Great Song can't even compare to the Shu lands anymore. Even with the Golden Feather contingent answering our call—though not our summons—a single Changhuai is worth more than all of Great Song."

"This northern expedition... to put it bluntly, it's just a feint to protect Wei and distribute the pressure."

His gaze locked onto Li Ximing.

"The intentions of Vast Cicada, Qi Lanyan, and Gongsun Bei are plain for all to see," he said gravely. "The only reason they haven't acted is internal disagreement. They can't gauge my strength, so they haven't been able to strike a bargain. But once those three decide to march south... I'm sure you know exactly where they will choose to make their stand."

Li Ximing let out a soft sigh.

"Ting Province."

"Precisely!"

Yang Ruiyi's expression darkened.

"A great battle is inevitable. If I make a show of launching an offensive, massing troops on this bank, it might not set the main battlefield, but it will at least pin down their primary forces. But if the court remains idle, sending only a token force to guard the river, the final battle will absolutely erupt in the Ting Province region."

"The Emperor's original decision, at the founding of the state, was to rest and recuperate. He planned to select a Holder of the Profound from three candidates to guard the north. It was I who forcefully petitioned him and set this northern expedition in motion."

His expression was intensely serious. Li Ximing was taken aback, sighing.

"Thank you, General! I had no idea you were thinking so far ahead... to protect my family's safety..."

Yang Ruiyi waved his hand, dismissing the pleasantries.

"I am speaking plainly with you today because I need you to be candid with me. We need to discuss the defenses of Ting Province. I am not here to curry favor with you!"

Yang Ruiyi had laid his cards on the table. Li Ximing, now half-convinced, adopted a solemn expression.

"Zhaojing will hold nothing back."

At this, Yang Ruiyi stood and turned to face him, his brow furrowed.

"If the worst comes to pass, can King Wei intervene?"

Li Ximing's expression was complicated. He sighed.

"To be perfectly honest... I don't believe he will."

If he had given a decisive "no," Yang Ruiyi might not have believed him. This hesitant answer, however, made the general scrutinize him. He paced two steps, his gaze hardening.

"How much longer does he need?"

Li Ximing was silent for a long moment, appearing to calculate with great difficulty.

"Perhaps... six or seven years," he finally answered.

Based on Li Zhouwei's cultivation speed, he should have perfected his immortal foundation by now and be pushing for the Shengyang Acupoint. Six or seven years wasn't an unreasonable estimate; if anything, it was conservative. But Yang Ruiyi frowned.

"We can't wait that long. Five years, at most. He must emerge, or I won't be able to hold the line."

A jolt of fear went through Li Ximing. Yang Ruiyi seemed to realize his tone had been too harsh and sighed.

"Brother Ximing, you are in a difficult position as well."

His expression grew serious again.

"With the backing of the great formation over the lake, how long do you reckon you can hold out against the Vast Cicada?"

Li Ximing asked quietly, "Just how capable is this Vast Cicada?"

Yang Ruiyi paced a few steps.

"He is comparable to Zhelu," he said softly. "He is a first-rank Maha among the Buddhist cultivators. By my calculations, he should be in his fifth reincarnation by now, and he is highly regarded by the Dharma Master. An ordinary cultivator who has just passed the mid-stage would be no match for him."

Li Ximing's heart turned to ice. An ordinary mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was roughly equivalent to a third or fourth-reincarnation Maha. One had to pass the great hurdle of the Purple Mystery to reliably suppress a sixth-reincarnation Maha. An eighth-reincarnation one... that was comparable to someone who had perfected a divine ability.

He had no illusions about his own strength. He just shook his head.

"Backed by the great formation, I can hold off a _typical_ mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator for a time. But my main Spiritual Treasure is currently being used to protect the younger generation as they cultivate. To face the Vast Cicada... I am severely lacking."

Yang Ruiyi clasped his hands behind his back.

"The Daoist Masters from the Qusi branch... can they be called upon to help?"

Li Ximing knew he meant Kuang Yu and Guo Nanwu. He shook his head emphatically. At last, Yang Ruiyi sighed.

"I sent Tinglan to the Mushroom Forest Plains to assist you, which should have been sufficient. But that Qing Jifang is still lurking... How about this, I will have Sima Yuanli join you at the lake."

Li Ximing's eyes lit up, but Yang Ruiyi's expression remained grave.

"If all goes according to plan, the Vast Cicada will not remain at the lake for more than four hours. When we launch our assault on the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple, he will be forced to return. I just need you, Zhaojing, to survive his assault for those four hours."

Li Ximing's expression firmed with resolve. He listened as Yang Ruiyi continued in a low voice:

"I have only one condition. When the Vast Cicada retreats, you, Zhaojing, must immediately cross the river with the other two Daoist Masters and seize the lands of Baijiang Creek."

Hearing this, a flicker of apprehension crossed Li Ximing's face. He paused for a long time before replying,

"If the Vast Cicada has already wounded me grievously, and it becomes a matter of life and death, forgive me, but I cannot risk certain doom to press the attack."

Yang Ruiyi stared at him silently. An unknown amount of time passed before he spoke again.

"This concerns your clan's future breathing room. It also concerns our future cooperation. We will only have this one opportunity for a surprise attack. Zhaojing, you must weigh the consequences yourself."

Li Ximing simply offered a cupped-hand salute, signaling that he understood. Yet, deep inside, hesitation and doubt lingered.

'This General Yang seems to be acting entirely for the Li family's benefit... but even Yang Zhuo is lukewarm toward us. Why are we receiving such treatment? Is this northern campaign truly the singular opportunity he claims it is?'

His heart heavy, he quickly took his leave. Yang Ruiyi remained seated in the hall for a long, long time. After an unknown duration, a sliver of dark light emerged from the Great Void, drifting down to land upon his desk.

It was a black jade slip. A line of small, pale-gold characters was inscribed on its surface, radiating a potent, soaring golden qi,

'Daoist Friend Yang, I have arrived at Lake Xian.'

Yang Ruiyi stared at the jade slip for a moment before picking up his brush and writing a simple reply,

'Be patient.'

---

Li Ximing emerged from the main hall. As he expected, Sima Yuanli was still waiting outside. He gave a formal salute and sighed.

"It seems I will need to rely heavily on Qinghu's assistance in the future!"

He proceeded to relay Yang Ruiyi's arrangements. When Sima Yuanli heard the plan, he was inwardly stunned and confused.

'He's... sending me as well? Yang Ruiyi's bias toward the Li family is blatant, far greater even than that of the Song Emperor...'

Outwardly, however, he smiled and said hastily,

"We are merely working together. It is as it should be!"

Li Ximing gritted his teeth, his mind fixed on the Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill.

"Might I ask Daoist Friend for a Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill?" he said in a low voice. "I believe... you have coveted this Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella for some time."

Sima Yuanli's eyes lit up. He stroked his beard, sinking into thought.

Li Ximing's Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella was only a mid-to-low grade Spiritual Artifact. Its true value lay in its excellent affinity with the Wu Earth Dao, allowing it to resist a multitude of esoteric arts. That was why Li Zhouwei had left it behind. When Sima Yuanli had given it up, he hadn't been heartbroken, but he had always recognized its unique advantages.

'Li Ximing offering the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella clearly means he wants more than just one Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill. Still, it _is_ a Spiritual Artifact. Only a family like the Li could part with one so readily...'

But for Li Ximing to offer the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, he was already at his wit's end. Sima Yuanli had shown no interest in the other items he possessed. And while he had a good supply of Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood, he had other, more critical uses for it and couldn't part with it.

Li Zhouwei had seized a great fortune in spiritual resources from the grotto-heaven. But with Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan both ascending to the Purple Mansion Realm, the subsequent years of cultivation expenses, and the supply of Neck Feathers from the Wave-Suppressing Mansion running dry, Li Ximing's coffers were no longer deep. Weighing his options, he couldn't bear to part with his other, more precious spiritual items. In the end, he had to choose the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, which he had already been intending to sell.

After all, his family had enough Spiritual Artifacts for their needs, and the Wu Earth affinity didn't suit his younger generation anyway. Li Zhouwei's situation, however, was urgent. Though it pained him, Li Ximing made the sacrifice.

Sima Yuanli, however, was quite pleased. He considered it carefully for a moment, then made an inviting gesture.

"And what would you like in exchange?"

The Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella had a limited value. Li Ximing didn't dare hope for something like a Whole Pill or a top-tier spiritual item. He just stated his terms:

"At least three Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pills, plus a supplementary portion of spiritual resources."

At this, Sima Yuanli frowned.

"The Clarity-Truth Spirit-Union Pill... I truly don't have many on hand. If that's the case, I would be willing to add more spiritual resources. How about you take one pill for now, Zhaojing, just to use?"

Li Ximing's heart sank as suspicion flared.

'You sly old fox, Sima Yuanli. You're hoarding a rare commodity! You can see how desperately my family needs this pill, so you're holding back, waiting for a chance to extract an even greater price.'

He started to pull his hand back, signaling the deal was off. Sima Yuanli immediately feigned a placating smile and grabbed his arm.

"What is this? Between our two families, there's no need for such ceremony! Look, I also have a portion of Frigid Tarn Gold. I'll add that to the deal for Zhaojing!"

Li Ximing shook his head, still smiling.

"I have no use for Frigid Tarn Gold. However, I _have_ heard that Daoist Friend possesses a measure of 'Hundred-Heart Soul-Union' from a Renewing Wood. I require that item to nourish my spiritual flame."

Sima Yuanli grew pensive. He finally understood. The offer of the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella wasn't just about the pills; it was a targeted move to get this specific item from him. As for how Li Ximing had found out he possessed it... he had a good idea.

"Was this information from Senior Dingyang Zi?" he asked, his voice measured.

Li Ximing merely smiled, saying nothing.

Sima Yuanli mused for a long time, as if carefully reassessing the situation, before finally conceding.

"This item truly is of little use to me. There is no harm in letting you have it."

Li Ximing knew this man was all surface-level courtesy, but fundamentally stingy. He returned the smile, speaking cheerfully.

"It is a wonderful thing that our families are on such good terms. But we are on the eve of a great battle, and I need to use that item _first_. You can also give me one pill now, so I can experience its wonders. Once the Vast Cicada has retreated, I will hand the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella over to you."

His expression turned solemn.

"After all, the Great General specifically mentioned that you and I must cooperate fully on this matter. It is only right..."

'So that's it! I was wondering why he'd be willing to part with a Spiritual Artifact. He was waiting to spring this trap!'

Sima Yuanli looked pained, clearly reluctant. But with the "greater good" invoked, and not wanting to offend Li Zhouwei, he forced a look of magnanimity. With a grand gesture, he took out the items, stuffed them into Li Ximing's hands, and beamed.

"Daoist Friend, why stand on ceremony! Take them, take them all! As for the Hundred-Eaved Aegis Umbrella, just consider it a loan from me for now!"

The man escorted him all the way back. Li Ximing offered some empty words of thanks, and as soon as he was alone, his smile vanished along with the items he'd tucked into his sleeve. He let out a long breath and descended silently toward the great formation.

Once he reached a secluded, uninhabited area, he immediately sensed the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance. He ascended to that grotto-heaven, a place rich with Spiritual Qi where yin and yang were in perfect balance. He cautiously approached the courtyard, only to find that the one Li Zhouwei used was now sealed shut, preventing him from seeing anything within.

With no one to discuss Yang Ruiyi's words with, Li Ximing hesitated. Finally, he gently placed the jade bottle he was carrying at the courtyard entrance.

'I don't know if Zhouwei has begun to elevate his divine ability yet. I'll just leave this pill here. If he has, wonderful. If not, he can use it when he sees it.'

'It's just... five years is so little time.'

He agonized over it, then took a jade box from his robes. Inside was the Qi of Condescending Radiance from the Imperial Codex of Ten Thousand Chariots Annihilating Light. He also took out a brush and paper and wrote a note explaining the situation.

'I don't know what state he's in, but it's always better to be over-prepared. Just in case...'

Li Ximing finished his preparations and left the courtyard. He passed the High Firmament Pavilion and approached the profound-white immortal pavilion that served as the entrance. The door, etched with bright Profound Spiritual Patterns, was slightly ajar, allowing him to vaguely glimpse the scene within.

Incredibly, a blurry figure was sitting cross-legged inside!

But Li Ximing wasn't surprised in the slightest. Instead, a flicker of anticipation rose within him. He strode hurriedly into the pavilion and pushed the door open. On the central meditation cushion sat a man in white-gold Daoist robes.

His features were stern, his bearing exceptional, and a spot of dazzling Heavenly Light shone between his brows. Beside him sat a pill furnace, with blazing True Fire leaping inside. Billows of smoke and fiery qi gushed out, staining his robes with the fragrant aroma of alchemy.

It was another Li Ximing!

This 'Li Ximing', though motionless, had a faint aura of a divine ability flowing from his lips. His complexion was slightly more ruddy than the real Li Ximing's, and his features seemed stiffer, more wooden. A careful look revealed the clear differences.

Li Ximing paced before his other self, finally drawing the golden Marvelous Scroll of the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body from his sleeve. He held it open in his hands, a look of delight spreading across his face.

"Truly worthy of the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood. The progress is this fast!"
