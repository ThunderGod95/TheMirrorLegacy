# Chapter 903: The Cloud and Smoke Finally Rise

‘Do I block him or not…’

Facing this Daoist Master from the north in the midst of the downpour, Li Ximing hesitated for an instant.

Helian Wujiang's appearance here proved that the northern forces were already mobilizing southward. However, Kui Qi's strength was not to be underestimated. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had more hidden cards than his own side. Under a full-scale assault, the north might not be able to hold…

‘I have to at least stall him. There's no reason to retreat without even crossing blades…’

He didn't spare the attention to check on Daoist Master Luo. The whistling blue-grey aura within his spiritual sense was proof enough—self-interest moved all hearts. With him standing against Helian Wujiang, this demon cultivator from the Southern Borderlands had no intention of leaving.

But even though Daoist Master Luo hadn't fled, he was already looking over his shoulder, his eyes fixed on Li Ximing, ready to escape at any moment. If the cultivation art weren't so crucial, and if he didn't have some faith in the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, he probably would have bolted long ago.

Helian Wujiang stood upon the clouds, a long whip coiling like a serpent in his hand. Before Li Ximing could react further, the cultivator gathered his energy. He formed a two-finger seal between his eyes, assuming a stance of focused, distant gazing.

Seizing that brief opening, Li Ximing reacted instantly. The Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger transformed into a barrier of colored light, shielding his front. On his other side, a celestial gate shimmered, and without hesitation, he soared into the heavens.

In this life-or-death crisis, killing the Merciful One was no longer realistic. If he turned back towards the pass, his Divine Ability, Audience with the Celestial Gate, which required his full concentration, would be exposed to the enemy's blade. Even if the gate itself was tough without its suppression effect, allowing a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with three Divine Abilities to attack it freely… Li Ximing would be coughing up blood and fleeing. He couldn't hold out. It was better to protect himself!

The Merciful One he had just released transformed into a streak of Treasure Light and fled. It had barely reappeared in the air when a bone dagger materialized from the Great Void, shooting straight for its brow.

Li Ximing couldn't spare it a thought. His opponent, Helian Wujiang, already had a mass of black lightning gathering between his fingers. Baleful Qi surged in his eyes as he aimed his fingers forward.

‘Hai-Attribute Baleful Celestial Thunder!’

At once, dark clouds gathered. The lightning between heaven and earth answered the call of his fingertips, turning an inky black as it descended from the sky with a cascade of thunderous roars.

This Celestial Thunder was saturated with Baleful Qi. It was a translucent, obsidian black, and its speed was astonishing.

The first thing in its path was the Mountain-Chasing, Sea-Crossing Tiger. The bright jade bead spun slightly, and the engraved pattern of a tiger looking back instantly released the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen!

"Boom!"

Celestial Thunder was one of the three great thunders. His opponent had also cultivated Baleful Qi, making this an incredibly powerful Dharma Art. But the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen was of the Earth Virtue. First, it could suppress rampant lightning, and second, it could draw out Baleful Qi. It actually began to glow with unprecedented brilliance.

The Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen had been in Li Ximing's hands for many years, but this was the first time it had shone so brightly. If Daoist Master Changxi himself were here, relying on this Spiritual Artifact, he might have actually been able to block the Celestial Thunder!

Even in Li Ximing's hands, the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen still managed to stall the Celestial Thunder for a single instant before it was blasted to ashes by the flashing baleful lightning.

For a Purple Mansion Realm expert, an instant was enough to do far too much. It was enough time for him to raise the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, to channel a Spiritual Artifact, or even to step into the Great Void.

But Li Ximing suppressed the urge to raise the compass. He ascended to the Radiant Pass and lifted his Divine Ability. The distinct, white-jade gatehouses shimmered, and the searing Heavenly Light in its center tore through the rainy night.

Instead of defending, he counter-attacked. The majestic celestial gate surged forward, intending to suppress his opponent's Dharma Body.

Li Ximing had already recognized how formidable that whip was. The Spiritual Artifacts in his possession were too cumbersome to counter it. His only chance was to attack as defense, forcing his opponent to fight under the pressure of his Divine Ability!

‘But this Helian Wujiang hasn't even drawn his sword... He's not using his full strength…’

The thought flashed through his mind as the Reveal River manifested. Blue-green and yellow patterns of mountains and rivers rippled outward, layer upon layer. The Radiant Sun King's Halberd in his other hand flew back, hovering above him and erupting in brilliant light.

Radiance!

A faint bell toll echoed as a pale white luster rippled out, coating Li Ximing in a pure white film. This was the buffing effect of Radiance.

But the white luster didn't stop there. It spread rapidly, drifting lightly onto Daoist Master Luo, dyeing his Dharma Body with the same pale, brilliant white.

The effect of Radiance: buffing allies!

Daoist Master Luo was briefly stunned. Puffs of black smoke began to rise from his collar. The Bright Yang Dao was bright and righteous; although it complemented his own Divine Abilities, it was not at all friendly to the heretical dharma robe he wore.

But he showed no worry or alarm. Instead, his face lit up with joy. He hooked his little finger into his collar, gave it a tug, and stripped off the Thousand-Eye Demon Robe. With a flick of his forearm, he tossed it. The robe flew out, spinning, and transformed into a cloth-like dharma artifact. Golden light flashed from its thousand eyes, captivating the soul.

He swayed his body slightly, basking in the Radiance buff, and rejoiced inwardly:
‘This old master never misjudges! Even a broken house has its foundations. How much more an Imperial Scion? I knew he'd have plenty of good things! Looks like I'll be counting on him.’

Having received the buff, Daoist Master Luo's attacks became even more vicious. But the Mountain-Chasing Profound Screen was already broken. The incoming Celestial Thunder locked on, colliding with the surging Divine Ability and purple flames on Li Ximing's Dharma Body with a deafening screech.

"Rumble!"

"Good!"

Helian Wujiang saw that Li Ximing, far from fleeing, was attacking, bringing Audience with the Celestial Gate down to suppress him. He stopped the Dharma Art in his hand, and the subsequent lightning dissipated. He switched to pressing his hand to his sword, channeling a Divine Ability. The two-finger seal at his nose moved down, stopping in front of his lips as he blew out a cloud of Baleful Qi.

This Baleful Qi was a sickly grey-yellow. It drifted and danced in the air, pulsing with shockwave-like halos as Helian Wujiang exhaled. Celestial Thunder still rolled across Li Ximing's body, but he didn't pause. He turned to the side, formed his own seal, and spat fire.

Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire!

His family's Intercalary Sun Art once mentioned: 'Water and fire flourish, thus they can be commanded. Wood and stone are firm, thus they can be crafted.' Spiritual Water and Spiritual Fire had an innate nature that allowed them to be commanded by cultivators, making them exceptionally precious. Helian Wujiang's Baleful Qi was a baleful spiritual substance refined into his art, and it was likewise at the Purple Mansion Realm level.

Now, True Fire and Baleful Qi, both at the Purple Mansion Realm level, collided. They erupted in all kinds of flames, burning away the spiritual qi and dimming the light of Divine Abilities. They even transformed into specks of violet-black fire-flowers, turning the entire mountain into a sea of flame.

This was the first time since Li Ximing obtained his True Fire that he had encountered a commandable spiritual substance of the same level. Helian Wujiang exhaled the Baleful Qi with ease, as if it were enhanced by a Divine Ability. Mixed with Multicolored light, it twisted into various wondrous shapes in the air, vast in quantity, and instantly suppressed the True Fire.

But Li Ximing raised the Radiant Sun King's Halberd. Empowered by the wondrous Flame-Spitting ability, the True Fire blazed bright and fierce. Its inherent quality was high, and even though it was at a disadvantage, it still managed to hold back the Baleful Qi.

‘But it's enough!’

This brief moment of obstruction was all he needed. Audience with the Celestial Gate was already pressing down above Helian Wujiang's head.

Helian Wujiang merely smiled. He tugged at the long robe on his back, channeled his Baleful Qi, and tapped the ground lightly. Endless black shadows surged up behind him, covering the land. They transformed into over a hundred strange peaks of Baleful Qi, manifesting and rushing toward the sky.

‘Incessant Calamity!’

The brightly shining celestial gate landed on the strange, dark peaks. The two corners of the gate sank into the baleful mist, dispersing the black qi in clouds of smoke and flame. It barely managed to hold its ground.

If Li Ximing's Audience with the Celestial Gate hadn't reached the perfection stage, the gate would have been forced upward. As he formed a hand seal, a realization struck him.

‘His Divine Ability is powerful and versatile, but Bright Yang carries the intent to break calamities and dispel evil. I have a slight advantage in suppressing it. His Daoist cultivation is simply higher than mine!’

But how could Helian Wujiang let him seize the initiative? His free hand had been gathering power on the longsword at his waist for some time. His eyes flashed. He reverse-gripped the sword and drew it in an instant. Rolling black Baleful Qi rose with the blade.

‘Empty Calamity Grasping Light Baleful Art!’

He struck, and as expected, he used the method of the sword technique. He inverted the blade's edge, using the Dharma swords to channel the Baleful Qi of heaven and earth. In that moment, the 'Incessant Calamity' shifted from static to dynamic, its peaks transforming into a sea. The worldly Baleful Qi howled, surging toward Audience with the Celestial Gate along with the sword's light.

This wave of baleful light surged to the heavens. It not only extinguished all the flames burning on Caishan but even dimmed Daoist Master Luo's azure sea below, allowing a Merciful One to escape. The situation had changed.

‘He's getting serious!’

Li Ximing felt a sudden dread. His Audience with the Celestial Gate was bound by the Baleful Qi, and it was too late to dissolve it like water. With a shake of his sleeve, the brilliant Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass appeared, already prepared!

Yet he didn't activate the compass immediately. Instead, his figure flickered like light, descending from atop his Divine Ability trailing sparks. He thrust out his palm, still pressing the attack directly on Helian Wujiang.

His family had been known as a clan of sword cultivators in his early years. His elder clan brother, Li Xizhi, was an expert of profound cultivation who understood the method of the sword technique. No matter how powerful, a sword technique was still a Dharma Art, not a detached sword qi. It required hand seals and incantations to cast!

Helian Wujiang's eyes calmly watched the approaching palm, and a hint of a smile appeared on his face.

The armor on his chest parted, revealing a blood-red chest cavity. Black blood roiled within. His vibrant, endlessly beating heart suddenly flipped over, revealing a stark black-and-white eye on its reverse side.

His cultivation art was orthodox; only at this moment did he reveal the slightest trace of a demon cultivator. This eye in his heart was icy cold, brimming with a chilling might. It shimmered with intermittent golden light.

"Freeze!"

Li Ximing merely glanced at it and felt as if he'd been struck by lightning. A chill ran through his body. Layers of golden light fell upon his Dharma Body, binding him with their glow. He was completely immobilized.

‘It was a trap!’

The look on Helian Wujiang's face turned frigid. He instantly released the longsword that was surging skyward, letting the measureless Baleful Qi disperse. His 'Incessant Calamity' Divine Ability stopped its assault. He was now focused entirely on Li Ximing, his eyes locked onto him.

In that instant, a smile actually spread across the man's handsome face. His lips split open, tearing all the way to his earlobes. He transformed, revealing a shockingly vast, bloody maw. Even the connecting flesh stretched into a thin membrane. With the speed of a thunderclap, he lunged forward, casting a deep shadow.

He intended to swallow Li Ximing whole!

‘He showed weakness every step of the way, all to lure me in close!’

The moment the eye fixed on him, Li Ximing's mind cleared, and he broke free from the mental shock. But the golden light binding his body was not so easily dispelled! He could only desperately channel his Divine Abilities with all his might!

Fortunately, he had recovered quickly. The golden light had only held him for a split second. A bright light shone in his eyes, and he managed to move.

Tread on Flames.

"Boom!"

A chain of Radiant Fire explosions erupted all over his body. All his Bright Yang Heavenly Light converged, transforming into gusts of vermilion Radiant Fire that scattered like smoke.

This Radiant Fire movement technique was not weak. Facing such a crisis, Li Ximing squeezed out every last drop of potential from his body. In an instant, he transformed his body into Radiant Fire. But his opponent was simply too close… He saw the bloody maw retract, and a burst of Heavenly Light exploded!

The Radiant Fire scattered and reconverged, revealing Li Ximing's figure. He was still moving forward!

The entire upper half of the Daoist Master's face was gone. A line of fine, dense teeth marks ran across the bridge of his nose, as if he had been bitten by some Demon beast.

Both of his ears were also half-gone, streaming golden blood. The wound was angled, higher at the front and lower at the back. If one looked down from above, they could even see his constantly working throat.

But he was *still* moving forward.

The only part of his head that remained intact was his mouth and teeth, which were still chanting an incantation. A round treasure fell from his hand—a compass, inscribed with runes of the eight directions, pulsing like a breath, dazzling and golden.

The Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass!

The intricate runes on the compass swirled, layer upon layer, turning pure white. A speck of golden light flew out, locking onto the longsword in Helian Wujiang's hand. Immediately, the world dimmed, as if the radiant Heavenly Light itself was being channeled, casting down a sheet of golden-white brilliance.

The killing light of Bright Yang!

Li Ximing was face-to-face with Helian Wujiang. But Helian Wujiang was also completely exposed before the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, far closer than Chiluo had ever been!

Above, the Audience with the Celestial Gate, now out of his control, was sinking into the heavy black qi, suppressing the 'Incessant Calamity'. The Radiant Celestial Wave Art rose from both sides, entangling Helian Wujiang's Dharma Body.

Even more fatally, a bright light flickered inside Helian Wujiang's abdomen. A cluster of Bright Yang radiance was pulsing, resonating with the attack from outside. He had no time to suppress it. The killing light of Bright Yang was already descending.

"Vmm…"

A blast of light erupted in the sky. Baleful Qi rained down. Daoist Master Luo, shining with golden light, was struggling to hold off three Merciful Ones by himself. He looked harried, but he couldn't help but look up, his heart trembling with a mix of shock and envy.

‘It really is the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass... What a treasure…’

‘Stalling for this long should be enough. But even with the Sun-Surging Star-Governing Compass, Li Ximing can, at best, heavily injure Helian Wujiang. The Helian family has an orthodox demon cultivator Daoist tradition. How could he be easy to deal with?’

Daoist Master Luo himself practiced demonic techniques. Although he was called a demon cultivator in Jiangnan, he was, frankly, still following the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. He was both terrified and greedy of Helian Wujiang's Daoist tradition, and he understood its power all too well.

‘He has his compass to get away. I'm all on my own. I'd better make plans to bolt!’

His expression changed, and his attacks became even more sinister, as if he were about to risk his life. This made the three Merciful Ones wary. Just then, he saw the Bright Yang light in the sky dissipate, and Baleful Qi once again filled the heavens. The northern cultivator had finally regained his footing.

Helian Wujiang had long arms and a narrow waist, with an exceptionally handsome face. His entire body was wreathed in black qi that coiled around his armor. A horizontal slit, over an inch long, had opened on his chest, revealing the cold pupil within. The rest of the Baleful Qi billowed around him as he moved.

‘A Body Divine Ability!’

The surging, baleful Divine Ability merged with Multicolored light, flickering across his body. However, a fist-sized hole was visible in his abdomen, glowing with a brilliant white light from within. The surrounding flesh, mixed with Baleful Qi, was writhing and slowly closing the wound.

Helian Wujiang's face had returned to normal, back to its original handsome appearance. He looked slightly astonished, even stunned for a moment.

‘What terrifying willpower. He truly is an Imperial Scion... a man who broke through to this realm in just over a decade!’

His Divine Ability was a deadly one. Once an enemy was swallowed, his 'Incessant Calamity' outside could immediately sink into his stomach, allowing him to use all sorts of methods to deal with the foe. Still, he wasn't discouraged.

‘There are still ways to fight... Good, he's an Imperial Scion. I won't lose face for the Helian family. But if I can't take his life, it will be hard to answer to the State Perceptor…’

Not far away, the man in the white-gold Daoist robe stood in the air. The flesh on his face was also regenerating. His lips, wreathed in flame, opened and closed slightly, giving him the solemn, statuesque appearance of an idol.

His heart was calm and cold, completely free of panic. The wound looked terrifying, but he had merely lost a part of his body. To a Purple Mansion Realm expert, whose body had no fatal weaknesses, it was a trivial injury!

‘This is the true power of a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator going all out. Not like Yehui, who dragged his feet and refused to truly fight!’

His lips breathed fire as he held the golden compass in a reverse grip. It released a profound halo. Four bright stars flickered around him, and Heavenly Light poured down, confronting the Baleful Qi on the other side.

Helian Wujiang, his Dharma Body merged as one with the Baleful Qi, had Bright Yang light continuously jetting from the hole in his stomach. He held his sword in one hand and his whip in the other. His eyes burned with fighting spirit as he laughed, "Again!"

It was unknown what demonic art he cultivated, but his Body Divine Ability was bizarre. It roiled like a cloud, constantly interacting with the Baleful Qi. The so-called wound was also being suppressed with extreme speed. The Baleful Qi rising from him merged with his 'Incessant Calamity', gradually obscuring the entire sky, leaving only his pale red pupils visible.

"My Helian family established our nation many years ago, yet we can only call ourselves a royal family. Today, I have come on orders. I apologize for the offense, but I wish to witness the might of an Imperial Scion!"

His voice rolled through the air, but there was no reply. All that remained was the bright celestial gate standing tall within the Baleful Qi, its intricate patterns shining, casting its light down like the only beacon in a sea of baleful energy.

***

… Xiaoshi Mountain.

A grey wind howled, and the rain fell in torrents.

Xiaoshi Mountain was separated from the Buddhist cultivators' position by a single path. It was the closest point, the one they defended most strongly, and the first place where fighting had broken out. The area was now a complete wreck.

A purple haze drifted over the mountain. A profound pavilion, a Spiritual Treasure of the Purple Qi Dao, hovered in the air, pulsing with a brilliance that was especially stark in the rain. Layers of light screens shone down from it, dancing like sheer veils.

"Tinglan!"

The woman standing on the pavilion was, of course, Daoist Master Tinglan. She was currently focused on channeling her Divine Ability. The voice from the sky was like a clap of thunder. Treasure Light flared, not to be outdone, forming a five-pointed formation in the sky that trapped the purple light within.

But this formation didn't just bind her; it was more complex. The five of them were drawing upon the radiance of the Buddhist Land together. The power of their buff had reached its peak, and they were even faintly resonating with each other, elevating their combined power to a new level.

The one leading this formation was a large, fat monk with a kasaya draped over his shoulder and a smile on his face. It was none other than the Way of Emptiness's most rapidly promoted Merciful One in recent years—Xuwang.

If one said the Way of Emptiness had profited immensely from the last conflict between north and south, then aside from a few Mahas, Xuwang was arguably the biggest beneficiary. He had led the charge that wiped out all of Mount Bianyan and achieved the status of Merciful One on the spot. Maha Taixi had lost Li Xuanfeng's destiny, and his actual gains were less than Xuwang's.

As a result, his status in the Buddhist Land had skyrocketed. Though he was a newly ascended Merciful One, he now wielded a Treasured Artifact. He laughed heartily, "Day after day, you used that Immeasurable Water and Fire to harm our brothers. I suppose it's not so convenient for you now!"

As his voice fell, five beams of light flared as one, converging on a Merciful One to the side who was riding a crimson tiger. This one remained silent, merely raising a treasured pagoda. It gathered the strength of all five and smashed down abruptly.

"Rumble!"

A cloud of golden Treasure Light erupted, pouring down relentlessly onto the purple pavilion, pulsing with blinding light. The Merciful Ones of the Way of Emptiness clearly despised her. After all, they had fought for so many years and in so many battles. If they couldn't win, they could always retreat to the Buddhist Land. They had never encountered anything as hateful as the Immeasurable Water and Fire and the Supreme Minister's Gourd!

Tinglan, however, remained calm. The Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion was a Spiritual Treasure passed down from the Purple Smoke blessed land, renowned for its defensive capabilities. It was anchored by five different types of Purple Qi, all at the Purple Mansion Realm level, locked within it. Back then, when she and Ning Wan—one defending, one attacking—had worked together, not even Maha Zhelu could break through. Although these five had a formation, they couldn't outlast her in a battle of attrition.

Just as the group was coordinating their formation, clouds suddenly roiled in the northern sky. A pinkish light surged to the heavens, Treasure Light soared, and lapis lazuli-like light rained down.

‘A Merciful One has fallen!’

She looked in that direction. It was where Kui Qi and the others were. Right now, dark clouds were roiling, and the rain was torrential. Tinglan's face seemed to relax, but her heart did not. She immediately raised her head to look.

Xuwang, however, showed little surprise. He just watched her coldly.

To fight his way up from the ranks of Master Monks and become a Merciful One on the spot, Xuwang had never been a simple character. Merciful Ones of his type held a very special status in the Buddhist Land.

The positions in the Buddhist Land had always been limited. The temples had no shortage of monks or Master Monks. Forget monks; there were plenty of Master Monks who believed in the next life. Droves of them would obediently grow old, die, and nourish the Buddhist Land without the slightest chance of promotion.

When a new Maha finally appeared in the Buddhist Land, a few Merciful One positions would be allocated. But the new Maha would bring their own entourage, spend ten or twenty years shuffling people around, and award the positions to them. How could there be any spots left for others?

But people like him, who had gained great fortune in the north-south conflict and expanded the Buddhist Land, naturally obtained a position. His background and his methods were different. From the very beginning, he had been one of Maha Zhelu's most trusted confidants. That was why he had been stationed here.

The moment he saw Tinglan, he knew that for her to be here, fighting against many to stall for time, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition must be advancing north.

Xuwang had just heard word from the Buddhist Land. This matter was no longer just the concern of the Way of Emptiness, nor was it just the concern of the Buddhist cultivators. The figurehead Emperor of Zhao State had personally emerged from his deep palace to summon the State Perceptor and discuss the affairs of Jiangbei.

The Zhao Emperor was nothing but a puppet. Ever since the matter of handing over the Metallic Essence, he had been completely worthless. His only remaining value was his title as the co-ruler of the northern Zhao State. He was like a seal. If the Seven Ministers wanted to do something together, they would take him out, stamp him on it, and make a gesture.

If the Seven Ministers couldn't reach a consensus, who could possibly get him to appear at court? The entire Zhao State court was in an uproar. The State Perceptor of Zhao State had already achieved the rank of Great Daoist Master. It was unknown if he would personally come south!

‘Kui Qi is indeed bold... but so what…’

Xuwang had to admit he admired Kui Qi. The Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had many hidden cards, and the north was a mess without a leader. Kui Qi had been decisive enough. At least, as of now, there was still no word of reinforcements at Xiaoshi Mountain, the point furthest from the north.

It was hard to say what the final outcome would be, but Xuwang's heart was already burning with ambition.

‘One north-south conflict paved my way to becoming a Merciful One. If I can achieve another great merit of expanding the Buddhist Land... then Maha will be within my grasp!’
