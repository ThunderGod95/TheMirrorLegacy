# Chapter 730: Shouted to Death

Guan Gongxiao’s Capital immortals Dao was an orthodox lineage from the Eastern Sea, and he had read more demonic cultivation arts than the Li family had ever laid eyes on. He knew that the Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts that Li Zhouwei practiced originated from the Liang Dynasty, and in truth, it was not far from a demonic art.

Just as the thought crossed his mind, a torrent of umbral flames rained down before him. The Grand Ascension Halberd lunged forward, and though the Profound Light radiating from its tip was blocked by his small mirror artifact, the surging black shadows were clearly not to be underestimated. He hastily formed a hand seal, releasing a sheet of white light.

This technique was called the Art of the Evening White Dispersion, designed specifically to counter cultivators who excelled in weapon arts. It could dissolve sharpness and repel Dharma artifacts. Guan Gongxiao had found it unfailingly effective in his past duels, and it had helped him fend off the halberd just moments before.

But this time, when the white light unfurled before the halberd, a plume of black flame erupted from the weapon’s shaft. The white light withered as if deflating. The Grand Ascension Halberd not only broke through but its Profound Light also escaped the mirror’s suppression, flaring with brilliant intensity.

*Clang!*

Caught off guard, Guan Gongxiao could only pull his Daoist tome closer. Its pages fluttered without a breeze, spewing forth streams of Pure Qi that barely managed to hold the halberd at bay. Guan Kan and Gongsun Bofan broke out in a cold sweat and rushed to his aid.

But Li Zhouwei had fought hard for this advantage and had no intention of relinquishing it. He pushed the Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner to its limit, pressing down with five kinds of Li Fire. This, combined with the Profound Light streaming from his Celestial Gate, was enough to keep Guan Kan occupied.

Meanwhile, Gongsun Bofan, a master of the blade, had barely taken a step forward when a shadowy halberd materialized out of thin air and struck his weapon. The rain-cloaked swordsman exchanged more than a dozen blows in a heartbeat. He glanced up just in time to see the man wreathed in black flames press Guan Gongxiao so hard that his face turned crimson, nearly sending him tumbling from the sky.

Gongsun Bofan was arguably the pinnacle of what a rogue cultivator could achieve; even ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators from prominent clans were no match for him. Yet, he suffered from the common flaw of his kind—a lack of knowledge in spiritual arts and a shallow Daoist foundation. He had climbed to where he was on the strength of his blade alone. He could hold his own against anyone for a time, but he lacked any means to truly turn the tide of battle.

Perhaps after fifty or sixty years as a guest elder in the Capital immortals Dao, he might undergo a complete transformation and soar like a great roc. But for now, he was still just a rogue cultivator.

Seeing the state of the battlefield, Gongsun Bofan knew that even if he made it back, he would face severe reprimand. If anything happened to Guan Gongxiao, the consequences would be dire. Guan Kan would be fine, but what backing did he, Gongsun Bofan, have? He had to risk it all.

Without hesitation, he slapped his storage bag. Three crimson pills flew out and into his mouth. He bit his tongue and spat a mouthful of essence blood onto his blade, causing talismanic scripts to light up across its surface.

In that brief instant, Li Zhouwei’s eyes narrowed slightly. He chuckled.

“So it’s just an auxiliary artifact.”

Guan Gongxiao had always displayed that Daoist tome, making his opponents naturally wary of it as a hidden trump card. But Li Zhouwei’s surprise attack had pushed him to the brink, revealing the tome for what it was: a mere tool for assisting with casting and creating a water domain.

'That Black Bell must be his true primary artifact! And it’s already been sealed at the pass!'

With a twist and a flick, his halberd tore through the protection of the Daoist tome and drove straight onward. Profound Light surged from the Grand Ascension Halberd, so hot that it caused flames to erupt on Guan Gongxiao’s face with a sizzling sound.

'This is bad!'

Guan Kan was the most surprised of all. The old man had clearly not expected that the young master, in whom he had placed such high hopes, would be brought to the brink of death by a single halberd strike. He had still been observing, preparing a spell. Now, his eyes sharpened with horror as he began to channel his magic.

*Buzz!*

At that critical moment, a white halo burst from Guan Gongxiao’s body. A talisman on his chest flared to life, repelling the Profound Light and flames from his face and, with a resonant clang, blocking the Grand Ascension Halberd.

Li Zhouwei was not the least bit surprised. How could someone of Guan Gongxiao’s stature not possess life-saving treasures? He himself had three such items.

But he would not leave empty-handed. In a motion too swift to follow, the halberd slid upward and clamped down on the mirror artifact with a sharp clang. Though the talisman had saved Guan Gongxiao from injury, his Qi and blood were in turmoil, leaving him no chance to react.

The artifact struggled for a moment before the Grand Ascension Halberd ripped it away, slamming it down beneath the Celestial Gate, pinning it securely. Before Li Zhouwei could press his attack, he had to spin his halberd around to meet Gongsun Bofan, who had broken free from the shadow weapon and was charging in with murderous intent.

A deafening crash echoed as Li Zhouwei took a step back, slightly surprised. He knew this man was giving it his all. He met the long blade head-on with his halberd as two shadow weapons blurred into existence, striking from the flanks. Bolstered by the pills, Gongsun Bofan was fearless. Three shadows of water flood dragons surged from his back, each intercepting a shadow halberd. He roared, "Elder!"

Heeding the call, Guan Kan knew this was his chance. He unleashed the spell he had been gathering, which transformed in mid-air into a stream of the Essence of Pit Water that swam toward its target. But Li Zhouwei’s brow pulsed with Profound Light. The hairs on Gongsun Bofan’s body stood on end. Instead of blocking the Essence of Pit Water, Li Zhouwei was aiming his Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light at him!

“He—!”

Gongsun Bofan was fighting for his life to avoid a cold glare from Yehui, not to throw his life away! He immediately fell back, raising his blade to defend. And just as he did, Li Zhouwei’s Grand Ascension Halberd disengaged, smoothly and deliberately, moving to intercept the Essence of Pit Water.

'Why do something so convoluted?'

Gongsun Bofan’s blade was struck by the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light. An immense force slammed into him. If not for his mastery of the blade and his defensive specialty, the blow would have knocked him from the sky. As it was, the back of his blade grew searing hot, and he almost coughed up blood. But his mind was filled with confusion.

The next moment, both he and Guan Kan understood.

As the Essence of Pit Water collided with the black flames on Li Zhouwei’s halberd, white steam billowed out. The stream of water instantly broke apart, retreated, and then dissipated further, scattering aimlessly toward the south. Guan Kan’s carefully prepared spell had vanished like snow under a blazing sun.

“How is that possible?”

Gongsun Bofan stared, dumbfounded. Guan Kan’s expression, however, had turned to one of utter horror. Guan Gongxiao, having just recovered, shouted, "Those black flames are the Profound Essence art from the Great Liang!"

The realization dawned on Guan Kan. He looked at Li Zhouwei, who was wreathed in churning black flames, and a deep sense of dread filled him.

'Profound Essence transforms Pit Water and negates Li Fire. After the era of Emperor Wu of Liang, it was refined to also subdue Converging Water and suppress Mansion Water… this is going to be difficult!'

Li Zhouwei himself was surprised by the power of his attack. The Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts he cultivated contained a latent law-breaking power, which was how he had caught Guan Gongxiao off guard and forced out his trump card. Now, he understood more.

'I only meant to use this art’s law-breaking properties, but the Profound Essence can actually destroy Pit Water. Excellent!'

Seizing this massive advantage, he immediately pulled his halberd back and, ignoring the crimson light Guan Gongxiao desperately shot at him, lunged toward Gongsun Bofan.

Everyone on the battlefield now understood what was happening—everyone except Gongsun Bofan, who was still lost in a fog of confusion. His shock at seeing Guan Kan’s spell inexplicably shattered had not yet faded when he saw the Grand Ascension Halberd coming for him. His shock turned to terror.

But Li Zhouwei was relentless. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light at his brow intensified, coalescing into a solid pillar of white light that locked Gongsun Bofan in place. If he tried to flee, the beam would undoubtedly blast his head apart.

With a sickening crunch, the Qi Refining-level, self-made rain-cape on Gongsun Bofan’s body tore like cloth. He spat a mouthful of blood that evaporated in mid-air. The three flood dragons were simultaneously severed by the halberd and then annihilated by the Profound Light, sending Gongsun Bofan plummeting from the sky like a bird with broken wings.

Umbral flames leaped from his falling body. Guan Kan’s eyelids twitched as he watched.

'That swordsman cultivates the path of the Jing Dragon King, which is also a Pit Water path. That one strike… he’s done for!'

Li Zhouwei had taken Guan Gongxiao’s spell head-on to incapacitate the other man. A muffled grunt escaped his lips, and his scales bristled. He pulled back his blood-streaked halberd, and his gaze swept over the battlefield. Guan Kan felt a chill run down his spine.

'He’s coming for me!'

Gongsun Bofan was as good as dead on the ground below. Now that Li Zhouwei knew his Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts countered Pit Water, he was naturally pressing his advantage. Swallowing the blood in his throat, he strode forward on a path of Profound Light, terrifying Guan Kan into abandoning the embattled Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner. With a flick of his sleeve, he cast out several dark shadows.

The shadows writhed and shifted before him, but Li Zhouwei didn't even give them a second look. Activating his Great Fissure Golden Pupils, he saw through the illusion with a single glance and took a step through the void, closing the distance instantly.

In this moment of crisis, Guan Gongxiao finally managed to catch up. His body, transformed into gray water, materialized within the currents summoned by Guan Kan. He produced a bronze coin from his sleeve and flicked it.

“Geng Metal grants its defense, protect my body!”

Though Guan Gongxiao was no match for Li Zhouwei, his reactions were swift. From their brief exchange, he had guessed that Li Zhouwei possessed a law-breaking ability. He didn't even bother with a spell this time, instead opting for a Metal-virtue Dharma artifact.

A large golden shield instantly materialized in the air. It took the full force of the flame-wreathed halberd, letting out a massive boom as its light dimmed, but the two men had managed to steady themselves.

Seeing the Metal-virtue artifact, Li Zhouwei immediately urged his Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner to descend. Li Fire rained down, seeking to smelt the metal, while he swept his halberd horizontally to dispel any incoming spells. The two direct disciples of the Capital immortals Dao found themselves in a bind.

The reason was simple: their primary artifacts were pinned beneath the Celestial Gate of the Radiant Pass, unable to be used, and Li Zhouwei’s halberd possessed the power to shatter their spells. Guan Gongxiao could still manage, but Guan Kan was finding it agonizingly difficult.

After a dozen more exchanges, the Metal-virtue artifact was already glowing cherry-red and sizzling, on the verge of collapse. Guan Gongxiao finally grit his teeth and said, "This demonic disciple specifically prepared a Profound Essence art to counter us. With Gongsun Bofan being so useless, we’ve ended up in this state. What should we do now?"

The Capital immortals Dao’s forces were far superior to the Li clan’s. Even without Elder Guan Kan, they still held a significant advantage on the overall battlefield. Guan Gongxiao’s only goal was to tie Li Zhouwei down; he was certain victory would eventually be theirs. He had absolutely no desire to call for more reinforcements.

Hearing this, Guan Kan understood the young master’s meaning. The life-or-death struggle was for him, the elder, to undertake, not Guan Gongxiao. In a solemn voice, he said, "Rest assured, Young Master. This old man still has strength to spare."

The old man drew several talismans from his sleeve, applying them to his ribs and cheeks. He bit his tongue and spat essence blood into his palm. Li Zhouwei, having just shattered the golden shield, fixed his golden eyes on him.

These old cultivators all had their own methods. Like Yu Yuwei and Jiang Huzi, they had little lifespan left and were not concerned about depleting their vitality or ruining their chances of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm. They could not be underestimated. Li Zhouwei immediately moved his halberd, stabbing toward the spell forming in the elder's hands.

Guan Gongxiao’s Daoist tome flipped open. He channeled his Sorrowful Southern Water technique, unleashing a barrage of spells with all his might, hoping to slow the black-flamed weapon. As dharma power surged wildly, Guan Kan spat out a glob of the Essence of Pit Water and roared, "Four-Directional Pit-Metal Water Chains, bind him!"

Streams of light gray, watery chains erupted from his sleeves. They were soft and serpentine, and they shot forward with incredible speed, slithering up the halberd’s shaft and wrapping around Li Zhouwei’s arms. Li Zhouwei spun his weapon, shattering the chains, but they instantly reformed. Though their glow was slightly dimmer, they were quickly restored by the full force of Guan Kan's spiritual qi.

"This isn't a pure Pit Water technique…"

In a single breath, Guan Kan’s face grew haggard. Fueled by a desperate infusion of his life force, the water chains were both flexible and tenacious, binding the Grand Ascension Halberd tightly. Guan Gongxiao was overjoyed. His spells finally had an opening. He gathered his power and struck at Li Zhouwei's back.

*Clang!*

Li Zhouwei struggled fiercely, causing Guan Kan’s face to turn deathly pale. The blow landed squarely on his back, making him stagger. The water chains immediately slithered up the halberd, first ensnaring his two auxiliary arms.

The scene was spectacular: an old man, burning away his life essence, giving his all to bind a ferocious, flame-wreathed youth, while a robed young master suppressed him with spells from the side.

The Capital immortals Dao’s spells were not only powerful but also inflicted excruciating pain. After just a few exchanges, Li Zhouwei’s momentum began to wane, while Guan Kan had become visibly emaciated.

Finding Li Zhouwei’s armor incredibly tough, Guan Gongxiao changed tactics and began aiming for his face. While Li Zhouwei’s Dharma robes protected his whole body, his face was less covered. A strike split his forehead open, revealing the bone beneath. The old man cried out, "Just force his Immortal Foundation to defend him!"

If this dragged on any longer, he, Guan Kan, would be the first to die.

Their goal was never to kill Li Zhouwei, but to hold him in place. Once their two artifacts, the Pit-Metal Encircling Chain and the Capital immortals Dao Bell, were free, containing him would be no problem at all.

But as the old man spoke, his concentration wavered for a fraction of a second. Li Zhouwei, who had been silent all this time, suddenly erupted. His two arms strained, pulling the water chains taut. Guan Kan instinctively tried to pull back, but Li Zhouwei pulled and then released, lunging forward with shocking speed.

'No!'

With that one lunge, Li Zhouwei not only dodged Guan Gongxiao's crimson light but also appeared directly in front of Guan Kan. The old man saw a ghastly face of exposed bone and interwoven blood vessels fill his vision. Reacting with incredible speed, he threw up two water shields to block Li Zhouwei’s hands.

For a moment, everything seemed to slow down. He watched, eyes wide, as a dense layer of glittering white scales emerged on Li Zhouwei's neck. Those golden eyes were shot with blood from the extreme pain, and his two hands, pressed against the shields, made a creaking, groaning sound.

A final thought surfaced in Guan Kan’s mind.

"Is Li Zhouwei truly the reincarnation of a White Qilin!?"

The next instant, Li Zhouwei bared his teeth and let out a roar, as savage and violent as a beast’s.

“RAWR!”

Guan Kan didn’t even have time to close his eyes. The skin on his face was ripped away in shreds that flew off and vanished. Sinews, blood vessels, and cartilage were torn from his visage. In an instant, all the flesh on the old man's head was stripped away, flying in every direction.

Only a bare, white skull remained on his neck.

It was only then that a white protective shield sprang to life from his body. Guan Gongxiao, deafened and bleeding from his ears from the force of the roar, saw the skull glowing under the protective shield. He finally cast aside all pretense of dignity and shrieked, "Reinforcements! We need reinforcements now!"
