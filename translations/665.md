# Chapter 665: The Bulwark

"What kind of cultivation method did you receive?"

This was the moment Li Xuanxuan looked forward to most each year. A flicker of astonishment crossed his eyes as he leaned in and asked in a low voice. Li Jiangqian, being very familiar with the three elders, answered quickly.

"A sixth-grade Purple Mansion method, the *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun*!"

"Excellent!"

Li Xuanxuan was instantly energized, joy flooding his features. A Purple Mansion cultivation method was a treasure of the highest order. Li Zhouwei nodded, a faint smile touching his lips. "It really is Purple Mansion-grade… How many secret techniques?"

The text of a Purple Mansion method was vast. Li Jiangqian considered for a moment before answering respectfully, "Father, there are four."

"Four."

Li Zhouwei nodded in understanding. Taking advantage of the pause in conversation, Li Shuwan spoke in her small voice. "Reporting to the elders, Shuwan received a sixth-grade Purple Mansion method, the *Golden Book of Divine Attendance*, which contains five secret techniques, along with a text called *Shamanic Talisman Dao*."

Li Zhouwei had expected as much and mulled over the names of the techniques. Li Xuanxuan, however, let out a soft laugh. "Wonderful… It seems the arts granted by our Talisman Seed… are different from the ones we received in the early days! This is a welcome change!"

Li Zhouwei nodded, his thoughts still lingering on the five secret techniques of the *Golden Book of Divine Attendance*.

'My *Radiant Essence Scripture* came with nine techniques, and Jiangqian's has four… but Shuwan received five,' he mused. 'Could her aptitude be even a step above Jiangqian's? That would be a good thing.'

Li Zhouwei knew his second son well. The boy had a difficult personality, though thankfully he wasn't prone to lashing out at others. Having a peer among the younger generation who could keep him in check would prevent him from acting too willfully.

He cleared his throat and spoke in a deep voice. "Jiangqian, Shuwan, first, write down the cultivation methods you have received."

Two small writing desks had already been prepared in the hall. Li Jiangqian was clever and had started writing at a young age, but Li Shuwan didn't know many characters. Fortunately, the methods were contained within the Talisman Seed, so she only needed to copy the shapes of the characters like drawing a picture.

As the two children wrote furiously at their desks, Li Zhouwei stood by, watching quietly. The sky outside gradually darkened, and a frown began to crease his brow.

"These two cultivation methods," he said in a low voice, "are vastly different from the *Radiant Essence Scripture*."

Li Xuanxuan leaned closer as Li Zhouwei continued, "Back then, it took me only an hour to transcribe my method… Two hours have already passed for them. The texts of these two methods are far longer."

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard. Just then, Li Qinghong felt the light of the screen behind her tremble, and An Siwei's respectful voice came through.

"Elders, Xi Zikang is waiting on the island."

"Very well."

Li Qinghong reacted as if it were a routine matter. "Please ask Fellow Daoist Xi to wait in the side hall. I will be there shortly."

Hearing this, the joy on Li Xuanxuan's face faded.

"This transcription won't be finished anytime soon," Li Zhouwei said. "Elder, if you would please watch over them, I will accompany her."

Li Xuanxuan was torn. He wanted to see Li Qinghong off, but he couldn't bear to leave the two children.

"There is no need to see me off, Uncle," Li Qinghong said softly. "It will only upset you."

Li Xuanxuan sighed and turned his face away. Unwilling to linger, Li Qinghong passed through the screen of light and stepped out. Li Zhouwei escorted her through the winding corridors to the side hall, where Xi Zikang had been waiting for some time.

The youth, dressed in silver robes, greeted them with a bright smile. His round face was full of spiritual energy, and his cheerful, polite demeanor made it difficult for anyone to feel ill will toward him. "Senior Qinghong!" he exclaimed.

He held out a jade slip, which was clearly the *Secret Primal Art of Purple Thunder*. Li Qinghong took it at once and unlocked its seals. Li Zhouwei, in turn, handed over two jade slips. The youth accepted them and said, "I have troubled you all these past few years. My thanks to the family head."

Xi Zikang was impeccably polite. Li Zhouwei took the returned jade slips and exchanged a few pleasantries. The youth simply smiled. "Only your esteemed clan knows the truth of the matter. I have heard of the seniors' reputation even in the north; you are known as paragons of the righteous path. If not for that, I fear others would have long ago found an opportunity to kill me for what I carry. Even with a protective talisman, I would not have dared to enter your array."

"Fellow Daoist jests," Li Qinghong said, her expression somewhat complex. She walked with him out of the main hall and asked softly, "Fellow Daoist Xi, will you have enough time for your journey to the East Sea?"

"Of course, it's no problem at all!" Xi Zikang seemed to have no fear of the road ahead. "I'll travel and sightsee along the way. When the time is right, I will naturally be guided into the grotto-heaven. There's no need to rush to any particular place."

"I see."

Li Qinghong nodded and turned to Li Zhouwei. "The Han family of the Eastern Sulphur Islands has fallen on increasingly hard times, to the point where they are besieged on their main island. Their two elders died in an incident connected to our family, so we cannot simply ignore their plight. On my way to the East Sea, I will resolve their siege for them."

She continued, "With my dragon-aspect destiny, ordinary Purple Mansion cultivators would not dare to plot against me. I won't use our family's name. I will just break the siege and help their descendants escape. This can be considered settling the matter on behalf of Xizhi."

The memories of her return from the East Sea were still vivid in her mind; she clearly had not forgotten the Han family. She took a jade pendant from her sleeve and sent a secret message. "This was taken from Wang Fu. Before he died, he held a great deal of resentment toward that Daoist Master, all of which is recorded in this pendant. The Daoist Master cannot peer inside that great array, so perhaps this will be of some use. Keep it safe."

Li Zhouwei accepted it.

"Also," Li Qinghong added, "in the Quanwu Mountains of the Yue State, there is a spirit persimmon tree. I was fortunate enough to encounter her in my youth. Her cultivation was still shallow then; she said she had another thirty-seven years of Qi Refinement to go. By my calculations, she should only have three or four years left. If you have the chance, please go and check on her."

Li Zhouwei carefully noted the location and agreed to everything.

"Minghuang," Li Qinghong said with a smile, "I leave matters here to you."

"Rest assured, Elder."

Li Zhouwei nodded silently and escorted the two of them off the island. He watched as two streaks of lightning vanished into the distance, then turned and flew back. The night wind was cold, and a thin layer of ice had formed on the lake's surface, crackling softly as the wind blew over it.

Moonlight washed over the vast island, bathing it in a silvery-white glow.

'Now,' Li Zhouwei thought, 'it is my turn to serve as the bulwark.'

***

Li Zhouwei landed back in the hall, the cold wind still clinging to him. It was the dead of winter, and the hall felt desolate. The two children had taken pills to stave off hunger and were sitting obediently. Perhaps because copying characters was slower than writing from memory, Li Jiangqian was the first to finish, handing over two thick stacks of paper.

Li Zhouwei took them, his spiritual sense sweeping over the pages. The contents appeared in his mind, and a look of pleasant surprise crossed his face. "It even has an appendix of spells… No wonder the text is so long!"

Li Xuanxuan had already read it and was now using his spiritual sense to inscribe the text onto a jade slip. The old man looked weary, but speaking of the cultivation method brought a bit of life back to his expression. "It's a good thing," he said, his voice raspy. "None of these spells are subpar."

Li Jiangqian was not naive. While he didn't fully grasp how precious these spells were, the sheer number of high-grade techniques told him they were extraordinary. "The sixth-grade *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun*," he recited respectfully, "includes the fifth-grade movement art 'Tread on Flames,' the fifth-grade escape art 'Crimson Sun's Heavenly Parting,' the sixth-grade spell 'Great Parting's White Brilliance,' the fifth-grade spells 'Li Essence Wall' and 'Sun's Resonant Parting Art,' as well as three fourth-grade spells and several third and second-grade spells…"

Li Zhouwei nodded, his expression relaxing. He had already skimmed the text with his spiritual sense. 'These techniques are all related to the Sun or Li Fire. While they are a perfect match, they don't seem to originate from the same source as the *Sutra* itself.'

He examined it more closely. The manual contained no information about its origins; the entire text was remarkably concise.

Li Zhouwei's perception was sharp. The spells originally appended to the *Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun* were mostly famous; using any of them would almost certainly lead to being identified. For this reason, Lu Jiangxian had painstakingly removed them, replacing them with techniques carefully selected from tens of thousands of other spells, choosing ones that lacked any distinct sect signature. This was the version of the sutra they now possessed.

As he was contemplating this, Li Shuwan hurried over to present the *Golden Book of Divine Attendance*. Li Zhouwei read it as well and exclaimed, "What a difficult method!"

The 'Whole Pill' attribute was inherently of extreme difficulty; otherwise, the lineage of Changtian Peak at the Azure Pond Sect would not have died out. For the *Golden Book of Divine Attendance* to be a sixth-grade method on top of that, its difficulty was staggering. It shocked even Li Zhouwei. Li Xuanxuan found it utterly incomprehensible; he understood every character, but strung together, they were a bewildering fog.

The *Golden Book of Divine Attendance*'s appendix was sparse, containing only a fifth-grade escape art called 'Scattering White Falling Feather' and a few ancient arts. Most of its pages were filled with mystical, esoteric descriptions of the transformations of various material properties.

"Ah!"

As he read, there was a sudden muffled explosion. A burst of fire erupted on the desk before Li Shuwan. The girl flinched in fright. Before she could speak, Li Zhouwei had lifted her away. "What happened?" he asked with a frown.

White flames blazed on the desk, and several furry insects, which had appeared from nowhere, writhed on the floor. Li Xuanxuan had already pulled Li Jiangqian behind him for protection. Li Shuwan, after composing herself, said in a childlike voice, "Reporting to the elder, I was just about to transcribe that shamanic art… I had only written the beginning… and the paper caught fire on its own…"

"Oh?"

Li Zhouwei was taken aback, and Li Xuanxuan was even more surprised. "It seems the grade is too high," he murmured, "or perhaps it has some connection to an immortal…"

"Indeed." A look of anticipation appeared on Li Zhouwei's face. He muttered to himself, "'Whole Pill'… white fire… shamanic talismans…"

He soothed Li Shuwan. The night was late, and the children had been writing for over a day and were utterly exhausted. He sent them to rest, then with a wave of his hand, turned the two piles of paper to ash.

"Elder," he said quietly, "these are two Purple Mansion cultivation methods."

Li Xuanxuan sensed he had more to say and turned his gaze to him.

"This junior has read the clan's history," Li Zhouwei continued softly. "Our ancestors blazed a trail through hardship. Over time, the requirements of the Talisman Seed have become stricter, and the cultivation methods granted have become better. Why is that? In my opinion, it may be related to protecting the common people. The more people our family shelters, the better the methods we are granted… and the harsher the conditions for receiving the talisman. We obtained a Purple Mansion method when we gained control of half of Moongaze Lake. Now that the entire lake is ours, we have even received a full set of accompanying spells…"

Li Xuanxuan nodded.

"This is merely a guess, for now," Li Zhouwei concluded. "The future will reveal the truth. I've noted that the embryonic breathing sections of these two methods are quite profound, so their cultivation speed should not be slow. We can let them begin their training."

Neither Li Jiangqian nor Li Shuwan had been taught the *Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra*. Both of their Purple Mansion methods began from the embryonic breathing stage, so their training would not require much of Li Zhouwei's direct supervision. He set the matter aside for the time being.

"The spells of the 'Whole Pill' attribute can only be practiced by those who cultivate the 'Whole Pill'," Li Xuanxuan said. "However, most of the techniques in the Li Fire series can be practiced by cultivators of various methods. The second and third-grade techniques could be added to the clan's collection."

"Let's be cautious," Li Zhouwei said, looking troubled. "None of these techniques have a known origin. We don't know if some other cultivator might recognize them. I will review them first. Those based on common principles can be distributed for practice, but the more unique ones should be held back for now."

Li Xuanxuan's thoughts were clearly still with Li Qinghong, and he couldn't shake his worries. He nodded and rose to his feet. Li Zhouwei helped the old man up and watched as he stroked his beard.

"Minghuang, you go on with your work," he said, his voice slightly hoarse. "This old man is going for another walk."

Li Zhouwei watched him leave, then picked up the scrolls on the desk. After a moment of hesitation, he picked up his brush and, in a quarter of an hour, finished approving them. An Siwei came in to report.

"Your Highness, Lord Chengliao has already entered seclusion for his breakthrough."

Li Zhouwei paused for a moment. "I am aware," he said. "He informed me earlier… Make a trip to the great desert… and invite Aunt Minggong to return."

***

Winter.

Snow fell heavily over the lake. Li Zhouwei had been busy for over a month, practicing his techniques in his spare time. The *Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light* was finally beginning to take shape. At the same time, Chen Yang, after years of diligent work at the northern foot of the Mount Dali, finally returned to the lake with his retinue.

He entered the main hall in high spirits, clearly bearing good news. "Your Highness! There is news from the northern demon cave! That Lu Ken has returned from visiting a friend and has re-entered the cave. He received our message and apologized profusely, saying he was delayed on a trip to the Helin Mountains."

Li Zhouwei had been prepared for the possibility of never finding the demon. This sudden turn of events was a pleasant surprise. "Good," he nodded. "I will pay him a visit at once."

Chen Yang cupped his fists, bowed, and quickly retreated to make the necessary preparations. Li Zhouwei set down his vermilion brush and pressed his hands on the desk, his mind already piecing things together.

'So, he wasn't afraid because of the Dingjiao affair, but because of the thunder-swallowing affair…'

The Li family had searched for the deer demon for years without a trace. Yet, just one month after Li Qinghong's departure, Lu Ken conveniently "returned from visiting a friend" and re-entered his cave. The meaning was obvious.

'This deer demon… or rather, the faction behind him, was afraid that our family would be tactless enough to trouble him about the thunder-method grotto-heaven. A refusal would have damaged the relationship between our families… But they are quite interested in the Dingjiao matter. They were afraid we would report back too soon, which is why he rushed back after only a month.'

No matter how cunning the demons of the grotto were, they were still a step behind humans who specialized in such intrigues. Li Zhouwei saw through it all as clear as day. He felt no particular emotion about it, only a slight sense of satisfaction.

After all, a dragon swallowing thunder was an event of monumental importance. Li Zhouwei was not so foolish as to go asking a fox demon for help; he had never even considered it. The fact that the fox clan was keenly interested in the Dingjiao affair made his position as the intermediary much easier.

He stepped out of the hall into a world blanketed by heavy, white snow. Kongheng, Elder White Ape, An Siwei, and others were already waiting.

Li Zhouwei surveyed them. "The family cannot be left without a Foundation Establishment cultivator on guard. Elder Ape, you will watch over the lake. Kongheng and I will go…"

He hesitated, then considered the poor relationship between fox demons and Buddhist cultivators. The demonic nature of Elder White Ape might actually make it easier to interact with the fox clan. He changed his mind, deciding to take the ape instead. Without any further delay, they set off into the depths of the northern foothills.
