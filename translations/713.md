# Chapter 713: Floating Cloud Cave Settled

The Northern Brocade River King’s words left everyone stunned. The Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier in Li Minggong’s hand trembled, the flames momentarily receding. Her bright eyes darted toward the scene, and understanding dawned. She let out a sigh of relief.

‘I thought we’d have to negotiate with this imposing Northern Brocade River King, a supposed guest of a Dragon Prince… but it was settled so easily.’

The two demonic cultivators were still gasping for breath in Qu Bushi’s grasp, unable to move. The old retainer’s face was flushed with disbelief, his mind reeling. Having seen much in his life, he sensed something was amiss. ‘This isn’t how you treat a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan. The Northern Brocade River King wouldn’t be this deferential even to Zhaojing himself! No wonder Li Chenghui was so fearless. I thought the man had lost all sense of caution…’

While their reactions differed, even Li Chenghui was surprised. The young man in silver armor and black robes frowned. ‘From the looks of it, the rumors of the Northern Brocade River King being favored by the Dragon Prince… are likely false.’

But no matter how astonished they were, none could compare to Miaoshui. The color drained from her face, all the way down to her neck. The spell in her hands dissipated, and Li Minggong’s Li-Fire scorched several black marks onto her robes as her grip slackened.

“As you command, Your Majesty!” The old demon, Shui Zhao, hastily rode the water downward.

Shui Zhao’s true form was likely a black turtle, a proper steward of a water palace. When the Northern Brocade River King had first said, “enough,” his face had turned cold. He was completely unprepared for his master to immediately grovel, not even daring to raise his head. The sheer disparity left Shui Zhao reeling, making him question his own judgment.

‘“Enough”… so that’s what he meant… The cold words were for Manghuazi. I truly misjudged the situation!’

Fortunately, he hadn’t been too offensive earlier. He scrambled down from the carriage, rolled up his sleeves, and stomped on Manghuazi’s forked tongue. “You patterned loach!” he cursed. “Such audacity, to go around swindling people using my great king’s name!”

The old turtle was a cultured demon, and his insults lacked bite. He raised a hand to strike Manghuazi’s head, but the great halberd pinning the snake moved slightly, catching the light. Li Zhouwei’s voice carried from a distance, “There is no need to trouble yourself.”

The old turtle snatched his hand back as if it had been burned. The hierarchy among demons was strict, and even more so among dragon-kin. Servants like them could act high and mighty in front of outsiders, but they alone knew the true bitterness of their position. He dropped to his knees, his face slick with cold sweat, and waited respectfully by the halberd.

The Northern Brocade River King’s legs felt even weaker.

No one present understood the weight of the man before them better than he did. The Dragon Prince Dingjiao had feasted with this man while he and that Treasure-Scaled Ferry-Beast from the Vermillion Sea had fought to the death, all for their amusement. Though he had embellished his own status and borrowed much of the prince’s influence, that facade was paper-thin before this man!

The demon’s features were imposing, but his posture was utterly humble. “This lowly one is named Ying Hebai,” he said respectfully, “and I have the undeserved honor of leading the water clans of the three creeks. Now that you have arrived, My Lord, you need only give your command.”

Ying Hebai stood stiffly, not knowing how Li Zhouwei would expose him. He exhaled quietly, steeling himself for complete humiliation.

While the Azure-Necked Flood Dragon hesitated, Li Zhouwei understood the situation perfectly. Ying Hebai was borrowing Dingjiao’s prestige to intimidate others, but was he himself not doing the same? Dingjiao had shown him and Bai Rong some courtesy, but his true motives were still hard to guess…

If not for Dingjiao, Ying Hebai wouldn’t have given the Li clan the time of day. Li Zhouwei decided not to expose him. He clasped his hands behind his back and said, “So it is you. We met once, years ago. I did not expect to find you serving here.”

“Yes… I was fortunate enough to witness Your Lordship’s esteemed presence. I have not dared to forget it to this day!” Ying Hebai was momentarily stunned, then felt a wave of genuine relief wash over him. He understood the man was giving him a way to save face. Overcome with gratitude, he was unsure how to respond. A voice, faint and ethereal, echoed in his ear.

“What happened between myself and Dingjiao that day is a secret. Do not reveal my identity, and do not mention it.”

Li Zhouwei had no desire for the dragon-kin to think he was throwing Dingjiao’s name around. They were dragons, after all. He could skirt the edges of their influence, but he couldn’t act like a fox borrowing a tiger’s might. Offending that dragon would be troublesome indeed.

At these words, Ying Hebai knew it was a spiritual transmission. Now he was in a difficult position—he couldn’t be overly fawning, but he feared causing offense. “I invite you all to be guests in my palce,” he said respectfully.

Manghuazi had mentioned that the White Ye Immortal Sect had been in frequent talks with this Northern Brocade River King, Ying Hebai, and that they had many plans. Being unfamiliar with the territory, Li Zhouwei certainly needed to speak with him. He had no fear of being harmed, but with Miaoshui and her people just captured—a fact that even Dense Cloud Cave might not yet know, let alone the White Ye Immortal Sect—he didn't want to lose the element of surprise.

“I have urgent matters to attend to here,” he said. “I cannot leave for the moment.”

“It is no matter, no matter at all!” Ying Hebai replied deferentially. “This lowly one will wait by the river.”

It seemed the Azure-Necked Flood Dragon intended to wait right there in Baijiang Creek for them, which was far too conspicuous. Li Zhouwei considered for a moment. “I ought to accept the Northern Brocade River King’s gracious invitation,” he said softly. “Once I have concluded my business here, I will send someone to you.”

“Yes.” Ying Hebai sensed his displeasure and immediately prepared to take his leave. He was visibly relieved not to have to host Li Zhouwei in his palace. He had Shui Zhao bring the carriage around and departed into the river with a flurry of apologies.

Once the procession of water-kin was gone, Li Zhouwei turned his gaze to Miaoshui. She was still listlessly fending off the Li-Fire, the crimson and white feathers fluttering around her, her spiritual qi hissing as it burned.

The Golden Feather Sect’s Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier wasn't adept at killing, but it was an excellent tool for trapping foes with Li-Fire. It was a vicious, insidious weapon that wore its victims down like a dull knife scraping at bone. Wounded and having lost the initiative, Miaoshui was trapped, unable to advance or retreat.

As Li Zhouwei approached, her despair deepened and her expression grew harder. But then she heard his clear voice. “There is no need to struggle. It is a waste of effort. Put away your weapon and surrender. It will save me the trouble of capturing you.”

Miaoshui had watched the Northern Brocade River King depart, and she had been weighing her chances in an all-out fight, prepared to sacrifice everything but her life for a sliver of hope. But there had never been any real chance of escape. Seeing that Li Zhouwei’s killing intent was not strong, her desperate resolve softened. She raised her brows and called out, “This humble woman pays her respects, My Lord! I have long heard of your clan’s good name and have always admired it. It is only that in my past wanderings through the mortal world, I have been stained by some impurities. I feared tarnishing your esteemed clan’s name and thus did not dare to surrender immediately.”

At her words, the two demonic cultivators also looked up. The cultivators of Dense Cloud Cave were a slight improvement over those from Floating Cloud Cave, but seven out of ten had still dabbled in unclean practices. How the Li clan dealt with them would almost certainly determine the morale of the entire Dense Cloud Cave.

Cultivators like Miaoshui, who hailed from Jiangbei and the north, still had some reservations. They had not yet stooped to the level of demonic cultivators who slaughtered indiscriminately to advance their cultivation. But blood qi, blood pills… they had occasionally turned a blind eye and consumed them. When gravely injured and near death, they weren't picky about what kind of flesh they ate, either.

In truth, these people’s attitudes were not so different from minor clans like the Yuan and Yu. They couldn’t measure up to the likes of the Xiao or Li, but they were a cut above the demonic cultivators and those from the Eastern Sea.

Miaoshui was no fool. The Li clan’s next move would likely be against Dense Cloud Cave. Even if they didn't attack, using her as an example could greatly weaken their enemy’s resolve. She posed her question with trepidation. Li Zhouwei remained silent, but unexpectedly, Li Minggong spoke up.

“Clan Head… Fellow Daoist Miaoshui has not committed too many great sins. Blood pills are common in Jiangnan; it is normal to be stained by some impurities…”

Her words made Miaoshui look up in surprise. She had only met Li Minggong a few times, and she had even injured her in a past battle. Li Minggong was the last person she would have expected to plead her case. She turned her head in astonishment.

Li Minggong’s reasoning was simple. Dense Cloud Cave was backed by the White Ye Immortal Sect. Though the Li clan had Li Zhouwei and Li Chenghui, they were still short on manpower. Even if they had to make a move, they certainly didn’t want to face an unyielding, monolithic enemy who would fight to the death.

‘Even if we are to settle this score… it must be done after the autumn harvest, not now! Miaoshui is somewhat soft-hearted; by Dense Cloud Cave’s standards, she is relatively clean. If we kill her, everyone in Dense Cloud Cave will know they have no chance of survival in our hands.’

With her words, Li Zhouwei had a convenient way to step down. He was already thinking of launching a surprise attack before Dense Cloud Cave could react. He certainly couldn't kill Miaoshui and alert Wenhu.

“Since my aunt vouches for you, I will spare your life for now,” he said in a low voice. “Sheathe your weapon.”

After a final moment of hesitation, Miaoshui’s water sword flew back to her. A moment later, Li Minggong’s Li-Fire vanished. Miaoshui sped before Li Zhouwei and bowed with some awkwardness. “Greetings, My Lord.”

Li Zhouwei nodded. The two demonic cultivators were still held by Qu Bushi. A single glance was enough to tell they cultivated the *Blood Asura Scripture*, the sort of lucky ones who had reached Foundation Establishment by murdering and refining resentment and baleful qi. The demonic energy above their heads practically soared into the sky.

The Wen brothers, who were currently tending to the fire meridian on the mountain, were at least orthodox Eastern Sea demonic cultivators. These two, however, had flimsy cultivation bases and were utterly useless, yet they were stained with heavy sins. Li Zhouwei didn’t spare them a second glance. “Bind them and lock them up on the mountain. We will deal with them upon our return.”

A chill crept into Miaoshui’s heart. ‘Who knows how they’ll deal with me then… I can only take it one step at a time… I just fear that expert from the White Ye Immortal Sect is a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator. If Daoist Master Zhaojing is no match for him, I will have no way to live.’

As her heart turned to ice, she heard Li Zhouwei speak casually. “You must have realized that Dense Cloud Cave is backed by the White Ye Immortal Sect… but having a Purple Mansion power supporting you is one thing, and being a Purple Mansion power yourself is another. For you to leave a puppet like Dense Cloud Cave and join my clan… this is a matter not even worth Daoist Master Yehui’s notice.”

“But if you are feigning surrender… then you would be jumping from the protection of a Purple Mansion to the domain of a Purple Mansion power. No matter how things end, it would be perfectly reasonable for my clan to kill you. It would be effortless, and no one would protect you. Weigh your options carefully. Do not bring about your own ruin.”

His words sent a shiver down Miaoshui’s spine, leaving her deeply shaken. She was completely unfamiliar with the struggles between Purple Mansion powers. If she truly was to join the Li clan, she would be laughing with joy; her only fear was a future reckoning.

After hearing his words, she dared not have any other thoughts. “This subordinate has received your grace and will never have a second thought!”

Li Zhouwei didn't care what she was thinking; he still harbored a great deal of suspicion toward her. “What is the layout of the arrays in Dense Cloud Cave’s territory?” he asked.

Miaoshui’s mindset shifted quickly. “Dense Cloud Cave has eleven peaks and twelve Foundation Establishment cultivators,” she answered promptly. “Seven of them are guest retainers from overseas. Their strength is lacking, and they use demonic arts, so they are not a major concern. Of the remaining five, besides myself, Wenhu is the strongest. The other three each have their own tricks… The two most outstanding among them could probably hold their own against someone at the level of the Azure Pond Sect’s peak lords.”

This matched the intelligence the Li clan had gathered. Dense Cloud Cave was, after all, a puppet, and many of its members were guest retainers brought in from overseas by the White Ye Immortal Sect. Their overall strength wasn’t that different from the Li clan’s.

‘Wenhu will naturally be my opponent,’ Li Zhouwei calculated. ‘Uncle Chenghui and Aunt Minggong, along with Miaoshui, can handle the other two. But Qu Bushi can’t fight several demonic cultivators on his own. Even with Elder White Ape and An Siwei… they can’t handle the rest of them… to say nothing of the arrays.’

If Miaoshui’s surrender was genuine, their top-tier combat strength was not inferior to their opponent’s.

However, Wenhu would clearly not expect a sudden attack. With the element of surprise, it wouldn’t be a simple matter of one-on-one fights. If they moved quickly, they could definitely wipe out those few demonic cultivators…

‘Does that expert from the White Ye Immortal Sect have a Life Divine Ability… And what are Daoist Master Zhaojing and Changxi’s plans…’

Seeing Li Zhouwei lost in thought, Miaoshui quickly added, “Only the main peak has a Foundation Establishment-grade array. The others are all Qi Refining-level and not worth mentioning. And I don’t know where Wenhu is…”

Li Zhouwei simply drew his halberd, sealed Manghuazi’s cultivation, and dragged him away. He pointed to the two lesser demons and ordered, “No matter who comes, just say Manghuazi is in seclusion and seeing no one.”

The two little demons had witnessed everything and were scared out of their wits. Crying out “Elder,” they quickly agreed. Li Zhouwei glanced around, got his bearings, and said, “We’ll head straight for Floating Cloud Cave, drop these people off, then continue north to rendezvous with An Siwei and the others and proceed to Dense Cloud Cave’s territory.”

***

Gardenia Scenery Mountain.

Gardenia blossoms fell like rain under a bright, clear sky. Li Ximing materialized. Before him, at a desk, sat a white-haired old man, his brow deeply furrowed, seemingly weighed down by many troubles. It was Daoist Master Changxi.

It was impossible for the old Daoist Master not to know about the changes in Jiangnan’s spiritual atmosphere. He himself possessed an Earth Virtue divine ability; he knew better than anyone whether this change was beneficial or detrimental. With his three juniors still in seclusion, it was no wonder he looked so worn out.

The problem was, Kong Tingyun and the other two were attempting to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. It was not an ordinary seclusion. They couldn’t be moved, or else they could have relocated from Jiangnan to somewhere else…

“Zhaojing, please do not be offended by my unannounced arrival!” Seeing Li Ximing appear, the worry on Changxi’s brow immediately vanished, replaced by a smile.

Li Ximing had been observing the situation from the Great Void in Jiangbei. He had felt a stir from the divine ability he had left on Gardenia Scenery Mountain and had broken through the void to return. As expected, it was Changxi.

Li Ximing picked up a jade pot and poured him a cup of tea, then sat down opposite him. “Senior has come at just the right time,” he said with a smile. “I was just thinking of meeting with you.”

“Oh?” Changxi raised an eyebrow. He was being as polite as he possibly could be to Li Ximing. He adopted a posture of one ready to listen intently.

“Senior,” Li Ximing began, “do you know of any remedy for a damaged Dantian?”

“So that’s what this is about!” Changxi laughed and shook his head. “Do you remember old Daoist Master Qi of the Xuanmiao Temple? He cultivates ‘Treasured Earth,’ which has powerful nourishing properties. Though it cannot compare to ‘Valley Water’ or ‘Horn Wood,’ it is more than sufficient for such an injury.”
