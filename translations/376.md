# Chapter 472: Eliminating Fu Daimu

Mount Qingdu.

Li Ximing left his courtyard for once and stood on the green altar with Li Xijun. He still did not dare to face his father, Li Yuanping, and kept his gaze lowered in silence.

Li Yuanjiao had just slaughtered the two demon creatures with the jade knife. He waited quietly until the auras of the two on the altar surged and only let out a sigh of relief when they finally sat down, cross-legged.

After all, the immortal mirror talisman was the one choosing its recipient. The two Foundation Establishment Realm monsters would be wasted if no talisman qi were provided. There were still more than ten Talisman Pills at home, which was enough to last them for now.

The Talisman Pills have the ability to aid in breaking through realms... Though not as effective for the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators as Qi Cultivators, they could be taken when breaking through to the late stage. When the Three Aspects Breaking Realm Pill can be refined, the chances of reaching the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm will be greatly increased, and the process will be significantly expedited.

Li Yuanjiao mused to himself as he waited.

After meditating for a while, Li Xijun took a deep breath and opened his eyes first.

His eyebrows were sharp, highlighting the depth and intensity of his handsome eyes. Surrounded by a white mist, he exhaled a breath of white qi before standing up, announcing respectfully, "I have obtained Radiant Snow Pine Ridge and broken through to the fourth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm!"

He paused, his demeanor calmer than before he received the talisman. Any hint of arrogance had faded, leaving a more composed and stable presence.

"With this talisman, my heart is as still as water, dispelling illusions and discerning details. My true essence and mana are like frost and snow, allowing me to cultivate twice as effectively even with only half the effort."

Smiling and nodding, Li Yuanjiao looked at him with approval.

Meanwhile, Li Ximing radiated golden-red light which circulated between his Shenyang Mansion and Juque Court. He opened his eyes and murmured softly, "I have broken through to the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Layer and obtained Valley Wind Leading Fire, which could use fire to attract qi and refine true essence."

He briefly introduced the skill and added with some surprise, "Not only did I break through, but I also acquired Pheasant Flame's Long March, which is a Grade Four cultivation technique."

"Cultivation technique...?" Li Yuanjiao repeated as he delightfully took out a blank jade slip.

Li Xijun, standing beside him, added, "I obtained a secret technique known as Chilling Snow Series."

Li Yuanjiao was very pleased and instructed them to record the details. He took out yet another jade slip and handed it to Li Ximing, saying, "This is the Yang Nourishing Technique I learned from Tu Longjian. I have reviewed it thoroughly and memorized it. Since you'll be working with fire to attract qi, it will benefit you to study this carefully."

He also presented a green jade bottle and explained, "This is Profound Yang Radiant Fire. You should take it and make use of it."

Li Ximing quickly accepted the items, then read the jade slip carefully, and replied with great enthusiasm, "I've heard that the immortal sect possesses a method to cultivate spirit fire internally... It allows one to draw the spirit fire of heaven and earth into their Shenyang Mansion, where it can be used to refine pills internally or expelled for defense. With Valley Wind Leading Fire, I'll be able to use it to refine pills too!"

"Profound Yang Radiant Fire is too volatile and intense for pill refinement. I plan to convert it to Long Marching Fire Essence, which is more suitable for refining pills and practicing the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique," he added.

Li Yuanjiao smiled with satisfaction, nodding repeatedly as he said, "That's exactly my intention!"

Li Ximing sighed in regret and continued, "It's a pity that this technique requires Long Marching Fire Essence rather than Spring Sun Spirit Fire. The Yang Nourishing Technique Manual lists over a dozen types of spirit fires. Spring Sun Spirit Fire is like the gentle spring sun, warm and nurturing, making it ideal for alchemy... It would be perfect if we had both types of spirit fire..."

"Hahahaha!"

In good spirits, Li Yuanjiao patted his shoulder and reminded him, "Fortunately, we acquired the Yang Nourishing Technique and the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique manuals through the immortal mirror, which is beyond our destiny. If we could also have the best spirit fire for alchemy, I would suspect this is a trap set up by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators!"

Li Xijun had been standing close by, holding the Chilling Snow Series thoughtfully. Noticing Li Yuanjiao's smile, he said, "I'll descend the mountain to find someone to gather the necessary spiritual qi and cultivate this."

Li Yuanjiao nodded and addressed Li Ximing, "Don't worry about the spirit fire for now. Gathering the required spirit items will take some time... I'll send someone to look for them. You two should focus on stabilizing your cultivation in the meantime. There's no need to rush things! Stay in seclusion on the mountain for a few years and find an excuse for the changes in your cultivation."

Li Ximing and Li Xijun both cupped their fists and replied in unison, "Understood! We will follow your command."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Yuanjiao had been cultivating on Mount Qingdu for over a month when Fei Luoya arrived as scheduled.

Fei Luoya called out in front of the green mountain gate. Li Wushao emerged from the lake and, upon seeing Fei Luoya, called out loudly, "I am Li Wushao... What brings you here, Senior?"

"Hooked Serpent...?"

Fei Luoya, who was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, had bloodshot eyes that made him look rather intimidating.

He immediately recognized Li Wushao's true form and replied, "Eastern Sea demon tribe... It is indeed a blessing for you to be part of the Li Family."

Fei Luoya, hailing from Mount Yue, usually spoke in an authoritative and somewhat arrogant manner. He only softened his tone when addressing Li Tongya.
ùôõùìªùíÜùíÜùíòùôöùì´ùô£ùô§ùíóùôöùìµ.ùôòùô§ùô¢

Li Wushao nodded and praised, "Senior, you have sharp eyes."

Li Yuanjiao soon approached and cupped his fist, and greeted the man politely. However, Fei Luoya wasted no time and asked directly, "What news do you have? Can Li Tongya be of assistance? Shall we proceed with eliminating Fu Daimu immediately?"

Li Yuanjiao replied, "I've checked with people in the sect. Fu Daimu had a close friend who joined Azure Pond but died in the devil plague and has no significant backing. However, he does have a certain partnership with the peak master of Fuchen Peak among the thirty-six peaks."

Surprised to hear that the guy actually had connections with people in the Azure Pond Sect, Fei Luoya hurriedly asked, "What should we do then?"

Li Yuanjiao replied softly, "My son has looked into it. Their relationship is strictly transactional and Fuchen Peak doesn't want anything else to do with this person. After you and I deal with him, we can send some precious panacea to this fellow Daoist as a gesture of goodwill and forget about the whole thing."

Fei Luoya was delighted and exclaimed, "Thanks to the connections of your esteemed family, we now have many options!"

Li Yuanjiao smiled, already planning the next moves in his heart.

Fuchen Peak's master, Li Encheng, also known as Water Wall Pearl, is one of the few middle-class alchemists in the Azure Pond Sect and has been at the peak of Foundation Establishment Realm for many years. He will dismiss this small issue as he only views this person as a pawn for selling treasured panaceas.

Who knows, when we have Xizhi send a treasured panacea over, it could open up beneficial connections for him! If this young man has more influence in the sect, it will be advantageous for us too.

Most people from Mount Yue were fierce, and since Fei Luoya was eager to kill Fu Daimu, waiting for another day was no different than torturing him. He wanted to act immediately and urged anxiously, "What are we waiting for then, fellow Daoist? Let us set off immediately!"

Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist and explained, "Elders in the family are not permitted to act impulsively. We'll have to wait for another Daoist friend with Sprawling Azure Mountain."

Fei Luoya had no choice but to wait patiently. After more than a day, he saw a red light shooting through the sky. Yuan Chengdun arrived in a red jade boat which he slowly docked in front of the mountain.

He disembarked and stowed the boat away, smiling apologetically as he said, "My apologies for being late, I had to go to Helin Prefecture before coming here."

"No problem!"

Li Yuanjiao looked at the two men. Li Wushao, who had been hovering above the lake, also flew over and stood behind him.

Li Yuanjiao then nodded and said, "I have a powerful formation in hand. Fu Daimu won't be able to escape."

They all took off with the wind as Fei Luoya said, "Zhu Xian, my subordinate at the early stage of Foundation Establishment Realm, is keeping watch on Fu Daimu.

"With three in the early stage, two in the middle stage, and Yuan Chengdun's particular strength along with this formation, we won't fail!" Li Yuanjiao assured.

However, in his mind, he thought to himself, Even if this person were to change sides and ally with Fu Daimu against me, with Yuan Chengdun and the formation at my disposal, I would be well-positioned enough to advance or retreat without any issues.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Mount Wu was where Duanmu Kui used to cultivate. He was a peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had an immortal book in his possession, and his strength put him among the greatest Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan. Any Mount Yue cultivators who received pointers from him could become a formidable force.

Duanmu Kui never took these matters too seriously. He merely cultivated on Mount Wu where his disciples and descendants multiplied. He had been in seclusion there for over two hundred years, and there were twenty-nine Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators from Mount Yue under his command.

When Duanmu Kui died suddenly, he left nothing for his disciples and descendants. The Mount Yue cultivators scattered like birds and beasts. Fu Daimu, Fei Luoya, and other powerful figures divided the territory of Mount Yue. The strongest among them, Jiao Zhongzi, took over Mount Wu, while Fu Daimu established himself in Great Jueting.

Fei Luoya, who was still riding the wind, explained, "Fu Daimu and I have had many conflicts over Mount Wu... He dislikes me and is far stronger. I've been secluding myself in my territory these years, ready to escape at any moment. But in today's world... who knows what's happening outside? I figured I should eliminate him as soon as possible."

The group chose a landing spot. Fei Luoya's subordinate, Zhu Xian, also arrived on the wind. He looked like a pure Easterner with nice facial features, and he was holding a rattan whip in hand.

"Zhu Xian greets fellow Daoists," he greeted while cupping his fist respectfully.

Li Yuanjiao returned the greeting along with others and then proceeded to set up the formation plate.

Fei Luoya then said, "We still need to lure him here. Please come with me, Daoist Yuan. That guy is cautious, and if we're not equally strong, he'll be suspicious and won't dare to chase after me."

Yuan Chengdun nodded in agreement.

"You and I will engage him in combat for a while, and Zhe Ledai, in the early stage of Foundation Establishment Realm, will definitely act. We'll pretend not to know and lure the enemy into the trap..."

As he left, his conversation with Fei Luoya gradually faded.

Li Yuanjiao watched them depart, narrowing his eyes slightly. He discreetly activated the Profound Patterned Bottle and followed from a distance. When he saw bursts of shamanic spells and mana light flashing in Great Jueting as well as Fei Luoya's yell of feigned surprise and anger, he retreated.

Soon after, two mana lights pursued him. Fu Daimu, in the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, appeared as a wrinkled old man with a strong build and a long halberd. Zhe Ledai looked strong too, cursing as he wielded his dual swords with pride.

As the four men entered the formation, a green light quickly enveloped them and their expressions changed suddenly. Fei Luoya laughed wildly, and Fu Daimu, looking around, sneered at Zhu Xian.

"Junior brother...? I fear you've made a grave mistake!"

Zhu Xian, holding his long whip, replied calmly, "Thank you for your concern, Senior Brother. I came here today seeking additional resources for my cultivation."

Fu Daimu did not argue but instead glanced at Li Wushao and remarked, "You've even found a Hooked Serpent! Two at the early stage, two at the mid stage, and a major formation... It seems you're well prepared!"

Confident in his trump card, Fu Daimu entered the formation with no fear, laughing as he said, "Too bad, you've underestimated us!"

Zhe Ledai, wielding two swords, showed no change in his expression. He engaged Zhu Xian and Li Wushao directly, using his swords to block their oncoming attacks with steady precision.

Meanwhile, Fu Daimu fought against Yuan Chengdun and Fei Luoya. The clash was intense, filled with golden light and the scent of blood, and it was creating a huge commotion.

Li Yuanjiao, concealed by spirit mist, silently approached. Compared to the other three, Li Wushao's group seemed more mediocre. Despite being Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, they were more like three rogue cultivators that were still wielding Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts.

Zhe Ledai and Zhu Xian seemed unfamiliar with powerful spells, relying instead on their immortal foundations to test each other's strength. Although Li Wushao used to be formidable, he had grown weaker after losing the hooks on his tail.

Gradually, Li Yuanjiao closed in on the three men. He unsheathed the Qingche Sword, its green-white light flashing brightly. Zhe Ledai's expression changed as he raised his sword to block instantly.

"Not good!"

The Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifact in Zhe Ledai's hand proved inadequate against the Qingche Sword. Li Yuanjiao had been gathering power for a long time, and the sword arc of the Celestial Moon Slash technique blazed brightly, striking Zhe Ledai's swords with such a powerful impact that it shattered them with a loud crack, sending sword fragments flying everywhere in all directions.

As Zhe Ledai struggled to defend himself, Li Wushao's snake tail sliced through the air powerfully, and Zhu Xian attacked relentlessly. The combined assault forced Zhe Ledai to spit blood, and he struggled to fend off yet another deadly strike from the Qingche Sword.

At that moment, Zhe Ledai felt a chill at his neck, a sense of dread filling his body completely. With a horrified cry, he realized as he exclaimed out loud, "Oh no... It's Jing Dragon King!"

His blood qi surged as he activated his shamanic spells. His true essence glowed a bright red as he glanced back, just in time to see a massive bluish-gray serpent dragon hurtling straight toward him. He raised his sword in defense and shouted, "Senior Brother! Hurry up!"

As a newly promoted Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Zhe Ledai's strength was formidable. He blocked Zhu Xian and Li Wushao with his two swords impressively. If Li Yuanjiao had to face him alone, it would definitely have been a challenging battle.

However, the ambush was sudden. Li Yuanjiao's attack was immediate and extremely powerful, catching Zhe Ledai off guard. However, he was not seriously injured.

Fu Daimu, noticing Zhe Ledai's struggle, knew that despite his best efforts, he could not force Yuan Chengdun's immortal foundation out of its position. With a frustrated sigh, Fu Daimu raised his sleeve, releasing a black and red artifact.

"Mountain of Human Heads!"

The dharma artifact expanded rapidly, its black and red surface covered with thousands of human heads. They stared, drooled, and howled. Their long black hair fluttered in the air, creating chilling gusts of wind.

Fei Luoya waved his hands and unleashed two streams of mana light, sneering as he said, "You went to the Jiang Family to seek cultivation methods, observed the Jade Smoke Mountain three times, and ended up making such a grotesque imitation of it?"

Despite his mockery, Fei Luoya remained vigilant, activating his Immortal Foundation Untraceable Presence, and vanished from plain sight.

The Mountain of Human Heads loomed menacingly, its filthy, eerie sounds filling the air.
ùíªùëüùò¶ùò¶ùò∏‚ÑØùí∑ùëõùò∞ùìã‚ÑØùò≠.ùò§ùò∞ùòÆ

Yuan Chengdun remained calm as the shadow of the enormous dharma artifact enveloped him. Holding his short rods tightly, golden patterns began to crawl up his face.

"Beast! Absurd! You dare use a demonic mountain to suppress me?"

With a burst of golden light, Yuan Chengdun activated his Sprawling Azure Mountain. He struck the massive mountain forcefully with his two rods, so fast that they turned into a golden blur.

RUMBLE!

The impact caused black smoke to billow from the Mountain of Human Heads. The human heads on it all screamed in unison, creating a loud cacophony. Yuan Chengdun continued with his relentless assault, his short rods smashing the dharma artifact with increasing speed, causing it to continue rumbling loudly.

Meanwhile, Fu Daimu, having just rescued Zhe Ledai, swept Li Yuanjiao and the others aside with a wave of his sleeve.

His face turned pale as he looked back, stunned.

"Sprawling Azure Mountain?! You're Yuan Chengdun!" he exclaimed in shock.

Yuan Chengdun's reputation was built by eliminating adversaries one after another.

Back when devil cultivators ravaged Mushroom Forest Plain, he defeated three-figure devil cultivators single-handedly. Three Foundation Establishment Realm devil cultivators even attempted to ambush him within a formation, yet he overcame them effortlessly and escaped unscathed.

In comparison, Xiao Yongling, the Man on Mount Feather, also fought against three opponents simultaneously. Although he emerged victorious, he sustained serious injuries, and his reputation never reached the heights of Yuan Chengdun's.

Fu Daimu recognized him from afar and, now with fear evident in his voice, called out, "You're... Daoist Yuan! Please reconsider your actions, I have backers within the sect!"
ùöèùï£ùïñùöéùö†ùöéùöãùöóùê®ùêØùïñùïù.ùïîùê®ùïû

Li Tongya had slain the Maha with his sword, shocking the world, and became a renowned figure in Jiangnan. Yuan Chengdun's Sprawling Azure Mountain placed him among the top ten Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the last hundred years, so it was no wonder why Fu Daimu was momentarily thrown into disarray.

Yuan Chengdun did not respond, and only shook his head with a small smile. The Yuan Family had far more connections within the sect than the Li Family, so how could they not see through the trick? At that moment, he was just amused by Fu Daimu's threat.

Sprawling Azure Mountain excels at attacking and subduing evil, and this person's rod technique can be considered high-grade...

Fu Daimu's face darkened. Despite his surging mana, he was contemplating to escape. However, with the opponent's large formation and physical prowess, the success rate of his escape remained uncertain. His Dao Companion was still making breakthroughs in Great Jueting. Even if he could escape this time, they would still ambush him next time.

The odds stacked against him were just too high.

Li Yuanjiao and the others had no intention of giving him a chance to catch his breath, and various spells and sword techniques bombarded him relentlessly. Once again, Zhe Ledai lifted his broken dual swords to defend himself.

"Senior Brother, where did Fei Luoya find so many allies? I'm afraid we won't be able to get away today..." he said grimly.

Fu Daimu's spiritual sense continued to patrol the air, trying to locate Fei Luoya who had disappeared. With a surge of black qi in his hand, he smashed the incoming sword qi with his palm.

"I've underestimated this Fei Luoya! On one hand, he's begging for forgiveness; on the other, he's planning an ambush on me... If I had known, I wouldn't have trusted him!"

His expression grew more somber as he squeezed these words through his gritted teeth.

Zhe Ledai remained fully focused, gathering mana light as he held his swords up in front of him, blocking the maw of a lunging serpent dragon.

"Senior Brother! This is getting out of hand, it'll be difficult for both of us to escape alive. You have the Profound Light Escape Technique, please go quickly! I will stop them here for you," he transmitted his voice through mana.

Fu Daimu's subordinate was known for his calm demeanor and high talent. Promoted and recommended by Fu Daimu to train on Mount Wu, Zhe Ledai had always been loyal to him. And at this moment, he was already prepared to sacrifice himself.

Fu Daimu gritted his teeth and shook his head. On the other end, Yuan Chengdun continued striking the Mountain of Human Heads relentlessly with his rods as if it were a drum. As Fu Daimu was about to speak, a stream of red light suddenly appeared before him, shocking him into clasping his hands together in terror.

At that moment, Fu Daimu activated his immortal foundation, Descending Souls, his body releasing black light that enveloped his entire body like a veil or mist. A shrill whistling sound echoed, momentarily stunning the few early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in their places.

Clang!

Fu Daimu's hands radiated black light as he pressed them against Fei Luoya's dharma sword. The flowing red light from the dharma sword scorched his hands, causing black smoke to rise from the contact. He spat out another stream of black light from his mouth, forcing Fei Luoya to retreat, and only then could he finally catch his breath.

Although Fei Luoya was highly talented, he was still a rogue cultivator. Aside from Mount Wu's shamanic spells, he had only learned a few Grade Two spells which were not very powerful. Hence, he could only rely on his immortal foundation to challenge Fu Daimu. At that moment, instead of being defeated, he chose to withdraw and disappear.

Zhe Ledai breathed a sigh of relief as he fended off Li Wushao's attack, whispering urgently, "Senior brother, hurry up and go!"

Fu Daimu realized he could not afford to linger here any longer. He performed a hand seal to cast a spell, causing the black light of the Mountain of Human Heads to blossom intensely, briefly overshadowing Yuan Chengdun's golden light. With his other hand, he unleashed three talismans which illuminated a golden light as he activated the shamanic spell.

As Fu Daimu performed a series of maneuvers, Zhe Ledai's body also radiated a surge of blood-red light. His life essence burned, and his dual swords shimmered with dazzling light. Shifting into a guarding stance instead, he attacked ferociously like a tiger.

Fei Luoya suddenly reappeared, the dharma sword in his hand dancing as red light erupted around him. He quickly shouted, "He's going to use an escape technique! Don't let him escape!"

During the plague, a devil cultivator had also used a similar escape technique, transforming into a red light and zooming away. The Li Family had no way to stop it and could only allow him to escape at the time.

The escape spells differed from escape techniques. Most escape techniques only enhanced speed, whereas most escape spells involved changing forms and shuttling back and forth, crossing dangerous lands and large formations. However, they were very difficult to cultivate.

Li Yuanjiao saw Fu Daimu using defensive talismans and almost simultaneously guessed his intention. He pressed forward, calling out to the others, "Keep Fu Daimu from leaving!"

Allowing a late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm Mount Yue cultivator from Mount Wu to escape would spell disaster for the Li Family in the future.

Those from Mount Yue had nothing to lose, but Li Yuanjiao and Yuan Chengdun had families to consider. Hence, the two were most nervous about letting their enemies slip away.

Yuan Chengdun bellowed angrily as he summoned the strength to topple over the Mountain of Human Heads. The strain caused his face to turn red, but he dared not catch his breath and quickly flew to Li Yuanjiao's side.

Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao pressed on, meeting the defense of a Foundation Establishment Realm talisman head-on. He activated his Jing Dragon King, conjuring a grayish-green serpent dragon that exploded into a series of mana water splashes upon colliding with the talisman.

Being quite versed in talisman cultivation, the three Foundation Establishment Realm talismans Fu Daimu had unleashed were powerful.

The series of attacks from Li Yuanjiao and Fei Luoya only managed to penetrate two layers of Fu Daimu's defense. Holding his ground, Fu Daimu seized this opportunity to cast his spells.

Fei Luoya's face paled as he clenched his teeth, biting off a piece of his tongue. Puffing up his cheeks, he spat out a blood arrow, shaking the golden light shield.

Seizing the moment to act, Li Yuanjiao sprang to his feet and thrust his Qingche Sword forward with ferocious intensity.

Rumble!

A ball of blood light exploded in the air. Despite being an early Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Zhe Ledai relied on his own strength to repel both Li Wushao and Zhu Xian. Still possessing enough power to counterattack, he drove his dual swords into Li Yuanjiao's back with all his might.

Li Yuanjiao was unwilling to give up on the rare opportunity he had been waiting for. As he seemed on the verge of surrender, the Six-Stone Cloud Plate suddenly appeared behind him.

Amidst the earth-yellow glow, the Profound Patterned Bottle released a profound spirit mist, effectively blocking the incoming swords.

Clang!

The Qingche Sword pierced through the remaining spell shield. The greenish-white sword light surged directly toward Fu Daimu's face.

Pfft!

Fu Daimu caught the Qingche Sword firmly with his hand but the sharp sword qi pierced through the back of his hand. The old man from Mount Yue was furious, his eyes reddening even more as the spell in his hand had been interrupted.

Li Yuanjiao was also taking a beating as he had concentrated all his mana and true essence into the Qingche Sword. Although the Six-Stone Cloud Plate and Profound Patterned Bottle were still activated, Zhe Ledai's dual sword penetrated them easily, causing Li Yuanjiao to spit out fresh blood with the vibration of their mana.

Fu Daimu's heart filled with rage. After such a delay, Yuan Chengdun, having toppled over the Mountain of Human Heads, had already arrived in front of him. His murderous aura was intense as he swung the two golden rods that were aimed directly at Fu Daimu.

The outcome has been decided.

Li Yuanjiao stepped back as he took a healing pill, and quietly observed the ensuing battle.

Zhe Ledai was already in a dire situation under the siege of Li Wushao and Zhu Xian. Fu Daimu was retreating from Yuan Chengdun's relentless attacks, and he also had to guard against Fei Luoya. The tide had clearly turned against him.

We'll just have to watch out for any desperate counterattack in his final moments.

Li Yuanjiao advanced with his sword, a profound spirit mist enveloping his body as he hovered on the edge of the battlefield, silently waiting for his opponents to exhaust their strength.

Zhe Ledai was already using secret techniques. Being surrounded by the three adversaries, he was soon covered in wounds and bloody holes, wilting under the assault. Li Wushao transformed into his true form, crushing Zhe Ledai's lower body with his tail while Zhu Xian lashed out with a rattan whip, tearing off his opponent's head.

"Junior Brother!!"

Fu Daimu had been his friend for over a hundred years. At that moment, tears welled up in his eyes and he nearly lost his mind from the grief. He had pushed the spell in his hand and his immortal foundation to its limit, yet he still could not escape.

Yuan Chengdun's power had grown increasingly formidable, and each strike he delivered was enhanced by the power of his immortal foundation. Unable to unleash his spell, Fu Daimu began showing signs of despair and madness.

Li Yuanjiao watched Fu Daimu's expression change repeatedly as if he were fighting for his life. He stood back in the air, secretly praying that this Old Mount Yue man would not break the formation as he could not afford to pay for it.

Fortunately, Kong Tingyun's formation plate was exceptionally durable, being a jade heirloom that could maintain a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm defense in any environment. In this battle, he lost only five or six Spirit Stones and more than a dozen jade stones. Li Yuanjiao was very delighted and yearned to possess this formation plate.

I wonder how many Spirit Stones this formation plate costs... If it's accidentally destroyed, I might really have to empty our family's vault.

While Li Yuanjiao was preoccupied with his thoughts, Fu Daimu had enveloped himself in a blood mist while fighting desperately.

Li Yuanjiao withdrew and continued waiting amongst the spirit mist. He did not have to wait long before a gust of blood wind swept past him.

The old Mount Yue man's head had been crushed into pieces.

"Brother Jiao, are you all right?"

Although Yuan Chengdun had depleted a significant amount of true essence in this battle, he still managed to fly toward Li Yuanjiao out of concern. Li Yuanjiao nodded and thanked him, then put away the formation plate.

As soon as the large formation was undone, they saw white insects filling the surrounding mountains, densely swarming with nowhere to land.

Fei Luoya nodded with a satisfied smile and remarked, "They are definitely dead! This is the phenomenon of Descending Souls."

Li Yuanjiao drew his sword and declared, "Now that the evil has been eliminated, I'll stay here to defend this place for a while. Great Jueting still has remnants‚Äîgo and quickly eliminate them. If anyone hears of this, they'll definitely retaliate."

Fei Luoya nodded and threw Fu Daimu's storage pouch toward Li Yuanjiao, who took it with a nod and said simply, "We'll divide the spoils after we're done."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Great Jueting was an ancient, majestic city, once filled with a population of a hundred thousand at its peak. Fu Daimu had only ruled it for decades, but now fewer than ten thousand remained, mostly women dedicated to childbearing.

The fertile soil and abundant water of Jiangnan nurtured the land effectively‚Äîseeds scattered today would germinate tomorrow, and an acre of land could easily support a family. People settled down here, cultivating crop after crop. Fu Daimu had been cultivating here for decades, reaping significant benefits.

The boulder was polished smooth and flat with a few Mount Yue soldiers scattered atop it, standing in silence. A group of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators flew past, and all the mortals kneeled and bowed in submission.

In Great Jueting's royal court, only a few hundred large copper pillars stood tall. On top of them were sporadically tied individuals, most reduced to desiccated corpses, with a small number of them still breathing.

All of them were Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators.

Li Yuanjiao and the others swiftly entered the hall, breaking the formation and searching for several secret chambers. One by one, they opened each chamber until they found Fu Daimu's Dao Companion in the deepest part of the palace. To their surprise, it was an old woman who was sitting cross-legged. Fei Luoya marched into the room and twisted her head off.

Fu Daimu was highly attentive; the indoor shielding formation was exquisitely crafted, so much so that when the group arrived, the woman remained unaware of their presence. She had a smile on her face, likely because her cultivation had reached a critical point.

In front of her lay a collection of evil, bloody objects. Li Yuanjiao glanced over them, knowing that all of them were gathered by Zhu Xian.

The group dispersed to search further. Fu Daimu had not established a Dao lineage; instead, he kept all his shamanic spells and secret techniques memorized in his mind, much to Fei Luoya's dismay. They only found a few spells in Zhe Ledai's secret chamber, which was better than nothing.

They opened the storage pouches of the Mount Yue men, spilling spirit items across the ground. Most of the items were common, but among them were five treasured panaceas and five glittering jade boxes that would make anyone's eyes gleam with greed.

The group of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators returned to gather together. They first exchanged a few small secret arts and recorded them down, then laid out what they had obtained.

All their gazes were then drawn toward the Mountain of Human Heads, which after suffering considerable damage, had shrunk to the size of a human skull. The smaller human heads on it were densely packed, looking extremely terrifying.

Although Fu Daimu was not particularly skilled at refining weapons, his cultivation was built on this dharma weapon, sacrificing around eighty to a hundred thousand human lives which could threaten Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

Even in the face of Sprawling Azure Mountain, it managed to hold out for the time it took for a stick of incense to burn... What a powerful weapon...

"This object should no longer be used. I will take it back to the clan to refashion it," Yuan Chengdun remarked casually as he picked up the item.

Having dealt the most damage during the siege, Yuan Chengdun naturally had the right to make the first pick.

Fei Luoya merely cupped his fist and said, "Brother Jiao, please go ahead!"

Li Yuanjiao accepted the invitation. He swept his eyes over the items, then said, "Let's take out a few types of treasured panaceas first. These are needed to establish connections with those on Fuchen Peak in the sect. If the Peak Master needs treasured panaceas in the future, I'll have to trouble you two, fellow Daoists."

"Of course."

Zhu Xian and Fei Luoya nodded in agreement, while Yuan Chengdun seemed thoughtful.

Li Yuanjiao collected three treasured panaceas, after making it clear that these were for building connections. He then took a Clear Cloud Elk Fruit, which could be used to solidify true essence and regenerate severed limbs.

Watching Li Yuanjiao take the fruit, Li Wushao finally breathed a silent sigh of relief. Since he would be the last to pick the spoils, he knew he would not be able to secure any treasured panacea.

As long as this panacea is in the master's hands, there's still hope of obtaining it... maybe I won't need to spend decades repairing my tail hooks... he thought quietly to himself.

Fei Luoya took the last treasured panacea, the Wall Mountain Essence Flower, which could assist in cultivation and increase mana. The remaining miscellaneous items were split equally between Li Wushao and Zhu Xian. Although their value was not high, at least they did not return empty-handed.

Yuan Chengdun had managed to obtain a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, and Fei Luoya's territory had doubled, leaving them in high spirits.
