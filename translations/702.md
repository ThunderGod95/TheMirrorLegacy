# Chapter 702: The Spoils of Ascension

On the Heavenly Glow Dawn Cloudliner, Li Yuanqin stood at the rail, watching the dark night wind stream past the vessel’s radiant light. His mother, Ning Hemian, stood beside him. After a long silence, she was the first to speak.

“The Southern Borderlands are stable now. It might be a good life for you, to stay on the lake.”

“It would be difficult,” Li Yuanqin said, shaking his head. “Li Zhouwei is a genius, and Li Chenghui is a hero of his generation. I have neither the strength nor the close family ties to compete. Daoist Master Zhaojing has reached the Purple Mansion Realm, and even if he were willing to acknowledge an elder so much younger than himself, the powers within the clan would never respect me.”

He let out a sigh. “To have a high-ranking elder appear out of nowhere… no one would accept it. I’d be inviting scorn upon myself and would likely be shuffled into some sinecure to keep me out of the way. Once that happened, leaving would become difficult, and I would have offended a great many people in the process. As it stands, my position in the sect is promising. I have the freedom to advance or retreat. Isn’t that far better than staying with the Li clan?”

Ning Hemian knew he spoke the truth. “Li Xuanxuan was sincere, though,” she said with a sigh. “He looks upon you as his own grandson.”

“He was,” Li Yuanqin agreed. “Great Uncle was very warm to me. But he’s only a Qi Refinement cultivator. An old man’s heart is soft, and his words carry little weight. Once I was truly back in the clan, he would be powerless to support me.”

He leaned against the stern, gazing at the bright moon. “The Li clan appears harmonious, but no clan or sect in this world is without its conflicts. Their peace is a result of strict governance, powerful elders still in their prime, and a clear hierarchy of strength from one generation to the next.”

His voice became quiet and thoughtful. “Dark days are coming for the Li clan. It was the clan my father dedicated his life to, so I will help where I can.”

Ning Hemian nodded, then changed the subject. “White Lightning has been delivered to the Southern Borderlands. Should it be returned?”

Li Yuanqin paused for a moment before shaking his head. “No need. In the entire Azure Pond Sect, there isn’t a single person worthy of that bow. Si Yuanli tried to draw it himself and his hand was split open. Let it remain with the sect. If a worthy talent ever emerges in the Li clan, they can come and claim it.”

After descending from Gardenia Scenery Mountain, Li Zhouwei saw Chen Yang waiting at the foot of the slope.

“Go and ask the other Daoists to return to the island,” he instructed. “There are important matters to discuss.”

Chen Yang acknowledged the order and sped away. Li Zhouwei flew on a beam of light into the main hall, just as An Siwei was hurrying up the steps to meet him.

“Clan Head,” An Siwei said respectfully, “Tian Zhongqing went into seclusion a few days ago. He’s attempting to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.”

Li Zhouwei was slightly surprised. “He has courage,” he nodded.

Tian Zhongqing was an old retainer, having once served under Li Yuanxiu, Li Xuanxuan’s eldest son. He was now one hundred and five years old. He had spent the better part of his life as a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator and was one of the few non-family members to have returned from Jiangbei.

His chances of success were pitifully low, but if the old man wanted to make one last attempt, Li Zhouwei would not stand in his way. He calculated the time and asked, “It’s been seven years since Li Wen went into seclusion, has it not?”

An Siwei nodded.

The minor branches of the Li clan were not descended from the four main lines and their members generally had less talent. Li Wen was the foremost among them, yet he still hadn’t been able to attempt his breakthrough by the age of sixty. He had taken an Essence Gathering Pill, so his chances were far greater than Tian Zhongqing’s.

‘Seven years is a little long… He must be in danger,’ Li Zhouwei thought with a measure of regret, remembering the loyal, stout man who used to stand guard at the hall entrance with two golden hammers. ‘He cultivated the *Aged Courtly Path Sutra* and secluded himself in the spirit jade mine. With the prevalence of jade in the world, he should have had a high chance of success…’

As he was lost in thought, several figures descended into the hall. Li Minggong, in her red dress, and Li Chenghui, in his silver armor and black robes, had arrived. Li Zhouwei walked to the main table and picked up a stone box, opening it gently.

Inside rested a small, six-pointed brazier. It was the color of brass and etched with bright red patterns of True Fire. Li Zhouwei passed it to Li Minggong with a smile.

“Aunt, this is the Six-Pointed Crimson Flame Brazier, a gift from the Golden Feather Sect. It’s a fine Foundation Establishment Dharma Artifact. You should take it.”

Li Minggong thanked him profusely, accepting it with delight. The gifts from the two major sects reflected their status. While the Essence Gathering Pill recipe from the Azure Pond Sect was valuable, it felt opportunistic. The brazier was a truly practical gift.

The remaining gifts were from the seven gates. Excluding the Snow Wings and Changxiao Gates, there were five items in total. Li Zhouwei picked up a jade vial from the Hengzhu Immortal Dao and handed it to Li Minggong.

“These gates were all very thoughtful. This is Pure Feather Li-Fire. Though not a True Fire, it is a Luan-Fire, which is highly compatible with your Pheasant Li March technique. Please, take this as well.”

Li Minggong was now a little embarrassed, but seeing his insistent frown, she accepted it. Next, Li Zhouwei took out an elongated jade box from the Sword Gate. Inside was a Foundation Establishment spirit sword named *Darksea Serpent*.

“In our clan, only Uncle Chenghuai uses a sword… and he’s still in seclusion…” Li Zhouwei could only put it aside for now. Li Ximing had already claimed the *Tome of Adamant Flame Alchemy* from the Purple Smoke Gate. That left the gifts from the Profound Peak Gate: the Earthen Aegis and the Earth-Treading Boots.

Since the Profound Peak Gate was asking for aid, their gifts were far more generous. Li Zhouwei presented the two Dharma Artifacts. The Earthen Aegis was a shield of coalesced rock, carved with the pattern of a spirit tortoise. The Earth-Treading Boots were ornately embroidered with patterns of heavenly glows, yet they were undeniably Earth Virtue artifacts.

“Rampant lightning is extinguished by earth… Chenghui can’t use either of these.”

Li Zhouwei took the Earth-Treading Boots and gave them to An Siwei. The middle-aged man stared in shock, clearly not expecting to receive a Dharma Artifact. Li Zhouwei stopped him before he could speak his thanks.

“These boots can restore your spiritual qi when you stand on the ground and will also increase your speed. Refine them later. For now, go to the riverbank at once and deliver the Earthen Aegis to the White Ape. It’s a perfect fit for him.”

An Siwei nodded eagerly and hurried out, his steps light with excitement. Li Zhouwei then picked up the gift from the Xiukui Monastery—a talisman covered in intricate patterns.

“This is a Mountain Ghost Talisman,” Li Zhouwei explained with a smile. “It can summon a being with the strength of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. For us, every use would deplete its power, which is a waste. I’ll set it aside for Que'wan. She might be able to learn something from it.”

Li Chenghui, who had been examining it, knew that for him, it wasn’t a matter of depleting its power—he couldn’t use it at all. He just shook his head with a wry smile.

After setting aside the gifts from the three sects and seven gates, Li Zhouwei picked up the *Art of Wondrous Transformations* from the Slaughter Jun Gate. It detailed a method of consuming Radiant Fire and Baleful Earth to cultivate a breath of Earth Fire baleful qi that could force hidden enemies to reveal themselves.

“Daoist Master Junjian achieved his Divine Ability through such arts. The Slaughter Jun Gate is famous for refining baleful qi from both Earth Fire and Cold Earth.” Li Zhouwei hesitated for a second. Li Chenghui couldn’t cultivate this either, so he could only pass it to Li Minggong for her to study.

Now, only a single jade box remained on the table. Li Zhouwei opened it to reveal a pair of dark gold, perfectly round circlets. They were no thicker than a thumb and about the size of a palm, radiating a cold, metallic aura.

“The White Shadow Golden Clasps from the Chengyun Gate…”

Li Zhouwei felt a sense of helplessness. He glanced at Li Chenghui, hesitating.

Li Minggong stifled a laugh. “What a coincidence.”

The dashing young man in silver armor and black robes looked equally awkward. He was good-natured about it, however, and simply smiled. “My remnant lightning is grounded by Dui-Metal. It’s fine on a normal day, but if I were injured, the cold metallic energy of my own weapon would turn against me.”
