# Chapter 411: Engraved Stone

"Fine," Li Yuanjiao said as he smiled and nodded, then stepped to the side.

Li Qinghong had been cultivating in seclusion for a long time. This was an opportunity for her to stretch and loosen her muscles.

Her face broke into a grin as she advanced, drawing her weapon. With practiced grace, she spun the spear that was radiating with a purple glow. Although she had fought many battles in the lake, she did not immediately unleash her thunder. Instead, she slowly approached the catfish demon.

Thunder technique worked differently compared to sword qi, which was the sharp qi derived from the metal element. Sword qi harmonized well with water, so it could work well under water.

On the other hand, thunder techniques were characterized by attributes of thunder and fire, as well as the dynamic balance of yin and yang, where the yang manifested as lightning. Naturally, it was less effective when released in water compared to on land. Yet, it was still formidable enough for Li Qinghong to deal with a minor demon.

Li Qinghong activated the River Crossing Torrential Step, then lunged, targeting the demon's underbelly with her spear.

The White Iris Spear was deadly, so she would not use it to deal with a mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm demon. The dharma weapon in her hand was instead a low-grade Qi Cultivation Realm spear.

Poof!

Li Yuanjiao had barely registered a tingling sensation on his face when a bright light suddenly flashed, followed by the muffled sounds of an explosion. Water churned into froth and mud.

The catfish demon, caught off-guard, winced and recoiled. The spell it had been gathering in its mouth dispersed as it staggered backward, its whiskers stretched taut, emitting a piercing screech.

Li Qinghong pressed on now that she had gained her advantage. Her spear movements were swift and precise, killing the fish and prawns in the water and causing them to surface. The catfish demon, clearly outmatched, turned in panic and fled.

Li Yuanjiao, observing the scene before him, could not help but express his admiration.

"Thunder techniques are truly impressive! It's rare in Jiangnan... If it didn't shorten lifespans and harm the body, it would have been the most formidable offensive technique in our family," he remarked.

If their family had not acquired the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual recently, nothing could truly rival this Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique. Though the former was a Grade Four technique, brilliant and powerful as the sun, it might still fall short of the intimidating power of the thunder technique, which could overwhelm both the enemy and the wielder alike.

With that in mind, Li Yuanjiao recalled something else.

Xicheng has made remarkable strides in the past few years... He celebrated his twenty-sixth birthday just a few days ago with a breakthrough to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Meanwhile, Uncle Donghe hasn't returned from the western desert...

Chen Donghe was expected to return in a year or two and likely be around when Li Xicheng entered the Qi Cultivation Realm. However, Ximing who was studying alchemy with the Xiao Family, and Xijun who was training on Meiche Peak showed remarkable talent. They were already close to reaching Li Xicheng's level.

Ximing and Xijun have already reached the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm at just fourteen and fifteen... It seems likely they'll advance to the Qi Cultivation Realm within the next five to seven years. If the Golden Yang Radiant Origin is bestowed upon Xicheng, then at least one of them won't be able to receive this spiritual qi in time for their breakthrough.

With the devil plague rampant across the land and communication from the west sporadic, gathering a portion of the Golden Yang Radiant Origin spiritual qi within the next seven years posed a significant challenge to them.

I better discuss this with Xicheng once I return!

By the time he regained his composure, Li Qinghong was already returning, dragging along a large catfish behind her. The fish's body, marked with patches of black and white, was now rigid, with its cultivation sealed. Foam bubbled from its gaping mouth.

This demonic creature, struck by lightning and slightly charred, had regurgitated all sorts of things—bits of fish, ducks, crabs, snakes, along with some fabric and driftwood... It also seemed like some of the fishermen on the lake had fallen prey to it before.

"Hm."

Li Yuanjiao cast a glance at it before performing a hand seal to deactivate the isolating barrier. The formation plate on the ground slowly floated up, settling gently onto his hand.

"This Muddy Water Talisman Flowing Formation is quite useful and extremely isolating... As long as the formation plate is guarded, it can reliably trap enemies," Li Qinghong commented thoughtfully.

Li Yuanjiao put the plate away, then remarked, "It's a solid water-based formation, though regrettably only available for rent. Purchasing it would set us back over a hundred Spirit Stones."

Li Qinghong was in a good mood, conversing with her brother as she channeled mana to her hands to lift the catfish demon that was the size of a small hut. The two of them then flew side by side back to the mountain.

Meanwhile, Li Yuanping had already finished preparing for the ceremony. Dressed in a Daoist robe, he waited with the old monkey who was also dressed in a Daoist robe and a pair of clogs. Standing beside them was Li Ximing, who seemed to have just returned not long ago and was ready to join the family rituals.

Upon seeing his elder siblings return with the demonic beast, Li Yuanping praised them and produced a wooden box from his sleeve joyfully.

"Big Brother! The Wanglin Blossom has bloomed!" he exclaimed in excitement.

He opened the wooden box to reveal three slightly reddish spirit flowers, each delicate and soft, about the size of a palm, with slender stamens and five bicolored petals—red on top and white beneath.

As soon as the wooden box was opened, everyone, including Li Yuanping himself, smiled at the sight of it. Li Yuanping explained, "This flower makes the heart light and joyful. Whether mortal or cultivator, unless they've formed their Immortal Foundation, they can't help but show a true smile."

The wooden box had just been opened, but Li Yuanping and everyone else laughed muffledly, with the corners of their mouths upturned.

"The owner of this flower is happy, smiles when he sees it, and is very gentle... No matter whether he is a mortal or a monk, as long as he had not become an immortal, he must smile honestly." Li Yuanping finished with a warm, genuine smile.

After admiring the flowers for a moment, Li Yuanjiao instructed, "Give two of these to Ximing and have him deliver them to Ancestor Yuansi as a modest gift, a token of our gratitude for his long-standing support."

After giving the instructions, Li Yuanjiao rewarded the old monkey with some cultivation resources which the monkey accepted with a grateful nod.

Li Ximing then came forward.

"Thank you, Second Uncle!"

Li Ximing was gentle and respectful. Having trained with the Xiao Family for two years, Master Xiao Yuansi had taught him everything he knew. Li Ximing had studied numerous medicinal texts and had become proficient in gathering and identifying herbs, reflecting some of Master Xiao's refined demeanor.

He had grown taller and his features had become more distinct, bearing a strong resemblance to Li Yuanping, though less delicate in appearance and not as handsome. However, his temperament compensated for his plain looks.

The aura at Xianyou Peak was rich, and his cultivation had been progressing well. He was not far behind Li Xijun, who was also focused on advancing his cultivation. Li Yuanjiao noticed a hint of concern in his eyebrows and said, "If there are any difficulties, feel free to speak up."

Li Ximing hesitated for a moment before gesturing to a few medicine pouches on his waist and replied, "Master Xiao gifted me an old set of medicine pouches to store spirit items. I accepted it in the end, so I fear our family is further indebted to him..."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in understanding. The family had already stretched its resources thin by giving Li Qingxiao seventy Spirit Stones.

"Our family currently lacks additional resources; we only have a few dharma artifacts left in our treasury. Does Senior Yuansi have any children? What is their level of cultivation?" Li Yuanjiao asked.

With a look of guilt, Li Ximing answered, "The ancestor's children were not strong in their cultivation and died in a conflict. There's a descendant in their family named Xiao Guixiang who comes from a well-off family that doesn't lack dharma weapons nor elixirs."

Li Yuanjiao sighed and gritted his teeth in frustration, mentally noting this information.

We shouldn't delay this any longer... If there's little chance of resolving this, it might be best to offer the alchemy legacy from our family.

He waved dismissively and said, "Now that you're back, let's prepare for the ritual."

Yi Mountain City was constructed around Mount Lingqiu, a once majestic and renowned peak. It used to blaze with flames in ancient times and produced a type of golden spirit ore mined extensively by an immortal sect known as the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion. As a result of this, the earth veins became thinner, and the mountain eventually stopped burning.

At the highest cave dwelling atop the mountain, shrouded in clouds and swirling green fog, Daoist Master Yuan Su stood, playing with a light golden jade seal. He gazed down at the grand city below him.

"Buzi must have lost his mind... He wanders Wu and Yue States day and night, refusing to return to the sect. Thankfully, the devil plague is progressing well..." he murmured.

Daoist Master Yuan Su hailed from the same era as Chi Wei. Unfortunately, he practiced a cultivation method that prematurely ended his progress, confining him to the early stages of the Purple Mansion Realm. If not for the fact that it was a life divine ability, Yuan Su might have lost all standing.

Disillusioned, especially with people like Si Boxiu, he decided to choose a quieter life, hence retreating to the southern border.

"Hm?"

Yuan Su paused, sensing the surge of golden aura at the foot of the mountain.

"Someone's establishing a Dao foundation... it's the Engraved Stone..." he mumbled to himself.

He calculated silently; the one from Golden Tang Gate had not moved in ages but he still lived. If memory served, his divine ability was incomplete.

"Situ Huo practices the Engraved Stone, but that fool isn't skilled in alchemy and hasn't established his Dao Foundation... He's probably not destined for it."

Yuan Su chuckled to himself before picking up a jade token from the desk, muttering to himself, "Li Xuanfeng... another from the Li Family?"

The image of a certain young man flashed through his mind. As the jade token spun in his hand, Yuan Su mused, "I owe something to the Li Family... but who knows what that man thinks? Maybe Xiao Chuting has already beaten me to it. He probably detests the Chi Family and myself as well."

His other hand rose slowly, capturing a wisp of colorful light in the void. Unleashing his divine ability, he connected it across the heavens to Li Xuanfeng.

Yuan Su calculated carefully again with his divine ability.

It seems respect and fear prevail... Xiao Chuting doesn't dare make a move. Perhaps the Li Family only resents Chi Wei...

Back then, no outsiders knew who took Li Chejing away. When Yuan Su was forced to carry out this task, he was cautious enough to veil his face.

In terms of prudence, only Xiao Chuting can match me, he thought smugly.

Since the Li Family bore no malice toward him, Yuan Su decided to let the matter rest. With a flick of his fingers, he sent the jade token soaring like a shooting star, landing before a specific cave dwelling at the mountain's base.

"Damn it," Daoist Master Yuan Su cursed as he reattached the jade seal to his waist.

He settled back on the rock and muttered, "With Chi Wei dead, Yi Mountain City is mine... Who cares what the Chi Family thinks!"

————

In a brightly lit cave dwelling, a middle-aged man sat cross-legged beside a spirit spring, slowly exhaling.

His features were sharp, and he bore the visage of someone both brave and ruthless. Yet, a lingering sadness softened the harsh lines between his brows, tempering the fiery intensity within him that otherwise defined his presence.

Behind him stood his golden longbow, radiating an extraordinary aura.

He was none other than Li Xuanfeng.

"After more than fifty years of arduous cultivation, I've finally achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm!" he declared proudly, releasing a long breath and opening his eyes slowly. A golden fire danced within their depths. His eyes brightened momentarily before fading back to their natural hue.

As soon as Li Xuanfeng achieved his breakthrough, a few rays of light appeared behind him, and the name of Daoist Master Yuan Su surfaced in his thoughts. The Profound Pearl Talisman Seed within him stirred violently, emitting a white light that briefly clouded his vision before clarity returned.

However, this memory swiftly vanished, leaving Li Xuanfeng unaware of the internal struggle between the two forces within his mind.

My Immortal Foundation... The Engraved Stone!

This immortal foundation was established with cultivation techniques from the Golden Tang Gate. Its Qi was capable of breaking formations, cleaving mountains, and destroying enemies' dharma artifacts. Specializing in precision attacks, it becomes increasingly powerful with each enemy defeated, tempered by their blood qi.

Once formed, this Immortal Foundation could detect gold in earth veins, consume gold and jade for healing, ward off baleful qi, and render the body as impervious as metal and stone. With just a wave of his hand, he could wield sharp qi, making it difficult for spells and curses to harm him.

"It's an excellent tool for battle and breaking through formations," Li Xuanfeng mused as he rose to his feet. The Golden Age Longbow behind him vibrated and leaped into his hand instantly. He ran his fingers over the bowstring, only to notice that the cave wall was filled with brown and golden ores that seemed like spirit items.

"This is the phenomenon that accompanies the establishment of my foundation..." he mumbled quietly in awe.

The cave dwelling was brimming with baleful qi and astral qi. Thankfully, the grand formation of the Azure Pond Sect prevented the cave walls from being ravaged by the corrosive forces.

With a wave of his hand, Li Xuanfeng cleared the turbulent qi in the cave dwelling. Pushing open the door, he stepped out into the night. The stars and moon were shining brightly above in the sky.

The two Daoist children stationed keeping watch at the cave entrance exchanged surprised glances with each other, clearly not expecting that Li Xuanfeng—a mere clan cultivator—would succeed in establishing his foundation.

They quickly kneeled before him.

"Greetings, Old Ancestor! Congratulations on establishing your immortal foundation and ascending to immortality once again!"

Li Xuanfeng nodded and took a step forward, only to pause and look up as a fluorescent light streaked across the night sky.

Wrapped in a white glow and trailing a colorful tail three chi long, it slowly descended before him. Stunned, Li Xuanfeng watched as the light dimmed, transforming into a diamond-shaped jade pendant that landed at his feet.

Before he could speak, a tall figure appeared beside him, clad in the all-green attire and jade boots typical of an Azure Pond Sect disciple. Each item he wore glowed with the light of mana.

The Azure Pond Sect disciple slowly bowed, then sank to his knees gracefully and announced, "Hejing bears the imperial decree of the Daoist Master!"

After rising from his bow, an awkward smile spread across his face as he continued, "Please accept the decree, fellow Daoist!"

It must be Daoist Master Yuan Su...

Li Xuanfeng observed the man's reaction and understood that this was indeed an order from the esteemed Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master.

That's quick!

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly before accepting the decree with a smile. "Where is the Upper Sect sending this humble servant to?" he asked.

"You have humor, fellow Daoist. I am Ning Hejing, Peak Master of Yuanxing Peak, stationed in Yi Mountain City."

The smile on the man's face was stiff. Li Xuanfeng took a closer look at him before realization dawned upon him as well.

So, it's him!

This person was Senior Brother Ning who led a group of Yuanwu Peak disciples back then. He was tall and quite outstanding. He had kicked Deng Yuzhi over and let him shoot the fleeing cultivator with an arrow.

"Daoist Master Yuan Su has personally appointed you as a general, entrusting you with a significant responsibility," Ning Hejing quickly regained his composure and spoke with forced cheerfulness.

"This appointment is part of your entry into Yi Mountain City's cultivation registry. You'll receive immortal stipends and can also accumulate merits to request spirit items from the sect. From now on, you and I are colleagues," he explained.

Ning Hejing's eyelids twitched as incredulity flickered in his heart. He scanned Li Xuanfeng's face, pondering how this man, seemingly without notable background or talent—save for his archery skills, had been chosen for promotion.

How could Daoist Master Yuan Su personally promote a Foundation Establishment Realm clan cultivator when there are dozens of other cultivators of the same realm within the sect in this city? Is it out of admiration... or does he have other motives?

Li Xuanfeng raised his eyebrows, clearly pleased as he responded, "Thank you to the Daoist Master."

He did not dwell much on his situation. Since his arrival in Yi Mountain City, he had been resigned to a fate of death over dishonor, simply seeking to enhance his cultivation and extend his life a few more years. Now realizing he could still provide for his family in his remaining years, a thought struck him as he said with a smile, "How can I call myself your colleague? If the Peak Master has any requests, I am yours to command."

Ning Hejing studied Li Xuanfeng for a moment, clearly taken aback by his humble words despite his formidable prowess with the bow. Feeling somewhat reassured now, he replied warmly, "You are too polite, fellow Daoist. After all, you were personally promoted by Daoist Master Yuan Su... There's no need for formalities with Hejing. If you have any requests, just let me know."

Li Xuanfeng, though not particularly shrewd, had the wisdom of fifty years of experience. Since his family had no connections to Daoist Master Yuan Su, and suspecting that his promotion was more about Yuan Su's interests than his own merit, he said tactfully, "There's no need to trouble the Peak Master. I only wish to inquire about my duties."

"Nothing more than to help maintain order. The southern border is currently in chaos, and I have no interest in engaging in any cunning games."

Ning Hejing laughed, his demeanor turning eager as he warmly suggested, "Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng, why don't you come with me to meet all your colleagues?"
