# Chapter 912: Illuminating Sun and Moon

"Not at all! Not at all!"

The two men glanced at each other and quickly bowed. Wang Long was the first to speak.

"Fellow Daoist, what words are these? When you were born... the clouds swirled, vast as a carriage canopy, the ground was covered in White Cicadas, and a qilin carried a child. We all received our orders."

"Judge Yang dispatched us to the corresponding location in the Underworld. One of us blew the conch, the other fanned the winds. Then we ascended from the World's Navel and struck the Morning Mist Bell for three quarters. It was all done according to ancient customs to congratulate you. We have long anticipated this day; a little waiting is nothing."

Li Zhouwei naturally knew his birth had never been a secret. Perhaps some Purple Mansion Realm cultivator on a distant coast or deep in the north was unaware, but the players at the zenith were playing chess, their hands enclosing the four seas. How could they not see the board? They knew everything, clear as day. He took the opportunity to ask:

"You have truly gone to too much trouble. The world is so vast; in this age, countless people are born with such auspicious signs. You praise me too highly."

"You are mistaken," Wang Long replied, shaking his head.

"Fellow Daoist, yours is not just any destiny. Your status is exalted, a descendant of a Golden Core. To have such a noble origin to match this destiny makes it even more so. There are other talents in this world who also possess destiny. But once they break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, their Life Divine Ability is cultivated to its end. What they were born with, others have also managed to cultivate. Even if it retains some uniqueness, it's hard to say it's truly superior to other Divine Abilities."

"From what I've heard of the world's affairs, setting aside reincarnated beings and those with innate talent for the Way of the Sword, and speaking only of destiny and bloodline... apart from that one from the Touba family, anyone else who could compare to Your Excellency has only just been born."

"Moreover..."

He hesitated slightly, as if debating whether to continue. After a second look, he finally said:

"I see you understand your own status. You can, under the gaze of all, determine the fate of those with great destinies and powerful Divine Abilities. Who, then, could say *your* destiny is not great? Is that not, in itself, a Divine Ability? Naturally, it will give rise to all sorts of wonders. And now, such a domineering Fruition Attainment as Bright Yang no longer favors just one person. An exception like you, Fellow Daoist... isn't that worthy of being called a destiny of the highest order?"

Li Zhouwei's affairs were a game played in the heavens. Whatever the Dragon-kin knew, the Underworld knew just as much. The two envoys before him maintained a respectful attitude. Zhang Gui spoke up in his gruff voice:

"Fellow Daoist, your destiny is aligned with Bright Yang, and your blood flows from the Wei Emperor. In ancient times, you would have been called nothing less than a Dao Body."

He was not a man of many words and fell silent. His partner immediately picked up the thread.

"In the old Wei kingdom, the Dao Bodies all had different, very long names. That Martial Emperor was called the [Divine Light Emperor Body, Hailed by the Ten Directions]... Ha ha... Well, he was the emperor of a celestial dynasty, after all. They always cared for such things."

Li Zhouwei fell into thought. The two Underworld envoys seemed pressed for time. Wang Long nodded, immediately getting to the point and clasping his hands.

"Although we are long familiar with your great name, the formalities must be observed..."

He straightened his posture, his voice taking on a formal, imposing tone.
"What is your name?"

Li Zhouwei inclined his head.

"Li Zhouwei, disciple of the Li clan. The 'Zhou' for 'revolution,' the 'Wei' for 'eminence.'"

As his voice fell, ink materialized on the large brush in Wang Long's hand. Beside him, Zhang Gui asked, "Are you still going to look?"

The man's pinkish lips pursed as he began flipping through the thick tome in his hands. But Wang Long hurried him.

"What is there to look for? Just write it down!"

Clearly, it wasn't just Li Ximing; Li Zhouwei's name was also unlikely to be found in their records. Wang Long had served in the Underworld's mortal affairs for so many years; how could he not understand this? He scoffed internally.

'It's no wonder he's been an envoy longer than me. How can someone so unobservant ever hope to be promoted? Li Ximing's name was already missingâ€”who knows whose handiwork that was. Li Zhouwei is obviously even more important, a pivotal piece in this grand upheaval of the world. It would be stranger if his name *was* in there!'

The two bustled for a moment and finished writing. Seeing this, Li Zhouwei reached into the storage bag at his waist, produced a jade box, and offered it. But Wang Long just laughed.

"We couldn't possibly! We couldn't!"

He would accept ordinary gifts, but not from this man. He pushed the jade box back, his smile still tinged with awkwardness.

"We have no need for your things, Fellow Daoist! If not for the rules, *we* should be the ones giving *you* gifts. We cannot speak on the affairs of the great figures... but in the future, when you have the chance to strike for the Golden Core realm, if it doesn't interfere with important matters... perhaps you could choose your territory... and we would be honored if you considered leaning toward our humble jurisdiction..."

'So that's it,' Li Zhouwei understood. 'They're after the Metallic Essence.'

He gave a slight nod. Wang Long waved his hands again, earnestly deflecting any sense of demand.

"You mustn't delay the business of those above! If it's inconvenient, it's no matter. We will surely have many chances to meet in the future. But... just to be allowed to witness your Divine Ability, to see Your Excellency's great achievement... that would be the best!"

At the mention of this, even the slow-witted Zhang Gui showed an eager, fawning smile. He set his large book down and said respectfully:

"This matter is highly negotiable... We just fear we are being too forward."

"We have some business to attend to in the north, so we won't impose any longer."

The two exchanged a few more pleasantries, then dissolved into two gusts of yin wind and vanished.

'It seems the Underworld's methods... are just as formidable.'

'Yang Tianya achieved his Divine Ability even before Houfu. To this day, no one knows his cultivation level. He remains hidden in the shadows... The north and south are torn apart by war, yet the entire Yang family appears completely harmless. He hasn't made a single move.'

Compared to that northern power's faint, domineering presence and their top-down, shadowy control over the entire world's situation, the Underworld's methods were more subtle, seeping in like water. If the Li family hadn't been informed about Yang Tianya early on, they would still believe the Yangs were just a group of washed-up royals trapped on their mountain.

'But thinking about it, the key link between the Yang and Li families is the marriage with Li Xizhi. Could this be seen as the Yangs placing a bet on the Li family long ago? What about other places? What other arrangements has Yang Tianya made?'

'And as a mixed-blood of the Yang and Li families... what role is Zhouluo's branch playing... under the governance of Azure Pond...'

Li Zhouwei waited a while longer, then shook his head, pushing the thoughts from his mind. Confirming the two were truly gone, his form instantly dissolved into light. There was no time to pay visits. He stepped across the Great Void and descended toward the lake.

He flew into the grand formation, weaving between the towering profound pillars, and landed in the main hall of the inner array. There, he saw a pagoda standing alone in the dimly lit hall.

It was the *Roaming Rampart Lapis Pagoda*.

He took a single step and appeared at the pagoda's apex. He sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and recited the incantation inwardly:

'Li Zhouwei, disciple of the Li clan, ascending to walk the path of Divine Ability, perfecting all virtue... I pray to ascend to the heavenly mandate, to be inscribed upon the Profound Register... to open the Profound Brightness, and continue my Daoist works!'

*Dong!*

A slight sensation of weightlessness washed over him. He felt the white pellet in his Shengyang Mansion tremble as his form seemed to shrink infinitely. A world of ethereal mist and clouds suddenly appeared before him, and an intense coolness spread from the back of his head.

His vision brightened. He was in a pavilion.

Gray stone and white jade, bathed in clear, bright lamplight. Li Zhouwei raised his head slightly. Reflected in his pupils was the scene outside the window: the sun and moon sharing the sky. A wave of rich Spiritual Qi rushed to meet him, shaking him to the core.

'What dense spiritual inspiration... What a perfectly balanced spiritual atmosphere!'

'This is... the World Within the Mirror!'

Only now did Li Ximing's meaningful expression from before make sense. Joy surged in his heart, followed by dawning comprehension.

"No wonder His Excellency could engage in constant battles while still cultivating his Divine Abilities at such a divine speed... With this world in hand, what fear is there of slow cultivation!"

Li Zhouwei scanned the room, deeply satisfied, and let out a quiet sigh of relief.

'All those hazardous items back home... I can move them all in here...'

He looked up. On a desk sat a small jade vial. In the center of the pavilion hung a painting of a white sparrow in soaring flight. Li Zhouwei didn't even need to use his spiritual sense; a single glance with his golden eyes told him it was a cultivation art.

He strode forward, his golden eyes flashing, and took the vial in his hand.

The jade vial had a long neck and a pure white body. The moment Li Zhouwei held it, he saw layers of hazy, azure mist swirling within, pulsing up and down. He froze.

"A Purple Mansion's Azure Talisman?"

The instant he saw it, the Talisman Seed in his Shengyang Mansion flared violently, like the rising sun shattering the morning clouds. It ascended through the power of his Bright Yang Divine Ability, transforming into a streak of pure white light.

The azure mist, which had been sealed tightly within the bottle, seemed to receive a summons. It began to leap out, strand by strand, wisp by wisp, until it became a torrent bursting its banks. It erupted forth, creating myriad visions. The white light from his glabella met it, and all of it poured into his Shengyang Mansion!

Li Zhouwei was both shocked and overjoyed. He immediately sat cross-legged. A profound coolness filled his Shengyang Mansion. The *Audience with the Celestial Gate* within him, as if drinking sweet nectar, instantly stirred and activated.

His cultivation surged!

The bright white celestial gate within his Shengyang Mansion manifested. One by one, the white patterns covering it glowed with pristine light, rapidly growing in complexity. The seventy-two ridges on its eaves all lit up, stretching and extending further.

The azure mist surged within his Shengyang Mansion, becoming a powerful center of attraction. The radiance of the sun and moon in this world, mixed with this spiritual inspiration, poured madly into his body. Yet, this world's spiritual inspiration was perfectly balanced; it did not fluctuate by a single fraction. No matter how much he absorbed, the ambient inspiration never depleted, implying a vast, limitless supply for his taking.

As the spiritual inspiration gathered, it mixed with the azure mist, transforming into Divine Ability dharma power, which all flowed into the celestial gate. In just a quarter of an hour, *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was perfected!

An Azure Talisman was the essence of an entire Purple Mansion Realm. Even after polishing his Divine Ability to perfection, there was still a good portion of the Azure Talisman remaining.

The azure mist in his Shengyang Mansion had not stopped; it continued to surge toward the Divine Ability. But *Audience with the Celestial Gate* was full. The excess mist had nowhere to go. It could only accumulate, drifting aimlessly within the white light.

At that moment, the true form of the Talisman Seed emerged from the base of the Shengyang Mansion. The azure mist, as if summoned again, transformed into a sheet of azure light. It all converged beneath the pellet, coalescing into a long, narrow, azure talisman. It appeared somewhat dim and unsubstantial as it floated, finally coming to rest *above* the perfected *Audience with the Celestial Gate*.

Li Zhouwei's spiritual sense brushed against it. He knew instantly that with a single thought, this object could dissolve back into azure mist and dharma power, ready to elevate his cultivation once more!

'As soon as I cultivate the next Divine Ability, I can use the rest of this azure mist...'

The flash of joy was fleeting; he had no extra energy to focus on it.

His glabella shone like a star, emitting pulses of golden light. He sat like an old monk deep in meditation. His mind fell into darkness, and soon, a light grew within it. Strokes of white-gold light appeared, the two colors weaving and changing.

*Illuminating Sun and Moon*.

This Talisman Qi could sweep away demonic obstacles, secure his lineage, and establish peace. It unleashed the might of Bright Yang, gathering his destiny and binding his life-mandate to his Shengyang Mansion. In the midst of life-and-death battles, whenever he shattered a Divine Ability or defeated demonic and Buddhist foes, he would feel his life-mandate resonate. It would connect with the sun, moon, and world, causing the dharma power of his Shengyang Mansion to manifest and grant him a measure of Dao-Profundity!

'Dao-Profundity? Raising Dao-Profundity... *that* can be raised too?!'

This was completely different from Li Xizhi's *Rainbow Pierce Skyway*!

'Li Xizhi's *Rainbow Pierce Skyway* is driven by status and nobility, which causes his spell arts to grow stronger over time. While it also aids the growth of his Dao-Profundity, it doesn't *directly* increase it...'

The concept of Dao-Profundity was ancient and mysterious. It primarily represented one's personal comprehension of Divine Abilities, their Daoist tradition, and their legacies. Disciples from major sects with long cultivation histories often had higher Dao-Profundity, making them more formidable in combat.

Dao-Profundity was strongly correlated with the subtlety of one's spell arts; they enhanced one another. However, Dao-Profundity often had bottlenecks. Learning new spell arts could raise it initially, but unless one could continuously acquire more and more exquisite spell arts and spend time mastering them, it wouldn't necessarily keep rising. On the other hand, an increase in Dao-Profundity was beneficial for cultivating spell arts, channeling Divine Abilities, and even one's overall cultivation speed.

'This means that after a single bloody battle, if I defeat a sufficiently powerful enemy, my gain in Dao-Profundity might surpass years of someone else's research. And the benefits aren't limited to combat. Once my Dao-Profundity accumulates to a certain point, both *Audience with the Celestial Gate* and the *Pure Yang Bracelets* will undoubtedly bloom with a different kind of brilliance in my hands! I will gain a deeper understanding of controlling generative power, harmonizing Bright Yang, and transforming my Divine Abilities.'

'It will even be a tremendous help in striking for Fruition Attainment and achieving a Golden Core!'

And the second ability, "binding his life-mandate to his Mansion," was also immensely useful.

Li Zhouwei carried a great destiny and was known as a descendant of the Wei Emperor's bloodline. His dharma body was already superior to others. Ever since he broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, he had held a dim, intuitive understanding...

'Even though I haven't cultivated a Body Divine Ability, the current strength of my dharma body is already far greater than Li Ximing's was when he had just perfected *Audience with the Celestial Gate*. My 'white blood' can suppress evil influences, especially demonic dao dharma power. It's difficult for it to linger on my body, making it much faster to expel. But just as a more precise and complex art is harder to cultivate, if my dharma body is damaged, the difficulty of repairing it is also far greater than it is for Li Ximing.'

This Talisman Qi's ability to "gather destiny" and "bind his life-mandate to his Mansion" made his destiny more stable, harder to injure, refine, or consume. His Divine Abilities and dharma power would become more concentrated within his Shengyang Mansion. This meant he would be *less* reliant on his physical dharma body and would have more freedom in controlling it. He could mitigate damage through various transformationsâ€”even his healing speed would be a fraction faster. It effectively patched up this significant weakness.

'Looking at it this way... it's less like the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao and more like that Heavenly Embryo Dao from the north...'

This was, without a doubt, a massive enhancement to his combat prowess. Li Zhouwei had never studied the Heavenly Embryo Dao, but the *Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts* he possessed did indeed bear traces of Great Liang.

There was also the phrase "secure his lineage and establish peace, unleash the might of Bright Yang." This pointed directly to the Bright Yang essence of ruler-and-subject, father-and-sonâ€”a relationship of mutual aid and mutual contention. Its mysteries, however, were not directly related to combat or cultivation. At most, his own cultivation progress might provide a vague boost to his descendants, but the effect was not significant, and there were no other details.

The last ability, "sweep away demonic obstacles," was the Talisman Qi's most minor effect. It simply pushed the demon-breaking and evil-dispelling properties of Bright Yang to a higher level. Reflected in his Divine Ability, it meant his dharma body's resistance to the demonic dao would be stronger. While a decent boost, it seemed almost negligible compared to the profound abilities that preceded it.

As the Talisman Qi settled within him, Li Zhouwei's features became more majestic. Golden light pulsed gently from his glabella. His Shengyang Mansion felt cool and clear. An unknown amount of time passed before he slowly opened his eyes.

For a moment, light flared in the empty room. His golden pupils slowly faded from a brilliant white-gold back to their usual dark gold. His hand moved lightly to his waist, and he retrieved a jade slip.
