# Chapter 208: Enmity

Mount Yue, entrenched in the land of Wu and Yue States, boasted its own customs and had a scattered population numbering over ten million.

North of Mount Li, a vein of more than a million people found refuge under the protection of the Duanmu Kui. With the demise of Duanmu Kui, Mount Wu's disciples scattered far and wide, some fleeing while others sought refuge in various sects. The territory once controlled by Duanmu Kui was now divided among his four disciples, each imposing their authority, constructing palaces amid a scene of turmoil.

Deep within the northern vein, a monstrous beast dwelled in a deep cave amid the forest. Its mouth bristled with sharp teeth and its body was covered with yellowish scales. Its two brown eyes‚Äîeach the size of a human head, stared lifelessly into the air.

"Finally, we've slain this beast!" Xiao Chuchou sighed, feeling a sense of relief wash over him as he accepted a pill from Xiao Yuansi. Swiftly swallowing it, he felt an immediate sense of reassurance and renewed strength overwhelm his body.

He let out a soft sigh and chuckled before saying, "My lifespan is dwindling and my qi is weakening. Not only has my cultivation stagnated, I don't even move like I used to! To think how heroic I was when I traversed the north... dominating the lands of Jin and Zhao States! Now, in the blink of an eye, I've become an old man..."

Xiao Yuansi looked at the old man with concern, hesitating slightly before finally speaking.

"Old Ancestor, you... you may want to consider trying the blood sacrifice ritual passed down from the sect... It could prolong your life by a few more years and alleviate your physical discomfort."

Xiao Chuchou sneered in response.

"No thanks. When my father fought with Chi Wei and ultimately became a sacrifice for him, I made a vow in my youth... I will never condone any sacrificial rituals."

"Chi Wei... He's truly the devil's spawn," Xiao Yuansi muttered resentfully as deep-seated hatred seeped from his usual gentle demeanor.

Xiao Chuchou was taken aback by his sudden change in demeanor. He hesitated before continuing, "I know you resent him, but the war between the immortals and the devils has passed. The line between good and evil has become blurred... Chi Wei is indeed a villain, but hardly a devil's spawn."

"What goodness does he possess?" Xiao Yuansi exclaimed indignantly, unaware of the conflicted look in Xiao Chuchou's eyes.

"More than a hundred and fifty years ago, when I was but an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator, the Demon King at the southern border invaded. Millions faced imminent doom... and while the three sects and seven gates watched from afar, it was Chi Wei and a few others‚Äîwho had just attained the Purple Mansion Realm‚Äîthat intervened. They risked their lives to coerce the ancestors of the Azure Pond Sect and others to take action, ultimately saving the day. Chi Wei sacrificed his lifespan during that battle and severely damaged his cultivation foundation. Had it not been for his sacrifice, he wouldn't still be struggling to break through to the Golden Core Realm even now... Simply put, the Xiao Family and half of Yue State owe him our lives," Xiao Chuchou revealed.

"What..." Xiao Yuansi spluttered, shocked by this sudden revelation.

Xiao Yuansi had only vaguely heard about a demonic rebellion that had happened more than a hundred years ago, but the details eluded him. Hearing Xiao Chuchou's revelation was like a bolt from the blue, leaving his mind reeling with shock and disbelief.

"How can that be..?!" he exclaimed in denial.

As they ventured deeper into the cave, Xiao Chuchou sighed and continued, "Who hasn't dreamed of saving the world and rescuing those in need when they were young? But after decades of stagnation in cultivation, practicing tirelessly day and night with no progress, cultivation itself can become a burden. With all your efforts over the past hundreds of years on the verge of fading away and enemies lurking in the dark, waiting eagerly for your downfall to strike at your descendants and disciples, if you only need to sacrifice a few lives to break through... will you choose to do it?"

Xiao Chuchou's gaze held a mix of emotions, his aged features contorting with pain as he regarded the bewildered Xiao Yuansi.

"To kill is to protect your family and ensure the safety of loved ones... To refrain from killing is to leave yourself vulnerable, risking the slaughter of those dear to us. How many can bear such a burden? Whether it's killing one life or ten thousand, the act remains the same. Once the seed of evil is sown, it's difficult to contain. Chi Wei may have eaten your junior brother, but it's not possible to determine and judge if he's good or evil. While he may have eaten a few talented disciples, he has ultimately saved millions in Yue State."

"Furthermore, with Chi Wei's demise, the Azure Pond Sect will teeter on the brink of collapse. That family your junior brother is born into may be able to call it a day and return home... Yet, the Chi Family..."

While Xiao Chuchou was still talking, Xiao Yuansi could not take it any longer. He finally raised his head, his voice tinged with desperation.

"Old Ancestor, how can the world be so twisted? If good and evil are indistinguishable, and if everyone is a mix of both... where do we find our footing in this world?"

Xiao Chuchou nodded in agreement, his voice barely above a whisper as he remarked, "Immortals under the sun are inherently a blend of good and evil, true purity is a myth. The line between good and evil has blurred ever since the war between the immortals and devils ended. Only enmity remains..."

Xiao Yuansi fell silent for a few breaths before letting out a deep sigh. He found it difficult to calm down. He had joined Qingsui Peak when he was young, where Si Yuanbai had taught him the distinction between good and evil.

Chi Wei had reversed all that he knew, and now Xiao Chuchou's words had shaken him deeply. His emotions churned, causing a divine light to burst forth from his immortal foundation‚Äîthe Vermillion Sage. It appeared that it had been enhanced.

"Only enmity remains..."

As the two conversed, they finally arrived in an empty cave that was devoid of all light. Cultivators of the Foundation Establishment Realm naturally were not troubled by such darkness.

Xiao Yuansi glanced around him, his eyes falling upon a cluster of large yellow flowers blooming in the depths of the cave. A group of stamens curled up, with a drop of glistening dew gathering at the ends of them, emitting a fragrant aroma.

"It's a valuable medicine‚ÄîNine-Stamen Spirit Daylily."

While Xiao Chuchou was still struggling to identify the strange flower, Xiao Yuansi recognized it instantly, having been immersed in the alchemy for many years. Xiao Chuchou nodded in realization and chuckled.

"Even if we don't find any relics here, obtaining this precious herb alone already makes the journey worthwhile."

For cultivators in the Purple Mansion Realm, ordinary spirit items were no longer effective to them. Only the precious medicines that had been nurtured by the essence of heaven and earth could work wonders for them.

Satisfied with their find, Xiao Yuansi flicked his sleeve. Mana surged through his hand but it was without the expected luster of a spell.

"Old Ancestor, please be careful... This flower is sensitive to light."

Xiao Yuansi retrieved a dharma medicine pouch and carefully stowed away the flower. Xiao Chuchou observed the string of medicine pouches draped over Xiao Yuansi's body and chuckled.

"Always prepared, aren't you?"

Xiao Yuansi smiled wryly. Dharma medicine pouches and qi collection bottles like these possessed inner space and could not be stored within storage pouches. Despite this inconvenience, Xiao Yuansi still carried them around with him.

After collecting the Nine-Stamen Spirit Daylily, the two exited the cave and buried the demonic beasts on the ground.

Xiao Chuchou performed a few Spirit Sealing Techniques, then spoke again, "With the current situation of our Xiao Family, the Li Family on Moongaze Lake could provide a breakthrough, securing the west side for our family. Moongaze Lake, backed by Mount Dali, is an advantageous location... Even if Chi Wei dies, the Azure Pond Sect likely won't relinquish control of Moongaze Lake. Given the relationship between our families, using the Li Family as a barrier seems most appropriate."

Xiao Yuansi, his head lowered as he cast spells, nodded in agreement.

"That's good, I've heard that Yongling gets along quite well with Li Tongya... Ruyu and Li Xuanfeng are also friends."

Seeing that Xiao Chuchou and the other ancestors in his family had no plans to expand westward, relief washed over Xiao Yuansi. After all, he had promised Li Chejing that he would look after the Li Family.

He then spoke in a deep voice, "Li Mutian, the ancestor of the Li Family, used to be a farmer before he became a rogue cultivator, eventually attaining the Foundation Establishment Realm. He must be a remarkable individual, and his offspring are likely no less remarkable. Li Tongya, while not exceptionally talented, possesses a good heart. Li Chejing must have inherited his father's talent in swordsmanship... But I have never heard much about Li Mutian. He didn't seem to be famous in the Yue State."

Xiao Chuchou was listening intently to him but suddenly frowned and asked, "Do all four of Li Mutian's sons have a spiritual orifice?"

Unaware of the intent behind the old man's question, Xiao Yuansi pondered for a moment before replying, "The eldest son passed away when he was very young, but the remaining three sons all have spiritual orifices."

Xiao Chuchou raised an eyebrow, the wrinkles on his aged face gathering as he continued, "Oh? And what about their Xuan generation?"

After a moment's recollection, Xiao Yuansi replied slowly, his voice thick with uncertainty.

"There are three boys and one girl... All three sons possess spiritual orifices."

Xiao Chuchou picked up the tail of a spirit beast and flipped its carcass over before storing it in his storage pouch.

"The Yuan generation comes after the Xuan generation, right?"

Xiao Yuansi nodded and replied, "Yes, but I don't know much about those in the Yuan generation... There are more of them. I only know that three of them possess a spiritual orifice."

Xiao Chuchou nodded, feeling a bit reassured. He waved his hand solemnly and commented, "Li Mutian is undoubtedly remarkable. I would not be surprised if he had consumed some extraordinary heavenly treasures at some point. The bloodline of the Li Family doesn't seem like that of an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... it's more akin to that of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator!"

"Oh?!"

Xiao Yuansi was taken aback by this perspective, impressed by the depth of knowledge his old ancestor possessed.

During the decline of the Xiao Family, Xiao Chuchou was only a peak Qi cultivator. He left all the family's treasures and the Essence Gathering Pills to Xiao Chuting and ventured out on his own to seek opportunities. Because of this, he had gained extensive knowledge.

Xiao Yuansi recalled the demeanors of both Li Tongya and Li Xiangping, then nodded thoughtfully and replied, "Indeed... that could be the case."

As the two soared through the sky toward the Li Residence, Xiao Chuchou suddenly smiled and whispered, "I have an idea. Since the Li Family's lineage is exceptional, the Xiao Family could consider marriage with them. This would not only solidify the relationship between our families but also potentially produce a prodigious talent! If the Li Family can unify Moongaze Lake, our family could not only use them as a barrier but also form an alliance with them. After all, we're dependent on each other."

Xiao Yuansi nodded, smiling warmly as he responded, "Old Ancestor, the union you're suggesting is akin to that of the Ning and Chi families within the Azure Pond Sect. They complemented each other and monopolized the Azure Pond..."

"Our families don't need to be that close," Xiao Chuchou interjected, shaking his head. "It's good for the families to get along with each other. However, a union too close risks mutual usurpation. A mutually beneficial relationship, bound by the master-disciple ties, is adequate."

"I understand," Xiao Yuansi affirmed.

As they conversed, Mount Lijing appeared on the horizon. The foot of the mountain was lively, and the morning sunlight cast a gentle glow upon the majestic golden formation, creating a scene akin to that of a fairyland.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Tongya examined the jade boxes on the desk carefully, inspecting each one carefully before stacking them up, shaking his head with a tinge of regret.

"These spirit items from Mount Yue are potent even for those in the Qi Cultivation Realm. However, without the proper elixir or pill formula, ingesting them directly not only diminishes their effectiveness but also poses harm, making future breakthroughs increasingly challenging."

Spirit items, while effective, also carried impurities that could cause adverse effects. Pill crafting involved the careful refinement of these substances to minimize their adverse impacts and maximize their efficacy.

Passing the jade boxes to Li Xuanxuan, Li Tongya suddenly recalled something and asked, "Is Qiuyang still struggling to make a breakthrough?"

Li Xuanxuan nodded, equally as perplexed.

"I've spoken with Qiuyang, and indeed... he's still struggling. It's puzzling! Considering Qiuyang's talent compared to Donghe's back then, he shouldn't be in such a state..."

After thinking for a while, Li Tongya finally recalled a distant memory. Realization dawned upon him as he asked, "Do you remember the Snake Dragon Tree at home?"

"Of course," Li Xuanxuan replied as he nodded slowly. The Snake Dragon Tree could be considered the Li Family's most prized possession after the mirror and the Qingche Sword.

It bore a Snake Dragon Fruit once every five years, which Xiao Yuansi would then refine into pills. Many in the family relied on these Snake Dragon Pills to achieve breakthroughs in their cultivation.

Li Tongya shook his head, recounting an old tale in a warm tone, "Back then, we were able to discover this precious tree all thanks to Qiuyang... The child seemed blessed. He ventured into the mountains and accidentally consumed a Snake Dragon Fruit when he was young. Luckily, the fruit's mild nature only rendered him unconscious for several days. Afterward, the speed of his cultivation was extraordinary. Within just a year, he had managed to condense the Profound Scenery Chakra."

Li Xuanxuan listened intently to the story.

Li Tongya sighed, continuing, "At the time, we all thought it was Qiuyang's good fortune. Little did we know that fortune and misfortune walk hand in hand. His rapid cultivation, fueled by reckless ingestion of the spirit fruit without proper cultivation, left him with underlying issues... Now, he struggles to advance beyond the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."

Realization dawned upon Li Xuanxuan as he nodded. Li Tongya picked up the tea bowl from the table and continued, "Among all the mountains under our family's control, the spiritual qi of the spirit spring on Mount Huaqian flows the thickest. Explain to Qiuyang about his situation, then send him to Mountain Huaqian to cultivate."

"Understood," Li Xuanxuan replied respectfully. As he raised his head, an abrupt buzz emanated from the grand formation, and an elderly voice came through.

"Xiao Chuchou from the Xiao Family has come to visit... Please open the formation, Tongya, my friend."

Li Tongya quickly opened the formation and soared into the sky. Xiao Chuchou and Xiao Yuansi landed atop the mountain with a smile on their faces.

"Greetings, Seniors!" Li Tongya greeted respectfully as he cupped his fist.

"As courteous as ever, Tongya..." Xiao Chuchou remarked with a smile as he followed Li Tongya into the courtyard.

Seated alongside Xiao Yuansi, he accepted the tea that was offered to him. They exchanged a few pleasantries before shifting the conversation to the purpose of his visit.

"Your house's grand formation is ingeniously crafted. I've traversed north and south and have some knowledge of formations... This one is particularly notable," Xiao Chuchou remarked.

"It was set up by Master Liu Changdie," Li Tongya replied, causing Xiao Yuansi to raise his eyebrow at the mention of the name.

"I've seen this Liu Changdie before," Xiao Yuansi chimed in warmly, "He's quite an interesting person... Very skillful in formations and speaks as if he's been around for nearly a century. He seems to know many people."

Xiao Chuchou seemed uninterested in this topic and redirected the discussion. He scrutinized Li Tongya briefly before asking, "How confident are you in building your Dao foundation, Tongya?"

"I haven't completed my Qi Cultivation yet, so I'm uncertain," Li Tongya responded respectfully.

Xiao Chuchou nodded, sharing some crucial insights on laying the Dao foundation. Li Tongya, who had largely relied on himself throughout his cultivation journey, was naturally thrilled to receive such valuable guidance. He absorbed the advice diligently, carefully noting down every wisdom Xiao Chuchou imparted to him mentally.

Xiao Yuansi listened and interjected occasionally, adding his insights.

After receiving their guidance, Li Tongya quickly expressed his gratitude.

Xiao Chuchou smiled and waved his hand, his gaze intense and piercing as he addressed Li Tongya directly.

"Tongya, I'm sure you're also quite informed about my family's affairs!"
