# Chapter 1056: Clarity

A cultivator's Metallic Essence is the crystallization of their life-mandate and Dao-fruit. Supremely exalted and precious, it is a treasure coveted by all under heaven.

Based on Lu Jiangxian's current Dao-Profundity and his understanding of the True Monarch level, the Metallic Essence was something forged within oneself, a power that truly belonged to the cultivator. A Fruition Attainment, on the other hand, was a station granted by Heaven and Earth. Cultivators today often spoke of seeking this golden state of being, a process that involved two distinct stages: forging the essence and ascending to the station. Most only ever managed to complete the first step.

The late Duanmu Kui and, more recently, Si Boxiu had both forged a Metallic Essence. Once such an essence became ownerless, it would be seized by the energies of Heaven and Earth and transform into a demonic entity. In Lu Jiangxian's view, however, these Demons existed in a clear hierarchy.

'A Metallic Essence is fundamentally the cultivator's life-mandate and Dao-fruit. If that cultivator was the master of a Fruition Attainment, the station would recognize them, and by extension, it would recognize their Metallic Essence. Thus, the essence inherits the master's authority...'

These Demons were born with an innate connection to their Fruition Attainment, making them incredibly difficult to oppose. The vile bird formed from the True Monarch Tianwu's Metallic Essence was a prime example; even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator empowered by a divine ability was as fragile as a mortal before the authority of a Fruition Attainment.

But what about the Demons formed from the Metallic Essence of those like Duanmu Kui and Si Boxiu, who had died while attempting to forge their own? How much weaker were they? Lu Jiangxian had carefully considered this and arrived at a surprising conclusion.

'The Demons that manifest after a failed breakthrough... they aren't actually that much weaker.'

The key lay in the nature of failure within the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao.

The moment Lu Jiangxian had seen Wang Xun practicing ancient immortal methods, he knew the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao was a shortcut. It didn't seek to align with one's destiny but instead gambled a lifetime of cultivation on a single moment of connection with a Fruition Attainment. Only in that instant of seeking the Dao, as prescribed by the Purple Mansion Golden Core Demonic Dao, could a Metallic Essence even be said to exist.

When a cultivator seeks to forge their essence and ascend to a station, they are essentially petitioning the station with their own Metallic Essence. In that moment, as long as the station is unoccupied, the Fruition Attainment has already sensed them. To use a crude analogy, the wisp of Metallic Essence left behind from a failed attempt has already become familiar to the station. While its power might diminish over time, in the immediate aftermath of the failure, the resulting Demon is no less formidable than those left from antiquity.

'That's why the Underworld has to dispatch Dharma Treasures... Firstly, their agents in the mortal realm aren't powerful enough and could let some of the more unique Metallic Essences escape. Secondly... some people's Metallic Essences are just that formidable.'

Beyond these, however, was another possibility. Practitioners of ancient Daoist Traditions like the Path of Ingesting Qi and Nurturing Nature, the Shamanic Talisman Dao, or ancient demonic paths—traditions that perfected the life-mandate—could condense a Metallic Essence without ever seeking a Fruition Attainment. They might use it to benefit their descendants or bribe emissaries of the afterlife.

The Demons that condensed from such essences were far inferior to the other two types.

Understanding these distinctions, Lu Jiangxian needed only a single glance to know that the thing on Fuxun was extraordinary.

'It possesses a stable, tyrannical authority. If it goes berserk, the devastation it could unleash would rival that of a True Monarch!'

Ordinarily, the great powers of the world should have been aware of such a significant matter. Yet, Lu Jiangxian had meticulously scanned the Great Void and scoured the mortal realm, finding no trace of them aside from a few Dragon-kin patrols guarding the seas.

'It's not impossible that they simply haven't noticed. After all, this thing was so well hidden that I only detected it after Li Que'wan activated her investigative art...'

Lu Jiangxian had encountered a fair number of True Monarchs over the years, and his spiritual sense was ultimately a cut above. If even he had such difficulty, it was plausible that the other True Monarchs had missed it as well.

'In that case, this entity is no ordinary Demon. It must be the result of some True Monarch's specific technique...'

'Lesser Yang...'

The most likely culprit at the moment was the Demon Monarch from the Great Western Plateau, Xiyan. His full title was the Western Eternal Loyalty White Victory Yan True Monarch. As a demon monarch, it wouldn't be surprising if he had some insidious methods up his sleeve.

He focused his gaze. Fuxun had already settled down in the secret chamber, consuming spiritual items to heal his wounds. Suddenly, the five facial features on the back of his head began to twist, sliding down his cheeks to his chest, then along his waist until they came to rest on his ankle.

The golden lips parted slightly in a smile. They then leaped from his ankle onto the floor, which was covered in array patterns. The pure white eyes remained on his thigh, gazing down at the floor as if guiding the way.

The thing was unsettlingly demonic. The golden lips seemed perfectly natural lying on the floor, not disturbing the grand array in the slightest. The powdered lips twitched, as if the entity might stand up at any moment, treating the entire island as its body.

'If this thing latches onto a member of the Li family, I might be able to fight it quietly. But if it devours all of Deer Weeds Island, the commotion would be so great that no one would survive...'

If the Metallic Essence Demon voluntarily transferred itself to Li Que'wan, Lu Jiangxian was confident he could suppress it. Even if it refused, should Fuxun agree to enter an immortal array, Lu Jiangxian would dare to risk a direct confrontation. But all of this was predicated on it being an ordinary Demon. A doubt lingered in his heart. How could he know if this Demon wasn't some True Monarch's hidden gambit... or perhaps even part of a consensus reached among all of them?

'It's not impossible for a True Monarch to split off a sliver of their Metallic Essence to roam the world! True Monarch Tianwu was able to leave behind three suits of armor as guardians, so why couldn't the others do something similar?'

If that were the case, and the entity simply vanished after attaching itself to Li Que'wan, it would be a dead giveaway.

Fortunately, after wandering about the secret chamber for a while, the lips seemed dissatisfied. They jumped back onto Fuxun's body and retreated to the back of his head, where they began to whisper fiercely amongst themselves.

Lu Jiangxian’s brow furrowed slightly as he listened intently, his suspicions growing stronger.

'This thing has an incredibly high intellect... and possesses multiple consciousnesses that can argue with each other... This is definitely no ordinary Demon!'

Realizing this, he paradoxically felt a sense of relief, though it was mixed with vexation.

"Since it's so intelligent, even if it doesn't understand its master's grand plan, it should at least know how to protect itself and won't erupt without reason. Fuxun wants to join the Dragon-kin now... this might be the entity's suggestion. Perhaps the Demon itself wants to find the dragons... If the Li Clan agrees... we'll be drawn into this mess. But if I ignore it, who knows what madness this Demon will unleash..."

After weighing his options, Lu Jiangxian decided to observe the situation for now. He would first see how the entity reacted before having Li Zhouwei deal with it, effectively passing the time bomb to the Dragon-kin.

His attention divided, he had long since stopped writing, his mind clouded with worry.

'Yang Tianya...'

When Li Zhouwei was heading to Simin, the cultivators of the Yang Clan were holding a secret meeting in their main hall. Though he wasn't physically present, his Immortal Mirror's investigative illumination allowed him to hear their words clearly from afar.

And the name they mentioned, Xuan'an, was the exact same one Chi Buzi had heard from Dingjiao!

'The power behind Mount Dali is a remnant of the Immortal Mansion. It's Xuan'an, and the Azure Insight Origin Mirror.'

He pondered for a moment, his thoughts racing.

"Qingyu Qian and Xuan'an control an immortal array, command the Moon Laurel’s Transmuting Radiance, and possess an Immortal Artifact—the one they call the Azure Insight Origin Mirror..."

This was a crucial clue. The Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book couldn't calculate the schemes of a Dao Embryo, nor could it divine an Immortal Artifact. When he had performed his calculations, the Immortal Mirror itself and many of his conjectured Dao Embryo techniques had been input as known variables. The fact that the Azure Insight Origin Mirror could be calculated meant it wasn't a secret; many smaller Golden Core powers knew of this Immortal Artifact and had revealed its existence.

Through repeated calculations, Lu Jiangxian had even managed to obtain a brief description of the artifact.

'The Azure Insight Origin Mirror... an artifact of an ancient Immortal Lord, capable of making diviners miscalculate and observers miss their mark...'

The strange thing was, Lu Jiangxian couldn't detect the presence of such an Immortal Artifact over the lake at all!

'Either it doesn't exist, or it isn't in the Great Void and doesn't operate through it... If neither of these is true, then the only possibility is that my own broken Profound Mirror is at the Dao Embryo level, the same as an Immortal Artifact, which means they can't sense each other...'

But if Lu Jiangxian couldn't sense it, it meant the fox Demons might know many of the lake's secrets. Qingyu Qian had even specifically cultivated the Celestial-Awakening Ear just to listen to the mortals around the lake. The Demon King claimed he never used it, but if there were no restrictions, how could he possibly resist?

'Mount Dali is a remnant of the Immortal Mansion, a gambit left by its master. The Azure Insight Origin Mirror and Qingyu Qian were left to protect me during my initial stages... And the Moon Laurel’s Transmuting Radiance is key to keeping Moongaze Lake from being completely exposed. Otherwise, with a True Monarch overseeing Moongaze, I wouldn't be able to do anything...'

Although he had never seen the Moon Laurel’s Transmuting Radiance, he had seen something remarkably similar—the Golden Crow's Transmuting Radiance.

That power resided within an immortal array at the bottom of the sea, used to suppress it. Its might was so great that not even a True Monarch could withstand it. That array was precisely where Li Jiangqun had held secret discussions with other cultivators years ago!

'So... there's more than one such immortal array... There must be a corresponding Supreme Yin immortal array... Xuan'an, despite his weakened state, can still influence the world... He must be relying on this Moon Laurel’s Transmuting Radiance...'

'This array is either in the Immortal Mansion's Donghua Heaven, or the Mystic Realm the fox-kin are hiding in is the array itself, allowing them to remain concealed from the Great Void. That has to be it...'

As for Xuan'an... Lu Jiangxian was not entirely without a clue!

When Wanling Heaven fell, the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book had unleashed numerous influences upon the world. Lu Jiangxian had seized the opportunity to set his own plans in motion, using Li Suining as an overt piece on the board, openly exerting the power of the heavenly book.

Because this gambit was so obvious, the moment Li Suining was reborn with altered memories, a power descended from the heavens to investigate him. Lu Jiangxian had been lying in wait, eager to see which faction was monitoring the lake, and he caught the culprit red-handed!

That was when Lu Jiangxian became certain that there was an existence beyond the Purple Mansion Realm behind the fox clan.

Although the aura vanished in an instant, Lu Jiangxian was far more powerful now than before. Having personally used the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book for deductions, he immediately identified the aura as belonging to the Heaven–Governing Dao. The realization brought a strange expression to his face.

The aura possessed an extremely high status but seemed to be suppressed by something, leaving it utterly exhausted. If the Grand Divination Heavenly Element Book hadn't been a Rank Designation of the Heaven–Governing Dao, allowing him to leverage its authority to intercept the probe, it would have dissipated into thin air midway.

This led Lu Jiangxian to a secret conjecture.

"Either this Xuan'an is incredibly weak... or... he is not the true master of the Immortal Artifact and is himself constrained by the Azure Insight Origin Mirror's influence! If it's the latter, my position becomes much more advantageous!"

But regardless of which it was, the fox-kin had been instrumental in allowing the Li Clan to develop safely to this point. Knowing the other party possessed an immortal array and an Immortal Artifact, Lu Jiangxian did not act rashly. He simply made a mental note.

'For now, I'll watch how things unfold. I'll wait for Li Zhouwei and Chi Buzi to perfect their divine abilities and uncover more high-level secrets... to see the true origins of these people... It would be best to wait until Li Zhouwei overcomes his current tribulation... and I take my own most crucial step before deciding anything.'

His gaze shifted, returning to Fuxun in the secret chamber.

'If I don't get rid of this thing quickly... how can Li Que'wan possibly enter seclusion on this island? At her current Dao-Profundity, she should be ready for seclusion in five or six years... Five or six years... Li Zhouwei should also be coming out of seclusion once by then. Alas... but that means I'll have to divert my attention to watch over the island during that time.'

He wasn't surprised that Li Que'wan's cultivation speed was accelerating. If a secret art was an extremely difficult exam, she had already been studying the answer key for decades.

'By distributing the time needed to practice secret arts across the earlier years of cultivation, those foundational Daoist principles can in turn aid one's progress and breakthroughs at every stage... This is probably how the Golden Core Daoist Traditions cultivate their disciples...'

This method was slower in the early stages but offered nothing but benefits later on. The only catch was that it required profound Daoist arts that were closely linked to Purple Mansion Realm secret arts—something only a power with a seated True Monarch could possibly provide.

It was precisely because this model of studying advanced arts early on was so beneficial for the Purple Mansion Realm that Lu Jiangxian, having tasted its sweetness, had hastily chosen the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record for Li Jiangchun. This wasn't just to delay his name from appearing on the Sword Gate's registry, giving him more time to develop, but also for his future in the Purple Mansion Realm!

This art couldn't compare to the Shamanic Talisman Dao, but it was still a carefully considered choice. When the time came... even if Li Jiangchun's speed in practicing secret arts couldn't match Li Que'wan's, it would still far surpass Li Jiangqian's.

'The All-Fragrance Sinks he practices, while situated within the three yins, is a Lesser Yin foundation, which contains a great deal of yang. Cultivating in a place of Bright Yang isn't a bad choice. Furthermore, All-Fragrance Sinks is at the confluence of Lesser Yin and Pure Qi, which has the effect of boosting cultivation. Thanks to Li Suining's interference, Li Ximing was never injured and didn't get entangled with the White Victory Dao. If Ximing is lucky and can really get him the Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew from the Peacock Sea—a spiritual herb with a perfectly compatible origin—I'll have less to worry about for him.'

'Besides... with this change, he's obtained a wisp of Purple Qi, and Li Ximing's World's Radiance is finally complete. In the worst-case scenario I divined, it took him five full attempts...'

Although Lu Jiangxian didn't know much about the Lesser Yin Fruition Attainment, his choice of that path had been carefully considered. He still held most of the divine ability cultivation he had taken from Shaohui for Chi Buzi's Profound Blade. As soon as he had the chance to bestow it upon Li Ximing and help him form his core, pairing it with the Wondrous Shade-Pool Dew would make Li Jiangchun's cultivation speed before and after reaching the Purple Mansion Realm truly terrifying.

'The only problem is that the cultivation method he uses has been modified by me to have the potential of a sixth-grade art, but he doesn't have a single secret art to go with it. That's another project entirely!'

Feeling a bitter taste in his heart, he had no choice but to pull several more cultivation methods and spell arts from the pile of divinations on his desk—ones the Li family was projected to acquire. He sent them off for Dangjiang to work overtime modifying them, lest he be the only one buried in work.
