# Chapter 694: The Background of the Three Sects

A golden light shimmered across the surface of Moongaze Lake. Inside the main hall on the island, two Daoists stood in uneasy silence. An entire row of jade boxes sat on a nearby table, completely ignored. To the side, a young woman in a red dress sipped her tea, her eyes crinkling into a smile.

"Miss Minggong..."

One of the Daoists, a man built like a small mountain with black tattoos etched across his face and a tiger-striped robe, stood with his head bowed respectfully. Despite being a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, his voice was meek.

"Miss... is there any word from the Daoist Master?"

This man was Daoist Wenhu, the master of Dense Cloud Cave, one of the three sects of the Secret Diffusion region. He had established his foundation in the Southern Sea. Just a day ago, his forces were constantly harassing the shores guarded by Li Minggong, and getting an audience with him would have been an impossible dream. Now, the tables had turned completely.

Seeing his subservience, Li Minggong didn't put on any airs. "Please wait for the report from my clan's cultivators," she said softly.

The other Daoist was weaker, only at the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. He had an unremarkable face and an average build, and he kept his spiritual aura tightly suppressed, not daring to let any of it leak out. This was Pingwang Zi, the master of Brahma Cloud Cave and the only true immortal cultivator among the three cave masters. Perhaps because Brahma Cloud Cave was the weakest of the three, it had always been the quietest.

Although he was an immortal cultivator, the way he kept his aura locked down suggested he was no stranger to using arts fueled by blood and qi. Now, he was too afraid to even speak.

The two men exchanged a look, then grabbed the jade boxes and tried to press them into Li Minggong's hands. Daoist Wenhu, despite his brutish appearance, spoke with surprising finesse. "Miss Minggong," he said with a fawning smile, "we had hoped our friend An Siwei might put in a good word for us, but he is a man of uncompromising integrity and scorns such humble offerings... Perhaps you might take a look..."

Li Minggong had just fought the men from Dense Cloud Cave a few days ago; she had no intention of accepting his gifts. "Take them back," she said politely. "I have no influence with the Patriarch. You'll have to give them to An Siwei."

The three sects of Secret Diffusion had once been on equal footing with the Li clan, but they were powerless before a Purple Mansion cultivator. Floating Cloud Cave had already been destroyed, and the two remaining cave masters felt as if they were sitting on pins and needles. Finally, they saw An Siwei descending from the clouds.

They scrambled to greet him, showering him with every flattering word they could think of, but An Siwei ignored them completely. They could only look pleadingly at Li Minggong. The woman in red glanced at the table. Taking the hint, the two men quickly mixed their gifts in with the pile of confiscated spiritual items.

An Siwei had personally witnessed the arrogance of the three sects before Li Ximing emerged from his seclusion. Though his anger had subsided, he was still far from cordial. "Masters," he said in a low, formal tone, "if you please."

Steeling themselves, the two men followed him into the air. The sky was beginning to darken. As Daoist Wenhu walked with his head bowed through the long corridors of the palace, his heart grew heavy.

'I wonder what kind of divine power this Daoist Master has cultivated. Is it a life divine ability? If it is, this will be very difficult to handle...'

Whatever dismissiveness he had once felt toward Li Ximing had vanished. In the presence of a true Daoist Master, even thinking a disrespectful thought was dangerous. The best course of action was to not think at all. He quickly suppressed the notion.

After a short walk, he entered the main hall. A cultivator in a white and gold robe stood at the head of the room, his profile turned toward them. A blinding Heavenly Radiance seemed to pulse from between his brows, but otherwise, his features were not particularly remarkable.

"This humble cultivator, Wenhu, pays his respects to the Daoist Master! Congratulations on achieving your great divine power!"

"This humble cultivator, Pingwang, pays his respects! Congratulations, Daoist Master!"

The two men bowed low in unison. They felt a sudden heat on the crowns of their heads and knew the Daoist Master's gaze had fallen upon them.

Li Ximing gave them a brief glance. The Heavenly Radiance between his brows had already seen through them. Daoist Wenhu's foundation was of the Xiukui lineage, a type known as Hurricane Ghost Yin. Pingwang Zi's immortal foundation, however, was peculiar; he had never seen it before, though it might belong to the Ancient Merging Dao Lineage.

'Wenhu has some strength, but his Hurricane Ghost Yin is countered by my own arts. I could have suppressed him even before I reached the Purple Mansion Realm. As for Pingwang Zi, his foundation doesn't seem suited for combat. He's not worth mentioning.'

The two of them together couldn't even defeat his brother, Li Xizhi. It was no wonder they had spent the last decade dithering, resorting to a slow war of attrition.

The two masters didn't dare look up. Li Ximing sipped his tea and spoke softly, "State your origins."

Although the three sects of Secret Diffusion had colluded with the Golden Tang Gate, Li Ximing knew other Purple Mansion cultivators had to be pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The Golden Tang Gate was just the pawn on the board.

Now came the moment where they had to reveal their backers to save their lives. Daoist Wenhu didn't dare hesitate. The hulking man was the first to cup his hands.

"My given name is Shi Wenya," he said respectfully. "I was originally a cultivator from Mount Xiaoshi. I later received guidance from Lord Chidu of the White Ye Immortal Sect and traveled to the Southern Sea to cultivate. There, I established my foundation and slowly made a name for myself. I heard from Lord Chidu that Jiangbei was a stable region with fertile spiritual lands, so I came here to settle down."

He kept his head bowed, having revealed everything down to his real name. The White Ye Immortal Sect he mentioned was one of the two new Purple Mansion sects established in Jiangbei a decade ago. Li Ximing rested a hand on the table and nodded.

"So, White Ye Immortal Sect. My family has no grievances with your esteemed Dao. Now that things have come to this, did Chidu have any message for me?"

"Yes, yes, he did," Wenhu said quickly. "The master said that he will come personally to offer his apologies to you in three months."

Li Ximing's expression remained neutral. It was clear that this Chidu from the White Ye Immortal Sect lacked sincerity. But as a rogue cultivator from the Eastern Sea who had mastered three divine powers, he certainly had the capital to be arrogant.

He turned his gaze to Pingwang Zi, who immediately forced a placating smile. "Daoist Master, as you can clearly see, Brahma Cloud Cave rarely involved itself in the affairs concerning your esteemed clan. At most, we were coerced by the other two sects under the pretense of unity. Only then did Brahma Cloud Cave have no choice but to send men..."

Li Ximing had already heard from An Siwei that Brahma Cloud Cave was indeed less active, but ninety percent of the reason was their own lack of strength and manpower. "I asked for your origin," he said softly.

The simple sentence sent a cold sweat beading on Pingwang Zi's nose. He didn't dare blink. "My... my given name is Wang Jun," he stammered. "I am a cultivator from Brahma Cloud Cave on Mount Xiaoshi. In my early years, I was fortunate enough to receive the patronage of Lord Zhong Qian, which allowed me to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. I followed him to Jiangbei."

"Later, under his instruction, I returned to Mount Xiaoshi to revive the Brahma Cloud Cave lineage and operate in Jiangbei under the Three Sects Agreement..."

Li Ximing's expression softened slightly. "So you are from the Chengyun Immortal Gate," he said quietly. "Sect Master Zhong Qian has had some dealings with my family."

He set down his teacup. "And what of Floating Cloud Cave?"

Pingwang Zi eagerly chimed in. "Floating Cloud Cave's territory is the southernmost, and they were always the ones stirring up trouble. Their backer was indeed the Golden Tang Gate. You can rest assured of that, Daoist Master."

Li Ximing fell silent, pondering the situation.

The picture was now clear. The Chengyun Immortal Gate had been founded by Daoist Master Changyun and a group of demonic cultivators. They were the weakest of the major powers in the region and had some connection to his own clan. It was only natural that Brahma Cloud Cave, with its limited resources, would be reluctant to stir up conflict.

The Golden Tang Gate, however, still had some power. They had colluded with Floating Cloud Cave, which bordered the Li clan's territory, and had repeatedly caused trouble. As for Dense Cloud Cave's backer, the White Ye Immortal Sect, they were clearly no friends to the Li clan either. In fact, they might pose an even greater threat.

Seeing Li Ximing's silence, Daoist Wenhu chimed in obsequiously, "Daoist Master, most of the cultivators from Floating Cloud Cave have been captured by your men! They are all weeping with remorse, swearing they would die to prove their loyalty to you... Please, investigate the matter yourself!"
