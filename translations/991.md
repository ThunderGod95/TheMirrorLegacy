# Chapter 991: Revering Martial Arts

"Drip. Drop."

A cold rain had fallen all night. The lamps on the desk cast a dim, heavy light. The handsome young man holding the brush wore a troubled expression, his golden eyes shining brightly in the gloom.

"The cultivators around Simin Prefecture are massing... We don't even need men from the mountains to estimate at least ten at the Foundation Establishment Realm... This is too risky..."

He raised his eyebrows and looked at the man beside him. "Attendant Chen, I think we need to be more cautious regarding Liyuan Dao. It's the height of the spring planting season, and the lands around Liyuan Dao are the most fertile in all of Lixia Prefecture. If a fight breaks out there, this year's harvest will be ruined... There won't be peace for the entire year."

"Oh?" The man to his side, dark-complexioned, frowned at these words. He replied, sounding troubled, "Lord Li, I see you've considered that... but... we can't afford to delay. In my opinion, if we must fight, we fight. If things get bad... we can just send people to distribute some grain."

"That is no simple matter." Li Jiangliang set down his brush and rubbed the bridge of his nose. "Who will distribute it? And to whom? The common folk working the fields will be the ones to suffer. The landlords and gentry won't show any mercy. With the Xiao family gone, Lixia Prefecture still lacks a local power strong enough to maintain order. To make matters worse, the population has grown considerably in recent years. If chaos breaks out, it will be difficult to control, and we have too few men... We can't afford to waste them on this."

He said gravely, "His Lordship stated that we are to govern by ensuring peace and letting the people rest. I understand that time is of the essence, but this requires serious consideration."

This Attendant Chen sighed heavily. "You'll have to take this up with His Lordship. I've just received orders to help Lord Ruan draft the regulations for the Palace of Revering Martial Arts... Besides, suppressing the local clans is the priority. If there's no major clan governing Liyuan Dao, who knows which passing cultivator might just seize it? Even if the people have grain, they won't have the lives to eat it."

Li Jiangliang saw his evasiveness and frowned inwardly. 'Chen Wenyao cares about the people's livelihood, but he's unwilling to offend anyone. He always seeks the middle ground.'

Aloud, he said, "In that case, I will ask Si Yuanlan to go and inquire about the order. As for the matter of a major clan governing... that isn't so difficult. If we truly conquer Yue State, we can just appoint some cultivators of clean background and outstanding character to establish new clans."

"For now, the Wilderness blocks the north, so that isn't an immediate problem. Once we win this battle and gather our forces, we can temporarily suppress these territories."

Chen Wenyao nodded, then suddenly looked over with a smile. "I heard your clan has joyous news?"

"Ah!" Li Jiangliang smiled. "Indeed. One of my older sisters is getting married. Unfortunately, I'm needed here and cannot return for it."

Chen Wenyao clearly knew who the Si Xunhui were. He finally put down his brush, saying with some apprehension, "I'm beginning to have doubts. Azure Pond is an immortal sect, after all. Even if they've tacitly allowed our actions in the Mushroom Forest Plains, they can't just turn a blind eye and permit a group of people to act so wantonly on their borders..."

Li Jiangliang, however, was confident. He shook his head and laughed.

"Attendant Chen, you worry far too much. The figures at the top are handling it. You and I just need to manage matters at the Foundation Establishment Realm. What is there to fret about?"

Chen Wenyao hesitated for a moment. "I just have one concern. His Lordship speaks of vanquishing demons and defending the Dao... but who is the demon? And who is the Dao? Azure Pond has many disciples from aristocratic families... This will not be easy to handle..."

Li Jiangliang mused, "Who is the demon... That is not something to be discussed lightly. The Chi family is already destroyed. If that day truly comes, we will act according to His Lordship's command. We certainly won't be exterminating everyone..."

His gaze shifted slightly as he hinted, "Of that batch of outstanding talents we presented to His Lordship, how many had 'clean' family names? His Lordship didn't say a critical word. That alone is enough to see his intentions..."

Chen Wenyao sighed with emotion. Seeing Li Jiangliang raise an eyebrow, he continued flatly, "His Lordship isn't here to establish a Thunder Palace. This is 'Preserving Truth and Revering Martial Arts,' not 'Pacifying Devils and Suppressing Heresy.' Otherwise, the path here would be slick with blood... How many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators have we actually executed? Your clan can rest easy."

Exposed so directly, Chen Wenyao shook his head, slightly embarrassed. Just then, he saw hurried footsteps outside the hall. A man strode in, looking quite heroic and imposing. He held a command token and smiled, "A deep discussion at this late hour? What fine spirits, you two!"

"Lord Ruan!"

Li Jiangliang rose to greet him. The man's expression turned serious. "An order from His Lordship! Our forces are not to advance to Liyuan Dao. Await further commands!"

Chen Wenyao first acknowledged the order, then rose. He looked at Li Jiangliang with envy and smiled. "It seems Lord Li's calculations were correct after all!"

...

The Northern Sea.

The Northern Sea was a realm of ice and snow, covered in glaciers and frozen islands. As far as the eye could see, there was only deep blue and blinding white. Although the Northern Sea was small, its terrain was complex, rivaling the Eastern and Western seas. Despite the ice, it held lands of thunder, Pit Water, and Jade True—a truly wondrous sight.

Further west, the ice melted, giving way to a place of metallic stone, fire, and the dawn light of the Supreme Yang. It was known as Jieyu.

Li Ximing had heard this name. The Feather-Shedding Land was the dominion of luan and phoenix, the place where the Tree of One Heart grew. It possessed all five types of fire and, even more rarely, spiritual items of the Supreme Yang. Most of the world's renowned avian beasts originated from this land.

The Feather-Shedding Land itself was vast. In fact, a large reason for the Northern Sea's small perceived size was that the Feather-Shedding Land and Cangzhou took up so much of it. There were many cultivators within, but unfortunately, the Vast Desert Wind blew year-round, making the land uninhabitable for ordinary people. It couldn't support mortals like Cangzhou, and thus, fewer major powers had taken root.

Li Ximing crossed the Hetian Sea and arrived at the Northern Sea. He could faintly make out a crimson glow to the west. He longed to see it, but he was pressed for time. He could only change direction, flying northeast over the thick ice and snow until, at last, he saw Cangzhou.

The rivers here flowed gray-black. The mountains were treacherous, teeming with bizarre insects and exotic beasts. Leeches, mites, and venomous snakes were countless in the mountains. He swept his gaze over the land and recognized it.

"It's true what the legends say. In Cangzhou, the Pit Water flows rampant! While it's not uninhabitable like the Feather-Shedding Land, anyone without experience or a cultivation base would find it perilous to travel... The people here... they cannot live easy lives."

After getting his bearings, he quickly located Mount Pai'er in Pit North Prefecture.

The mountain wasn't tall. It was a mass of gray-black rock, upon which sat palaces of black and indigo. It stood in contrast to Mount Xianyou, which had been moved to its side—one high, one low, one east, one west. They complemented each other, creating a unique vista.

This sight made Li Ximing recall the Mount Xianyou of the past.

"When I cultivated in the mountains back then, I studied its layout. It also had a left and right peak, with a supporting peak standing opposite. That mountain is still in Lixia Prefecture... I believe it's called Flying Relic Mountain..."

Li Ximing felt a knot of complicated emotions. Unlike his brothers, he had spent a long part of his childhood living with the Xiao family... It left an indelible mark on him.

'I was young then, lonely, with no companions... just two or three servants. On days when I finished my lessons, I would secretly throw on a straw cloak and wander down to the river in the light rain. I even bought a boatman's skiff to drift and drink wine from a small silver stove... Those moments... they never existed at the Lake.'

'I have never known such times again in this century of cultivation.'

The Xiao family was a leisurely one, unlike the Li Clan, where someone supervised every matter. Jade Court and Qingdu were swords of restraint, but they also ensured that Moongaze Lake never knew that kind of peaceful-world comfort. In a clan consumed by resentment, scheming for revenge day and night, even pleasure was a sin. That kind of peace could not exist.

He rode the wind down. Sure enough, he saw several Xiao family disciples sweeping the steps. A bleak, cold rain drifted from the sky. Li Ximing called out, "Are you of the Xiao Clan? The Li Clan of Moongaze has come to visit!"

When the group saw him, every last one of them knelt. One person scrambled up the mountain to report, crying out in apology. A moment later, a streak of light shot down from the peak, landing urgently before him and revealing an old man.

The old man's hair and beard were completely white, his features kind and gentle. He held a wooden staff from which hung several small medicine pouches, and he wore only a thin gray robe.

His gaze was warm, though his eyes were slightly red. "Greetings, Daoist Master!"

Li Ximing quickly supported him, using his free hand to steady the man affectionately. He replied simply, "Master, there is no need for this!"

This was, in fact, his master, Xiao Yuansi.

Xiao Yuansi had aged early and rapidly. He carried a knot in his heart, a burden from the past he could never release. Though his life was not one of hardship, he remained submerged in old pains. He had no accomplished heirs and had taken no other disciples in the sect. Li Ximing was his only one. He was overjoyed to see him and soon broke into a smile.

"Times have changed. You truly carry the air of a Daoist Master now."

Li Ximing shook his head, slightly embarrassed, and followed the old man up, asking after his well-being. But Xiao Yuansi raised his head and said:

"I haven't been to the mainland in many years, but I still hear the news. If it's possible... my junior sister's Yuan family... I must ask the Daoist Master to look after them..."

Li Ximing knew he always worried about old acquaintances. He reassured him, "The Yuan clan ran into some trouble, but their bloodline survives... They may not be as prominent as before, but that is not necessarily a bad thing..."

Xiao Yuansi nodded silently. "What the Daoist Master says is true... I was planning to seek you out myself. For many years, one matter has weighed on my mind... Now... with Daoist Master Qinghu's achievement, there is finally some hope. I pray we can... find news of your Grandmaster."

At this, Li Ximing understood. His Grandmaster was named Si Yuanbai. In terms of generation, he should be Si Yuanli's older brother, and moreover, the master of his own ancestor. For both sentiment and duty, he had to ask. He committed the matter to heart.

With this brief exchange, Xiao Yuansi led him to Mount Pai'er and then quietly withdrew.

At the summit, a lake had been set, its water as black as ink. Snow dusted the mountain. A fishing rod of pure, translucent jade rested on the bank. Though the mountain wind howled, the fishing line, seemingly forged from fine steel, did not move an inch.

"Zhaojing, you've come."

Li Ximing took a seat at a jade table. Only then did an old man materialize beside it.

Compared to Xiao Yuansi's weariness, Xiao Chuting looked almost exactly as he had years ago. In fact, due to his advancement in cultivation, he seemed even more at ease. His hand rested on the table, holding a black-covered book.

"Greetings, Senior! Congratulations on your achievement!"

Li Ximing cupped his hands in salute. He took out the jade box containing the Water-Mallow Stone and placed it quietly on the table. He smiled, "The mainland was in turmoil recently. The various families were in peril, fearing for their survival. This junior was unable to come and offer congratulations in time. I hope Senior will forgive me..."

"It matters not... But you've spent too much."

Xiao Chuting's gaze, holding a smile, swept gently over the jade box. He poured the tea, his eyes settling on the white, drifting snow reflected in the black lake.

"The White Qilin is now known to all the world."

Li Ximing nodded silently, his expression complex. He didn't know how to respond for a moment, so he followed the man's gaze to Mount Pai'er and praised, "A fine treasure-land of Pit Water."

Xiao Chuting sipped his tea. "The ancient cultivators were casual with their names... A Great Daoist Master once fell here, temporarily turning this place into a mountain of Supreme Yang Radiant Fire. But as ages passed, the cultivators who trained here consumed the Radiant Fire. At the same time, the Pit Water in Cangzhou flows rampant and could not be suppressed. Gradually, it reverted to a land of Pit Water."

The boundless snow reflected in his eyes. "A Purple Mansion Realm, no matter how great, cannot overcome a True Monarch. Cangzhou is the Prefecture of Pit Water. You can change it for a time, but not for an era. It was bound to return to its original master's divine ability—this is the grand trend."

Li Ximing's expression sobered. He heard Xiao Chuting ask quietly, "What were Kui Qi's last words?"

Li Ximing was silent for a beat before answering, "Supreme Yang Radiance, no more."

The old man raised his eyebrows. "He understood it in his heart, then."

"With the True Monarch having attained the high seat, the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition lost its protective talisman. Its decline was inevitable. Perhaps they once held out hope for certain... individuals... But that hope was shattered, time and again. The fall of every Daoist Master from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition was not just a death; it represented the silence of a great power."

"Even knowing how slim the chances were, he was unwilling to forsake the pride of the Supreme Yang. He had to try."

Li Ximing's heart grew heavy. "Why... must it be this way? Is it because of 'True Qi'?"

There was no surprise in Xiao Chuting's eyes. He set down his cup. "I have few scruples now. I might as well discuss this matter with you."

He slowly sat up straight, his expression serene and deep. "Zhaojing..."

"All cultivators in the world seek their own position. But it is the grand current of fate—that is the true power that decides which positions can be taken, and which will be reclaimed."

"The path of 'True Qi' is one of divine might and profound mystery, revering martial arts and seeking truth. Once this position is achieved, it grants the wielder the boon of seeking truth and the merit of achieving the Dao for all... Do you know what that means? Do you know why Anhuai Heaven's fall was so swift, so careless, so... impatient?"

"There are many great powers who wish to merge with the truth, to cultivate the Dao, and to pave the way for their descendants. And those three parts of Metallic Essence... they have long had masters prepared for them, time and time again, by the lofty Daoist Traditions."

"And the Dragon-kin... They also seek this truth. They, too, are waiting for this path to be filled. They have waited for this very day!"

Li Ximing slowly raised his eyebrows. Those fragmented words finally began to connect in his mind. That ancient, cold voice still echoed in his ears.

"Now that someone has obtained the True Monarch's Metallic Essence, they will, of course, seek to repeat the imperial achievements of the True Monarch Tianwu. A great turmoil is inevitable... which also suits the tastes of several other great powers..."

"But who will give up their position in Jiangnan? Who else can be forced to cut their own flesh? They have been lying on another's platter for hundreds of years. Now, the platter is to be washed to hold new things. Who can say it isn't right?"

"Whether to merge with the Dao and seek truth, to stir up chaos, or to plot for change... All these great figures stand high above, waiting. They are all waiting for the master of 'True Qi' to claim their throne!"

"Which side this master of 'True Qi' favors has almost become a secondary concern!"

An inexplicable light flickered in his eyes. He said softly, "You must understand... all the surging undercurrents in the world, be they the struggles between Daoist Traditions or the rise and fall of celestial dynasties, ultimately center on a single golden seat. Rise and fall, all for the sake of that honored position. Heaven and Earth move as one... Heaven and Earth move as one! With such forces in play, how could the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition not decline?"

Li Ximing slowly closed his eyes and exhaled, struggling to maintain his composure. After a long while, he said, "But... But doesn't the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition... don't they understand...?"

Xiao Chuting turned to look at him. His eyes were as still and placid as the lake before them, and perhaps even colder. The old man spoke softly.

"They always had a price to pay. Without shedding some blood, there would be no stability. Besides... the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition certainly has its share of people who understand... The affair with the Murong back then..."

"Didn't they just... understand _too_ early?!"
