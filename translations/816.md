# Chapter 816: Beihai Sea

Purple Smoke Gate.

Ethereal purple qi, unchanged for a hundred years, drifted through the mountain range. This land seemed eternally steeped in violet hues, with peaks jutting like islands from a purple sea of clouds, orderly and imbued with an immortal aura.

A stream of light drifted up the mountain, revealing a young woman riding the wind. She wore a simple white blouse and a purple skirt, her face round and her eyes bright above delicate ears. Though her attire was not extravagant, its neat propriety gave her a pleasant charm.

"Junior Sister Queyi!" a voice called from the mountainside.

She looked toward the sound just as a man hurried over on the wind, landing before her with a smile. "Back so early today!"

This was Li Queyi, a disciple of the Purple Smoke Gate currently at the third layer of Qi Refining. Seeing the man, she quickly bowed. "Greetings, Senior Brother Huang! I should be practicing my sword right now, but I received an urgent message from the sect. I’m being sent to the Eastern Sea... so I returned early."

The Purple Smoke Gate’s station in the Eastern Sea had been suffering disasters for half a year—landslides, tsunamis, and shattering islands had shifted all the earth and fire veins. The sect was overwhelmed, having already pulled most of their personnel from Moongaze Lake, leaving the main sect short-handed. This Second Senior Brother was well aware of the situation.

"Why are they sending *you*?" he asked doubtfully. "You’ve only been cultivating for such a short time! What kind of reasoning is that? This will be hard to explain, won't it? Does Master know?"

He clearly understood her background; if someone barely in the Qi Refining realm was sent out and met with misfortune, the sect would have no way to answer to the Li family.

Li Queyi forced a smile. "Naturally, they aren't sending me to fight. I cultivate the Jade True lineage, and the formation on that island is also from the Jade True system. I’m just going to handle logistics."

"Well, that makes sense…" Senior Brother Huang relaxed slightly, though worry lingered on his face. They descended together, heading toward their peak.

Ziqi Peak was not poorly situated; it rested on the right flank, encircled by mountains. Had its position been slightly more central, it would have directly faced Mu Zuo Peak. As the morning dawn broke, the world turned golden.

Senior Brother Huang hesitated for a long moment before finally speaking. "About last time… what I mentioned to you, Junior Sister. The Treasured Virtue Pill... Any word on that ingredient I needed, the White Zi Root? The sect doesn't have many alchemists, and it's terribly troublesome... you have to reserve their time far in advance."

He gave an awkward laugh. "I’m not… I’m not trying to pressure you, Junior Sister. This is just a loan. Your Senior Brother is truly facing barren pockets right now. Once I gather the necessary cultivation resources, I will absolutely repay you tenfold in the future..."

A trace of fatigue crossed Li Queyi’s face, but she maintained her forced smile. "I have already written home to ask. If there is any news, they will certainly send word. Please rest assured, Senior Brother."

The Purple Smoke Gate’s stipend for disciples wasn't bad, but not every disciple possessed an influential background. Ling Yanzi, in particular, was a lone wolf. The few disciples he accepted were either commoners or came from minor Qi Refining clans. The old man simply didn't know how to manage connections, yet he possessed an overly compassionate heart and preferred accepting disciples of humble status. Back when he first gave the Li family their entry token, they, too, were merely a Qi Refining family.

This Second Senior Brother was desperate to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. The sect had already provided him with one share of resources, and Ling Yanzi had given him what little he could spare, but naturally, the more resources one had, the better. Thus, he frequently turned to Li Queyi.

Li Queyi was utterly exhausted by it. Everyone on the peak treated her with overwhelming affection, seemingly wanting to praise her higher than the heavens, but in reality, they were all just staring at the resources in her pockets. If the items were truly hers to give, it would be one thing. But these were things she had to beg her family for, time and time again. How could she bear to keep opening her mouth to ask!

Ling Yanzi, meanwhile, understood nothing of management. Her senior brothers weren't inherently bad people, but for the sake of their Dao path to Foundation Establishment, even a good person could become ruthless. In private, they swallowed their pride again and again to plead with her. Every time Li Queyi picked up her brush to write home, her heart ached with grievance.

'I’m not asking for these senior brothers to be like Wen Wu of Mu Zuo Peak, arranging everything perfectly, carefully selecting techniques for me, and managing all the connections with the alchemy and artifact-refining peaks. But surely they don’t have to force my hand like this, over and over again… This…'

'When I first arrived, I knew this peak was inferior to the others. I assumed that if I just cultivated hard and maintained good relationships, everything would be fine. But who could have known that a poor and bitter peak has its own logic... How could this life be anything *but* bitter?'

Ling Yanzi was genuinely good to her, yet even he had privately requested resources from the Li family on two occasions. Li Jiangqian had spotted the underlying issue at a glance and mentioned it subtly in a letter. Li Queyi understood immediately: it was the cost of currying favor with her master. The old man had to support too many disciples, stretching every single spirit stone as if it were two. She saw that clearly enough.

A few days ago, Wen Wu had brought Li Quexi to visit, hoping to strengthen the relationship between the cousins. Who knew what pills Mu Zuo Peak had provided Li Quexi, but her cultivation speed was terrifyingly fast. Worse, Li Queyi heard that her cousin was actually sending spiritual items she acquired *back* to the family. This news made Li Queyi feel even more insignificant.

This trip to the Eastern Sea—she claimed it was a sect arrangement, but in truth, Li Queyi had privately begged a senior sister from the Xiao family, who also cultivated at Purple Smoke, to arrange it. She just wanted an excuse to escape.

Yet, she could still understand the desperation driving her senior brothers as they risked everything for a chance at Foundation Establishment. She could only lower her voice. "I don't need Senior Brother to repay me multiple times over. My family has some spare capacity, so I am willing to help my martial brothers. I have already sent the letter home. If the family obtains the root, they will send it directly to Master. I am leaving for the overseas assignment soon, so Senior Brother can just collect it from Master when it arrives."

She gave a slight bow, excused herself, and retreated to her own rooms, feeling an isolating chill seep out from the entire peak. She was at a complete loss.

'How did it come to this? Poverty is one thing, but why can’t martial siblings support each other with basic fellowship? Instead, they scramble over one another to scheme for my things. Meanwhile, the wealthy Mu Zuo Peak is filled with righteous, generous people, all of them focused wholeheartedly on clearing obstacles for my cousin…'

Beihai Sea.

The Beihai Sea was an sea within the greater Hetian Sea domain. Its total area was not large; if one discounted the numerous reefs and islets dotting its surface, the remaining water was smaller than two Splitreed Islands combined. Yet, it was ludicrously wealthy, overflowing with spiritual items, truly the spiritual essence of the Hetian Sea.

The dragon lineage had a custom of 'shepherding the seas.' In the past, this meant Dragon Princes were rotated between the various oceans like traveling magistrates. Nowadays, it more closely resembled a feudal system of enfeoffment. Each Dragon King governed a fixed sea territory, but these domains were invariably outside the Hetian Sea, scattered between the Vermillion Sea's Strait of Ten Thousand Isles and the World's Navel.

The Hetian Sea proper was akin to the Dragon Monarch's personal domain and was not meant to be partitioned off. But exceptions always exist. In the last millennium, three exceptionally favored Dragon Kings had been granted fiefs within Hetian. The Beihai Sea was the smallest of these, but it was the closest to the core territory, bordering the Yinzhou island where the dragons dwelled. It was practically adjacent to the capital. This alone demonstrated the immense favor and status held by the Beihai Dragon King.

The central sea was perfectly calm. A few small boats drifted on the currents. A figure squatted on the bow of the lead vessel, his eyes glowing green as he stared intently ahead. After a moment, he slipped back into the cabin and whispered, "Young Master, Changliu Gorge is just ahead."

Inside, a young man leaned against the bulkhead, his pair of golden pupils emitting a faint, yin-like glow in the shadows. Hearing the report, he merely replied, "Slow the boat. Follow the coast west and look for settlements. There is no need to head straight for the gorge."

The green-eyed man immediately rose, hopped back to the bow, and drew a pair of slimy, dark-green hands from within his robes, using them to slowly propel the boat forward.

This passenger was, of course, Li Zhouwei.

Back then, Li Zhouwei had ambushed and killed Situ Mo, seizing his Dharma Artifact. He was pursued to the borders of the Myriad Radiance region, where, in full view of numerous Changxiao Gate cultivators, he slew Yunan Zi and escaped into the Sword Gate’s territory.

The Sword Gate dispatched a main lineage disciple, Cheng Xuhua, to greet him and invited him to rest in the local prefecture. But there was no decree from the Purple Mansion Realm, no heavyweight figures appeared, and they certainly did not invite Li Zhouwei into their mountain stronghold. He understood immediately: the Sword Gate desperately wanted no part of this conflict and was acting purely out of basic courtesy.

Although Cheng Xuhua was clearly stunned by Li Zhouwei's actions and remained perfectly polite, the courtyard they offered him did not even contain a cup of tea. Li Zhouwei wasted no time. He hastily packed and used a golden talisman to escape to the Eastern Sea.

Everyone knew the Changxiao Gate and the Hengzhu Dao did not get along, so he absolutely could not flee toward Hengzhu. Furthermore, Changxiao’s Lightboat Reefs and the Hengzhu’s Suzhù Reefs are situated extremely close to one another. Li Zhouwei feared, one, that someone might be waiting to ambush him midway, and two, he himself had never intended to throw his lot in with the Hengzhu Dao. Thus, he chose the opposite path, traveling straight into the heart of the Hetian Sea.

Traveling day and night, he reached the Beihai Sea. He selected a remote location to remotely pay his respects to Li Chenghui, then immediately entered seclusion to heal his wounds and refine his cultivation. Having made significant progress, he only emerged in the last few days.

He was at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. He had *just* broken through right before he was forced to fight his way out from the suppression of numerous Changxiao cultivators and their Dharma Artifacts. The ordeal had severely destabilized his foundation. He consumed a medicinal pill to stabilize his cultivation base, estimating that after a year or so of consolidation, his cultivation would be perfected, and he could begin practicing his secret arts.

Only now, however, did he finally have a moment to truly sit and process everything. He sighed softly.

'I originally assumed that with Wang Fu dead, even though Changxiao bears extreme malice toward the "Son of Destiny" and wants to plot against our family, they would at least adhere to the basic rules. It should have been a long-term strategic game. I never, ever expected that old bastard to be so decisively vicious.'

Regarding the Li family's strategic maneuvering at the Purple Mansion Realm level, he was the most informed person aside from Li Ximing himself. This incident appeared to have been triggered by Profound Peak, but in reality, it was a meticulous, long-brewing plot by Changxiao. They simply hadn't anticipated that Changxiao's determination had reached such lengths. That Purple Mansion formation over the lake was not the work of a single day. Li Ximing was bound to expose his movements in the Eastern Sea eventually. Even if the Profound Peak incident hadn't happened, Changxiao would have manufactured another pretext.

Now that he had calmed down, he sorted through the clues. 'Changxiao’s scheme didn’t begin the moment the Daoist Master broke through. It likely started much earlier, with Yehui and Changxiao planning to boil the frog—a scheme to kill me while maintaining their reputation. But then the Daoist Master broke through abruptly. Yehui immediately tried to pull out, forcing Changxiao to abandon that plan and move directly to assassinate the Daoist Master instead…'

With no news regarding either Changxiao or Li Ximing, Li Zhouwei had no intention of leaving the Beihai Sea. He had chosen this location with extreme care.

This Beihai Dragon King was the son of Dongfang You. Not only was he powerful and deeply favored, but most critically, this Dragon King was the master of the White Dragon lineage and the father of Dingjiao—the Dragon Prince of the Clear Seas and Serene Pools, Inheritor of the Azure.

Years ago, Li Zhouwei had accepted a request from Dingjiao and helped facilitate the 'fox-dragon affair.' The White Dragon lineage certainly hadn't acted without reason. Setting aside friendship and face, Li Zhouwei possessed something that the White Dragon lineage coveted. This was, therefore, the safest place he could possibly be.

'If I had fled south, who knows if the Hengzhu Dao would have used me to escalate their feud with the Changxiao Gate. I would just be placing myself in someone else's hands. Changxiao’s methods are bizarre; the Hengzhu Dao’s protection is simply not as reliable as the dragons’ authority.'

'The Hengzhu Dao conflicts with both the Golden Feather Sect and the Azure Pond Sect; they are separate factions. The Daoist Master mentioned this when he visited Daoist Master Yuanxiu. I cannot go there lightly. Conversely, the moment I entered the Beihai Sea, the dragon lineage almost certainly knew. I might even get an opportunity to meet the King.'

Therefore, he had subdued several local demons along the way to serve as his attendants. Li Zhouwei silently took stock. "I killed Situ Mo and seized his Dharma Artifacts... that man’s personal fortune was quite substantial. It’s just a pity I couldn’t grab Yunan Zi’s belongings. I was too worried about divination tracking… otherwise, adding that old man’s wealth, it would have been a true windfall."

But Situ Mo had been ordered around by various Purple Mansions; it was hard to say if his belongings were 'clean.' Left in a storage bag, they were fine. Taking them out was another matter.

Furthermore, his own Immortal Foundation possessed an extremely powerful ability to suppress and seize Dharma Artifacts, and he had stolen quite a few from the Changxiao Gate. Naturally, he couldn't use any of them himself. He had used the Immortal Mirror to inspect his haul; one Water Mansion gourd artifact still had the residue of a tracking formation carved into its inner wall. It was a ticking time bomb. He didn't dare remove it, planning instead to exchange the entire tainted lot while he was in the Beihai Sea.

He summoned one of the demons. The demons of the Beihai Sea were generally more knowledgeable and cunning than those of the Southern Borderlands. But having eaten men, their temperaments were all the same: they respected strength, not diplomacy, fearing power, not virtue.

He forced the demon to kneel and demanded, "What kind of place is this Changliu Gorge? Is there a market for spiritual items?"

The demon appeared to be some kind of fish creature, dripping slime onto the deck. It scrambled to reply, "Reporting to the Great King! At Changliu Gorge, there is a Changliu Mountain. At the foot of this mountain, there is indeed a market! A Purple Mansion Daoist Master lives on the mountain; I hear she is called Daoist Master Xiang Chun. Her temperament is excellent! She treats demons and immortals as equals, and she is a good friend of the Beihai Dragon King! It is rare for us demons in Beihai to have such a market…"

"Oh? Such a place exists..." Li Zhouwei was beginning to understand. He nodded. "No wonder you lot have some semblance of worldliness and have all cobbled together partial human forms. It turns out you have a market where you can learn such things."

These Qi Refining demons could not, of course, achieve a true human transformation; they had merely practiced some minor techniques to appear as half-human lackeys. Proud demons with purer bloodlines would never stoop to such arts.

"Then head to the market," Li Zhouwei commanded.

The demons began to row. Li Zhouwei was already calculating the situation. 'Daoist Master Xiang Chun... Her mountain is here in Beihai, bordering the Yinzhou continent, and she is close with the Dragon King. Her stance and identity need no further explanation. I recall the Daoist Master mentioning her once. No wonder she’s such an accommodating figure. So this is Changliu Mountain. Perhaps… perhaps I can inquire about the news here.'

He sat cross-legged on the boat, closing his eyes to cultivate. After some time, he heard a commotion outside. His spiritual sense immediately swept outward.

Several demons dressed in azure robes stood before his boat. He heard the trembling, timid voice of the toad demon from the bow. "My lords… my lords, please, hold on! The one in this boat is also a Great King! I cannot afford to slight either side! If this one becomes angry, you all… you might not fare so well. Please, reconsider!"

The lead azure-robed demon had two long ribbons tied about its neck. It had a high nose and bulging eyes—a domineering visage—yet its tone was not arrogant. It bowed slightly. "Daoist friend, you misunderstand. Please, just announce our presence. We have come under orders to request an audience with the Great King."

The toad demon was a natural coward; speaking that one sentence of warning had already taken all its courage. It didn't bother arguing further, simply stumbling back to make the report. The azure-robed demon followed. Li Zhouwei, already grasping the situation, lifted the cabin curtain.

His golden pupils swept over them, causing the lead demon to shudder involuntarily. "Who is your master?" Li Zhouwei asked casually.

The azure-robed demon immediately bowed low, speaking with profound respect. "Reporting to the Great King, my master is the The Water-Parting Dragon King of the Boundless Sea's Primal Serenity. His fief is here in the Beihai Sea. He is currently resting upon Changliu Mountain and wishes to invite the Great King to join him."
