# Chapter 664: The Jiangque Generation Receives a Talisman

"About two hours? For your child?" Guest Elder Hu chuckled, inwardly mocking the man’s ignorance of cultivation. "Ha! Do you think she's the clan heir or a prodigy like An Jingming?"

He suppressed his laughter and adopted a more serious tone. "I'll ask you just one thing. From the moment you gave her the cultivation manual to the moment she claimed to have produced her first wisp of spiritual energy, how much time passed?"

Li Baotuo paused, thinking for a moment before answering, "Honored elder, it was two days and one night."

"Two days and a night!"

At this, Li Chengzhi, who had been listening quietly, finally sat up straight, a flicker of surprise in his eyes. "Though Lijing is the ancestral seat of a prominent family, its spirit vein ranks among the lowest of the nine prefectures," he murmured. To achieve that in two days and a night… that's quite a high aptitude!"

He left the rest unsaid, but a thought sparked in his mind. 'If she had enough resources, she might have a shot at being selected to return to the main island in five years. And if Li Baotuo can raise a disciple of the main sect… that would be a solid connection for me on the island!'

As Li Chengzhi’s mind raced with possibilities, Hu Jingye was just as quick on the uptake, already thinking of his own son. "Oh?" he said, his voice now carefully neutral. "Her talent is acceptable."

Hu Jingye was a mere Qi Refinement cultivator, but his young son showed some promise. If Li Shuwan could become a cultivator of the main sect, it would be an incredible boon for him. He adopted a stately posture. "It's difficult for your daughter to return to the island, but her talent is quite good for the surrounding prefectures…"

His tone had softened considerably, but fearing Li Baotuo would see his intentions, he kept his expression stern. "Chengzhi is here, so we're all family. I won't mince words. When Shuwan's talent is reported, the clan will provide corresponding resources and techniques… but there's still a gap to overcome to return to the island. I can help bridge that gap… It will all depend on her effort."

He maintained his dignified air, the shift in his attitude mostly seamless. But Li Baotuo had received some education in his youth and had seen much of the world from his ferry on the river. He understood immediately.

'Damn it, the old fox changed his tune fast,' he thought. 'My Shuwan's talent must be truly high. What an act.'

Outwardly, he simply beamed, the picture of a simple, honest farmer. He nodded and agreed with a series of smiles but gave no concrete answer. Seeing him play dumb, Hu Jingye didn't shy away and stated his purpose directly.

"My youngest son is eight this year and also has decent talent. If you wouldn't mind, Baotuo, do me this favor and let's arrange a childhood betrothal. I have some savings that can support Shuwan's cultivation, and I will personally see to it that your family returns to the island."

He was, after all, a Qi Refinement cultivator. Before him, the other two were no more than ants. For him to lower himself like this put both Li Chengzhi and Li Baotuo in an awkward position.

Li Baotuo glanced at Li Chengzhi, who grimaced in frustration. The terms weren't exactly predatory, so it was difficult for him to object. He hesitated, taking a sip of tea. The clan rules were strict, and the direct line feared nothing more than being accused of "bullying others with power." Li Chengzhi was always polite to everyone, and his relationship with Hu Jingye depended entirely on the elder giving him face—face as thin as paper. He couldn't risk tearing it.

Seeing no help from his clan uncle, Li Baotuo resorted to stalling tactics. "I… I know nothing about this 'returning to the island'… I fear wasting your lordship's resources. How could I agree so rashly? My daughter is still playful and young, I'm afraid she might…"

"What are you saying, Baotuo!" Hu Jingye frowned. "My Hu family may not be one of the old Four Surnames, but we have a reputation in Wutu Prefecture. When I say I will provide resources, I will. You needn't worry."

Seeing Li Baotuo lower his head, he took a step back. "I'm not trying to pressure you. We can settle this for now. If things change in the future, if Shuwan has other ideas… it's only an engagement. At worst, we can dissolve it. The friendship between our families will remain, won't it? By then, Shuwan will be a disciple of the main sect. Do you think she'll have trouble breaking off a minor engagement?"

'This is bad!'

As he spoke, Li Chengzhi saw a flicker of consideration in Li Baotuo's eyes. His heart sank.

'It's not that simple!'

As a disciple of the main sect himself, Li Chengzhi knew how strict the Clan Justice Hall was. If Li Shuwan were to break the engagement later, she would be in the wrong. It would reflect poorly on her and greatly affect the Hu family. Her reputation would suffer, and word might even reach Qingdu Peak… Who knew what the elders would think upon hearing of such a thing!

Li Baotuo remained silent. Li Chengzhi couldn't sit still any longer. He averted his gaze, frowning at a distant corner of the room to signal his disapproval.

"My lord… my family is truly unworthy of such an honor!"

Whether he understood the signal or had never intended to agree, Li Baotuo finally sighed and shook his head, making his decision clear. The words struck Li Chengzhi with a mix of shock and relief, while the smile vanished from Guest Elder Hu's face. For a long moment, there was silence.

The rejection was a resounding slap in the face. Hu Jingye could no longer maintain his composure. His expression darkened, and he shot to his feet.

"You invited me here to see your daughter, and now that I have, you treat me with contempt! Is this how you conduct yourself? It’s completely unreasonable!" he boomed. "I, Hu Jingye, have cultivated for years between Wutu and Lijing. Who doesn't give me some measure of respect? Li Baotuo, you are utterly insolent!"

Li Baotuo had not expected such a sharp tongue. Flustered, he scrambled to his feet. "I invited you to see my daughter, my lord, but I never imagined you would demand a marriage arrangement on the spot! I may be a mortal, but I love my daughter… I know nothing of your honorable son. How could I be so rash as to agree? What parent doesn't fear their child might be thrown into a pit of fire!"

In his haste, he misspoke. Hu Jingye erupted in fury. "Are you insulting my Hu family's upbringing, boy!"

As a Qi Refinement cultivator, his anger manifested physically. His shout was like a crack of thunder, shaking dust from the rafters that rained down on them. Li Baotuo's sons, standing outside, could only watch, their faces tight with anger they dared not voice.

"How dare you!"

Li Chengzhi and Li Baotuo were pinned in place by his spiritual pressure, unable to move. Hu Jingye flung his sleeves back and stormed out of the house. Li Baotuo's legs trembled violently, and his wife crumpled by the doorway in despair, too frightened to move.

Seeing the terror he had caused finally soothed Hu Jingye's bruised ego and blazing anger. He paused at the threshold, his back to them. Li Chengzhi leaped from his seat. "Are you mad! What are you saying!"

He grabbed Li Baotuo, who stumbled and scrambled out of the house. Seeing that Hu Jingye hadn't yet flown away, Li Chengzhi knew the man was still posturing, using threats to get his way. He gathered his robes and hurried out. "Guest Elder Hu! He didn't mean it!"

Li Baotuo, who had never experienced anything like this, was truly terrified. He practically crawled outside, his breath coming in ragged gasps, his vision swimming. Just then, a clear, crisp voice floated down from the air.

"My, what authority, Lord Hu."

The cold, sarcastic tone nearly scared the life out of Li Baotuo. He forced his stiff legs to stand and saw a woman at his doorstep, holding his precious daughter by the hand.

His mind went blank. The woman was an immortal, clad in feathered robes of azure and white. Her hair was black as ink, adorned with a single white flower, and her eyes held a misty, violet hue. Before he could see more, he heard a soft thud.

*Thump!*

His clan uncle, Li Chengzhi, whose composure had been unshakable until now, looked as if his face had shattered like a dropped vase. An expression of infinite horror spread across it. His legs gave out as if the bones had been pulled from them, and his head hit the ground with a dull crack, bumping into Li Baotuo's waist and sending them both tumbling.

The world spun. Li Baotuo saw his clan uncle leap past him like a frog and prostrate himself again, crying out, "Chengzhi pays his respects to the Elder!"

A moment later, Li Baotuo caught sight of Hu Jingye’s face. The old man’s blustering rage was gone, replaced by a vacant confusion as he collapsed to the ground like a pile of mud.

Guest Elder Hu had, of course, seen Li Qinghong before.

He had been watching from the shore when she triggered the formation's lightning to open the island in the lake, doubting he could even survive a single bolt from her. He never imagined he would have any interaction with such an exalted figure, let alone be the target of a phrase like, "My, what authority, Lord Hu."

The words struck him like a bolt of white lightning, leaving him utterly terrified and losing control of his senses. His mind felt shattered as he lay paralyzed on the ground.

But Li Qinghong didn't spare him a single glance. Her eyes fell on the sweating Li Chengzhi, and after a moment's thought, she spoke softly. "Chengzhi?"

"This junior's father is Lord Ximing," Li Chengzhi replied respectfully.

"Ah, so you are Ming'er's son."

Li Qinghong's casual use of the familiar name "Ming'er" was what truly terrified Li Baotuo. He pressed his forehead to the ground, his vision blurring. He finally believed it—this was the woman who commanded the lightning over Qingdu Peak. Her next words were delivered with a light, almost casual air.

"I was merely passing by and happened upon quite a show."

Hu Jingye had recovered enough to speak, though his lips trembled and his face was ashen. "Elder… Elder, it's a misunderstanding."

'He's lucky it was me who came,' Li Qinghong thought. 'Great Uncle dotes on the clan members the most. If he had been here, this man named Hu would have been decapitated by now.'

Her voice was light and melodic. "I found this child endearing and spoke with her for a moment, and you were already planning her marriage to your son. Hu Jingye, you truly have a talent for scheming. Do you dare to meddle in the marriage affairs of our main sect?"

She paused, her voice taking on a dangerous edge. "Perhaps the clan's Justice Hall has been too strict… so much so that you think our direct line are all spineless weaklings? Hmm?"

"E-El… Elder!"

The softer her voice became, the more palpable her rage was to Hu Jingye. Li Qinghong was known for her good temper; no one in the Li family had ever truly angered her. Hu Jingye was the first, and he was paralyzed with fear.

He stammered, unable to form a coherent sentence, his eyes rolling back as if he were about to faint. With a flick of her finger, Li Qinghong sealed his cultivation base. "Chengzhi," she said calmly, "send him to Chenghuai."

Li Chengzhi scrambled to call men over to carry Hu Jingye away.

"Baotuo's branch has been away from the clan for many years," Li Qinghong continued. "My Great Uncle has missed them dearly. Bring them all to see him."

Li Chengzhi bowed deeply in assent. As Li Qinghong held the young girl and vanished in a flash of lightning, Li Baotuo remained kneeling. On the ground, Hu Jingye lay with cold limbs, staring blankly at the sky.

"Congratulations, Baotuo!"

As if he hadn't seen Hu Jingye at all, Li Chengzhi stepped over him and smiled as he helped Li Baotuo to his feet. Streaks of light began to descend from the sky, one after another, and Li Baotuo, feeling as if he were in a dream, vaguely heard a chorus of congratulations.

***

On Pingya Island.

When Li Shuwan landed on the peak, her face was a little pale. She had heard stories of the Great Lake since she was a child, but she never knew Moongaze Lake was so vast. They had crossed its endless waves in an instant, arriving on the island in the blink of an eye.

She had never seen such a palace before. Before she could take in the details, she saw an old man sitting in the main hall. Seven points of azure light glowed on his body, and he had a kind, benevolent air. He approached with a warm smile. "Ah, Wan'er has arrived."

Li Shuwan responded politely. She noticed a youth standing on the other side of the hall, clad in dark red robes threaded with gold. He was turned sideways to her, and when sunlight spilled over him, the sight was so brilliant it made her eyes sting and water.

Li Xuanxuan assumed she was frightened and soothed her with a few gentle words. Li Qinghong sighed softly and recounted the events she had witnessed. "Uncle, the clan's rules are, in the end, a bit too strict. The main sect disciples are fine on the island, but the minor branches in the prefectures often suffer greatly."

Li Zhouwei looked thoughtfully at the girl before raising his head to reply, "Uncle-Master has mentioned this matter before. But the rules are like a binding hoop; they cannot be easily loosened. Li Baotuo is from a minor branch, but if not for that status, how could he have even summoned Hu Jingye? Would others have had a chance to even speak to the man? They receive certain privileges, so they must accept certain restrictions. It prevents them from oppressing others."

Li Xuanxuan placed a book scroll in Li Shuwan's hands and gently guided her to a side hall to memorize it. In his heart, he sympathized with his clan members and tended to agree with Li Qinghong, so he remained silent.

Li Zhouwei continued gravely, "The gap between cultivation realms is insurmountable. If we relax the rules here, they might not be bullied by other cultivators, but they will be more inclined to oppress other mortals. This would create another level of hierarchy among mortals, which would not be a good thing."

Li Qinghong nodded. "I will leave it to your judgment. Our family has always strived for fairness. Inevitably, some will feel wronged, but we shouldn't let our disciples become disheartened. My actions today were also intended to invigorate the various branches, which is why I was somewhat severe."

Their discussion came to a close just as Li Shuwan returned from the side hall. "Seniors," she said in a small voice, "I have memorized it."

"So quickly!" Li Xuanxuan smiled and nodded. The selection criteria for the Talisman Seed were becoming more and more stringent, and the children chosen were increasingly exceptional. He tested her with a few questions, and she answered them all correctly.

Li Zhouwei turned to an attendant. "Please invite the Young Master."

Li Jiangqian soon arrived in the hall. The boy greeted all three elders warmly before turning to call Li Shuwan "little sister." Li Qinghong smiled and brought out the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, and the two children began to recite the incantation.

Li Zhouwei's gaze remained on Li Shuwan. As the two children sat cross-legged to receive the Talisman Seed, he took a step forward, the dark red and gold threads of his robes shimmering faintly. "This child's soul seems… unusual," he murmured. "She seems able to perceive the secrets of others."

"Mm," Li Qinghong agreed, having noticed it as well.

The three of them waited with bated breath. After a full night had passed, a point of light bloomed within the screen. The two children opened their eyes at the same time, both wearing expressions of wonder.

Li Jiangqian's face showed more comprehension. He clapped his hands, stood up, and bowed. "I have received the talisman. Thank you, elders, for your protection!"

Li Shuwan, however, was filled with shock and curiosity. She watched her new "brother" bow and quickly followed suit. But when she lifted her head, she found all four of them staring at her, stunned.

Li Qinghong shot to her feet. On the girl's brow, a point of orange brilliance was slowly emerging. It was shaped like a flower petal, large as a pearl, and pulsed with a clear, bright light. It flashed three times before slowly fading away.
