# Chapter 1009: The Honored Position

‘I fear this is related to the old provincial boundaries…’

Li Ximing recalled when he first achieved the Purple Mansion Realm. The envoys who had visited him on the lake were Zhang Gui and Wang Long. The most distinguished purple-gold book they carried recorded their title: Envoy of the Five Directions for the Two Provinces of Jiao and Yang.

‘Zhang Gui and Wang Long must be Judge Yang’s men.’

He once had his doubts, but the matter had since become clear. When Li Ximing had his breakthrough, the Azure Pond was already in rapid decline. The Yang Clan, knowing the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition was fated to wane, must have worried that an unchecked Li Clan would eventually harm their interests.

By having those two envoys deliver the news that the Yang Clan also possessed a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, Judge Yang accomplished two things. First, he stabilized the relationship between their families. Second, he preempted any potential future conflicts.

Beyond that, after a century in Jiangnan, the Li Clan had gathered a significant amount of intelligence. Another name was invariably linked to this Judge, Yang Jinxin.

The Zhenan Department.

According to hushed rumors, Judge Yang was the master of the Zhenan Department, responsible for handling the strange phenomena and residual Metallic Essence left behind when Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan fell. In the words of the rumors, he ‘presided over all matters of Metallic Essence related to divine abilities.’

‘I have no idea what rank a Department holds within the Underworld’s hierarchy, or what role it plays… but one thing is certain: it is a position of real power. Jiangnan is nothing more than a piece on their board.’

Regardless, the Yang Clan was far from a simple power. They certainly could not be described as ‘weak.’

“Your noble clan is descended from emperors, the most preeminent in all of Jiangnan. We could never hope to match you. And now, with the matter of seeking the truth… Daoist Friend, you are far too modest…”

Yang Ruiyi let out a hearty laugh before his expression turned serious. “To call us imperial descendants is an overstatement. There are few who could claim such a title in your presence, Daoist Friend.”

He spoke with genuine sincerity. Whatever Li Zhouwei’s current circumstances, given time, he was destined to become one of the world’s foremost masters of divine abilities. With Qilin blood flowing through his veins, no one could claim to be an imperial scion before him—unless, perhaps, the Zhaowu Emperor were resurrected, or the Zhao Son of Heaven in the imperial palace received a special blessing from the Fuqi Clan.

After the exchange of pleasantries, the old man who had been sitting quietly by the window vanished. Both Yang Ruiyi and Li Zhouwei heaved a deep, inward sigh of relief. The tense, rigid atmosphere immediately softened.

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, seizing the opportunity to ask thoughtfully, “I have heard… that the esteemed personage backing your clan is a figure from the Zhenan Department. I wonder, what kind of celestial department might that be?”

Yang Ruiyi’s attention had clearly been fixed on the old man. Despite being the host, he had been even more nervous than Li Zhouwei, terrified of misspeaking. With the old man gone, he seemed to come back to life. His tone relaxed as he leaned back in the host’s seat and smiled.

“My lord’s official post is not here, but in the Celestial Hall. Positions in the Hall are often titular, without active duties. He holds his post in the department concurrently as his active assignment, which is why the world has a name to call him by.”

He lifted his chin slightly and added casually, “After all, the Hall exists in the abyssal depths of the Underworld. One doesn’t typically use those Underworld titles.”

The terrifying image of the old man’s true form was seared into Li Zhouwei’s memory, though he dared not dwell on it. He simply nodded in understanding. Yang Ruiyi, however, said no more on the topic, offering only a perfunctory explanation. “The Zhenan Department has a long history. It was once responsible for this entire region. In these times of lapsed discipline, many departments have faded into obscurity, and their duties have been streamlined and absorbed by the Zhenan Department. Whether it’s the Northern River Department or the Ridge Pass Department, none can match the authority of Zhenan…”

Li Zhouwei could tell his words were insincere and that he was holding something back, so he simply remarked, “Truly a great figure of the Underworld!”

Yang Ruiyi smiled and swiftly changed the subject. “Since the White Qilin has graced us with his presence, I won’t waste time with pleasantries. The higher-ups value you greatly, Daoist Friend. They call you the nation’s greatest pillar. Your clan has also shown admirable prudence, which has earned their favor… The most important matter today is to settle this affair.”

Li Zhouwei looked at him, waiting.

Yang Ruiyi sighed. “If, for the sake of the Underworld, you are willing to lend your strength to our dynasty… the Yang Clan will naturally offer compensation!”

Li Zhouwei took a sip of tea, the answer already clear in his mind. “You want us to become subjects?”

For a moment, Yang Ruiyi was silent.

This was no simple matter. For the Chen Clan or the Lingu clan, bowing to the Yang Clan was inevitable; they had no standing to negotiate. The Li Clan was in a similar position. The compensation Yang Ruiyi mentioned was for Li Zhouwei personally.

Li Zhouwei cultivated the Bright Yang, an unyielding Daoist Tradition. This was less of a concern for ordinary practitioners, but as a favored son of the Bright Yang, his destiny was extraordinary. Since his birth, the Li Clan had forgone his given name, calling him ‘Young Lord’ and permitting him to abstain from bowing and kneeling, all to preserve the integrity of his fate.

Now, with his mind set on attaining Fruition, to serve another as a subject, while seemingly trivial, would undoubtedly hinder his attempt to reach that state.

‘Li Zhouwei is, after all, a child of the Bright Yang. Even if he swallows his pride while in a subordinate position, his ambition will remain. He will certainly seize the opportunity presented by the world’s current state to strive for Fruition Attainment.’

To sever another’s path in cultivation was an offense that created blood feuds. Obstructing someone’s pursuit of the golden core or placing stumbling blocks on their path to Fruition Attainment was an act that bred immense hatred. How could Yang Ruiyi not be cautious?

‘What’s more, my clan stands to gain from this.’

The same principle applied to Yang Zhuo’s faction. Li Zhouwei’s status and destiny were unique. If he were to bow to Yang Zhuo, it would not only be a great boon to the new dynasty the Yangs were establishing, but it would also elevate Yang Zhuo’s own destiny.

Aware of these concerns, Yang Ruiyi carefully watched his expression. But Li Zhouwei remained silent, his golden eyes fixed on him, seemingly waiting for him to continue.

Their gazes met for only a brief moment before Yang Ruiyi smiled and explained,

“The White Qilin need not worry. We will fully support your endeavor to reach the True Monarch realm. This matter is not so severe… We will do everything in our power to minimize the impact.”

“After all… the new dynasty will not govern harshly. The Chen and Lingu Clans are to be vassal lords. They will be granted titles of nobility and retain their county lands as fiefdoms. Though they must obey our summons, their fiefs will remain self-governing. And for the Li Clan… the terms will be even more lenient.”

He beamed. “We will do our utmost to preserve your status and ensure the White Qilin is satisfied!”

Li Zhouwei was not surprised. In truth, neither the Yang Clan nor the Li Clan was. This matter was non-negotiable. The fact that three generations of Li clansmen—Li Xizhi, Zhouluo, and Li Jiangliang—had been drawn into this scheme was a clear signal.

‘The Li Clan must be a part of the Yang Clan’s grand design. The subtle protection and aid they offered my predecessors were calculated moves, each with a price tag. Whether the price is fair or not, whether the Li Clan is willing or not, the time has come to pay.’

His words also revealed another truth: the Underworld’s position on Li Qianyuan was similar to Luoxia’s. A dead, or at least half-dead, Li Qianyuan was what the Underworld wished to see. Hence the offer of ‘full support.’

‘This is why Luoxia has never cared. The Li Clan exists within the Underworld’s domain, so even if Luoxia did nothing, the Underworld would naturally keep watch… They are in no rush to break my destiny… in fact, they seem intent on helping me fulfill it.’

‘The attitude of the world’s foremost powers… this final piece of the puzzle has fallen into place. This father of mine, this Monarch of Bright Yang… has united Luoxia and the Underworld against him, with the Dragon-kin reluctantly playing along…’

He remembered when Qingyu Qian had invited him to the mountains and personally explained the Wei-Li affair, saying that Li Qianyuan had irreconcilable conflicts with half of the world’s Daoist Traditions. Looking back now, ‘half’ seemed a conservative estimate beyond measure. Perhaps the remaining traditions weren’t in irreconcilable conflict, but they surely did not wish to see him succeed…

Li Zhouwei’s golden eyes watched him quietly. “The Li Clan is indebted to the honorable predecessors of the celestial authorities,” he said softly. “We will naturally do our part.”

Yang Ruiyi smiled faintly. “There is one other matter… concerning the Great Virtue Golden Lotus.”

“The Great Virtue Golden Lotus…” Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. “Has Lord Yang not retaken Quanwu? Is this something he cannot resolve?”

A trace of helplessness crossed Yang Ruiyi’s face. “The Great Virtue Golden Lotus itself is not the problem. The trouble lies with the countless cultivators and commoners affected by it, who are spread throughout Lixia and Quanwu. If the lotuses are destroyed, I fear a million corpses will pave the ground.”

Li Zhouwei was inwardly skeptical but feigned a look of sudden realization, nodding slowly as Yang Ruiyi continued, shaking his head. “Fortunately, my lord is a being of divine birth and has miraculous methods at his disposal. The gentlest and most convenient solution is to seal the Great Virtue Golden Lotus and neutralize its influence. It will dissipate on its own within eight or ten years.”

“We have all the lotuses under observation, except for… two of them in the Wilderness. Those are proving difficult to handle.”

Li Zhouwei understood immediately. Yang Ruiyi was talking about the _Great Virtue Golden Lotus_, but he was really talking about the handover and division of the Wilderness. He set down his cup. “What is your clan’s position on this?”

Yang Ruiyi said simply, “My lord’s intention… is for the Wilderness to remain in our hands for the time being. Once everything is settled, it will be delivered to your clan through other means.”

The personnel losses in the Wilderness had been far less than anticipated, but the _Great Virtue Golden Lotus_ had already poisoned the land. Furthermore, it was an artifact from the Buddhist Land and was difficult to deal with. If the Li Clan took it now, they would have no way to handle it for some time. Entrusting it to the Yang Clan would save them a great deal of trouble.

‘“Other means” can only mean enfeoffment or a royal grant…’

Li Zhouwei nodded. “We will have to trouble your clan, then.”

Yang Ruiyi smiled. “It is no trouble at all. I should be the one thanking your clan for your trust.”

With the major issues settled, Li Zhouwei’s expression finally turned serious.

“My clan still has two members to consider… one is my younger clan-brother, Zhouluo, who received a reward from your lord. The other is my elder, Li Yuanqin, who cultivates at the Azure Pond… How does your clan intend to handle them?”

Li Xuanxuan had long pondered this, and now that Li Zhouwei was face-to-face with Yang Ruiyi, he had to ask for details.

Yang Ruiyi gave him a surprised look, his smile vanishing. “Zhouluo… has Yang blood, after all. He will be safe with our Yang Clan, and we need not worry about anyone using him to manipulate relations between our two families. This is what is best for him, and for both of us.”

Li Zhouwei gave him a heavy look. Yang Ruiyi added with a smile, “But… there’s no need to settle it here. Once the new dynasty is established, he will have the freedom to choose. We need only wait.”

He seemed very confident as he met Li Zhouwei’s gaze. “As for Li Yuanqin… the Ning Clan will be garrisoning Yi Mountain City and the Southern Borderlands on my lord’s behalf. This is Ning Wan’s reward. If the Li Clan truly has need of him, you need only ask the Ning Clan. I am certain Ning Wan will not refuse.”

“However…” He chuckled. “In my view… now that a branch of your family has finally made its way out, it might be a good thing for them not to return to the lake.”

Li Zhouwei watched him thoughtfully. ‘A reward… so Ning Wan still has leverage…’

Since both men were acting in the interests of their respective clans, there was little more to discuss. Yang Ruiyi raised his teacup, signaling the end of the meeting.

“Daoist Friend, you need only wait. It will be a matter of a few years. On the day the stars appear in the heavens, shining without cease, turning night into day—that will be the day the Feng Wu nation is founded. Golden chariots and jade carriages will come to the lake to confer upon you an honored position!”

With that, he personally rose from his seat to see the golden-eyed young man out, taking a step forward to push open the pavilion door himself.

_Creak._

The gentle morning light spilled into the room, illuminating the stone steps one by one. A cool wind blew, but a figure was already waiting outside.

The man was handsome, with flashing golden eyes. He wore a long robe with a swirling cloud pattern, covered by a brocade robe with motifs of paired beasts—a remarkably elegant attire that gave him the air of a scholar-general.

The moment the door opened, he bowed deeply. “Greetings, my lord… Greetings… Father!”

Li Zhouwei stood at the entrance, bathed in the brilliant sunlight, his hands clasped behind his back. Yang Ruiyi’s laughter echoed outside the pavilion. “The Fourth Young Master’s immortal merits are outstanding. My lord has mentioned him often. Truly, like father, like son!”

Li Jiangliang remained bowed before the pavilion, his expression unmoved by the praise. He waited cautiously until he heard his father’s voice. “Daoist Friend, you flatter him.”

With a complex feeling in his heart, Li Jiangliang lifted his head slightly and moved to the side, seeing only two sets of robes appear before him. The man in black smiled. “I will not intrude any longer.”

His figure vanished in an instant, wiped clean from existence as if he had never been there, leaving only the golden-eyed young man standing silently in his place. Li Jiangliang raised his gaze a few more inches. “Father.”

“Walk with me.”

“Yes.”

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow and began to stroll along the corridor connecting the pavilions. Li Jiangliang followed in his footsteps.

“What are your duties in the court?” Li Zhouwei asked. “What position do you hold?”

Li Jiangliang answered quickly, “Your son is currently formulating the rites for the new dynasty. Once the great affair is settled, I expect to be managing matters of the people’s livelihood.”

Li Zhouwei stopped and turned to study him for a moment. “You are quite different from your brothers. Cui Jueyin taught you for over a decade, and you took it all to heart. You have not disgraced our family’s teachings.”

Li Jiangliang had never expected such words from his father. He was stunned for a moment, and only after a few silent breaths did it sink in. “Father… Thank you, Father.”

Li Zhouwei turned to look at the clouds beyond the corridor, resting a hand on the white stone railing. “That day, when your eldest brother returned from the Mushroom Forest Plains, I heard what you said,” he stated calmly. “You said you would rather die than touch a single thing belonging to the family…”

Li Jiangliang stood beside him, a complicated expression on his face as he looked into his father’s golden eyes.

But his father’s tone softened. “In truth, you know it doesn’t matter whether you use the family’s power or not. The day you are truly helpless and must use it, it will be an unavoidable necessity. There is no need for such a venomous oath…”

Li Jiangliang lowered his gaze and suddenly fell to his knees. But Li Zhouwei’s voice grew distant, fading until it echoed only in his mind.

‘Staying by the Yang Clan’s side may offer you more opportunities.’
