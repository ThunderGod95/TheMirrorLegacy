# Chapter 1073: Manifestation

The Mausoleum of Turbid Slaughter was a grim landscape of skeletal remains, littered with broken restriction fields. The temples, built around the gaps in the mausoleum grounds, were in utter disarray. Shaken by the tremors that rocked the heavens and the earth, they had collapsed one after another, leaving a scene of total ruin.

Li Ximing traveled through the Great Void as a streak of light. The wounds on his skin still throbbed with a dull ache. He touched a wisp of the lingering golden light, sensing it carefully.

'It seems to be some kind of Metal Malice blended into Treasure Light and tempered with fire... He was an immortal cultivator, after all. This technique certainly has some power.'

The pagoda had crushed him badly, and the subsequent battles had only worsened his state. These injuries were not light. After long consideration, Li Ximing finally flipped his sleeve and retrieved a pill.

The pill resembled a crystal, solid and smooth, and it flickered with an unsteady white light. It was the Treasured Star Body-Spirit Pill, a relic obtained from the Southern Township Daoist Tradition before the fall of Wanling Heaven!

Li Ximing was usually reluctant to use such a precious pill for these kinds of injuries. Normally, he would just take a Qilin's Radiant Unity Pill and enter a short seclusion to recover. But today, not knowing what other troubles lay ahead, he finally steeled himself and swallowed it in one gulp.

The pill was truly extraordinary. It melted the instant it entered his mouth, releasing a clean, refreshing warm current that surged through him. The pain in his dharma physique quickly subsided as the invading golden fire was scattered and expelled.

'I wonder which branch of the Earth Virtue Dao this belongs to. The effect is simply excellent.'

He let out a breath of relief as he sank his spiritual sense into his sleeve, secretly checking on the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body.

The small statue was now covered in a web of fine, hairline cracks that glowed with a faint golden light, largely matching the injuries on his own dharma physique. But this item was not a divine ability or a true Dharma Body; after enduring so much damage, it had already begun to look dim.

'This thing was extremely effective against many of Vast Cicada's Buddhist cultivators techniques. It provided special resistance, blocking thirty to forty percent of their power, and even mitigated ten to twenty percent of the physical wounds...'

Overall, the injuries Li Ximing had actually sustained were far from severe. They weren't even as bad as the wounds Changxiao had inflicted on him back then—and Changxiao's techniques were far more difficult to heal.

This outcome far exceeded Li Ximing's expectations, and he couldn't help but feel a flicker of joy.

'If not for its exorbitant cost... and its powerlessness against certain special Dao paths, this would be an absolutely fantastic treasure.'

What satisfied him even more was that with the conclusion of his Sealing the Life-Mandate, the connection between this proxy body and his true life-mandate was severed. The top-grade resource held in the statue's mouth was rapidly converting into a rolling, abundant tide of Spiritual Qi, constantly nourishing it!

'The restorative effect of the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance on the Soul-Hearing Mulberry Wood... is simply terrifying.'

Li Ximing even began to suspect that the Spirit-Splitting Alternate Body would be as good as new in less than three days!

'Three days! That's not even enough time for me to cultivate the finger I used for Sealing the Life-Mandate! It'll be over in the blink of an eye!'

For now, he just silently circulated his dharma power and turned to look at Tinglan. He was just about to speak when an earth-shattering explosion roared from the northern horizon. The layers of dark, baleful clouds overhead instantly scattered, and an intense aura of Earth Virtue surged into the heavens!

Both Tinglan and Sima Yuanli's expressions changed. Tinglan showed little surprise, but more a sense of uncertainty. Sima Yuanli, however, was purely astonished. He whispered:

"Manifestations Earth!"

That one phrase instantly put Li Ximing on high alert. Manifestations Earth was the 'She' (Earth) aspect of the twin Sheji Daos—not something to be trifled with. He narrowed his eyes, made a quick calculation, and asked,

"Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain?"

Tinglan nodded slightly and said in a low voice,

"No new orders have come. This must be part of the Lord's plan. We will conquer Xiaoshi first... then go to reinforce!"

The two immediately understood. Sima Yuanli looked somewhat relieved and replied,

"Thank goodness... As we headed north, I was afraid Vast Cicada would see he couldn't return to Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain and set up an ambush for us halfway!"

Li Ximing sighed inwardly. This whole battle had left him deeply unsettled. He gritted his teeth and said,

"I've heard of Mingxiang from the Lotus Temple, and Vija from the former Great Desire Dao... But where did this Vast Cicada get such profound techniques? Just because he's a reincarnated immortal cultivator?"

Tinglan let out a breath and looked at Li Ximing, hesitating.

"Zhaojing misjudged. Because we were on the lake, he wasn't even using his full strength... Now that you've let him return to the north, his divine ability will be even more potent!"

Sima Yuanli sighed heavily. Seeing the unease on Li Ximing's face, he picked up the conversation.

"He is the lord of the Precious Tusk Golden Land and a karmic heir to the Undefeated King of Brightness. He's not someone ordinary Buddhist cultivators can compare to... If Sparrow Carp Fish hadn't gone south and received that great opportunity, he would still be a notch below him!"

Li Ximing had at least heard of the Undefeated King of Brightness. Although records of him in the south were exceedingly rare, he estimated he was also a Dharma Master. He frowned and said,

"The Precious Tusk Golden Land? It seems his is the only one in the world."

But Sima Yuanli shook his head. "Although I don't know much about Buddhist cultivators, I do know that there isn't just one Golden Land. There's an even more famous one, which you might be more familiar with, called the Qin Ling Golden Land. It's been lost for a thousand years. By relying on a lingering connection, it can still support one or two of the Merciful One. Right now, that Merciful One is still researching it, trying to draw water with a bamboo basket—a complete waste of effort."

He seemed somewhat wistful.

"It's no wonder he tries... If one could truly control a Golden Land independently, beholden to no one, it might even be possible to reside above the celestial vault, looking down on all."

Although Sima Yuanli claimed to know little about Buddhist cultivators, given Li Ximing's understanding of him and his frequent communications with the north, he probably knew more details than anyone else present.

Only Tinglan remained silent. The column of Manifestations Earth light erupting in the north seemed to make her very hesitant, even a little absent-minded.

Li Ximing fell silent for a moment, but time didn't permit him to ask more questions. The tremors in the Great Void were growing more distinct. Tinglan had already taken the lead, tearing open the Great Void and suddenly emerging!

The mountain range below was enveloped in a deep golden light. Amidst the rolling hills, a state of panic had broken out among the densely packed temples. Numerous Buddhist cultivators were gathered in groups, whispering anxiously as they stared at the radiance erupting in the distance.

"Who dares invade my Xiaoshi!"

In an instant, white qi streaked through the sky. Streams of light converged, and an enormous, white Golden Body rose up, its expression uncertain and alarmed. Its radiant white brilliance immediately shot into the sky, shaking the Great Void!

Tinglan said nothing. Her face calm, she simply directed the pavilion, which was boiling with purple-gold energy, to descend. Forming a hand seal, she cast her spell, tossing out the small, greyish-white pot in her hand. It immediately rippled with the infamously deadly Immeasurable Water and Fire.

Li Ximing observed for a moment and immediately recognized this Maha.

‘Yanbai!’

The one guarding this place was none other than Yanbai of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm!

This Maha hailed from a Dharma Realm and possessed considerable strength. He had once gone south to attack Lixia and later turned up to provide support on the lake. There was a history of enmity there. Li Ximing immediately formed a hand seal, while Sima Yuanli gave a slight lift of his hand, revealing a scroll in his sleeve. He called out urgently:

"Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain has already been conquered! Daoist Friend Yanbai, if you stubbornly defend this place, you will surely face mortal peril when our reinforcements arrive!"

His words thundered in the Maha's ears. In that same instant, Heavenly Light blazed, Valley Water descended, and purple qi drifted through the air. The Maha was stunned, his heart seizing in terror.

'Three cultivators at the Purple Mansion Realm and two Spiritual Treasures?!'

Whether it was Li Ximing, Tinglan, or Qinghu, he, Yanbai, recognized every single one of them! He also knew of the treasures they wielded and did not underestimate their power in the slightest!

Yanbai wasn't blind; he had seen the anomaly at Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain and had long been feeling uneasy. He had only remained to observe because Mount Dayang's orders this time had been exceptionally strict. Who could have known that this single moment of hesitation would get him surrounded?

If it were just Li Ximing and Qinghu, Yanbai might still have a chance to defend. But with Tinglan added to the mix, wielding both the Immeasurable Water and Fire and the Purple Throne Soothing-Spirit Pavilion... he had no intention of throwing his life away for Mount Dayang!

'Where is Vast Cicada?'

A shadow passed through his eyes.

'That guy truly is unreliable! He only caught the Lord's attention because of his legacy, but I've always thought he was disloyal! Who knows where he's run off to now...'

The enemy cultivators were upon him, leaving no time for further thought. The massive Golden Body trembled, radiating countless shafts of golden-white light. Yanbai was no incompetent fool. The Golden Body continued to swell, and four marks, like lotus seeds, appeared on its smooth forehead.

'The Great Light-Riding Art of the Dharma Realm!'

The earth shook and the mountains trembled. A heavy, jade-white light erupted from the four marks, weaving together to birth countless illusions on the ground below. It was as if a Buddhist Land had manifested, standing in direct opposition to the purple pavilion in the sky, not one bit inferior.

Sima Yuanli couldn't tell if Yanbai truly intended to fight to the death or was planning a retreat. He descended on his divine ability, frowning and gritting his teeth.

'If he really digs in, he won't be easy to take down. But Vast Cicada and the others have probably already reached Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain. Won't this ruin the entire plan?'

In just a few breaths, the cascading purple qi had already clashed with the golden-white dharma physique countless times. Li Ximing hung back behind the other two, silently gathering the Emperor Qi's Light. He smiled inwardly.

'How the tables have turned. It's finally our turn to besiege the Buddhist cultivators!'

But just as this mystical illusion had manifested in the sky, a streak of crimson radiance swept across it. It was like a sun falling into the sea, exploding in a golden storm. The white giant was caught completely off guard and let out a long, mournful wail.

"Aooo..."

Only then did they see the sky above thick with flames. The flames, heavy as clouds, condensed into a massive pillar of light that connected heaven and earth, seventy-two blazing patterns coiling around it. A tall, middle-aged man in golden robes descended from the pillar, his hands clasped behind his back, his eyes indifferent.

It was Daoist Master Tianque of the Golden Feather Sect!

This Daoist Master rarely took action personally these days. He stood in the air, wreathed in flame, quietly holding a golden ring. His expression was calm, but it made Yanbai's face below turn ugly. Yanbai stared, stunned, for a long moment before finally speaking.

"Zhao and Shu made an agreement: the Huai region is not to be attacked! Since the Golden Feather Sect follows Shu's command, what right do you have to make this unauthorized move east?"

He spoke with absolute clarity, perhaps feeling that West Shu had already broken their promise. But his words made Li Ximing look up sharply, and Tinglan narrowed her eyes. A strange feeling rose in both their hearts.

'An agreement between Zhao and Shu: the Huai region is not to be attacked...'

Daoist Master Tianque, however, showed no reaction. As a prominent figure of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition, he not only looked down on Dharma Realm figures like Yanbai, but his strength was more than enough to kill him. He stood with his hands behind his back and said indifferently,

"Dispel your Dharma Body and accept this one divine ability... or I will send you back to the Buddhist Land."

Yanbai stared at him intently. This Maha was no fool. In an instant, everything became clear, and a few words flashed like lightning through his mind: "Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain!"

The moment the words left his mouth, the enormous profound pillar in the sky plummeted, smashing into the heavy white light. A tremendous sound, like mountains collapsing and the earth splitting apart, echoed through the night sky as rings of explosive flame rippled outward.

"BOOM!"

The once-majestic, enormous white-gold Dharma Body instantly disintegrated. A torrent of shattered light and grit rained down. A streak of white light, like a bird with a broken wing, stumbled northward. Daoist Master Tianque didn't hesitate for a second. His gaze swept over the three of them.

"Tinglan, you guard this mountain. You two, follow me to Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain."

Hearing those words, Li Ximing's heart pounded.

'It really is Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain!'

How could Yang Ruiyi have gotten the Golden Feather Sect's support? The answer had to be at Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain! Back then, for the sake of Wanling Heaven, the Golden Feather Sect had been forced to sacrifice their subordinates, the Golden Tang Gate, allowing Tangdao Mountain to become a land of Primordial Magnetism. Now that Wanling Heaven had fallen, how could True Monarch Taiyuan possibly ignore this thorn in his side in the Huai region?

As long as Yang Ruiyi went with the goal of resolving the Primordial Magnetism, the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition would certainly support him with all their strength!

Making Yanbai take that divine ability was just to ensure he couldn't return to attack Xiaoshi or reinforce Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain anytime soon! With just a single exchange, these Daoist Masters and Mahas already understood the stakes.

Most of his doubts were suddenly resolved in that instant. All that remained were a few minor, lingering details. Sima Yuanli met his gaze, clearly having reached the same understanding. He immediately followed after the Daoist Master and said with a smile,

"It seems the Great General has solved the Golden Oneness's troubles!"

With the situation reversed in an instant, Sima Yuanli immediately became solicitous. He certainly wasn't going to call it "Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain" anymore. He reminded them in a low voice,

"With the Great Daoist Master present, the situation at Tangdao Mountain is surely settled. But Qi Lanyan still has many men under his command. We must worry about him ruining the Golden Oneness's important affairs!"

Tianque was polite enough to the two of them. He shook his head slightly and sped forward, saying softly,

"Now that he's seen the Manifestations Earth, Qi Lanyan won't come. He's from the Profound Governance, after all. He has read the Classics and knows what is about to happen in those mountains."

Sima Yuanli seemed lost in thought. Tianque then turned to look at Li Ximing, his body blazing with brilliant flames. He raised an eyebrow and said:

"Change in Metal is _Geng_ (Geng). In Wood, _Geng_ (Renewing). In Water, _Lu_ (Pristine). In Fire, _Hong_ (Blazing). And in Earth, _Xuan_ (Manifestation). This 'Manifestation' means to unblock that which is dark and stagnant, to allow the earth and stone to rise up and transform. It allows the Metal to emerge from the Malice, and the Malice to depart into the Earth. To deconstruct the Primordial Magnetism... there is no greater merit."

"Since Yang Ruiyi has initiated the Manifestations Earth, my daoist tradition naturally has every reason to help. Otherwise, if we wait for all the Buddhists to return, they will interrupt the manifestation. The autumn dew will fall on Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain, the Primordial Magnetism will regenerate, and it will become an incurable affliction."

His gaze was distant, and he seemed to show little joy at the prospect of removing this long-standing affliction. Li Ximing understood. A pensive look gradually came over his face, and he remained silent for a long time.

'Qi Lanyan, Yang Ruiyi, even Tianque... every one of them is just taking what they need. This entire north-south conflict was a scheme targeting the Buddhist cultivators of Mount Dayang! And the true objective is to resolve the Primordial Magnetism at Great Origin Light-Hiding Mountain!'

He glanced at Tianque, a suspicion growing in his heart.

'But... was this really the plan from the very beginning? I'm afraid every one of them had their own agenda. It was Yang Ruiyi who pushed the situation to this point, allowing the other parties to jump in and follow the trend. The final price will be paid entirely by Mount Dayang, whose members are disunited and have no high-level support in Jiangbei or the Huai region!'
