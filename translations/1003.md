# Chapter 1003: Harmony and Accord

'The Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence...'

The radiance of the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance interlaced as pure qi swirled within the High Firmament Pavilion. Li Zhouwei stood inside, arms crossed, meticulously reading the cultivation manual as his mind began to race.

He had seen quite a few "Sacred Scrolls" in the Li family's possession. The Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity, the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court, and even the Manual of the Daoist Profound Succession that Liu Changdie had mentioned in passing—they were all of the same category.

Most of them recorded a vast number of spell arts and esoteric techniques. Having read so many, Li Zhouwei sensed a familiar thread connecting them. This was especially true for the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence and the Art of the Star Court. Their format was identical; they clearly originated from the same source.

Now that he thought about it, even the Sacred Scroll of the Qilin's Radiant Sun bore a faint resemblance. He fell silent for a long moment, his heart pounding.

'There's something more here... These scrolls seem to originate from a single Daoist Tradition. Even the most distinct one, the Sacred Scroll of the Qilin's Radiant Sun, shares commonalities. At the very least, they must be branches of the same ancient Daoist Tradition, one that has fractured and changed over the millennia. They are what the major sects would call a single "Dao-path"... They all carry the flavor of having evolved from a common root.'

In the current era, the order of the Prefectures had collapsed, making it impossible to trace the origins of many things. But in antiquity, these systems had strict names. For example, Changhuai and Cultivation Transcendence both emerged from the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. Although they didn't call themselves Supreme Yang, if one were to be precise, they could be considered part of the same Dao-path.

These "Sacred Scrolls" were quite different from the "Classics" the Li family had obtained in the past. They clearly belonged to another system entirely. The only exception was the Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity. Despite being a Sacred Scroll, its many spell arts lacked that strong, shared lineage.

'The Heaven–Governing is explicitly from the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition... Sacred Scrolls... Heaven-Governing... sacrifice... it's also a divine office...'

'Daoist Master Xiang Chun said that in ancient times, there were Immortal Lords, Divine Monarchs, Imperial Monarchs, and True Monarchs... They all shared that "Divine" character. The collapse of worship and the divine offices today... it's the same pattern.'

He raised an eyebrow slightly.

'In that case... the Ancient Wei State, the source of the Sacred Scroll of the Qilin's Radiant Sun, must have had deep ties to the Encompassing Profoundity as well...'

Li Zhouwei reined in his thoughts and took a quick look. His Immortal Merits had increased from 329 to 364. Li Ximing's battle had added thirty-five.

'In the Grotto-Heaven, I fought the Merciful One and severely wounded Helian Wujiang, who cultivated demonic arts, and only earned thirty-one points. But killing Nuxiao gave me thirty-five. Their strengths aren't even comparable. It seems killing Buddhist cultivators is more lucrative... the reward in Immortal Merits is higher.'

'Next time, even if I can't secure a kill, I must destroy their Dharma body. Simply suppressing them in a fight yields far too few Immortal Merits...'

He examined the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence. It was complete up to the sixth rank, containing a rich and comprehensive inheritance. It cost 189 merits. If he exchanged for it, he would have 175 remaining.

'I have so many spell arts already. Grand-Uncle hasn't even mastered the dozen or so he possesses. And he's busy with his own cultivation. I won't need this for at least thirty or forty years... and what I have left will be more than enough.'

When he had exchanged for the Emperor Qi's Light, he had been stingy, deliberating endlessly. Now, he didn't hesitate at all. He casually made the exchange and strode out of the pavilion.

He walked right into Li Ximing, who was holding out a pill.

The pill swirled with black and gold, its colors vibrant, stirring up waves of spiritual qi. However, the perfect balance of Yin and Yang within the Grotto-Heaven suppressed these fluctuations, preventing them from spreading. Li Ximing spoke with a serious expression,

"Now that your wounds are healed and the situation outside is unstable, this is the perfect time to use the Nangong Xuan-Sui Pill for your cultivation. This pill can open a Profound Palace within your body, allowing you to cultivate slowly. Its medicinal power won't dissipate easily, which is ideal for a situation where you might be interrupted to fight at any moment."

"After you've finished using it, the residual power can even be used to fill a divine ability. It's also suitable for bestowing upon the younger generation to protect themselves!"

...

Simin Prefecture.

Simin Prefecture was the foundation of the Azure Pond Sect. It was densely populated and home to numerous clans. For hundreds of years, while the Yue State had seen more chaos than peace, Simin, as the Azure Pond's base, had remained stable and free of turmoil. As far as the eye could see, roofs interconnected and pavilions rose in tiers.

In the main hall on the heights, a man in bright white feathered robes was looking down in contemplation. He was carefully examining an official's robe draped over the desk.

"The decorative borders... let's stick with the five-colored true jade pattern. The main body of the robe will use the four-convergence Ruyi Scepter cloud pattern... As for the emblem..."

He frowned slightly,

"What does the Great Zhao use?"

The minor officials before him quickly looked up and replied in low voices,

"They use the Kui beast, with a foundation of wood and stone patterns..."

Li Jiangliang's gaze shifted to the side, landing on a smiling woman. He saw Yang Tianyou raise an eyebrow.

"Use intertwined serpents, water-and-fire, and the great python."

The subordinates on both sides immediately agreed, saying respectfully,

"We will have it illustrated at once and present it to you, my lords, for your approval."

Li Jiangliang nodded slightly. The group departed, carrying the robes as if they were priceless treasures. Yang Tianyou turned and gazed out the window, commenting idly,

"Simin is prosperous, after all."

Even though the chaos of the past few years had been rampant, and a terrible battle had been fought right outside Simin, the prefecture itself had remained relatively peaceful. Li Jiangliang stepped forward, still finding it hard to believe,

"The Azure Pond Sect... just handed over Simin like that?"

When Yang Zhuo had led Li Jiangliang and the others to Simin's gates, the Azure Pond Sect was already in internal chaos. Only Qin Xian's faction had been there to defend the prefecture. That man, Qin, had sensed what was coming, but he had no choice but to ride the wind and mount a defense.

Qin Xian came from a humble background. He was an opportunist who had clawed his way to his current position. Despite his mediocre dao lineage, he had enjoyed many benefits. Even the peak lords of the Azure Pond might not have been able to defeat him easily.

But before Yang Zhuo, he didn't last a single exchange. The "Nine-Bend Pacifier Trident" hadn't even fallen before six types of water and fire descended on him in sequence. Qin Xian was annihilated, body and soul, before he could even make a sound. The only Sect Master in the Azure Pond Sect's history to rise from common origins had died violently in front of everyone.

The remaining forces dissolved into chaos. Led by Qin Xian's son, Qin Lianfu, the cultivators were about to flee when a direct descendant of the Si family under Yang Zhuo's command stepped forward and shouted. No matter how much Qin's faction disbelieved it, they bowed their heads and surrendered. Rewards were immediately distributed.

And so, Simin Prefecture, which the Azure Pond Sect had cultivated for six hundred years, fell in less than an hour. The forces on both sides "joyfully welcomed the king's army." The various cultivators, led by the Deng family, knelt and wept. The Deng Family Head cried his heart out, counting on his fingers as he listed every grievance, detailing how the Azure Pond Sect had persecuted the Dengs for centuries and which of his relatives had been murdered.

Li Jiangliang found it rather difficult to watch. He knew the Deng family's background. If they truly harbored such hatred, they wouldn't have remained "quiet as chickens" during the Chi family's rebellion. They were just seizing an opportunity for profit.

But Yang Zhuo needed him. He granted the Dengs three towns and, according to future arrangements, a founding martial peerage, "Attendant of the Primal Hall," a minor, sixth-rank title.

"Qin Lianfu, Si Xunlong, Zheng Shuyan, Li Quantao, Quan Yuduan... all of them received fiefdoms. Once the state is founded, they will all be ranked among the martial peerage. How many more noble clans will this create..."

Li Jiangliang sighed softly. The woman turned back to him, her voice gentle.

"Is that not a good thing?"

"It's not that it's bad... The Yue State has suffered too many disasters. There are vast tracts of barren land and scores of displaced people. Without local clans, we don't have enough people to defend these territories... But... but this is too much. And there's no need to grant them land."

Li Jiangliang looked hesitant. He lowered his voice.

"I understand that His Lordship wants to avoid excessive bloodshed, but for the entire Azure Pond Sect, only the arch-villain Qin Xian died... In a single day, seventy-one fiefs were granted in Simin. This prefecture alone will, by decree, have seventy-one great and small noble families after the founding..."

"I just feel it's wrong. I fear... the harm it will cause..."

Yang Tianyou lowered her gaze, concealing the emotion in her eyes, and cut him off.

"Brother has his considerations."

"It is not yet time for us to raise the great banner. The Azure Pond Sect's rule is effectively over, it's true. If we were to completely topple this behemoth, we could indeed seize all of the Yue State's territory. But what about the territories in the Eastern Sea and the Southern Sea? As long as that banner isn't officially raised, those territories will be carved up by the other great families, who will simply pretend not to notice."

"This is also why Brother stopped at the foot of Azure Pond Mountain. If he hadn't, this affair might have cost the life of a divine ability cultivator! We need this behemoth to hang on, to use benefits as bait. Only then can we rope in the entire Azure Pond Sect. The Si family is on our side now... Azure Pond Mountain still has the Immortal Order to communicate with the two seas, which is the only way to barely maintain control over those overseas territories. After all... even the mountain itself is now under our control. Brother had Si Tongyi establish the 'Bureau of Immortal Rites' to maintain the Azure Pond's registers, keeping a tight grip on these people and lands."

"A few days ago, there was turmoil on the Azure Pond Sect's islands in the Eastern Sea. If not for the Si family's Daoist Master Qinghu and the Azure Pond's own Daoist Master Ning taking action, those islands would have been divided up amidst this drastic change. It would be much harder to extend our reach overseas in the future."

She sighed.

"We are not of the Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition. Whatever overseas territories we can legitimately inherit, we must take. We have almost no way to expand further. By the same token, once a territory is lost, it is nearly impossible to reclaim."

But this didn't seem to be the answer Li Jiangliang was looking for. It wasn't that he didn't understand this reasoning. He just hesitated,

"My concern is for the common people. If we truly let noble clans spread across the mainland, what chance will commoners ever have to rise? Besides, if these people are being rewarded so handsomely, what about the Immortal Clans?"

"Do they have a chance to rise today? What about Qin Xian?" Yang Tianyou's expression was calm as she smiled.

"As for the Immortal Clans... they will be enfeoffed as Kings!"

Li Jiangliang was silent for a moment, then asked,

"Have the titles been decided?"

Yang Tianyou looked intrigued and covered her mouth with a smile.

"It's still early... But does your family's title even need to be discussed?"

A tremor went through Li Jiangliang's heart. He actually felt a sliver of comfort. He muttered to himself,

'His Lordship said the position of King brings great benefits. Besides, being known as a King-Marquis will give my family status when they go out. I suppose this is one way I can contribute to the clan.'

Although, given Yang Zhuo's attitude toward the noble clans, his family would likely have received a King-Marquis title even without his involvement. But he had the merit of aiding the new sovereign; at least he could secure more territory for his family. After pondering this, he changed the subject, his tone worried.

"I heard the karmic fire has crossed the Wilderness and already reached Lixia. His Lordship has been in seclusion for a long time. Is there any news?"

At the mention of the karmic fire, Yang Tianyou showed no worry, only a faint smile.

"That is the Sparrow Carp Fish. You don't need to worry about him. He is here to be reincarnated. When the Sparrow Carp Fish reaches the gates of Simin Prefecture, you will naturally be able to see Brother."

Li Jiangliang seemed lost in thought. He was about to speak when a person rushed up the steps, bowing.

"My Lord! A secret letter from Lord Chen!"

Li Jiangliang was interrupted. He turned, took the letter, and scanned it. His expression turned slightly strange.

"Linhai is experiencing a celestial phenomenon. A wind of shamanic curses and owl feathers, the air filled with ghostly wails and spectral shrieks..."

He looked at Yang Tianyou.

"Does this mean success or failure?"

When it came to matters of divine ability, the Yang family—or rather, the Underworld—naturally understood them best. Yang Tianyou nodded, her expression serious.

"The old Sword Immortal poured everything into training them. How many people from the Lingu family have been sacrificed already? First Lingu Yi and Lingu Dan, then Lingu Rao. How many spiritual items? How many precious pills? They finally produced one Lingu Lanying, and they even had to beg our family for help. Which other family has such resources? Only the Lingu family! Of course it was a success!"

"Others may not know... but we know perfectly well. Besides Lingu Lanying, there are two others in seclusion, acting as backups, though their chances of breaking through are slim. They've practically sacrificed all of the Lingu family's geniuses... Sword Immortal Lou Xing was truly ruthless!"

Li Jiangliang sighed in admiration, then shook his head.

"You're wrong to say that. This is a matter of profound righteousness, not ruthlessness. If the Lingu family hadn't been so useless, one of their Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would have entered the stage long ago."

"It's not too late now," Yang Tianyou remarked.

Li Jiangliang nodded.

"It has been difficult for the senior, given his sincere intentions. Now that Lingu Lanying has emerged, Linhai Prefecture is saved. Even if the Great Xiukui Monastery seals its mountain, the Lingu family can protect the mortal Lin Clan and their many branches... It also allows the Great Xiukui Monastery to stay out of the conflict... A brilliant move, truly."

Yang Tianyou lamented,

"Brilliant, yes. But also supremely merciless. To protect the integrity of the Great Xiukui Monastery, he refused to speak a single word of truth to Houfu or Kui Qi. He was willing to let Qin Ling block Xueyang with her life, all for a sliver of a chance. It just shows how unyielding his sword-heart truly is..."

Li Jiangliang could only sigh again in respect. He then saw his wife smile.

"In any case, your family has benefited greatly. Your uncle's peerage has already been discussed in the hall. Several people are deliberating, but it will be at least a third-rank title, enfeoffed in Lixia. As for yours..."

The "uncle" she spoke of was naturally Li Zhouluo. The Li family had not been deeply involved in this turmoil; the only ones to receive titles were Li Jiangliang and Li Zhouluo.

Li Jiangliang shook his head.

"You don't need to think about me. A nominal title is enough. I have no desire for a fiefdom."

A smile appeared on his face, his eyes filled with longing and hope.

"When His Lordship's work is complete, when Jiangnan is stable, and the people have homes and sustenance, I will resign from my worldly duties. I'll take you back to the lake, find a small pavilion on the island, and spend my days proofreading Daoist scriptures and organizing traditions. In my leisure time, I'll just steer a boat on the lake, warm some wine, and sleep."

Yang Tianyou turned her head away, unable to meet his gaze. She forced a smile.

"A man of your talent... hand-picked by Brother as a gentleman capable of governing the state. How could you be satisfied with just a small pavilion?"

Li Jiangliang chuckled, his eyes still fixed on the scroll in his hand. He shook his head and sighed.

"You don't understand. My elder brothers are the real talents. A mediocre person like me... even on the island, I'd only be fit to manage a small pavilion."

His voice was gentle, his brow relaxed in a smile.

"When the time comes, I'll show you the lake scenery from Moongaze."

Yang Tianyou answered with a low hum, still not daring to look at him.

The smile that always graced the face of this proud daughter of the Yang family, this scion of a Golden Core bloodline, faded. She feigned composure, staring out the window, but the slender hand resting on the sill tightened, then relaxed. She closed her beautiful eyes, pressing her lips together as a sudden, sharp pain bloomed in her heart.

'Oh, you...'
