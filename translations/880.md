# Chapter 880: Chunyi

Splitreed Island.

The Azure Pond Sect's garrison on Splitreed Island had rotated several times. The tall pillars Ning Hejing had erected years ago were long gone, melted down and replaced with replanted forests. The high peaks were now covered in pine groves, dotted with graceful pavilions.

A young noble in dark robes stood within one such pavilion, sword in hand. The blade was gleaming gold, and six rays of golden light trailed long streamers as they spiraled around him. He raised an eyebrow, facing the radiant setting sun, and let out a long breath.

"A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... is truly different."

This was none other than Li Zhouluo, who had recently arrived on Splitreed Island. He had already emerged from his seclusion, having successfully broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and formed his 'Golden Beast Plume'.

He had left Moongaze Lake behind, and he now radiated a vibrant, confident energy. He waited in the pavilion, and soon, a woman in green robes walked up the path, holding a swaddled infant.

"Yunqing!"

Li Zhouluo turned and nodded to her.

The woman gave a quiet smile, walked to the table, and handed him the child. She then took out a jade pot and poured him tea.

Li Zhouluo took the child from her, said his thanks, and turned to look at the baby. The green-robed woman sat quietly at the table, her gaze following his.

This woman was Pang Yunqing. She was the match Li Xizhi had found for him after several searches, the one he had finally agreed to. She hailed from the Pang clan of Bamboo Creek Island, a family under the governance of the Chunyi Dao Gate, and was currently cultivating at the Azure Pond Sect.

His father, Li Chenghuai, had not played a significant role in the marriage. The Daoist Master had returned to Moongaze Lake, emerged from his own seclusion, and then traveled to this island. After taking a medicinal pill, he immediately entered seclusion once more. By that point, Li Zhouluo's major life events—both his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm and his marriage—had already been arranged.

Li Xizhi had vetted many potential matches for Li Zhouluo, from families in both the Northern Sea and the Southern Sea. Countless families were eager to form an alliance, and there was certainly no shortage of beauties. Some of these families were in dire straits, grasping for a lifeline; others were simply meetings between peers, a chance to size each other up. Yet, after reviewing all the options, Li Zhouluo ultimately chose Pang Yunqing.

There was nothing particularly dramatic about their union. The Pang clan of Bamboo Creek had been under the Chunyi Dao Gate for generations, possessing a stable heritage. Pang Yunqing herself was a new disciple, accepted by the Azure Pond Sect only after the Ning clan took control. Her master was a Ning family confidant, Lin Wuning. She was quiet and unassuming. Li Zhouluo found her to have a good temperament, the families were a suitable match, and so the engagement was finalized. They later moved to Splitreed Island and were blessed with a rare child—the eldest grandson of the Fourth branch, Li Jiangchun.

Even though they had a child together, Li Zhouluo and Pang Yunqing shared few words. She was naturally taciturn; when she wasn't caring for the baby, she was racing against time to cultivate, leaving no opportunity for casual conversation.

While quiet, she was dedicated to her own path of cultivation and had little mind for other things. If he offered a few words of affection, she would just grow embarrassed and stammer. In the end, their relationship resembled that of fellow Daoists, their conversations limited to matters of cultivation.

Now that Li Zhouluo was out of seclusion and practicing his Dharma Arts, it was his turn to look after Li Jiangchun. This was their established routine. Pang Yunqing waited only a moment longer before murmuring an apology. With a dip of her lovely brow, she excused herself, clearly eager to seize the time for her own secluded cultivation.

'I suppose... nine out of ten cultivator couples from prominent families are just like this.'

Li Zhouluo was long used to it. He lifted Li Jiangchun in his arms and paced the courtyard. When he saw a middle-aged man in black robes approach, he quickly looked up and said:

"Uncle Wushao... What is it?"              

The years had left few marks on Li Wushao; he looked the same as ever. He offered a respectful bow and said in a solemn voice,

"The Pavilion Master requests your presence!"

Li Zhouluo stood up immediately. He looked left and right, but there was no one else around. He had no choice but to hand the child to Li Wushao, replying,

"I'll go at once!"

This startled Li Wushao so much he nearly jumped. He frantically took the infant, freezing on the spot, utterly bewildered. The baby immediately started to wail, making Li Wushao feel like his head would split in two, but Li Zhouluo was already striding quickly away.

Li Zhouluo made his way to the summit, where a man with a dignified, noble aura sat wearing a feathered robe. Li Zhouluo quickly performed a salute and said respectfully,

"Greetings, Grandfather."

Li Xizhi raised an eyebrow and smiled, speaking softly,

"Come."

He invited Li Zhouluo to sit before he began to speak:

"You must have heard the news from the Southern Sea last March. Several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators besieged the Maha, Baoqing. If the Buddhist Land hadn't intervened, and with the abbot of the Great Konghai Temple watching from the side, he would have been denied even the chance to reincarnate."

"That battle claimed one Maha and five Merciful Ones. Only three of those Merciful Ones survived. Although Baoqing escaped, he was critically wounded and is no longer a threat. The great families have since carved up the Southern Sea."

"Daoist Master Qiuhu has now stepped in to coordinate. After detailed negotiations with Daoist Master Zhusheng of Shahuan, they have managed to trade for the return of North Dan Island. Even though it no longer includes the original Ten Thousand Mile Shitang, it remains a crucial strategic outpost."

Li Xizhi said softly,

"Daoist Master Qiuhu needs someone to assume command there. Dantai Jin, for his part, recommended Clan-Uncle Yuanqin. At the same time, he resigned as Sect Master, using his seclusion to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm as an excuse. The position is now vacant, and many factions are voicing their opinions."

"Daoist Master Qiuhu asked him who should fill the vacancy, and Dantai Jin strongly recommended me."

Hearing this, Li Zhouluo looked up and said quickly,

"Grandfather, your strength and reputation are unmatched. No one in the sect would object. There were already rumors... Dantai Jin..."

Li Xizhi waved his hand, cutting him off.

"Dantai Jin's words are flattering, but it's impossible for me to take the Sect Master position. I replied to Daoist Master Qiuhu and suggested Tongyi instead. The Daoist Master is perceptive and will not press the issue. However, once Tongyi becomes the Sect Master of the Azure Pond Sect, people like Qin Xian and Lin Wuning are certain to rise to powerful positions."

"Yunqing is Lin Wuning's disciple. I've had him arrange a transfer to the Mushroom Forest Plains. It's not far from Moongaze Lake. You and your wife can cultivate there, and you'll be close enough to assist the family if needed."

Li Zhouluo quickly bowed in acceptance and asked,

"What about Father and you, Grandfather...?"

Li Xizhi shook his head.

"By my estimation, your father will emerge from seclusion soon. With the resources from the Yang family and the preparations I've left behind, he can focus on his cultivation in peace. Sending you away now is also due to the shifting situation... I no longer intend to remain on Splitreed Island."

"Ah?"

Li Zhouluo was stunned for a moment. He asked,

"Grandfather, you mean..."

Li Xizhi sighed softly.

His cultivation had been stalled at the peak of the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm for a very long time. His mastery of spell arts had improved steadily over the years, but it had hit a plateau and slowed. Without a greater catalyst, he feared he could not advance any further.

He was unwilling to take the seat of Sect Master, and the benefits from Splitreed Island were diminishing. He felt he was essentially doing free labor for the Azure Pond Sect. After so long in one place, he grew restless. Staring at his stagnant cultivation, Li Xizhi finally decided to leave.

Li Ximing had also written to him over the years. Although the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had clearly stated that paths within the Heavenly Glow Daoist tradition were exceedingly rare, with few legacies even among the most ancient Daoist traditions, what cultivator did not aspire to the Purple Mansion Realm? Especially one like Li Xizhi, who was only a single step away?

As news of one person after another entering seclusion to assail the Purple Mansion Realm arrived, Li Xizhi naturally couldn't remain sitting idly on the mountain.

"The Heavenly Glow Daoist traditions in this world originate from two places: first is Luoxia, and second is Mount Duan. If I am to find my path to the Purple Mansion Realm, I fear I must travel to Mount Duan, the territory of the Dragon-kin. Whether it was Lingu Xia or the Daoist who created the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique, both of them lacked a complete method at the end. They achieved their breakthroughs by forcing it in the vicinity of Mount Duan... There must be a clue there."

"This is my third rotation guarding Splitreed Island. Any other cultivator in this position would have already earned a fortune. A year ago, I requested to be relieved of my duties here, asking for leave to visit home. Daoist Master Qiuhu granted it."

He took a sip of tea and continued,

"I've already sent a letter home. The Daoist Master Zhaojing has entered seclusion, so I will ride the Dawn Rayfish back to the lake to check on things and consult with him. After that, I will leave the mainland and journey across the Four Seas to find my own Heavenly Glow Daoist tradition."

In truth, Li Xizhi still had a worry. He needed to ask Li Ximing in person about the meaning of that fragment. It was something that could neither be spoken of to outsiders nor written in a letter.

Hearing this, Li Zhouluo could only bow and say,

"I can only wish you a safe journey, Grandfather."

Li Xizhi waved his hand, rising with his hands clasped behind his back. He cut a dashing figure as he replied,

"Once matters for you and Chenghuai were settled, my greatest worries were resolved. When my father sent me to the sect, his only wish was for me to protect our clan. I already considered leaving when the Daoist Master achieved the Purple Mansion Realm, but the family was still unstable and I had lingering concerns. I stayed on this island simply to watch over and help..."

"Now that the clan is stabilizing, it's time for me to go back and see."

...

Chunyi Island.

Waves crashed, and reefs stood firm against the spray.

Chunyi Island was actually an archipelago. In the beginning, it was just a single immortal mountain rising from the sea. Through generations, the Daoists of the Chunyi Dao Gate had moved mountains and filled in the ocean, painstakingly reclaiming land. It had slowly expanded until it was now seventy percent the size of Crimson Reef Island.

From a distance, the immortal mountains and islands looked orderly and harmonious. A crescent-shaped pool on the main island glittered brightly. Cultivators refining the Supreme Yin soared on clouds, a sight of profound grace.

The island was not far from Crimson Reef Island, which in turn bordered the Sword Gate. Relations between the three powers had deteriorated significantly in recent years. The battle at the Green Pine Temple had been particularly brutal—so many cultivators had fallen that the spiritual motes and items transformed from their remains had yet to be fully recovered.

The Chunyi Dao Gate projected an aura of peace and serenity. Yet, a streak of azure light suddenly pierced this calm, shooting in from the north and flashing across the islands. It halted before the central immortal mountain, resolving into the figure of a man.

He wore azure robes, his features youthful, and his sleeves fluttered in the wind. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his eyes a pale azure. The cultivators patrolling the area passed by as if he were invisible. Only the grand formation on the immortal mountain rippled, and a figure flew out to meet him.

This person was dressed in white robes, embroidered with patterns of waves and crescent moons, and wore a pale silver jade belt. His features were striking, with a high-bridged nose, but his eyes were filled with vigilance. He stopped a good distance away, carefully scrutinizing the visitor.

"I am Che Hong. Greetings, Great Daoist Master. Dare I ask if I am addressing Daoist Master Buzi?"

The man in azure was indeed Chi Buzi. His expression was perfectly relaxed as he replied:

"Che Hong... The Chunyi Immortal Dao has truly been blessed with talent lately. In just a few short decades, it has gained two Daoist Masters from your line—both grandfather and grandson. Is Senior Yuanshang present?"

"A friend from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition comes to call, and he can't even get past the gate?"

As soon as he heard this, Daoist Master Che Hong's expression turned cold and distant. He clearly recognized him. However, wary of the man's immense cultivation and famed Divine Ability, he did not turn hostile outright, only replying indifferently:

"Great Daoist Master must be joking."

This Daoist Master Che Hong of the Chunyi Dao Gate was blunt, all but stating outright: 'Does the demonic Azure Pond Sect count as part of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition?' Chi Buzi, however, remained completely unbothered. He said casually,

"The Chunyi Dao Gate now has four Daoist Masters, your strength rivals that of Hengzhu, and you have Daoist Master Yuanshang himself presiding. Surely you aren't afraid of me, all alone?"

Daoist Master Che Hong's expression was frosty. He replied,

"Great Daoist Master, do not jest. If you have no business here, I will not see you out."

Chi Buzi laughed. He raised his hand, palm up. A mass of grayish-black energy appeared, swirling in his palm and coalescing into a sphere the size of his hand.

"Take a look. What is this?"

This sphere of gray, thread-like water was unmistakably a highly condensed Divine Ability. Daoist Master Che Hong's own clan possessed this very legacy; he didn't need a second glance to recognize it. It was the Divine Ability, Chou-Gui Hidden Form!

Daoist Master Che Hong frowned. He had long known that Chi Buzi had broken through to the late-stage Purple Mansion Realm. This Great Daoist Master wouldn't travel so far just to show off. He remained silent, considering the implications.

But as he observed it closely for a moment, a bad feeling arose. His heart leaped as a sudden, intense familiarity struck him:

'This *is* our clan's Divine Ability!'

Chi Buzi said casually,

"I cultivated this from my own comprehension, yet I managed to manifest your family's Divine Ability. Don't you think Senior Yuanshang might want to take a look?"

At these words, Daoist Master Che Hong did not reply, but simply stared intently at Chi Buzi. The azure-eyed man continued,

"Some things cannot be said out here. I must enter the formation, must I not?"

Che Hong finally wavered, hesitating.

The formation on Chunyi Island was no trivial matter. If Chi Buzi intended to cause trouble, he would be severely suppressed within it. Furthermore, with four Daoist Masters in attendance, his willingness to enter the array was, by any measure, a sign of sincerity.

'Che Hong, let him in.'

A voice, carried by a Divine Ability, echoed in his mind. Though still reluctant, Daoist Master Che Hong had no choice but to step aside and bid him entry.

The two flew into the grand formation and were immediately greeted by swirling snow. A platform on the summit held a round, crystal-clear jade pool. The water within was a snowy white, tinged with moonlight, appearing as much like liquid as it did like piles of fresh snow. Nearby tables and chairs were buried. A middle-aged man in white robes stood at the pool's edge.

Chi Buzi finally adopted a more serious expression. He clasped his hands and said,

"So it is Daoist Friend Fuxuan. Senior Yuanshang is not here?"

"Master has not been fond of moving about in recent years. He no longer emerges from seclusion."

This middle-aged man, Fuxuan, did not seem to share the strong prejudices of his fellow Chunyi Dao Gate cultivators. He nodded slightly, inviting Chi Buzi to sit by the pool, and spoke in a low voice,

"You truly live up to your name as the great hope of the Chi family. If you had not defied Chi Wei's wishes, the Azure Pond Sect, and perhaps the entire Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, would look very different today."

Chi Buzi gave a noncommittal smile.

"Daoist Friend, you saw it yourself. I had a fortunate encounter and obtained an ancient cultivation method, allowing me to master the Chou-Gui Hidden Form. I suspect this art is one and the same as your clan's 'Chou-Gui Water-Seeking Method.' I have come today to seek verification."

He raised an eyebrow and smiled, adding,

"The 'Chou-Gui Water-Seeking Method' was a boon bestowed upon the Xi clan by the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. As far as I know, they were the only ones to receive it. This very Daoist tradition has now fallen into my hands. Where this 'fortunate encounter' came from, and *which* Daoist tradition it belongs to... I trust I don't need to elaborate."

Daoist Master Fuxuan had allowed him inside, obviously having understood the implications. The Divine Ability in Chi Buzi's palm was genuine. Whether he had truly cultivated it from 'his own comprehension,' however, was uncertain. Fuxuan merely raised an eyebrow and said,

"Daoist Friend claims to have cultivated this from his own comprehension. Why not step under the Taiqun Spirit-Mirror? It would allow us to take a proper look at this Divine Ability."
