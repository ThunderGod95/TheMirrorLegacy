# Chapter 834: Why Seek Another Path?

Ning Wan sat silently upon her jade-green throne, seemingly unmoved by Yuanxiu’s words. This matter couldn’t be dismissed simply because the old man claimed the item was no longer in his hands. The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal was an exceptionally precious Dharma Treasure, a renowned artifact even in ancient times, powerful enough to make any Purple Mansion Realm cultivator cast aside their pride.

Her gaze fell upon the old man’s hand resting on the throne’s armrest. "Back then," she said softly, "the Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal was in the hands of you seniors. It made scheming against others convenient and reaped you plenty of benefits. But no matter what, that artifact belongs to Azure Pond Sect. We are a proud Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. Even with our master temporarily absent, our treasures should not be so easily taken."

Ning Wan was clearly unconvinced. Yuanxiu, his back stooped with age, replied, "That ordinary people would not dare only proves that it was no ordinary person who took it. What belongs to Yuansu is his. I would not hide it."

His words, contrary to her expectation, gave Ning Wan pause. A flicker of genuine doubt entered her heart. "Senior, you refuse to say who took it," she pressed. "If the situation is truly so dire that it cannot be spoken of, why speak of it today? And if this is because our master is beyond the heavens, why did he not secure it long ago?"

Yuanxiu stood like an old, weathered tree. "The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal is the seal of the Feathered Serpent, the progenitor of Pristine Water," he said in a low voice. "This item is far more useful than you imagine. The only reason it was in Ning Tiaoxiao’s hands was because our master allowed it. Once he died, the item was naturally lost."

"But there was one thing our master did not anticipate. Even if Daoist Master Donghua, Li Jiangqun, had left a treasure for Ning Tiaoxiao’s reincarnation within the seal, he would have died before ever using it. That was the sort of man he was. He would grit his teeth and swallow his own blood before ever nourishing his enemy."

Ning Wan’s expression began to shift as the old man continued speaking calmly.

"When Ning Tiaoxiao fell, Zipei thought me greedy, that I wanted to seize the artifact from the Ning Family. She insisted on placing it in Ning Heyuan's hands... She overestimated me. As long as that seal remained with a Ning, the moment I looked away, it would be schemed away by others... I am a Great Daoist Master of Azure Pond Sect. They wouldn't know if I acted with our master's blessing. But Ning Heyuan was different. For him, possessing it was a death warrant."

"If he had been more perceptive back then, he might not have died."

Ning Wan wanted to speak but held her tongue. Yuanxiu went on, "You can't blame her. How could one speak of such matters to someone outside the Daoist tradition? She was fiercely protective of Yuansu. Had I tried to take the seal by force, she would have fought me. I could only leave. As I departed, I saw Pu Yu of the Penglai Daoist tradition performing divinations. His arts are profound; perhaps he had long suspected something."

Ning Wan listened in silence.

"I watched you grow up," the old man said. "For the sake of the bond between our families, let me offer you some advice. The Xinyou Pristine Marsh Seal is not something you can touch. Wait until I am dead, when you are sitting alone upon the Pristine Merging Owl Pool, and you will understand just how much trouble it is."

He let out a dry, raspy laugh. "By then, you won't be the master of the Ning Family. You will be the master of Azure Pond Sect! Whether you want it or not, it will no longer be the Ning Family of Azure Pond Sect, but the Azure Pond Sect of the Ning Family."

A complex look crossed Ning Wan’s face. As a sect cultivator raised in Azure Pond and bound to the Green Pine Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, she was already marked. With the Pristine Speech Heaven watching from above, she could never truly leave. At most, she could emulate Chi Buzi, feigning a desire to travel the world to abandon her clan. She would never have the power to break away and establish herself independently as a great immortal clan.

‘Chi Buzi… that cold-hearted, parentless madman…’

Her expression darkened. Yuanxiu, however, seemed lost in thought. With his lifespan nearing its end, the old man’s usually stern and stoic face showed more emotion. "The Cold Qi divine ability, 'Serene Listen'," he said wistfully. "To select this superior technique for you, Yuansu went so far as to ally with Tianwan. He mastered it decades ago, and now you too have refined this Life Divine Ability. There is a matter in the north that requires your attention."

Seeing Ning Wan frown, Yuanxiu casually explained the situation. "I suppose you haven't heard... The Li Family is now a Purple Mansion Realm Immortal Clan. A Moongaze Immortal Clan, no less! If you pass through their territory, you might as well pay them your respects."

Suspicion colored Ning Wan's features. "A Purple Mansion Realm Immortal Clan... you don't mean Li Xizhi?"

A complicated light flickered in Yuanxiu's eyes. "It is Li Xizhi's younger brother, Li Ximing. He was once an unknown figure, but it seems he was hiding his true strength, cultivating diligently until he mastered the Bright Yang divine ability. He is known as Zhaojing. He is also an alchemist, though I do not know how skilled."

"From the looks of it, Bright Yang is not a path that excels in alchemy. He cannot be compared to Qing Tangyin. I estimate he is at the level of a Hengxing."

Ning Wan’s brows arched in pleasant surprise. Geographically, the Li Clan was a natural ally for Azure Pond Sect, and their two families had always maintained a good relationship, built upon the bonds of their ancestors and strengthened by marriage. How could she not be pleased? She had helped Li Chejing in the past and let Li Xuanfeng go; these were all fortuitous connections.

‘Aside from that lunatic Ning Hejing, my Ning Clan’s relationship with the Li Clan isn’t bad at all,’ she mused. ‘And Li Yuanqin was the one who pushed the Chi Family to their downfall. This is perfect.’

After some thought, she wondered if his temperament would make him a suitable ally. The world was full of eccentrics, after all. "This Daoist Master Zhaojing," she couldn't help but ask, "what is his character like?"

Yuanxiu narrowed his eyes. "Pure, kind, and gentle, holding no grudges. He cultivates Bright Yang with introspection, not aggression, much like the ancient cultivators of the Cui Clan. He is soft-hearted but discerning, benevolent and compassionate, and devoted above all to the legacy of his clan's ancestors."

Ning Wan nodded repeatedly. Yuanxiu did not have many days left; he had no reason to deceive her on such matters. His judgment of character had always been uncannily sharp and was worth considering. "To have such a Purple Mansion Realm master nearby," she said, "is truly a blessing for Azure Pond."

Yuanxiu grunted, a sneer touching his lips. "Without Chi Wei, Azure Pond would have had many more blessings..."

"My life is almost over. I once forced Li Xuanfeng to consume a pill that destroyed his path to the Purple Mansion Realm. Li Ximing will never trust me. You are far more suited to lead Azure Pond than I. The one currently managing the sect's affairs is a junior from Yuandao's line—from the Nine Mounds Dantai Clan. In the future, Azure Pond will not lack for Purple Mansion Realm masters. It falls to you to lead them."

Ning Wan knew she could not escape the orbit of Azure Pond. But to become a generational leader of the Azure Pond of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition was an incredibly advantageous position for her own lineage. With this shift in status, her perspective changed as well. "A senior from Yuandao? That is also fate... Although the Supreme Mound follows the Supreme Yin Daoist tradition, they share a root with Azure Pond. Senior Yuandao once studied here, and now one from the Dantai Clan repays that debt. It is a fitting arrangement."

At the mention of Yuandao, Yuanxiu’s emotions grew complex. He lowered his head. "Did you ask? Qing Tangyin... has he truly been reincarnated?"

Ning Wan nodded silently. Yuanxiu's gaze turned cold. "Zhang Tianyuan has also fallen. He was once a nobody, not worth a second glance, good only for bullying clan cultivators. Yuansu never gave him a thought."

Ning Wan had no desire to be entangled in their old grievances. That generation of Purple Mansion Realm masters had all advanced in unison due to the Immortal Mansion's inheritor, and their relationships were a tangled web of favors and feuds. She simply rose from her seat. "I will go and oversee the matter in the north immediately."

"My breakthrough will be at the Shitang," Si Boxiu said.

She transformed into a flurry of frost and coalesced at the cave entrance, her white robes fluttering. Just as she was about to leave, his words struck her as odd. A rumbling, whooshing sound of wind began to build behind her.

*Whoosh!*

The rustle of trees echoed from behind. Ning Wan froze, glancing slightly over her shoulder.

The damp scent of the forest washed over her, and the chirping of crickets grew louder. She saw the old man on the throne struggling to his feet, his hands gripping the armrests, his chest heaving forward as if an endless gale was blasting out from behind him.

Yet Ning Wan felt not the slightest breeze.

*Chirp... Chirp...*

The gale behind the old man pulled his clothes taut against his front, the loose robes revealing Si Boxiu's thin, withered frame. His two knees moved inward, fusing together. His flesh sprouted roots, binding his legs into one, while his feet lengthened unnaturally, crawling across the floor.

He snapped his head up, a gurgling sound escaping his throat. Only then did Ning Wan notice what was wrong.

A slick, dark brown cricket was perched in Si Boxiu's pupil.

Its two greenish-black antennae extended out of the eye socket, waving lazily. Si Boxiu seemed unaware of the insect in his eye. He was completely focused, his lips pressed tightly together as the limbs of some foreign object repeatedly tried to push out from between them, only to retract as if in pain.

Ning Wan’s pupils widened.

Si Boxiu’s normal eye noticed her gaze, and a flicker of hope appeared within it. His left hand, now sprouting more branches and leaves, held fast to the armrest while his right hand suddenly let go.

With that release, most of his body lifted into the air, like an old tree in a storm with only a few roots left clinging to the soil. He waved his now-free hand at Ning Wan.

She still felt no wind. Her spiritual sense and divine abilities detected only calm within the cave; the pool below was without a single ripple. Yet Si Boxiu was utterly exhausted. The hand he had freed, now restored to its normal, wrinkled appearance, gestured toward her. He curled four fingers, leaving only his index finger extended, pointing. Then, the old man’s mouth gaped open. In that instant, countless green insects flew out, taking wing. Ning Wan saw clearly that the inside of his mouth was like wood grain, rigid and unyielding.

But he bared his snow-white teeth and, like a pouncing tiger, bit down viciously on his own finger.

*BOOM!*

The Body Divine Ability of the Upright Wood path was incredibly resilient. The impact was like a thunderclap, sending sparks and violet lightning erupting. The old man raised his head, his one normal hand still facing him, but the index finger was gone.

Even one as composed as Ning Wan could not help but stumble back two steps. She watched as Si Boxiu offered a meaningful smile, the severed finger still held in his mouth. Slowly, his left hand released its grip.

"Ah?"

Finally, Ning Wan felt the wind. It was a roar louder than the preceding thunderclap. Her robes whipped about her as the old man, light as a bird, shot out of the cave with a *whoosh*.

She didn't even have time to react. She turned her head dazedly, watching Si Boxiu soar into the sky.

He flew higher and higher, not in a straight line south, but circling like an agile sparrow, spiraling diagonally toward the southern horizon.

The old man used neither dharma power nor divine ability. He simply held his arms out to his sides, carefully maintaining his balance, until he became a tiny black dot against the sky.

A green rain began to fall.

Ning Wan stood amidst the swirling wind and rain, her dress swaying. She held out a hand, palm up, catching the emerald droplets. Fear still lingered in her eyes, but it was being rapidly overtaken by a profound confusion.

The rain quickly formed a small green puddle in her palm. The woman stared at it, murmuring, "Pristine Water… How is this possible… This is Clear Dusk Rain. Why is it raining… why is the Clear Dusk Rain falling?"

"His path is Upright Wood!"

But she had no time for questions. Si Boxiu, the Great Daoist Master of the Azure Pond Sect, the foremost master of the Upright Wood path in this age, the number one talisman master in Jiangnan—today, he sought Fruition Attainment!

She raised a hand and flicked a finger. The great bell beside her immediately began to sway.

*DONG! DONG! DONG!*

The urgent tolling of the bell resounded throughout the Azure Pond mountain range. The sound of panicked footsteps drew closer. Ning Wan remained on the peak, gazing at the descending green rain. The Sect Master, Dantai Jin, practically scrambled to her side, prostrating himself without a moment's hesitation or question. "Greetings, Daoist Master!" he cried out in alarm.

Ning Wan glanced down at him. "You are the Sect Master," she commanded. "Whether to see our senior off or to broaden your own horizons, you should accompany me."

***

The Southern Sea, North Dan Island.

Upon the Ten Thousand Mile Shitang, the waves churned violently. When Ning Wan tore through the Great Void and arrived, the sky was already a maelstrom of roiling black clouds.

She looked up and could see the black dot circling high above. Group after group of cultivators stood in mid-air, their faces a mixture of awe and terror as they stared at the heavens.

The entire sea was in turmoil, great waves swirling on its surface. The sky grew darker, and the magical winds became harder to control, forcing some cultivators to descend. All colors faded from the world, save for the brilliant lights of divine abilities that pierced through the Great Void to hang suspended in the air.

Ning Wan stood her ground as the gale swept past. Beside her, Dantai Jin was shaking, his mind a complete blank as he stared at the circling dot in the sky.

‘Senior Yuanxiu? Is he attaining his Dao?’

‘Why so suddenly?!’

Before he could think further, snow-white clouds began to form beneath his feet. Thunder cracked across the sky. Dantai Jin looked into the distance and saw dozens of radiant lights within the storm clouds—at least several dozen Purple Mansion Realm masters had gathered around the sea of the Shitang, ascending together into the highest heavens.

A fine, dense static began to fill his ears. Dantai Jin realized the green rain was falling here as well. Now that they were closer to the zenith, he could finally see the old man circling in the sky.

‘This… Old Senior…’

The Yuanxiu that Dantai Jin knew had always been meticulous and composed. The man he saw now was hunched over, soaring with outstretched arms. His eyes were terrifyingly wide, with several black crickets crawling across his pupils, and his entire body was overgrown with branches and leaves. The sight was horrifying.

"Senior Yuanxiu!"

Dantai Jin watched in silence. He had not been summoned here on a whim. Yuanxiu and Yuandao had made arrangements long ago; he had been chosen at the age of six to become Yuanxiu’s disciple. He respected this old man more than his own father, who was always in seclusion.

But the old man who had picked him out from all the other Dantai children seemed to have vanished long ago.

Dantai Jin felt dizzy from the sheer number of divine ability projections in the sky. Ning Wan, however, suddenly looked up toward a nearby point. Two figures, one behind the other, had appeared on a cloud, their forms indistinct.

Ning Wan knew they were from the Underworld. With Si Boxiu in his current state, no one was there to greet them, but the two paid it no mind. They watched the circling Si Boxiu from afar.

"Such audacity!" one said.

The other sighed, his voice sharp. "It is as if the heavens themselves are helping him. Who would dare to leech off True Monarch Du’s authority over Pristine Water like this? It is only because the True Monarchs are all beyond the heavens, with no time to spare for this world, that he can borrow this power."

"If not for that, how could you say he has audacity? And audacity is all it is."

Ning Wan listened quietly, until a gentle voice sounded from her other side.

"He has been pushed to a dead end. If not for that, how could he seek the Dao in this manner?"

"Hm?"

Ning Wan was horrified. She was a dignified Purple Mansion Realm master; for someone to approach her undetected was unthinkable. Her body instantly dissolved into ice and snow, only to rematerialize in the same spot a moment later. "Greetings, Grand Martial Uncle," she said, looking slightly flustered.

The man beside her, dressed in an azure robe with golden tassels, stood with his profile to her, exuding an air of transcendent detachment. His pupils, however, held a faint green-blue light that seemed more demonic than immortal. He smiled faintly. "Chou-Gui Hidden Form."

Ning Wan had met this man in her youth. It was Chi Buzi, who had been missing for many years!

She gave an awkward nod. Chi Buzi was clearly explaining how he had appeared beside her so suddenly. He was a Great Daoist Master now. All Ning Wan could do was stand by his side respectfully.

‘The entire Chi Family was annihilated, Chi Zhiyun’s Grotto-Heaven was desecrated and he was murdered, yet none of that could move this Great Daoist Master. But for Great Daoist Master Si's breakthrough, he was already waiting here in the Southern Sea, without any prior sign.’

Chi Buzi completely ignored the two emissaries from the Underworld, leaving them to stand there like thin air. "Ning Wan… not bad," he said in a low, ethereal voice. "You've reached the Purple Mansion Realm as well. It seems Senior Yuansu's spiritual resources were abundant enough to benefit you."

Hearing this, the hair on Ning Wan's arms stood on end. She almost turned and fled, but Chi Buzi chuckled twice. This man followed the heartless Great Dao, and was known to be aloof and cruel, yet his laughter was pleasant to the ear. "You need not be afraid. I have no desire for the senior's meager possessions."

"The path of Upright Wood," he asked, "do you know what it is called?"

Ning Wan certainly didn't dare leave. Unsure of his intentions, she shook her head hesitantly. A smile touched Chi Buzi's face. "Dui Metal is the true position of Shen-You Metal. Likewise, Upright Wood is the true position of Jia-Yi Wood. Its full name is the 'Dedicated Path of True Mao-Xun Wood'. The name alone tells you it is a righteous and true way. To seek this path while trying to supplement it with unorthodox shortcuts? That is a fool's dream."

"And yet... the inheritance of the Upright Wood path is scarce. Forget all five branches, even gathering three is a monumental task... The Sima Family has held onto their branch for so many years, yet no one has ever achieved Fruition Attainment with it."

"So, Senior Yuanxiu could only seek an unorthodox supplement. I do not know how he obtained the Pristine Water, but he intended to use it to temper the Upright Wood, in hopes of attaining a certain Wood Virtue."

He finally raised his eyebrows, a trace of melancholy in them. "He has no certainty, no method to seek the required Metallic Essence, only a sliver of speculation. He can do nothing but offer his own body to this path."

Ning Wan lowered her head silently. The storm created by the old man in the sky was growing more terrifying. He raised his head, his eyes bulging as he stared directly at the heavens.

His lips moved, and he finally spat out the severed finger.

The moment the finger left his mouth, it transformed into an infant, then a boy, and in the next instant, a dashing young man who bore a strong resemblance to Si Boxiu. This was undoubtedly him in his youth. The two figures activated their divine abilities and sat facing each other. In the sky, wood and water energies clashed, shaking the very heavens.

After a long moment, one of the blurry figures from the Underworld finally looked away, shaking his head in disappointment. He took out a net-like object, hiding it in his hand. "A pity. He doesn't know you can only spit that out *after* you succeed."

The other watched with cold eyes. "How could he know? He is no True Monarch Du Qing. And how many like True Monarch Du Qing are there in this world? True Monarch Du Qing only succeeded because he learned the methods of his predecessors. This man has no true inheritance. To borrow the power of Pristine Water at all is already impressive."

"And what if he did know? He wouldn't have the ability to succeed and then spit it out. If he had that kind of power, he wouldn't be in a state where he can't even greet us."

One of them seemed to catch something from the air, passing it to his other hand before scattering it outwards. Ning Wan noticed nothing, but Chi Buzi had already taken a step back, his expression complex as he watched the seeker in the sky.

Si Boxiu was rapidly withering. His hunched body curled into a dark ball like a pill bug, his high-quality robes being torn to shreds within it. Meanwhile, the younger man grew taller and more imposing. A triumphant smile spread across his face. He raised a fair hand and snapped his fingers.

*SNAP!*

All the wind, wood, and water energies between heaven and earth surged into his body.

His clothes became increasingly ornate and noble, while black veins spread across his face. His height continued to increase, and his appearance began to warp.

The man scanned his surroundings, then suddenly reached out and lifted the frail Si Boxiu. "You walked a true path," he laughed. "Why did you seek another?"

The crickets in Si Boxiu's pupils finally broke out, crawling down his cheeks. His lips parted and closed, forming silent words as the last wisp of life flowed from his body into the other's.

"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"

The man's appearance was magnificent, but the laughter that erupted from his throat was sharp and horrifying. The nearby Purple Mansion Realm masters all retreated a step. The two blurry figures vanished, and the last ray of sunlight disappeared from the world.

"Abomination!"

*BOOM!*

A massive thunderclap shook the world. The winds howled, and sheet after sheet of lightning illuminated the sky. In the piercing flashes of light that broke the darkness, a figure could be faintly seen standing in the east.

He had the appearance of a young man, tall and slender, with an unnaturally handsome face and faintly red pupils. He wore a black robe, with a white and green sash tied at his waist, his long black hair bound behind his head.

*BOOM!*

When the next bolt of lightning flashed, the man was gone. All the radiant lights of the divine abilities over the churning sea vanished simultaneously, leaving only endless darkness and the man laughing wildly in mid-air.
