# Chapter 915: A Joyous Occasion

Just as Li Xijun and the others were deep in discussion, the jade seal on the stone table shimmered faintly. It was a sign that someone had arrived outside the cave dwelling.

Li Qinghong activated a spell, causing the Chongming Profound Insight Screen to return to its original form. She stored it within her sleeve, opened the stone door, and saw Bi Yuzhuang enter with a smile.

Glancing at the Li brothers, she said, "Your esteemed family truly is brimming with talent!"

Li Xijun thanked her respectfully. Bi Yuzhuang made a few casual inquiries but clearly hadn’t come just for small talk. Her expression turned serious as she lowered her voice and said, "The affairs of Hengzhu Dao Gate have been arranged. If you’re free, allow me to explain."

She pulled out a maritime map from her sleeve and spread it out. "As defenders of these sea islands, we’re meant to remain stationed at the main island and make our presence known. But although Wang Fu is powerful, he is outrageously indulgent and lustful. Rather than guarding the main hall on Qingzhou Island, he relocated and constructed a grand palace on Xifeng Island. Only a few close confidants come and go, making his whereabouts difficult to track.

"Fortunately, he’s quite attentive to the reefs near Qingzhou Island. Despite his debauchery, he never skips his inspections of the reefs. He frequently sails with his favored concubines, often unclothed, seeking pleasure across the sea..."

Clearly familiar with the man, Bi Yuzhuang said softly, "Our gate possesses a dharma artifact called Flow Water Conch, forged from the body of a demonic creature that failed to ascend to the Purple Mansion Realm. While it lacks offensive power, it can manipulate water currents."

What a treasure!

Li Qinghong was quietly envious. Manipulating water currents was entirely different from mere water control. With this treasure, one could reach frightening speeds along the seafloor, as if they were riding the current itself.

"This artifact leaves no trace of mana. We’ll first stir the water currents to draw him north. Then, we’ll stage a battle between a demon general and a rogue cultivator, feigning a chase over a Lesser Yang spirit item. He certainly won’t miss such an event and will pursue them."

After hearing this, Li Qinghong paused to think, then replied, "I’ve heard he possesses a bell, a sword, and a pearl. The bell is called Morning Wu, capable of seizing the spirit; the sword, Level Beam, is a Lesser Yang treasure; and the pearl, Gathered Clarity, can perceive things near and far. We’ll need to be cautious."

Since the Li Family was also determined to seize the item, they naturally wanted nothing to go wrong. Li Xijun reminded softly, "Senior, Wang Fu is indeed formidable. It’s said he’s adept at reading others. Typical chase-and-deception tactics may not fool him."

Li Qinghong had learned this through hearsay, but Li Xijun had observed Wang Fu’s behavior firsthand. His reminder was deliberate. Bi Yuzhuang nodded and thought to herself, So the Li Family has studied the man this thoroughly... It seems they’ve long had designs on what Wang Fu possesses.

She smiled. "Naturally. To prevent him from seeing through the ruse, the rogue cultivator is being deliberately lured into the act. The demon general is a carefully selected fish demon, and that demonic creature knows nothing about the real plan."

A sly glint appeared in Bi Yuzhuang’s eyes as she quietly said, "Once he obtains the treasure and is pursued by a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, he’ll surely flee to his demon den. We only need to adjust the currents so that his concubines' spirit boats head north. They’ll definitely run into each other along the way.

"Wang Fu is infamous and ruthless. When the fish demon sees him, he’ll realize he won’t make it back to the den. He’ll flee in the opposite direction from Qingzhou, hoping Wang Fu will worry about the main island and let him go."

She said softly, "That way, everything appears genuine. The more he observes, the more convincing it becomes. All we need to do is lie in ambush opposite of Qingzhou Island. My gate also has a dharma artifact called Tidal Veil, which excels at concealing movement and evading detection."

Li Qinghong reviewed Bi Yuzhuang’s plan once again and replied, "It can't have been easy selecting that fish demon. Sorry for the trouble, Senior."

Bi Yuzhuang let out a soft laugh and responded, "Don’t worry. This fish demon is clever enough and fast in water escape. Only one like that is worthy of being used as a chess piece. Ordinary weaklings wouldn’t be fit for the role."

After going over a few more details, she said, "Wait just a few days. On the day Wang Fu leaves the island, a few of my elders will bless your team with our sect’s blessing arts, it’ll give us greater assurance."

Li Ximing and Li Xijun stepped out of the cave dwelling. Outside, the pavilion towered high, and below it, the crowds bustled under warm, golden sunlight.

Li Xijun was still lost in thought, though none of it showed on his face. Li Ximing, however, was growing increasingly burdened in spirit. He glanced at his younger brother and asked, "Do you have anything planned for now, Xijun?"

"Nothing urgent," Li Xijun answered casually, shifting the sword on his back into his arms. His gaze swept across the faces of passersby on the street, and he said quietly, "Hengzhu Dao Gate does have a solid reputation. Judging by the attire in this market, there are more rogue and family-affiliated cultivators here than in Qingzhou Island’s market. No matter where the Three Sects and Seven Gates land, Purple Mansion Realm immortal families won’t be treated badly. You can’t tell much on the surface, but rogue cultivators are shrewd. They always know where safety lies."

Li Ximing followed Li Xijun’s gaze. Li Xijun softly advised, "Brother, there’s no need to worry. We’ll do our best. I’ll go inspect the island for now."

Holding his sword, he slipped out through the side of the pavilion and made his way through the market streets, pulling out a map as he went.

The waters surrounding Qingzhou and Hengzhu Reefs were vast. The closest islands were Golden Sack Island and Yuezhou Island, but further north, near the Shallow Sea, was Crimson Reef Island’s Yihuo Reef. Among the three gates, only Golden Tang Gate had good relations with Changxiao Gate, but Golden Tang Gate had shut its doors for years and lacked the strength to intervene at the moment.

It’s just... Wang Fu’s palace surprisingly houses people from Crimson Reef Island. I only hope this won’t cause trouble when the time comes.

Though Crimson Reef Island and Changxiao Gate were said to be sworn enemies, Li Xijun had used the Immortal Mirror to observe Wang Fu’s island and had clearly seen cultivators wearing Crimson Reef robes. It seemed the hostility between the two gates was only for show, and what dealings they had behind the scenes was anyone’s guess.

Hengzhu Dao Gate’s plan for dealing with Wang Fu was quite comprehensive, but Li Xijun’s mind was still filled with thoughts, When Wang Fu leaves the island, I must first visit Xifeng Island to confirm whether he has the spirit item on him.

————

Bi Yuzhuang was extremely efficient. Several cultivators arrived quickly, and the group exited the island via a small alley in the marketplace. After flying over the sea for a while, they saw Bi Yuzhuang appear out of thin air, dressed in her crimson robe.

She was clearly in high spirits, the bright smile at the corner of her eyes impossible to hide. It was obvious she had good news.

She nodded and said, "Qinghong!"

Bi Yuzhuang seemed to be holding a faint, mist-like veil in her hand, flickering in and out of sight. When she saw the group, she tossed the fabric into the air. One corner remained in her grasp, while the rest rapidly expanded, spreading out above everyone.

A layer of white mist formed beneath Li Qinghong’s feet, condensed from the dharma artifact. She felt as if she were standing on solid ground. There were three others under the cover of the veil, two in crimson robes, and one dressed in pleated garments of blue with green patterns.

Bi Yuzhuang introduced them, "These two brothers are juniors from our gate. The elder is Feng Chong, the younger Feng Yu. They’ve studied spell arts since childhood and are highly skilled in spell arts. They’ve been training out at sea for years, so Changxiao Gate likely doesn’t know of them."

As she finished speaking, both brothers, handsome and well-mannered, responded respectfully. Since neither side was familiar and had no ties, there wasn’t much else to say.

Bi Yuzhuang then pointed to the man in blue and green and said delightedly, "This is Daoist Chen Xuanyu of the Yuyang Prefecture's Chen Family. His sword cultivation is extraordinary. But his family keeps a low profile and has never sent him out before. I happened to run into him, what a pleasant surprise!"

It was Li Qinghong’s first time seeing a cultivator from the Yuyang Prefecture's Chen Family of Yue State. Before the Xiao Family rose, the Chen Family had been Yue State’s only Purple Mansion Realm immortal family. They had always kept a low profile and were actually not far from her own family.

The southern shore of Moongaze Lake lay at the northern base of Mount Dali. Tongmo Prefecture lay across the mountain to its southern slopes, and it was previously known as ancient Yuyang Prefecture. It was where the Chen Family of Yuyang Prefecture had resided for generations.

Chen Xuanyu, wearing a Daoist crown, nodded politely to her. A black-sheathed dharma sword hung at his waist, matching quite well with his blue robes patterned in green. Yet instead of lingering on her face, his gaze drifted quickly and fixed itself on Li Xijun, refusing to move away.

The Yuyang Prefecture's Chen Family! So all these families really are only cordial on the surface.

Li Qinghong had never heard of any known conflict between the Yuyang Prefecture's Chen Family and any other family. She hadn’t expected them to be involved in something as serious as hunting down a direct descendant of Changxiao Gate! Moreover, this man made no attempt to hide it. It was likely that the feud between the Chen Family and Changxiao Gate was already common knowledge among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

She drew a quiet breath and returned the gesture with a cupped-fist salute, "Greetings, Daoist friend."

A bit more satisfaction appeared beneath her already radiant expression as Bi Yuzhuang smiled and said, "I hadn’t expected things to go so smoothly. Originally, with either Daoist Chen or Qinghong taking action, combined with the formation, I’d have had over seventy percent chance of keeping him here...

"But to think Daoist Chen happened to be passing through and agreed to assist, Wang Fu is truly facing a karmic tribulation, with nowhere left to run!"

Li Xijun didn’t believe a word of her 'passing through' story, but he did let out a breath of relief. Now that a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Chen Family was backing them, the risks of this mission had dropped significantly.

Bi Yuzhuang, however, beamed at the two and said gently, "Everything’s going so smoothly, we may not even need Ximing or Xijun anymore... Your esteemed family members could simply observe and return to oversee the family affairs. That would be just as valuable."

"Brother..."

Just as Li Xijun felt reassured and was about to continue, he was cut off by Li Ximing, who respectfully said, "Xijun’s cultivation is still lacking, it’s better to send him back. I, however, have some suppressive techniques. I’ll stay to lend a hand just in case. Letting that man escape would be a regrettable outcome."

Li Qinghong nodded and gave Li Xijun a few parting instructions. The white-robed youth took several moments to think it through and silently thought to himself, That’s just as well. I ought to inspect the island myself. If by chance he’s arrogant enough to leave the Purple Mansion Realm spirit item there, it might require further scheming. Coming and going again would be a waste of time. It’s better I watch it personally and eliminate the final thread of uncertainty.

In the end, he nodded and said, "Very well."

No sooner had he spoken than Chen Xuanyu finally opened his mouth. His tone was gentle, tinged with a hint of regret, "I’ve heard you’ve refined your Sword Essence, little friend. It’s my first time seeing a Dao of Frost and Snow Sword Essence in Jiangnan. As a descendant of a Sword Immortal, I had hoped we might spar and sit together to properly discuss swordsmanship."

Ever since breaking through to Sword Essence, Li Xijun had yet to grasp even a thread of its elusive Sword Intent. When he heard that Chen Xuanyu’s sword Dao was astonishing, he too was eager to exchange insights.

He replied readily, "Rest assured, Senior! Once this matter is resolved, I’ll visit you in Tongmo Prefecture or the Eastern Sea!"

He bowed to each of them in turn and departed, riding a flurry of snow. Bi Yuzhuang turned to look at Li Qinghong and praised, "I see that his thoughts are meticulous and his sword Dao remarkably gifted. He truly has the bearing of a sword immortal, how delightful and praiseworthy."

Li Xijun’s appearance was flawless, and his attitude and thinking were both pleasing to elders. It was no wonder Bi Yuzhuang spoke so favorably. Her words brought Li Qinghong out of her silent pondering, and she quickly offered thanks.

"Seeing this youth, one can imagine the Celestial Moon Sword himself," Chen Xuanyu’s words were crisp and direct, a hint of admiration in his tone.

Bi Yuzhuang, standing beside Li Qinghong, leaned in and said softly, "As we previously discussed, Qinghong, you may choose one item from Wang Fu’s belongings first. The remaining items will be divided equally among the three parties."

She sent the Feng brothers into the sea to arrange the formation. The rest of the group sat cross-legged beneath the veil of the dharma artifact, quietly waiting.

————

Moongaze Lake.

The formation glowed snowy white on Pingya Island. Several cultivators were stationed on small islands across the lake, inspecting geomantic lines or managing demonic creatures. Occasionally, small formations flared to life, and spirit boats crisscrossed the water.

Li Chengliao descended to the lakeshore on the wind, his body brimming with condensed true essence. He had retrained in the Li Family’s most treasured Radiant Essence Scripture, and his radiant and dazzling essence gave him an aura of stern authority.

Beside him, Li Chenghuai practiced the third-grade Concealment and Obfuscation Sutra, steeped in the flavor of ancient methods. Unlike his elder brother, his aura was restrained and his cultivation difficult to gauge.

He had the option to study Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique in his Qi Cultivation Realm as well. Having read both, Li Chenghuai decided against it, as many of his siblings had already chosen the Fire Virtue. Preferring subtle, understated methods, he had opted for the latter.

Since the family's Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had left for several months, the two brothers had reorganized the island’s affairs. They reappointed the Peak Manager, Peak Guardian, and Peak Overseer. Now, the Li Family operated smoothly again and even began to show traces of renewed vitality.

Most of the long-standing elders, old cultivators in the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and those stuck at the early stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm died up north. Since those who sat at the top are all gone, it was only natural for the younger ones to rise up...

Li Chengliao had lived through it himself and understood it best. The Li Family was harsh toward its extended family, while the various peaks were relatively liberal, but the family lacked everything except people. There were never enough spirit fields or spiritual resources to go around. In that sense, this grim purge was almost a blessing.

But what Li Chengliao worried about was entirely different. He asked, "According to news from the sect... where is our granduncle now?"

Li Chenghuai did some quick calculations and replied, "He should be here soon, probably within fifteen minutes."

In the months since the Li Family’s Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had gone abroad, the Azure Pond Sect’s internal situation had been in constant turmoil. Though the Chi Family had stabilized their footing, Si Yuanli was not to be trifled with.

First came three straight days of reports from the Lingu Family about demonic disturbances in the Southern Sea. People needed to be sent there, while forces guarding the Eastern Sea also had to be rearranged. Yu Su’s former strongholds saw his trusted aides either fleeing or being recalled, leaving no one to use.

Si Yuanli then sent people to stir things up further, discouraging Chi Family cultivators from traveling to the Eastern Sea. Even those who did wouldn’t dare leave the island. As a result, the waters were going unguarded for far too long. At the same time, Si Yuanli lavishly praised Li Xuanfeng and accelerated plans to have Li Xizhi oversee Eastern Sea affairs.

To make matters worse, Ning Hejing occasionally held views contrary to the Chi Family’s, forcing Chi Fubo to compromise repeatedly, leaving him overwhelmed. After much deliberation from all sides, Li Yuanqin finally had the opportunity to return to the Li Family to offer his condolences.

Li Chengliao figured that the Si Family wanted to sow discord between Ning Hejing and Chi Fubo, since Chi Fubo believed the Li Family was still worth winning over. This was the one matter on which the two factions had miraculously agreed.

Thankfully, we still have an elder here.

If not for Li Xuanxuan remaining in the mountains, Li Chengliao truly didn’t know how to face Li Yuanqin. He had once caught a brief glimpse of him at Tujun Gate. It was an impression that remained vividly in his mind, and not a good one.

He waited at the edge of the island for a while. In the sky, the edge of a Dawn Cloudliner began to glow with Heavenly Glow.

Li Chenghuai sighed and said, "The lord has arrived."
