# Chapter 934: An Audience with Suiguan

Azure Pond Peak.

The night was deep, shrouded in a gathering of clouds and mist. A cold wind rustled through the air, making the green shadows of the pines and cypresses dance upon the stone steps. A man in ochre robes moved swiftly up the path, all the way to the summit where an immortal fairy in white stood, a sword cradled in her arms.

"Greetings, Master!"

Though the man’s cultivation was high, his foundation seemed somewhat unstable, as if he had only recently broken through. He gathered his robes and bowed. Ning Wan turned her face slightly, her voice low.

"Wuning, you've come."

This man was none other than Lin Wuning, who now held a high and ascendant position within the Azure Pond Sect.

Lin Wuning's origins were distinguished—both his parents were Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, and he was the son of a peak lord—but in the Azure Pond of years past, this was hardly the top echelon. His parents had been rogue cultivators, not even ranking in the top ten below the four great families. He himself was not considered a remarkable talent and had merely practiced on Moonview Peak.

But who could have predicted the storms that would fell the forest? In the span of a few years, waves of Azure Pond Sect cultivators had perished. One after another, they fell, and the great families either died out or went into seclusion. Lin Wuning, riding on the coattails of Ning Wan's rise and possessing a clean background, found that it was his turn—a man of middling status—to preside over a grand immortal sect.

Lin Wuning bowed again before rising to stand by her side. Ning Wan’s gaze was fixed on the shifting sea of clouds below, dyed by the night and transformed by the wind. A fierce gale swept toward them, yet it could do no more than gently stir the strands of her hair.

She remembered the night Chi Wei had broken through. It had begun at dusk and ended at dawn, a night of similarly cold, clear moonlight. The only difference was that Chi Zhiyun had been the one standing beside him.

She waited a long while before finally asking, "Is there any news?"

Lin Wuning replied in a low voice, "We've investigated thoroughly. The man is called Yang Zhuo, a figure who appeared out of nowhere. He has always operated as a vigilante in the Simin region and is said to be extremely powerful. This time, he couldn't stand seeing the formation's guardians bullying the common people, so he killed the man and left."

Ning Wan was silent for a long time. "Another one named Yang," she finally said.

She slapped the Spiritual Swords in her hand, a hint of irritation in the gesture, then asked, "What lineage of Dao does he cultivate?"

Lin Wuning bowed his head slightly. "It is suspected to be one of the twelve Qis—a lineage like Purple Qi, True Qi, or Pure Qi."

Ning Wan let out a breath. "The matter with the Purple Smoke Gate in the Eastern Sea... things have changed again. The earth veins have trembled for the second time. The Changxiao Gate has sealed its mountain, yet there has been no word from the Hengzhu Immortal Dao. Something is definitely amiss... Send someone to Purple Smoke Gate and inquire about providing assistance."

"Yes..."

Lin Wuning looked up again, his voice soft. "A message has arrived from Crimson Reef Island. They hope Master can make a trip... Daoist Master Tianwan... wishes to have a word with you."

Tianwan's divine ability was not insignificant; she was a Great Daoist Master of the Cold Qi lineage and also Ning Wan's senior. For her to make such a request showed great respect. Yet the Qiuhu fairy appeared troubled, her voice tinged with reluctance.

"Just reply to her that I was injured in the north and have not yet recovered. Tell her that once I am healed, I will personally visit the island to pay my respects."

The Ning family held no great grudge against Crimson Reef Island. In fact, the only faction in the Azure Pond with a blood feud against them, Yuanwu Peak, was now a mere shadow of its former self, lacking not only a Purple Mansion Realm expert but even having its Dao lineage severed. Still, unsolicited kindness was either a trap or a ploy. Ning Wan’s guard was raised.

‘It’s either about Li Quantao’s affair, or it’s another scheme to force open the Snow Wings Mountain Gate. Either way, it’s trouble... In these turbulent times, it’s best to delay for as long as possible.’

She fell silent for a long moment. A figure ascended from the base of the mountain, clad in a black robe and holding a jade box with both hands. He approached her with an ethereal grace, knelt on the ground, and said respectfully,

"Reporting to the Daoist Master, the item has been retrieved."

As he looked up, the cold moonlight illuminated the sharp, fierce lines of his eyes, tinged with a hint of gloom. It was Li Yuanqin, who had vanished from the public eye for a long time. He now held the jade box aloft with both hands.

"Following the clues and searching for persons of interest, I traced the trail to the last Chi Family Head, Chi Xunxiao," he reported respectfully. "By finding a letter left by one of his trusted confidants from that time, I was finally able to recover the item."

"Based on the clues I've gathered and the fragments of information from the letter, I have gradually come to understand the matter..."

Ning Wan trusted Li Yuanqin's methods and nodded for him to continue.

"This person was known for his intelligence from a young age. Back then, the Azure Pond was in turmoil, and everyone was awaiting Si Yuanli's return. Yet he quietly infiltrated the main hall. Using a secret seal from his father, Chi Zhiyan, and a hidden passage beneath the hall, he was the first to enter the secret chamber."

"It was he who took the Clarity Moon-Viewing Incantation, the Supreme Yin Breathing and Qi Refining Art, and the Glazed Heart-Mind Sutra... After leaving the chamber, he descended the mountain, sealed the items in a hidden jade box, and buried it right there in the mountainside before returning to his own courtyard."

At this, Lin Wuning silently closed his eyes. The face of that young sect master from years ago appeared in his mind, and he lowered his head further, saying nothing.

Ning Wan's expression was somber. "I know of him. It seems Chi Zhiyan must have secretly told him about it. But for a child to be so decisive... truly extraordinary!"

Li Yuanqin spoke softly, "He made his arrangements early on. Unfortunately, he was constantly monitored afterward and never dared to touch the box. Chi Fubo never imagined a mere child could pull off such a feat. He simply assumed the items in the secret chamber weren't valuable enough and that Chi Zhiyun must have hidden the real treasures elsewhere, so he never suspected the boy..."

He paused here, a note of incredulity in his voice. "It is said that while he feared his uncle would usurp his position, he was even more terrified that the jade box would be lost. Fearing that handing it over would mean his own death, he secretly instructed a loyal agent left by his father: if the day came that his uncle killed him, the agent was to dig up the box and present it to his uncle, ensuring the legacy remained in Chi family hands."

"Oh?"

Ning Wan frowned. Li Yuanqin continued, "Later, during the upheaval at Crimson Reef Island, when the news reached the sect, the main hall was surrounded, the peaks were sealed, and all flight and techniques were forbidden. Qin Xian, holding a long halberd, hesitated three times before entering the hall. Seeing him, the boy shouted, 'Is it you, uncle, who has come to harm me?' His cry made the doors and windows rattle and extinguished all the candles. Qin Xian pierced his chest with the halberd, killing him on the spot."

The Si family would certainly have involved the Ning family in such an act. Lin Wuning had been present at the time and knew this clearly. He couldn't help but shut his eyes again.

Li Yuanqin went on, "Thinking back now, he must have truly believed Chi Fubo was there to kill him, and his shout was a secret signal to his confidant... But perhaps that one sentence left the agent bewildered. In the end, the box was passed to the remaining Chi family members. Only after all these years did a clue finally surface, allowing us to obtain it."

Ning Wan stared quietly at the jade box before her, a trace of confusion in her eyes.

"He was just a twelve-year-old child at the time... With such a mind, and at the second level of Qi Refining... If the Chi clan had not been extinguished with these two generations, their brilliance today would likely be unprecedented."

She seemed to want to say more, but her beautiful eyes filled with a new unease and regret. She recalled the time Ning Heyuan had arrogantly challenged Li Qinghong at the Li estate, and how she had reprimanded him. She never expected that Ning Heyuan would fall, and that everything would unfold in a manner far more tragic than she had imagined.

Her expression grew distant as she thought back on the events of the past few years, sighing with lament.

"Countless are the geniuses under heaven, yet their rise is so often followed by their fall!"

Neither man spoke. Lin Wuning, having received his orders, quickly departed. Ning Wan took the jade box and examined it closely. Inside lay three small, light-green jade slips, none bigger than a fist, and a piece of white jade two fingers wide. With a sweep of her spiritual sense, she immediately immersed herself in them.

‘The Clarity Moon-Viewing Incantation and the Glazed Heart-Mind Sutra...’

These were both top-tier techniques, but they were regrettably restricted; only those of the Dao of the Three Yins could cultivate them. Not to mention the vast quantities of rare treasures and the exceptional talent required. Ning Wan sighed with regret but put them away with pleasure. Finally, her gaze fell upon the jade stone.

‘The legendary Supreme Yin Breathing and Qi Refining Art.’

The name was not unfamiliar to her. Daoist Master Yuansu had known a great deal and had passed much of it down. This art was said to be the ultimate Qi Refining method for the Supreme Yin lineage. Cultivating it all the way to Foundation Establishment would result in the 'Form and Shadow' attainment.

‘Legend has it that this art is even more profound than the 'Form in Transition' of Cultivation Transcendence. Once the divine ability is achieved, the main body can remain in seclusion within its cave mansion while instantly forming a Divided Aspect Body to walk the world. Unlike the illusory body of 'Form in Transition', which has a fixed cultivation level and independent spiritual sense, Li Jiangqun's Divided Aspect Body was a Moon-Glaze body that cultivated from the very beginning... Though there are limitations on its spiritual sense and cultivation speed, it is exceptionally formidable!’

Ning Wan gazed at the Supreme Yin Breathing and Qi Refining Art in her hand with boundless envy, sighing inwardly.

"What a pity that no one can use this. Not only is it impossible for anyone less than a master of great divine abilities to read or copy it, but even obtaining it doesn't mean one can cultivate it. It is said to require a foundation of the Six Wheels of the Supreme Yin, which can only be achieved by consuming both Supreme Yin Moon Radiance and the Clear Yin Womb Herb while practicing a special technique... Who knows what kind of immense fortune one would need to succeed..."

Ning Wan stood in the wind for a while longer, completely at a loss as to what to do with the jade stone. She placed it back in the box and finally turned her slightly puzzled gaze to the last jade slip.

‘Art of Awakening Glaze.’

She slowly closed her eyes and read it carefully. Then, with a turn of her hand, she made her way into her cave mansion. The aura of Pristine Water washed over her, but she bypassed this area, heading deeper into the cavern, following the direction faced by the main seat at the highest point of the Azure Pond. In a corner, she found a deep pond.

Though it was a deep pond, the water was exceptionally clear. It was situated directly beneath a stone wall. From this spot, looking back, one could see the Pristine Merging Owl Pool, the six azure jade thrones upon its bank, and their six reflections in the water. The tall main throne, in particular, seemed to look down directly upon this deep pool.

Ning Wan stared intently for a moment, then gently formed a hand seal.

Patterns on the stone wall of the cave immediately lit up, like silver-white vines growing upon the stone. They spread out, casting a cascade of silver light that made the clear pond shine even brighter.

After about fifteen minutes, a reflection slowly emerged from the once-dark water. It was a brilliant silver-white tree with delicate branches and leaves that spread continuously. The clear, gentle moonlight it emitted shone upon the woman’s face.

Hanging from the silvery branches was a lustrous white pearl of light, like a tiny moon.

Ning Wan extended a slender hand, palm up, as if holding something, though she made no visible movement. The reflection in the pool gradually dimmed. A speck of silver light materialized from thin air and suddenly landed in her hand, held aloft and hovering by her Cold Qi divine ability.

‘The Moon-Glazing Glass Tree! The Purple Mansion Realm spiritual root has borne fruit!’

Her expression was complicated as she stared at the fruit in her palm—an object so priceless that even Purple Mansion Realm experts would fight for it. For a moment, she was at a loss for words.

From her perspective, a fruit like this would be of immense help in perfecting her current divine ability. Even if she saved it, it could provide crucial assistance when she was ready to conceive her next divine ability. The Chi family’s frequent emergence of Purple Mansion Realm experts and their ease in attaining divine abilities over the years was not without reason! The Moon-Glazing Glass Tree was one of them! Chi Zhiyun, who had entered seclusion to break through back then, had also consumed this fruit. If not for the two youths who had forced open his doors and killed him, he would likely have been on the verge of attaining a new divine ability.

The Azure Pond’s reputation as a demonic sect wasn't built in a day. At least since Chi Rui's generation, their methods had been far from righteous. The Three Yuans were all ruthless, and in their early years, they were known for their tyrannical acts. Taught by their example, Ning Wan was no stickler for rules, and her own methods were not necessarily gentle. She would not hesitate to use something if it benefited her.

But the Moon-Glazing Glass Tree was said to have been grown from the flesh and blood of Li Jiangqun's dharma body. Li Jiangqun was a sworn friend of her own predecessor, Daoist Master Yuansu, and Yuansu had stood firmly on Li Jiangqun's side back then.

As Yuansu's sole successor, Ning Wan knew even more.

‘I heard from the clan elders that in his youth, the Master’s actions were even more extreme than those of Yuanwu or Yuanxiu. Yuanxiu was actually the most righteous of the three. It was only after spending a long time with Li Jiangqun that his temperament and conduct gradually improved...’

Faced with such a spiritual treasure, how could Ning Wan accept it so easily? She could only take out the jade box from her sleeve, carefully store the fruit inside, and sigh inwardly. She turned her head, her gaze lowered.

But it was that turn, that lowering of her eyes, that sent a chill rushing up from her heart to her brows, nearly making her leap up in shock.

From this position, looking back, one could see the highest, most imposing main throne.

And on that throne, which had always been empty, always cold, a man in green robes was now sitting.

The man was lounging against the seat, his slender frame giving him an air of laziness. His face had a demonic handsomeness to it, especially the long, narrow corners of his eyes, reminiscent of a snake or a flood dragon. His long, bluish-black hair was held in place by a hairpin that resembled green jade, revealing the elegant and smooth line of his profile.

He wore the green robes of an Azure Pond Sect Purple Mansion Realm expert, and the golden tassel symbolizing his status hung from his waist, swaying in the breeze. An amused expression played on his face as he smiled, his lips pursed. His pupils were a mesmerizing shade of bluish-purple, and his gaze was casually fixed on the lingering silver light on the wall directly below him.

‘When did he get in?! How long has he been here! Why did I not sense him at all! My spiritual sense swept this area—why was there nothing!’

Ning Wan's mind went blank for a second. Then, a name slowly, painstakingly surfaced.

Suiguan

It felt like an instant, and yet it felt like an eternity. With lips drained of all color, Ning Wan finally managed to speak, her voice trembling, pale, and powerless with terror.

"Greetings, Senior Suiguan."

Having said this, she finally lowered her head and bowed deeply. Her eyes downcast, her gaze fell lightly upon the Pristine Merging Owl Pool before her. The surface of the green pool remained placid, reflecting the Pristine Water patterns glowing with an azure-crow hue on the immortal throne above—which was completely empty.

‘The Pristine Merging Owl Pool cannot reflect him.’

Her voice was like a kite with a broken string, swaying powerlessly in the air. The man on the throne above continued to stare at the wall. After a few beats of silence, he casually shifted his gaze to her, his voice condescending.

"Oh? So Si Boxiu is dead too."
