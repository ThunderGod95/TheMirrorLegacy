# Chapter 523: Setting Out for the Eastern Sea

Li Yuanjiao sat in the mountains, reading the Law of Celestial Moon for a while before taking a moment to reply to Li Xizhi's letter, informing him of the situation back home.

The Li Family was preparing to head overseas, and with their current strength, capturing a Foundation Establishment Realm demon creature to be used for requesting talisman qi for Li Xizhi would not be too difficult. Li Yuanjiao had been thinking about this and decided to write to ask if they could carry out the task.

He waited for over a month, but Kongheng had not yet returned. Instead, a letter from Li Xizhi arrived first.

"...I have already broken through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and my foundation is solid. I should be able to reach the eighth heavenly layer in three to five years. After taking some pills, I will be able to touch upon the Foundation Establishment Realm. Using that qi to increase my cultivation now would be a waste. It would be better to wait until I reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, and then I will return home."

Li Yuanjiao understood Li Xizhi's point and nodded in approval. As a disciple of an immortal sect, Li Xizhi still had many spells and techniques to learn and was in no rush to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. He could even afford to delay it for a while longer. Thus, Li Yuanjiao dismissed the idea of requesting talisman qi for him and decided to wait until his son achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Reflecting on the passage of time, Li Yuanjiao suddenly realized that Li Xizhi was already thirty-five years old. He felt a moment of surprise, then realized that he himself was over fifty, though his early advancement in the Qi Cultivation Realm left him still looking like a man in his early mid-thirties.

"What a shame the repeated injuries have delayed my cultivation. Otherwise, I would have reached the edge of the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm by now..." Li Yuanjiao said as he let out a sigh.

Li Yuanjiao's talisman qi had significantly enhanced his speed of cultivation during the Qi Cultivation Realm, but since the Foundation Establishment Realm only had three stages, its effects had not manifested yet, leaving him feeling somewhat behind.

"Well... it is inevitable."

He held a pale purple jade slip in his hand when a tall, broad-shouldered man with a square face approached him. In a respectful tone, he said, "Xicheng greets the ancestor."

Li Xicheng had already reached the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. He had been diligent and meticulous in his duties over the years, never making any serious mistakes.

In a gentle tone, Li Yuanjiao asked him a question, to which Li Xicheng replied, "Reporting to Ancestor, something has happened at the devil lair in the east... I had stationed people to keep watch, and although it has been quiet for the past few years, there was constant fighting early this morning. Blood was spilled and the sounds of battle echoed through the sky. The returning scouts reported that the devil lair has been destroyed."

"How many people were involved?" Li Yuanjiao asked.

Li Xicheng hesitated before replying, "Just one."

"A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator?" Li Yuanjiao frowned.

Li Xicheng replied cautiously, "It is said that the man came from the east. The devil cultivators in the lair swarmed him, but he killed nearly all of them, leaving only three or five that managed to escape."

Upon hearing this, Li Yuanjiao frowned even deeper.

"Not of the Foundation Establishment Realm..? Then he must be a Qi Cultivator..."

The devil cultivators were not fools. If they had encountered a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, they would have fled immediately rather than fight. If it had been a proper Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, there would not have been any survivors at all.

Li Xicheng nodded slightly and added, "The man wielded a golden hammer and breathed fire, fighting the devil cultivators for quite some time before scattering them. He might be a cultivator from the Eastern Sea..."

Just as he finished speaking, a purple bolt of lightning descended from the sky. Li Qinghong emerged from her seclusion, looking radiant and full of energy. Li Yuanjiao waved for Li Xicheng to leave and fell into deep thought.

Li Qinghong stopped Li Xicheng and listened closely to his report before letting him go. She then remarked, "Zhang Yun personally escorted someone and went out of his way to intimidate the nearby families, ensuring they would not interfere... It seemed he was expecting that man to show up!"

Li Yuanjiao nodded and analyzed further, saying, "Perhaps they intended to deliver some cultivation technique or dharma artifact to that person, setting up this scenario deliberately. Leaving such obvious clues was a clear ploy to pass the item into his hands. It was likely part of the Golden Feather Sect's plot... they were either targeting someone or manipulating him."

The Li Family, having become a clan, had learned over the years how to navigate the schemes of the three sects and seven gates. In the past, they were inexperienced and got caught up in the schemes, but now Li Yuanjiao could see through them immediately.

He sighed, contemplating, "When Maha set up their trap years ago, I am sure other clans saw our Li Family the same way... All we could do was remain silent, waiting in fear to see how things would unfold."

Li Qinghong nodded, now fully understanding. Whoever that person was, the Li Family would not dare to get involved, lest they bring ruin upon themselves. She spoke softly, "As long as there is an outcome, that is all that matters. With the devil lair dealt with and Zhang Yun gone, we can finally relax a little."

The siblings both sighed in relief. Just then, Kongheng arrived, looking travel-worn as he descended into the formation on a gust of wind. He chanted a Buddhist verse and said, "This humble monk is pleased to have fulfilled his duty."

Li Qinghong accepted the letter being handed to her, glancing briefly at the monk who delivered it. He lowered his gaze, a slight sheen of sweat on his forehead. After a few polite words, he hurriedly withdrew from the mountain.

Li Qinghong raised an eyebrow but said nothing. Beside her, Li Yuanjiao merely glanced at the letter before reading through it quickly.

It was from Kong Tingyun. Her handwriting was elegant, and her tone casual. She began the letter by launching into a tirade against Situ Mo, calling him treacherous and deceitful, devoid of honor and loyalty. She then warmly invited the Li Family to visit her, mentioning that it would be a good way to vex Situ Mo.

Her tone felt as if she were smiling while saying it, without any sense of distance. At the end of the letter, she added, "Toward the end of June, a group of disciples from the sect will head overseas. If it is convenient, Brother Yuanjiao, why not join them and offer some protection to our disciples? It will save me another trip."

Not a bad idea, Li Yuanjiao thought, nodding quietly to himself. If they could travel alongside members of Profound Peak Gate, it would be safer, especially against any potential scheming from the Buddhist cultivators.

Li Qinghong took the letter from him and, after a brief glance, smiled and said, "Kong Tingyun seems quite agreeable."

Her almond-shaped eyes briefly lingered on her brother's face. Seeing that Li Yuanjiao's expression remained unchanged as he pondered and planned, she quietly exhaled in relief, thinking to herself, Sister-In-Law's talent is slightly inferior. She's only at the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Once she breaks through, I should give her a talisman pill. Although my brother and his wife share deep affection, they shouldn't be too far apart in strength...

Li Qinghong had known Xiao Guiluan for many years and had grown quite fond of her. Li Yuanjiao, being upright and impartial like his granduncle Li Tongya, had never granted Xiao Guiluan any special treatment or resources. It was only Li Qinghong who occasionally sent her some pills.

As Li Qinghong was lost in thought, Li Yuanjiao quickly noticed her distraction and asked a question. She shook her head, snapping herself out of her own thoughts. Only then did Li Yuanjiao say, "The agreed date is approaching. Let us pack up and head out together."

Li Qinghong, still holding her spear, replied, "There is nothing much for me to pack. Let us go!"

Li Yuanjiao then summoned the brothers—Li Xicheng and Li Xijun—along with Li Wushao, instructing them to manage the household carefully and avoid any rash actions.

Only after ensuring everything was in order did he and Li Qinghong, along with Kongheng, rise into the sky, riding the wind.

Fearing any potential interference from Buddhist cultivators, they traveled quickly. By dawn the next day, the Profound Peak Gate's territory in Shanji Prefecture soon came into view.

An elderly man greeted them, his appearance plain with two small moles on his face. His body, adorned with various jade pendants, clinked as he moved. He greeted them with a hearty laugh, "Kong Yu of Profound Peak Gate greets fellow Daoists!"

Years ago, when Kong Yu was invited by Li Xuanxuan to move mountains for the Li Family, he had told him about the One Stick of Incense Clan. This man could be considered a friend of Li Xuanxuan. At that time, Li Yuanjiao was in seclusion and had not met him, but Li Qinghong had.

"Greetings, Senior," she replied politely.

"Ah! Please do not call me that. You are flattering me too much!" Kong Yu smiled wryly.

When he first visited the Li Family, Li Qinghong was still in the Qi Cultivation Realm, and it had been reasonable for him to act like a senior. Now, in the blink of an eye, she had become a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, and Kong Yu dared not act overly familiar, humbly declining the honor and asking, "How is Daoist Xuanxuan faring?"

"My father is in good health," Li Yuanjiao replied. After exchanging a few more pleasantries, several young disciples flew up from below, all at the Qi Cultivation Realm.

They gazed at the two of them with admiration and greeted them respectfully, "Greetings, Seniors!"

Li Qinghong, still looking youthful, was dressed in jade armor and silver boots, exuding a heroic spirit. The male disciples of Profound Peak could not help but stare, clearly both in awe and fear, making Kong Yu visibly embarrassed.

"Naturally, no one dared to look at Li Yuanjiao, whose more mature appearance gave him a villainous air. He quietly observed the group of disciples, thinking to himself, Their cultivation is even lower than Xijun's, and they don't look like disciples from a major sect... They must not be from the sect's core lineage."

After everyone had gathered, they set out swiftly, riding the current downstream, heading toward the Eastern Sea.

————

Wutu Peak.

Li Ximing slowly exhaled, and it seemed as though two bright flames flared up in his eyes, flickering and rising before turning into a golden light that gradually faded into nothingness. With a light inhale, he swallowed the Long Marching Fire Essence before him into his belly.

Two years ago, he had taken a talisman pill to break through to the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Afterward, he diligently cultivated, refining his strength, and now his cultivation was fully consolidated.

Li Tongya's generation lacked medicinal pills, and refining one's cultivation was a slow and painstaking process that could take three to five years. By Li Ximing's generation, however, pills were much more plentiful. Li Ximing himself had no shortage, so his progress was swift.

With a flick of his hand, he revealed a jade bottle containing an Essence Gathering Pill and thought to himself, Brother Zhi gave me this pill... but I don't really need it. It would be better to leave it for Xijun...

Li Ximing was not one to boast, but when it came to cultivation, he was brimming with confidence. His heart was set on the Dao, and he had a spirit fire from heaven and earth in his belly. Over the years, through the practice of dual cultivation and absorbing fire, he had faintly sensed that he was in alignment with this path, giving him a strong assurance of success in reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Despite his confidence, Li Ximing hesitated. Failing to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm meant the end of one's life and Dao. If it were anyone else, even with a ninety-nine percent chance of success, he would keep the matter to himself and not risk letting it slip.

But Li Xijun was not just anyone. In Li Ximing's life, there were very few things he truly cared about, and Li Xijun, the younger brother who visited him earnestly every day, was one of them. It was difficult for him to part with that bond.

Gritting his teeth, Li Ximing placed the jade bottle on the table, resisting the urge to take it. He locked the door behind him and turned to leave.

In front of him stood Meng Zhuoyun, her black hair flowing loosely, with the ends tied in a red ribbon and adorned with a small blue-gold orchid. Needing a distraction from the Essence Gathering Pill, Li Ximing pulled her into his arms.

Meng Zhuoyun pouted slightly but began to undress, almost out of habit. Li Ximing muttered under his breath while she remained passive, hesitant as though making a decision.

Suddenly, she asked, "Brother Ming, will you keep me?"

Li Ximing frowned, as though repeating himself for the hundredth or two-hundredth time, "You can handle it on your own."

Lost in his own thoughts, Li Ximing's actions were automatic. Their bodies had long since become accustomed to each other, moving naturally, yet both were distracted. Meng Zhuoyun placed her hands on his chest and suddenly spoke, "Li Ximing."

It was the first time she had called him by his full name, and he was taken aback. Softly, Meng Zhuoyun continued, "You are only relying on the Li Family... You think you are a genius? You are just living off the shadow of your forefathers, stripping away everything the Li Family has given you. What can you truly call your own? Hmm..?"

Sweat dripped down Meng Zhuoyun's graceful face as she panted softly, yet her eyes remained calm. She spoke in a quiet voice, "Even without a prestigious background, Li Yuanjiao could be a fierce general, Li Xijun could be a swordsman, and Li Xicheng could be a manager... But you? You are nothing but a coward."

Li Ximing closed his eyes, as though her words had touched a sore spot. After several breaths, he whispered, "Stop... just stop talking..."

Meng Zhuoyun pushed his hands away, exhaling deeply before saying softly, "I will be leaving."

Without hesitation, she stood up and emptied the contents of her storage pouch. Pills, secret technique manuals, paintings, and Li Ximing's clothes—all of it came tumbling down onto him.

Nearly overwhelmed by disbelief and caught completely off guard, Li Ximing watched as Meng Zhuoyun draped a robe over herself. She cast a Purification Spell on herself, then walked out of the courtyard, her black hair flowing behind her, her expression resolute.

She had barely taken a few steps forward when she saw a white-robed young man standing in the forest, blocking her path.

With sharp eyebrows and bright eyes, he held a sword in his arms. Though Meng Zhuoyun looked disheveled, her pale skin exposed, the young man respectfully averted his gaze, his expression polite.

Meng Zhuoyun shook her head gently, the blue-gold orchid in her hair glinting under the moonlight. Her soft eyes were clear and filled with defiance as she asked, "What do you want, Senior?"

Li Xijun extended his hand politely and said, "I hope you would allow me to inspect your storage pouch."

Meng Zhuoyun bowed and handed over her storage pouch. Li Xijun examined it carefully and found nothing related to his family. He apologized and returned the pouch but still did not move aside.

Left with no other option, Meng Zhuoyun cast a spell and swore a Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, vowing not to disclose any of the Li Family's secrets. Still, Li Xijun did not relent, his gaze lowered in guilt as he added softly, "I have heard that you are skilled with a painter's brush?"

Though his tone remained courteous, the Hanlin sword on his back glowed ominously. Meng Zhuoyun was not foolish and immediately understood, adding a few more assurances to her vow. Only then did Li Xijun apologize, "You have made many pills for our family over the years... It is Brother Ming's fault for treating you unfairly. This is to compensate you for all the pills you have refined."

He untied a storage pouch from his waist and respectfully handed it to her. Meng Zhuoyun's face changed, a mix of shame and frustration rising within her. But seeing the genuine sincerity in Li Xijun's eyes, she knew he did not intend to humiliate her. Silently, she accepted it and whispered, "Thank you."

With that, she soared into the sky, vanishing into the distant horizon.

Li Xijun sighed and stepped into the courtyard, which remained in disarray. Li Ximing quietly fixed his attire. Li Xijun let out a bitter laugh and said, "You made a mess, yet I have to be the one to clean it up..."

Li Ximing said nothing. Hanging high in the courtyard was a painting. In it, Li Ximing wore a smile, yet his expression was cold and emotionless. His eyes were indifferent, as though lost in deep thoughts.

Irritated by the sight of it, Li Ximing waved his hand, summoning the painting. He folded it and tucked it into his robe before waving his brother out.

Turning back, he gathered the scattered paintings in the courtyard. Suddenly losing interest, he pulled out his alchemy furnace and returned to refining pills.
