# Chapter 898: Chongming Profound Insight Screen

Lush vegetation flourished as mountain mist cascaded like waterfalls. Snow-white tendrils ghosted along the eaves, green hues forming the base, accented by swirls of dark yellow and black. The stone steps glistened, shrouded in a thin layer of white fog.

Tap.

A cloth boot stepped through the mist, revealing the intricate patterns etched into the stone steps. A man in a feathered robe wore white silk tied around his forehead. His bearing was already elegant, and iridescent light shimmered at the corners of his eyes, striking awe in all who beheld him.

The young man beside him followed half a step behind, slightly bowing with a respectful tone as he spoke softly, "Peak Master, Changtian Peak seems rather bare. Perhaps we could have some people arrange furnishings... it would help maintain appearances..."

"No need." The trailing end of Li Xizhi’s white silk fluttered in the wind. Behind him, flowing clouds painted a picturesque scene, and the immortal peak pierced the heavens like a sword. He turned his head slightly and said softly, "I appreciate the thought, but I have no need for such things. It feels more tranquil on Changtian Peak with fewer buildings."

Si Tongyi followed obediently. The two entered the hall together and took their seats in short order. The young man cupped his hands and said, "There was some dispute in the main hall regarding Lord Xuanfeng’s reward. Chi Zhihu claimed that a father’s blessing should pass to his son, and that it should go to Li Yuanqin. But my lord said that Lord Xuanfeng had instructed him to deliver the item to the Li Family instead..."

"Oh?" Li Xizhi gave a slight nod and asked, "What does Lord Ning think?"

"My lord’s view is... perhaps it’s best to set the matter aside for now. Since the spirit item cannot be easily divided, the Li Family’s tribute may be waived temporarily. We’ll summon a few of their disciples to train on the peak and grant them some dharma artifacts, then revisit the matter when Lord Zhiyun exits seclusion."

"Mm." Li Xizhi poured himself some tea but gave no response.

Si Tongyi quickly continued, "There’s no need to finalize things just yet. My lord will certainly do his best to advocate."

"Then I thank your lord sincerely." The first quiet struggle between the two sides had already played out in the main hall.

Li Xizhi said little, while Si Tongyi shifted the topic and spoke softly, "Now that Peak Master has returned, we should begin preparations for accepting disciples. You may visit the various prefectures under the Azure Pond Sect. If there are any suitable children below the mountain with sufficient innate ability, they can be brought into the peak."

Li Xizhi simply nodded and saw Si Tongyi out. Returning to the main hall, he took the letter from his sleeve and placed it on the table.

"Reward."

Li Xizhi didn’t give the reward much thought. It likely contained nothing truly useful. The Li Family’s real ambition was the Bright Yang spirit item of the Purple Mansion Realm, how could they place hope in a reward?

Neither Si Yuanli nor the Chi and Ning Families were blind. Li Ximing was already at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm and cultivating the Bright Yang. If the Li Family started searching for a Purple Mansion Realm Bright Yang spirit item now, wouldn’t that be openly declaring their intention to break through into Purple Mansion Realm? They probably couldn’t even mention it aloud.

This pursuit must remain secret... as of now, only a few seniors like Kong Tingyun of Profound Peak Gate know of it...

He sat quietly in the hall for a while before Yang Xiao'er entered from the rear of the hall and sat obediently beside him. She was from the Yang Family and had nothing to worry about. Naturally, she was using all sixty years before attempting Foundation Establishment Realm. Now at fifty-eight, she was honing her cultivation for the breakthrough.

Though nearing sixty, Yang Xiao'er looked no older than thirty, thanks to the Yang Family’s exceptional pills and cultivation resources. As the couple murmured softly to each other, someone entered from outside the hall.

"Xizhi..."

This man had bright, glowing eyes and a powerful presence. His feathered robe was rich and dignified. He nodded to Li Xizhi with words of condolence, then greeted Yang Xiao'er, "Eleventh Sister."

Yang Ruizao of the Yang Family had followed Li Xuanfeng out of seclusion in the first battle at Mount Bianyan, slain several devil cultivators, and was severely wounded. Afterward, he had remained in the sect recuperating.

Li Xizhi exchanged a few casual words with him. Yang Ruizao offered praise and lament, with a touch of sincere emotion, and sighed. "It’s a pity I was seriously injured and couldn’t help guard the river. I failed to contribute my part..."

Then he shifted the topic and shook his head. "Snow fell heavily on the peak last night. The east wind blew, then the west wind followed. Who knows when it will end?"

Li Xizhi nodded and replied, "The snow on the peak is beautiful. And since there are no commoners below the mountain, the longer it lasts, the better."

Yang Ruizao chuckled in agreement, clearly pleased with the sentiment. He raised his cup toward Li Xizhi, and the two shared silent understanding. Then Li Xizhi spoke softly, "I invited you here today, Brother-in-law, because there’s something I need to inquire about."

He picked up the letter on the table and handed it to Yang Ruizao.

Yang Ruizao accepted it and examined it. When he saw that it was written by someone from the Li Family, he was immediately pleased. Seeing how Yang Xiao'er and Li Xizhi were so affectionate, he took this act as a sign of true kinship and thought to himself, Eleventh Sister married him as a political union... and yet they’ve grown so close. That’s rare indeed.

But after reading the contents, his expression turned strange. He paused for several moments before letting out a bitter laugh and said, "Xizhi... you’ve certainly asked the right person... This Daoist He’s real name is He Ting, and as for his close friend in the sect..."

Yang Ruizao continued to chuckle as he answered, "A flood washing into the Dragon King Temple, that friend of his is none other than our family’s ancestor!"

"This..." Li Xizhi was genuinely taken aback. He set the jade cup in his hand down on the table and immediately replied warmly, "This ancestor... could it be Ancestor Tianya?"

"Exactly!" replied Yang Ruizao.

Over a hundred years ago, Mount Yue had taken root in the wilderness along the riverbank. The Yang Family’s ancestor, Yang Tianya, led troops to suppress them, and while passing by Moongaze Lake, developed a connection with the Li Family’s forebear, Li Mutian.

He had been in seclusion for over fifty years. Though there was no confirmed news, judging by the timeline, he had likely already passed. Li Xizhi did the math, this He Ting was also nearing the end of his lifespan. The timeline matched perfectly.

Yang Ruizao said gently, "Daoist He is an artifact smith with considerable skill. His presence here is no coincidence...

"He holds a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact known as the Nine Gates Temple. But it doesn’t truly belong to him. It is the artifact of Tianque Zhenren from the Golden Feather Sect."

As a family with centuries of history, the Yang Family had once even held an exalted status. Naturally, they were well-informed about such matters. Yang Ruizao explained calmly, "Daoist Master Tianque wanted a Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact, but he had a notoriously bad temper and bore grudges against the likes of Yuanwu and Hengli. After much searching, Daoist He was the one who took up the task.

"He accepted He Ting’s nephew as a disciple. In return, He Ting used the remainder of his life to forge the Nine Gates Temple. This artifact is highly unusual. It required cooperation from forty-five scattered Dao lineages to cultivate and refine it over generations. Then He Ting used his own Dao foundation to nurture it for a century, allowing a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to produce a Purple Mansion Realm artifact embryo."

"No wonder!" Li Xizhi finally understood why so many small, scattered families existed under Daoist He’s rule on the western bank, untouched for years. They had been ignored by both the Golden Feather Sect and the Azure Pond Sect, with no tribute demanded.

So it was the work of Daoist Master Tianque. He hasn’t appeared for a century because he’s been refining the artifact embryo...

Li Xizhi furrowed his brow and asked, "And now, this artifact embryo..."

If that was the case, Daoist He would indeed be a troublesome figure. Only now did Li Xizhi raise the question, but Yang Ruizao simply chuckled, "Don’t worry! It was delivered to the Golden Feather Sect long ago!"

Li Xizhi realized the expected problem no longer existed. He secretly felt fortunate that his family still had some luck, and he expressed his thanks aloud, "So there’s such a backstory. That clears up many doubts for me... Thank you, Brother-in-law!"

"No need for such formality!" Yang Ruizao waved his hand broadly and grinned. "I saw Daoist He the year I was born. He held my brothers and me in his arms. I also visited him a few times afterward. He’s a very kind and reasonable elder. Let’s go to the lake together and speak with him in person!
𝕗𝐫𝚎𝗲𝘄𝐞𝕓𝐧𝕠𝘃𝕖𝐥.𝐜𝚘𝚖

"He’s always been a decent man, and now that he hasn’t much time left, he surely won’t turn down your family’s goodwill..."

He chuckled and added, "When the end comes, you can’t take anything with you. Helping his nephew befriend a major family for free? That’s a guaranteed win for him!"

Li Xizhi nodded gently and the two began chatting freely in the hall. Yang Ruizao was a man of action and said directly, "I’m always busy. Rather than picking a day, why not strike while the iron’s hot? Let’s head to the lake now and get this matter settled."

It was clear that Yang Ruizao feared a major shift might occur once he left the sect. He was determined to resolve this matter while things were still calm and free of conflict.

The sooner Moongaze Lake was unified, the better. Li Xizhi thought the same. The two nodded, but before they could speak further, someone came in to report, kneeling in the hall and speaking respectfully, "Reporting to the Peak Master, Fei Qingyi from Yuanwu Peak has come to pay a visit!"

Fei Qingyi has broken through?

Li Xizhi tilted his head slightly, catching the flicker of surprise in Yang Ruizao’s eyes. Even someone as well-informed as him hadn’t known of her breakthrough. Fei Qingyi must have come to pay respects the moment she exited seclusion.

Li Xizhi nodded, took a sip of tea, and spoke gently, "I have an honored guest visiting and will soon be departing for the south. If she has the time, she’s welcome to join us."

Moongaze Lake, Mount Qingdu.

Li Qinghong, clad in a simple white dress, was in the dimly lit main hall atop Mount Qingdu. Her Duruo Spear rested on a rack, and a mana lamp flickered softly with its pea-sized white glow casting gentle illumination.

Her cultivation had gradually approached perfection. After years of tempering her Immortal Foundation’s Thunder Pool, she was nearing her next advancement. Though there was still some room, the bottleneck wasn’t far off.

The Dao of thunder-element breakthroughs... is likely out of reach now.

Li Qinghong had always been a seeker of the Dao, and her innate talent was far from lacking. Now, at this point, she silently contemplated her options.

Other than that grotto heaven, only the Northern and Southern Seas are known to have Purple Mansion Realm thunder arts...

The Northern Sea was rich in Profound Thunder, with several Dao lineages of thunder arts, some of which were possibly tied to Celestial Thunder. The Southern Sea’s Miao Family was also likely of the Profound Thunder lineage. But neither were options she could lay claim to.

She had once encountered Shen Yanqing and Miao Quan in the Eastern Sea. They had mentioned the Profund Thunderstone in their conversation. Piecing the clues together now, it might well be a Celestial Thunder Purple Mansion Realm spirit item.

If Shen Yanqing holds the Profund Thunderstone, the Shen Family might possess Celestial Thunder techniques, but it may not necessarily be the Profound Thunderpool.

No matter how she turned it over in her mind, the Dao to the Purple Mansion Realm seemed increasingly out of reach. Her only chance lay in the Dao of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling’s grotto heaven, which had been swallowed by the dragon clan.

She let out a quiet sigh of relief, Good thing it was swallowed by the dragon clan. Otherwise, trouble would have come to us.

Her technique, the Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique, belonged to the Dao lineage of Thunder Steering and Cloud Dwelling. More than one person had recognized it. Miao Quan, members of the Xi Family... all could identify the spell.

If they could recognize it, then the real master of the Purple Smoke Gate had long taken notice. Her technique had been passed down from Lingyanzi... but there was no need to say more. Lingyanzi might think he had concealed it well, but he had likely been exposed from the beginning!

When I met with them back then, I’m fairly certain a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master was standing nearby, silently listening in. But the grotto heaven was given to the dragon clan, with Yuan Tuan and Yuan Chengdun as keys, so even if the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master brought us in, it would’ve been useless...

Only now did she truly realize the danger she’d been living with all these years, and she sighed inwardly, I’d best settle my family matters first!

She opened her eyes, violet light flickering within them. She turned her palm over and a miniature screen about the length of a forearm, dark in color and seemingly plain, except for the thick, flowing violet lightning that lent it a mysterious and extraordinary air, appeared in her hands.

After months of effort, Li Qinghong had finally finished refining this dharma artifact. A name slowly surfaced in her mind, Chongming Profound Insight Screen.

The more time she spent refining it, the more she realized how unusual this artifact truly was. Her expression was now solemn. She rose on thunder and flew through the clear night toward the side hall.

It was late, but Li Xijun was still practicing his swordsmanship. Since he had just broken through to Sword Essence, there was far too much to absorb. He didn’t want to waste even a moment. When he saw Li Qinghong enter, he sheathed his sword and asked in confusion, "Aunt?"

"I’ve finished refining the ancient dharma artifact," Li Qinghong answered crisply. She lightly tossed the Chongming Profound Insight Screen into the hall, releasing a wave of dark teal light. It slowly unfurled and revealed its true form.

Its frame was forged from deep green-black metallic stone, adorned with archaic patterns. There were eight panels in total, each glowing faintly with concealed light. The aunt and nephew gazed upon it together as the images on the panels lit up one by one.

The screen depicted a grand palace, its halls interconnected in a way that made the viewer dizzy. On the eighth panel, beyond the hall, dark winds and green pines created a celestial atmosphere. A flight of steps led to the gate, and a figure stood outside, seemingly listening intently with his ear turned.

He wore white robes, had a refined and respectful face, and a sword hung at his waist. A crescent-moon-shaped jade pendant dangled from the sword tassel. Inside the hall, a youth in green robes and black boots, holding a book, was lounging on the outermost seat. His posture was extremely casual. His face was blank and completely featureless.

Farther in stood a woman in purple, poised and upright. A spirit screen and a violet book lay on the desk before her. Her face was also blank, just like the next four figures behind her. Then came two men, one in red, the other in white. The red-robed man was taller and stood slightly ahead. The white-robed man bore a sword, while the red-robed one held a small halberd.

Closer to the front, just beneath the main seat, was a man in a hemp robe. He wore a command token at his waist. He looked entirely ordinary and unremarkable.

The foremost figure stood beside the main throne, his face likewise blank, his sword hanging loosely at his side. Li Xijun’s gaze moved past him, settling on the main seat.

A single golden circle was drawn upon the celestial seat.

There were seven people inside the hall, yet only the man standing outside had facial features. The clothing and dharma artifacts of the others were rendered in fine detail, but their faces were completely blank. It was eerie to behold.

"This must be Chongming Hall..."

He turned to look at Li Qinghong, only to see her staring at the white-robed figure beside the celestial seat. She said nothing, her grip on her spear turning pale from tension. Violet lightning surged around her.

"Aunt?"

Sensing something was wrong, Li Xijun called out to her twice and quickly stepped between her and the Chongming Profound Insight Screen, cutting off her view as he caught her gaze.

Faint comet-like stars flickered in Li Qinghong’s grey-black eyes. It was as though she had fallen into a sea of storm and darkness. She spoke slowly, "I think... I’ve seen that person before..."
