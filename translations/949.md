# Chapter 949: A Debt of Gratitude

Li Ximing weighed the Marvelous Wisdom Whisker in his hand. Daoist Master Luo gave a dry laugh and replied, "At the moment... I don't have any Bright Yang spiritual items on me..."

It was difficult for this demon cultivator to put on airs. Back in the Shaman Kingdoms, he was a demon lord whose word was law. But out here, he was surrounded by people like Li Ximing and Dingyang Zi—famous for their alchemy or artifact refinement—or Immortal cultivators from the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition wielding multiple treasures. What could he possibly have that they would value?

He could only force a smile. "I traded my cultivation art to Daoist Friend Ning Wan, so I don't have much else to offer... However... I do have a few Bright Yang spell arts..."

Li Ximing was unimpressed. That was the one thing his own clan didn't lack. Besides, this was a demon cultivator from the Southern Borderlands; what kind of decent Bright Yang lineage could he possibly possess? He asked casually, and just as expected, they were all common goods, on the level of the Radiant Celestial Wave Art at best.

He smiled and declined. Daoist Master Luo, not daring to offer any of his own demonic cultivation methods, hesitated for a long moment. Gritting his teeth, he finally took out a white pearl that pulsed with the light of Converging Water. It was another resource for the Purple Mansion Realm, which he offered in trade.

Li Ximing wasn't so desperate as to accept just any spiritual resource. He shook his head. "Daoist Friend, I'm afraid this won't do. Fortunately, I don't have a great need for the Whisker right now, so there's no rush. My family is currently refining a suit of armor, so I'll just entrust this item to Daoist Friend Dingyang Zi. When you have something I need, or find a more suitable spiritual resource, you can retrieve it from him. If all else fails, you can find me on the lake!"

Having said his piece, he looked to Dingyang Zi. The old man's expression was calm. "That works as well. The world is unstable these days... traveling back and forth is inconvenient. I shall hold onto it for you."

Li Ximing assumed his "instability" referred to the conflict between the North and South. He offered a few polite words, silently filing away the arrangement, and then bid Dingyang Zi farewell. Calculating the time, he figured Liu Changdie was likely still in Poluoduo, so he summoned the wind and flew north.

As soon as Li Ximing was gone, Dingyang Zi's cold expression softened. He even spoke more politely to Daoist Master Luo, though his brow was furrowed.

"How many times have I told you? That item was entrusted to us by the Southern Songzhou Luoshe. It belongs to Dilu Tian Sanglin! His mastery of Southern Borderlands shamanic arts is probably unmatched. But you... you just had to ask, didn't you? You wouldn't be satisfied otherwise."

Daoist Master Luo just chuckled. "Dilu Tian Sanglin... he has a great reputation, sure, but isn't he just a traitor who sold out his friends for glory? It was just an inquiry. If he wasn't planning to defect to the Buddhist Land, why would he be causing so much trouble..."

"What nonsense is this?" Dingyang Zi frowned.

But Daoist Master Luo insisted, "If I'm lying, you can have my head!"

The crude language made Dingyang Zi wince. "That has nothing to do with you or me," he replied. "Your friend on the sea... that treasure elephant. Didn't it acquire some kind of metallic stone? You could go ask him. Better than letting this thing sit uselessly in my hands."

Daoist Master Luo laughed. "You're certainly in a hurry. One extra set of scales won't turn the tide... This is all for the sake of easing the pressure on your master's precious Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, isn't it?"

"Have you considered this? That Wei Xuanyin is already a Veiled Yin Great Daoist Master. In the Zhao Imperial Palace, there's another Veiled Yin, Zong Chang, and a Dawn Qi General, Gongsun Bei. Are you really pinning your hopes on the Li Clan to share the burden of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition? They have their hands full just dealing with Murong Yan."

Dingyang Zi's expression remained calm, and he didn't deny it. "It is enough for the White Qilin to be conspicuous and draw more attention," he said gravely. "With chaos brewing, the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition truly needs to stay out of the fray and bide its time..."

...

Baihai Creek.

The lands of the Xuanmiao Temple were now shrouded in darkness, emanating a deathly stillness. Ever since Ancestor Sumian had left with his prized disciple, Qi Qiuxin, the morale of the place had utterly collapsed. The laughter and easy-going freedom of the past were nowhere to be seen.

Two streaks of light, one following the other, arrived. They materialized as a man in black-cloud-patterned mystic robes and a woman in teal-colored garments. Qi Lanyan wore a smile.

"This is the Xuanmiao Temple. Across the river is Shanji!"

Kong Tingyun's gaze swept over Jiangnan in the twilight. In just a few days, she had caught up on much of what had happened during her long seclusion. She glanced to the west, an uncontrollable emotion rising in her heart.

"Daoist Master Zhaojing, Li Ximing... He actually succeeded!"

If one were to be precise, Kong Tingyun was the only person who had personally visited Li Qinghong to warn her that the Radiant Sky Stone must never be used by Li Ximing. Although Kong Tingyun believed her intentions were good, seeing this outcome, she couldn't help but feel a shadow pass over her heart.

'It seems Li Ximing used the Radiant Sky Stone after all. How else could he have progressed so quickly? My well-intentioned warning has become a grudge for obstructing his Dao... How can this ever be explained? Li Ximing must certainly resent me now!'

Her heart was a storm of emotions, mixed with the anxiety of seeing her kinsmen. But Qi Lanyan, who cultivated the Life Divine Ability, was exceptionally perceptive. He turned to look at her.

Kong Tingyun quickly spoke, forcing a tone of faint lament. "Senior Xiao Chuting... he has already left Jiangnan..."

"Xiao Chuting..." Qi Lanyan repeated the name, crossing his arms with a slight smile. "He built his fortune by murdering Duanmu Kui, and he's gained a lot of favor since then. It's only natural he'd move on to the Northern Sea. What's left for him to scheme over in Jiangnan?"

Kong Tingyun remained silent. They flew south together and soon arrived before Shanji Prefecture. The prefecture was shrouded in a gloomy aura, a scene of devastation, a mere shadow of its former self. When they reached the sect's main gate, they found the protective array, shimmering and transparent. Inside, the mountain range was scarred, with a peak missing here, a chunk gone there. Banners of green and red hung everywhere; it was clearly under new ownership.

Kong Tingyun lowered her gaze. Qi Lanyan stepped up to the array. Sure enough, a woman in purple robes rode the wind to meet them, stopping just short. She wore a polite, if detached, smile.

"Greetings, fellow Daoists. And congratulations, Daoist Friend Kong!"

Kong Tingyun didn't recognize the woman, but she recognized the robes of the Purple Smoke Gate. She returned the greeting politely. Qi Lanyan, however, adopted a warm expression.

"Tingyun is a disciple of my Comprehending Profoundity lineage. She achieved her Dao in Jiangbei and has come to retrieve her family."

Hearing him stress "Comprehending Profoundity disciple," Tinglan felt a deep sense of humiliation, but she kept the smile on her face. "Senior Zhu Gong is in seclusion, but fortunately, she made arrangements beforehand."

Her heart was in turmoil. She ordered her subordinates forward, and a guest elder flew up, followed by four people. At the front was an old man with deeply sunken eyes. His clothes were new and garish, and his hands were clenched nervously before him.

He seemed to have been given some potent spirit medicine, as his skin had a ruddy, healthy glow. But his eyes were wide and round, buried in their sockets, revealing an indelible panic. His body was hopelessly stooped, making him appear exceptionally small. His neck craned forward, and he tilted his head, trembling as he dared to sneak glances upward.

Kong Tingyun stared at him, stunned.

"Guxi?"

The old man looked as if he were in a dream, his lips pale, unable to speak.

When Kong Tingyun had left the sect, Kong Guxi was just a young man, known as the sect's foremost dandy. Even today, he shouldn't have been this old. But the weight of the years had completely crushed him, leaving him looking weak and broken. She hadn't even recognized him.

Behind Kong Guxi were two middle-aged people. The woman, holding a young boy's hand, had a sallow, ashen face. She was the very picture of numbness—this was the once vibrant, beautiful, and gentle Kong Qiuyan.

The man was skeletal, his eyes brimming with tears. This was Kong Xiaxiang, once known for his impulsive courage. He was holding a set of folded golden armor, upon which rested a fearsome mask, its eye sockets black and empty.

The physical torment the three had endured was nothing compared to the crushing weight on their spirits. In just over a decade, all three were like different people, huddled together as if for warmth, staring at her through the clouds with terror and disbelief.

Kong Tingyun's expression slowly changed. Her gentle, beautiful eyes quickly filled with tears. Her voice was hoarse.

"There are only... three of you left."

She looked at Kong Qiuyan, who now looked like a middle-aged matron, and asked quietly, "What is the child's surname?"

Compared to the two men beside her, Kong Qiuyan didn't show as much despair, only a profound exhaustion and confusion. "Reporting to the Daoist Master... his surname is Dai."

Qi Lanyan stood silently to the side, his gaze fixed on the low-browed Tinglan. His eyes were like cold iron, projecting a silent, powerful accusation.

'Look what you've done!'

'This is the mess your Supreme Yang Daoist tradition and your Tinglan made! You hate my Viewing Pavilion Platform for interfering, for following orders to disrupt the world's balance, but now do you see why? Look at your Supreme Yang Daoist tradition, inviting demon cultivators into Jiangnan. Are you any better?'

Tinglan's face was blank, her mind in chaos. She didn't know what to say. Should she argue that Changxi's Profound Peak was no bastion of virtue either? That Zhu Gong had already shown mercy? Or that if they hadn't invited Zhu Gong to Jiangnan, the Capital immortals Dao would have seized this place and been far more ruthless?

But it was all speculation. No matter what, she couldn't find the words. She could only say, "The Capital immortals Dao was aggressive... Zhu Gong was rash in taking in your sect's remnants. She is from the Eastern Sea, and her methods are... unrefined."

It was a reunion of choked silence. Kong Tingyun was speechless for a long time. Finally, she asked, "The disciples of Profound Peak... how many remain?"

Kong Xiaxiang was about to speak, but Kong Guxi cut him off, his voice raspy. "The sect was annihilated. Fortunately, we received Daoist Master Zhaojing's protection. This junior disbanded the disciples himself. They now make a living under the Sacred Writ Gate. As of today... Profound Peak is no more."

The coldness in Kong Tingyun's eyes deepened, but she still managed a polite bow to Tinglan. "This junior will remember Senior Zhu Gong's protection all these years. Once I have settled my disciples, and when Senior emerges from seclusion, I will be sure to pay a formal visit."

Tinglan tasted only bitterness. She sighed. Qi Lanyan gave her no further opportunity, turning with Kong Tingyun and flying away, leaving Tinglan standing alone in the moonlight.

'How quickly things change!'

Once they were clear of Shanji, Kong Tingyun's polite smile finally vanished. She looked quietly at Kong Guxi, who stood beside her as if in a dream, afraid to move lest he wake up.

"After Ancestor fell," she asked, her voice cracking, "did we really receive anyone's protection?"

Kong Guxi's feet wouldn't stay firm on the cloud. Two muddy tears rolled from his eyes. His aged face finally crumpled with the grief he had held back, a grief that could finally be released. As the other two wept behind him, he spoke through gritted teeth, his voice breaking.

"After the Daoist Master fell, we were surrounded by jackals, all wishing to devour us that very day! Our allied clans wouldn't spare us a glance! Our 'comrades' from Xuanmiao Temple celebrated in the mountains! All those Profound Peak had befriended in the past... every one of them turned a cold shoulder! There was only one... one person who showed a trace of pity, of kindness, who was willing to offer us shelter... Daoist Master Zhaojing!"

"His grace... my Kong Clan cannot repay it in nine lifetimes!"

...

The North Shore.

The mountain wind howled, whipping the snow. Flurries had begun to fall again in the mountains, blanketing the pavilion in a bustling whiteness.

But at the foot of the mountain, along the river, a massive number of cultivators were locked in bloody combat with monks. The cries of battle shook the heavens, a crimson scroll painted against a backdrop of white snow, staining the rocks a dark, glistening red.

The North had only known peace for half a year, and now, droves of monks were crossing the river again. Like locusts unafraid of death, they slammed into the great array set up by the lake cultivators. The battle escalated continuously; within three days, there had already been clashes between Foundation Establishment Realm experts and Master Monks.

Li Zhouwei, in a rare change of white robes, stood quietly in the pavilion. Li Ximing had just stepped out of the Great Void and was steeping tea. He was about to speak when he saw a figure fly through the heavy snow and kneel.

Li Ximing stopped. The man kneeling in the snow was dressed in a reserved long robe, his forehead pressed to the ground, his expression complex.

"Jueyin? What is this?"

It was Cui Jueyin. Li Ximing frowned and told him to rise, but the man didn't dare, remaining prostrate. His voice was low. "This subordinate... has come to beg for punishment!"

Li Zhouwei glanced over, surprised, as Cui Jueyin continued in a low, uneasy tone. "Some time ago, when the Daoist Master was inspecting Jiangbei, the Eastern Sea sent me a letter. They hoped that once my Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation was stable and I had a chance at the Purple Mansion Realm, I would return to the Eastern Sea to visit..."

"I never expected... a family elder would be murdered while traveling. My grandfather is in seclusion and hasn't shown any sign of movement. The island is in turmoil. Daoist Master Yangya returned to our ancestral land, and after inquiring about recent events, he sent back the Purple Mansion Realm cultivation art for the Eternal Brightness Steps. His meaning was the same... he wants this subordinate to return to the Eastern Sea for seclusion, to focus on cultivation and prepare for a breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm."

"This matter has been delayed for far, far too long. Now that the Daoist Master has given the order... I'm afraid... I can no longer avoid it."

Li Ximing froze, then shook his head, gritting his teeth. "What a Daoist Master Yangya!"

Li Zhouwei understood immediately. 'The situation is growing more intense. The Cui family's ancestor has no hope of breaking through, and Chongzhou Island still lacks a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Daoist Master Yangya doesn't want Cui Jueyin, a prized seed, to be dragged into the chaos of the North-South conflict! Even more, he doesn't want the Cui family involved in my affairs.'

Though he spoke mildly, Daoist Master Yangya's actions made his stance clear: he favored the Cui family severing its ties with the Li family. His sudden return, his discovery of the situation—he had probably cursed out everyone on Chongzhou Island. And now, he had produced a Purple Mansion Realm art, determined to force Cui Jueyin's return.

At Li Ximing's outburst, Cui Jueyin became frantic, his voice choking. "Please, milord, do not blame him! The Daoist Master has his own considerations! He means nothing else! If a rift forms between you because of this junior... I truly deserve ten thousand deaths!"

"I was waiting for the Daoist Master to return to beg forgiveness, but I haven't seen you for so long, and the order from the island is from Daoist Master Yangya himself... It cannot be delayed. Today, I was fortunate enough to run into you..."

Cui Jueyin had been on the lake for many years; it had become his home. Li Ximing trusted him more than some of his own direct descendants. Now, forced to leave, he was weeping, a sight that made Li Zhouwei fall silent.

After a long moment, Li Ximing spoke. "Since it is an order from your family's Daoist Master, we cannot force you to stay. But you have served with great merit. How can we let you leave empty-handed?"

Cui Jueyin started to protest, but Li Ximing shook his head. He retrieved several jade slips from his sleeve, placed them in a jade box, and said softly, "Take these spell arts. As for pills and resources, regardless of what Chongzhou Island provides, the lake will also prepare a share for you! You will not be lacking."

"I dare not accept the Daoist Master's resources!" Cui Jueyin said, alarmed.

Li Ximing sneered. "You dare not accept... And if I sent them to Chongzhou Island, Daoist Master Yangya wouldn't dare to accept them either. Just take them and put them in your storage bag. If Daoist Master Yangya asks, just tell him it's your compensation. A clean break!"

Li Ximing was not just pained; he was filled with a powerless rage. His voice softened. "The original agreement was for an exchange of disciples. The two Bright Yang cultivators from my family have sensitive identities, so it wasn't convenient for them to go. You've been on the island for so many years, we've long seen you as one of our own. Seeing Daoist Master Yangya's attitude, it's good they never went... I only hope you achieve your divine ability soon, and do not waste your years of cultivation."

Cui Jueyin kowtowed repeatedly, finally gathering his robes and departing. Li Zhouwei turned his head away, a pang of guilt in his heart. Li Ximing drank several cups of tea, his face an unreadable mask.

Just then, someone came to report. "Guest Elder Li Wushao has returned! He says he has an urgent matter to report!"

The snow thickened, blanketing the world. The black-robed man ascended with a gloomy expression, the shadows at his feet coiling like serpents. It was Li Wushao, returned from Azure Pond.

Quan Yuduan and his disciple-brother had intentionally revealed information, not bothering to hide it from him. They had leaked everything they had heard within the sect—news the Si Clan had obtained through its connections and background. The Demon beast hadn't dared to delay a moment, nor had he shown any sign of abnormality, returning to the lake as quickly as his schedule allowed.

Although Li Wushao was merely a Demon beast, the father and son he followed were two of the most respected figures on the lake. His own status was far from low. The moment he reported his return, he was granted unimpeded access to the two highest-cultivation Daoist Masters present.

He knelt, his voice low and grim, and began his detailed account.

'...Based on their words... it must be Daoist Master Suiguan.'

'Suiguan!'

Li Ximing, who had been half-distracted, observing the Foundation Establishment Realm skirmishes by the lake, immediately felt his gloomy mood evaporate. In its place, a deep sense of unease rose. He froze. "Why him?"

The two looked at each other, seeing the same alarm in each other's eyes. Years ago, when Li Qinghong had passed by Profound Peak, Kong Tingyun had revealed a secret:

'If the True Monarch goes beyond the heavens, Suiguan will remain in Azure Pond's Pristine Speech Heaven. He will not dare enter the Manifested Realm, much less Jiangnan.'

'This means... the battle between the True Monarchs beyond the heavens is already over! That person has likely returned to Pristine Speech Heaven!'

Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan had just arrived. The man in crimson robes, Li Jiangqian, had a dark expression, his tone icy. "It is rumored this man is a Great Daoist Master, not only at the pinnacle of the Purple Mansion Realm but also of extraordinary origins... Daoist Master Qiuhu... has likely lost her autonomy!"

'No wonder Ning Wan has been missing for months... The other Supreme Yang Daoist tradition houses probably think she's still recovering from her injuries!'

Li Que'wan, however, mused for a moment. "If Daoist Master Suiguan has returned... he is still a figure of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. With the North-South confrontation at hand, and the Kong family's matter still unclear, his stance is now even more critical."

Li Zhouwei made no comment. He listened until Li Wushao finished, then said, "This has been hard on you... to undertake such a dangerous task... and rush all the way back."

Li Wushao shook his head grimly. Li Zhouwei's eyes flashed with suspicion.

"It was speculated long ago that this Daoist Master Suiguan is similar to Dongfang Heyun. If he isn't some divine ability manifestation or a Dharma Treasure avatar, he is, at the very least, a manifestation of Pristine Water. Who knows how many years it's been since he attained his divine ability... He is in a league of his own. He might have the power to stop the North-South conflict, but pinning our hopes on him... we'd be better off considering Chi Buzi."

"As it stands, we have likely lost Ning Wan's support, and even Azure Pond Sect may no longer be willing to side with the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition."

The group fell silent. Li Ximing said, "I just wonder if the other major families know."

A trace of weariness crossed Li Zhouwei's brow. Discussing Pristine Water and Suiguan was dangerous; the juniors shouldn't be involved. He exchanged a look with his great-uncle, dismissed Li Jiangqian and Li Que'wan, and then continued, "I heard about Azure Pond withdrawing its people and reducing its disciples. I originally thought it was Daoist Master Qiuhu reshuffling forces to prepare for Si Yuanli's breakthrough. Now, it seems... it was Suiguan's will."

Neither of them could fathom Suiguan's intentions. They lapsed into a heavy silence.

Li Wushao, however, was meticulous. "This subordinate searched the sect but found nothing. However, when passing through the market, I obtained a portrait of Daoist Master Suiguan left by the Chi family years ago... I have brought it."

'Obtained from the market?' The implication couldn't be more obvious. It was likely the same people who had secretly leaked the news of Suiguan's return. Li Ximing sighed inwardly and nodded. "This place has no array, after all. Let's go to the island to look."

But Li Zhouwei held him back, looking thoughtful. "We'll look at it here."

The Demon beast immediately stood, lifted his sleeve, and produced a scroll. He raised it to his own eye level before pulling the silk ties, unfurling the portrait.

The man in the painting stood quietly. He was tall and slender, with long, narrow eyes. He was the only subject, but the pupils of his eyes had not been painted, leaving them blank.

Those with great divine abilities and mighty powers often had strange particularities. The True Monarchs on the Chongming Profund Insight Screen had been faceless, and Immortals were represented by a golden circle. It wasn't so strange for a Purple Mansion Realm expert's portrait to lack pupils.

The artist had been extremely cautious. The body was a mere outline, devoid of color, save for a touch of green at the corner of the robe to indicate it was a green garment. It was the typical attire of an Azure Pond Sect Purple Mansion Realm expert, green robes with golden tassels.

The artist hadn't even dared to write the name Suiguan. The sides of the scroll were empty.

'The skill is exquisite. Even from a painting, it exudes a menacing aura.'

Li Wushao was not a tall man. He held the scroll up with his arms outstretched, looking slightly awkward. A moment later, a fair, white hand gently took the scroll from his grasp, turning it around for a closer look.

The man stared at the painting in his hand, the corners of his mouth curling up. In an instant, the great blizzard seemed to pause, the flakes freezing in mid-air, becoming his backdrop.

Li Wushao stood respectfully, seemingly unaware, his gray-black pupils reflecting the other's eerie, azure-purple eyes and smiling face.

A light laugh echoed through the snow.

"Si Yuanli is far too careless. I'm nowhere near this ferocious!"
