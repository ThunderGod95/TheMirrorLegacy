# Chapter 807: Murder

Dawn was just breaking, but the great hall was brightly lit. Li Zhouluo placed several stacks of scrolls onto the desk and let out a breath of relief. The lamplight cast a sallow hue on his face as he turned and said:

“The clan’s records from the past few years, detailing all matters large and small, are recorded within. Li Jiangqian, you only need to read through them.”

Li Jiangqian, still dressed in his crimson robes, nodded at his words. He picked up the topmost volume, his expression thoughtful as he began to read. Li Zhouluo shook his head and said:

“I haven’t done a very good job these past few years. If there are any omissions or errors, I must ask you to correct them, Li Jiangqian. I apologize for the trouble…”

“Uncle, how could you say such a thing!” Li Jiangqian replied with a smile, shaking his head. “Fourth Uncle, you are kind-hearted and deeply care for the clan. How could there be any failings? These records show only benevolent governance. The policies you proposed are excellent; this nephew must study them carefully.”

Li Zhouluo merely sighed again and shook his head. He unfastened the black robe he wore, placed it into his storage bag, and replied:

“You must stop flattering me. I am also on the verge of breaking through to the ninth level of Qi Refining. This timing is perfect; I will take this opportunity to enter seclusion.”

He quickly departed. Li Jiangqian settled himself firmly back into the main seat, raised an eyebrow toward Dili Guang standing nearby, and asked:

“Are all the young masters on their way?”

Dili Guang nodded, responding respectfully, “Reporting to the Patriarch, Young Master Li Jianglong and Young Master Jiangxia entered seclusion three months ago and six months ago, respectively. The message has been sent, but it is unlikely they will receive it in time.”

Li Jiangqian gave a short laugh and replied, “It doesn't matter. Funan and the East Shore have always been managed by my two younger brothers, and everything is in perfect order. There is no need for them to make the trip. What about Jiangliang and Jiangnian?”

Dili Guang quickly replied: “The Fourth Young Master has been studying under Lord Cui Jueyin. Coincidentally, his lordship has been on the island these past few days, so the Fourth Young Master is already waiting in the side hall. The youngest master, Jiangnian, has also been cultivating on the island recently and is waiting as well.”

“Send them in.”

He gave the order and lowered his head again, returning his focus to the records. Scarcely ten breaths passed before the light clinking of metal sounded from the hall's entrance. A young master strode in, a sword cradled in his arm. His golden pupils scanned the room, and he called out in a bright voice:

“Big Brother!”

This was indeed his fourth brother, Li Jiangliang. He was fifteen now, his expressions vivid. He looked very similar to Li Jiangqian, though he appeared sunnier and more approachable. He spoke with enthusiasm:

“Congratulations, Big Brother! I went to your residence to pay my respects a few days ago, but your movements were unpredictable, and I wasn't able to see you. Truly, congratulations!”

Li Jiangliang was heartfelt, and Li Jiangqian naturally wouldn't rebuff him. He returned the greeting with a smile, saying:

“I was preoccupied with affairs these past few days and had no leisure. But the moment I was free, did I not send for you, Fourth Brother?”

The two exchanged a few more pleasantries before Li Jiangqian’s gaze shifted to the youngest brother, Li Jiangnian, who stood last in line.

All four of Li Zhouwei’s sons were tall. Even Li Jianglong, the plainest in appearance, possessed a fine build by any normal standard. Yet the Li Jiangnian standing before him now was short, almost stunted and thin.

What made Li Jiangqian frown, however, was the young man’s face.

The members of the Li clan were generally known for their good looks, especially those descending from Li Tongya’s line. Li Xijun had been a famously handsome man in his day, and Li Qinghong was a stunning beauty. Even Li Zhouwei, having managed the clan for so many years, had attracted the devotion of numerous female cultivators in the region. And Li Jiangliang, standing right in front of him, possessed a first-class bearing.

Yet Li Jiangnian had sharp, protruding lips and hollow cheeks. His eyes were both squinted and swollen. Worse, several warts dotted the side of his face, a few coarse hairs sprouting from them. It wasn't just that his appearance was unsightly; his entire demeanor was timid and cowering. He was not merely ungraceful—he was actively repulsive to look at.

'Failing to inherit Father’s golden pupils is one thing… but to look this wretched!'

His brow furrowed deeply. Compared to the natural charisma his other brothers possessed, this youngest one seemed to have an innate quality that repelled others. Li Jiangqian watched him in silence, finding the contrast hard to believe.

'Is he truly… Father’s biological son?!'

He couldn't even bring himself to speak, instead walking down from the main seat to observe him more closely. He asked, doubtfully, “You are already a cultivator about to enter Qi Refining… how can you still have such growths…”

Li Jiangqian was naturally referring to the warts on his face. The awkward Li Jiangnian, however, seemed accustomed to the question and answered meekly:

“I was born this way. Lord Cui already examined them. He said that as my cultivation base increases, they will naturally fade away, so there is no need to intervene.”

Li Jiangqian could only step back. His original intention to test his two younger brothers had evaporated. He returned to the main seat, averted his gaze from Jiangnian, and replied:

“Jiangnian, you are about to begin Qi Refining. Are you here to receive the Courtly Red Dust Qi? I will give you an order token; you may go to the dense forest and retrieve it yourself.”

Li Jiangnian nodded hastily, accepted the token Li Jiangqian handed him, and departed joyfully.

As he pushed the door open and left, both remaining brothers in the hall breathed a sigh of relief. Li Jiangqian let out a heavy breath, unsure what to even say, and simply rubbed the space between his brows.

Li Jiangliang lowered his head slightly and murmured, “For the past few years, our youngest brother has rarely left seclusion. Unless absolutely necessary, he eats and sleeps entirely within his immortal’s abode. He only came tonight because he was forced to retrieve the spiritual qi.”

“It’s better that he stays hidden.” Li Jiangqian sighed. “In this world, no matter where you go, your face is unavoidable. If you are born handsome, others treat you well at a glance. If you are born ugly, you invite insults just by walking down the road. As for using a Dharma Art to conceal it, he would inevitably be suspected of hiding his true identity and harboring ill intentions. At worst, we will just have him wear a mask to cover his features. He still won’t escape the stares, but at least it will be tolerable to look at.”

Li Jiangliang nodded repeatedly. Li Jiangqian spared him a glance, recognizing that his fourth brother didn't genuinely care whether Jiangnian wore a mask or not. He smiled and changed the subject:

“I heard Uncle Zhouluo mention that you consumed that portion of the Bright Parting Blazing Essence from many years ago. That means you follow the same dao lineage as I, cultivating the Sutra of Heavenly Parting and the Setting Sun. You should come to me often for guidance in the future.”

“Many thanks, Big Brother!”

Li Jiangliang cupped his hands and departed. Li Jiangqian rose to his feet, dipped a brush in the inkstone on his desk, and inscribed several characters. He then withdrew a stack of small letters from his sleeve, glanced at Dili Guang, and commanded:

“Go and summon the people from Qingdu and the Jade Court Guard.”

He raised his eyebrows, a smile playing on his lips. “Don't worry about making a commotion. In fact, the bigger the commotion, the better. I want the entire island to hear this clearly!”

Dili Guang understood the intent. He nodded and withdrew. As predicted, the great hall was suddenly filled with the sound of countless footsteps. Soldiers in white armor streamed in from both side halls, sealing every exit. For a moment, the hall was filled with flickering shadows and the noisy din of clashing weapons and scraping armor.

*Clang!*

Li Jiangqian remained seated on the main throne. Chen Yang, clad head-to-toe in black armor, strode quickly in from a side door and offered a cupped-fist salute.

“Reporting to the Patriarch. Li Xixuan is indeed at Mount Qingdu. He is in the Old Lord’s courtyard, begging bitterly. He has already been kneeling for an hour.”

“Only an hour!” Li Jiangqian smiled, savoring the moment. “He is a mortal, after all. The boat ride to Qingdu takes quite some time. It’s a good thing I waited for him until the middle of the night.”

He withdrew an order token, smiling. “Dili Guang has already gone to summon the Qingdu forces. Take your own people. The very instant the Qingdu forces leave the mountain, you are to lock down Qingdu completely. Allow no one to enter or leave.”

“Make the commotion as large as possible. Just say… that I have found grounds for accusation, and now, I intend to kill someone!”
