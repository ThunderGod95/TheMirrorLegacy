# Chapter 516: The Secret Of Spells And Techniques

Li Xizhi casually navigated through the bustling market, taking a moment to visit the courtyard where his grandfather, Li Xuanxuan, was diligently sketching with a talisman brush dipped in spirit ink.

Having drawn talismans for over seventy years, the old man could draw them perfectly even with his eyes closed. Without stopping his hand, he raised his gray eyebrows and glanced at Li Xizhi. A smile broke across his face as he said, "You're here, Zhi'er."

Li Xizhi responded respectfully, observing as his grandfather skillfully completed a talisman. The finished product was a Returning Origin Shield snow-white talisman of the late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm.

Noticing the curious look on his grandson's face, Li Xuanxuan remarked, "It's just a common talisman and can't compare to those available in your sect..."

Li Xizhi took another closer look at it and replied softly, "It's true that it falls short. Grandfather's talisman art is remarkably refined, but without a superior legacy, it's wasted on these simpler designs."

"The threshold for talisman art is low, and many rogue cultivators like me squander their potential here in Yue State," Li Xuanxuan chuckled, waving his hand dismissively.

He then retrieved the Dinglin Piercer from his storage pouch and handed the golden dharma artifact to him.

"This Dinglin Piercer is inscribed with Situ Mo's name and the seal of Golden Tang Gate. We dare not use this, so we hope to find a blacksmith in the market to melt and modify it. At least then, it would be usable."

He stroked his beard and sighed before continuing, "I took a trip when I had the chance, but the few blacksmiths who could handle it were afraid of offending the Golden Tang Gate, so they turned me away. The only one willing to take it on quoted an outrageous price! I can't believe it...!"

Li Xizhi immediately understood the situation. Taking the dharma artifact into his hands, he assured, "Leave it to me, Grandfather. While I can't act recklessly in this market, I can leverage my power and influence to open a few backdoors... I may be able to solve our family's trouble easily."

Li Xuanxuan nodded repeatedly with a look of appreciation on his face.

"A few years ago, I had a disagreement with your youngest uncle. If you had stayed home, you would have been the perfect person to manage the family. Unfortunately, you had to join the sect as you were the only candidate to fill that role. If only we could delay it a few years back then..."

Li Xizhi shook his head, but Li Xuanxuan continued, "Yes, you were indeed the best candidate to join the sect. Ximing can be heartless; if someone with his personality joined, it could spell trouble! Xijun is too sharp, and Xicheng is too serious. You're the only one who can navigate these waters patiently and with goodwill..."

"I heard you married someone from the Yang Family. Does she take good care of you? Bring her back to meet Grandfather if opportunity allows..."

Li Xuanxuan, now old and prone to rambling, chatted on as Li Xizhi listened with a smile.

Eventually, he said softly, "Just a moment, Grandfather. I'll find someone to recast the dharma artifact."

Li Xuanxuan waved, motioning for him to go. As Li Xizhi stepped outside, he heard a couple of creaking sounds from the backyard. Li Xijun entered, looking noticeably better, but with a hint of concern on his face.

"Granduncle, you should really consider heading home earlier. While we're safe in this market, I'm worried that Situ Mo could still pose a threat. Auntie is alone at home. If he goes to Mount Qingdu, I fear she won't be able to handle him," he urged.

"That's a good point," Li Xuanxuan replied, pausing in his work. He set down the talisman brush and added, "When Jiao'er finishes his retreat, we can all return together. We'll have Xizhi take care of the dharma artifact and deliver it to us when it's done."

————

When Li Xizhi left the courtyard, the two older men, who had been waiting attentively, approached him.

"Who's the best at refining artifacts in this market?" he asked them.

One of the old men stepped forward with a fawning smile as he replied, "There's a cultivator from the Sword Gate here who specializes in crafting dharma artifacts, but... he's also a disciple of the immortal sect and has secluded himself for quite some time. He isn't very friendly, so we dare not approach him. I fear you might need to visit him personally, my lord..."

"From Wanyu Sword Gate, huh? That's fine. Take me there," Li Xizhi replied decisively with a nod.

He set off, riding the rainbow as the two men followed closely behind, admiring and fearing the vibrant light beneath his feet.

One of them whispered through mana voice transmission, "This man is quite fortunate to be born as the direct descendant of Qingdu and become a disciple of Azure Pond Sect. His master is a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from the Yuan Family of Mushroom Forest Plain, and his father is the ancestor of the Li Family. His family has Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators for three generations... He's truly been above us since birth..."

The other old man nodded in agreement, replying in the same manner, "Indeed. I suspect this lord's background in the sect plays a significant role too... He doesn't get involved in the market dealings. Perhaps he even looks down on them!"

Of course, Li Xizhi could not hear their conversation. When he stepped into the courtyard, he saw a young man sitting on the ground, studying a blueprint. Sensing Li Xizhi's presence, he raised his drooping eyelids and glanced at him.

"I am Cheng Jinzhu of Wanyu Sword Gate. Which peak of Azure Pond do you come from?" the young man asked.

Although Wanyu Sword Gate and Azure Pond Sect did not have the best relationship, the man's sideways glance felt rather rude. Sensing the arrogance in his demeanor, Li Xizhi guessed that this situation might be challenging.

Nevertheless, he responded humbly, "I'm Li Xizhi from Qingsui Peak."

"Qingsui Peak? Never heard of it!" Cheng Jinzhu replied, his tone initially calm. But then he suddenly frowned, straightened his posture, and asked with confusion, "Li Family... Aren't you from the Li Family of Fuchen Peak? This Qingsui you speak of... is it the Qingsui connected to the Sword Immortal?"

"I'm from the Li Family of Qingdu at Moongaze Lake," Li Xizhi explained.

As soon as the words left his mouth, Cheng Jinzhu jumped up from the ground, his expression shifting drastically.

His smile became enthusiastic, and he said with a hint of embarrassment, "My apologies, fellow Daoist! I saw how young you looked and thought you were a direct descendant of the Devil Gate... It turns out you're the descendant of the Sword Immortal Clan! I am truly sorry!"

Although Cheng Jinzhu could openly refer to the Azure Pond Sect as the Devil Gate, Li Xizhi did not dare to acknowledge it. He felt a wave of relief wash over him, but could only bow his head silently and pretend he had not heard the young man's remark.

"The influence of my predecessors is hardly worth mentioning," he replied modestly.

Cheng Jinzhu's attitude changed completely. He pulled Li Xizhi closer and exclaimed cheerfully, "What do you mean by hardly worth mentioning? When Celestial Moon Sword Intent first emerged, it was recorded even in the Wanyu Sword Book of my sect! The sword's name is Qingche, and the sword intent is Celestial Moon—ethereal and unpredictable. With just a glance, anyone could tell that it embodies the true Dao!"

"We don't like to refer to it by the name of the immortal peak in the Devil Gate. So, whenever we talk about the Sword Immortal, we refer to him by his sword's name," he added.

A somber look appeared on his face as he continued, "It's a pity he fell in the southern border. Such a shame..."

Cheng Jinzhu took Li Xizhi's hand and said, "Your family hails from Azure Pond; otherwise, my sword gate would be the closest to your family. In recent years, my gate has been fighting everywhere, and the situation isn't good. We can barely protect ourselves. Otherwise, we would definitely invite the descendants of your family to join us..."

He continued softly, "As for the Wrathful Maha, although my elder has never engaged in the dirty dealings of Buddhist cultivators, they made an exception in the great void, secretly trying to rescue the victims. Although his actions have yielded some unexpected results, things ultimately didn't work out..."

Cheng Jinzhu seemed to be filled with frustration as he spilled out all these words that he had been suppressing all this while. Li Xizhi listened intently until he finished speaking, feeling slightly touched by his emotive expressions.

Cheng Jinzhu then noticed the expression on his face and smiled brightly as he said, "Come, fellow Daoist! Your family's techniques are impressive. Let's have a quick spar with swords!"

Li Xizhi understood that Cheng Jinzhu was likely wary of him pretending to be a member of the Li Family to deceive him. He placed his right hand on the hilt of his sword, gathering his energy before saying calmly, "All right, but I'll only demonstrate one move."

After all, I only know this single move from the Law of Celestial Moon...

While Li Xizhi was thinking to himself, Cheng Jinzhu grew serious. He drew his sword, its brilliant sword qi already shimmering and flowing, signaling that he was ready for battle.

Wanyu's sword technique legacy had been passed down through generations. As Cheng Jinzhu activated his sword, he observed Li Xizhi's movements keenly. Suddenly, the sword hanging at Li Xizhi's waist leaped into action, unleashing a massive sword arc that rushed toward him.

Clang...!

Cheng Jinzhu retracted his sword, shaking it to dispel the energy of the sword arc that had surged toward him. He stepped back a few paces with a thoughtful look on his face.

Li Xizhi felt a pang of unease in his heart.

He moved really quickly with his sword! Despite being in the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, he effortlessly neutralized my strike, and that speaks volumes about his strength!

Meanwhile, Cheng Jinzhu stroked his chin and commented, "Your swordsmanship is quite peculiar... It's very interesting."

He was eager to see more of Li Xizhi's sword technique, but Li Xizhi refused and cut to the chase.

"I obtained a dharma artifact from Golden Tang Gate, and I would like to ask you to recast it so that my family can use it."

"Golden Tang Gate, huh? No problem, but is it a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact?" Cheng Jinzhu asked nonchalantly.

Li Xizhi handed him the Dinglin Piercer. Cheng Jinzhu took it and examined it before praising it.

"Very interesting design... it's a good treasure."

"Do you want to make it into a sword? What type of true essence can control it?"

The questions he asked showed his experience in his trade.

"Snow and pine," Li Xizhi replied.

Cheng Jinzhu considered this for a moment before nodding thoughtfully.

"Just bring all the cold jade or cold stone you have and I will recast it for you. It will take about... two to three years! This golden material is excellent. It would be a waste to keep it in its current form. It can easily be converted into a Foundation Establishment Realm sword!"

Li Xizhi thanked him gratefully and then asked, "How many Spirit Stones will it cost?"

Cheng Jinzhu casually stroked the Dinglin Piercer in his hand and said, "Just pay me however you wish. I won't take advantage of you. However, I do have one request—I must be the one to name this dharma artifact once it's done."

Li Xizhi did not mind this term at all and nodded in agreement. After exchanging a few more words, they bid farewell and parted ways.

Upon returning to the courtyard, Li Xizhi found his family preparing to leave. He felt a pang of reluctance, having only spent half a month with them.

He hurried over to Li Yuanjiao and asked, "Has your wound healed, Father? Why are you in such a hurry to leave?"

Li Yuanjiao replied gently, "My condition has stabilized, but I have hurt my tendons and bones... Such an injury cannot be healed in a day or two. I still need to go home and stay in seclusion for three to five years."

He adjusted his black robe and added in a serious voice, "I have a few things to discuss with you."

Li Xizhi nodded, but did not expect what Li Yuanjiao said next.
𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑛𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮

"You need to spar with your younger brother."

"Huh...?"

Li Xizhi immediately glanced at Li Xijun, who was holding a sword in his arms and was equally stunned. However, understanding quickly dawned on him.

As expected, Li Yuanjiao explained, "Let us see how my family's descendant compares to the disciple of the Azure Pond Sect!"

Feeling slightly awkward, Li Xizhi landed and noticed that Li Xijun, dressed simply in white, had long been stuck in the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. In contrast, he had just recently broken through and was wearing a brocade robe.

After a brief moment of thought, he removed his feathered robe and nodded at his younger brother.

"Please excuse me, Brother!"

Li Xijun soared into the air and executed the River Crossing Torrential Step, closing the distance between them while pressing his hand on the hilt of his sword. His expression was serious as flew toward Li Xizhi, white qi swirling in his eyes.

Li Xizhi, standing in midair with his sheath in hand, felt the colorful light beneath his feet growing dense and calm. He turned sideways and instantly pulled several feet away, shocking Li Xijun.

This footwork technique is too advanced! I can't seem to close the distance...

Resolving to act quickly, he drew his sword and unleashed a powerful white sword arc. Li Xizhi, not intending to overwhelm his brother, also drew his sword, responding with a Celestial Moon Sword Arc.

Li Xijun's sword was ordinary, but Li Xizhi's shone with mana light, dazzling and eye-catching—clearly indicating that it was far from ordinary. When their sword arcs collided, a loud explosion reverberated through the air.

Boom...!

The two sword arcs clashed in midair, sending smoke and dust swirling around them. Li Xizhi dispersed a wisp of sword qi with a wave of his sleeve, revealing a hint of surprise on his face as he nodded approvingly.

"Good!" he praised.

Though Li Xizhi was older and had trained for longer, while also possessing superior sword talent, his extensive study of spells in the sect meant he had dedicated less time to swordsmanship than Li Xijun. Despite having the advantage of a dharma artifact, he found himself at a slight disadvantage.

Li Xijun seized the upper hand with that one move, eager to close in and unleash sword qi. However, Li Xizhi shook his head with a smile, performed a hand seal, and a vibrant light burst forth.

Floating Light Gathering.

Colorful lights floated about, shimmering and flickering like lightning. In an instant, Li Xijun felt his grip empty and realized that his sword had flown into Li Xizhi's hand.

"What kind of spell was that?!" Li Xijun exclaimed in shock.

Li Yuanjiao, who had been quietly observing the fight, was taken aback. When he saw Li Xizhi snatch the sword from Li Xijun with a swift motion, his expression shifted to one of alarm.

I knew it... there's a method to counter weapon arts!

Rogue and clan cultivators typically could not practice these spells or techniques, relying instead on weapon skills like swords, spears, and sabers to fight against the immortal sects. These skills were easy to learn but had high potential.

Hence, Li Yuanjiao had long suspected that the Azure Pond Sect possessed spells specifically designed to counter them.

His heart raced.

If that's the case, how can we possibly win? It takes just a spell for them to disarm us!

Although Li Xijun was caught off guard, he was quick to react. He swiftly brought his fingers together and unleashed Slaughter Jun Kui Light. White light surged forward, aimed directly at Li Xizhi.

"Good spell," Li Xizhi complimented. He quickly performed a hand seal, bending his middle and ring fingers into his palm, raising the others to form a triangle shape, and reciting a brief chant.

"Enter, me, heart, cauldron."

As soon as he finished speaking, the Kui Light formed a white line, swirling gracefully before landing in his palm. With a gentle twist, he redirected it, causing the white energy to flow and freeze the ground beneath them.

After witnessing this display, Li Xijun could only sigh in resignation. Li Yuanjiao and Li Xuanxuan exchanged glances, both astonished.

Zhi'er is not a direct descendant of Azure Pond, yet the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique is a complete and comprehensive manual even by the standards of the Azure Pond is already this powerful! If he were part of the Chi Family...

Li Xizhi cupped his fist to his younger brother. Noticing the silent expressions of the two elders, he assured softly, "Zhi'er is not weak in the sect..."

Li Yuanjiao sighed and asked, "How many spells can an average Azure Pond disciple practice?"

Li Xizhi replied respectfully, "Three or four. If they attempt more, it might delay their foundation establishment."

Glancing at his father, he hesitated before adding, "Disciples in the sect typically establish their foundation in their fifties or sixties. It's not solely due to their talent but rather the time lost practicing spells while waiting for the opportunity to break through. If certain spells remain unpracticed during the Qi Cultivation Realm, achieving Foundation Establishment becomes significantly more challenging."

"Why is that?" Li Yuanjiao asked, frowning slightly.

Li Xizhi explained, "Once a cultivator establishes their immortal foundation, many divine wonders naturally manifest. If the spells they intend to learn do not harmonize with them, improvement becomes difficult..."

"Conversely, if those spells are learned before establishing the foundation, they may be influenced positively by the immortal foundation, leading to remarkable changes. Thus, disciples in the sect strive to push themselves as much as possible. Unfortunately, some end up aging without progress, resulting in numerous tragedies.
