# Chapter 718: Entering Dense Cloud

"You're too kind, Senior," Li Ximing replied, though he didn't pursue the topic. He gazed through the Great Void. Li Zhouwei and the others had clashed briefly with the core disciples of the Capital immortals Dao. Both sides had suffered minor injuries, but once Yehui departed, the Capital immortals Dao cultivators ceased their attack and retreated to the few remaining mountains under their control in Dense Cloud Cave's territory.

'We've taken about seventy percent of the territory. That's not a small gain.'

Leaving the affairs of Dense Cloud Cave to Li Zhouwei and his group, Li Ximing steered his divine ability away. He remained silent on the journey, a clear sign of his displeasure. Changxi, of course, noticed and could only sigh inwardly. When they landed on Gardenia Scenery Mountain, the old Daoist Master spoke in a weary voice.

"Yehui is a cultivator from the Eastern Sea. Though he was fortunate in his Dao lineage to have reached his current level, his words are not to be trusted. Zhaojing, don't let them trouble your mind."

Li Ximing's mind was a tangle of its own. Yehui's provocations held little credibility. If that Purple Mansion cultivator from the Capital immortals Dao truly intended to carve up the Profound Peak Gate, wouldn't it have been more logical for him to send congratulatory gifts and make his intentions clear sooner?

But now, a different question arose in Li Ximing's thoughts.

'Then why didn't he?'

Even if Changxi were to die, there was no way Yehui could seize all of the Profound Peak Gate's territory. The Li clan was right next door. If trouble befell the Profound Peak Gate, the Li clan's intervention would be seen as assistance, while the Capital immortals Dao's would be seen as an invasion. The speed at which they could take control of the land would be worlds apart.

From Li Ximing's perspective, if Yehui wanted to occupy a larger share of the Profound Peak Gate's territory, he shouldn't have pushed them toward the Li clan. Even if he bore the Li clan ill will, he should have feigned goodwill for the time being, pretending to have no interest in the Profound Peak Gate. That would have made a future betrayal far more convenient.

'As it stands now, with Changxi still alive, my clan will send people to help defend their borders. He'll have to face the united front of the Profound Peak and Moongaze Lake clans. The difficulty is a world of difference from what it was before!'

'Either he has some other ace up his sleeve… or his goal isn't the Profound Peak Gate's territory at all…'

Li Ximing still had no idea what Daoist Master Yehui truly wanted, and that was the most dangerous part. He dismissed the man's arrogant words as mere misdirection.

As he was lost in thought, Changxi continued, "Zhaojing, although Yehui has retreated, it's only because he is unwilling to clash with us at this moment…"

Li Ximing frowned. "Is Yehui truly so arrogant that he doesn't fear a counterattack from you, Senior? If you know anything more, I must ask you to tell me everything. Any concealment now could lead to disaster."

Changxi had previously hidden the fact that Kong Haiying's wife had been killed by Yehui. This was no small matter. In the future, Yehui's ambitions would extend beyond the Profound Peak Gate's territory and Dao lineage; he would be after the lives of Kong Haiying's entire line. The feud would escalate to an entirely new level.

Changxi didn't have much time left, and Yehui was already an enemy. Li Ximing felt it wasn't his place to press the matter of Kong Haiying, but he had made his current request clear. Changxi nodded with a heavy sigh.

At this point, he no longer held anything back. "Zhaojing, you may not know this, but he possesses two spell-type divine abilities and one body-type divine ability. My Fool's Mountain Chase can neither suppress nor entangle him. While I could likely injure him if I fought to the death, it's not that simple."

"Years ago, Daoist Master Chonghe of the Wuzhu Gate, a mid-stage Purple Mansion cultivator, pursued Yanque of the Hengzhu lineage. Yanque's body-type divine ability dragged the chase across the Great Void of Wu-Yue for six years, yet Chonghe still couldn't succeed. The disparity between Yehui and myself is even greater."

"I am not Ning Tiaoxiao, who possesses an ancient spiritual artifact to suppress his foes. If we were to truly fight, and I was willing to throw my life away, he would surely refuse to engage me unless… he had an ambush prepared in the Great Void."

Having reached the Purple Mansion Realm himself, Li Ximing understood how difficult it was to kill another Purple Mansion cultivator when their divine abilities were of a similar level. But his intention wasn't for Changxi to fight Yehui to the death. The Capital immortals Dao was still in Jiangbei. The man could run, but could the sect?

Before he could even hint at this, Changxi continued, "As for targeting his clan's juniors… my Dao lineage still exists in this world. I cannot commit such an act that would leave my name in infamy for ten thousand years, nor can I condemn my descendants to die without a burial place, forever shouldering a cursed reputation."

"And as for attacking his sect in White Ye to force his hand… Zhaojing, think for a moment. Whose efforts nurtured the lands of Jiangbei?"

Understanding dawned on Li Ximing. "The conflict between the north and south… is this the will of those who have attained Fruition?"

"Exactly!" Changxi's expression was filled with sorrow. "How many people did the various sects commit to the conflict between north and south to cultivate Jiangbei into what it is today? Though it was mainly by carving flesh from the Azure Pond Sect and drinking the blood of demonic and rogue cultivators, this land is absolutely off-limits."

"The moment I set foot in White Ye, Yehui would laugh out loud. He would certainly appear to meet me, and the moment we clash, the spiritual energy in the White Ye region would be severely damaged. That would be a catastrophe."

"Before we could even truly fight, the other major powers would appear to mediate. Yuanxiu from the south, Qiushui from the west, Yuming and Shanbai from the north, Sumian from the east… even the various Buddhist sects would intervene to stop me."

Changxi looked at him deeply, his voice aged and grave. "His sect is in Jiangbei, and thus, he acts with impunity!"

Only then did Li Ximing understand why Yehui held Changxi in such low regard. He fell silent for a moment, at a loss for words. "Senior, do you have a plan? If we are limited to our current methods, I fear it will be difficult to fend off the enemy."

After all, based on the current situation, unless the Capital immortals Dao crossed the river to attack, Changxi was truly powerless. Seeing Li Ximing's troubled expression, Changxi took a sip of tea, the wrinkles on his face deepening.

The old man finally spoke. "Zhaojing, if, after my death, the situation becomes truly perilous and beyond hope, you may cede Shanji Prefecture to the Purple Smoke Gate in exchange for their protection… as long as the main gate of our sect remains, it will be enough."

Li Ximing breathed a sigh of relief and said with great solemnity, "Very well! With your words, many things become easier to handle. I only hope you will leave a letter or a handwritten note as proof."

The Kong family had cultivated Shanji Prefecture for generations, and they had never enforced a strict separation between cultivators and mortals. Not only were there many with Kong family blood, but the vast majority of the populace had deep ties to the cultivators of the sect. Li Ximing had no desire to be hailed as a savior only to be cursed later. He wanted it all in writing.

Changxi craned his neck and nodded. "This matter should not be widely known, otherwise the entire Profound Peak Gate will lose its will to fight. I have actually already written a final testament and hidden it beneath the first seat of Xiyue Hall on the main peak. I will write another copy for you now, so the two can be cross-referenced."

Li Ximing produced a sheet of spiritual cloth. Changxi used his divine ability as a brush and wrote two lines, then handed it to Li Ximing. The cloth was now as heavy as a boulder, weighing over a thousand pounds.

As the old man placed it in his hands, his aged appearance seemed to intensify. He said respectfully, "My thanks, Zhaojing!"

With that, he offered no further pleasantries, simply clasping his hands in farewell before using his divine ability to enter the Great Void and vanish.

Li Ximing turned the cloth over to read it.

"I entrust Daoist Friend Zhaojing to watch over the Profound Peak Gate. Should the situation turn dire, he has full authority to cede Shanji Prefecture to another power in exchange for aid."

Although Changxi's divine ability was not suited for combat, its profoundness was not lacking. The very act of writing produced strange phenomena. The characters were like stone carvings, looking as if they might fall right off the cloth. Li Ximing nodded to himself in appreciation.

His own divine abilities were also of the spell type, but they bordered on body arts. With the Bright Yang fire in his heart, he manifested Bright Yang both inside and out. The Purple Yang Fire resided within his Juque Palace, and the Heavenly Radiance was born between his brows. Beyond that, there was only Audience with the Celestial Gate. He was not weak in combat, but his abilities lacked versatility.

When the Li family had moved Mount Qingdu, they had invited Kong Yu for assistance. The old man had used a piece of Changxi's calligraphy to aid in moving the mountain. While the characters Li Ximing had inscribed on the six gates over his lake could reflect the heavenly light, they couldn't be used as talismans like Changxi's writing could.

'Once this is all settled, I can make a trip to the Cui family in the Eastern Sea… I should be able to find compatible cultivation methods to study there. I can also inquire about Purple Mansion-level array formations along the way… I need one that can at least cover all of Gardenia Scenery Mountain.'

'As for Yehui… I wonder what he's after… Daoist Master Chuting isn't always at Mount Xianyou, and we're not related by blood or friendship. I can't keep troubling him… Alas… if only Brother Jun were here!'

He gathered his thoughts.

'On the way, I'll sound Changxi out again. Maybe I can get the formula for a spiritual artifact embryo out of him!'

***

**Baijiang Creek.**

A brocade-like light floated over Hongfu Mountain, forming a circular halo. Soft, cotton-like motes of light drifted through it. From a distance, it looked less like a cultivator sect and more like the residence of an immortal clan.

When Li Zhouwei and the others arrived on streaks of light, Miaoshui hurriedly emerged from the array to greet them. The arrival of the cultivators from the White Ye Capital immortals Dao had terrified her. She had hidden within the formation, clutching the array disk, pretending to be oblivious. Fortunately for her, no one had paid her any mind.

Now, as Li Zhouwei flew closer, Miaoshui presented the multi-colored array disk with both hands.

"Greetings, Clan Head. This is the array disk for the Grand Array of Cloud and Sky on Hongfu Peak. It is a low-grade Foundation Establishment array."

"It can thwart an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. Not bad."

Li Zhouwei accepted it with a measure of delight. The Li clan had only recently become an immortal clan, and their only Foundation Establishment arrays were on Lijing Peak and Mount Qingdu. While the Grand Array of Cloud and Sky was inferior to the Cloud-Gathering Southern Sky and the Five Waters Imperial Heaven, it was still the most valuable asset on the entire mountain. If not for the backing of the Capital immortals Dao, Wenhu would never have been able to set up such a thing.

As he examined it, Li Cheng stepped forward and took it. "It's of the Auspicious Qi lineage. This array might offer some assistance in alchemy and artifact refinement."

"Excellent!"

The Li clan members had fought less than a hundred bouts with the Capital immortals Dao cultivators and had the advantage in numbers. None of them were seriously injured, save for Qu Bushi, who had hurt his hand, and An Siwei, who had taken a palm strike. A few months of recuperation would see them healed.

Li Zhouwei immediately instructed the two of them to choose a cave residence on the mountain to recover, then strode into the main hall. Turning to Li Chenghui and the others, he asked, "Elders, how was the situation in the Dense Cloud territory as you fought your way here? Were the local magnates cooperative?"

Li Minggong replied, "We've taken the various peaks. All of Dense Cloud Cave's Foundation Establishment cultivators have retreated. A number of Qi Refining cultivators were captured. The Baijiang Creek area is a mix of cultivators and mortals, so the locals probably don't have a very favorable impression of us. As for the powerful local families, you'll have to ask Weizeng."

At the mention of his name, Ding Weizeng immediately stepped forward and bowed. "Clan Head, the Baijiang Creek area is dominated by four families: Wang, Zhou, Huang, and Ding. A few hundred years ago, they were all noble families of the State of Xu. They have risen and fallen over time, and now only the Wang and Ding families have Foundation Establishment cultivators… My own has already entered the peak. The Huang family is in the territory of Brahma Cloud Cave."

"Oh?" Li Zhouwei's mind was sharp. He immediately asked, "The Wang family's Foundation Establishment cultivator… is that Wenhu's subordinate, Wang He?"

"The very same!"

With Ding Weizeng's confirmation, Li Zhouwei understood how Wang He had become the second-in-command of Dense Cloud Cave. Wenhu must have been trying to win the support of the local powers. "Now that Wang He has thrown his lot in with the Capital immortals Dao and left, has the Wang family of Baijiang made any moves?"

Before anyone could answer, Li Chenghui spoke up. "The common folk haven't moved, but the direct lineage has most likely been sent to White Ye."

This was an inevitable conclusion that needed no proof. Li Zhouwei scanned the list of names that had been submitted and discovered that this place had indeed produced a fair number of Foundation Establishment cultivators. Though most were demonic cultivators, it was a testament to the region's potential.

The territory of Dense Cloud Cave was unlike other places. It was home to millions of mortals, and there had never been a rule separating them from cultivators. The bloodlines of the powerful families were deeply intertwined. Any one of them could be considered a local tyrant with a population of over ten thousand.

These people had their hands in many unclean dealings and had connections to several different powers. After all, the spiritual energy in Jiangbei was now extremely potent. Floating Cloud Cave, on the periphery, was one thing, but Dense Cloud Cave was truly rich in spiritual resources, all of which were exported through these local powers.

For this reason, even the ruthless Dense Cloud Cave had found it troublesome to take over this land, to say nothing of the more rule-bound Li clan. After a quick review, Li Zhouwei announced grimly, "It is not suitable to establish a Prefecture Peak in the Baijiang territory… The conditions here do not allow for it. If we were to hastily set one up, we would face at least a century of unrest. The income wouldn't even cover the stipends, and we'd end up with widespread resentment. It would be best to govern through autonomy."

It had taken the Li clan over a hundred years to solidify their rule over Moongaze Lake. Even now, their true foundation was still the ancestral lands on the southern shore and the dense forests on the eastern shore. The hundred-plus families further east were still only loosely controlled vassals, and the various families on the western shore remained stubbornly attached to their Prefecture Peaks, not to mention the Fei family on the northern shore.

Furthermore, a territory in Jiangbei might be won today and lost a few years later. Li Zhouwei had no intention of wasting his efforts for nothing.

Li Chenghui strongly agreed. "Just one thing," he added. "The Ding family are cultivators from the Floating Cloud territory. That land is now almost completely empty. We must make arrangements for Weizeng's family."

The Ding family was also a powerful clan. As much as Li Zhouwei valued Ding Weizeng, he wouldn't place this local tyrant back in his old territory. Since Floating Cloud was empty, it was better left that way. Li Zhouwei smiled. "Weizeng has worked hard on this journey. However, the situation is volatile, and we may not be able to hold the Floating Cloud territory. It would be best to relocate the Ding family's people to the Prefecture Peaks on the eastern shore. As for your direct relatives, Weizeng, they will be safest on our clan's own island."

This was a plan to move the entire Ding clan to the lakeside. Ding Weizeng's own life had been saved by the Li clan, and his entire clan had been freed from Hongfu Peak. He was in no position to object and could only express his gratitude respectfully.

Li Zhouwei did value him, however, and showed some consideration for his feelings by not splitting the Ding family among different Prefecture Peaks, which would have truly dismantled the clan, leaving only Ding Weizeng's immediate family.

After Ding Weizeng expressed his thanks, Li Zhouwei picked up a brush. "Though we will not establish a Prefecture Peak or appoint officials, that does not mean we will let them run wild. First, we will use the peaks as boundaries and station the Jade Court Guard there. Let them sweat for a few days. Then, we will offer a few positions and invite the direct descendants of their families to cultivate in the dense forests."

Li Cheng acknowledged the order.

Li Zhouwei added casually, "We'll nurture a few of the local magnates' direct heirs. Even if the situation changes in three to five years and our clan has to withdraw from this territory, as long as these heirs become successful, reintegrating this area should we return to Jiangbei one day will be a simple matter of a single command."

Both Li Cheng and Li Minggong nodded in agreement with his words.

"I'm afraid they won't send their true direct heirs, but rather some side branches or children of concubines," Li Minggong pointed out. "On Moongaze Lake… this is a tired old trick played by all the families."

Li Zhouwei laughed. "It's of no consequence. Our clan is inviting their legitimate, direct heirs. We will bring the person they send, parade them through the streets with gongs and drums, and congratulate them for three full circuits. Then we'll spread some rumors about their secret, noble bloodline—everyone loves to hear such tales. They won't dare to deny it. They won't be able to."

"If our clan says they are a direct heir, then they are a direct heir."

He spoke without any attempt to hide his words from Ding Weizeng, who was waiting outside. The warrior broke into a cold sweat as he listened. He quickly excused himself and waited outside the hall. As the details were being discussed inside, an indescribable feeling welled up within him.

'I used to think demonic cultivators were the only ones who acted without scruples. It turns out the righteous path is filled with its own calculations.'
