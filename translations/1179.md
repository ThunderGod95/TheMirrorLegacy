# Chapter 1179: The Scions

His attitude gave Li Ximing pause. The Daoist Master asked, "How confident are you? What do you need?"

Li Jiangliang shook his head and replied,

"For an ordinary cultivator to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, it's a matter of raising the immortal foundation into the Shengyang Acupoint, condensing a divine ability, and overcoming the haze of ignorance and the boundless fantasies. For those of us who are Holders of the Profound, our True Qi divine ability is already in the Shengyang Acupoint. Raising the immortal foundation is but a thought."

A look of helplessness crossed his face.

"But it's precisely because the True Qi divine ability resides in the Shengyang Acupoint that even after arriving in Ting Province, a remnant of the Martial Cultivation's light remains within. One cannot break through without being a Holder of the Profound!"

This single sentence extinguished the last glimmer of hope in Li Ximing's heart.

Li Jiangliang continued, "As a Holder of the Profound, my Shengyang Acupoint frequently enters and exits the Great Void, becoming deeply suffused with its aura. The haze of ignorance is greatly diminished. The hardest part, instead, is the final trial of infinite fantasy..."

Li Ximing's expression hardened slightly as he asked impassively,

"Even the haze of ignorance can be reduced?!"

Li Jiangliang nodded.

"It's merely reduced, nothing compared to the Wuguan Legacy! Ancient cultivators had methods of spirit-roaming the Great Void, allowing them to adapt beforehand and lessen the haze. Such methods are lost to us now. But... they also faced numerous calamities. Compared to that, a swift bout of ignorance is almost a mercy."

"In truth... the one difficulty shared by all cultivators, ancient and modern, internal and external, is the 'boundless fantasy'!"

Li Ximing listened with silent approval.

'The constraints are real, but the benefits are just as substantial.'

'Then again... most of those who rely on being Holders of the Profound to form a divine ability don't care about constraints. Chen Wenyao of the Chen Clan is no great talent, merely average. As long as he can form a divine ability, Chen Yin absolutely won't care about being controlled by others. For the Chen family... unless Chen Yin himself can pass the trial of the Purple Mystery, they're destined to be controlled and swept along by the currents, whether they are Holders of the Profound or not.'

'And Sima Yuanli... everyone knows his compliant and agreeable nature. He's not an emotional person at his core. Even if Sima Xunhui had some ability to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm on his own, Sima Yuanli would be overjoyed at the chance to serve under a True Qi master!'

'After all, being a Holder of the Profound isn't entirely a bad thing. In the eyes of most cultivators, Yang Zhuo is the undisputed master of True Qi. To be his Holder of the Profound today means you could be a Meritorious Official tomorrow when his True Qi is perfected. Who's to say one couldn't become a figure like Jielin or a Judge then?'

'Ultimately, in the eyes of lower-level cultivators, this is still an incredibly tempting and brilliant path!'

The status of a Holder of the Profound was viewed differently from different angles. The only ones truly hindered were those who had no intention of following the Yang Clan to the bitter end, or those who harbored other ambitions.

Unfortunately for them, the members of the Li Clan fit both descriptions perfectly.

The Daoist Master considered this for a long time before asking,

"This is for those who rely on being Holders of the Profound to form a divine ability. What about those like Situ Huo or Liu Bai, who became Holders of the Profound after already forming their abilities? How many restrictions do they face?"

This was not a simple question; it touched upon the attitudes of opportunists like Situ Huo who were sitting on the fence. Li Jiangliang held nothing back, speaking softly,

"Far fewer! The more divine abilities one has when becoming a Holder of the Profound, the lighter the influence. A Great Daoist Master with perfected divine abilities could borrow and return power at will. But... the moment they borrow, they are suspected of borrowing heavily from the external Profound Mystery. A figure with perfected divine abilities would never touch such a thing!"

Li Ximing understood and nodded, offering a word of comfort.

"At least your life-mandate is still your own!"

The words were half reminder, half consolation. Li Jiangliang nodded gently. The Emissary of the True Light Cloud, a man who stood above ten thousand in the Song court, replied,

"Indeed. 'True Qi' is not like Bright Yang; it doesn't demand fealty from hermits. One's life-mandate remains one's own, and the path of perfecting one's divine abilities or reincarnating for another attempt at cultivation remains open."

Li Ximing chose his words carefully.

"Even if your life-mandate is your own, is reincarnation the only path left? Is the restriction from 'borrowing heavily from the external Profound Mystery, leading to Spirit-strangulation' truly so great?"

Hearing this, a solemn look appeared on Li Jiangliang's face.

"Daoist Master, do not underestimate the power of those words. Strangulation means to be trapped with no way out, to be choked to death. A divine ability in this world possesses its own will and intent. By borrowing heavily from an external Profound Mystery, you become entangled in the karma of a certain Fruition Attainment. Not only does your own divine ability become impure, but it is also rejected by other Fruition Attainments. A mighty True Hornless Dragon who touched two positions had to obediently accept its fall!"

"In ancient times, the divine paths were many and manifest positions were as numerous as trees in a forest. This tragedy played out for generations. It reached a point where the Three Profoundities all had teachings cautioning seclusion, advising that cultivators with great ambition were like unmarried maidens. If they saw gods or Divine Monarchs in broad daylight, they should 'cover their faces and flee'... It might sound like a joke, but the cruelty within is plain to see!"

Li Ximing sighed inwardly and nodded in approval.

Li Jiangliang then changed the subject.

"There is no room for negotiation in this matter, but the Emperor has a mind to see things to completion. When I had an audience with him, the Emperor mentioned that during his reign, if anyone were to perfect their divine abilities and master the five methods, he would not be stingy. He would return their autonomy, allowing them to shed their karmic ties and reincarnate, fulfilling their desire to seek immortality."

Li Ximing finally let out a breath and nodded.

"To serve the court and pursue the true path, a perfect balance!"

Li Jiangliang offered a polite smile and a nod, but they both knew the weight of "perfected divine abilities." In other words, if someone truly had the skill to perfect their divine abilities, how hard could breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm be? Would such a person truly lack a sliver of the Martial Cultivation's light?

The refined, golden-eyed young man sighed.

"I know my own limits... I am but a mediocrity who relied on Bright Yang to attain the Dao. I have some talent, but even if I'm lucky enough to reach the Purple Mansion Realm, I'll never cross the Purple Mystery, let alone have what it takes to achieve the Great Dao... Perhaps those words were meant for my elder brothers."

Li Ximing, however, read a different meaning into it.

'Whether it was meant for them or not, in the eyes of every cultivator in the Song Kingdom, when one person attains the Dao, their entire circle ascends with them. As the Song Emperor's most trusted official, does Jiangliang even need to cultivate himself?'

This opened up a new perspective, giving Li Ximing a glimpse into the minds of the various families, and even the two sons of Bright Yang. He clapped Li Jiangliang's shoulder and said,

"The path you walk is one they all envy."

Li Jiangliang could only offer a wry smile. He bowed deeply and said,

"This junior will go see the old master now..."

Li Ximing nodded repeatedly, watching him depart. Amid his feelings, he began to take stock of his recent gains.

'This Mystic Tablet Edict Pill... it probably shouldn't be refined immediately.'

Refining this Spiritual Treasure would take time, and a considerable amount at that. 'Hengzhu' belonged to the Prime Virtue of the Three Shamans and Two Rites and was deeply connected to the 'Whole Pill'. It ultimately had to be given to Li Que'wan.

'Que'wan will be returning home soon. I'm not a Whole Pill cultivator. If I refine it today, she'll just have to refine it again when she gets the Spiritual Treasure back... wouldn't that be a waste of effort?'

He suppressed his anticipation, stored the weighty Spiritual Treasure, and reviewed his priorities.

'With the Underworld matter still unresolved, alchemy will also have to wait. Zhouwei's injuries come first. The array and the mystic realm can be dealt with after.'

He found himself with a moment of leisure. After a brief thought, an idea came to him.

'I have two urgent tasks. The Song Emperor sent a 'Horn Wood' spiritual item during the great battle. I can take some time to concoct a batch...'

'Also... Helian Wujiang's legacy will take some effort to refine.'

This task should have been on the agenda long ago, but while the number of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the Li family was growing by the day, he was still short-handed when it came time to use them. This put Li Ximing in a difficult position.

'Even when Que'wan returns, she can't be tasked with refining a Spiritual Artifact. Jiangqian got a treasure and immediately went back into seclusion. It looks like I'll have to rely on Nanwu... ask him for a hand... I can always give him a few more pills.'

He descended on the wind, landing on the upper reaches of Gardenia Scenery Mountain. He took out his alchemy furnace, placed it in the center of the array, and first brought out the newly acquired Azure Proclaimation Spiritual Artifact.

This Azure Proclaimation bottle had already acknowledged him as its master and was named the 'East Life-Mandate Vase'. It shimmered with an eight-sided luster. Li Ximing stroked it fondly. Considering he had no Azure Proclaimation Foundation Establishment items on hand, he summoned a stream of 'Serpent Origin Spirit Water' from his storage pouch and filled the vase to the brim.

Then, with a focused brow, he infused it with his divine ability and dharma power. He would wait until dusk, when the azure talismans on the vase's body lit up one by one, before leaving it to be slowly nurtured by the ambient spiritual energy.

Li Ximing knew he still had to wait a year. He set it down with some regret and took out the 'Chuchun Hanging Wood' gifted by the Song Emperor.

The spiritual wood was no wider than two fingers and a finger long. Its deep, pleasing green, nestled in the box, made it look like a piece of precious jade. Li Ximing closed his eyes to sense it for a moment, then reached into his storage pouch and pulled out a 'Neck Feather'.

'It's a shame I have no Valley Water spiritual resources. Mansion Water... Mansion Water isn't quite usable either. If only I had Pristine Water!'

He currently had a mountain of gains, but he couldn't immediately convert them into usable resources. Most of the spiritual items he had were for major purposes, and his spiritual resources were nearly depleted. He pondered for a moment and came up with a solution.

'Wenqing from Purple Smoke is heavily injured and in poor condition. At least she has the Song court to look after her. But Lingu Lanying is even worse off. I can go ask them to pool some spiritual resources. Once I've refined this batch of pills, I can give them each one!'

Although Li Zhouwei's injuries were severe, and he didn't know how many pills would be needed, Li Ximing had no better option at the moment. He looked at the setting sun in the distance and was about to get up when he saw the array stir. An old man was rushing up the mountain.

It was Li Xuanxuan.

Nourished over the years, the old man's complexion had improved greatly, and his steps were nimble. He had dismissed his attendants and ridden the wind up the mountain himself, his eyes filled with worry.

"Grandfather!"

Li Ximing's tone softened as he hurried to support him. But the old man pushed his hand away, anxious and uneasy, sighing with a frown.

"Matters of divine abilities... I am but a minor cultivator and no longer understand them. I shouldn't have disturbed you, but the rumors outside all say the King Wei is gravely injured. If I didn't ask, I would be failing in my duty as an elder."

Li Ximing had been swamped with work these past few days, with no time for anything else. The old man had already shown incredible patience, remaining calm and collected in Ting Province no matter what rumors flew. But when Li Jiangliang came to bid farewell, it was impossible for the old man not to ask. After getting confirmation from the Song court's esteemed Holder of the Profound, a seed of panic had finally taken root.

Li Ximing was both touched and pained. "It is this junior who has been remiss... Grandfather need not worry about the King Wei. It is troublesome, but not a crippling blow!"

The old man raised his eyebrows, carefully studying his expression. Only then did he let out a sigh of relief.

"That boy, Jiangliang, spoke at length. But just as he was leaving, he brought up his father's injuries, handed me a box, and said a single sentence. He left in such a hurry, as if afraid I'd give it back!"

"Hmm?"

Li Ximing was stunned for a moment. The old man had already carefully taken a jade box from his sleeve and placed it on the jade table. When Li Ximing's spiritual sense swept over it, he froze on the spot.

Inside the box were two bottles, a flask, and a piece of jade.

The bottles contained a profound, grayish-bright substance, its colors contained within—the marvel of Valley Water. The flask held a liquid that rose and fell like mist and rain, weaving and changing—the essence of Pristine Water. The final piece of green jade was bursting with vitality, its faint wood grain revealing it to be a Horn Wood resource!

Li Ximing murmured, "Spiritual resources?..."

"Four spiritual resources?!"

Li Xuanxuan couldn't actually identify these four items, but his age gave him some experience. Yet, even with some mental preparation, he was still moved. His face was a complex mask of emotion, his old eyes filled with astonishment.

"He said something about being an unfilial junior, unable to alleviate his father's worries. He heard I was ill earlier but couldn't come to visit. So he hurriedly took a box from his sleeve and said, 'Father is injured. I asked several friends and pulled some strings with Tianyou's network to obtain two 'Valley Water' spiritual resources, the 'Treasurefall Water'... My two elder brothers were also concerned. Third Brother received many rewards and happened to have a 'Pristine Water' resource, the 'Heart-Cleansing Spring Essence'. Second Brother is less well-off... he didn't have anything related on hand, but he went around to other families and traded for a 'Horn Wood' resource, a 'Life-Manifesting Green Leaf'...'"

The Third Brother Li Jiangliang mentioned was naturally Li Jiangxia, who was currently high in the Song Emperor's favor and received more rewards. Second Brother Li Jianglong's standing had clearly declined since Yang Ruiyi's fall from grace, yet he had still managed to squeeze out a spiritual resource!

'Four spiritual resources!'

The words landed with a heavy thud, catching Li Ximing completely off guard. The Li Clan had flourished in recent years, but he had been the one running around, traveling everywhere, using his alchemy skills or being ordered about by others, all for a few spiritual resources... Li Ximing knew better than anyone how much effort those four resources represented!

'Although they are Holders of the Profound and have not yet reached the Purple Mansion Realm, they don't have much use for these things yet. But they should be preparing for their needs after reaching the Purple Mansion... they should be the ones treasuring these resources the most...'

And if one were to be honest about it, both Li Zhouwei as their father and Li Ximing himself had long since come to see Li Jiangliang and the others as figures of the Song court, implicitly excluding them from the family's internal structure, leaving only the tie of blood.

That was why this was so unexpected!

'Jiangliang understood this in his heart, which is why he quietly passed it to the old man...'

Li Ximing let out a long sigh, glanced at the jade box in his hand, and said with a lump in his throat, "To think we put them through such trouble."

The old man beside him sighed, understanding his meaning.

"By the bonds of father and son, it wouldn't be wrong for us to accept this now. But when the time is right, we should find a way to repay them."

Li Ximing could only nod, his head lowered in thought.

'Now Valley, Pristine, and Horn are all gathered. These three spiritual resources, combined with the 'Chuchun Hanging Wood', form a complete set of monarch, minister, assistant, and courier herbs. I no longer need to consider making a batch of seven or eight 'Dispersion' pills to share with others. I can refine three pills, keeping one or two in reserve for emergencies!'

'This batch... will surely be a sacred healing medicine!'

Valley, Pristine, and Horn had no major conflicts; in the Dao of healing, they subtly complemented each other and wouldn't require too much effort to refine. The trace of worry on Li Ximing's brow finally dissipated, replaced by a smile.

Just then, the old man spoke.

"It's not often I get to see you, Daoist Master. There are a few things I'd like to ask about while I have the chance."

Li Ximing raised an eyebrow.

Li Xuanxuan continued, "Once a divine ability cultivator enters seclusion, time becomes meaningless. But I've given a lot of thought to the matters of the Suiyu generation."

"Please speak, Grandfather!"

The old man nodded. "Suiyu generation has many talented individuals. While they can't compare to Jiangque generation, they are still among the best. I don't need to arrange much in that regard. My main concern is their descendants."

"Although Suihuan took a concubine early on, he remains childless. Now that he's reached Foundation Establishment, we should choose a wife for him, so his chambers are not empty."

Li Ximing casually sent the 'Three-Cycle Garrison-Profound Fire' under the furnace and tossed the jade-like 'Life-Manifesting Green Leaf' inside to refine, asking,

"Does Grandfather have someone in mind?"

Li Xuanxuan said, "There is a candidate. Her age is suitable, her background is clean, she is the descendant of a loyal official, and she reached Foundation Establishment at a young age. The art she cultivates is also of a high grade, and her appearance and talent are not lacking..."

"Oh?"

Li Ximing's interest was piqued. He ran through the names in his mind and had a vague idea. When he asked, he heard Li Xuanxuan say with a smile,

"Ding Yujing."

Li Ximing recognized the name—it was Ding Weizeng's only daughter! She had just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and he had met her not long ago. She cultivated the family's 'Palace-Yang Tiger' art. Was she not the descendant of a loyal official?

Li Ximing was quite surprised. He did a quick calculation with his fingers and said,

"She seems like a good match... The girl has a compliant personality and would make a fine partner. What is the situation between Suihuan and the Ding family?"

A smile finally appeared on Li Xuanxuan's face.

"The two have known each other since childhood and later worked together. I asked privately, and there are no issues on Yujing's side. As for Suihuan... Yujing is excellent in both appearance and character. He is a wise and sensible man, why would he refuse?"

"As for Guest Retainer Ding... I'll have to trouble the Daoist Master to ask."

"I understand."

Li Ximing nodded with a smile. Li Xuanxuan said with satisfaction,

"As for descendants, some have many, some have few. Zhouda achieved Profound Thunder early and switched cultivation arts early, making him popular with the ladies. He has many children, even two after reaching Foundation Establishment. He dotes on every one of them himself, which pleases me the most. It's a pity none of them are exceptional..."

A hint of a smile appeared in Li Ximing's eyes.

"I know about that! Zhouming mentioned to me... Zhouda served in the Jade Court. When he wasn't drinking and fighting, he was taking concubines..."

Li Xuanxuan shook his head helplessly, then turned serious.

"And then there is Jiangchun!"

At the mention of this, Li Ximing also felt a tinge of regret.

"That is not for us to decide. He is a Purple Mansion Realm prospect for our family and cultivates Sword Intent. We cannot bend his will. If his marriage is unhappy and causes him trouble that resurfaces during the boundless fantasy trial to obstruct his path... We can only let him follow his heart..."

Li Xuanxuan had considered this as well. He sighed.

"I will write a letter and tell Zhouluo to 'work harder'!"

"As for Suikuan... he has two concubines and already has children, so we need not worry. It's only Suining. I've asked him twice, and he has refused both times—that child is deep-minded and highly talented. He spends all his days buried in cultivation. He has great ambitions."

Li Ximing shook his head.

"He has a secret. King Wei even asked the fox-kin about it; it's a kind of fortuitous encounter. With Suikuan around, the bloodline is close. We can have a child adopted over at worst. We shouldn't force him."

Li Xuanxuan actually preferred for everyone to have their own heirs, but hearing this, he could only let it go. He raised a hand.

"There is one more important matter... the two children from the your uncle's line! Qingduo has gone south, but Qinggong is still at the lake, cultivating Embyronic Breathing. You, Daoist Master, are a dragon who shows his head but never his tail. I was thinking of taking this opportunity to settle his Dao Lineage..."

"Uncle's line..."

Li Xuanxuan clearly held high hopes for this child, personally coming to a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master to request a cultivation art for him, so he could start absorbing qi early and not waste time with a hasty choice later. Li Ximing pondered for a moment.

"Since it is for a new branch of the lineage, the cultivation art should be different from what we currently have."

The Li family had a fair number of Purple Mansion cultivation arts. Setting aside those in the High Firmament Pavilion, even from Li Zhouwei's own collection, the better ones included the Cold Qi art 'Cold Snow Lonely Peak Classic,' the Upright Wood art 'Mountains Gaze South Classic,' and the Merging Fire art 'Dao Fire Merging Heart Classic.'"

'Among these three, the 'Merging Fire' art is the most prestigious, but its power is immense and can harm one's mind... The 'Cold Qi' art is truly mediocre, judging by that Demon beast from before. And the 'Mountains Gaze South Classic' is nothing special...'

As for arts like the 'Vast Mountain on Earth Classic,' the 'Responding Stone Glazed Light Classic,' or even the 'Profound Peak Mountain-Moving Sutra,' they were even less worthy of consideration. Li Ximing had no good options on hand. In the end, his thoughts fell back on the High Firmament Pavilion.

He said, "The cultivation arts I have are not of the highest grade. Let me ask King Wei and give you an answer then."

Li Xuanxuan could only nod.

He said quickly, "I won't disturb your alchemy. When you have news, just send someone to inform me!"

Li Ximing saw the old man out of the array, then returned to the furnace. He calmed his mind and focused, forming hand seals and chanting incantations before the blazing True Fire, refining the spiritual resources while adjusting the complementary ingredients. Around him, light and shadow intertwined as time flowed on.

...

The Great Void.

A dark, lightless ocean. In a place unseen by any, a streak of profound and inexplicable color flew through, hiding in the gloom as it slowly advanced.

It was the Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure, the Profound Bestowal Glazed Talisman!

This Supreme Yin Spiritual Treasure from the Nine Mounds Daoist tradition was a true eye-opener for Li Que'wan. The Li Clan was a major family with numerous Foundation Establishment-level concealment artifacts, but most could only hide one's aura while remaining stationary. Only a few precious, top-grade artifacts could conceal one's figure while moving slowly.

But this Profound Bestowal Glazed Talisman not only allowed for free movement while concealed, it could travel through the Great Void at a speed only a fraction slower than her normal pace!

'With this item, I could roam the world, passing before the very eyes of various Dao Lineages, and no one would ever know? Even if I offended countless divine ability masters, I could use this treasure to hide from disaster... It is truly a supreme treasure for preserving a Dao Lineage!'

Holding the talisman, Li Que'wan felt completely at ease. After parting ways with Guo Nanwu, she had even passed by Deer Weeds and Long Helm Island, places where she had spent long years in cultivation. She resisted the urge to go in and share the good news with Liu Changdie, continuing all the way to the mainland.

'My breakthrough definitely can't be hidden from the Underworld, nor from the major figures at the top. But by keeping a low profile, I can at least fool some of the Purple Mansion cultivators below and make them misjudge the timing. That would be an advantage.'

She thought it through carefully, then noticed the terrain of the Great Void becoming dramatically steep. A quick calculation with her fingers and her brows furrowed.

"What terrifying spiritual qi..."

At this point, flying in the Great Void was a waste of time. She took a step forward and entered the mortal world. The brilliant sunlight shone down, leaving the woman stunned.

'Where... is this...'

Before the perilous cliffs of the White Sea, below the sky-piercing sword peaks, lay a vast and primordial forest plain.

The land was immense, connecting the north and south. Ancient trees reached for the sky, and rolling hills rose and fell like waves on the ocean. The myriad forests vied in beauty, and rivers like white silk ribbons wound their way through the hills. The spiritual qi was like a waterfall. It was a true paradise beyond the mortal world!

What was even more peculiar was that the sky above this forest plain was filled with what seemed to be an endless expanse of gentle, beautiful, azure verdant wind. Like threads of silk, it spread from this region to the north and south. While it had no effect on a Purple Mansion divine ability cultivator like Li Que'wan, it would undoubtedly be fatal to lower-level cultivators—it had become a strange land where even Foundation Establishment cultivators dared not fly high!

'This...'

It was common knowledge that plains were rare in Jiangnan, mostly concentrated in the west and north. With the great lake carving out a chunk, they became even scarcer. The most famous were the Mushroom Forest Plains and Shanji Prefecture...

But the hills before her were low, with vast flatlands, rivaling the Mushroom Forest Plains in size. To the north, it connected to the White Sea, and to the south, to Shanji. Countless rivers branched out from here like a network of veins, flowing into the sea. Even with the endless verdant wind in the sky, it didn't stop this place from transforming the entire northern part of the Song State into a fertile paradise!

'This is... Lake Xian?!'
