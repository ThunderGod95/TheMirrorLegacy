# Chapter 437: Yufu's Affairs

Li Xicheng suddenly choked up, shaking his head helplessly. He took out the jade slip containing the sect system from his sleeve and handed it over to Li Xijun, then said softly, "The new system has just been established, and most of the positions are still vacant. However, Uncle Ping can still manage the family affairs for now. We should hold on to the current personnel... They will be reassigned eventually. You can see for yourself."

Li Xijun looked at his older brother in surprise, then took the jade slip and examined it closely.

"The Dual Clan System..." he murmured softly.

As he continued reading, he understood the peak and town counterbalance system described at the end. Going back to the front, he carefully read about the Dual Clan System again.

After a long silence, he remarked softly, "Clan Uncle... He's splitting the four lineages and planning to establish a government on a peak... Is this still a family?"

Li Xicheng, alarmed by what he perceived as a bold remark, asked in a deep voice, "What are you trying to say?"

Li Xijun's face turned gloomy as he replied, "With this approach, we'll become the Lijing Sect instead of the Li Family of Lijing! The harmony of a family is maintained through generational continuity... If the members are scattered among the various peaks, how can it still be considered a family?"

Li Xicheng cast a glance at him and asked quietly, "What do you propose?"

"Just a few modifications to be made," Li Xijun replied, looking again at the jade slip, feeling that something was amiss.

"This one only details the sect system, not the clan's system. External cultivators and those from the branch family can be distributed among the peaks, but not the major and minor sects," he added.

He swung his sleeves and rode the wind toward the central hall.

Meanwhile on Mount Lijing...

Li Yuanping had worked tirelessly for over a year, finally setting up numerous systems in place. As his workload gradually reduced and his efforts began to show results, he felt a sense of relief.

Big Brother has been cultivating in seclusion. I wonder how much longer before he'll emerge again and how confident he is to achieve a breakthrough...

Just then, a commotion erupted in front of the central hall. Li Xijun, who was dressed in white, hurried into the hall with a frown. He kneeled and bowed deeply, speaking in a solemn voice.

"Nephew greets the Family Head!"

He's here!

Li Yuanping had been waiting for him for a long time. With his current influence in the family, no one could contest the new law. Only the younger generation dared to voice objections, so he smiled and asked, "What do you think, Jun'er?"

Li Xijun's bright eyes met his clan uncle's gaze. He was not about to criticize the plan outright and embarrass Li Yuanping. Instead, he took a different approach to the matter.

"I have a request to make!"

"Go on," Li Yuanping encouraged him and listened attentively.

He enjoyed conversing with this nephew of his tremendously. Li Xijun always managed to voice his objections tactfully, without causing discomfort to anyone.

"My request is to rebuild the Snake Demon Cave Dwelling on the lake, fill in the lake to create an island, and establish a department there. We should move the direct lineage of the family, along with the most talented minor sect members, to this island to cultivate and use it as the headquarters of the Li Family."

He added softly, "Jun'er understands your vision. What I mean to say is... the Dual Clan System should not turn our family into a sect."

"Li Family on the lake and offices on the shore of the lake..." Li Yuanping smiled slightly and nodded.

Li Xijun then stepped forward, pointing to the map, and explained, "The lakeside will serve as a base for managing matters related to external cultivators and protecting the mortals. Meanwhile, the lake itself will house the cultivators from the four direct lineages of the family and the talented members of the minor sect...

"One day, when Moongaze Lake is unified, we can then move to the heart of the lake, where the marketplace ruins are. From then on, we'll become the exalted immortal clan of the lake, and the areas around the lake will become a prefecture..."

Li Xijun's ambition was evident in his firm gaze. Li Yuanping listened with growing excitement.

Li Xijun continued, "I have explored the cave. Although it is not suitable for growing paddies, it's quite spacious and rich in spiritual qi, making it ideal for cultivation! There's no formation protecting the cave, so our people have gradually withdrawn since the ancestor's death. Isn't it nice to be able to put it to use again?"

After making his point, Li Xijun lowered his gaze and added, "This is just my humble opinion..."

Li Yuanping shook his head with a smile and assured, "Humility is not needed here! My father has already sent word to Shanji Prefecture in the east and asked the cultivators of the Profound Peak Gate to move the mountain and build the island. He just wanted to keep it a secret to avoid any ambushes!"

Li Xijun was momentarily taken aback before he sighed in relief.

"So, clan uncle has had this plan all along... I was overthinking and speaking ignorantly!"

Li Yuanping laughed and asked, "Do you remember the Rui Family?"

He pulled out a vermilion brush, circled a spot on the map, and explained, "The earth vein of this mountain is weak, but the water vein is rich, and there is a spirit spring. I intend to ask the members of the Profound Peak Gate to move this mountain and place it on the lake to serve as our family's main peak!

"We can eliminate the influence of the Green Essence Copper and utilize this spirit spring directly, saving the family from having to purchase one. Not only that, isn't it wonderful to have another peak?"

The Li Family had acquired a Vein Searching Technique from the An Family years ago, known as the Earthly Court Detection Technique, which allowed them to thoroughly investigate the earth and water veins.

Li Xijun listened to the explanation and replied, "Can the earth and water veins still be used after the move? Will the spirit spring disappear? It's best we request the people from the Profound Peak Gate to assess whether these resources will remain viable after the relocation first."

Li Yuanping smiled and replied, "It's not really a big problem. Currently, twelve families on the eastern shore have pledged allegiance and are paying tribute to us. We can select the most suitable one and offer them some compensation for the relocation... It won't cost much."

Li Xijun sighed with relief, a smile spreading across his face. He stood up and said, "Uncle, you are wise! It seems like I was worried for nothing."

Li Yuanping's expression grew serious. He sighed and said softly, "Jun'er, there's something I would like to tell you... Your father passed away early, and the generation of Xi and Yue has more members in the minor than major sect. If anything were to happen to me, the family would rely on you. Xicheng is your elder brother, so I can't speak ill of him... Ximing has let us down too. As an elder, this is the best I can do for my family."

Having worked tirelessly for years, Li Yuanping's complexion had deteriorated, and his smile was no longer as warm and pleasant.

He continued in a subdued tone, "After this matter is settled, I will gradually step back from family affairs. You will need to take charge."

On Mount Yuting...

Li Ximing sat cross-legged. The true essence of the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Technique flowed around him, casting hues of gold and red in the dim room.

He slowly opened his eyes and exhaled a wisp of golden qi.

Perhaps due to lingering doubts about the divine abilities of the Man on Creek, the elders had imposed a surprisingly light punishment—just confinement. Everything else remained unchanged. He was still eligible to receive pills and resources from the family but he was no longer burdened by family affairs.

Although he was confined to this lonely little courtyard, any resources he required were promptly sent to him at all times. Li Xijun also visited him occasionally.

Li Ximing felt as though a heavy weight had been lifted from his shoulders. Feeling much at ease, his cultivation progressed rapidly too.

"This is the best," he murmured to himself.

He practiced diligently every day and studied alchemy texts in his spare time. Considerate of his needs, Li Xijun frequently sent spirit items for him to practice with and aptly named his residence the Alchemy Pavilion.

Free from the clan's affairs, Li Ximing focused solely on refining pills and cultivating, channeling all his guilt into his work.

Li Ximing had poor mental fortitude. Under intense pressure in his youth, he often fantasized about becoming a Dharma relic—one entirely devoted to cultivation and pill refinement, calmly sitting atop the fire vein.

As long as he could continue to contribute tirelessly, he would not have to worry about disappointing his father.

I guess I'm pretty much living my childhood dream right now!

Li Ximing tapped his storage pouch lightly, causing a furnace to emerge and land on the ground with a thud. It was pitch black and supported by three legs, adorned with intricate patterns of waves and beasts and engraved with the name—Furnace In The River.

He retrieved a white and yellow wooden block, an Embryonic Breathing Realm spirit item known as Precious Pearl Wood.

Bringing his palms together, he summoned a pale golden Pill Flame.

Li Ximing nodded with satisfaction.

As expected of a Grade Four cultivation technique, the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual is truly remarkable. Since its true essence is pure yang energy, the Pill Flame it conjures surpasses the original.

"To refine the Yangqing Pill, I should use the Precious Pearl Wood with Blazing Sun Tri-Nine Technique."

This was the knowledge Xiao Yuansi had accumulated over time. Li Ximing placed the wooden block at the bottom of the furnace and took out a jade box. Using his mana, he picked up the Yangqing Fruit and added it to the furnace.

He slowly extracted the essence, then added a few supplementary medicinal ingredients, one after another.

Finally, he used the Pill Flame to continuously refine the mixture. After about an hour, six pale red spirit pills emerged from the furnace.

"Yangqing Pills, Embryonic Breathing Realm... complete!"

These six pills could sustain six Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators for several months, but it had only taken him an hour to refine. Li Ximing stored them with a special method, feeling a deep sense of satisfaction within him.

"Father... Ximing has not failed his elders."

Had his Yang Essence not been broken, he would definitely have had a chance to refine an extra half of the pill. Reflecting on this, he bowed his head silently, then took out more spirit items from his storage pouch, and prepared to refine another batch.

Having relocated from Xu State, Profound Peak Gate had settled in Shanji Prefecture.
𝗳𝚛𝚎𝚎𝘄𝕖𝕓𝕟𝕠𝚟𝚎𝕝.𝗰𝕠𝐦

The gate's sole guardian was Daoist Master Changxi, and most of its members cultivated earth elemental profound techniques. Since Shanji Prefecture was quite large, there were many members in the Profound Peak Gate.

The Profound Peak Gate was relatively modest, with only a few Foundation Establishment cultivators and disciples who were not particularly arrogant.

While Li Xuanxuan's arrival was being reported, he was warmly entertained by two outer disciples. Being the weakest of the seven gates, Profound Peak Gate had only a handful of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators and its disciples were quite humble.

Li Xuanxuan waited at the foot of the mountain with the old monkey until a cultivator came down to meet him.

Dressed in white, the cultivator's good looks were spoiled by the moles on both cheeks that somewhat diminished his temperament. Adorned with various jade ornaments, he smiled and said, "Greetings, fellow Daoist from Lijing! I am Kong Yu of Profound Peak Gate. May I ask for your name?"

Despite being a peak Qi Cultivator, Kong Yu was very courteous. Surprised by his humble demeanor, Li Xuanxuan quickly replied, "I am Li Xuanxuan from the Li Family."

Kong Yu smiled and asked, "And the Celestial Moon Sword is...?"

"He's my second uncle!"

Upon learning of their close relationship, Kong Yu nodded approvingly and added, "Our Daoist Master was present when Senior Tongya slayed the Maha with his sword. He praised your esteemed family's swordsmanship, noting that even within the Wanyu Sword Gate, the Li Family's sword skills are exceptional!"

"Senior is too kind," Li Xuanxuan replied modestly.

Kong Yu sighed and continued, "If it weren't for the devil plague and the ongoing conflicts between the Wanyu Sword Gate, Chunyi Dao Gate, and Crimson Reef Island over the Green Pine Temple Ruins, someone would have sought guidance from your family already. It's a pity that Senior Tongya missed his chance for greater fame!"

Li Xuanxuan thought to himself quietly.

Pity, huh? The current top swordsman in our family is Jiao'er, who is comparable to Xuanling from back then... But he can't possibly match Second Uncle, who had already grasped sword qi when he was only at the Jade Capital Stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Without the rise of the Devil Plague, his reputation might have faded long ago...

Seeing that Li Xuanxuan was not interested in discussing this matter further, Kong Yu got straight to the point.

"Are you here to discuss changing the earth vein and relocating the immortal mountain, fellow Daoist?"

Li Xuanxuan nodded and replied, "I've heard that your immortal gate is reputed to be the best in Jiangnan when it comes to this sort of thing. After all, Mount Changxi was moved from Xu State and earned the acclaim of Profound Peak. I wonder if I could enlist one or two fellow Daoists to assist us..."

Kong Yu nodded. His gate was indeed specialized in such tasks, and while being hailed as the best in Jiangnan might be an exaggeration, being the best in Yue State was certainly well-deserved.

"Of course, we can assist you! The cost will depend on the earth vein, I'll need to inspect the land to determine the price. Once you decide, I will retrieve the dharma artifact immediately," he said.

Li Xuanxuan nodded in understanding and Kong Yu left to retrieve his belongings. Shortly after, he returned, hurrying down the mountain with a string of golden ropes around his waist.

"Let us be off then!" he exclaimed excitedly.

Kong Yu was an affable person. As they rode the wind together, he laughed and said, "Fortunately, my senior and junior brothers aren't here... Otherwise, this job might have been taken by someone else. Being stationed at the peak is a tough assignment! Nothing compares to enjoying the scenery and earning cultivation resources."

Li Xuanxuan chuckled. He had appreciated a lot of scenery and could agree that it was a nice change of pace compared to staying in the clan. He responded warmly, and Kong Yu let out a sigh.

"I have to say, Brother Xuanxuan, you and my eldest senior brother are quite alike. He governed the gate in his early years but was later killed by monsters... Seeing you, I'm reminded of him."

Li Xuanxuan offered some words of comfort, but Kong Yu seemed indifferent. Noticing that Kong Yu was heading west, Li Xuanxuan asked, "Why are we not passing through Yufu Prefecture? There are fewer devil cultivators there... Although you're from the immortal gate and quite powerful, there's no need to take unnecessary risks..."

Many disciples from the three sects and seven gates had fallen victim to the devil plague. Kong Yu shook his head at Li Xuanxuan's suggestion and replied, "We can't go through Yufu Prefecture. The gate has imposed a ban on it for the next three years. Trust me, if you go there, you might face dire consequences!"

"What?"

Li Xuanxuan's face paled. Having come from Yufu Prefecture with the old monkey, he found the area calm but was now deeply concerned and asked, "Why is that? I just came from Yufu Prefecture... Am I in trouble now?!"

Kong Yu took several steps back in the air. His face was filled with fear, and his voice trembled as he asked, "Did you linger there...? Did you say anything? Did you save someone's life?! I heard that Senior Li Tongya was closely associated with Daoist Master Chuting... How could you not have heard the news?!"

Li Xuanxuan shook his head and replied, "No... No, I just passed through. When I left home, the ancestor was still..."

"Then you should be fine!" Kong Yu sighed in relief, and a smile slowly returned to his face.

He assured, "Don't worry, as long as you haven't made any connections in the prefecture and haven't spoken a word there, you aren't implicated. There's nothing to worry about. If you get involved, it could be disastrous."

"Not knowing the details could lead to the destruction of your family though," he added.

He stepped forward, causing the jade pendants and jade buckles on his body to jingle, and he said mysteriously, "I've heard that even the Azure Pond has withdrawn its forces from Yufu Prefecture. The three Daoist Masters—Yuanwu, Yuansu, and Yuanxiu—are all focusing on sending this disaster out of Jiangnan and back to Mount Luoxia!"

Li Xuanxuan, still puzzled, asked, "Could you explain in more detail?"
