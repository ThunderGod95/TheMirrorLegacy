# Chapter 417: Setting Sun

"I know," Li Yuanjiao said, waving his hand dismissively.

He picked up the storage pouch he got from the Embryonic Breathing Realm devil cultivator he had killed earlier on his way home and began sifting through its contents quietly.

"The clan's vault still holds the mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm Azure Blades... We can sell them to build the emergency funds. As for that Six-Stone Cloud Plate... It's a rare dharma shield produced by the Azure Pond. We should keep that for ourselves," he said thoughtfully.

After considering his options, he finally put the pouch away, adding, "Considering this was an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator, the capacity of his pouch is small‚Äîhardly the size of a tabletop. Everything inside is probably worth only ten Spirit Stones in total."

Despite this, the devil cultivator was actually considered wealthier than most of his peers in the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Li Yuanjiao stowed the items just as Li Qinghong, who had been quietly observing, spoke up.

"The second lineage has nothing much to offer, but I have nine Spirit Stones. You can have them, Big Brother."

Without waiting for a response, she handed the stones to Li Yuanjiao, who accepted them silently.

"Thanks, I owe you."

Li Xizhi was his only son. Selling dharma artifacts was the limit of what he could leverage from the clan without causing a scandal. In other families, such actions might have led to accusations of selfishness and provoked internal strife, and it is not something that could be settled with a mere discussion.

Li Qinghong merely shrugged and chuckled.

"They're yours now."

They looked at each other for a moment before a smile broke across their faces. As soon as Li Yuanjiao put away the pouch he was going through, he took a few more Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts out of the store room. He unfolded a map and scanned it briefly, intending to find a marketplace.

"Now that the Cloud Crowned Peak market is destroyed, it takes much longer to reach other marketplaces," he murmured while analyzing the map before him. He initially planned to head to the Yuan Family's market but after estimating the distance, he realized that the Smoke Valley Market to the west in the desert was much closer.

"I'll head to Smoke Valley Market then! With communications being so unreliable now, this is a good chance for me to meet up with Uncle Donghe."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Yuanjiao packed his belongings on the mountain hastily before departing. The snowfall intensified, drifting like goose feathers and blanketing the town and mountains in white. Li Xijun, accompanied by a group of elders, bid farewell to Li Ximing before returning to the mountain himself.

He walked in the snow with his hands clasped behind his back. His thin and bright clothing stood out against the increasingly ethereal landscape.

Unlike his elder brother Li Xicheng, who was burdened with many clan responsibilities, Li Xijun enjoyed an easier role at the Clan Affairs Courtyard. He spent his days training in seclusion, occasionally descending the mountain to slay demons.

After walking about a dozen li, Mount Yuting loomed ahead, its peak covered in snow and peppered with green pines.

"Upon Yuting's pines the snow falls, chasing away evil with its silent thrall..." Li Xijun murmured.

Having cultivated on Mount Yuting for many years, he had seen the pines multiply, and the mountain itself seemed to stretch ever higher, almost piercing the clouds. Li Qinghong, the town's guardian, wielded thunder to vanquish demons. The four towns at the base of Mount Yuting often celebrated her with poetry. Li Xijun had read some of them and even remembered a few lines.

Approaching the mountain's base with his sword in arms, he was met by two figures who bowed respectfully upon seeing him.

"Greetings, Young Master."

They were the An Family's brothers‚ÄîAn Siming and An Siwei. Both of them were a few years older than Li Xijun, and were sent by Li Yuanping to train at Yuting Peak.

An Siming had a sword at his side, while An Siwei carried a spear on his back. Both wore gold rings around their wrists. Li Xijun exchanged a few pleasantries with them before opening the grand formation with a secret seal. The golden light flickered slowly just as it opened.

An Siming stepped forward, hesitating before saying softly, "Young Master, our younger sister at home is twelve this year. She has a spiritual orifice and is in the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm... Not only that, she has a lovely face and..."

He looked rather awkward and was stumbling slightly over his words. Li Xijun, holding his sword, stepped forward with the grand formation closing behind him. He trudged through the snow, asking, "Is Master An thinking of aligning An Family with the second lineage through marriage?"

Both men affirmed eagerly, then offered some nice words. However, Li Xijun merely laughed and said, "After my father's passing, the second lineage is now led by my aunt. If she and the clan agree, I can certainly meet your sister."

Upon hearing his reply, the two brothers could only nod in agreement. Li Xijun gazed at the white snow dusting the pines and sighed.

"This matter is not ours to decide..."

The An brothers nodded in understanding. Running his thumb along the sheath of his sword, Li Xijun let his thoughts wander.

The An Family members are all very talented. If Second Uncle fails to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, at least my two brothers-in-law will become peak Qi Cultivators in fifty years... By then, perhaps my father-in-law will also reach peak Qi Cultivation Realm or beyond...

He caught a falling snowflake and watched it melt in his palm.

The An Family is unaware that my family is protected by a mirror... They likely worry that if their daughter marries into our first lineage, their children could meet a grim fate, and marrying into the second lineage might require them to shoulder the heavy responsibility of overseeing the family's affairs.

An Zheyan is probably clueless, so Li Feiruo had to send these brothers to test the waters.

Just then, a clump of snow fell from a green pine, disrupting Li Xijun's thoughts. He smiled at the brothers and said courteously, "I'm ascending the mountain to resume my training."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Yuanjiao had been riding on the wind for half the day and he crossed the center of Moongaze Lake to its western shore. The area was dotted with both large and small mountain ranges, home to dozens of immortal cultivation families. Most were Embryonic Breathing Realm families, with very few being Qi Cultivation Realm families.

This region was under the domain of a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm rogue cultivator named Daoist He, a recluse who had little to do with the wider world, subsisting on offerings collected within his small parcel of land. The nearby families wisely chose not to provoke him.

Continuing along the western shore, a towering mountain that split the sky soon came into view. The terrain was rugged and narrow with a stark, rocky summit, and the spiritual energy here was sparse. Known as Xiping, this mountain marked the boundary between the arid desert and Moongaze Lake; it also served as the frontier between the Azure Pond Sect and the Golden Feather Sect.

After traversing Mount Xiping, the climate immediately turned hot and dry. Days of flying brought the gradual emergence of yellow sands, and soon, an imposing pass loomed ahead‚ÄîSmoke Valley Pass, an ancient stronghold in Yue State, now occupied by the Golden Feather Sect's Smoke Valley Temple.

As Li Yuanjiao approached the pass, his spiritual sense detected the heat and light of a powerful grand formation, ready to activate at a moment's notice.

"Li Yuanjiao from Lijing's Li Family has arrived to pay respects. Please open the grand formation, Temple Master!" he said as he transmitted his voice via mana.
ùêüùóøùêûùöéùö†ùêûùöãùïüùê®ùöüùêûùïù.ùïîùï†ùöñ

Moments later, a Daoist priest emerged from the formation. His cultivation was modest, at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. However, his half-yellow and half-white robe looked somewhat unusual. Nevertheless, he greeted Li Yuanjiao with a broad smile.

"Greetings, fellow Daoist! I am Bai Yinzi from Smoke Valley!"

Li Yuanjiao returned the smile, observing the priest's overly humble demeanor and eager expression.

"Are you here to see Daoist Donghe? Come with me inside, fellow Daoist!" the man said in a welcoming manner.

Although Chen Donghe had resided here for many years, Li Yuanjiao was still too wary to follow the man inside. His gaze lingered on Bai Yinzi's face before chuckling and resting his hand on the hilt of his sword.

"I prefer to stay here. Please get Uncle Donghe to come out here," he said.

Bai Yinzi's face fell slightly as he wiped the sweat on his face, his lips quivering as he replied hesitantly, "I'm afraid that won't be convenient! Daoist Donghe has sustained injuries and shouldn't be moving around... It's better for you to come inside, fellow Daoist."

Li Yuanjiao laughed and replied, "Is that so?"

Bai Yinzi breathed a sigh of relief, his smile returning. However, as Li Yuanjiao advanced a step forward, his expression abruptly hardened, turning fierce.

"Such audacity!" he boomed.

He had already unsheathed the Qingche Sword. The blade gleamed brightly, emitting a piercing whistle as Li Yuanjiao executed the Celestial Moon Slash technique.

Bai Yinzi felt a sharp cut on his face. With a horrified cry, he hastily summoned his earth-yellow Tortoise Shield dharma artifact, pleading miserably, "You've misunderstood me, fellow Daoist! Spare me... please!"

Li Yuanjiao, however, was not inclined to trust this man. Thoughts raced through his mind like lightning.

Is Uncle Donghe still inside? He's trying to lure me into the formation... there must be no other Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators around. I must hold him hostage and see if I can negotiate for Uncle Donghe's release. If that doesn't work out, I can at least avenge him!

As these thoughts flashed through his mind, his sword arc struck the shield. This Tortoise Shield, likely a prized dharma artifact of the temple and appearing to be of high-grade Qi Cultivation Realm, wailed under the impact. The Qingche Sword, a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma weapon, proved far superior.

Bai Yinzi's face flushed red from the exertion and fear as he cried out desperately, "Daoist Donghe! Come quickly! Your family is about to kill me!"

These words caught Li Yuanjiao off guard, and he relented slightly.

"Let go of your dharma artifact and I'll spare you!" he said.

Bai Yinzi's face was still crimson. He shut his eyes and stood frozen on the spot as the light on his dharma artifact slowly faded. With his sword held to the man's throat, Li Yuanjiao was somewhat convinced by the man now and began to feel rather awkward.

"Young Master! Young Master!"

A middle-aged man flew out of the formation, looking pale and with several medicinal packs attached to his body. He smiled wryly and assured Li Yuanjiao, "This is a misunderstanding..."

Li Yuanjiao sheathed his sword, then bowed slightly to Bai Yinzi and apologized with mild embarrassment.

"Sorry, fellow Daoist..."

Still trembling with fright, Bai Yinzi muttered, "I see... Such is the might of the sword immortal clan... Half of my soul nearly fled my body as soon as you raised your sword."

Chen Donghe also apologized to Bai Yinzi. Having regained his composure, Bai Yinzi waved off the incident and simply replied, "It was my poor choice of words that caused the misunderstanding... I should be the one apologizing. You have been most gracious, Young Master!"

Despite being away from home for many years, Chen Donghe respectfully addressed Li Yuanjiao as Young Master, consequently influencing Bai Yinzi to do the same too. Li Yuanjiao said nothing and simply allowed them to address him that way.

With the misunderstanding resolved, Bai Yinzi let out a long sigh and was finally comfortable enough to speak normally.

"It's no surprise that your esteemed clan could thrive in the treacherous territories of the Azure Pond Sect, expand its territory, and ascend to become such a prestigious clan... Such determination is truly beyond my emulation!"

Having sheathed his sword, Li Yuanjiao's stern features relaxed. Although he no longer looked as vicious as earlier, he still looked rather fierce.

Bai Yinzi clicked his tongue in admiration before continuing, "The Golden Feather Sect, under which I serve, also imposes a hefty immortal tax. Yet, it's nothing compared to the ruthless measures of the Azure Pond Sect. They obliterate opposition at every opportunity. Even when temples are annexed, we must report to the Golden Feather Sect before proceeding with any further mergers, and we certainly do not resort to killing everyone..."

"In my opinion, the Azure Pond Sect and Gold Tang Gate behave no differently than devil cultivators. Let's keep our conversation between us, lest we be accused of slandering the immortal sect..." he added with a slow shake of his head, almost as though in dejection.

Li Yuanjiao listened patiently to Bai Yinzi's tirades. As soon as Bai Yinzi paused to catch his breath, Li Yuanjiao seized the opportunity to turn to Chen Donghe, his voice filled with concern as he asked, "What has gotten you into this state?"

"Devil cultivators!"

Chen Donghe was now at the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. A smile appeared on his pale face as he explained, "A few days ago, a band of devil cultivators headed north, passing by Smoke Valley Temple over Mount Xiping. I helped the temple cultivators defend the grand formation, but I sustained some injuries and have been bedridden for many days. I requested the temple master to come out and greet you, but I didn't know that would end up causing a misunderstanding..."

Upon hearing this, Li Yuanjiao pressed further, eager for details.

"Where did those devil cultivators go?"

"After a prolonged battle, they crossed Mount Xiping and likely headed to the west shore," Chen Donghe replied.

Li Yuanjiao estimated the timing and realized he likely could not catch up to them now, so he could only sigh regretfully.

The fact that those devil cultivators failed to breach this grand formation meant that most of them were early-stage Qi Cultivators. If Li Yuanjiao could rally the cultivators in his family to intercept them, they could potentially eliminate the threat and loot them to amass funds.

Li Yuanjiao then retrieved several pills from his storage pouch and handed them to Chen Donghe, whose own supply had long been depleted in the fierce battle. Gratefully accepting the supplies, Chen Donghe expressed his gratitude.

He smiled and introduced the other man, saying, "This is Bai Yinzi, the temple master who has greatly aided me over the years, providing everything from rations to spirit vein support. He is truly a kind and honest soul!"

Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist and acknowledged Bai Yinzi, while Bai Yinzi waved his hand and laughed.

"Daoist Donghe has also been a great help to me over these years... He has defeated several rivals at the temple fair. I owe him much for the support and am more than happy to provide food and lodging for him."

Chen Donghe responded with a warm laugh, and Bai Yinzi continued enthusiastically, "Fellow Daoist Donghe is a good-natured person. Even those he has defeated admire him... He's earned quite a reputation across this desert over the years!"

The two continued conversing for some time. Bai Yinzi then invited them both back to drink and feast until the sunset. Eventually, Chen Donghe finally returned to his courtyard with Li Yuanjiao.

As they closed the door behind them, they activated an isolating formation. In the center of the courtyard sat an old woman, her face etched with wrinkles around her eyes and on her forehead. She held an oil lamp which illuminated the paper she was writing on with a brush. Looking up as the two men entered, she greeted them softly.

"Ah... You are here, Jiao'er."

"Auntie..."

Li Yuanjiao hesitated for a moment before recognizing her. Li Jingtian had aged significantly, now over fifty and drastically different from his memories, except for her eyes, which remained as gentle and warm as ever.

It was rare for mortals of Mount Dali to reach such an age. Chen Donghe had been nourishing Li Jingtian with spirit items, so she still seemed to be in good health.

With a smile, she asked, "How is everything at home? Is Second Uncle still doing well?"

Hearing her questions, Li Yuanjiao's composure faltered, and tears welled up in his eyes. He shut his eyes, his hand gripping the hilt of his Qingche Sword which buzzed and vibrated with his emotion.

With a sorrowful tone, he revealed, "The Old Ancestor has left this world to express his gratitude to the Supreme Yin..."

Upon hearing this, Li Jingtian's face immediately paled and tears streamed down her cheeks. Chen Donghe also seemed to be taken aback by the news as the expression on his face changed and he stood frozen in place.

"I see... this moment has finally come..."

Although Li Jingtian had received a few pieces of news from home and had somewhat mentally prepared herself, Chen Donghe reacted as if struck by lightning, his face contorted in disbelief.

"Impossible... How can this be?!" he cried aloud.

Chen Donghe, normally composed even in the direst of circumstances, had completely lost his composure. His face contorted with a torrent of emotions. Taking a few steps back, his eyes darkened as he uttered in disbelief, "Unless a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator intervened, who could possibly have killed Second Uncle?!"

Without thinking, Chen Donghe had also addressed him as Second Uncle. His face flushed as he gasped for breath. Li Yuanjiao quickly reached out to support him, channeling qi through his meridians. After a moment, Chen Donghe coughed up a mouthful of black blood.

Since he had sustained internal injuries, his complexion visibly improved after he spat out the blood. Looking up, he asked, "Was it an old wound from Maha?"

"Yes..."

With this confirmation, Chen Donghe wiped away the blood from the corner of his mouth and murmured, "The heavens must be envious of the talented... To think that all the four brothers of Lijing died so silently!"

Li Yuanjiao turned his head away slightly, as the family had not acknowledged Li Chejing's death. Chen Donghe, who had supported them for years, must have had his reasons for keeping such matters close to his heart. Now, overcome with emotion, he had let the words slip.

After being comforted by Li Jingtian for a moment, Chen Donghe regained his composure. He hung his head and apologized, "I'm sorry you had to see that."

Unable to find the right words of comfort, Li Yuanjiao continued to focus on helping Chen Donghe fix his meridians.

Chen Donghe then remarked, "Please allow me to rest for a bit. Tomorrow, I will take you to Smoke Valley Market."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, and the couple supported each other as they moved toward the inner courtyard.

Soon after, the sound of muffled sobs could be heard from the doorway.

Li Yuanjiao sat in silence and was lost in his own thoughts, now all alone in the courtyard. The tea on the table remained untouched, its colors mingling with the hues of the blood-red sunset.

He rested his hand on his knee, gazing toward the red sun dipping below the desert horizon as he let out a sigh. Smoke rose in shapes that resembled serpents, whales, wolves, and snakes, all melding into the dark red distant sky.
