# Chapter 1138: The Grand Method

Spiritual Qi swirled and settled, crimson light drew inward.

Within the purple-gold hall, a riot of color filled the hall. Seated at the head of the chamber, the red glow between the young man's palms faded. As the jade token at his waist grew warm, he slowly opened his eyes, and a flash of light swept through the hall, causing all energies to subside.

‘With the help of pills, cultivation has become much faster. Though it still can't compare to the past, the Crimson Severing Arrowhead has turned into a tedious grind.’

Li Zhouwei's cultivation speed was truly terrifying. What he called a 'tedious grind' would be considered an astonishing leap for others, yet he felt a hint of regret. He then noticed someone knocking outside and said casually,

"Come in."

The palace doors opened slowly, and Li Jiangzong entered with an air of urgency.

"My King, I have come to see you!"

Li Zhouwei waved a hand dismissively and asked,

"Did you take our youngest grand-uncle back?"

Li Jiangzong nodded.

"Reporting to my King, it took him over three months to pay respects to the ancestors and meet with the elders of the various lineages. Then, it took another two months for the elders to seriously select a suitable child to be adopted—after all, it concerns the lineage's descendants. The elders were very thorough, assessing every detail. And then, the old master was so welcoming that our grand-uncle couldn't refuse... so he stayed another two months."

"He left five months ago. My King, you have been in seclusion for more than a year."

Li Jiangliang and his wife had naturally departed earlier. Li Zhouwei had taken the opportunity to meet with Li Yuanqin once, but time in the Purple Mansion Realm passed in a blink. After returning, he had entered seclusion for a full year. He asked,

"Which child did he take back?"

Li Jiangzong replied,

"The old master originally told him to choose from the SuiYu generation, but they were all grown up, and he didn't like any of them. So he had to go down another generation and adopted a pair of twins. It wasn't strictly according to the rules, but the old master was so happy he was willing to return that he let him have his way."

"The two are the eldest and second sons of the QingYuan generation. He even chose their names himself. One is named Li Qinggong and the other Li Qingduo."

"A pair of them?"

"Yes, a pair," Li Jiangzong said. "The old master couldn't bear the thought of the ancestral incense continuing to dwindle outside the family, and he thought that one person should remain by the lake to light incense for Lord Xiangping. Both children kowtowed and acknowledged him as their ancestor, with one staying by the lake and the other sent to the south."

"That's a good method," Li Zhouwei praised, his heart filled with a profound sense of peace.

Li Jiangzong knelt down respectfully.

"I apologize for the disturbance, my King, but it's not about this matter... My third brother has returned with two of the royal lineage... They have come of age and can begin cultivation, and they specifically returned to see you. The old master approved as well, and they are waiting for you in the palace!"

"Jiangxia?" Li Zhouwei's expression shifted slightly. "It is time I see them."

Li Jiangzong was immediately overjoyed and was about to speak, but a crimson light flared before his eyes. The colors swirled and intertwined, then suddenly lit up. The Li Zhouwei he was looking at was now seated on a magnificent golden throne. His majestic face was illuminated by the Heavenly Light from both sides, and his golden eyes shone brilliantly.

From all around him came a respectful chorus: "We greet King Wei!"

He followed suit and knelt, looking around to find that he had already been transported to the Golden Palace on the island!

‘King Wei’s divine ability is becoming even more transcendent!’

He quietly retreated to the side. The entire golden palace fell silent. Li Zhouwei looked out and saw Li Suining standing beside Li Xuanxuan, his face free of any anxiety. His gaze then swept over Li Jiangxia and quickly landed on the woman behind him, who looked nervous and anxious.

A pair of children were holding her hands.

"Father!" Li Jiangxia stepped forward, leading his beloved concubine and children before him.

The Holder of the Profound of the Purple and Gold Palace was clearly uncomfortable with his current lowered state. His face was pale, and the drop back to the Foundation Establishment Realm left him with a feeling of danger, as if his life could be controlled by another at any moment. He was slightly out of breath.

Li Zhouwei looked at the two children and a smile finally graced his face. He raised an eyebrow.

"Come closer. Let me take a look."

Zou, who came from a humble family, was filled with dread, whether facing the Li clan that dominated Ting Province or King Wei, who did not kneel before the emperor. She knelt, her face covered in cold sweat, urging her two children to go forward.

Li Suichu stared at his grandfather's golden eyes without any fear. He took a few quick steps up the stairs, bowed respectfully, and said,

"Greetings, Grandfather!"

Li Zhouwei stood up, bent down to look at him closely, and sighed with a smile.

"You really do resemble your father!"

At these words, a complex expression appeared on Li Jiangxia's face. He led his daughter forward, bringing her close.

"Father, this is Zhi'er."

Li Zhouwei turned to look at her, playfully saying a few words, but the girl's face remained deathly pale. She did not dare to look at him, clutching her sleeve tightly.

Li Suining stood below, smiling as he watched his third uncle's two children, a hint of sorrow in his heart.

In his second life, all the Li family members were scattered in the north, separated by thousands of miles, so Li Suining had no idea what happened to his uncles. But in his first life, he knew with certainty... Li Suichu had died in battle in the north.

As for Zhi'er, Li Jiangxia's cherished darling, she had married Lin Caiyin of the Lin clan. A year later, news came that she had suffered a cultivation deviation and died of severe injuries. A year after that, Lin Caiyin was imprisoned for speaking disrespectfully. If not for Lin Chensheng's protection, he would have lost his life as well!

‘A direct descendant of Wei, cultivating an orthodox lineage... cultivation deviation...’

He lowered his eyes, remaining silent, until the Daoist Master smiled.

"What grand method do they cultivate?"

Li Jiangxia bowed and replied, "Suichu cultivates the Radiant Fire. He has come home this time to request a Dao Lineage. As for Zhi'er... I happened to get a Wandering Metal lineage and wanted her to cultivate the Gazing the Metal Apex. It was left to me by an old friend."

"As long as you have a plan in mind."

This matter only required Li Zhouwei's approval; he did not need to be concerned about it. King Wei let out a laugh and looked at the old man below.

"Old master, have they paid respects to the ancestors?"

Li Xuanxuan nodded solemnly, letting out a sigh.

Li Zhouwei, however, understood what Li Xuanxuan meant: the had clearly not received the divine favor. He subtly reached into his sleeve and took out a pair of small swords. They were a brilliant golden color, no longer than a forearm. He blew gently on the two swords, and fine specks of light fell, their radiance contained. King Wei smiled.

"Your Uncle Jiangzong has some talent in artifact forging. He once crafted this pair of golden swords to celebrate my birthday. Today, I'll give them to you as a gift."

Li Jiangxia smiled but said nothing. Zou, on the other hand, was overwhelmed with gratitude, as if she had been spared from disaster. She pulled her two children and repeatedly thanked him. They retreated to the middle of the hall. Li Jiangxia said nothing more, bowing his head.

"Your son is stationed in the north. I've already delayed too long. May you be well, Father. Your son will depart immediately."

Li Zhouwei nodded, watching the family leave. He brought his hands from behind his back to his chest and said,

"You are all dismissed."

"Yes!"

Everyone bowed and withdrew, soon leaving only Li Xuanxuan and Li Suining, who was helping him. The old man saw Li Zhouwei give a slight nod and then went down as well. At the palace doors, he seemed to hesitate, turning his head. Seeing that Li Suining had escorted him to the entrance and stopped without a word, he felt at ease and continued on.

The great hall instantly fell silent. The formation activated, isolating the inside from the outside. Li Suining bowed before him.

"This junior has something to report and has disturbed my King's cultivation..."

That was right... before Li Jiangzong had requested an audience, it was Li Suining who had awakened Li Zhouwei!

Now, besides Li Ximing and Li Xuanxuan, only he could bypass the ranks and directly reach this place to interrupt Li Zhouwei's cultivation!

The jade pendant in his hand could contact Li Zhouwei at any time. He could even crush it to instantly summon King Wei to his own cave dwelling! However, his conduct had always been respectful, so he did not dare to activate the token inside his own dwelling. Instead, he had bowed outside the hall, waiting for an audience.

He prostrated himself and got straight to the point, saying respectfully, "This junior has a grand method to offer!"

Li Zhouwei smiled, sounding quite expectant. "Oh?"

Li Suining raised his hands and offered the white jade slip he was holding between his palms. Li Zhouwei took it. With a sweep of his spiritual sense, his expression changed abruptly.

The Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam.

This method was based on the mystery of a Spiritual Artifact, imitating the techniques of Vault Metal and Protecting Wood, harmonizing the two to absorb the anomalous energies of heaven and earth, summoning a change to seize the profound and collect spiritual essence! Because it was based on the mystery of a Spiritual Artifact, it was more like a simple grand method than a spell art!

The so-called "anomalous energies of heaven and earth" included the energy of mountains shifting and seas overturning, the leaking energies of earth veins and fire veins, and the gathering energies of strange and profound lands... such as the Radiant Fire fire vein in a certain part of the Eastern Sea, the malevolent aura in the lake beneath the Wave-Suppressing Mansion, or the scattering malevolence when the Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple received the Proclaimation Earth...

Although the conditions were demanding, this method could bind these energies and transform them into resources. If the collected spiritual essence was good enough, it could even condense spiritual resources for the Purple Mansion Realm.

Most importantly, these things included a portion of the Five Virtues' phenomena!

‘This is the starting point of the grand method. It's not for some spiritual resources!’

Li Zhouwei was shaken. Four words immediately came to his mind.

‘Break through the Purple Mansion!’

‘Conceal Jiangqian's Purple Mansion phenomena!’

He took the matter of Li Jiangqian very seriously, even more so than his own cultivation, which was now of little consequence to him. Li Zhouwei had long thought about concealing this phenomenon!

‘One reason is to keep it as a trump card. The second... is to reduce suspicion!’

From Li Ximing to himself, the time it took to break through was terrifyingly short. Li Zhouwei had destiny on his side, which made it easier to explain. Jiangqian could be barely be covered up, but when Que'wan broke through one after another, people would connect the dots. Everyone would have hit the same point in just over a decade, which would surely arouse suspicion!

Li Ximing's decision to send Li Que'wan to the Peacock Sea had a certain consideration behind it.

Methods of concealment were not unheard of. He had secretly gone to the Heaven of Sun and Moon's Shared Radiance, where there were roughly two kinds. One was a profound spell art that was not only expensive but also extremely difficult to learn, a great waste of both time and resources. The other was simpler but had strict requirements, needing divine abilities like the Untraceable Presence of Upper Shaman or Convergence of Valleys of Valley Water. Bright Yang cultivators could not do it.

He had intended to discuss this with Mount Dali, but Qingyu Qian had obtained the Sacred Scroll of the Heaven-Governing Sequence and hastily entered seclusion, from which he had yet to emerge. Li Zhouwei had even inquired about the methods within the scroll, considering using the Yang clan's help.

But after a long consideration, he had not acted.

‘First, the people of the Underworld cannot easily come to the lake due to the Azure Insight Origin Mirror. They are also unwilling to come to the lake. The more important point is... if a grand method is used, someone needs to maintain it constantly. Whether it is the spell arts from the hall or Suining's Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam, it requires a person to constantly cast the spell...'

‘This would also be extremely suspicious. At this point, a normal Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would never use such a method, because there is more than enough time!’

He had given up on the idea. But now, this Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam solved his most pressing problem, and the shock it gave him was far from over!

‘The Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam requires a Protecting Wood Spiritual Artifact that has a mysterious ability to contain... It can only collect just over half of the Five Virtues. Among the Fire Virtue, the only ones it's incompatible with are the Merging Fire, which is associated with sickness and pain, and the Blazing Fire, which is associated with rectifying Wood Qi... What does this mean?’

‘It points directly to the Heavenly Nurture Urn and Jiangqian. One could say it was tailor-made!’

The Divine Ability remained silent, and Li Suining lowered his head, his heart pounding.

Where did this Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam come from?

It was an ancient spell art that Li Que'wan and Daoist Master Yuanbian had jointly modified! It was specifically for the Heavenly Nurture Urn. In his previous life, it had been given to him. As a half-Divine Ability cultivator in the Mystic Realm, he had constantly maintained it to hide the breakthrough phenomena of their grand-uncle, Li Jiangchun!

But in his second life, Li Jiangqian's phenomena were completely exposed without any concealment!

He lowered his head, feeling a little guilty. Li Zhouwei did not ask how he had come to possess such a spell art. Instead, he examined it closely, his eyes gleaming.

"This thing of yours has solved a major problem for me!"

As soon as he said this, Li Suining became more relaxed. With a mind full of thoughts, he quickly said,

"That was my thinking too! If my grand-uncle can leave seclusion quietly, with his abilities and the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument and the Crimson Gold Hundred-Turn Spear, he will be of great benefit to the situation in the north and south!"

‘This kid even knows about the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument...’

Li Zhouwei uncharacteristically let out a couple of laughs and reminded him,

"That... the Crimson Gold Hundred-Turn Spear... he should not have acquired it yet."

"Oh..." Li Suining was momentarily at a loss for words, giving an awkward smile.

After all, he himself was not in the Purple Mansion Realm and had only achieved the breakthrough in the grotto-heaven late. He only knew that the Double Fire Twin-Light Instrument and the Crimson Gold Hundred-Turn Spear were famous weapons that Li Jiangqian had acquired very early on...

As he was trying to find something to say to ease the awkwardness, the man before him turned his golden eyes to stare directly at him. With a raised eyebrow, he smiled, and a voice that made Li Suining shudder instantly came:

"You can even guess when he will leave seclusion?"

Li Suining had not expected him to see through his little plan in an instant. He opened his mouth but couldn't say a word.

Having gained the secrets of his second life, all he had done in his cave dwelling, besides researching the ratios of the mystic realm Profound Foundation, was to write this cultivation method. Yet, he had held onto it, not giving it to Li Zhouwei for a long time, and he had his own reasons for that!

‘The phenomena is a matter of the Shengyang Acupoint rising and a resonance with heaven and earth. By the time a sign appears, it is too late to stop it. Therefore, all spell arts that can hide the phenomena need to be maintained at all times. The Method of Concealing and Summoning of the Profound of the Captured Beam is no exception. Handling an affair of this divine magnitude is fraught with difficulty!’

Therefore, Li Suining had not given this spell art to Li Zhouwei in advance, which would have been a waste of Li Zhouwei's time. Others didn't know when Li Jiangqian would leave seclusion, but he did!

He was momentarily speechless, but Li Zhouwei had gotten the exact information he needed and was in a great mood. He revealed the Heavenly Nurture Urn with its wooden grain carvings in his hand. In just a moment, a magnificent cascade of divine power surged out.

King Wei laughed and said, "How much time is left?"

Li Suining had deliberately left time for Li Zhouwei to familiarize himself with the grand method. Seeing that he had mastered it in an instant, he secretly praised him in his heart and said with a smile,

'Three days!"
