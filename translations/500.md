# Chapter 750: Husband And Wife

Lu Sisi...

Of course Li Xizhi had heard that name, the internal and external family histories both have records of this man. After the elder finished speaking, Li Xizhi silently pondered, Ancient matters from long ago... Why bring them up again? Things with no meaning now... What exactly is Yu Yuwei trying to say...

Yu Yuwei paused for a moment, then steered the conversation back with a smile, saying, “Just idle chatter... Back then, our families were closely allied, and my family was united. Times have changed, we’ve lost contact with the Ning Family. I merely asked when I heard that Moon Lake Peak had fallen into their hands.”

He cupped his hands respectfully, then slowly withdrew, finding a small courtyard to cultivate in.

Li Xizhi listened with a thoughtful expression. He also found a quiet courtyard and sat down peacefully, thinking, Could he be warning me that the Ning Family is untrustworthy... Matters between the two families hinge on uncle. I have a decent grasp of the situation. This kind of reminder, it’s his way of extending a subtle courtesy.

Thinking it through, with the deaths of Li Tongya and Li Yuanjiao, ties between the Li and Xiao Families had grown distant. As long as the Li Family faithfully guarded the west for them, there was little interaction. The Xiao Family had since sealed their mountain and grown ever more reclusive.

They were once close with the Yuan Family, but that too grew distant and eventually broke off. The Li Family then gravitated toward the Ning and Yang Families, their political alignment had shifted over the course of a century, no more.

Such is the way of the world... closeness and distance eventually turn to separation. If I hadn’t personally handled the Qingsui Peak affair, we might have broken with the Yuan Family outright.

Love and enmity fade in an instant. Human sentiment is hollow, like standing atop a needle’s point.

A faint gloom rose in his heart as he reflected, The Ning Family has long been loyal to the Chi Family. For hundreds of years, they likely had relations with families like mine and the Yu Family. Yet now, all that has vanished? Would the Chi Family simply sit by? Their deep resentment toward the Li Family... it probably ties back to this.

With Yuan Su's death, the Ning Family has grown weaker, and now they’re being pushed into conflict with my family... It’s not a good look. Things are still manageable for now, but if the situation becomes urgent... something is bound to happen.

The stars and moon had risen in the sky. Li Xizhi sat upright in the courtyard, dust thick on the windowsill. His eyes shone like stars, and one hand rested on the stone table as he murmured inwardly, “It all hinges on uncle. Ning Heyuan is two-faced, and Ning Hejing is a trusted agent of the Chi Family. When there’s no harmony in interests and no depth in sentiment, how can anything last?”

———

Xu State, Mount Yan Pass.

Traveling north from Moongaze Lake into Xu State and crossing the Great River, one would reach Mount Yan Pass. This place was already close to the Golden Tang Gate. Looking up, one could faintly glimpse golden light atop the distant peaks.

Of course, the Golden Tang Gate was now tightly sealed, nothing remained but Mount Golden Tang itself. Li Qinghong flew out of the pass on a bolt of thunder-light, seeing only endless golden light, while roiling devil smoke surged from the distant horizon.

Directly across from Mount Yan Pass were the forces of the Dao of Great Desire and various devil cultivators. The land before the pass was vast, with a long defensive line. For months now, the devil cultivators had been growing restless, this was one of the most fiercely contested fronts in all of Azure Pond Sect’s defenses.

She had been stationed here for several months, and the probing skirmishes were growing increasingly frequent. Kongheng and Li Wushao had been reassigned elsewhere and were no longer at her side.

Among the cultivators under Li Qinghong’s command, only Li Minggong and Chen Mufeng were from her own household. An old acquaintance was also present, Fei Tongyu of the Fei Family, who, despite being the family head, had been dispatched here and now stood quietly in a corner. The rest were a mix of cultivators from various families.

This arrangement had only one purpose, to prevent cowardice or inaction in the face of danger. The great families had been deliberately mixed across the defensive lines, forcing every segment to support one another without bias.

Li Qinghong closely observed the devil smoke to the north, it was far more massive than previous scouting waves. She took out the jade ring issued to her and saw it glowing entirely red, with only a few dim white spots.

“Take your positions in the formation. Prepare to engage!” She gave a command and pulled a spear from her storage pouch. The other cultivators hurried into formation. As she focused her gaze, a dozen figures emerged from the black smoke.

The Qi Cultivation Realm devil cultivators were of no concern. Her attention was fixed on the pair leading them. The pair was husband and wife, both at Foundation Establishment Realm. The woman was gentle and charming, her aura clearly at the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. She held a delicate brocade fan. The man appeared cold and aloof, wielding a blade and possessing slightly stronger cultivation. He was likely at the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

The couple led their devils to the formation’s edge. The woman flicked her snow-white robe and said with a smile, “Daoist ahead... may I ask which branch of Azure Pond Sect you hail from?”

Li Qinghong stared at them coldly without replying. The couple’s subordinates weren’t idle, they cast spell arts at the formation. Soon, black-clad figures emerged at their feet, devil cultivators of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, who took quite some time to reach the frontline.

Though outnumbered, the defenders within the formation counterattacked under its protection. Thunderous blasts erupted. The devil cultivator couple noticed no response from Foundation Establishment Realm defenders and thought to themselves, Could it be that no Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators are currently inside the formation...

They immediately launched their dharma artifacts. Li Qinghong couldn’t allow them to attack unchecked, so she rose into the air and flew out from the formation.

When the devil woman saw her appearance, her eyes lit up, and she withdrew her artifact, calling out, “Daoist! Daoist, please wait!”

Li Qinghong flew using only mana, not revealing her foundation or true cultivation. She replied coldly, “Who’s your fellow Daoist!”

The man simply stared at her coldly, while the gentle devil woman laughed lightly and spoke, “In the end, we’re all comrades of the devil Dao... Though our Dao lineages differ, the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Daos once belonged to devil cultivators as well... Why can’t we address each other as Daoists?”

Li Qinghong angled her spear, thunder gathering silently within its shaft. She gave no reply. The woman quickly spoke, “Daoist... you and I are both merely pawns. Why escalate things? Just send out half the cultivators in your formation, and I’ll allow you to kill half my little devils. We’ll report accordingly, and call it even...”

Li Qinghong didn’t believe a word. She merely laughed coldly, “Send them out? You wish!”

The gentle woman wasn’t surprised. She exchanged a glance with her husband and said helplessly, “Daoist, how heartless! Why must things always come to violence...”

Li Qinghong smiled brightly and replied, “The ones in my formation are my kin and comrades. I can’t trade them like that. But how about I offer a spirit item in exchange for one of your devil heads?”

“Oh?” The gentle woman and her husband exchanged a glance, thinking to themselves, Even if we can’t lure her into weakening the formation, there’s no harm in at least seeing the treasure...

So Liu Qiao smiled and said, “Wonderful! Please, Daoist, let us see it... I am Liu Qiao, and this is my husband, Helian Changguang. May we ask your name?”

Li Qinghong had no intention of giving her name. She didn’t believe the devil cultivators’ introductions anyway.

She simply pulled out a small point of white light and said softly, “Take a look, Daoist!”

The white light spun once in the air, then shot directly at the couple’s faces. Liu Qiao's expression shifted, but Helian Changguang seemed prepared. He flicked his sleeve and released a black cloud that wrapped tightly around them both.

The flickering white light stopped in midair, hovering brilliantly. Li Qinghong frowned and asked, “What’s the meaning of this?”

Liu Qiao hesitated for a moment and moved her wrist as if to explain, but Helian Changguang seized her wrist tightly, his face stern, and pulled her backward.

He growled, “You may have fooled her, but not me.”

Before his words had even faded, the white light burst forth, expanding in the blink of an eye. Concentrated lightning exploded outward, shifting from pure white to violet-white, then splintered into a torrential rain of lightning that lit up the sky with vibrant hues.

Boom!

Even the devil cultivators on the ground below were stunned and breathless. They had no choice but to raise their dharma artifacts in defense as the lightning rain poured down. The cultivators within the formation seized the opportunity and unleashed a barrage of spells.

Morale surged among the defenders. Li Qinghong also seized the moment. She drew her spear, and bolts of lightning formed avian shapes that flew into the crackling glow.

Another thunderous boom resounded as Helian Changguang burst from the lightning. Black qi rose around him, while his face was cold and scorched with soot.

He raised his blade to block the lightning and shouted, “Thunder cultivator!”

Liu Qiao had fared worse. Her robe was charred black, and blood was trickling from her mouth.

She waved her brocade fan, stirring up a gust of dark wind, and said in a low voice, “Damn you... you wretched thing! Once I break your formation, I’ll turn every one of your kin into blood food!”

Li Qinghong’s almond-shaped eyes widened slightly. She said nothing, but silently committed the words to memory. Though the devil pair had suffered heavily from the exchange, they didn’t retreat. They charged her together with black smoke billowing.

Liu Qiao thought to herself, That power must’ve come from a talisman technique... Yet this woman doesn’t understand the art of timing, she should have used it when exhausted to turn the tide. Wasting it early... how fortunate for us.

Helian Changguang was far more cautious. He secretly used mana to transmit a voice message, “Qiao’er, could this woman be a direct descendent of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator? And a thunder cultivator at that... we should be careful!”

Liu Qiao dismissed the concern and replied, “How could she be a direct descendant of a Purple Mansion Realm without even a feathered robe? Besides, where in the mainland is there a great thunder cultivation family? She may be strong, but she must be carrying treasures.”

The two attacked Li Qinghong in tandem as they conversed. Her spear flickered with violet lightning, dispersing the black smoke with ease. After exchanging a few moves, she had already gauged them in her heart, Helian Changguang is quite powerful, while Liu Qiao is weak and unfocused. They are clearly not on the same level. Helian could match an esteemed descendant, but Liu Qiao feels like a mere Foundation Establishment Realm rogue cultivator.

Her thunder spear danced through the air with practiced ease, blocking their attacks completely. Every now and then, she’d suddenly thrust, forcing Liu Qiao into narrow escapes and cold sweats.

Frowning, Helian Changguang took out a skull-shaped artifact and tossed it into the air. Gray-red smoke billowed out, and beams of light shot from the skull’s hollow eyes, enveloping the couple.

Still feeling it wasn’t enough, he retrieved a red agate from his storage pouch and suspended it at his side. It emitted beams of crimson light aimed at Li Qinghong’s eyes.

What a deep arsenal.

Li Qinghong’s eyes narrowed. Her family also practiced perception techniques. It was nothing too advanced, but decent enough to resist the glare without being heavily affected. Still, she could no longer strike at will, and her mind quickly calculated the shift in balance.

The brocade fan and robe on the female cultivator were Foundation Establishment Realm items. It was nothing outstanding, but still respectable. They clearly didn’t match her strength. They were likely gifts from her Dao companion.

Meanwhile, Helian had consecutively taken out two Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts. Though not top-grade, they were clearly sufficient to reveal his identity. He was most likely a direct descendant of some devil family.

Devil cultivators found it easier to forge dharma artifacts compared to immortal sects, albeit they were lesser in quality. Even so, these two Foundation Establishment dharma artifacts were already tipping the fight. One restricted Li Qinghong, while the other protected Helian. They were slowly gaining the upper hand.

After dozens of exchanges, Helian noticed Li Qinghong hadn’t taken out any artifacts or talismans. He breathed easier, and assumed he had been overthinking it. His expression turned increasingly vicious.

He pulled out a blood-colored glow from his pouch and said coldly, “You offered me a bolt of thunder, Daoist. Let me return the favor!”

He flicked his finger, and the blood light fluttered twice in the air, expanding and unfolding as it descended like a fog. Blood dust was now raining down from the sky.

The protective thunderlight around Li Qinghong was soon stained by the blood glow. Her movements grew heavy and her spear slower. She had no choice but to step back and shift from offense to defense.

Boom!

A muffled thunderclap rumbled through the clouds as violet light burst from Li Qinghong's eyes. Her Immortal Foundation, Profound Thunderpool, surged to its peak. It unleashed a blast of explosive lightning that forced the couple to stumble back a step.

Her cheeks were flushed slightly, but she pressed on. Each strike of her spear sent violet arcs of lightning outward. She fought through the suppressive blood light, and her momentum became even fiercer than before.

Helian Changguang parried several strikes before snorting coldly. The red agate that had been floating in the air descended and burrowed into his chest, instantly erupting with blinding black light.

He charged at Li Qinghong, blade in hand, engaging her in the sky that echoed with thunderous bursts. Liu Qiao couldn’t find a chance to interfere; she could only distance herself and send black smoke from her brocade fan to harass Li Qinghong from afar.

“Good...”

Helian's mastery of blade arts was average, but his mana was immense, and his cultivation method top-grade. His technique was solid, and he fought Li Qinghong on even ground for a while. After another few dozen exchanges, he seized a moment amid the black smoke and struck viciously.

But Li Qinghong found her rhythm as she fought. Her inner thunder surged like a stormy sea. Her spear strikes grew more violent and forceful. Not only did she break through his attack with ease, she reversed her weapon and stabbed diagonally with explosive force.

Helian had to expend nearly double his mana reserves just to block the blow. Something felt off; her spearwork was only growing more aggressive and lethal. Not only did her lightning suppress his devil magic, it completely shattered his blood qi techniques, rendering them useless.

Did she take some kind of pill...

He gritted his teeth. Though he hadn't seen her take any pill, devil cultivators knew many tricks. They even stored medicine within their flesh, ready to be absorbed in moments of crisis. It wouldn’t be strange. So he held his ground, weathering her assault.

Li Qinghong’s advantage grew more pronounced as she flung out two violent arcs of thunder. Liu Qiao hurried to block them with black smoke, but in that instant, Li Qinghong’s spear reversed mid-flight, bursting with purple lightning as it lunged directly for Liu Qiao’s face.

“Ah!”

Panic surged through Liu Qiao as she rapidly retreated. But the stored lightning had been waiting, and her defensive smoke was instantly blown away. The searing thunderlight stabbed at her eyes as she desperately retrieved a talisman.
