# Chapter 998: Matters of the Heart

Li Suining’s mind raced, but his expression remained calm. He quickly sorted through his thoughts, prioritizing what was most important.

‘Many powerful cultivators are watching Moongaze. I can’t seem too unusual… I can’t influence the Daoist Masters’ actions, whether they come or not. I can only do my best to save Guest Retainer Ding, just in case.’

‘But where is the Art of the Golden Tablet?’

He grew doubtful, his face a mask of contemplation. He tentatively asked, "The Spiritual Qi harvesting will take a while. I’m afraid I’ll have to wait several years for the Daoist Master to retrieve the technique…"

Li Jiangchun shook his head slightly. "Not necessarily. The Daoist Masters have many subordinates. They can simply trade for it among themselves."

These words resonated with Li Suining, and a sudden clarity came over him.

‘That’s right. In my previous life, I emerged from seclusion after a year and the Spiritual Qi was already available. The Art of the Golden Tablet must have been traded for. Last time, when the Wilderness had that incident, Daoist Master Zhaojing rushed back and didn't leave the lake much. So, it's highly likely… that the Art of the Golden Tablet was sent from the Eastern Sea by Daoist Master Yuanbian!’

‘That also explains why the Art of the Golden Tablet is spiritually compatible with the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court… Daoist Master Yuanbian is renowned for his mastery of array arts and has a wealth of good fortune and treasures. The Sacred Scroll of the Star Court was probably his as well!’

‘Because this latest turmoil in the Wilderness resulted in the loss of Guest Retainer Ding and Dharma Protector An, and the clan once again faces a threat from Buddhist cultivators, the Daoist Master wouldn’t dare to leave the lake until the Yang clan's ascension. Since Daoist Master Yuanbian couldn't enter the mainland himself, and a precious item like the Sacred Scroll of the Star Court couldn’t be entrusted to a minor subordinate, he first sent the spiritually compatible Art of the Golden Tablet!’

A slight weight lifted from his chest. He estimated his guess was at least seventy or eighty percent correct. Only one final doubt remained:

‘If that’s the case, why did I have to choose between the Art of the Watchful Awakening Star and the Art of the Golden Tablet in the previous life? Could it be… there was more than one Dao lineage...’

While he was lost in thought, Li Jiangchun misunderstood and tried to reassure him. "Don't worry. Although you started a bit late, the techniques you’ve been given by the lake and the Daoist texts you’ve studied have all built a solid foundation. The disciples on the island all have to learn them as well…"

Li Suining snapped out of his reverie and respectfully assented, but his mind was on something else.

‘At that time, the sky was filled with gray fire. I wonder who from the north it was…’

His mind settled, and he spoke, hesitatingly, "Uncle… there's something I don't know if I should ask…"

"Oh?" Li Jiangchun was surprised and looked at him with a hint of confusion. He saw Li Suining raise his eyebrows, his eyes a little red, and he sighed. "I was wondering… what the Third Young Master's arrangements in the Wilderness are."

The Third Young Master, of course, was Li Jiangxia.

Li Jiangchun stopped walking and sat with Li Suining at a small table in the pavilion, speaking casually. "What's this about?"

The arrangements of the main family lineage were something Li Suining shouldn't have asked about. Even with Li Jiangchun’s high status and Li Ximing’s regard for him, it was a suspicious question without a proper reason. It was an abnormal inquiry, but Li Suining was prepared. He sighed. "My father died for the clan’s cause in Jiangbei… I never even got to meet him… I heard he was serving under the Third Young Master and Guest Retainer Ding. Since the Third Young Master personally brought my father's belongings back, as his son, having taken my responsibilities on the island, I feel I must go and see this uncle of mine…"

Among the Three Holders, Li Suining was very familiar with the two uncles, excluding Li Jiangliang who was in the imperial court. The Grand General of the North and Left Commander of the Martial Temple was frank and open-hearted. Because of Li Suining’s father, he took special care of him and offered assistance on multiple occasions… Recalling it now, Li Suining still felt a twinge of sadness.

With Li Suining’s identity, he could have visited Li Jiangxia directly. However, Li Jiangxia was currently in the Foundation Establishment Realm. Others might not know, but Li Suining knew very well that Li Jiangxia was in seclusion in the mountains, which also helped him avoid the great tribulation!

When the subject of his father’s death was brought up, Li Jiangchun's eyes were filled with compassion. The turmoil of the last decade had taken the greatest toll on the Li clan's cultivators in the Wilderness, with most falling to the Buddhist cultivators. He lowered his gaze and sighed, confirming, "Third Brother has already gone into seclusion. The Wilderness is now supported by Uncle Zhoufang and An Xuanxin, with Guest Retainer Ding in charge. For now, you should focus on your cultivation."

Li Suining nodded, looking crestfallen, and said in a low voice, "I should also go see Guest Retainer Ding… but a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator’s whereabouts are uncertain, and I wouldn’t want to trouble the elders of the family. Since I have some free time from my cultivation, I'll find an opportunity to prepare a gift and pay him a visit!"

He had made his pretext and brought up the subject subtly. Li Jiangchun didn't give it much thought, merely nodding his head with a smile before drawing his sword and leaving the building, soaring away on the wind toward the island.

After flying for a while, he landed and entered a pavilion. An old man sat in the main seat, a wooden scroll in his hand, studying it intently.

"Greetings, Esteemed Elder!"

He bowed in the chamber. Li Xuanxuan quickly rose, a smile on his face, and took a few steps to help him up. "I've told you… you don't need to be so polite in the future. Just walk in. Look at your fifth uncle, he just waltzes in laughing, with so few formalities."

Li Jiangchun stood up with a smile and tilted his head. Sure enough, he saw Li Zhouming in a red robe standing to the side, a pot in his hand as if he had just finished refilling the old man's tea. He smiled and lowered his gaze, but his eyes lingered on the book scroll on the old man's desk, and he frowned slightly.

Li Jiangchun helped the elder back to his seat and said respectfully, "I’ve met a few of the younger clansmen."

"Oh?" Li Xuanxuan raised his eyebrows and stroked his beard, listening to the young man.

"Suihuan is fervent, Suikuan is mature, and as for Suining… having lost his father at a young age, he seems to have many thoughts on his mind. He has a mind of his own… at fifteen and at the fourth level of Embyronic Breathing, he’s not bad…"

He did not mention Li Suining’s request, nor his filial piety, only using the phrase ‘many thoughts on his mind’.

Li Xuanxuan looked thoughtful, but the wastrel above him laughed. "Not bad… he’s much better than me, just not as good as you."

Li Jiangchun and Li Suining were of similar age, but Li Jiangchun’s spiritual aperture had manifested later. He only began cultivating at seven and reached the fourth level of Embyronic Breathing at nine. After taking some spiritual and Talisman Pills, he was already at the Qi Refining stage at ten, cultivating the Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity.

In the same year, he gained sword aura, which once shocked the Daoist Master. Li Ximing was overjoyed, teaching him the clan's Celestial Moon Sword Codex, and he focused on the Way of the Sword. His cultivation progress was also swift, already at the fifth level of Qi Refining, so he slowed his cultivation to begin studying the Lesser Yin Mysterious Monarch's Water-Fire Record.

It was for this reason that Li Xuanxuan held a sort of regretful fondness for him. Li Jiangchun spent more time practicing the sword and less time cultivating, so the elder often went to watch him, standing in the courtyard for an hour or two, just silently observing.

Hearing his words, Li Xuanxuan considered for a moment, then changed the subject, becoming serious. "Did he… feel that the family has mistreated him?"

This was a highly sensitive question. Li Suining’s elder was incapable, and his father had died for the clan. Although the island had offered a great deal of compensation and secretly taken care of him, children often had extreme mindsets, and it was hard to know what they truly thought. The elder, ever thoughtful,’s first reaction was to ask this.

Li Jiangchun, however, shook his head resolutely. "He has his own thoughts… My All-Fragrance Sinks has not yet reached completion, and my grand ambitions have not yet been realized, but I still have a sense of intuition. He is likely a person with a firm will and a clear understanding of things."

"That’s good!" Li Xuanxuan smiled with relief. "There were too many juniors around at the time, and I didn't get to talk to him for very long. I must find a day to test him!"

Li Jiangchun recounted the conversations with the young clansmen. Li Xuanxuan nodded as he listened, all the while keeping an eye on the bright moon outside the pavilion. He said, with a serious tone, "The crescent moon has risen. A cold and clear moonlit night like this is not to be missed."

The Wu-Gui Scroll for Seeking Yin Divinity was best cultivated on a cold, clear night under the moonlight. Li Jiangchun understood and took his leave. But as soon as he exited the pavilion, he saw a figure in a red robe follow him out.

His fifth uncle’s movements were carefree and dashing. After reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, he had become even more at ease. As he walked alongside him, he looked at him with a smile. "Jiangchun… do you like listening to music?"

Li Jiangchun looked slightly helpless. "The Way of the Sword is crucial, and the spell arts are complex. I’ve never had the chance to listen to music."

With his successful breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm, Li Zhouming’s face shone with a newfound luster. Although he used less cosmetics, his wastrel demeanor remained. He opened his fan, speaking nonchalantly, and stopped. "There's a tune, 'Lament for the Fleeting River', that’s very interesting. You should listen to it sometime."

Li Jiangchun raised his eyebrows, looking thoughtful as he bid farewell and left.

The wastrel, famous throughout the island, was left standing in the pavilion. He raised his fan, gazing at the moonlight on his red robe. The smile on his face slowly faded, and his eyes filled with contemplation.

‘This isn't the first time… Every time I come to the pavilion, the Esteemed Elder’s desk has this musical score. He reads it over and over, until the characters are smudged…’

‘Even the other night when I was out for a late-night stroll, I passed by here and the elder was still sitting at his desk, head bowed over a lamp, reading it repeatedly, sighing long and hard…’

‘"Lament for the Fleeting River"…’

His gaze drifted. He stood in the moonlight and closed his fan, muttering with a sense of foreboding, "Where have the days of old… gone… leaving only my spirit cold."

Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple.

Golden Buddhas rose like mountains, and divine radiance fell like rain. Where the light shone, Primordial Magnetism was pervasive. The Dharma Hall glowed brightly, a hundred monks descended from the building, and the colored ponds rippled. Sacred vessels held floral water, a picture of a tranquil sanctuary.

The white steps were smooth, one after the other. A monk in gray robes sat on a step, his expression distant. A young monk holding an alms bowl stood to the side, looking as if he wanted to speak but hesitated.

"Maha…"

But the gray-robed monk stood up, his voice filled with hope. "Luejin, is there any news from Xuanmiao Temple?"

The young monk shook his head hesitantly, causing the monk to sigh. "Lord Qi will not see me… more lives are about to be lost."

He dusted his sleeves and rose, slightly startled. He looked down the mountain and saw a monk standing on the steps, climbing leisurely one step at a time.

The man was tall, with very narrow eyes and a vibrant, spirited demeanor. His eyes were a pale red, and he wore a blue silk sash around his waist, giving him a powerful presence. He came barefoot, his hands clasped together, and smiled.

"Fellow Daoist Fachang!"

Upon seeing him, Fachang’s brows furrowed, and he sighed. "So it is Fellow Daoist 'Sparrow Carp Fish'… You’ve come… As I knew you would."

The pale red pupils of 'Sparrow Carp Fish' stared at him, as if a gray mist was welling up, causing Luejin to take a step back. This Maha spoke unhurriedly.

"You should have known. My Way of Great Desire had a million followers slaughtered in Jiangbei—with such a great karma, how could I not come?"

Fachang’s gaze was complicated. He invited him into the hall and raised his eyebrows. "And so… Lord Sparrow… how many lives will you now take?"

'Sparrow Carp Fish' laughed. With his pointed chin and pale skin, he was a handsome monk. The laugh only added to his elegance. He tilted his eyes and replied, "My Great Desire Liangli method is for eliminating demons and protecting the Dao, to create a world of infinite delight for all, so that everyone can cross the Sea of Desire and ascend the empty mountain—'take lives'? What kind of talk is that!"

"You've slandered my Way of Great Desire more than once. If it weren't for the sake of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm, I would make you vanish, body and soul."

His tone was calm, yet filled with killing intent. Fachang acted as if he hadn't heard, clasping his hands and sighing. "I have no other intention. I only hope that in using your methods, fellow Daoist, you can spare the innocent."

"Innocent…"

'Sparrow Carp Fish' sneered. "You are truly ignorant. You only occupy a position. How many innocents have you saved? You want to save the innocent, but my Way of Great Desire had a million followers… were you able to save them? You only bear karma in vain!"

"This is an era of change. You pledge allegiance to a certain faction and you do its bidding. How many people are truly innocent? Are the selfishness and secrecy of the southern noble families, who drive the common people like cattle and sheep, innocent? Or are these common people who have lived lives of killing, internal conflict, and disrespect for our teachings, innocent?"

He laughed. "If there truly are any innocent people who have been so poor and downtrodden until now, the light of our teachings will shine upon them, and they will feel a response, and we will take them into our Way."

"In short… Fellow Daoist, your teachings are simply at odds with ours. You should just go back to your White Horse Monastery."

Fachang remained silent for a long time. He then saw a person following ‘Sparrow Carp Fish’ up the steps. The person was unremarkable in appearance, seemingly a practitioner of the Arhat path, with a bare torso and a poisonous dragon coiled around his body, faintly revealing his strong muscles.

'Sparrow Carp Fish' raised his eyebrows, glanced at the newcomer, and said casually, "Antelope Trample, this is Maha Fachang, a high-level cultivator of the White Horse Monastery."

Fachang’s gaze moved up and down, filled with pity. He clasped his hands and replied, "Congratulations, fellow Daoist, on taking a great disciple."

With that, he turned and silently descended the stairs, leaving the spacious hall and its new master. Antelope Trample bowed in the hall, noticing that ‘Sparrow Carp Fish’ didn’t look pleased.

The Maha spoke coldly. "The people of the Great Adoration Dharma Realm are always like this. If he dared to stand apart from the Seven Dao and follow the ways of the ancient cultivators, I would respect him. But mediating from the middle is ineffective; he just wastes time on the riverbank. If those above had truly ordered him to go south, would he have obeyed or not? If it weren’t for Qi Lanyan’s connections with him, who transferred him away in time… he would still have to endure this suffering!"

Antelope Trample lowered his head, listening to 'Sparrow Carp Fish' pace and sneer. "After what the Undefeated King of Brightness did, he now feels pity for you. What a joke."

Antelope Trample nodded and said respectfully, "Master, as for the move south…"

"You don't need to get involved in that for now."

'Sparrow Carp Fish's' pale red eyes narrowed. He replied, "Li Zhouwei took that painting back then, and he also has a great deal of karma. The benefits you've gained from the million lives haven't been fully digested… We can't afford to lose you easily. Just wait for me in Great Origin Light-Hiding Temple."

Antelope Trample lowered his head in assent. The Maha had already vanished, leaving him kneeling on the ground, bowing to the various golden Buddhas in the hall. Faint sounds still echoed in his ears.

"Wonderful, so wonderful…"

"Enlightened, fully enlightened!"
