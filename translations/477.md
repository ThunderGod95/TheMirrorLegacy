# Chapter 698: Cloud Smoke

Scarlet Pristine Sea, Zongquan Island.

The clouds over Zongquan Island drifted, the air was damp, and a towering bronze ritual altar stood tall, its intricate carvings depicted various patterns of rain, mist, and thunder. The hues of greenstone and bronze complemented each other.

Li Qinghong had cultivated here for over a decade. Since travel was inconvenient, she had Zong Yan construct another ritual altar on the island, at least granting some benefits to the island’s inhabitants.

She slowly rose as thunder flowed over her jade armor. Around her, a circle of bronze and silver statues flickered with lightning. The lightning surged toward her and cascaded down from the jade sleeves at her wrists.

Li Qinghong had been in seclusion here, cultivating for over a decade. Her strength had steadily grown, and her aura had become increasingly refined.

Falling Water Rising Storm was naturally abundant in thunder, and with the ritual altar’s support, Li Qinghong frequently sought out lightning to resonate with the thunder pool within her. These ten years of cultivation had been twice as effective, equaling over thirty years of inland practice, leaving her just one step away from the late Foundation Establishment Realm.

With her mana withdrawn, she stepped out on thunder. Below the altar stood a young man, appearing in his twenties. He was also a cultivator of thunder techniques. Holding a spear, he stood silently. Seeing Li Qinghong descend on lightning, he bowed and said, “Greetings, grandaunt.”

“Chenghui.” Li Qinghong nodded slightly. This junior, too, was a child of the second lineage, practicing thunder techniques. He had remained by her side, guarding the overseas island while using the altar to aid his cultivation.

Li Chenghui was reserved and spoke little. He cupped his hands in salute and said, “Congratulations, grandaunt, on your great advancement in cultivation.”

That was all he said. Li Qinghong nodded slightly, gave him a few pointers on cultivation, and then soared into the wind, flying off the island.

By my calculations, that spiritual thunder should be descending soon, thought Li Qinghong.

Using this altar, Li Qinghong had collected spirit thunder many times before. Although she couldn’t identify the specific locations or names of the seas, she could still venture out occasionally, sometimes returning with gains.

Li Qinghong soared with the wind, stepping on lightning as she flew northward. At her waist, a lightning-patterned black bottle gleamed brilliantly, it was exceptionally dazzling.

The black-patterned bottle contained eleven bolts of lightning yet remained stable and sturdy. Its exterior, resembling lightning cracks, shone even brighter. Inside, the translucent lightning pulsed with a soft purple glow. It was truly astonishing.

Over the years, she had gained a deeper understanding of the altar. The twelve surrounding statues each represented a region, suggesting that ancient thunder domains had been pre-designated. Whichever direction the lightning fell from determined its ownership.

The dragon-shaped statue in the southeast was the most active, providing the most information. Over the years, most of the thunder she obtained came from the southeast.

She flew through the sky for a while and was about to turn southeast when she suddenly looked back. Above Zongquan Island, a brilliant light rose and the jade talisman on her wrist emitted a warm glow.

Whenever Li Qinghong left Zongquan Island, she left behind a jade talisman as a precaution in case anything happened in her absence. However, her mana did not last long and she had never specialized in this art, so the talisman was only effective for a month or two.

What’s this...? Luckily, I haven’t gone far.

Li Qinghong turned back on lightning, swiftly returning to the island. She saw that Li Chenghui was already waiting at the formation’s entrance. Passing Zong Yan and the others, he stepped forward, bowed, and used secret techniques to transmit a message, Grandaunt, Third Uncle has entered the formation and he is gravely injured.

Xizhi!

Li Qinghong’s heart skipped a beat. Without a word, she soared into the wind and rushed into the great formation. Zong Yan and the others barely had time to react before she vanished like a bolt of lightning.

Inside the cave dwelling, Li Qinghong saw Li Xizhi sitting cross-legged, his face ashen, multicolored light flowing around him as he worked to heal his injuries. She hurriedly activated the formation, shattered a few spirit stones and stepped out of the formation.

Li Chenghui waited outside and whispered, “Grandaunt... Third uncle concealed his presence, used a jade pendant to summon me outside and then sneaked into the formation. No one else on the island knows.”

Hearing this, Li Qinghong pondered the implications, her expression darkening as she spoke in a low voice, “Something must have happened. Keep this a secret. Do not let anyone know that Zhi’er is here.”

Li Chenghui nodded and quietly withdrew. Once he disappeared, Li Qinghong shook her head slightly, lost in silent thought.

———

Mount Azure Pond.

The bells of Mount Azure Pond rang three times as the Dawn Cloudliner streaked across the sky in dazzling colors. Their massive, multicolored wings fluttered as they returned from all directions.

With the fall of the Purple Mansion Realm master, cultivators stationed across various regions were summoned back. Some who had long been absent from the sect also made an appearance, returning from the Eastern Sea, the southern border and even the Northern Sea.

“Yuanwu has fallen...”

Li Xuanfeng halted midair, circling twice through the white mist before landing atop the peak. The Ning Family members stood in orderly formation. As he looked around, he saw that the surrounding mountains remained lush and green, unlike the rumored golden landscape.

When news first spread, it was said that enough gold had fallen within the peak to bury several people. Now that Yuanwu had perished, the vast amounts of gold scattered across the mountains had already been gathered and stored within the sect.

Upon hearing this, Ning Heyuan laughed heartily and even joked that for the next hundred years, Yuanwu Peak would no longer need to request gold from the sect. It could rely solely on Yuanwu’s remains.

Listening to the Ning Family’s laughter, Li Xuanfeng remained deep in thought, The time to act on the lake has come... but I don’t know how things are on Xizhi’s side.

He waited for a moment before the Ning Family members dispersed into the peak. This was Dongquan Peak, one of the thirty-six great peaks. However, since Yuan Su never managed it and the talented members of the Ning Family had all gone to the southern border, its reputation remained obscure.

When Li Xuanfeng entered the grand hall, he saw Yuan Su seated at the head, alone. Clearly, no one dared to loiter in his presence. Clad in golden armor, Li Xuanfeng knelt before him and said, “Greetings, Master.”

Yuan Su’s expression was unreadable. He glanced down at Li Xuanfeng and spoke in a low voice, “Yuanwu has been utterly eradicated. Come with me to meet the Chi Family.”

Li Xuanfeng felt a flicker of suspicion but said nothing. He nodded, rose to his feet and followed Yuan Su out of the hall. At the entrance stood a tall middle-aged man named Ning Hejing.

Ning Hejing was the elder cousin of Ning Heyuan and Ning Hemian, one of the few Ning Family cultivators still residing in the sect. He was the peak master of Yuanxing Peak and had close ties with Chi Zhiyun.

Chi Buzi was Chi Zhiyun’s great-grandfather and Chi Zhiyun’s lineage was maternally tied to Ning Hejing’s branch. The two had grown up together and their interests were closely intertwined which made them as good as blood brothers.

Ning Hejing cupped his hands and said to Yuan Su, “Master, please proceed to the main hall.”

Yuan Su gave a slight nod and ascended into the wind. Ning Hejing merely nodded at Ning Heyuan and the others without so much as a smile. He maintained a careful distance as he led Yuan Su and a few Ning Family elites into the air.

Ning Heyuan’s expression darkened briefly before returning to normal. Behind him, several younger members of the Ning Family also looked displeased, clearly dissatisfied with Ning Hejing’s actions.

Ning Hejing ignored their reactions, showing only a hint of cordiality toward Li Xuanfeng. Li Xuanfeng nodded in return and together they descended into the Azure Pond Main Hall.

Mist billowed within the hall, clear energy drifting in wisps. In the center stood a large golden bell, it was undoubtedly the one that had just rung. Beside this golden dharma artifact stood a middle-aged man, who appeared to be from the Chi Family.

At the highest seat stood a man clad in a brilliant robe with a sword at his waist. It was most likely Chi Zhiyun, the sect master of Azure Pond. Given the striking resemblance between him and the man below, that person was likely his younger brother, Chi Zhiyan.

It was Li Xuanfeng’s first time seeing Chi Zhiyun, yet he found him familiar. Narrowing his eyes slightly, a thought stirred in his mind.

When all was said and done, the fame of their sword immortal was owed to this man. Back when Chi Zhiyun was still the sect’s young master, he had been overseeing Li Chejing’s journey to the southern border. By now, seventy to eighty years had passed.

Chi Zhiyun was now at the late Foundation Establishment Realm. No one knew how many secret techniques he had mastered, but his spiritual qi radiated warmth and grandeur. He had likely consumed many treasured panaceas. Standing at the top, he exuded a commanding presence.

“Greetings, Sect Master!” The gathered cultivators saluted, but Chi Zhiyun was focused on first bowing to Yuan Su, respectfully saying, “Greetings, Daoist Master Yuan Su.”

Yuan Su waved his hand dismissively, merely lowering his head slightly toward the central memorial plaque. He was acknowledging Yuanwu’s passing. The Ning Family members then stepped forward to pay their respects one by one. Chi Zhiyun watched coldly. When the formalities were complete, he glanced meaningfully at Ning Hejing.

Ning Hejing turned to Ning Heyuan and said in a low voice, “You all may leave.”

Ning Heyuan’s eyelid twitched at the command. He turned to gauge Yuan Su’s expression, but seeing the Daoist Master remain indifferent, he had no choice but to silently lead his people out.

Though brief, the exchange told Li Xuanfeng everything he needed to know. Once everyone had left, Yuan Su finally spoke, “Where is Senior Suiguan?”

At the mention of this name, Chi Zhiyun’s hand tensed slightly on the hilt of his sword. A faint smile appeared on his face as he responded in a soft voice, “The honored master is elusive as a dragon, roaming the great void, traveling between the mainland and the seas. We juniors, naturally, do not know his whereabouts.”

Even as he spoke, the jade talisman at his waist swayed slightly. Li Xuanfeng’s pupils contracted ever so slightly as he lowered his gaze in silence.

That jade talisman, there was no mistaking it. It was the very same one he had used overseas to reap countless lives, tying dozens of storage pouches to it. And now, it hung from Chi Zhiyun’s waist.

Is this a warning… or a hint? thought Li Xuanfeng.

He scrutinized Chi Zhiyun, only to find that the young sect master of Azure Pond was silently observing him as well.

The nephew of Li Chejing, thought Chi Zhiyun. Of course, he remembered that boy from back then. Eighty years had passed in a blink, yet he had never forgotten that one sword strike. Every time he practiced with his blade, the image of a crisp breeze and bright moon would surface in his mind, making him pause and reflect in silence.

As his cultivation grew and his sword techniques and spell arts became more refined, he was no longer the Chi Zhiyun who once rushed through his training. Yet, that sword strike had been so dazzling that it left him feeling unworthy, so much so that he rarely used his sword anymore.

With an uncle like that, it’s no surprise his nephew turned out like this!

The Li Xuanfeng before him was even sharper than that boy from long ago. He was weathered, ruthless and was clad in armor reeking of blood. He was like a blade, so perfect that one would want to treasure and collect him.

Having consumed many treasured panaceas, Chi Zhiyun still looked youthful, while Li Xuanfeng bore the visage of an old warrior. As Chi Zhiyun was momentarily lost in thought, Yuan Su finally spoke, “Suiguan intends to bring you to the ceremony?”

Chi Zhiyun quickly snapped back to attention, cupped his hands, and respectfully replied, “Yes, Master!”

Yuan Su nodded slightly, casually pointing at Li Xuanfeng as he said, “My family is full of useless people. I’ll only send this junior. If you get the chance, you should exchange pointers with him.”

Ning Hejing was inexplicably insulted but dared not protest. After all, he was only at the early Foundation Establishment Realm, his innate ability inferior even to his younger brothers. Knowing Li Xuanfeng’s reputation, he endured it in silence.

Chi Zhiyun was momentarily taken aback, but he quickly recovered, a kind smile appearing on his face as he nodded and said, “As you command, Master.”

Yuan Su nodded again before departing with Li Xuanfeng, leaving the three men standing in the hall. Ning Hejing remained in the corner, silent as ever. At last, Chi Zhiyan, who had not spoken all this time, finally broke his silence. His expression was dark and sinister as he muttered, “So this is Li Xuanfeng!”

Chi Zhiyan’s features closely resembled Chi Zhiyun’s, but his expression carried a more sinister and cunning edge as he spoke coldly, “That Li Chejing must have used some underhanded trick to defeat you back then… Our family has always held a grudge against the Li Family… Many have long harbored resentment toward him! Once Yuan Su dies—”

“Zhiyan!!” Chi Zhiyun immediately cut him off with a sharp reprimand, “How dare you!”

Chi Zhiyan fell silent, while Chi Zhiyun’s expression darkened as he strode forward, his voice icy, “How many times have I told you? Li Chejing defeated me fair and square with his sword intent! There’s nothing disgraceful about it! You lot keep distorting the truth and twisting it in circles. That’s the behavior of sore losers!”

Seeing Chi Zhiyan scoff, he snapped harshly, he said, “I admitted defeat under broad daylight and never sought to harm the Li Family afterward. That’s how I salvaged my honor! Yet your family keeps scheming recklessly, meddling with the Yuan Family. That’s what’s truly putting me on the pyre!”

Chi Zhiyan, now thoroughly chastised, shut his mouth in embarrassment.

Chi Zhiyun had never been truly bothered by his defeat at Li Chejing’s hands. Even now, how many in Jiangnan could wield sword intent? A loss was a loss. He had never stooped to petty tricks to cover it up.

And yet, as his position as sect master became increasingly precarious, Chi Zhiyun found himself struggling to find capable subordinates. Instead, he began to regret, saying, “If our ancestor hadn’t plotted against Li Chejing back then… how many competent aides would I have now?! Not only was Li Chejing unparalleled in sharpness, but his intellect was also top-tier! If I had him at my side, I wouldn’t have to suffer the stupidity of this lot!

“And beyond that! There’s still Li Tongya, Li Xuanfeng, even Li Xizhi. Each one of them capable of holding their own and guarding a territory! How did I end up stuck with only these imbeciles…”

Chi Zhiyun sighed in exasperation but suddenly realized that his brother had gone completely silent. Turning back, he saw Chi Zhiyan looking dazed, and his heart clenched in alarm as he questioned, “What have you done this time?!”

Chi Zhiyan had been lost in thought ever since the mention of ‘harming the Li Family.’ Now that his brother had called him out, he was visibly uneasy and mumbled, “Nothing much…”

Chi Zhiyun scrutinized him carefully, his tone turning frigid as he asked, “Hejing… The spirit bell tolled six times. Did Li Xizhi return to the sect as ordered?”

Ning Hejing pondered for a moment before shaking his head and answered, “No, he has not.”

Chi Zhiyun’s heart sank, and in a sudden burst of fury, he shouted, “You fool! Li Xizhi was still useful to me! If you’ve harmed him, how many capable people do we have left in the sect?! You’re ruining me!”
