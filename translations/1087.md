# Chapter 1087: Taking the Pill

Their old ancestor, Daoist Master Yuanshang, had long since exhausted his natural lifespan. He had relied on the protection of a Spiritual Treasure for many years, nourishing his life-mandate with secret arts and spiritual resources. The Underworld had also been lenient with him, allowing him to cling to a thread of life until this very day…

Daoist Master Che Hong understood the profound mysteries of the situation better than anyone. They had been pushed into this corner step by step over the years, and today’s Quest for Gold was a desperate, last-ditch effort with no path of retreat.

'The Great Daoist Master spent three years adjusting his aura to its absolute peak, calming his heart and mind. If he misses this chance, he won't have another three years to seek the Dao!'

As Daoist Master Che Hong pleaded bitterly, Yuanshang's expression suddenly grew calm. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his voice distant.

"I know full well how sordid the affair with Ning-Li was. It's truly laughable. The last time the entire Supreme Yang Daoist Tradition worked together, the last time we were of one mind… was to conspire to seize a treasure from Li Jiangqun."

"It's no surprise that the Supreme Yang has lost its brilliance today!"

Li Ximing opened his mouth to speak but fell silent. Yuanshang stood lost in thought within the grotto-heaven, his voice a low murmur.

"Success was because of him, and so was failure. The Xuyu's and Tiaoxiao's Dao lineages were both destroyed, Yuanxiu went his own way, Yuanwu's ambitious Profound Pill was ruined, and Jinzhou was murdered. If not for that figure in the north intervening to protect him, there would be no True Monarch Shangyuan today…"

He paced with an unsteady gait.

"Chi Wei reaped the greatest benefits and seemed quite pleased with himself, but that wasn't the whole truth. Stripping him of over a hundred years of his lifespan while he was young and arrogant was not a futile effort. In the end, he understood it too—he could not seek the Gold."

"After thinking it over and over, I realized only one person truly escaped unscathed back then… Qiushui."

The old man’s face showed a deep weariness.

"She… because of True Monarch Taiyuan…"

At this, he seemed overwhelmed, coughing twice before letting out a cold, sharp laugh.

"But… but I don’t believe it… She was so close to Ning Tiaoxiao back then, so genuine. Such false sentiment could never have deceived him… She must have been in pain!"

His coughing grew violent, and he bent over, unable to straighten his back. Che Hong stepped forward, his heart aching as he supported the old man, only to see him smile again.

"I thought at the time that my Chunyi Dao Gate had simply abided by the rules and not participated. Now I see we were being saved for another purpose!"

As he spoke these words, the entire illusory realm began to tremble. The laurel trees standing in the courtyard shook wildly, their snow-white blossoms scattering like a blizzard, piling up and tumbling across the ground.

_RUMBLE!_

Amidst the tremors of the Great Void, Che Hong’s choked voice called out once more.

"Ancestor!"

Li Ximing also sensed that something was terribly wrong. The Great Void was shaking with the violence of a collapsing mountain. Wisps of Supreme Yin spiritual energy shot past him, and a dreadful realization struck him.

'This Great Daoist Master… is about to lose control of his cultivation!'

He immediately stepped forward and urged, "Senior!"

His single word was more effective than all of Che Hong’s pleas. Daoist Master Yuanshang whipped his head around, his eyes locking onto him.

The old man's face was covered in a dense, intricate web of fine white lines. The markings were curved like crescent moons, linked end to end, tracing a path from his eyelids down to his jaw before disappearing beneath the collar of his feathered robes. Every single line pulsed with a brilliant lunar light.

His pupils had turned a stark greyish-white, and every inch of his skin trembled. An intangible radiance, mingled with a liquid sheen, flowed from the creases of his wrinkles with a soft hiss. The fissure on his brow had deepened to the bone, as if a third eye were about to open.

A suffocating and immense pressure washed over them, unlike any power Li Ximing had ever felt. It was an aura of absolute authority, of dominion over life and death.

'This is a qualitative shift… His divine ability is about to merge with his life-mandate!'

Li Ximing had never expected this moment to arrive so suddenly. His scalp prickled. With lightning speed, he retrieved a prepared jade box from his sleeve, shattered it with a burst of his divine ability, and presented the large pill within.

"I came upon this pill in my travels, senior," he said in a low voice. "I do not know if it will be of any benefit to you!"

Those greyish-white eyes lowered, focusing on the pill nestled in his hands.

Instantly, the swirling, multicolored light filling the illusory realm froze. The dense Supreme Yin energy began to recede. Che Hong’s gaze paused, and then his eyes erupted with overwhelming joy.

"Sir! Sir, please wait!"

'This is…'

The pill was a milky white, inscribed with silver patterns of the serene Moon Laurel that shimmered with threads of silvery light. The sight made Che Hong’s pupils widen in shock.

Though he was no expert in alchemy, he understood the Supreme Yin!

'This is a great pill formed from the highest grade of Supreme Yin spiritual treasure! Its essence might even be comparable to the Xuandan Supreme Yin White Moon Laurel Branch that Chi Buzi once possessed…'

He didn't hesitate for a moment, shouting urgently, "Zhaojing, this pill is the very solution my Dao needs! Please part with it, and you will be handsomely rewarded!"

Li Ximing had created this pill by a stroke of fortune years ago. It could extend one's life-mandate, aid in secluded cultivation breakthroughs, and even generate a stream of cold moon spiritual qi in the mouth to nourish the physical body. For Yuanshang, who was on the verge of his Quest for Gold, it was perfect.

But the illusory realm remained silent. Yuanshang's body trembled violently, his face contorting. His eyes had turned a pure, solid white, and two crystalline tears could be seen trickling from their corners, striking the ground with a crisp sound.

_Clink._

"Retribution…"

The old man took a step, his gaze fixed on the pill, tears streaming down his face. His voice was a twisted, sharp roar.

"It truly is retribution…"

Li Ximing stood frozen. The old man had already lurched forward, snatched the pill into his hand, and let two tracks of pure white tears course down his cheeks.

"Hahahahaha!"

He let out a wild, mournful laugh, his voice cracking with intensity.

"I'll take it! I'll take it, then!"

His cry sent ripples of invisible light through the air. The jade table and chairs, the silvery, shimmering illusion—everything dissolved like snow on hot coals. All the phantom colors vanished, revealing the gleaming silver walls of the cave-mansion.

The formation patterns lining the cave lit up under the surging tide of his divine ability and dharma power, then exploded into a shower of light before collapsing completely, plunging the world into darkness.

In the profound blackness, a single point of radiance appeared.

_BOOM!_

Seajade Peak, the highest mountain of the Chunyi Dao Gate, began to shake violently. Rocks, palaces, and everything upon it were bathed in a dreamlike moonlight.

Heavy, dark clouds gathered in the sky, and with them came a cold, piercing laugh that echoed across the heavens.

"My apologies for keeping you all waiting!"

It was unclear to whom he spoke. The divine abilities arrayed in the Great Void remained silent and still. Only the boundless dark clouds roiled across the sky, completely obscuring the bright moon in the endless night.

"Daoist Friend Xi, you are too polite!"

The response was sharp and thin, laced with a heavy gloom that settled into the night, causing Yuanshang to turn his head slightly.

The old man’s humble demeanor was gone, replaced by a cold, severe expression as he broke into a smile.

"I'm afraid you couldn't wait!"

_BOOM!_

A low rumble of thunder finally sounded from within the roiling clouds. Snow began to fall as the two sharp voices laughed again, their presence gradually fading until they vanished completely.

Yuanshang raised his head, his luminous white eyes piercing through the Great Void, seeing every figure with perfect clarity. Tears still streamed down his cheeks as he took a step forward. With a movement of his throat, he finally swallowed the pill and began to murmur an incantation.

'Supreme Yin pill-scape, prostrate before the sky's warming purity; grand radiance dawns, illuminating the nine radiances of the earth; witness the descent of the high true, refine the void's three energies, ascend the crimson clouds, and drift through the five phases…'

The dark clouds in the sky suddenly thinned, revealing a bright, clear moon. It waxed and waned in an unfixed, hazy dance, and the countless stars around it twinkled, casting down their brilliant light in unison.

The Waxing and Waning Moon!

In an instant, every divine ability in the Great Void focused its attention, unmoving. A single thought arose in everyone's mind:

'He has begun his Quest for Gold!'

Beneath his feet, vast palaces materialized layer by layer, followed by moon-white bridges and long hills of pale jade. They flashed past, revealing a jade gate the color of the moon, above which hung three large characters:

Morning Jade Palace.

A stir went through the heavens. The two faint figures began to whisper to each other.

"That's not the right path."

"No, this is The Waxing and Waning Moon. If he had cultivated the Supreme Yin Moon Radiance, it should be Attaining the Grand Prime!"

The moonlight was enchanting, and the fine snow drifted on the wind. The faint sound of rustling could be heard, along with the deep, resonant croak of a toad as the phantom colors swirled back.

Startled Magpie's Domain!

In the sky, Yuanshang took another step, and magpie feathers mingled with the falling snow. Li Ximing was already standing in the Great Void, shielding his two juniors, watching the scene unfold with a distant look.

He was distracted, barely even in the mood to respond when Daoist Master Tianhuo appeared at his side. He merely gave a slight nod, his heart heavy.

'Retribution… what kind of retribution?'

_DONG!_

The world filled with a blinding radiance. Daoist Master Yuanshang stood with his hands behind his back as his Dharma Body began to crumble like an avalanche. Streaks and slivers of silver-white light broke away, coalescing in the sky to form a tiny, bright moon.

Conferring the Profound Pearl.

This moon was nothing like the magnificent White Jade Plate True Monarch Shangyuan had once manifested, which had filled the entire sky. This one was no larger than a thumb, a pure white bead like an alchemical pill. He held it in both hands as if cradling a Dao-fruit woven from infinite light, dazzling to behold.

As this divine ability emerged, Li Ximing blinked slowly, remaining silent.

But from a dark place, within the grey mists, the sharp, thin voice in the sky laughed.

"Wrong… all wrong… these are all inferior…"

"Where would he get Supreme Yin Moon Radiance to cultivate a superior grade!"

But as the divine abilities converged and the moonlight brightened, a towering sheet of talismanic light suddenly erupted, stretching across the sky like a profound curtain of heaven and earth. It descended, illuminating the eight directions with its magnificent, flashing light.

The Woven Jade Radiance Chapter!

This divine ability was endlessly mysterious, its dense and intricate runes concealed within the radiance, seeming to hold the very truths of the Great Dao. The sight made everyone turn to stare, mesmerized and horrified.

"What a divine ability! This must be the fundamental art of the Chunyi Dao Gate!"

Even the two sharp voices on the sides paused, their gazes fixed for a long moment.

"The Woven Jade Radiance Chapter… now this is a genuine ability!"

The two spoke without restraint, causing Li Ximing to narrow his eyes and watch intently, silent for a long time. A sudden sense of familiarity rose within him…

'It has some of the same profound feeling as the patterns of the High Firmament Pavilion…'

He stared blankly, listening to Daoist Master Tianhuo's praise from beside him.

"A genuine ability? This is far more. This is a Great Dao bestowed personally by the Azure Profoundity Daoist Tradition. Of the many immortal-grade fundamental arts of the ancient Immortal Dao, the Moon-Ascension art was the predecessor to The Woven Jade Radiance Chapter…"

"Back then, the Three Yin, Cold Qi, and Water Mansion paths all had figures who achieved the Dao with this fundamental art… It's no wonder he chose to cultivate this path!"

He was of noble birth, and out of respect for the True Monarch, few dared to make things difficult for him. The two figures from the Underworld turned their heads and praised him.

"The young lord has excellent insight!"

_DONG!_

As heaven and earth trembled, all the phantom colors had condensed into a single point.

An Unbearable Chill!

The entire sky was instantly enveloped in a multicolored haze. Vague shapes of laurel trees could be seen, seeming both as distant as the horizon and as close as one's own eyes. The white pill formed by Conferring the Profound Pearl truly resembled a pill of the Great Dao, appearing exceptionally bright against the backdrop of all the other colors. Sweet dew began to manifest in the sky, all of it converging toward that single point.

There was no fire or water, no void or reality, no purity or turbidity—only an endless process of condensation and elevation, a constant resonance with the Great Void as if answering a call.

Li Ximing's expression slowly changed, his gaze sweeping rapidly across the faces of the crowd.

The envoys from the Underworld, who had been so loudly critical, were now silent. Daoist Master Tianhuo, who had been all smiles, now had his head bowed, looking extremely constrained. Qing Zhuo, the cultivator from Mount Changhuai who stood apart from the crowd, had his eyes shut tight, not uttering a word.

These figures with celestial backgrounds were each more silent than the last, their silence bordering on tension.

In contrast, the many rogue cultivators without backing, along with invited clan cultivators like Chen Yin and Lingu Lanying, were whispering amongst themselves, mostly looking confused and frowning deeply.

'What… what's happening?'

Everything in the sky froze for an instant. A crisp sound seemed to ring out, and Li Ximing clearly felt Daoist Master Tianhuo beside him let out a sigh of immense relief.

It was followed by a deeply suppressed, agonizing sob—coming from Daoist Master Yuanshang himself.

The sounds from his mouth grew more trembling and faint, soon lost in the chattering of his teeth. Yuanshang began to laugh.

"Hahahahaha!"

The old man's laughter grew more and more frantic. He snatched the shimmering Dao-fruit pill, now condensed to its absolute limit, and shrieked with a laugh.

"I'll take it! I'll take it, then!"

_CLANG!_

Tier upon tier of ghostly pavilions had already materialized within the black clouds, yet they could not block the intense, cold light that shone forth. Even under the suppression of a Dharma Treasure, the old man continued to let out peal after peal of crazed laughter. His eyes traversed the sky, pierced the Great Void, and locked directly onto Li Ximing.

'He's become a demonic being!'

A jolt of horror shot through Li Ximing. He sealed the six senses of his two juniors and fled without hesitation.

"Master!"

Fuxuan's desolate cry echoed through the night sky, but before it could fade, the terrifying sounds of a battle already resounded over the entire island.

_BOOM!_

A waterfall of laurel blossoms rained down, blanketing a thousand miles of the sea, dying the entire surface a pure white. Countless cultivators were submerged in the floral downpour, staring up in a daze.

'A divine ability has fallen!'
