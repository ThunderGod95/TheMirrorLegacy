# Chapter 910: Scars

He activated his divine ability, his form instantly dissolving into a churning cloud of black maleficence. He twisted and danced within the roiling Baleful Qi and its dark light, rising to meet the cascade of brilliant attacks descending upon him.

Five types of Radiant Fire mingled with the abyssal flames erupting from the White Yin Fan. They scattered and drifted down, colliding with the roiling Baleful Qi. A violent flare of red and black light erupted. As the two fires separated, a great mountain of white jade, descending from the heavens, was revealed.

*Clang!*

Helian Wumeng gently raised the butt of his long-handled glaive to his chest, stopping the white jade mountain in its tracks. A moment later, a second hand shot out from the Baleful Qi, clamping down on a pitch-black halberd that had thrust coldly out from the flames.

*Boom!*

A shower of sparks exploded at the contact. His five fingers splayed wide, locking onto the halberd’s shaft with a death grip. Where hand met weapon, thick black smoke billowed amidst the sparks, accompanied by a grating, teeth-cringing screech.

Li Zhouwei's Cyclic Soul-Refining Halberd Arts was undeniably potent, but the weapon in his hand was, unfortunately, a mere dharma artifact—an ancient one, but a dharma artifact nonetheless. Against a Purple Mansion Realm master, it was hopelessly outmatched. His five Radiant Fire types mixed with the abyssal flame could at least singe his opponent's body. However, the famed "Jade Smoke Mountain," which the Yu family had once used to dominate the lake region, was so weak it could be deflected by the mere flick of the man's Spiritual Artifact. Without the enhancement from the divine ability, Li Zhouwei's attacks wouldn't even graze his foe's shadow.

Only the halberd formed of surging black flames, which had pierced the Baleful Qi, forced Helian Wumeng to catch it bare-handed. The acrid black smoke pouring from his seared palm proved it was the only Dharma Art capable of inflicting any real damage.

High above, the Audience with the Celestial Gate had arrived!

Helian Wumeng had been waiting for this. He had allowed his smoke-like form to absorb so many attacks precisely to free his hands for this very moment. He brought one hand before his chest, two fingers held vertically. Instantly, the eighteen azureglass beads at his waist vanished.

*Vmmm!*

The azureglass beads resonated, unleashing a blinding, boundless light of the Supreme Yin. They formed a massive white jade disk in the sky that firmly caught the descending Audience with the Celestial Gate divine ability. The collision of Supreme Yin and Bright Yang was like a boiling cauldron, erupting in violent waves of light.

These eighteen beads were the "Azureglass Stars of the Western General," one of Helian Wumeng's most treasured trump cards. He had held it in reserve exactly for this!

It wasn't that he feared this divine ability, but the location was all wrong. Had they been at sea or in the northern lands, he would have eagerly tested its might. But while the thrill of the fight excited him, he hadn't lost his mind. Deep in enemy territory, how could he allow himself to be suppressed by such a powerful ability?

But just as he deployed his treasure, the battlefield shifted. The four arms that had sprouted from his opponent's back were merely a distraction. The golden-eyed youth's true body had already retracted his hand, seizing his halberd, the 'Grand Ascension', as his eyes blazed with golden light. His other hand plunged straight into the cloud of Baleful Qi—and, impossibly, closed around Helian Wumeng's throat!

'What?'

Helian Wumeng cultivated the Baleful Qi Body Divine Ability. He could disperse and reform at will. Unless his opponent possessed a Life Divine Ability, it should be impossible to locate his true body within the Baleful Qi. He should have to be forced out with spell arts, not plucked from the miasma like this!

Yet here he was, grasped by the throat. No time for shock. He frantically poured his divine ability into his eyes, heedless of the cost. The light of the eighteen azureglass beads in the sky dimmed as his pupils flooded with crimson. Surging demonic qi erupted, threatening to blast his opponent away with a wave of demonic light.

The youth’s golden eyes burned. The Celestial Gate above vanished, and a new light flared from between his brows.

*RUMBLE!*

The blood-red demonic light and the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light clashed, becoming tangible pillars of energy. In that instant, crimson light flooded the sky, spreading from Helian Wumeng. Though the two beams were of similar size, his opponent's spell arts were more profound, and the dharma power he channeled was utterly reckless. The golden-eyed youth's attack was actually a fraction stronger!

But then, a faint golden thread emerged from within Li Zhouwei's Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light—the power of the Supreme Yang, supplied by the Concealed Plunder Gold!

This pure thread of Supreme Yang power flowed against the demonic tide. It seemed to extract something vital, causing the crimson beam to become an empty illusion, a castle in the air, and suddenly decay.

Simultaneously, the golden-eyed youth lunged forward. His face magnified in Helian Wumeng's vision. A thunderous *crack*! The instant the demonic light broke, a fist connected with the silver-black-armored man’s head, exploding in a dark cloud.

"Ngh...!"

Two streams of bloody tears instantly tracked down Helian Wumeng's cheeks. The Baleful Qi filling the sky seemed to pop and crackle. His form vanished in a red flash, the crimson aura in the sky disappearing with him. He reappeared dozens of yards away, trailing black smoke as he came to a halt.

Li Zhouwei casually flicked his hand. The demonic blood on his knuckles instantly vaporized into a storm of Baleful Qi that drifted away. Clearly, Helian Wumeng's escape technique had come at a price.

The northern barbarian's eyes were clenched shut, his face a mask of agony as bloody tears streamed from the corners. He raised a hand, formed two fingers like a blade, and jabbed them viciously into the flesh just beneath his own eyes.

Two round holes appeared on Helian Wumeng's cheeks. The flesh rippled, and from beneath his still-closed eyelids, two new, blood-red eyes emerged. A dazzling crimson light burst from them once more, freezing the white beam that was streaking toward him!

The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light drew most of its power from the Supreme Yang energy released by the Concealed Plunder Gold, but that energy was not infinite. Having just invaded its target's eyes, the white light weakened. The red light overpowered it, and the menacing demonic beam struck the golden-eyed youth’s forehead.

*BOOM!*

Helian Wumeng showed no sign of relief. His expression remained utterly calm as he simultaneously flicked his glaive upward, parrying a halberd that had struck like a cold, venomous snake. *Clang!*

Even in his haste, his block was firm. But his opponent hadn't even tried to defend against the demonic light. Instead, he twisted the halberd. Its smaller, crescent blade, glowing with multicolored light, danced across Helian Wumeng's face. It sliced open a terrifying wound that nearly sheared off the side of his cheek, momentarily revealing the white gleam of teeth.

Helian Wumeng’s expression remained glacial.

Thousand-Hundred Body!

His Body Divine Ability flared. The gruesome wound, which had just split his face open, shrank rapidly, knitting back together. It didn't even bother to purge the destructive Bright Yang power or the black flame lingering in the cut. Instead, with supreme skill, it constrained and condensed them into a single, fine, golden-white scar.

He still hadn't had time to deal with the Supreme Yang light in his eyes. With a quick dodge, he dissolved back into Baleful Qi, reforming a short distance away, looking slightly disheveled.

It was all to evade the Audience with the Celestial Gate, which had reappeared and locked onto his position.

On the other side, Li Zhouwei staggered. The demonic light on his forehead exploded, momentarily revealing a sinister speck of bone flashing with multicolored light. But a gush of golden-white blood instantly neutralized the demonic qi. New flesh knitted over the wound, and in a heartbeat, his skin was smooth and unbroken.

The demonic light had bought Helian Wumeng another precious moment. The "Azureglass Stars of the Western General" flared to life, seizing the opportunity to bear down on the young man.

How could Li Zhouwei not see the danger? The Great Void trembled and the Bright Yang surged. The Audience with theCelestial Gate abandoned its target, rising from below to meet the azureglass beads. A massive plume of white smoke billowed from their collision.

*Hisss...*

Now separated by a great distance, both men finally paused.

*Vmmm...*

Li Zhouwei leveled his halberd. The 'Grand Ascension' hummed, letting out a mournful keen. Even sheathed in surging black flames to prevent direct contact with the enemy's Spiritual Artifact, the dharma artifact was clearly reaching its limit.

Helian Wumeng's bloody tears had yet to stop. He coughed, and two jets of golden light shot from his clenched eyelids. He finally opened them, revealing only empty, scorched-black sockets. But then, the two gruesome eyes on his cheeks crawled upward, sliding into the empty orbits. His handsome features were restored, and from a distance, he looked completely unharmed.

The thrilling, high-paced battle paused. Both men appeared strangely unaffected, save for the faint, fine scar on Helian Wumeng’s face, from which the golden-white light was rapidly fading.

The very sky seemed to have been split by them into north and south. On one side, Baleful Qi rolled in boundless darkness; on the other, bright light gleamed and colorful clouds drifted. For a moment, neither spoke.

The fight hadn't ended. A hazy golden light was sweeping in from the northwest. One by one, massive golden figures materialized behind Helian Wumeng. Their gazes were a mixture of greed and apprehension. They stood with hands clasped and heads bowed, utterly silent.

Four of the Merciful Ones had arrived.

Li Zhouwei stood with his back to the great river, his brilliant Heavenly Light holding its ground against the demonic Buddhists. Neither side made a move.

Then, one Merciful One laughed loudly. He glanced at Li Zhouwei, clasped his hands, and said in a low voice, "The north is victorious, but the vanguard has not yet been broken. This place is not safe. We were ordered to rendezvous with you, Daoist Friend, and escort you back to Xiaoshi Mountain..."

Helian Wumeng didn't even turn his head. His face was full of surprise, and he still looked eager for more. He stared at Li Zhouwei until a deep, resonant voice echoed from the sky:

"A fine dharma body."

It was Li Zhouwei who had spoken. Helian Wumeng continued to stare at him in surprise. He pointed his glaive downward, planting it in the clouds, and raised a finger to his face. He gently brushed the fine, golden-white scar. The color transferred entirely to his fingertip, which he held up to examine closely.

"Good!"

A look of genuine delight surfaced in his eyes.

"This one battle with Minghuang is worth more than three years of my bitter cultivation!"

Even as enemies, the northern barbarian's grand bearing was undiminished. Though the color had faded from the wound and the divine ability within it was neutralized, the mark itself remained, adding a touch of savagery to his features.

"I will remember this halberd strike."

The two factions faced each other across the sky, their spiritual senses locked, monitoring every movement. After a few breaths, two figures flew in frantically from the south.

They were, of course, the demonic cultivators who had crossed the river. The exchange between Li Zhouwei and Helian Wumeng had been blindingly fast. Their group had fled in terror, and only these two had made it. The youth in black robes was flickering with dark light, clearly protected by a Purple Mansion Realm talisman that both defended and intimidated. Without it, their escape would not have been so easy.

The other survivor was covered in burning Radiant Fire and bright light. His entire lower body was gone, and his remaining torso was smoldering, trailing black smoke. It was clear that in just that short time, of all the cultivators who had crossed the river, only these two remained.

Over the river, Li Zhouwei gave them a cool glance. Helian Wumeng merely tightened his grip on his glaive, a knowing smile in his eyes.

Since the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition had been defeated, they were likely in full retreat. Their foundation was deep, so no one would press them to annihilation. But Helian Wumeng's group was too deep in enemy territory, and the northern powers were not unified. They feared being encircled, which is why they had to withdraw. And they had to take these survivors with them.

If fighting resumed, Helian Wumeng was more than capable of tying down Li Zhouwei. It was hard to say what the other Merciful Ones might do in the meantime.

But Li Zhouwei merely swept his gaze over them, tightened his grip on his halberd, and said coldly, "You can go. But leave what's in your stomachs."

At his words, the four Merciful Ones looked ready for action. But Helian Wumeng had no intention of lingering. He laughed, looking like he was thoroughly enjoying the spectacle. "Spit it out!"

The face of the demonic cultivator beside the black-robed youth fell. With a sickening retch, he vomited a mass of flesh onto the ground. It was immediately bound by the Heavenly Light and lifted into the air, forming a sphere. Only then did the two survivors fly, trembling, across the river.

They scrambled to hide beneath Helian Wumeng's cloud. They shot a panicked glance at Li Zhouwei before looking back at their own Daoist Master. Their eyes seemed to be burned by the sight of the new scar, and they quickly lowered their heads, daring not to look again.

A Purple Mansion Realm dharma body should not be able to hold a scar. He had clearly seared the wound into his memory, deliberately preserving it. As the demonic cultivators fled back, he grabbed the two survivors, and his Baleful Qi form dissolved into black smoke, leaving only his voice to echo in the dark:

"Too many spell arts today. How dull! I look forward to... a rematch, Daoist Friend, once you've found a more suitable weapon!"

After such a battle, Helian Wumeng could naturally tell that Li Zhouwei had been holding back. If his weapon hadn't been so inferior, he wouldn't have been forced to close the distance and resort to different Dharma Arts. And without that thread of Supreme Yang in the Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light, the exchange would not have ended so quickly.

The Heavenly Light shone brightly as the darkness receded. The Buddhist cultivators retreated with their leader. Li Zhouwei stood upon his cloud, quietly watching them go.

'Helian Wumeng... Tiefu Kingdom...'

He lowered his dharma artifact, looking with a pained expression at the 'Grand Ascension'. The crescent-moon blade was already slightly bent and warped, shedding faint golden motes of light.

'Materials for an ancient dharma artifact are so hard to find. At least it didn't break completely.'

He tore his eyes from his dharma artifact and glanced with a complex expression at the white vapor on the horizon. Finally, his gaze fell upon the ball of flesh the demonic cultivator had expelled.

"Get out," he said coldly.

A head emerged from the gory mass, attached only to a torso. He had no limbs. His features were handsome, but his face was smeared with blood and deathly pale. His breathing was a faint thread, his lips trembled, and he looked to be on death's door. It was Fei Qing'yi!

During the battle on the lake, with their reinforcements gone, the demonic cultivators had decided to retreat. They used a Purple Mansion Realm talisman to cover their escape, then tricked Fei Qing'yi, telling him not to resist. One of them had then swallowed him whole, clearly intending to carry him across the river. Whether to be used as a cultivation supplement or for some other purpose, he was to be handed over to Helian Wumeng for disposal.

Having been inside the cultivator's stomach, most of his dharma power and vital blood had been drained away. Now that he was spat out, Fei Qing'yi's ravaged body was sustained only by the stubborn vitality of the Foundation Establishment Realm. He looked as if he might dissolve at any second. His pupils were wide and unfocused. He shivered, staring at Li Zhouwei as his head slumped forward.

His consciousness was fading, but he knew exactly who Li Zhouwei was. He had even seen this man from a distance before.

'It's only been a few years...'

Li Zhouwei smiled down at him. He blew lightly. A white wind swept up, pulling arms and legs from the gory mass and planting them back onto Fei Qing'yi's torso like sprouts. A surge of Bright Yang power made his limbs whole once more.

Color returned to Fei Qing'yi's face. But before he could even orient himself in the air, the gleaming white halberd was already high, reflecting the sky's clouds and golden light. It whistled through the air and punched straight through his chest.

*Squelch!*

The halberd lifted him high. Fei Qing'yi hung from it like a dead fish, staring at the sky. In his upside-down view of the world, all he could see was that pair of cold, dark-golden eyes. The world spun. The pain was agonizing. A single, icy thought remained in his mind:

'It would have been cleaner to just die!'
