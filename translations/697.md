# Chapter 697: The Purple Mansion Dharma Assembly (Part 1)

The waters of Moongaze Lake were placid under a cloudless sky. An indigo pavilion stood over the rippling surface, connected to a central island by a long causeway. A few stone lotus lamps flickered with a soft, magical light.

The octagonal pavilion was adorned with eight distinct runes, highlighted with cinnabar reliefs. It faced the Western Mountains, and above its entrance hung a jade plaque inscribed with large characters:

[Vermillion Bud Pavilion]

A woman in a light red, cloud-patterned satin dress sat within the pavilion. A silver necklace graced her neck, and an ancient book rested in her hands. It was Li Que'wan.

The Vermillion Bud Pavilion was where she practiced her cultivation. The Dao of the Whole Pill she pursued was not concerned with the abundance of spiritual energy, but with the transformations of the material world. For this reason, Li Zhouwei had scoured the entire lake to find the location most attuned to such changes and built this pavilion for her.

While a lake had little to do with the Whole Pill, this specific spot was where the clan had once set up a formation, activated the Reflecting Metal, and dispelled the great restrictive array on the island. As such, it could be considered a place of transformation.

Mount Wu would have been the ideal location, as it was the former cultivation ground of the High Shaman Duanmu Kui. Unfortunately, after Li Ximing achieved his divine ability there, the entire mountain had been transformed into a Bright Yang sacred ground, forever changing its nature.

'The clan is going to rename Mount Wu, but I wonder what they'll decide.'

A breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm was a joyous occasion, but Li Que'wan was tinged with worry. While clan affairs were proceeding smoothly, her own personal matters remained unresolved.

Her father, Li Baotuo, had come to the island to live a blissful life of walking his hounds and training his birds. Her brothers, however, ran a shipping business between the two shores. They were skilled, and with her influence, their business naturally flourished. But they had encroached upon another family's interests. In a fit of anger, the other party had filed a complaint with the Court of Justice, accusing her brothers of "leveraging her name for profit." That very night, they were escorted to Mount Qingdu.

Li Que'wan was familiar with the clan's procedures and knew her brothers were in no immediate danger. But her father was so frantic with worry that his mouth had broken out in sores. He had already come to see her several times.

She was grateful that the breakthrough celebration was occupying everyone's attention. Her clan uncle, Li Zhouluo, who was stationed at Mount Qingdu, had not yet passed judgment. Otherwise, she couldn't imagine what a mess it would become.

She sighed and set down the book. Glancing at the time, she thought, 'Three months have passed in a flash. The other sects will be arriving at Moongaze Lake soon. I must go and receive them.'

Li Que'wan and Li Jiangqian were the rising stars of their generation. With Li Ximing's ascension to the Purple Mansion Realm, the Li clan had become a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan. Her and Jiangqian's status had soared overnight. It was a world of difference.

Li Que'wan pressed the book to her chest, her heart a mix of joy and anxiety.

'In the eyes of the other sects, Jiangqian and I are probably seen as figures like Chi Fubo or Si Tongyi were back in the day. We have no choice but to greet them.'

It was the way of the world. News of their clan, big or small, had likely already reached the other major powers. Li Que'wan guessed that in their eyes, the clan head, Li Zhouwei, was now being compared to the likes of Tuoba Chongyuan.

'With reputation comes trouble…'

She flew from the pavilion up into the clouds, where she saw Li Minggong standing on a cloud of fire, dressed in red ceremonial robes. As a cultivator of the True Fire Dao, her Pheasant Li March technique had an air of the Fire Luan, which was only enhanced by her attire. She stood in the air with a dignified grace.

"Greetings, my lady!" Li Que'wan said with a respectful bow.

Li Minggong spent most of her years guarding the North Shore and the river border, so she and Li Que'wan had rarely met. But as the eldest sister of the First Branch, she was one of her closest Foundation Establishment relatives. Furthermore, as one of the few female cultivators at that level, Li Que'wan naturally felt an affinity for her.

Li Minggong's poised and generous nature had long ago earned praise from Li Xijun, and she possessed a bright, likable charisma. After Li Que'wan offered a warm greeting, Li Minggong stood gracefully and replied in a light, cheerful tone, "Ah, Wan'er, you're here. Just stay behind me. Jiangqian is with Chenghui, receiving guests on the other side."

"You look beautiful, Grand-aunt," Li Que'wan said with a smile, covering her mouth.

Li Minggong accepted the compliment with ease. She glanced at Li Que'wan and chuckled. "I'm getting old. I can't compare to your youth."

As they spoke, Li Zhouluo arrived, leading a group of people on a current of golden qi. He was dressed in magnificent robes, blue over white, and his sixth-layer Qi Refining cultivation pulsed with golden energy. As the head of the third branch, his standing in the Li family was already quite high. For him to personally guide these guests meant they were of extraordinary status.

Li Minggong nodded in approval. Li Que'wan, however, tensed at the sight of her uncle.

'Uncle Zhouluo is in charge of affairs at Mount Qingdu. My brothers' case will have to go through him…'

Unaware of her thoughts, Li Minggong smiled and stepped forward to greet the newcomers. "Welcome, friends from the Profound Peak Gate! I am Li Minggong…"

"Congratulations, congratulations!" The man at the front wore the golden robes of the Profound Peak Gate and was clearly the sect master. He had a fair, clean-shaven face and offered polite pleasantries before formally introducing himself. "I am Kong Guxi of the Profound Peak Gate. It is a pleasure to meet you, fellow Daoist."

Kong Guxi was polite, but the old man beside him was beaming, his beard bristling with excitement. He tugged at his sleeve and laughed. "I'm Kong Yu! Do you know of me, young lady? Li Xuanxuan is a dear friend of mine! We go back many years. Where is that old fellow now?"

Old Kong Yu was a lively and sentimental man. He seemed as overjoyed as if it were his own sect that had produced a Purple Mansion cultivator.

Li Minggong laughed. "I have heard of you, Elder. My elders have mentioned you several times. They are already waiting for you on the mountain. Please, come inside."

Her words gave Kong Yu a great deal of face. The old man immediately puffed out his chest, immensely pleased. Kong Guxi smiled and added a few words of his own. "I have prepared a few small gifts along our journey. Please accept them."

These were the Profound Peak Gate's congratulatory gifts to the Li family, mostly precious herbs and magical artifacts. Any separate dealings between Daoist Master Changxi and Li Ximing would be handled later.

The cultivators flanking Kong Guxi quickly presented several jade boxes. Li Que'wan thanked them repeatedly as she respectfully accepted them. Li Zhouluo then escorted the Profound Peak cultivators toward the Milin Mountains, leaving Li Minggong and Li Que'wan alone in the clouds.

Li Minggong watched them go, her mind racing. 'I hear Daoist Master Changxi of Profound Peak is nearing the end of his lifespan. I wonder if it's true. Their visit this time… they likely have their own plans.'

When Li Ximing broke through, Daoist Master Changxi was the first to arrive with congratulations. While his proximity was a factor, his words had shown genuine sincerity.

Li Minggong glanced over at Li Que'wan and saw the girl staring off into space. She knew what was on her mind; she had heard about the trouble with Li Baotuo's children. It was a minor issue, but it directly involved Li Que'wan.

"Que'wan," Li Minggong said seriously, "don't worry. The clan will handle it justly."

Li Que'wan snapped back to the present and quickly thanked her.

Li Minggong then smiled. "Jiangqian doesn't know yet. If he did, someone would be in for a world of trouble."

…

Milin Mountain.

The mountain itself was not particularly tall, but its range was vast and rolling, teeming with spiritual energy. After the Yu family's fall, the area had descended into chaos. The original palaces and pavilions were shattered, leaving behind a wreck.

These structures were not ordinary buildings. They had been built by cultivators, not by simply raising them from the earth with magic. They required intricate formations, inlaid with spiritual materials and artifacts—a complex undertaking.

When the Li family took over, they were immediately beset by major events and the conflict between the North and South Shores. They had no resources to spare for repairs, focusing only on restoring the spiritual fields and herb gardens to secure resources and provide a place for cultivation.

Only after the conflict ended and the Li family enjoyed a decade of peace and growth did they have the strength to begin rebuilding Milin Mountain. In the last three months, the clan-wide celebration had transformed the entire mountain range into something new.

Pavilions and halls now cascaded down the slopes, standing tall amidst the clouds. Green stone steps wound through them, shrouded in ethereal spiritual mist. The five spiritual springs on the mountain gushed forth, their waters flowing down channels carved alongside the steps, winding through various courtyards before reaching the mountain's base.

Luminous lanterns lined the paths, each painted with the emblems of Bright Yang and Radiant Fire. The steps themselves were carved with images of flood dragons and ocean waves. Cultivators flew back and forth, landing and taking off from the courtyards.

The transformation wasn't limited to Milin Mountain. The entire area around the lake—its sixteen prefectures, two peaks, and one mountain—had been renewed. Six great gatehouses, modeled after the Radiant Origin Pass, now stood sentinel around the lake.

These gatehouses were built of white brick, with ornate corner towers and seventy-two distinct ridges. Each stood twelve zhang tall, their designs varying slightly based on their location and orientation. They were named the Four Symbols Gate, the Profound Enterprise Gate, the Courtyard Abyss Gate, the Changxi Gate, the Inherited Clarity Gate, and the Zhou Martial Gate.

The Four Symbols Gate on the South Shore was the most magnificent, standing a full head taller than the others. The Changxi Gate stood at the foot of Milin Mountain, connected to its defensive formations. All cultivators had to enter the mountain through it.

Li Zhouluo led Kong Yu and the others down to the Changxi Gate, where the brothers Li Zhoufang were on guard. The two were older than even Li Zhouwei, with grown sons of their own. Their talent was average, and they had started their cultivation late, making them look far more weathered and unremarkable.

Kong Guxi glanced around and praised, "What a fine Changxi Gate…"

All six gatehouses had been personally designed by Li Ximing and empowered by his divine ability. Their patterns not only contained the essence of Bright Yang but also held a profound mystery that captivated the eye. Though Kong Guxi and Kong Yu did not cultivate the Bright Yang Dao, they could sense its profundity.

Just as they passed through the gate, they saw a man in white and gold armor standing within. He had broad shoulders and sharp, golden eyes.

Kong Yu hesitated for a moment, but Kong Guxi was already stunned. 'The White Qilin of the Li Clan… Li Zhouwei!'

When Li Ximing had been in seclusion, the Li clan had relied solely on Li Zhouwei and Li Chenghui to hold the line. Every major power had been watching him. Kong Guxi, having just taken over the Profound Peak Gate from Kong Tingyun, knew this better than anyone.

When a demon general ran rampant on the North Shore of Moongaze Lake and the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion suddenly established themselves on the northern bank, the Fei family had cried for help. It was Li Zhouwei who had enlisted the Elder White Ape to defend the shore. He and Li Chenghui had blocked the river, activating the ancient formation of Cloud-Gathering Southern Sky to slay the demon.

The entire affair had taken less than a night. By the time the forces from the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion were halfway there, Li Zhouwei had already killed the demon and sent its head to the Azure Pond Sect. Everyone knew the demon was almost certainly connected to the Three Sects, but with the head delivered to Azure Pond, they could only swallow the loss.

That event marked the beginning of the North Shore conflict. In the decade that followed, from covert harassment to open disputes over spiritual fields, Li Zhouwei had led the charge. With Li Xizhi's full support—who even returned personally on several occasions—the Three Sects of Secret Diffusion, despite having several times the number of Foundation Establishment cultivators, could only chip away at the Li's interests on the lake, never shaking their foundation.

As Li Zhouwei's cultivation and techniques grew, and as Li Chenghui mastered the Six Thunder Profound Punishment Talisman, the Floating Cloud Cave was rendered helpless unless their cave master intervened. In the end, even when the Floating Cloud Cave Master, Fudou, attacked personally, Li Zhouwei still managed to escape.

The Li clan then used the Cloud-Gathering Southern Sky formation to defend the North Shore. At the cost of leaving the North Shore barren, they consolidated their forces, freeing Li Zhouwei from having to stand guard constantly.

Although Li Ximing's breakthrough had led to the Floating Cloud Cave's collapse, in Kong Guxi's view, Li Zhouwei's repeated triumphs had already made it impossible for them to pose a real threat to the Li clan.

Seeing Li Zhouwei now, Kong Guxi noted the unusual color of his eyes and his powerful aura. He seemed formidable, but otherwise showed no other peculiarities.

He respectfully clasped his hands. "Greetings, Clan Head!"

The golden-eyed young man nodded at him. "The Sect Master of Profound Peak. Zhouwei greets you."

Kong Guxi's cultivation was not high, and his clan's Earth Virtue techniques were not suited for combat. He was likely no match for Li Zhouwei and quickly responded with courtesy.

Standing beside Li Zhouwei was another man, his hair half-white, his features kind and his complexion ruddy. Two strings of medicinal pouches swayed at his waist. His deep cultivation seemed to emanate from him, suggesting he practiced the Wood Virtue.

Kong Guxi had never met this man, but seeing his Xiao family attire, he knew it had to be Xiao Yuansi.

A realization dawned on him. 'In today's Li clan, only Xiao Yuansi is worthy of a personal welcome from Li Zhouwei! That pill of his… everyone once mocked him for his foolishness. Now, they all praise his foresight!'

Xiao Yuansi himself had only learned the news three months ago. The shock had left him speechless for a long time. Even now, he was filled with joy and relief. The old man looked as though he had consumed a precious elixir; his complexion glowed, and his eyes sparkled.

Kong Yu looked on with envy and sentiment. 'To have a Purple Mansion disciple, and to have played a major role in that disciple's breakthrough… this senior need not worry for the rest of his days.'

More figures began to gather at the Changxi Gate. Cultivators from various families came forward to greet the White Qilin of the Li clan. Despite his formidable power, Li Zhouwei was courteous, returning each greeting without a hint of aloofness.

Just as Kong Guxi was about to head up the mountain, a blazing ray of celestial light descended from the sky and solidified on the steps, revealing a man in a gold and white Daoist robe. His features were regular, with no striking characteristics save for his pale golden eyes and the brilliant point of light between his brows.

It could be none other than Li Ximing.

Kong Guxi did not dare to look for long, his gaze quickly shifting away. Behind the man stood a middle-aged figure with a plain appearance, wearing a brown robe with mountain patterns and a jade pendant on his chest. Kong Guxi's pupils contracted. He dropped to his knees with a thud.

"Greetings, Patriarch! Greetings, Daoist Master!"

At his cry, the other cultivators from Profound Peak Gate froze for a second before following his lead, a wave of them falling to their knees in unison. In an instant, every member of the Profound Peak Gate was kowtowing.

Kong Yu and the others were now high-ranking members of the sect; how could they not recognize their own patriarch, Daoist Master Changxi, standing beside Li Ximing? Even those who had never met him in person recognized the portrait that hung in their sect's main hall.

As the Profound Peak delegation knelt, the other cultivators were momentarily stunned before most followed suit. Even the direct descendants of other Purple Mansion cultivators bowed their heads and clasped their hands.

"Greetings, Daoist Master Zhaojing!" they all intoned.

Xiao Yuansi's head shot up, his eyes meeting Li Ximing's face. A smile spread across the old man's lips. Amidst the chorus of reverent greetings, Li Ximing gave a slight bow.

"Greetings, Master," he said softly.
