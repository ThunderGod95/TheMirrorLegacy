# Chapter 981: Qi Xi

Daoist Master Xiang Chun, with her ties to the Dragon-kin, naturally possessed her own methods. While she had never heard of any connection between the Dragon-kin and the Encompassing Profoundity Daoist Tradition, the Dragon-kin were undeniably one of the greatest powers in the world, backed by the Dragon Monarch himself.

Despite the potential for a future conflict of interest with Li Zhouwei, and the ambiguity of their current intentions, the White Dragon lineage had so far provided more benefits than harm. They had even sent a Spiritual Treasure when he had his breakthrough. Thus, Li Zhouwei nodded to the Daoist Master and replied, "Since we've met by chance, let us proceed together."

After all, he had already scoured the surrounding areas and had nowhere else to go. Having her lead the way would save him considerable effort.

At his words, Xiang Chun's expression brightened. Beside them, Daoist Master Yu Ming flicked his sleeves, declaring magnanimously, "I only came in to try my luck. I've had a decent harvest and am quite satisfied, so I won't venture any deeper. I'll just look around these parts, pick up a few small things, and find a weak point in the formation to head back!"

It was undoubtedly a wise choice. Though Daoist Master Yu Ming was nearing the end of his lifespan and had come here to risk his life for his family's legacy, his gains would mean nothing if he didn't make it out alive. To perish here would be to lose everything and then some.

Seeing him ride the wind and depart, Xiang Chun nodded in acknowledgment before flying up alongside Li Zhouwei.

She spoke in a low voice, "Jiangbei is unstable. Cultivation Transcendence keeps its gates closed, and the Shen family has lost a great deal of territory. But the old patriarch is cunning; he took the opportunity to move his people overseas. They're settling in the outer seas, likely planning to establish themselves as an overseas clan in a practical sense."

Li Zhouwei nodded silently. With the Wave-Suppressing Mansion abroad and his own excellent conditions, he too was confident he could retreat if necessary. If his clan weren't such a crucial piece on the board, he would have left long ago. "They're lacking successors, after all," he replied, "and Jiangbei is a dangerous place."

But Xiang Chun shook her head wistfully. "Not necessarily... though the danger is quite real."

The Dragon-kin controlled the Eastern Sea. If the Shen family were making any moves, it was highly unlikely they could escape the Dragon-kin's notice. Li Zhouwei made a mental note of this. As they traveled, Xiang Chun continued softly, "Have you not been leaving the lake much in recent years, fellow Daoist?"

Li Zhouwei gave a slight nod. With the grand political situation between the north and south, he had to consider his clan and had little freedom to venture out. "Moongaze Lake is by the river, and the currents are turbulent."

A knowing look passed through Xiang Chun’s eyes. She lowered her voice. "That may not always be the case. There are a few clans who still have designs on you and will likely come to test the waters. If you truly wish to protect your bloodline on the lake, it is wise not to act rashly. However, once you advance further, with three divine abilities, or perhaps even attain the rank of Great Daoist Master and perfect your abilities, it will no longer matter..."

"By then, those in the world who could claim to be your superior could be counted on one hand. Petty schemers might still try to test you, but they will no longer be able to bear the price of failure."

Her expression grew solemn, her demeanor more composed. "When that time comes, feel free to visit the Eastern Sea more often. The Dragon Prince has defended you before the various lineages. If you could visit the Dragon Palace a few times afterward to meet with him, it would give him more leeway."

Li Zhouwei pondered for a moment. He understood that the Dragon Prince she referred to was Dingjiao. The crown prince of the White Dragon lineage was a figure of considerable magnanimity, and both he and his father, the Dragon King of the Beihai Sea, belonged to the faction that advocated for leniency and fostering good relations with him, a White Qilin. Dingjiao had sought him out early on, even taking him to see the former crown prince of Wei...

'It's hard to tell what's true and what's false,' Li Zhouwei mused, 'but at the very least, no other dragon has been willing to make contact. The White Dragon line must have been under significant pressure...'

Li Zhouwei fell silent for a moment before nodding. "Thank you for the reminder, fellow Daoist."

She smiled faintly, then changed the subject, finally asking the question on her mind. "I've heard that... Wuguang Luoxia left no instructions for the Daoist Traditions, acting as if they were unaware of your existence. This is interesting. I wonder where Daoist Master Xue went after heading south."

Her eyes were sharp as she stared directly at Li Zhouwei, though she seemed to be asking and answering her own question. "Daoist Master Xue has perfected his divine abilities and reached the pinnacle of the five techniques; an Auxiliary Position is within his grasp. In ancient times, he would have been the Hall Master of an immortal mansion, an acting authority. As vast as Wanling Heaven is, if he had been born there, he would be seated beside the highest authority."

'Daoist Master Xue?!'

An image of the man surfaced in Li Zhouwei’s mind. He asked, feigning casualness, "Daoist Master Xue? I don't believe I know his esteemed name..."

Daoist Master Xiang Chun turned to him, an inscrutable look in her eyes. "His surname is Xue, his given name, Yang. He is of Wuguang's Profound Tradition, an orthodox cultivator of Comprehending Profoundity."

"An orthodox cultivator of Comprehending Profoundity..."

Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow, deliberately probing, "Is he a figure on the level of Daoist Master Donghua?"

Daoist Master Xiang Chun hadn't expected him to mention Li Jiangqun. She considered it. "It's difficult to compare them that way. Luoxia dares to claim Wuguang's Profound Tradition, propagating its teachings as the master of Comprehending Profoundity in the world. Although the Immortal Mansion never made such a statement back then, its very name carried the air of a profound master, so there is a similarity. However... while Daoist Master Donghua's talent far surpassed his, the Daoist Tradition was in decline at the time... his Dao-Profundity at the time of his premature death was not as great as Xue Yang's is now. I'm afraid they cannot be compared..."

"Immortal Mansion..."

Hearing her words, Li Zhouwei finally had a realization. He had heard of many immortal mansions over the years, but whenever high-level cultivators mentioned the "Immortal Mansion," they were always referring to the Moon Radiance Immortal Abode on Moongaze Lake. It was often called the Moonlight Origin Mansion directly. There had to be a reason. "So that's how it is... It seems Daoist Master Donghua was the inheritor of the Moon Radiance Profound Tradition."

"Correct."

She said wistfully, "An orthodox cultivator of Azure Profoundity, one of the three great profundities."

This woman, having spent time with the Dragon-kin, was privy to much information. She looked up, a chill in her gaze. "In primordial times, the Golden Core positions had many masters, and their titles were specific. Depending on their authority and Daoist Tradition, they were called Divine Monarch, Immortal Lord, True Monarch, Imperial Monarch... Now, order has collapsed, and everyone is called True Monarch. But how many of them actually possess the carefree bearing of a True Monarch... that's hard to say."

Her words stopped abruptly as she raised an eyebrow at him. "Wasn't your Emperor of Wei the Bright Splendor Imperial Monarch? Tuoba Xuantan should also be called an Imperial Monarch. The rest are mostly unworthy of the title; they'd be ashamed to even call themselves that. The Emperor of Qi... he wouldn't even dare!"

A smile touched her lips. "Shi Chang has a guilty conscience! Even if the times create the hero, he was an unqualified one..."

"Thrust into the spotlight by the turn of events, he seized a Golden Core position for himself. Knowing he was sitting on a volcano, he tried to hastily secure Metal Virtue through his revolutionary achievements, but he trusted the wrong people. It led to his death, the destruction of his kingdom, and the slaughter of his entire clan. He was completely outmaneuvered by the masters of the Golden Oneness Daoist Tradition... The fact that the Dawn Qi can still bear two Intercalary Positions to this day is thanks to his prior contributions!"

Li Zhouwei listened quietly. With his ever-increasing Dao-Profundity, he naturally understood her words, his mind racing like lightning.

'The three divisions of Lesser Yang... Beiyao and Xiyan both have directional components in their names, corresponding to the Bei Shaoyang and Western Lesser Yang of the Daoist arts. But I've never heard of Xiyang Dragon Monarch being the Eastern Lesser Yang—yet his name contains _Xi_ (Dawn)! And Lesser Yang gives birth to Dawn (_Xi_). It's highly probable that this master was assigned to the Dawn Qi position!'

He now understood why the Dawn Qi position, despite being masterless, remained so influential. Xiyang Dragon Monarch, who had obtained one of the remains of the Lesser Yang Demon Monarch, was still active in the world. And from what Xiang Chun had said, there had even been an Intercalary Position holder in the past...

'No wonder,' he thought, 'even without a master, its Fruition Attainment is no different from an occupied position.'

As his thoughts shifted, Xiang Chun paid him no mind and continued nonchalantly, "And then there is the Tianwu True Qi... that master has the prestige of an Imperial Monarch, he simply refuses to acknowledge it himself."

True Monarch Tianwu had always been respected, and Xiang Chun was no exception. She spoke of the other deceased True Monarchs with little courtesy, but she referred to True Monarch Tianwu as "master." Li Zhouwei silently mulled over the details in her words when both he and the suddenly silent Xiang Chun looked up at the same time.

In the distance, a hazy white light was flowing. They could faintly discern a colossal white formation that stretched across the heavens, filling their field of view. An intense aura of divine abilities was slowly spreading, with bolts of lightning and True Fire appearing on the barrier.

They were still a great distance away, but Li Zhouwei's sharp golden eyes could still see streaks of light scattered across the sky, both near and far.

'Quite a few powerful figures have gathered.'

Neither of them rushed forward. Xiang Chun pinched her fingers together, seemingly making a calculation. Li Zhouwei, however, scanned his surroundings. A flash of gold caught his eye, making him frown. "Hm?"

He narrowed his eyes. Within the overlapping, illusory colors, he could see cultivators locked in battle. He subtly activated his Spirit Probe ability. Beside him, Xiang Chun finished her calculations and also turned her attention to the scene. "It's still early," she said softly. "Why don't we go get a piece of the pie first?"

Li Zhouwei's Spirit Probe had already revealed the situation, and he was about to suggest the same. He immediately strode forward on a path of light. The golden radiance ahead expanded rapidly, transforming into a magnificent, multicolored glow—it was the unmistakable formation of Buddhist cultivators, radiating infinite light!

By the time they were closer, Xiang Chun could also see clearly. She gazed at the middle-aged man surrounded by the splendid light and murmured, "Minghuang, do you recognize him?"

Truthfully, Li Zhouwei had never met the man. But the golden clouds stretching endlessly across the sky, holding up a mysterious pass, were well-documented in his family's records. He recognized it—it was the Bright Yang Spiritual Treasure, the Huai River Map!

And beneath the protection of this Spiritual Treasure, a man with an ugly expression was held aloft by a barrier of azure light as hard as metal—it was Si Yuanli.

A brilliant light enveloped the sky where two massive golden forms stood. One had a long face, black eyes, and a pair of horse ears, a terrifying yet familiar sight. It was undoubtedly his old enemy, Taixi.

The other golden form was even larger, pure white, with layers of feathers draping its back. Its Buddhist head had three faces; the two on the sides depicted expressions of weeping and laughter, while the front-facing one was incredibly majestic, its eyes glaring with fury.

The two had kept their distance, so Si Yuanli had not noticed them. He was struggling to hold on under the siege of the two Mahas. Protected by his Spiritual Treasure and clutching several talismans he had just pulled from his storage pouch, he managed to maintain a semblance of composure.

"He has some ties with my family," Li Zhouwei replied.

Daoist Master Xiang Chun commented, "One is a third-generation Taixi, the other a fourth-generation Yanbai. Both are quite powerful, but he's managing to hold out. He shows no sign of compromising; he's a greedy one, too."

Opportunities within the grotto-heaven were plentiful, and no one wanted to waste time. For the stalemate to have lasted this long, it was likely because Si Yuanli refused to give up anything. This was perfect for Li Zhouwei, who was looking for a place to use the blessing of Illuminating Sun and Moon! He raised his halberd and declared, "When it comes to the affairs of Buddhist cultivators, I'm compelled to interfere."

Daoist Master Xiang Chun smiled. "Go on then, fellow Daoist. I'll cover for you. I will give you a warning when the main formation is about to break. If you can't make it back in time, I can't wait."

"Naturally."

Li Zhouwei's golden eyes flickered. His Spirit Probe had already uncovered several crucial details. He soared into the air, moving like a streak of light. The Audience with the Celestial Gate immediately materialized in the sky, descending with a booming aura of radiance.

_BOOM!_

Flames of multicolored light surged. The Taixi, who was channeling his power to suppress Si Yuanli, saw his opponent's defenses falter. A sense of triumph filled him. Mahas loved to provoke their enemies, especially high-level Purple Mansion Realm cultivators like this one. He sneered, "Fellow Daoist, you'd best hand some things over! Who else is going to save you? Chi Buzi?! Haha!"

The mocking laughter had barely faded when a sudden chill ran down the Taixi's spine. He looked up, caught completely off guard by a streak of golden light—the Celestial Gate was descending. He was instantly horrified.

'Audience with the Celestial Gate?!'

'It's Li Zhouwei!'

Shock and fury warred within him. He immediately channeled his dharma power, and his body erupted in golden light. A purplish-black spiritual bowl leaped from his chest, soaring up to absorb the torrent of Heavenly Light. Yet, coveting his own treasure, he didn't dare use the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl to directly block the Audience with the Celestial Gate. Instead, he just spat out a blast of golden energy. "Hah!"

Pinned down by the two, Si Yuanli was already in an embarrassing and desperate state, his face pale. He was hesitating over how much of his loot to share, afraid that their strength far surpassed his and that he wouldn't escape without a significant sacrifice. A fire of frustration burned in his heart. Seeing this turn of events, he was overjoyed!

"Fellow Daoist Minghuang! Thank you for your help! I shall reward you handsomely!"

He had once addressed Li Xuanfeng as a peer, but now his tone was much more intimate. Gazing at the Bright Yang radiance descending from the sky, he found the colors exceptionally pleasing. He sighed internally, 'Visiting Moongaze Lake was the right choice! This marriage alliance was a perfect calculation! To think it would actually get Li Zhouwei to intervene!'

The brilliant light in the sky exploded. The Heavenly Radiance, Hidden Light technique struck the golden energy from the Taixi's mouth, shattering it to pieces. But another streak of white energy shot forward, materializing beneath the Audience with the Celestial Gate!

It was the Maha with the snow-white golden body and three faces. The sounds of weeping and laughter rose simultaneously as it raised a bronze seal, channeling a divine ability that shot toward Li Zhouwei's face like a thunderbolt. "Hmph!"

Li Zhouwei activated his Sovereign's Perilous Tread Body Divine Ability and charged forward with his halberd, qilin patterns flaring across his skin. The Buddhist sonic attack that should have pierced his mind was rendered completely ineffective. Only the physical force of the dharma power remained, which was promptly split in two by his weapon, dissipating into golden motes of light that swirled around him resentfully.

The Maha, however, was undaunted. It used an ordinary-looking bronze seal to momentarily block the descending Celestial Gate, all three of its faces contorting in anger. Accustomed to running rampant in the north, it roared,

"Audacious Demon!"

The familiar words echoed in his ears. Li Zhouwei's smile turned cold, his eyes glowing brighter as the sign of a solar eclipse appeared on his brow. The Sovereign's Perilous Tread had already carried him right before the Maha. 

What kind of creature are you!"

Streams of black and gold light erupted, lashing out from the radiance to bind the Yanbai's body, causing its expression to change drastically.

_BOOM!_

The incomparably tough Maha body froze for an instant. Marks from the impacts appeared all over it as the black and gold streams tapped against its form, rapidly climbing its limbs with a harsh, grating sound.

"Such audacity, demon!"

The nearby Taixi's expression shifted. He leaped into the air, filled with regret.

'These cultivators from the Great Adoration Dharma Realm are more stubborn than the last... why did you have to provoke him! What grudge do you have against him... Now he won't back down, and is the White Qilin known for having a good temper?!'

He knew he couldn't delay. He immediately drove the Void-Subduing Demon Pacification Bowl to fully suppress Si Yuanli, whose divine ability was starting to wane. A vicious look appeared on his face.

"If you still refuse to yield, fellow Daoist, don't blame us for getting rough!"

But he then realized Si Yuanli had already relaxed his techniques, standing there with a strange expression on his face. "Hm?"

He belatedly turned his gaze and discovered that a man in azure robes had appeared beside him at some unknown point, quiet as a ghost. The man was smiling at him, playfully tossing a small Pristine Water cauldron in his hand. A black pearl at his waist hung heavily, its golden tassels fluttering in the wind.

Seeing the Taixi look over, countless illusions of Pristine Water light materialized in the surroundings. A suffocating divine ability surged forth, locking onto the Taixi and rendering him immobile. The man even broke into a smile, revealing perfectly white, even teeth.

"You recognize me, don't you, fellow Daoist? Hmm?"
