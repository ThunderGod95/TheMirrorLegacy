# Chapter 804: Great Scripture of Radiance

Li Chenghuai paused, stunned. Li Zhouluo quickly rose, gathered several reports from the desk, and handed them over, explaining the situation in a low voice. Li Chenghuai’s brow furrowed tightly as he read. He raised an eyebrow. "So, this was waiting for me..."

After reviewing the matters of the western shore, he looked over Li Zhouluo’s proposed solutions. He glanced at them only briefly before shaking his head. "Summary execution in court. That was poorly handled... You lack the necessary prestige, and you were afraid of wounding the clan’s sentiments..."

Finally, he read the report regarding the legacy shelter appointments. He froze for a moment but didn't say much, merely sighing. "Let us go."

With Li Chenghuai out of seclusion, Li Zhouluo felt as if a thousand-pound weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He unfastened his black robe, draped it over his arm, and hurried to keep pace. As they walked, Li Chenghuai asked, "Where is the list of legacy shelter appointments?"

Li Zhouluo had it ready, tucked inside his robes. He presented it to his father. Li Chenghuai scanned it. "You balanced the four branches, so it's not a complete failure. The numbers are a bit high, but since the Old Master will allow Jiangqian to handle this, having a few extra names doesn't matter."

Li Zhouluo didn't mention Li Xuanxuan’s intentions, but Li Chenghuai, calculating the timeline, already understood. He didn't press the point and simply walked forward, suddenly asking, "Regarding Brother Cheng's inheritance, there were three candidates in the ancestral registry. What is the status of those three now?"

Li Zhouluo had been monitoring the situation and replied immediately. "The one with the closest blood relation and the most suitable age is Zhoutui. He has been working diligently on the island, showing great enthusiasm for both his cultivation and the management of the spirit fields..."

"The older one is Li Zhouda, also closely related. He’s impulsive and decisive, a whirlwind in action. He currently holds a post in the Jade Court. His only flaw is his temper. Last year, he got drunk and assaulted a clansman... The matter was reported all the way to Qingdu."

He paused briefly before finishing. "There is one more, Li Zhouxun, whose bloodline is more distant. He’s the one the elder allowed to stay in the manor before he passed. He seems to have given up hope early on. He didn't take any position on the island; instead, he has used this time to enter seclusion and cultivate."

Li Chenghuai pondered this for a breath, then shook his head. "A difficult choice..."

While Zhoutui's performance was good, his weeping at the funeral had been deeply unsettling. Zhouda’s violent temper naturally caused hesitation. As for the last one, Zhouxun—whether out of respect for Li Cheng’s lineage or some other reason—he had ultimately withdrawn himself, making it difficult for Li Chenghuai to help him even if he wanted to.

He mulled it over as they paused in the corridor. "What are their cultivation levels?"

Li Zhouluo bowed. "Zhouda is already at Qi Refining; he’s quite well-known among the brethren, and the support for him is slightly higher. The other two are still at Embyronic Breathing. Younger brothers Zhoutui and Zhouxun are of similar age and cultivation."

Li Zhouluo didn't state it explicitly, but his meaning was clear. Although the island provided them equal treatment, the resources Zhoutui enjoyed from his parents' generation were far beyond what the unsupported Zhouxun could access. This suggested Zhoutui's talent was inferior. Li Chenghuai understood. He resumed walking and nodded. "I see. You are not to interfere in this matter. After all, the Dao lineage has already been passed down. We don't know who will ultimately reach Foundation Establishment. The Dharma artifacts are being kept safe in the clan vaults. I will find an opportunity to meet Zhouxun. Do not show favoritism to anyone, nor express your approval."

If it hadn't been for Li Xuanxuan's earlier lecture, Li Zhouluo might have been confused by his father’s words. Now, however, he understood perfectly. "Your son understood long ago. I have not met privately with any of them in these years."

"Good." Li Chenghuai acknowledged, smiling. "This rare opportunity to temper you for three years has helped you mature greatly."

Li Zhouluo could only offer a sheepish smile. "I finally understand the stakes. If the Old Master hadn't been here, the lake our family spent six generations building would have been ruined by me in just two or three years."

The middle-aged man before him shook his head. "A hundred years of wise governance by the ancestors is only enough to survive one generation of incompetence. And one generation of incompetence is not enough to withstand three years of tyranny..."

He was counseling his eldest son when an apricot-yellow glow ascended into the sky. It drifted lazily toward the horizon, then descended mid-flight, transforming into countless apricot-colored blossoms of Radiant Fire that suddenly blew out over the lake.

These motes of Radiant Fire, large and small, flashed in the air with an ethereal grace, like countless river lanterns being released. The night had not yet fully yielded; in the pre-dawn twilight, the lake’s surface reflected the sky full of burning blossoms, drawing nearby cultivators to ride the winds and spectate.

*Omm!*

The defensive array of distant Mount Qingdu instantly activated. Colors shot toward the zenith as the [Morning Mist] within the formation surged, sweeping across the sky and scouring the stray Radiant Fire clean.

Li Zhouluo's eyes lit up. Li Chenghuai urgently mounted the wind, circling in the air. Just as he expected, he saw a man in crimson robes flying toward them, riding the fire. The robe was worn loosely, revealing a plain white tunic beneath. His black hair was wreathed in apricot-yellow flames.

He was tall and slender, with long, dark brows over a pair of golden eyes. His arms were crossed over his chest, a sword at his hip. In one fair hand, he held a small, round hammer, resting it casually against his shoulder.

Seeing Li Chenghuai approach, the young man smiled, the picture of high spirits. "Greetings, Grand-Uncle!"

"Congratulations!" Li Jiangqian clasped his hands and bowed. Li Chenghuai accepted with a smile. As the others hurried over, Li Jiangqian looked up slightly. His first question was: "How is Quewan?"

Li Zhouluo, having just arrived, smiled at the question. "Quewan also entered seclusion before the new year. She said she needed to harmonize her aura. Her cultivation has reached the peak of perfection; she is just choosing the right day to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm."

"Good." Although Li Jiangqian's generation was junior, his status was unique. Now that he had forged his immortal foundation, the weight of his words had undergone a qualitative change. He bowed to the assembled elders, and his second question was: "Is there any news from home regarding my father and the Daoist Master?"

Li Chenghuai shook his head as he led him down to the island. Li Jiangqian stood firm in the courtyard. When everyone had taken their seats, he scanned the room and noted one absence: Li Zhouming.

Li Jiangqian waited patiently. After half a cup of tea, a young man in red robes rushed in from outside the hall. Li Zhouming didn't dare meet Li Xuanxuan’s gaze, shrinking down as he slunk into a seat on the side.

The old man’s eyes were sharp. He noted that although the youth's clothes were tidy, his boots were mismatched and his hair ornament was overly simple. He had clearly worn his flamboyant clothes out riding this morning; nine times out of ten, he was flirting with some girl on the lake shore again.

Only then did Li Jiangqian clasp his hands in a formal bow. "Reporting to the elders: This junior has successfully forged the immortal foundation, 'Great Scripture of Radiance.' The Radiant Fire is now my constant companion. In motion, it can dispel golden gales and consume Horn Wood, burn metal and boil the seas. In stillness, it can stabilize flame and draw the parting light without startling a sparrow..."

He said only this, and the surrounding elders erupted in congratulations. Li Jiangqian nodded, accepting them. Li Xuanxuan observed this, then cleared his throat. "Let us dismiss for now..."

The old man waved his hand, sending the others away. He pulled Li Jiangqian aside into an inner room and closed the doors. "How is it? You cultivated the sixth-grade technique from the family archives. No one in our clan has ever succeeded with it before. It must possess unusual qualities."

Li Jiangqian helped him to a seat and served him tea, lowering his voice. "Old Master, I have mastered the Great Scripture of Radiance. This foundation is centered on arts. The foundation itself can store the parting light, granting extreme speed when riding fire. It connects to the 'First Manifestation of the Heavens,' so it can also dispel evil. Its innate mystery involves compounding medicines using wood; consuming them can extend life, heal wounds, and provide enhancements..."

"Oh?" Li Xuanxuan's eyes brightened. "Compounding medicines? Like alchemy?"

Li Jiangqian shook his head. He extended a hand, pressing two fingers together and bracing them with his thumb at the middle knuckle. *Pop.* A bright, apricot-yellow flame erupted.

This flame was unlike the eager, restless Radiant Fire they usually saw, nor was it like the five types of surging Radiant Fire within the [Yang-Li Crimson Sparrow Banner]. Instead, it rested perfectly steady on his fingertip, utterly motionless.

He smiled. "The unusual quality the Old Master spoke of... I am afraid it is this flame."

"The fire of my immortal foundation is called 'Apricot Li.' Ordinary fire fears earth, but this fire is highly resistant. The inheritance text described it in detail: aside from the two sacred earths of the Jixian Immortal Dao, it fears no other earth. Unfortunately, it is too volatile to be placed in a cauldron and cannot be used for alchemy. My sea of qi is entirely apricot-yellow. Even when I reach the Purple Mansion Realm, I will have no affinity with pill refinement."

"And the medicines compounded by it... most of them can only be consumed by me. Perhaps Luan birds and sparrows could also stomach them."

Li Xuanxuan nodded, indicating he understood. He sighed. "Truly worthy of a sixth-grade Radiant Fire technique. It possesses almost every advantage Radiant Fire can offer, and even manages to squeeze out a healing mystery..."

Li Jiangqian quickly waved his hands. "The division of Dao paths still holds true. Stealth, alchemy, healing others—this Dao path is completely incapable of them. And while my fire-riding speed is fast, the parting light is too intense, making it difficult to cultivate evasion arts. It’s all a trade-off. You gain in one area and lose in another; you cannot have it all!"

The old man nodded repeatedly, his expression full of emotion. He let out a long breath. "Now that you are out of seclusion, I must trouble you with family matters..."

The old man retrieved a small wooden box from the desk. He opened it with one hand, revealing a thick stack of silk cloth inside, clearly covered in detailed records. Puzzled, Li Jiangqian accepted it and began to read.

The young man scanned it, flipping through the stack once with one hand. He read straight to the bottom, then flipped back to the beginning, carefully rereading the section on the west bank. He laughed. "They’ve eaten the leopard's gall."

Li Xuanxuan’s heart tightened when he heard that. Li Xixuan and the others were, after all, mortals; they could not withstand Li Jiangqian's methods. The old man quickly grabbed his arm. "These people are still your elders. Many are highly respected, and many of their children sacrificed themselves for the clan. The island's affairs must be resolved, certainly, but you cannot allow people’s hearts to grow cold."

"I understand... I understand!" Li Jiangqian held the silk report in one hand. The long white cloth trailed down, dragging on the floor, stirring gently in the draft. He kept his head bowed toward the text and smiled. "Just leave this matter to me. I'll just have to trouble Uncle Zhouluo to manage the household for a few more months, just to quiet the chatter below."

Outside the hall.

Li Zhouluo exited the main hall, leaving it to the other two. He accompanied Li Chenghuai down. Only then did he remember another matter, and he relayed the news of the letter from Li Xizhi.

Li Zhouluo was clearly proud, his tone slightly agitated. Li Chenghuai’s expression, however, remained largely unchanged. He waited for the young man to finish, remaining silent for a long time before finally saying, "He has always been formidable."

The relationship between his father, Li Chenghuai, and his grandfather, Li Xizhi, was certainly not close. Li Zhouluo hesitated slightly, then continued, "Grandfather's meaning is that he wishes for me to travel to the Southern Sea before my Foundation Establishment. He wants to select a suitable Dao companion for me... and he wants me to make my breakthrough there, in the Southern Sea."

Li Chenghuai actually nodded at this. "That is naturally for the best. Marriage is a critical affair. Having him inspect the candidates for you is much better."

Li Zhouluo studied his father's expression, lowering his voice. "Grandfather also had his disciple, Quan Yuduan, bring a letter back. But at that time, Father was still in seclusion. He stated he must deliver it personally into Father’s hands. He returned a year ago and has been cultivating in the wilderness region. I just sent someone to retrieve him."

Wang Quwan and the others had gone north. Letters had arrived earlier saying they had entered the Earth Palace and encountered several other direct lineage disciples, but communications ceased half a year ago. Even Quan Yuduan could no longer contact those inside. Now, three years had passed with no sound from the Dao lineage of Xiaoshi Mountain in the north. They estimated there must be another grotto-heaven hidden below. Quan Yuduan, who had been acting as escort, couldn't wait idly. Unsure if he had even completed his sect mission, he spent the last two years wandering Jiangbei and had only recently returned to the wilderness.

At Li Zhouluo's mention that Li Xizhi had left a personal letter for him, Li Chenghuai finally showed anxiety. He paced the courtyard twice. Just as dawn broke, he saw Quan Yuduan, dressed in brilliant red robes, approaching at high speed under escort.

The young man wore a jade crown. He glanced at the Dharma robes, saw the black jade pendant at his waist, and recognized Li Chenghuai. Visibly excited, he bowed low before him, speaking respectfully. "Greetings, Young Master! Master and Mistress have missed you terribly these past years. They often speak of you... but ten thousand li separate you, preventing a meeting..."

Li Chenghuai awkwardly helped him rise. Quan Yuduan, having said his piece, retrieved a letter from his sleeve. "This letter is in the Master’s own hand," he said softly. "He instructed me that I must deliver it, that all others must be dismissed, and that the Young Master must open it personally."

Li Chenghuai felt the letter. It wasn't thick; it was, in fact, quite thin. It was only wrapped in spirit-cloth, not formally sealed. It was clearly a personal note. He glanced around. Li Zhouluo immediately took the hint, led the others out, and securely closed the hall doors.

Only then did Li Chenghuai raise his hands, break the simple seal, and withdraw the pure white paper. The elegant, flowing script of Li Xizhi met his eyes:

"Written by hand on the twentieth of the spring moon. Your father currently guards the Southern Sea. All affairs are stable. I am presently selecting a wife for my grandson.

If you harbor the ambition to pursue the profound, verify your Dao, and seek transcendent abilities, you may follow Yuduan south across the sea. Mysterious pills, wondrous medicines, Dharma artifacts, and spirit objects; blessed lands and immortal mountains—your father will exhaust his strength to provide you with everything.

If your heart desires only to shelter the clan and live out your remaining years in peace, I have instructed Yuduan to bring my Daoist collection of many years, silks and brocades, fine foods and jade wares. You may listen to the rain from the bridge, sufficient to shelter your descendants, ensuring three generations of honor and nobility.

Written by the hand of Father Zhi."

Li Chenghuai read every single word. Then he turned the letter over. Though he knew the back was blank, he scanned it up and down anyway, turning the paper over and over in his hands.

When Quan Yuduan received no reply, he waited a moment longer before speaking softly. "Reporting to the Young Master, the Master instructed me to bring his Daoist collection. It is anchored by a Purple Mansion Realm talisman, and includes Foundation Establishment Dharma artifacts, spirit objects, talismans, and treasure medicines—everything is included..."

He began rattling off a list of items, but Li Chenghuai seemed oblivious, as if just waking from a dream. He asked hoarsely, "Did he... did he have any other instructions?"

Quan Yuduan grew uneasy at his tone but only bowed respectfully. "Master... Master said that in former years, he could barely protect himself, much less look after the Young Master. He wishes to make amends now."
