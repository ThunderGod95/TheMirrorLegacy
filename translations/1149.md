# Chapter 1157: The Secret of the Sword Gate

Cheng Jiuwen, dressed in a simple Daoist robe, welcomed him at the entrance. His gaze lingered for a moment on the fading radiance of Bright Yang light that was slowly dissipating across the sky. He sighed inwardly. 'What a troubled time.'

---

Since the founding of the Great Song, the Sword Gate had always enjoyed a life of ease. Sword Intent itself held a unique status, transcending all other arts of cultivation. With deep foundations built upon years of accumulated strength and a long-held principle of worldly detachment, the Sword Gate's legacy was unmatched. In fact, among the entire Supreme Yang Daoist tradition of the Song kingdom, all the other sects combined could not compare to the Sword Gate alone.

But Cheng Jiuwen knew that this carefree existence was likely at its end.

Li Zhouwei paused on the mountain path, his eyes fixed on the great pine standing sentinel at the peak. He offered a slight bow.

"Greetings, Senior Heaven's Horn."

As the words left his lips, a gentle viridian light showered down from the pine's branches, and a warm, ancient voice echoed from the summit.

"Your Majesty is too kind. We are all family here."

Li Zhouwei's expression grew serious.

In his spiritual sense, the entire pine tree seemed to surge with life. A vast tide of divine power converged, its five 'Horn Wood' divine abilities already perfected. Ethereal threads of power reached out, communicating with the Great Void and soaring into the heavens.

'Just as I thought… this spirit cultivator perfected his divine abilities long ago. How long has it been? A hundred years? Three hundred? Five hundred?'

Li Zhouwei mused.

'Five arts brought to their absolute peak, and in the noble 'Horn Wood' path no less—the very symbol of growth within the Wood Virtue. A single one of his divine abilities could bring the dead back to life. If he could leave this sword peak, even though Horn Wood isn't suited for combat, he could still rout the entire host of northern cultivators single-handedly!'

When Li Ximing broke through to the Purple Mansion Realm, he had come here. Li Mei had told him then that the senior had not spoken in fifty years. But time flowed like water; more than fifty years had passed since Li Ximing's own breakthrough, meaning this ancient being had been silent for a full century.

'Then again...' he thought, 'with Li Mei emerging from seclusion, the Sword Gate is not only at its strongest in a century, but he must also face that immortal cultivator from Donghua Heaven. He can't remain in seclusion any longer.'

He simply offered another bow.

"Senior is too kind."

The great pine swayed, its needles rustling as they shed cascades of pure light. The light gathered before Li Zhouwei, illuminating his face. He felt a warm spring breeze wash over him, and the faint Heavenly Glow on his features vanished. The wound on his face, deep enough to reveal bone, healed in an instant, leaving not a single scar.

"Many thanks, Senior!"

Li Zhouwei said, bowing his head. His voice was firm and resonant, but his mind was reeling.

'Such incredible divine power!'

Li Zhouwei's physical body was unique, far from that of an ordinary Purple Mansion cultivator who could be easily mended. To heal his wounds, one needed a profound understanding of the Bright Yang Dao; anything less would be useless.

'Has this senior truly weathered so many ages that his attainments in the Bright Yang Dao are this high?' he wondered. 'Or is it that once the 'Horn Wood' divine ability is perfected, the art itself approaches the Dao, granting it the power to complete all other arts?'

---

Cheng Jiuwen had stood by respectfully the entire time, his head bowed. Seeing that Heaven's Horn offered no further reply, he finally gestured to a seat and quietly poured tea for King Wei.

"It's a rare honor to meet with you, Your Majesty," he said with a slight smile.

The young man in the dark robes stood tall and composed. Even with a great battle looming on the coast, not a trace of anxiety showed on his face.

"I must thank Senior Li Mei for granting me refuge all those years ago," he said.

Cheng Jiuwen shook his head.

"Your Majesty is too kind. Cheng Yan fell by your hand, which settles that karmic debt. As for the matter of sanctuary… whether my Martial Uncle had acted or not, I am certain you would have found a way to overcome the danger."

While the Daoist Master of the Sword Gate observed him, Li Zhouwei was taking his measure as well. The man had a long face and thick, severe eyebrows; there was nothing particularly remarkable about his appearance.

Among Purple Mansion cultivators, Cheng Jiuwen did not have a sterling reputation. For one, he was a loner who kept his distance from the other cultivators of the Supreme Yang Daoist tradition. For another, the moral schism within the Sword Gate was, in essence, a conflict over the future path of the entire lineagw. Nearly every cultivator sided with Li Mei, and they all knew that Cheng Jiuwen was the one backing the conservative elders, which did little to endear him to them.

Li Zhouwei shook his head.

"Facts are facts. The debt of gratitude remains."

Cheng Jiuwen fell silent for a moment. He understood that King Wei was waiting—waiting for his Martial Uncle, perhaps, or for the Grand General. They were at the heart of the storm, and the Sword Gate could not hope to escape it. Finally, he raised an eyebrow and offered a wry smile.

"Regarding the events in Ting Province, I should be the one congratulating you."

Li Zhouwei nodded.

"And I should see the Sword Tome."

Cheng Jiuwen sighed and bowed his head slightly in apology.

"I'm afraid Your Majesty will have to accompany me to Chenghua Hall for that. I have never managed to cultivate Sword Intent, and… I cannot even lift the Myriad Radiance Sword Tome!"

Li Zhouwei could see it clearly: this Daoist Master already possessed two divine abilities. His spirit was full, his qi overflowing, his aura deep and restrained. He was surely just a single step away from mastering his third.

'And yet, even he cannot lift it.'

Doubt bloomed in Li Zhouwei's mind. He rose and followed Cheng Jiuwen up a flight of green stone steps, soon arriving at the place all of Jiangnan's sword cultivators dreamed of: Chenghua Hall.

The hall was not as grand as he had imagined. Aside from the verdant green roof tiles, the entire structure was made of weathered wood, faded to uneven shades of grey. A few simple, round stools sat near the threshold. Stepping inside, he saw that the walls were covered in faded, colorful murals depicting scenes of slaying demons, vanquishing evil, and saving the common people. Rendered primarily in hues of cyan, black, and red, they exuded an air of ancient simplicity.

Cheng Jiuwen seemed lost in thought.

"Of the six lineages of Chongming—if we can still call it six—the Yue Cultivating Sect is the most widespread and, arguably, the most accomplished, having even produced a True Monarch. Yet the Sword Gate has never shone so brightly. Our own founder once lamented that among all the Chongming cultivators, he had the poorest grasp of the divine mysteries."

Li Zhouwei knew he was referring to Cheng Liuxing, the Myriad Radiance Sword Immortal and a disciple of that True Monarch.

Cheng Jiuwen lowered his eyes.

"It's no one's fault. Finding someone with supreme talent in the Way of the Sword who also possesses the aptitude for Dao cultivation is exceedingly rare."

He led Li Zhouwei deeper into the hall, where a tome bound in deep blue leather lay open on a pedestal. Its pages were a pale, creamy yellow, and the elegant characters on them were clear and bright.

"This is the sword intent of Daoist Master Xu Gui of Xuanzhou, from the Shu State." Cheng Jiuwen explained.

"He visited not long ago."

Li Zhouwei's gaze fell upon the characters. Above, in small, dark grey script, were two words:

【Repentance's End】

Below them, in a similar script:

【Awakened Pool】

And beside them, a dense block of tiny, fly-headed script read:

【The Sword of True Nature, Born from Great Repentance's First Awakening】.

Li Zhouwei had heard that a new Sword Immortal had appeared in Shu, known only as Daoist Master Xu; now he knew the man's full title. He nodded silently as Cheng Jiuwen picked up a jade rod as thin as a chopstick, infused it with his divine ability, and carefully used it to nudge the page.

He turned several pages before new words finally lit up on the tome:

【Falling Cassia】

【Azure Homeland】

Li Zhouwei shifted his gaze to the line of text beneath them:

【Azure Moon's Homecoming: The Sword of Ten Thousand Assembled Scales】!

He committed the name to memory, his golden eyes glinting.

"I have a question for you, senior," he said softly. "When exactly did the name of this Sword Intent appear in the tome?"

Li Zhouwei had come not only for himself but to lay the groundwork for Li Jiangchun's Sword Intent. Cheng Jiuwen looked surprised for a moment, but quickly recovered.

"When the young disciple from your clan arrived at the capital, he had an audience with the Emperor and performed a sword dance in the palace. The name appeared in the tome at that very moment."

A subtle wave of relief passed through Li Zhouwei.

"So it wasn't when he was on the lake?" he pressed.

Cheng Jiuwen lowered his eyes.

"Our predecessors learned from experience that the Sword Tome is blind to anything that occurs within a mystic realm or a grotto-heaven. Otherwise, it must be obscured by some great dharma power or divine ability. Although this book was written by a True Monarch, it is not a Dharma Treasure. And even if it were, there are places in this world beyond the reach of any Dharma Treasure…"

'If that's the case, then concealing it will be easy,' Li Zhouwei thought, his heart settling.

'As long as the Sword Intent is manifested on the lake—or better yet, within a grotto-heaven of my own making—the Sword Tome will never know…'

He smiled and nodded, but his eyes were fixed on the jade rod in Cheng Jiuwen's hand.

"My grand-uncle once told me this Sword Tome is a peculiar thing," he said in a low voice. "A mortal with Sword Intent can lift it with ease, but a Purple Mansion cultivator without it can barely move it. He said that back then, it was Senior Li Mei who retrieved it for him."

Though his words were simple, their implication was clear. When Li Ximing had visited the Sword Gate, Daoist Master Li Mei had personally fetched the tome and flipped through its pages without the slightest hint of difficulty. At the time, Li Ximing had simply assumed Li Mei's divine abilities were so powerful that he could ignore the tome's weight. But now, seeing Cheng Jiuwen—a master on the verge of his third divine ability—needing a Spiritual Artifact just to slowly turn one page at a time, how could he not be suspicious?

King Wei narrowed his eyes, a long-held doubt resurfacing.

'When the Sword Immortal King visited the lake, he mentioned four Sword Immortals in Jiangnan: True Monarch Shangyuan from that era, the old Sword Immortal of the Great Xiukui Monastery, and the Tomb-Seizing Sword Immortal of Qize… There should have been one more.'

---

Cheng Jiuwen heard the suspicion in his voice. After a long silence, he finally answered, his voice trembling.

"I will not hide the truth from you, Your Majesty. This matter… is the greatest tragedy of my Sword Gate."

The Daoist Master's voice was barely a whisper.

"My Martial Uncle… his name isn't Li Mei. He was born Cheng Xunzhi. He is a child of my Cheng clan—from the direct line."

"In the Way of the Sword, his talent was peerless. He grasped sword qi at the age of ten. My own martial grand-master doted on him, and the treasure he wielded was the heirloom, 'White Pear.' He comprehended the 'Controlling Bitterness' Sword Intent—'The Sword of Pure Yang Qi, Establishing Yang and Controlling Bitterness'—while still in the Foundation Establishment Realm!"

"As for his cultivation, he attained the Dao through the notoriously difficult 'Sovereign of Dui Edge' path. He mastered 'Unending Edge' and 'Palace of Retracted Killing' in less than a century. Before he was even three hundred years old, he was already on the verge of comprehending the Purple Mystery."

Cheng Jiuwen's voice was filled with a mixture of pride and sorrow.

"To be blunt, he was the greatest genius the Sword Gate has seen in centuries. His talent for both swordsmanship and cultivation surpassed even some of the Founder's own disciples. In the last thousand years, you could count on one hand the number of people who could have stood as his equal."

A shadow crossed his face.

"The Dui Metal path, while orthodox, suffers from interference when it mixes with Geng Metal. Of the remaining two divine abilities on that path, both are Life Divine Abilities. One is sealed by the Golden Oneness and forbidden to junior cultivators. But the final one… our Sword Gate possessed it."

His voice cracked.

"It was I who burdened him with sect affairs. It was Senior Heaven's Horn who met his questions with silence. He should have broken through to the Purple Mystery realm long ago… We were the ones who hid the sect's fourth divine ability from him!"

"He cannot be allowed to cultivate a Life Divine Ability!"

An icy chill crept into Li Zhouwei's expression.

"Why?" he asked, his voice low.

A look of anguish twisted Cheng Jiuwen's features.

"Years ago, a Daoist Master of our sect passed away. Though our Martial Grand-master had surpassed the Purple Mystery, he was nursing old injuries. My Martial Uncle was the pillar of our sect; we should have protected him. But we had a tradition… that disciples must descend the mountain to temper their character. He was sent to guard an island out at sea…"

"At the time, the Way of Great Desire and the Chunyi Dao Gate were fighting over a mystic realm. Tian Langzhi—the Maha of the Way of Great Desire—came south himself to confront Senior Yuanshang. But during the chaos, a stray beam of Buddhist light was diverted and struck the island."

Li Zhouwei frowned. He listened as Cheng Jiuwen, his eyes now red, walked slowly out of the hall.

"My Martial Uncle had attained Sword Intent at a young age," Cheng Jiuwen said, his voice thick with rage, "but only my master and grand-master knew of it. I don't know how that Maha from the Way of Great Desire divined it, but he hadn't come just to threaten the Chunyi Dao Gate. He came to destroy my uncle."

"That Buddhist light… it drives men mad. When Senior Yuanshang arrived, he found an island of our disciples, all slain by a single sword to the throat, and my Martial Uncle, raving like a demon. And Tian Langzhi—that shameless bastard—was preparing to forcibly convert my uncle and take him to the north!"

"Daoist Master Yuanshang fought with everything he had. When Tian Langzhi saw he could not capture my uncle, his intentions turned murderous. Daoist Master Yuanshang had to use several priceless spiritual treasures just to save him… but by the time he brought him back to the mountain, it was too late. His body was ravaged, yes, but far worse… his wife and child had been on that island. They died by his hand. Though his life was saved, his Dao heart was shattered."

By now, Cheng Jiuwen was standing beneath the massive, sky-blotting pine, tears streaming down his face as his lips trembled.

"He swore an oath to kill Tian Langzhi, but from that day on, he could no longer meditate without waking in terror. He couldn't even summon his Sword Intent. Master and Grand-master both knew that the Purple Mansion Realm was lost to him forever. With a Dao heart in that state, attempting a breakthrough would mean certain death."

Li Zhouwei was beginning to understand.

"And so," Cheng Jiuwen continued, his eyes downcast, "Grand-master begged Senior Heaven's Horn for help. He used a spiritual branch from the Profound Horn Treasured Tassel Pine itself to heal his physical wounds. Then, he requested the aid of Daoist Master Shang Miao and her disciple from the Yue Cultivating Sect. Using their sect's most powerful treasure, they erased that entire period from his memory."

He clenched his fists, finally revealing the Sword Gate's most painful secret.

"Changing his name to Li Mei was part of the deception. Erasing memories is not usually enough to bypass the boundless illusions one faces during a breakthrough. So they essentially remade his body, a process akin to reincarnation. He took Senior Heaven's Horn's surname, Li, relying on the profound amnesia of rebirth to bury the trauma deep within him…"

"But what can fool the illusions of a breakthrough cannot fool a Life Divine Ability! The divine ability he needs is called 'Mutual Oblivion,' also known as 'Position Follows Trust.' It aligns with the Mandate of Heaven, allowing one to make the people forget their toil and even death. If it can do that to others, imagine its effect on the self! Once that power becomes part of his very being, the truth will inevitably be unlocked!"

"And the method for that divine ability, the 'Trust in Heaven's Way Art,' is held by Senior Heaven's Horn!"

Li Zhouwei's gaze wavered as he listened to the Daoist Master's sobbing confession.

"That is why… that is why Senior Heaven's Horn has not dared to answer him for fifty years! It is why I have delayed finding a cultivation method for him, why I bury myself in seclusion year after year while he handles all worldly affairs! I was hoping to slow his cultivation, hoping he would never reach this point!"

His voice was choked with despair.

"But he was only delayed before the Purple Mystery for sixty years before breaking through effortlessly. This day was inevitable. My Martial Uncle sensed something was wrong. When he could not obtain a Dui Metal method, he found another path! And I've heard that this Geng Metal path… it, too, leads to a Life Divine Ability!"

The Daoist Master of the Cheng clan let out a ragged sigh.

"Everyone says that my Martial Uncle champions engagement with the world while I champion seclusion. They say I use the elders to oppose him… but how can they understand? Engagement, seclusion… do people like us truly have any say in the matter?! The world outside slanders the Cheng clan, and I'm seen as a stubborn hypocrite, a relic of the past. I, Cheng Jiuwen, do not care about such rumors. But a swordsman seeks only a clear and tranquil sword heart, and a Sword Immortal needs it more than anyone. If he regains his memories… how could he possibly bear it? He would march to the Way of Great Desire and demand a reckoning!"

The normally stoic man's face was ashen, his eyes filled with torment.

"You all see this as a great and joyous occasion for the Sword Gate. But the truth is… the truth is that I, Cheng Jiuwen, have dreaded the coming of this day more than anyone else in the world!"
