# Chapter 250: Reencountering Lingyanzi

Li Tongya thought the man's face was familiar, but could not immediately figure out where he had seen him before. Raising his eyebrows slightly, he set down his jade cup and spoke in a low voice, "I am naturally reclusive and not fond of many words. However, I find your face quite familiar... Where might I have seen you before?"

The cultivator, clothed in animal leather with long eyebrows and tanned skin, carrying a short bow on his back and a string of yellow gourds hanging at his waist, simply cupped his fist respectfully.

"I am Lingu Lie from Jiachuan Prefecture under the governance of the Azure Pond! I once sold you a few Wuzha Worms at the base of Cloud Crowned Peak. I was much younger then, and my appearance has changed considerably since. It's no wonder you do not recognize me now," he said with a smile.

"Ah, it's you!" Li Tongya exclaimed as realization dawned on him. Back then, this man had just been a boy with a timid appearance, easily outmatched by Li Tongya in their negotiations. Now, he appeared middle-aged and seemed to have experienced a lot in life.

"Your Wuzha Worms were indeed excellent, and they once helped me out," Li Tongya said, nodding approvingly in response.

He gestured for the man to sit at the other end of the table. Lingu Lie happily accepted, cupping his fist respectfully and then taking his seat somewhat awkwardly. His face showed admiration as he spoke.

"Senior's cultivation has truly been swift! In just over thirty years, you have already established your immortal foundation. I must admit that I'm envious!"

Li Tongya chuckled and nodded humbly. He had bought various items at the market on Cloud Crowned Peak, where this Lingu Lie was just one of his many encounters, including the Xu Yangping couple who ultimately died in the snake cave at the hands of Zhang Yun.

Remembering Zhang Yun brought to mind that audacious young man, a core disciple of the Golden Feather Sectâ€”one of the three major sects. He must have successfully broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and mastered many of Golden Feather's secret techniques by now.

Back when Li Tongya was still in the Qi Cultivation Realm, he could compete with him using a sword technique left by Li Chejing, but now he doubted he was any match for him.

Bringing his attention back to the present, Li Tongya looked at the reserved middle-aged man and inquired, "Your Wuzha Worms are indeed good, but they breed too slowly. When my family was still at the Embryonic Breathing Realm, they were helpful... But over thirty years, only a few have been born. The original few eat more but breed less, making them somewhat of a white elephant."

Lingu Lie paused, his mouth opening as if searching for words.

"The Wuzha Worm's queen is in my family's possession. You received only the offspring, which may produce one or two offspring every decade or so when influenced by spiritual qi. However, large-scale reproduction is not possible..." he said hesitantly.

"Oh? My apologies!" Li Tongya swiftly apologized for causing Lingu Lie some obvious discomfort. While he had suspected this might be the case, he hadn't expected Wuzha Worms to be the Lingu Family's livelihood.

Li Tongya then spoke seriously, "I wonder if you could sell a few more to my family... They are quite useful."

"That should be no problem at all!" Lingu Lie replied as he cupped his fist and untied a wooden gourd from his waist, adding, "I do not have live larvae right now, but I do have these forty eggs in the gourd. If you wish, you may have them for ten Spirit Stones. Consider it a discount from me."

Now that he was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Li Tongya noticed that Lingu Lie's demeanor was much humbler, even offering a price lower than before.

Li Tongya nodded and asked, "How should they be hatched?"

"Cover them with damp Spirit Paddies' leaves or straws, and change them every three days. Make sure to keep them away from light and fire, and sprinkle clean water daily. They should hatch within fifteen days," Lingu Lie explained.

He cupped his fist, guaranteeing, "These Wuzha Worms are very resilient and easy to raise. If hatching fails, bring the dead larvae to the Lingu Family, and I will replace them for you."

Lingu Lie was no fool. While he guaranteed the quality of his product, he insisted on seeing the carcass of any dead worms as evidence, thus preventing people from hiding the eggs to make a profit.

Li Tongya nodded and handed over ten Spirit Stones with ease, which seemed to make Lingu Lie very happy. For an ordinary Qi Cultivation Realm rogue cultivator, ten Spirit Stones were their valuable liquid assets, and even a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator would not give them away so readily.

Li Tongya could afford this because he had the support of his family, which allowed him to still have funds even after buying a gift from Fei Luoya with two hundred Spirit Stones.

Taking the gourd, Li Tongya asked, "So, your family is skilled in raising insects and snakes...? Could you enlighten me a bit more on the matter? There'll be many opportunities for cooperation in the future."

"Certainly!" Lingu Lie nodded repeatedly and responded respectfully, "My family is also a prominent clan in Jiachuan Prefecture, and our ancestors were great cultivators from the Mount Yue tribe. Later, when the Azure Pond Sect expanded south, our ancestors joined the sect. They were diligent and left behind many connections, which is why we have been able to remain a major clan in Jiachuan Prefecture for hundreds of years."

Li Tongya nodded, this explanation having resolved a curiosity in his mind, and thought to himself, No wonder I've never heard of the surname Lingu! It turns out they were from Mount Yue... It's no wonder then.

Noticing Lingu Lie's hairy skin and dark eyes, which were typical of the Mount Yue appearance, he showed his pearly whites when he spoke and said solemnly, "Although my family descends from Mount Yue, we are still cultivators of the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Dao. We have merely inherited the ancestral techniques of insects and snakes, and are considered among the top in Yue State."

Lingu Lie looked proud as he continued, "There are also rules in our family. Each lineage must travel the world, collecting various types of poisonous snakes and insects. Thus, my uncle and I have spent decades traveling through Mushroom Forest Plain and Lixia Prefecture... which is how I came to meet you."

"Ah, a prominent clan! No wonder you speak so eloquently and act so measuredly... You have quite a presence," Li Tongya complimented, cupping his fist, to which Lingu Lie laughed heartily.

Li Tongya then asked, "Are there many such enduring great clans in the Azure Pond Sect?"

"Not many," Lingu Lie replied honestly.

Having come from such a family, he naturally knew of many secrets and explained, "The Azure Pond rose from the north, producing several peak Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters, who consolidated the forces of the south into thirty-six peaks. Hence, the north has many small scattered families, while the south has more prominent clans, shamanic temples, and rogue cultivators. These clans are deeply entwined with the Azure Pond Sect, moving together, standing for hundreds of years without falling."

"Oh," Li Tongya mulled over this information in his mind and quickly understood the intentions of the Azure Pond Sect. The south was full of Mount Yue tribes and shamanic curses, preferring tribes over clans. By absorbing these people and ceding some power, the Azure Pond Sect easily controlled the entirety of the south territory.

The Li Family was also employing this strategy in Eastern Mount Yue, although it was just beginning. Shamoli might be compliant, but he still harbored his own ambitions.

In a few decades, when descendants bearing Li Family's blood took power, they would naturally be deeply loyal. By also involving members of the Li Family from the maternal side to help govern Eastern Mount Yue, this area would effectively become a securely controlled territory, deeply integrated with the Li Family's influence.

Coming back to his senses, Li Tongya nodded lightly and transmitted his voice using his mana, "If you ever pass by Moongaze Lake, feel free to rest at Mount Lijing. You are most welcome there."

Lingu Lie's face lit up with joy. Although he was a scion of a prominent clan, having been stationed abroad for many decades left him isolated and far from the political center of his family.

Now, having the opportunity to connect with a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator greatly delighted him, and he thanked Li Tongya profusely.

Li Tongya picked up his cup and sipped his drink silently for several moments.

Understanding this cue, Lingu Lie cupped his fist and bade him farewell. As Li Tongya turned to observe the other cultivators at the gathering, he noticed they had already heatedly argued to the point of embarrassment.

He chuckled lightly, put down his cup, and almost immediately, the arguing cultivators quieted down and took their seats obediently, resuming their conversations in hushed tones.

While Li Tongya had been conversing with Lingu Lie, he kept an eye on the Daoist Masters on the platform. The sword-bearing Daoist Master Shangyuan merely raised his cup and then disappeared from his seat. The Yue Cultivating Sect was represented only by him, and with his departure, his seat was left conspicuously empty.

Once Daoist Master Shangyuan had left, the other Daoist Masters drank a couple of cups as a formality and then departed using their spells. Only two, who seemed to be from the Purple Mansion Realm immortal clans, stayed a bit longer to chat with Xiao Chuting before they too made their exit.

Xiao Chuting then vanished from sight, leaving the disciples of the three sects and seven gates feeling more at ease. Most left directly, while the rest engaged in lively discussions or sword sparring.

Li Tongya paid special attention to Lingyanzi, who had not stopped eating since he had sat down and was constantly stuffing his mouth, smacking his lips without engaging in conversation with those next to him. When he had cleared everything in front of him, he looked wistfully at his neighbor's table.

A cultivator from the Purple Smoke Gate bluntly interrupted his actions, and Lingyanzi, embarrassed, could only sit there awkwardly and drink his wine, appearing quite lonely.

"Lingyanzi does not seem to be doing so well in the Purple Smoke Gate... looks like he is having a tough time," Li Tongya observed, shaking his head and doubting whether Lingyanzi still had a hundred Spirit Stones in his storage pouch.

After waiting a bit longer, Lingyanzi finally couldn't sit still and took to the skies. Li Tongya quickly followed. Just outside the formation, Lingyanzi, quick as a whip, turned around and asked sternly, "Who dares to tail me?"

Li Tongya revealed himself with a light laugh, replying, "Senior Lingyanzi, it has been many years since we last met... Do you still remember me? I'm rouge cultivator Wan."

"You..."

Lingyanzi's expression shifted dramatically as he uttered that single word, quickly swallowing the rest of his sentence. He had lived over a hundred years and instantly understood that Li Tongya didn't want to leave any trace of their past dealings, which was why he referred to himself as rogue cultivator Wan.

He thought to himself with awe, Li Tongya is really damn cautious!

Lingyanzi managed a bitter smile and said, "It has been many years, Brother Wan."

"Would you honor me by sharing a couple of drinks?" Li Tongya asked warmly, and Lingyanzi could only nod. He followed Li Tongya back into the gathering reluctantly, where they found a spot at the less prestigious end of the hall.

It was then that Lingyanzi suddenly realized something and exclaimed, "You have reached the Foundation Establishment Realm?!"

Li Tongya nodded. Lingyanzi gasped in astonishment and said in a low voice, "Congratulations, Brother Wan!"

Lingyanzi was also a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator now. Li Tongya acknowledged him with a smile and said, "Congratulations to us both! By the way, I have been eagerly awaiting news from you, Senior."

Lingyanzi felt extremely awkward and let out a dry laugh, then explained quietly, "Those spoils of war, I turned them all into Spirit Stones. However, when I saw that I was on the verge of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, I could not resist spending them all on spirit medicines to attempt the breakthrough... To fail in returning this life-saving favor is truly... hard to express!"

"Oh." Li Tongya nodded, understanding Lingyanzi's actions. Hardly anyone could resist such a temptation. If it had been him, Li Tongya, in such a situation, he would have used the Spirit Stones for his breakthrough without hesitation, thinking about compensating for them only after he succeeded with the breakthrough.

He said gently, "Senior need not worry. Being in such a position, I would have chosen to make the breakthrough too... It's a natural human reaction."

Lingyanzi sighed softly, his eyes slightly moist with a touch of emotion. He responded, "Brother Wan understands human nature so well... Lingyanzi admires you!"

After taking a slow sip of wine, he continued, "Over the years, I have lived frugally, managing the expenses of my peak while maintaining my own cultivation. I've saved up the rest and I-I..."

He pulled out the dharma sword from his waist, its surface gleaming with light, and placed it on the table with earnest intent.

"Until now, I still use this sword of the Qi Cultivation Realm to save up Spirit Stones for Brother Wan."

Li Tongya nodded, acknowledging Lingyanzi's effort and reflecting inwardly with a mix of amusement and bitterness.

This is what defines the three sects and seven gates... The Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators in my Li Family still use mundane tools, while only those in the Qi Cultivation Realm can use Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts. As the only Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in my family, aside from the Qingche Sword I carry, I still use Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts... Yet to Lingyanzi, the struggle of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator using Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts seems a significant hardship.

Seeing Lingyanzi's tearful look, Li Tongya could empathize with his feeling of injustice, although he could not relate to such a privileged hardship. He showed just the right amount of compassion and said seriously, "Senior, there is no need to rush. You can hand me those Spirit Stones whenever; there is no need to be so hard on yourself."

Lingyanzi nodded deeply, visibly touched, and wiped his aged face. "My cultivation technique is unique; I often need to consume spirit wine and food to avoid dry mouth and stagnation in my cultivation. In severe cases, I could experience a Qi Deviation, leading to a regression in my skills. If it were not for this difficult condition, I would not have to struggle day by day..." he shared, a vulnerable expression crossing his face.

"Such a cultivation technique exists...?" Li Tongya asked, taken aback, secretly marveling that only the likes of the three sects and seven gates could afford such a demanding practice.

Looking at the sad look on Lingyanzi's face, Li Tongya finally understood why he had been so unpopular at the Purple Smoke Gate. He gave an awkward smile and asked, "How many Spirit Stones have you managed to save up over these years, Senior?"

At this, Lingyanzi looked down, his demeanor like that of a chastened child. "Twenty Spirit Stones..." he finally confessed awkwardly.

Li Tongya was momentarily speechless but wasn't ready to let Lingyanzi off so easily. He raised his hand without any reservation and took the reluctantly offered Spirit Stones, saying softly, "How about this... Do you have any items of equivalent value that you could trade for these stones, so you do not have to save up year after year?"

"This..." Lingyanzi seemed tempted by such an offer, pondering for a few moments before taking off his storage pouch and pouring out a collection of items. He then stated, "Aside from the secret techniques of my gate and the legacy treasure of my peakâ€”the Purple Smoke Spirit Shield... feel free to pick anything, Brother Wan!"
