# Chapter 160: The Secret of the Purple Thunder

"I'm Li Tongya from the Li Family of Lijing!"

Following Li Tongya's introduction, Lingyanzi also introduced himself, "Lingyanzi from the Purple Gale Peak of the Purple Smoke Gate!"

Finally, Lingyanzi reached Mount Lijing and entered the courtyard where he was warmly greeted by Li Xuanling with a polite smile.

"Greetings, Senior!"

Lingyanzi nodded politely but was taken aback when Li Xuanling responded.

"I've already gathered all the clan members, they are eagerly awaiting to witness Senior's profound techniques!"

Lingyanzi was momentarily speechless, recalling his hasty promises of techniques and spirit items during his escape.

Li Tongya and Li Xuanfeng could not help but smirk internally, rejoicing with the outcome of the situation in their hearts.

Even so, Li Xuanfeng said sternly, "Ling'er, show some respect! Senior Lingyanzi is a skillful cultivator from one of the three sects and seven gates; you need not worry about him going back on his word."

Lingyanzi sighed deeply and said with a bitter smile, "Come now, I'm no skillful cultivator from the three sects and seven gates. Not only have I embarrassed myself in front of you all, but tens of thousands of mortals at the foot of the mountain also saw me being hunted down and fleeing in such a sorry state... I'm just an ordinary man, afraid of death and desperately clinging to life!"

After sipping his tea and carefully savoring it, Lingyanzi continued calmly, "Regardless... I survived. Those two from Changxiao Gate, on the other hand, died by my hands. You have no idea how good it feels to be alive!"

He paused suddenly as if drawing in a deep breath of the spiritual qi from the mountains after having narrowly escaped death. Then in a cheerful tone, he said, "It beats any other feeling in the world!"

His words made Li Tongya hold him in high regard, while the younger members of the Li Family from the Xuan generation paused to reflect.

Lingyanzi laughed and continued, "The abilities I wield come from my gate, and I've sworn a Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath... so I can't share them with you. My Spirit Stones and medicinal pills were used up on the way here, and most of the techniques and scriptures I possess are from my travels and wouldn't be of much use to you. However, I do have one secret technique called Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique, a standout even among Grade Three techniques and is quite valuable. What do you think, Brother Tongya?"

"Please, do tell us more about it!" Li Tongya urged after Lingyanzi finally broached this topic and listened intently.

"This technique originally came from the ancient Thundercloud Temple, a Grade Four technique that used to involve consuming Purple Gold Thunder Liquid to achieve Qi Cultivation Realm... The Dao foundation formed during the Foundation Establishment Realm was known as Winter Thunderclap. However, after Thundercloud Temple was destroyed and Purple Gold Thunder Liquid disappeared, it was modified to be used with Profound Yin Thunder Liquid instead; thus degrading it to a Grade Three technique. The resulting Dao foundation is known as Profound Thunderpool, but it's still much better than ordinary Grade Three techniques," Lingyanzi explained patiently in great detail.

"Oh? Since it's a secret technique, it must have some side effects right?" Li Tongya asked, a frown appearing.

"Very minor... Just infertility and a few years off one's lifespan," Lingyanzi answered.

Li Tongya's interest visibly faded upon hearing this. For a sect, such consequences might be acceptable, but it was not ideal as a family technique as infertility would compromise the very foundation of the Li Family.

Seeing Li Tongya's reaction, Lingyanzi quickly added, "There's more! I also have the method for gathering Profound Yin Thunder Liquid, which I can also share with you."

Noticing the embarrassed look on Lingyanzi's face, Li Tongya merely nodded and said in resignation, "Thank you, Senior."

"As for these pouches..." Lingyanzi nodded, lifting the two plain pouches from the disciples of the Changxiao Gate. "These pouches can resonate with the techniques of the Changxiao Gate members, so they shouldn't be opened. Keeping them within your family would only invite trouble... It's better if I take them. Next year, I will send someone to exchange the items inside these pouches for Spirit Stones and have them delivered to you."

Li Tongya did not trust him entirely but realized that he had no other choice. He decided to give in, hoping to leverage this favor in the future.

"Please take them with you then, Senior," he conceded with a nod.
ùòßùò≥ùò¶‚ÑØùìåùò¶ùí∑ùòØùëúùë£ùò¶ùìÅ.ùí∏ùò∞ùìÇ

Lingyanzi then took with him the storage pouches. The Changxiao Gates cultivators' dharma swords and flying shuttles naturally fell into the Li Family's possession.

Those two dharma swords were even better than Li Tongya's, yet he dared not use them. The flying shuttles, though ordinary, were a welcome addition to the Li Family.

Since Spirit Stones were important resources to be spent wisely, the Li Family never bought any flying shuttles. Now that they had received two of them, they hesitated to use them, hence Li Tongya planned to sell them all in the future.

After talking for a bit longer, Lingyanzi recuperated on Mount Lijing for a while before bidding farewell and flew back on his flying shuttle to report back on his mission.

With peace returning to Mount Lijing once again, Li Xuanfeng and Li Tongya went into seclusion, while the rest busied themselves with their own tasks.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

In Lixia Prefecture, the bustling streets were filled with all kinds of people. On both sides of the streets, numerous small vendors pushed their carts along, selling cakes and porridge.

The crowd moved deeper into the streets where the alleyways became quieter and less populated.

In one such alley, a large courtyard paved with green stones appeared even more serene. Verdant vines wrapped around the wooden sticks supporting two rows of drying clothes, gently swaying in the glow of the setting sun.

"Mommy!"

The crisp voice of a boy broke through the silence.

Jiang Yunu looked up at the boy. Her face which was once round and cute had now slimmed down considerably.

"Yu'er," she responded to the boy, who was dressed in simple clothes. Although they were not anything fancy, they were clean and well-washed.

The boy looked at her with round and gleaming eyes, saying, "Mommy, a beggar came asking us for coins."

Jiang Yunu raised an eyebrow at him but pulled out two copper coins from her chest pocket with a smile, then handed them to him.

"Go on... but be careful," she instructed softly.

"Got it!"

Watching the boy head out clumsily, Jiang Yunu felt a wave of concern and quickly followed him.

She gritted her teeth while murmuring, "It's been five whole years... Has that bastard become addicted to seclusion, or has he been killed in a duel with someone? Not a single word from him in five years... If I wasn't pregnant with Yuanyu before he left, these five years would have driven me insane..."

Approaching the entrance of the courtyard, she saw that the beggar was a middle-aged man with perfectly working limbs and a rosy face. Yet, he shamelessly lay on the ground feigning pain while little innocent Yuanyu tried to comfort him.

Fearing the man might be a kidnapper, she called out hurriedly with a worry-stricken voice.

"Yu'er! Come back here!"

Li Yuanyu looked back at her and approached his mother cheerfully.

"Mommy, this man is so strange! He didn't take my money but thanked me and told me to move away... He even gave me this large, round copper coin!"

He then produced a flat copper coin which was dark gray in color, bearing four ancient characters indecipherable to them. Jiang Yunu paid it little mind but kept her eyes on the beggar.

"There are bad people in the prefecture who kidnap children, so you need to be careful."

After advising him, Jiang Yunu scooped her son up into her arms and headed back into the house.

"Would you like to go to your teacher's place this afternoon to learn some writing?" she asked softly.

"Yes," Li Yuanyu answered in a childish voice, and as the mother and son stepped into their yard, the splendid morning sun suddenly dimmed.

Thick clouds swiftly covered the sky from the east. Several faint silhouettes stood in the sky above Lixia Prefecture, occasionally letting out loud laughter. They looked down on the mortals below as if they were mere delicacies on a plate.




# Chapter 161: The Massacre

Situ You stood on his large flying shuttle, his heart mixed with bitterness and joy. Below, the bustling crowds of Lixia Prefecture looked up at them, causing him discomfort and agitation.

Just like decades ago, when the Golden Tang Gate invaded Azure Pond to slaughter mortals for crafting artifacts, Situ You did not revel in the invasion as his clan brothers had back then.

He understood that this was not a deal but a demand from Azure Pond Sect, marking this mission as perilously risky. And quite frankly, that was why the gate had chosen him‚Äîthe least valued among the illegitimate descendants of the Embryonic Breathing Realm‚Äîfor this task.

The Golden Tang Gate might sound prestigious, but it was essentially controlled by the Situ Family. As cultivators reached for higher realms, their offspring were more likely to be born with a spiritual orifice, inevitably leading the sect to be dominated by a single family like the Azure Pond Sect by the Chi Family, and Golden Feather Sect by the Zhang Family. Outsiders who joined the sect would eventually be serving these families.

With the Golden Tang Gate losing its pillar after the death of a middle-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, Situ You's branch, which had marital ties with the Azure Pond Sect, naturally ascended to power.

His clan brother, Situ Yi, who had slaughtered thousands had met a grim fate, leaving Situ You wary of the deep waters surrounding invasions. He was aware that any involvement likely spelled doom. Thus, with complex feelings, he embarked on this mission.

Now a vassal to Azure Pond Sect, the Situ Family was ordered to attack the five prefectures of Azure Pond.

Situ You, unclear on why the Azure Pond Sect suddenly began slaughtering its own subjects, obediently led his team southward.

"How ridiculous! I'm only an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator, yet they expect me to lead a few Qi Cultivators to plunder Lixia Prefecture which is guarded by a Foundation Establishment Clan..."

Situ You's mind was a whirlwind of thoughts until a realization hit him.

"I see... I get it now! It seems a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in the Azure Pond Sect is nearing death... Azure Pond Sect is in fear!"

"Brother!"

A Qi Cultivator called out to Situ You, snapping him back to reality. He hastily summoned his blood-red long saber, a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact with the blood of over a hundred thousand mortals on it.

After this sacrifice, its kill count might even rival the top-ranked dharma artifacts of the Azure Pond Sect.
ùòßùìá‚ÑØ‚ÑØùë§‚ÑØùò£ùìÉ‚Ñ¥ùìãùëíùëô.ùëêùò∞ùëö

Activating the saber, Situ You unleashed a torrent of blood-red saber light. Thousands of blood lights danced in the air, seemingly sentient as they swooped down toward the mortals of Lixia Prefecture like birds, signaling the beginning of the massacre.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

"Clan Uncle!" Xiao Ruyu cried out as he approached Xiao Yongling with urgency.

"We must act quickly! Lixia Prefecture is home to tens of thousands of mortals and thousands of our Xiao Family's common descendants... The attackers are but a dozen Qi Cultivators; we cannot let them proceed with this slaughter!"

"Wait a bit longer," Xiao Yongling replied as he shook his head, coldly observing the silhouettes of the Qi Cultivators in the sky above them.

"It's not so simple... Azure Pond Sect‚Äôs people must be watching from the sidelines. This is a trap to lure our Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators into action, aiming for a complete encirclement trap and consequent massacre! Chi Wei won't live much longer... and we cannot ruin the grand plan of our ancestor!"

Xiao Ruyu's expression stiffened when he heard this.

"We‚Äôre talking about the lives of a few hundred thousand mortals who have served the Xiao Family for generations! How can we... How can we just ignore them and let Golden Tang Gate turn them into dharma artifacts?!"

His voice was hard, pained.

"I‚Äôm well aware of that!" Xiao Yongling said as he appeared somewhat irate, raising his voice at his junior. Gritting his teeth, he continued, "But our Xiao Family has been biding its time for over three hundred years! We finally have a prodigious talent like Chuting, our ancestor, who broke the alliance of the three families and took control of the entire Lixia Prefecture... Now, with just a decade or so away from breaking free from Azure Pond Sect and establishing ourselves as a Purple Mansion immortal clan, how can we afford to act rashly?"

Xiao Yongling kept talking, almost as if trying to convince himself.

"Do you not fear that Chi Wei may be just waiting at the mountain gate, ready to seize us the moment we act impulsively, forcing our ancestor to intervene and ultimately leading to the annihilation of our hard-earned Purple Mansion Realm cultivator? In the end, not only would the mortals be sacrificed, but our Xiao Family could also be destroyed!"

Xiao Ruyu remained silent, not uttering a word. Xiao Yongling gave him a stern look and continued harshly, "As soon as Chi Wei dies, the Azure Pond Sect will no longer have the power to besiege our ancestor. Everything will be worth it! To establish our own territory... and perhaps, in a few decades, take over Milin Prefecture at Moongaze Lake! With the lake and Mount Dali at our back, our Xiao Family will have no more worries..."

Xiao Ruyu never spoke another word. Together with Xiao Yongling, they witnessed the horrific scene below the mountain. It was hell on earth, with screams and cries of anguish echoing outside the formation.

Xiao Ruyu's teeth clattered in anger. It was not a while until he spoke again, his voice filled with anguish and grief.

"I have always despised the Golden Tang Gate and Azure Pond Sect for their despicable acts... but now, looking at our Xiao Family, we're not any better!"

Xiao Yongling was slightly shaken by these words, his expression complex as he looked at him and said softly, "If you're seeking purity, the only place you might find it is in tales and stories... Perhaps you'll find one or two there. Do not be deceived by the dazzling sun; there's nothing truly pure in this world!"

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Xuanfeng emerged from his cave dwelling, the Golden Age longbow in his hand shimmering under the sun.

Greeted by Li Xuanxuan, Li Xuanfeng laughed heartily.

"It seems like you‚Äôve been cultivating hard during my five years of seclusion! You're nearing the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm already!"

"Haha, but I'm still no match for you!" Li Xuanxuan replied cheerfully. He too, had made rapid progress over these five years. Not only had he condensed the final sixth chakra of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, but he was also reaching its peak.

"How's your bow technique coming along?" Li Xuanxuan asked.

Li Xuanfeng, with a gleeful smile, handed over a jade slip, declaring proudly, "This is the Astral Golden Bow technique. Although it‚Äôs quite complex, fully mastering it means inheriting at least seventy percent of my true legacy."

"Excellent." Li Xuanxuan praised as he accepted the precious jade slip, carefully tucking it into his chest pocket, planning to place it in the stone cave for safekeeping.

With a beaming smile, he said, "Sit down for a moment. I'll go and call our second uncle."

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly, his mustache giving him a more mature appearance. Sitting on a stool, he drank his tea in big gulps, feeling restless.

"Strange..." Li Xuanfeng said, setting down his tea bowl. He suddenly thought of Jiang Yunu, murmuring to himself, "In any case, I should bring that woman back home... It‚Äôs not easy for a Qi Cultivator to have children. Waiting for her to get pregnant might take forever, and leaving her outside all the time isn‚Äôt right either. Regardless of how Second Uncle and the others might react, I‚Äôll have to do my best and explain."

"Feng'er!" Li Tongya called out as he descended in front of the courtyard before entering leisurely.

Li Xuanfeng‚Äôs eyes lit up, and he quickly stood up, cupping his fist respectfully.

"Congratulations to Second Uncle for breaking through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm!"

Li Tongya, with his aura already exuding the seventh heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm and even brimming with true essence, indicated that he had broken through a year or two ago. He simply nodded and took his seat.

He accepted the tea bowl and smiled. "Have you made any progress with your bow technique?" he asked.

"I certainly have!" Li Xuanfeng replied as he beamed with pride, lifting his bow.

"A few years ago, my mastery was confined to the sheer sharpness of the bow. Now... I've truly grasped the intent of the bow. Without the need for arrows, merely drawing and aiming the bow at rabbits is enough to startle them to their demise, while aiming at people can shatter their resolve. Even Qi Cultivators‚Äîstruck by my formless, colorless arrow intent, will find themselves thrown into disarray for an extended period... let alone ordinary people and those in the Embryonic Breathing Realm! Those with weaker wills may even succumb to vomiting blood and falling to a fever, unable to even take flight."

"It‚Äôs that miraculous..?" Li Tongya repeated softly as he found his bow technique quite peculiar. Lacking knowledge of archery, he could not tell whether Li Xuanfeng‚Äôs current mastery was good or bad, deciding it would have to be tested in real combat.

Seeing Li Xuanfeng looking around, Li Tongya asked softly, "What's wrong?"

Li Xuanfeng shook his head, choosing his words carefully before saying, "Well... before I begin, please forgive me, Second Uncle... I've actually taken a liking to a girl in the prefecture. She is of humble background, so I've always hesitated to bring her home. It's been over a decade. I thought of bringing her back today, to continue our lineage here..."

"Huh?" Li Tongya sipped his tea and replied, "Young love is no crime. Find an opportunity to bring her home."

Li Xuanfeng was overjoyed, nodding vigorously. Initially planning to demonstrate his bow technique to Li Tongya and the others, he was now too excited for that.

After bidding farewell to Li Tongya, he rode the wind to the prefecture to fetch Jiang Yunu.




# Chapter 162: The Little Goose

Li Yuanyu was dozing off at the foot of the bed when he was suddenly awakened by loud cries and shouts. He rubbed his eyes, only to find the room filled with thick fog that obscured his view.
ùó≥ùóøùêûùïñùòÑùó≤ùïìùóªùöòùöüùïñùê•.ùöåùï†ùïû

"Mother!" Li Yuanyu called out as he turned to look but found Jiang Yunu, his mother, gone.

Peering outside into the eerily dark sky, he noticed a bright moon.

"Strange," he muttered, stepping out the door only to find no ground beneath his feet. It emptied out and seemed to only extend into an eternal emptiness.

"Ah!"

Suddenly, Li Yuanyu felt the collar tighten around his neck as he was yanked up by the collar and thrown into a basket roughly. Looking up, he saw the towering city wall before him, realizing he was already outside the prefecture.

The middle-aged man he had seen earlier met his gaze with a grin. His pale complexion, blood-red lips, and hauntingly black eyes greatly unsettled Li Yuanyu.

"It seems my spell hasn't rusted too much... I can't kidnap others, but a child is still within my means!"

"You..!"

The man took out the copper coin from Li Yuanyu's chest pocket, carefully storing it away before stating firmly, "Since you took my coin, you must now follow me."

A startled Li Yuanyu protested, "Why are you taking me?! Are you an immortal?"

"No!" the man replied gruffly, his face contorting in anger immediately at the mention of an immortal.

"The so-called 'immortals' have killed your mother... do not speak of them again!"

Li Yuanyu looked as though he had been struck by lightning, staring in utter shock and disbelief.

"W-What... what are you talking about?!"

The middle-aged man chuckled darkly, stepping forward to brush his hand over the city gate. Suddenly, a pattern spread like water ripples... revealing the ghastly scene within the courtyard. Li Yuanyu caught a glimpse of the gore and cried out in shock, nearly fainting.

His little face turned deathly pale as he sobbed. The man, unmoved by his tears, said with a low chuckle, "My name is Jiang Boqing, and from now on... you will learn curse spells with me. What's your name?"

Li Yuanyu, still not trusting of this strange man, was naturally unwilling to follow him and began to cry louder. Seeing that Li Yuanyu would not stop crying, Jiang Boqing picked him up with a look of satisfaction on his face.

"Then I guess you'll have to take my surname and be called Jiang Yan!"

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Xuanfeng flew along the Guli Road, noticing the five-colored brilliance flowing over Cloud Crowned Peak as if a formation had been activated. A sense of dread filled his heart and he thought to himself, Could it be that someone dares to cause trouble for the Xiao Family..? What's going on?

With doubts crowding his mind, Li Xuanfeng did not stop. He observed the city gate road below that was deserted with overturned carts, scattered clothes, and various foods left unattended, while unattended horses and cows grazed lazily as if nothing had happened.

His heart sank as he flew over the city walls of Lixia Prefecture, spotting bloody handprints covering the walls, as if countless people had attempted to climb over them; only to fall and burst their stomachs, splattering the ground below with blood-stained feces and urine.

It was not hard to find the small courtyard located in the alley, especially with how deserted the city now was.

Landing in front of the courtyard, Li Xuanfeng noticed a small goose crookedly embroidered on a piece of cloth hanging on the door that was stained with blood, swaying in the wind as if ready to take flight.

Creak...

The door was ajar. Pushing it gently, he caught sight of a white, tender little foot on the steps. It was cleanly severed at the ankle‚Äîthe cut smooth and precise.

He recognized it instantly as the foot he had caught and caressed countless times under the covers‚Äîone of the pair he had once playfully teased, making Jiang Yunu blush and glare at him.

As a young man experiencing the beginnings of passion, he had always squeezed her feet and asked, "How can there be something so beautiful?"

Jiang Yunu, with her cute, round face, would always stare at him with her almond-shaped eyes in response as she turned her face away shyly.

Feeling as if he had been slapped in the face, Li Xuanfeng's eyes dodged the sight of the foot as if burned by fire, only to then catch sight of the bloody intestines hanging from the wall.

Collapsing to the ground, he picked up the foot as if in a trance and called out in a voice stricken with agonizing grief.

"It's you..."

Tears flowed uncontrollably as he moved forward, picking up two smooth limbs that were once his lover's arms. However, in doing so, the foot he was holding fell from his grasp. He picked it up hastily and continued forward.

He saw her bloodied rears, long black hair, globs of flesh that looked like breasts, and finally half of Jiang Yunu's face...and her once cute and round almond eye.

That eye, which was once filled with hope, was now lifelessly dull. It was no different to the eye of a dead fish‚Äîempty and void of emotion.

As he kneeled, still holding her dismembered parts gently in his arms, the world seemed to sway before him. The past figures of his father Li Xiangping, Old Xu, and countless others whom he cared for flashed before his eyes, seeming to form an endless row of figures that only signify painful yet tender memories.

Finding the lower half of her face in a corner, he painstakingly reassembled her, his hands trembling as he did so. He poured her shattered teeth back into her mouth carefully.

"Wait for me... my love," he whispered.

And with that, he closed her eyes gently.

He bit his lip so hard that it bled.

He bent down and planted a kiss on her cold lips, his blood staining her pale ones with a flush of red. With the gentlest voice that he did not know he was capable of, he murmured softly, "It's my fault! I'm a fool! I don't deserve to be the one alive... I'll make sure to avenge you, my love..."

"I don't care who did this to you... whether or not it is a young master of the immortal gates or a fiend of the Devil Dao... I'll kill them! Just wait...just wait! I will avenge you!"

He rose and swayed a little on his feet, clearly still in a daze. His eyes blazed with a terrifying intensity. His body burned‚Äîfrom the top of his head to the tips of his toes‚Äîas if he had drunk two jars of liquor.

"I'm not burying you yet because I'm afraid... I'm afraid he might escape. I'll go ask around and then come back for you."

He was whispering to the severed head... that was split into two on the ground.

Turning around, he took the cloth that was embroidered with the little goose from the wall. He held it carefully in his palm and flew up, soaring over the mountains of corpses and seas of blood below, heading toward Cloud Crowned Peak.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Xiao Ruyu stood stunned on the mountain peak feeling both empty and sorrowful, when a cold voice broke the silence.

"Li Xuanfeng has come to visit... I kindly request the elder to open the gate."

Before Xiao Yongling could speak, a startled Xiao Ruyu exclaimed, "This is bad! There are still members of the Li Family in the prefecture..!"

Seeing Xiao Yongling's stern face and his silence, Xiao Ruyu quickly thought, Li Xuanfeng must be furious... I can't let him confront Clan Uncle. If he speaks out of turn and causes offense, it could lead to a rift between our families!

Thus, he boldly volunteered, "Clan Uncle! Leave this to me."

Xiao Yongling stroked his chin and nodded slightly, evidently also having considered the situation.

Xiao Ruyu then flew down to meet Li Xuanfeng, his expression mournful as he called out to him.

"Brother Xuanfeng!"

Li Xuanfeng appeared calm, showing no emotion as he spoke quietly.

"What happened down there?"

"The Golden Tang Gate invaded... slaughtering our Lixia Prefecture. My family dared not resist," Xiao Ruyu answered nervously, casting his eyes downward.

"I understand," Li Xuanfeng replied with a curt nod, lifting his head to meet Xiao Ruyu's gaze and startling him. Gone was Li Xuanfeng's usual carefree demeanor, instead, it was now replaced with an unfamiliar and chilling ferocity.

If Chen Donghe were here, he would be stunned too. This expression, which had appeared thousands of times on Li Xiangping's face, now marked Li Xuanfeng's, transferring the same sinister look to his visage and sending shivers down one's spine.

"Which way did they go?" Li Xuanfeng asked simply.

"East..."

Just as Li Xuanfeng took to the wind and was about to head east, Xiao Ruyu yelled out to stop him.

"Brother Xuanfeng! Don't be rash!"

Biting his lip, Xiao Ruyu stood frozen for a moment before also taking to the skies, deciding to follow Li Xuanfeng eastward.




# Chapter 163: Trembling Heart

Xiao Ruyu followed Li Xuanfeng, feeling rather agitated in that moment. He was of a kind nature and had been holding back his anger at the sight of hundreds of thousands of civilians being slaughtered.

Clenching his teeth, he said, "Brother Xuanfeng, those from Golden Tang Gate are merely Qi Cultivators, and the person in charge is just a minor cultivator at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. This is a bait thrown by Golden Tang Gate and Azure Pond Sect! They probably have more than a dozen Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators behind them... Without hooking a few big fish at the Foundation Establishment Realm, they won't make their move. Although we are only at the Qi Cultivation Realm, if we plan carefully... we might make them pay a price."

Although Li Xuanfeng was furious, he was still rational.

"Don't worry, Brother Ruyu. I'm confident. Not even a Qi Cultivator can escape from me... let alone that young master who is only at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. I'll make sure he dies obscurely and in a humiliating manner, as a form of interest payment!" he snarled, the same ferocity crossing his expression.

Xiao Ruyu glanced at the Golden Age Longbow behind Li Xuanfeng and speculated on some possibilities in his head. He patted the brocade pouch on his waist and took out two pale blue talismans before saying in a low voice, "I have two Profound Essence Escape Talismans here, best used for fleeing and as a last resort for saving one's life. As long as Brother Xuanfeng can ensure a fatal hit, we'll immediately head west without leaving any traces."

"I'll count on you then, Brother Ruyu," Li Xuanfeng nodded as he accepted one of the talismans, feeling even more confident now.

Xiao Ruyu then sternly said, "If we succeed, at the very least‚Äîwe could lay the souls of tens of thousands below to rest... and be spared from the guilt. If we fail, we'll immediately escape without risking our lives. After all, revenge is a dish best served cold."

"Don't worry, Brother Ruyu. I won't act rashly," Li Xuanfeng assured as he shook his head, feeling his hatred for Azure Pond Sect and Golden Tang Gate reaching new heights.

He gritted his teeth and continued, "This is only to avenge the elders in my family and my wife. Hatred and resentment will not disappear into thin air just like that... We still have many things to do after we've done this."

At that very moment, a group appeared on the horizon. They were all dressed in golden robes, carrying various blades on their backs. It was easy to tell that they were people from the Golden Tang Gate.

At the highest point was a boy around twelve or thirteen years old who was wielding a blood-red long sword, from which thousands of red sword lights surged out‚Äîeach moving nimbly through the air, lethally seeking a human life to claim below.

Surrounded by a circle of Qi Cultivators, they stared greedily at the mountains of corpses and the seas of blood soaking the small town below.

Li Xuanfeng squinted for a moment, selecting a mountain peak to alight upon. He landed with a light step with his left hand tautening the string while his right hand gripped the bow steadily. His fierce gaze bore forward, yet he was making no attempt of nocking an arrow or channeling any mana into his bow... To an observer, it seemed as though he was simply taking aim at a rabbit.

Whoosh!

Only the sound of the bowstring vibrating in the air broke the silence, which was accompanied by a gentle breeze that rustled through the mountains, blowing off two dried leaves.

Li Xuanfeng rose to his feet and put his bow away. This time, most of the anger in his expression had dissipated as he spoke softly.

"The man is already dead... Let's go."

Xiao Ruyu gave him a puzzled look. Nevertheless, the two activated their talismans which transformed into two blue lights, then sped away to the west like the wind.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

"Wan'er, what's wrong?"

"Nothing," Ning Wan replied with a small frown, looking at the triumphant look on the face of the young master from Golden Tang Gate, feeling quite troubled.

As a disciple of Moon Lake Peak, Lixia Prefecture was her place to protect. Yet, now it was being handed over to Golden Tang Gate for slaughter.

This put her in an awkward position and it pained her. Yet, she had no choice but to follow the sect's orders and had to be ready to suppress any Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator that might appear.

She was not an old-fashioned person, nor was she like those naive and ignorant sect disciples. If she had to choose between protecting the Azure Pond Sect and the lives of tens of millions of people, Ning Wan would not hesitate to choose the former.

However, allowing others to slaughter their own people just to eliminate a possibility made Ning Wan feel like it was not worth it.

She had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm more than a decade ago, becoming the youngest Foundation Establishment cultivator in the Azure Pond Sect to do so, aside from Li Chejing.

Being the strongest Foundation Establishment cultivator among the ones currently hidden in the surroundings, she clearly saw the arrow intent aimed straight at Situ You's head but chose not to act as a flicker of satisfaction crossed her eyes instead.

With such profound intent, it's either the work of a seasoned Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator or a Purple Mansion Realm immortal cultivator. Yet... not a trace of mana was mixed in. This seems like a deliberate choice to spare the families any loss of face while still disciplining that guy. Let it be... If he dies, his death won't affect the plan anyway.

After all, Ning Wan harbored no fondness for Situ You. At just twelve or thirteen years old, he was already so cruel and vicious, slaughtering the people of her Moon Lake Peak. Although bound by sect rules not to intervene, Ning Wan was pleased to see him dead.

Looking around, several middle to late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators appeared thoughtful, evidently sensing something as well. However, none was willing to offend an unknown Foundation Establishment Realm or even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator for an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator they did not know well.

Even the cultivators from the Golden Tang Gate watched coldly from the side, and Ning Wan chuckled to herself in her heart.

Suddenly, Situ You grunted from below. The surrounding Qi Cultivators looked at him hurriedly. Situ You waved at them dismissively, mumbling to himself in confusion.

"Strange... why does my mouth taste so bitter?"

His anxiety grew as he shook his head and he found the bitterness in his mouth intensifying. He called out, "Someone come and look after this dharma artifact for me! Something's wrong with me."

Someone stepped forward to take his long saber, but as soon as Situ You's hands left the dharma artifact, he suddenly felt panic setting in. Touching his tongue, he discovered that his fingers were covered in a pale yellow liquid.

"This is... bile? Oh no! No...no!" Situ You screamed suddenly, his chest swelling suddenly as though it was inflating. He collapsed soon after, crying out weakly.

"Ah!"

"Ancestor! Save me... I..."

As he spoke these words, he continued inflating, almost like a balloon.

The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators above him projected their spiritual senses toward him but none showed themselves, merely watching as he burst like a balloon with a bang.

BOOM!

Blood and bone fragments splattered everywhere, staining the surrounding Qi Cultivators in blood. The group stood dumbfounded, staring at the mist of blood in the air, wiping their faces without any clue of what had just happened.

One of the Qi Cultivators holding the dharma artifact opened his mouth as if to call out something but then was interrupted by a cold voice.

"Carry on!"

No one dared to defy the order.

They simply lowered their heads and cleaned the blood off themselves with spells, acting as if nothing had happened.

The mark left on one of Situ You's bone fragments that was meant to track his killer flew upward. However, it found no trace of mana and aimlessly circled in place before disappearing into thin air.

"To think a distinguished young master died in such a pitiful manner..." murmured a nearby Qi Cultivator, feeling a shiver of terror.

Thoughts raced through his mind.

Despite being an illegitimate son of a concubine, this young master was not only cunning and clever but was also born with a spiritual orifice. I thought things would go well if I served him... but now that he's dead out here, my future seems bleak.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Xiao Ruyu and Li Xuanfeng settled down in the mountains. Li Xuanfeng said in a low voice, "He's dead, but I was just taking out some anger on him. It's meaningless because in the end, we're still powerless..."

Although Xiao Ruyu did not understand how Li Xuanfeng killed the young master from the Golden Tang Gate, he felt sorrowful in his heart. "This has always been a muddy situation... Who doesn't bear any sins? We just killed the apparent culprit, but those behind them continue with their slaughters using dharma artifacts beyond our resistance," he muttered with a grim smile.

Li Xuanfeng had no interest in further discussion as the round trip had taken over four hours. He cupped his fist and bid Xiao Ruyu farewell respectfully.

"I still have things to take care of so I'll be taking my leave now, Brother Ruyu."
ùíáùìªùìÆùìÆùô¨ùôöùíÉùíèùì∏ùô´ùíÜùô°.ùì¨ùì∏ùíé

Xiao Ruyu hurriedly returned the gesture and watched as Li Xuanfeng departed. After a while, he turned to address Xiao Yongling behind him.

"Clan Uncle..."

"Have you had your fill of excitement?"

Once Li Xuanfeng left, Xiao Yongling appeared and stared at Xiao Ruyu, speaking softly, "You managed to escape only because you found a loophole in the situation between the two sects... Don't do such dangerous things again."

It was clear he had secretly followed them. Stealth was the Xiao Family's specialty, hence he was not discovered by the two men.

Although Xiao Ruyu felt that neither sect understood how the young master died, he did not counter his elder's words.

"I'll keep that in mind."

Xiao Yongling then nodded, looking in the direction Li Xuanfeng had gone, and muttered, "Although Li Xuanfeng isn't foolish, his heart harbors a bold courage that is innate... It's a trait that can make or break him. His exceptional archery saved the day, but if he's ever targeted by others one day, it will likely be through the exploitation of his bravery."

Xiao Ruyu, considering Li Xuanfeng a true friend, shook his head with a pained expression. Xiao Yongling gave him a stern look as he shot him a word of advice.

"Your kindness is no different... Though you're not stupid, with a lifespan of hundreds of years... if your nature is too obvious, sooner or later, it will lead to your downfall."

Xiao Ruyu laughed heartily in response. "There are all sorts of people in this world. In my opinion, if everyone were only cautious and driven by profit, life would lose its meaning!" he said in a carefree tone, though he made sure to remain respectful.

"You little rascal!"

Xiao Yongling was amused, patting his head and murmuring softly, "As an elder, I wish nothing but for you to live well. I'm not forcing you."




# Chapter 164: The Burial

The sky was dark when Li Xuanfeng landed in the courtyard. It was eerily silent, devoid of any sound except for the distant cries from far beyond the horizon.

The dimness seemed to bury all traces of bloodshed, yet Li Xuanfeng's cultivation allowed him to see everything clearly.

"My love... I've avenged you by slaying that young master..."

He dismantled a door to fashion a makeshift coffin and carefully arranged each piece of the dismembered body parts, using his mana to piece her back together.

It took him about an hour to restore her to a semblance of her once human form. As he dressed her in some clothes he found in the wardrobe, he stumbled upon several children's garments.

Upon closer inspection of them, he realized that they were all suitable for a child around four to five years old. Digging deeper, he found an array of children's items.

If his last visit had resulted in her pregnancy, their child would indeed be about this age by now.

Through his tears, Li Xuanfeng noticed the cuffs of one particular piece that bore the name "Yuanyu"[1]‚Äîa reminder of Jiang Yunu's origins from a prominent fishing family by the river. Despite later ending up in a brothel, she knew how to read to some extent.

He was not sure whether it was the complexity of the characters or the clumsy embroidery work, but the name "Yuanyu" appeared rather messy.

"Yuanyu..."

It was then that Li Xuanfeng realized that he had also lost his child whom he had never met in the city, which led to him feeling even more guilty and pained.

He crouched on the ground for a while before closing the coffin, murmuring to himself, "Considering the time, there's still no sign of him at home... Could he have been at school or out playing in the streets..?"

Gathering a few sets of the children's clothing, Li Xuanfeng carried the coffin and flew around the yard. Under the dim sky, he saw no corpse of a four or five-year-old child. Thus, this forced him to head toward a nearby school with tears brimming in his eyes.

There, the ground was littered with the remains of children. Li Xuanfeng searched blindly among the mountain of bloody flesh but failed to identify the child he was looking for.

He sighed sorrowfully, deciding to erect a tomb for the child with his clothes as a replacement for his lost body. Shaking off the blood from his hands, he went toward the Li Family's store.

Still carrying the coffin, he walked around the Li Family's shop and could faintly recognize the bodies of Wan Tianchou and a clan brother of his.

Biting his lip, Li Xuanfeng muttered angrily, "I've always told you not to slack off and practice diligently! Yet... you chose to indulge yourself in the city. Look at yourself now... you couldn't even withstand a single glow from a dharma artifact!"

He wanted to say more, but glancing at Wan Tianchou's despairing eyes, he could not bring himself to continue.

"Well, it's not your fault... It's the fault of this cruel world!" Li Xuanfeng said bitterly, casting his eyes downward.

"I guess I'll inform his family to recover his body..." Li Xuanfeng sighed softly. With that, he lifted the coffin once more and flew westward, crossing the blood-stained city walls.

Seeing him approaching with the coffin, Xiao Ruyu felt guilty and exclaimed, "Brother Xuanfeng, I've received word... the young master is indeed dead!"

"I know," Li Xuanfeng responded flatly without stopping, continuing his way toward the Li Residence.

He left Xiao Ruyu in his wake, still rather confused, who stood alone before returning to the mountain as the sky gradually brightened.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Meanwhile, on Mount Lijing...

Li Xuanxuan took Li Yuanxiu up the mountain with him. Now twelve, the child was quiet and polite. Having discovered his spiritual orifice a few years ago and already having started his cultivation, he had condensed the Profound Scenery Chakra and attained the first stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.

Li Xuanxuan planned to delegate some family responsibilities to the child and start preparing him to be a leader.

Li Yuanjiao was now eight years old, and likewise, was also blessed with a spiritual orifice. The news last year delighted Li Xuanxuan immensely.

Li Xuanling was not to be outdone, however. Lu Wanrong bore him two children‚Äîa daughter named Li Qinghong and a son named Li Yuanyun. Now four and three years old respectively, both children were extremely adorable, earning everyone's affection.

"Xuanling's children are also growing up... In another three years, when these kids have matured, we'll request a talisman seed before the mirror."

Li Xuanxuan glanced at Li Yuanxiu who was engrossed in reading a bamboo slip, and sighed to himself.

I feel sorry for Xiu'er. As the elder brother, he has to wait for his younger brother and cousins.

Setting down his tea bowl, Li Xuanxuan saw Li Tongya's expression change suddenly. He stood up and walked out of the courtyard, loudly demanding, "What's going on?!"

Li Xuanxuan followed him outside hurriedly and saw Li Xuanfeng covered in blood, his robe stained crimson red. He carried a huge and shabby bloodstained wooden box, looking very forlorn.

Although he had composed himself on the way, Li Xuanfeng, now seeing his uncle and brothers gather around him, felt mentally exhausted and forced himself to explain in a painful voice.

"The Azure Pond Sect and Golden Tang Gate have started another slaughter... Lixia Prefecture has hardly any survivors left. The Li Family members stationed there, including Wan Tianchou, are all dead. She... and the child I've never met, have both perished."

Such succinct words from him stunned everyone. Li Xiewen, standing behind Li Xuanxuan, almost cried out in shock.

His younger brother had been responsible for guarding Lixia Prefecture. He thought it would be a safe assignment... not expecting it to cost him his life like this.

Li Tongya opened his mouth but looking at the child's weary face, spoke in the softest voice he could muster.

"Let's bury them on the mountain first..."

Li Xuanfeng nodded and his voice trembled as he spoke.

"I couldn't find the child's remains... I only brought back a few clothes of his. We can only erect a cenotaph for him."

Tears welled up in Li Xuanxuan's eyes. After Li Xuanfeng excused himself to bury his wife and child in the mountain, Li Xuanxuan turned to Li Tongya and said bitterly, "Second Uncle... what's going on?!"

Li Tongya merely sighed.

"Such is life."

He could not recall how many times he had offered these words of comfort. While he had first heard this from Li Mutian, he had personally experienced it numerous times in his own life, gradually gaining a profound understanding of its meaning.

Li Xuanxuan sent people down the mountain to have the families of the deceased clan members recover the corpses. Watching Li Xiewen rush down the mountain, Li Xuanxuan entered the mountain quietly.

He watched Li Xuanfeng dig the graves himself and bury the blackwood coffin, watching also as he placed the children's clothes in another grave before carefully covering it up.

Li Xuanfeng lifted his head and looked at Li Xuanxuan. Forcing a smile on his face, he said softly, "I was the one who buried my father, and now my wife and son... When it's time for me to be buried, I'll have to trouble you."

"Nonsense!"

For the first time, Li Xuanxuan assumed the stance of an elder brother, staring at him fiercely.

He was about to say something when Li Xuanfeng waved to silence him and continued, "I won't let this defeat me, brother. I will cherish my life even more, now that I have a mission to avenge my father and family."

As they conversed, Li Tongya, Li Xuanling, and others had arrived. They listened as Li Xuanfeng recounted how he had used his bow intent to kill the young master from the Golden Tang Gate.

Li Tongya wanted to scold Li Xuanfeng for acting recklessly but feared upsetting him, so he could only sigh.

"Don't do such dangerous things again in the future."

Li Xuanfeng nodded but said nothing else while Li Xuanling, leaning against a rock and seeing that his father and brother remained silent, simply said, "Life is hard, and no family has it easy... We must look forward."

1. The character "yu" (Ê∏î) used in Li Yuanyu's name means "to catch a fish" or a "fisherman". This is also the same character in Jiang Yunu's name, where Yunu actually means "the fisherman's daughter". ‚òú




# Chapter 165: The Generation of Yuan and Qing

In the eighth lunar month, the Golden Tang Gate once again advanced southward, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake as it slaughtered the people of Lixia Prefecture. Homes were razed, families perished, and the city streets were littered with bones. There was no one to mourn the dead. Desolate roads lay empty, and the air was foul with the stench of decay, bearing witness to the annihilation of countless families within the city walls.

Li Jingtian wrote all of this down in great detail, capturing the tragedy of millions in a short paragraph. Dipping her brush into the ink again, she continued writing.

The young master's wife and child were not spared from the purge. With eyes blazing with rage, he rode the wind eastward, spotting members of the Golden Tang Gate from afar, he swiftly shot one of them down.

"Auntie!"

Li Xuanling's children entered the courtyard, laughing and playing.

Li Qinghong, the elder sister, had grown tall and was now reaching Li Jingtian's waist. She had her long hair tied back and boasted an energetic personality, and now she was rushing into the courtyard.

Li Yuanyun, her younger brother, was much quieter, carefully following behind his sister. Upon seeing Li Jingtian, he greeted her respectfully while Li Qinghong had already sat by the table, eyeing her clothes.

The two children‚Äîmerely six or seven years old‚Äîand not yet of age to leave the mountain, would often visit Li Jingtian, chatting with their aunt and asking for snacks. Last year, when Li Yuanjiao discovered that he had a spiritual orifice and went up the mountain, these two would wander about after school, frequently calling for their older cousin, Yuanjiao. When they finally grew tired, they would end up at Li Jingtian's place.

Li Jingtian put down her brush, closed the book on the table despite not being done with the writing, and warmly embraced Li Qinghong. Then, footsteps were heard at the door, and a gentle voice followed.

"Greetings, Auntie."

A young boy in black attire entered, his long hair tied back and a sword around his waist, his eyes bright and spirited as he looked at Li Jingtian. Remembering his mother Mu Yalu's instructions, Li Yuanjiao often visited Li Jingtian to borrow books.

"Come, have a seat." Li Jingtian smiled. Seeing the three children getting along well with each other reassured her.

She then asked Li Yuanjiao, "Where's your father?"

The mention of Li Xuanxuan caused the light in Li Yuanjiao's eyes to dim slightly.

"He's either dealing with affairs down the mountain or cultivating in seclusion... Those are the only places he goes to, where else could he be?" he responded glumly.

Li Jingtian was taken aback, quickly comforting him, "Your father has a large family to manage! Naturally, he can't always be there for you and your mother... I hope you're not upset with him."

"I wouldn't dare," Li Yuanjiao replied hastily, yet thought to himself, Mother and Auntie said the same thing but I'm not blind... Why can he spend time with Brother Xiu every day, but not with my mother and me?

Li Yuanxiu, the elder brother, was quiet and gentle, and Li Yuanjiao shared a good relationship with him. Hence, these thoughts left Yuanjiao feeling uncomfortable. He pursed his lips tightly, unwilling to let any of it out.

Li Jingtian, noticing this, was about to offer some consolation when two knocks were heard at the door.

Li Tongya dusted his robe before stepping into the room, followed by Li Xuanling in leather armor and Li Xuanxuan in a long robe.

The children in the room were startled, standing up in a flurry and greeting Li Tongya all at once.

"Second Granduncle!"

"Grandfather!"

"Hmm," Li Tongya responded with a smile. Recently, he had unexpectedly broken through to the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, bringing him great joy over the past few months. Seeing the children's cheerful demeanor brought a rare smile to his usually stoic face.

"Has Xuanfeng not come out of seclusion yet?" he asked.

"Not yet."

After burying his wife, Li Xuanfeng immediately went into seclusion on the mountain and was never seen wandering around since then. He had been more diligent in his cultivation than before, now having been in seclusion for over two years.

Li Tongya stroked his beard, feeling reassured by the changes in Li Xuanfeng. As an elder in the family, he looked at things from a long-term perspective.

"If it wasn't for losing a child in the prefecture, this lesson could almost be considered beneficial... It made this kid seriously reflect and focus on his cultivation."

Observing the cautious children, Li Tongya considered the timing and said to Li Xuanxuan, "It's time to get Yuanxiu up the mountain... If we delay it any further, it might hinder the child's progress."

The brothers exchanged glances, understanding Li Tongya's intent.

Li Xuanxuan nodded, and immediately, a clan guard was sent down the mountain to call for Li Yuanxiu, who was now fourteen and had been assisting with some matters at the mountain's foot.

Li Tongya sipped his tea, observing the children. His gaze lingered on Li Yuanjiao, dressed in black.

All the children are clever. Xuanling has only Yuanyun for a male heir, while Xuanxuan has many descendants... including four or five from his concubines. We could select one to be adopted by Xuanling to continue the lineage, preferably one with a spiritual orifice... Yuanjiao seems like an ideal choice.

However, this is a significant matter, and it's better to observe the child's talent and personality first.

As he mused, Li Yuanxiu had arrived at the house. He was a rather handsome youth draped in a white goose feather cloak. His smile was gentle, yet he remained quiet and polite. Clutching a green sword, he exuded a certain grace.

"Greetings, elders!" Li Yuanxiu's clear and strong voice rang out.

Seeing him, Li Yuanjiao and the other children stood up and looked at him eagerly, almost wanting to rush up and wrap him in an embrace.

Li Tongya nodded slightly while Li Xuanxuan smiled broadly, thoroughly pleased with the eldest of the fourth generation. Li Yuanxiu, be it in his demeanor, appearance, handling of matters, or talent, was considered exceptional. He was beloved by his cousins and capable of shouldering heavy responsibilities.

Everyone took their seats, and the children, standing awkwardly in the middle of the courtyard, hid behind Li Yuanxiu.

Li Xuanxuan glanced at his sibling and then warmly said to the children, "It's rare for us all to gather like this, especially with your second granduncle out of seclusion. Don't be shy, come forward."
ùêüùï£ùïñùêûùê∞ùïñùöãùêßùóºùöüùêûùïù.ùó∞ùê®ùê¶

Li Tongya glanced at the long sword hanging at Li Yuanxiu's waist and asked warmly, "How goes your sword technique cultivation? Have you mastered the Profound Water Sword Technique?"

Li Yuanxiu replied, "I started learning the sword at seven and this is my sixth year practicing it. I've memorized the Profound Water Sword Technique by heart and managed to unleash sword aura."

Li Tongya nodded and praised him.

"Well done... Come to the cave dwelling on Mount Meiche tomorrow. I'll teach you sword techniques."

Li Xuanxuan, overjoyed, knew of Li Tongya's high proficiency in swordsmanship. Learning from him would be excellent. Li Yuanxiu nodded eagerly while the other children in his generation looked on enviously.

Li Tongya smiled at the other children and explained, "The same goes for all of you. Whoever manages to unleash a sword aura before the age of fifteen may come and find me at the cave dwelling on Mount Meiche."

After saying this and nodding at Li Xuanxuan, Li Tongya left.

Li Jingtian followed to see him off, while Li Xuanling and Li Xuanxuan exchanged glances with each other.

Li Xuanling suggested softly, "Let's take the children to the back courtyard then, Yuanxiu, Yuanjiao, Yuanyun... and as for Qinghong..."

"She'll come too," Li Xuanxuan decided after a moment's thought.

Suddenly, the image of Li Jingtian's face popped into his mind, reminding him of the bewilderment and helplessness in her eyes when he asked if she would marry Chen Donghe years ago.

Feeling a tightness of guilt in his heart, he spoke firmly, "Take them all! If Second Uncle asks, I'll explain."




# Chapter 166: The Bestowal of Talismans to the Generation of Yuan and Qing

Lu Jiangxian sat at the foot of the mountain, watching the moon-white stone spirits hopping around energetically. These spirits, enlivened by his mana, worked diligently within the mirror; their pale blue halos casting shadows that shifted on the ground.

The majority of the buildings within the mirror realm had been repaired, presenting a much more pleasing sight.

For Lu Jiangxian, life within the mirror involved studying shamanic spells and observing the Li Family outside. It was a life marked by simplicity and, at times, monotony. Such was life, caught in a cycle of resignation and boredom.

Now that my study of shamanic spells has made some progress, these years haven't been wasted!

He had not only developed certain cursing techniques but had also discovered blessings and tracking spells. However, for an Artifact Spirit confined to a mirror, these advancements held little practical value.

Yet, Lu Jiangxian sensed the increasing connection between the shamanic spells of Mount Yue and the mirror. As his understanding of this type of spell deepened, he found it easier to manipulate the mirror, allowing him to perform many actions previously thought impossible with them.

His divine sense spilled out of the mirror, and with a loud rumble, the stone door opened. Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanling, leading several children, entered.

The refreshing scent of burning incense filled the air, though the children were unable to smell it with their senses still sealed by mana. Hence, they showed no reaction and followed their elders in silence.

Li Yuanjiao, engulfed in darkness and unable to hear or speak, clutched Li Xuanxuan's hand tighter when he felt a reassuring pat on his shoulder.

Following his father's earlier instructions, he kneeled down, his knees cushioned by something soft and smooth as if kneeling on a pad.

Li Tongya had already been waiting inside the stone chamber, silently observing the mirror on the stone platform. He said nothing as the four children kneeled.

He looked at Li Qinghong but did not object to her presence here.

"The Li Family of Lijing offers respect along with fine delicacies and wine... On behalf of the four children present, I respectfully request the Profound Light! They will dedicate their lives to pursuing the Dao and their destinies rest in your hands... When the time comes, they will remain true to their oath. With this talisman burned, we express our gratitude to the Supreme Yin," he stated with great solemness and sincerity.

Lu Jiangxian's divine sense stirred, sending out invisible, colorless ripples that caused a nearly transparent white glow to emanate from each child's head.

To the far left was the eldest, Li Yuanxiu, who possessed a spiritual orifice and commendable talent. Although he did not match Li Xuanfeng from the previous generation, he was superior to Li Xuanxuan.

A six-cun white glow, indicating his compatibility with the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed, hovered above his head. This glow signified that, once he consumed the talisman seed, his cultivation speed could increase by sixty percent due to his inherent spiritual orifice.

In the middle were Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanyun, dressed in black and white respectively. Li Yuanjiao, with a spiritual orifice, showed even greater potential than Li Yuanxiu, as evidenced by the seven-cun white glow above his head.

Li Yuanyun, without a spiritual orifice, also had a seven-cun glow over his head. Lu Jiangxian could only sigh and exclude him from his consideration.

Li Qinghong, the last child, caught Lu Jiangxian's attention. Possessing a spiritual orifice and talents comparable to Li Yuanxiu, her head was crowned with a nine-cun white glow, shining like a faint column of light!

"Li Yuanxiu was indeed a good choice, but based on the future deduced from the Heaven Expanding Profound Talisman for Liu Changdie, there's no sign of Li Yuanxiu in the Li Family's future... Investing comes with risks and requires caution!"

After pondering for a moment, Lu Jiangxian, like an old farmer planning his spring planting, contemplated upon which seed would yield the greatest harvest next year.

The mirror floated up from the stone platform, emitting a faint white light.

"Though Li Tongya wished to grant only one talisman seed to the generation of Yuan, fearing a shortage in a few years, he's unaware that I have three more talisman seeds hidden within the mirror... This decision is not up to him; I'll take both Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong!"

The twelve runes on the mirror lit up one by one, causing a twitch in both Li Tongya and Li Xuanxuan's eyes, half-expecting a surge of boiling white moonlight from the mirror's surface.

Lu Jiangxian focused his mana, then released two Profound Pearl Talisman Seeds.

"Here stand the disciples of the Li Family‚Äîwho have forsaken their worldly attachments, ceased all transgression, and severed their roots of evil. To them, I bestow the Profound Light, initiating their journey in the path of Dao, transforming them from mere mortals to saints. They will begin with discipline and ultimately ascend to truth! I grant them a scroll of the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra, along with a tracing technique!"

Two white orbs leaped from the mirror's surface like water droplets, round and beaming with white light, illuminating the courtyard in a white expanse. The children, their senses still sealed, remained unaware while Li Tongya watched on, momentarily stunned.

The two Profound Pearl Talisman Seeds sunk into the Shenyang Mansions between the eyebrows of both Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong, one after the other. Since neither had practiced the Reception Method, the talisman seeds did not follow the meridian pathways to settle in the Qihai acupoint but instead remained quietly hidden at their Shenyang Mansion, awaiting future activation through the given method.

Li Yuanjiao felt a cool sensation on his forehead as if something had shone upon it, while Li Qinghong frowned slightly. An image of a bright moon appeared on their foreheads, flickering briefly before vanishing.

Li Xuanxuan was stunned. He had not expected the mirror to choose Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong over Li Yuanxiu. Turning to Li Tongya, he whispered, "This...

"Take the children out first."

Li Tongya shook his head, signaling Li Xuanling to take Li Yuanxiu and the three others away.

Then, Li Xuanxuan hastily said, "This... How shall we resolve this? As the eldest of his generation and possessing a spiritual orifice, the family is ultimately to be entrusted to Li Yuanxiu! How can we possibly hide this from him?!"

"There's no need for us to hide anything... Yuanxiu is generous and kind; he won't be jealous of his younger cousins."

Li Tongya and Li Xuanxuan exited the stone chamber, still concerned. Li Tongya gravely added, "My worry isn't about Yuanxiu. Yuanxiu himself is generous, but not all future descendants might share his temperament. With only one or two talisman seeds per generation, those who receive them may become proud... Affairs of the world suffer not from scarcity but from uneven distribution. Over time, if we cannot manage our clan properly, it may lead to discord."

Li Xuanxuan also fell silent. The two stood on the mountaintop for a while, facing the cold, biting north wind.

Li Tongya murmured, "For our family members, especially the direct descendants who possess a spiritual orifice or have received a talisman seed, let them be aware of the mirror's existence, but make them take a Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath to prevent leaks of information."

"The more people that know about this, the greater the risk of exposure... Second Uncle also knows that the spiritual oath isn't foolproof," Li Xuanxuan added respectfully.

Li Tongya shook his head and replied, "We can only take it one step at a time. At the very least, we must ensure that the next generation won't be divided. The system needs to be improved over generations; there's no measure that can guarantee absolute safety forever."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Meanwhile, in Lixia Prefecture.

The people from Golden Tang Gate had already withdrawn. The blood and corpses in the prefecture town had been cleaned up by scavengers, leaving only scattered traces of life and white, dry bones everywhere.

The now desolate prefecture town echoed with the mournful whistle of the wind as if it were silently weeping. Corpses were left to decay and be devoured by wild animals, while the roads of Lixia were slowly being reclaimed by encroaching wild grass after being deserted for over a year.

The sky above Lixia Prefecture was cloudless. From the south, a figure flew over like a shooting star.

Tied around his waist were five or six medicine pouches, and he carried a long sword on his back. His face showed signs of hardship, including a faint scar on the left cheek.

Looking down at the desolate town below, he sighed sorrowfully and said in a low voice, "Twenty years have gone by... and the Azure Pond Sect has finally allowed me to return. It seems Clan Uncle has also managed to avoid the sect's scrutiny..."

"The time has come to take action for my Xiao Family's cause."

Passing through the deserted town, Cloud Crowned Peak loomed ahead. He felt both joy and sorrow‚Äîjoy for escaping the clutches of the Azure Pond Sect and returning to his familiar home, and sorrow for having to return his junior brother's belongings.

Shaking his head, he murmured, "How should I face Jing'er's family..."




# Chapter 167: The Belongings

Li Yuanxiu stood in the courtyard, holding a sword as Li Yuanjiao, dressed in a black robe, swung his sword around, cutting through the cold wind sharply and producing several whooshing sounds. His hands turned white from the grip, and the sword was heavy, causing sweat to appear on Li Yuanjiao's face.

Li Yuanxiu patted Li Yuanjiao's shoulder, correcting the way he held the sword, and asked warmly, "Jiao'er, how long have you been practicing the Profound Water Sword Technique?"

"A little over two years," Li Yuanjiao responded softly. Li Yuanxiu corrected a few of his mistakes and then a young boy, appearing younger than Li Yuanxiu, entered.

He cupped his fist to them and said, "Brother, Father asks for your presence on the mountain."

"All right."

Li Yuanxiu nodded to Li Yuanyun in front of him and instructed, "Go to the east courtyard and tell them I won't be dealing with affairs for now."

Behind them, Li Pingyi had grown taller and more robust than his father, Li Xiewen. He nodded in response and left while Li Yuanxiu then followed Li Yuanyun up the mountain.

Li Xuanling was sitting in the courtyard, pondering deeply as he watched the tea leaves floating around in his cup. Li Tongya had instructed him to disclose the matter of the mirror to Li Yuanxiu and the others, filling him with worry and unease.

He had already known that his son, Li Yuanyun, lacked a spiritual orifice since long ago. Even so, he still harbored some hope that the mirror might choose Li Yuanyun and resolve the issue.

However, after kneeling before the mirror, Li Xuanling accepted reality. With a mix of emotions in his heart, he watched his child run around on the mountain. He could not help but worry.

"What to do with this child‚Ä¶"

From a young age, Li Xuanling saw his third uncle, Li Xiangping, show particular affection toward Li Jingtian. Now, experiencing it firsthand, he realized it was more than just simple love... To claim he felt no guilt or sorrow would be something Li Xuanling could not bring himself to believe.

There was then a knock at the door, and Li Yuanyun led Li Yuanxiu inside.

After a long conversation the previous night about his lack of a spiritual orifice, which had left Li Yuanyun in tears, he seemed more cheerful today‚Äîalmost as though trying to comfort his father.

"Greetings, Clan Uncle!" Li Yuanxiu greeted as he cupped his fist while Li Yuanyun stepped outside tactfully.

Li Xuanling lowered his gaze, then turned to Li Yuanxiu.

"I've called you here today because there are some family matters you should be aware of, now that you've condensed the Profound Scenery Chakra‚Ä¶"

Li Xuanling had thoroughly sorted through his thoughts before summoning Li Yuanxiu today. Carefully choosing his words, he continued, "Our family has inherited a dharma artifact from our ancestors‚Äîan extraordinary bluish-gray mirror, far surpassing the Foundation Establishment Realm, which is capable of performing many miracles."

He described the marvelous uses of the mirror in detail, citing examples from past events. Li Yuanxiu listened with joy, and then Li Xuanling continued, "Some days ago when I took you all and sealed your senses in the courtyard, it was to seek these talisman seeds. Your younger cousins, Yuanjiao and Qinghong, were chosen and have already received a talisman seed in their Shenyang Mansion."

Without mentioning the fact that the talisman seed could be bestowed upon any individual through request and instead emphasizing that only those favored by the mirror could receive one was a tactful move to avoid hurting the feelings of Li Yuanxiu.

The eldest of the fourth generation remained oblivious to this, reacting happily to the news.

"That's truly wonderful!"

There was a fleeting sadness in his eyes as he quietly added, "I feel sorry for Yuanyun though."

This comment hit right at Li Xuanling's sore spot. He nodded somberly and said, "Yuanyun cannot cultivate, and there are many things he can't confide with me because I am his father... The days ahead will be tough for him, and I will need you to look after him more, Xiu'er."

Li Yuanxiu nodded solemnly. The two talked for a long time, from discussing the threatening Yu Family to the remotely supportive Xiao Family. Many of Li Yuanxiu's insights impressed Li Xuanling. They talked late into the night before Li Xuanling had him swear the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, then sent him off.

"With such a boy to lead the family, we have nothing to worry about in the future."

Li Xuanling's mood had improved considerably. Watching Li Yuanxiu descend the mountain, he nodded in satisfaction and turned to continue his cultivation.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Xiao Yuansi paid a visit to his great ancestor Xiao Chuting and his nephew Xiao Yongling at home before finally being able to leave. He rode the wind along the Guli Road, passing over layers of forests until he reached the territory of the Li Family.

The simple Misty Maze Formation on Mount Lijing had now been replaced by a complex, shimmering gold formation, earning Xiao Yuansi's nod of approval.

Although this formation was nothing particularly impressive to a cultivator of the Foundation Establishment Realm like him, it showed considerable progress in the Li Family over the years.

Standing outside the formation, Xiao Yuansi spoke apprehensively, "Xiao Yuansi from Qingsui Peak‚Ä¶"

After a moment of thought, he corrected himself, "Xiao Yuansi of the Xiao Family in Lixia has come to visit‚Ä¶ Please open the mountain gate!"

There was a noticeable delay before a small opening was created. Xiao Yuansi retracted his mana and descended, only to be greeted by a junior he had never met before‚Ä¶ but seemed oddly familiar.

The junior cupped his fist and introduced himself.

"Greetings, Senior! I am Li Xuanxuan from the Li Family. My elders are currently in seclusion, please come rest in the courtyard."

Xiao Yuansi nodded lightly, holding back his curiosity about the junior's parents, and sat down. While waiting for Li Tongya and the others, he savored his tea.

Just as he organized his thoughts, Li Tongya arrived at the door. After dismissing everyone else, there were only the two of them left in the courtyard. Li Tongya cupped his fist respectfully.

"Greetings, Senior!"

Xiao Yuansi looked at him sentimentally, noticing his graying temples. "You've aged. Where's Xiangping?" he asked softly.

Li Tongya looked down, concealing the emotions that swirled in his eyes as he answered, "Due to an agreement between the two sects‚Ä¶ Mount Yue's eastward invasion had forced Xiangping to his death."

Already burdened with guilt, Xiao Yuansi felt as if a heavy hammer had struck him, hard. He untied the green sword around his waist and handed it over, saying softly, "Jing'er‚Ä¶ he‚Ä¶ is gone."

Although Li Tongya was already aware of this, he still failed to stop his tears. He accepted the sword with both hands and managed to choke out his reply.

"I lost my elder brother at twenty years old, then my parents and younger brothers, one after the other. Now‚Ä¶ I'm the only one left."

Although Xiao Yuansi was a cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Realm, these few words from Li Tongya stirred him to tears. Recalling his promise to take care of Jing'er when he was refining pills in the Li Family, he clenched his teeth.

"T-Tongya‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I've let you down."

Li Tongya suddenly raised his eyebrows and spoke softly.

"Senior Xiao‚Ä¶ I only have one question. How did Jing'er die..?"

Struggling internally, Xiao Yuansi's face turned red before he spoke.

"He was sacrificed by the Chi Family‚Ä¶ given to demons in the southern border to be refined into a pill! My master is still locked away in the tower, and I am too powerless to do anything‚Ä¶"

"So‚Ä¶ it was the Chi Family!"

Knowing that the Chi Family held significant power within the Azure Pond Sect and were most capable of such deeds, Li Tongya bowed and expressed his gratitude.

"Thank you, Senior!"

"I do not deserve any of that."

Xiao Yuansi sighed as he shook his head. Eager to break the somber atmosphere, he changed the topic and said, "Junior Brother also entrusted me with many things to bring back, all of which I now hand over to you."

"The most precious among them is this Qingche Sword."

Upon saying this, Xiao Yuansi pointed to the sword sheathed in his hand and explained, "This sword was forged by the master of Yuanwu Peak using seven feet of Qingming Copper from Mount Azure Pond, along with thirty-two kinds of heavenly materials and spirit items. When it was made, it wasn't at the Foundation Establishment Realm. After my junior brother nurtured it day and night, aligning its sword intent with the sword body, it broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, endowing the Qingche Sword with a great degree of spirituality. It accumulated a pure Celestial Moon Sword Intent, elevating it to a dharma artifact of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Jing'er instructed me to ensure it was returned to your family."

Xiao Yuansi shook his head and sighed.

"However, after it came into my possession, the sword refused to unsheathe, appearing dull and lackluster even when summoned with my mana. It seems to have developed its own consciousness and refuses to be wielded by my hands."

Li Tongya examined the sword, noting its pale white tassel swaying attractively. However, just as Xiao Yuansi had experienced, he could not draw it from its sheath either.

"That's proven."

Xiao Yuansi glanced sadly at the sword and continued, "Secondly, Jing'er had accomplished some feats in the southern border and...knowing your family lacked legacy in alchemy, he exchanged for one. Here it is."

He then produced a jade slip, radiant and inscribed with small characters. Li Tongya took it and read the words out loud.

"Secrets of Alchemy..."

Xiao Yuansi also handed over a storage pouch, explaining, "This contains miscellaneous items‚Äîover a hundred Spirit Stones, some talismans of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and a precious Essence Gathering Pill that can increase the success rate of breaking through the Foundation Establishment Realm by half."

Li Tongya quickly accepted, impressed by Li Chejing's thoughtfulness.

"That boy..." he muttered to himself, though fondness was evident in his voice.

Finally, Xiao Yuansi took out two jade slips‚Äîone large and one small‚Äîplacing the smaller one on the table. "This is Spirit Eye Perception, a rare pupil technique good at breaking illusions. It's difficult to cultivate and was originally intended for Xiangping, who was known for his archery," he explained softly.

He then handed over the larger jade slip to Li Tongya with great care, instructing, "This contains Chejing's sword techniques, compiled into the Law of Celestial Moon. He claimed it could be considered a Grade Five technique, which is extremely precious! Be sure not to let the word of this get out... It's marked with Jing'er's mana to prove I've not read it."

Li Tongya was visibly moved by the revelation of a Grade Five technique, which would even tempt a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator‚Äîlet alone Xiao Yuansi who might not have been at the Foundation Establishment Realm then.

He rose to his feet and bowed his head.

"Tongya is impressed by Senior's conduct!"
ùëìùëü‚ÑØùò¶ùìåùò¶ùò£ùëõùëúùìãùëíùìÅ.ùëê‚Ñ¥ùìÇ

After exchanging a meaningful glance, all was understood without the need for words. Xiao Yuansi then settled down to drink a couple of sips of tea in the silent courtyard with only the two of them.

Li Tongya softly asked, "If I may inquire, Senior... how long do you think this matter can be kept a secret?"

Xiao Yuansi set down his tea bowl, having pondered Li Tongya's thoughts for a moment.

"Other than a few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, probably only I and Chi Zhiyun from the Chi Family know about this. Chi Zhiyun spends his days in seclusion and dislikes social interactions. Given the disgraceful nature of the Chi Family's actions, he's unlikely to spread the word. Naturally, I won't speak of it either. Keeping it secret for another fifty years shouldn't be an issue."

"Fifty years..." Li Tongya hummed as he silently noted this timeframe and thanked Xiao Yuansi once more. The atmosphere in the courtyard suddenly grew heavy, both men opened their mouths to speak but found themselves at a loss for words.

After taking another sip of his tea, Xiao Yuansi, feeling restless, finally broke the tense silence.

"Great changes are looming over the Yue State... Among the peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of that generation, three are nearing the end of their lifespans, which will surely lead to turmoil. One is a rogue cultivator, whose whereabouts are unpredictable. Another is from Mount Yue, who has been extending his life with secret techniques but has recently encountered some mishaps, making things rather awkward. The last one is Chi Wei from the Chi Family. All three are approaching their death and seeking ways to break through to the Golden Core Realm. Though the chances are slim, it's best to stay vigilant."

Li Tongya listened attentively as Xiao Yuansi's eyes suddenly lit up. "By my calculations, those Snake Dragon Fruit should have grown six or seven by now... Since I'm here, let's refine those pills. It'll also prevent the loss of spiritual qi from storing them for too long!" he said with great enthusiasm.

"Oh... How could we possibly impose on you?" Li Tongya forced a laugh, feeling slightly awkward from Xiao Yuansi's enthusiasm. After a few courteous refusals he waved his hand, and Li Xuanxuan, who heard his transmitted voice, went to fetch the Snake Dragon Fruits hurriedly.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Xiao Yuansi stayed on Mount Lijing for a few days, refining pills during his stay and offering Li Tongya guidance on cultivation and his future.

"The River One Qi Technique when cultivated to the Foundation Establishment Realm, forms an immortal foundation known as Boundless Ocean, known for its vast and mighty surge of mana. Cultivators with this foundation could often withstand attacks from multiple assailants due to the rapid flow of their mana. The former master of the Moongaze Lake market cultivated this technique. It took three cultivators of the same realm, wielding special dharma artifacts, to besiege and kill him. However, this technique is somewhat slow but paired with your swordsmanship, it could indeed be perfect."

Li Tongya nodded, carefully noting this down. Suddenly remembering a disciple from the Yu Family who had been accepted into Yuanwu Peak, he inquired, "Senior, do you know of a disciple from the Yu Family by the Moongaze Lake who was accepted into Yuanwu Peak?"

Xiao Yuansi nodded, putting away the jade box in his hand before answering.

"Before leaving the Azure Pond Sect, I made sure to gather information about the surrounding clans, including the Yu Family. That disciple is named Yu Muxian, whose talent was decent but excelled in artifact forging, had gained the favor of Yuanwu Peak."

"Speaking of which," Xiao Yuansi chuckled softly and continued, "I heard a curious tale about Yu Muxian. He not only requested from Yuanwu Peak's master for a separate prefecture to rule but also arranged for the allocation of new disciples to be assigned to those associated with or under the influence of Yuanwu Peak, and this had already filled its quota of disciples in recent years."

In other words‚Äîunless by chance, for the next few decades, no one would go to Moongaze Lake to recruit disciples!

Li Tongya pondered for a moment and exclaimed, "What a clever strategy!"

The reason why the clans by Moongaze Lake had not aggressively annexed each other was primarily due to their deep entanglements with various peaks of the Azure Pond Sect. Any rash action might invite censure from within the sect, and the Yu Family often found this situation troublesome.

However, the peak masters were only somewhat obligated to look after these families since they were not their guardians. The deeds of the Lu Family remained fresh in everyone's minds, such entanglements were often related to personal relationships, with the death of one or two family elders causing protection to wane and entire clans to be annihilated.

Yu Family's strategy effectively severed most clans' future hopes. As the older generation slowly passed away, the day would come when protection faded, offering the Yu Family a chance to profit.

Moreover, preventing the peaks from recruiting disciples also eliminates a significant threat.

While accepting the medicinal pills handed over by Xiao Yuansi, Li Tongya continued pondering silently.

An Jingming's talent is definitely among the top in Moongaze Lake in a century... If he were to be accepted into the Azure Pond Sect, the Yu Family's path to expansion southward would be completely blocked. Moreover, having such a genius from a neighboring family join the sect would likely keep the Yu Family's head awake at night. Such a cunning plan... Yu Mugao and Yu Xiaogui must have spent a considerable amount of gifts to pave such a way for their clan. This father and son are indeed difficult to deal with!




# Chapter 169: Acquiring Pills

Xiao Yuansi tapped the alchemy furnace in front of him and the final batch of Snake Essence Pills flew out instantly, glowing brightly as they circled in the air, before each landed neatly in the jade bottle in his hand.

"Alright... from these seven Snake Dragon Fruit, we've managed to produce forty-five pills. According to the usual rules we've established, I'll take nine, and the remaining thirty-six are for your family," Xiao Yuansi suggested.

Li Tongya shook his head repeatedly upon hearing this, having grown far beyond the young man he once was when he first stepped onto the path of immortality by the lake.

After three or four decades of cultivation by the lake, he was well aware of the usual shares in alchemy and insisted, "Senior! You're being far too generous to my family... In the realm of alchemy, if one provides their own materials and the success rate exceeds fifty percent, the remainder belongs entirely to the alchemist. There's no precedent for taking only after achieving a seventy percent yield! You've assisted my family greatly, how can we take advantage of you..."

Xiao Yuansi paused before a gentle smile crossed his face.

"I have already broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm; these Snake Essence Pills are of no use to me. Taking these nine is merely an effort to not break tradition. Your family has many younger members who need these pills far more than I do. There's no need for such formalities with me!"

"Absolutely not!" Li Tongya refuted immediately. He understood that it was Xiao Yuansi's sense of obligation because of what had happened at Chejing, and was simply wishing to make amends to the Li Family. He then continued graciously, "But you're right... we do indeed urgently need these pills. I shall accept your goodwill then!"

After saying this, he took out fifty Spirit Stones from his storage pouch and placed them on the table, respectfully saying, "Since these pills are of no use to Senior, these are the Spirit Stones you rightfully deserve... Please accept them!"

Xiao Yuansi calculated quickly and realized that Li Tongya was still valuing them based on a fifty percent share, and the fifty Spirit Stones were actually more than sufficient.

With a wave of his sleeve, he accepted them, not wanting to argue with him.

"Well, I won't make it difficult for you then... I'll accept them."

As he stood up preparing to take his leave, Xiao Yuansi suddenly remembered something and said warmly, "The Lixia Prefecture has been devastated with hardly any population left... My Xiao Family will need to migrate some people over from the various families along the Guli Road. A junior will come by later to discuss the details."

"Understood, Senior. Safe travels!" Li Tongya quickly replied, watching as Xiao Yuansi rode his flying shuttle away, disappearing into the horizon.

It was only then did Li Xuanxuan dared to come into the courtyard. Seeing the table filled with jade bottles, his face lit up with joy. "With these pills, the cultivation of our family members can advance further!" he exclaimed gleefully.

Li Tongya nodded, collecting the pills on the table with a wave of his sleeve.

"The Snake Essence Pill is known for its mild nature, suitable for those at the Embryonic Breathing Realm and Qi Cultivation Realm. They're just what our family needs right now," he remarked with an approving nod.

Li Xuanxuan estimated the timing and smiled, "I've been at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm for two years now... With these Snake Essence Pills, plus a talisman pill of each major realm, I have great confidence in breaking through to the Qi Cultivation Realm!"

Li Tongya handed him the pills, asking softly, "Have you decided on which cultivation method to pursue?"

"Though the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique is powerful, the required Profound Yin Thunder Liquid can only be collected during specific thunderstorms... and I can't wait that long. So, I'm choosing between the River One Qi Technique and the Cave Spring Clear Spirit Technique. Both are unique in their own way, but I'm leaning toward the latter," Li Xuanxuan explained his decision in one breath, clearly having thought through this a long time ago.

Li Tongya simply waved his hand in response to this.

"...And your reasons?"

"The Cave Spring Clear Spirit Technique uses the vitality-rich and nimble Cave Spring Clear Qi for qi cultivation, which will greatly aid in talisman crafting. Having delved into the art of talismans for over a decade, I believe it could significantly contribute to our family's needs. Moreover, Xuanling is proficient with the sword, and the River One Qi Technique suits him perfectly. If everyone in our family were to cultivate the River Pure Qi, our common traits would make us easy targets for our enemies..." Li Xuanxuan said thoughtfully, his face serious.

Li Tongya nodded in agreement and handed over a portion of Cave Spring Clear Qi he had collected over the past few years.

"Sounds like you have a good plan! Make all the necessary arrangements first before entering seclusion... If Yuanxiu can't handle the family affairs, then get Xuanling to do it," he advised.

Li Xuanxuan nodded firmly. Li Tongya then took out the Spirit Eye Perception jade slip, instructing him to deliver it to Xuanfeng in seclusion, and then retrieved another light purple one titled the Secrets of Alchemy.

"I've glanced through this. Not everyone is cut out for alchemy... it requires a certain talent. Copy the section on conjuring Pill Flame from this slip and distribute it among the family's disciples. In the coming years, if anyone manages to conjure the Pill Flame, have them seek me out on Meiche Peak."

Li Xuanxuan acknowledged the instructions and left. Li Tongya then picked up the sheathed Qingche Sword, gazing at it for a moment before firmly grasping the hilt and exerting a gentle force.

Clang!

A soft white light poured forth, illuminating the courtyard with a gleam of aqua and white sword light, casting ripples of light throughout the cave. In fact, the force was so strong that it caused the sword at Li Tongya's waist to tremble resonantly.

"Jing'er..."

The moment Li Tongya touched the sword, he had realized that using the initial stance of the Celestial Moon Slash technique would allow him to draw this spirit blade.

At that time, Xiao Yuansi was nearby, so he did not apply much force. Now, drawing the sword from its sheath, he saw the word "Qingche" engraved on the blade.

"I'm sorry that you've suffered..." he whispered, his voice pained.

The Qingche Sword hummed in his hand, radiating a cold brilliance. Li Tongya noticed a new word coming out from the sword tassel‚ÄîAnnihilate.

"Annihilate... Qingche..." Li Tongya pursed his lips and sheathed the sword, then flew toward Meiche Peak.

Li Xuanxuan, having made all the necessary arrangements, took the spiritual qi he received from Li Tongya and went to Meiche Peak for seclusion, leaving Li Xuanling and Li Yuanxiu in charge of the family affairs.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Qinghong and Li Yuanjiao had learned the Reception Method on the mountain and were now using the moonlight to condense the Profound Scenery Chakra.

Meanwhile, on Lijing Peak.

Knock, knock.

Li Yuanxiu entered the courtyard with a smile. Li Yuanjiao, who had just finished his cultivation, was practicing with his sword in the courtyard.

Seeing Li Yuanxiu, he quickly greeted him with a bright smile.

"Big brother!"

"Come here, Yuanjiao."

Li Yuanxiu ruffled up his hair and handed him a jade bottle. "This is the medicinal pill that your fourth granduncle sent back. Take good care of it and use it when you're about to break through," he said warmly, his gaze tender.

In order to keep Li Chejing's death a secret, Li Tongya and Li Xuanxuan claimed the items Xiao Yuansi brought back as sent by Li Chejing. Li Yuanxiu and the others, not knowing the truth, naturally accepted them happily.

Li Yuanjiao, having received a talisman seed and rapidly breaking through the Profound Scenery stage with the help of moonlight, was privy to the family's secret. He had taken the spiritual oath and had been cultivating on the mountain since then.

Seeing Li Yuanjiao obediently nodding and accepting it, Li Yuanxiu felt relieved that he had personally delivered the medicinal pills as instructed by Li Xuanxuan before his seclusion.

"After all, the Snake Essence Pills are precious... It's better to deliver them personally to avoid any unsightly incidents and unnecessary trouble."

Li Yuanxiu's lips curled into a small smile.

Although the cultivators in the branch family had been obedient with no unsightly incidents occurring so far, he still did not trust them fully. Hence, he preferred to handle such important matters personally.

"Chief!"

While Li Yuanxiu was still deep in his thoughts, Li Pingyi and the others entered the courtyard hurriedly, coming up to him with several town managers following closely behind. Their heads were all bowed, and none of them dared to speak.

Since Li Yuanxiu was managing affairs in the Clan Affairs Courtyard, Li Pingyi naturally addressed him as the clan leader.

Hearing Li Pingyi calling him 'chief' instead of 'young clan head' with town managers behind him, Li Yuanxiu knew something had happened to the clan disciples.

"What's the trouble?"

I've just praised our disciples, and now there's trouble... How truly laughable!

Li Pingyi did not dare to beat around the bush, looking somewhat troubled as he responded hastily, "Clan Uncle Qiuyang has returned from the mines... He has already broken through to the Jade Capital stage and possesses a spiritual sense now! When he returned to town, he took a stroll on the street and...unexpectedly, with a sweep of his spiritual sense, caught several clan disciples in the courtyard... They... in the courtyard..."

"What were they doing?" Li Yuanxiu asked sternly, only to hear Li Pingyi grit his teeth and say, "Gambling on dog fights... Some were stripped naked and fooling around with women in the courtyard..."

"How dare they!" Li Yuanjiao exclaimed in disbelief and shock. His expression darkened as he listened and watched Li Yuanxiu's expression contort with shame and indignation.




# Chapter 170: Rectifying the Atmosphere

"Who are they? Have they all been caught?" Li Yuanxiu asked as he stepped out of the courtyard, his voice low.

Li Pingyi responded promptly, "I've caught them red-handed. Apart from those not bearing the Li surname, there were six individuals in total with the Li surname. Five of them are descendants of the illegitimate brothers of our founding ancestor, and one... one is my uncle."

Li Pingyi's confession was delivered with a sense of shame and dread.

The founding ancestor he was referring to was naturally Li Mutian. Li Pingyi's uncle was one of Li Xiewen's siblings, specifically one of the sons of Li Yesheng. While Li Yesheng was alive, there was at least someone to keep them in check. After his death, they remained subdued for a few years but with Li Xiewen preoccupied with affairs, they eventually began to stir up trouble.

"I see."

Li Yuanxiu left after just speaking those two words.

"Brother, I will go too!" Li Yuanjiao muttered and quickly scrambled up to follow Li Yuanxiu down the mountain. Li Yuanxiu whispered a few words to Li Pingyi who nodded and left, then led the way to the front of that courtyard in question.

A crowd had gathered in front of the courtyard, with clan guards securing the area tightly. Li Xiewen, looking grim-faced, stood at the entrance.

Upon seeing Li Yuanxiu, he cupped his fist respectfully.

"Greetings, young clan head."

"Uncle Wen, there's no need for formalities," Li Yuanxiu responded as he entered the courtyard with him, only to witness a scene of pure chaos.

The floor was littered with fruit and vegetable scraps, making it difficult to navigate through. A dozen men‚Äîbare-chested, were pressed to the ground. His clan uncle, Li Qiuyang, stood by with his arms folded.

"Greetings, Clan Uncle," Li Yuanxiu said curtly as he greeted his clan uncle.

"Young Clan Head!" Li Qiuyang responded right away as he caught sight of him, cupping his fist and then retreating into a corner, choosing to remain silent. Li Yuanxiu noticed his graying temples.

Li Yuanxiu surveyed the courtyard. Everyone's expressions varied‚ÄîLi Xiewen appeared ashamed, Li Qiuyang calm, and the townsfolk angry and fearful, creating a heavy atmosphere. Eyes were all fixated on Li Yuanxiu.

His few illegitimate brothers, whom he had barely seen since he was six, now watched him silently from the crowd, resembling silent wolves. Li Yuanjiao, standing by his side, stared back at them coldly.

Li Yuanxiu had not interacted much with his elder brothers who lived at the foot of the mountain. These three elder brothers lacked spiritual orifice and were not well-educated, yet they had never been a bother to Li Yuanxiu.

They were aware that Li Xuanxuan had only assigned Li Yuanxiu to manage household affairs temporarily. Li Yuanxiu, being an immortal cultivator, was destined to stay on the mountain.

With four towns in Lijing and three in Huaqian, plus over a dozen scattered villages, some towns were so wealthy that the presence of immortals was the norm, while others were so poor that they barely scraped by for years. They were wary of each other, keeping a close eye on certain positions.

Li Yuanxiu then focused his steely eyes on the people before him and demanded in a cold voice, "Who started this gambling den?"

All eyes drifted toward one individual, who stumbled forward on his knees. It was a cultivator not bearing the surname Li, still at the Profound Scenery Stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm despite being in his thirties.

Without a word, Li Yuanxiu advanced swiftly and drew his sword. The grayish gleam of the Profound Water Sword Aura burst forth, and with one swift strike, the man was decapitated.

As his head rolled on the ground, the Adam's apple in his throat was still bobbing up and down as if pleading, "Mercy, please, Young Clan Head!"

The crowd recoiled in shock. Li Yuanxiu stepped to the side, avoiding the spurt of fresh blood, and the onlookers began to wail and cry.

As the crowd continued their chaotic cries, Li Pingyi arrived with a pot of boiling oil. The clan soldiers exchanged looks with each other, understanding their task silently. They then pressed the struggling gamblers down and forced their hands to be outstretched.

"Gambling is a disease of the hands..." Li Yuanxiu sneered coldly.

Li Pingyi and his men proceeded to pour the boiling oil over the gamblers' hands, which immediately caused blisters to form. While the men were screaming in agony, Li Yuanxiu then ordered, "Those who pulled down their trousers... step forward!"

Li Qiuyang, who had been silent in the corner, finally lifted his head. With a slight gesture of his finger, several burly men suddenly stumbled forward.

Even the clan soldiers who were holding them down staggered a few steps forward. Li Yuanxiu naturally knew that it was Li Qiuyang who had singled them out.

"Pour again!" he commanded loudly. His tone was harsh and unforgiving.

The distinct smell of roasted meat quickly filled the air, and the men realized at this point that their hands were far gone.

Li Yuanxiu turned to the crowd and declared, "The Clan Affairs Courtyard enforces the rules set by our ancestors: prostitution, gambling, and adultery will not be tolerated! These rules apply to everyone in our family, from the main lineage and even to the most distant branches. Don't go thinking you can get away with breaking the rules and tarnishing the Li Family's name just because you're down at the foot of the mountain!"

Silence fell all around them, and Li Yuanxiu noticed his illegitimate brothers lowering their heads, no longer meeting his gaze. He then gave out another order, though now in a gentler tone.

"Have someone treat their injuries."

As Li Yuanxiu led his group out of the courtyard, the onlookers parted to give way to them, shrinking back and avoiding his gaze.

Li Pingyi, feeling a sense of satisfaction, stepped forward and said, "Young Family Head, that should shut up those uncles and clan elders who often criticize you for not being harsh enough!"

"There's no need to mind them," Li Yuanxiu responded, walking through the dimly lit streets.

He then continued, "Those people are just looking to shift more control of the seven towns from the main family and Uncle Xiewen to their own descendants... Their gossip is meaningless. Now that this is over, they'll say I'm too brutal to lead the family."

"Power and profit struggles are inherently dirty! It's all about slandering each other... and in the end, whoever causes the other to suffer the worst defamation gets the last word..." Li Yuanxiu spoke nonchalantly, patting Li Yuanjiao's head and continuing solemnly, "Our real adversaries are never these minor internal family disputes, but the Yu and An families... along with the other ambitious clans surrounding us."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, walking beside him. After a moment of thought, he said seriously, "Brother, I'm afraid they'll hold a grudge against you. Maybe we should just send someone to get rid of them for good..."

Li Yuanxiu shook his head and replied softly, "They're still our relatives at the end of the day. Our family is already few in number... A few notorious and begrudging mortals can't make much of a difference! The Clan Affairs Courtyard will keep an eye on them, there's no need for drastic measures."

Li Yuanjiao could only nod and say coldly, "Did you notice the looks from those few brothers of ours? They're quite frightening."

Li Yuanxiu sighed slightly, causing Li Pingyi behind him to step back half a step instinctively, his gaze wandering as if lost in thought.

Li Yuanxiu shot him a glance before responding, "They're merely troublemakers without any spiritual orifice... It's not surprising that they harbor some jealousy toward us. After all, we share the same father; yet, they were born without spiritual orifice. I'm sure they also understand the bigger picture. With them around, the outsiders can't stir up much trouble."

"Understood, brother!" Li Yuanjiao said thoughtfully, nodding.

The two then ascended the mountain together, sharing a smile as they looked down at the darkening night below. Li Yuanjiao's black robe fluttered in the night, complementing Li Yuanxiu's pure white cloak. Having felt little fatherly love from a young age, he felt a profound sense of affection from his brother.

"Brother, you are much better than father!" he chirped cheerfully.

Li Pingyi, who was behind them, wished that he could cover both his ears at that very moment.

Li Yuanxiu stared sternly at Li Yuanjiao and said righteously, "What kind of talk is that?! Father is the most hardworking among all our elders. In his life, he has had little to take pride in but instead has had to act against his nature day after day... Now, in his mid-thirties, he already has a head full of gray hair. It's inevitable that he might neglect some aspects; you should be more understanding of father."

"Mhm," Li Yuanjiao chuckled, agreeing. Clutching his brother's cloak, he continued with a smile, "Brother, one day, our Li Family will surely defeat the Yu and An families under our leadership. United as brothers, we are much stronger than any Yu Mugao or Yu Muxian!"

Li Yuanxiu laughed heartily, patting his head, his eyes filled with laughter and hope. Together, they gazed at the moonlight, walking in silence.




# Chapter 171: Turmoil in Mount Yue

Eastern Mount Yue.

Mu Jiaoman lay on his bed, tormented by a burning sensation swirling in his mouth. His heart was cramping painfully, leaving him dry-mouthed and unable to speak.

"Great King! Oh...Great King!"

His wives and concubines wailed around him, their cries irritating him. He bit his lip and shouted with all his might.

"Shut up!"

Yet, his voice was so faint it came out sounding only like a murmur, and no one paid him any attention. They continued wailing, plunging him into further despair.

Under his rule, Eastern Mount Yue‚Äîthough not flourishing‚Äîhad improved significantly from the chaotic times in the past. The territory of Eastern Mount Yue had been expanding, with villages surrendering to them from time to time.

Mu Jiaoman, knowing Li Tongya was a cautious man, pretended that they had the support of Mount Wu to prevent Li Tongya from invading their territory. In a compromise, he opened the trade routes, allowing the Li Family to exchange some novel luxury items for the massive amount of food and materials in the hands of the mountain tribes' families.

By using the hundreds of thousands of mountain tribes as labor to support over a hundred thousand humans, they have managed to secure a lifeline.

Just as everything seemed to be improving, a demon wolf of the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm invaded the town. It had mysteriously traversed hundreds of miles of mountains and rivers without making a sound, appearing at the foot of his city.

Mu Jiaoman had no choice but to fight. Over the years, a few Qi Cultivators had emerged in Eastern Mount Yue, though they were nowhere near the level of those immortal cultivators since they had consumed various unrefined qi. Despite this, they were considered combat forces. However, since they were being stationed on the western front, reinforcements were too slow to arrive.

Hoping to hold out for a short while until reinforcement arrived, he did not expect the demon to possess several innate spells that left him in a bad position. In desperation, he sacrificed his blood qi and cast an ancient shamanic spell to call upon Mount Wu.

"Why is there no response..." Mu Jiaoman's mind went blank, his heart sinking into silence. Years of honed intuition led him to a grave realization.

"There's trouble on Mount Wu... This demon is definitely a probing pawn sent by a certain immortal cultivator!"

Using a shamanic spell to drain his life force, Mu Jiaoman finally repelled the demon. Now that he was lying on his luxurious jade bed, he realized his time had come.

As his wives and concubines wept, a roar interrupted them, "Out of the way!"

A burly Mount Yue tribesman, covered in talismanic tattoos, barged into the palace anxiously. The bone and jade he wore as jewelry clattered loudly.

Mu Jiaoman mustered his strength and muttered weakly, "You..."

"Sorry I'm late!" the man cried out. Upon seeing him, Mu Jiaoman suddenly became spirited, clutching his hand and murmuring, "Pass my position to Qimu... and kill all other sons and daughters! Make sure there are no survivors."

"Yes..." The Mount Yue tribesman answered.

"You must remember!", Mu Jiaoman emphasized as tears streamed down his face.
ùôõùíìùíÜùôöùíòùíÜùì´ùô£ùì∏ùô´ùìÆùíç.ùíÑùíêùì∂

"Ensure all other children are killed... Do not let them fall under the Li Family's control! Our tribe is silently enduring them, not submitting. Do you understand? Do you?!"

The burly man looked up with tears brimming in his eyes, tears that refused to fall. Mu Jiaoman's grip loosened, falling back onto the jade bed... lifeless. The Mount Yue tribesman wiped away his tears, lamenting loudly, "Your Majesty... Until we meet again!"

The city's bells tolled loudly, and Mount Yue soldiers scurried through the streets. Screams of killing and agony rose as the once high and mighty lords were dragged out and beheaded cleanly.

However, a dark gray ox cart had already left the city, making its way on the rugged Guli Road. Several figures jumped off the cart hastily and darted toward the woods to the east.

"That old man truly loved Qimu... Thankfully, we had informants in the palace, or we would have been slaughtered like pigs and dogs!" one of the men said.

"What should we do now, my lord?" voiced out another man. These men were clearly guards or advisors, and they closely followed their leader.

The man replied, "I heard that my aunt is also a concubine in the eastern lands. Our only option now is to flee east and seek refuge with her!"

They oriented themselves by the stars and plunged into the dense woods, vanishing from sight.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Tongya was in his cave dwelling, reading through the Law of Celestial Moon, silently practicing the moves and occasionally praising the work.

"Wonderful! Truly the peak of perfection!"

When Li Chejing returned home and wrote down the Celestial Moon Slash technique, Li Tongya was just a novice in the way of the sword, never realizing the sophistication of his younger brother's sword technique.

As he progressed year by year, grounded on the Celestial Moon Slash technique explained personally by Li Chejing combined with his own decent talent in swordsmanship, his skill soared, quickly grasping the essence of sword qi and finally appreciating the depth of his younger brother's understanding of the sword.

The explanations in the Law of Celestial Moon were clear and ingenious, significantly accelerating Li Tongya's slow swordsmanship progress over the past few months. Many previously perplexing issues became clear, and he estimated that it would now take less than ten years before he would be able to grasp the next realm of swordsmanship‚Äîthe Sword Essence.

The Celestial Moon Slash technique was merely the introductory form of this set of techniques, which included dozens of sophisticated combinations and variations that dazzled Li Tongya with admiration as he continued to practice diligently. Suddenly, there was a knock at the stone door.

"Who is it?" Li Tongya asked as he looked up, hearing his son Li Xuanling's familiar voice.

"Father, a Qi Cultivator from the Xiao Family has arrived. It seems we might need to host them."

"I understand," Li Tongya replied, pondering for a moment before standing up and leaving the cave dwelling with Li Xuanling waiting outside. Seeing his father emerge, Li Xuanling let out a sigh of relief.

Li Xuanling was in a difficult position. There was a significant status gap between the Qi Cultivation Realm and Embryonic Breathing Realm, and given the Xiao Family's favors toward the Li Family, not sending a Qi Cultivator to receive them could be seen as disrespectful.

Li Xuanfeng was in seclusion, and he could not afford to distract Li Xuanxuan, who was on the verge of a breakthrough to the Qi Cultivation Realm. Chen Donghe, though a Qi Cultivator, had no authority to make any decisions. It seemed that Li Tongya was the only remaining option as he was not in seclusion, hence the visit to the mountain to invite him.

Li Tongya put away the Law of Celestial Moon he was reading and, together with Li Xuanling, headed to the main courtyard atop Mount Lijing.

There, a man in his mid-twenties, dressed in a flowing robe and striking appearance, looked up at them. Surprised to see Li Tongya, he quickly stood up and cupped his fist before introducing himself.

"Xiao Ruyu from the Xiao Family! It's an honor to meet you."

Xiao Ruyu had expected Li Xuanfeng but was pleasantly surprised and slightly nervous to see Li Tongya.

Li Tongya is a peer of Clan Uncle Xiao Yongling and one of the most distinguished cultivators on the Guli Road...

With that in mind, Xiao Ruyu said with a smile, "Your reputation precedes you! My clan uncle often speaks highly of you and I've finally met you in person after hearing so much about you!"

His polite and dignified demeanor left a good impression on Li Tongya, who smiled graciously and replied softly, "Likewise, I've heard a lot about you from Xuanfeng... Your willingness to accompany him into dangerous territories shows bravery!"

"You're flattering me, Senior," he replied humbly.

After exchanging pleasantries, Xiao Ruyu decided to cut to the chase and stated the purpose of his visit.

"I've come for two main reasons... Firstly, with nine out of ten homes empty in the prefecture, we need to relocate people from other areas. The Li Family has the most people, and the Xiao Family is willing to pay a price..."

"That's hardly an issue," Li Tongya interrupted with a smile, "Our Li Family can provide up to a thousand male and female workers to your clan each year. There's no need for compensation between our families."

The Li Family was short on many things but definitely not people. The annual influx of refugees from Mount Yue posed a dilemma, complicating local settlements and risking cultural contamination. Sending them back seemed wasteful given their potential as a labor force.

In the seven years since the Li Family took over Mount Huaqian, the population soared from five thousand to almost twenty thousand, nearly reaching half the size of a prefecture city. Without the support from the several hundred thousand Mount Yue tribesmen to the west, the Li Family would indeed face challenges.




# Chapter 172: The Xiao Family's Scheme

"Thank you, Senior!" Xiao Ruyu thanked as he cupped his fist, but he did not wish to owe a favor to the Li Family over a few thousand mortals.

Shifting the conversation tactfully, he chose his next words with great thought and care.

"However, before leaving, my elders specifically instructed that the closer the two families are, the more such minor details must be clearly settled to avoid any potential future complications. Keeping this in mind, I dare not take advantage of your generosity..."

Seeing him handle the matter so cleanly and with such propriety, Li Tongya regarded him even more highly.

"What do you suggest then?"

"For every batch of mortals delivered to Lixia Prefecture, our Xiao Family will compensate one Spirit Stone for every thousand mortals."

Xiao Ruyu's offer was considered generous. After all, with the Azure Pond Sect setting a precedent, all families looked up to the sect's actions. Without proper regulation, the mortals under their control were merely seen as resources to be exploited. Save for a few cultivators with special needs who might value them, most looked down upon them.

"Alright, let's settle it that way then!" Li Tongya said in agreement.

Xiao Ruyu nodded, then brought up another matter, "There's also another reason for my visit... The Guli Road hasn't been maintained over a long time, with many paths becoming overgrown and hazardous due to roaming beasts. This has led to a disruption in communication between families and only those who have attained the Qi Cultivation Realm can traverse the prefecture freely, which poses a significant inconvenience! Our Xiao Family wishes to restore the Guli Road, establishing relay stations at the borders of each family's territory. In areas where there are gaps, the Xiao Family will fill them. This way even the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators and commoners can travel for trade, thus benefiting all families along the Guli Road."

"Oh?"

Li Tongya was surprised that the Xiao Family would undertake such a thankless task.

He pondered briefly before speaking.

"For the Xiao Family to lead this effort benefits my Li Family greatly, and naturally, I have no reason to disagree. However, if I may be so bold, why would your esteemed family bother with such a thankless task?"

Li Tongya was never one to meddle unnecessarily but given the long-standing friendship between their families and the kindness shown by Xiao Yuansi and Xiao Chuting to the Li Family, he attempted to dissuade them.

"Thank you for your concern, Senior." Xiao Ruyu simply smiled.

On his way through Guli Road, he had met with many families, all of whom had readily agreed, though they probably were laughing behind his back. Only Li Tongya cared enough to offer advice, and Xiao Ruyu was grateful for that.

He then went on to explain, "The Xiao Family collaborates with many clans in alchemy and smithing, supporting a third of the cultivators within Lixia Prefecture's influence... This is crucial for our family's expenditures. If we lose access to medicinal herbs and spirit minerals, it would be a significant loss. We're interested in the spirit resources along Guli Road... and I'm afraid I can't reveal more. I hope you understand."

This explanation along with Xiao Chuting's quiet achievement of the Purple Mansion Realm allowed Li Tongya to connect the dots in his mind. He had his suspicions but chose not to press any further.

"That's fine," he replied after a moment of contemplation.

After discussing and arranging the distribution of the relay stations, Xiao Ruyu respectfully took his leave.

Li Xuanling escorted him out of the courtyard, watching him ride the wind eastward before returning to the courtyard. He saw Li Tongya sitting silently with a tea bowl in hand and after a moment of silence, he inquired, "Father, the Xiao Family has connections with Mushroom Forest Plain and the families of Linghai Prefecture, with long-term trade relations. Are they perhaps afraid someone will cut off the trade flow from the east..? Who has such power to prevent the families from dealing with the Xiao Family?"

Li Tongya put down his tea bowl and shook his head in response.

"The Xiao Family is probably planning to break away from Azure Pond Sect and stand on its own."

"What?!"

Li Xuanling was stunned, then his expression quickly turned to alarm. He said hoarsely, "This... They actually dare to do that knowing that the Azure Pond Sect currently has three early-stage Purple Mansion Realm, one mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm, and even a peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivator like Chi Wei...?"

"The Xiao Family is waiting for Chi Wei to pass away," Li Tongya said matter-of-factly, narrowing his eyes. He had analyzed the situation in his head and was feeling fairly certain of such a speculation.

Narrowing his eyes, he then said softly, "With Xiao Chuting having reached the Purple Mansion Realm, they have the standing to come to the fore... Didn't the Chen Family also declare independence on the spot when a Purple Mansion Realm elder emerged among them? Among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of Azure Pond Sect, only Chi Wei has the power to eliminate Xiao Chuting on the spot. Once Chi Wei dies, it's only natural for the Xiao Family to break away from Azure Pond Sect, taking over this battered Lixia Prefecture‚Äîbacked by Mushroom Forest Plain and Moongaze Lake. The Azure Pond Sect might even have to present congratulatory gifts to them."

"Purple Mansion Realm..." Li Xuanling murmured, sighing deeply. "The families and the three sects and seven gates are just tools in the hands of those in the Purple Mansion Realm..."

"Once they break away from Azure Pond Sect, which family in the prefecture would dare to trade with the Xiao Family across borders? Naturally, the Xiao Family will have to look for new sources and targets for dumping their goods, hence moving westward, restoring the Guli Road, and targeting the scattered families around Mushroom Forest Plain and Moongaze Lake without a large prefecture city."

Having finished his lengthy explanation, Li Tongya felt more assured in his deductions, left pondering to himself.

But how should our Li Family preserve itself and seek benefits amidst such upheaval..? Diverting trouble eastward, thus changing the current situation in Moongaze Lake where the Yu Family dominates alone.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Yuanjiao stood in the courtyard with a sword in hand, facing a girl with her hair tied up. Her almond eyes were fixed on the sword in his grasp. After circling each other in the yard for a while, Li Yuanjiao noticed her agile footwork, likely focusing on swift and unpredictable moves. He thrust his practice wooden sword toward her face, closing the distance.

The girl countered with her wooden spear, retreating a few steps and using her left hand to parry Li Yuanjiao's sword. She chuckled and said, "You're really cunning, Brother Jiao."

"Hmph."

Li Yuanjiao snorted lightly, also stepping backward and putting away his sword. "There's nothing cunning about it. It's just that your spear technique is solid enough to block a few of my moves, Qinghong!" he scoffed.

Li Qinghong giggled, aware that she had been at a disadvantage earlier, and conceded, "It's naturally easier to learn with a family sword technique. I've even sought the best spear teacher from the mountain foot, yet I'm still struggling..."

"Why bother with a spear when there's a family sword technique to practice? Spear techniques are easy to start but hard to master without proper guidance. You could spend a lifetime failing to get anywhere," Li Yuanjiao frowned, gazing intently at her with a serious expression.

Li Qinghong, however, placed her spear against the wall and explained, "The thought of practicing the sword technique gave me a headache! Father brought various weapons for me to choose from, and they said longer weapons have an advantage, so I chose the spear. Father was very pleased and encouraged me to keep at it."

Seeing that it was Li Xuanling's decision, Li Yuanjiao abandoned the idea of persuading her to switch to swordsmanship. Hanging up his wooden sword and straightening his robe, Li Qinghong also leaned her spear against the corner and began to undo her hair. The practice had left a rosy tint on her face, lending her a feminine charm.

A respectful voice came from outside after a double knock on the door.

"Young Master, Madam is calling for you!"

"Got it," Li Yuanjiao replied, seeing an old servant at the door with his head bowed. He was the one who usually served his mother.

"Did something happen?" Li Yuanjiao asked, slightly worried.

"Some people from Eastern Mount Yue came saying that... Mu Jiaoman had passed away due to serious injuries last night," the servant replied after a brief moment of hesitation.

Li Yuanjiao's eyes sparkled, showing no emotional disturbance over the death of this uncle he had never met. Instead, he was visibly excited. Seeing Li Qinghong laughing beside him, he turned and asked, "What's so funny?"

Li Qinghong, though not fully aware of the details, sensed intuitively that this was a good omen.
ùôõùíìùìÆùôöùîÄùíÜùíÉùì∑ùíêùìøùôöùìµ.ùôòùíêùíé

Suppressing a smile, she looked up at him cheekily as she replied, "Nothing much... just that it's good news!"

"Hehe." Li Yuanjiao giggled, then hurried out of the courtyard, bursting with excitement.

"The nine towns and twenty-six tribes of Eastern Mount Yue will soon all belong to our family!"




# Chapter 173: Shamoli

Shamoli, along with a few loyal members of his tribe, snuck through the forest for several days and nights, not daring to look back or light a fire to cook. When hungry, they ate a few fruits; when thirsty, they scooped up water to drink. They had finally managed to escape the territory of Eastern Mount Yue.

Upon encountering the bustling and affluent towns of the Easterners filled with throngs of people, they were stupefied by the sight. Disguised as refugees from Mount Yue, they were taken into custody and could only watch from a distance as the lively scenes of horse-drawn carriages and cloud-like canopies moved westward; the sound of opera drifting in the air.

"This Eastern lifestyle... it's practically divine!" Shamoli remarked in awe, finally understanding why the slaves were so desperate to flee eastward.

After being confined for several hours, Shamoli noticed an opulently dressed Mount Yue tribesman approaching. His spirits lifted immediately. This person was a former vassal of the Mulu Family who had disappeared years ago, presumably to enjoy life in the East.

Shamoli quickly called out to him in their native Mount Yue language.

"Hey, skinny... look this way!"

That person's expression turned into annoyance almost immediately, and he looked toward the direction of the shout. Suddenly, bursting with joy, he shouted loudly, "Quick, seize that man! He is a royal descendant of Eastern Mount Yue!"

Shamoli, who possessed the strength of the third stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm, did not resist and was meekly taken away, eventually thrown into a courtyard paved with stone slabs.

Kneeling on the cold, smooth ground, Shamoli looked up timidly to see a young man about fourteen or fifteen years old staring back at him. The youth's stern appearance and penetrating gray eyes gave off an overwhelming sense of authority.

"Greet... Greetings, Your Majesty!"

Shamoli speculated that this imposing figure was likely Li Xuanxuan, who appeared youthful due to attaining the Qi Cultivation Realm early in life. Despite this, Li Xuanxuan was still his uncle.

"You must be joking," Li Yuanxiu responded with a slight smile, amused by the unexpected turn of events. He had to suppress the urge to burst into laughter at the thought of having such an advantage over Mount Yue, courteously engaging with the trembling Mount Yue prince while sizing him up mentally.

"I am Li Yuanxiu, the eldest legitimate son of the family head. I believe we are of the same generation," Li Yuanxiu began as he introduced himself.

It was only at this moment that Shamoli learned that he was speaking to the heir of the Easterner King. He smiled at Li Yuanxiu politely and was about to speak when another person resembling Li Yuanxiu came in, interrupting him.

The newcomer had shorter eyebrows and longer eyes, giving off a more predatory aura. Shamoli instinctively bowed his head in fear.

"Yuanjiao is overjoyed to hear that a cousin has come to visit!" the newcomer announced as he approached.

Shamoli's face immediately lit up with joy, thinking this person must be his support in the East. "Ah, so you're Brother Jiao! Your reputation precedes you! You're even better looking than I expected," he quickly added hastily.

Li Yuanjiao curled his lips, stood next to Li Yuanxiu, and stared at the people below. The people from Mount Yue knew that he was a descendant of the Mulu Family and given the way he had treated them, they all looked up to him in admiration.

"I've heard about your father's incident... would you be willing to explain it to us again so that we can understand the whole story?" Li Yuanxiu asked leisurely as he took his seat, holding his cup of tea in his hand.

Shamoli trembled in his seat and quickly replied, "Yes... of course!"

He quickly narrated the events surrounding Mu Jiaoman's death in detail, taking nearly half an hour to explain everything in great detail without leaving out anything. Only then did the surrounding people finally understand and begin whispering among themselves.

Li Yuanxiu waved his hand, his expression slightly shifting, disappointed at how foolish Shamoli was.

I specifically called everyone here to let him state the facts, yet this simpleton really just laid it all flat out, not even trying to smear some dirt on his older brother to give my Li Family a pretext to intervene! Truly a waste of my kindness...

Looking up at the others in the room, Li Yuanxiu softly commanded, "I'd like to speak privately with Shamoli. I'll have to ask the elders to step out for now."

A few clan elders frowned and were about to speak, but Li Yuanjiao hummed and stepped forward, staring them down. Knowing they had no choice, they left reluctantly. As the clan elders left, the crowd quickly dispersed like the tide, leaving only the clan soldiers behind and the two brothers Li Yuanxiu and Li Yuanjiao. Li Qiuyang stood beside Shamoli, preventing him from ambushing anyone.

Li Yuanxiu quickly left his seat and took Shamoli's hand with a friendly gesture, smiling as he said, "Brother Shamoli, with the elders around earlier, Yuanxiu couldn't speak freely. We are sort of relatives, so formality isn't needed between us!"

Shamoli was stunned, not expecting Li Yuanxiu to be so approachable, stuttering without daring to speak. Li Yuanxiu then continued, "When your father was critically injured, Lord Qimu usurped the throne and against the former king's wishes, he slaughtered the other lords... truly an unfilial act! Since my Li Family has promised to protect Eastern Mount Yue, we can't sit by and do nothing! Please rest assured."

These words left Shamoli dumbfounded. His mind went blank right away, doubting internally if he had failed to make the story clear. It was his father who passed the position to Qimu and personally ordered the execution of his other sons, but in Li Yuanxiu's mouth, the story changed completely...

Shamoli looked at Li Yuanxiu's smiling face, and a spark of realization flashed through his mind instantly. A trembling surge of desire that he had long suppressed, thinking the throne was beyond his reach, suddenly made him shiver with both joy and horror.

He immediately replied with great eagerness.

"Yes... Yes! Lord Qimu took advantage of the king's critical injuries to usurp the throne and then, against the king's wishes, slaughtered many lords..."

Li Yuanxiu was relieved to see this simpleton finally grasp the situation and sighed in relief as if a burden had been lifted off his chest.

"Your father could also be considered Brother Jiao's uncle, and this offense is an affront to the Li Family as well. You should enjoy your stay at the foot of the mountain for now and take in the scenery of the East, which is quite different from Mount Yue. I will report this to the elders and then come find you," he said with a smile.

Shamoli's mind was ablaze with visions of returning to Mount Yue to reclaim his throne.

He nodded in agreement before snapping back to reality, fervently saying, "I cannot possibly repay the great kindness of the esteemed Li Family! I am willing to pave the way for the Li Family, to guard the West for the Li Family, and to pay tribute annually!"

Li Yuanxiu waved his hand, speechless at how off-point Shamoli was, thinking to himself.

Guarding the West and paying annual tribute... how is that any different from how it is practiced now..? Shamoli really can't get to the point, showing no sensitivity to the situation at all!

After such thoughts, Li Yuanxiu nodded and left the courtyard to go up the mountain, leaving Shamoli and Li Yuanjiao to stare at each other.

Shamoli was still lost in his daydreams when Li Yuanjiao glanced at him and patted the shoulder of his distant relative, whispering in his ear, "Our Eastern beauties and music are the most renowned... Cousin might as well go have a look."

"Ah..! Sure..." Shamoli mumbled as he left the courtyard in a daze.

Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao nodded to Li Qiuyang, whispering to him, "I'll leave the rest up to you, Clan Uncle. Please select some singers and dancers carefully, we must ensure Shamoli leaves behind a few offspring who stay in the town to study. Only by achieving this can we truly hold Mount Yue in our grasp."

"I understand."

Li Qiuyang nodded and cupped his fist before leaving, not showing any disrespect to Li Yuanjiao just because he was younger.




# Chapter 174: Scheming Against Mount Yue

Li Yuanxiu stepped onto the mountain along the stone path, finding the courtyard quiet and serene. Most of the elders were secluded in cultivation, only Li Xuanling was in the garden, holding a tea bowl in one hand and a white jade slip titled River Crossing Torrential Step in the other

Noticing Li Yuanxiu's joyful entrance, he softly inquired, "What brings you such joy?"

"Eastern Mount Yue was attacked by a demon beast, Mu Jiaoman died a sudden death, and his son, Shamoli, has sought refuge with our family... He's waiting at the foot of the mountain as we speak," Li Yuanxiu explained as he shared the news, to which Li Xuanling promptly placed down his tea bowl with a nod.

"Good news indeed!" he remarked, beaming.

Observing Li Yuanxiu's eager look, Li Xuanling then asked, "You seem to have some plans in mind..?"

"Exactly!"

Li Yuanxiu cupped his fist and nodded eagerly, having clearly thought through his strategy.

He proposed, "With Shamoli in our grasp, our natural course is to support him as the leader of Eastern Mount Yue. However, this is quite a complex matter. While we hold Shamoli, we mustn't underestimate Mount Wu. It's prudent to gather intelligence before making any decisive moves."

"Well said," Li Xuanling nodded with a serious expression on his face. He then inquired, "What kind of person is Shamoli?"

"I've met him before. He appears naive and simple-minded... Even so, we must be wary of him, in case he's putting up a facade for our family to see. For now, we'll entertain him with singers and dancers to probe his intentions. Ideally, he'll father a few children here," Li Yuanxiu explained.

"Oh?" Li Xuanling pondered after a pause, "He's not a Qi Cultivator yet, is he..?"

"No," Li Yuanxiu met Li Xuanling's gaze, both having the same thought in mind.

Li Yuanxiu then suggested, "We have a copy of Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique. Once he has offspring here, we can bind him with a spiritual oath and grant him this technique without telling him about its side effect of infertility. Grateful as he might be, once he returns to Eastern Mount Yue, regardless of his future ambitions, he'll have no descendants! Inevitably, we'll have to send a king's heir we've raised, thus keeping everything within our control."

Li Xuanling nodded in agreement, picking up where Li Yuanxiu left off, speaking softly, "We need not refine an entire portion of Profound Yin Thunder Liquid. Just extract ten to twenty percent of it and mix it into various unrefined qi for his cultivation will suffice... Even if the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique is potent, what could possibly come of cultivating with such unrefined qi? Once he attains the Qi Cultivation Realm, he'll only be mediocre at best, preventing him from becoming too powerful and slipping out of our control with a Grade Three technique!"

Li Yuanxiu nodded vigorously, his thoughts in sync with Li Xuanling. It took them just a few words to each other to concoct a plot tightly ensnaring Shamoli.

Li Xuanling chuckled, then said seriously, "Though we've made this plan, I still need to discuss it with your father to keep him informed. He's privy to many secrets, and we might as well inquire about Mount Wu."

Li Yuanxiu cupped his fist and replied, "Then I shall proceed with making arrangements. Shamoli shows a particular fondness for Brother Jiao, so his involvement will be crucial in this matter."

"I trust that you'll do a good job," Li Xuanling encouraged with a satisfied smile. After a moment of thought, he then patted his storage pouch and pulled out several jade boxes.

"These contain spirit fruits of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, mostly gifts from other families. They're good for improving cultivation progress. Our family doesn't have any recipes to make them into pills, but direct consumption can lead to a shaky foundation, thus complicating future cultivation. Therefore, they've remained unused and are losing spiritual qi to the extent of nearly becoming ordinary fruits now," he explained.

"Take these spirit fruits and offer them to Shamoli when the time is right to accelerate his cultivation progress, ensuring his progress matches our pace. It'll be good to elevate him to the Qi Cultivation Realm as soon as possible so we can put him to good use," he instructed.

"Got it!"

Li Yuanxiu took the jade boxes and said respectfully, "Uncle's plans never cease to amaze! Xiu'er will get everything done."

Watching him leave the courtyard, Li Xuanling mulled over the entire plan once more before heading to Mount Meiche to find Li Tongya.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

"Mu Jiaoman died a sudden death..?" Li Tongya muttered as he placed down the jade slip just as Li Xuanling finished recounting the turmoil in Mount Yue. A flicker of doubt crossed his mind.

Mu Jiaoman had ways to communicate with Mount Wu. Logically, he could have enlisted the help of Qi Cultivators from Mount Wu by offering something in return. It's puzzling why he'd just let himself be killed by a demon beast...

After pondering for a moment, Li Tongya recalled Xiao Yuansi's mention of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from Mount Yue nearing the end of his lifespan.

Given Mount Yue's history, this Purple Mansion Realm cultivator likely had the highest seniority among them and hence most respected, living nearly six hundred years through several extensions of life via secret methods.

"The figure from Mount Wu is probably attempting to break through to the Golden Core Realm. With the Xiao Family also at a critical juncture, it's best to send a letter to inform them and to inquire about the specifics. This will allow us to gauge Mount Wu's current hold over Mount Yue," Li Tongya suggested.

"Get Donghe here," he instructed.

Li Xuanling nodded and left. Li Tongya picked up a jade slip but after a brief consideration, opted instead for a sheet of cheaper spirit cloth to write a concise letter.

After sealing the letter, he resumed reading the jade slip.

Chen Donghe had attained the Qi Cultivation Realm for over four years now and was currently in the early stages of the second heavenly layer. He consumed proper Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth for his Qi Cultivation and practiced with an authentic technique, thus possessing a pure true essence.

He approached respectfully.

"Greetings, Senior!"

Li Tongya waved his hand, then handed the letter to him and said, "Please take a trip to the prefecture and deliver this letter directly to Senior Xiao Yuansi of the Xiao Family. If he can write a reply immediately, then bring it back with you."

"Understood!" Chen Donghe cupped his fist and took his leave, riding the wind out of the cave dwelling.

Li Tongya turned back to look at Li Xuanling standing beside him and quietly asked, "Have you managed to condense the Nascent Spirit Chakra?"

"Yes, Father! I just broke through last month."

Li Tongya scanned his son with his spiritual sense and nodded approvingly. "You are twenty-five this year. This pace is just right, no need to rush. With a few more years of diligent practice, you should be able to break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm before turning thirty."

"I will keep your advice in mind," Li Xuanling replied respectfully and then shared the plan that he and Li Yuanxiu came up with.

Li Tongya listened impassively and responded, "Yuanxiu is thoughtful! Eastern Mount Yue sends not only many spirit items but also a large quantity of food and materials to the east every year, which are crucial for the livelihood of over a hundred thousand people under our Li Family's rule. This also indirectly affects the abundance of offerings for next year's sacrificial ritual. If Mount Wu is indeed preoccupied, we can boldly take further control of Eastern Mount Yue!"

"I understand. But what if that person from Mount Yue attains the Golden Core Realm..?" inquired Li Xuanling, forever a cautious person.

Li Tongya smiled and explained, "In the path of cultivation, it's always best to break through as early as possible on a stable foundation. Those Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who wait until their lifespan is nearly over and force themselves to break through as their vitality wane, show that they're uncertain about their breakthrough."

"I've also reviewed numerous historical records. After the war between immortals and devils, the Yue State was established, and some individuals broke through to the Golden Core Realm in that period. Later, when the Moonlight Origin Mansion withdrew from the world and the three sects and seven gates emerged, there has not been any cultivator breaking through to the Golden Core Realm since then‚Äîlet alone those from Mount Yue."




# Chapter 175: The Changing Situation

Shamoli spent several months on the territory of the Easterners, finally understanding what true enjoyment meant. The sight of those veiled, graceful dancers nearly made his eyes pop out of their sockets.0

A few of the Li Family's younger members took him to watch operas, hunt, taste wine, stroll through markets, and participate in cockfights and dog races. Every day was filled with delightful living.0

"Damn it, the folks in the west are really a bunch of fools!"0

Shamoli finally realized why those tribesmen from Mout Yue who returned from the east often looked down upon their western counterparts. Life in the east was completely different, it was relaxing and comfortable. The only headache for Shamoli was the complex and sensitive political life in the east.0

Whenever Shamoli spoke, nine times out of ten, his words would offend someone, leading them to silence him with displeased faces. Unintentionally offending people became a routine until he learned to be cautious, choosing to stay quiet and just smiling happily unless absolutely necessary.0

"Young master!"0

When Shamoli came back to his senses, he saw someone approaching him. After a moment of recollection, he realized that this person was Li Yuanxiu's half-brother, which in Shamoli's view was akin to a royal family's distant relative.0

He quickly replied, "Greetings, brother!"0

The man was slightly taken aback, but since he was accustomed to Shamoli's bluntness, he did not take it to heart. He smiled and asked, "Do you like these dancers?"0

"Yes! Of course, I like them," Shamoli immediately grinned. After spending a few days here, he figured out a pattern‚Äîif he expressed his liking for something, nine times out of ten, it would be delivered to his room the next day.0

"The only downside is the strict rules of the Easterners. Unlike at home where you can just drag away anyone you fancy, here, you can only have these dancers..." Shamoli sighed in regret.0

Just then, the courtyard gate creaked open, and a young man in a black robe entered. Upon seeing him, everyone else bowed their heads in silence while Shamoli's eyes lit up. "Brother Jiao!" he called out warmly.0

Li Yuanjiao entered the room, glanced around, and was pleased that the useless ones in the family could finally contribute. They got along well with Shamoli and had likely extracted a lot of information from him.0

Seeing Shamoli's visibly flushed face from mild intoxication, Li Yuanjiao placed a jade box on the table in front of Shamoli, saying with a smile, "I got some spirit fruits recently and immediately thought of you, cousin. These are for you!"0

Shamoli was overjoyed, thinking to himself, Li Yuanjiao really is my pillar in the Li Family. He has brought me several gifts these past months, each of them excellent spirit items!0

Shamoli expressed his gratitude as he took the jade box, pondering over how much he could fetch for such a spirit fruit. Naturally, Li Yuanjiao was well aware of his thoughts. He knew Shamoli's daily activities like the back of his hand.0

Li Yuanjiao then reminded him, "Cousin, I hope you still remember the great endeavor of reclaiming your throne!"0

"Of course I remember!" Shamoli's already red face turned a shade deeper. During his first few days in the town, he remained focused on his endeavor of reclaiming the throne thanks to Li Yuanxiu's constant reminders. But lately, he had almost pushed the matter to the back of his mind, engrossed in daily pleasures.0

"I must speak frankly, cousin. If you can't even attain the Qi Cultivation Realm, you won't be able to stay on the throne even if our family managed to place you there... You need to remember this clearly!"0

This warning stunned Shamoli, sending a shiver down his spine, cursing himself internally for even considering selling the fruit.0

Gratefully, he said, "Thank you for the reminder. I'm extremely grateful! After arriving here, I've already broken through to the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. I will definitely focus on my cultivation from now on and break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm as soon as possible!"0

Li Yuanjiao nodded and left, leaving Shamoli in the courtyard, his gaze still fixated on the dancers. Meanwhile, everyone else was looking at him.0

Shamoli looked in the direction Li Yuanjiao had gone, then cleared his throat and said, "Continue dancing, tonight will be the last... I-I'll start cultivating tomorrow!"0

Li Qiuyang, standing at the side with a sword, remained silent. Assigned to protect Shamoli, he had been by his side day and night and had come to understand the nature of this young man quite well. He sighed quietly, thinking to himself, The lineage of the Mulu clan is decent. Although this guy is just a self-indulgent scion, he still managed to reach the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm in his twenties! How unfair‚Ä¶0

Touching his graying sideburns, Li Qiuyang realized that he was already forty-five years old. Yet, he had only just condensed the Jade Capital Chakra and attained the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. A wave of sorrow washed over him.0

My cultivation speed has been declining day by day. After sixty, cultivators of both the Embryonic Breathing Realm and Qi Cultivation Realm will see a drop in their blood qi. I wonder if I'll ever break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm in this lifetime, to fly with my qi and roam the heavens and earth‚Ä¶0

I started on the path of immortality at eight and seized every moment to cultivate diligently‚Ä¶ I've never squandered my time away outside from completing the tasks required by my family. Yet, I might end up dying just like any other mortal, while this self-indulgent scion who spends his nights in revelry, is on the verge of reaching Qi Cultivation Realm... Life is really unfair.1

Hiding in the shadows, Li Qiuyang looked increasingly aged, harboring a barely suppressible longing.0

Uncle Tongya has watched me grow up since I was a child and naturally harbors a bit of affection for me as a younger family member‚Ä¶ If I ask him for a pill, perhaps I still have a chance to break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm in this lifetime..?"0

Li Qiuyang, lost in thought, could not help but let a wistful smile cross his face, only to abruptly quell his longing. He scolded himself internally.0

With all these talented juniors emerging in the family, not to mention Yuanxiu and Yuanjiao, even Qinghong is making rapid progress. How could I justify wasting precious pills on an old man like me?0

Li Qiuyang bit back his impulse, resigning himself to silence, observing Shamoli without uttering a word. This middle-aged man had dedicated most of his life to the family's cause but yet‚Ä¶ in the end, he refrained from asking for a single pill from the family.6

"Hahahahaha, how charming!"0

Shamoli's laughter echoed in the courtyard, the dim light reflecting off Li Qiuyang's gray hair, highlighting his age even more. He seemed out of place amidst the lavish scene. Like a statue, he silently watched over Shamoli as instructed by his family.2

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî0

"Senior, the Xiao Family has received the letter and asked me to bring back their reply, expressing their thanks."0

Chen Donghe knocked on the door of the cave dwelling, presenting a jade slip to Li Tongya. He accepted it and scanned it with his spiritual sense.0

Xiao Yuansi's warm voice filled his mind.0

Having received Brother Tongya's message today, our ancestor has already made a trip into the territory of Mount Yue. With Mount Wu sealed off and left unable to attend to other matters, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of Mount Yue is preparing for a breakthrough to the Golden Core Realm within the next six to seven years, during which signs will surely appear in the heavens and earth.0

Within the sect, I've also learned that all twelve disciples of Mount Wu are Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators who have already made deals with the three sects and seven gates. Once this Purple Mansion Realm dies, Mount Wu will cease to exist, with its Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators each leading people to join the three sects and seven gates.0

It's possible that three or four of them will remain within Mount Yue to establish their own sects or families under Azure Pond's governance. If your clan has any ambitions, you must act swiftly after that person's death to take advantage of such an opportunity. Once the situation stabilizes and Mount Yue's Foundation Establishment Realm has divided the territory and established relations with the sect, any further plots will become difficult!

After reading the jade slip, Li Tongya pondered for a while, formulating a plan in his mind. After a while, he turned and instructed Chen Donghe, "Get Xuanling here."0

Li Xuanling, already waiting at the entrance, entered upon hearing the call.0

Chen Donghe excused himself and Li Tongya whispered softly to him, "Read this jade slip."0

After Xuanling read it, he lowered his head in thought, then heard Li Tongya say, "With Mount Wu about to vanish, the west will see the rise of several Foundation Establishment Realm families under Azure Pond's governance. Our Li Family can seize this opportunity amidst the turmoil to take over Eastern Mount Yue."0

Li Xuanling nodded in agreement, then listened as Li Tongya declared solemnly, "Help Shamoli attain the Qi Cultivation Realm swiftly. As Mount Wu remains sealed, we shall assist Shamoli ascend the throne under the guise of minor upheaval and secretly gain control over Eastern Mount Yue. Once Mount Yue's Purple Mansion Realm cultivator dies, we'll immediately claim Eastern Mount Yue for our Li Family using the Azure Pond Sect's name. Those Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators from Mount Yue, having just lost their backing, won't dare to act rashly!"0

"I understand," Li Xuanling replied in a respectful tone, pondering for a moment before speaking softly, "When those Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators have divided their territories and become part of Azure Pond Sect, they will learn of the Sword Immortal's fame and would not dare to oppose our family. It's likely they will even seek to ingratiate themselves with us like the Yu Family. If handled properly, our Li Family can gain the territory of Eastern Mountain Yue without any effort!"0

"Correct!" Li Tongya nodded, then proceeded to give him his next instructions.0

"There are still a few years left, take a Snake Essence Pill with you, and feed Shamoli with them until he reaches the Qi Cultivation Realm."0

Nurturing Shamoli to reach the Qi Cultivation Realm within six years was somewhat challenging, but not impossible. After all, it only required breaking through two stages, unlike normal cultivation which required steady progress step by step. They could just invest in him with Spirit Stones and spirit fruits without caring about the stability of his foundation. Besides, the consumption of unrefined qi was easier than proper spiritual qi from the environment. However, this also meant that his cultivation progress would suffer in the future, forever unable to attain the Foundation Establishment Realm.0

"I'll make sure it happens!" Li Xuanling replied, ready to leave when Li Tongya suddenly stopped him, asking, "Who is currently looking after Shamoli?"0

"It's Brother Qiuyang, Father," Li Xuanling answered.0

Li Tongya calculated the time, saying gravely, "Li Qiuyang should be around forty-five by now, and I heard he had just recently broken through to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm... Shamoli is an outsider after all. Although these spirit items are for acquiring the territory of Eastern Mountain Yue, we can't explicitly say so. Qiuyang has never requested anything from the family aside from the usual allowance of Spirit Paddies and Spirit Stones over the years. I fear he might perceive this situation as unfair... Call him over."4

Li Xuanling quickly nodded and left. Not long after, there was a gentle knock at the stone door of the cave, and Li Qiuyang's respectful voice came from outside the door.0

"Greetings from Li Qiuyang, Clan Uncle!"0

"Come in."0

Li Tongya put down the jade slip he was holding, glanced at the white hair at Li Qiuyang's sideburns, and said warmly, "In my memory, you're still that little boy on the platform, getting tested for a spiritual orifice. Time really flies, and in the blink of an eye, you have your own large family and have become one of the elders! Your diligent and earnest effort over the years has not gone unnoticed by me."0

Li Qiuyang slightly bowed his head, his eyes moist. He then replied apprehensively, "If not for the family, I would just be an old farmer tending the fields today‚Ä¶ I am grateful for the family's kindness and dare not be negligent."1

Li Tongya nodded approvingly, flipping his hand to reveal a small brocade pouch. His expression turned warm.0

"You're a cultivator at the Jade Capital Stage now, yet you don't even have a storage pouch. This is an old one that I used in my youth. It doesn't have a very large capacity, but you can use it for now."0

"Absolutely not!" Li Qiuyang was shocked, knowing the storage pouch was worth a dozen or two Spirit Stones, far beyond what he could afford.0

His usual allowance went to cultivation, and he could not even produce half a Spirit Stone from his pockets. He repeatedly protested, "I can't possibly accept this!"0

Li Tongya waved his hand dismissively and tied the brocade pouch around Li Qiuyang's waist. He clapped his own storage pouch and took out a small jade bottle.0

"This is a Snake Essence Pill, refined by our family. Take it for now. If you can't break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, come back up the mountain to find me," he said softly.0

Li Qiuyang was stunned, his eyes reddening but he found himself unable to refuse such a tempting offer that could potentially let him live for another hundred years.0

He stammered in gratitude, "Thank you‚Ä¶ for this kindness that I do not deserve!"0

Li Tongya said sternly, "Nonsense! You deserve this more than the younger generations in the family! Over the past thirty years, you have taken care of our spirit fields, guarded the mine, and eliminated demon beasts. There's no one more dedicated in our family than you!"4

Tears welled up in Li Qiuyang's eyes as he continuously thanked him. Li Tongya comforted him with kind words before sending him off from the cave dwelling.0

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî0

Meanwhile in An Residence on Mount Huazhong‚Ä¶0

An Jingming stopped in front of the grand and luxurious hall. Today, his father, An Zheyan, was again feasting in the hall. This hall began construction the day An Zheyan became the family head and was completed on the day of An Jingming's birth. However‚Ä¶underneath its splendor lay the bones of countless craftsmen.0

An Jingming sighed softly, his eyes filled with confusion which quickly turned to anger as he looked at the lively scene.0

With the Yu Family in the north coveting our lands, the Li Family in the south rising like the sun, and even the Ding Family we brought here growing ambitiously bold, our family still feels no sense of crisis and indulges in luxury!1

An Jingming strode forward angrily, only to encounter several mortals bowing their heads as they passed, carrying a large basket dripping with blood. The fear on their faces was palpable, and they dared not meet his gaze.0

"What's going on?!" An Jingming roared as he blocked their path, his voice cold. The mortals had no choice but to drop the basket and kneel, revealing several fingers that rolled out toward An Jingming's feet.0

"The... the bear paw the Family Head ate today..."0

An Jingming closed his eyes, already understanding the situation. An Zheyan was not lustful or greedy, but had an insatiable appetite and was brutally cruel. Any dissatisfaction with the cooks' work led to executions; a poorly stewed bear paw resulted in chopping off the chef's fingers, and an undercooked pork shoulder meant cutting off the chef's legs. Daily, cries could be heard from the mountain hall.0

"Never mind, I get it already."0

An Jingming shook his head, feeling powerless as he could reprimand anyone in the family except his father.0

Stepping into the grand hall, he found An Zheyan drinking with a stern face but smiling upon seeing An Jingming. He called out to him, "My family's pride and hope has arrived!"0

"Father," An Jingming greeted him respectfully and then said, "I have something to tell you."0

"What is it?" An Zheyan frowned, distracted by the stewed bear paw, not expecting An Jingming to solemnly say, "The day of our death and the annihilation of the An family is imminent!"




# Chapter 177: Father and Son of the An Family

At the head of the table, An Zheyan was toying with a piece of bear paw on his plate. Hearing these words, he raised his eyebrows and pushed up the leather hat on his head. His expression immediately shifted, now marked by fleshy folds as he visibly tensed. He said sternly, "What do you mean by that?"

An Zheyan's tone was relatively gentle, devoid of any reproach, indicating that An Jingming truly was the apple of his eye. Any other clan member who dared to utter such words would have been executed on the spot; only from An Jingming's mouth would these words prompt An Zheyan to take him seriously.

"The Yu Family acts tyrannically, full of ambition, while the Li Family is reserved and quietly ruthless. Our An Family is caught in between, struggling to look after both ends. Father, aren't you afraid?"

Standing in the courtyard, with the sunlight reflecting off the gold bracelets on his wrists, the young An Jingming stood tall against the wind, staring directly at his father at the head of the table.

"Well..." An Zheyan was at a loss for words for a moment before saying, "Haven't I already followed your advice by drawing the Ding Family to Moongaze Lake, maintaining a tripartite balance? The Yu Family has also promised not to attack the families that pay tribute... If the Li Family ever invades from the north, the Yu Family will surely not stand idly by and watch them expand... there's nothing to fear then. You just need to focus on your cultivation. Once you've reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, our family will have a place on the lake. Wouldn't that be wonderful?"

An Jingming clenched his teeth and shook his head, unable to muster anger at the sight of his father's contented face. He swung his sleeves and said softly, "Father! What makes you think the Yu Family will just sit idly by and watch me attain Foundation Establishment Realm? I dare not even leave our family's grand formation now. As I slowly increase my cultivation year by year, the Yu Family will eventually become impatient and will surely find an excuse to kill me!"

An Zheyan was momentarily stunned, his mouth moved but no words came out. Unable to formulate a rebuttal, he could only ask, "What do you suggest then?"

Clearing his throat, An Jingming said in a voice still tinged with youthful timbre, "Our family's awkward position is due to its poor geographical location... caught between the Li and Yu families. The best strategy now is to sell Mount Huazhong to the Li Family, letting them face the pressure from the Yu Family directly. The two families could sign a pact, in turn, making the Yu Family feel the threat of the Li Family's rise."

An Jingming continued to lay out his plans, "I've heard that Li Tongya has reached the eighth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm, which could draw the Yu Family's attention. The two families supporting each other from east to west, I could marry a girl from the Li Family, leveraging the might of the Sword Immortal to deter the Yu Family. Once I've reached the Foundation Establishment Realm and if Li Tongya succeeds in his breakthrough, we could support the Li Family against the Yu Family... If Li Tongya fails, then we could lead both families, with each party getting what they need."

As An Jingming was still speaking, An Zheyan's lips trembled, and his complexion turned unsightly. He interrupted his son, slamming his silver chopsticks down.

"No, absolutely not! Do you know how many spirit fields are on Mount Huazhong, feeding how many of our clan members?! We fought tooth and nail to get it; how can we just hand it over to the Li Family!"

An Jingming sighed lightly, realizing that An Zheyan's character would never allow for the ceding of Mount Huazhong. Thus, he solemnly suggested, "Since Father is reluctant to give up Mount Huazhong, I have another plan. The key to the Li Family is Li Tongya...He is extremely cautious, fully focused on cultivating in seclusion in the south, and difficult to remove. However, if we can ally with the Yu Family against Li Xuanling and Li Xuanfeng, eliminating one of them, could Li Tongya still remain indifferent?"

Continuing, An Jingming said, "With the Yu Family currently favorably inclined toward us, there are opportunities to be utilized. Yu Mugao is a dark and ruthless man, difficult to deal with. If we can unite with other families to assassinate Yu Mugao, the threat of the Yu Family can be significantly reduced."

An Zheyan was confused, seeing him aim to kill Yu Mugao on one hand and remove Li Xuanling and Li Xuanfeng on the other. He was unable to follow his son's ambitious line of thought. He murmured, "So, does our An Family side with the Yu Family or the Li Family?"

"Both sides!" An Jingming softly chuckled, lifting his head slightly as he declared, "As the Yu and Li families harbor mutual suspicions, our An Family has the opportunity to sow discord and navigate both sides. Regardless of who dies, or if both sides suffer no casualties, it's as good as setting a feud between the Yu and Li families."

An Zheyan, somewhat moved by this, pondered for a moment before hesitantly saying, "But... neither side is foolish. How could they simply act as you suggest?"

"Don't worry, Father," An Jingming assured, "It is precisely because neither side is foolish and they are wary of each other... Fear leads to murderous intentions. The conflict between the two families is inevitable, and we are merely a catalyst. Father just needs to follow the script I've taught you, ensuring that both families betray each other, resulting in mutual destruction."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

In the estate at the foot of the mountain in Lijing Town, Mu Yalu paced around the courtyard before taking a seat on a stone bench. A servant hurriedly served her tea.

Since it was discovered that Li Yuanjiao had spiritual orifice and extraordinary talent, Mu Yalu's days in the main courtyard had significantly improved.

Previously, Li Xuanxuan rarely visited her courtyard and Mu Yalu always tried to keep a low profile, minimizing her presence. Once Li Yuanjiao started spending more time on the mountain, Mu Yalu instantly became one of the most significant figures in the courtyard.

"Madam, this tea was sent over by the main family yesterday. This month, they've sent gifts to the courtyard three times already," whispered a servant girl beside her.

This woman, a descendant of the Mount Yue refugees who had assimilated completely with the Easterners, was brought into the courtyard personally by Mu Yalu and was deeply trusted by her.

Upon hearing this, Mu Yalu nodded slightly, and the servant girl added softly, "Since Young Master Xiu and Jiao'er get along well, the first madam has always been displeased. But in recent years, ever since Jiao'er was found to have spiritual orifice, she has started to curry favor..."

Mu Yalu gestured for her to stop talking and said quietly, "The first madam is crafty. Over the years, she has managed the concubines in the family well, and Xiu'er has been well-taught; he's capable of managing a household and is no ordinary person. She sees Jiao'er as Yuanxiu's future right-hand man, hence naturally wanting to maintain a good relationship with me..."

Setting her small teacup on the table, Mu Yalu softly inquired, "Have you found out about the matter I asked you to investigate?"

"Yes Madam, the man's name is Shamoli‚Äîthe fourth son of Mu Jiaoman. He is now residing on the eastern side of the town," the servant girl replied obediently.

Mu Yalu smiled, her eyes slightly crinkling as she spoke gently, "What a godsent opportunity! In the future, Mount Yue will become even closer to the Li Family, and when Jiao'er grows up, he can also receive some support from the Mulu clan."

Although the servant girl did not understand why Mu Yalu considered it a godsend opportunity, she felt happy seeing her madam so delighted. However, their conversation was interrupted by a gentle knock on the door.

"Mother, I've returned!"

Li Yuanjiao's cheerful voice came from outside the door.

"It's the young master!" the servant girl exclaimed happily as Mu Yalu quickly stood up and walked to the door, gently pushing it open to see Li Yuanjiao standing there with a beaming smile.

"Jiao'er!"

Mu Yalu stepped forward to embrace him, softly asking, "Are you accustomed to living on the mountain this year?"

"It's been all right! My siblings have all been quite nice to me," Li Yuanjiao chuckled and swiftly entered the courtyard to sit beside the stone table, taking the teacup in his hands. He quietly asked, "Has Father been in seclusion on the mountain this year? Has anyone troubled you at home?"

"Not at all," Mu Yalu replied with a soft voice, refilling his cup with water.

Li Yuanjiao sighed in relief as he continued, "Stepmother has been quite kind to you. There haven't been any petty schemes in the family, which has really eased my mind. At least Brother and I won't have to worry about it!"

As Mu Yalu nodded and smiled, Li Yuanjiao paused before seriously adding, "I've been dealing with affairs in the Clan Affairs Courtyard with brother these past few days and learned quite a lot."

Mu Yalu raised an eyebrow at him, observing as Li Yuanjiao put down his teacup. He then whispered, "Mother, have you sent someone to inquire about Shamoli's news?"

Mu Yalu was momentarily shocked, nodding with a hint of unease before she responded meekly, "Yes..."

Li Yuanjiao shook his head, advising, "Mother, given your sensitive status, it's better to have someone ask me these things directly on the mountain. In the future, avoid inquiring yourself. Li Family's territory is not like Eastern Mount Yue; the Clan Affairs Courtyard has many eyes and ears around. I'm afraid you might inadvertently give them something to hold against you, Mother..."

Mu Yalu was instantly alarmed and anxious, her voice filled with concern as she asked, "Could this lead to any consequences?! Has Mother caused you trouble?"

"It's nothing serious," Li Yuanjiao reassured, taking a sip of his tea and smiling. "It's not a big deal. Besides, Brother gave me that secret letter to handle myself. I just wanted to remind Mother," he continued with a small grin.

"That's a relief."

Mu Yalu sighed softly. After a brief exchange, she had the servant girl leave and then softly asked, "Does... Lord Yuanxiu treat you the same as before?"

"Yes," Li Yuanjiao's voice lowered in response, "In our family, where only my brother from the direct lineage can cultivate and with the family being sparse in numbers‚Äîregardless of legitimacy or gender‚Äîall descendants with spiritual orifices are treated equally. I haven't faced any mistreatment; on the contrary, I've received tremendous benefits!"

"That's very good," Mu Yalu visibly relaxed, only for Li Yuanjiao to continue, "I've heard that the family is considering adopting me into fourth granduncle's line, who is solely focused on his cultivation in the southern border without any interest in taking a wife for himself. I came today to get your opinion on this matter..."

"What?!" Mu Yalu was stunned, feeling as though fortune had suddenly smiled upon her. She asked hesitantly, "You're talking about... the Qingsui Sword Immortal?"

"Yes."

Li Yuanjiao was quite shocked himself when Li Xuanling confided in him about this intention. Observing his mother's disbelief, he softly added, "Father... He has agreed to it. If you are fine with it, I'll become the direct descendant of the fourth lineage, which will be greatly beneficial in the future."

"Good."

Mu Yalu nodded as she heard this, her primary concern always being her son's well-being, thus agreeing without hesitation. After pondering for a moment, she whispered, "That way, you could compete with Yuanxiu for the position of the young clan head..."

"Mother, you must not speak nonsense!" Li Yuanjiao shook his head firmly, stating, "I respect my brother the most. The position of the young clan head can only be his. In this life, I only wish to support him well‚Äîwith no other intentions."

"That's fine too," Mu Yalu replied with a smile, thinking about how to convey these exact words to the main household.

"However, regarding Shamoli, he's quite the pleasure-seeker..."

The mother and son discussed further regarding the newcomer, with Li Yuanjiao detailing Shamoli's personality.

"Not everyone can be adept at human relations. The Li Family is only kind to its own and those under its rule. Shamoli, falling into you and your brother's hands, is rather unfortunate!" Mu Yalu laughed.

"What's there to pity about him when he's being handed a throne on a silver platter?" Li Yuanjiao dismissed, laughing heartily.

Mu Yalu watched him with a joyful eye, from Li Xuanxuan to Li Yuanxiu, she realized that both were not at all simple-minded men.

She thought to herself, Every one of the Li Family is cunning and bad, focusing outward for now... By the sixth or eighth generation, when kinship thins, internal strife will surely happen. Fortunately, my son was born early and is thus spared from having to compete with similarly shrewd characters.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Atop Mount Lijing, Li Tongya stepped through the air, his figure shifting like a phantom. Around him, several reflections that looked like water gleamed, floating around his figure for a moment before dissipating with a soft splash.

"I've finally mastered the River Crossing Torrential Step! Now, I have an added layer of protection against enemies... Unless facing against a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, I can escape with ease even if I can't win," Li Tongya mumbled to himself gleefully.

The River Crossing Torrential Step had three stages. The initial stage was not too challenging, but it became significantly more difficult with progression. It took Li Tongya seven to eight years just to master the first stage.

Li Tongya's practice of the River One Qi Technique from Lingyu Gate, a foundational technique that shared origins with this footwork technique, should have sped up his training.

However, these past few years, his focus was on cultivation, aiming to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm before sixty. Thus, this footwork technique was only revisited during cultivation bottlenecks, taking him seven to eight years to master what should have taken three to four.

Only Li Xuanling from within the family showed a natural aptitude for this technique, mastering it early on. No other clan members were known to have succeeded.

"It's unbelievable that among the vast Li Family, no one could master the Pill Flame Secret Art and produce a Pill Flame..."

Li Tongya thought again. Among the members of the Xiao Family, far larger than the Li Family, only Xiao Chuting and Xiao Yuansi could conjure the Pill Flame. This put things into perspective for him.

"No wonder Yu Muxian of the Azure Pond Sect is so valued by the Yu Family... I'm guessing there are also certain conditions to meet before one can refine artifacts."

Just as Li Tongya settled on the mountainside, a voice transmission entered the formation, echoing in the cave dwelling.

"An Zheyan from the An Family is here to visit. Please open the formation, Brother Tongya!"

"An Zheyan..?"

Li Tongya paused momentarily. He had little interaction with this individual, having only divided the Lu Family's assets in tacit agreement. He wondered about the purpose of today's visit.

After opening the formation, Li Tongya sat for a moment. Soon, Li Xuanling led An Zheyan inside. Li Tongya glanced at him and courteously said, "Greetings, Brother Zheyan."

"No need for formality, Brother Tongya!" An Zheyan grinned, returning the greeting. His bald head was now adorned with a gray-white leather hat that made him look less like a butcher from the secular world, but more like a wealthy landlord.

"Word has it that Brother Tongya has broken through to the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Truly remarkable!"

An Zheyan, taking the offered tea, smiled. It had been decades since their last meeting. Back then, their cultivation realms were comparable, but now An Zheyan was at the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm while Li Tongya had already reached the eighth.

"You're flattering me, Brother Zheyan..." Li Tongya replied with a shallow smile. He decided to cut to the chase.

"What brings Brother Zheyan here today?"




# Chapter 179: External Cultivator

An Zheyan cupped his fist, then answered in a calm tone.

"To kill Yu Mugao."

"Hmm." Li Tongya chuckled inwardly, maintaining a slight smile on his face. He then softly said, "If Brother Zheyan has come for this matter, then please leave."

"Ling'er, please see the guest out," Li Tongya called out. Right away, Li Xuanling, who had been silently standing in the corner, stepped forward.

An Zheyan hurriedly waved his hand, hastily saying, "Brother Tongya, please hear me out!"

Since Li Tongya did not plan to dismiss him so unceremoniously, he turned his head at his plea.

An Zheyan quickly continued, "Brother Tongya! Although your family is protected by a Sword Immortal and no one dares to look down upon it, the Yu Family has long harbored intentions to sweep across Moongaze Lake... Even if they dare not openly annex your family, they will certainly not refrain from acting in the shadows! Yu Mugao wouldn't dare target Brother Tongya directly, but it's entirely possible for him to hire a few foreign cultivators, rogue cultivators, and outer sect disciples to secretly assassinate your clan's disciples! They'll only be at ease when all your family's promising juniors meet untimely ends."

"Though the Sword Immortal's cultivation is profound, he is far in the southern border. The Yu Family also has backing within the sect... As long as they leave no evidence, the Qingsui Sword Immortal can't possibly cross thousands of li to act for one or two mysteriously deceased juniors."

An Zheyan laid out these points bluntly, causing Li Tongya to frown deeply.

"Brother Zheyan seems to know quite a bit about the Yu Family," he remarked with a grave tone.

Rather than persuading Li Tongya, An Zheyan's words only raised more suspicions in his mind. Living as neighbors for so many years, both sides had their spies in each other's territories, and Li Tongya was somewhat aware of An Zheyan's actions.

Yu Mugao is indeed ruthless enough to do such a thing, but An Zheyan has always been selfish and stingy, not someone who typically thinks in such grand terms... Why is he suddenly speaking like this today?

Seeing Li Tongya silent, An Zheyan thought he had swayed him and pressed on. "Even if one does not provoke the tiger, the tiger may still harbor the intent to harm. Although your family resides peacefully on its land, if the Yu Family wishes to monopolize the Moongaze Lake, they will inevitably need to suppress your family. Unable to find a way to deal with Brother Tongya directly, they will certainly plot against the younger generation in your family."

Li Tongya shook his head, finding an excuse to reply in a stern voice, "Both Yu Mugao and Yu Mujian are of good talent. Not to mention Yu Xiaogui who is at the Foundation Establishment Realm, several members of their generation of Xiao are also at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm. There is no need for them to fear my Li Family. I will say it again, Brother Zheyan, if you have come for this matter, there's no need to speak further. Please leave."

An Zheyan, seeing that Li Tongya was indeed unmoved, did not panic but spoke softly, "Every word I've spoken is true, and Brother Tongya knows it. If your family doesn't believe me, just wait a few more years, and you will understand the value of my warning."

After cupping his fist, he rode the wind away, leaving Li Tongya standing there for a while. Li Xuanling approached hesitantly, whispering, "I find his words quite reasonable; we should be cautious."

Li Tongya, with a furrowed brow, sat back down. He was feeling increasingly uneasy. After pondering for a moment, he responded, "Those words aren't something An Zheyan would come up with on his own... This must be An Jingming's idea."

He then recalled Yu Mugao's character and thought about the close relationship between the An and Yu families. Li Tongya felt somewhat troubled and spoke after some time, his voice soft.

"Given Yu Mugao's nature, he would indeed do such a thing... I'm sure he'll target not only our family. An Jingming must also be on his mind, hence An Zheyan is rushing to find someone to deal with Yu Mugao."

Li Xuanling, who was standing by, frowned and replied, "But that man is always guarded by peak Qi Cultivators when he leaves home... he's not easy to kill. Doing so would just offend the Yu Family for no reason."

Li Tongya nodded and advised, "This is an impractical matter. For now, let's ensure our younger family members don't leave our territory, and wait until the Xiao Family finishes executing their plans. By then, we may be able to borrow the Xiao Family's strength and no longer allow the Yu Family to dominate unchecked."

Li Xuanling noted his words. Li Tongya looked at the sky and instructed, "Now that we have Snake Essence Pills, I can try to break through to the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Although it's been only two to three years since my last breakthrough and it's a bit rushed, there's no other choice. I must try to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm before turning sixty..."

Li Xuanling clenched his teeth, his eyes filled with deep worry. After composing his thoughts for a long while, he finally spoke with unease, "I have heard that the breakthrough from Qi Cultivation Realm to Foundation Establishment Realm is fraught with danger, almost a nine in ten chance of death. With Father being a late-stage Qi Cultivator, you are the pillar of our family. I'm afraid..."

His voice trailed off.
ùíªùëüùò¶ùò¶ùò∏‚ÑØùí∑ùëõùò∞ùìã‚ÑØùò≠.ùò§ùò∞ùòÆ

Li Tongya was initially startled, then sighed deeply. Looking at his son, now a father himself with a fully grown beard, he felt somewhat comforted and responded, "I have only consumed three pills and one talisman qi in my cultivation journey, relying solely on diligent practice without taking any precious medicines or spirit items like those in the three sects and seven gates do. This breakthrough indeed carries a high risk of death..."

Seeing Li Xuanling's worried gaze, Li Tongya reassured him with a warm smile, "But I have been earnestly cultivating day and night, aiming to reach Foundation Establishment Realm before I turn sixty, even if it's just a slightly better chance. If our Li Family wishes to advance further, we must have a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. In this vast Moongaze Lake, only those at the Foundation Establishment Realm can truly make their voices heard. With the prestige of your fourth uncle, our Li Family will be worry-free for the next fifty years... It's the perfect opportunity to attempt the Foundation Establishment Realm. If I fail and perish, the Yu Family won't trouble us too much and lower their guard instead."

"I understand."

Li Xuanling cupped his fist, and Li Tongya nodded slightly before stepping out of the courtyard and flying toward Meiche Peak in the south.

Li Xuanling watched with concern, hoping that the day Li Tongya's attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm would come later rather than sooner.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

In Lijing Town, the biggest and most lavish residence was not that of Li Xuanxuan at the foot of the mountain. Compared by size and splendor, Li Xuanxuan's residence would likely be ranked lower. The residences of clan uncles and elders are among the top, followed by the Chen, Liu, Ren, and Tian families, with Li Xuanxuan's coming last.

Chen Donghe, who had been guarding Mount Huaqian for years and cultivating with the aid of the spirit spring on the mountain, rarely returned home. To his surprise, the Chen Family's estate had expanded significantly, now housing over three hundred family members. Without a map listing names, it would be almost impossible to find someone.

As he approached the courtyard, firecrackers sounded. He noticed that people lined both sides. His only surviving brother, now over fifty and considered the head of the household, waited respectfully at the entrance.

A boy in a padded jacket stared at him intently, recognized by Chen Donghe's spiritual sense as the special child the family had called him back for.

"How old are you now?" Chen Donghe asked the child.

"Eight," was the reply.

Chen Donghe scrutinized the boy. He was biting his lip and staring back at Chen Donghe innocently, and he asked his next question.

"What is your name?"

"Chen Mufeng," the boy answered.

Standing up, Chen Donghe noticed his brother approaching respectfully, speaking in a tone of unfamiliar deference.

"We've asked the Immortal Master here in the hope that he might mentor the child... The Chen Family would be eternally grateful!"

After finishing his words, with a thud, he fell to the ground on his knees. The crowd around him followed suit, their pleading voices swelling like a tide.

Chen Donghe, focusing on the boy and ignoring the surrounding people, pondered to himself.

I cannot personally mentor this child, as it would recklessly leave traces... I'll find him a good family instead. This is the least I can do for the Chen Family.

Helping his brother up, he said solemnly, "I cannot mentor this child personally but I can find him a good teacher..."

His brother's expression shifted with uncertainty, and he was momentarily stunned. He hesitated. "Will this teacher be someone from the Tian... or Liu Family?"

Chen Donghe, not often interacting with external cultivators at the foot of the mountain, paused at this question.

A realization struck him.

The Li Family has accepted thirty to forty external cultivators over the decades, most of whom are at the first or second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. However... there are also three or four at the fourth stage, and there might be factions involved which also concerns the Chen Family's position.

Seeing Chen Donghe's reaction, his brother became somewhat flustered, squeezing out a smile through his wrinkled face. He responded hurriedly, "We do not doubt the Immortal Master's decision nor wish to choose shamelessly; we just need to know the name of the teacher to understand whom the child will be mentored by..."

Chen Donghe, smiling warmly, reassured his brother.

"Don't worry, brother. It'll be someone from the Li Family."

"The Li Family?!"

His brother was immediately overjoyed, smiling broadly to reveal a few decayed teeth. He exclaimed, "That's excellent! Excellent indeed!"

With a hearty laugh, Chen Donghe took Chen Mufeng's hand and soared into the sky, leaving a group of envious onlookers on the ground.

Flying over the town for a while, Chen Donghe descended into a spacious courtyard with the trembling child in his arms. Chen Mufeng stumbled a few steps upon landing.

Chen Donghe released his hand and saw a person standing in front of the stone door with gray hair and a straight posture. He looked somewhat surprised to see him and greeted, "Greetings, Brother Donghe... This is quite rare. Are you here looking for that Shamoli?"

"Not at all."

Chen Donghe returned the greeting with a warm smile, pulling the child closer and softly adding, "I'm here looking for Brother Qiuyang."

Li Qiuyang stepped forward and took a seat on a stone bench in the courtyard, sweeping his spiritual sense over the area while keeping an eye on the stone door to the room where Shamoli had retreated for seclusion.

He smiled.

"Brother Donghe, just speak your mind."

Chen Donghe nodded, speaking seriously, "I returned to the Chen Family recently, and we have a child with a spiritual orifice. They wanted me to mentor him, but I felt it wasn't right for me to take him under my wing... I was hoping to entrust him to you."

"Oh?"

Li Qiuyang lowered his head but did not immediately agree. He observed Chen Mufeng for a while. Seeing the boy was well-behaved, Chen Donghe transmitted his voice.

"I've heard Brother Qiuyang's sons are without spiritual orifice, which will be troublesome in the future. Why not take this child as your disciple and later marry him to one of your daughters? When you pass away in a hundred years, your descendants will have someone to shelter them..."

This suggestion struck a chord with Li Qiuyang, who immediately brightened up and began nodding vigorously. He then said solemnly, "Since brother has put it this way, I will take the child under my wing."

Chen Donghe laughed heartily, patting the boy's back and beaming.

"Call him Master."

"Master!"

The boy obediently did so and Li Qiuyang warmly took his hand, asking for his birthdate and name.

After they had spoken, Chen Donghe then spoke softly, "I have a question for Brother Qiuyang..."

"Go ahead," Li Qiuyang replied as he looked up.

Chen Donghe took out two small cups and a gourd from his storage pouch, filled the cups with clear wine, and then said softly, "Having practiced on Mount Huaqian for many years, I'm not very familiar with the external cultivators of our home... Could Brother Qiuyang enlighten me?"

"Ah, that matter!"

Li Qiuyang was about to sip from his cup but set down the jade cup, looking toward the closed stone door before letting out a loud, hearty laugh.

"There are twenty-eight external cultivators of the Embryonic Breathing Realm in our family now, and six from the Ye Family have changed their surname to Li. Most are at the first or second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, hardly worth mentioning... However, a few early cultivators with decent talent are noteworthy."
ùëìùëüùëíùò¶ùìåùëíùëèùëõùëúùò∑ùëíùò≠.ùí∏ùò∞ùëö

Li Qiuyang glanced at Chen Mufeng next to him, who was all ears. He nodded slightly, and continued solemnly, "The first‚Äîat the fifth stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm‚Äîis surnamed Tian, related to the... Family Head, the Great King's wife's family."

Li Qiuyang's mention of "the Great King'' silenced them both. Both of them had been through thick and thin with Li Xiangping and everyone called him the "Great King" while they were in the territory of Mount Yue.

"The Great King passed away in the lands of Mount Yue, and his mother followed in sorrow within a few years. The Tian Family has declined quite a bit, but this man's talent is decent; now at forty, his likelihood of breaking through to the Qi Cultivation Realm isn't high, but still possible. He's currently in charge of managing the cultivation of the Spirit Paddies in town with quite a few people covertly supporting him, and can be considered a leader of one faction. Following them are the Liu and Ren families, both at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm but mostly without a chance to break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, each leading a faction."

Chen Donghe sipped the clear wine, frowning slightly, and asked in a low voice, "Is this known to the family?"

"I wouldn't know..." Li Qiuyang said as he shook his head, his spiritual sense sweeping inside and outside the courtyard before whispering, "Such matters should be managed by the Clan Affairs Courtyard... I avoid these affairs as much as possible. Who in the Li Family doesn't fear the Clan Affairs Courtyard?"

Realization struck Chen Donghe and he quickly apologized. After a moment of thought, he asked, "Is the struggle intense?"

"It used to be manageable."

Li Qiuyang's voice had grown even lower, the shallow wrinkles at the corners of his eyes becoming even more evident in the dim light.

He softly continued, "After all... each family has its interests, and the output of each spirit field differs; so does the stipend provided. These people used to vie for the better fields to skive off, and no one was willing to take the barren ones... Since the Young Master Xiu took over, the factions have become increasingly antagonistic. Many people have been squeezed into the barren lands due to their disputes, having no choice but to toil thanklessly."

"I see," Chen Donghe responded as he nodded slightly, pondering deeply to himself.

This matter probably needs to be reported to the family for Li Xuanling and others to decide, to prevent long-term issues from brewing...

After bidding farewell to Li Qiuyang, he flew away from the courtyard and headed toward the mountain, leaving Li Qiuyang in the courtyard silently watching his departure direction. He then eventually smiled and chuckled to himself.

"He'er never changes!"




# Chapter 181: Donghe's Worries

Li Qinghong stepped onto the stone-paved road on Mount Lijing‚Äîa path that was laid decades ago, and now the time that had passed by was evidenced by how it was now fully covered with moss.

She heard it was laid during the time her third granduncle, Li Xiangping, led the family. In fact, a few of the craftsmen involved were still alive.

Walking up the mountain, Li Qinghong looked around. It had been days since she last saw her younger brother, Li Yuanyun. After searching the mountain, she finally found him in their aunt Li Jingtian's side courtyard.

The boy sat there, engrossed in a wooden slip. Entering the courtyard, Li Qinghong felt a twinge of unease.

"Brother Yun..."

Having received a talisman seed on the mountaintop almost a year ago, Li Qinghong had been busy with cultivation and spear training. Li Yuanyun rarely visited the main courtyard, and their infrequent encounters left Li Qinghong with a sense of guilt; especially since knowing her brother could not cultivate.

"Ah, you're here, Big Sis! It's been quite a while since I last saw you," Li Yuanyun exclaimed as he brightened up, setting aside the wooden slip.

Li Qinghong smiled sweetly, noticing the wooden slip titled 'Two Hundred Years of Linghai Prefecture's Scenery‚ÄîAnnotated by Li Jingtian' on the table.

Curious, she asked, "You used to dislike these long and boring history books... What made you start reading them?"

Li Yuanyun chuckled.

"Since I can't cultivate, and I certainly can't compare to Brother Xiu in managing our home, I thought I'd find something I can do. I've come to our aunt's place to study, hoping I can be of help to her in the future."

His words hit Li Qinghong like a physical blow, causing her to awkwardly change the subject with a forced smile.

"Have you gained anything from reading this?"

Li Yuanyun sighed softly, picking up the wooden slip again. "After reading this, I feel only... fear," he muttered.

Puzzled by his response, Li Qinghong asked curiously after composing herself, "Fear..? What's there to be afraid of?"

"I always thought our family was harmonious, with Mount Yue already subdued and our parents in a loving marriage. I believed we lived in a peaceful world..." Li Yuanyun confessed, his voice betraying a hint of terror as he gripped the wooden slip tightly.

"...But this book showed me the turmoil beyond our borders, lands awash with blood, filled with plots and schemes. The endless cycle of conspiracies makes one realize how vile the world can be. Our Li Family might seem stable now, but who knows what dangers lurk in the shadows? It's disheartening to see how filthy this world truly is."

"Sister, although being born into the Li Family means being clothed in silk and feasting on delicacies where even a mortal without spiritual orifice can enjoy a life of pleasure, I am truly terrified. I fear waking up one night to find our family's protective formation shattered, shimmering immortal swords descending from the sky, and dying in my sleep without knowing why," Li Yuanyun confessed, his eyes reddening with emotion.

Li Qinghong was speechless for a moment. However, she composed herself and found her words, speaking softly, "Father once said: the rules of this world are set by immortals... Would immortals care about the morality of mortals? Of course not! They would resort to any means necessary..."

"Sister," Li Yuanyun lifted his head to look at her, speaking softly, "I've read our family history. Mount Huaqian was taken from the Lu Family, which was also our mother's maternal home... but it's destroyed now. I've seen Mother cry in secret, perhaps it is because of this..."

His voice trailed off.

Li Qinghong fell silent for a while before responding, "If the Li Family hadn't taken it, the An Family would have by the next day. The Li Family wasn't wrong, and neither was the Lu Family. The situation developed to this point as the only way out when there was no other choice. If the head of the Lu Family had been wise, this could have ended gracefully. The fault‚Äîif any, lies with him."

"You're right, Sister..."

Li Yuanyun put down the wooden slip, his mood seeming to have lightened considerably.

"It's a pity that my perspective is limited. Otherwise, I'd write a Two Hundred Years of Moongaze Lake's Scenery, surely as interesting as that of the Linghai Prefecture!"

Li Qinghong smiled softly and was about to speak when the courtyard door creaked open. A woman in her mid-twenties with long, flowing hair tied up behind her head walked in. She set down her paper parasol and greeted warmly, "Ah, you're here, Qinghong."

"Auntie!" Li Qinghong giggled, hurrying over to embrace Li Jingtian. However, she was not expecting to see another middle-aged man with a dignified air following her aunt into the courtyard.

He greeted her politely.

"Oh, you're here too, Uncle!" Li Qinghong exclaimed in slight surprise.

Chen Donghe nodded. The children found their uncle, who was a Qi Cultivator, stern and unfamiliar since they rarely saw him. Feeling awkward in his presence, they quickly excused themselves.

Li Jingtian nodded, smiling as she saw them off. She then turned back to the courtyard, noticing Chen Donghe examining the rows of wooden scripts on the table.

"What are you looking at?" she asked softly.

Chen Donghe stroked his chin, marveling, "The Li Family's bloodline is truly extraordinary. The speed at which Qinghong and Yuanjiao have broken through to the Profound Scenery Stage is astonishing! Even Xuanxuan and Xuanling were exceptional back in the day. It seems they were born cultivators!"

Li Jingtian lowered her gaze to hide the flicker of sadness in her eyes. She simply turned her head away and laughed.

"That's nothing surprising. After all, they carry the bloodline of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator."

Chen Donghe nodded without giving it much thought. Once he confirmed there were no others around with a sweep of his spiritual sense, he spoke softly, "I don't mean to worry you, but these days I've made some observations that unsettle me... I'm considering whether to discuss it with Second Uncle or Xuanling on the mountain. I need your insight on this."

"What's the matter?" Li Jingtian asked as she joined him at the table, listening as Chen Donghe spoke seriously, "Currently, our family has dozens of external cultivators. Although most are only at the first or second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, they shouldn't be underestimated. These individuals are distributed across various territories to cultivate spirit fields, or assigned as guardians of towns, responsible for tasks like demon extermination and healing."

Pausing here to allow Li Jingtian a moment to digest the information, Chen Donghe continued, "These people represent the voices of various forces outside the Li Family... With several factions headed by three cultivators at the fourth and fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, their actions are not always clean. The Clan Affairs Courtyard doesn't strictly control them, and I fear that over time, this may lead to problems."

Li Jingtian pondered for a moment, her delicate hands neatly arranging the wooden slips on the table before she responded in a soft voice, "The Clan Affairs Courtyard has eyes and ears everywhere... I'm sure they have already noticed the issues you mentioned. It's likely that these matters have already been brought up to Xiu'er or perhaps even to the cave dwelling on Meiche Peak by now. If the family has yet to address this, there might be other considerations at play."

"These people represent not just themselves but also the interests of the branches and minor clans they come from. Conflict is inevitable, and who knows..."

Seeing Chen Donghe looking at her, Li Jingtian leaned in closer, whispering softly in his ear with a gentle voice, "The one letting them fight might just be our Xiu'er."




# Chapter 182: Clan Affairs Courtyard

The Clan Affairs Courtyard was situated at the foot of Mount Lijing, directly adjacent to the mountain itself. It was once the Li Family's main residence when they still lived at the foot of the mountain, which was flanked by two other courtyards. The entire estate was rectangular, facing north to south.

The front courtyard was an open area, constructed by the four Li Brothers themselves in earlier days that had already gone by. Li Changhu and Li Tongya were responsible for laying the bricks, while Li Xiangping and Li Chejing mortared them in place.

Looking closely at the seams, one might still find the small fingerprints of the young Sword Immortal. The work done by family members was meticulous and tightly sealed, enduring through wind and rain with no problem at all.

Li Xiewen, now in his thirties and a stern middle-aged man, stood in traditional attire in the front courtyard. With Li Xuanxuan in seclusion and Li Yuanxiu managing the household affairs, Li Xiewen naturally delegated the town's duties to his eldest son, Li Pingyi, and came to the Clan Affairs Courtyard to work.

Just like the night Li Yesheng handed over Lijing Town to him, Li Xiewen took Li Pingyi's hand and talked all night by candlelight, discussing from the days Grandfather Li Yesheng used to herd ducks at Meiche River to the present prominence of Li Xiewen's lineage.

Holding Li Pingyi's hand solemnly, he said, "Our lineage has governed Lijing Town for generations... Your grandfather and Uncle Xiangping both perished in the lands of Mount Yue, and I, along with your grandfather, have controlled the various families and disciplined the descendants here for eighteen years. You must understand that the rise and fall of our lineage rests solely on the Young Family Head. Make sure you tread cautiously!"

Li Pingyi, always astute, had observed these matters since he was young. He had heeded his father's efforts in creating chances for him to stick close to Li Yuanxiu. Now aiding Li Yuanxiu in managing household affairs for just over a year, he had shown no signs of negligence.

Li Xiewen stood in the yard, and as clan soldiers passed by, they bowed and he responded in kind. After waiting about half an hour, he saw his son, Li Pingyi, exit the courtyard and approach him while cupping his fist.

"The Clan Leader has descended the mountain... please follow me, inspector."

In the Clan Affairs Courtyard, each of them had their own duties. With all eyes in the clan on them, they naturally could not address each other as father and son in court.

Li Pingyi referred to his father by his official title, and Li Xiewen responded respectfully, "Thank you."

Li Xiewen followed Li Pingyi into the central hall where many clan soldiers stood silently. Below, two men were kneeling‚Äîstripped to the waist and whipped with thorned whips. Blood splattered the floor.

They bit down on their lips with their teeth, not daring to make a sound. Gray wooden plaques were stuck in their necks labeling their crimes: "bullying a woman" and "extortion". Seeing they were not from his direct family, Li Xiewen breathed a sigh of relief.

Beyond the dim central hall, the rear hall was much brighter. It had windows on both sides letting in streams of sunlight and was lit by lamps that seemed to be ignited by mana, producing no soot.

A young man, about sixteen or seventeen, was seated at the desk at the front. His black hair was neatly combed and he wore a jade crown. His eyebrows were smooth and his face was chiseled.

His gray eyes looked up and smiled.

"I heard Uncle Xiewen was looking for me so I rushed down from the mountain. Sorry to have kept you waiting."

"Please, no need to apologize!" Li Xiewen responded, warmed by his sincerity but careful not to presume as much. He continued gravely, "As the appointed inspector, I'm tasked with overseeing the cultivators from the minor sect and branches... I've recently received some news that I have to report urgently."

"Please continue, Clan Uncle," Li Yuanxiu instructed as he nodded slightly.

Li Xiewen then cupped his fist and continued, "The son of the Chen Family has become a disciple of Li Qiuyang and is betrothed to his sixth daughter, thus aligning the Chen Family with Qiuyang's lineage."

"I have already discussed this matter with Uncle Donghe," Li Yuanxiu interjected, waving his hand dismissively.

"Uncle Donghe and Clan Uncle Qiuyang are pillars of our family. This matter is of no concern," he added with a smile.

Li Xiewen could tell that Li Yuanxiu did not want to delve deeper and had deliberately interrupted him. Aware that further discussion could offend him, he quickly moved on.

"Currently, the Ye branch of our Li Family consists of over six thousand five hundred people, with twelve hundred in minor sects, including eight cultivators. The disciples involved in the strife with the three external cultivators have been identified‚Äîover six hundred mortals and... three cultivators among them."

"Hmm."

Li Yuanxiu frowned slightly, pondering for a moment before speaking softly.

"These mortals are mostly married into families of external cultivators... Entanglements are inevitable. As for the family's cultivators, the minor sects aren't isolated; they have their own family ties and emotional preferences, and the intertwined interests are complicated to manage."

After glancing at Li Xiewen, Li Yuanxiu suggested quietly, "If Clan Uncle identifies any disciple with exceptional talent, relocate them to Mount Huaqian to cultivate with Uncle Donghe, away from these conflicts. The rest will merely mire in their current cultivation realms for life... Let them fight it out. As long as it's not too unsightly, let them be."

"Understood," Li Xiewen replied gravely, then shared some additional minor details before bowing and excusing himself.

Li Pingyi then turned to Li Yuanxiu and asked softly, "Do we continue to let our people stir the pot, Clan Leader..?"

"No need. Withdraw them," Li Yuanxiu instructed, putting away some documents and taking a sip from his tea bowl.

"If it escalates further, it could become ugly. The current level of conflict is just right, letting them fiercely compete while remaining impotent. The number of cultivators in our household is increasing daily, and although cultivators aren't truly detached from worldly needs‚Äîcompeting fiercely over Spirit Paddies and Spirit Stones‚Äîthe struggle is inevitable. This push now makes clear who the cunning and sly ones are, along with who the steady and honest ones are. Should a real problem arise, we'll have a reference."
ùíáùíìùíÜùíÜùô¨ùíÜùíÉùì∑ùíêùìøùôöùô°.ùíÑùì∏ùíé

Li Pingyi nodded in agreement.

Li Yuanxiu, holding a brush, drew on the fabric in front of him. He raised his eyebrows and said in a low voice, "However... With most of the senior members in seclusion, we must proceed with caution and not disturb the elders. Assign some people to keep a close watch, and if a real problem occurs, issue a warning beforehand. It would be unsightly if it resulted in a loss of life."

"Understood," Li Pingyi responded, cupping his fist.

He recalled the recent reports and a look of concern appeared as he spoke.

"Clan Leader, that one from the Tian branch has condensed the Jade Capital Chakra and broken through to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, thus awakening his spiritual sense. He's become sharply aware of everything around him. Our young ones have almost been exposed several times... I had to pull them back to avoid detection."

"Cultivators at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm are considered to have truly transcended the secular world and are not easily managed. I've thought about this too," Li Yuanxiu remarked, setting down his brush.

He added, "Once a cultivator reaches the fifth stage or the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, their powers elevate them beyond humanly possible‚Äîeven beyond the jurisdiction of the Clan Affairs Courtyard. I'm considering writing to Meiche Peak, proposing that cultivators at the fifth stage and above be separated from the others. Having them continue to farm with spiritual sense is a waste... They could better serve by hunting demons in the mountains or crafting talismans, without being under the direct control of the mountain's administration."

Li Yuanxiu paused and mulled over his thoughts for a while before continuing, "The problem is, we still have too few cultivators with awakened spiritual sense to form a separate group... Eventually, as the external cultivators in our family grow, this issue will need to be addressed openly."

"You are right, Young Clan Head," Li Pingyi agreed.




# Chapter 183: King of the Kings

"What?! Another one?" Shamoli was roused awake in the deep, dimly lit stone chamber.

Upon hearing the news from the person before him, he was momentarily stunned. He muttered in embarrassment, "How is that possible... H-How many does that make now?"

"Your Highness, this is the fifth one!"

Shamoli felt a bitter taste in his mouth. He had been cultivating among the Easterners for two years and had consumed several spirit fruits, finally breaking through to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. He had thought his progress impressive, only to find that the rate at which his concubines were becoming pregnant far surpassed his own cultivation speed.

"The firstborn here has already learned how to walk... It truly is astonishing."

Back in his palace in Eastern Mount Yue, Shamoli also had wives and concubines, who, under the directive of Mu Jiaoman, had been delayed in bearing children. Unexpectedly, since coming here, children seemed to spring forth one after another.

Confused, Shamoli stepped out into the courtyard, facing a host of wives and concubines. He was barely able to match their faces to names. One concubine approached him with a radiant smile; she had been pregnant even before his seclusion and was nearly due.

"S-Surely... it's mine, right...?" Shamoli asked, fraught with uncertainty. After months away, the faces of his many wives and concubines seemed all but new to him. He pulled the pregnant woman closer, peering at her bashful face, struggling to recall any shared moments of joy.

"Never mind, at least the first son is definitely mine..." Shamoli mumbled as he looked toward the crowd and spotted a woman at the forefront, holding a child who looked about one or two years old. The child had narrow eyes and a healthy tanned complexion‚Äîclearly of the Mulu Clan lineage.

This concubine had been pregnant when he first arrived in the lands of the Easterners. It was Shamoli's first child and so he cherished the baby deeply, watching over him carefully. He had managed to keep track of the timing and was confident that this child was indeed his own.

"Look who's here? The future heir to the throne!" Shamoli declared as he proudly took the child in his arms and played with him for a while.

Soon after, an attendant approached respectfully.

"Your Highness, Young Master Jiao is here."

Shamoli's beaming face instantly fell, and he muttered under his breath, "Damn it... he must have brought spirit fruits, and now I have to return to cultivation!"

Shamoli wanted to enjoy more time with his wives and concubines, but he could not possibly slack off while living under another's roof. Internally cursing, he plastered a forced smile on his face and hurried out to greet his guest.

"Young Master, you're here!"

Having lived on the Easterners' territory for two years, Shamoli had finally come to understand their way of speaking and managed to be polite for once.

Li Yuanjiao entered the courtyard with a raised eyebrow as he heard Shamoli's greeting.

"Cousin, you're unusually polite today..."

"Ah..." Shamoli chuckled awkwardly. He had only learned how to greet but was unprepared for Li Yuanjiao's off-script question which had caught him off guard and left him laughing with painful awkwardness, unsure of how to respond.

As the wives and concubines dispersed, Shamoli led Li Yuanjiao into the courtyard where they took their seats, tea being consequently served to the two men.

It was then that Li Yuanjiao spoke.

"Cousin, with your breakthrough to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, you're one step closer to reclaiming the throne in Eastern Mount Yue. Congratulations are indeed in order!"

Shamoli chuckled awkwardly, nodding clumsily, only to see Li Yuanjiao wave his hand dismissively. He spoke nonchalantly, "Your elder brother, Qimu, has now firmly secured the throne, rallying the tribes and factions within the state. None of your brothers have survived to challenge him. He truly enjoys his glory now!"

"That's truly infuriating!"

Shamoli felt a mix of jealousy and hatred as he heard this, and could not help but curse aloud.

Li Yuanjiao, sipping his tea as if it were a matter of no consequence, casually revealed, "Your brother does have some foresight... As soon as he secured his position on the throne, he dispatched trading caravans laden with five or six carts of tributes, and he also arranged marriages to maintain alliances. Right now, the streets outside are bustling with people drawn to the spectacle at the town's edge."

"What?!"

This statement hit Shamoli like a lightning bolt out of the blue, nearly making him jump three chi in the air. Now, he felt not only jealous and hateful but also fearful and panicked; so much so that he was momentarily stupefied and left unable to speak.

Shamoli was currently living a carefree life, not only surrounded by numerous wives and concubines but also having ascended a level in strength‚Äîall thanks to the Li Family.

While Shamoli was not the sharpest tool in the shed, he was not completely foolish. He understood that his value lay in bringing the Eastern Mount Yue under control.

His brother had always been a force to be reckoned with and was likely well aware of these dynamics. This prompted him to swiftly submit, making Shamoli feel redundant and frightened. He was so terrified that he trembled and found himself speechless.

Grasping a teacup, he gulped several mouthfuls. Although Shamoli usually was not strategic, he possessed some wits when it counted, which was why he fled in haste to the Li Family.

He stammered nervously, "Y-Young... young master... Qimu is greedy and unloyal! He's definitely not genuinely submitting, but waiting for an opportunity to strike..."

Seeing how terrified he was, Li Yuanjiao sighed and deliberately remained silent for a while. Watching Shamoli's eyes redden, he felt it was the right moment to speak solemnly, "Rest assured, Cousin... I understand. You are my true brother. How could Qimu‚Äîwho murdered his brother and father‚Äîever be genuinely submissive?"

"Exactly... exactly! He who kills his brother and father could never be truly submissive!"

Shamoli nearly applauded Li Yuanjiao for his spot-on analysis, which greatly relieved him. However, Li Yuanjiao's expression suddenly darkened and turned serious as he gritted his teeth.

"But that man disguises it too well... Some elders at home actually believed him. I had to argue based on reason to prevent them from handing you over... but..."

"But what?!" Shamoli gasped exasperatedly, deeply moved by his cousin's staunch support and alarmed by the twist in the conversation.

"It's just that your cultivation is progressing too slowly... it's causing the family to lose confidence," Li Yuanjiao answered after a short pause.

Thump!

Shamoli stood up so hastily that he broke the leg of his large wooden chair, which fell awkwardly to the ground. His face flushed with anger, he shouted loudly, "Damn it! I'm going to cultivate right now!"

"Wait a moment!"

Li Yuanjiao was taken aback by Shamoli's sudden and drastic reaction, pausing for a moment before speaking in a deep voice, "Are you practicing the native methods of Mount Yue?"

Shamoli's face reddened with embarrassment as he nodded awkwardly and stammered, "Yes... This method is very slow to cultivate. When breaking through, it involves condensing a mere portion of unrefined qi from the sky over the course of a month and consuming it. It can't possibly be compared to the sophisticated techniques of your Eastern people."

The issue of cultivation methods had been a longstanding pain for the people of Mount Yue. Any ruler who rose to prominence there and had seen the wider world would soon realize how inferior they were compared to true cultivators.

A cultivator who practiced authentic techniques could easily overpower multiple Mount Yue cultivators who had ingested unrefined qi and practiced crude techniques, even those from Mount Yue were superior in terms of cultivation realm.

"I know your methods are unreliable, brother... That's why I've specifically requested our family to grant you a proper technique," Li Yuanjiao said as he reassured him.

"What..?"

His words were shocking, and they overwhelmed Shamoli, causing his breathing to hasten as he struggled to maintain his composure. In a hoarse voice, he said, "Brother, such kindness I will remember forever! Please... do not offend the elders on my account."

"Don't worry," Li Yuanjiao reassured, shaking his head as he continued, "As long as you can reach the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm within a few years, I am confident that our family will bestow a proper technique upon you... one that will make you comparable to the legendary Jianixi!"

Overwhelmed with emotion and now with tears streaming down his face, Shamoli nodded vigorously, bowing deeply to Li Yuanjiao. He then made a loud declaration through his tightly gritted teeth.

"No thanks needed! As long as I live, you, Brother Yuanjiao... are the king of the kings in Mount Yue!"




# Chapter 184: Envoy from Mount Yue

In the great hall, the candlelight flickered. Li Yuanxiu stood to the side at the highest seat with an envoy from Mount Yue kneeling below him, his head pressed firmly against the ground.

He spoke with respect, "My humble self greets the Young Family Head! Our king remembers the friendship between our two families and often speaks of the health of my aunt and uncle, and recalls the alliance between our two families... He has sent many products from our region. Currently, the position of queen remains vacant, and the king still hopes to marry a daughter from the Li Family..."

Li Yuanxiu stepped forward and descended two steps from his elevated position. The clan soldiers on both sides immediately focused their attention on this envoy from Mount Yue.

Chen Donghe, who was standing below the steps, also went on high alert, ready for any sudden movements from the visitor.

"Our Li Family is located in the east and has only heard of the upheavals in Mount Yue. Mu Jiaoman's side branches have all perished without survivors... With the envoy coming from afar, can you enlighten me on this matter?"

Li Yuanxiu did not respond to the envoy's initial address, instead bringing up the details of the unrest in Mount Yue. This caused the envoy to stammer and sweat profusely.

The current king of Mount Yue, Qimu, although following Mu Jiaoman's orders to kill his brothers, had such an excuse often doubted within his own territory. Naturally, that excuse alone was not sufficient to convince Li Yuanxiu.

The envoy could only shakily say, "There was unrest... it resulted in the death of the previous king's heirs, and a change in kingship is inevitable... it wasn't our king's intention. He made sure to protect the mother queen, which was indeed meritorious!"

The 'mother queen' naturally referred to the woman from the Li Family who had been married off there. Mu Jiaoman, while keeping the woman in his palace, acted cautiously, never allowing her to bear children. Her status in the palace was quite unique, and during the turmoil, forces from all sides sent protection for her immediately.

Li Yuanxiu listened but made no response. Observing the Mount Yue envoy trembling before him, he contemplated to himself quietly.

Before Shamoli breaks through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, we should pacify Qimu to prevent him from becoming suspicious and seek help elsewhere, potentially causing trouble. Everything should remain as usual, making him feel at ease.

Tributes and trade are easy to agree upon; it's just a matter of issuing another order. However, if a daughter of our clan were to marry over there... wouldn't she become a widow within a few years? There are many daughters in the minor clans right now, but several clan uncles and elders will inevitably make a fuss.

The envoy from Mount Yue, not understanding the situation, thought Li Yuanxiu was angry and trembled like a leaf. His sweat was pooling on the stone floor, almost forming a small puddle.

Li Yuanxiu then spoke up, breaking the silence softly.

"Mount Yue wishes to continue the marital alliance with our family, and we, the Li Family, also agree. Matters of tributes and trade will follow the old practices; there is no need for changes."

"Thank you, great king! Thank you, great king!"

The envoy bowed deeply several times in relief, blurting out his thanks, calling Li Yuanxiu a "great king". Li Yuanxiu raised his hand slightly, smiling warmly.

"However... our family does not have many daughters to marry off as of now. They hold significant status within the clan, so we can't simply arrange a marriage... Besides, my father is currently cultivating in seclusion. I, the Young Family Head, am not easy to persuade like my father. There is one condition for this marital alliance with Mount Yue."

"Do tell, great king," the envoy quickly said, to which Li Yuanxiu, still smiling, replied, "How could my family's daughter marry into the West without land to showcase her prestige? To the west of Eastern Mount Yue, there are several villages. Let Qimu conquer a few villages to the west as a celebration gift for our daughter's wedding."

"T-That's..."

Caught off guard by Li Yuanxiu's demand, the Mount Yue envoy momentarily froze, knowing well that granting lands to a daughter who would wield no real power upon marrying out merely meant extra tax revenue from those lands.

He could only respond, "Would it be possible to grant a land or two from the various villages of Eastern Mount Yue? Our king is not stingy! The region is unstable, and it might not be advisable to mobilize troops rashly..."

Li Yuanxiu frowned and, cutting him off mid-sentence with a commanding tone, challenged, "Is this truly the extent of your king's sincerity?!"

As Mount Yue was in a position of weakness and reliant on the Li Family for survival, the envoy, naturally becoming submissive, panicked under Li Yuanxiu's intimidation and started begging for mercy.

"This lowly one will report back to the king immediately! A response will be provided within a few days... please, forgive me, Young Family Head!"

"You're dismissed."

Li Yuanxiu simply waved his hand, and the envoy hurriedly retreated.

Then, a clan soldier brought forward another person dressed in Mount Yue attire who kneeled and cupped his fist instead as he greeted, "Young Family Head!"

"What news does my clan sister bring?" Li Yuanxiu asked, lifting his head.

The messenger from Mount Yue then pulled a thick stack of documents from his chest pocket and replied respectfully, "The Queen Mother has recorded all the arrangements Qimu made upon ascending to power, along with the distribution and locations of Mount Yue cultivators within the state here."

Li Pingyi stepped forward to receive the book, and Li Yuanxiu nodded with a smile. He then said softly, "Tell my clan sister when you return to first excel in her role as Queen Mother, and within these few years, we'll find a way for her to reunite with her family."

"Understood."

The man bowed in gratitude and withdrew.

Li Yuanxiu then took the stack of documents from the approaching Li Pingyi, spread them out, and began to read. He muttered to himself, "Three at the early stage of Qi Cultivation Realm... one at the mid-stage... all are cultivators with unrefined qi. Mount Yue is indeed too weak; no wonder Qimu was able to stabilize the state in one fell swoop. He couldn't afford to wait and has come to affiliate himself."

As Li Yuanxiu read on, Li Yuanjiao was already standing in the courtyard. He glanced at the Mount Yue messenger. Once the messenger had exited the courtyard, Li Yuanjiao spoke, "Although our clan sister is from the minor sect, she's no easy mark. Mu Jiaoman was wary of her while alive, yet she quickly garnered support after his death and meticulously gathered information, placing people within the trade caravans that were returning home, which is no small feat."

"Hmm."

Li Yuanxiu simply nodded, continuing to read the letter before responding, "When selecting a daughter from the minor clan to go west that year, she was chosen with great care, and her entourage was loyal. When she returns, we must acknowledge her and her group's contributions."

The Li Family's marriages were certainly more strategic than when Mu Yalu had come over alone in her time. Not only could the clan daughter return home annually, but she could also bring many loyal attendants along with her.

After listening to his brother's explanation, Li Yuanjiao nodded in agreement.

"Brother, Shamoli has already broken through the fifth stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm and has been persuaded by me to go into seclusion... The spirit fruits have also been delivered to him. With these aids, he should attempt to break through the Qi Cultivation Realm within two years."

"Good!" Li Yuanxiu commended as he nodded. He pondered for a moment, then softly added, "I'll also personally go up the mountain to make sure that our family is prepared with a portion of unrefined qi."

Li Yuanjiao chuckled softly and responded, "From what I managed to listen to outside, brother, your method is indeed effective. No matter whether the new king of Mount Yue takes one or two towns in the west, in the end, it will still belong to our Li Family!"

Li Yuanxiu's face, which bore a resemblance to Li Yuanjiao's but with a more relaxed and casual expression, curved into a smile. He glanced at his brother below and replied, "We both know the family's strategies; it's merely closing a loop. With Mount Wu sealed off, the villages of Mount Yue to the west have lost their backing. According to the reports, Qimu also harbors ambitions to expand westward... I'm merely giving him reasons to act. When he conquers more villages for our family, his troops will also suffer from the strain and commit atrocities. It will be more legitimate for Shamoli to replace him then."

"You always think things through so thoroughly," Li Yuanjiao praised with a smile of awe.

Li Yuanxiu waved his hand and replied, "It's a small move that doesn't greatly impact the overall situation, but it'll make subsequent plans run more smoothly."

"As for the clan daughter to be married off... brother, whom do you plan to send?" Li Yuanjiao asked.

Li Yuanxiu shifted his gaze from the letter and his voice was soft when he replied, "Nobody."

Li Yuanjiao was momentarily stunned, then quickly grasped his brother's intention, murmuring, "Brother, I understand your care for our clanspeople, but will this really work..?"

"Li Yuanxiu smiled and nodded, explaining, "We'll find a respectable family in the town that's willing to provide a daughter... We will then train her up and send her over. Whether Qimu realizes it or not, he'll have to pinch his nose and accept her. Would he dare complain? Once we control Eastern Mount Yue, we can bring her back, and she'll have earned the status of a branch family. Surely, many families will be willing to volunteer themselves then!"

Li Yuanjiao lowered his eyes slightly. His care for his clan members was based on affection rather than bloodline, and he was inclined to truly send a clan daughter to appease Qimu, even if there was a slight chance of causing a disturbance.

However, since Li Yuanxiu had spoken thus, he could only nod in agreement. He replied solemnly, "As long as you are confident about this, Brother."

Li Yuanxiu looked at him, catching wind of the disagreement in his mind. Setting aside what he was holding, he then said gently, "Qimu is requesting a daughter from the minor sect... There are five bloodlines within the minor sect, which have been separated since our great-grandfather's time. The elders from families are very old and usually silent, yet their feelings must be considered. These people are closely related to us and are instrumental in managing our household affairs. Several of the elders have the ear of our father and granduncle. If we were really to marry off a clan daughter indiscriminately, the clan's elders would have significant objections... Remember, harmony within the family is paramount."

Li Yuanjiao scoffed at this.

"Who cares what they think?! They're just ordinary people."

"Jiao'er!" Li Yuanxiu shook his head, saying in a stern voice, "The reason our family stays closely knit is firstly due to the orderly transmission of our cultivation techniques, and secondly, because of the humility and respect within our ranks‚Äîfrom honoring the elderly to cherishing the young. If these principles collapse, what follows will be endless bloody strife and a disordered, fragmented clan, rendering the intelligence of future generations useless. We are the role models for the younger generations; they will remember how you act today. Don't underestimate those noisy elders; they may seem to fuss over securing advantages for their descendants, but they understand the gravity of major right and wrong. They restrain their descendants from disgraceful acts, contributing significantly to the stability ensured by the Clan Affairs Courtyard."

Li Yuanxiu stared into his brother's eyes, explaining, "If these elders see their children committing acts that disgrace the family, they would even hobble over to the Clan Affairs Courtyard with their canes to report it. They understand the importance of the family's reputation and deeply wish for its prosperity. Moreover, for the sake of the family, Uncle Qiuyang and several cultivators from the minor sect have been diligently supporting us. If you marry off their children like this today, and annihilate Qimu tomorrow, it will dishearten these people."

Li Yuanjiao opened his mouth, not expecting Li Yuanxiu to have thought so deeply. His view of those nagging elders improved significantly, and he nodded, murmuring, "I see... thank you for enlightening me, Brother!"

Li Yuanxiu nodded approvingly, continuing, "In the past, it was natural to be cautious of those from the minor sects when our main family lacked capable cultivators. Now that our main family is thriving, with our granduncle's swordsmanship unmatched on the lake, these minor sects and branches are invaluable aids in managing our affairs. The approach should be to embrace and favor them, treating them as our own."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in agreement. The brothers exchanged a smile and a few more pleasantries before Li Yuanxiu chuckled and revealed, "I've now broken through to the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm!"

"Really?"

Li Yuanxiu had started cultivating earlier than Li Yuanjiao, who had rapidly advanced through the Profound Scenery Stage thanks to a talisman seed, and had broken through to the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm a few months earlier. Li Yuanxiu, catching up a few months later, also had a commendable pace.

"Why would I even lie about that?" Li Yuanjiao laughed.

Li Yuanxiu calculated the time and spoke, somewhat concerned, "As the day of the sacrifice ritual approaches, with several elders still in seclusion aiming for breakthroughs and no sacrificial offerings prepared, I've already made arrangements... But I fear if the elders don't emerge soon, we might miss the deadline."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

At the cave dwelling on Meiche Peak, there were three stone chambers where Li Tongya, Li Xuanxuan, and Li Xuanfeng each resided in seclusion. Li Xuanling, however, meditated in the great hall, having sat cross-legged on a straw mat throughout the night. The main door of the cave trembled slightly, and two clan soldiers stepped aside as a woman dressed in a white robe entered.

She had a dignified appearance and smiled gently at him.
ùëìùëü‚ÑØùò¶ùìåùò¶ùò£ùëõùëúùìãùëíùìÅ.ùëê‚Ñ¥ùìÇ

"My dear," Lu Wanrong said, now at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm in her cultivation‚Äîconsidered quite capable among the external clan cultivators. With a warm smile, she approached him, holding a bamboo-woven food basket which she placed on the stone table.

Li Xuanling spoke softly upon seeing this, "They could have brought it up; you didn't need to trouble yourself by coming all the way here..."

Cultivators at the first four stages of the Embryonic Breathing Realm exhibit vigorous blood qi and consume large amounts of food. Once they break through the crucial Jade Capital Stage and transcend the mortal realm, their need for food drastically reduces.

Upon reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm, and being blessed with the longevity of a deity, they sustained themselves on air and dew, needing only to drink clean water. If they eat at all, it must be spirit meat or spirit rice, as secular food could hinder their cultivation progress.

Li Xuanling, at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm and a step or two from the Qi Cultivation Realm, still required regular meals; roughly once every day or two. Now that his household was prosperous, he no longer consumed ordinary grain but spirit rice and demon beast meat instead.

Lu Wanrong opened the food basket and retrieved two tiers‚Äîone containing steamed, pristine spirit rice, and the other several slices of tender, red demon meat.

Li Xuanling took the jade chopsticks from his wife and ate slowly, chewing thoughtfully.

After he was done, Lu Wanrong handed him some tea which he accepted gracefully. She spoke softly, "Yuanyun hasn't come down from the mountain for over a year, and I'm really worried about him. He's very proud at heart, and despite the setback, he won't share his troubles with us..."

Li Xuanling's expression became pained and slightly guilty as he responded to his wife's concerns.

"I'm aware of that."




# Chapter 186: Preparing for the Sacrifice

Li Xuanling set down his chopsticks, his expression turning somewhat despondent.

After a long pause, he said, "What else can we do? Yuanyun finds solace in the company of Sister Jingtian as they share similar fates... If he wishes to stay on the mountain and read, let him. We can't possibly ask him to come down, that'd only hurt him more."

Lu Wanrong sighed softly.

"It would be best if she's willing to teach him. I initially thought about having him come down the mountain to manage some worldly affairs to distract him as that might ease his melancholy over time."

Having seen many such kinsfolk without spiritual orifice in her youth, Lu Wanrong was experienced in dealing with such situations. She had come to make this suggestion, but knowing that staying with Li Jingtian was preferable to coming down the mountain, she changed the subject.

"Qinghong loves to train with a spear, but we lack a proper master at home. Now that she has reached the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, not even the skilled mortals below can match her. My dear, could you possibly find a good teacher for her?"

"I'll keep it in mind and ask my father when I get the chance," Li Xuanling replied as he nodded in agreement.

As the couple shared an intimate moment together, the stone door beside them creaked. Some dust flew up as it moved aside to reveal a young man carrying a golden longbow who stepped out.

Seeing the couple, he raised an eyebrow and greeted them.

"Brother Ling, sister-in-law."

"Greetings, elder brother," they both replied as they stood up.

Li Xuanfeng nodded, his demeanor fairly relaxed as he said, "I've just broken through to the fourth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm. With the day of the ritual approaching, I decided to step out for some fresh air."

Li Xuanling breathed a sigh of relief.

"We still haven't secured a demon beast for the sacrifice. With father deep in his breakthrough, I dare not disturb him. I'm glad you're out now; Yuanxiu was just about to knock on your door."

Placing his Golden Age Longbow on the ground, causing a gust of air to burst forth, Li Xuanfeng joined Li Xuanling at the table as the latter recounted the happenings of recent years.

After listening, Li Xuanfeng responded, "It's fortunate that all is well. Once Shamoli achieves the Qi Cultivation Realm, Second Uncle won't need to be troubled. With my bow alone, not a single Qi Cultivator from Mount Yue will escape."

Li Xuanling smiled and nodded, adding, "We still haven't gathered the unrefined qi needed for Shamoli's cultivation. I've asked Donghe to keep an eye out for it. Not having broken through to Qi Cultivation Realm myself, I'm unsure if we'll manage in time."

"No matter. Now that I am out, I can simply collect it during thunderstorms. After all, it's just unrefined qi and doesn't require much effort," Li Xuanfeng said as he reassured him.

By the time he finished speaking, Lu Wanrong had prepared some tea and had served it in two jade cups for the men.

Li Xuanfeng took a sip and asked with a smile, "How is Yuanxiu managing the household?"

Li Xuanling set down his jade cup, his expression filled with satisfaction as he spoke softly.

"He handles it skillfully, managing to sway all branches of the family. Even those elders who are a constant headache for Xuanxuan have come to praise him to me. He skillfully balances severity and gentleness, fosters closeness among the major and minor branches, and has incited such competition among the external cultivators that their age-old silent agreements have collapsed overnight... This boy manages our household better than either of us ever did!"

Li Xuanfeng was momentarily stunned by Li Xuanling's high praise, then slapped his thigh and exclaimed, "Really?! He was such a quiet kid... I never imagined he'd be so capable!"

Li Xuanling beamed as he spoke of Li Yuanxiu.

"Xiu'er is subtly brilliant. His unassuming appearance often makes people underestimate him, only to find themselves ensnared in his schemes before they realize it. Jiao'er, on the contrary, projects bravery and resolution from the outset. Both brothers are formidable in their own right!"

"Hahahaha!"

After years of separation, Li Xuanfeng and Li Xuanling conversed a while longer before a brief silence fell between them.

Li Xuanfeng reached for his long bow and excused himself with a smile, saying, "I'll go settle the matter regarding the sacrificial beast. The sooner we address the issue, the fewer worries we'll have."

After bidding farewell, he flew out of the cave dwelling and into the mountains.

Watching Li Xuanfeng disappear into the distance, Lu Wanrong murmured, "My brother-in-law is nearly thirty and still hasn't married or had children. It's becoming an issue."

Lu Wanrong had only met Li Xuanfeng a few times and hence did not share a strong bond with her husband's brother. Despite her comment, she felt somewhat relieved deep down. After all, the more children there were in the family, the less attention would be given to her own daughter, Qinghong. Still, as a sister-in-law, it was proper to show concern.

"Indeed," Li Xuanling agreed, showing genuine concern. He then continued, "But that incident was a hard blow to him... I fear he has little inclination to think of marriage right now. We won't be able to persuade him... only Father can."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Xuanfeng soared into the air, following the route he had once taken with Li Tongya when they had ambushed the two individuals from Changxiao Gate. After the time taken to burn a stick of incense, he finally landed under a large banyan tree with white leaves.

A large fox was busily digging at something by the tree roots, surrounded by various other foxes that were hopping around. The little ones were unafraid of Li Xuanfeng, even sniffing curiously around his feet.

"Greetings, Senior!" Li Xuanfeng called out, cupping his fist respectfully.

The fox paused in surprise before anxiously asking, "Where's Li Tongya? Why are you here instead? Surely, he hasn't... died out there, has he?"

"The elder is currently in seclusion focusing on his breakthrough, so he sent me here instead," Li Xuanfeng replied reassuringly.

The fox then stood upright, exclaiming nervously, "Is he attempting to attain the Foundation Establishment Realm?! That's a life-and-death trial..."

"My second uncle is now at the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. His seclusion is not for attaining the Foundation Establishment Realm," Li Xuanfeng clarified.

The fox calmed down upon hearing this, saying, "Humans really cultivate fast! It takes you just a few years to break through a heavenly layer... soon, he'll surpass me."

After a glance at Li Xuanfeng, the fox said mysteriously, "I heard from the great demons of my clan that the ruler of Mount Yue is about to die of old age... Are you aware of this? Your home borders the mountain region; you should be prepared!"

Li Xuanfeng appreciated the fox's concern for Li Tongya and its prompt advice for the Li Family. He thought to himself, It's funny how the demons of this world often seem more sincere than humans...

Thinking this, Li Xuanfeng responded aloud, "Thank you for the warning, Senior. My family is already aware of it."

"Good to know," the fox huffed, seemingly frustrated at not eliciting a more dramatic reaction from Li Xuanfeng, which seemed to itch its need to share gossip.

Laying down on the ground, the fox then decided to pry further.

"What brings you here?"

"I seek to capture a couple of demon beasts. Do you have any advice for me, Senior?" Li Xuanfeng asked, making the intention of his visit known.

The fox accepted the Spirit Paddies from Li Xuanfeng and smiled, revealing the locations of several demon beasts.

As Li Xuanfeng flew away, the fox stuffed its mouth with the paddies while wagging its tail and chittering to itself happily.

"That's a nice golden bow!"

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Xuanfeng flew for an hour and came upon a hill shrouded in mist, dotted with fruit trees. Deer and horned horses roamed among them. He peered closely, searching for the creatures he sought.

"The fox mentioned a pack of hyenas here, with two at the Qi Cultivation Realm... but I see nothing, not even a trace of demonic qi! They hide well!"

Li Xuanfeng observed for a while longer and finally spotted a gray hyena sitting on a large rock. It seemed to have attained the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, with robust hind legs and weaker front limbs. Sitting like a child on the rock, it watched the deer below. At first glance, it looked like a child in a gray fur coat.

"Is it... herding?" Li Xuanfeng wondered to himself.




# Chapter 187: The Hyena Demon

Li Xuanfeng watched in amazement as the hyena occasionally howled loudly, commanding the other hyenas to drive the deer to another lush grazing area. Once the deer had nearly finished grazing, they were herded back into the forest.

Li Xuanfeng, who had hunted many demons in the mountains for years, had never seen such a phenomenon and patiently waited the entire afternoon. As the sun set and everything was eventually basked in its orange glow, the hyena finally selected a few deer and awkwardly led them deeper into the forest, using its forelimbs like arms, staggering oddly on two legs.

Despite its ineptitude, the gray-haired hyena stumbled a few times after just a few steps, getting so frustrated that it threw down the rope and howled angrily before switching to running on all fours, guiding the rope with its mouth.

Li Xuanfeng, using a stealth spell, followed the hyena closely as it navigated through the woods to a large rock face covered in green vines. It had a large cave entrance where light and two other hyenas could be seen sleeping at the entrance. The gray hyena howled once before awkwardly entering.

The other two hyenas, merely at the second and third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, did not challenge Li Xuanfeng as he confidently passed by them. Soon, he could hear the crackling of fire and the noisy chattering from within.

"Yip yip, ha ha..."

Inside, it sounded like a group of playful children‚Äînoisy and lively with intermingling sharp cackles, robust laughs, and occasional murmurs and giggles. The voices echoed erratically throughout the cave.

The dim, reddish light of the fire cast bizarre, twisting shadows on the cave walls, resembling a chaotic dance of demons. Amidst the laughter were intermittent cries of deer, creating an eerie atmosphere.

Having heard the fox describe the hyena's laughter as childlike and unsettling, Li Xuanfeng was now fully witnessing it. Knowing that there were Qi Cultivation Realm demons inside, he dared not probe with his spiritual sense, fearing that he might alert them of his presence.

He lingered at the cave entrance, pondering, The narrow confines of the cave are ill-suited for bow combat... I need to find a way to lure them out.

Thus, he retreated a few miles and pondered for a moment before settling around the forest perimeter. With a flick of his fingers, he conjured a flame with his mana and moved it closer to a large locust tree, which instantly crackled as the fire climbed its branches. In mere moments, the entire tree was aflame.

The night wind was favorable, sparing Li Xuanfeng the effort of conjuring a windstorm with his mana. He then flew a few miles away and waited patiently. As expected, a pack of hyenas soon arrived, frantically circling the growing wildfire and howling.

These hyenas, merely minor demons at the Embryonic Breathing Realm, were naturally powerless against the flames. After about the time it took a stick of incense to burn, two gusts of demonic wind finally arrived, summoning rain from above using their mana.

These two Qi Cultivation Realm hyenas appeared to lack any sophisticated lineage and were unfamiliar with techniques like cloud manipulation; they merely used their mana to mobilize the moisture in the air. Given the recent damp weather and abundant nighttime humidity, the fire gradually diminished.

Li Xuanfeng did not attack immediately but waited quietly from a distance, firstly to let the two demons deplete some of their mana, and secondly, there were many other great demons in Mount Dali. If the fire escalated, it could attract countless other demons, creating unnecessary trouble for him.

Once the flames had mostly subsided, Li Xuanfeng drew his bow and nocked an arrow. The bowstring shimmered in bright gold before he released the arrow, sending it speeding directly toward the back of one of the demons.

The demon, who was patrolling the forest atop the wind, was caught off guard by the arrow flying toward it. Its fur bristled in alarm, and it barely managed to conjure a grayish-black demonic shield in a desperate attempt to block the incoming attack, all while letting out a loud screech.

However, the demonic shield shattered like thin paper in the face of the golden arrow. The Qi Cultivation Realm hyena was pinned to the ground like a regular hyena, wailing pitifully.

"This one's a bit weak... I shouldn't kill it with a single arrow," Li Xuanfeng remarked from a distance. Unable to accurately judge the opponent's cultivation with his spiritual sense due to the distance, Li Xuanfeng pinned it down with one arrow. The Astral Qi had already begun to spread within the demon's body, potentially killing it instantly.

Li Xuanfeng quickly aimed to attack the other hyena, but unexpectedly, the hyena was quick to react and bold enough to rush toward him, exhaling a black breath toward his face.

Li Xuanfeng raised his bow to shield himself, and the hyena, with its fourth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm and apparently experienced in killing, knew of the frailty of cultivators' bodies. It swiped its claw towards his bow while continuously exhaling black breath.

Clang!

The hyena had dreadfully underestimated his opponent. Li Xuanfeng's bow was both heavy and hard, deflecting the claw with a metallic clang. Taking no chances, Li Xuanfeng concentrated his mana to block the deadly breath of the hyena, creating a dazzling display of mana light. The demon, unwilling to show weakness, attacked with its black claws, each strike heavy and powerful. Fortunately, Li Xuanfeng, having received the talisman, was as strong as a demon. The battle raged on fiercely and with great intensity.

With most of his cultivation invested in his bow, Li Xuanfeng's strength was significantly reduced when the demon got close. The cunning creature clung tightly to him, refusing to allow any distance between them, forcing the two into a stalemate.

After a dozen moves in a tense standoff in the air, Li Xuanfeng spotted an opening. With a swift motion, he slapped his storage pouch, causing two yellow talismans to fly out. They transformed into streams of fire, effectively blocking the demon's spells and providing him with momentary respite.

Seizing the opportunity, Li Xuanfeng retreated a few steps, drew his bowstring, and unleashed a radiant golden light toward the hyena's face.

The hyena demon shifted several times in the air, attempting to evade the relentless onslaught of the golden light, but to no avail. With no other option, it mustered a robust mana shield, summoning its courage to endure the powerful blast of golden light.

The Astral Qi exploded against the hyena demon's mana, disrupting its flow and creating an opening. Seizing the opportunity, Li Xuanfeng stepped back, each retreat accompanied by the release of an arrow. With each shot, he widened the gap between them, relentlessly bombarding the hyena demon with waves of golden light.

Within just a dozen breaths, Li Xuanfeng had released five arrows. Feeling overwhelmed, the hyena demon spewed a jet of black air aimed toward Li Xuanfeng before darting into the forest like a shooting star, hoping to utilize the cover of night and the dense woods to evade Li Xuanfeng's relentless barrage of arrows.

"What a fool!" Li Xuanfeng sneered coldly. With determination, he pulled an ebony arrow from his quiver, swiftly nocking it to his bow. Through the dense canopy of treetops, he fixed his gaze on the fleeing figure.

Though the distance was too great for his spiritual sense to accurately lock onto his target, the demon was affected by his Astral Qi, thereby granting Li Xuanfeng a faint sense of its position.

As the golden arrow accumulated power, it subtly adjusted its trajectory to match the movement of its target. With great precision, Li Xuanfeng gently released his hold, allowing the arrow to streak across the night sky before striking the ground with unerring accuracy.

The demon bristled in panic and frantically scratched at the ground, attempting to dig a hole where it could hide. Its efforts were futile, however, as it was too slow to evade the incoming attack.

The first arrow pierced through its flank, causing the demon to cry out in agony. Before it could gather its wits, a second arrow found its mark, leaving the creature gasping for breath as it collapsed to the ground in defeat.

Despite the creature's futile resistance, spitting intermittent bursts of black air, he used his mana to lift it effortlessly. With precision, Li Xuanfeng injected a stream of true essence into the creature's body, effectively sealing its cultivation. He picked up the subdued demon hurriedly and rode the wind once more to land beside the weaker demon he had already subdued earlier.

The weaker hyena demon was already struggling to breathe and gasping for air. It seemed to have only recently broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm. A group of Embryonic Breathing Realm hyena demons surrounded it, wailing softly. Upon seeing Li Xuanfeng land nearby, they scattered like leaves in the wind.
ùíáùíìùôöùíÜùîÄùìÆùì´ùíèùì∏ùô´ùìÆùìµ.ùì¨ùô§ùô¢

Li Xuanfeng quickly worked his mana to sustain its life. He removed the ebony arrows from both demons and carefully treated their wound before taking to the air with his trusty bow slung over his back. He then headed home with both demons in each of his hands.




# Chapter 188: Yuanxiu's Ritual

"Report!"

A clan soldier rushed into the courtyard and entered the rear hall, announcing his arrival at the door before kneeling down in a panic.

"Come in."

A youthful voice‚Äîclear and slightly high-pitched, characteristic of his age‚Äîcame from inside the hall.

The soldier entered the rear hall and presented a small letter to Li Pingyi, who approached him. His voice was solemn when he spoke.

"Report from Jingyang Town."

Li Yuanxiu read the letter and muttered, "The fourth son of the Tian Family and a male member of the Liu Family got into a fight on the streets of Jingyang Town, knocking out three of the Liu Family member's teeth... Incensed, the Liu Family sent a letter overnight to my aunt, seeking justice."

Li Yuanxiu was amused by the letter. Granduncle Li Tongya's wife was from the Liu Family, which afforded the Liu Family a certain status among the towns.

Although the Tian Family lacked powerful backers, several of its members held significant power, leading to endless disputes between the two families that had now escalated to Liu Rouxuan.

Li Yuanxiu could not help but comment, "They couldn't even handle such a trivial matter and decided to escalate a report..."

"Should we arrest the culprit?" Li Pingyi asked.

"No need," Li Yuanxiu responded softly, his voice low. He held a slight disdain for the Liu Family's manager; he could have stopped the report but chose not to intervene due to respect for his elders.

Soon after, another clan soldier entered the courtyard. Without looking up, Li Yuanxiu inquired, "What was my aunt's reaction?"

The soldier was momentarily stunned, not expecting Li Yuanxiu to predict his news.

Swallowing the long speech he had prepared, he responded succinctly, "The person from the Liu Family delivered the letter, but she only read it without responding..."

Li Yuanxiu simply nodded and pondered over the letter in front of him for a few moments. He then lifted his brush and wrote‚ÄîRead‚Äîbefore continuing, "Assign the guy from the Tian Family to the ebony mine for a three-year term."

Liu Rouxuan's response to receiving the letter was not to sternly reprimand her people for stirring up trouble but rather to remain silent.

Realizing that his aunt was somewhat dissatisfied with the Tian Family's actions yet refrained from acting due to her past relationship with his third aunt, Tian Yun, Li Yuanxiu decided to tactfully administer a mild punishment to the Tian Family.
ùïóùöõùöéùöéùê∞ùó≤ùóØùóªùöòùöüùöéùóπ.ùïîùê®ùïû

He then instructed Li Pingyi, "Send a younger family member to reprimand the Liu Family's manager. How dare they escalate such embarrassing minor issues to the elders? They lack discretion!"

"Understood," Li Pingyi responded quietly. Suddenly, he perked up his ears.

Li Yuanxiu also sensed that something was amiss and looked toward the courtyard.

Clang, clang...

The sound of weapons hitting the ground echoed as the clan soldiers outside all bowed their heads and kneeled, laying their weapons on the ground. Through the open courtyard gate, a robust figure swiftly emerged. Beneath his long eyebrows were a pair of calm eyes.

A man, carrying an impressively large, beak-nosed canine that was still squeaking, entered the courtyard nonchalantly. He had a gold bow ornately carved with patterns slung on his back and he smiled as he looked at Li Yuanxiu seated at the head of the hall.

The old guards in the rear hall were all familiar with this person, so they instantly kneeled and laid down their weapons as a gesture of respect.

Although Li Pingyi did not recognize the man, the sight of the iconic golden bow startled him, prompting him to kneel on one knee and bow his head as well.

"Welcome, Clan Uncle!"

Li Yuanxiu quickly set down his writing brush and hurried forward, cupping his fist respectfully.

"Greetings, Uncle!"

"Hahaha!"

Li Xuanfeng let the two demon beasts drop to the ground with a thud and laughed heartily. He scrutinized Li Yuanxiu, noting, "It's been years, and you're all grown up already. Xuanling told me you were modest, but I see you are handsome and wise, not just bright inside... Very good...very good indeed!"

Li Yuanxiu chuckled softly and replied, "The family still depends on the elders. My little cleverness is nothing special, I'm just managing the family's various branches as my duty."

Li Xuanfeng waved his hand, gesturing toward the two hyenas on the ground, explaining, "The sacrifice is nearing, and these two beasts I've captured are for that. I've sealed their powers. You should prepare for the sacrifice, it's likely that your second uncle and your father won't be able to attend due to their training in seclusion. Arrange everything properly; the household affairs are now in your hands."

"Understood," Li Yuanxiu replied as he nodded seriously.

Li Xuanfeng then inquired about Li Yuanxiu's progress in cultivation. After making sure that the young one had no questions regarding his training, Li Xuanfeng flew out of the courtyard.

Watching Li Xuanfeng leave with envy, Li Pingyi remarked, "With Clan Uncle out of seclusion, the family's upcoming sacrificial ritual should proceed smoothly now."

Li Yuanxiu agreed with a relieved smile, "Indeed. Summon the family elders... We need to consult them about the rituals. We can hold the ceremony at the end of the year."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Winter snow arrived on schedule, thoroughly icing over the shores of the lake. Every household lit lamps at the foot of the mountain according to the age-old tradition. Children worshiped the moon and frolicked before the lights, their laughter carrying far into the distance.

Li Yuanxiu consulted with the family elders and finalized the preparations for the sacrifice. The street market surged with people who craned their necks at the stone altar, whispering among themselves as they gazed at the two massive hyena demons strapped in place.

Lu Jiangxian's divine sense emerged from the mirror, observing the noisy scene below the mountain. Streams of pale golden incense flowed out, swirling like threads of gold, all converging on his mirror's surface.

"Time flies... three to five years pass in the blink of an eye. Is this what they call the seed of longevity?" he mumbled.

Lu Jiangxian, having spent nearly fifty years on the mountain, had watched Li Tongya evolve from a mortal to a Qi Cultivator. He had also seen Li Xuanxuan grow from a naive child into the head of a family, witnessed elders pass away, and children born.

A multitude of emotions welled within him.

Time flowed as usual within the mirror. Over the past decades, Lu Jiangxian had focused solely on studying shamanic spells within the mirror, deepening his understanding of the craft. The curses and spells he had developed were now potent enough to easily kill a Qi Cultivator.

"They are here."

In the town center of Lijing, the stone platform was filled with people prostrating themselves. The sacrificial stone knife penetrated the skulls and brains of the two hyena demons.

A robust flow of blood qi and essence qi rose, mingling with the pervasive incense before pouring into the mirror.

"The Li Family of Lijing offers respect along with fine delicacies and wine with unwavering devotion year upon year... Through the smoke of our offerings and the blood of our sacrifice, we call upon the gods, seeking their blessings."

Lu Jiangxian stood atop the mountain within the mirror's world, a wisp of gray talisman qi appearing in his hand.

Observing the changes in the talisman qi, he pondered for a moment before picking up a jade pot from the table, dividing half of the talisman qi for future study.

His divine sense circled a few of the younger generation of the Li Family below, musing to himself, Talisman qi is precious indeed... but to me, it costs nothing. However, if granted too freely, it loses its value and significance.

Looking at the people below, Lu Jiangxian planned his actions carefully.

From now on, each generation should only receive one or two talisman qi... It's better to focus on quality. The excess talisman qi could be condensed into talisman pills or stored for later use.

As for today's sacrifice... each person should only receive one talisman qi. If given now, it would only be a gray talisman of Qi Cultivation Realm, which isn't much. It's worth the wait though. Once Li Tongya achieves the Foundation Establishment Realm and secures a demon beast of that realm, I will bestow white talisman qi of the Foundation Establishment Realm to the generation of Yuan and Qing in the Li Family.

With his mind made up, Lu Jiangxian activated the mirror, condensing half of the talisman qi into talisman pills. In the stone chamber on the mountain, the bluish-gray mirror radiated a bright white light, calmly floating up and releasing six intricately patterned talisman pills.




# Chapter 189: The Concerns of Shamoli

Li Yuanxiu wiped his hands that were stained with the blood of the demon beasts and slowly descended from the altar.

His uncle, Li Xuanfeng, had already inquired about the situation and, after confirming that no one had received a talisman, had departed on the wind, leaving the younger generation behind to handle the aftermath.

With the sacrificial ritual completed, Li Xuanling took a talisman pill and retreated to the mountains to cultivate in seclusion. Having been at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm for several years, he planned to use the power of the talisman pill to break through to the sixth stage.

Touching the jade bottle in his pocket, Li Yuanxiu knew it contained a portion of unrefined qi.

Chen Donghe had been collecting it for two years, and after Li Xuanfeng emerged from seclusion, he and Chen Donghe had vigorously completed the collection over the past few months... specifically preparing it for Shamoli.

He glanced at Li Yuanjiao, who was engrossed in his own thoughts.
ùó≥ùê´ùöéùó≤ùö†ùöéùóØùïüùê®ùòÉùöéùóπ.ùó∞ùóºùó∫

He handed him the jade bottle, whispering, "The family's unrefined qi is ready. You should go up the mountain to fetch the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique, Make sure you make the necessary adjustments to the beginning and the end of the content before taking it to Shamoli for his cultivation."

"Understood."

Li Yuanjiao accepted the jade bottle with a curt nod. Perhaps feeling a bit down for not receiving a talisman this year, he took the bottle and tucked it into his chest pocket, murmuring, "Why did we not receive a talisman this year? Our fathers' generation used to get one, so why not us..."

"Well..."

At that, Li Yuanxiu smiled softly and ruffled his hair, responding, "Don't overthink it. If it did not happen this time, there's always a next time. We're only in our teens, there's no need to rush. Look at Qinghong, she did not receive a talisman either, yet she remains happy, training with her spear."

"She's just too carefree!" Li Yuanjiao laughed as he thought of Li Qinghong's cheerful demeanor. His spirits visibly lifted, but he had not expected a playful slap on his back, causing him to stagger.

Turning around, he saw Li Qinghong with a smirk, holding a wooden spear as usual. She teased with a smile, "I could hear you gossiping about me from afar, Brother Jiao!"

"Hmph."

Li Qinghong was a favorite among the family elders, and Li Yuanjiao, wary of her complaints, chose not to argue and turned back‚Äîonly to see Li Yuanyun holding back laughter, thoroughly amused by the scene.

"Brother Yun! What's so funny?!" Li Yuanjiao grumbled.

Li Yuanxiu finally could not hold back his laughter. He bent down to scoop both Li Yuanyun and Li Qinghong into his arms, balanced one in each, and smiled warmly.

"I find it funny too."

"Brother!"

Li Yuanjiao was also laughing now, but he quickly straightened up and became serious again, shedding his childish demeanor as he spoke.

"I have heard that absorbing unrefined qi is much easier than pure spiritual qi from the heaven and earth... It probably won't take long for you to need to mobilize troops and get ready."

"Of course," Li Yuanxiu nodded and smiled. "Currently, our standing army numbers are over five thousand. With just one command from me, we can mobilize over ten thousand troops. If Uncle takes care of the Qi Cultivators of Mount Yue, it won't take longer than three days before the entire Eastern Mount Yue is under our control."

Li Yuanyun, having read for several years, could not help but feel excited by these words, sensing the thrill of witnessing history. Li Yuanjiao nodded in agreement, and they walked down the street together, observing the clan soldiers who stepped aside with a slight smile playing on their lips.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

"Brother Shamoli, I have brought the items for you."

Li Yuanjiao held a jade slip in his hand, knocking on the stone door.

After a moment, the door slid open loudly and Shamoli emerged‚Äîhis beard unkempt, his expression full of anticipation.

He stammered, "Brother, did you... did you manage to obtain the technique and the spiritual qi of heaven and earth?"

Li Yuanjiao saw that Shamoli had made progress in his cultivation over the past few days and had not wasted time. He nodded in affirmation and replied, "Yes."

Overjoyed, Shamoli took the jade slip and jade bottle from Li Yuanjiao's hands, continuously expressing his gratitude.

Patting Shamoli on the shoulder, Li Yuanjiao pulled out two more jade bottles from his chest pocket and explained, "I have also obtained two pills for you. One is called the Snake Essence Pill, which is used for breaking through to the Qi Cultivation Realm."

Shamoli took the jade bottle from Li Yuanjiao, and upon channeling his spiritual sense into it, indeed found a white round pill inside it.

Li Yuanjiao continued, "The second one is a unique pill of our Easterners, called Moonlight Pill. Take it immediately to break through to the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."

The pill Li Yuanjiao brought was in fact a talisman pill, but fearing that Shamoli might inadvertently cause trouble if he knew its true nature, he had not revealed its real name and instead had made up a name for it.

Shamoli, upon receiving the bottle and seeing a white pill covered in intricate patterns, felt it was even more precious than the Snake Essence Pill and said hurriedly, "This... this is too valuable! How can I possibly accept it?! After all the trouble I have caused you, I can't possibly accept such a great favor from you...!"

"Enough of that. Time is of the essence!" Li Yuanjiao said as he cut him off with this reminder. He instructed Shamoli to take a spiritual oath to never reveal anything about the pill or the technique before cupping his fist to him and leaving.

Shamoli courteously saw him off, then turned back with renewed vigor as he entered the secret chamber happily. He carefully placed the jade slip on his left and the jade bottle on his right then gazed at the two items on the ground in a daze.

A sudden change from elation to a mix of guilt and fear overwhelmed him, coming so swiftly that it made his head spin. He understood all too well that opening the coveted jade slip and consuming the spiritual qi that he received without lifting his finger could grant him a lifespan of two hundred years as a Qi Cultivator, and the kingship he had dreamt of for over twenty years would be within easy reach.

Yet, Shamoli also recognized that by doing so, he would lead the foreign army across the soil of his homeland, subjugating hundreds of thousands of his people in body and spirit.

Eastern Mount Yue would be reduced to nothing more than a name. The entire nation, from the court to the common people, would depend on the whim of the Easterners. His elder brother, who had always been superior to him, would also be executed, leaving him, a mediocre man, to rule Eastern Mount Yue.

"Is it worth it..? That is the lifetime effort of my father..."

Shamoli could almost see his stern father standing coldly before him. Suddenly, the reachable throne and spiritual qi lost their allure. He wavered for a moment and then, frightened by his own hesitation, began to tremble.

Shamoli did not dare contemplate how the Li Family might deal with him, aware that the family had Qi Cultivators in its late stage, likely observing him from the sky at that very moment. Even if he were to achieve the Qi Cultivation Realm and attempt to flee, he could not possibly escape far...

"Father, I'm afraid of death... Who isn't? If I weren't so afraid of dying, I would have faced execution in the palace long ago instead of fleeing to the eastern lands... I really don't want to die!" Shamoli cried out as he slowly closed his eyes, recalling how his father, Mu Jiaoman, had consolidated his territory in the months following the death of Jianixi, using numerous underhanded methods and killing many of their own people in the process. And yet now here he was, weakly submitting to the Easterners.

With tears, he sneered to embolden himself, his eyes fiercely wide open as he muttered, "How can I say no? This is what you taught me, Father..."

He picked up the jade slip from the ground, sat up, and began reading intently. In a guilty tone, he whispered, "Qimu does not understand the vast ambitions of the Easterners; he will eventually end up delivering Eastern Mount Yue into their hands. Only I can save it... Father, only I can preserve Eastern Mount Yue."

His eyes became resolute as he found justifications for his actions, casting aside all his feelings of burden and guilt. Shamoli bowed his head, ground his teeth, and wiped his tears as he continued to immerse himself in the jade slip, gradually stabilizing his emotions.




# Chapter 190: Xu Gongming

"It's really damn cold!" the old man grumbled as the harsh winter wind lingered over the lake for months. The weather had slightly warmed in spring, but it was as cold as the winters of previous years.

The young plants stuck in the soil withered and turned yellow, not a single one survived. When the chill finally receded, summer warmed up only briefly before plunging back into a bone-chilling fall. That year, the fields yielded no crops, and the farmers, swallowing their pride, set down their hoes to forage in the mountains for food.

Old Master Xu sat in front of his house, shivering as he rubbed his hands together in the cold wind, calculating whether his family's remaining grain would last until next year. Since his father, Xu San, had passed away, he had been managing the household for over a decade and had become quite adept at it.

The Xu Family was one of the larger families in the town, although far scruffier compared to the Tian and Liu families. They had never managed a town during the era when the Li Family rose to power and had naturally declined over the years.

While the number of their family members had swollen thanks to the Li Family's exploitations of Mount Yue and absorbing refugees from the east, the family had not progressed, merely surviving year after year without any improvement.

Old Master Xu got up and strolled around the yard. After counting the grain left from the previous year, his courtyard door was knocked on twice.

"Who is it?"

"Uncle, it's me, Gongming!"

The gate creaked open, and a young man entered.

Old Master Xu stroked his beard and called out, "Gongming, come inside and sit."

As Xu Gongming entered the courtyard, he immediately said, "Uncle, have you heard? The main family is preparing to fight Mount Yue, and they are recruiting soldiers in town. There has been drumming for many days... I want to join the army. My parents, being farmers, are undecided, so they asked me to consult with you."

After Xu San's death, the Xu Family split, and each branch developed separately in town. As the eldest and somewhat educated, Old Master Xu naturally became the decision-maker of the family. He looked at the young man before him and hesitated to speak.

Xu Gongming, the only one in the family with a spiritual orifice and now at the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, became anxious seeing his uncle's silence and said in a low voice, "Uncle! No family in our town is as destitute as ours! The Liu Family has always owned lands in Jingyang and holds significant status since they are related to the ancestor of the main family through marriage. The Tian Family is thriving with many capable members controlling most spirit fields, and the Chen Family, though quiet, already boasts a Qi Cultivator... If our family is to find a way forward, it can only be through the military!"

Old Master Xu picked up a large bowl and squinted as he counted the grains inside, responding slowly, "The army is a tool for the townsfolk, but which battalion commander[1] is not from the Li Family..? Do not think it is that easy..."

Xu Gongming slumped into a shabby wooden chair, disheartened by his uncle's words which disrupted his hopeful plans. He urged hastily, "Then give me some advice... The Xu Family is about to fall into my hands, yet I feel powerless to do anything!"

Old Master Xu nodded but his face fell as he spotted a few mouse droppings at the bottom of the basket.

"If you want to join the army, that really is a good path. I do not know much about military formations or cultivation, but I can only teach you two words," he said.

"The first is loyalty."

Old Master Xu set the basket down, finally becoming serious. His face relaxed slightly, and in a low voice, he continued, "Our Xu Family once took revenge for the main family, and our contributions are acknowledged by the ancestor and current family head. Once you join the army, you will carry the name of our family and can immediately secure a decent position, thanks to the heritage left by our forebears. You must be willing to suffer wounds, and at crucial moments...even die. You need to be stern and impartial, even if it means offending others, and you must engrave this mark of loyalty deeply into the minds of those from the main family."

These words struck Xu Gongming like a hammer, and he finally understood why his parents had sent him to consult his uncle. He memorized these words carefully before asking, "And the second word is..?"

"The second is composure."

Old Master Xu, sitting beside him, stretched out his thin and bony fingers before saying softly, "The Young Master Xiu is well aware of the happenings within the family... In the army, do not seek accolades, but strive to avoid faults. When you see members of the main family, speak little, but remain silent and composed. Do not socialize too much in the army, and never promote your own family's young men. Handle everything impartially. If you can do this for twenty years, becoming a commander of a thousand is within reach. If you are lucky enough to break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, you could become a confidant of the family head, and our Xu Family could secure a place among the various towns."

"Twenty years..." Xu Gongming mumbled as he nodded silently, then quickly expressed his gratitude. He then asked about potential questions he might face if Li Yuanxiu summoned him.

The old man answered each question while picking up the basket, before impatiently shaking the rice basket.

"Enough talking, go and prepare your things."

Although he was caught off guard by his elder's curt dismissal, Xu Gongming knew his uncle had a peculiar temperament. He quickly thanked him again then left thoughtfully.

Old Master Xu sat in the courtyard for a while and looked at the rice basket in his hand. He picked out the few mouse droppings, shook the old rice in the basket, and murmured to himself.

"This will barely suffice..."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

"Xu Gongming..."

Li Yuanxiu opened the letter that was handed to him and read it. He recalled the situation of the Xu Family, and said softly, "This Xu Family member is the first Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator to join the army, is he not..?"

These cultivators, having barely stepped onto the path of immortality, cherished their lives immensely. When the family issued the conscription order, revealing plans to attack Mount Yue, they did not specifically summon these cultivators.

All of them pretended not to hear what was happening outside though they were usually busying themselves with singing, dancing, banquets, and outings. Now, they all obediently stayed at home farming; none ventured out to cause trouble.

"Yes," Li Pingyi responded, watching as Li Yuanxiu pondered for a moment, flipping the letter back and forth several times. He then murmured, "The Xu Family has also contributed to our family. Over the decades, we have given them opportunities, and my father even mentioned them specifically to me, but the Xu descendants have not grasped these opportunities well... leading unsatisfactory lives."

"Xu Gongming is already outside," Li Pingyi interjected, prompting Li Yuanxiu to nod.

"Call him in."

Shortly after, a young man around twenty-five or twenty-six years old walked in. He wore a sword at his waist and had an earnest look, appearing quite straightforward.

Upon seeing Li Yuanxiu, he cupped his fist and said in a deep voice, "Xu Gongming greets the young master." After speaking respectfully, Xu Gongming stood silently with his head bowed humbly.

Li Yuanxiu inquired about his family's circumstances. Xu Gongming answered succinctly and clearly; whether he had prepared his responses in advance or was simply quick-witted, his answers were all satisfactory.

Li Yuanxiu nodded slightly and said in a gentle voice, "You may go to the barracks tomorrow."

Xu Gongming cupped his fist again, his expression solemn as he withdrew without asking further about the position he would receive, simply departing silently.

Li Yuanxiu felt an increased respect for him and murmured, "The Xu Family has had a tough time over the years... Now that they finally have a member with a spiritual orifice, it seems he wishes to serve in the military. Let's start him off as a squadron leader of a hundred; his cultivation at the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm should be good enough for that role."

Most of the cultivators in the military were from the Li Family's minor sect and branches, with those at the first and second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm serving as squadron leaders of a hundred, and those at the third and fourth as battalion commanders of a thousand, totaling eight. With Xu Gongming, there were now nine cultivators.

As Li Yuanxiu was contemplating this, someone hurried into the courtyard. As usual, the clan soldiers kneeled one by one, laying their weapons on the ground as a gesture of respect. Seeing this, Li Yuanxiu quickly descended the steps.

Upon recognizing the figure, his face lit up with joy and he let out a loud exclamation.

"Father!"

1. The battalion commander here actually means a 1000-man commander. ‚òú




# Chapter 191: The Elders Emerge from Seclusion

"Xiu'er!"

The man smiled triumphantly; it was none other than Li Xuanxuan. Now that he had broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, becoming the fourth Qi Cultivator in the Li Family with a lifespan of two hundred years and the ability to ride the winds and traverse the heavens and earth, he was naturally in high spirits. Even his appearance seemed rejuvenated by several years.

"Father, you've emerged from seclusion!" Li Yuanxiu exclaimed joyfully as he descended the steps to greet his father who shook his sleeve with a proud flourish, boasting, "Your father has consumed the Cave Spring Clear Qi and condensed the Cave Spring True Essence, which brings prolonged vitality and skill in regulating qi and drawing talismans. Now, I am a Qi Cultivator! Not only me, but your granduncle has also broken through his seclusion, utilizing the power of the talisman pills to reach the ninth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm."

"That's amazing!" Li Yuanxiu grinned as he nodded repeatedly. As Li Xuanxuan displayed a wisp of pale blue true essence, revealing a lively and refreshing aura, Li Yuanxiu looked on enviously and cupped his fist.

"Now that Father is back, the stewardship of the family naturally returns to your hands."

He then stepped back, lifting his long robe slightly to kneel, indicating that he was handing back the authority of the family head to Li Xuanxuan.

Mention of this made Li Xuanxuan visibly flustered. He had managed the family for over a decade and wondered before his seclusion whether Li Yuanxiu could take over his role effectively. Upon emerging, he was surprised to learn that Li Xuanling praised the household's better order. Several elders shook their heads and sighed upon seeing him, leaving him bemused.

"Xiu'er, you're being too formal!" Li Xuanxuan said as he shook his head and stated seriously, "Now that I have achieved the Qi Cultivation Realm, I naturally need to devote myself to deep cultivation‚Äîparticularly in the art of talismans, to add more depth to our family's legacy. There's no reason for a Qi Cultivator to still cling to positions of power. Perhaps in a hundred years, when our Li Family has a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, and Qi Cultivators are numerous, then it would be suitable for a Qi Cultivator to lead the family. For now, you should continue to lead."

Li Xuanxuan then continued proudly, "Moreover, I was extremely pleased to hear from Xuanling how well you've managed the family over these years, so I descended the mountain to see you!"

Li Yuanxiu chuckled, his earlier remark just a formality. He knew well that Li Xuanxuan would not want the position back.

"During your seclusion, there was unrest in Mount Yue, and the heir, Shamoli, had fled eastward and is now attempting a breakthrough to the Qi Cultivation Realm in seclusion..." he said.

He then proceeded to explain their strategies against Mount Yue for the next few years. Li Xuanxuan, having already heard from Li Xuanling, listened again to Li Yuanxiu's account, then commented thoughtfully, "Shamoli's consumption of the unrefined qi is easier than pure spiritual qi of heaven and earth. This means that he's likely to emerge from seclusion within a year..."

The father and son, sitting at the head of the room, dismissed the guards and servants. Li Yuanxiu explained the family's internal strategies in detail, earning repeated nods and praise from Li Xuanxuan.

"Xuanling said you've surpassed us, but it seems he spared my feelings. This is far more than just surpassing!" he commented and laughed.

Although Li Yuanxiu was flattered, he repeatedly apologized for outshining his father. The father and son continued their cheerful conversation into the evening. The two even shared a meaningful dinner together before Li Xuanxuan returned to the mountains.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Tongya emerged from the cave dwelling, his body shimmering with true essence. Now a ninth heavenly layer Qi Cultivator, he was among the top cultivators over Moongaze Lake, matched only by a few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Despite this, he felt little joy, and a touch of worry tinged his mood.

"My cultivation speed is ultimately mediocre... Even using that precious talisman pill, it still took me three years to break through. Now that I'm approaching sixty, I fear I won't be able to make it!"

Feeling restless, Li Tongya exhaled slowly, looking at Li Xuanxuan's empty stone chamber, feeling somewhat relieved.

"Fortunately, Xuan'er has successfully broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm... We have another Qi Cultivator in the family, and this child is better at talisman drawing than I am. This will add another legacy to our family..." he mumbled to himself.

Li Tongya's knowledge of talisman arts came from the Spiritual Talisman Method manual brought back by Li Chejing, which included methods for twelve Embryonic Breathing Realm talisman arts and three Qi Cultivation Realm talisman arts. These were basic but widely applicable.

Unfortunately, Li Tongya lacked talent in this area. After over a decade, he had only mastered the Embryonic Breathing Realm talismans but had never succeeded with a Qi Cultivation Realm talisman. He eventually abandoned this pursuit to focus on sword cultivation.

Li Xuanxuan, possessing greater talent and a cultivation method more suited to drawing talismans, naturally became the most suitable candidate to assume the family's talisman duties.

Reflecting on his limited success with talismans and his nearly two-decades-long contributions to creating another source of income for the family, Li Tongya suddenly realized his current cultivation mindset was unacceptable.

"I'm rushing to break through to Foundation Establishment Realm by sixty, but such eagerness for quick success is a taboo in cultivation! Thankfully, I have decades of deep cultivation and the talisman pills to support me; otherwise, being stuck at the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm for years wouldn't be surprising. That would have been a real delay!"

Relieved, Li Tongya discarded his obsession with reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm before sixty and consoled himself silently, Progressing steadily in cultivation, even if I exceed sixty, is fine. Having experienced so much in my cultivation journey, whether I achieved Foundation Establishment Realm or not, I started as a mere farmer's son and now soar between heaven and earth, wandering freely with my sword. What more could I possibly demand from the world?

Breathing out deeply, Li Tongya, self-taught and without formal guidance, was thankful he could correct his path just by being cautious and reflective.

After meditating in the grand hall of the cave dwelling, he saw his son, Li Xuanling, approaching. He was a robust young man now.

"Congratulations on ending your seclusion, Father!"

"Mm..." Li Tongya nodded, his gaze briefly sweeping over his son. He smiled proudly before saying, "You have also reached the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm... In a few years, you should break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm."

"Yes." Li Xuanling sat beside his father, carefully choosing his words before speaking. "Father, Qinghong enjoys spearmanship, but we lack a master of spears at home... I thought of finding a good mentor for her."

"Spearmanship..."

Upon hearing this, Li Tongya raised his eyebrows. He suddenly remembered the Foundation Establishment Realm spear emitting faint electricity in his storage pouch, and a man named Fei Wangbai. He was the old man in a white brocade robe who also attended the banquet hosted by the Yu Family back then and happened to be the master of the spear.

"I have heard that someone from the Fei Family on the northern shore excels in spear techniques, possessing top-tier strength around the lake. The head of the Fei Family once invited me to visit their home... Perhaps this is a good opportunity to discuss this matter and foster good relations between our families," Li Tongya responded.

"That would be perfect!"

Li Xuanling was thrilled at the prospect. Although Fei Wangbai of the Fei Family had only recently achieved a breakthrough a few years ago, he was a genuine Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator.

Even if the Fei Family was unwilling to share their most guarded techniques, instruction from a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was still far superior to that from any Qi Cultivator.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

In the secret chamber of Lijing Town, Shamoli performed a series of hand seals, then held a small jade bottle. He exhaled thin wisps of pale purple air, rhythmically pulsing with each of his breaths. After eighty-one cycles, the streams gradually faded and vanished.

Shamoli suddenly opened his eyes, revealing a flicker of purple electricity, albeit slightly impure and delayed. A look of wild joy spread across his face as he clasped his hands, causing a flash of lightning-charged mana to circulate between his palms.

"Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique! Secret Thunder True Essence truly is overwhelmingly powerful... With a single strike of this lightning, ordinary Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators could be severely wounded. No wonder everyone envies the Path of Thunder; it really is remarkable!"

Shamoli paused to feel the mana surge within his body, smacking his lips with a hint of regret. "However, for some reason, the mana inside me feels somewhat inferior to what the scriptures describe for typical cultivators... It seems suited only for quick battles and lacks endurance."

Rising to his feet, Shamoli pushed the stone door open with his palm and looked out into the courtyard. The sunlight was soft on his skin, warm and comforting, much like the throne and life he was about to embrace.




# Chapter 192: Attacking Mount Yue

Shamoli raised his head as he walked out of the courtyard. However, much to his surprise, he did not see his usual large group of pampered wives and concubines.

The courtyard was empty, save for only a few leaves scattered on the ground. A middle-aged man stood there and was leaning against the stone chamber, watching him quietly.

"I am Chen Donghe, greetings to Your Majesty... Congratulations on your breakthrough to the Qi Cultivation Realm!"

Chen Donghe's greeting was polite. The title made Shamoli feel utterly content and pleased, causing him to nod happily.

With a sweep of his spiritual sense, he recognized that this man was at the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Shamoli had seen him before at the side of Li Yuanxiu, though it was only now that he found out his name. He then cupped his fist in response.

"Greetings, fellow Daoist!"

However, Chen Donghe did not acknowledge him but bowed deeply with respect and said in a solemn voice, "Second Uncle, this person is Shamoli."

Shamoli was momentarily startled. Upon realizing that another person was present, he instantly broke out in a cold sweat and was alarmed.

The newcomer was dressed simply in a gray robe. His eyebrows were long, and his demeanor was majestic. He carried a sword on his back that was wrapped tightly in cloth, yet another sword hung at his waist, which was rather unusual. His cultivation was evidently at the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

"Shamoli greets the elder..."

It was at that instant that Shamoli then realized that this man was in fact Li Tongya, the revered elder of the Li Family. In a flash, he was half-kneeling on the ground and cupping his fist, too nervous to speak.

Li Tongya glanced at him and said softly, "Show me your condensed true essence."

After observing the Secret Thunder True Essence in Shamoli's palm, Li Tongya nodded approvingly. The Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique was truly extraordinary, possessing significant power and the rare force of thunder. It was no wonder it required such hard-to-collect Profound Yin Thunder Liquid.

If Shamoli had cultivated using pure spiritual qi of heaven and earth, he would certainly be considered a strong cultivator in the early stages of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Li Tongya's spiritual sense surveyed Shamoli for a while before finally speaking again.

"Rise, I will send you back to Mount Yue to claim your throne."

Although Shamoli was prepared, he was still overwhelmingly excited upon hearing this. He lowered his other knee and repeatedly pressed his forehead on the ground, uttering words of thanks. When he looked up again, Li Tongya had already disappeared.

Before Shamoli could recover, several people hurried into the courtyard. They stripped him of his eastern garments and adorned him with various animal bones along with jade stones. The eastern-styled crown on his head was also removed along with the jade hairpin, causing his long hair to cascade over his shoulders. Now, he properly resembled a true man of Mount Yue.

"Um..."

Feeling his long hair tickling him, Shamoli, having stayed long in the eastern lands, secretly despised this disheveled appearance but could only chuckle awkwardly.

After changing his clothes and ornaments, Shamoli was led out of the courtyard. Upon seeing the steps in front of him lined with kneeling Mount Yue people‚Äîprepared by the Li Family as his retinue, including over ten of his playmates from recent years in the eastern lands‚Äîhe hurriedly descended the steps.

"Each of you is my backbone! Please, rise quickly!"

Shamoli's words came out impulsively, sounding nothing like what a great king of Mount Yue would say. The crowd got up with puzzled expressions. Only then did Shamoli, now beaming with joy, walk through the crowd and step onto a carriage pulled by two large horses.

Clatter...

Shamoli's banner was raised and he was escorted by a group of soldiers, marching majestically out of the town.

Lying in the spacious carriage, Shamoli listened to the clanging of weapons and the sound of footsteps, repeatedly touching the comfortable fabric of its interior. He picked up a fruit and placed it in his mouth before a satisfied smile formed at the corner of his lips.

"This is what life should be like! What were those earlier decades all about..."

The curtain flapped open unexpectedly, and in walked an old man with fleshy folds on his face, snow-white hair, and a matching beard. His bulging eyes bore into Shamoli with intense scrutiny. Startled, Shamoli choked and quickly straightened up, desperately trying to feign composure.

"Who might you be..?"

The old man, at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm and clad in Eastern attire with his white beard curling upward, relaxed his stern face a little. Looking quite elderly, he then spoke.

"Your Majesty should know... I belong to the Mount Yue tribe that once occupied the present Eastern Mount Yue. Having been defeated by Jianixi's eastward advance, I took refuge with the Easterners and followed Lord Xiangping back and forth through Mount Yue seven times, earning numerous merits over twenty-one years."

"You're Jianixi's adversary?!"

Shamoli was genuinely startled by the man's bold claims, knowing that someone like Jianixi was considered a divinely appointed ruler in Mount Yue. His own father had been merely one of Jianixi's generals.

He quickly showed his respect and asked politely, "May I know your name, Senior?"

"Ahuici!"

The old man grinned as he replied, revealing yellow teeth. He looked straight into Shamoli's eyes as he spoke slowly, "I am merely the Great King's high shaman, in charge of hunting, healing, and agriculture."

Shamoli stiffened momentarily. The high shaman's role in Mount Yue was akin to a vice king. Barely seated on the throne, the Li Family had already arranged everything, making him feel incredibly awkward. However, he did not dare show his emotions and instead forced a smile.

"I will need much assistance from you in the future!"

"That is already expected."

Watching Ahuici's neatly tied hair, Shamoli shifted uncomfortably in his seat. Finally unable to endure it any longer, he coiled his hair and secured it with a jade chopstick from the table.

"I really can't stand this barbaric look!" He laughed after letting out a huge sigh of relief.

Ahuici laughed heartily, lifting his head proudly.

"The etiquette of the Easterners is complex, Great King... you have much to learn!"

"Indeed!" Shamoli nodded solemnly.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

"Brother, have you thought through how we will govern this land of Mount Yue?" Li Yuanjiao asked as he stood in the swaying carriage, gazing into the distance at the rugged mountain road ahead.

Unlike Shamoli's carriage, the one he and Li Yuanxiu rode was a battle chariot designed for charging, offering a broad view. The cold wind slapped against their faces, but as cultivators in the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, they felt no chill at all.

"Hmm."

Li Yuanxiu nodded in response, resting his arm on the support next to him before speaking softly, "The common people of Mount Yue will be under Shamoli's control. We will operate behind the scenes, maintaining governance as usual, and all positions related to the path of immortality will be held by our people. Once we conquer Eastern Mount Yue, we will immediately survey the land and assess the spirit fields... These spirit fields and resources will rightfully belong to our Li Family. We will dispatch people to cultivate and harvest them. The territory of Eastern Mount Yue is vast, and there are likely many spirit fields."

Li Yuanjiao nodded as he listened to all this before whispering, "Our cultivators might not suffice; we'll have to choose the most fertile spirit fields to start with."

Li Yuanxiu smiled and shot a brief glance at Shamoli's carriage ahead before replying, "Eastern Mount Yue has over two hundred thousand people, we can turn many of them into cultivators of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Although these people might not be fit for combat, they can certainly cultivate spirit fields. Even if the people of Mount Yue are not skilled in farming, a few years living in the east will naturally make them eager to learn."

The brothers shared a smile. They recalled how over the years, many from Mount Yue who came east were influenced by the lavish and refined lifestyle. They voluntarily wore the easterner's attire‚Äîrobes and hair crowns‚Äîand adopted their official language. They even despised the natives of Mount Yue more than the native Easterners did. Hence, the brothers felt confident about changing these people.

"When the barbarians enter our land, they transform into Easterners!"

Li Yuanxiu chuckled before patting the long sword in his hand. He then lowered his voice and said, "What one cannot have is always the most precious... Once we control Eastern Mount Yue, we will strictly limit the eastward migration of the Mount Yue people and force them into selling their possessions in order to afford a trip east. Within twenty years, a top-down admiration for the east will pervade among them, and they will be no different from the Easterners!"




# Chapter 193: Qimu

Eastern Mount Yue had stationed a force of about two thousand soldiers at Big Fish Creek on the border between the two territories, guarded by a single Qi Cultivator.

Under the reign of Mu Jiaoman, there had been over five thousand soldiers, but now, the numbers had long dwindled.

Compared to the national strength of Eastern Mount Yue and the power of the Li Family, this military force was pitifully small. Perhaps Qimu had not even planned to resist the westward advance of the Li Family, thinking it was sufficient enough to have a Qi Cultivator to send alerts and messages.

Xu Gongming, following orders from Li Yuanxiu, led the troops as the vanguard. He took a hundred soldiers to probe the enemy's strength. Unexpectedly, they were met by a Mount Yue commander with a face full of ingratiating smiles who walked up to their formation unprotected. He was shouting as he approached.

"Is the envoy arriving?! My lord has already conquered his fief and has come to welcome the princess!"

Xu Gongming was stunned, his stern face almost cracking a smile, not expecting the commander to mistake their arrival as part of a wedding delegation. The surrounding soldiers looked at each other in confusion.

Xu Gongming quickly said, "Please, come talk inside the formation!"

The commander, still foolishly smiling and clad in armor mimicking that of the Easterners, approached even closer.

Xu Gongming's corner of his mouth twitched, and he stepped forward suddenly. Without warning, he stabbed the man with his sword, shook the blood off his blade, and waved his hand.

The troops below immediately sprang into action, charging at the unprepared Mount Yue forces. Blood splattered everywhere as they disrupted the enemy's formation, instantly creating a scene of great chaos and bloodshed.

The two armies behind pressed forward, and Xu Gongming, with his second stage Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivation, struck down enemies with each punch, fighting his way to the front of the formation.

As Xu Gongming fought fiercely, a figure suddenly flew up from the large camp. His voice reverberated across the battlefield, amplified by his mana.

It was the Mount Yue Qi Cultivator.

"Which faction are you from? How dare you cause chaos here?!"

This Qi Cultivator who was unaware of the situation, initially assumed that it was a mutiny. Only when he noticed the well-crafted armor of the troops below did he exclaim and recoil in shock.

"Easterners..?!"

"Do not panic, someone will deal with him." Seeing some of his soldiers hesitating, Xu Gongming smiled coldly and looked up. Sure enough, a golden light, like a shooting star, streaked from the east.

The Mount Yue Qi Cultivator did not even have time to react before he exploded into a shower of blood and flesh, raining down organs and meat chunks onto Xu Gongming's armor.

"Unrefined qi cultivators are just like that..."

Having cultivated for seven or eight years and having seen many of the Li Family's cultivators, Xu Gongming knew about unrefined and pure qi and understood that the Qi Cultivator of Mount Yue was particularly weak.

His eyelid twitched, and though he spoke with a false facade of toughness, he felt a growing reverence for the family elder who was a great archer.

Even though he cultivates with unrefined qi, he's still comparable to ordinary Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators. Yet, in front of that elder, he's less than a mortal... The elder is truly formidable! Whether it is due to his cultivation realm or the technique itself, the various qi gathering techniques of our family are indeed tempting...

Xu Gongming momentarily indulged in his thoughts, and by the time he snapped out of it, the Mount Yue army had completely collapsed, scattered around him like headless chickens. He tightened his grip on the long saber in his hand and ferociously pursued the remaining survivors.

In the sky above, a figure of a young man appeared. He was dressed in animal leather, yet wore a hair crown atop his head. A powerful voice echoed through the air.

"Qimu is inherently vicious, closely engaged in evil and perversion, harming the loyal and good, murdering siblings, and committing regicide. I am Shamoli, son of the former king! Today I raise arms to seize the throne, to bring justice back to our people... Lay down your weapons immediately! Those who surrender will not be killed."

"He's the lucky child..."

The soldiers of Mount Yue around Xu Gongming were already dropping their weapons and surrendering readily. Xu Gongming looked up at Shamoli, who stood proudly as he rode the winds, feeling a growing sense of deep envy.

Anyone with clear eyes could see that Shamoli was merely a puppet propped up by the Li Family, but who wouldn't envy him? He was granted the power of the Qi Cultivation Realm and gained a position of power. Even though he was constrained, he was still the sovereign of a nation, enjoying all the associated glory and wealth.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Xuanfeng stood with his bow and beside him was Li Tongya, who watched the Mount Yue Qi Cultivator explode like fireworks and nodded with a smile.

"Not bad... this arrow wouldn't just harm that unrefined Qi cultivator from Mount Yue; even a common early-stage Qi Cultivator would suffer greatly from it."

Li Xuanfeng lifted his bow and cupped his fist in response as spoke humbly.

"I have gained very much from my years of seclusion."

He turned his Golden Age Longbow in his hands, caressing the runes on it as a pale golden light illuminated from within. Li Xuanfeng explained, "The Golden Age Longbow is made from Golden Barrier Stone, which can contain my Astral Qi. I usually refine an arrow's intent within it, enhancing it with Astral Qi. Each refinement makes it more potent. I do not use it simply, reserving it only for critical moments. When I unleash this diligently refined arrow's intent, it is bound to deal a significant blow to the enemy."

"Oh?" Li Tongya raised an eyebrow. Although he failed to grasp the intricacies of what was described, it sounded quite sophisticated. He nodded slightly, and Li Xuanfeng, with the bow slung over his back, watched as Shamoli flew with the wind below.

After observing for a while, he transmitted his thoughts through his mana and let out a sigh as he said, "Even unrefined qi can possess such power... The Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique truly should not be underestimated. If it were not for the side effects that inhibit reproduction and reduce lifespan, it would indeed be quite valuable."

"That is true," Li Tongya agreed as he looked at the troops moving like ants below and continued softly, "With such a large formation from our family, the clans on the lake are not blind... More than likely, a good thirty to fifty percent of cultivators have come to investigate the situation by now, hiding within the surrounding mists. Let Shamoli handle what he can; we should not intervene to avoid revealing our strengths and weaknesses."

"I understand," Li Xuanfeng nodded. Both men then concealed their presence, following closely behind the army formation. Chen Donghe and Li Xuanxuan stayed within the army, guarding and protecting the younger family members to prevent any mishaps with the talented cultivators of their household.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The army marched on for an hour, conquering several towns. Qimu had redirected his troops and cultivators to attack villages in the west, so these towns had some slight defense‚Äîmostly by Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators.

Shamoli revealed his identity as the royal heir and easily captured them, as the people of Mount Yue had no strong loyalty to their ruler and mostly surrendered without resistance.

After advancing for half a day, they finally saw flags fluttering in the distance. It was the current ruler of Eastern Mount Yue, Qimu, rushing over with his troops. Five or six Mount Yue cultivators stood in the air, dressed in animal leathers and adorned with jade. Their eyes were wide with anger.

Below, the armies faced off, and the air was thick with tension. Qimu's face bore a strong resemblance to Mu Jiaoman, but he looked even more sinister, with thinner eyebrows and more elaborate clothing.

His eyes gazed intently at Shamoli, his expression a mix of shock and anger as his hands trembled uncontrollably. He stuttered over his words as he spoke, overcome by anger.

"You... you... have some nerve! Where did these troops come from, trespassing on our land?!"

Qimu had rushed over, unaware that Shamoli's forces were actually the eastern army, thinking that they were just from another faction he had rallied. Seeing Shamoli's formidable aura of the unmistakable Qi Cultivation Realm, he was both shocked and frightened. He immediately sensed that something was amiss, and grew suspicious.

Hearing this, Shamoli cackled loudly. He then soared into the sky alone, coldly confronting the face across him that closely resembled his own. The pale purple lightning in his hand crackled continuously as he chuckled lowly.

"Brother... Shamoli has returned!"




# Chapter 194: Fratricidal Strife

Qimu did not respond, but instead lowered his gaze to scan the battle formation below. The cold glint of the armor struck fear into his heart, and he realized the Easterners' intent. Feeling a sense of emptiness, he looked around, unsure of how many were hidden in the mist.

"The ancestor of the Li Family is said to have reached the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and is skilled in swordsmanship, nourished by pure spiritual qi of heaven and earth... If I were to flee now, I probably wouldn't get far..."

"My king! Allow me to deal with this Shamoli."

A few Qi Cultivators around him who were unaware of the dangers, eagerly volunteered, stepping forward with cupped fists. Only Zhong Yudai, an old minister left by his father Mu Jiaoman, remained silent, his hands trembling as he stared down at the troops below. Filled with fear, he lifted his head to look at Qimu but could not utter a single word.

"You... and you, go and test him together."

Qimu gave him a deep and meaningful look before calmly selecting two people, watching as two eager clan members stepped forward. He then called the old minister, Zhong Yudai, closer to him and transmitted his voice through mana.

"Shaman, Shamoli has colluded with the Easterners... and this time, they most likely want me dead. Take a troop westward and escort my son and two daughters out of the city. Find a place for them to live their lives and leave a legacy for me. Also, don't let them strive for more..."

Zhong Yudai's eyes reddened as he let out a shaky sigh, and descended. The two individuals beside Qimu exchanged glances, sensing that something was amiss. They wanted to ask out loud, but Qimu was staring at the skies with a grim expression, leaving them no room to speak.

Shamoli, seeing the two approaching, one a second heavenly layer and the other a third heavenly layer Qi Cultivator‚Äîboth superior to him in cultivation‚Äî felt no fear, instead he was feeling triumphant. He raised his twin hammers and swung fiercely at one of them.

The Mount Yue Qi Cultivator, clad in animal bones and jade that rattled with a clinking sound, laughed heartily. However, he wore a fierce expression. Holding a bone spear imbued with mixed true essence, he thrust it toward Shamoli's hammers.

Shamoli's body surged with purple true essence with lightning flashing, which spread from his hands to his hammers. When the hammers collided with the bone spear, their true essences violently clashed, exploding into fine sparks of electricity.

The Mount Yue Qi Cultivator's smile immediately faded as he was struck by the heavy hammer. He retreated in shock, half of his body numbed by the impact. Fortunately, the stronger Qi Cultivator beside him stepped forward with a staff, blocking Shamoli's offense.

This gave him a moment to catch his breath, clashing with Shamoli a few times back and forth. Observing Samoli's formidable true essence, he quickly shouted, "My king, this man's techniques are strange... the two of us might not be able to hold him off!"

Seeing the true essence around Shamoli, Qimu grew even more certain of his speculation, silently gesturing with his hand. The remaining two people took to the wind, pressing together towards the enemy. Qimu remained still, caught in his own thoughts.

Shamoli must have received proper technique from the Easterners, serving as their lackey... Now, all I can do is delay and drag on this fight as long as possible to buy some time for my children.

The four Mount Yue Qi Cultivators pressed together, greatly increasing the pressure on Shamoli. Although his hammers swung fiercely, repelling and causing any bone spear or knife that touched them to explode, the four Qi Cultivators took turns engaging him in battle. This gave them time to dissipate the force of the lightning, and they seemed to be able to manage it without much difficulty.

Shamoli fought impressively, but internally he struggled, as his mana reserve was low. Although powerful, it could not last long; quick resolution was crucial. Seeing himself restrained by four opponents and the Li Family not intervening, he reluctantly shouted out loud for their assistance.

"F-F-Family... Head... save me!"

As soon as these words were spoken, a figure from the eastern army formation soared into the air. Sword in hand, it was gleaming and robust with true essence. He intervened among the four, swiftly knocking away two bone-made dharma artifacts. Casting a cautious glance at Qimu who remained uninvolved in the distance, he did not announce his name but silently engaged the enemies in battle with his sword.

This man was Chen Donghe.

Chen Donghe single-handedly faced the encirclement of four with great ease. He then said in a deep voice, "Brother Shamoli, go directly to confront Qimu... leave this to me."

Chen Donghe, now at the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, practiced his family's authentic River One Qi Technique, which, as profound as rivers, was particularly effective against multiple opponents. Although unable to kill, he was able to at least hold his position under pressure without any issue.

Having married into the Li Family, he had received the Profound Water Sword Technique legacy. Although he had not yet developed sword qi, his combat prowess against these unrefined qi cultivators was overwhelmingly superior, making the four opponents struggle continuously. While the pressure was not as intense as what Shamoli had faced earlier, Chen Donghe's relentless and unyielding approach made it clear that he was far from being as drained as Shamoli appeared.

"Chen Donghe is indeed excellent, with considerable talent and diligence in training. He's especially strong in his foundational skills too!" Li Tongya praised from above.

Although Chen Donghe's swordsmanship was not as outstanding as compared to Yu Mujian's, it was still sufficient for combat, capable of holding his own against any adversary, ensuring no premature defeat.

"It's a pity that Jingtian has yet to have children... Chen Donghe spends too much time in seclusion. Fortunately, Yuanyun is with her, otherwise, she would be quite lonely..." Li Xuanfeng mumbled as he thought about his sister.

Li Tongya shook his head and whispered, "As a Qi Cultivator, it's rare for Chen Donghe to have children, and Jingtian being mortal makes it even more challenging."

As the two conversed, Shamoli had already broken free from the group, wielding his hammers and flying toward Qimu.

Qimu, watching Chen Donghe hold off the crowd alone, sighed in despair. He flew into the air with his sword and came face to face with the triumphant Shamoli who was fast approaching.

"Shamoli... do you know what you are doing?"

"What am I doing?" Samoli sneered fiercely as he repeated his brother's words, his hammers glowing with purple lightning as they struck down on Qimu's approaching sword, sparking a burst of scattered purple light.

"Who are you to judge? You don't even realize that this path that I have taken is the true salvation for Mount Yue!" he shouted.

"Y-Y-You, you... Such a waste of Father's instructions!" Qimu spat through gritted teeth. He was seething in rage.

Shamoli clashed with him in several exchanges, each move forceful and heavy, causing Qimu to retreat. His body went numb, and his true essence flowed unevenly, leaving him no match for Shamoli.

Upon hearing Qimu's words, Shamoli's sneer grew fiercer as he responded, "You dare mention him? What right did Mu Jiaoman have?! You were made the ruler, while I was left to face execution... You, as the eldest, had everything your way. Have you ever felt what I have endured?"

Qimu managed to hold his ground for the time it took an incense stick to burn, but it did not take long before he was drained of his true essence, his limbs growing powerless. At Shamoli's words, he paused, before bursting out into laughter.

"Now I understand, Shamoli! So, you care that much about Mu Jiaoman... Listen well..."

"No matter how glorious your future will be, no matter how well you govern Mount Yue, you'll always just be a dog to the Easterners!" Qimu growled as he stepped back several paces.

Without warning, he then twisted his sword to position it at his own neck. The sharp blade slid across his throat, drawing a line of blood. With a fierce look and a cold laugh, he held eye contact with his brother once more.

"In the underworld, my father and I will scorn you for your despicableness, mock your incompetence, ridicule you for being a lackey, deride you for deceiving yourself and others... and last of all, for not acting like how a son should!"

Shamoli trembled all over, feeling both shocked and furious.

"SILENCE!" he yelled.

Qimu, however, sneered coldly and closed his eyes. With a swift motion of the blade, his head quickly separated from his body. His head swung loosely as he fell, like a chicken being slaughtered.

Shamoli, looking as though he had been slapped, caught the head like a defeated dog. He merely glanced at it before the sight scorched his eyes, compelling him to look away. He lifted Qimu's head despondently and made a loud declaration with feigned pride.

"Qimu is dead... Those who surrender will not be killed."

The four Mount Yue Qi Cultivators looked at each other, before briefly hesitating and stopping their actions. Below them, the military formation descended into chaos, cries and screams mingling with the damp morning breeze.

Shamoli did not realize that his cheeks were slightly wet as he gazed at the majestic mountains and rivers shrouded in the pale white morning mist, muttering to himself, "His words... Should I have just resigned myself to death..? Should I have fled and lived a life in exile? Why... Why should I..."

Chen Donghe, riding the wind, approached and was slightly startled to see Shamoli holding Qimu's head in a daze, sprayed with blood yet seemingly oblivious to what was happening around him. He just stood there with tears streaming down his face.

Chen Donghe sighed softly and congratulated him.

"Congratulations... Great King!"




# Chapter 195: Li Feiruo

The old minister Zhong Yudai, leading over a hundred people, passed through various towns. Many approached to inquire but he ignored them all, speeding along the dirt road, filled with worry.

After ensuring that everything was in order with the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators among his group, he left the army behind and soared through the air toward Mulu Town, the capital set by Mu Jiaoman.

It was still early morning when he had left. After flying for an hour, Mulu Town finally appeared on the horizon. The sun rose, gradually warming the earth and wetting him with dew.

"Mulu Town..."

Zhong Yudai shook the dew from his body and flew directly over the city below, ignoring the Mount Yue clans who looked up from beneath. After a while, the grand palace appeared before him.

He was about to land in the palace, but the palace's protective formation had been activated unexpectedly.

A transparent barrier enclosed the entire palace tightly. It was a secret construction commissioned by Mu Jiaoman to a rogue cultivator from the lake, costing a significant sum of money.

"Please open the formation! I am the minister, Zhong Yudai, sent by the king on urgent business!"

Zhong Yudai had to stop and call out twice. However, a person appeared on the palace wall‚Äîa woman who had the appearance of an Easterner. She looked to be a middle-aged woman with fine eyebrows and was dressed in rich, majestic attire, gazing down at him indifferently.

"The queen consort?!"

The woman was indeed a clan daughter from the Li Family, Mu Jiaoman's consort. Zhong Yudai was shocked after having served under Mu Jiaoman for many years, and he blurted this out without thinking.

"Zhong Yudai, you've returned alone... Qimu's reign of power is gone, huh?"

The clan daughter smiled faintly, her voice carrying softly outside through the formation.

Zhong Yudai trembled as he listened to her words, both shocked and angry. He then exclaimed desperately, "Li Feiruo... how could it be you?! Where is the high shaman?!"

"Here."

Li Feiruo smiled softly as she bent down, picked something up, and threw it out.

It was a bloody, decapitated head. It rolled twice on the palace wall before falling outside, where the formation disintegrated it into a puff of ash.

"Just open the formation!" Zhong Yudai called out in a pleading tone, unable to comprehend how a Qi Cultivator could be killed so easily by a mortal with no cultivation.

Despair filled his heart but Li Feiruo merely waved her hand. Behind her, people brought forward three children into his line of sight‚Äîtwo girls and a boy, the oldest no more than ten, and the youngest only six.

All of them were in tears as they looked at Zhong Yudai, their gazes wrenching his heart.

"Minister Zhong Yudai... are you looking for them?" Li Feiruo asked softly as she stared into his eyes, carefully gauging his emotions. She was like a predator watching her prey.

Zhong Yudai, as if anticipating what was to come, had tears streaming down his face as he cried out, "H-How could you...? You are their stepmother...!"

Li Feiruo pretended not to hear his comment, still smiling as she said, "Minister Zhong Yudai... if you agree to one condition, I might just spare their lives."

"Name your conditions!" Zhong Yudai exclaimed immediately without hesitation, moving closer to the formation, staring intently into Li Feiruo's eyes.

"Take your own life."

Her voice was calm.

Zhong Yudai was shocked, his excess qi bursting forth as he cried out in grief, "You wicked woman...!"

Li Feiruo had already drawn a sharp dagger, pressing it against the neck of the little girl, who immediately began to cry loudly.

Zhong Yudai grew hasty and moved forward, gesturing for her to stop.

"Wait a moment!"

Zhong Yudai paused for a few moments, his expression tormented. Finally, he lifted his sword and placed the blade against his neck, his voice defeated.

"The former king and I have underestimated you."

Li Feiruo simply nodded without a word. Zhong Yudai made a swift motion with the blade, and just like that, his head flew off, gray hair flailing in the wind.

The formidable fifth heavenly layer Qi Cultivator had taken his own life, and his headless body fell to the ground with a thud. Only then did a gaze from above the clouds slowly withdraw, glancing at Li Feiruo and murmuring in admiration.

As Li Feiruo watched Zhong Yudai fall, her eyes dimmed slightly, the air of control around her fading. One of her confidants, unable to bear it any longer, whispered, "My lady, isn't this a little too..."

"It was a choice of necessity, as was mine..." Li Feiruo sighed, the jade ornaments around her neck clinking as she continued softly, "Zhong Yudai was one of the few who remained utterly loyal to Qimu. With the family elders not here, if he were to escape and then covertly target me or our younger family members, wouldn't that be a great trouble? Even though our family elders are far stronger than him, they can't always be guarding the younger ones. If he succeeded in his actions, I would be beyond redemption."

Li Feiruo continued to justify her actions.

"I am merely a mortal... who, though I enlisted the power of the clans within the city to kill the high shaman, possess only the capability to protect myself with formations. How could I possibly contend with a fifth heavenly layer Qi Cultivator? This method may be dirty, but it is the only path available to me right now... The fight to the death between two families, I fear, may not rid us of future troubles completely."

Li Feiruo, supported by several of her confidants, descended from the palace walls. She quietly observed the Mount Yue ministers kneeling below with blood flowing from beneath the palace, staining the hem of her luxurious dress a faint red. Li Feiruo smiled softly and spoke in a gentle voice.

"Rise, all of you."

The ministers below obediently stood up, not daring to look up at her. Li Feiruo walked through the blood-stained steps and hall of the palace, step by step into the pitch-dark main hall.

The fallen candles burned quietly on the floor, while the injured continued to moan within the hall. She walked through the blood to the front and whispered, "Has the young master replied?"

"Yes, he has."

A confidant handed her a sealed letter. Li Feiruo read it carefully before placing the letter inside her chest pocket. Only then did the ministers dare to speak.

"My lady, how shall we deal with Qimu's heirs?"

"Death is but a simple matter... but let's imprison them first and wait for the head of the family to decide."

Li Feiruo sighed once more, then picked up a brush and ink from the table and wrote a few lines on a piece of fabric. She handed it to her confidant and said softly, "Send this to the young family head."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The four Mount Yue Qi Cultivators submitted to Shamoli, directly addressing him as "Great King," and landed on the ground together to meet the main family.

They cautiously made their way through the military formation and soon saw a dark metal chariot, decorated with several flags that fluttered proudly in the wind.

A young man stood on the chariot, clad in a white robe, looking dashing and approachable. He smiled warmly at them, raising his cup in the morning breeze cheerfully.

"Congratulations, Great King!"

"This credit is not mine to take," Shamoli said, still covered in blood.

He kneeled on the ground and bowed respectfully to the young man. The four Mount Yue Qi Cultivators who were unclear on the protocol, awkwardly attempted to mimic his bow.

Shamoli then stood up and cupped his fist, saying, "My position today is all thanks to you and the other esteemed lords; I dare not call myself king before you. However, I have already unified Qimu's troops. According to the generals who surrendered, Qimu had previously released a loyal confidant, a fifth heavenly layer Qi Cultivator who poses a significant threat... I hope you will take heed. I also suspect that Qimu still has offspring and confidants in Mulu Town. I wish to lead a group there to ascertain this and prevent them from escaping and causing further trouble."

Li Yuanxiu nodded and replied, "Our elders are already tracking down the Mount Yue Qi Cultivator, so he won't be able to escape. As for Mulu Town..."

Li Yuanxiu smiled softly, glanced down at the five Mount Yue tribesmen below, and raised the secret letter in his hand.

"Two hours after Qimu left Mulu Town, the entire palace had already fallen under the control of my clan aunt. Qimu's children have fallen into our hands, and his close associates have been slaughtered by her. If I am not mistaken, someone is already on their way to surrender."




# Chapter 196: Discourse in the Hall

"Has the Li Family gone mad?! How are they brazenly leading troops across the border when the Azure Pond Sect and Mount Yue have marked boundaries..? Even though the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of Mount Yue has been in seclusion for many years, aren't there a bunch of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators on Mount Wu? How can they just watch this happen?!"

Yu Mugao massaged his temples, visibly filled with confusion and frustration. He was looking at two subordinates of his that were at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and he asked sternly, "Did you see it clearly?"

"Master, the Li Family has the heir of the previous king of Eastern Mount Yue on their side, claiming that he was there to reclaim the throne... perhaps because of this... Mount Wu did not realize and intervene," explained one of the cultivators who had stepped forward.

Yu Mugao glanced at him and raised his eyebrow skeptically.

"I can see through the Li Family's tactics as well. You don't understand... This is most likely done to offend Mount Wu. It's a risky move, not something Li Tongya would characteristically do! The few from Mount Wu are not known for their tolerance. Although they are not good at direct combat, their shamanic spell is notoriously tricky. In the past, Li Xiangping did not know that Mount Yue had Mount Wu's protection, and had ventured deep into their territory with his men... only to be cursed to death by the people of Mount Wu. Given how it can be considered a rather recent lesson, and also considering Li Tongya's cautious nature, how could he do such a thing..?"

Yu Mugao's words left everyone below him speechless, their heads bowed in deep thought. He stroked his chin thoughtfully. In recent years, Yu Family's Milin Prefecture had faced many troubles. Yu Mugao knew someone was scheming behind the scenes to divert the Yu Family's focus, yet he still had to maintain the situation. He was vexed by the Li Family stirring up more trouble.

"Could it be a problem with Mount Wu..."

Yu Mugao, after eliminating many possibilities in his mind, finally arrived at an unlikely conclusion. He said gravely, "Bring me a paper and a brush, I will write to ask Muxian."

His attendant hurriedly brought the writing materials to him, and Yu Mugao finished writing a brief letter rather quickly. However, his eldest son cautiously stepped forward, whispering in his ear.

"Family Head... Eastern Mount Yue has been under duress to support the Li Family, using the populace to sustain their towns. The Li Family's actions simply replace a loyal ruler of Mount Yue with no significant gain..."

Yu Mugao was stunned, feeling a tightness in his chest before it was filled with rage. He then scolded, "Fool! Before, they were tributaries to the Li Family, but now... Eastern Mount Yue will become a vassal to the Li Family, with all spirit fields and spirit items under their control! The difference is not slight, how can such words come from your mouth?!"

The young man paled and withdrew. Yu Mugao slammed the table angrily and shouted, "You will learn nothing by being here... get out, and send your younger brother in tomorrow!"

Watching his eldest son retreat dejectedly, Yu Mugao's frustration simmered. He narrowed his eyes as he muttered coldly, "We can't let the Li Family run wild either... We simply can't allow Li Tongya to grow too powerful! We must think of a way to suppress them."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Mulu Town, as the capital of Eastern Mount Yue, boasted a population of twenty thousand, comparable to one of the four towns under the Li Family. When Mu Jiaoman was reigning, he had been diligent. He constructed four roads leading to the four borders, greatly facilitating the movement of the Li Family's troops. It only took them one night to reach Mulu Town.

The town gates were wide open, and a group of Mount Yue's clansmen kneeled before them‚Äîincluding two Qi Cultivators, who were also bowed. The dark chariot ignored them and drove straight into the town, heading straight for the palace.

The chariot, carrying a host of soldiers, stopped in front of the blood-stained palace where more Mount Yue ministers were kneeling. Li Yuanxiu got off the chariot with Chen Donghe following behind him silently. His gaze swept over the crowd, finally resting on the woman at the front.

Li Yuanxiu took two steps forward and helped Li Feiruo to her feet with a smile on his face.

"Auntie has preserved the palace's formations for our family, and they were even strong enough to withstand ordinary Qi Cultivators... You're a great hero in this battle!"

Li Feiruo smiled faintly before she stood up gracefully to face him. She then said softly, "The clans heard that our family elder was coming and were so terrified that they wanted to surrender. I haven't done much... I just facilitated the connections!"

After modestly downplaying her role and efforts, Li Feiruo clapped her hands. Like clockwork, several Mount Yue tribesmen brought forward two bodies, dropping them with a thud in front of the steps.

Li Feiruo spoke again, but this time her voice carried some coldness.

"These two were Qimu's shaman and his loyal dog Zhong Yudai, both of whom have been executed."

Li Yuanxiu nodded in response, and two people behind him stepped forward to confirm their identities. Li Feiruo then had someone bring out Qimu's three children, and declared loudly, "Qimu had his brothers slaughtered... Now, only Shamoli and these three heirs of Mu Jiaoman remain. I thought the main family might find a use for them, so I detained them for the time being. The decision is yours to make, Young Family Head."

"What use could they be? Just kill them." Li Yuanxiu smiled faintly before walking past the crowd with Li Feiruo. Both entered the inner hall together, ignoring the children's desperate cries and pleas for mercy behind them.

In the spotlessly clean inner hall, the clan soldiers quickly took their positions on both sides, giving the empty hall a somber appearance.

"What is this?" Li Yuanxiu asked as he looked up at the throne. There, a brown spherical object was hanging, swaying, and overlooking everyone below.

"The Eye of Jianixi."

Li Feiruo answered flatly, causing Li Yuanxiu to pause briefly before she continued, "Mu Jiaoman obtained the remains of Jianixi and preserved his Foundation Establishment Realm eyeball, preventing it from decaying. They hang above the throne, overseeing everyone..."

"The customs of Mount Yue are indeed eerie..." Li Yuanxiu muttered as he glanced at the brown eyeball, feeling an inexplicable familiarity with it. Deciding not to dwell on it, he then gave a soft command.

"Take it down to be used in a ritual for Granduncle Xiangping."

"Yes!"

As soon as that command was given, two clan soldiers immediately stepped forward to remove the eyeball. Li Yuanxiu took another look at it before turning to Li Feiruo.

"Auntie never had children of her own..?"

"I once did have my own... but they were harmed by Mu Jiaoman."

As she said this, Li Feiruo touched her stomach gently, her expression slightly weary. Li Yuanxiu was clearly taken aback by this revelation and felt a sense of guilt.

"You've endured a lot over the years, Auntie... is there anything you wish for?" he asked softly, his tone apologetic.

Li Feiruo's lips curved into a smile, and she slowly kneeled down.

"There is indeed one thing... I am only in my thirties, and I wish to choose a cultivator from our family to marry into mine; to have a son or a daughter. This would comfort me in my remaining years."

Li Feiruo's answer was unexpected yet reasonable to Li Yuanxiu, who nodded in agreement. Just then, the palace doors swung open. This was startling to all those present, as there were no strong winds at all.

The clan soldiers on either side bowed as a middle-aged man with a sword on his back stepped into the hall, revealing himself. He had another sword at his waist, and he exuded an extremely commanding aura.

"Greetings, Granduncle!"

Li Yuanxiu's demeanor immediately became solemn and submissive, bowing down.

Li Feiruo followed suit though she did not recognize the man, as she could tell from everyone's reactions that he ought to be of importance.

"Feiruo greets the elder!"

"No need for such formalities."

Li Tongya nodded approvingly as he glanced at Li Feiruo, saying warmly, "Well done, you have saved our family much trouble... Which branch are you from?"

"My father is Li Yesheng, who served Lord Xiangping. Li Xiewen is my elder brother," Li Feiruo answered respectfully.

Li Tongya clapped his hands, letting out a hearty laugh.

"So you are Yesheng's daughter? Then there's no mistake about it! You have your father's spirit! Back then, I had Xuan'er send a clan daughter over, never imagining it was you."

Li Feiruo smiled and thanked him. Li Tongya then made a quick gesture, and the eyeball, previously held by a servant, flew up and landed before him.

The brown eyeball, once filled with fierceness and slyness, now only held a vacant stillness. Li Tongya inspected it closely and sighed.

"Jianixi... a man that once drove our family into disarray. I have to admit, he was truly a remarkable person! Fortunately, he died at the hands of Mount Yue's Purple Mansion Realm cultivator..."

Li Yuanxiu, young and not very familiar with that history, listened intently. Li Feiruo, having spent many years in Mount Yue, was more knowledgeable and hence explained it to him softly.

"I heard that Jianixi was a half-brother of Mu Jiaoman‚Äîborn of a slave, who acquired an ancient secret technique to cultivate his qi. He reached the Foundation Establishment Realm by the mere age of forty. He was truly a genius."

Li Tongya frowned when he heard this.

What ancient secret technique..? Even if one acquires such a method, it's impossible to cultivate without proper qi. That was most likely an opportunity arranged by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of Mount Yue...

He then raised an eyebrow and asked, "Do you know what kind of immortal foundation Jianixi established?"

"Mu Jiaoman, when drunk and weeping for Jianixi, once mentioned that his foundation was profoundly powerful and mysterious."

After saying this, Li Feiruo thought for a moment and paused. When she spoke again, her voice was low and serious.

"It is called Emperor's Mandate."




# Chapter 197: The Conspirators

"Emperor's Mandate..."

The ancient and imposing name took both Li Yuanxiu and Li Tongya by surprise.

While Li Yuanxiu was less affected, Li Tongya, who had encountered numerous immortal foundations throughout his life, was stunned to hear of one named after an emperor for the first time. He pondered deeply to himself.

The immortal foundation formed from the River One Qi Technique is called Boundless Ocean, and the one from Cave Spring Clear Spirit Technique is Spring's Echo... The immortal foundation is always closely related to the method of cultivation; Jianixi's technique must also have been equally powerful!

Li Yuanxiu, who was standing beside him, displayed a look of yearning as he listened to the name of the immortal foundation. His ears pricked up instantly, and he felt an uncontrollable desire rising within him.

To cultivate an immortal foundation and to traverse the mysterious realm... the allure of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm is so tempting! I wonder if in this lifetime I might glimpse the realm beyond Qi Cultivation...

The Li Family's main lineage had already produced three Qi Cultivators, and Li Xuanling was just a step away. The expectations for Li Yuanxiu and his younger relatives were primarily set beyond the Qi Cultivation Realm, hence instigating such thoughts in Li Yuanxiu.

Li Tongya inquired further about the details from Li Feiruo, who patiently answered each of his questions.
ùó≥ùöõùó≤ùïñùö†ùöéùöãùóªùóºùïßùó≤ùê•.ùöåùöòùê¶

Mu Jiaoman had been cautious of Li Feiruo during his lifetime and hadn't said much, so no further useful information was obtained.

"I see," Li Tongya said before smiling warmly to Li Yuanxiu, thus ending the prior topic of conversation.

"We have mobilized a great number of people for this, and many eyes are upon us... We risk becoming targets, so it's not advisable to stay away from home for long. I'll remain here for a month while several elders will stay in the city to watch over things. Go sort out the affairs of the Mount Yue territory with your father. Once that's done, we'll return home together."

"As for Feiruo..." Li Tongya's voice trailed off as he glanced at her, and Li Feiruo quickly expressed her wishes.

Li Tongya nodded in understanding and commended her once more.

"You've worked hard these years. Help Xiu'er handle the affairs and then return to Lijing Town to live a peaceful life."

"Yes!" Li Yuanxiu and Li Feiruo both responded respectfully. Li Tongya then nodded, his figure fading as he rode the wind away... of course, taking the brown eyeball with him.

Left behind, Li Yuanxiu and Li Feiruo exchanged a glance with each other in the courtyard.

Li Feiruo made a welcoming gesture, and Li Yuanxiu took his seat at the head of the table.

"Please enlighten me, Auntie," he said warmly.

"My pleasure..." Li Feiruo smiled as she nodded gently, speaking softly.

"Currently, Eastern Mount Yue has a population of 226,000, with 11 towns and 63 villages. There are 62 Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators and 8 Qi Cultivators‚Äîall harnessing unrefined qi. They're not very useful in major capacities, but adequate for cultivating spirit fields. The Eastern Mount Yue consists of six major noble clans, with the Mulu Clan as their leader. Most of the cultivators come from these clans, which hold ninety percent of the treasures and spirit items. Mount Yue is not skilled in agriculture, however... most of the spirit fields lie fallow."

Li Yuanxiu nodded and said in a low voice, "The land of Mount Yue is much more fertile than that of our Li Family. It's approximately the same size in area but with a much larger population. People in Mount Yue live by hunting in the mountains and gathering crops, and although they practice agriculture, they are not adept at it. Once we educate them, they could support an additional hundred thousand people."

"The matter of the spirit fields has already been attended to by my father, who has sent people to investigate. We should have a clear understanding of it in a few days," Li Yuanxiu paused after saying this, noticing that Li Feiruo had something to say. He stopped to look expectantly at her.

"That's right, Young Family Head, but what about these spirit items currently in the hands of the clans? How do you plan to handle them?" Li Feiruo asked quietly.

She had managed to execute the high shaman with the help of these clans, and now that she was about to leave the court and return to Lijing Town, she did not hesitate to propose such an idea.

"These people are cunning; if we don't kill a few, they won't obey..." she added as she glanced downward.

"Indeed."

Li Yuanxiu pressed his hands on the table and continued, "I'll ask Clan Uncle Qiuyang and Uncle Donghe to take our clan soldiers and search house by house. With their spiritual sense, these people will have nowhere to hide. We'll find an excuse to detain their young and exchange them for spirit items."

Li Yuanxiu paused briefly, then sighed. When he opened his mouth to speak again, his voice was heavy with emotion.

"I didn't want to use such crude methods, but with only a month's time, we cannot afford to wear them down slowly. We must resort to violence... and deter them through fear of slaughter."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Shamoli flew over the eleven towns below, strategically placing his troops in each one. His spirits, previously dampened by Qimu's nonsensical words, had improved considerably.

After making a complete circuit with the four Mount Yue Qi Cultivators following him, they finally descended upon Mulu Town.

"Years have passed since I left in destitution, and now I return in fine clothing..."

Shamoli sighed, attempting to articulate his feelings with the limited literary flair he had picked up from the Easterners. Running out of eloquent expressions, he naturally stumbled over his words.

He suddenly turned his head, and with considerable disdain, looked at the attire of the few Mount Yue Qi Cultivators behind him and commanded, "You lot! Tie up your hair, and what are these ragged clothes you're wearing?!"

The group of Mount Yue Qi Cultivators was stunned and clearly dumbfounded.

"R...Ragged?" they sputtered, repeating his words in disbelief.

Shamoli sighed softly before grabbing the hand of the one in front. He patted his shoulder and explained, "You have spent your lives in this dirt hole... and never had the chance to witness the prosperity beyond our borders. Give it another two years, and you'll understand the difference between good and bad."

They had landed in the town center as they were in conversation, only to see clan soldiers bustling about, armed and rushing in formation through the streets.

Their cold armor clinked sharply; however, they were not heading toward the houses of the rich or common folk but specifically targeting large estates led by either Embryonic Breathing Realm or Qi Cultivators, marching up the stone steps.

Angry shouts then followed as the clan soldiers silently dragged out the obese bodies of the people along.

The Mount Yue clans were not as regulated as those ruled by the Li Family, and each of them was as fat as a pig due to the lack of productive work, and they were screaming as they were dragged out.

It took two soldiers to haul each one, and one even yelled, "Do you know who I am?! My uncle is a Qi Cultivator!"

A soldier promptly kicked him, causing him such pain that he rolled around, unable to speak.

The leader, a third stage Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator, stood expressionless as he pointed his long sword at the man.

Shamoli, witnessing this, felt his expression change and his unease grow. He stopped a troop of clan soldiers, demanding in a stern voice, "What are you all doing?!"

The leader, looking serious yet honest, still holding his long sword, replied cautiously, "Xu Gongming greets the Great King... We are acting on orders from Young Master Jiao to arrest those among the six major clans who are conspiring with Qimu's remnants. What about you, Great King..?"

"Ah."

Realizing they were searching for Qimu's remnants, Shamoli's expression shifted to one that was between shock and joy.

He then looked fiercely at those clan members and exclaimed, "Good! Brother Jiao is indeed thorough! Go ahead and do what you need to; I have your back!"

With that, he turned to stare coldly at the four Mount Yue Qi Cultivators that were behind him. They were indeed from the six major clans, all of whom bowed their heads guiltily, not daring to meet his eyes.

"Well then, I shall execute my order!" Xu Gongming responded, still expressionless. He gave a signal, and the clan soldiers immediately sprang into action.




# Chapter 198: Exploiting the Clans

"My lady... what is this? What's going on here?!" the old ministers asked.

Li Feiruo sat at the head of the table, smiling radiantly at the old ministers below. They were all white-haired and visibly anxious, repeatedly saying, "We all contributed to the fight against Qimu! Why, then, are our people being captured?! T-T-The notion that they are remnants of Qimu is a grave misunderstanding!"

Li Feiruo furrowed her brow and beckoned the anxious ministers closer, speaking softly, "Each of you has indeed contributed greatly... and I hold that in my heart. Early this morning, I heard that people from several clans had been taken away, and I immediately went to inquire with the head of the family."

The old ministers looked at each other and then cupped their fists, but their eyes still were heavy with doubt.

"Thank you, my lady! But... about these remnants of Qimu..."

Li Feiruo waved her hand with a helpless expression.

"This matter is under Young Master Jiao's control... He's tyrannical and lawless, and even the Young Family Head fears him somewhat. Naturally, I am powerless... To make things worse, Young Master Jiao's mother is from the Mulu Clan, and Mu Jiaoman is his granduncle. Qimu has murdered his own brothers and father... Young Master Jiao naturally hates him to the bone. If your offspring fall into the hands of such a brutal and greedy person, they will undoubtedly suffer!"

Upon hearing this, the clan elders who had come seeking an explanation were all startled. The younger ones were anxious and unsure of what to do, while a few older ones exchanged glances, relieved.

This is just extortion. It's our wealth they're after, not our lives...

Li Feiruo, now grinning, watched as an elderly man with white hair stood up. Highly respected among the clans and seasoned from a lifetime in the bureaucracy, he naturally knew what Li Feiruo wanted.

He coughed, then slowly cupped his fist and said, "My lady, having sent an army of justice to support the Great King... My Wutu Clan once served the false king but has now seen the light. Now, in fear, we wish to offer the spirit fields under our control and over thirty spirit items. We seek nothing else but to serve the upper sect. We hope my lady can speak kindly of us in front of Young Master Jiao."

This old man was decisive and smart. Knowing there was no way he could keep the spirit fields, he readily offered all of them along with more than thirty spirit items.

Though these items‚Äîmostly Embryonic Breathing Realm shamanic tools and spirit items‚Äîcould not compare to the dharma artifacts and pills of immortal cultivators, they could certainly serve the Li Family's lower-level cultivators well.

"The old clan chief is indeed magnanimous." Li Feiruo nodded in approval.

These shamanic tools and spirit items were many years of savings by the clan, and even for a clan that had dominated this land for years, offering over thirty items was a significant sacrifice.

She glanced at the other clan leaders who, after exchanging looks with each other, made similar offers.

"We're willing to offer twenty-five plots of spirit fields... and fifteen spirit items..."

"Our clan is willing to offer fifteen plots of spirit fields and twenty spirit items..."

After listening to them all, Li Feiruo finally smiled in satisfaction.

"Everyone, please calm down... I understand all your positions. For now, go back and wait for my news. I will speak with Young Master Jiao and get back to you all later."

Seeing that Li Feiruo had already spoken to dismiss them, they could only reluctantly leave the room.

Once Li Feiruo saw that the room was empty, she called someone over and instructed, "Follow them and take care of the spirit fields and items. Make sure to account for everything each family has ceded. Record them in a register, and send it to Young Master Jiao. He will decide whom to kill based on this... Those who give less will face more executions among their ranks, while those who offer more will see their members spared to a greater extent. Within three days, these old fellows will naturally come looking for me again."

"Understood," the attendant beside her replied before she withdrew.

Li Feiruo, with a gleeful smile, picked up her brush. She fondly circled it over the fabric before her, musing to herself.

Having great power and pressuring others is truly intoxicating... I wonder if I can secure a decent position when I return to town.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

In the palace of Mulu Town, Mu Jiaoman had built many prisons during his construction of the palace to detain dissenters. As his rule became more stable, these prisons became emptier.

Now that Shamoli had risen to power, the prisons had suddenly filled up again, with rooms originally meant for one person now packed with three to five prisoners each. It was cramped and filthy, with urine and feces everywhere.

Li Yuanjiao raised the whip in his hand before stepping on the blood-stained face beneath his foot. His expression shifted as he whipped the man on the ground, causing him to scream in pain. His voice was dangerously low when he spoke.

"Say it again."

"Mu Jiaoman... is Jianixi's younger brother... They had the same father... different mothers, Jianixi's... mother was a slave... she fled into the woods to give birth to him..." the man answered weakly.

Li Yuanjiao fell silent for a moment, then whipped the man again, demanding, "How many spirit items and fields does your clan have? Don't hide anything, you're not the only person in the Wutu Clan."

"I-I'm just a mortal... I really don't know!" the man pleaded in pain, trembling.

Li Yuanjiao waved his hand dismissively before whipping him a few more times. He only paused when an attendant handed him a small letter, interrupting his assault.

He glanced at it and sneered, "You're a thoroughly wicked person. I guess physical pain isn't enough for you... please don't blame me for this."

As he spoke, his second stage Embryonic Breathing Realm aura burst forth. Not waiting for the man to plead further, he struck the man's head with his mana-enhanced whip, causing it to explode instantly. Blood and brain matter splattered everywhere, staining the ground.

"Report to the young master. The lady has sent over the register."

Li Yuanjiao turned and took the document, scanning it from top to bottom once more, making thorough mental notes. He then issued a command, and another prisoner was dragged out of a cell, crying and begging for mercy.

Just as Li Yuanjiao raised his whip again, a voice transmitted by mana reached him, stopping him in his tracks.

"Young Brother Jiao, hold on!"

Li Yuanjiao pursed his lips, then saw Shamoli stumbling into the room hurriedly. He awkwardly began, "Brother Jiao, I know you hold resentment in your heart... but the people of the six major clans and our Mulu Clan have deep relations. Could you perhaps... show them some mercy for my sake...?"

"Oh, it's you, Brother Shamoli..." Li Yuanjiao smiled as he tossed aside his whip and said with a cheerful smile, "You've just ascended the throne, and there are many affairs to handle within the state. Leave these minor matters to me; there is no need to trouble yourself to come here."

Shamoli chuckled. Since ascending the throne, he had indeed taken up the role with great fanfare, but every day, the matters that reached him were merely trivial issues of the state. None of the key issues ever came to his hands, leaving him so frustrated that he was lost for words.

His visit this time was because the six major clans had already sent sufficient gifts, and he also wanted to use this opportunity to gauge Li Yuanjiao's intentions, to see when the Li Family would leave.

Seeing Shamoli smiling awkwardly without speaking, Li Yuanjiao explained, "I'm trying to eliminate dissenters for you, to establish authority. Rest assured, leave this matter to me, I know the limits..."

Shamoli, already indebted to Li Yuanjiao, was even more at a loss for words, and could only sigh softly. "When will Brother Jiao return to Lijing Town? I'll also arrange the time to fulfill my duties as the host!"

Li Yuanjiao laughed heartily and said in a low voice, "If the six major clans cooperate and the remnants of Qimu can be dealt with within a month, we'll return east. If the six clans drag their feet and resist, it might take months or even half a year!"

Shamoli was pleased to hear this, knowing that once the Li Family finished exploiting the six major clans, they would leave. He quickly replied, "I understand! I understand!"

Li Yuanjiao patted his shoulder, speaking warmly, "I understand the difficulties you face, brother... I'm also acting under orders. We indeed trouble you by staying here, but as soon as the six major clans cooperate, I'll write to the elders to return east early, and we won't linger any longer on your territory!"

Eager to witness the departure of the Li Family and indifferent to the concerns of the six major clans, Shamoli felt a great weight lifted off his shoulders. He nodded gratefully and said, "Brother Yuanjiao is selfless indeed... I will do my best to cooperate, brother!"




# Chapter 199: Observing the Ceremony

Azure Pond Peak is the highest peak of Mount Azure Pond, known for its steep terrain. At the foot of the peak stood a stele inscribed with the characters Azure Chi, which often puzzled new disciples who wondered why it read Azure Chi instead of Azure Pond.

The older disciples, however, kept their mouths sealed and offered no explanations. Over time, no one asked about it anymore.

The cave dwelling at the summit of Azure Pond Peak was the place with the richest spiritual qi in the entire mountain range. Facing the east where the sun and moon rise, cultivating here could yield great results with minimal effort.

Chi Zhiyun, holding a sword, had been waiting respectfully in front of the stone door for a long time when it silently opened.

An elderly man with white hair and a benevolent face emerged, holding a jade alms bowl. His aura was undetectable, and he seemed like just an ordinary old man.

"Zhiyun greets the Ancestor! Congratulations on attaining mastery of your divine ability!" Chi Zhiyun called out respectfully.

The white-haired elder smiled gently and spoke in a low, aged voice.

"It's hardly any great achievement... I merely extended my life by consuming a treasured pill, and finally mastered my fifth divine ability‚Äîqualifying me to attempt a breakthrough to the Golden Core Realm."

Glancing at Chi Zhiyun, Chi Wei cleared his throat. Strangely, two voices emerged simultaneously‚Äîone sharp and fine, a woman's voice, and the other deep and aged, clearly belonging to an old man‚Äîsaying in unison, "Middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, not bad at all!"

This was rather eerie, and Chi Zhiyun felt a shiver down his spine, though he dared not show it. Instead, he humbly replied, "My modest cultivation doesn't deserve such praise, Ancestor."

Chi Wei took a step forward, his voice returning to normal as he said in a low voice, "I have emerged from seclusion because that old bastard Duanmu is about to break through to the Golden Core Realm, and he has invited me to watch the ceremony. Although your immortal foundation has not yet shown signs of harboring divine abilities, it would be beneficial for you to observe."

Chi Zhiyun's eyes lit up at the suggestion as he quickly thanked his ancestor. Chi Wei watched him for a moment before small clouds formed under their feet. They ascended into the sky, heading toward Mount Dali.

Standing behind Chi Wei, Chi Zhiyun hesitated for a moment before asking quietly, "Ancestor, if I may inquire about Li Chejing..."

"He has already been refined into a pill, which has been delivered to me... to aid me when I break through to the Golden Core Realm," Chi Wei responded indifferently, and Chi Zhiyun sighed in relief.

Chi Wei then continued, "The techniques of the three sects and seven gates mostly originate from the Moonlight Origin Mansion, including that Moon Lake Autumn Reflection Technique that comes from the Moonlight Secret Decree. The immortal foundation it builds, known as the Lake Moon Autumn, has the ability to oversee all techniques. This immortal foundation greatly benefits my breakthrough to the Golden Core Realm."

Chi Wei shared these secrets which mesmerized Chi Zhiyun and greatly excited him.

Seeing his reaction, Chi Wei continued, "Unfortunately, Li Chejing was born fifty years too late. By the time he reached the Qi Cultivation Realm, I had already acquired four divine abilities and one immortal foundation. Had he been born fifty years earlier, I could have taken his Lake Moon Autumn instead of settling for the far inferior Spiritual Sustenance, and my chances of breaking through the Golden Core Realm would have been much greater."

Chi Zhiyun also shook his head regretfully. With the refined techniques of the Purple Mansion Realm, they soon arrived at Mount Dali.

They effortlessly crossed over Lijing Town and Eastern Mount Yue, causing Lu Jiangxian on the mountain to shrink back into his mirror, lying motionless on the stone platform like a lifeless being.

Fortunately, Chi Wei flew high, paying no heed to the situation below, and crossed over Eastern Mount Yue directly. He stopped near the white jade steps at the edge of Mount Wu and stumbled upon someone else riding on clouds.

The man was dressed in a glittering golden robe, with white hair and a beard‚Äîyet his face retained a middle-aged appearance. His aura also marked him as a peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

Upon seeing Chi Wei, the man cupped his fist and greeted. "Brother Chi Wei, long time no see!"

"It's been seventy-three years... Brother Zhang remains the same as always!" Chi Wei responded heartily.

The middle-aged man smiled. Chi Zhiyun looked up and noticed another person behind him, seemingly of early Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation. This individual appeared unremarkable, carrying a long sword on his back and casting a provocative gaze toward Chi Zhiyun.

Chi Zhiyun snorted coldly, quite displeased as he thought to himself, Zhang... probably from the Golden Feather Sect. This person is merely at the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, yet behaves so arrogantly... Does he truly believe anyone can use me to gain fame, just like Li Chejing?

The two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators chatted for a bit more until the grand formation on Mount Wu suddenly opened, revealing a middle-aged man dressed in a black robe.

He paused, observing that representatives from the three sects and seven gates, various rogue cultivators, and even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from neighboring states had all gathered. With cold eyes and an air of arrogance, he spoke.

"I, Duanmu Kui, am breaking through to the Golden Core Realm today. According to the cultivation world's convention over the last three hundred years among the four states, I have extended invitations to you all. Kindly give me some space and refrain from interrupting the process carelessly."

The people gathered in the clouds paused, and someone spoke.

"We understand these rules... Senior Duanmu is the eldest among us in the Purple Mansion Realm, whom we respect the most. We all have come to witness the ceremony."

Duanmu Kui sneered and looked down at Mount Wu, while the disciples below watched him nervously. He was well aware that these disciples had long been in collusion with the three sects and seven gates, and that they were ready to disperse should he fail. Yet, Duanmu Kui remained indifferent.

Establishing Mount Wu was purely to find some errand runners, and these disciples held no place in his heart.

Chi Wei watched quietly, his expression filled with emotion. He then said to Chi Zhiyun beside him, "Duanmu Kui is the sole survivor from the era when the Moonlight Origin Mansion was prominent... When I was young, I heard legends about him. He received divine teachings from an immortal under a mulberry tree in ancient Li City, rising from a beggar to a Purple Mansion Realm immortal cultivator, leading a life full of dramatic turns."

Chi Zhiyun hesitated for a moment before asking, "What are his chances of breaking through the Golden Core Realm?"

Chi Wei paused for a while before answering in a low voice.

"Greater than any of ours."

Duanmu Kui levitated into the air, his gaze fixed on the slowly rising sun. The pure qi of heaven and earth rose in the atmosphere, while the murky qi sank. The essence of the sun and moon intertwined, creating an ideal atmosphere for a breakthrough.

Divine lights began to rise around Duanmu Kui, his expression complex and unreadable.

Duanmu Kui, despite not possessing exceptional talent, had nonetheless dominated his era with techniques bestowed by an immortal. Having lived for 647 years, he had exhausted the sixteen life-extending methods from the book titled Answers to a Beggar's Questions Under the Mulberry Tree, and eventually attained mastery of five divine abilities.

"He said... I could break through to the Golden Core Realm."
ùöèùï£ùïñùöéùö†ùöéùöãùöóùê®ùêØùïñùïù.ùïîùê®ùïû

When Duanmu Kui was twenty-two years old, he had collapsed under a mulberry tree, nearly starving to death. An immortal had given him a bowl of noodles.

Duanmu Kui, expressing deep gratitude and claiming he had nothing to repay him with, was met with a simple response by the immortal‚Äî"Eat slowly."

After wandering aimlessly for eleven years, Duanmu Kui wept bitterly upon hearing those words. The immortal had then stuffed the book titled Answers to a Beggar's Questions Under the Mulberry Tree into his chest and said softly, "Breakthrough to the Golden Core Realm. I'll come looking for you in five hundred years."

As the essence of the sun and moon reached its peak in the sky, Duanmu Kui's spiritual sense stirred. A faint light flew out from his Shenyang Mansion, activating Locust Shade Ghost, a life divine ability.

His vision cleared, revealing two vague figures in the clouds. Duanmu Kui cupped his fist respectfully and said solemnly, "Please wait a moment, esteemed seniors."

As he spoke, the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators present stepped back in awe. Duanmu Kui listened intently and heard a sharp, high-pitched voice come from the distance.

"If your breakthrough fails, you will turn into smoke and dust... but if you succeed, we shall call you an immortal."

Duanmu Kui smiled softly, and his other four divine abilities emerged from his body, stirring the spiritual qi of heaven and earth which swirled around him.

"Untraceable Presence, Earth Shaman's Blessing, Fool's Mountain Chase, Blood Drinker."

Duanmu Kui called each of his abilities out one by one, sighing softly with a hint of resentment on his face. If only he had not lacked the Emperor's Mandate, he would not be in such a dire situation.

His gaze swept over the Daoist halls of Yue State angrily before he refocused himself. The first ray of light from Locust Shade Ghost ascended into the sky, drawing invisible flames in its wake.




# Chapter 200: Locust Shade Ghost

Chi Zhiyun noticed Duanmu Kui cupping his fist respectfully toward the clouds. Yet Chi Zhiyun saw no one among the clouds, leaving him both surprised and slightly confused. He then turned to Chi Wei and asked, "Ancestor, what's going on..? Could it be that a Golden Core Realm cultivator from another state has arrived?"

"Not at all." Chi Wei shook his head and activated his divine ability, glancing at the two vague figures in the clouds. He swept his eyes across them briefly, not daring to let his gaze linger, and turned to explain to Chi Zhiyun.

"To break through to the Golden Core Realm, the key lies in refining that indestructible metallic essence, and then using it to catalyze a divine ability to achieve the Golden Core. Duanmu Kui is adept in shamanic spells, and even if he can't form a Golden Core, he can still refine this metallic essence. Those two are emissaries of death, ensuring that should Duanmu Kui fail and his soul escape, the metallic essence won't transform into a monstrous force."

Chi Zhiyun, having read the scriptures within his sect, naturally understood that the metallic essence of the Golden Core was not the metal of the five elements, but instead symbolized the indestructibility of metal.

He was greatly puzzled and exclaimed, "Are there really such benevolent people?"

"It's a necessity." Chi Wei sighed softly and said, "You, being young, do not know how many spirit veins of mountains were broken and how many powerful beings‚Äîfrom Golden Core Realm to beyond‚Äîdied in the ancient battles between immortals and devils... Those beings had all refined the metallic essence, turning into various fiends. Inflicting suffering upon the living is one thing, but these fiends retain traces of metallic essence... naturally, it stirs envy in others. So, the immortals established a supreme sect dedicated to capturing these creatures... Nowadays, it's one of the few upper sects that has never hidden away from the world, always shrouded in mystery."

While Chi Wei spoke, Duanmu Kui's five divine abilities in the sky had merged into a ray of colorful light, spewing invisible flames. Witnessing this, the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators stepped back in awe and were dumbstruck, while Duanmu Kui continued to refine his powers within these invisible flames.

"Duanmu Kui is taking the path of balancing water and fire, a method now rarely seen... Having received techniques granted by an immortal, he's more confident using these ancient methods," Chi Wei remarked while Zhiyun, not quite understanding his explanation, simply stared blankly at the radiant display of divine abilities.

On the other hand, Chi Wei nodded thoughtfully, focusing intently on the scene before him.

No one in the Wu and Yue States had achieved the Golden Core Realm for hundreds of years. The few known methods for breaking through the Golden Core Realm had led to the deaths of many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, leading to an agreement among them to invite juniors to witness their breakthroughs‚Äîa mutually beneficial arrangement in the hopes of finding the right method for advancement.

Everyone watched intently, but one of the vague figures in the clouds shook their head.

In a high-pitched voice, the figure said, "He has the Locust Shade Ghost life divine ability, so he should have cultivated the Emperor's Mandate instead of Fool's Mountain Chase..."
ùòßùò≥ùò¶‚ÑØùìåùò¶ùí∑ùòØùëúùë£ùò¶ùìÅ.ùí∏ùò∞ùìÇ

"Exactly, Duanmu Kui likely has no hope left... Let's prepare to intervene."

As the two conversed, nobody below them could hear their voices. The invisible fire in the air blazed even fiercer, using the divine abilities as kindling, faintly condensing a bright point of light.

All the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators widened their eyes in envy as they watched the spirit light. Duanmu Kui pushed his palm forward, and the essence of the sun and moon surged toward that light.

Slowly, a few ethereal dewdrops appeared above the glimmering spirit light, shimmering beautifully and dripping down. The light grew even brighter, but suddenly, the dewdrops ceased. After about the time it took for an incense stick to burn, the five divine abilities had been fully consumed, and no more dew fell.

"Ah..." Chi Zhiyun watched, puzzled, while Chi Wei had already lowered his head in disappointment. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators looked at each other, their hearts pounding as they gazed at Duanmu Kui.

Duanmu Kui paused for a moment, then inhaled sharply. Like a whale, he swallowed the entire spirit light into his belly. A complex expression flickered across his face before he burst out laughing. His voice was unexpectedly high-pitched, filled with triumph and satisfaction.

"I've succeeded!"

Chi Zhiyun looked up in shock to see Duanmu Kui's face streaked with fine lines, resembling a cracked porcelain doll. He shivered at the unnerving sight.

Meanwhile, Duanmu Kui continued laughing loudly. Witnessing this odd phenomenon, Chi Wei was greatly alarmed and immediately pulled Chi Zhiyun back by several li.

"Let's go!"

The other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators also quickly fled without looking back. The two figures in the sky appeared before him quickly, and the one with a sharper voice called out to him fiercely.

"Duanmu Kui!"

Duanmu Kui, oblivious, continued to rub his face. His skin was now flaking off in pieces and chunks, revealing the bone beneath. The spirit lights of his spells had faded, transforming into rising wisps of ghostly light instead.

"Duanmu Kui!"

The figure called his name out three more times before exchanging a glance with his companion. He then sighed softly.

"Who are you?!"

Duanmu Kui then looked up, his facial skin now grotesquely shredded, revealing an eerie, skeletal face beneath. He chuckled darkly and let out a piercing shriek that reverberated through the vast sky.

"I am... the Locust Shade Ghost!"

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Tongya sat solemnly in a chilly secret chamber, holding a warm jade stone in his hand. He had been overseeing Mulu Town for the past few days, waiting to return home once order was restored. His spiritual sense occasionally swept over various locations, vigilant for any disturbances.

The Li Family had scavenged three Qi Cultivation Realm treasures from the entirety of Eastern Mount Yue, one of which was the jade stone in his hand. Known for stabilizing qi and enhancing concentration, it also expedited cultivation and was thus effective for Qi Cultivators. Hence, it was promptly sent to Li Tongya.

The other two items were a Qi Cultivation Realm longsword and a small shield which Li Tongya gave to Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanfeng respectively, providing Li Xuanxuan with a Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifact.

"In addition to the spirit fields and manpower of Eastern Mount Yue, the family has also amassed a significant collection of spirit items and dharma artifacts over the years, much to the delight and benefit of the younger generations."

Li Tongya immersed his spiritual sense into his Qihai acupoint, where his cultivation at the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm manifested as a swirling mass of white qi.

Beneath the ethereal veil of white qi lay a calm lake, its water formed by his condensed true essence. Thanks to the blessing of the Deep Ocean Long Whale Talisman and River One Qi Technique, the lake was as vast as an ocean instead.

Li Tongya, who had yet to show signs of forming an immortal foundation, had read the River One Qi Technique back and forth over a dozen times, memorizing its crucial points.

He estimated that it would take about another decade for him to establish his immortal foundation. As he concentrated on his cultivation, a piercing scream interrupted his thoughts and cut through his silence. It was so loud that it echoed through his mind.

"I am... Locust Shade Ghost!"

Li Tongya, who was deeply engrossed in meditation, was immediately jolted from his state by the unexpected shriek. He instantly turned pale as he exhaled a frustrated and alarmed breath, his mind racing to discern the source of the disturbance.

Who was that?!

After briefly regulating his breathing, Li Tongya pushed open the stone door and ascended into the sky, where he saw several younger Qi Cultivators of the Li Family with grim expressions on their faces.

Chen Donghe, Li Xuanfeng, and others stood aloft in silence, looking westward.

Li Tongya looked toward the west, where dark clouds swarmed the sky and thunder boomed. Brilliant bursts of mana light flickered continuously from within the cloud, resonating with loud explosions.

This all caused his heart to skip a beat as he murmured, "This day has arrived earlier than expected... It seems that the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of Mount Yue might be breaking through to the Golden Core Realm. However... it's uncertain whether this phenomenon indicates success or failure."

Li Xuanfeng joined him, his expression grave. The Golden Age Longbow on his back glistened in the sunlight as he said to Li Tongya, "Judging by the days, it's likely that the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of Mount Yue is attempting to break through to the Golden Core Realm... However, given the current scene, it appears there may be a battle happening above."

"Mount Wu will disperse, and the territory of Mount Yue will fall into the hands of Azure Pond Sect..." Li Tongya paused, then added in a low voice, "As for why there is a battle, it might be that the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of Mount Yue has enemies seeking revenge. These matters are common for high-level cultivators and are not of our concern. However, we should inform the Xiao Family of this news... Donghe, you fly to the prefecture and notify the Xiao Family."

"Understood," Chen Donghe replied with a nod before flying eastward along the Guli Road right away.

Li Xuanxuan, who had been standing nearby, nodded in response to the news, his expression tinged with worry.

"According to the Xiao Family, the territories of Mount Yue will be divided among the Mount Yue Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators aligned with Azure Pond Sect... However, it is uncertain which Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators adjacent to our family will take control. The situation on the lake is about to change again..."




# Chapter 201: Fei Luoya

Several members of the Li Family were observing the sky when they saw several streaks of light coming from the north, stopping over the territory of Eastern Mount Yue.

Li Tongya and Li Xuanfeng exchanged glances, murmuring, "With such a commotion, no family on the lake could fail to notice. Now, things are getting interesting."

Sure enough, the leading streak of light slowed down, revealing a middle-aged man dressed in black clothes. He stood with his hands behind his back, exuding an imposing aura. He swept his gaze over Li Tongya, and said softly, "Tongya, my young friend... it has been several years. Your cultivation has greatly improved!"

"Greetings, Senior!" Li Tongya greeted as he flew up to greet the man, who was none other than Yu Xiaogui, the father of Yu Mugao and the ancestor of the Yu Family‚Äîa Foundation Establishment Realm immortal cultivator.

Yu Xiaogui nodded as he scanned Li Tongya from top to bottom, but another streak of light joined them. A middle-aged man in white brocade robes descended gracefully, looking distinguished and elegant. It was Fei Wangbai, the ancestor of the second Foundation Establishment Realm clan on the lake.

"After so many years, Brother Tongya still looks splendid!"

Fei Wangbai's tone was warm, contrasting sharply with Yu Xiaogui's. Li Tongya cupped his fist in response, feeling helpless inside.

"Greetings, Senior!" he greeted.

Li Tongya glanced to the side and indeed saw Yu Xiaogui snort coldly, clearly irritated by the close relations between the Fei and Li families, as well as Fei Wangbai's friendliness.

He stated coldly, "The head of the Fei Family is indeed good-natured."

Fei Wangbai simply chuckled in response to his snide comment. Soon, more streaks of light arrived with the leader being An Zheyan, the head of the An Family. He wore a large leather hat atop his plump face, trailing behind Yu Mugao of the Yu Family.

In no time, all the Qi Cultivation Realm families from the lake had gathered. An Zheyan looked up at the two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators and asked respectfully, "May I know if the seniors have any insight into this phenomenon..?"

Yu Xiaogui glanced at An Zheyan without a word while Yu Mugao stepped forward with a wave of his sleeve, drawing everyone's attention. His voice was gravely solemn when he spoke.

"I received a message from my brother, stating that a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from Mount Yue is breaking through to the Golden Core Realm... thus causing these unusual phenomena."

"Your esteemed clan indeed has well-informed sources," An Zheyan praised loudly, to which Yu Mugao grimaced and shook his head.

Noticing the members of the Li Family below, Yu Mugao suddenly realized something, and he thought bitterly to himself, No wonder the Li Family has been acting strange... They must have already received the news early and seized the opportunity to advance westward. How infuriating... We have no other Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to rely on in the sect, and with Muxian in seclusion recently, we were informed too late, allowing the Li Family to effortlessly annex this territory.

Yu Mugao's gaze swept over Li Tongya and Li Xuanfeng, and his unease grew as he pondered, Now that the Li Family has taken over the lands of Eastern Mount Yue, there's no room for us to intervene. With the support of several hundred thousand people, the Li Family is not the same as before... They're becoming even more difficult to handle now.

With a snort, Yu Mugao further validated An Zheyan‚Äôs thoughts, saying, "We're no match to the Li Family... I wouldn't be surprised if Senior Tongya had been aware of this situation for quite some time and had already strategized accordingly!"

All the cultivators then turned their attention to Li Tongya, who knew he could not avoid the topic and stepped forward to offer a futile response.

"We've also just received the news from the sect..."

An Zheyan scoffed and questioned, "How come I heard that your family had obtained the heir of Mount Yue years ago, carefully nurtured him, and conveniently elevated him to power just as Mount Yue‚Äôs Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was about to break through, thereby gaining control over Eastern Mount Yue? If you weren't privy to early information and meticulously prepared, how could such a coincidence occur?"

Li Tongya glanced at An Zheyan, noting his sarcastic tone. He then shook his head slightly, responding, "It was merely a timely opportunity that we took advantage of, nothing compared to your clan's ability to manipulate and sow discord."

"You...!"

An Zheyan did not expect Li Tongya to counter so bluntly. His face changed color, and he was about to speak when a figure quickly approached from the west, diverting everyone's attention. An Zheyan closed his mouth and looked over with an ugly expression.

The newcomer, dressed in elaborate clothing and wearing a storage pouch typical of cultivators but with the appearance of a Mount Yue person, stopped not far from the group. He was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, and he was cautiously observing everyone.

"People of Mount Wu..."

Yu Xiaogui and Fei Wangbai both tensed up, unsure of whether the Mount Yue Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had succeeded or failed. After a moment of staring contest, the Mount Yue Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator finally spoke up.

"Are you people from Azure Chi?"

Given that Azure Chi and Azure Pond shared the same pronunciation, no one found his question strange[1].

As the highest-ranking cultivator and leader of the dominant family on the lake, Yu Xiaogui responded, "Indeed... Are you one of the Mount Wu group?"

Unexpectedly, the Mount Yue Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator scoffed and announced, "Mount Wu is no more. Duanmu Kui's attempt to break through ended in failure, resulting in his demise. The wealth and knowledge of Mount Wu have been distributed among several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. We have submitted to the Azure Chi sect, and henceforth, we are allies... I look forward to collaborating with each of you."

Upon hearing this, Yu Xiaogui was momentarily taken aback before his expression turned sour.

The cultivators from Mount Wu, with their cultivation ranging from early to peak Foundation Establishment Realm and their proficiency in shamanic spells, made them even more challenging to deal with than ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

If they were to join the Azure Pond Sect and a few of them settled down, they could easily establish several Foundation Establishment Realm clans.

The Yu Family had firmly established themselves on the lake for many years, cultivating a system where tributes from neighboring families flowed steadily to them. The emergence of several additional Foundation Establishment Realm clans could potentially upset the stability they had painstakingly maintained.

Naturally, Yu Xiaogui was displeased. Observing the perplexed expressions below, he explained, "The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from Mount Yue was known as Duanmu Kui."

"The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator has fallen..."

Everyone paused at this revelation, lamenting the death of a high-ranking Purple Mansion Realm cultivator right before them.

Someone muttered, "It's actually for the best... Yue State hasn't had a Golden Core Realm cultivator for many years. If he had achieved it, we wouldn't be under Azure Pond Sect anymore... We'd all end up following Mount Yue along with the three sects and seven gates."

Although the comment was blunt and even brought a slight smile to some faces, it truly expressed everyone's sentiments.

Yu Xiaogui, slightly agitated, broke the silence. "If you plan to stay here long-term, we'll be neighbors. Once you establish your immortal mountain and spread your lineage, we will come to celebrate."

"Of course."

The Mount Yue Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was cautious and had merely responded politely as he had yet to fully understand power dynamics here.

Yu Xiaogui nodded and then departed with Yu Mugao.

As soon as Yu Xiaogui left, the atmosphere immediately became more lively. Many approached Li Tongya to congratulate him, to which he thanked each one.

He then turned to the Mount Yue Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator and said solemnly, "May I know your name, Senior? I am Li Tongya from the Li Family... As our families will be neighbors, I hope we will get along well with each other."

"Fei Luoya."

The Mount Yue Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator stated his name with a serious tone. Although he did not regard a mere Qi Cultivator highly, he was polite, not knowing if the Li Family had any Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. He looked down at the palace of Eastern Mount Yue and raised an eyebrow.

"Although I rarely venture out of Mount Wu, I know the boundary between Azure Chi and Mount Wu was set at Big Fish Creek. What brings you moving east?"

Fei Luoya stared coldly at Li Tongya, his Foundation Establishment Realm authority showing, but Li Tongya was unfazed and simply chuckled.

"Surely, you must be jesting, Senior. Since Mount Wu no longer exists, this land is owned by no one, and it's only natural for my family to expand eastward."

Seeing Li Tongya so unfazed, Fei Luoya narrowed his eyes and said in an aggressive tone, "When my brothers and I set boundaries, we agreed that everything east of Big Fish Creek was my territory; I cannot let this go unjustly. Your cultivation realm is humble; get your elder to speak with me!"

1. Azure Chi and Azure Pond actually share the same pronunciation in Chinese‚Äî"Qing Chi". The Chi character used for Azure Chi was the same as Chi Wei's surname, but could also mean "late". Since the Chinese word for "pond" was also pronounced as "Chi", hence, no one found any issue with the question. ‚òú




# Chapter 202: The Retreat

Li Tongya cupped his fist respectfully and replied, "Our Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator has been ordered by the sect to go on an expedition to eliminate demons, hence he is not currently available..."

Li Tongya had first heard from the White Banyan Fox about the Demon King refining pills at the southern border. Although Fei Luoya, often isolated on Mount Wu, was unaware of worldly affairs, Li Tongya crafted the story carefully, simply choosing to mention that Li Chejing was out on a demon-exterminating mission without specifying that it was in the southern border.

Upon hearing this, Fei Luoya frowned. People from Mount Yue were not keen to beat around the bushes, so he demanded directly, "What is the cultivation realm of your family elder?"

Just as Li Tongya was about to respond, a figure descended next to him. This person was dressed in a flowing white robe, exuding an air of elegance.

It was none other than Fei Wangbai, the head of the Fei Family.

"Greetings, fellow Daoists," Fei Wangbai cupped his fist and greeted, carrying a white long spear that was strapped to his back.

Li Tongya returned the greeting respectfully. Fei Luoya, seeing that Fei Wangbai was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, also returned the greetings in a proper manner.

Fei Wangbai raised an eyebrow and chuckled. "What's going on? Does anyone dare to provoke the sword immortal's clan?"

It was apparent from a distance that Fei Luoya was likely here to cause trouble, so Fei Wangbai stepped forward to show support.

Fei Luoya furrowed his brow at the mention of the sword immortal, feeling somewhat uneasy now.
ùïóùê´ùêûùïñùï®ùêûùóØùöóùï†ùòÉùêûùöï.ùêúùóºùöñ

"Of course not! Senior Fei Luoya merely wishes to meet the sword immortal," Li Tongya replied in a soothing voice.

Hearing this eased Fei Luoya‚Äôs mind a little, but Fei Wangbai laughed heartily and teased, "Everyone on the thirty-six peaks inside the sect and five prefectures in the Yue State wishes to behold the sword immortal's face. My fellow Daoist, you are quite bold... Could it be since no one is currently guarding the Li Family, you intend to bully those under the banner of the Qingsui Sword Immortal?"

Fei Wangbai‚Äôs lavish praises sounded more convincing than if Li Tongya were to speak those by himself, which immediately startled Fei Luoya. Although he had been confined to Mount Wu by Duanmu Kui for many years and was not well-versed in worldly affairs, he was still a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator.

He gritted his teeth and scoffed, "Do not try to scare me, fellow Daoist... We, the people of Mount Yue, are not so ceremonious. We take what we can defeat and flee when we cannot win. The revered sword immortal is not even present here. To expect me to yield to a mere Qi Cultivator is too much..."

Though Fei Luoya spoke with a tough voice, his tone had softened considerably and he had even begun to consider retreating.

It's just a few pieces of land after all... I might as well let him have it. As a Foundation Establishment Realm immortal cultivator, gaining this worthless land brings me no benefits. I was only fighting to get back a little bit of pride.

Just as Fei Luoya was about to lift his head and offer some conciliatory words, two streaks of light arrived from the east.

A middle-aged man adorned with sachets and an old man clad in a gray robe landed next to Li Tongya. The middle-aged man cupped his fist and greeted Li Tongya, then gave Fei Luoya a sidelong glance before letting a wry smile cross his face.

"Brother Tongya, it seems I'm not too late..."

"Greetings, Seniors!" Li Tongya cupped his fist and greeted with a light chuckle. The middle-aged man was Xiao Yuansi.

Turning to look at the old man, whose face bore a resemblance to Xiao Yongling, Li Tongya knew he was a member of the Xiao Family and respectfully inquired, "And who might this be?"

"Xiao Chuchou of the Xiao Family," the old man answered warmly, his eyes twinkling as he stared at Fei Luoya.

Fei Luoya, sensing the cultivation realms of the two men‚Äîone at the early stage and the other at the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm‚Äîsuddenly felt a sense of crisis.

The alliance of these three could potentially detain him here. While his heart was racing, he heard Xiao Yuansi begin to speak.

"And you are..?"

Fei Luoya's demeanor changed immediately as he quickly smiled broadly and replied warmly, "I am Fei Luoya, formerly of Mount Wu... Now that I'm settling down here, I thought to acquaint myself with Brother Tongya and witness the might of the sword immortal!."

"Oh," Fei Wangbai chuckled softly, choosing not to expose Fei Luoya's pretense.

Li Tongya courteously responded, "Since we are neighbors from now on, Senior Fei Luoya is most welcome to visit my Mount Lijing."

"Of course... of course..." Fei Luoya quickly acquiesced, laughing awkwardly before hastily coming up with an excuse to take his leave.

Fei Wangbai then turned to greet the two from the Xiao Family. Seeing that they appeared to have more to discuss, he politely excused himself.

"There are urgent matters at home, so I won't disturb Brother Tongya any longer!"

"Take care, Senior... I will visit you in a few days," Li Tongya said. Although he had not yet achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm, his power was second only to Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators on the lake.

Fei Wangbai, keen on fostering a good relationship, addressed him as an equal while Li Tongya continued to refer to him as senior‚Äîa formality that put a small smile on Xiao Yuansi's face.

"Thank you for coming to support me during my time of need, Seniors."

Li Tongya‚Äôs face was earnest as he expressed his gratitude. Together, they descended to the palace where the servants immediately served them tea.

Xiao Chuchou, with his head full of white hair, took a sip of tea and said softly, "Given the current relationship between our families, I will speak frankly... We didn‚Äôt come solely for your sake."

"Decades ago, I traveled through various states with a Buddhist. In the mountains of Mount Yue's territory, we discovered a precious herb guarded by a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm demon beast. At that time, I was only at the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm and also wary of attracting the attention of Mount Wu, so I noted the location and left disappointed. Now that Mount Wu no longer exists, I brought Yuansi here hoping to retrieve that herb," he explained.

"I see," Li Tongya remarked as Xiao Chuchou was clearly the senior member of the Xiao Family; even Xiao Yuansi listened respectfully without speaking.

Li Tongya agreed with a nod before Xiao Chuchou smiled.

"I‚Äôve heard that your elegance is unmatched, and indeed it is so. Speaking of which, I must thank your Li Family... If it weren‚Äôt for the sword immortal obtaining an Essence Gathering Pill for our family, my son might not have broken through."

Li Tongya responded modestly and chatted briefly with Xiao Chuchou before voicing a question that had been on his mind. "May I ask about the Buddhist, Senior?"

Xiao Chuchou sipped his tea leisurely and replied, "You are still young and haven‚Äôt traveled far from home. Our Yue State is in the south, controlled by our Dao gate, and so is the Great Xu to the north... If you cross the long river to the north, reaching the states of Yan and Zhao, that‚Äôs the territory of the Buddhists."

"The world is vast, not dominated by our Golden Core Dao Gate alone. Buddhism also has its cultivation methods that differ from ours... However..." Xiao Chuchou shook his head, a flicker of fear crossing his face as he clenched his teeth and advised, "When you encounter a Buddhist, it's best to deal with them superficially and refrain from associating yourself too closely with them. Those who are not firm in mind can be swayed by a single encounter, falling into many traps."

"In this world, there are minor paths such as shamanic spells and curses, as well as major ones that involve consuming blood for power like the Purple Mansion Realm and Golden Core Realm. Your chosen Dao path is yours to decide, guided by the desires of your heart. But once you embrace Buddhism, you no longer have a say in the matter."

Li Tongya shivered slightly at the warning, relieved that Buddhism lay far to the north and was not an immediate concern.

"Thank you for the caution, Senior," he said respectfully.

Xiao Chuchou nodded and exchanged a few more words with the men before noticing how much time had passed. He and Xiao Yuansi rose into the sky in search of the medicinal herb, not wanting others to reach it first. Li Tongya courteously saw them off beyond his territory.

As they flew onward, Xiao Chuchou seemed to still be lost in the memories of his youthful adventures. Xiao Yuansi glanced at him and whispered in his ear, "Ancestor, about the herb..."

"The herb is secondary," Xiao Chuchou interrupted, shaking his head.

"Though the herb is real, it's also a distraction; I know of several relics likely left by the people of Mount Wu, guarded by seals. Now that Mount Wu has fallen, it‚Äôs the perfect time to explore them. If we could find even a page or two of that book, it would be immensely beneficial to our family."

Xiao Yuansi nodded, his heart set on the book bestowed by the immortal, murmuring, "Answers to a Beggar‚Äôs Questions Under the Mulberry Tree... that‚Äôs surely a Grade Seven or Eight immortal text."

"Don't get your hopes too high," Xiao Chuchou cautioned softly.

"If there was a trace of this book at Mount Wu, those Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would have already fought over it... Duanmu Kui's old tales are too ancient; perhaps the story of the immortal‚Äôs gift is just something he fabricated to aggrandize himself."

As they continued on their flight, Xiao Yuansi expressed his puzzlement.

"So, Duanmu Kui ultimately failed... Is attaining the Golden Core Realm really so difficult? Despite hundreds of years and countless Purple Mansion Realm cultivators that have attempted to break through, not a single one has succeeded..."

Xiao Chuchou chuckled and replied, "Golden Core Realm... Refining the metallic essence can extend your lifespan by a thousand years... As long as one is not discovered by the emissaries of death, even a dead Golden Core Realm cultivator can continue to linger in the mortal realm by virtue of this metallic essence. Therefore, such prestige is not easily achieved."




# Chapter 203: The Clan Gathering

With Fei Luoya's recognition, the territory of Eastern Mount Yue was entirely and undisputedly in the hands of the Li Family.

After settling the affairs of the six major clans and determining the locations and outputs of the various spirit fields, the return to Mount Lijing was finally scheduled.

In the front hall of the Mount Yue Palace, Li Yuanxiu wrote down his thoughts on a fabric sheet for a while then drafted his speech. He then put down his brush and glanced at the time, whispering, "Pingyi, bring the maps... let's go and pay our respects to the elders together."

Li Pingyi tightened his sleeves and took a scroll of maps in his hands, before following closely behind Li Yuanxiu. He appeared to be slightly nervous. They walked through the long corridor flanked by clan guards who stood silently, holding their weapons without even a glance sideways.

After walking a while, Li Yuanxiu and Li Pingyi entered the palace's rear hall and saw Li Feiruo respectfully standing at the doorway. Li Pingyi slightly looked up and softly called out, "Aunt."

Li Feiruo, Li Pingyi's paternal aunt, had been married off when Li Pingyi was very young and had only returned home during festivals or rituals. Each visit, she discussed the affairs of Mount Yue with her elder brother Li Xiewen, and by the next day, these discussions would have been compiled and placed neatly on Li Xuanxuan's desk. Although Li Pingyi was not very close to her, he still smiled and greeted her.

"Young Family Head, Yi'er," Li Feiruo acknowledged them softly before they all entered the hall together.

Inside, Li Yuanxiu saw that the seat at the head of the hall was empty. On the left sat a middle-aged man with sharp features and equipped with a golden bow, who was joking about something. It was Li Xuanfeng. To the right was his own father, Li Xuanxuan, who listened intently and nodded in agreement from time to time.
ùíªùëü‚ÑØ‚ÑØùë§ùëíùëèùëõùò∞ùìãùëíùìÅ.ùí∏ùëúùòÆ

Next to him was his third uncle Li Xuanling, who, currently at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, was expected to break through within the next few years. He held a jade slip and nodded slightly upon seeing Li Yuanxiu.

Chen Donghe and Li Qiuyang sat quietly next in line, not daring to speak. Further down sat Li Xiewen and other influential clan uncles. The elders of the family were not here due to their age, so those present were relatively younger but still held significant positions within the family.

"Greetings, Seniors," Li Yuanxiu and the others began. After waiting a while at the bottom of the steps, someone flew into the hall with the wind, prompting everyone to stand and greet him in unison.

"Welcome, Clan Uncle/Ancestor/Second Uncle!"

"I am late. Thank you all for waiting..." Li Tongya said as he settled into the seat at the head of the hall and nodded at Li Yuanxiu, who stepped forward. His tone was solemn and serious when he spoke.

"Our Li Family now fully controls Eastern Mount Yue, and we have gathered 54 spirit items worth 32 Spirit Stones, and seven Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts and shamanic tools worth over 40 Spirit Stones."

Li Yuanxiu paused. Having already reported three Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts to Li Tongya privately, he skipped them in the list thus avoiding provoking idle talk among the clan uncles.

He then changed the subject, saying, "Currently, our Li Family needs to submit a tribute every five years consisting of 1,000 jin of Spirit Saddies, 100 White Essence Fruits, 300 jin of Yellow Jade Spirit Rice, and 25 Spirit Stones, along with various other spirit goods worth a total of 50 Spirit Stones.

"The native yield of Spirit Paddies on Mount Lijing is around 1,300 jin. Since we acquired the territory of Eastern Mount Yue, there's been a shortage of manpower, and the productive spirit fields there currently yield about 1,000 jin... After distributing the clan allowances to the cultivators, we can have a surplus of 800 jin of Spirit Paddies every five years. The main income, however, comes from the ebony mine, bringing in about 30 Spirit Stones every five years."

Li Yuanxiu made a gesture, and Li Pingyi unrolled a map. Li Yuanxiu detailed the distribution of the spirit fields, their fertility, and sterility as the elders listened intently.

Li Tongya thought to himself, This doesn't even include talismans and miscellaneous items like Wuzha Spirit Silk... If those were counted, the income could reach 40 Spirit Stones. With the 30 Spirit Stones we have in reserve, in a few years, we could afford to commission a formation for Mount Huaqian!

Observing the junior members below, Li Tongya nodded slightly and spoke warmly, "This occupation of Eastern Mount Yue required effort from all present... The family will reward you according to your contributions when we return to the town."

The crowd thanked him in unison. The clan uncles below whispered among themselves and exchanged glances, until finally, one of the minor sect cultivators stood up. He was a third stage Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator and looked up hesitantly before speaking.

"The acquisition of Eastern Mount Yue territory is largely due to the efforts of our Qi Cultivation Realm elders. We merely played a supporting role and dare not claim credit... However..."

As he stood up, Li Qiuyang, the head of the minor sect cultivators, looked startled and somewhat angry, clearly taken aback by the unfolding events.

Li Qiuyang clenched his teeth, and Chen Donghe, who was beside him, placed a hand on his shoulder and shook his head gently.

The minor sect cultivator suddenly fell to his knees and said earnestly, "Now that Eastern Mount Yue is wholly ours, we beseech the elders to abolish the Mount Yue royal lineage and its governance system to ensure control under the Li Family... and prevent any loyalty conflicts from the royal heirs!"

While this minor sect cultivator was still speaking, Li Qiuyang suddenly had an epiphany and sighed silently. Without a word, he hung his head in dejection.

The struggle for benefit is inevitable, Li Yuanxiu thought to himself with his back facing the speaker.

He was fully aware of their intentions. With the Li Family's towns and villages already under the administration of his several illegitimate half-brothers, who were quite cunning, these minor sect members naturally lacked the power to compete with them. Hence, they turned their attention to the lands of Eastern Mount Yue.

Having previously hinted multiple times and having firmly chastised them, my clan brothers were still not deterred, seeking yet another gamble in the presence of our granduncle...

Li Yuanxiu narrowed his eyes. If the royal lineage of Eastern Mount Yue was removed and the territory directly administered by the Li Family, the numerous towns that might emerge would naturally tempt these individuals to propose a significant candidate to test the waters.

Moreover, this individual is a junior... Even if something were to go awry, there would be enough room to navigate through it.

After the minor sect cultivator had finished delivering his prepared speech, Li Yuanxiu gave a slight smile without turning his head. He spoke softly.

"The land of Eastern Mount Yue has been through numerous wars... the people are in turmoil, it is a turbulent time. For the Li Family to take over now is merely inheriting a mess that drains resources, consumes food and craftsmen, and would require further resources to manage a group of officials who capitalize on the chaos..."

Li Yuanxiu stepped forward, his implications causing the faces of the clan uncles to change. His gaze swept over the faces of the various clan uncles, compelling them all to lower their heads.

He smiled and continued, "My family is interested in the spirit items and spirit fields of Mount Yue. Now that we have obtained these, during this time of great resentment among the people, it would be better to let Shamoli govern over them. Let the blame for grievances fall on the King of Mount Yue, and the backlash on Shamoli. When Mount Yue changes its customs and the people's strength is restored, we can gradually absorb more territory. By that time, the people's lives will have improved, and they will recognize these as the merits of the Li Family."

Hearing this, Li Tongya, sitting at the head of the hall, smiled in approval and nodded subtly. With a dismissive wave of his hand, he declared firmly, "The royal family of Eastern Mount Yue is nominally a vassal, but actually a puppet of ours... This matter is settled. No further discussion is needed."

"Yes," was the collective response.

Li Tongya, one of the highest-ranking and strongest in the family, respected as an elder and nicknamed the 'Grand Elder of the Li Family,' spoke softly but decisively. Hence, his statement prompted everyone to stand and agree, settling the matter with finality.

The minor sect cultivator awkwardly returned to his place. The smaller branch members exchanged glances and all sighed softly, realizing the futility of their aspirations.

Li Yuanxiu briskly turned the page on the matter, adding, "From the second lunar month until today, we've been stationed in Eastern Mount Yue for twenty-seven days. Thirteen clan members have committed violations of indulgence... nine have abused their powers for personal gain, and seven others committed various smaller offenses."

"Those who incited troops are to be stripped of their ranks and imprisoned, and from squad leader upward, all are to be executed if they could not dissuade their subordinates..." Li Yuanxiu paused here as his voice trailed off, his tone hinting at the gruesome nature of the punishments. This made some of the younger members flinch.

He continued, "Those who accepted bribes are to be stripped of their positions, and those who offered bribes are to be imprisoned or executed‚Äînever to be employed again."

Li Yuanxiu then concluded the rest of the administrative matters. Li Tongya nodded and assigned a few people to stay in Eastern Mount Yue to oversee the spirit fields and manage the local cultivators.

"The matters of Eastern Mount Yue are concluded; withdraw the troops and return home," he said.




# Chapter 204: News from the An Family

Spring rains were gentle and nourishing, and thousands of acres of fertile fields sprouted lush green seedlings. A farmer in a straw raincoat straightened up in the fields, looking worriedly at the soldiers hastening back.

"My child joined the army; I wonder if he was hurt..."

A few days earlier, the farmer had received news of a great victory in the west with minimal casualties. He knew some soldiers had been executed for indulging in excesses and abuse, but he was not overly concerned.

"I've taught that boy for over a decade; he wouldn't do such things!" he reassured himself.

The muddy earth was compressed under the wheels while gleaming armor clashed in the rain, ringing out sonorously. The crystal-clear raindrops split in two upon hitting the sharp blades and rolled off swiftly, dripping onto Xu Gongming's eyebrows.

Xu Gongming looked ahead at the dark carriage frame, reviewing his conduct along the way and feeling satisfied that he had lived up to Old Master Xu's teachings. He visibly relaxed. Just then, he saw a rider approaching amidst the drizzle, a flag fluttering weakly behind him.

"Riding in the rain... it must be urgent news!" Xu Gongming perked up immediately and quickly moved forward.

The rider, whose cultivation was at the third stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm, reined in his horse in front of the carriage before carefully dismounting. He then handed over a bamboo tube, stating gravely, "A message from Mount Huaqian!"

Xu Gongming took it and climbed onto the carriage step. He shook off the rain and saw Li Pingyi emerge from behind the curtains to take the bamboo tube, bowing as he retreated back into the carriage.

"The first branch of the minor clans..." Xu Gongming looked enviously at Li Pingyi. Li Yesheng's branch was always the closest to the main family and was highly respected among the various branches, always priding themselves as confidants of the main family. It was a status even higher than that of Li Qiuyang's branch, fueling Xu Gongming's envy.

"If only the elders in charge during Lord Xuanxuan's time had been competent, we wouldn't be in this position..." Xu Gongming hopped down from the carriage, looking at the young man who had arrived on horseback.

He gave him a smile before asking, "May I know your name?"

"Tian Zhongqing."

The young man raised his wet eyebrows and responded politely with a sincere expression.

"So, you are a son of the Tian Family..." Xu Gongming gave a slight smile before ending the conversation, mindful of Old Master Xu's instruction to refrain from associating with prominent families. He chose to remain silent.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

"Young Family Head, there's a letter from Mount Huaqian," Li Pingyi said as he removed the cloth covering from the wooden tube and walked to Li Yuanxiu's side.

Li Yuanxiu withdrew his gaze from the wooden scroll and whispered to himself, "Mount Huaqian..? Whatever could be the matter with Mount Huaqian?"

Taking the wooden scroll, Li Yuanxiu removed the wax seal and unfolded the white cloth inside, carefully reading the single sentence written on it.

Confidential: A letter from An Family's informant. An Zheyan confessed after getting drunk, revealing that An Jingming had broken through to the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

"Eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm?!"

Li Yuanxiu was stunned for a moment, finding this hard to believe. He raised his head in disbelief and murmured softly, "How is that possible? An Jingming is only... about twenty-three or twenty-four, right..? Is he going to break through to Foundation Establishment Realm at thirty?! How talented is he?"

Li Pingyi remained wordless and did not respond while Li Yuanxiu furrowed his brow in thought. When he spoke again, his voice was low.

"Summon the messenger."

Li Pingyi nodded and exited. Shortly after, a man came in, removing his straw raincoat to reveal a damp tight-fitting robe. He cupped his fist respectfully before answering.

"Tian Zhongqing pays respects to Young Family Head."

"Tian Zhongqing..."

Li Yuanxiu felt a sense of familiarity with the name but could not quite place his finger on where he had heard it before. He then asked softly, "Which generation do you belong to?"

This was Tian Zhongqing's first meeting with Li Yuanxiu, but he was not nervous. He raised his head and smiled. "Tian Yun, the wife of Lord Xiangping, is my father's paternal aunt, and I am her grandnephew."

"Ah."

Li Yuanxiu noted that Tian Zhongqing was seventeen or eighteen years old and was already at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, carrying himself with composure. He stored this information in his mind and nodded, saying, "Take this letter to the military accounting office and deliver it to my father."

"Understood."

Tian Zhongqing took the wooden scroll and wrapped it in a cloth bag before stamping a wax seal on it. He covered it with two layers of cloth before briskly leaving the carriage, riding westward along the military formation.

"This person is the eldest grandson of the Tian Family, the leader of the younger generation of their family," Li Pingyi said as he stepped forward to remind Li Yuanxiu, who simply nodded in agreement.

"That's not bad at all."

Rolling up the wooden scroll in his hand, Li Yuanxiu pondered inwardly, It's no wonder that the surrounding families are reluctant to let outsiders cultivate... How can a family compete with several families? With more people, there will always be a few geniuses. By then, allowing outsiders to become the top cultivators of the family would make things difficult! Fortunately, our family has the mirror and talisman seed which can accelerate cultivation speed, ensuring that the decent talent of each generation... It allows for our assurance, at least.

Returning from his thoughts, Li Yuanxiu picked up another wooden scroll from the desk and said in a low voice, "With An Jingming's talent and An Zheyan's careless behavior... how can he live long?"

After a moment of careful consideration, Li Yuanxiu felt rather uneasy. Setting down the wooden scroll in his hand, he declared firmly, "No, I must personally go and find Father!"

With that, he donned his raincoat and swiftly left the carriage to search for Li Xuanxuan.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Tongya slowly opened his eyes and waited a few moments before the carriage door was gently knocked on. He exhaled a breath of white air and said softly, "Come in and talk."

Li Xuanxuan pushed the door open and entered. The rain outside was getting heavier, but not a drop had touched him. Li Xuanxuan was also about forty years old, but due to his breakthrough to the Qi Cultivation Realm, much of the white at his temples had vanished, making him appear just over thirty. His expression was grave as he followed Li Yuanxiu into the room, his clothes slightly damp from the rain.

"Second Uncle, An Jingming has already broken through to the eighth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm..." Li Xuanxuan said as he looked up at Li Tongya with a serious expression, adding, "This matter is of great importance, so I came to report it as soon as I received the news."

Li Tongya raised his eyebrows in surprise. He had anticipated An Jingming's rapid cultivation progress but had not expected it to reach such an extent. He said in a deep voice, "An Jingming isn't even thirty yet, is he?"

"Twenty-three or twenty-four," was the reply.

Li Tongya calculated the time; the last time he had seen An Jingming was over seven or eight years ago when the boy was only fifteen and at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Now, he was already at the eighth heavenly layer. Li Tongya murmured quietly to himself, deep in thought.

"That's roughly one heavenly layer per year..."

Li Tongya found it increasingly unbelievable. Normally, a Qi Cultivator would take over five years to advance one heavenly layer; three to five years was considered extremely quick.

If one's talent was not considered good enough, it could even take up to seven or eight years... Yet, An Jingming had managed to advance five heavenly layers in just seven years, including two heavenly layers during the demanding later stages of the Qi Cultivation Realm, nearly catching up to Li Tongya himself!

Li Tongya knew that if he had not received the Deep Ocean Long Whale Talisman, his own cultivation would at best be at only the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, perhaps even lower than An Jingming.

Li Xuanxuan, who had only recently broken through the Qi Cultivation Realm himself and knew the difficulties involved, saw Li Tongya's silence and felt uneasy. He spoke in a low voice, "The spirit veins in Mount Huazhong are thin and inferior to those of Mount Huaqian, let alone Azure Pond Peak... I've heard that disciples in sects who consume heavenly treasures and bathe in spirit fluids advance one heavenly layer every two to three years... how does one advance one heavenly layer per year?!"

Li Xuanxuan paused, then clenched his already tensed jaw.

"I've heard gossip in the markets about reincarnated immortals who progress swiftly due to their past life's cultivation. Could this person be... some reincarnated deity or immortal?"

"That's impossible."

Li Tongya was also shaken but shook his head and said firmly, "If he were indeed a reincarnated being of the Golden Core Realm or higher, we would have been wiped out by him long ago... How could the Yu Family still be jumping around here?"




# Chapter 205: Leaking the News

The rain drizzled outside, yet it was unusually quiet inside the carriage.

Li Tongya stroked his beard and spoke thoughtfully, "This person is quite calculative... Who could have foreseen such rapid progress in his cultivation? He probably hopes to take advantage of the turmoil over the lake to swiftly break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. With that attainment, he could travel between heaven and earth unrestrained. On his territory, he can rely on formations and geographical advantages to resist Yu Xiaogui. Even if he's outside of his territory, the Yu Family is hesitant to act against his family..."

Li Tongya had just finished speaking when Li Yuanxiu picked up the thread, speaking in a grave tone. "Moreover, with his talent, it's impossible for him to stop at Foundation Establishment Realm... Once An Jingming escapes abroad, who would dare to touch his family? In twenty or thirty years, he could return as a peak Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... or even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator!"

Li Xuanxuan was silent for a moment before looking up.

"..But it's not so simple. Our Li Family has now expanded to the borders on both sides. With a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in Mount Yue to the west, there's no way out. If the An Family appears in the east, our Li Family will be sandwiched between Moongaze Lake and Mount Dali, leaving us no room to expand."

Seeing that the two younger men were taking this seriously, Li Tongya nodded, already formulating a plan in his mind. He looked at Li Yuanxiu and asked with a smile, "Do you have a plan?"

Li Yuanxiu was instantly invigorated, knowing that Li Tongya was testing him. He cupped his fist and replied in a low voice, "When our family annexed the Lu Family because of Lu Yuanlu's foolishness, it was done poorly. The families around the lake don't say it openly, but they have been quietly critical and vigilant. If we rashly interfere in the An Family's affairs, we might provoke public anger... For now, we can rely on another tiger to devour the wolf."

Seeing that both elders nodded, Li Yuanxiu smiled and continued, "We are anxious, but the Yu Family is even more so. With the rise of the Xiao Family's business, we have strong external support. We are also internally backed by the deterrence of a sword immortal, allowing An Jingming to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm only means we are trapped in between. However, the Yu Family forcefully collects tributes from the families around the lake and frequently interferes in their affairs, gradually encroaching through vassal marriages, earning them deep resentment from every family. However, the Yu Family's strength is formidable, and Yu Mugao's tactics are sophisticated, managing to suppress and divide the major families, which is exactly why they've stabilized the situation."

Li Yuanxiu chuckled softly and added, "They are the ones who fear An Jingming's advancement to Foundation Establishment Realm the most. Once they learn of this news, even their Purple Mansion Realm ancestor, Yu Xiaogui, might emerge from his seclusion."

"Indeed." Li Tongya nodded in approval, exchanging glances with Li Xuanxuan before instructing, "Since Xiu'er has a plan, you will be left to handle this matter. Leak the news discreetly to the Yu Family."
ùïóùóøùïñùêûùê∞ùó≤ùïìùêßùï†ùïßùó≤ùê•.ùöåùê®ùöñ

"Understood!" Li Yuanxiu said as he cupped his fist, confidently departing to carry out his plan.

Li Xuanxuan watched him go with a chuckle while Li Tongya glanced at him and grinned cheekily.

"You've raised a fine son!"

"Heh." Li Xuanxuan laughed, clasping his fist and adding, "Just so Second Uncle knows, my first wife will give birth again in a few months, adding a sibling born of the same mother to Xiu'er."

"Oh!" Li Tongya raised an eyebrow and spoke softly, "You have indeed done well in this respect. Ling'er is faithful, Feng'er is still trapped in past events, and among the younger generation... you are the only one who has spread his branches and leaves."

With a wave of his hand, Li Tongya's brow furrowed with worry again as he said in a grave tone, "Indeed, An Zheyan was right back then... Yu Mugao is a ruthless man. He fears An Jingming, but he also fears our Li Family. He will certainly not let our family off easily. Over the years, the Fei Family has caused him many troubles, and the Yu Family has annexed two others, so he simply hasn't had the chance to act. The quieter this man is, the more uneasy I feel..."

Li Xuanxuan listened to these words and fell silent for a moment, then cupped his fist once more.

"Now that Xuanling is in seclusion to break through, we brothers must be more cautious... Unless Yu Xiaogui himself takes action, who could possibly threaten us?"

"Indeed..." Li Tongya nodded gently. Li Xuanxuan then asked for some guidance on his cultivation. Although Li Tongya had been cultivating for many years and they did not practice the same techniques, his advice suddenly enlightened Li Xuanxuan, who left in a better mood.

Once I return to the mountain, I can focus on advancing to the Foundation Establishment Realm. I can't rest easy until there's a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator overseeing this lake and mountain...

At this thought, Li Tongya sighed softly and closed his eyes to meditate.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

When the Li Family's troops returned to the four towns of Lijing, there was not much noise of carriages and horses. Most of the influential members of the Li Family had left the town, leaving only Li Yuanyun to welcome them at the town's entrance.

Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanxiu alighted from their carriages and the brothers embraced, talking about the events of the past few months.

Standing nearby, Li Qinghong held her spear with a cheerful smile. Dressed in leather armor, the teenage girl, now around twelve or thirteen years old, had bright eyes and wore her black hair neatly in a ponytail. With the characteristic gray-black eyes of the Li Family, she stood gracefully as she watched her brothers smilingly.

"Qinghong!"

Li Yuanjiao scratched his head awkwardly. Having grown up beside her, he had always treated her more like a boy, and never thought it odd. Now, having been away for a few months and returning to see her blossom into a young lady, he felt momentarily embarrassed and called out to her somewhat awkwardly as if he hardly recognized her.

"What's the matter, Brother Jiao? After fighting in the mountains for months, you don't recognize your little sister anymore?" Li Qinghong's raised her eyebrows slightly as she teased him. Her usually gentle eyes suddenly lit up brightly. Since she wore no makeup on her face, her cheeks were slightly rosy.

"Not at all!" Li Yuanjiao replied as he laughed heartily. The conversation allowed him to feel more at ease and he said, "Once I return to the town, we'll have a match!"

Li Yuanxiu smiled warmly, pulling Li Yuanyun to the front, and prompting Li Qinghong to greet him right away.

"Brother!"

Li Yuanxiu was pondering the arrangements for their return to the town. Hearing her voice, he looked up, his eyes twinkling immediately as he smiled.

"Qinghong, you've grown much taller this year!"

As the younger generation chatted, a serious-looking man with slightly graying temples alighted from the carriage behind them.

It was none other than Li Xuanxuan.

"Father."

Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanxiu called out respectfully, to which Li Xuanxuan nodded in acknowledgment.

The sight of Li Qinghong's smile momentarily stunned him, as if he was seeing Li Jingtian from more than a decade ago. While Li Jingtian exuded a gentler, calmer demeanor, Li Qinghong's eyes sparkled with energy, lending her a lively and assertive air.

"Uncle!" Li Qinghong called out with a smile, which made Li Xuanxuan feel a slight emptiness in his heart. He responded, but his mind had wandered off.

I should visit Jingtian too... Having secluded myself for so many years, and immediately going on a campaign in the mountains after emerging from seclusion, I have not seen her even once.

Li Xuanxuan was instructing these younger relatives on their cultivation while Li Yuanxiu stood behind silently. Li Pingyi quickly approached him and whispered, "Young Family Head, Tian Zhongqing has already been summoned."

Li Yuanxiu ran through his plans repeatedly in his mind before nodding and replying, "Have him wait for me at the Clan Affairs Courtyard."




# Chapter 206: Counter-Espionage

Li Yuanxiu strode into the central hall, while Li Yuanjiao followed closely behind. They saw several clan uncles waiting anxiously in the hall, their expressions frantic and their behavior restrained.

They began pleading, "Young Family Head... please forgive my son's recklessness and allow him to return home..."

"Indeed! Young Family Head, I understand that you're managing the household but you must do so with compassion..."

Li Yuanxiu swept his gaze over them and immediately recognized them as the elders of those clan brothers who had been causing trouble in Eastern Mount Yue, allowing their soldiers to commit atrocities and dishonor others. He simply cupped his fist and spoke in a stern voice.

"It's not that I lack compassion, but my clan brothers had indeed gone overboard with their actions. They took pleasure in slaughtering, bullied the married women and their daughters, and reveled in impaling infants on spears... Can you truly excuse such horrible actions?!"

The elders were startled by his words and exchanged glances amongst themselves. Yet none could stammer out a response.

Li Yuanxiu sighed softly and continued, "Establishing a Clan Affairs Courtyard to maintain order among the clan members was the dying wish of our ancestor, and for many years, there has been no change to this decree. Furthermore, news of this incident has reached my granduncle, and he is quite shocked and angered... I would like to help, but I am powerless. If you can persuade my granduncle to overlook this matter, I will release them immediately."

The ancestor Li Yuanxiu mentioned was none other than Li Mutian. The establishment of the Clan Affairs Courtyard had been a directive of Li Mutian before his passing. The mention of Li Tongya also pressured the elders into silence, causing them to withdraw with a resigned sigh.

Watching the elders leave, Li Yuanxiu then smiled and shook his head as he moved toward the rear hall. Li Yuanjiao, following behind, was amazed and praised him.

"I'm impressed by how quickly you managed to silence such a formidable group of elders!"

"It's no big deal," Li Yuanxiu replied as he chuckled softly and quietly said, "After all, in this world... power is respected. Suppressing others with strength is most convenient. Our methods of governance merely leverage the authority of stronger elders. Without power, no amount of talking will help."

The two laughed and entered the rear hall where incense was burning, with wisps of smoke swirling around.

A man clad in leather armor stood respectfully and vigilantly in the center. He cupped his fist to the approaching men and greeted them with a smile, "Tian Zhongqing pays his respects to the two lords."

"Hmm." Li Yuanxiu acknowledged him and walked to the seat at the head of the hall before addressing him directly, "In Huaqian Town that you oversee, there's a man named Ma Haiji, who is a spy for the Yu Family... Are you aware of this?"

"No, I am not!" Tian Zhongqing was taken aback by this revelation, his pupils dilating slightly as he quickly kneeled on the ground, stammering, "I have failed to discern him clearly..."

Li Yuanxiu waved his hand to stop him and sighed before speaking softly, "This is not your fault... I deliberately allowed this person to remain free. Dealing with spies isn't just about killing them; managing them seems much more reassuring than removing them. At crucial moments, they can still be useful to me."

After he had finished speaking, he made a small gesture. Immediately, a clan soldier brought forward a bamboo tube containing a secret message, which he handed to Tian Zhongqing.

"I want the Yu Family to know about the contents of this letter. Among the spies, this person's name is particularly unpleasant and he is the easiest to deceive... so let's use him... this Ma Haiji," Li Yuanxie instructed, letting out a soft chuckle.

Tian Zhongqing nodded repeatedly. Li Yuanxiu went on to explain the plan in great detail, making sure his instructions were as clear as possible.

"Make it look natural... let Ma Haiji believe he had stumbled upon this accidentally."

After carefully listening to his instructions, Tian Zhongqing quietly excused himself. Li Yuanjiao was still sitting casually at the bottom of the steps. Seeing TianZhingqing leave, he then turned to his brother.

"Brother, Yu Mugao is not easy to fool. Whether he believes it or not, Ma Haiji is likely to be discarded by the Yu Family after this... Do you have a plan for handling this?"

Li Yuanxiu nodded and smiled. "When someone comes to our house to spy on us, is there any reason for him to leave unscathed and still live a life of luxury? Once his message gets out, we'll make his life worse than death."

Picking up a writing brush, Li Yuanxiu and Li Yuanjiao exchanged a glance and smiled. Li Yuanxiu then drew a circle on the fabric sheet.

Li Yuanjiao raised an eyebrow in response and said with a cryptic expression, "Tian Zhongqing and Xu Gongming are both talents that can be utilized... The families have many members and are bound to produce a few formidable characters."

Li Yuanxiu looked down at the circle he had drawn and let out a small sigh.

"Talents that can be utilized are good enough... we don't need someone like An Jingming. Our pond is too shallow to nurture flood dragons."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Under the administration of Mount Huaqian, the four towns flourished, with Huaqian Town at the foot of the mountain being the most lively. In recent years, many courtyards had been built, and in the sparse spring rain, people wearing straw raincoats bustled about.

"The official has come to visit... Please inform Brother Zhongqing!"

Ma Haiji waited outside in the courtyard under the spring drizzle for a while until a servant creaked the door open.

"Oh, it's you, Lord Ma!

Please come," the servant said respectfully upon recognizing him at the doorway.

Ma Haiji nodded before walking into the courtyard with his hands behind his back. As he crossed the threshold, he took off his straw raincoat. There was no sign of Tian Zhongqing in the main courtyard and not even an attendant was in sight, leaving the courtyard eerily empty.

He raised an eyebrow and asked, "Where is Lord Zhongqing?"

"The lord received an urgent message early this morning and went out with his men, leaving only me to watch the house. Please wait a moment, I will bring you some tea..." the servant answered, with his head bowed meekly.

Tian Zhongqing was known for his frugality, employing only a few personal servants. Such situations were not uncommon. Ma Haiji nodded at the servant's explanation, who went to prepare the tea hurriedly.

Upon hearing the words 'urgent message', Ma Haiji's interest was piqued. He sat down on a wooden chair, eyeing the bamboo tube on the table that fluttered slightly in the wind. It piqued his own greedy thoughts as he gazed at it.

I wonder if I could get any information from this...

Ten years ago, Ma Haiji had fled to this place from the roads. He was skilled in speech and good at calculations, which earned him a position managing the granary under Tian Zhongqing.

However, he had another identity‚Äîhis real surname was Yu and he came from one of the Yu Family's branches.

His generation had fallen on hard times, but thanks to his cleverness and a recommendation, he had secured a position as a spy and infiltrated the Li Family.

His gaze lingered on the bamboo tube on the table.

Ma Haiji could hardly contain himself; he had been here for ten years, transmitting only bits and pieces of information, and was never involved in anything significant... so much so that he felt as if he were starting to forget his own surname.

"If this information is important enough, perhaps I could return home in glory, no longer needing to skulk around here..."

Truthfully, life in the Li Family was not harder than in the Yu Family. With the support of hundreds of thousands from Mount Yue, the common folk of the Li Family lived far better than those under the Yu, where although the upper echelons were wealthy, the commoners still starved.

Ma Haiji looked around before quickly approaching the table, squatting to inspect it. The wax seal on the bamboo tube had been broken, and it was empty, its contents most likely already taken away by Tian Zhongqing.

"What a pity..."

Ma Haiji sighed and sat back down before kicking his legs up. His eyes swept across the floor around him and spotted a piece of white cloth caught under the table leg, fluttering gently in the soft spring breeze.

"Hmm?"

His eyes twinkled instantly. Always quick-witted, he quickly realized what the cloth was.

"This must mean that Tian Zhongqing indeed received a very important and urgent message... He must have left the courtyard in such a hurry that he didn't secure the tube properly, and the spring breeze must have blown the message under the table!"

Ma Haiji was delighted. He peeked at it and saw that the ink had smeared across the cloth, leaving only a few legible words. "An Jingming... has broken through to the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm..."

"Your tea is here, Lord Ma!"

The call startled Ma Haiji to his core. He plopped back into his chair swiftly and took the offered tea bowl nonchalantly. However, his mind was racing with thoughts and he was eager to leave.

After the servant left, he breathed a sigh of relief and wiped his face, recalling the process and silently praising himself, "My actions were flawless... Time to leave quickly!"




# Chapter 207: The Yu Family's Reaction

Yu Mugao sat in a high position in the hall, with two peak Qi Cultivation Realm guests standing respectfully beside him. The vast hall was silent, with not a single person daring to speak. Yu Mugao's expression was slightly weary, clearly having suffered greatly during this period. His deep voice reverberated through the hall when he spoke.

"Muyuan... is there still no news from Mujian?"

The person seated below him was tall and thin. His features bore a resemblance to Yu Mugao, albeit lacking his dark and venomous demeanor. It was one of the two men who used to follow him, and they nodded and replied respectfully, "Fourth brother said he went north to seek a place to sharpen his sword's edge.... It's been several months, and there's still no sign of his return."

"Damn fool!" Yu Mugao hissed as he cursed under his breath. As annoyed as he was, he felt powerless regarding his brother's situation, who was wholly devoted to the path of the sword. He sighed softly.

"Muyuan, it's fortunate I have you to watch over things... Otherwise, with so many troubles at home, I would be driven to my grave."
ùíáùôßùôöùìÆùô¨ùôöùì´ùíèùì∏ùìøùìÆùíç.ùì¨ùô§ùì∂

"I dare not... I'm merely alleviating my big brother's worries," Yu Muyuan responded.

Just then, a person hurried up from below, holding a letter in his hands. He handed it to Yu Mugao, whispering, "Family Head, we've received a secret letter from Ma Haiji of Mount Huaqian!"

Yu Mugao raised an eyebrow, his expression darkening. He took the letter, broke the wax seal, and read the letter twice over.

His face contorted angrily at once as he gritted his teeth and exclaimed, "An Jingming... that cunning fox! I've overlooked him these days, only to find that he has reached such a level..."

He closed his eyes and pondered for a moment before handing the letter to Yu Muyuan, who took it with both hands.

After glancing at it, he was unable to contain his shock and exclaimed, "H-...How is this possible?! It's only been a few years! An Jingming has reached such a realm of cultivation..?!"

The eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm... How can this be possible? What's with that monstrous cultivation speed? Is this information from the Li Family reliable? Our family is currently on good terms with the An Family... could this be a divisive strategy to make us turn against the An Family?

Yu Mugao closed his eyes and thought deeply for a while, then shook his head. He spoke gravely. "It doesn't seem possible... The Li Family has always been reserved, and Li Tongya is not one to stir up trouble. According to the spy, acquiring this information was a near-death experience. This likely isn't a ploy by the Li Family."

Neither Li Yuanxiu nor Yu Mugao could have anticipated that Ma Haiji, in his desire to highlight his own contributions, had embellished the letter, describing the process of obtaining the information as fraught with deadly peril. Unfortunately for him, this had influenced Yu Mugao's judgment, making him more certain and decisive of the news's authenticity.

Yu Muyuan cupped his fist and said through gritted teeth, "If that's the case, this man must not be allowed to live!"

Yu Mugao's expression was ominously dark as the progress of An Jingming's cultivation had far exceeded his expectations. He sighed deeply and spoke in a low voice, "Indeed... he cannot be left alive. Our family must kill him. With his rate of cultivation, he could break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm in just a few years. There could be unforeseen consequences then... It would be best to suppress both the Li and An families together."

Yu Muyuan watched his elder brother ponder on, knowing that Yu Mugao was likely concocting some sinister plan. His brother had always been capable of outlandish and ruthless schemes and had never failed in his machinations against various figures. Hence, he remained silent, waiting patiently below.

Yu Mugao pondered only briefly before his plans took shape in his mind. He spoke softly, "The An Family has revealed the locations of the Li Family's towns and has arranged for our people to be placed there, which couldn't be better."

"I already have a plan. First, we'll strike at the Li Family to curb their influence, then catch the An Family off guard. We've allowed these two families too much freedom for too long... it's time to rein them in."

Yu Mugao smiled faintly as he spoke, clearly confident of his strategy. He then said softly, "Go fetch Master Jiang."

The servant below hurried to make arrangements, and soon, an old man with a head full of white hair was brought over. Judging by the wrinkles on his face, he was likely over one hundred and fifty years old. Yet, his cultivation was only at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Despite his weak vitality, he laughed heartily and cupped his fist.

"Head of Yu Family, it's been a long while! How many people do we need to eliminate today?"

"Master Jiang!"

Yu Mugao was exceedingly polite, clearly holding Master Jiang in high regard. He then continued with a beaming smile, "I do need your assistance to eliminate one person..."

Master Jiang sat down casually on a rosewood chair, kicking up his feet. Yu Mugao showed no sign of annoyance but instead gestured to Yu Muyuan with a smile. "Fifth Brother, I'll have to trouble you to accompany Master Jiang!"

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Ma Haiji lit a fire and carefully wrapped the letter before placing it in the flames. Watching as the paper vanished into ashes, he finally breathed a sigh of relief. He looked around, gathered his belongings, and prepared to go home.

After taking a few steps, Ma Haiji stopped in his tracks. He turned back to extinguish the fire pile and covered it with dirt, nodding to himself in reassurance. After walking several dozen steps, he suddenly felt uneasy.

He squatted to the ground and murmured to himself, "The Li Family values this message so highly, so surely, they must have their own plans... I've already relayed this message home, and Yu Mugao will surely act to disrupt it. Eventually, the Li Family will realize the message has leaked..."

"If Tian Zhongqing returns to the courtyard and sees the paper on the ground and inquires from his servants, they will surely know I was the only visitor... Wouldn't that expose me?!"

Ma Haiji was greatly shaken and extremely distressed, his expression darkening the more he thought about his predicament.

"There's no turning back now! I can never return to the Li Family... they've probably laid a trap by now, and going back would be walking into certain death."

With his bag on his back, Ma Haiji was overwhelmed with panic as he mumbled, "I can't wait for a reply from home... I need to leave now! I need to escape here and return home!"

Ma Haiji still had some sense in him left. He quickly pieced together the sequence of events, picked up his bag, and dashed into the woods. Heading north for the duration of the time it took to burn an incense stick, his body was thoroughly scratched by branches and thorns.

Unexpectedly, a figure suddenly landed before him, interrupting his escape.

The man, dressed in a plain gray robe with a sword at his waist, exuded a dignified demeanor. His eyes fixed on Ma Haiji as he smiled and asked, "Where do you intend to go?"

Ma Haiji was terrified, his legs beginning to shake uncontrollably.

"Who are you..?!" he cried out.

"I am Chen Donghe!"

Chen Donghe smiled slightly, glancing at Ma Haiji and saying softly, "You're quite perceptive... Had we not been waiting here already, you might have indeed escaped."

"Chen Donghe... a Qi Cultivator!"

Having been with the Li Family for many years, though only as an ordinary official, Ma Haiji knew well of Chen Donghe's reputation. He drew a dagger from his waist and slashed his own throat.

However, Ma Haiji was merely a mortal. With a flick of his finger, Chen Donghe effortlessly knocked the dagger in Ma Haiji's hand with a forceful blow, sending it flying out of his grasp and landing by the riverbank. Then, with a wave of his hand, Ma Haiji collapsed to the ground, completely limp.

Chen Donghe looked at Ma Haiji with a slight pang of pity for the helpless man before picking him up. He took to the winds right away, heading toward Mount Lijing in the west.




# Chapter 208: Enmity

Mount Yue, entrenched in the land of Wu and Yue States, boasted its own customs and had a scattered population numbering over ten million.

North of Mount Li, a vein of more than a million people found refuge under the protection of the Duanmu Kui. With the demise of Duanmu Kui, Mount Wu's disciples scattered far and wide, some fleeing while others sought refuge in various sects. The territory once controlled by Duanmu Kui was now divided among his four disciples, each imposing their authority, constructing palaces amid a scene of turmoil.

Deep within the northern vein, a monstrous beast dwelled in a deep cave amid the forest. Its mouth bristled with sharp teeth and its body was covered with yellowish scales. Its two brown eyes‚Äîeach the size of a human head, stared lifelessly into the air.

"Finally, we've slain this beast!" Xiao Chuchou sighed, feeling a sense of relief wash over him as he accepted a pill from Xiao Yuansi. Swiftly swallowing it, he felt an immediate sense of reassurance and renewed strength overwhelm his body.

He let out a soft sigh and chuckled before saying, "My lifespan is dwindling and my qi is weakening. Not only has my cultivation stagnated, I don't even move like I used to! To think how heroic I was when I traversed the north... dominating the lands of Jin and Zhao States! Now, in the blink of an eye, I've become an old man..."

Xiao Yuansi looked at the old man with concern, hesitating slightly before finally speaking.

"Old Ancestor, you... you may want to consider trying the blood sacrifice ritual passed down from the sect... It could prolong your life by a few more years and alleviate your physical discomfort."

Xiao Chuchou sneered in response.

"No thanks. When my father fought with Chi Wei and ultimately became a sacrifice for him, I made a vow in my youth... I will never condone any sacrificial rituals."

"Chi Wei... He's truly the devil's spawn," Xiao Yuansi muttered resentfully as deep-seated hatred seeped from his usual gentle demeanor.

Xiao Chuchou was taken aback by his sudden change in demeanor. He hesitated before continuing, "I know you resent him, but the war between the immortals and the devils has passed. The line between good and evil has become blurred... Chi Wei is indeed a villain, but hardly a devil's spawn."

"What goodness does he possess?" Xiao Yuansi exclaimed indignantly, unaware of the conflicted look in Xiao Chuchou's eyes.

"More than a hundred and fifty years ago, when I was but an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator, the Demon King at the southern border invaded. Millions faced imminent doom... and while the three sects and seven gates watched from afar, it was Chi Wei and a few others‚Äîwho had just attained the Purple Mansion Realm‚Äîthat intervened. They risked their lives to coerce the ancestors of the Azure Pond Sect and others to take action, ultimately saving the day. Chi Wei sacrificed his lifespan during that battle and severely damaged his cultivation foundation. Had it not been for his sacrifice, he wouldn't still be struggling to break through to the Golden Core Realm even now... Simply put, the Xiao Family and half of Yue State owe him our lives," Xiao Chuchou revealed.

"What..." Xiao Yuansi spluttered, shocked by this sudden revelation.

Xiao Yuansi had only vaguely heard about a demonic rebellion that had happened more than a hundred years ago, but the details eluded him. Hearing Xiao Chuchou's revelation was like a bolt from the blue, leaving his mind reeling with shock and disbelief.

"How can that be..?!" he exclaimed in denial.

As they ventured deeper into the cave, Xiao Chuchou sighed and continued, "Who hasn't dreamed of saving the world and rescuing those in need when they were young? But after decades of stagnation in cultivation, practicing tirelessly day and night with no progress, cultivation itself can become a burden. With all your efforts over the past hundreds of years on the verge of fading away and enemies lurking in the dark, waiting eagerly for your downfall to strike at your descendants and disciples, if you only need to sacrifice a few lives to break through... will you choose to do it?"

Xiao Chuchou's gaze held a mix of emotions, his aged features contorting with pain as he regarded the bewildered Xiao Yuansi.

"To kill is to protect your family and ensure the safety of loved ones... To refrain from killing is to leave yourself vulnerable, risking the slaughter of those dear to us. How many can bear such a burden? Whether it's killing one life or ten thousand, the act remains the same. Once the seed of evil is sown, it's difficult to contain. Chi Wei may have eaten your junior brother, but it's not possible to determine and judge if he's good or evil. While he may have eaten a few talented disciples, he has ultimately saved millions in Yue State."

"Furthermore, with Chi Wei's demise, the Azure Pond Sect will teeter on the brink of collapse. That family your junior brother is born into may be able to call it a day and return home... Yet, the Chi Family..."

While Xiao Chuchou was still talking, Xiao Yuansi could not take it any longer. He finally raised his head, his voice tinged with desperation.

"Old Ancestor, how can the world be so twisted? If good and evil are indistinguishable, and if everyone is a mix of both... where do we find our footing in this world?"

Xiao Chuchou nodded in agreement, his voice barely above a whisper as he remarked, "Immortals under the sun are inherently a blend of good and evil, true purity is a myth. The line between good and evil has blurred ever since the war between the immortals and devils ended. Only enmity remains..."

Xiao Yuansi fell silent for a few breaths before letting out a deep sigh. He found it difficult to calm down. He had joined Qingsui Peak when he was young, where Si Yuanbai had taught him the distinction between good and evil.

Chi Wei had reversed all that he knew, and now Xiao Chuchou's words had shaken him deeply. His emotions churned, causing a divine light to burst forth from his immortal foundation‚Äîthe Vermillion Sage. It appeared that it had been enhanced.

"Only enmity remains..."

As the two conversed, they finally arrived in an empty cave that was devoid of all light. Cultivators of the Foundation Establishment Realm naturally were not troubled by such darkness.

Xiao Yuansi glanced around him, his eyes falling upon a cluster of large yellow flowers blooming in the depths of the cave. A group of stamens curled up, with a drop of glistening dew gathering at the ends of them, emitting a fragrant aroma.

"It's a valuable medicine‚ÄîNine-Stamen Spirit Daylily."

While Xiao Chuchou was still struggling to identify the strange flower, Xiao Yuansi recognized it instantly, having been immersed in the alchemy for many years. Xiao Chuchou nodded in realization and chuckled.

"Even if we don't find any relics here, obtaining this precious herb alone already makes the journey worthwhile."

For cultivators in the Purple Mansion Realm, ordinary spirit items were no longer effective to them. Only the precious medicines that had been nurtured by the essence of heaven and earth could work wonders for them.

Satisfied with their find, Xiao Yuansi flicked his sleeve. Mana surged through his hand but it was without the expected luster of a spell.

"Old Ancestor, please be careful... This flower is sensitive to light."

Xiao Yuansi retrieved a dharma medicine pouch and carefully stowed away the flower. Xiao Chuchou observed the string of medicine pouches draped over Xiao Yuansi's body and chuckled.

"Always prepared, aren't you?"

Xiao Yuansi smiled wryly. Dharma medicine pouches and qi collection bottles like these possessed inner space and could not be stored within storage pouches. Despite this inconvenience, Xiao Yuansi still carried them around with him.

After collecting the Nine-Stamen Spirit Daylily, the two exited the cave and buried the demonic beasts on the ground.
ùìØùôßùìÆùìÆùíòùìÆùôóùô£ùíêùíóùíÜùìµ.ùì¨ùì∏ùíé

Xiao Chuchou performed a few Spirit Sealing Techniques, then spoke again, "With the current situation of our Xiao Family, the Li Family on Moongaze Lake could provide a breakthrough, securing the west side for our family. Moongaze Lake, backed by Mount Dali, is an advantageous location... Even if Chi Wei dies, the Azure Pond Sect likely won't relinquish control of Moongaze Lake. Given the relationship between our families, using the Li Family as a barrier seems most appropriate."

Xiao Yuansi, his head lowered as he cast spells, nodded in agreement.

"That's good, I've heard that Yongling gets along quite well with Li Tongya... Ruyu and Li Xuanfeng are also friends."

Seeing that Xiao Chuchou and the other ancestors in his family had no plans to expand westward, relief washed over Xiao Yuansi. After all, he had promised Li Chejing that he would look after the Li Family.

He then spoke in a deep voice, "Li Mutian, the ancestor of the Li Family, used to be a farmer before he became a rogue cultivator, eventually attaining the Foundation Establishment Realm. He must be a remarkable individual, and his offspring are likely no less remarkable. Li Tongya, while not exceptionally talented, possesses a good heart. Li Chejing must have inherited his father's talent in swordsmanship... But I have never heard much about Li Mutian. He didn't seem to be famous in the Yue State."

Xiao Chuchou was listening intently to him but suddenly frowned and asked, "Do all four of Li Mutian's sons have a spiritual orifice?"

Unaware of the intent behind the old man's question, Xiao Yuansi pondered for a moment before replying, "The eldest son passed away when he was very young, but the remaining three sons all have spiritual orifices."

Xiao Chuchou raised an eyebrow, the wrinkles on his aged face gathering as he continued, "Oh? And what about their Xuan generation?"

After a moment's recollection, Xiao Yuansi replied slowly, his voice thick with uncertainty.

"There are three boys and one girl... All three sons possess spiritual orifices."

Xiao Chuchou picked up the tail of a spirit beast and flipped its carcass over before storing it in his storage pouch.

"The Yuan generation comes after the Xuan generation, right?"

Xiao Yuansi nodded and replied, "Yes, but I don't know much about those in the Yuan generation... There are more of them. I only know that three of them possess a spiritual orifice."

Xiao Chuchou nodded, feeling a bit reassured. He waved his hand solemnly and commented, "Li Mutian is undoubtedly remarkable. I would not be surprised if he had consumed some extraordinary heavenly treasures at some point. The bloodline of the Li Family doesn't seem like that of an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... it's more akin to that of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator!"

"Oh?!"

Xiao Yuansi was taken aback by this perspective, impressed by the depth of knowledge his old ancestor possessed.

During the decline of the Xiao Family, Xiao Chuchou was only a peak Qi cultivator. He left all the family's treasures and the Essence Gathering Pills to Xiao Chuting and ventured out on his own to seek opportunities. Because of this, he had gained extensive knowledge.

Xiao Yuansi recalled the demeanors of both Li Tongya and Li Xiangping, then nodded thoughtfully and replied, "Indeed... that could be the case."

As the two soared through the sky toward the Li Residence, Xiao Chuchou suddenly smiled and whispered, "I have an idea. Since the Li Family's lineage is exceptional, the Xiao Family could consider marriage with them. This would not only solidify the relationship between our families but also potentially produce a prodigious talent! If the Li Family can unify Moongaze Lake, our family could not only use them as a barrier but also form an alliance with them. After all, we're dependent on each other."

Xiao Yuansi nodded, smiling warmly as he responded, "Old Ancestor, the union you're suggesting is akin to that of the Ning and Chi families within the Azure Pond Sect. They complemented each other and monopolized the Azure Pond..."

"Our families don't need to be that close," Xiao Chuchou interjected, shaking his head. "It's good for the families to get along with each other. However, a union too close risks mutual usurpation. A mutually beneficial relationship, bound by the master-disciple ties, is adequate."

"I understand," Xiao Yuansi affirmed.

As they conversed, Mount Lijing appeared on the horizon. The foot of the mountain was lively, and the morning sunlight cast a gentle glow upon the majestic golden formation, creating a scene akin to that of a fairyland.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Tongya examined the jade boxes on the desk carefully, inspecting each one carefully before stacking them up, shaking his head with a tinge of regret.

"These spirit items from Mount Yue are potent even for those in the Qi Cultivation Realm. However, without the proper elixir or pill formula, ingesting them directly not only diminishes their effectiveness but also poses harm, making future breakthroughs increasingly challenging."

Spirit items, while effective, also carried impurities that could cause adverse effects. Pill crafting involved the careful refinement of these substances to minimize their adverse impacts and maximize their efficacy.

Passing the jade boxes to Li Xuanxuan, Li Tongya suddenly recalled something and asked, "Is Qiuyang still struggling to make a breakthrough?"

Li Xuanxuan nodded, equally as perplexed.

"I've spoken with Qiuyang, and indeed... he's still struggling. It's puzzling! Considering Qiuyang's talent compared to Donghe's back then, he shouldn't be in such a state..."

After thinking for a while, Li Tongya finally recalled a distant memory. Realization dawned upon him as he asked, "Do you remember the Snake Dragon Tree at home?"

"Of course," Li Xuanxuan replied as he nodded slowly. The Snake Dragon Tree could be considered the Li Family's most prized possession after the mirror and the Qingche Sword.

It bore a Snake Dragon Fruit once every five years, which Xiao Yuansi would then refine into pills. Many in the family relied on these Snake Dragon Pills to achieve breakthroughs in their cultivation.

Li Tongya shook his head, recounting an old tale in a warm tone, "Back then, we were able to discover this precious tree all thanks to Qiuyang... The child seemed blessed. He ventured into the mountains and accidentally consumed a Snake Dragon Fruit when he was young. Luckily, the fruit's mild nature only rendered him unconscious for several days. Afterward, the speed of his cultivation was extraordinary. Within just a year, he had managed to condense the Profound Scenery Chakra."

Li Xuanxuan listened intently to the story.

Li Tongya sighed, continuing, "At the time, we all thought it was Qiuyang's good fortune. Little did we know that fortune and misfortune walk hand in hand. His rapid cultivation, fueled by reckless ingestion of the spirit fruit without proper cultivation, left him with underlying issues... Now, he struggles to advance beyond the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."

Realization dawned upon Li Xuanxuan as he nodded. Li Tongya picked up the tea bowl from the table and continued, "Among all the mountains under our family's control, the spiritual qi of the spirit spring on Mount Huaqian flows the thickest. Explain to Qiuyang about his situation, then send him to Mountain Huaqian to cultivate."

"Understood," Li Xuanxuan replied respectfully. As he raised his head, an abrupt buzz emanated from the grand formation, and an elderly voice came through.

"Xiao Chuchou from the Xiao Family has come to visit... Please open the formation, Tongya, my friend."

Li Tongya quickly opened the formation and soared into the sky. Xiao Chuchou and Xiao Yuansi landed atop the mountain with a smile on their faces.

"Greetings, Seniors!" Li Tongya greeted respectfully as he cupped his fist.

"As courteous as ever, Tongya..." Xiao Chuchou remarked with a smile as he followed Li Tongya into the courtyard.

Seated alongside Xiao Yuansi, he accepted the tea that was offered to him. They exchanged a few pleasantries before shifting the conversation to the purpose of his visit.

"Your house's grand formation is ingeniously crafted. I've traversed north and south and have some knowledge of formations... This one is particularly notable," Xiao Chuchou remarked.

"It was set up by Master Liu Changdie," Li Tongya replied, causing Xiao Yuansi to raise his eyebrow at the mention of the name.

"I've seen this Liu Changdie before," Xiao Yuansi chimed in warmly, "He's quite an interesting person... Very skillful in formations and speaks as if he's been around for nearly a century. He seems to know many people."

Xiao Chuchou seemed uninterested in this topic and redirected the discussion. He scrutinized Li Tongya briefly before asking, "How confident are you in building your Dao foundation, Tongya?"

"I haven't completed my Qi Cultivation yet, so I'm uncertain," Li Tongya responded respectfully.

Xiao Chuchou nodded, sharing some crucial insights on laying the Dao foundation. Li Tongya, who had largely relied on himself throughout his cultivation journey, was naturally thrilled to receive such valuable guidance. He absorbed the advice diligently, carefully noting down every wisdom Xiao Chuchou imparted to him mentally.

Xiao Yuansi listened and interjected occasionally, adding his insights.

After receiving their guidance, Li Tongya quickly expressed his gratitude.

Xiao Chuchou smiled and waved his hand, his gaze intense and piercing as he addressed Li Tongya directly.

"Tongya, I'm sure you're also quite informed about my family's affairs!"




# Chapter 210: Departure of Guests

Xiao Chuchou's words were gentle, yet they struck a chord of dismay in Li Tongya's heart, setting his mind ablaze with swirling thoughts.

As he gazed upon the old man's smiling countenance, he responded respectfully, "Through the years of our families' dealings, I've certainly gleaned some understanding of your family's situation. Ancestor Chuting has indeed extended kindness toward me, for which I remain deeply grateful."

Xiao Chuchou noticed the subtle implication in Li Tongya's words with his vague reference to their ancestor, Xiao Chuting. He simply nodded once and murmured softly, "In that case, there's no need for further elaboration. Our two families have long relied on each other... Should you attain the Foundation Establishment Realm in the future, do send word to my Xiao Family. We can then discuss arrangements for a union between our families for mutual support."

Xiao Chuchou was direct with his intention, and Li Tongya was a level-headed man and was deeply grateful to Xiao Chuting. Not only that, he was also the elder brother of Li Chejing and maintained good relations with Xiao Yongling. Over the years, correspondence between the families had solidified the Xiao Family's trust in him.

For Li Tongya, attaining the Foundation Establishment Realm would mean securing the support of the Xiao Family for the Li Family. Conversely, if he failed to achieve this milestone and perished, the relations between the two families would remain connected to the personal relationships between Xiao Yuansi and Li Chejing.

Li Tongya listened intently, his heart swelling with joy at the realization. Pragmatic by nature, he did not allow himself to dwell on the bluntness of Xiao Chuchou's words.

Instead, he silently reflected.

Xiao Family presently has Xiao Chuting, a Purple Mansion Realm Cultivator, and Xiao Chuchou, who is at the middle-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. Additionally, there are three other cultivators at the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm and five at the early middle-stage Foundation Establishment Realm... Undoubtedly, they stand as a prominent family, rivaled only by the Yu Family of Linghai Prefecture, the Chen Family of Yuyang Prefecture, and a few others.

Even if the Xiao Family were to soon sever ties with the Azure Pond Sect and ascend to the status of the Purple Mansion Immortal Clan, they wouldn't be able to override the Azure Pond and intervene in Moongaze Lake's affairs. Nevertheless, their support would remain invaluable.

Moreover, the Xiao Family relies on our family to serve as a defensive wall on Moongaze Lake, facilitating the distribution of pills and dharma artifacts... Such mutual dependence fosters a symbiotic relationship between our families, naturally ensuring mutual benefit.

Li Tongya cupped his fist with a solemn expression, knowing full well of the Xiao Family's plans.

"I am grateful for the esteemed ancestor's faith in us! The Li Family will definitely serve as a barrier for your clan and safeguard the Moongaze Lake."

Xiao Chuchou chuckled, nodding vigorously as he helped Li Tongya to his feet, warmly clasping his hand. His aged voice echoed in the courtyard as he spoke gently.

"What are you saying? We're just looking out for each other."

After another brief exchange of pleasantries, Li Tongya and Xiao Chuchou returned to their seats and continued their conversation, touching upon recent events with increasingly composed tones.

As the conversation lingered and Li Tongya sensed the guests' impending departure, he quickly sent out a voice transmission through his mana. When Li Xuanxuan received the message, who was waiting outside the door, he entered the courtyard right away and presented four jade boxes.

"Here are four spirit items from our family... I humbly request the Senior's discerning eye to inspect them," Li Tongya said politely.

Xiao Yuansi set down his tea bowl. With his adept cultivation in alchemy, he swiftly examined the jade boxes, discerning their contents with ease before speaking.

"These four spirit items are common ingredients of the Qi Cultivation Realm. With my current knowledge in pill crafting, three of them can serve as supplementary ingredients and one as a main. If you trust me, you may consider selling the supplementary ingredient to my family, and as for the main ingredient, I can refine it into pills. We can split the proceeds as usual, and I'll arrange for its delivery to your residence upon completion," he offered.

Li Tongya was anticipating this offer from Xiao Yuansi. He quickly cupped his fist and bowed his head slightly.

"Then I'll take you up on that offer, Senior!"

Handing over the four jade boxes to Xiao Yuansi, Li Tongya listened attentively as Xiao Yuansi detailed the utility and value of each spirit herb. Upon receiving twenty Spirit Stones as payment for the three supplementary ingredients, they conversed a little more before the guests from the Xiao Family were ready to take their leave.

The two men bid farewell to Li Tongya and left the mountain's formation. After soaring through the skies for hours, Xiao Chuchou finally broke the silence.

"Yuansi, Rulian is already nineteen... How about arranging her marriage into the Li Family?"

Xiao Yuansi considered for a moment before replying, "I'm afraid she's not the right candidate. If we were to arrange a marriage with the Li Family, the groom should be someone from their generation of Yuan. Rulian belongs to the same generation as the generation of Xuan, and all the boys from that family already have spouses. It's not appropriate for her to marry into the Yuan generation... We should consider someone from the generation of Gui on our side instead."

Xiao Chuchou nodded thoughtfully, seeing the logic in his words.

"Then Guiluan it shall be... She's still young. By the time Li Tongya attains the Foundation Establishment Realm, it'll be the right time for her to wed."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Pingyi, now sporting a thick mustache on his upper lip which served as a symbol of his prime years, strode into the courtyard. He nodded toward his wife, who came over to greet him.

"You've finally returned, my dear... We've been looking for you. Auntie has been waiting for quite some time," his wife said with a small smile.

Upon hearing his wife's words, Li Pingyi hastened into the house where he found Li Feiruo seated with a smile. She had shed the elegant attire of Mount Yue for the plain dress of the Easterners.

She greeted him warmly, "Seems like you've been really busy, Yi'er... It's really hard to catch even just a glimpse of you."

Li Pingyi smiled awkwardly in response and replied, "I've already discussed the matter you mentioned with the Young Family Head, Auntie."

"Âì¶?"

"Oh?" Li Feiruo perked up instantly, listening intently.

Li Pingyi continued, "Since you're aware of the matter on Mount Yue, the Young Family Head has decided to send you to Lichuankou in the west upon careful consideration... You'll manage the town, negotiate with Mount Yue, and regulate the influx of refugees across the border. He believes that this task suits you best, and within three days, you'll receive formal instructions to move."

Li Feiruo was delighted by the news.

"Excellent! I'm truly grateful for the family's trust, I won't let them down!" she beamed.

Li Feiruo had demonstrated boldness since her teenage years in Mount Yue and had a natural aptitude for management. Now presented with such an opportunity, she was more than eager to settle into her new role.

After conversing for a while, Li Pingyi was approached by a discreet clan soldier who whispered a few words in his ear.

"My lord, there's news from the mine. A precious pearl has been unearthed from the cave, and Lord Xu retrieved it clandestinely."

Li Pingyi raised his eyebrow in surprise, and as Li Feiruo noticed this change in his expression, she tactfully excused herself.

Li Pingyi courteously saw her off then turned his head around and exclaimed, "I wouldn't be surprised if Xu Gongming cannot discern a spirit item... But how can a cultivator at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm not recognize such a precious item?!"

The clan soldier simply shook his head with a small shrug of his shoulders.

"Lord Xu only mentioned that the pearl emanated an immense aura, far surpassing that of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."

"Where's the item now?" Li Pingyi asked.
ùëìùëüùëíùò¶ùìåùëíùëèùëõùëúùò∑ùëíùò≠.ùí∏ùò∞ùëö

"Lord Xu is waiting outside the courtyard, and he brought the precious pearl along with him," the clan soldier replied.

"Excellent. Come with me to see the Young Family Head."

Li Pingyi led the clan soldier out of the courtyard as the main courtyard was adjacent to the side courtyard where they had been. After a brief walk along the stone path, they reached the main courtyard.

Taking the wooden box from Xu Gongming, Li Pingyi proceeded alone through the front hall and the middle hall. He eventually reached Li Yuanxiu, who was deeply engrossed in reading a wooden slip in his seat.

"Young Family Head."

Li Pingyi presented the wooden box with reverence, explaining the situation in detail. Li Yuanxiu listened attentively, and once he had finished, he gave a simple instruction.

"Open it up, let me take a look."

Li Pingyi complied, opening the box and taking out a dark and translucent treasure pearl, which was roughly the size of a fist.

Li Yuanxiu reached out to grasp it, feeling a slight tingling sensation in his hand upon contact. He examined it closely but found no discernible clues.

Raising an eyebrow, he remarked, "It seems to be a spirit item of the Qi Cultivation Realm... Uncle Qiuyang and Uncle Donghe are away on Mount Huaqian, and I'm not sure if Father and the rest are in seclusion right now..."

"I know that the senior at Foundation Establishment Realm from the Xiao Family came to visit this morning and just left not too long ago, so I'm guessing Granduncle isn't in seclusion."

Li Yuanxiu held up the precious pearl and instructed, "Send this spirit item to Granduncle later and have him take a look at it."




# Chapter 211: Thunder Pearl

"Right here?"

Yu Muyuan landed on the small island in the lake, dressed in a gray cloak. Even though they were in a remote area, Yu Muyuan remained cautious. He ensured that he was tightly covered, wary of any passerby who might inadvertently stumble upon them.

Standing behind him was a gray-robed old man, a grin plastered on his face as they landed together on the small island.

Yu Muyuan respectfully cupped his fists and asked, "Master Jiang, is this far enough?"

"Yes, it is!"

Master Jiang chuckled as he tapped his Shengyang Mansion, closing his eyes and kneeling on the ground.

Yu Muyuan stood beside him, asking, "The An Family has discreetly sent the item into the mine and the Li Family has discovered it... Master Jiang, how potent is this spell?"

With his eyes tightly shut, Master Jiang appeared to be spiritually traversing the realm as he searched for something intently.

"The physical bodies of immortal cultivators are fragile... Your elder brother is the one who taught me this spell that could easily catch anyone off guard. It can swiftly incapacitate even a Qi Cultivator unless they have established their immortal foundation. Coupled with my curse, it will not only damage their root foundation but also inflict harm upon their vital qi. Even if they're saved, their future prospects are bleak," he replied.

Though Yu Muyuan had heard of Master Jiang's abilities before, he could not help but feel creeped out upon hearing his explanation.

"What a truly insidious spell that leaves no room for defense..." he said.

Master Jiang let out a hearty laugh and then said, "I'm not surprised to hear that from you... I've traveled far and wide, but your elder brother is the most sinister person I've ever encountered."

Yu Muyuan raised an eyebrow at him and was about to respond, but was stopped by the smile on Master Jiang's wrinkled face.

"Don't even try to intimidate me... I'm not afraid if you report this to your elder brother. Even if I call him sinister, he would take it as a compliment," Master Jiang said with the same crooked grin.

Before Yu Muyuan could react, Master Jiang exclaimed, "I've found it! The Thunder Pearl is currently in the hands of a leader... Ah, it seems to be the Young Family Head of the Li Family, a cultivator at the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm... He's most likely Li Yuanxiu. They're about to transfer it to Li Tongya's hands."

Yu Muyuan was taken aback before skeptically saying, "Why would the Li Family entrust the family's leadership to an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator..?"

Master Jiang simply snorted in response.

"The Li Family isn't as powerful as your Yu Family, where Qi Cultivators are plentiful..."

But before Master Jiang could finish his sentence, Yu Muyuan's expression turned serious as he interrupted him with an important question.

"How long can you sustain this technique?"

Master Jiang was slightly caught off guard by the question but mumbled, "Two hours..."

What he did not expect was the determined expression on Yu Muyuan's face as he instructed, "Do it now!"

"What?!"

Master Jiang gave him a confused look as he asked slowly, "Why bother with a mere Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator..? Why not wait a little more to catch something bigger, Young Master? Forget about Li Xuanfeng and Li Xuanling, the Thunder Pearl is already on its way to Li Tongya... Once it's in his hands, we'll injure him, dashing any hopes of him attaining the Foundation Establishment Realm! Won't that be wonderful?"

"Are you trying to get my family in trouble, Master Jiang?!" Yu Muyuan's countenance darkened with irritation and anger as he exclaimed, "Have you considered the relationship between Li Xuanfeng, Li Yuanxiu, Li Tongya, and Li Chejing?! There's a chance Li Chejing may overlook it if a few of the younger generations in the Li Family were killed, however, if Li Tongya‚Äîhis own brother‚Äîwere killed, he'd definitely come back all the way from the southern border! It takes only a Clarity Talisman to expose us, and when he discovers the truth, the Yu Family will be as good as dead!"

Realization finally dawned upon Master Jiang. Yu Muyuan grabbed him roughly and demanded loudly, "So, do it now! Li Yuanxiu is good enough! No more delays; if something goes awry and delays our plans, neither of us can bear the consequences!"

"Of course, of course!"
ùòßùìá‚ÑØùëíùìåùëíùëèùìÉùò∞ùò∑ùò¶ùò≠.ùí∏‚Ñ¥ùìÇ

Although Master Jiang's cultivation was modest, his seniority was considerable. Being chastised by his junior left him with a somewhat sour expression, but nevertheless, he performed a hand seal with both hands and thrust both fingers forward.

"Release!"

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Li Yuanxiu carefully stowed away the wooden slip in his hand, issuing a few commands before gesturing for Li Pingyi to hand over the wooden box. As Li Pingyi promptly handed it over, Li Yuanxiu delicately placed the precious pearl inside.

Feeling the slight tingling sensation in his hand, he suddenly recalled something. He picked up the wooden slip from the table and handed it to Li Pingyi, who accepted it and exited the room.

"Yuanyun enjoys history books. I got one this for..."

Before he could finish his sentence, Li Yuanxiu suddenly heard a faint voice that belonged to an old man.

"Release!"

In an instant, the jade pearl inside the wooden box beside him flashed brightly. A surge of majestic energy burst forth and erupted with the might of a volcano, catching Li Yuanxiu completely off guard.

Before he could even react, thunder flames blazed out and engulfed his whole body, tearing through his flesh and bone, and causing blood to splatter everywhere.

BOOM!

With a deafening roar, the entire hall shook violently, engulfed in billowing smoke.

Although Li Pingyi was a mortal and was a good distance away from the rear hall, the mana shockwave broke several of his bones, sending him rolling like a gourd over a long distance. Two thunder flames landed on both his arms, blowing them to smithereens and splattering out a ground of blood. He merely grunted before fainting, all in just a matter of moments.

"WHO?!"

As the dark purple thunder flame blew the rear hall into pieces, a curse aura synonymous with the Qi Cultivation Realm spread through the town, causing the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation to buzz.

Li Tongya, who had just seen the two guests from the Xiao Family off and was about to enter seclusion, soared into the sky in shock and anger before landing in the courtyard. Several stone doors on the back mountain also opened, a few practicing Qi Cultivators coming out from their seclusion with frowns on their faces.

"Who dares to ambush Mount Lijing?!"

Li Xuanxuan soared into the air. Li Xuanfeng furrowed his brow in displeasure as he swiftly entered the stone chamber and retrieved the mirror.

With a gentle stroke on its cool mirror surface, the vast territory unfolded in his mind, revealing the events transpiring at the foot of the mountain. With anger burning in his heart, his steely gaze followed the qi trail into the distance, spotting two figures in gray robes watching from the lake.

"Bastards, you have quite the audacity!" he spat.

With a swift motion, Li Xuanfeng retrieved his Golden Age Longbow. He took a step forward, his mana surging as he drew the bowstring and unleashed a bright golden arrow that glimmered impressively.

Unfortunately, the exertion proved too much for his body, and he coughed up black blood. He wiped the corner of his mouth with an icy expression as he aimed at his enemies in the distance with the mirror's help, before letting loose another mana-charged arrow.

Li Tongya, who was at the foot of the mountain, looked up suddenly as if he had sensed something and sure enough, spotted a golden light soaring into the air.

Although Li Tongya's spiritual sense could not extend far enough to pinpoint the enemy's location, he knew that Li Xuanfeng had detected their presence with the help of the mirror.

As Li Tongya propelled himself into the air, chasing after the arrow, his initial fury gave way to caution.

"Could this be a trap..?"

He gritted his teeth and with firm resolve, decided to continue flying in pursuit behind the arrow. However, he was ready to retreat at any time if necessary.

"The enemy doesn't know about the mirror's ability, so they're likely defenseless... Regardless, I must proceed with caution. The families by the lake wouldn't dare harm me for the time being..."




# Chapter 212: Muyuan

Master Jiang was still scanning the surroundings, oblivious to the distant golden light that was headed directly toward him. He took a few steps backward but as soon as he performed another hand seal, a searing pain shot through his abdomen.

The golden arrow had found its mark, causing him to let out a cry of agony. At the same time, he realized that he had been discovered.

"Young master, help me!" he called out, desperation lacing his voice.

Master Jiang, a cultivator only at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, lacked real combat experience as he had devoted his whole life to mastering curse spells specialized in ambushing opponents.

The arrow had pierced deep into his abdomen, sapping his vital qi. The Astral Qi in Li Xuanfeng's powerful attack surged in him painfully, leaving Master Jiang unable to ride the winds for escape.

Beside him, Yu Muyuan paled, gripped by fear. Hearing Master Jiang's cries, he exclaimed, "How is this possible?! We're so far away! Does Li Xuanfeng have some sort of divine ability?!"

Despite his shock, Yu Muyuan moved fast and struck Master Jiang's Shenyang Mansion without any hesitation. Master Jiang's eyes immediately turned bloodshot and blood came spewing out from all the seven orifices of his body.

The Shenyang Mansion was where the soul resided. Master Jiang was already sweating profusely and paralyzed by the pain and upon being struck by Yu Muyuan, he immediately turned limp and collapsed onto the floor like a dead pig.

Yu Muyuan's mind raced as he spoke, already formulating his next moves. He swiftly removed Master Jiang's storage pouches before disfiguring the man's face beyond recognition with a fire spell. Then, he slapped several Wind Movement Talismans onto Master Jiang's body, sending him away like a leaf caught in a gust of wind.

After doing all that, he used his talismans without holding back, hiding inside layers and layers of shields before activating a dharma artifact‚Äîa spirit shield.

Yu Muyuan discarded the two storage pouches into the lake, committing their location to memory before he vanished into the distance.

In the next moment, a second burst of golden light glinted in the sky, accompanied by a middle-aged swordsman who was flying right behind it.

Yu Muyuan's heart sank as terror gripped him.

"Not again! And Li Tongya..! M-My... fate is sealed!" he cried out in fear, almost whimpering

Li Tongya had always been perceptive. With just a glance at Master Jiang's body flying in the sky, he could tell that it was a diversion tactic. His gaze swiftly honed in on Yu Muyuan, who was making a hasty retreat.

Yu Muyuan was always cautious in his actions. The robe he wore could conceal his spiritual sense, making it difficult for Li Tongya to discern his true strength and real identity. Yet, Li Tongya could tell from this person's behavior and movements that he was extremely afraid of him.

"Bastard... have a taste of my blade!" Li Tongya roared, unsheathing his sword and sending a white-colored Celestial Moon Sword arc.

BOOM!

Yu Muyuan had conjured a small floating golden shield from what seemed to be a remarkable dharma artifact of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

It was as expected of a prominent family; despite being an insignificant descendant of the Yu Family, Yu Muyuan possessed a dharma artifact that was superior to Li Tongya's own.

Li Tongya had gotten the dharma sword in his hand from a woman from the Wu Family. As it clashed against Yu Muyuan's shield, the force of the impact sent the shield flying backward, its light dimming amidst the powerful reverberations that echoed through the air.

Undeterred, Yu Muyuan channeled more mana into the shield, striving to withstand the relentless assault.

Unfortunately for Yu Muyuan though, Li Tongya had grown significantly stronger. With another powerful sword slash, he broke Yu Muyuan's dharma artifact into two, which was swiftly followed by yet another strike that pierced through the many layers of shields Yu Muyuan had conjured with a barrage of talismans. Li Tongya's third strike was aimed directly at Yu Muyuan's chest.

Yu Muyuan hastily performed a hand seal, attempting to defend himself in futility. However, before he could complete it, the golden light had already pierced through his abdomen, disrupting his spellcasting.

Now coughing up blood, Yu Muyuan felt another chilling sensation spread through his chest as Li Tongya's sword aura penetrated deeply into his flesh and bone. Shocked by Li Tongya's strength, Yu Muyuan struggled to catch his breath.

With the Law of Celestial Moon, Li Tongya was no longer the man who could only rely on the initial stance of the Celestial Moon Slash technique and the sword arc released by it to overpower his opponents.

Within moments, Yu Muyuan, despite being in the middle stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, realized he was on the brink of defeat. Fortunately, he had prepared for this and kept a piece of white talisman on him. After a moment of activation, a radiant golden glow finally enveloped him.

"A talisman of the Foundation Establishment Realm?!"

Although Li Tongya could have risked decapitating Yu Muyuan with his sword, he deemed it unwise as he was unsure of the talisman's capabilities. Unwilling to risk his life yet hoping to capture Yu Muyuan alive, Li Tongya unleashed one last move with his sword before withdrawing.

The sharp blade drew blood this time, causing Yu Muyuan to grunt in pain.

However, to his surprise, the gray-robed man did not use the talisman to attack Li Tongya. With one decisive motion, he slapped the talisman onto his own head.

BOOM!

A brilliant golden light erupted above Moongaze Lake, engulfing Yu Muyuan in a fiery blaze. Mana fluctuations surged and flickered across the lake's surface for a fleeting moment before dissipating.
ùìØùôßùìÆùìÆùíòùìÆùôóùô£ùíêùíóùíÜùìµ.ùì¨ùì∏ùíé

Stumbling backward to avoid the burst of fire, Li Tongya's expression darkened with silent frustration. He activated his mana to shake the blood off his blade, gritting his teeth as he muttered to himself.

"What a flashy way to die..."

Li Tongya was quite certain that this whole incident was likely the doing of the Yu Family. No other families in the area possessed the power to harm his Li Family or would recklessly employ talismans of the Foundation Establishment Realm in such a manner.

With no further recourse available to him, Li Tongya could only release a frustrated sigh before reluctantly turning back.

Li Tongya recovered another gray-robed man from the depths of the lake, bloodied and lifeless. He removed the man's hood, only to find a charred black mass where his face once was.

"Second Uncle."

Li Xuanfeng descended from the air, his face slightly pale yet still filled with anger as he looked at the corpse in Li Tongya's hands.

"Disfiguring the man's face is useless. Qi Cultivators around the lake are well-known figures. This person was an elderly man and his clothes were still intact. If we just display the body to the other families, I'm sure they'll recognize this person..." he remarked coldly.

By the time Li Xuanfeng had finished speaking, his anger had ebbed slightly. Feeling that something was amiss, Li Tongya shook his head.

"This is not the right place for discussion."

Li Xuanfeng nodded uncertainly. With a surge of magical power, Li Tongya summoned a flame to cremate the corpse in his grasp.

Together, they then soared into the sky and headed back to Mount Lijing.

As soon as they left, two figures emerged on the lake. One had a cold demeanor and white sideburns and was clad in a gray robe that billowed in the wind. Behind him stood a younger figure, who was gritting his teeth as tears streamed down his face.

"Second Brother..." Yu Mugao's voice trembled, his words hoarse with emotion.

Meanwhile, Yu Xiaogui wore a grim expression, his voice barely above a whisper as he mumbled, "How did it come to this..? Master Jiang's death is one thing, but losing Muyuan and arousing suspicion from the Li Family... This isn't worth it at all!"

Yu Xiaogui's resolve remained firm as he refused to intervene and watched Yu Muyuan die before his eyes.

"This wasn't a mere oversight in planning. There's something off about this Li Xuanfeng... I've never heard of someone with a spiritual sense spanning a hundred li. He can't be just a Qi Cultivator... Even a Purple Mansion isn't capable of such a feat!" Yu Mugao exclaimed indignantly.

"That's enough!" Yu Xiaogui cut him off coldly, "Li Tongya isn't dumb. He could have gathered evidence but he chose not to. Although he decided not to pursue this matter and fall out with our family, this incident still marks the beginning of a rift between our families. From now on, we're not even apparent allies but enemies..."

"Father... I understand," Yu Mugao said, standing up straight and wiping away his tears. His expression hardened as he made a cold and steely declaration.

"This is the right time to eliminate An Jingming!"

Meanwhile, on the shore of Moongaze Lake...

Li Xuanfeng and Li Tongya flew in silence for a while before Li Tongya finally broke the silence.

"It's the Yu Family's doing."

Li Xuanfeng's expression darkened, a simmering anger evident as he clenched his teeth.

"I knew it was the Yu Family when I saw you disposing of the body. However, we probably can't confront them right now... If we didn't have that... we would have never known who had done this. Yu Mugao must have employed some insidious tactics to harm Xiu'er in this manner."

Li Tongya's voice turned cold as he spoke with finality in his tone.

"There's no need for further discussion on this matter. The truth will become clear once we return and investigate."

Li Tongya slowly sheathed his sword and continued, "This incident has stirred up quite a commotion... I suspect that everyone on the lake is already aware of it. If my guess is correct, Yu Xiaogui has likely arrived or is on his way to the scene. That was why I suggested that we leave first. Although he might not dare to fight us directly now, it was still better for us to leave quickly."

Li Xuanfeng's heart sank. Although everyone feared the Li Family because it was under the protection of a sword immortal, only members of the Li Family knew that this was merely a facade.

On the surface, the two families had not yet turned openly hostile, but in secret, they had already become enemies. No one knew for sure what would happen from now on...

"Should we... seek assistance from the Xiao Family?" Li Xuanfeng inquired in a low voice.

Li Tongya shook his head in response.

"We should wait until I attain the Foundation Establishment Realm. Besides, the Yu Family has the Yuanwu Peak backing them, and the Xiao Family is trying to lay low for now so they won't intervene in such matters. We'll reassess the situation when the Xiao Family makes their move. We can't always rely on others... we must rely on ourselves."

As they conversed, Moun Lijing loomed beneath them. People had gathered below, kneeling and crying. Li Xuanfeng's eyes welled with tears, unable to bear the sight.

Meanwhile, Li Tongya sighed softly, hovering in the sky above.

Upon arriving at Lijing Town, Li Xuanxuan landed before the collapsed rear hall. Flames were still licking at the wooden structure. Clan soldiers hurried over to him.

Li Xuanxuan swept his spiritual sense forward, allowing the scene beneath the ruins to materialize in his mind.

His face paled slightly as beads of sweat formed on his forehead. He turned his head to the side and asked, "Was the Young Family Head in the courtyard?"

The unconscious Li Pingyi had already been retrieved and taken away to be treated, while a trembling clan soldier stood before him. "Reporting to the Family Head, I saw him earlier... he should have been in the courtyard," he said, his voice timid.

Li Xuanxuan's chest tightened. His face paled and he could almost see stars before his eyes. He dropped onto his knees with a thud and cried out loudly.

"XIU'ER...!"

He continued sweeping the area with his spiritual sense but found only the remains of a few clan soldiers amidst the rubble, along with blood, dismembered body parts, and bone fragments.

There was no sign of Li Yuanxiu. He doubled over, feeling the world spin before his eyes as he wailed in agony.

Hearing the head of the family in such distress, the surrounding clan soldiers and cultivators were filled with horror, joining him and kneeling on the ground as well.

Li Xuanxuan clutched his chest as he struggled to catch his breath. Tears streamed down his face as he spoke through gritted teeth. "W-What... what has happened here..?"

A clan soldier rescued from the rubble kneeled and cried out in agony.

"It was the pearl! The pearl... it unleashed a spell!"

Beside him, Xu Gongming recoiled in shock and fear. It was he who had sent over the precious pearl from the mine to the courtyard.

His vision darkened, never expecting that he would become a suspect in this incident. He got down on his knees and stumbled forward.

"The precious pearl came from the mine! I-I will... go investigate this...!"

"From the mine..?" Li Xuanxuan's face darkened. The Ebony mine had been explored under the leadership of the An Family. Naturally, they were the prime suspects.

Li Xuanxuan let out a frustrated sigh before hissing resentfully, "Is the An Family out of their minds?!"

Despite his turmoil, Li Xuanxuan managed to compose himself. He wiped his tears away and barked a command, "Go and investigate this!"

As Xu Gongming scrambled to leave, Li Xuanxuan lowered his gaze to see Li Yuanjiao, who had already arrived before him. His cheeks were smeared with dirt for he had been searching among the rubble with tears streaming down his face, and they were still dripping from his chin.

Meanwhile, Li Qinghong cradled Li Yuanyun in her arms, both of them sobbing uncontrollably. Several clan elders were kneeling nearby, their aged faces stained with tears. The courtyard was silent, save for the sound of mournful weeping.
ùëìùò≥ùëíùëíùìåùò¶ùò£ùòØ‚Ñ¥ùë£ùò¶ùëô.ùò§ùëúùëö

The oppressive stillness was shattered when Li Tongya and Li Xuanfeng finally descended into the courtyard. Seeing Li Tongya, Li Xuanxuan's tears surged once more, and he spoke with indignation.

"Second Uncle! Xiu'er... he..."

Li Xuanfeng clenched his fists while Li Tongya sighed quietly and approached Li Xuanxuan.

"Come with me..." he said softly.

Li Xuanxuan nodded through clenched teeth, accompanying Li Tongya as they rode the wind toward the mountain.

Meanwhile, Li Xuanfeng stayed behind to investigate. When he finally pieced together the events, he spat angrily, "What a low move!"

As soon as he said that, the rapid sound of hoofbeats echoed nearby. Tian Zhongqing rode in on his horse, carrying a mystery person. He quickly dismounted and dropped the person to the ground, eliciting cries of pain from that person. He then addressed Li Xuanxuan with a respectful bow before speaking.

"My lord, the culprit has been captured. He's a spy from the An Family!"

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Meanwhile in the An Residence...

The An Family had just constructed an impressive, shimmery golden pavilion atop Mount Huazhong.

An Zheyan had commissioned the pavilion for his son, An Jingming, and it had complex formations engraved onto it. It was designed to harness spiritual qi and to stabilize one's soul.

An Jingming sat cross-legged alone within the golden formation, his handsome features illuminated by its soft glow. His long hair was tied back neatly, and he wore crystal-clear gold bracelets on his wrists. A jade ax stood before him, surrounded by a gentle white mist that seemed to lend him an aura of immortality.

An Jingming should have been deep in cultivation, but he was frequently distracted and was unable to immerse himself in his meditation.

Currently at the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, he was far ahead of his father, An Zheyan, in terms of cultivation. This fact filled An Zheyan with pride.

After sitting for a while, An Jingming found himself still unable to concentrate. After another half an hour, he finally rose to his feet, descended the stairs, and pushed open the door to a luxurious hall.

An Zheyan was seated inside, with a wine cup and a pair of silver chopsticks in each hand, watching as seven or eight dancers danced to a beautiful melody in front of him. He had a contented expression, and there was a smile on his lips.

He was just picking up a small piece of rabbit meat from the dish in front of him when he spotted An Jingming descending the stairs in his flowing Daoist robe.

An Zheyan hastily discarded his chopsticks and dismissed everyone in the hall hurriedly.

"Go away, all of you!"

The musicians and dancers quickly scattered as An Jingming approached.

"Did I disturb your meditation, son?" An Zheyan asked, looking somewhat guilty.

"Not at all, since the building has a soundproofing formation," An Jingming reassured his father, shaking his head.

He looked at his father for a moment before continuing, "I've been feeling restless today. Have I forgotten something important...?"

An Zheyan attempted to dispel his son's concerns with a hearty laugh.

"Nonsense, my boy... Don't worry yourself."

However, An Jingming, sharp as ever, sensed that something was aloof and fixed his father with a penetrating gaze.

"Father, you mustn't keep secrets from me! What are you hiding?!" he demanded with a slightly gloomy expression.




# Chapter 214: An Jingming's Death

"It's... it's nothing really," An Zheyan stammered, withdrawing his hand awkwardly, a sheepish expression crossing his face as he spoke.

"A few days ago, while you were in seclusion, I sent some members to assist the Li Family on behalf of the Yu Family... I may have indulged in a bit too much wine and spouted some nonsense."

After saying that, he waved his hands hastily and forced a smile on his face, adding, "But rest assured, everyone present at the time was trustworthy and loyal. They won't breathe a word of it!"
ùëìùìáùò¶‚ÑØùò∏ùò¶ùëèùìÉùëúùò∑‚ÑØùëô.ùëêùëúùìÇ

"Spouted some nonsense?!" An Jingming interrupted, disregarding his father's attempt to explain further. His expression betrayed his unease as he murmured, "You didn't tell the others about my achievements in cultivation, did you?"

An Zheyan froze for a moment before a crestfallen expression appeared on his aged face. Observing his father's reaction, An Jingming immediately knew that he had hit the nail on the head. He immediately lost his temper and flew into a rage.

"Father, surely, you understand the gravity of this situation?!" he hissed through his clenched teeth.

An Zheyan bowed his head in shame like a child. Before An Jingming could erupt in anger further, they felt the mountain's grand formation shaking.

An Jingming glanced up sourly and noticed a gray-clothed figure floating outside the formation. The figure was looking at the pavilion below calmly with chilling indifference.

"An Jingming, get your ass out here!" Yu Mugao's voice cut through the air, which was tinged with annoyance. His carefully laid plans to strike at the Li Family had been compromised, leaving behind a trail that would inevitably lead back to the An Family. He anticipated that the Li Family would inevitably turn to the An Family for explanations‚Äîif not outright accusations.

Yu Mugao had already prepared his pawns and devised a scheme. All they were waiting for was the arrival of the Li Family's representatives. However, to his surprise, Li Xuanfeng had managed to uncover the traces and had even assassinated Master Jiang and Yu Muyuan.

With the Li Family suddenly quiet, Yu Mugao realized he had no choice but to take matters into his own hands. Crafting a pretext, he aimed to shift some of the blame onto the Li Family.

"This person has conspired to murder the young head of the Li Family... The Yu family, entrusted by the Li family, vows to bring this person to justice. There are witnesses to support this," Yu Mugao declared in a deep voice.

Finishing his statement, Yu Mugao muttered to himself, "This won't be enough to take over the An Family... We can only settle this before the Li Family reacts. Eliminate An Zheyan and An Jingming, and pick a puppet leader within the An Family. Their influence will serve to distort the truth and deceive others."

Accustomed to such machinations, Yu Mugao wasted no time in devising his next moves. He glanced down toward the pavilion below where An Zheyan and An Jingming stood, visibly bewildered.

An Zheyan's disbelief boiled over as he exclaimed, "The Li and Yu families?! What is the meaning of this?"

An Jingming, however, wore a resigned expression and let out a sigh.

"Father, if we do not tread carefully, we risk becoming casualties... How loyal do you think the remaining people of our family are? Both families have likely infiltrated our family thoroughly... The seeds you planted long ago may have sprouted into traps for us. By drawing attention like this, I surmise either Li Xuanxuan or Li Xuanfeng is dead."

"T-That's...!" An Zheyan faltered, rendered speechless momentarily. After a moment of silence, tears welled in his eyes.

With a remorseful slap to his own face, he declared through clenched teeth, "This is the doing of Yu Mugao. Leave me be! I will handle this! So long as you survive, the An Family still has hope."

An Zheyan grasped An Jingming's hand, his voice tinged with desperation as he urged, "Didn't you ask me to construct a secret passage leading out of the mountain before? Go now! Leave these outsiders to me... you must go..."

Sweat beaded on his brow as he placed all his hope for the future on An Jingming, showing little regard for his safety.

An Jingming, however, shook his head solemnly in response. "Father... it's too late. Can't you see? It's not just Yu Mugao who seeks me out... Yu Xiaogui and the others are probably also watching from afar with Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators waiting outside. There's no escaping this. The Yu Family will never be at ease unless I'm dead."

The defensive formation of the mountain rumbled ominously, and panicked voices filled the air as footsteps drew nearer. An Jingming slammed his foot down, causing the doors in the pavilion to seal shut one by one, emitting a radiant golden glow.

"Family Head! The Yu Family is attacking us! Family Head!"

"Family Head...! Save us, please!"

An Jingming had meticulously inscribed formations during the construction of the pavilion, unaware that they would one day serve to barricade his own kin.

The people outside the pavilion cried and wailed while they slapped on the doors desperately, hoping to gain entrance. From the other side of the door, palm prints could be seen pressed against the door screens.

Most of the An Family members were slackers‚Äîmere Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators. Apart from An Zheyan and An Jingming, none of them had even managed to condense the Jade Capital Chakra. Naturally, they were too weak to breach the formation. Thus, they could do little but cry and curse outside. Even so, their voices were barely audible amidst the chaos.

An Zheyan collapsed to the ground with a whimper, slapping himself vehemently in regret. The force drew blood from the corners of his mouth and knocked two of his teeth out in the process. Through tears, he lamented, "It's all my fault! My selfishness, my greed, my indulgence in pleasures... It has brought this upon you, upon us all..."

An Jingming's tears flowed freely as he sank to his knees, cradling An Zheyan's plump, tear-streaked face.

"I will carve a path through them... you should leave through the secret passage. Yu Mugao's gaze is fixed on me. Father, there's still a chance for you to escape..." he told An Zheyan as if he were his father instead.

An Zheyan's trembling legs betrayed his resolve as he struggled to articulate a response. Finally, he managed to choke out, "Where... should I go?"

"To the Li Family," An Jingming replied, tears mingling with determination in his eyes, "I think I understand what's going on now... Time is running out, we can't keep talking here."

With a firm grip, he lifted An Zheyan to his feet. His heart was heavy with sorrow as he said, "Father, you must stop drinking and abstain yourself. Always speak wisely, and protect yourself. Do not dwell on revenge... and consider having a few more children."

BOOM!

A thunderous boom echoed through the air as the An Family's grand formation shattered. An Zheyan winced and dashed toward the rear of the pavilion while wiping away his tears.

An Jingming watched his father disappear into the secret passage before turning away. With a bittersweet smile tugging at his lips and tears streaming down his face, he removed his jade crown, allowing his dark locks to spill freely over his shoulders. His once serene demeanor gave way to a fierce resolve.

He removed a dharma sword from the wall, secured it to his waist, and tightened his clutch on his jade axe. He heard the jingle of the golden bracelet around his wrist.

He slowly descended the staircase, pushing open the courtyard door. Before him lay a scene of carnage, blood staining the ground and heads rolling before the steps.

"Yu Mugao of the Yu Family."

The young man before him bore a fierce countenance, wearing a white headband that covered his forehead. He was staring at An Jingming like a ferocious wolf.

An Jingming scrutinized him carefully while Yu Mugao returned the stare with cold indifference. An Jingming did not resort to pleading for mercy or begging for him to spare his family.

Instead, he introduced himself.

"An Jingming of the An Family."

With his jade axe raised, An Jingming charged forward. Yu Mugao simply watched as one of the Yu Family's Qi Cultivators of the eighth heavenly layer came forward from behind him, blocking An Jingming's jade axe with his dharma sword.

A loud metallic clang rang out when the weapons collided against each other. The Qi Cultivator recoiled from the impact, taking a step backward. An Jingming turned the direction of his jade axe, prompting Yu Mugao to raise an eyebrow.

Another figure emerged from behind him, a peak Qi Cultivator, repelling An Jingming's jade axe with his dharma sword.

"Your progress in cultivation is impressive to be able to keep up or maybe even surpass the peak Cultivator by a margin," Yu Mugao remarked with a sigh, his tone laced with amusement.

"Had you not been born into the An Family and were given another hundred years to cultivate, I'm sure you'd make a name for yourself among the three sects and seven gates..." he drawled.

An Jingming offered no reply. Instead, he took a step back and swung his jade axe again, grappling with the two Qi Cultivators from the Yu Family. Despite holding his ground against them, he found himself unable to break the stalemate even after a series of exchanges.

Anxiety began gnawing at him. With Yu Xiaogui's absence, he resolved to push through regardless of mana expenditure and rose into the air.

Before he could make another move, a figure cloaked in gray appeared before him. With his white sideburns and smooth hands akin to jade, the man stood silently with his eyes closed.

"Yu Xiaogui," An Jingming addressed him, calmly tying his jade axe around his waist and then cupping his fist.

He then drew his sharp white dharma sword and positioned the blade against his own neck. The razor-sharp edge sliced through the black hair cascading over his shoulder, and the severed strands fell to the ground.

"A great man will inevitably meet other heroes in the world, just as a river will eventually merge with the sea. Although one may strive to touch the clouds with ambition, he is ultimately dragged down by his clan..."

With a swift motion, blood splattered everywhere as he beheaded himself, leaving his headless body collapsing onto the ground.

Yu Xiaogui's eyelids fluttered briefly as he lifted the corpse with his mana and inspected it carefully.

"Even the most extraordinary beings are not beyond mortality... to think such a genius would meet such an end," he remarked softly.




# Chapter 215: Pingyi

Li Pingyi was in a daze when he heard the sound of crying. He stepped outside and found a little boy sitting by the door with tears glistening on his eyelashes. Sunlight bathed his face, lending him an endearing appearance.

Li Pingyi took a step closer tentatively, and to his surprise, a childish voice escaped his own lips.

"Brother Yuanxiu..."

The boy looked up. Li Pingyi then heard himself earnestly saying, "I'd be sad if you died, too."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

"Ngh."

Li Pingyi's vision slowly grew clearer as he finally woke up from his dream. Pain throbbed throughout his body, and a bitter and metallic taste lingered in his mouth. His chest ached due to his broken ribs while his legs screamed in agony‚Äîlikely fractured as well.

Two flies buzzed before his eyes. Li Pingyi attempted to swat them away, but his limbs refused to respond. He writhed on the bed, gradually noticing a figure seated beside him, silently and solemnly watching him like a stone statue.

"Father..." Li Pingyi uttered weakly, but Li Xiewen's expression remained impassive, devoid of any emotion.

"Where are my hands...?"

His thoughts drifted, disjointed and distant as he croaked out the question.

"They're gone."

Li Xiewen had finally found his voice and broke the silence with two quiet words.

Li Pingyi froze as if he had been struck across the face. All the memories came flooding back to him‚Äîthe precious pearl, the thunder flames, the crumbling house.

With a burst of energy, Li Pingyi writhed violently and exclaimed, "How's Young Family Head?!"

Li Xiewen's moved his lips again, uttering yet another two words.

"...He's gone."

Li Pingyi felt a squeeze in his throat as he croaked out something incoherent. Tears streamed down his cheeks as he struggled to repeat his father's words.

"He's... gone?"

Li Xiewen's watched quietly as Li Pingyi transitioned from silent tears to outright sobbing, to convulsive weeping, only to abruptly cease... because Li Xiewen brought his hand down on his son's cheek.

SLAP!

Again, his hand struck Li Pingyi's other cheek, leaving the boy dizzy and disoriented from the force.

Li Xiewen reached for Li Pingyi's neck as the boy squirmed on the bed, sobbing.

"Father, I have unfinished business."

Li Xiewen regarded him coldly as Li Pingyi continued to squirm, his gaze darting around the room until it settled on the charred wooden slip at the head of the bed.

Li Pingyi halted his tears and spoke quietly, "Young Family Head told me to deliver this book to Young Master Yuanyun... Please, Father."

Li Xiewen faltered, his voice thick with emotion as two burning tears trickled down his cheeks.

"You were the one who brought that precious pearl to him..." he said hoarsely.

"Yes, it was me," Li Pingyi squeezed the words through clenched teeth, his body instantly going limp as though he had lost his backbone.

Tears streamed down Li Xiewen's face as he continued hoarsely, "You've been a good kid since young... You're sharp and resourceful. Other than your lack of spiritual orifice, you're no less capable than the children among the generation of Yuan. Unlike me, I've been dumb since I was a child. Were it not for my close ties with Brother Xuanxuan and the lack of ambition among my younger brothers, I would never have been chosen as a town manager."

Li Xiewen shed more tears as he continued, "And then you were born. When those two dark eyes stared at me, my only thought was, 'Ah, this child will surely grow into a capable man and surpass me one day.'"

Li Pingyi lay on the bed. He could taste his father's tears in his mouth‚Äîthey were bitter. Tears continued flowing from his eyes as he whimpered, "I've let you down... Father."

Li Xiewen wiped his tears and gently patted his eldest son. He gritted his teeth and hissed, "But Xiu'er is gone... Li Yuanxiu is gone! That's Li Yuanxiu we're talking about! The Young Family Head of the Li Family, the successor your grandfather entrusted to me, which I entrusted to you! Do you understand the weight of that responsibility?!"

Li Pingyi closed his eyes and nodded silently.

"I do, Father."

Li Xiewen rose slowly, tucking the charred wooden slip into his sleeve before casting one last glance at his eldest son's face. With a wave of his sleeve, he exited the room, closing the door behind him.

As the door swung open, the blinding sunlight flooded Li Pingyi's vision. But as his father departed and closed the door behind him, darkness reclaimed the room.

The faint glow from the desk barely reached Li Pingyi. Unable to see his surroundings clearly, he squirmed on the bed like a worm and peered over its edge.

Straining his eyes, Li Pingyi realized the thunder flames had damaged his vision‚Äîhis left eye barely functioned. With his right eye, he discerned a big bucket beneath his feet. It was made of wood found on the mountain and bound by iron, securely sealed to prevent any leakage.

Within the bucket was bloody water, likely remnants of his own when his father had wiped him down. A pungent and metallic odor assaulted his senses. A gray rag floated on the surface like a dead fish.

"Not bad."

Estimating the distance, Li Pingyi shifted his only functional leg, bracing himself for the pain of moving over broken bones. With a deep breath, he stomped down.

PLOP!

He plunged into the blood-filled bucket headfirst, the liquid rising just below his chest. Fearful of moving involuntarily, he wedged his leg into the bed's corner.

As the taste of blood filled his mouth, Li Pingyi began to cough violently, inhaling and expelling the crimson fluid with each convulsion, causing gurgling noises in the water. Eventually, his body stiffened, urine leaking from his rigid form and wetting his pants.

A beam of light appeared before his eyes and faces flickered through his mind‚Äîhis father's, his mother's... and Li Yuanxiu's.

Amidst the turmoil, a single thought surfaced‚ÄîTo be able to see his face again one last time before my death... it's all worth it.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Outside the door, Li Xiewen closed his eyes, clenching his hands tightly until they turned white. Tears streamed down his face uncontrollably. When the gurgling sound from within ceased, he collapsed softly onto the ground.

For a moment, he could not discern his own surroundings, and he was not even sure of which the floor and ceiling was. Dizziness overwhelmed him, and he found himself staring at a pair of leather boots before him.

Raising his head, Li Xiewen locked eyes with a face bearing a striking resemblance to Li Yuanxiu's, albeit with more angular features and a fiercer gaze.

The man peered intently at him and asked, "Uncle Xiewen, where's Pingyi?"

Li Xiewen rose to his feet, his voice barely above a whisper as he replied, "Greetings, Young Master Yuanjiao... Li Pingyi was too distraught by the Young Family Head's passing and took his own life."

Without waiting for Li Yuanjiao's reaction, Li Xiewen retrieved half of a burnt wooden slip and presented it to him with both hands.

"Young Family Head has instructed Li Pingyi to deliver this to Young Master Yuanyun... With this, I have fulfilled Li Pingyi's last task on his behalf!"




# Chapter 216: An Zheyu of the An Family

"Second Uncle!"

Li Xuanxuan dropped to his knees in the cave dwelling. Li Tongya watched his nephew's tear-streaked face silently, wordlessly.

"Are we... going to just... forget about this whole incident?!" Li Xuanxuan asked through his gritted teeth.

"Forget about it..?" Li Tongya lowered his gaze and continued, "This is not up to the Li Family to decide alone... The question lies in whether the Yu Family is willing to cease hostilities! Once enmity is sown between two families, either party cannot easily resolve it..."

Li Xuanxuan lifted his head, wiping his tears before clenching his jaw tightly.

"It's Yu Mugao who colluded with others and killed the members of the Li Family... He can't still resent us and keep harming us! It's our family members who got killed, yet we still have to be wary and fearful that the Yu Family won't stop at this... That's just..."

Li Xuanxuan hesitated just as he was about to finish the sentence with the word "unfair". As someone approaching the age of forty, it was absurdly childish for him to be hung up about fairness in this world.

Yet, the weight of powerlessness and grief still bore heavily upon him. He bowed his head as he wept silently.

"Such is the cruelty of the world... the merciless whims of fate, where even the mightiest are but ants," Li Tongya lamented, his gray locks cascading around him as he sighed in anguish.

Li Xuanxuan covered his face and said mournfully, "Xiu'er was the pride of our family, destined to lead the Li Family... And now he lies fallen..."

"With Xiu'er gone, who among our remaining disciples is fit to lead the family? Yuanjiao is fierce, Yuanyun is gentle, Qinghong is carefree..." Li Xuanxuan murmured.

Li Tongya shook his head gently and quietly said, "That can wait... You'll take charge for now but do not descend the mountain. Let Xiewen manage matters at the foot of the mountain and relay them to you. Considering the two centuries of a Qi Cultivator's lifespan, you're still in your prime. If none of the children among the generation of Yuan are suitable to lead the family, we'll assess the younger ones in twenty years' time."

Li Xuanxuan's lips trembled as he closed his eyes, shedding two more tears as he uttered only a single word quietly.

"Understood."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The cool spring rain continued for several consecutive nights, marking the end of spring on Moongaze Lake. With its departure came the arrival of warm summer winds sweeping down from the north, colliding with Mount Dali and dispelling the lingering dampness and chill.

Gusts of wind from the southern shore of the lake carried remnants of gray and black paper, casting an onyx hue across the sky as far as the eye could see. The mournful sound of weeping drifted through the air, echoing from Mount Lijing to Mount Huazhong and onward to the Milin Prefecture, where homes were decorated in white.

Li Yuanxiu had been torn apart by the thunder flames, leaving behind only bits of flesh and blood combined with the debris of the collapsed rear courtyard.

Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanfeng labored to clear away the rubble so that they could gather the soil that was soaked with Li Yuanxiu's blood. The bloodstained soil and pieces of his bones were filled inside the coffin. They had also made a wooden sculpture that resembled Li Yuanxiu and placed it on the bloodstained soil before burying the coffin.

"Xiu'er!"

Veiled in white, the coffin was transported from the town to the mountains in solemn procession, the only sound piercing the silence being the muffled sobs of mourners. Clan uncles and brothers mourned in silence while the elders wept openly, their grief etched upon wrinkled faces.

Li Xuanxuan led the procession, carrying two long gray wooden poles that bore the weight of the coffin, with Li Yuanjiao supporting it from behind.

Raising his head, Li Yuanjiao met the gazes of those gathered around him. Among them, he caught sight of his half-brothers, their countenances reflecting a mix of sorrow and anger.

Li Yuanjiao's adoption was carried out in secret, so in the eyes of the others, he was still an illegitimate heir. Li Xuanxuan had just become a Qi Cultivator, so he would be preoccupied with cultivation and unable to handle the family's affairs.

With Li Yuanxiu's death, the position of the family head was likely to fall to Li Yuanyun's hands. This meant the authority would potentially be shifted away from Li Changhu's lineage and to Li Xiangping's lineage. How could those shrewd brothers not worry?

The major sect of the Li Family upheld principles of equality. Yet in reality, only those with spiritual orifices who grew up together on the mountains truly treated each other as equals.

Those dwelling at the foot of the mountain found themselves subject to differential treatment. There was also a huge difference between the way the Family Head treated those in the main lineage and those of a different lineage.

Although Li Yuanjiao immediately understood the thoughts of his half-siblings, he was too consumed by his own grief and anger to pay any heed to them.

"The Yu Family... and Yu Mugao," Li Yuanjiao uttered their names through his gritted teeth.

Despite his resolve for vengeance, he couldn't shake the bitter realization of his own limitations as a lowly cultivator at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.

"The Yu Family boasts a late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Yu Yufeng, along with Yu Xiaogui at the early stage, and a mid-stage Qi Cultivator‚ÄîYu Mugao himself. This path of vengeance won't be an easy one..."

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Unlike the mournful atmosphere shrouding Mount Lijing beneath its veils of white silk, Mount Huazhong resonated with jubilant laughter.

"Congratulations, Family Head!"

"Congratulations! An Jingming and his father were long overdue for removal by the Yu Family. Now, Mount Huazhong is rightfully ours!"

The man smiling smugly at the forefront was a cultivator at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. He simply nodded in satisfaction at these words.

"An Zheyan was a fool who squandered the family's resources on his precious son. The two of them acted arrogantly just because they were Qi Cultivators while I, An Zheyu, toiled away like a slave for them! But now, their folly has led to their demise... With the main family's backing, our An Family is poised for prosperity and growth!"

An Zheyu was naturally the puppet leader chosen and supported by the Yu Family. At the age of fifty, he was still stuck at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. If it were not for the Yu Family, he was destined to remain a nobody in the An Family. He reveled in his newfound position of authority, indulging in feasts.

Another figure, at only the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, chimed in obsequiously, "Well said! Had these resources been bestowed upon your lordship earlier, you would have attained the Foundation Establishment Realm long ago! It's truly regrettable they were squandered on An Jingming!"

The words struck a nerve with An Zheyu, prompting a visceral reaction. His gaze turned fierce as he retorted, "So what? With the allowance provided by the Yu Family, I'll attain the Qi Cultivation Realm in less than three years!"

"Indeed, indeed!" the other man responded as he slapped his own cheek apologetically.

"Family Master, the Yu Family took away An Jingming's head, intending to preserve and study it. His body is still here though... What should we do with it?" he asked quietly.

An Zheyu's eyes gleamed with a mixture of greed and bitter resentment. Through gritted teeth, he responded, 'I've heard tales of the miraculous latent powers in a genius's body. It's rumored that by consuming it, one may be able to inherit one or two of these powers... Get someone to dismember it and present it on a silver platter. I'd love to see how miraculous it is!"

An Zheyu's words immediately caused the temperature of the hall to drop by a few degrees. The guards stationed on either side of him stirred restlessly.

An Jingming had been kind and generous toward everyone, except for the useless ones in the family. Despite being at odds with certain clan members, particularly An Zheyu and the others in his group, An Jingming had a great reputation among the others. During the seven days of his mourning, cries filled the air.

The guards exchanged glances with each other but they were too powerless to defy An Zheyu and could only silently shed tears.

Meanwhile, the lackey vying for favor with the next family head made the necessary arrangements happily. It was not long before an old servant arrived, bearing wooden steamer baskets and a pot of soup.

Observing the tearful look on the old servant's face, the lackey flew into a rage, delivering a swift kick to the man's waist.

"What's with the long face on such a joyous occasion? Someone, drag him away and flog him to death!" he barked with a sneer.

Despite the lackey's order, the guards refused to move. Tears were streaming down their faces uncontrollably as well.

Enraged by their refusal to comply, the lackey lashed out, "You guys have a death wish too?!"

It was only then did the two guards move and drag the old servant away.

"I have served the An Family for four generations... The head of the family is foolish and his sons are unfilial. Ming'er was the only wise one, yet such tragedy befell him and now we are reduced to the lapdogs of the Yu Family... An Zheyu, you have betrayed us!"

As the old servant's anguished cries disappeared down the corridor, An Zheyu burst out laughing.

"I once gambled away two gold bars in my youth, and that old fool snitched on me to Father. I was beaten so badly that I was bedridden for three days... But I couldn't get back at him because he was protected by An Zheyan. I've never forgotten about this and now, after decades of waiting, I've finally taken my revenge!"

After saying that, An Zheyu set his wine cup down and dipped his finger into the pool of watery blood in the steamer baskets. He gave it a careful whiff and could only recognize the all-too-familiar metallic scent of blood.

"They say the corpse of a Qi Cultivator doesn't decay for days... Seems the rumors were true!" he marveled.
