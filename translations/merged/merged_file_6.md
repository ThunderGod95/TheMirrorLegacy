# Chapter 275: The Coiling Dragon Pillar

"Oh?"

Li Xuanxuan glanced at the jade box, noticing the brilliant and glowing light emanating from it, suggesting the object in it was no ordinary item. He laughed and said, "Senior, you are too kind..."

"Ah."

Yuan Huyuan opened the jade lock and lifted the lid of the jade box. Inside lay a gleaming, cold green blade, appearing to be just under four chi long. The sword's blade was smooth and bright, and it was decorated with fine, scale-like patterns that ran along its surface, exuding a chilling light. Li Xuanxuan immediately recognized that this was an extraordinary sword and said hoarsely, "This is..."

"This sword is called the Coiling Dragon Pillar, three chi seven cun long, forged from Frostmire Stone and supplemented with serpent dragon blood. It is a top-tier item among Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts," Yuan Huyuan explained as he held the box with one hand and introduced the sword further, "This sword once belonged to the Chen Family of the Linyu Gate. After the Linyu Gate's demise, it passed into the hands of a rogue cultivator who was later killed by our ancestor, thus coming into our family's possession."

Li Xuanxuan, though not skilled in swordsmanship, was captivated by the sword. Yuan Huyuan continued, "Our ancestor heard that Senior Tongya's sword was barely at the Qi Cultivation Realm. Since our family does not specialize in swordsmanship, we felt it a shame for such a treasure to be wasted, so our ancestor asked me to deliver it to you on his behalf."

Li Xuanxuan repeatedly refused, expressing how he could not possibly accept such a valuable gift, finding it difficult to justify accepting it. However, Yuan Huyuan warmly insisted, pushing the jade box towards him and saying, "My clan sister manages Qingsui Peak alone, and our ancestor fears she may be oppressed. We hope she can rely on the Sword Immortal's reputation for some protection..."

Hearing this, Li Xuanxuan understood the intention behind the gift, thinking, This sword is not given for the sake of our Li Family or my second uncle, but purely for the sake of our fourth uncle. The Yuan Family, having dominated Mushroom Forest Plain for so many years, has deep foundations. Investing in a potential future Purple Mansion immortal clan is no trouble for them.

Seeing Li Xuanxuan still hesitant, Yuan Huyuan placed the jade box in his arms and said warmly, "Our ancestor also heard about the marriage between the Li and Xiao families. The Xiao Family and our Yuan Family have supported each other for years. With your family gradually establishing a foothold on the lake, we'll gain another ally. If things go well in the future, our families can strengthen our ties and communicate more closely."

For prestigious immortal clans like the Yuan and Xiao families, establishing a foothold meant more than just dominating an area—it meant being the strongest in the region with the clan and family maintaining extensive connections. Li Xuanxuan nodded, taking note of these words.

Li Xuanxuan and Yuan Huyuan chatted amiably before sitting down in the courtyard, enjoying tea. Li Xuanxuan, suddenly feeling a sense of doubt, hesitated for a moment before asking, "When I was young, I heard that the Golden Tang Gate invaded Mushroom Forest Plain, causing many deaths, but I never heard of any casualties among your esteemed family..."

"Ah, that matter..." Yuan Huyuan paused, seemingly contemplating how he could explain the matter before finally saying, "Our Yuan Family did suffer few casualties. Those who died were from minor families and among the commoners... Your clan must be aware of some of the secrets involved. I came here today to speak frankly."

Yuan Huyuan took a sip of tea and continued, "Every year, our Yuan Family plants a large quantity of spirit herbs and mines spirit ores for the Azure Pond Sect. The invasion was a way for the Azure Pond Sect and Golden Tang Gate to divide the blood and resentment. Killing minor families and commoners sufficed; there was no need to kill diligent slaves like us, was there?"

He wore a mocking smile on his face and made a self-deprecating remark, saying in a low voice, "The Azure Pond Sect has ruled for five hundred years. They have clearly divided among which small clans shall grow people, which clans would grow herbs, which tribes are to be controlled, and where devil cultivators are to refine pills. In five hundred years, only the Xiao Family has been an exception, perhaps because Chi Wei intentionally allowed it. Never underestimate those few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators on Azure Pond Peak. After five hundred years, even the dumbest demons have become extremely cunning!"

Li Xuanxuan felt a silent fear in his heart, finding it hard to speak. Yuan Huyuan glanced at him and smiled. "While the Azure Pond Sect feasts on the table, we are merely the small servants kneeling on the ground, enjoying the spiritual qi of heaven and earth and the blood and sweat of the common people. To be honest..."

Yuan Huyuan's expression turned serious, and his tone carried a hint of admonishment as he spoke.

"This is also our ancestor's sentiment. He is nearly three hundred years old and has seen many things. Since your family has a Sword Immortal, why not send more disciples into the sect? Your family's goal should be to secure a seat at the foot of Azure Pond, not to be just another item in their bowl. Reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm is only the first step..."

Li Xuanxuan pondered for a moment before finally letting out a deep sigh.

"I understand, Senior..."

Yuan Huyuan finally nodded slowly as he finished his tea, saying, "That is good. In the future, our Yuan Family will be in the east, the Li Family in the west, and the Ding Family, a long-standing branch of ours, will remain untouched by us, as will the Xiao Family."

He dipped his finger in the tea, casually drew a line on the table, then stood up. He cupped his fist and smiled.

"Today's conversation has been very pleasant... Please relay my words to Senior Tongya. I must visit the Xiao Family next, so I will take my leave now."

Li Xuanxuan quickly stood up and escorted him out of the formation. He returned to the courtyard, deep in thought, only to find someone already seated there quietly. His clothes were neat, and he was sitting upright, carefully examining the gleaming Coiling Dragon Pillar sword on the table.

Li Xuanxuan bowed respectfully and greeted the man.

"Second Uncle!"

Li Tongya hummed absentmindedly in response as he continued gazing at the fine scale-like patterns on the sword, running his fingers over them. A bright white sword qi glowed from the blade.

Li Tongya nodded and commented, "It is indeed a good sword."

Li Xuanxuan saw Li Tongya's expression and guessed that Li Tongya had heard his entire conversation with Yuan Huyuan. Standing with his fist cupped, he saw Li Tongya place the Coiling Dragon Pillar back into the jade box.

Li Xuanxuan said in a low voice, "Second Uncle, the Yuan Family's advice to us is... to align ourselves with the various peaks to truly maintain a lasting presence at the foot of the Azure Pond Sect. Even if we do not have a peak master in the sect, we must have a few insiders who can speak and hear for us. Our family must produce something valued by the Azure Pond Sect so that we will not be easily manipulated at any time..."

Li Tongya responded with a noncommittal hum and said, "Officially, Chejing is still at the southern border. Few except those in the Purple Mansion Realm know otherwise. In a few years, choose a moderately qualified disciple from the generation of Xi and Yue to send to the sect first."

"Yes!" Li Xuanxuan responded promptly.

Li Tongya then took two steps down and stopped at the table where Yuan Huyuan had been. He glanced at the faint water stain on the table and instructed, "Ding Xiding meant well. Send some return gifts with him when he leaves. While our family will not move against him, we should not get too close either. In situations like these, we must avoid giving others cause for suspicion."

Li Tongya glanced at Li Xuanxuan and shook his head, saying, "The Yuan Family is indeed cautious. They feared I might be unaware of the situation, so they came specifically to remind us."

Li Xuanxuan nodded, saying, "It also seems the Yuan Family is still unaware of the situation on the southern border. They think Fourth Uncle has the potential to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm and are somewhat wary of us. The Ding Family controls the entry point and acts as a buffer between our three families. I will ensure we do not disturb this balance."

"Good that you are aware," Li Tongya nodded. As a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, he could be in seclusion for years at a time. If these matters were not handled properly and left to the younger generation to mishandle, it could result in enemies on all sides upon his emergence, which would be disastrous.

Being ever cautious, he added a few more words of advice, "The news of my breakthrough will spread. In a few years, when we pay tribute, our Li Family will be recognized as a prestigious clan. According to the Yuan Family's implications, the Azure Pond Sect's exploitation of prestigious clans is likely more severe than that of smaller clans. Use these years wisely to measure the spirit fields and allocate our manpower appropriately."

"Understood!" Li Xuanxuan responded, then added, "There is one matter I must report to Second Uncle. At the top of Mount Yuting, there is a jade well, perfectly round like the sun and large enough that it takes nine people to encircle it. The well water is icy cold, and several sets of copper armor are submerged in it. According to An Zheyan, this was how their ancestors had tempered cold armor to gather Courtly Frost Armor Qi throughout the ages!"




# Chapter 276: Jade Court Guard

Li Xuanxuan paused, letting Li Tongya absorb the good news, and then continued, "With this jade well, there is no need for large-scale construction. Although Second Uncle has achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm, our family's roots are shallow, and we have too few Qi Cultivators to guard our territory adequately. Could the Guardian of the Courtly Path be distributed to cultivate some reliable cultivators?"

"That's a good suggestion!" Li Tongya's eyes lit up instantly. The jade well for refining Courtly Frost Armor Qi was not something easily made, requiring extensive research and knowledge of runes. Having this jade well on Mount Yuting would save him considerable effort.

After a moment of thought, Li Tongya replied, "Select some loyal disciples with spiritual orifices that have a clear background. This technique can help quickly condense six chakras and cultivate Qi Cultivators. Do not distribute it lightly, else we risk losing control."

Li Xuanxuan nodded and said, "I plan to select six loyal individuals to begin training, and they will be assigned to the Clan Affairs Courtyard for law enforcement duties. However, I have yet to decide on a name for this division."

Having held authority for decades, Li Xuanxuan naturally understood such intricacies. He smiled and stepped forward, presenting a brush and ink with both hands.

Li Tongya chuckled and took up the brush, saying, "You certainly have thought of a name! You are just waiting for me to write it down."

After a moment's contemplation, he wrote three words with decisive strokes and explained, "I have read both the Aged Courtly Path Scripture and the Guardian of the Courtly Path. The Dao foundation of the former is called Jade Court General, while the latter's Dao foundation is called Court Guard. Let us call them the Jade Court Guards!"

————

Meanwhile in Eastern Mount Yue...

The rays of the morning sun rose gently from the east, illuminating the many thatched cottages and fences. The common folk were just waking from their dreams, some preparing to hunt, others to farm. In recent years, Eastern Mount Yue had been ravaged by war, with corpses littering the land.

The members of the Li Family, along with Shamoli, had worked hard to restore order, bringing many Easterners and related systems and regulations to restrain officials and nobles. It was only in these recent years that things began to improve.

A creaky carriage rumbled along the muddy road, drawing the attention of Mount Yue's inhabitants. Shamoli sat steadily in the carriage with a songstress on each leg, both leaning against his chest. He stroked the shoulders of the women absentmindedly, his thoughts drifting far away.

"Serpent dragon, such a grand spectacle..."

Although the Li Family controlled Eastern Mount Yue thoroughly, Shamoli, being a Qi Cultivator, was well aware of the disturbance from the previous night. He had seen the light from the east and witnessed the two serpent-shaped spells rising and falling, making him rather uneasy.

"Could it be a fight with the An Family? Li Tongya is a peak Qi Cultivation Realm swordsman; defeating An Zheyan should not be a problem, as long as it does not involve the Yu Family..."

Shamoli knew that both the Yu and Li families had affiliations to the sect, but the Yu Family had two more Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, making them far stronger than the Li Family. If they fought, the Li Family might not be able to withstand it.
𝐟𝕣𝗲𝕖𝕨𝗲𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝗲𝚕.𝗰𝚘𝐦

"If the Li Family falls, how can I... the king of Mount Yue...stay safe?! Even preserving my life would be difficult!"

Though oppressed by the Li Family, Shamoli lived comfortably. His greatest hope was for the Li Family to weaken, not perish. He had heard of the Yu Family's ruthless actions; and if they attacked, Shamoli would have no choice but to pack up and become a rogue cultivator.

"Shamoli! Shamoli!"

As Shamoli was lost in his thoughts inside the carriage, the curtain was suddenly lifted, and a young man with short eyebrows and narrow eyes climbed in.

Shamoli's face briefly showed displeasure but he forced a smile, saying, "Ah, it is Brother Tian Rong. What brings you here?"

Tian Rong's lingering gaze on the songstresses displeased Shamoli. But Tian Rong caught himself and averted his gaze, saying, "This Mount Yue region is quite dull, except for the entertainment you have here."

Tian Rong, the son of Tian Youdao, was among those sent to Mount Yue. As a profligate son, he naturally gravitated toward Shamoli. Initially, Shamoli believed he had established a connection with the Tian Family and was overjoyed, treating Tian Rong with great hospitality.

After only three days, Shamoli realized that Tian Rong was an utter piece of trash, with a foul temperament and equally bad behavior. The words that came out of his mouth were so outrageous that even Shamoli, a man of modest education from Mount Yue, found them unbelievable. He wished he could chase Tian Rong out of the palace.

Despite Tian Rong's uselessness, he was the only son of Tian Youdao, so Shamoli didn't want to make an enemy of him. He tried to avoid Tian Rong by leaving on a carriage, but Tian Rong was oblivious and followed him all the way here, leaving Shamoli at a loss.

Shamoli could only sigh to himself, listening to Tian Rong's nonsensical and vulgar talk, thinking to himself, I've heard that Tian Youdao is quite formidable, and is even an elder in the Li Family. How did he end up with a son like this? The world is indeed unpredictable...

As Shamoli was dozing off to Tian Rong's drivel, his ears suddenly perked up when he heard a loud voice outside.

"Tian Zhongqing pays respects to the Great King."

An opportunity to finally interrupt Tian Rong had presented itself, Shamoli straightened up immediately. Overjoyed, he unceremoniously cut off Tian Rong.

"Please come in!"

Tian Zhongqing, though not as outstanding as the main family's cultivators, was considered a fairly talented individual among the external cultivators in the Li Family.

Whoosh!

The thick curtain was lifted, revealing the bright sunlight outside. Tian Zhongqing, with his upright features and composed demeanor, did not think highly of this barbarian but still gave him due respect, politely greeting him.

"Great King!"

With a quick glance, he noticed the sneaky-looking Tian Rong in the corner. Tian Zhongqing was taken aback at the sight of him, and a wave of burning anger surged in his heart as he exclaimed, "What are you doing here?!"

Tian Rong quickly shrank back, remaining silent. Shamoli's expression quickly turned awkward, and since he despised Tian Rong deeply, he did not bother to create an excuse for him.

Seeing the expressions on their faces, Tian Zhongqing immediately understood the situation, thinking angrily to himself, I told him not to get too close to Shamoli... He has completely ignored my words!

Tian Zhongqing's heart pounded in fury, wishing he could slap Tian Rong to death right then and there. However, Tian Rong was Tian Youdao's only son, and Tian Youdao had not only been a great benefactor to Tian Zhongqing, but was also the pillar of the Tian Family. Tian Zhongqing had no choice but to suppress his anger.

He cupped his fist to Shamoli and said, "The family head summons you. Please come to Mount Lijing for an audience!"

Shamoli was immediately alarmed, trembling as he asked, "May I ask... what is this about?"

Tian Zhongqing shook his head and replied, "Just an audience."

With that, he cupped his fist again, waved his sleeve, and jumped out of the carriage, walking away. The more Tian Zhongqing thought about it, the angrier he became, but his anger soon turned to fear as he thought, My mistake led to our clan being sent west, but it might not be a bad thing... However, this Tian Rong is going to get us into trouble sooner or later.

Tian Zhongqing waited for a moment, but Tian Rong did not come out. Listening closely, he could still hear Tian Rong's complaints and Shamoli's impatient responses inside the carriage. Tian Zhongqing's anger flared up again, and he muttered harshly, "This brat will surely bring about nothing but disaster in the future!"




# Chapter 277: An Audience

Tian Zhongqing had left with a wave of his sleeve, but Shamoli's heart was clouded with dark thoughts and wild speculations. Meanwhile, Tian Rong, oblivious to the situation, continued his incessant chatter, which only served to make Shamoli even more anxious.

He emptied his mind and pondered, What does Li Xuanxuan mean by this? I have been minding my own business in Mount Yue year after year, not touching the Li Family's spirit fields or items. Surely, they don't have a problem with me... Could this be a form of intimidation?

While Shamoli was still lost in his own thoughts, the carriage came to a sudden stop. Tian Rong, startled, thought Tian Zhongqing had returned and quickly fell silent.

However, he then heard the raspy voice of an elderly man shouting, "The main family's orders have arrived. Great King, how much longer will you wait? Do not miss the appointed time!"

"High Shaman! Please, come in!" Shamoli responded quickly.

An old man with white hair and a face full of wrinkles entered. Despite his aged appearance, his eyes remained sharp and focused. This was the old Mount Yue shaman, Ahuici, who had surrendered to the Li Family years ago. Now at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, he was too old to make any further breakthroughs.

Shamoli glanced at Tian Rong. Ahuici, with a raised eyebrow, understood immediately. He unceremoniously grabbed Tian Rong like a chicken and threw him out of the carriage, ignoring Tian Rong's incredulous protests. Tian Rong fell to the ground with a loud thud and continued to curse obscenely.

Ahuici frowned deeply, leaned out, and scolded, "Even your father has to address me politely! What the hell are you shouting about? How did Tian Youdao even create such a useless son? He should have pulled it out of his wife and shot you on the ground back then to spare us all this trouble!"

These words not only left Tian Rong trembling with anger but also made Shamoli's eyes widen in surprise. However, he pretended not to have heard his last comment. Ahuici ended his insult by spitting on the ground before turning back, saying, "Great King!"

Ahuici was an old retainer of the Li Family. He had accompanied Li Xiangping in the westward invasion, and Tian Youdao had only been a lowly soldier at the time, saved by Ahuici on several occasions.

Tian Youdao had always referred to him as "big brother," hence Ahuici spared no mercy in berating and reprimanding Tian Rong.

Shamoli hurriedly responded, "Yes, High Shaman?"

"Get ready and go!"

Ahuici's demanding words made Shamoli curse silently in his heart, but he could only nod in agreement.

When he stepped out of the carriage, he saw that all the tributes and ceremonial items had already been prepared. Even without his command, the national treasury had been emptied. He nodded awkwardly before joining the procession, muttering grumpily under his breath.

"Damn it!"

————

"An Zheyan is quite perceptive!" a young man said.

The black-clad youth sat cross-legged as he listened to the words of the person below him, nodding and smiling as he said, "He quietly settled the remaining members of the An Family in Lijing Town, spreading the old vow of offering two mountains far and wide. Over the years, he has made some progress and has learned a lot."

Now that Li Xuanxuan was managing the family, Li Yuanjiao had been sent to oversee the Clan Affairs Courtyard. His fierce temperament made him well-suited for the job.

"Indeed, he has made significant progress!"

The youth below nodded in agreement. His demeanor strongly resembled Li Xuanling, exuding a sense of steadiness. This was his son, Li Yuanyun, who was a few years younger than Li Yuanjiao. Li Yuanyun lacked a spiritual orifice and had always stayed on the mountain.

Now that Li Yuanyun had married a woman with a spiritual orifice, he could no longer remain on the mountain. He had moved down, established his own residence, and spent his days reading, investigating past matters, and occasionally visiting Li Yuanjiao's residence.

Perhaps due to his lack of spiritual orifice and not cultivating, Li Yuanyun did not possess a sharp presence. Instead, he had a gentle and peaceful aura.

After a pause, he continued, "Shamoli's eldest son has begun his cultivation. He was born to a woman from our branch family and has been learning the eastern customs since childhood. He begged the family for the Li surname and is now called Li Jiman. He appears quite loyal."

Li Yuanjiao smiled and nodded. This news was indeed pleasing. He paused and then said softly, "I received an internal report that the cave dwelling with spirit spring on Mount Huaqian is rich in spiritual qi. I'll be going there to cultivate in seclusion soon. We don't have many opportunities to talk as brothers, so I want to have a chat with you before I leave."

"That's good news," Li Yuanyun responded warmly and smiled as he continued, "Too bad Sister Qinghong went to Mount Huazhong a few days ago. Now that you are leaving too, it'll be just me idling around in Lijing Town."

Li Yuanjiao shook his head and reminded, "Hey, Qingxiao and Yuanping are only four or five years old. There are only a few of us in the generation of Yuan and Qing. Since Qinghong will also be cultivating in seclusion soon, you'll have to keep an eye on those kids when you can."

Li Yuanyun nodded and said, "I'll be going to Mount Yue in a few days to investigate some matters. I can bring a few toys for the two kids."

Li Yuanjiao was about to ask him more questions when someone hurriedly approached, interrupting their conversation.

"Report! Shamoli is here to see you, my lord!"

"Shamoli?! It seems he has come to pay his respects and sound me out... Let him in then!" Li Yuanjiao instructed.

Li Yuanyun, understanding the situation, tactfully prepared to leave, but Li Yuanjiao frowned and stopped him.

"You can stay and listen. We are family; there's nothing you can't hear. Just record what Shamoli says truthfully without any reservations," he said.

"It is widely rumored that you're Shamoli's main supporter, so I do need to listen carefully," Li Yuanyun teased playfully before sitting down again.

A tall Mount Yue man walked up from below. His attire was proper, resembling the easterners. With a wide smile on his face, he called out, "Brother Jiao, it has been so long!"

"I have missed you greatly, brother!" Li Yuanjiao replied with a smile. Noticing Shamoli's gaze lingering on Li Yuanyun, he explained, "This is Brother Yuanyun, one of our own. He will be heading to your territory in a few days, so please take good care of him!"

"Y-Yes! Of course..." Shamoli responded cautiously, his mind completely preoccupied as he had come straight to see Li Yuanjiao, and was not expecting to meet anyone else.

He said carefully, "Why have the family head summoned me in such a hurry...? I feel very anxious and uneasy."

"Oh!" Li Yuanjiao waved his hand and replied, "You have done well over these years. My elders want to see you, and perhaps even the ancestor will meet you personally. It's nothing serious, so relax!"

Hearing this, Shamoli breathed a sigh of relief. He wanted to say more but noticed that Li Yuanjiao seemed rather distracted. Realizing his sudden visit might have interrupted a conversation, he smiled and said, "With your reassurance, I am relieved. The family head's summons is important and should not be delayed. I will go up the mountain first and come back to see you when I have time."

He then left hurriedly. Li Yuanyun watched Shamoli depart and, after a moment of thought, said, "Since we have his son, Li Jiman, Shamoli has pretty much served his purpose... Besides, Li Jiman might even be more loyal than he is. However, Qi Cultivators have a lifespan of two hundred years... I wonder how the clan plans to deal with him."

Li Yuanjiao set his cup down and replied, "No rush. Shamoli's cultivation technique is excellent, and his strength is decent. When Li Jiman reaches the Qi Cultivation Realm, we can still use Shamoli as a guest elder."

Li Yuanyun nodded slightly but noticed a peculiar look on Li Yuanjiao's face. He continued, "The Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique is truly extraordinary! It was once a Grade Four technique... Despite absorbing unrefined qi, Shamoli has reached the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm in just four years! That's fascinating indeed!"

————

While the two were chatting in the courtyard, Shamoli hurried up the mountain, not daring to fly directly. He walked along the stone path for a while before the small courtyard came into view.

Two clan guards stood silently in front of the courtyard. Shamoli, towering in stature, bowed his head as he entered and saw a middle-aged man dressed in gray standing at the top.

The middle-aged man had broad shoulders and was carefully wiping a sword with a rag. The sword had intricate scale-like patterns, reflecting a cold light. Shamoli stared at it in a daze for a moment before kneeling with a thud and bowing deeply.

"Shamoli greets the ancestor!"

Shamoli finally understood why serpent dragons had flown in the sky that night and why the Li Family had made such a commotion. With his forehead pressed firmly on the ground, he did not dare move, thinking in shock, Foundation Establishment Realm...! H-He... has achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm!

Li Tongya responded with a soft hum before glancing at him, slowly sheathing his sword. He began gently, "Shamoli, it has been a while. It seems you have been behaving in Mount Yue, and you've made significant progress in your cultivation as well!"




# Chapter 278: Reunion With An Old Friend

The turmoil caused by the Li Family had settled after half a month. Autumn took its hold on the lake, rendering the waters dark and mysterious. The banks were covered in red and yellow leaves, and a creeping coldness gradually set in.

The Fei Family, having gained benefits, kept quiet on the northern shore. Jiang Heqian, fearing ambush and revenge from Yu Xiaogui and Yu Yufeng, refrained from appearing on the eastern shore. The Yu Family silently licked their wounds, and for a while, there was an unexpected calm. Apart from the ruins of the Yu Family's market, which had fallen silent, the scene was peaceful.

"How are things progressing?"

Yu Mugao sat at the head of the hall, his face weary and gloomy, but his tone held a subtle note of relief. He rested one hand on his forehead, while the other tapped a brush on the table lightly. A recently opened letter lay on the desk as he addressed the person below him.

"Elder Xiao'ou is indeed dead. We have confiscated the properties of those accused of colluding with the enemy without much opposition."

A faint trace of grief crossed Yu Mugao's face. Yu Xiao'ou had watched him grow up. Yu Mugao had hoped that more of those useless members would die at Mount Lijing, however, he had not expected the Fei Family to break through the Jade Court Guarding Formation, leading to the loss of Yu Xiao'ou.

The Yu Family has lost many direct descendants and cultivators in the market, causing significant turmoil both locally and within the clan. Taking advantage of Yu Xiao'ou's death, who had been a leader of the old family, Yu Mugao took decisive action against his uncles and brothers, cleaning up the clan. With these parasites gone, the Yu Family exhibited unprecedented vitality.

"In a way... it is better. At least I don't need to persuade Father to give up the market anymore."

Losing the market left Yu Mugao feeling unexpectedly relieved. The words that read Azure Pond on the letter were extremely eye-catching, and he thought, The old ancestor probably won't return, and Father has gone into seclusion again. The family is finally in my hands, and without those fools around, it's so much better.

Previously, the family's resources had flowed into the hands of his uncles and brothers, and most of it was used for tributes and to support Yu Yufeng. Now, with these demands reduced, Yu Mugao found himself managing things with much ease. He doubted Yu Yufeng would survive but felt no significant sorrow in his heart.

"If we had rid ourselves of these people forty years earlier, and if Father and the ancestor had listened to me instead of wasting time with blood sacrifices and the lake meetings, we wouldn't have suffered such losses!"

Looking at the young cultivators he had promoted, Yu Mugao felt a surge of confidence. The Yu Family which was previously powerful had been divided, with resources drained by Yu Yufeng. Yu Mugao had no choice but to bow to authority then. Now, though weakened, the Yu Family belonged solely to him.

"After two years of consolidation... As long as Muxian remains on Yuanwu Peak, I can toy with Li Xuanxuan and Fei Yihe."

Yu Mugao slowly set down the letter, his eyes still fixated on the words in it that had been written with a brush dipped in red ink. The autumn sunlight bathed the paper in a warm light, seeming to cause the red words to gleam like blood.

The contents of the letter read—"Decades have passed without returning, nor have I sent any letters... Master once said that the demon king of the southern border feasts on moonlight; he is likely not at ease. Senior Brother is coming to the lake and I will enter seclusion... Foundation Establishment Realm is within reach."

————

"Brother Xuanfeng! I heard that a senior member of your esteemed family has recently reached Foundation Establishment Realm... Congratulations!"

Liu Changdie soared leisurely through the air, his eyes fixed on the golden glow of the longbow on Li Xuanfeng's back. While offering his congratulations, his eyes lit up as he thought to himself, That bow must be the Golden Age! In my previous life, I only saw its golden aura during a demonic attack while reinforcing the Azure Pond Sect's formation... Now, I can finally see it up close!

Li Xuanfeng laughed heartily and replied, "Brother Changdie, you are always well-informed. Thank you."

Liu Changdie observed Li Xuanfeng's aura, noticing that he had reached the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Envy filled his heart as he congratulated Li Xuanfeng, saying, "Brother Xuanfeng, you are not even thirty-five yet you've already reached the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. You might be able to attempt the Foundation Establishment Realm breakthrough by the time you are forty or fifty!"

Li Xuanfeng smiled wordlessly as he raised an eyebrow and responded, "Brother Changdie, you are also progressing well, already at the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm... The Foundation Establishment Realm is within reach for you too."

The two exchanged compliments as Mount Huaqian came into view below. Li Xuanfeng led Liu Changdie into the courtyard, where they were greeted by a nimble-footed youth in black robes who cupped his fist respectfully.

"Greetings, Senior!"

The youth's sharp features and slightly narrow eyes exuded an air of fierceness.

It was Li Yuanjiao.

Liu Changdie immediately recognized him and swallowed back the Brother Jiao that almost slipped past his lips, finding the situation rather awkward. Li Xuanfeng quickly introduced them.

"This is Li Yuanjiao, the son of my eldest brother Li Xuanxuan. He is currently cultivating on Mount Huaqian."

Seeing the young man before him, Liu Changdie felt strange. Nevertheless, he was

delighted to see an old friend. He smiled hastily and said, "Please don't call me a senior! I admire Yuanjiao's outstanding demeanor and wish to consider us equals..."

Li Xuanfeng gave him a strange look. While he considered Liu Changdie a peer, Liu Changdie wanted to treat Li Yuanjiao as an equal, which would naturally disrupt the generational hierarchy.

Li Yuanjiao, having just arrived at Mount Huaqian, was equally puzzled and insisted he was not worthy of such a status repeatedly.

Unable to refuse, Liu Changdie finally said, "It's fine when Brother Xuanfeng is present. Privately, Yuanjiao and I can address each other as equals."

Li Xuanfeng nodded, transmitting a message to Li Yuanjiao using his mana, "Liu Changdie is a good-natured person and an expert in formations. Though he can be eccentric, he is harmless... Just let him be."

They all took their seats as servants served tea. Li Xuanfeng didn't waste any time and asked directly, "Daoist Changdie, if we want to set up a formation on Mount Huaqian, what kind of power can we expect given the local spirit veins and spiritual qi? Also, how many Spirit Stones would it require?"

Liu Changdie nodded and replied, "Years ago, when I set up the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation on Mount Lijing, I also observed Mount Huaqian's spirit veins. The mountain lacks several key points and is relatively low and narrow... Even the legendary Wan Huaqian could only set up a formation to withstand a peak Qi Cultivator here."

He smiled wryly and continued, "I once believed I could match Wan Huaqian's prowess. But standing before Mount Huaqian, I see now that his skills in formation far exceed my own. My best effort might withstand the strength of a late-stage Qi Cultivator. However, if faced with an attack from a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, the formation would likely falter in less time than it takes for a stick of incense to burn."

Li Xuanfeng calculated the distance from Mount Lijing to Mount Huaqian and concluded that a stick of incense's time was more than sufficient. "That's long enough. But... how many Spirit Stones would it require?" he asked.

Liu Changdie saw Li Xuanfeng's approval and nodded. "If your esteemed family lacks spare formation flags, we will need to use a formation plate. With Wan Huaqian's legacy as a reference, I can set up the formation for about fifty to sixty Spirit Stones."

Li Xuanfeng, no longer the inexperienced youth he once was, knew that this price was remarkably low. He frowned slightly and asked, "At fifty to sixty Spirit Stones, would there still be any profit for you, Brother Changdie?"




# Chapter 279: Guest Elder

Liu Changdie simply waved his hand and laughed.

"To be frank with you, those fifty to sixty Spirit Stones would be just the cost. I am not after the Spirit Stones... but I do have a request!"

Li Xuanfeng quickly realized what Liu Changdie meant, and nodded as he replied, "Brother Changdie, feel free to speak. If it is within our family's capability, we will certainly not refuse!"

Liu Changdie paused to organize his thoughts before speaking softly.

"I have devoted many years to the study of formations. The deeper I delve into the principles and patterns, the more difficult they become. Acquiring a perception technique would double my effectiveness and allow for further progress. Unfortunately, despite years of searching in this region, the immortal cultivators guard their techniques closely... I have been unable to obtain one. If your esteemed family possesses such a technique and could lend it to me, I don't mind setting up another formation for you after completing this Earth Locking Huaqian Formation..."

Liu Changdie knew the Li Family possessed a perception technique called Spirit Eye Perception. He had long coveted it in his previous life but had never managed to obtain it. Since he had a good relationship with the Li Family now, he thought it was the right time to request it.

"Oh?"

Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow, causing Liu Changdie to feel a bit uneasy. Li Xuanfeng put down his tea bowl and thought silently, Could this be a coincidence? Liu Changdie is strange but has shown kindness toward our family. Not knowing his background, we did not dare invite him to join our family as a guest elder when we only had a few Qi Cultivators. I even recently discussed this with Brother Xuan... Maybe we should take this opportunity...

Li Xuanfeng purposely feigned hesitation, furrowing his brow. "I see. It so happens that our family does have a perception technique, but we have never taught it to outsiders," he responded slowly.

"It was presumptuous of me!" Liu Changdie immediately exclaimed, lowering his head in disappointment as he apologized.

Li Xuanfeng couldn't hold back his laughter and chuckled as he continued, "If Brother Changdie is willing to become our family's guest elder, we can lend it to you without breaking the family's rules!"

"Are you serious?" Liu Changdie asked eagerly, clearly overjoyed. He had consistently demonstrated goodwill toward the Li family, yet had refrained from requesting to become a guest cultivator, fearing that his excessive enthusiasm might be misinterpreted as having ulterior motives.

Seeing Li Xuanfeng nod, he grinned and clapped his hands in delight. "That's wonderful! Wonderful indeed!"

Elated by the good news, Liu Changdie felt revitalized. In his previous life, he had never been a significant figure and spent most of his life humbly trying to make breakthroughs, often being scolded and ordered around.

Now that he was about to become a guest elder for the Li Family, his voice took on a more eager tone as he asked, "I heard that the main family had moved the formation plate from Mount Yuting to Mount Huazhong. How well is it working?"

"Ah... I was going to ask you about that," Li Xuanfeng said as he shook his head and continued, "The grand formation on Mount Yuting was operating at mid-to-late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm, but on Mount Huazhong, its power has been reduced to early-stage Qi Cultivation Realm. Do you know why?"

"The formation plate is not effective just anywhere. If I am not mistaken, the formation plate on Mount Yuting was specifically arranged to match the spirit veins there. Therefore, simply moving it to Mount Huazhong would naturally reduce its power!" Liu Changdie replied matter-of-factly.

He waved his hand and confidently said, "I'll go to Mount Huazhong in a few days and adjust the formation plate. You can count on me!"

Li Xuanfeng thanked him profusely. After some more conversation and laughter, Li Xuanfeng said, "I'll report this to the ancestor. As for the matter of Mount Huaqian, you can discuss it with my nephew, Yuanjiao, who is usually there."

Liu Changdie and Li Yuanjiao both acknowledged their tasks. After Li Xuanfeng left, Li Yuanjiao turned to Liu Changdie and asked, "Senior, what kind of spirit materials and how much labor will you need? I will start preparing right away."

Liu Changdie's mouth twitched with embarrassment as he awkwardly said, "Please, don't call me that... I'll write down the requirements later so you make the necessary preparations, Brother Yuanjiao!"

————

"I- I dare not be careless..."

Shamoli broke out in a cold sweat, lowering his head and staring intently at the ground. His mind was in a jumble, and he was mumbling a few vague responses.

Li Tongya, who was sitting at the head, glanced at him and commanded, "Come forward!"

Shamoli quickly got up and took two steps forward. Li Tongya glanced at him twice over and frowned slightly, thinking to himself, Although the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique is indeed powerful, it also causes infertility. Shamoli indulges in wine and often engages in nightly revelries in his quest for offspring. It seems he also enjoys consuming various spirit materials in Mount Yue. His vitality is waning... If he continues like this, he won't last another hundred years!

Seeing Shamoli's timid appearance, Li Tongya thought of how diligent he had been over the years and advised, "You need to nourish and conserve your vitality. Do not overexert yourself."

Shamoli nodded repeatedly, though Li Tongya was unsure if the man fully understood his words. Having said all he could, Li Tongya's thought drifted back to the juniors in the family and mused, Now that I see what's happening to Shamoli, I should start finding some spirit herbs and elixirs to strengthen Qinghong's vitality...

Li Tongya was always considerate of his juniors, often prioritizing his own children after his brothers' offspring. He made a mental note of this and said, "Your eldest son has begun cultivating. He ascended the mountain and begged Xuanxuan to grant him the Li surname... He shows great potential. When he reaches the Qi Cultivation Realm, you should abdicate and focus on your cultivation in the mountains."

Li Tongya's words left no room for negotiation. Yet Shamoli felt neither resentment nor displeasure; instead, he was slightly moved and grateful. The gap between the Foundation Establishment Realm and the Qi Cultivation Realm was immense, and Li Tongya's politeness was already a sign of great generosity.

In the past, the high shamans on Mount Wu viewed Qi Cultivators merely as sources of nourishment. The people of Mount Yue had long learned the necessity of submission, and Shamoli was no exception.

"Thank you! Thank you, Ancestor!" he exclaimed repeatedly.

Li Tongya smiled upon seeing his obedience and submissiveness, saying, "I'm sorry that, as the ruler of Mount Yue, you will have to sit in a small chamber to cultivate when that time comes."

"I harbor no such thoughts!" exclaimed Shamoli, who had governed Mount Yue for four or five years. Knowing this was the moment to demonstrate his loyalty, he kneeled down with a resounding thud.

In a trembling voice, he declared, "If not for the main family, I would have perished in some forgotten corner of Mount Yue long ago! Now, I have reached the Qi Cultivation Realm and rule Mount Yue. What more could I possibly desire? I have no issue with my son inheriting the throne, that'll allow me to dedicate myself to my cultivation and revel in the spiritual qi of the immortal mountains. For this, I am eternally grateful!"

Upon hearing this, Li Tongya nodded in satisfaction, though his gaze remained on the sword in his hands.

"Good, you have grown. Stay on the mountain for a few months. In a few months, the family will need to catch a few demons... You will come along and contribute," Li Tongya said simply.

"I understand," Shamoli answered readily.

"You may leave," Li Tongya said as he dismissed Shamoli.

Only then did Shamoli slowly leave the courtyard, feeling his back drenched in sweat. He descended the mountain in a daze, his mind still fixated on the gleaming sword.

It took him a long time to regain his composure. He muttered to himself, "The Li Family now has a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... That is excellent news! I can feel at ease, and the main family will not fear my rebellion. I no longer have to worry about being discarded after use."

As Shamoli walked along the stone path, the faces of the Li Family members flashed through his mind—from Li Xiangping and Li Tongya to Li Xuanfeng and Li Xuanling, then from Li Xuanxuan and Li Yuanxiu to Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong.

He felt both fortunate and contemplative.

"Years ago, joining the main family was a spur-of-the-moment decision... Yet, it put me on this great ship! That single choice could have turned me into another's slave, left me as a corpse in the forest, or elevated me to the ruler of a state, soaring through the skies as a Qi Cultivator... Endless hardships and countless strategies pale in comparison to that one pivotal moment. The rise and fall of fate in this world are utterly absurd!"

At just over forty years old, Shamoli had experienced more ups and downs than most people could in ten lifetimes. As he walked along the mountain path, his steps became lighter and lighter, feeling an immense weight taken off his shoulders.




# Chapter 280: Changes in the North

Li Tongya watched as Shamoli retreated respectfully. After reading the jade slip for a while, he heard footsteps approaching as Li Xuanxuan hurried into the courtyard.

"Second Uncle, you called for me?"

"Yes," Li Tongya responded, putting down the jade slip before continuing, "I asked you to gather information about the nearby Foundation Establishment Realm demonic cultivators... How is it going?"

Having dealt with the An Family, Li Tongya now intended to find a few talisman qi for the generation of Yuan and Qing. Once these matters were settled, he planned to cultivate in seclusion.

He had asked the fox in the mountains about the matter a few days ago, but Mount Dali was demon territory. Even the early Foundation Establishment Realm demons were well-known in the demon den, backed by late or peak Foundation Establishment Realm demons.

It would be a different matter entirely if one of them was killed by a disciple from the three sects and seven gates; however, the Li Family was simply a clan. Killing a demon could bring trouble to their doorstep overnight, especially if the demon were the descendant of a Purple Mansion Realm creature—being that even ordinary disciples from the immortal sects must treat with respect.

Li Tongya had thus asked Li Xuanxuan to send people out to investigate and it had been some time now, so he called him in for a follow-up inquiry. The southern Mount Dali and the eastern Lixia Prefecture seemed hopeless, so he hoped there might be opportunities in the territories of the Golden Tang Gate to the north or the Golden Feather Sect to the west.

Li Xuanxuan cupped his fist and replied, "I have some findings. To the west of Moongaze Lake is the Golden Feather Sect's territory, separated by a small wilderness and several minor families. No demons have been reported there. Going further west would be too far and inconvenient."

"As for the Golden Tang Gate's territory in the north..." Li Xuanxuan paused, lowering his voice as he continued, "It's currently in chaos. Demons run rampant while the prestigious clans are trying to annex each other. I believe there are Foundation Establishment Realm demons to be captured there. I have already dispatched additional people to investigate further."

"Oh?"

Li Tongya, intrigued by the situation at Golden Tang Gate, asked, "Have you found out the cause of it?"

Li Xuanxuan nodded and replied, "Over ten years ago, the Purple Mansion Realm ancestor of the Golden Tang Gate passed away, greatly weakening their strength. They had to rely on Azure Pond Sect for support. After a few years of stability, the last Purple Mansion Realm cultivator vanished, and many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators within the sect also disappeared mysteriously. They could not even suppress the families and demons under their control, and this became particularly severe after Chi Wei's death. There are even rumors of devil cultivators appearing!"

Li Tongya remained silent, pondering for a moment before asking, "How have the other sects responded?"

Li Xuanxuan shook his head and answered, "Our information is limited. We only know that Azure Pond Sect has turned a blind eye to the situation, not sending a single person over. As for the other sects, we do not have much information."

Li Tongya sipped his tea and said softly, "Judging by Golden Tang Gate's state, the other sects likely have not taken any significant action as well. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator at Golden Tang Gate probably is not dead. At Senior Xiao Chuting's ceremony, I heard that Great Xu State, where the Golden Tang Gate is located, is now teeming with Buddhists, and many great powers are in conflict... Golden Tang Gate may have been caught up in this turmoil."

Li Xuanxuan acknowledged this with a nod and sighed, "With no one in the sect, information is scarce. We, the older generation, still have to rely on the generations of Xi and Yue to try their luck..."

Li Xuanxuan didn't have any strong objections to sending the younger generation to Azure Pond Sect, but Li Tongya felt uneasy. However, since having their disciples join Azure Pond was highly beneficial for the family, he had no choice but to accept it.

To change the subject, he glanced at Li Xuanxuan and instructed, "Keep investigating, and if necessary, write a letter to the Fei Family. Fei Wangbai is on the northern shore, close to the Golden Tang Gate, and his family used to be associated with it... He might have information."

"Understood!" Li Xuanxuan acknowledged.

There were two knocks at the door, and Li Xuanfeng entered quickly with a golden bow strapped onto his back. He cupped his fist and said, "Second Uncle, Liu Changdie has arrived at Mount Huaqian to set up the formation. It will cost fifty-eight Spirit Stones."

Seeing the confusion on Li Tongya's face, Li Xuanfeng continued, "I have also discussed this with Brother Xuan earlier. Liu Changdie is highly skilled in formation techniques, and it would be best if we could have him join the family. I previously tested the waters, and Liu Changdie wishes to become our family's guest elder in exchange for a perception technique as payment for setting up the formation."

Li Tongya pressed his hand against the table, contemplating for a moment. He was slightly hesitant, but he could not blame the younger generation for making their own decisions. He gave them an out, saying, "Liu Changdie has many secrets... It is hard to tell if that is good or bad. However, his skill in formations is indeed impressive. We still need him to set up the grand formation."

Li Xuanfeng paused slightly and replied slowly, "It is just a nominal position. It should be harmless..."

Li Tongya, being cautious by nature, was reluctant to take such a risk. He hesitated and then revealed some confidential information, shaking his head, "It is fine. As long as he takes the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath not to disclose it, we can lend him our perception technique. As for making him a guest elder... I have discussed this man with Xiao Yongling. According to him, Liu Changdie seems to have divination abilities, often predicting opportunities and gaining advantages. He seems to know a lot about various fortunes, which makes him... quite unusual.

"This man is so mysterious that even Ancestor Chuting keeps an eye on him. Although Liu Changdie believes his actions are discreet, he was quite conspicuous even when he was just a minor Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator. His exceptional talent in formations and his frequent travels made him stand out. There's no way he can escape the eyes of someone as astute as Xiao Chuting. On top of that, Liu Changdie is also involved in many strange occurrences and might bring trouble... It is not the right time to bring him into the family."

Hearing that Liu Changdie was so dangerous and had even caught the attention of the Xiao Family's Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, the two younger men felt a pang of regret. Li Xuanxuan was taken aback while Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow.

In the end, Li Xuanxuan sighed deeply and said, "Thank you for the advice, Second Uncle. I have almost caused trouble with my presumptuous decision!"

"That's an exaggeration..." Li Tongya waved his hand dismissively.

An awkward expression crossed Li Xuanfeng's as he remarked, "But... I have already agreed to his request and do not know how to refuse him now."

Li Xuanfeng, not as experienced in managing family affairs as Li Xuanxuan, had forged a friendship with Liu Changdie and felt awkward about directly refusing him.

Li Tongya, smiling, shook his head and replied reassuringly, "Give the perception technique to him, be generous and courteous, and tell him he can practice it. As for the matter of becoming a guest elder, just say that I am in seclusion and cannot give a reply at this moment, but you have decided to let him practice the technique first. He will be grateful and have no complaints."

Li Xuanfeng nodded in understanding, and Li Xuanxuan, stroking his beard, also nodded with a smile. "Everyone says that Second Uncle is composed and reserved, but they often overlooked your astute mind—steady yet decisive, truly a talent beyond the ordinary!" he praised.

Li Tongya clicked his tongue and waved his hand, chuckling.

"Stop flattering me, it makes me uncomfortable. Go and get the job done!" he scolded teasingly.

The two brothers laughed heartily and took their leaves respectfully.

"The last formation point!"

Thanks to the traces of the former Earth-Locked Huaqian Formation, the grand formation on Mount Huaqian was rapidly set up. If it weren't for the death of Wan Tianchou, the last orphan of the Wan Family in Lixia Prefecture, the formation could have been completed even faster.

Liu Changdie, directing a group of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators to carve the formation diagram, appeared quite pleased with himself. He was thrilled by the prospect of soon acquiring the Spirit Eye Perception, a skill that could significantly elevate his formation abilities.

He sighed inwardly with glee, thinking, Ah, this is the life! In my previous life, I was constantly hiding and wandering, gaining good Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivation techniques too late because I was already cultivating with various unrefined qi! I remember how lost and dissatisfied I was in that life. I was barely living!

Now, relying on the cultivation methods and experiences from his previous life, he had significantly enhanced his qualifications. Although he could not gain any major opportunities, he managed to secure a wealth of cultivation resources by assisting others with formation diagrams. Naturally, his progress was rapid, and he was rather satisfied with his current state.




# Chapter 281: Guiluan

Liu Changdie was feeling quite pleased with himself as the grand formation was nearly complete. He could already sense the subtle connections of spiritual energy forming within the formation and thought to himself, This formation is almost ready. With the help of the Li Family, once I master the Spirit Eye Perception, I can head north. The Xu State is in chaos right now, and going there might provide me with some opportunities.

As he was contemplating, he saw someone land nearby with a golden bow on their back and a jade slip in his hand. The man said with a smile, "Brother Changdie, I have brought you the Spirit Eye Perception!"

Liu Changdie was overjoyed and expressed his thanks repeatedly. He stepped forward, but noticed that Li Xuanfeng looked somewhat regretful as he continued explaining, "Unfortunately, the ancestor is in seclusion, and I could not find him. We have never had a guest elder in the family before, so I cannot make that decision without consulting him first."

"I see..."

Liu Changdie understood that Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators often secluded themselves for years, but he could not understand why Li Xuanfeng still brought the Spirit Eye Perception to him.

Feeling both disappointed and puzzled, he looked at the jade slip and asked, "And this is..."

"Oh," Li Xuanfeng seemed to realize something and raised his head, saying, "No one knows when the ancestor will emerge from his seclusion. I can't keep you waiting until then, so I brought you the Spirit Eye Perception jade slip to practice for now."

"How could I possibly accept this?!" Liu Changdie exclaimed, feeling both touched and uneasy.

However, before he could refuse, Li Xuanfeng grabbed his hand and placed the jade slip in it forcefully.

"Brother Changdie, you have worked tirelessly on our formation. How could I possibly delay giving this to you? This matter is settled, go ahead and practice!" he said with a hearty laugh.

Li Xuanfeng's words were firm, and he had, after all, handed over the jade slip forcefully. Liu Changdie, naturally cautious, instinctively wanted to withdraw but found that Li Xuanfeng's grip was like an iron vise. He could not pull away until Li Xuanfeng finally released his hand.

Liu Changdie was greatly shocked by his strength, thinking to himself, I used my mana unconsciously, yet I couldn't break free. It is no wonder that in my previous life, everyone in the city feared Li Xuanfeng. His strength is truly terrifying! In my previous life, Li Yuanjiao once said, 'Li Xuanfeng likes to kill demons with arrows. One demon general thought he couldn't fight in close combat and switched to attack him at close range, but Li Xuanfeng had merely laughed and grabbed it with his bare hands, killing it with two strikes!' I guess Li Yuanjiao wasn't exaggerating!

Li Xuanfeng noticed Liu Changdie's fear and quickly apologized, though there was a grin on his face.

"I have had great strength since childhood, and it seems I have startled you. My apologies!"

Li Xuanfeng's extraordinary strength was due to talisman qi, but of course, he was not going to say that to Liu Changdie. Seeing Liu Changdie repeatedly say "It is fine," Li Xuanfeng added, "Once you have taken the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, you can start practicing."

"Of course... Thank you," Liu Changdie said gratefully.

After Liu Changdie had taken the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, Li Xuanfeng handed over the jade slip and continued, "This perception technique is difficult to master. No one in our family has succeeded in practicing it so far, so please do read the content carefully."

Liu Changdie, full of joy, accepted the jade slip eagerly.

"No problem... no problem at all!"

Li Xuanfeng had also practiced this perception technique. Lacking a crucial heavenly material called Pure Essence Spirit Water made it exceedingly difficult to master. Seeing Liu Changdie's confident demeanor, his thoughts stirred, thinking to himself, The ancestor said that this man is shrouded in mystery and harbors many secrets... Perhaps he also knows the source of the Pure Essence Spirit Water. I must remain vigilant!

He cupped his fist and said, "Brother Changdie, if you discover any insights during your practice of this perception technique, please share them with my family. You will be generously rewarded!"

"Of course! Of course!" Liu Changdie agreed readily. Li Xuanfeng wasn't sure if he had thoroughly examined the content but could only cup his fist in return and left on the wind.

————

Within a month, the grand formation on Mount Huaqian was completed. Liu Changdie managed to restore seventy percent of the original power of the Earth-Locked Huaqian Formation set up by Wan Huaqian. It was more than enough to fend off late-stage Qi Cultivators. It also drew power from the spirit spring within the Mount Huaqian cave dwelling which circulated endlessly. This made it particularly effective against groups of low-level Qi Cultivators and could even hold off a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator for the duration it took to burn a stick of incense. Li Xuanfeng was very pleased with this.

With this matter settled, Liu Changdie eagerly went to Mount Huazhong to modify the formation plate. Li Yuanjiao saw off the formation master with mixed feelings of both amusement and relief.

"That man is overly enthusiastic, always dragging me into long conversations! Although he means well, it makes me very uneasy..." Li Yuanjiao complained. He was clad in black and was seated casually on the high seat, sipping spirit wine and exhaling warm air.

Hearing this, Li Qinghong, who was smiling brightly, blinked playfully. Her voice, light and pleasant, teased, "I rarely visit Mount Huaqian, and Brother Jiao has me listen to complaints. Maybe this person isn't the one making you uneasy. Now that I think about it, your big day is drawing near. It's quite amusing to see you so restless!"

Li Yuanjiao gave an embarrassed smile, realizing how easily Li Qinghong had seen through him. He stammered, "I wonder what kind of woman she is..."
𝗳𝐫𝚎𝗲𝚠𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝘃𝚎𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝗺

Li Qinghong giggled, holding her wine cup to her red lips but not drinking. She mimicked a middle-aged man's voice, sounding gruff and hearty as she said, "In that case, we do have a direct concubine-born daughter named Xiao Guiluan—who is excellent in character and appearance. She is surely a perfect match for Yuanjiao!"

Li Yuanjiao glared at her and, seeing her laughing to herself, said irritably, "You seem to enjoy this! Do you know how tormented I feel?!"

Li Qinghong's expression turned serious but she was still smiling softly. "I heard that Xiao Guiluan has already reached the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm... She is definitely very talented. Since they say her character and appearance are exceptional, what is there to worry about? You can't possibly ask for more when your wife has already met all these three criteria!"

Li Yuanjiao sighed deeply and replied, "No cultivator could possibly look bad. Besides, even the most beautiful face will wither after a century. To me, appearance is the least valuable attribute—it's hardly worth mentioning."

Li Yuanjiao drank some wine and began to speak his mind. He raised one finger and continued, "As for talent, being too exceptional or too lacking creates divisions among people... Being evenly matched is the best."

Lowering his finger, Li Yuanjiao's face showed a trace of concern as he said, "What worries me most is character. Senior Xiao Yuansi is an honest person, but when he says someone has excellent character, who knows what that truly means..."

Li Qinghong nodded thoughtfully and asked carefully, "Are you worried that Xiao Guiluan might be too kind? Or perhaps too weak?"

Li Yuanjiao sneered and replied, "Whether kind or ruthless, if she cannot read people's expressions, understand situations, or tolerate human nature... possessing any one of these flaws could bring disaster."

Li Qinghong fell silent for a moment before nodding in agreement.

"Brother, you have a point... but I still have one more question," she said solemnly.

Seeing Li Yuanjiao raise his eyebrows, Li Qinghong's expression turned sorrowful as she said softly, "But our eldest brother... he excelled in every way, yet he met such a tragic end..."

Li Yuanjiao closed his eyes and let out a long sigh, answering, "Excelling in everything only means you have barely managed to get on the chessboard to become a pawn in this great contest—a plaything for the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators."

Li Qinghong was momentarily speechless. She harbored dreams of pursuing immortality and longevity, but despised the behavior of the Purple Mansion Realm and Golden Core Realm cultivators. She remained silent, watching Li Yuanjiao drink his wine before he laughed and said, "Regardless, the future depends on us."

Li Qinghong nodded and smiled, "Alright, let me tell you, brother... I am about to condense the final chakra."

Li Yuanjiao froze, then slammed his cup down heavily and said angrily, "Damn it! Why are you still drinking here...? Go back to your cultivation!"

Li Qinghong laughed lightly before excusing herself and then left the courtyard. As she walked a few steps in the clear breeze, seeing the bustling scene at the foot of the mountain, she gripped her spear tightly and thought, Among all my siblings, I'm the most talented. In the future, I must be the shield for our family. I cannot afford to slack even one bit!

————

The Xiao Family was now a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan. The Azure Pond Sect had gifted them nearly half of Lixia Prefecture, and the northern Golden Tang Gate had ceded six towns to them.

Although the territory was not small, the population had significantly decreased due to the Azure Pond Sect's past practices of overexploitation. However, it was still sufficient to support the mundane members of the Xiao Family.

The terrain of Mount Xianyou was gentle and its spiritual energy was abundant. Since Xiao Chuting's breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm, the highest peak, Xianyou Peak, had been designated for his exclusive use.

The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had moved to other peaks, yet the spiritual energy of Mount Xianyou remained ample, easily sustaining the cultivators of this region.

Amidst the undulating mountains, a low peak was illuminated by the moonlight, casting a bright glow over the courtyard. The surroundings were intricately decorated with glimmering lights, giving an air of opulence.

In the main courtyard sat a young woman in green. She was without makeup, her brows like willow leaves and her phoenix eyes sparkling with life. Her slender, white hand held an ink brush, gently sketching on the cloth in front of her. In a soft voice, she asked, "All the gifts for my husband's family are prepared... Is there any portion left from the family's allocation?"

A servant nearby bowed and replied, "Aside from the nine chests of dowry, there are just over ten Spirit Stones left, my lady. I am not sure if that will be enough."

The young woman in green, Xiao Guiluan, brushed her hair back and counted, "The Li Family heavily utilizes external clans... Tian, Liu, Ren, Xu, Chen, and even Madam Dou—these minor clans all need to be properly attended to. Just over ten Spirit Stones are indeed insufficient..."

The dowry provided by the Xiao Family was actually quite generous, but after all the necessary preparations for the wedding, there wasn't much remaining. Xiao Guilan furrowed her delicate eyebrows as she asked gently, "Have you asked my father about this? Is he really unwilling to provide more?"

The servant hesitated before nodding, then shook her head with a hint of frustration. She lowered her voice as she answered, "No, my lady. There have been several occasions now where the people sent to the foot of the mountain could not even get past the front gate."

"I guess I can't blame him..." Xiao Guiluan mumbled softly. After all, she was about to be married to the west. She simply shook her head quietly and said, "A married daughter is like spilled water; he is naturally displeased."

"But... the Li Family is, after all, a prestigious clan... It is not a poor match at all! The old master's action is rather harsh," the servant said, visibly upset.

Xiao Guiluan smiled gently, explaining, "If I followed his wishes obediently and brought in a cultivator as a live-in son-in-law, it would add significant support to him. Now that I am marrying into another family, I might be flourishing, but considering how he has no affection for me, he would only feel that he is losing out greatly and is naturally unhappy."

The servant quickly fell silent, not daring to speak further. Xiao Guiluan placed her brush down and removed a jade bracelet from her wrist that glimmered with mana light.

She instructed, "This jade bracelet, which I have used since condensing my Profound Scenery Chakra, helps to calm the mind and absorb spiritual energy. It is a fine treasure. Take it down the mountain, find someone trustworthy to pawn it, and we can make up for the shortfall in Spirit Stones."

The servant was visibly uneasy and responded, "My lady... is this really necessary? It is just a few minor clans, they should be the ones flattering you instead of the other way round..."

Placing the jade bracelet into the servant's hand, Xiao Guiluan explained, "The Li Family has four branches, but there is only one family head. This requires long-term planning. You need not doubt my decision."

She paused for a moment after speaking and glanced at the cloth on the table, then added, "Make sure not to let anyone in the family know about this! The dowry that the family provides should indeed include a portion from Father, hence this shortfall. If he is unwilling to contribute, then so be it. But if the family finds out, he will be blamed, and it will stir up unnecessary trouble."

She squeezed the servant's hand and whispered, "The opportunity to marry into a prestigious clan is rare. We are at a critical juncture now, so let us avoid any incidents that could embarrass me."

Although Xiao Guiluan was of legitimate descent, she was born of a concubine. If she were to marry an external cultivator chosen by the family, the best she could hope for would be a Qi Cultivator, who would most likely be over fifty years old. At only seventeen or eighteen, Xiao Guiluan found that prospect unbearable.

She had seen the portrait of Li Yuanjiao. He was quite handsome, young, and at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, with the potential to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. Moreover, marrying into the Li Family as a daughter of the Xiao Family meant that she would be treated with utmost respect. The differences were stark, and Xiao Guiluan cherished this opportunity.

"Yes..." the servant responded softly.

Xiao Guiluan nodded, picking up the brush to record this amount of Spirit Stones as her father's contribution. Just then, there was a light knock on the door of the courtyard. Xiao Guiluan frowned and called out, "Who is it?"

"A servant of Master Xiao Jiuqing, delivering gifts from Mount Yu!" came the answer from beyond the door.

"Xiao Jiuqing..." Xiao Guiluan signaled to the servant, who quickly went to open the door.

A young servant kneeled outside the courtyard, not daring to enter, holding up a small embroidered pouch.

"A gift for the young lady!"

The servant took it and handed it over to Xiao Guiluan. She weighed the small pouch and estimated it to contain about five or six Spirit Stones to her delight. She responded, "Tell your master that I appreciate the generous gift. His contribution is very much appreciated!"
𝚏𝕣𝕖𝚎𝚠𝚎𝚋𝚗𝐨𝐯𝕖𝕝.𝕔𝐨𝕞

The young servant repeatedly acknowledged her, not daring to look up at Xiao Guiluan, and then retreated. The servant girl closed the door and asked curiously, "My lady, we have never had any dealings with Xiao Jiuqing from Mount Yu... Why is he being so kind?"

Xiao Guiluan covered her mouth with a smile and drew a circle on the cloth, answering, "He is trying to curry favor! He sees potential in the Li Family... or specifically, in Li Yuanjiao."

Despite her intelligence and wit, Xiao Guiluan was ultimately just a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl. Seeing her future husband being so highly regarded brought her a bit of joy.

She picked up the brush again and wrote the letter Jiao on the cloth, murmuring, "Whether he is gentle or fierce, let us hope he is not a fool."




# Chapter 283: The Wolf Demon

"A newly ascended Foundation Establishment Realm wolf demon at Mount Bianyan on the border of Xu State..." Li Xuanxuan muttered as he read the small note in his hand, feeling somewhat uneasy. He did not know the strength of this wolf demon, and if it had any backing.

The five sects of Xu State were constantly at war with each other, compounded by rampant devil cultivators and roaming monks, creating utter chaos. These sects could only protect a few towns under their respective mountain gates while demons ran amok elsewhere.

This wolf demon occupied the remote Mount Bianyan in Xu State, proclaiming itself the Bianyan Demon General and living quite happily.

After all, being a Foundation Establishment Realm demon and cultivating alone in the mountains, no one bothered it most of the time. Only occasionally did it come out to cause some trouble and devour a few cultivators, which then made its existence known.

Li Xuanling pondered for a moment and clicked his tongue. He hesitated, saying, "We need to ask that fox about the affairs among these demons... Let us first send this up for Second Uncle to see."

One of the subordinates stepped forward and took the note before heading up the mountain. Li Xuanxuan then bowed his head and began drawing talismans.

The Yu Family was currently in chaos, and the Li Family had just annexed two mountains, which required him to oversee the allocation of manpower and distribution of spirit fields. Li Xuanxuan himself was not of exceptional talent, so he often stayed at the foot of the mountain drawing talismans and managing affairs.

"The wedding of Jiao'er is also within these months... Doing it well is no easy task."

People from the Xiao Family had already come several times, led by Xiao Jiuqing. He was a very articulate man, handling many matters thoroughly and efficiently, saving Li Xuanxuan quite a bit of effort.

Looking at the congratulatory message handed over to him, Li Xuanxuan couldn't help but praise, "This man is eloquent and capable. If our family had someone like him, it would save us a lot of trouble!"

As soon as he said this, Li Xuanxuan couldn't help but think of Li Yuanxiu, feeling a pang of sorrow as he thought to himself, We should have arranged a marriage for that boy earlier...

"Family Head."

Just as Li Xuanxuan was lost in his thoughts, Li Xiewen hurried up to him, interrupting his mind. "Master Liu Changdie has already repaired the formation. He bade farewell to the Second Master and has left northward on the wind," he reported respectfully.

"Oh, I see. How is the selection of the Jade Court Guards?" Li Xuanxuan responded.

"Three are of the Li Family, one is of Chen, and one is of Xu. All are close and trusted," Li Xiewen answered readily.

Li Xuanxuan nodded and replied, "Make sure to select carefully. The ancestor will meet them personally in a few days."

Watching Li Xiewen nod and leave, Li Xuanxuan put down his brush and suddenly thought of Li Xuanfeng, feeling quite troubled. Cultivators who advanced in their cultivation too quickly often resulted in fewer descendants. Li Xuanfeng had no children and now shunned women. This was concerning to Li Xuanxuan.

"Although Donghe was married into our family, Jingtian only bore one daughter. Qingxiao might marry into the Xiao Family in the future. Given Xuanfeng's current state, does that mean he will be left without descendants?" Li Xuanxuan wondered out loud as he sighed softly.

Though he was the eldest among their generation, he was not dominant and knew he could not persuade Li Xuanfeng. He could only think of finding a day to discuss with Li Tongya about this matter.

The brush in his hand lightly moved across the paper, and the talisman under the tip of the brush shone brightly before finally converging into a brilliant light, flowing onto the smooth talisman paper. Li Xuanxuan chuckled softly.

"Done!"

This Qi Cultivation Realm talisman was a Shield Essence Talisman. The Li Family possessed two talisman manuals—Spiritual Talisman Method and Autumn Talisman Notes. The former, brought back by Li Chejing, included three Qi Cultivation Realm talisman techniques, one of which Li Xuanxuan had just drawn. The latter also primarily involved Qi Cultivation Realm talismans but were more difficult, and Li Xuanxuan had yet to master them.

"Drawing one or two out of ten talismans successfully is not bad at all," Li Xuanxuan said as he put away the talisman. Though his talent in the art of talisman was the highest in the Li Family, it was not particularly outstanding.
𝐟𝕣𝗲𝕖𝕨𝗲𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝗲𝚕.𝗰𝚘𝐦

Being able to draw Qi Cultivation Realm talismans relied solely on his hard work. Feeling satisfied, he smiled and said, "With these talismans, the younger generation in the family will have better protection."

————

Li Tongya was the only remaining cultivator on Mount Lijing now. Li Yuanjiao and Li Xuanfeng had been sent to Mount Huaqian, while Li Qinghong and her father, Li Xuanling, had gone to Mount Huazhong. Several external Qi Cultivators were busy below, slaying demons and overseeing spirit fields so that the main family members had time to cultivate.

The combined spiritual qi of Meiche Peak and Lijing Peak finally allowed Li Tongya to freely cultivate. The spiritual energy of Mount Lijing was not dense, and Li Tongya, having received the Deep Ocean Long Whale Talisman, needed to breathe and circulate qi like a whale. This made his cultivation more challenging than that of ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

Li Tongya sat beside a bed, carefully reading a purple jade slip, while Liu Rouxuan, with her head full of white hair, slept soundly beside him.

Li Tongya was now sixty-three years old, and Liu Rouxuan was only a few years younger than him. However, repeated failed breakthroughs had shortened her lifespan, leaving her vitality low. The Li Family could not provide any life-extending spirit items and could only watch as she neared her death.

Liu Rouxuan had little time left and, with her damaged essence, slept more often than she was awake. Thus, Li Tongya no longer secluded himself for cultivation and instead stayed by her bed reading, accompanying her in her final days.

"Ancestor." Li Xiewen tiptoed to Li Tongya's side, offering a small note.

Li Tongya took it and glanced at it, then nodded, putting it away. He covered the bed curtains before stepping out of the courtyard, saying in a low voice, "I understand."

With that, he rode the wind and left the formation. The speed of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was astounding; in just a moment, he had already crossed the dense forest below and landed under a massive white banyan tree.

It was silent all around, with not even a fox's fur in sight. However, Li Tongya was not in a hurry. He sat cross-legged under the tree, meditating. Soon, a fiery red figure flew hurriedly from the horizon and landed in front of Li Tongya.

"You have finally come to find me." The fox looked dejected, letting out a disheartened cry.

"You have caused quite a stir on the lake! We all know about it. Two more feeding grounds are gone, making the demons of the northern foothills quite unhappy..." the fox grumbled.

"What do you mean by that?" Li Tongya asked, puzzled.

The fox explained, "Those demons eat people. As long as they change form and enter the city quietly, cast a few spells, eat a few people, and leave immediately, no cultivators ever interfere. As long as they do not provoke the prominent families, eating a few commoners is easy."

The fox sat on the ground, spreading its paws expressively, and continued, "Since your Li Family rose to prominence, things have changed... Even going to a feeding ground to eat a few commoners is met with relentless pursuit. All sorts of tracking and illusion-breaking spells are used, and any careless demon staying in the city for a few days gets caught and killed. The more cautious ones eat and run, but even minor demons in the Embryonic Breathing Realm are pursued into the mountains by Qi Cultivators. It is utterly unreasonable!"

Li Tongya was left speechless. The fox continued its ramble, saying, "With your Li Family's rise, human flesh and blood have become increasingly precious in the northern foothills. Many demons are unwilling to take risks and have turned to eating other demons instead. With dogs biting dogs and wolves biting wolves, life has been chaotic. In the past six months, as your Li Family expanded again, these demons have lost two more feeding grounds, naturally causing dissatisfaction."

Li Tongya could only shake his head. The fox added, "I heard this from a pig demon in the demon den that it wanted to teach your family a lesson. I tried to dissuade it, but that stupid pig demon threw me out of the den..."

"I'm sorry to hear that, my friend," Li Tongya said, but he could not help but laugh. Nevertheless, the mention of the pig demon puzzled him. He asked, "The demon den and the Azure Pond Sect are from different factions. What can that pig demon possibly do? Lead demon soldiers to attack us, or use some cunning scheme to harm my family?"




# Chapter 284: News from Xu State

The fox burst out laughing, clutching its belly and rolling on the ground as it answered, "He is just a pig-brained fool. What kind of scheme could he come up with?! He feasted with a bunch of demons for three days, cursing loudly, then got drunk and passed out. When he woke up, he continued cursing, and after they had eaten everything in the den, they all went back to their own lairs."

Li Tongya was momentarily stunned, unsure of whether to laugh. He chuckled a couple of times, then saw the fox straighten up and say earnestly, "Your family is too righteous and too close to the common people. It always confuses me. They are just commoners... What harm is there if these demons eat a few of them? The common people are raised to be used, aren't they? If you do not use them, they will keep multiplying, eventually running out of land and livelihood, and then they will curse and hate you...

"I have lived by the shore for hundreds of years and have seen many things. Newly risen families treat the commoners well when they are weak. But once they reach the Qi Cultivation or Foundation Establishment Realm, they no longer care about the lives of these people. Your family, however, has never changed... You, of all people, should understand this isn't how it should be."

The fox rambled on, only to look up and see Li Tongya's face darken with a hint of anger. The fox fell silent, somewhat fearful, and shook its head hesitantly. It wanted to apologize, yet felt it shouldn't, so it merely watched him in silence.

Li Tongya sighed, suppressing his discomfort, and said wearily, "You speak too much, my friend. My youngest brother was made into someone else's food, and I come from a farming background, so I cannot listen to this. Our family raises commoners for our own purposes. You do not need to worry about it."

The white banyan fox, being a demon, valued Li Tongya as a close friend, but ultimately cared only for him. Seeing Li Tongya unmoved by its advice, the fox flicked its tail and said, "That stupid pig will probably come looking for you to ask about this matter... Deal with it yourself!"
𝒇𝒓𝒆𝒆𝙬𝒆𝒃𝓷𝒐𝓿𝙚𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝒎

Li Tongya nodded and thanked the fox. Allowing the demons to prey on the townspeople was out of the question, and Li Tongya already despised the actions of the Purple Mansion Realm and Golden Core Realm cultivators above him. If he let the townsfolk be devoured, how would he be any different from those cultivators?

Moreover, the formation of talisman qi required the support of incense and offerings—the greater the number of people under his rule, the better. According to the standards of the Sacrificial Ritual Method, Li Tongya already felt that the talisman pills condensed from the incense provided by his people were too little, so he could not afford to lose them.

Seeing Li Tongya's firm stance, the fox could only nod. Li Tongya then asked, "Do you know about the situation of the demons in Xu State?"

"Xu State..." A flash of fear crossed the fox's eyes, and it said in a low voice, "How could I not know! The expansion of Buddhism to the south terrifies us demons more than you cultivators!"

Li Tongya raised an eyebrow, and the fox, flicking its tail, continued, "Buddhism has these spells and techniques they call destinies or something. At first sight, they'll want to capture you! Once captured, they'll force you to become a vegetarian, and if that isn't enough, they make you their lackey, calling you a spirit beast... Who wouldn't be terrified?!"

The fox shook its head and stood up, saying, "Do not be fooled just because we demons in Jiangnan seem to be doing well—we gain spiritual wisdom and refine our bones, and we can call the immortal cultivators our brothers and friends, establishing the sixteen demon dens to stand alongside the three sects and seven gates. Purple Mansion Realm demon cultivators can roam the world and make friends everywhere..."

The fox paused and continued, "But in the north, there's no place for demons. As demons, we either die or become slaves to humans... There is no third path. We are all subjected to spells, made into spirit beasts, and spend our lives being trampled underfoot! If a demon dares to fly, regardless of its intentions, they will pull it down to indoctrinate it!"

Li Tongya was greatly enlightened by these words and, coming to a sudden realization, responded, "If that is the case, it means the demons in Xu State currently have no backing or protection. My family wants to capture a demon from Xu State, and we feared the risk of offending someone."

The fox laughed heartily, waving its paws repeatedly. "Nowadays, any demon with some background or knowledge has fled Xu State. Only the ignorant and naive ones remain in that place. Buddhism has already swallowed most of Xu State... Who would want to stay there?" The fox sneered.

"I see," Li Tongya now had a plan in mind, and felt relieved that the matter of the sacrificial demon had been sorted. His mood improved considerably, and he could not help but ask another question, "Why have no powerful forces stepped forward to stop Buddhism's southward advance? It is a scramble between different teachings, after all."

The fox shook its head and answered, "How would I know about you humans? Probably because you lost."

Li Tongya fell silent. His family had not even ventured beyond Moongaze Lake

and had no right to think about such grand matters. He took out some Spirit Paddies as a token of gratitude.

The fox, delighted, accepted the large bag and sat down to eat right away. Li Tongya then took his leave and rode the wind back north.

The fox, sitting there for a while, eventually hummed and climbed up. It dug out two spirit ores from a tree hole, moistened them with saliva, and mixed them with the Spirit Paddies to eat.

————

Li Tongya landed hastily on Mount Lijing, his heart troubled, thinking to himself, This trip must remain unknown to the Yu Family. Without a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator currently on guard, who knows what mischief Yu Mugao might cause? A quick trip with a swift return would minimize such danger.

That Foundation Establishment Realm wolf demon was able to conquer a mountain, so its strength must be considerable. I am confident I can kill this demon, but capturing it alive by myself... I'm not sure if that's possible...

Li Tongya pondered for a while. The idea of capturing a demon alive was indeed strange, and he could not ask for the help of another Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. After some thought, he decided, "Perhaps I should ask for the help of the mirror to suppress the demon..."

He then stepped through the central courtyard into the backyard. A white protective barrier appeared. Li Tongya performed a hand seal, and a small passageway, just enough for one person, opened up in the barrier.

This internal formation was linked to the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation on Mount Lijing and could only be unlocked with a secret method known to only a few within the Li family.

Li Tongya stepped into the backyard where the stone slabs were covered in moss, and the autumn wind had scattered fallen leaves all over the ground.

With a sweep of his sleeve, the leaves were piled up neatly. Li Tongya took a few steps forward and entered the ancestral hall. After offering more incense, he then entered the secret chamber.

There, on a stone platform glowing with mana light, lay a small, palm-sized bluish-gray mirror that was floating quietly. Soft white moonlight streamed down, filling the stone chamber with cloud-like mist, making it look like a celestial realm.

Li Tongya waved his hand gently, lighting up several mana-powered candles in the chamber. He kneeled and bowed deeply, then stood up. After organizing his thoughts, he respectfully addressed the mirror with a slightly complex expression.

"Li Tongya, the descendant of the Li Family, humbly requests the mirror to exterminate demons and eliminate evil, in return for a blood offering..."




# Chapter 285: Requesting Protection

In the world within the mirror, gray and white mist floated between heaven and earth. Below, the moon-white buildings were mostly repaired, with pavilions, bridges, high platforms, and palaces stretching endlessly. The rising moonlight from them created a rather ethereal scenery.

Lu Jiangxian leaned on a stone table, dozing off against its white jade-like edge. The jade pot in his hand shook slightly as a steady voice reached his ear.

"Li Tongya, the descendant of the Li Family, humbly requests the mirror to exterminate demons and eliminate evil, in return for a blood offering..."

Lu Jiangxian was startled awake. He stretched his body before straightening himself up. His divine sense emerged from the mirror's surface. Before him stood a man in gray, standing respectfully.

"Li Tongya..."

Having lingered in the Li Residence for so many years, Lu Jiangxian had watched on as the four brothers dwindled to just this one. Even though he had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, Li Tongya still respectfully recited the prayer while bowing below the platform, causing Lu Jiangxian to fall silent.

Of the four Li brothers, Li Tongya is the most cautious and suspicious. I have been with the Li Family for decades... There's no way he never harbored any suspicions! Lu Jiangxian thought quietly to himself.

Lu Jiangxian knew that the help he had provided during the Li Family's rise was full of loopholes. Initially, none of the family members were familiar with the path of immortal cultivation. Even if they had their suspicions, they kept their doubts to themselves.

Now, after half a century of mingling in the cultivation world, Li Tongya had seen plenty. Even Li Mutian, a mortal man, had suspicions about the mirror in his final years. Lu Jiangxian simply could not believe that a man like Li Tongya would have no doubts at all.

"He's already a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, yet he treats the mirror like a deity rather than a dharma artifact... The implications are obvious. Even those actions that seemed too deliberate back then have been beautified when Li Tongya recounted them to the younger generations. It's as if he's deliberately preserving the current relationship between the mirror and the family... He's truly a farsighted one!"

Although Lu Jiangxian was not particularly a deep thinker, his mental age over thirty years of waking and sleeping made him realize he could not outwit these cultivators.

He thought to himself, I have a long lifespan... As long as I stay hidden in this mirror, I fear no disasters. I only wish to plant and harvest talisman seeds, helping out as much as I can. If things go well, that's great. If not, so be it.

Li Tongya waited below quietly for a quarter of an hour before carefully stepping forward to take the mirror. Lu Jiangxian thought, Going to Xu State should be fine. When Zhi Wei and other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had passed by back then, they did not even discover my presence. There shouldn't be any issues.

He then withdrew his light, leaving the object in Li Tongya's hand appearing as nothing more than an ordinary, worn bronze mirror. Li Tongya studied it for a moment, detecting no traces of spiritual energy or light. With a sigh, he tucked the mirror into his robe and drifted out of the courtyard.

As Lu Jiangxian reflected atop the stone platform earlier, Li Tongya was similarly lost in thought. Ever since Xiangping had found the mirror in the riverbed, the Li Family had risen steadily to prominence.

Recalling the lines from the Reception Method—"When the time comes, I will remain true to my oath. With this talisman burned, I express my gratitude to Supreme Yin"—Li Tongya felt uneasy.

The Li Family had benefited so much from the mirror that it made him anxious. He thought to himself, I don't mind nurturing the mirror after my death. But what must I accomplish to stay true to my oath...?

As he pondered, he had reached the foot of the mountain and saw Li Xuanxuan drawing talismans in the courtyard silently. He stepped into the courtyard and called out warmly, "Xuan'er!"

Li Xuanxuan raised his eyebrows and looked up, replying quickly, "Second Uncle, did you find out something from the fox demon?"

"Yes," Li Tongya nodded and replied, "I have a direction already, but we need to send someone to the Xiao Family."

"The Xiao Family?" Li Xuanxuan echoed.

Li Tongya continued, "I am going out to capture the demons, but I cannot leave you all unprotected. Go and ask Senior Xiao Yuansi to come over if he has time."

Li Tongya's journey to Mount Bianyan was not far, but it would still take him several days. Although the Yu Family was likely tending to their wounds and unaware of Li Tongya's location—hence eliminating immediate concern—Li Tongya remained vigilant. After some deliberation, he decided to involve Xiao Yuansi.

He instructed, "Use Yuanjiao's wedding as a pretext to invite him here."

Li Tongya paused and explained, "Yuanjiao is adopted by Chejing, making him your Fourth Uncle's nominal grandson. As long as you explain this to Xiao Yuansi, he will naturally agree to come. This is also an opportunity to ask Xiao Yuansi about the current great turmoil in Xu State."

Li Xuanxuan nodded repeatedly, always trusting his Second Uncle unconditionally. He agreed readily before Li Tongya rode the wind into the sky, then instructed a servant nearby, "Get Donghe to come here."

Chen Donghe was at Mount Huaqian at the time, but he promptly accepted the order and headed east.

————

Li Tongya and Li Xuanxuan chatted in the courtyard for a while before they heard a light laugh. Xiao Yuansi stepped in, smiling at the two as he said, "Congratulations, your esteemed family has claimed two more mountains!"

"Greetings, Senior!" Li Tongya and Li Xuanxuan responded in unison.

Xiao Yuansi waved his hand, indicating for them to sit, and began, "Fortunately, I was not away or in seclusion; otherwise, you would not have found me so quickly. What is it? Do you need pills refined, or do you need some help with other matters?"

Li Tongya returned the greeting and explained, "Senior, the wedding date is approaching, and I am concerned there might be trouble. I should stay to guard the family, but I have urgent business in Xu State. That's why I have invited you here to oversee things, and also, I would like to inquire about the situation in Xu State."

Xiao Yuansi waved his hand generously and replied, "Sure, it's no big deal for me. It's just a few days of cultivating in a different place! As for Xu State..."

Xiao Yuansi paused. Noticing that Li Tongya did not mention the reason for his trip, he did not pry further and continued, "I have also consulted the ancestor about Xu State. If you are going there to gain some benefit or for an opportunity, you should make haste and keep your visit brief. In about six months, an immortal will intervene to rectify the situation in Xu State. After that, anyone visiting will be under close scrutiny. It will not only be restrictive but could also easily lead to trouble."

Li Tongya nodded gratefully. Li Xuanxuan could not help but ask, "Is this immortal intervening out of goodwill and because he is unable to bear the chaos?"

"There is no goodwill involved."

Xiao Yuansi shook his head and continued, "They are not stepping in because of the chaos and the people's suffering... It is because Buddhism is growing steadily. If they lose Xu State today, they will lose Wu State tomorrow. They fear their Dao lineage will be suppressed."

Li Tongya nodded silently and asked in a low voice, "Is it a Golden Core Realm cultivator taking action?"

"I do not know, but the situation has not deteriorated to that extent. There should not be a need for a Golden Core Realm cultivator," Xiao Yuansi replied as he shook his head and took a sip of his tea.

"The ancestor was secretive about it and did not go into detail. Most likely, they will send late-stage or peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, with Golden Core Realm cultivators overseeing the matter. If Golden Core Realm cultivators were to fight, the entire Xu State and even Wu and Yue States would be affected. Xu State might lose its spiritual energy for six or seven hundred years, with the earth veins destroyed. Even if they win, what use is it? They would be left with devastated, unusable land. Nowadays, it's rare for Golden Core Realm cultivators to intervene directly," he explained.

Li Tongya, thinking that the difference between Purple Mansion Realm and Foundation Establishment Realm was already significant, did not realize that Golden Core Realm cultivators were in fact this powerful.

Curious for more information, he continued, "If the Golden Core Realm cultivators are so formidable... can they not fight in the sky to avoid damaging the earth veins and disrupting the spiritual energies...?"




# Chapter 286: Mount Bianyan

Xiao Yuansi laughed heartily, shaking his head repeatedly as he heard this. "Everyone says that the spiritual energy which connects the heavens and the earth exists in the sky as various spiritual qi, and in the earth as the earth veins and fiery abysses. How could fighting in the sky solve this problem? The spiritual energy is intertwined with the earth veins, and any disturbance would undoubtedly affect the whole system. If you studied the path of formations, you would know that it is not that simple."

Xiao Yuansi paused briefly before continuing, "Years ago, when the three sects and seven gates besieged Li Jiangqun, they fought for three days and nights. Li Jiangqun was merely a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who wielded a sword with unparalleled skill. Despite facing numerous foes, he managed to sever the earth veins and spiritual energy of the northern shores of Moongaze Lake. It took nearly a hundred years for the area to recover... This shows the formidable power of Li Jiangqun. Imagine, then, the impact if the Golden Core Realm cultivators were to get involved—would it not shake the heavens and the earth?"

Li Tongya nodded in realization and could not help but sigh. "Golden Core Realm... who knows how many people, how many corpses, and how many years it takes to achieve it..."

Xiao Yuansi laughed sarcastically, seeming to want to say something, but he swallowed his words and merely replied, "Golden Core Realm is beyond our reach. As for the Dao Embryo Realm above it... it exists only in imagination."

"Dao Embryo...?"

Li Tongya was slightly puzzled. His cultivation method, the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra, mentioned only six realms—Embryonic Breathing, Qi Cultivation, Foundation Establishment, Purple Mansion, Golden Core, and Nascent Soul. There was no mention of the Dao Embryo Realm, so he was naturally confused.
𝒻𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘸ℯ𝒷𝘯𝘰𝑣ℯ𝑙.𝘤𝑜𝘮

Xiao Yuansi nodded and explained, "It is the realm above the Golden Core. It has been so long since anyone has been able to reach it that the current cultivation world rarely mentions it. Not only in Jiangnan but also in Mobei, Lingbei, and Jizhong... there has been no talk of the Dao Embryo Realm at all. According to the ancestor, no cultivators has been seen attaining this realm in this world for five hundred years."

Hearing this, Li Tongya thought to himself,

Perhaps the Nascent Soul Realm is the ancient term for Dao Embryo Realm... The Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra must be very old, so the discrepancies in names are understandable.

"Thank you, Senior. That's very enlightening!" Li Tongya responded respectfully.

Xiao Yuansi waved his hand with a smile, declining Li Tongya's gratitude. "You're exaggerating, it's just some trivial news!"

He then stood up and said, "If you are going to Xu State, you should leave soon. No need to stay and entertain me. I will just stay on this mountain and read alchemy books. Time always flies when one is immersed in those profound mysteries."

Li Tongya thanked Xiao Yuansi again and took his leave, riding the wind. Li Xuanfeng was already waiting in the air with his golden bow, accompanied by Li Xuanling. Several external cultivators, such as Shamoli and An Zheyan, were present as well. Li Tongya glanced at them and gave them a single command.

"Follow me north."

Everyone quickly responded and ascended to ride the wind northward. After a moment of thought, Li Tongya said, "I wonder how many subordinates the demon general at Mount Bianyan has... You all should find a mountain to lay low on first. I'll scout ahead to see how many Qi Cultivation Realm demons are with him. It would be best if we could capture them all in one fell swoop."

Everyone agreed and rode the wind through the mountains for a day. They crossed dark green lakes and dense forests, passing beyond Yue State's borders and entering Xu State.

The scenery immediately changed, with scattered white bones littering the ground. The roads were overgrown with wild grass, and there were no signs of human inhabitation. Occasionally, a flash of mana light would appear briefly, only to quickly retreat and make a wide detour upon spotting the group.

The members of the Li Family wanted to find someone to inquire about the situation but found no opportunity to do so, so they continued their flight.

There were many signs of past battles on the ground, with swirling mana light, chilling auras, or multicolored lights across the landscape. Occasionally, they saw the remnants of white bones and flesh alongside starved wolves and tigers, which was eye-opening to them.

The Li Family did not want trouble, so they avoided places with strange phenomena. Mount Bianyan was not far off, and soon the terrain rose, and the mountain came into view.

Li Tongya observed carefully along the way, finally finding a small formation in the mountains. He stopped in front of it and said softly, "I am passing by and have some questions. I kindly ask for this formation to be opened."

The formation was merely of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. When Li Tongya unleashed his aura, the person inside was immediately scared out of their wits. The formation melted away like ice and snow instantly, revealing a grand shrine with a lacquered gold plaque inscribed with the words—Zhenhui Temple.

An old man with a head full of white hair emerged hastily, followed by a large group of young boys and girls. The old man quickly kneeled down, saying respectfully, "A humble cultivator from the mountains greets the exalted immortal!"

Li Tongya noticed the young boys and girls all bore marks of ritualistic refinement on them and were kneeling silently like mute statues. He snorted coldly and remarked sternly, "You seem to be enjoying a good life. What sort of demonic arts have you been practicing?"

The old man shook his head bitterly, pressing his forehead on the ground repeatedly, and replied, "You have misunderstood me, exalted immortal! These children are prepared for the great king of Mount Bianyan... If I do not do this, he will consume even more people! It is merely a measure to balance the harm; to appease the beast's appetite..."

Li Tongya raised an eyebrow and replied, "It seems I have indeed misunderstood you. What divine abilities does this king possess, and what kind of demon soldiers does he command? Do you know?"

The old man lifted his head abruptly, a look of realization on his face. He then stared intently at the group, saying repeatedly, "Thank you... Thank you for believing me... That demon has three Qi Cultivation Realm subordinates, all at the third or fourth heavenly layer. The stronger ones were either killed by passing cultivators or captured and turned into spirit beasts. These three have just recently grown. The demon itself, at the Foundation Establishment Realm, rarely shows itself, hiding within a natural illusionary formation in the mountains. It sends its subordinates to gather food and has long been a source of trouble... Yet, no one has dealt with it."

"I see. You do not need to worry about this anymore," Li Tongya replied expressionlessly, waving his hand.

The group immediately rode the wind away, leaving the old man staring blankly at the children, unsure of what to do next.

A young cultivator approached joyfully and asked, "Old Master, does that mean we can release them now?"

The old man shook his head and said, "We still need to prepare for this year's offering... If those people cannot defeat the demon and the wolf demon eats them all, we will suffer without tribute to offer. Besides, these children have already been prepared and are crippled."

The old man picked up one of the vacant-eyed children from the ground, his expression indifferent as he said matter-of-factly, "If the wolf demon dies, we'll enjoy this batch of offerings ourselves so we won't waste them."

"Understood!" the young cultivator replied nonchalantly as if it was the most normal thing, and turned to leave.

————

Mount Bianyan was grand and imposing, surrounded by peaks that formed a large formation. It was shrouded in a thick and dense mist that could affect even spiritual senses. The lush greenery below seemed eerie and ominous.

Holding the mirror, Li Tongya could naturally see through the illusions. As soon as he closed his eyes, he sensed the wolf demon's lair, filled with chilling qi and scattered bones. He instructed the Qi Cultivators to hide and proceeded deeper into the mountain alone.

As Li Tongya slowly departed, Li Xuanling exchanged a look with the group and, having thought of an excuse, instructed, "Everyone, observe the battle. If it is evenly matched, do not hold back. It would be ideal if we could capture a few Qi Cultivation Realm demons alive. We have connections in Mount Dali to sell these monsters to a demon den and make a hefty profit, which we will share with you."

Hearing this, everyone immediately nodded in agreement. Chen Donghe, being steady by nature, remained calm, but Shamoli—greedy by nature and coming from the poor regions of Mount Yue—nodded eagerly, his thoughts already wandering into the mountain mist.




# Chapter 287: Slaying Demons and Receiving Talismans

Li Tongya landed in the mountains as low wolf howls echoed through the forest. Clouds and mist shrouded everything in complete darkness. Sweeping his spiritual sense across the cave entrance, he felt a strong wave of demonic and bloody qi.

Resting his hand on the hilt of his sword, he advanced, quickly conjuring a flame with his left hand and flicking it into the cave.

The flame rose in the thick demonic qi for two breaths before flickering out. Li Tongya gazed at the giant creature in the cave expressionlessly, gripping his sword silently.

"Why must you press me so hard, Fellow Daoist..."

A raspy voice echoed in Li Tongya's ears. The demon had long sensed Li Tongya's approach but had relied on the large formation to remain hidden in the cave without making a sound.

The dense fog of Mount Bianyan obscured everything, creating a desolate and uninhabited atmosphere that rendered spiritual senses ineffective.

Assuming that a proud Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator would dislike the trouble of a tedious search, the demon retreated to its cave, waiting for Li Tongya to leave the area.

To the demon's surprise, Li Tongya decided to descend into this area instead. Aware only that Li Tongya possessed some powerful dharma treasure, the demon dared not confront him directly.

The demon's voice turned harsh as it snarled, "I am a general under a demon king named Sanjun... I advise you to retreat quickly to avoid angering the demon king!"

"A demon king? If you had that kind of backing, you would not have dared to stay in Xu State!" Li Tongya countered, having gained this information from his secret meeting with the banyan fox.

The demon hesitated, realizing Li Tongya was not one to fall for bluffs. "You're a cultivator of the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Dao, not a demon-taming master. Besides, we demons often have dealings with cultivators... Why must you corner me so?" it asked.

Seeing Li Tongya unmoved, the demon's voice grew shrill as it pleaded tearfully, "I do not prey on cultivators or cause trouble... I live a solitary life on Mount Bianyan and only consume a few mortals when hunger compels me. It's the natural order of things! Why must you persecute me so, Exalted Immortal? Both your cultivation along with my demon power and intelligence have been hard-earned; why must we fight to the death?"

The wolf demon had cultivated in Mount Bianyan for many years where the practices from the north and south of Xu State intersected, hence it had learned much from both sides.

"I fled from the north and was fortunate enough to encounter a Maha or Dharma Master. He predicted my destiny, saying that if I cultivated in Mount Bianyan for a hundred years, a man would come to save me, bringing me great opportunities...! Now, the time is near. Please spare my life, Exalted Immortal..." it continued pleading.

Li Tongya ignored its pleas, silently accumulating sword qi. The wolf demon, realizing its pleas were futile, finally gave up hope and shot out of the cave like the wind.

A huge gray wolf, the size of a small house, appeared before Li Tongya, radiating intense demonic qi. Its ferocious green eyes burned brightly, and its thick, fluffy fur bristled. The demon spun around a few times frantically, trying to escape.

Li Tongya had anticipated this, drawing his sword instantly to unleash a brilliant sword aura that locked onto the wolf demon and descended forcefully. The wolf demon had no choice but to turn and face him directly.

Its expression was one of both shock and anger as it howled angrily, "Immortal, you are destroying my Dao!"

"...Not just your Dao."

Deep blue-colored serpent dragons appeared behind Li Tongya, which was different from the dark green water of Moongaze Lake. The waters of Mount Bianyan were colder, lending the serpent dragons their vivid deep blue hue.

The two serpent dragons snarled, moving menacingly as Li Tongya bellowed fiercely, "I want your life too!"

The wolf demon glared at Li Tongya, gritting its teeth as it remarked, "The Jing Dragon King, huh?"

It then spat a beam of green light which split into nine streams, shattering and dissipating Li Tongya's sword qi.

The wolf demon's Dao foundation was the Earth Shaman's Blessing, and it was powerful as it knew many secret techniques and nurtured a beam of green light in its chest.

When Li Tongya's sword qi was instantly dissipated, he was forced to summon two serpent dragons for aid. Despite the setback, his sword continued striking the wolf demon relentlessly.

Although the wolf demon was stronger, it had no intention of fighting Li Tongya as it thought to itself, This person doesn't seem to be a powerful sword immortal. He's just an ordinary cultivator, and these cultivators always group together. Killing one brings more trouble... I must find a chance to escape. I am just a small forest demon and cannot afford to provoke these immortal sect disciples!

With a long howl, four black shadows appeared from the forest below like a gust of wind. These were the Qi Cultivation Realm subordinates of the demon, who rushed up the mountain in response to the demon's call. Unexpectedly, several beams of mana light surrounded them almost immediately, revealing the members of the Li Family who now have them surrounded.
𝙛𝒓𝓮𝒆𝔀𝒆𝙗𝓷𝒐𝙫𝒆𝙡.𝒄𝓸𝓶

"I knew it! You've come prepared!"

The demon grew more frightened with its focus still solely on escaping. However, it was prevented from doing so due to Li Tongya's continuous sword qi.

It realized that while this cultivator was not an overwhelming threat, he was tenacious and difficult to deal with; clearly not someone who could be defeated quickly.

"Please, Exalted Immortal... Spare my life!"

The massive demon continued fighting Li Tongya with its green light, but was anxious and kept begging for mercy. It kept a wary eye on Li Tongya, afraid he might pull out some talisman or treasure to finish it off in one blow.

Li Tongya remained expressionless, his sword qi flowing continuously. He thought to himself, This demon is not easy to deal with. I could use the Qingche Sword or the mirror... but the mirror's power is too great. If it turns the wolf demon into minced meat in one blow, this trip would be in vain.

Li Tongya's spiritual sense touched the mirror, faintly feeling the power of the Supreme Yin Profound Light within it. He knew that if he were hit directly by one of the mirror's beams, he would not survive. Although the wolf demon was stronger, it might not be able to withstand its might either.

The wolf demon made a decisive move, realizing that its situation was unfavorable. It was not sure if there were any other Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators among the beams of mana light below.

With a long howl, it fired out another two brilliant beams of green light from its throat, but this time they were mixed with blood which made them stronger than the one before. The two serpent dragons summoned by Li Tongya were dispersed, and two beams of green light flew toward Li Tongya.

"Good!" Li Tongya praised, drifting back as he sheathed his sword. With his left hand, he gripped a tightly wrapped long sword behind him, unsheathing a cun of the green and white blade.

Buzz...

The swords in the hands of Li Xuanling and the others below vibrated uncontrollably, and the rusted sword fragments among the corpses in the mountains shook.

The wolf demon, terrified, gathered its demonic power and quickly erected a shield as it shrank back in silence.

"This cultivator indeed has some treasure!" it muttered softly and fearfully.

With the mere draw of the Qingche Sword, Li Tongya had managed to halt the two beams of green light. The sword arc from the Celestial Moon Slash shone brightly, clashing with a loud clang, knocking the beams askew and back to the ground where they dissipated into green sparks.

"Awoo...!"

The wolf demon's green light, a power it nurtured daily, was far superior to the two serpent dragons Li Tongya summoned with his Boundless Ocean. The broken spell caused the demon to spit out blood, staining the ground a bright crimson. Its demonic qi fluctuated wildly, clearly indicating severe injury.

Li Tongya twirled his sword, not giving the wolf demon a chance to catch its breath. The sword's glow split into three beams of white light this time.

"Threefold Moonlight!"

The Qingche Sword still contained a sword intent that had been nurtured by Li Chejing. Li Tongya didn't need to use a cow cleaver to kill a chicken; he only needed to use the sword to execute his sword technique. The Celestial Moon Sword Intent was fleeting but grand, making the demon feel like it was indeed facing a formidable foe.

The three beams of moonlight circled the wolf demon which were followed by Li Tongya's sword qi, forcing the demon to retreat step by step. The sword qi made its fur stand on end, and amidst the relentless assault, the demon repeatedly begged for mercy.

In a duel, the role of a Foundation Establishment Realm artifact was significant, especially an immortal sword that seemed to have gained sentience.

The wolf demon unleashed several spells, trying to ride the wind with its demonic qi, but the Qingche Sword struck it down each time, gradually leading it to complete despair.

Li Tongya, with his abundant mana, used the Qingche Sword to disperse the wolf demon's spells and suppress it. The demon, now exhausted and out of power, growled dangerously, "Why do you insist on destroying my Dao and taking my life today, fellow Daoist? I just cannot understand why I must suffer such a deadly fate!"

Its voice was no longer pleading, but instead was now dripping with hatred.

Li Tongya merely waved his hand in response. The Qingche Sword suppressed the exhausted wolf demon, who could no longer resist. The sharp blade hovered over its brow.

Li Tongya smiled and said, "You want to eat humans, so I will eat you. It is as simple as that."

With that, he struck the wolf demon with his palm, sealing its Dao foundation, then proceeding to seal its Qihai Acupoint and Shenyang Mansion as well. Just to be safe, he took out a few talismans and slapped them on the demon before dragging its massive body down the mountain.

Once out of the misty mountain, radiant sunlight flooded the surroundings, casting the scenery in a bright and cheerful light. Li Tongya landed at the foot of the mountain where several small demons were tightly bound—a pair of early Qi Cultivation Realm wolf demons, an old mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm wolf, and a peak Qi Cultivation Realm bear demon.

The members of the Li Family were in good condition. Li Xuanfeng engaged the bear demon in combat while the others handled the three smaller demons, eventually subduing the bear together.

All of them were seasoned in demon extermination, except for Shamoli, who, in his eagerness, sustained a heavy blow that left him somewhat dispirited. Fortunately, the rest of the group seemed unscathed.

Seeing Li Tongya descend with the wolf demon in tow, everyone instantly felt relieved. Li Xuanling said, "Brother Feng was about to go up the mountain to find you, but we stopped him."

Li Tongya nodded. With the presence of the external cultivators, he did not say much and only gave a simple instruction to the group.

"Let us return home."

————

Back at home, Li Xuanxuan had already made the necessary arrangements for the sacrificial ritual. The external cultivators were given Spirit Stones and dismissed. Shamoli returned to Eastern Mount Yue. Since Li Feiruo was pregnant, An Zheyan had paused his cultivation to keep her accompanied at the foot of the mountain.

The Li Family had not held a sacrificial ceremony for several years, making this year's ceremony particularly grand. The altar was divided into two—one at the foot of the mountain, holding a Qi Cultivation Realm demon, and one on the mountain, where the wolf demon and other demons were placed.

With so many eyes watching eagerly, the sacrificial ceremony could be understood as a local custom. Bringing a Qi Cultivation Realm demon to be killed could be seen as a way to intimidate and reassure the people. However, having the ancestor painstakingly capture a Foundation Establishment Realm demon general to slaughter on the altar would certainly arouse suspicion.

The atmosphere at the foot of the mountain was lively while the mountain top was much quieter, with only the direct members of the Li Family present. The round altar was polished to a reflective shine, and was engraved with intricate patterns.

The wolf demon, with its six senses now sealed and cultivation suppressed, was immobile, kneeling like a puppet on the platform.

Among their own, there was no need for any disguises. The altar displayed the gleaming bluish-gray mirror prominently, reflecting the moonlight and drawing attention.

"The Li Family of Lijing offers respect along with fine delicacies and wine with unwavering devotion year upon year. We exterminate demons to safeguard the fields, observe the three yuan festivals and six regular festivals, and maintain reverence, ensuring to pay timely respects... Through the smoke of our offerings and the blood of our sacrifice, we call upon the gods, seeking their blessings."

Despite its unwillingness, the wolf demon succumbed easily under the jade knife. The rising blood qi, mingling with the light-colored incense smoke, flowed onto the surface of the mirror.

Lu Jiangxian gently swept his sleeve, condensing the incense and essence qi before him into colorful clusters of light. He picked one up and murmured, "This is the first time it has been so plentiful..."

Almost like harvesting cotton, he lifted a strand of the colorful light, bundled it up, and condensed it into a blank Foundation Establishment Realm talisman.

"Li Yuanjiao... or Li Qinghong..."

Foundation Establishment Realm demons were rare, and those that could be easily captured without any backing were even rarer. This blank talisman would determine the harvest for a long time to come...

"Li Yuanjiao... logically, he should be the future successor to Li Tongya's position, suppressing external families. His cultivation talent is quite excellent, only slightly inferior to Li Qinghong's... Li Qinghong has a strong desire for the Dao, is diligent in cultivation, and has the highest compatibility with talisman seeds since the founding of the Li Family. It truly is a difficult choice..." Lu Jiangxian mumbled as he pinched another wisp from the cloud, extracting a gray talisman at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Gathering the remaining cloud, Lu Jiangxian thought to himself, Let's use the power of deduction to decide.

Lu Jiangxian, now far more skilled, had mastered many techniques in shamanic spell and talisman arts. He had used most of the power of deduction taken from Liu Changdie, and now drew another strand, using the remaining cloud as a propellant. Closing his eyes, he deduced for a moment and received only one word before him.

"Jiao."

Lu Jiangxian shrugged, flicked his finger, and the white talisman floated toward Li Yuanjiao's forehead. His vision darkened as he saw a jade-colored brush stroke sketch out the words—Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit.

The bearer of this talisman could absorb qi swiftly, command clouds, disperse spirit mist, and ascend freely between heaven and earth.

The thin writing in the second line exuded a chilling aura—Ice Bones Frosty Flesh.

This talisman qi could also enhance the efficiency of qi absorption, allowing one to command snow and ice, greatly benefiting the cultivation of frost-related techniques.

"The Li Family does not have any frost techniques..."

Lu Jiangxian glanced at the options, then picked the Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit talisman before sending the gray talisman into Li Qinghong's Shenyang Mansion.

After a pause, a dark red seal script[1] appeared before his eyes, looking extremely fierce and bearing the words—Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow.

The bearer of this talisman could move with exceptional agility, adept in both evasion and combat. Their bravery would be intensified at the sight of blood, enhancing their blood qi... making them formidable in battle and masters of wind manipulation.

"Not bad."
𝓯𝙧𝙚𝒆𝙬𝙚𝒃𝙣𝙤𝒗𝓮𝓵.𝙘𝙤𝙢

Lu Jiangxian flicked his finger once more, embedding the talisman qi into Li Qinghong's Shenyang Mansion.

A sense of curiosity stirred in his heart as he mused, This talisman qi is indeed peculiar, varying so distinctly in each person... This Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow talisman seems similar to Li Tongya's Deep Ocean Long Whale talisman. When Li Xiangping received his talisman, the offering was merely an early-stage Qi Cultivation Realm demon, yet he acquired the Evade Death, Prolong Life divine ability. While the quality of the talisman qi is significant, it seems like its recipient matters too...

# Chapter 289: The Wedding

Lu Jiangxian had just imparted the two talisman qi, and the auras of Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong surged almost immediately. Both of them were delighted, quickly sitting cross-legged to stabilize their cultivation.

The surrounding members of the Li Family were overjoyed as Li Xuanxuan exclaimed in surprise, "Two talisman qi!"

"These young ones have really made us proud!" Li Tongya nodded with a smile. The group completed the remaining rituals before descending the platform, waiting for the two juniors to fully absorb the talisman qi.

Soon, Li Qinghong was the first to open her eyes. Her lively gaze swept around her surroundings, and seeing that Li Yuanjiao was still meditating beside her, she quietly stepped down from the platform.

She cupped her fist to the elders and said with a smile, "Qinghong has received the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow talisman. Now, my cultivation has reached the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and I can begin to break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm!"

"Excellent!" Li Xuanling responded with a smile, hugging his daughter tightly. Li Qinghong then explained the various effects of the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow talisman.

After listening carefully, Li Tongya laughed heartily and said, "This talisman qi is excellent for combat. Our Li Family already has a formidable archer, and now with your spear, we need not fear any battle!"

Everyone laughed and praised her, and only then did Li Yuanjiao slowly open his eyes. He stepped down from the platform and announced joyfully, "I have received a white talisman called Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit."

"A white Foundation Establishment Realm talisman!"

The group had sacrificed a Foundation Establishment Realm demon, so a white talisman should be granted. However, it was not uncommon for the mirror to consume the offering and grant a talisman pill instead of talisman qi. Hearing this, they were overjoyed.

Li Yuanjiao continued, "My cultivation has reached the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and I just need a specific spiritual qi of heaven and earth to break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm. I believe that the talisman qi still has some remaining power that will further enhance my cultivation once I become a Qi Cultivator!"

"This talisman qi is excellent for enhancing cultivation, controlling clouds, summoning rain, and can ease the process of gathering qi..." Li Yuanjiao said as he explained the benefits he had received from the talisman qi.

Li Tongya nodded and instructed, "Once Xiao Guiluan is married into our family and the wedding ceremony is completed, you should enter seclusion to break through."

"Understood!"

Seeing Li Yuanjiao agree so obediently, Li Tongya nodded and asked somewhat anxiously, "Have you decided which cultivation technique to pursue?"

"I intend to cultivate the River One Qi Technique," Li Yuanjiao answered readily.

"Good... Good!"
𝐟𝗿𝐞𝚎𝚠𝐞𝚋𝕟𝐨𝚟𝐞𝕝.𝕔𝕠𝚖

Hearing Li Yuanjiao's answer, Li Tongya felt greatly relieved. He had feared that Li Yuanjiao, like Li Qinghong, would pursue the powerful Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique, potentially risking their lineage.

Seeing that Li Yuanjiao had no such intention, Li Tongya was spared the need for further dissuasion and nodded repeatedly, beaming from ear to ear.

"Excellent... Excellent indeed!" he praised once more.

————

Xiao Family.

The small peak was adorned in red, creating an exceptionally festive atmosphere. Figures constantly descended from it as the bustling crowd exchanged their congratulations.

Xiao Guiluan's courtyard was lavishly decorated and was absolutely beautiful. From outside, someone called out, "Congratulations! The Li Family is a sword immortal clan... Young Lady is truly fortunate!"

A deep male voice answered, "Thank you, Clan Uncle!"

Xiao Guiluan immediately recognized it as her elder brother, Xiao Guitu.

She furrowed her brow slightly as she asked, "Is Father really unwilling to come?"

The attendants around her shivered in silence.

Xiao Guiluan sighed softly, her exasperation clear on her face. "He's beyond redemption!" she murmured in disappointment.

Since childhood, Xiao Guiluan had already been sent to the mountain and received no care or concern from her father, who only wanted her to break through the Qi Cultivation Realm quickly and serve the family.

Xiao Guiluan saw him only as a figurehead in the family. To her dismay, the man was heartless, leaving her to fend for herself. She gave up impressing him and instead demonstrated her intelligence and shrewdness before the elders in the main family.

Fortune had finally smiled upon her, and after many years of no outside marriages from the Xiao Family, Xiao Guiluan was finally chosen as a bride to be married off. Her father, in his foolish rage upon hearing the news, seemed ready to sever ties with his own daughter.

However, Xiao Guiluan felt no anger, only deep sorrow in her heart. Without support from her natal family, her life in the Li Family would be challenging.

Composing herself, Xiao Guiluan quickly adjusted her red dress, its golden edges shimmering in the bright sunlight. She gazed into the bronze mirror, lightly pressing her red lips together and applying some rouge. Her already outstanding appearance became even more striking with this added touch.

"My lady, there are only very few in the prefecture who can match your beauty!" the servant beside her praised proudly.

Xiao Guiluan simply shook her head gently and said softly, "Stop with the flattery..."

"Sister..."

Xiao Guitu walked slowly into the courtyard. Although he was a legitimate son, he treated his younger siblings well and had come today to see Xiao Guiluan off.

"Thank you, brother!" Xiao Guiluan said as she expressed her gratitude earnestly.

Xiao Guitu understood what she meant by this and shook his head, replying, "Do not worry about the family. The marriage has been personally arranged by a Daoist Master, and so I will be here to support you."

"A Daoist Master arranged this?" Xiao Guiluan repeated, taken aback, and her heart filled with joy. Her mind raced and she felt reassured instantly, saying happily, "Thank you for telling me this, brother!"

As they talked, a boy of about ten years old, dressed in red which was embroidered with gold thread, approached them while holding a white jade disk with a hole in the center.

In a childish voice, he said, "Madam, it is time to depart!"

The jade disk symbolized the joyous union, a tradition in the Lixia region. It required a boy from the bride's family to carry the jade disk and accompany the bridal sedan, personally handing it to the groom. In return, the groom would give gifts and money, or in the case of cultivators, spirit items and dharma artifacts.

The boy, named Xiao Xian, was chosen by Xiao Guiluan herself. He was the eldest son of Xiao Jiuqing, who had provided Spirit Stones for Xiao Guiluan's dowry. Not wanting to be indebted to Xiao Jiuqing, Xiao Guiluan picked Xiao Xian to ensure the gifts from the Li Family would repay the favor.

"All right," Xiao Guiluan replied with a sweet smile. Knowing that a Daoist Master had arranged the marriage gave her newfound confidence, and her expression brightened. Her phoenix eyes sparkled with hope as she took Xiao Xian's hand and left the courtyard, only to find someone standing in front of the bridal sedan.

This person exuded a gentle aura, with a series of medicine pouches hanging from his waist as he held a scroll on alchemy in his hand. He glanced at Xiao Guiluan's appearance and smiled, saying, "You look well-dressed. Time to get on the sedan!"

"Greetings, Clan Uncle!"

"Greetings, Senior!"

Immediately, everyone around them kneeled, bowing deeply.

Xiao Guiluan's mind went blank for a moment, then filled with joy as she thought to herself, A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator escorting the sedan... such grand honor!

Seeing everyone trembling around him, Xiao Yuansi cocked an eyebrow and shook his head. Having learned from the Li Family that Li Yuanjiao had been secretly adopted by his junior brother, he was even more interested in this marriage. Since he was already at the Li Family's place, he had decided to come and escort her himself.

Xiao Guiluan nodded repeatedly, quickly lifting Xiao Xian and settling into the sedan, her heart filled with anticipation and anxiety.




# Chapter 290: Receiving the Bride

Meanwhile on Mount Lijing...

The side courtyard was meticulously cleaned, and Li Jingtian set up a wooden frame to air out the wooden tablets under the clear weather. As she carefully arranged them, a little girl of about seven or eight years old, dressed in a festive red dress with gold patterns, hurried into the inner courtyard. She held a brocade pouch in her hand and asked cheerfully, "Mother! When is Brother Jiao going to pick up the bride?"

Li Jingtian lifted Li Qingxiao into her arms as she looked at the sky. "It's almost time. Get ready and we'll go down the mountain together," she replied with a gentle smile.

"Oh..."

Li Qingxiao was already eight years old. Earlier in the year, it was discovered that she possessed a spiritual orifice, much to Li Jingtian's delight. They quickly had her begin cultivating and many people had come to congratulate them. Even Chen Donghe was quite pleased. The couple closed the courtyard and watched Li Qingxiao cultivate for a while, but quickly noticed that something was off.

Given Chen Donghe's talent and the fact that the Li Family descended from Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, Li Qingxiao's talent should be rather remarkable. However, after observing her for a while, they found her aptitude to be lacking.

The Profound Scenery Chakra required the condensation of eighty-one wisps of spiritual qi, but it took Li Qingxiao nearly half a month to condense just a wisp.

At this rate, it would take Li Qingxiao over three years to even have a chance at forming the Profound Scenery Chakra, similar to the descendants of external cultivators from the foot of the mountain.

Moreover, Li Qingxiao was cultivating the Supreme Jade Meridian Nourishment Technique that Li Tongya had brought back from Lingyanzi. It was specifically reserved for their own cultivators who did not receive a talisman seed, which was better than what those external cultivators practiced. Otherwise, it would be even slower.

The couple sat facing each other, pondering for a long time. Looking at the other members of the Yuan and Qing generation, Chen Donghe began to feel guilty. He was convinced that his Chen Family's inferior lineage had hindered Qingxiao's progress.

Hearing Li Qingxiao's acknowledgment, Li Jingtian reminded her, "When the Xiao Family's boy hands the jade ring to Brother Jiao, give him the brocade pouch and say something nice. It's just a custom, but remember what you need to do so you don't embarrass yourself."

Li Qingxiao nodded obediently. Li Jingtian picked up a wooden box beside her and explained, "The journey will be long, so I prepared some pastries for you to eat in the carriage so you will not be hungry."

Li Qingxiao took the wooden box in her hands and blinked her eyes innocently.

"Mother, I heard that I will have to marry into the Xiao Family like sister-in-law someday..." she said suddenly.

Li Jingtian paused, her expression complex and rather strained. She gave a vague and simple response to her daughter.

"It's still too early to talk about this... There's still over ten years until that happens, who can say for sure?"

Li Qingxiao nodded with a smile. "If I have to be married into the Xiao Family, you must choose someone who will treat me well, Mother..."

Li Jingtian merely held her daughter's hand in response, her voice tinged with sadness.

"Go on now... Don't keep your brother waiting."

————

The foot of the Li Family's mountain was bustling with activity. Lanterns and festive decorations were everywhere, creating a spectacle grander than the Lu Family's wedding years ago.

Red silk was hung all around, and the sound of suona music echoed joyfully along the roads. The mountain and its base brimmed with a festive atmosphere of joyful celebration.

After conquering Mount Huazhong and Mount Yuting for over half a year, the Li Family's territory had nearly doubled. Li Xuanxuan planned to establish seven towns below Mount Huazhong and Mount Yuting, adding to the four towns under Lijing and the three under Huaqian, making a total of fourteen towns.

This expansion would bring about a surge of both land and labor, providing ample opportunities for the previously crowded townsfolk, and rejuvenating the Li Family.

Similar to the golden era brought on by the conquest of Huaqian, the Li Family's lower-ranking members once again found opportunities to rise. The seven towns were teeming with ambition and progress.

As long as one was not a lazy idler, hard work would always yield land or a fortune. The people didn't ask for much; they simply longed for survival. Hence, these opportunities were great luxuries to them.

The stagnation and deadlock caused by the increasing number of Li Family descendants and prominent families had been thrown into oblivion. The wealth and military merits brought by external conquests allowed more talents and prominent families to emerge.

"The wind is rising, and changes are bound to come... Five prominent clans have emerged from the seven towns, and another seven towns have sprung up in the north. Many are striving to make a name for themselves..."

Li Yuanjiao, at the center of it all, adjusted the gold patterns on his red sleeves. As the head of the Clan Affairs Courtyard, he was well aware of the Li Family's movements. Adjusting his wedding robes, he smiled contentedly.

"Good times are ahead."

Since Li Tongya had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and the marriage alliance with the Xiao Family was confirmed, defeating the An Family in the north had become inevitable. From the Foundation Establishment Realm ancestor and Qi Cultivators to the prominent families and common folk, everyone eagerly anticipated this.

With all levels of society benefiting and the Xiao Family personally marrying off their daughter, support and reverence for the Li Family grew. Li Yuanjiao noticed this and felt delighted. The clan uncles around him assumed he was happy about the wedding and offered their congratulations, while only his half-brothers exchanged silent smiles.

As the time approached, Li Yuanjiao and his group mounted their horses, following tradition to welcome the Xiao Family. Fortunately, the Xiao and Li families were not too far apart, and the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators had remarkable stamina. If the distance had been greater, they would have had to send someone to fly Xiao Guiluan over.

The Guli Road had been renovated twice, with the Xiao Family preparing relay stations and smooth roads along the way. Due to him being at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, Li Yuanjiao did not need to rest, however, many of the Li Family men were ordinary mortals, so they had to take several days to reach Lixia Prefecture.

Xiao Guiluan had descended the mountain and was waiting in the prefecture, sitting in her sedan until word came that the groom had arrived.

The group arrived to receive Xiao Guiluan, waiting at the foot of the mountain. The Xiao Family's procession finally appeared in the distance. Red flower petals were scattered everywhere. Li Yuanjiao waited patiently, watching as the lavish bridal sedan approached.

A boy of about ten, also dressed festively, jumped down, holding a round jade disk as he announced, "The phoenix sings, thriving through five generations with radiant peach blossoms, a perfect union for a thousand years... May your home be prosperous, your union harmonious."

After the boy had finished speaking, Li Yuanjiao thanked him before taking the jade disk. A little girl then emerged from the group behind him.

It was Li Qingxiao.

The child seemed a bit weary from the long carriage ride but remained well-behaved, not crying or fussing at all. She smiled and handed a brocade pouch to Xiao Xian before leading him into the carriage, leaving Xiao Guiluan alone in the wedding sedan.
𝒻𝑟𝘦𝘦𝘸ℯ𝒷𝑛𝘰𝓋ℯ𝘭.𝘤𝘰𝘮

Li Yuanjiao dismounted, offering incense and wine, performing all the Xiao Family's rituals meticulously for two hours. Finally, with a nod, he mounted his horse and rode beside the bridal sedan leisurely toward the Li Family.

Finally having a moment to himself, Li Yuanjiao glanced briefly at the sedan, refraining from using his spiritual sense. He carefully observed the graceful silhouette projected on the curtain and spoke in a soft voice.

"Fortunate to meet you."

The silhouette paused as the figure raised a round fan. A clear, bright voice came from behind the curtain, light and gentle.

"I have been waiting."

Li Qingxiao pulled Xiao Xian into the carriage, and then finally let go of his hand. She slumped into the seat, her small face showing signs of discomfort as she muttered quietly to herself.

Xiao Xian, his palms still sweaty from being held all the way to the carriage, asked awkwardly, "What else do I need to do?"

"My mother said we just need to return on this carriage," Li Qingxiao replied with a frown. The bumpy ride had made her feel unwell, so she lay down and endured it silently with her lips pressed tightly together.

Xiao Xian could only sit next to her quietly as well, leaning against the carriage wall. After having been up since early in the morning and kept busy for hours, he felt hungry. He reached for the pastries he had brought, but to his dismay, found that they had been crushed and scattered during the commotion. Sighing, the boy leaned back and closed his eyes, soon drifting asleep.

When he awoke, it was dusk. Xiao Xian noticed that Li Qingxiao seemed much better now, and was peering out the window. Seeing him awake, she nudged him and said in a childish voice, "My name is Li Qingxiao."

"I am Xiao Xian from Mount Yu," Xiao Xian replied. The girl nodded and lay back down as the boy's face twisted in discomfort from his hunger.

"Lady... do you have anything to eat?" he asked shyly, a flush creeping up his neck.

Li Qingxiao was momentarily stunned but then nodded. She retrieved a wooden box from under the carriage seat and handed it to Xiao Xian. He gratefully took it, unfastened the wooden latch, and opened the lid to find neatly arranged pastries. All of them bore small red flower marks on them, making them look extra appetizing.

Xiao Xian, feeling famished, quickly ate three pieces, savoring their fragrant sweetness. "Delicious!" he mumbled in sheer delight.

He continued to eat, but after three more pieces, the lid of the box snapped shut. Li Qingxiao's small, fair hand rested on the box, her brow furrowed. She said in a childish voice, "The road to Mount Lijing will get bumpier. If you eat too much now, you might throw up later. There are still several hours to go, so save some."

Since it was someone else's food, Xiao Xian could only nod obediently. Li Qingxiao giggled and then asked in a low voice, "I heard that our families are related by marriage... Brother Xian, tell me, do you have any good brothers in the Xiao Family? I would like to hear about them."

Xiao Xian looked at her, feeling a strange stir in his heart. "Brother Guitu is the oldest in my generation. He is exceptional in everything... and condensed the Profound Scenery Chakra at just eight years old," he replied thoughtfully.

Li Qingxiao's expression darkened slightly as she responded, "My cultivation is very slow... I have not even condensed the Profound Scenery Chakra yet."

Xiao Xian, whose talent was also not exceptional, felt a sense of camaraderie. He sighed as he said, "I am the same. All the elders focus on those born prodigies... everyone wants to be a genius. They were just lucky! Life is really unfair... Doesn't help the fact that I'm dumb. Unlike my older brothers who can get things right on their first try, I need to hear the same instructions twice, sometimes even three times, only to barely understand them."

After he finished, Li Qingxiao simply snorted and said, "We are born into prestigious clans, with many people below us. How can we possibly complain about unfairness? Likewise, I was born to marry into your Xiao Family; there's nothing I can do about it either."

Xiao Xian was momentarily stunned before he laughed awkwardly, scratching his head. After this exchange, the two began chatting, discussing everything from sword immortals to the Purple Mansion Realm, and from the Purple Mansion Realm to Wu and Yue States.

Xiao Xian grew more familiar with Li Qingxiao, calling her "little sister" at every turn which made her laugh joyously.

As the mountain road became increasingly bumpy, Li Qingxiao fell silent from discomfort, and Xiao Xian had nothing more to say. They both endured the ride quietly, both eventually falling into a deep sleep.

Half-asleep, Xiao Xian found himself holding Li Qingxiao who was swaying back and forth with the carriage. He could not help but grumble, "Your Li Family really doesn't know how to enjoy a good life... I don't expect having fabric cushion on this carriage to block the summer heat, but how is there not even a formation to absorb the shocks? We are supposed to be cultivators, yet we are being tossed around like mortals..."

Li Qingxiao cleared her throat and replied through gritted teeth, "Our family does not go for that sort of thing. Seeking comfort is considered a crime and will get you dragged to the Clan Affairs Courtyard for a whipping!"

Xiao Xian was taken aback and simply responded, "Being born into your family is truly unfortunate..."

"Hmph!" Li Qingxiao snorted, and they both fell silent. After about two hours, Xiao Xian, still drowsy, felt his palm grow warm. Li Qingxiao had laid her head on his hand. Before he could react, he felt a sudden wetness on his palms—she had vomited... on him.

"Damn it..." Xiao Xian swore groggily, opening his eyes to see Li Qingxiao's face heavily flushed as she tried to clean up hastily.

He looked at her and teased, "How old are you to still be drinking milk?"

"Shut up!" Li Qingxiao grumbled, though her voice was as soft as a mosquito's buzz.

—————

The carriage moved leisurely along the path. Li Yuanjiao, unaware of the discomfort Li Qingxiao and Xiao Xian were experiencing inside, rode his horse beside Xiao Guiluan's bridal sedan.

Glancing at the woman inside, he asked softly, "Are you familiar with the situation within my family, my dear?"

"I know a bit about it," Xiao Guiluan, conversing with her husband for the very first time, answered earnestly. She continued, "I have just one question for you, dear husband."

Li Yuanjiao, catching a glimpse of sharp, intelligent eyes, felt a slight stir in his heart as he replied, "What is it?"

"Do you have any intentions of vying for the position of the family head?" Xiao Guiluan asked.

Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes slightly, his left hand tugging at the reins in irritation as replied, "I have no such intentions."

Xiao Guiluan paused for a moment before simply saying, "I see."

Li Yuanjiao replayed the earlier rituals at the Xiao Residence in his mind and caught on to many subtle details. He then asked gently, "Why wasn't your father present?"

He was naturally asking why Xiao Guiluan's father was not there to see her off. This caused her to pause again before she answered finally, "My father and I have no affection for each other. He resents that I did not marry locally and bring a son-in-law into the family, but instead, sought connections through marriage in the west. In his fury, he refused to see me off."

Li Yuanjiao was secretly pleased by this news. Nodding, he smiled as he continued testing the waters, saying, "What a fool."

Xiao Guiluan chuckled softly and replied without hesitation, "He is indeed... a fool."

Then, in a gentle tone, she added, "Only my older brothers care for me. With this marriage, I have severed ties with my family. If anything happens in the future, I fear I will not be able to seek their help."

Li Yuanjiao understood her clearly.

As long as Xiao Yuansi was alive, with the connection through his fourth uncle, Li Chejing, there would be no need for Xiao Guiluan to seek aid from her family.

Her words indicated that she had no paternal backing, preventing interference from her maternal family. Mentioning her brothers was likely to make it clear to Li Yuanjiao that she was not without support and should not be mistreated after marriage.

He smirked, thinking to himself, What a clever woman!

He then reined in his horse and gently reassured her, "Don't worry. As long as I am here, no one will dare to bully you."

"Hmm," came the warm response from inside.

The girl was in the carriage, and the boy was on horseback. As night fell, illuminated by the gentle moonlight, Li Yuanjiao couldn't help but laugh quietly to himself.




# Chapter 292: Beacon light

The carriage swayed along the road, finally arriving at Lijing Town. Xiao Xian was groggily awakened by the sound of suona music. He took out the wooden box and saw that apart from the few pieces he had eaten earlier, the rest were still neatly arranged and untouched.

"Qingxiao... Qingxiao!" Xiao Xian quickly woke the girl.

Li Qingxiao, still groggy from her slumber, stumbled off the seat. Below, the joyful and piercing sound of the suona could be heard before a large hand lifted the curtain, letting in the sunlight.

"Xiao'er," the man called out as he lifted the curtain.

"Father!" Li Qingxiao cried out in joy.

The man had a solemn demeanor. It was Chen Donghe, who had been waiting patiently in the town, eager to see his daughter. He used his mana to ease Li Qingxiao's discomfort.

Xiao Xian quickly greeted, "Xiao Family of Lixia, Xiao Xian of Mount Yu greets Senior!"

"Hmm," Chen Donghe responded politely in acknowledgment, his voice gentle as he added, "The guest courtyard is ahead... someone will come to receive you. Please wait a moment."

With that, he released the curtain and walked away with Li Qingxiao in his arms, leaving Xiao Xian alone in the carriage, feeling lonely and awkward as he did not know anyone.

"Hey!"

The curtain was suddenly pulled open again, and Li Qingxiao, bathed in golden sunlight, dashed back inside. She looked tired but was smiling as she said, "I will be on the mountain! Come find me when you are free."

She did not forget to pick up the wooden box of pastries from the floor, stuffing two pieces into Xiao Xian's hands before hopping out of the carriage.

Xiao Xian stood there while holding the two pastries, dazed for a dozen breaths. Then, he carefully put the pastries into his sleeve which had a pocket sewn into it, and sat in place obediently, waiting.

Meanwhile, Chen Donghe took Li Qingxiao up the mountain. She was exhausted, so he first took her to rest in the courtyard. While Li Jingtian was organizing wooden slips in the courtyard, Chen Donghe stepped forward and embraced his wife. Upon seeing her dazed expression, he asked gently, "Why do you look so dejected today?"

Li Jingtian paused, holding up a wooden slip from the table as she responded, "Decades of records are finally complete. Yuanyun has taken over the documentation, and I suddenly find myself with so much free time that I do not know what to do."

Chen Donghe remained silent. Li Jingtian put down what she was holding and said softly, "Time truly flies. Even Yuanjiao is now married. Half of my life has passed, but I've been confined to this mountain. It's quite sad... Not being able to soar with the wind is one thing, but I have not even left little Mount Lijing more than a few times..."

She looked up. Time had been merciful enough to leave only faint marks on her face, which still retained the beauty of her youth. Li Jingtian, slightly anxious, said softly, "My responsibilities on the mountain are done. When Qingxiao gets married, I want to ask the elders for permission for us to go north and see different sights for the rest of our lives."

Chen Donghe, who loved his wife deeply, could not bear the eager look on her face. He nodded tenderly and said, "In a few more years, when Qingxiao is married and the clan has more Qi Cultivators, I will make the request."

The couple exchanged a look before Li Jingtian nodded with a smile and leaned against Chen Donghe's chest.

"That should be the way... We have served the family for over ten years. When the clan is stable and the borders are peaceful, we can think about ourselves," she murmured.

She paused for a moment before continuing, "Qinghong and Yuanjiao both have their own ideas. The family is not as close-knit as it was when we were siblings growing up on the mountain, but the children are sensible and get along well. Qinghong wants to practice the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique, and Second Uncle lets her... I wonder where will her enthusiasm lead her in the future. I have read many historical records. Every family is united when they rise, but they fall apart when they succeed. The road ahead might be rough."

Li Jingtian has read many historical books and seen much, hence her worry.

Chen Donghe kissed her forehead and said, "Each generation has its own challenges... Only someone like Old Master Li is capable of planning for the next five generations. We do not need to worry about this; let us see what Yuanjiao and Qinghong will do."

————

"An alliance with the Xiao Family, with a Purple Mansion Realm Immortal Clan personally marrying off their daughter... What is Xiao Chuting thinking?!"

Yu Mugao stood on the wind in the sky, his face dreadfully grim. Behind him stood a group of people, all watching the procession below from behind the cover of clouds and mist. Yu Mugao had been watching for a long time, still finding it hard to believe.

He said, "Li Chejing has been silent for decades, and the Xiao Family still believes that the Li Family will succeed?!"

Everyone remained silent. Yu Mugao gritted his teeth, unable to tell how many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators were in the procession below. No matter how many schemes he had, he could only keep them to himself, staring blankly at the procession wordlessly.

"Xiao Chuting is a man of deep foresight. To marry off a daughter like this, Li Chejing must still be alive and on the verge of achieving the Purple Mansion Realm. It seems like all the scheming by the lake pales in comparison to the influence of a single word from someone at the Purple Mansion Realm."

Yu Mugao had managed the Yu Family for many years, contending with the restless Fei Family and the rising Li Family externally, while internally dealing with the elders and uncles of the clan. Every year, Yu Yufeng performed blood sacrifices. Just when he was ready to make significant moves after experiencing so much and finally gaining control of the Yu Family, the Li Family allied with a Purple Mansion Realm Immortal Clan, thus shattering his ambitions.

Despair filled him as he sighed exasperatedly. "What is the use of scheming and struggling...? The Yu Family's misfortune isn't something that human effort can remedy. Despite years of planning and exhausting both my heart and mind, what good has it done? Our luck has run out. Any further scheming is just prolonging the inevitable, wasting thirty years of careful calculations only to end up at a dead end."

Those behind him were shocked into silence. Several stepped forward to comfort him, but Yu Mugao remained silent for a long time before saying, "What is the point of talking? It would be best for the whole family to move north, over the mountains and away to Xu and Qi States, never to return. There is still a glimmer of hope there. As things stand now, we are just waiting to die."

"Mugao... we still hold the eastern shore, and Muxian is in the sect. At worst, we can hang on for a few hundred years. The Li Family's momentum will pass; there is no need to be so despondent..." the clansmen said, trying to persuade him otherwise.

Yu Mugao only shook his head and sighed, saying, "You cannot see the situation clearly. Li Tongya is like a serpent dragon, slippery and cunning. Even when he was a Qi Cultivator, we could not handle him. What can we still possibly do, now that he has reached the Foundation Establishment Realm...?"

"Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong are exceptionally talented. They will likely reach the Qi Cultivation Realm in their twenties. Once they grow, how will we compete with the Li Family? Li Yuanxiu, with his deep thoughts and extraordinary demeanor, was a threat. If we had not killed him, would we be standing here? We would be in a dire situation, facing crises from all sides!" Yu Mugao exclaimed in wearily.

Gazing into the distance, he continued, "I understand now... The current state of the Li Family is the result of our relentless suppression. If Jianixi had moved north, Yu Muyuan hesitated, or Li Chejing returned... the Li Family would not be what it is today."

The group's hearts filled with unease as they stood with Yu Mugao. After a while, another cultivator from the Yu Family flew over, landing before Yu Mugao with joy on his face.

"Family Head! The Immortal Master is arriving! The beacon light on the Dawn Cloudliner has lit up. Within three days, the Immortal Master from the Azure Pond Sect will be here!"

The members of the Yu Family were instantly filled with joy, their faces lighting up as they rejoiced with one another. Yu Mugao's face also brightened considerably. He replied, "Finally! Some good news. Let us see what the Immortal Master has to say... Muxian is confident; perhaps there is some news."




# Chapter 293: Jiang Yan

Linghai Prefecture had originally been the domain of the Yu Family.

After the Azure Pond Sect regained control of the area, the Yu Family quickly changed their allegiance. With several of their ancestors serving in the Azure Pond Sect, they managed to retain most of their territory and continued to dominate Linghai Prefecture.

However, after the deaths of several ancestors, the Yu Family's influence slowly waned year after year. Despite the emergence of a genius, Yu Yuxie, he quickly perished at the southern border, leading to the decline of the main branch of the Yu Family.

Several branches united with external families and established their own bases. Although the vast territory still nominally belonged to the Yu Family, they were fragmented and operated independently.

Fortunately, Linghai Prefecture was located in the southeast, surrounded by no external enemies, and the Azure Pond Sect did not allow clans to span prefectures. Thus, the fragmented Yu Family managed to maintain a status quo, preserving a rigid social structure that had lasted for nearly two centuries.

The wide road was bustling with people. From time to time, small traders and vendors passed by on donkeys and horses. By the roadside, a raggedly dressed boy sat, his face pale and lips blood-red, his gaze lightly scanning the passersby. Suddenly, he spoke, "Master, what exactly are the cultivators of the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivating?"

From among the passersby emerged an old farmer, who was sweating profusely. He sat down next to the boy, his stench overwhelming. With a mouth full of yellow teeth, he replied, "The Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao... The cultivation method involves consuming people, playing with spells, refining pills, gathering qi, and manipulating the lives of others... None of their cultivators are good people."

The boy raised an eyebrow and retorted, "Does this path not cultivate the metallic essence? To seek longevity, one will naturally use all means possible."

The old farmer spat and scoffed. "Heh! The Maha and Dharma Masters who cultivate destinies aren't any better. You will serve the Mahas for generations, year after year under their rule. Encountering a Maha or Dharma Master brings about despair and injustice that is even worse than dealing with Golden Core Daoists!"

The old farmer ranted agitatedly, his spit flying everywhere. The boy covered his nose and protested, "Old man, maybe you should change your skin... This one is too stinky!"

The old farmer paused, as if realizing something. He looked around in confusion, slapped his thigh, and cursed, "What the hell, how did I end up in this state? I am getting muddle-headed over the years..."

He jumped up and walked down the road, ignoring the boy who was traveling with him. Shortly after, a female farmer, relatively clean in appearance, came by, cursing with a smile, "Having practiced spells for over ten years, and yet you still care about appearances!"
𝓯𝙧𝙚𝙚𝔀𝒆𝓫𝓷𝙤𝓿𝒆𝙡.𝒄𝙤𝓶

The boy curled his lip and remarked, "You sure have it easy... avoiding the emissaries of death and wandering the world carefreely!"

"Damn it," the female farmer cursed before she continued ranting, "I have given most of my metallic essence and fate to them. What I have left is neither enough to form a Golden Core nor to become a Maha. Instead, I am just barely surviving. What is so carefree about that? Luckily, the heavenly fate has changed. If there were still calamities now, I would not even be able to survive. To end up like this is truly laughable!"

The boy sneered indifferently as he replied, "You mentioned that Duanmu Kui from Mount Yue was extraordinary and talented, but he still ended up being reduced to ashes without even a chance for reincarnation. At least, you can try again. What's so laughable about that?"

The female farmer laughed, showing her yellowed teeth. With her hands on her hips, her strong arms revealed, she explained, "Duamu Kui was violent and obsessed with reaching the Golden Core Realm. He fully believed that he could reach the Golden Core Realm just because of a promise from an immortal. It was no surprise he met his end. It wasn't that he couldn't endure humiliation; he simply refused to. Had it come to a fight, those two emissaries might not have been his match. Even as a monster after his death, he almost escaped them. Duanmu Kui was indeed a formidable man in his time... far beyond my reach."

The boy nodded thoughtfully, and the female farmer said seriously, "Yan’er, let us not talk about this. You and I will join forces to give the Azure Pond Sect a show of strength. You can avenge your mother's death, and I will seek a good Dao foundation. Once we finish these tasks, we'll hide away and cultivate."

The young man nodded silently, then asked, "What kind of Dao foundation are you looking for?"

The female farmer paused for a moment before speaking, "Forget about Man On Creek and Boundless Ocean... Xiao Chuting wants to cultivate the Sexagenary Pit Water Thousand Slow Essence. If I were to find either of those, a sinister man like him will surely eat me when the time comes. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of Changxiao Gate and Great Xiukui Temple also show potential for a breakthrough, so we definitely cannot pick either of those... As for Daoist Master Shangyuan, there are not many paths he can cultivate."

After a moment of thought, she replied, "There are many thunder cultivators in this Yue State, but none have achieved the Purple Mansion Realm. That's a viable path. Go find me a Dao foundation like Winter Thunderclap or Spring Awakening!"

The young man nodded, tapped his foot on the ground, and rose lightly into the air. The female farmer on the ground hurriedly raised her wrinkled, calloused hands, pinched her fingers, and calculated, shouting loudly, "Thirty-two li to the north, there is a market town operated by the Azure Pond Sect!"

The young man heard her words, and in the blink of an eye, reached the illusion formation in front of the market town. The grand formation of the Azure Pond Sect's market town had already been shattered, revealing layers upon layers of buildings and densely packed spirit fields.

Shouts and exclamations rose and fell in waves. Someone exclaimed, "Why did you deactivate the grand formation, Senior Brother Chi?! What are you doing? Hurry up and re-activate it! Are you not afraid of being punished by the sect?!"

In the air stood a cultivator dressed in green robes, his face attractive but tarnished with a crazed expression. His robes were stained with blood as he cackled wildly with a bloodthirsty grin. He was clearly in a trance-like state.

The cultivator flew forward to subdue Senior Brother Chi, but he drew his blade in a frenzy, slashing at the man. The man then hastily activated his dharma artifact to block the oncoming attack.

Clang!

The artifact was repelled and sent flying out like a bird. Fresh, red blood splattered around violently.

Both of them were usually evenly matched, but Senior Brother Chi was unnaturally strong today. He easily deflected the man’s dharma artifact and severed his arm with a single slash.

The pain and shock were unbearable for the man, but to everyone’s horror, his severed arm stretched out like a lump of mud, leaping and writhing like a frenzied mule, clawing at her own face.

"What kind of spell is this?!" Senior Brother Chi exclaimed in shock.

"Senior Brother! Let us help you!"

The remaining Azure Pond Sect cultivators flew up to assist immediately, but they were too late. The man, slapped hard by his own hand, spun like a top for about four or five revolutions before finally losing all signs of life.

"What?!"

The rescuing cultivators were stunned into silence. The lifeless body of the man trembled momentarily in mid-air before his other hand reached up toward his neck.

Without warning, he ripped out a bloody white spine, swinging it like a sword at the approaching cultivators.

Realizing the impending danger, the cultivators quickly shot out over a dozen talismans, their faces pale with fear as they shouted, "Devil cultivator! A Purple Mansion Realm devil cultivator..."

Crack.

Before he could finish, he was smacked hard on the head, spinning like a top before falling silent. His limbs were separated from his body, yanking out his heart, spleen, stomach, and lungs, which then moved independently, each seeking out other cultivators.

"Devil cultivator... A devil cultivator!"

The entire market turned into a bloody massacre, with screams echoing everywhere.

The young man stood quietly in the air, with flesh and blood swirling around him like obedient beasts, sticking close to his side. He smiled maniacally as he watched the fleeing cultivators and called out loudly to the distant figures, "Tell the Azure Pond Sect that Jiang Yan has come to avenge the massacre of the prefecture!"

His voice echoed through the air icily, and the Azure Pond Sect cultivators fled even faster. Jiang Yan savored the moment, while the head of a man, with his hair now disheveled, flew past him, spitting blood and laughing as it spoke, "The Azure Pond Sect is so arrogant... This whole market does not even have a single Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. Hurry and leave; the Yu Family is already on their way!"




# Chapter 294: Summons From The Upper Sect

The marriage arrangements of the Li Family were sudden, but invitations were sent out to all the families with Qi Cultivators and above on the lake. All the families, except the Yu Family, attended. Even the Foundation Establishment Realm rogue cultivators on the western shore sent representatives to observe the ceremony. Fei Wangbai did not attend personally but sent his grandson, Fei Tongyu, in his stead.

Fei Tongyu, always the elegant gentleman of the Fei Family, held a fan in his hand as he stood among the guests. His words were polite and courteous, but his demeanor showed little joy. He observed the various proceedings of the Li Family, particularly at Li Yuanjiao who was holding a cup at the head of the table, and felt a sense of unease stirring within him.
𝘧𝑟𝑒𝑒𝘸𝘦𝘣𝑛𝑜𝘷𝑒𝓁.𝘤𝘰𝓂

Li Yuanjiao at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm... such rapid progress. Although I have not seen Li Qinghong here, with her talent, she must at least be at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm! The rise of the Li Family is too swift; this could spell trouble.

Fei Tongyu set down his cup and glanced at a young man sitting quietly, drinking alone. Despite having no apparent cultivation, he was seated in a prominent position, indicating his importance within the family.

Fei Tongyu inquired, "May I know how to address you, brother?"

Li Yuanyun, lost in thought, was startled by Fei Tongyu's voice. Although Fei Tongyu did not know him, Yuanyun recognized him as the direct descendant of the Fei Family.

He replied politely, "You flatter me, but I am just a commoner. My name is Li Yuanyun, a direct descendant of the Li Family, but I do not deserve such respect from an immortal like you."

After spending several years mingling among the common folk, Li Yuanyun had long shed his youthful innocence and put on some weight. He had tried countless folk remedies and rituals to nurture a spiritual orifice—from praying to gods and Buddhas to distributing wealth and seeking the blessing of paper talismans, all of which had worn him down to a weary semblance of a middle-aged man.

Fei Tongyu, upon seeing him, then asked, "May I inquire about your relationship with Lady Qinghong?"

"Li Qinghong is my elder sister, born of the same mother," Li Yuanyun answered.

Fei Tongyu immediately perked up. Before he left, his younger brother Fei Tongxiao had begged him multiple times to bring along several letters for Li Qinghong. Seeing no sign of her at the banquet, Fei Tongyu quickly asked, "Is Lady Qinghong in seclusion on the mountain?"

"Indeed," Li Yuanyun nodded.

Fei Tongyu hesitated for a moment before continuing, "My younger brother..."

Seeing Fei Tongyu's hesitant expression, Li Yuanyun shook his head and interrupted, "My elder sister asked me to mention that her current cultivation method precludes descendants. That is all I can say on the matter."

Fei Tongyu, not at all a fool, paused momentarily before calming down. He simply responded, "Thank you, Brother Yuanyun."

Fei Tongyu had some admiration for Li Qinghong, but his feelings were more about the alliance's benefits and appreciation for her talent and conduct. Being older than Fei Tongxiao, he was less driven by romantic ideals. Upon hearing that Li Qinghong could not bear children, he easily dismissed any thoughts of pursuing her.

In those few moments, Fei Tongyu's mind raced through various considerations, now focusing on how to dissuade his stubborn younger brother, as he engaged in light conversation with Li Yuanyun.

"On my way here, I noticed the abundance of external cultivators in your family. I am afraid even if the Fei and Yu families combined, we would not match your numbers," Fei Tongyu said, smiling as he glanced around.

Li Yuanyun only chuckled dryly, not giving a response. Given the scarcity of descendants in the main and side families, most of the vast spirit fields were inevitably tended by external cultivators.

Seeing that Li Yuanyun did not wish to elaborate on this topic, Fei Tongyu changed the subject, commenting on the well-behaved members of the Li Family in their seats.

"Nevertheless, your family's strict discipline is well-known. I have heard that the Li Family's laws are strict, and with ancestor Tongya in his prime, there is no fear of losing control," he praised.

Li Yuanyun laughed heartily and joked, "Strict is an understatement. In our clan, the Clan Affairs Courtyard is rumored to be like the Underworld's palace of judgment. The clan rules are truly roasting the children over an open fire!"

Both men chuckled, exchanging a few bawdy jokes. Fei Tongyu, still preoccupied with thoughts of his younger brother, half-heartedly joined the conversation while his eyes roved over the banquet guests.

After a few rounds of wine, Fei Tongyu made up his mind. He left the banquet, standing in the woods to get some fresh air. As the setting sun disappeared behind the mountains, Fei Tongyu took out the letters from his sleeve and conjured a bright red flame with a spell.

With a bitter smile, he burned the letters that were meticulously written and rewritten by Fei Tongxiao countless times. Watching the letters turn to ash, he murmured, "Xiao'er, the celestial maiden has gone to the heavens. Forget your earthly feelings... let go of your feelings... let it go..."

Fei Tongyu resolved to tell his brother that the letters had been given to Li Qinghong, who had not responded. This way, Fei Tongxiao would have to move on. As he watched the tender words burn to ash, he sighed. "What a mess. Perhaps many men in the Fei Family are womanizers, and now we're suffering the karma..."

Having finished his task, Fei Tongyu sat on the steps, drinking silently. The faint red glow from the flames illuminated his face. He looked up, trying to identify the object in the sky before exclaiming in disbelief, "How is this possible?"

In the sky, brilliant rays of light began to appear. They were colorful and radiant, shining vividly against the dusk as light waves rolled in from the southeast like ocean waves. At the forefront, a massive ship resembling a giant bird with phoenix-like wings glided gracefully yet swiftly.

The banquet fell silent as everyone stared in awe at the sky. The magnificent aura of the ship left them speechless and dumbfounded.

Shortly after, various exclamations could be heard from the crowds.

"The Dawn Cloudliner... people from the upper sect! What is going on?!"

"It is not even time to pay our tributes yet..."

"It's the Dawn Cloudliner!"

Fei Tongyu's heart was filled with dread and anxiety, sensing impending doom. Among the three families by the lake, only his Fei Family had no backing within the sect so they could only bribe a few managers for information.

The sudden arrival of the Dawn Cloudliner could only mean something significant was happening, either instigated by Li Chejing or Yu Muxian. If it was Yu Muxian, both the Fei and Li families would be in trouble. If it was the Li Family, and they knew nothing about it, it could not be good news either.

Fei Tongyu's face turned pale as he watched the Dawn Cloudliner fly past Mount Lijing, heading toward Milin Prefecture. He felt slightly relieved and then rose into the air to find Li Xuanxuan.

————

"The Dawn Cloudliner..." Yu Mugao mumbled as he stared, mesmerized by the descending lights. The ship slowly docked on the mountain peak, its intricate patterns glowing brightly. The oppressive aura of the formation eased as a young man descended from the ship.

The young man who was dressed in green, was handsome, but there was a perpetual frown on his face. From his hair to his boots, he was bathed in radiant light. The Yu Family members kneeled down hurriedly, lowering themselves to the ground. The young man scanned them with disdain.

"Where is Yu Xiaogui? It is one thing for Yu Yufeng to be absent... but where is Yu Xiaogui?"

Yu Mugao quickly explained, "Yu Mugao greets the envoy! My father is in seclusion, and the ancestor has not yet returned!"

The young man scowled, looking down at the group with contempt.

"For Muxian's sake, I will not hold it against you... My name is Chi Zhiyan, the head disciple of Yuanwu Peak. Today, I am here to summon the families around Moongaze Lake to send people to Yi Mountain City. I hope the head of the Yu Family can assist."




# Chapter 295: Consuming

"I am willing to serve Your Highness unto death!" Yu Mugao declared respectfully.

Chi Zhiyan waved dismissively and replied, "There is no need for that. It is just a small matter. A few clans cannot stir up much trouble! If it were not for the sect master not wanting to move against these Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, I would not be here. We could order them, and both Li Tongya and Fei Wangbai would obediently go to Yi Mountain City... But now, we only need a few Qi Cultivators. They would not dare refuse, would they?"

Yu Mugao's eyes flickered briefly. "The Li Family has a sword immortal within the sect. I am afraid that you may need to approach with caution, Senior..." he advised humbly.

Chi Zhiyan paused, letting out a strange laugh from his throat. As a direct descendant of the Chi Family, he was well-informed about the matters at the southern border. It was just that Chi Wei had not acted honorably, avoiding mentioning it altogether.

Chi Zhiyan sneered, "Sword immortal..? The southern border is fraught with dangers; they may not even return. Such titles are useless here! Things will proceed as they must."

Yu Mugao was a shrewd man. Hearing these words, he felt reassured. He immediately put on a sorrowful expression and lamented, "My lord, you may not fear them, but the Li Family relies on the sword immortal's reputation to act arrogantly around the lake, oppressing us. One of my blood relatives has been captured by the Li Family, serving as a slave. We are terrified and dare not speak out."

Chi Zhiyan glanced at Yu Mugao and sneered, "My junior has already told me about this. There is no need to exaggerate. Your Yu Family, after all, is a clan and should not be so easily oppressed by the Li Family. Listen carefully."

Chi Zhiyan paused and continued, "Li Chejing will most likely not return. Muxian is renowned within the sect and has a solid background, even more than that sword immortal. There is no need to be afraid. The rivalries between clans are not something the sect interferes with. Li Tongya only has some rapport with Yuan Tuan; unless it is a matter of life and death for the entire family, Yuan Tuan will not intervene."

Yu Mugao repeatedly nodded, his heart filled with joy. He lowered himself even further, almost groveling at this point. Chi Zhiyan glanced at him with a smile as he said, "Remember this well, regardless of the chaos you create on the lake..."

Chi Zhiyan bent down close to Yu Mugao's face, and lightly patted his cheek with one hand while holding up two fingers with the other.

"There are two people who must not die... One is Li Tongya, whom you cannot kill anyway. The other, whom you may not know, is named Jiang Heqian."

Yu Mugao immediately broke out in a cold sweat, trembling as if he wished he could bury his head in the ground. Chi Zhiyan laughed and straightened up, adding, "If either of them dies, not even Muxian can save you. As for Fei Wangbai... his Patterned Brocade is useless, he is nothing but a corpse awaiting death."

Yu Mugao's eyes widened, with bloodshot veins beginning to appear as he quivered and stammered his compliance, his sweat now pooling on the ground. Chi Zhiyan, with a cocky demeanor, kicked Yu Mugao's shoulder and laughed heartily.

Several people flew down from the flying boat, all dressed in the gray robes of the Azure Pond Sect's Yuanwu Peak. One of them, a man with a sneaky appearance, rushed eagerly to Chi Zhiyan's side and said respectfully, "My lord, please give your orders..."

Chi Zhiyan simply snorted and stood with his hands behind his back.

"For the Fei Family, that so-called young master will do. For the minor Qi Cultivation Realm families, take their strongest cultivators. As for the Li Family... take Li Xuanfeng. He is of no use after the massacre at Lixia Prefecture."

"Yes, yes!" the sneaky-looking cultivator responded as he nodded repeatedly.

Chi Zhiyan glanced at the dazed Yu Mugao and smiled, "Cultivate well. Your Yu Family has the qualifications to dine at the table. As for the Li and Fei families, they are just dogs circling beneath it. If it were not for the ban on blood sacrifices at Moongaze Lake, they would have been eliminated long ago."

Yu Mugao forced a smile, though his heart was gripped with fear. His legs trembled uncontrollably. Chi Zhiyan, seeing his pitiful state, grew even more excited as he added, "As for your family's ancestor, Yu Yufeng..."

Yu Mugao had a premonition and quickly looked up. Chi Zhiyan laughed with a hint of mockery in his eyes.

"He has been dead for a long time."

Yu Mugao was stunned and whispered, "What...? I do not understand. Which force's Purple Mansion Realm cultivator took his life?"

"I guess there's no harm in telling you!" Chi Zhiyan chuckled. He took great pleasure in trampling on geniuses and strategists.

Seeing Yu Mugao so subservient, he felt immense satisfaction and replied, "Yu Mugao, Yu Yufeng was killed by our Azure Pond Sect in collaboration with Xiao Chuting! This was also agreed upon by your own younger brother!"

Meanwhile on Xianyou Peak in Lixia Prefecture...

Whoosh...

An old man struggled to reel in a gleaming jade stone from the lake. With a strong flick of his jade fishing rod, he freed the stone from the clutches of the lake water and pulled it ashore.

Xiao Chuting squinted his eyes as he remarked, "Hmm... Not bad."

"Chuting, the Dawn Cloudliner has headed to Moongaze Lake."

Xiao Chuchou, who was also sitting cross-legged nearby, muttered this quietly, casting a complex look toward Xiao Chuting.

Xiao Chuting, however, remained indifferent. He examined the jade stone and asked, "Xiao Chuchou, do you resent me?"

Xiao Chuchou's face, wrinkled with extreme age, twitched slightly as he replied, "There is nothing to resent. It was a matter of necessity. When I left the family back then, I suppose you must have hated me even more."

Xiao Chuting chuckled softly, his expression nostalgic as he responded warmly, "At first, I did. But when the Azure Pond Sect sent Yu Yuxie specifically to suppress Yu Yufeng, I suddenly realized that the decision you made back then may not have entirely been your own."

Xiao Chuting's white eyebrows and beard twitched as if reflected in rippling water. He spoke with a sense of loss in his voice. "The shadows in the great void were too thick. Since then, I have been both terrified and confused, questioning myself in countless painful nights... Xiao Chuting, are you really you today, or are you merely a puppet of some Purple Mansion Golden Core Daoists or the Mahas and Dharma Masters?"

"It might have been better not to know, to avoid this madness..." Xiao Chuting replied.

However, his voice seemed to emerge from the void rather than his mouth. He spoke softly, "Yu Yufeng did not believe in fate and resorted to blood sacrifices to heal his hands. He was indeed a genius, forcibly advancing a few more steps on his interrupted Dao, almost breaking through to the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm after decades. Even so, he met his end. How could he have survived against two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who had Heavy Murk and Man On Creek aiding them? The Jade True Unified Void Essence is an untrainable state, incapable of forming an immortal foundation. From the moment he practiced the Aged Courtly Path Scripture, he was already a dead man."

Xiao Chuchou was not surprised. Having journeyed extensively, he knew just as much as Xiao Chuting. His deeply wrinkled face twisted into a cold smile as he responded, "Yes... have you ever wondered why you, Xiao Chuting, cultivated Man On Creek, while I, Xiao Chuchou, cultivated Darkening Clouds? A remarkable coincidence isn't it...? For them to be perfectly complementary Dao Partners..."

Xiao Chuting nodded and slowly stood up. A deadly aura emanated from him, causing snowflakes to rise and dance across Xianyou Peak. The sound of crashing sea waves rumbled overhead, with faint hisses of serpent dragons.

Xiao Chuchou's body grew increasingly frail, shrinking into a skeletal figure. He let out a few raspy laughs, and wisps of smoke drifted from his body, tiny eyes, mouth, and ears.

The old man murmured, "Xiao Xianyou... it was Xiao Xianyou all along. He had calculated everything from the beginning. He cultivated Boundless Ocean, also known as Jing Dragon King! What a marvel!"

Standing amidst the swirling smoke in the sky, Xiao Chuting radiated a divine aura. His expression was sorrowful yet solemn, almost sacred.

"Brother, we have no path forward, no retreat."

Dong...!

The bell on Xianyou Peak tolled ethereally like thunder echoing through the mountains. The inexplicable, flying snowfall continued falling as though it was trying to cover up all impurities. The members of the Xiao Family fell to their knees, looking up in bewilderment.

"It is the aura of the Foundation Establishment Realm... An ancestor has passed away!"




# Chapter 296: Yuzhi

"The Dawn Cloudliner..."

Li Xuanxuan looked at the colorful glow in the sky, feeling uneasy. His second uncle, Li Tongya, had disappeared after the sacrificial ritual. Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators often meditated for years, so Li Xuanxuan could not find him immediately and could only wait.

Fortunately, a figure dressed in gray soon appeared before him. Li Tongya descended with a frown. He had planned to enter seclusion, but his wife Liu Rouxuan's health was deteriorating, forcing him to postpone his plans. Hence, he happened to witness this scene.

"It seems they are summoning people to Yi Mountain City at the southern border," Li Tongya commented as he stood midair with his sword. He had heard some information at Xiao Chuting's ceremony and now deduced the purpose of the Dawn Cloudliner.

After waiting in the air for a while, he saw someone approaching on a flying shuttle. The newcomer was dressed elegantly but had a rat-like face and shifty eyes that made him he look like he was up to no good.

The man landed at the formation entrance and shouted, "Juniors from the Li Family, I command you to open the formation right away!"

The crowd below was visibly enraged, but Li Tongya seemed thoughtful and calmly opened the formation, personally stepping forward to greet him. He said respectfully, "Li Family of Lijing welcomes the envoy!"

Seeing a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator personally greeting him, the man held back his arrogance and begrudgingly replied, "At least you have some sense."

He swaggered into the courtyard, glanced at the indignant members of the Li Family, and impatiently waved his sleeve, scolding, "You lot, get out! How can juniors be allowed to listen to our conversation?"

"You!" Li Xuanxuan looked rather upset, but Li Xuanling gave the man a sidelong glance like a serpent before leading his brothers away.

The man entered the courtyard with Li Tongya and cast a spell to seal their surroundings. He then straightened up, his demeanor changing abruptly, showing a hint of guilt as he bowed and said, "I am Deng Yuzhi. My earlier behavior was unavoidable. Please forgive me, Senior."

Li Tongya was taken aback by the sudden change but courteously replied, "Brother Deng, please rise. There is no need for such formalities. We did not take it to heart."

Deng Yuzhi spoke quickly and urgently, without giving Li Tongya a chance to respond.

"I am a member of the Deng Family, a subordinate family of the Azure Pond Peak. My elder brother Deng Qiuzhi and the Sword Immortal were close friends. They both perished at the southern border, devoured by a demon king. Do you know this, Senior?"

"I do."

Seeing Deng Yuzhi's anxiety, Li Tongya responded in a straightforward manner.

Deng Yuzhi nodded and said solemnly, "I'm glad you do, Senior. The sect disciple who came this time is Chi Zhiyan from the Chi Family. He is sinister and cruel. He already knows of the Sword Immortal's death... The Yu Family has also heard the news. Please be prepared, Senior."

Without waiting for Li Tongya's reply, Deng Yuzhi continued quickly, "Although my family's ancestor has never met you, he has heard many stories about you and holds you in high regard. Our families share similar circumstances. If you are willing, we can support each other in the future."

Li Tongya, resting his hand on his sword hilt, had an inscrutable expression. He asked softly, "I have a question for you. In the power struggles among the Purple Mansion Realm and Golden Core Realm cultivators in Jiangnan, what is the relationship between the Xiao Family and Azure Pond Sect?"

"They have a common enemy. Xiao Chuting wants to cultivate the Sexagenary Pit Water Thousand Slow Essence..." Deng Yuzhi said as he started his explanation.

However, Li Tongya waved his hand to interrupt him.

"I understand."

Deng Yuzhi nodded and continued, "Our Deng Family also has properties in Lixia Prefecture. If you have any further matters to discuss, feel free to send someone there. You are a prudent and steady person, I believe you understand the intricacies involved."

He handed over a small letter. Li Tongya scanned it with his spiritual sense and saw that it contained records of several alleys in Lixia Prefecture.

Seeing Li Tongya accept the letter, Deng Yuzhi exhaled deeply and said in a solemn voice, "There are people in the four prefectures spreading the word about your formidable Dao foundation and exceptional swordsmanship. It is likely done with intent. It is best for you to keep a low profile and not reveal your whereabouts."

This news surprised Li Tongya, causing him to ponder deeply. He nodded slightly, and Deng Yuzhi continued, "This time, the summons to Yi Mountain City includes Li Xuanfeng. We have no choice but to take your clan members... I hope you understand."

Li Tongya slowly closed his eyes and exhaled deeply. Li Xuanfeng was the only son of Li Xiangping and had no heirs. If something happened to him in Yi Mountain City, it would mean the end of that line. He was naturally unwilling and asked with a frown, "Xuanfeng is my brother's orphan. I am willing to go in his place. Is that possible...?"

Deng Yuzhi waved his hand, clearly and firmly refusing. He said bitterly, "I am merely surviving by doing others' bidding. Chi Zhiyan deeply envies the sword immortal. I have to put on a pretense just to be here. Naturally, I'm powerless to make any decisions..."

Li Tongya could only cover his face and sigh, replying, "I understand."

Deng Yuzhi did not linger and continued, "I must leave immediately with the person. If there is any offense, I ask for your forgiveness."

With that, he flung open his sleeves and kicked open the door. He called out in the courtyard, "Where is Li Xuanfeng?!"

In the lower courtyard, a group of anxious people stood. Li Xuanling and Li Xuanxuan looked up at him with unreadable expressions.

Li Xuanfeng, carrying his golden bow, stared directly at Deng Yuzhi and replied steadily, "Here!"

Deng Yuzhi sneered and said, "The Azure Pond Sect commands you to go to Yi Mountain City at the southern border to resist the demons. You are to leave immediately without delay."

Li Xuanfeng secured the golden bow on his back, and a smile formed on his scruffy chin as if he had heard something amusing. He laughed heartily and simply replied, "Very well."

Deng Yuzhi just tugged at him, saying, "Follow me."

Li Xuanfeng looked back at Li Tongya, who had walked out of the courtyard and bowed deeply. He then said to his brothers, Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanling, "Please take care of the family affairs. No need to miss me."

This man, who had lost his parents in childhood and his wife in his youth, only uttered these few words. His eyes sparkled as if the years since the massacre of Lixia Prefecture had been dull, and now, facing the imminent battle and slaughter, he seemed excited and eager.

"Brother..." Li Xuanling and Li Xuanxuan began as they were still processing the news. However, Li Xuanfeng had already ridden the wind and followed Deng Yuzhi northward.

Li Xuanxuan finally came to his senses and called out hurriedly, "Second Uncle! This...!"

Li Tongya waved his sleeve, his face showing a painful expression as he said softly, "Resume your cultivation..."

The few of them exchanged glances, then lowered their heads and dispersed. The wedding was already nearing its end, and with the disruption of the Dawn Cloudliner, no one was in the mood to stay any longer. Guests began bidding their farewells and left.

After sending Li Yuanjiao and Xiao Guiluan to their bridal chamber, Mount Lijing returned to its usual quiet state, with only the mess left from the celebration hinting at the recent festivities.

It was not until the Dawn Cloudliner had flown past the horizon and its splendid glow faded away that the entire Moongaze Lake fell back into darkness and silence.

————

"Report to the envoy, everyone is here!"

Deng Yuzhi kneeled obsequiously before Chi Zhiyan, while Yu Mugao looked dazed as if lost in a nightmare. Chi Zhiyan's words still echoed in his mind.

"Yu Mugao, Yu Yufeng was killed by our Azure Pond Sect in collaboration with Xiao Chuting! This was also agreed upon by your own younger brother!"

"Muxian... personally agreed to it...?"

Yu Mugao's expression was one of pure bewilderment. He had exchanged dozens of letters with Yu Muxian, yet his brother had never mentioned this. Was it to avoid alarming anyone or because he did not trust Yu Mugao?

Suddenly, Yu Mugao felt a strange sense of unfamiliarity toward his own brother in the sect. He mumbled something indistinctly, and Chi Zhiyan, noticing his state, impatiently spat, "Stop practicing the Aged Courtly Path Scripture from now on!"

The group rode the wind back to the Dawn Cloudliner. The members of the Yu Family all kneeled, loudly bidding farewell. The intricate patterns on the ship brightened as it extended its radiant wings, flying toward the southeast.

Yu Mugao watched as the ship disappeared into the horizon. Only then did he slowly stand up, looking around at the silent crowd. He felt no shame for his earlier submissive behavior.

After a moment of silence, he said, "Jiang Heqian... It turns out to be an old grudge. Call back all our people from the eastern shore."




# Chapter 297: Five Years

Li Xuanfeng was transferred to the southern border. Li Tongya's wife, Liu Rouxuan, only lasted a few months before she died on the mountain. Li Tongya stayed by her bedside the entire time.

With tears in her eyes, Liu Rouxuan had managed to stammer out a final sentence before she passed away.

"My dear, you still have over two hundred years to live... I hope you will marry again after I am gone. Do not overly favor the Liu Family, as too much kindness could lead to disaster."

Li Tongya sat quietly by the bed, speaking gently, but Liu Rouxuan had already stopped breathing. Their son, Li Xuanling, wept bitterly at her side. Li Yuanyun, who was in Eastern Mount Yue, and Li Qinghong, stationed at Mount Yuting, managed to rush back in time to shed silent tears at her bedside.

Liu Rouxuan's face bore little resemblance to the one that had once asked Li Tongya, "Do you love me?" in the small courtyard. Her eyes were lifeless, her mouth stiff, and her face marked by deep wrinkles. Yet her withered hands clung to Li Tongya's, holding on tightly, even in death.

The entire Li Family of Lijing mourned deeply, draping white cloth throughout their residence. Meanwhile, the Liu Family was engulfed in terror. For decades, they had produced no notable talents; their courtyard was dominated by playboys who only cared about the pleasures of life.

The death of Liu Rouxuan sent the Liu Family into a spiral of panic and fear, with members crying out "Grandmother is gone" throughout their estate. When her last words were spread down the mountain, everyone became even more anxious, and resentful murmurs filled the air.

Li Tongya buried Liu Rouxuan, looked at the gathered members of the Li Family who had rushed back, and removed the Dragon Coiling Pillar sword, which was glowing with mana light, from his waist.

He announced softly, "I will now go into seclusion for cultivation and may not come out for several years, or even decades... This dharma sword will only gather dust with me, so I will leave it with all of you."

"Yuanjiao!" he called out.

Li Yuanjiao quickly raised his head and stepped forward, receiving the dharma sword with both hands. Li Tongya then said softly, "Among all the disciples, you are the most talented swordsman. Take this with you and use it well."

Li Yuanjiao was deeply moved, not expecting Li Tongya to give the sword to him instead of his own son, Li Xuanling. He wanted to decline, but Li Tongya waved his hand and pushed him back to his seat, continuing, "Now, you are the eldest brother here. Take good care of your younger siblings and do not disappoint me."

He then turned to Li Xuanxuan, paused thoughtfully, and handed him a storage pouch tied at his waist. "I have reviewed the tributes that prestigious clans are expected to pay... The amount far exceeds what the current Li Family can afford. We need to pay the next five years' tribute by next year. Inside this pouch, you'll find dharma artifacts and spirit items I've collected over the years. Take them to the market and sell them to cover this gap."

Li Xuanxuan nodded obediently as Li Tongya continued, "This is not a sustainable solution. I've made some preliminary arrangements at the Cloud Crowned Peak market. There's a small shop there looking to form an alliance with our Li Family. Go there immediately, finalize the arrangements, and forge a new path for our family to earn Spirit Stones. Take the talismans you've crafted over the years to sell. Since you are not inclined toward cultivation, you will stay there to draw talismans. Leave family matters to the younger generation."

Li Xuanxuan had no objections and nodded in agreement. Li Tongya then instructed Li Xuanling, "Try your best to assist your brother as much as possible when you're not cultivating."

Seeing everyone nod in agreement, Li Tongya straightened up and said gently, "Work hard in your cultivation and take good care of each other."

"Yes!" Everyone responded in unison, and before the echoes faded, Li Tongya's figure had already disappeared. Li Xuanling wiped away his tears and exchanged a glance with Li Xuanxuan. Without further delay, they rode the wind toward Cloud Crowned Peak together.

The few members of the Yuan and Qing generation gathered together, encouraging each other before heading down the mountain.

The lights on Mount Lijing flickered.

The brilliant dawn rose from the horizon, illuminating the Li Family's territory. Smoke rose from the houses at the foot of the mountain, marking the arrival of a new day.

————

Eastern Mount Yue was characterized by many mountains and few fields, making it unsuitable for sustaining a population. There were, however, numerous small hills and earth veins. Li Yuanjiao had been surveying the area for several months, from west to east, probing each vein of spiritual energy. Finally, he found a suitable small mountain.

"Mount Wutu."

Li Yuanjiao rose into the wind, lightly circling the location on the map in his hand. He estimated the distance, examined the veins and spiritual energy, nodded slowly, and descended to the foot of the mountain.

At the foot of the mountain stood a woman of noble bearing, her phoenix eyes radiating brilliance. She wore a graceful dress and held a boy, about five or six years old, who looked smart and handsome. He was peering around curiously. As soon as Li Yuanjiao landed, the boy jumped and shouted, "Dad! This mountain looks like a bird!"

This boy was Li Yuanjiao's son, named Li Xizhi, now over four years old. He was well-behaved and adorable, greatly loved by Li Yuanjiao and his wife.

"Hahahaha!" Li Yuanjiao laughed heartily.

Beside him, Xiao Guiluan gently asked, "How is it?"

"The veins and spiritual energy are sufficient. It is not inferior to Mount Lijing, and it is one of the best in Eastern Mount Yue," Li Yuanjiao replied, then continued, "According to the ancient texts, the spirit fields on Mount Wutu are fertile and intact... There is no better place within Eastern Mount Yue."

"Then let us settle here..." Xiao Guiluan's eyebrows showed a trace of worry as she whispered, "The clan's tribute is too heavy. We have been running at a loss every year... We cannot afford to waste any more time."

Li Yuanjiao fell silent for a moment, then nodded in agreement.

"Indeed."

Five years had passed in the blink of an eye. The lake remained relatively peaceful during this time. The Yu Family had relaxed their control and tribute demands on the eastern shore families, retreating into Milin Prefecture and becoming quiet. The Li Family quietly digested the territories of Mount Huazhong and Mount Yuting, enjoying a period of calmness.

During these five years, Li Qinghong and Li Yuanjiao had both broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm. Most of the Yuan generation had children, and even Li Yuanjiao's several half-brothers had children who were now seven years old. Unfortunately, their talents were disappointing. Even those with spiritual orifices showed little promise, causing Li Yuanjiao to shake his head in dismay.

Li Xuanxuan had been stationed at the market for years now, rarely returning. Despite his reluctance, Li Yuanjiao had to take over family affairs, temporarily acting as the head of the family.

Xiao Guiluan, holding Li Xizhi, watched Li Yuanjiao rise with the wind. They exchanged a glance, and Xiao Guiluan said, "There is one thing I have to tell you, my dear. The people from Mount Yu told me that they needed to craft dharma artifacts and should be able to use our ebony ore. If we can supply enough, we could get a premium rate of ten to twenty percent."

Li Yuanjiao's eyes immediately lit up with joy.

"Good! If this works out, we can replenish our funds and reduce the need to draw from the family treasury."

With the Yu Family's decline on the lake, a tripartite balance of power had emerged. For the Li Family, their greatest challenge had become the tribute payments to the Azure Pond Sect. The tribute demanded of a clan was now more than ten times what it had been during the Qi Cultivation Realm period, far exceeding the Li Family's current income.

Unlike other Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators like Yu Yufeng, Li Tongya never demanded resources, otherwise Li Yuanjiao would have had to sell off the entire Li Family to support him in his cultivation.

Despite this, Li Yuanjiao was still constantly burdened with worries about the family's financial deficit. Hearing that Xiao Guiluan had found a way to earn Spirit Stones, he could not help but praise her.

Seeing Xiao Guiluan smile silently, Li Yuanjiao suddenly paused, a smile tugging at his lips as he said, "That Xiao Xian is from the Mount Yu branch of the Xiao Family, isn't he?"

"Heh." Xiao Guiluan, who had been managing the family with Li Yuanjiao for five years, responded with a soft laugh, her phoenix eyes twinkling as she said gently, "That boy's intention is quite obvious! He runs to our Lijing Town every month just to find an excuse to see Qingxiao. Now that the Mount Yu branch has sent him to handle this matter, he is overjoyed."




# Chapter 298: The Dou Family

"Xiao Xian..."

Li Yuanjiao stroked the Dragon Coiling Pillar sword at his waist, his brows furrowing. Unlike Li Tongya or Li Xuanxuan, who, despite their unassuming appearances, were deep thinkers, the narrow gap between his eyebrows lent him an untrustworthy appearance. Now, with his brows furrowed, he looked even more like a serpent dragon.

"The Mount Yu branch of the Xiao Family... Qingxiao's marriage into their family is somewhat of a slight, but Xiao Jiuqing is quite adept and has a promising future. If Xiao Xian is sincere and my little sister is willing, he might be a good match."

"The Mount Yu branch is one of the most prominent branches in the Xiao Family," Xiao Guiluan remarked, holding onto Li Yuanjiao's arm.

"Xiao Xian's talent is not great, but he has the potential to achieve the Qi Cultivation Realm. Qingxiao's talent is poor, but with the resources of the Mount Yu branch, Xiao Xian could help her reach the Qi Cultivation Realm with unrefined qi which is a good thing," she continued.

As they chatted and laughed, Mount Lijing appeared beneath them. The couple descended into the courtyard where the clan guards immediately approached, greeting them respectfully.

"Family Head, Madam... Young Master Yuanping is already waiting in the house."

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly and pushed the door open. Inside, a young boy dressed in white clothes was admiring the calligraphy and paintings on the wall, holding a fan. He appeared to be about twelve or thirteen years old, with a slightly pale face that gave him a sickly look.

Hearing the door open, he turned his head, his eyes lighting up as he smiled, "Brother, you are back!"

"Yes."

Li Yuanping was born to Li Xuanxuan and his wife, Madam Dou. He was the younger brother of Li Yuanxiu from the same mother. Unfortunately, Li Yuanxiu passed away when Madam Dou was pregnant with Li Yuanping. This loss deeply affected Madam Dou and had a profound impact on the unborn child, leaving Li Yuanping with a congenital deficiency.

Fortunately, both his parents were cultivators, and Li Yuanping possessed a spiritual orifice. Although not very talented, he was considered average. After five years of cultivation, he has condensed the Radiant Lure Chakra and reached the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.

Li Yuanjiao responded and saw Li Yuanping smile as he said, "I heard that you broke through to the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Congratulations!"

In truth, Li Yuanjiao had not been burdened with many mundane affairs over the years. Most of the family's affairs, whether related to Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators or worldly matters, were handled by Xiao Guiluan. She managed things efficiently, with fair rewards and punishments, earning the respect of the entire household.

With Xiao Guiluan's assistance, Li Yuanjiao's cultivation progressed rapidly. He had received the Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit Talisman, and his cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds. Within five years, he has already reached the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, surpassing even his father, Li Xuanxuan.

Li Yuanjiao nodded lightly, took two steps to the main seat, and sat down. Looking at his still youthful half-brother, he asked gently, "How is it? Are you able to handle the Clan Affairs Courtyard?"

"It is going well," Li Yuanping replied as he nodded, smiling, "The Jade Court Guards have already reached the fourth or fifth stages of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. The five of them together can suppress any disturbances... though they usually only deal with petty thieves."

Li Yuanjiao had no interest in managing affairs. Seeing Li Yuanping grow up day by day, he hurriedly handed over the Clan Affairs Courtyard to him. Now, seeing that he managed well, Li Yuanjiao nodded in satisfaction and said warmly, "Uphold the family laws strictly. Ensure there are no arrogant individuals among the family's disciples."

As the two brothers were chatting, someone approached hurriedly from below. He bowed in the courtyard, and reported respectfully, "Family Head, there is a letter from Cloud Crowned Peak."

"Present it."

The person below, clad in armor, with a square face and thick eyebrows, had an honest appearance. He quickly handed the letter over to the men. However, Li Yuanjiao took the envelope but did not open it. Instead, he stared at the armored man.

The messenger from the hall had always been someone from the Liu Family, whom Li Yuanjiao was accustomed to seeing. However, this person seemed unfamiliar. After a moment of scrutiny, he asked in confusion, "Are you from the Dou Family?"

With a thud, the armored man kneeled in front of him instantly, slightly fearful as he replied, "Family Head, my name is Dou Yi. Madam Dou is my paternal aunt... The regular messenger fell ill, so I took his place."

"I see... you are someone from my mother's family."

Since Madam Dou was the wife of Li Xuanxuan and the mother of Li Yuanping, Li Yuanjiao should technically call her mother as well. Instead, Li Yuanjiao feigned sudden realization and smiled at Li Yuanping as he said, "I guess he can be considered your cousin."

Li Yuanping, sitting nearby, merely nodded upon hearing this. He did not look at Dou Yi but continued to pour himself tea. Li Yuanjiao understood the situation immediately. He waved his hand casually to dismiss him, and said with indifference, "In that case, you may serve by Yuanping's side and find a position in the Clan Affairs Courtyard."

Dou Yi nodded repeatedly and retreated slowly. Li Yuanping smiled wryly and said, "This is certainly not my mother's doing. It is probably the Dou Family's initiative..."

"I know," Li Yuanjiao nodded as he sighed.

"As they say, when the wall is about to fall, everyone pushes. The Liu Family is, after all, the family of the ancestor's wife so we still need to keep a Liu Family member in the hall. As long as news reaches us, the public will have some fear and will not go overboard with their actions."

Li Yuanping nodded thoughtfully and replied, "Thank you for the guidance, brother."

Li Yuanjiao laughed heartily. The brothers spoke candidly, and Li Yuanjiao's expression was slightly tinged with sadness as he said, "This advice actually came from our eldest brother. I never have any desire for power. Now that you have it in your hands, I believe you won't let it go to waste."

Naturally, he was referring to Li Yuanxiu. Li Yuanping had heard many stories about this elder brother he had never met. He simply nodded, and Li Yuanjiao began to read the letter. After scanning it for a few moments, he smiled.

"It is a letter from father."

Li Yuanping looked up in confusion as Li Yuanjiao explained, "The devil plague is becoming more rampant. Not only Jiang Yan but dozens of others have joined the Devil Dao, committing widespread slaughters. As a result, talismans and dharma artifacts are in high demand within and outside the sect. This has significantly increased our income this year. Father has suggested we send the family's cloud bamboo harvest to be made into talisman papers, which would greatly reduce the costs of crafting talismans."

Li Yuanping, upon hearing the news, lowered his head and said, "The devil plague has been going on for more than five years, yet the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of the Azure Pond Sect have never intervened. I wonder what Chi Zhiyun is thinking..."

Li Yuanjiao paused, and set down his tea bowl before replying, "The devil plague is not simple... As for Jiang Yan, no one knows who he is or whose pawn he might be. You've studied the family history and should be aware of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's power. If they are letting Jiang Yan run amok, it must be a deliberate act."

Li Yuanping pondered silently to himself. After exchanging a few more words, he glanced at the time and, not wanting to disturb Li Yuanjiao further, took his leave.

Once Li Yuanping had left, a dignified woman in a luxurious flowing dress walked out from the back of the hall. She greeted him with a slight bow, her brow furrowed slightly, and said in a serious tone, "My dear, the decline of the Liu Family has been alarmingly rapid. In just five short years, they have gone from a prestigious family to one with members scattered everywhere... There must be something unusual going on."

"That's true. How could that Liu Family member fall ill at this time? They've tried every trick to push someone in front of me, just to test how much affection we still have for the Liu Family."

Li Yuanjiao carefully stored the letter under a pile of scrolls and continued listing out everything. "The Tian Family was sent to the Mount Yue region. The remaining Ren, Chen, Xu, and Dou families must have been plotting to push the Liu Family out of prominence for years... The Liu Family descendants were still indulging themselves. Once the news spread from the mountain, the other families began to act. The Liu Family never had many capable members. They only managed to last five years due to the caution of the other prominent families."

Xiao Guiluan nodded, smiling. "Times have changed. Many things that belonged to the Liu Family should now bear the Dou name. I have met Mother several times; she is tough and has a temper."

Li Yuanjiao laughed heartily, catching the underlying meaning in Xiao Guiluan's words, and responded gently, "I have known Mother for many years. To her, the entire Dou Family holds less value than Yuanping's little finger. The Dou Family is merely the next Liu Family... there's nothing to worry about."

He paused and continued, "Yuanping's temperament mirrors that of Madam Dou; he is not one to be easily deceived. In a couple of years, we'll hand over the family affairs to him. Then, you and I can retire to Mount Wutu to cultivate and live as an immortal couple... Wouldn't that be wonderful?"

Xiao Guiluan nodded slightly. However, she was from the Xiao Family, a centuries-old prestigious clan rife with fierce internal power struggles, unlike the newly established and harmonious Li Family. She had seen too many instances of kin turning against each other. Holding no power made her uneasy—not for herself, but for fear that their son, Li Xizhi, might suffer the consequences.

This intelligent woman had also figured out her husband's temperament well, and refrained from immediately disagreeing with him. Instead, she nodded with a smile, gazing at the flickering candle flame as she pondered how she could secure more support for Li Xizhi.

Li Yuanping left the courtyard, snapped his fan shut with a swish, and walked on with a displeased expression. Dou Yi followed closely behind, feeling as though he had caused trouble and dared not speak.

Li Yuanping suddenly stopped. Caught off guard, Dou Yi nearly stumbled into him. "Young Master! Young Master!" he called out hurriedly.

"Shut up!" Li Yuanping hissed, using his fan to steady the man, frowning slightly. He then said softly, "Which idiot from the Dou Family took it upon themselves to replace that Liu Family member? You nearly made me lose face in front of my elder brother... If Mother finds out, she will surely have you all punished!"

Dou Yi knew he would have to stay by Li Yuanping's side from now on, but could not bear to blame his father, so he merely stammered in response, "Y-yes...Yes..."

Li Yuanping waved his hand gently and turned his head as he walked, saying, "You do not need to tell me... I know it was probably Old Master Dou. When people get old and gain power, they start scheming more."

Dou Yi quickly followed, replying respectfully, "This was also for your benefit, Young Master. The Clan Affairs Courtyard has always been the stepping stone to becoming the family head... Young Master Yuanjiao has often expressed his desire to relinquish his authority. Now that you are in charge of the Clan Affairs Courtyard, it's only a matter of time before you ascend to the family head! Father simply wanted to place more people to help you."

"Heh," Li Yuanping chuckled, amused. "You speak with such certainty. Your father isn't trying to help me; he's trying to sabotage me! If he truly wanted to help, he would patiently wait three years. There's no need for him to meddle now."

He frowned and looked at the guilt-ridden Dou Yi before saying, "Your father is merely using this as an excuse to expand his influence... Why does he need to do so under the guise of helping me? Your family is my maternal family. When I assume leadership, you will naturally have your place. There's no need for all this... Don't assume I am young and easily deceived."

Dou Yi quickly broke out into a cold sweat. Li Yuanping, waving his fan, continued calmly, "Let us set that aside. I do not care who sent you. Since my elder brother has assigned you to me, you will work for me from now on. Forget about your Dou Family."

Dou Yi was stunned. What Li Yuanping said was completely different from what his father had instructed. Old Master Dou had always told him, "Young Master Yuanping and Madam Dou are the pillars of our Dou Family. Rely on them to secure more power for our family... In the future, our Dou Family will rise to prominence."

Hearing Li Yuanping's tone now, it was clear that neither he nor Madam Dou regarded the Dou Family as supporters. Instead, they were guarded against them, fearing that the Dou Family might drag them down! Dou Yi felt a pang of bitterness and said mournfully, "Young Master, the Dou Family is entirely at your command and only listens to you... Back then, the Tian and Liu families rose with the tide. Distant relatives are also your arms... Why push them away?"

Unexpectedly, Li Yuanping stopped and looked back at him with interest sparkling in his eyes as he smiled and said, "Cousin... My surname is Li! I am a legitimate son of the main family."

With that, he turned and walked away. Dou Yi, startled, dared not speak further and just followed him closely.

The two walked through the mountains for a while and entered a brightly lit large courtyard. Li Yuanping waited at the courtyard entrance for a moment until a female servant hurried out carrying a basin of water. He asked gently, "Has Mother gone to sleep?"

"Madam has washed her feet and is waiting for you in her room!" the female servant answered hastily.

Dou Yi immediately understood that this was Madam Dou's courtyard. Remembering his father's foolish actions and his aunt's tough nature, his legs trembled, and he lamented silently.

My foolish father has caused trouble, yet I have to pay for it. What a plight!

Li Yuanping paid no heed to him and led him into the courtyard. They were greeted by a scene of layers upon layers of pale yellow drapery, with flickering lights and a faint scent of incense wafting through the air. Two female servants stood obediently by the bed.

Li Yuanping kneeled respectfully and greeted softly, "I've arrived, Mother. Congratulations on your breakthrough... The Qi Cultivation Realm is certainly within your reach!"

Madam Dou, sitting upright at the head, was dressed in luxurious clothing, her appearance youthful. Her aura had reached the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and she was now just a step away from the Qi Cultivation Realm, making her one of the most formidable among the external cultivators.

Over the years, Madam Dou had skillfully managed to keep Li Xuanxuan's numerous wives and concubines in check, while also elevating her own family's status in agriculture. Simultaneously, she continued to advance her own cultivation.

"No need for formalities, Ping'er."

Though Madam Dou was known for her stern demeanor, she was unreservedly affectionate toward her child. She immediately invited him to sit. Li Yuanping nodded and recounted the evening's events, including the details of Li Xuanxuan's letter.

Madam Dou listened intently, and by the end, Dou Yi felt his scalp tingle. He glanced up timidly, only to meet a pair of eyes that were as cold and piercing as starlight.

"Come here." Madam Dou's voice was gentle. Dou Yi quickly stood before his aunt. A delicate hand with long nails stained with balsam flowers emerged from behind the drapery. Dou Yi stared blankly at the hand, and with a light flick, Madam Dou beckoned him closer.

SLAP!

Dou Yi received a solid slap across his face, leaving half of it bright red. He dared not show any anger, only bowing repeatedly and pleading, "Mercy, Auntie! Mercy!"

Madam Dou's words drifted gently to his ears. "Go back and deliver this slap to your father. Tell him this..."

She parted her red lips and slowly uttered the words: "Try something funny again and his life will be as good as gone."

————

Meanwhile on Mount Yuting...

Li Qinghong exhaled deeply, her breath visible as a stream of white in the air. The long spear resting on her knees shimmered with mana light. Opening her eyes, which had been nurtured by mana, they sparkled brightly in the dark chamber.

"Second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm..." she mumbled softly.

For the past five years, Li Qinghong had mostly stayed on the mountain to cultivate. She had broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm in the first three years and then reached the second heavenly layer in the subsequent two.

Now in her early twenties, her cultivation speed was notably swift compared to the usual three to five years typically needed for each heavenly layer. Only Li Yuanjiao had progressed slightly faster than her, aided by the Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit talisman.

Rising with her spear, a faint purple hue coursed through her eyes, enhancing her already captivating appearance. As a former Grade Four thunder technique, the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique,

made Li Qinghong's aura exceptionally strong, far surpassing the usual Qi Cultivation Realm of the second heavenly layer.

"Clan Sister..."

A man stood cautiously outside the stone chamber. He was one of Li Xuanxuan's concubine-born sons, lacking a spiritual orifice. Among Li Xuanxuan's numerous offspring, he had little presence and had been sent to manage a town on Mount Yuting.

Li Qinghong's red lips parted slightly, commanding curtly, "Speak."

The man respectfully replied, "Recently, men have been disappearing. For three months, clan cultivators have investigated but found nothing. Three days ago, nine families perished suddenly... We've reported to the main family and were granted permission to seek your aid, Clan Sister."

Li Qinghong nodded slightly and asked in confusion, "What about Uncle?"

The man understood she was referring to Chen Donghe and answered hurriedly, "He has gone to the market with Elder An, to send the furs and spirit items. The Family Head is searching for mountains within the Mount Yue region. We are unsure if he has returned, so..."

"All right." Li Qinghong nodded before taking him up with her in the wind and began asking for more details about the situation.

For the first time in his life, the man experienced the thrill of riding the wind. Looking down at the small town and the passing clouds and birds, a sense of envy overwhelmed him. He eagerly answered Li Qinghong's questions, pointing out directions while feeling a rush of exhilaration.

Following his directions, Li Qinghong descended to find several empty houses with traces of blood left on the ground. With a swift glance, her dharma eyes detected many peculiarities beneath her feet. She set down her clan brother, then with a graceful movement, sketched several runes in the air before casting a talisman.




# Chapter 300: Immortals and Devils

The talisman floated gently in the air, emitting a pale white light that illuminated the surroundings. Bloodstains and severed limbs appeared before them, glowing faintly in the darkness.
𝑓𝑟ℯ𝘦𝓌𝘦𝘣𝑛𝑜𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝑐ℴ𝓂

Li Qinghong glanced around her, a flash of anger in her eyes. The man beside her bowed his head respectfully and reported, "Twenty-seven families, one hundred and ten people... not a single survivor."

Li Qinghong narrowed her eyes as she pressed her spear to the ground, and then cast a spell to investigate, murmuring, "No demonic qi... It was not the work of a demon. It must have been a bloodthirsty cultivator."

Swoosh...

As Li Qinghong was still carefully observing the scene before her, a black dart suddenly shot toward her, imbued with mana light and tied with a dark thread. It traveled in her direction quickly before disappearing into the darkness.

Li Qinghong had been on guard. She flicked her black hair, and with a thrust of her spear, a purple light exploded. The black dart was struck and fell to the ground crookedly.

Li Qinghong called out loudly, "Who dares to seek blood in the Li Family's territory?! You are quite bold to be lurking here, fellow Daoist!"

A black mist surged from the darkness, revealing a withered old man with an unpleasant expression, dragging the black thread on the ground with a clinking sound. The old man glanced at Li Qinghong, frowned, and said, "Why make a big deal out of this, young lady? I have not harmed any of your clan. I am merely passing through your immortal clan's territory, resting here and feeding on some two-legged sheep. You are being overly aggressive... Shouldn't a prestigious clan be more generous?"

Li Qinghong scrutinized him, her eyes brightening. The purple hue in her eyes grew more intense with more ferocity. Hearing the old man refer to "immortal clan's territory" and "two-legged sheep," which were terms used only in the northern Zhao and Yan States, she realized he was from the north and exclaimed joyfully, "So, you are from Jiangbei! Judging by your appearance, you must be a devil cultivator... Let us have a duel and broaden our horizons!"

Without waiting for the old man's reaction, she had already swung her spear at him. The old man had no choice but to roll up his sleeves, puffing out a cloud of black smoke.

Within the smoke, men and women of all ages that were shabbily dressed appeared out of thin air, all with expressions of joy.

Li Qinghong was unfazed. As her spear struck its target, thunder erupted. Thunder was inherently effective against evil, and it quickly dispersed the smoke. The men and women within screamed in agony. The old man, now terrified, cursed loudly, "Damn it, you are a thunder cultivator!"

This was Li Qinghong's first time fighting a non-Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivator. She remained cautious, avoiding close combat. Her spear gathered thunder, which she then hurled at the old man. He took two hits before he could no longer contain his rage and cursed, "How dare a mere Qi Cultivator bully me!"

With that, his robes exploded, revealing a thin and decayed body. He let out a loud roar, and from his abdomen emerged a mass of flesh which quickly transformed into a giant, bald green head with two bloodshot red eyes the size of heads, staring straight ahead. The eyes were dreadfully bloodshot and teary, and his sharp, white teeth gleamed brilliantly.

"So, this is a devil cultivator... Truly a monstrous sight to behold!"

Li Qinghong thrust her spear once more, with thunder rippling out like water.

The monstrous creature spat out a bloody mist, nullifying her attack, and cursed, "Damn it, watch your mouth! I cultivate the Path of Benevolent Devil, which is more humane than your Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao!"

At this moment, the aura around the monstrous creature had risen to the sixth or seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Although he was cursing harshly, he showed no real intent to fight.

He was, after all, a devil cultivator who had attained the status of a Master Monk, equivalent to the Foundation Establishment Realm in the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. He had been consuming humans along the way without any issues, until today. He simply could not restrain his gluttony and had eaten a bit too much. Now, he regretted it.

Most prestigious clanswould not trouble him unnecessarily, considering the reputation of both sides. However, if he encountered a clan who brought the matter to light, he would be at a disadvantage. Hence, he could not afford to injure Li Qinghong.

"I have heard the Li Family is a sword immortal family. Since this girl is proficient in thunder techniques... Her background must be extraordinary."

The devil cultivator found himself in a difficult position—unable to retaliate against Li Qinghong's relentless thunder attacks or escape without compromising his dignity as a Master Monk. His only choice was to endure, hoping that an elder from the Li Family would arrive soon to defuse the situation.

Li Qinghong, after two strikes, realized that this old man was definitely stronger than her, likely at the sixth or seventh heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm. Despite his strength, he seemed reluctant to fight, leading to a stalemate. She took out a jade pendant and silently crushed it, thinking, I haven't even used my talisman qi yet... If this old devil decides to kill, I should be able hold out until reinforcements arrive.

Lightning crackled at the foot of Mount Yuting. Despite the devil cultivator's superior strength, he struggled against Li Qinghong's forceful and aggressive thunder attacks. His cultivation appeared to be waning, driving him into a state of panic. He shouted, "Stop, young lady! Your technique is damaging my cultivation. If this continues, I will be forced to retaliate seriously!"

Li Qinghong paused slightly, noticing two beams of mana light approaching from both sides. One person arrived with a sword, looking anxious and fierce, while the other, appearing in his forties or fifties, looked solemn and stern, shouting, "Who dares to cause trouble in the Li Family's territory?"

It was Li Yuanjiao and Tian Youdao. Tian Youdao had also successfully broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, becoming the third external Qi Cultivator of the Li Family. He cultivated a Grade Two technique provided to external families and had broken through using the Minor Pure Spiritual Qi.

The two landed beside Li Qinghong with Li Yuanjiao remaining vigilant, thinking to himself, This person arrived at a convenient time, just as An Zheyan and Uncle Donghe were away... Only a few of us are left at home. We might not be able to handle him without alarming the ancestor.

The devil cultivator, seeing more people arriving, quickly undid his bloody devilish form and returned to his human appearance. With a hint of bitterness, he introduced himself, "I am Murong Xia. I came to the south for a journey, passing through the immortal clan's territories. Indeed.... I consumed some two-legged sheep. If I have caused offense, I seek your forgiveness. They were merely mortals, not worth making enemies over."

Li Yuanjiao frowned upon hearing this. Li Qinghong whispered, "Twenty-seven families, one hundred and ten people."

Murong Xia was stunned. Though old, he understood from Li Qinghong's words that these people did not resent him for taking without asking, but genuinely despised him for eating humans.

He immediately cupped his fist and responded sincerely, "You have lived in Jiangnan for a long time and may not be familiar with our devil sect's teachings. The immortal sects often said that we devil cultivators are inherently evil and revel in eating humans, but this is a big misunderstanding."

Li Yuanjiao and the others found his words rather amusing and exchanged quick glances with each other. They watched Murong Xia continue earnestly, "Even those facing death are allowed their last words. Please hear me out and do not condemn all devil cultivators."

Li Yuanjiao, seeing more and more townspeople gathering with uneasy looks on their faces, frowned and said, "This is not the place to talk. Please come with us to the mountain."

"Fine!" Murong Xia agreed surprisingly without fear, nodding.

Li Yuanjiao gestured politely, and the group headed up the mountain together despite the tension earlier. Li Qinghong sneered and transmitted her voice. "Eating humans is eating humans... Can he really talk his way out of this?"

Li Yuanjiao silently shook his head and replied through mana voice transmission, "The mountain has a grand formation and the ancestor's suppression. Once he enters the formation, we can handle him as we please."

Murong Xia sat casually on a wooden chair on the mountain, smiling at the crowd. His gaze lingered on Li Qinghong for a moment before he spoke.

"My Murong Family cultivates orthodox devil Dao that has ancient roots. Cultivators nurture a Euphoria Head within their stomach for cultivation. This is the most orthodox form of devil cultivation, even a Maha or Dharma Master would find no fault with it."

He paused, observing Li Qinghong's shaking of her head, and continued softly, "You all know the state of this world. Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivators grow people for consumption, and the Maha and Dharma Masters cycle through endless reincarnations. For mortals, life is nothing but suffering... something that is worse than death. It would be better for them to be consumed by me."

Li Qinghong sneered and retorted bluntly, "It is precisely because of people like you, who consume humans, that mortals endure a fate worse than death. It's not that life is so unbearable that being devoured would be a preferable option. Fellow Daoist, isn't it rather excessive to twist reality for the sake of self-deception?"

Murong Xia raised his eyebrows and said earnestly, "Not at all. Devil cultivation is about saving all beings. My Murong Family cultivates the Euphoria Realm precisely for this reason... Without it, we would not consume humans."

He paused again, looked at the crowd, and continued calmly, "Within the Euphoria Head lies the Euphoria Realm. There are fine wines, exquisite delicacies, luxurious clothing, and untold riches, where men and women indulge without the burdens of life and death, free from the worries of conflict and torment... Endless pleasure and happiness await within. Those consumed by me enter this realm, shedding their mortal flesh to become immortal souls. As long as I, Murong Xia, continue my cultivation, they will revel in eternal delights. Isn't that wonderful?"

His words were like a stone thrown into a lake, causing everyone to look at each other in astonishment and rendering Li Qinghong momentarily speechless.

Murong Xia sighed and shook his head, continuing, "We are compassionate. The devil sect is benevolent. When devil cultivators fight, the victor gathers the souls of the defeated into their realm, where they enjoy eternal pleasures. If everyone practiced devil cultivation, only cultivators would suffer while mortals would enjoy eternal bliss in this sacred land of eternal joy!"

Murong Xia's face showed compassion, and a faint halo of light appeared behind his head.

Li Yuanjiao frowned and said, "This is just your claim. Who knows if you consume people or gather their souls? If it is truly a virtuous deed, why does your devil form take on such a grotesque and gory appearance, and why does the world detest cultivators like you?"

Murong Xia laughed and waved his hand dismissively. The sound of the breeze, accompanied by the sounds of music and the laughter of men, women, and children, came from his stomach.

Before them appeared a green soul, bowing respectfully and saying, "Greetings immortal masters, I am Cao Yangxuan, a resident of the town at the base of Mount Yuting."

Li Yuanjiao and the others were taken aback. The town's head, who was Li Yuanjiao's concubine-born younger brother, stepped forward and conversed briefly with the soul. Shortly after, he returned, saying, "Family Head, I know that person. His voice and appearance are exactly as they were when he was still alive."

Murong Xia laughed heartily. The devil soul kneeled with a thud and said, "We are grateful for all that the clan has done for us. It's a great kindness that we could never repay, not even in ten lifetimes. Now that I have been enlightened by the Master Monk and achieved eternal bliss, I come with one request..."

Li Yuanjiao felt a sense of foreboding and asked, "Speak."

The devil soul bowed respectfully and replied, "At the entrance of the village is an old farmer named Cao Ye, my father. We lived in hardship. Now that I have received this great opportunity, I hope the Family Head can bring my father here, cleanse him thoroughly, and let this Master Monk consume him so that we can reunite in bliss and enjoy eternal happiness together..."

"Absurd!"

Before Li Yuanjiao could even respond, Li Qinghong, unable to listen any longer, frowned and spat out a bolt of thunder, interrupting the spell. The devil soul, already a remnant soul, was instantly destroyed by the thunder.

Murong Xia was furious and cursed, "What a cruel woman! What a vicious heart!"

Li Qinghong, feeling a tinge of guilt as she watched the soul dissipate, raised her eyebrows and retorted sharply, "Your entire cultivation is based on falsehood. Your so-called land of bliss is just an illusion!"

"Illusion?" Murong Xia sneered and replied, "What right do you have to decide for others? Go ask the mortals if they prefer to continue struggling in this world or enter my so-called illusory Euphoria Realm?"

Turning away from Li Qinghong, Murong Xia addressed Li Yuanjiao, "As for the Family Head's claim that our devil Dao is grotesque and detestable, it is because we conceal our utmost kindness and beauty within our bellies, using our outward appearance to bear the blame. The elders of my family are all good people who could discuss Dao with the Mahas and Dharma Masters."

Murong Xia's voice echoed through the courtyard, and he continued through gritted teeth, "In my humble opinion, it is the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivators who are truly selfish and self-serving! They appear ethereal and transcendent, but seek only personal transcendence... regarding all other beings as mere ants. That, I argue, is the true essence of the devil Dao! We may appear hideous and act outrageously, but at our core, we are the genuine immortal cultivators!"

"Heh!" Li Qinghong was both amused and angered. Many of the one hundred and fifteen corpses had not yet cooled, and the dismembered limbs and blood still painted the town red. Yet, this devil cultivator had the gall to accuse them of such atrocities. She coldly replied, "Our Daos are fundamentally different!"

The old monk shook his head and patted his belly as he laughed. "Either we fight it out, or you let me go. Family Head, you must decide wisely!"

The tension in the courtyard rose. Li Yuanjiao stroked the hilt of his sword quietly, listening intently to something. After a moment, he exhaled deeply and waved his hand.

"Please leave, fellow Daoist. Do not come to our territory to consume humans again. If this happens again, you won't escape so easily."
𝚏𝗿𝗲𝐞𝚠𝕖𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝕖𝚕.𝚌𝗼𝗺

"Thank you, Family Head!" Murong Xia cupped his fists and strode out of the courtyard, flying away on the wind.

Tian Youdao and the others glanced at the siblings and wisely withdrew. Li Qinghong smoothed her hair and sat down to the side, laughing.

"That old fellow, claiming that his family elders are cultured and that they are true immortal cultivators inside, is clearly afraid!"

Li Yuanjiao still held the Dragon Coiling Pillar sword and replied, "Who would not be? It is like poking a wolf with a stick; both sides are scared. He fears our reputation as sword immortals, but we have never fought devil cultivators and are just as nervous. That old fellow appears to be only at the seventh or eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, but he has cultivated something so sinister that his strength must be at the Foundation Establishment Realm. This is the first time such a powerful cultivator has come to our territory."

The two exchanged a glance, avoiding the topic of the hundred-odd innocent deaths. Li Yuanjiao sighed softly and said, "We can only do what we can. Driving him away is the best outcome. There are more and more devil cultivators in Jiangnan these days... Peaceful days will be hard to come by."

Li Qinghong nodded slightly and asked, "The devil plague in Yue State... Did Sister-In-Law get any news from the Xiao Family?"

Li Yuanjiao shook his head and replied, "No news yet. But... there is some news from the Yuan Family."

Li Qinghong raised an eyebrow as Li Yuanjiao continued with concern, "Yuan Tuan from Qingsui Peak has gone into seclusion to prepare for breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. According to the Yuan Family, Yuan Tuan has a great chance of succeeding within four or five years. If she does, the legacy of Qingsui Peak will fall to her, and she will undoubtedly take on disciples and pass on her teachings. Our Li Family cannot miss this opportunity to establish influence within the sect!"

Li Qinghong immediately understood Li Yuanjiao's implication and furrowed her delicate brows, responding, "Brother, you have... Xizhi in mind, right?"

To send someone to Qingsui Peak, they must be at least seven years old, preferably between ten and twelve. Li Yuanping was not yet married. Li Yuanyun had two children, but one was too young, and the older one, though possessing a spiritual orifice, would be too old by then. They were not suitable candidates.

Currently, the only one in the generation of Xi and Yue was Li Yuanjiao's son, Li Xizhi, who was four or five years old. In four or five years, he would meet Qingsui Peak's requirements. Seeing Li Qinghong pondering this, Li Yuanjiao nodded and said, "If Xizhi has the talent, we'll have to send him there."

Li Qinghong pursed her lips together and asked, "Will Sister-In-Law agree?"

Li Yuanjiao drank his tea, recalling the moment when Li Tongya had personally handed him the gleaming Dragon Coiling Pillar sword and remained silent.

————

While Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong were deep in discussion on Mount Lijing, the small courtyard at the foot of the mountain was brightly lit. Several tables had been set up in the courtyard, adorned with plates of rare mountain delicacies and various dipping sauces on the side.

A young man, appearing to be seventeen or eighteen at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, sat reclined in a chair.

"Come, come!"

The young man at the head of the table had a slightly pale face and colorless lips. He looked at the person seated below and smiled. "Brother Xiao Xian, are you comfortable here?"

"Oh yes... Comfortable! Very comfortable!" Xiao Xian replied quickly. Having visited the Li Family frequently over the years, he was quite familiar with Li Yuanping. Despite their age difference, Xiao Xian always felt somewhat restrained in Li Yuanping's presence, never quite able to relax completely or let his guard down. Perhaps this was due to the domineering aura Li Yuanping had inherited from Madam Dou.

Li Yuanping smiled. His appearance leaned more toward Madam Dou—dignified and strong, with an air of grandeur. He adjusted the cup on the table and brought up a topic, asking, "Why does your clan suddenly need ebony ore?"

Xiao Xian cupped his fists and replied, "The devil plague is rampant, and the price of dharma artifacts is rising daily... My family happens to have a fire vein and a tradition of smithing, so my father thought of taking this opportunity to make some profit."

"I see!" Li Yuanping said as he nodded slightly and glanced at Xiao Xian, then brought up a couple of topics related to Li Qingxiao. Xiao Xian listened attentively, and as the conversation flowed, they began to open up. Li Yuanping then asked, "Brother Xiao Xian, how much do you know about the situation in the Great Xu State to the north?"

Xiao Xian, slightly tipsy by now, noticed Li Yuanping's composed expression and inwardly praised his remarkable tolerance. He replied, "A few years ago, you asked me to investigate... I've learned a bit more since then."

He paused and continued, "For nearly a hundred years, the immortal Dao in Xu State has been declining, with demonic and devil cultivators emerging everywhere... It was not until four years ago that the three sects and seven gates united with the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of Jiangnan, advancing northward and driving back many of the devil sects. The main forces in this war were the Golden Feather Sect and the Yue Cultivating Sect, led by the peak Purple Mansion Realm sword immortal, Daoist Master Shangyuan. He killed two Merciful Ones and three other demons before finally bringing stability back to Xu State."

At this point, Xiao Xian hesitated briefly, but then continued, "As for the Dao foundations of these Purple Mansion Realms that you asked me to investigate... it was challenging! I managed to gather some information from various sources. The Daoist Maser from the Azure Pond Sect practices Heavy Murk, while the one from the Profound Peak Gate practices Fool's Mountain Chase. The Golden Tang Gate, whose Daoist Master rarely shows up, practices Engraved Stone. Lastly, the Daoist Master from the Purple Smoke Gate practices East Mountain Loop."

Xiao Xian took a sip of wine and continued explaining, "These Daoist Masters had left many traces during their training before achieving the Purple Mansion Realm. I searched through my family's library for a long time to piece together their immortal foundations."

"Thank you, brother!" Li Yuanping responded, silently noting down the information. Xiao Xian did not understand why Li Yuanping was gathering this information but wisely refrained from asking.

"Brother, you have great tolerance, I can barely keep up..."

After exchanging a few more cups of spirit wine, Xiao Xian, with his lower cultivation, began to feel dizzy and smiled in defeat as he announced his intention to depart.

Li Yuanping, having obtained the information he needed, did not detain Xiao Xian any longer. He watched as Xiao Xian was escorted out by the Xiao family servants. Throughout their lengthy drinking session, Li Yuanping discreetly filled his cup with clear tea, ensuring his sobriety while maintaining the appearance of indulgence.

He cleared the table, laid out the brush and ink, and carefully recorded the information before folding it neatly and handing it to a trusted aide. "Give this to my brother," he instructed gently.

Li Yuanping and Li Yuanxiu were both born of Madam Dou and under her influence, they had shed much of the ruthless cunning that came from the Li Family's grassroots origins, replacing it with a grand, authoritative demeanor.

Dou Yi, seated below, took the letter. Li Yuanping glanced at him, and Dou Yi could not help but recall the long nails that were always stained with balsam flowers. Li Yuanping chuckled and asked, "Did you deliver that slap from my mother to your father?"

Dou Yi nodded hastily, stammering, "Yes, young master... I did! Father kneeled in the courtyard himself... I conveyed every word exactly as it was, even replicating the strength. The red mark is still on his face..."

"Hahaha!" Li Yuanping laughed heartily and shook his head, saying boldly, "You people fear power but lack respect. My brother has shown leniency repeatedly out of respect for Mother, but he shows no restraint. Now he has lost face and damaged our relationship, and he has only himself to blame!"

Dou Yi dared not say anything, simply responding timidly. Li Yuanping glanced at the letter in Dou Yi's hand, and this action scared him enough to send him scurrying off. Only then did Li Yuanping turn back to his desk, muttering, "However, I still do not know what the Dao Partner of this immortal foundation called Spring's Echo that uses the Cave Spring Clear Qi is..."

He flipped through the wooden slips on his desk, a deep frown forming on his face.

"The three sects and seven gates control information too tightly... If our family is to find a way out, we need information within the sect. We cannot delay any longer!"

Li Yuanping stared at the flickering candle, recalling the secret conversations he had with his brother Li Yuanjiao by the bed when they were younger, and the glittering Dragon Coiling Pillar sword that Li Tongya had personally handed over to his brother.

His face grew paler, and he muttered, "The Xiao Family is ultimately an external family... Xiao Chuting is cunning and is surely plotting something. He is not easy to deal with. But... our family has no choice but to rely on him for now. We can only take one step at a time..."




# Chapter 303: Minghui

Xiao Xian left the courtyard quietly. The cold wind sobered him up instantly. He walked a few steps up the stone stairs, gusts of wind blowing all around him. In an attempt to curry favor, a servant stepped forward, saying, "You are truly devoted to Lady Qingxiao, Young Master Xiao. You even allow Li Yuanping to boss you around, all for her sake... Everyone can see it. Lady Qingxiao must be deeply moved!"

Xiao Xian nodded with indifference, inhaling the scent of incense wafting through the air in Lijing Town. He was a kind-hearted person, so he did not mind the servant speaking casually and using phrases like "boss around."

The servant, seeing him silent, could only follow quietly. He had indeed hit the nail on the head. Preoccupied with his own thoughts, Xiao Xian rubbed the jade ring on his finger absentmindedly.

Although he was indeed fond of Li Qingxiao, he did not feel that he was as devoted as everyone said he was. His actions were not solely driven by self-interest but were also in the best interest of the entire Mount Yu branch.

"Ancestor Chuchou was always kind toward our branch, but he died of old age last year. Our family lost its support, and my father has become increasingly worried... These years have become more and more difficult..."

Xiao Jiuqing was a charming man with many offspring, many of whom possessed spiritual orifices. Xiao Xian's talent was not particularly good, so he never mattered much to Xiao Jiuqing.

Accompanying Xiao Guiluan to the Li Family that year had changed Xiao Xian's fate. He returned home with two pieces of pastry, wet and sticky, and told his mother everything. Her sharp instincts, honed from years of fighting and scheming in the mansion, quickly identified key points to leverage.

She called Xiao Jiuqing and exaggerated the story to him, delighting him in the process. Caught between fear and uncertainty, Xiao Xian suddenly found himself unable to avoid the Li Family. Rumors began to spread about a fated connection between the two, and Xiao Xian felt compelled to visit the Li Family.

"What kind of fate is this..."

For the past few years, Xiao Xian had been diligent, unable to tell if it was due to family pressure or his feelings for Li Qingxiao. He smiled wryly. Without Xiao Jiuqing's many resources and connections, Xiao Xian, with his limited cultivation, would never have been able to obtain such secretive information to share with Li Yuanping.

As the evening breeze brushed past his face, Xiao Xian sobered up even more. He had not actually drunk much spirit wine, but being around Li Yuanping always made him uneasy, causing him to find an excuse to leave the courtyard after a few cups.

In the darkness, Mount Lijing lay silently. Xiao Xian turned to look at the mountain, which was coiled like a serpent dragon. A faint sense of fear rose in his heart.

The Li Family has the appearance of wolf leaders. They are probably crouching and hiding now, but they would never be content living under our Xiao Family or even the Azure Pond Sect... Our family's alliance with the Li Family might bring disaster in the end...

The servant, bending over to serve, noticed Xiao Xian's gaze fixed on Mount Lijing and said softly, "Young Master, this mountain's earth veins are shallow, and its spiritual energy is thin. It cannot be considered a famous mountain."

"Famous mountain?" Xiao Xian chuckled, shook his head, and regained his composure. He slowly walked away, uttering another simple statement to his servant.

"You never know."

————

Mount Lijing was illuminated from top to bottom with golden candlelight flickering throughout the mountain, making the darkness of the mountain less frightening.

High above in the clouds, Li Tongya stood in mid-air, holding a tightly wrapped long sword on his back. He stared expressionlessly at the person in front of him.

This person had a kind face but was plump with large ears. He wore a brownish-yellow robe and held a golden glowing monk staff in his hand. The golden rings on the staff clanged together, emitting a faint tinkling sound. He stared calmly at Li Tongya, a halo of colorful light swirling behind his head.

"Murong Xia has already left our territory. Even if you use your spiritual sense to search, you will not find him. Master Monk, you have been confronting me for a long time; you should be satisfied now!" Li Tongya spoke slowly, his tone still calm, although his heart was boiling with anger.

He had instructed Li Yuanjiao to let Murong Xia go out of sheer necessity. This Buddhist monk had been holding him back, and without using the mirror, he could not deal with them and was even at a disadvantage.

"Your generosity is greatly appreciated, Benefactor. Minghui is deeply grateful!" the Buddhist monk said as he nodded slightly, the golden light suppressing Li Tongya gradually fading. Li Tongya also retracted his mana, feeling a slight sense of relief.

Li Tongya had been cultivating on the mountain when Li Qinghong shattered the jade talisman for help, startling him. Although Murong Xia only displayed the power of roughly the sixth to seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, Li Tongya genuinely felt threatened and was prepared to act. However, this unknown Buddhist monk had intercepted him.

Without another word, the monk raised his staff and emitted golden light, forcibly suppressing Li Tongya. After exchanging dozens of blows, Li Tongya felt his internal organs burning like fire and realized that he was not the monk's match. He had no choice but to hold the monk off until Murong Xia left the territory, at which point the tension eased.

"To think a Buddhist monk would protect a devil cultivator who eats humans... Master Monk, you have quite the heart!" Li Tongya mocked blandly.

Minghui, the monk, smiled softly and replied, "You are mistaken, Benefactor... Murong Xia merely removed these people's physical forms to bring them salvation. It is a great fortune for these two-legged sheep to enter the Euphoria Realm, a grand blessing that can only be achieved over nine lifetimes!"

Li Tongya sneered without responding. Minghui formed a hand seal and explained, "I am the top disciple of the Lotus Temple, ordered to escort Murong Xia south. If there has been any offense, please forgive me. There will be blessings in return.

"Murong Xia follows the Virtuous Benevolence Devil Dao, which is also part of my Virtuous Benevolence Zen Dao. He was ordered to go south and consume 106,756 people. Afterward, he will meditate in Linghai Prefecture to achieve enlightenment, become a Maha, and reform into the Virtuous Benevolence Zen Dao, bringing these 106,756 people into the land of blessings. It is a meritorious deed."

Li Tongya has heard of the eloquence of Buddhist monks and now experienced it firsthand. He avoided engaging further and replied directly, "The south is the domain of my immortal sect. Have your Buddhist sect obtained permission?"

Minghui nodded slightly and answered, "The immortal sect reclaimed Xu State and killed our Merciful Ones... This allowed Murong Xia to go south as an exchange. The Sword Immortal should be aware of this. If there has been any offense, I will personally go to the southern border to apologize."

Li Tongya, understanding why the monk was being so polite, realized it was due to Li Chejing's influence. While the immortal sect appeared mighty by reclaiming Xu State, it was merely an exchange of interests behind the scenes.

Despite his disdain for their methods, Li Tongya had to acquiesce.

"I see."

Minghui retracted his staff. Seeing that Li Tongya was a reasonable man, he smiled warmly. "I see that your clan governs benevolently, akin to our teachings. It must be fate! Why not let me stay here and spread our teachings...?"

Li Tongya immediately shook his head, wanting nothing to do with the Buddhist sect and hoping the monk would leave as soon as possible. He replied, "Your duty is to escort Murong Xia. Do not tarry."

His refusal was evident, but Minghui feigned ignorance and asked again with a smile, "Murong Xia has multiple monks escorting him; they do not need me. Your clan and our teachings are fated..."

"We are just a small clan, unworthy of hosting a great monk like you," Li Tongya had to refuse bluntly.

Minghui did not take offense, and instead replied, "Very well, then. However, I have one more question for you, Benefactor."




# Chapter 304: Backlash

Li Tongya frowned and nodded, while Minghui's expression was serious. He carefully observed Li Tongya's face and warmly explained, "My master is a Maha. Once, there was a demon under his tutelage, who was merely a demon soldier at the time. My master calculated its fate and discovered that its opportunity to achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm lay in the Xu State. He spent much mana and destiny to determine that the opportunity would arise in Mount Bianyan within the Xu State. Thus, he sent the demon there to cultivate and await the right moment."

Minghui waved the staff in his hand, producing a series of clinking sounds that echoed in the air like an eagle's cry. He continued, "Later, I became a Master Monk. Knowing that the time had come, my master sent me to Mount Bianyan to capture the demon as a spirit beast mount. Who would have thought that after walking for over three years, I ended up empty-handed!"

Realization immediately struck Li Tongya. The wolf demon he had hunted on Mount Bianyan years ago had spoken of a destined opportunity—this must have been what it referred to. At the time, however, Li Tongya had dismissed its baseless claims and had captured and killed the creature.

Knowing this in his heart, Li Tongya's expression remained unchanged. He smiled and said, "If your master had calculated its fate, then it was destined to be so. Now that things have gone awry, either your master miscalculated or the demon was restless and lost its life on its own. Even if it was related to us, it was fate. How can you question me, an immortal cultivator?"

Minghui forced a smile, despite suspecting that the Li Family was involved. He felt rather helpless in this situation.

The many battles between Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Mount Bianyan had already made it difficult to maintain the fabricated fate. Minghui had hoped to see if he could extort Li Tongya, but this man was eloquent and skillfully turned his arguments around, leaving Minghui speechless.

Feeling frustrated, he could only smile and say, "Your fate is set, and I will not interfere. Moongaze Lake is a serene place. If one of my sect's great masters reincarnates there, I hope you will take care of them, Benefactor."

Li Tongya had heard of many Buddhist methods. Once one became a Maha or Dharma Master, they could preserve a bit of their true spirit, seeking vessels to reincarnate into generation after generation. Buddhists called this the Dao of Reincarnation. Even in their infancy, they would realize they were a Maha and resume their cultivation across lifetimes, which was indeed quite sinister.

Despite his patience, Li Tongya did not expect Minghui to be so shameless as to target his descendants. Coldly, he replied, "Your Buddhist sect may play with reincarnation in the north, but do not even think about targeting my descendants! If any Mahas dare to seize the body of my kin, I, Li Tongya, will personally strangle the reincarnated child and never allow you to use my family as you please!"

Minghui laughed, waving his hands repeatedly, and responded, "Why so angry, Benefactor? It was just a joke. Our sect rarely reincarnates in the south. Even if we do, we do not take the bodies of immortal clans. It is an unwritten rule. Moreover, your family is a sword immortal clan... We would not dare offend you."

Despite Minghui's respectful words, his tone and actions were condescending. Li Tongya, unwilling to engage further, cupped his fist and said curtly, "Then, I bid you farewell!"

After saying this, he then rode the wind back to the mountains, not wishing to speak with the man any further.

Minghui nodded slightly, watching Li Tongya descend into the mountains. He squinted for a moment, his eyes flashing with colorful light, staring at the people below him. His eyes lingered on Li Qinghong for a moment, mumbling to himself, "Thunder techniques... seem closely related to our Buddhist teachings! This girl is beautiful; she would make a fine servant to tend to the artifacts."

Minghui had his own dharma artifact—a golden palace filled with handsome men and beautiful women, where he cultivated alone. Seeing Li Qinghong's heroic appearance, he was tempted even more, pondering to himself, The south is in chaos now, and that sword immortal is far away in the southern border... If I cast my spell properly and abduct this girl, who could say anything..?

As his desire grew, Minghui began performing a series of hand seals to change his form and attempt to capture the girl. However, a sense of unease made him hesitate. Thinking it over, he decided, I feel uneasy. The Li Family is protected by a sword immortal... I better calculate her fate to avoid any possible mishaps, even if it costs considerable time and mana.

Minghui raised his finger, a colorful light flashing in his hand. He stood with his eyes closed, calculating for a while, and then murmured, "I see... She's Li Tongya's legitimate granddaughter... This could be troublesome. He might fight me to death... Alas! Her cultivation is at the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and she is skilled in spear techniques..."

Minghui was deep in his calculations when he suddenly froze, still in mid-air like an immovable statue. His plump face immediately became rigid and expressionless. Though he had cultivated a flawless body, which theoretically meant he could not shed tears or sweat, he began to tremble violently. Tiny beads of sweat appeared on his large face, growing larger and rolling over his smooth skin.

Minghui's eyes widened, the colorful light in his hand growing brighter, floating like a star. Yet, he wore a sorrowful expression, not daring to move. He felt an overwhelming sense of danger suffocating him as his legs grew weak, and he was about to cough up blood.

Merciful Buddha! If my finger moves even a fraction more and I continue this calculation, I will perish! There will be no chance of survival!

A premonition echoed in his mind, making Minghui's limbs tremble. He gritted his teeth, cursing inwardly, This must be connected to some powerful being, at least a Golden Core Realm cultivator! Damn it... How could such a powerful entity be involved in such a desolate place? This is a disaster... Being annihilated is no joke!

Minghui had not yet attained the status of a Maha, but as a Buddhist cultivator, he was proficient in matters of past and future. Under normal circumstances, he could retain his true spirit and reincarnate after death.

However, he deeply understood that if he continued to calculate this fate, he would be utterly destroyed, leaving no trace of his true spirit. Not even Maha would be able to survive, let alone a Master Monk like himself.

Sweating profusely, Minghui struggled to suppress the spell in his hand. However, the spell was already halfway formed, and it would be difficult to stop it now. He could only watch helplessly as the colorful light in his hand grew brighter, causing his eyelids to twitch uncontrollably.

POOF!

Minghui had no choice but to reverse the spell, spitting out a mouthful of blood as he attempted to suppress the spell. He freed one hand to form a seal and conjured a golden, glittering palace. It was exquisitely crafted, with pavilions and towers, filled with handsome men and beautiful women walking barefoot.

"Go!"

Minghui painfully activated the dharma artifact, using his palm as a blade to sever the hand that was holding the colorful spell. His body, strangely devoid of blood and flesh, resembled sticky dough, with a thin trail of dough trailing from the severed hand.

Although detached from his body, the hand remained under his control, which still held the spell. Minghui then directed the golden palace toward it, opening all its doors and windows to absorb the golden light and mist. The severed hand then floated into the palace.

"Phew..."

It was only then did Minghui breathe a sigh of relief. He looked at the colorful light and severed hand suppressed within the dharma artifact. With a forceful pull, a new hand extended from his stump, white and clean like dough.

"What a mess!" Minghui cried out in grief and indignation.




# Chapter 305: Branch Line

Minghui had barely managed to shout out his curses when the golden temple began to sway and tremble all over, emanating waves of mana light. His expression immediately turned to one of terror, knowing that the Golden Core Realm cultivator he had connected with must have been able to hear him.

He hurriedly cried out, "Spare me, Senior! Spare me! Minghui is the disciple of Maha Jinlian from the Lotus Sect, which upholds the Dharma Characteristics Dao lineage! Please spare my life and I promise never to set foot on the lake again!"

The golden temple shook for a moment before gradually stabilizing. Minghui performed a deep bow in the air for a long time before he even dared to rise, then flew away.

Minghui tested his newly grown arm and glanced into the golden palace artifact. He saw a dazzling ball of colorful light still floating within, while the severed arm had already turned into a pool of white liquid. The palace rumbled under the strain, and the handsome men and beautiful dancers within were screaming and shouting like ants on a hot pan.

"What a pity!"

These people had been collected by Minghui from all over the northern regions, each with outstanding appearances. He had invested much effort in them, and now they were about to be scorched to death by the colorful light.

Minghui cursed under his breath and said, "Abandon your physical forms and come to my temple! Maha is within reach, once I establish my paradise, there will be plenty of pleasure for you all!"

He then raised the golden palace above his head, opening his mouth wide to reveal his white teeth and pink tongue. His saliva glistened like dewdrops, exuding a faintly exotic fragrance.

He gave a forceful shake, causing fingernail-sized figures to tumble right into his mouth. Minghui's pristine teeth bit down, sending severed limbs and flesh flying everywhere, with crimson trails flowing over his tender lips. The attendants in the temple were overjoyed, however, gladly leaping into his mouth.

After several dozen breaths, Minghui licked his lips, saying in great contentment, "First, I will replenish my vital qi, then return to ask the Maha if I can preserve my golden palace!"

Minghui cast a wary glance in the direction of Mount Lijing, not daring to even think about Li Qinghong. Having narrowly escaped death, he was utterly terrified, thinking to himself, This Li Family must be backed by some venerable figure I've never heard of... I'll have to ask my master about it when I return. I should leave now!

Not until Minghui left, like a defeated dog, did the turmoil finally settle. However, the area beneath Mount Yuting remained blood-stained, with filth all the way from the threshold to the steps. The neighbors worked together to clean up the mess, shivering as they returned to their homes.

————

Mount Yuting had long been under the An Family's rule, only to fall into the Li Family's hands in recent years. The common people had been accustomed to hard days, and even when the devil cultivator, Murong Xia caused a stir, the deaths of over a hundred people seemed insignificant compared to the better days under the Li Family's rule.

When people encountered each other, they would merely ask who had passed and lament briefly, "Such a pity... we're finally living good days."

Li Yuanjiao threw himself into the various affairs of Mount Wutu while Li Yuanping took over the family matters, gradually becoming busier. He held a vermilion brush and lightly marked the wooden slips on the desk before him.

Innate illness made Li Yuanping appear frail and weak, his eyebrows constantly furrowed as if weighed down by countless heavy burdens that he could not relieve from his shoulders. Even when sitting in the most honored position in the courtyard, he still exuded an air of anxiety.

"This year's harvest is somewhat better, reducing some losses," Li Yuanping mumbled to himself. He glanced at the middle-aged man serving by his side and spoke gently. "Clan Uncle, you have been working in the Clan Affairs Courtyard for many years... As I am new to managing the family, I hope you can guide me."

The elderly man beside him, with sunken eyes and graying temples, looked gaunt and haggard though his clothes were meticulously tidy. This was Li Xiewen, an old man who had managed the household during Li Xuanxuan's rule. He was the son of Li Yesheng and was now nearly fifty years old.

The people from the northern slopes of Mount Dali matured early, marrying and having children by the age of twelve or thirteen, and lived only to their forties or fifties. Li Xiewen, devoid of any cultivation, was at the age where he should have been bedridden, just waiting by the death's door. Years of hard work and dedication had earned him several spirit items to nourish himself, allowing him to maintain a relatively healthy appearance.

However, Li Pingyi's suicide had struck this old man hard, causing him to wither. Although the main family sent people to console him, it symbolized that his lineage had completely faded from the center of power. Li Xiewen, clinging to his position, sought to salvage whatever he could.

Upon hearing Li Yuanping's inquiry, Li Xiewen quickly responded modestly, "I have worked in the Clan Affairs Courtyard for many years and merely have a keen ear... I wouldn't dare to give guidance."

Li Yuanping waved his hand, and the old man began, "Currently, there are only three among the non-main lineage Qi Cultivators in the family practicing authentic techniques—An Zheyan at the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, Chen Donghe at the fourth heavenly layer, and Tian Youdao at the first heavenly layer. As for the unrefined Qi Cultivators, there are Li Qiuyang and Old Master Ren. Unrefined Qi Cultivators merely hold the title of Qi Cultivators and are not worth consideration. Additionally, there are two at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, three at the fifth stage, ten at the fourth stage, and a hundred and fifteen minor cultivators below that stage... mostly useless old fellows."

Li Yuanping nodded slightly. Li Xiewen continued, "The Clan Affairs Courtyard has two Embryonic Breathing Realms cultivators at the fifth stage and three at the fourth stage, with countless scouts below the fourth stage and among mortals. Though the family has many external cultivators, only a few are worth noting."

Li Yuanping offered him a seat and had the servants serve tea, then said, "I appreciate your advice, Clan Uncle."

Li Xiewen thanked him, his expression calm. His voice still held deep respect when he continued on.

"The most powerful is Madam Dou of the Dou Family, at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, with many followers. Though the Dou Family lacks a prestigious name, it possesses substantial influence, owning private spirit fields and forming connections, exhibiting great power."

Li Yuanping moved the tea on the desk, staring quietly at Li Xiewen who was oblivious to his gaze. Li Xiewen simply shook his head and pointed to Dou Yi who sat below, who immediately shrank back and looked as if he wanted to crawl into the ground right then and there.

"As you can see, the Dou Family has already placed people around the young master."

Li Yuanping laughed, then replied, "I am already aware of the Dou Family."

Dou Yi, who was sitting below, possessed cultivation himself. However, when in front of Madam Dou and Li Yuanping, he cowered. Now, being pointed at and criticized by an old mortal man, he felt a surge of anger in his heart. He raised his head cautiously, only to meet Li Yuanping's direct gaze, and lowered his head hastily again.

Li Xiewen nodded silently and cupped his fist, saying, "The Chen Family relies on Chen Donghe, who has always been the foremost among the prestigious families and respected by all. Old Master Chen keeps a low profile and never flaunts his influence. However, the Chen Family has a young disciple named Chen Mufeng, who is seventeen years old and already at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. He is a disciple of Li Qiuyang, with excellent talent and great potential for promotion."

"I see," Li Yuanping responded with a broad smile and nodded.

The old man with a face full of wrinkles continued softly, "As for the other families, the Tian Family is scattered, the Liu Family is in decline, the Xu Family has few offspring, and the Ren Family's various branches are not in harmony. Only a few people, like Tian Zhongqing and Xu Gongming, are worth noticing; the rest are mediocre and of little use."

Li Yuanping, suddenly coming to an understanding of the matter, nodded again and asked a few more questions about the family's affairs. He then grasped Li Xiewen's hand and said earnestly, "I am young and inexperienced. I truly hope that Clan Uncle can guide me more in family matters."
𝒻𝘳ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝒷𝘯ℴ𝓋ℯ𝘭.𝑐ℴ𝑚

Li Xiewen naturally agreed repeatedly and soon took his leave. Li Yuanping sat back down, his pale fingers picking up the jade cup on the desk. He looked at Dou Yi below and smiled. "Uncle Xiewen managed the household under my father for many years. It is a pity his health is declining, or I would have entrusted him with significant responsibilities."

He then picked up the wooden slips to read carefully, having just sent off Li Xiewen, when a clan soldier interrupted him with a report.

"Young Master, Madam has arrived."

Madam Dou was now in her forties, but having cultivated for many years and taken good care of herself, she looked to be just in her thirties. Her jade-like nails were dyed with balsam, exuding an air of elegance and dignity. She walked gracefully into the hall as Li Yuanping quickly came down to greet her with a smile.

"Mother, how rare of you to visit."

Madam Dou nodded gently and sat down beside him. She glanced at Dou Yi, who was trying hard to minimize his presence, and then said to Li Yuanping, "Managing the household is not an easy task. Have you met with the branch family members?"

"Of course I have," Li Yuanping responded. "Li Qiuyang is out, so I sought out Li Xiewen. He just left before you arrived, Mother," he added.

Madam Dou picked up a teacup and, upon hearing Li Xiewen's name, sneered.

"When Li Xiewen served under your father, he was loyal and never interacted with the branch families. After Li Pingyi died, the old man knew he had no way out and immediately aligned himself with the branch families. Over the past few years, he has become a representative of their interests... It seems that Li Yesheng has taught him well. His ability to switch sides and play both ends against the middle is impressive!"

Madam Dou was known for her harsh methods and sharp tongue. With just a few words, she had thoroughly criticized the man. Li Yuanping, naturally aware of the intricacies involved, had specifically sought out Li Xiewen to understand the opinions of the family elders from the branch families.

He replied, "Li Xiewen has offended many people with all he has done. He does not want to rely on us remembering old ties, so he naturally needs to change his position and find a way to survive..."

Madam Dou, however, was much tougher and more stubborn. She simply commented, "I just cannot stand that old scoundrel!"

Both mother and son exchanged a glance. Li Yuanping took a sip of tea and replied, "The Liu Family used to be friendly with our branch families, but they were undermined by the Dou Family, and most of the clan's businesses and properties have been taken over by the Dou Family. According to the branch families, the rise of the Dou Family has threatened their interests, which has caused much dissatisfaction. Li Xiewen's words were barbed, and his insinuations were clear."

"The Ye and Li branch families now number in the thousands, with many cultivators among them. They are related by marriage, making it difficult to manage. Mother, you might need to rein in the Dou Family a little," he added.

Madam Dou rubbed the jade cup in her hand and glared fiercely at Dou Yi, scaring him into silence. She replied, "I have always kept them in check. Otherwise, the Dou Family's arrogance would have soared to the heavens by now. I just fear that with your father away, these family elders will bully us."

Li Yuanping chuckled softly and replied, "Eldest brother is still at Mount Wutu, and the old ancestor is at Mount Lijing. Where would they get the courage to act out? They are just using him to make some noise. The last words of the old ancestor's wife were for us to not shelter the Liu Family. They cannot figure out what the old ancestor is thinking and do not dare to speak out."

He paused, then continued, "From Li Xiewen's words, it seems the Chen Family is friendly with the branch families... Chen Mufeng, a disciple of Li Qiuyang, is exceptionally talented and has been engaged since childhood. He is a rare genius, reaching the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm at seventeen; perhaps we could recall him from Mount Huaqian for use."

Madam Dou nodded absentmindedly, then looked up with some confusion and said, "The Chen Family... Are they really from a farming background? It is already remarkable that Chen Donghe reached the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and now there is Chen Mufeng, who is not even directly related to Chen Donghe, yet managed to cultivate to the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm with such a poor cultivation technique!"

Li Yuanping shook his head and replied, "I have investigated. The Chen Family's founder, named Chen Erniu, was originally our tenant, having fled from the Lichuankou Village during a disaster. Their background is indeed that of a farming family, but judging by the family historical records, this person was quite shrewd..."

Madam Dou nodded, scrutinizing Li Yuanping's pale complexion, her brows furrowing with worry. She spoke gently, "Ping'er, there is one matter that needs to be addressed promptly."

Li Yuanping frowned and looked at his mother in confusion. Madam Dou then continued softly, "You should marry early and have children... This is not just my idea. I have written to Cloud Crowned Peak, and your father shares this sentiment."

The death of Li Yuanxiu had been a profound lesson for Li Xuanxuan and his wife. Considering Li Yuanping's frail health, Madam Dou and Li Xuanxuan began planning early. However, upon hearing this, Li Yuanping was taken aback, his expression turning somewhat sour as he responded, "Brother was engaged at eighteen, and I am only twelve. Why such urgency?!"

Madam Dou's thoughts were harsh and she could not voice them out loud, so she forced a smile. Seeing his mother's expression, Li Yuanping immediately understood and continued saying glumly, "Is it because you're worried that I might die young due to my lack of cultivation talent and weak root bone...?"

Madam Dou fell silent upon hearing this. She had a strong personality and could not bring herself to utter comforting words. The mother and son exchanged a glance once more. Li Yuanping suppressed his emotions and said, "There are many family affairs to handle, including dealing with deficits and external relations. Let us postpone this matter for now."

Madam Dou did not wish to press on too hard and agreed, sitting in the hall for a while longer before finally finding an excuse to leave. Li Yuanping escorted her out of the hall respectfully and then returned to his seat in silence.

The hall was cold and quiet, with guards standing silently on either side. Dou Yi kept his head down and did not speak. Li Yuanping raised his head and lifted the jade cup, looking into the clear tea water. He saw a pale, bloodless face with lips of a grayish-red hue. He squinted his eyes and remained silent for a long time.

Though Li Yuanping had been diligent since childhood and often had long talks with Li Yuanjiao, making him more mature than other boys his age, he was still only twelve or thirteen at the end of the day. Being born with a shortened lifespan and weakened root bone, how could he not feel that life was unfair? Usually, he pretended not to care, but Madam Dou's words earlier had stirred up his suppressed anger now that he was alone.

He put down the jade cup and looked at his wrists that were as slender as a woman's, feeling a surge of rage burning in his chest. He extended his delicate fingers and pinched his wrist hard.

His skin, as pale and lifeless as a corpse's, took a long time to turn red before quickly turning purple and black. It was not long until it finally tore, blood slowly seeping out and staining the desk red. Li Yuanping shook his hand gloomily, gradually calming down.

Li Yuanping had heard that when he was born, the ancestor, Li Tongya, had predicted his cognital deficiencies, slow cultivation progress, and that his lifespan would be barely half that of others.

Calculating the days, a quarter of his life has already passed. He dared not waste any more time and quickly wiped away the blood on the desk before picking up the vermilion brush, and silently wrote:

"Dear brother... I am of age to marry and bear children. Are there any suitable matches among the prominent families or towns with a spiritual orifice? If there are, please inform me..."

Folding the letter, Li Yuanping called out, "Someone, come!"

A person came forward hurriedly and looked up at Li Yuanping expectantly—it was a member of the Liu Family. He had been squeezed out of his position by the Dou Family but was personally reinstated by Li Yuanping, so his eyes were full of gratitude.

"Deliver this to my elder brother at Mount Wutu," Li Yuanping ordered.




# Chapter 307: Maha Jinlian

The Lotus Temple, located in the Zhao State, was the legacy of a Dharma Master. The Zhao State revered Buddhism, with numerous temples, and among the 461 temples, the Lotus Temple ranked in the top ten. It had annexed a vast amount of land and supported over ten thousand monks.

Minghui rode the wind, flying over the expansive farmlands at the foot of the mountain. The emaciated tenants below dropped their farming tools hastily and bowed fervently.

"Blessings be upon you, Master Monk... Blessings be upon you!"

Minghui acted as if he had not heard them and descended toward the grand golden hall on the mountain. The magnificent hall was filled with countless golden candles and incense, with smoke billowing like a white waterfall flowing softly from the gaps in the steps and windows. This very hall consumed an astonishing amount of oil and wood every year, a feat that only such a large temple could possibly afford.

At the end of the hall were several naked women. Some were seated, some were kneeling, and some were even lying down. Luxurious garments were scattered all around on the floor. Among them was a small child who looked to be about five or six years old.

The child appeared charming and delicate and was suckling milk from a woman's breast. Around them, teenage girls bustled about, carrying oil jugs and refilling the lamps hurriedly.

The air was thick with the scent of oil and incense. Minghui quickly bowed and greeted respectfully, "Minghui greets Master! May Master be blessed with a hundred lifetimes of joy and compassion, achieve an indestructible body, and become a true immortal!"

The child, who was suckling milk, cast a sidelong glance at him and spoke in a gentle and pleasant voice that echoed through the hall. The teenage girls on either side kneeled down as he said, "Minghui, didn't I send you to escort Lord Murong? Why have you returned so soon?"

"Innocent, I am innocent!" Minghui exclaimed as immediately he kneeled and bowed deeply, knocking his forehead to the ground repeatedly as he explained the whole story.

The child opened his eyes as he released the nipple he had been suckling from, his mouth still full of milk residue as he cursed fiercely, "Useless fool... Whenever trouble arises, you run back here. Present the golden palace at once!"

Minghui quickly summoned the golden palace. Floating out from his sleeve, it was initially palm-sized but soon expanded to the stature of an average person. It looked like a small table, though it was shaky and full of cracks.

The child examined it for a while, his expression somewhat peculiar. After a while, he spoke once more in his childish voice, saying, "How strange, its inherent rank is very high, yet lacks any ferocious aura... It must belong to some unfamiliar immortal Daoist."

This child was naturally Minghui's master, Maha Jinlian, the ancestor of the Lotus Sect. He had been cultivating as a Maha for three hundred years and has already reincarnated seven times, with profound mastery of Buddhist doctrines. He was only a step away from becoming a Dharma Master. In the Zhao State, he was one of the strongest figures.

Buddhism cultivation differed greatly from immortal cultivation. The immortal cultivation began with the Profound Scenery Chakra, and upon condensing it, one could perform immortal arts.

In contrast, Buddhist monks spanned the realms of Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation as mere mortals with iron-like bodies. Upon breaking through to become a Master Monk, they slightly surpassed Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of the immortal Dao. However, when they became a Merciful One, they were slightly weaker than a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. A Maha was weaker than a Golden Core Realm cultivator, but slightly stronger than the Purple Mansion Realm, creating a sense of asymmetrical power.

Seeing the colorful light in the hall, Maha Jinlian felt a profound and subtle spiritual energy and was overjoyed.

Despite being a mere Master Monk, Minghui actually glimpsed at a Golden Core Realm cultivator and survived... Could it be that this Golden Core Realm immortal cultivator is on the verge of death? I, having cultivated through seven lifetimes as a Maha, am only a step away from becoming a Dharma Master. It seems my destiny has arrived! Hahahaha!

Maha Jinlian, having cultivated seven lifetimes as a Maha, was already comparable to a cultivator at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm. His desires surged and he made up his mind, speaking bluntly, "Even if it is a Golden Core Realm cultivator, so what? Though I may not be able to defeat them, dissolving one of their threads of fate should be no problem. Present that artifact!"

He calculated his moves carefully. The Golden Core Realm cultivator's condition was abnormal, and merely peeking at it shouldn't cause any issues. With the backing of a Dharma Master, he felt confident.

Minghui was overjoyed upon hearing this and presented the golden palace as Maha Jinlian performed hand seals and closed his eyes slowly. The child's face was full of contempt as the colorful light within the golden palace gradually dimmed and transferred into his hands.

After several dozen breaths, the contempt on the Maha's face slowly faded, and he began to perform more hand seals seriously. Minghui waited for a long time, but there was no sound from above.

He peeked carefully and saw Maha Jinlian covered in sweat, muttering incessantly. Minghui was terrified and he immediately kneeled, praying in his heart.

This is not my fault... This is not my fault... You great cultivators can fight amongst yourselves, but please spare my life... Please spare my life!

Minghui remained silent with his head lowered, while Maha Jinlian began to tremble. The colorful light within the golden palace had completely disappeared, the hand seals in his hands glowing with a crystalline light.

Before his eyes were endless darkness, his mana flowing uncontrollably into his hands and his aura weakening in waves, until finally... there was a flash of light.

————

"This is..."

Beneath the drifting dark clouds, the land lay in darkness. Lu Jiangxian sat feeling somewhat troubled beside a stone table, holding a shimmering golden light in his hand.

"I have seen those unafraid of death, but never anyone so eager to rush toward it..." Lu Jiangxian muttered to himself, as he had been aware of Minghui spying on him earlier.

Although he failed to probe into this mirror, Minghui had used his fate thread to draw himself into this predicament. If it had been when Lu Jiangxian had just awakened, he might not have been able to deal with him. Now, however, after decades of cultivating shamanic and immortal arts, Lu Jiangxian had utilized the mirror's inherent rank to keep Minghui firmly in grasp.

"I was afraid of inviting trouble and spared your life, yet you continue to provoke me..."

Lu Jiangxian's current Supreme Yin Profound Light had only the power of the peak Foundation Establishment Realm, but its inherent rank was likely frighteningly high. As long as he did not reveal the mirror, no one could calculate it. As for those who relied on talisman qi for their calculations, he could easily reverse the backlash upon them.

But... Maha Jinlian probably has someone even more powerful backing him. If I kill this fellow and attract the attention of a Dharma Master or a Revered One, it will be troublesome indeed!

He frowned, and an idea struck him. With a tap on the desk, he conjured an endless hall made of white jade, intricately engraved with complex incantations. It was the same hall from Li Jiangqun's memories, the Moonlight Origin Mansion. Lu Jiangxian sat high above, looking down.

"With my current power, I can pull this guy's spirit into the mirror for the duration of one incense stick. I might as well use this opportunity to gather some information and then cut off this strand of spirit, making him forget everything.

After some consideration, Lu Jiangxian made up his mind, grasped the golden light, and threw it before him. Instantly, moonlight was condensed, which transformed into a five or six-year-old child. He looked well-behaved and cute and was draped in a robe, kneeling on the white jade floor of the hall.

"Who are you..?" Maha Jinlian asked as he opened his eyes groggily, glancing around. He immediately sensed that something was terribly wrong. He quickly tried to activate his power but found his body empty, devoid of mana, and was instantly terrified.

Looking up again, he saw a man sitting high above him, his face radiating with a blinding light that hurt his eyes, his attire exuding an immortal aura. Maha Jinlian shrank back, lowering his head in fear.

This...! To capture me with just a fate thread, this is no mere Golden Core Realm immortal cultivator! This is a true immortal... Damn it, how could there still be an immortal lingering in the world? Damn Minghui... for making me provoke such an old monster!

Despite his thoughts, Maha Jinlian dared not be neglectful. He pleaded mournfully, "This humble monk is a Maha who cultivates the Great Compassion and Joyous Lotus Manifestation. I did not know an immortal was present... Please, Immortal, show mercy and spare my life..."




# Chapter 308: Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual

Hearing him mention something the way of Great Compassion and Joyous Lotus, Lu Jiangxian immediately understood that this person was a Buddhist cultivator, potentially a Dharma Master who was as powerful as a Golden Core Realm immortal cultivator. He was secretly shocked but knew nothing much of the relationships between these Revered Ones and Dao Embryos.

Wanting to coax this Maha into revealing more information, he merely sneered and snorted coldly, "Heh!"

Maha Jinlian was greatly alarmed, thinking to himself, Indeed... this is an immortal. Even a Revered One comparable to a Dao Embryo is just a junior in front of him... This spells trouble...

He knocked his head to the ground repeatedly, begging loudly for mercy. Lu Jiangxian glanced at him and sneered. "I have been out of the world for a long time... Now, even such riffraff dares to spy on me!"

Lu Jiangxian originally intended to boast about being away for millennia, but realizing that too many words could cause mistakes, he decided to speak vaguely. Maha Jinlian observed the ancient patterns on the ground, feeling a sense of age, and thought to himself, I have never seen this... it must be at least a thousand years old! No wonder... No wonder!

In his heart, he cursed, How long did this old monster seclude himself to miss such cataclysmic events? No wonder he is still in the world... It's my misfortune to encounter such an old monster...

Maha Jinlian fawningly smiled, slapped his own face twice, and bowed, saying, "Please forgive me, Exalted Immortal... Since the upheaval sixteen hundred years ago, even Revered Ones and Dao Embryos have disappeared. This humble monk meant no offense... Please have mercy, Exalted Immortal!"

Lu Jiangxian reclined at the top as he listened, slowly furrowing his brows. He had heard that a war between the immortals and devils had taken place fifteen or sixteen hundred years ago. His heart was stirred, and he thought, There is indeed a problem. Given the nature of these Purple Mansion Golden Core Daoists and Mahas Dharma Masters, there must be an issue behind this Immortal-Devil War...

He shook his head slightly, feigning confusion as he said, "Upheaval? I have been out of the world for a long time and sensed vaguely that something was amiss..."

Maha Jinlian nodded repeatedly, answering, "The Heavenly Dao encountered problems, and the Three Disasters and Nine Tribulations dissipated... You should have felt it too, Exalted Immortal. Since then, there have been no restrictions, no disasters or difficulties. We, who were imprisoned by Heaven and Earth for millions of years, finally gained great freedom and great enlightenment..."

Great freedom... Great enlightenment...

These words thundered in Lu Jiangxian's mind, stirring waves of thoughts within him. He kept his face calm and nodded subtly, his face blurring.

The time of one incense stick is almost up... Lu Jiangxian thought as he felt slightly anxious, knowing that he did not have enough time to delve into these matters further.

He seized this opportunity to search for a way to break through and asked in a low voice, "Which Metallic Essences remain unpracticed in Jiangnan?"

Maha Jinlian was stunned, unable to grasp why an immortal would ask such a question. Still, he thought for a moment and replied, "The Xu State has no significant Dao lineages... The three sects and seven gates of Yue State and the four sects and nine families of Wu State have lost the Supreme Yang and Supreme Yin. Only some thunder techniques and one or two types of water and metal essences are missing..."

Lu Jiangxian could no longer wait for him to prattle on, he needed to prompt him to think about these things. The fragment of Maha Jinlian's spirit was at his mercy in the mirror. Lu Jiangxian gathered moonlight in his hand, stirring Maha Jinlian's thoughts while he was deep in contemplation, trying to retain as much information as possible.

Lu Jiangxian was not adept at soul-capturing techniques, and his efforts caused Maha Jinlian to tremble as his eyes bulged and he cried out, "Exalted Immortal, spare me! Spare me!"

Lu Jiangxian's spell could not be sustained for long, and Maha Jinlian could not endure such torment any longer. The fragment of his spirit burst with a bang, leaving nothing behind.

Lu Jiangxian waved his hand to dismiss the illusion, then looked at the cluster of golden light in his hand. With a stir of his divine sense, he gained an understanding of most of the Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities in Jiangnan.

So that's how it is... The Azure Pond Sect and the Golden Feather Sect are backed by early-stage Golden Core Realm cultivators who cultivated the Clear Water Origin Talisman Core and the Golden Supreme Origin Green Core... The Yue Cultivating Sect has a mid-stage Golden Core Realm cultivator...

Lu Jiangxian then understood why these three sects were known as the three sects. It was because all three were following the Golden Core Dao lineage.

Even if these Golden Core Realm cultivators and Dharma Masters did not care about secular Dao lineages, it did not change the fact that the Azure Pond Sect and the Lotus Temple were formidable.

"Difficult... Too difficult..."

Lu Jiangxian could not help but click his tongue in admiration. Growing up within such a colossal entity as the Azure Pond Sect, lying low for a century to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, and finally becoming independent while making peace with the Azure Pond Sect—Xiao Chuting's means were extraordinary. Although Xiao Chuting remained silent and lacked a resounding reputation, his character and talent were top-notch.

While marveling at Xiao Chuting's impressive methods, Lu Jiangxian was deeply worried about the dire situation in Jiangnan. He mumbled, "I thought I could let the Li Family develop on their own, but as soon as a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator emerges in Jiangnan, it immediately blocks the five pathways related to immortal foundations. Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have a lifespan of five hundred years... If I cannot find a path for the Li Family in time, who knows how much time will need to be wasted."

Lu Jiangxian sorted through the memories of Maha Jinlian, finding mostly Buddhist cultivation methods, which were all rather sinister. Naturally, Lu Jiangxian did not want to use them. After flipping through them, he finally found a suitable cultivation method.

"Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual, a Grade Four cultivation technique... The immortal foundation it forms is called the Radiant Origin Pass. Although the required Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth is somewhat difficult to gather, it comes with a corresponding method for gathering qi. This immortal foundation was once cultivated by the northern immortal sects, and there is no inheritance of it in Jiangnan. This is perfect! The only problem is..."

Lu Jiangxian sighed softly, feeling somewhat helpless.

This technique only reaches the Foundation Establishment Realm and stops at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm, with no further path to the Purple Mansion Realm.

With a light flick of his sleeve, he conjured a golden book in his hand. Lu Jiangxian took up his brush and transcribed the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual, flipping through a few pages.

He then placed it alongside the shamanic spell book and murmured, "I will bestow this upon the generation of Xi and Yue. No matter what, this is still a better choice than those Grade Three techniques or any technique that has already produced a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Li Tongya has already been targeted by one... continuing to cultivate the River One Qi Technique is a bad move."

Lu Jiangxian understood well that if a Li Family cultivator achieved an immortal foundation and died, regardless of the distance, all their cultivation would be absorbed by him. This was verified by Li Chejing, which directly led to Chi Wei's failure to break through.

"In other words, no matter who is targeting Li Tongya, they will eventually fail. They will not be able to refine divine abilities for that Purple Mansion Realm and will have to find another Boundless Ocean to devour. If the disciples from the Li Family continue to cultivate this technique, they will just die prematurely... one after another. After three or five cases, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator will definitely grow suspicious, and that would be troublesome..."

Having made so much progress in planning the future of the Li Family after a long period of idleness, Lu Jiangxian felt exhausted. He was inherently a lazy and unmotivated person. Placing the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual before him to avoid forgetting it, he then drifted back into his dreams.

————

Minghui had been waiting on the ground for the duration of one incense stick. Seeing Maha Jinlian's small face covered in cold sweat and occasionally trembling, it was clear he was under a spell.

Minghui's face turned mournful, and he lamented in his heart, It's over... It's over... That immortal cultivator must be more than just a Golden Core Realm cultivator! Now even Master might lose his life...

Raised by Maha Jinlian from a young age, despite his Master's volatile temper and frequent beatings, he had taught him many things and personally awakened his wisdom. Minghui held this kindness deeply in his heart. At this moment, he was filled with both sorrow and self-blame, crying out in anguish.

Unexpectedly, Maha Jinlian, with a vacant expression, opened his eyes, looking as if he had just awoken from a long dream. He frowned upon seeing him and said, "Minghui, didn't I send you to escort Lord Murong? Why have you returned so soon?"




# Chapter 309: Bold And Ambitious

Minghui looked at the dazed and out-of-this-world expression on Maha Jinlian's face and immediately made an assumption in his heart.

It seems that the immortal has spared him... Otherwise, how could Master escape so easily? This immortal most likely does not want anyone to know he is at Moongaze Lake and has thus erased his memory. If I am not sensible and speak out, I might put our lives in danger again!

Seeing Maha Jinlian's confused expression before him, Minghui pointed to his shabby Golden Palace and said respectfully, "Master, I damaged my dharma artifact outside, so I came back to see if it can be repaired."

The Golden Palace at the foot of the stairs was already on the verge of collapse after the repeated torments it had been put through. Maha Jinlian glanced at it and scolded, "I am not a blacksmith. What is the use of showing it to me? Get back to the south and keep watch!"

Minghui nodded repeatedly, put away the dharma artifact, and retreated as if escaping. Maha Jinlian then continued to suckle for milk, squinting his eyes. After a few breaths, he felt that something was wrong.

"What is this kid hiding from me...?" he wondered.

Maha Jinlian could not remember the previous events at all, as if he had taken a nap. But he was already a Maha; how could he still take naps? He froze briefly, feeling increasingly frightened the more he thought about it.

————

Meanwhile in Yi Mountain City...

Li Xuanfeng leaned against the city wall, wiping the golden bow in his hands silently. His gray clothes were stained with various demon beasts' blood, tattered and foul-smelling. He did not seem to notice this, however, and simply stared blankly northward.

"Brother Xuanfeng..."

Everyone nearby glanced at him as a handsome middle-aged man stepped forward. His elegant white clothes were spotted with bloodstains, making him look rather disheveled. He cupped his fist to Li Xuanfeng and said respectfully, "Thank you for your assistance!"

Li Xuanfeng had now reached the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and his strength was promising among the clan cultivators. The group both respected and feared this quiet man. When Fei Yihe spoke, everyone else echoed in agreement.

"Indeed... such a divine bow and remarkable strength! He entered and exited the beast horde nine times; only Brother Xuanfeng could do that!"

Li Xuanfeng nodded silently. These five years had made him appear even more haggard. His beard was unkempt, and his eyes were sunken, giving him the true appearance of a dispirited man. He ignored the flattery and focused on gazing northward until the crowd eventually dispersed, including Fei Yihe. Only then did he move his lips and look at the wound on his hand.

"One hundred and twenty scars in five years, none fatal."

Since the fall of Lixia Prefecture, where Jiang Yunu and her son had perished, Li Xuanfeng had woken up countless nights, asking himself, "Why did I not meet them even once during those five years?"

Those five years, he had been in seclusion writing bow techniques, not in any long-term seclusion. Qi Cultivators could go without food but needed water. In his cultivation, inspiration had surged, and he had completely forgotten about everything else.

Regret and self-blame haunted him for ten years, constantly waking him up countless nights, filling his heart with unease and pain. He sighed deeply, hating himself for neglecting what should have been his priorities.

It was not until Xiao Chuting used the Man On Creek divine ability to fish out Yu Yufeng and killed him on the Mushroom Forest Plains that Li Xuanfeng was alarmed and became suspicious. But he kept it to himself and never breathed a word of it to anyone.

If a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator covets something and uses divine ability to mislead me...

He picked up a cloth and continued wiping his golden bow, his expression growing darker. He stared silently at the rising moon, thinking to himself, Then the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's gaze must be on me. The family's mirror is too important. Coming to Yi Mountain City will reduce the risk of exposure.

He had eagerly accepted the summons to Yi Mountain City, partly longing for a life on the edge and partly hoping the Purple Mansion Realm would shift their focus from Mount Lijing. Over five years and countless battles, many were injured, harming their foundations. Yet, Li Xuanfeng had never been seriously wounded, making him feel increasingly gloomy.

"Brother Xuanfeng!"

Li Xuanfeng heard a clear voice call out. Turning to look, he saw Fei Yihe returning. He had changed into a moon-white long robe and was carrying a pot of spirit wine. He approached with a cheerful smile and said, "Brother Xuanfeng, are you admiring the moon alone? I hope you won't mind me joining in."

Fei Yihe was the son of Fei Wangbai and the next head of the Fei Family. He had been summoned to the southern border by Chi Zhiyan as well. Over the past five years in Yi Mountain City, Li Xuanfeng and Fei Yihe had developed a deep friendship.

Fei Yihe pulled out a small table from his storage pouch, placed it on the city wall, and sat cross-legged before it. As soon as the table was set, a white light rose, faintly sealing off the surrounding wind and isolating the inside from the outside.

Fei Yihe sighed softly. With the formation isolating them, a look of sorrow appeared on his face. He poured himself a drink and took a slow sip, saying, "Five years have passed in the blink of an eye. Tongyu and Tongxiao should be getting married now... I wonder how things are at the lake."

In Yi Mountain City, they could not communicate with the outside world. They could only learn some news from people who came in from the back, so they had pretty much lost touch with their families.

"Good wine!" Li Xuanfeng commented as he took a cup and downed several drinks in one go before exhaling deeply and saying softly, "Yu Yufeng is dead. With the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators from our two families, Yu Mugao cannot stir up much trouble."

Fei Yihe nodded silently. The two drank in silence, pushing cups back and forth until the moon set and the sky began to brighten. Fei Yihe glumly said, "I thought I was born to lead and expand my family... From a young age, I studied history, cultivated, observed human nature, learned right from wrong, and established checks and balances among the branches... Yet a single transfer order rendered the rest of my life meaningless."

Li Xuanfeng took a drink and stepped forward, looking down from the city wall. The ground was littered with the corpses of demon beasts. Occasionally, one could see the remains of cultivators, but most were the bodies of mortal soldiers used as cannon fodder. Like ants, the mortals dragged the bodies silently while the ground was stained with blood, flies buzzing all around the havoc.

The scene before him was all too familiar to him, causing Li Xuanfeng to ponder deeply.

"Was it forty years ago or thirty years ago?"

Back then, Li Xiangping was being hunted by rogue cultivators and fled north. Li Xuanxuan had just taken charge of the family, and Li Xuanfeng was a young boy who had just received the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed. He stumbled into the Wan Family, which had been slaughtered by Ji Dengqi, with corpses lying everywhere in a sea of blood.
𝙛𝒓𝒆𝙚𝒘𝒆𝓫𝙣𝓸𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝒄𝒐𝓶

Terrified, he was fortunate to find Li Tongya upon his return. Seething with anger, he silently vowed, "That Golden Tang Gate and their young master are truly trash... When I grow up, I will destroy the Golden Tang Gate and shoot down that young master's head to kick it like a ball!"

His childish voice echoed in his mind, filling Li Xuanfeng with shame. Gripping the golden bow tightly until his fingers turned white, he whispered into the night, "In my youth, I was bold and ambitious, never letting go of the bowstring or bending my knees. I spoke lightly of shattering immortal mountains and shooting down Golden Tang Gate's master. Now, forty years have slipped by like a swift river, and those grand dreams have dissolved into the mist. My wife and child are gone, and I am but a pawn, living a mediocre life within the confines of this city, serving the Azure Pond Sect as nothing more than a dog. I leave my house at midnight, weeping softly into the darkness, too frightened to let my voice be heard, lest I draw suspicion..."

As Li Xuanfeng spoke, his sharp eyebrows furrowed, the natural arch flattening in a display of profound sorrow. Tears welled up in his eyes, trailing down his cheeks. The innate arrogance and wild spirit that had been part of Li Xuanfeng since childhood had eroded over forty years, turning into a long sigh that escaped through his nose and mouth, dissipating into the silent night air like a vanishing mist.

Li Xuanfeng coughed harshly, flecks of blood staining his lips. Fei Yihe rushed to his side, offering support with a steadying hand. He couldn't help but notice how much Li Xuanfeng had come to resemble his elder brother Li Xuanxuan with the weary look on his face.




# Chapter 310: Duanchen Village

The Xiao Family had risen to prominence in recent years, and Cloud Crowned Peak was no longer a place for paying tribute. As a result, the foot traffic had decreased significantly. Fortunately, with the destruction of the Yu Family's market and the northern Xu State still in a state of disrepair, the majority of visitors from Moongaze Lake and half of Xu State flocked to the Cloud Crowned Peak market, preventing it from becoming too desolate.

Deep within the market, Li Qiuyang squatted in front of a store, holding a few pelts and arguing with a rogue cultivator. The man's face turned red as he exclaimed, "This is the hide of a first heavenly layer Qi Cultivation Realm beast, completely intact! How can it not be worth seven Spirit Stones?"

Li Qiuyang had become a unrefined Qi cultivator, so his Dao cultivation had essentially reached the ceiling. Obtaining nearly a century of extended life was already fortunate. Cultivators of various unrefined qi had poor combat abilities, merely possessing the name of Qi Cultivator and the ability to ride the wind. The Li Family's market stores needed staff, and Li Xuanxuan thought it better for family members to earn Spirit Stones rather than outsiders, so he had called Li Qiuyang to the market to find work.

Seeing the rogue cultivator causing a scene, Li Qiuyang simply smiled wryly and replied, "Fellow Daoist, although this hide is from a Qi Cultivation Realm beast, it lacks luster and is quite shabby. It is clearly from a young demon beast who had just attained the Qi Cultivation Realm. While the pelt is complete, it is just a small animal, no bigger than a child..."

"Stop spouting nonsense and slandering me, Third Li!"

The man saw Li Qiuyang demeaning the hide and immediately started scolding him, his face contorted in anger. Li Qiuyang was nicknamed Third Li because he worked under Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanling in the store.

Li Qiuyang remained unbothered and cupped his fist. "Fellow Daoist, no other shop will give you seven Spirit Stones for this!"

The man glared at him, then threw the gray pelt onto the table and huffed, "Fine, six Spirit Stones it is."

Li Qiuyang nodded, took six Spirit Stones and handed them over. The man snorted as he snatched the stones and left in a huff. As he exited the courtyard, an ordinary-looking young boy with slightly arched eyebrows peeked out from a corner.

"That guy has quite a temper!" he commented.

Li Qiuyang shook his head, accustomed to the attitudes of rogue cultivators. Though he was an unrefined Qi cultivator, the mortals called him an Immortal Master. However, in the market, he ranked lower than an outstanding Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators.

He shook his head and replied, "Mufeng, the family intends to bring you back to the lake. Perform well, get close to the clan members, and strive to obtain that Grade Three legacy!"

Chen Mufeng nodded vigorously, his voice tinged with yearning as he said, "The clan's Grade Three technique is usually reserved for the main family. External cultivators from lesser branches only receive them for great merits. I have heard that Uncle Donghe was rewarded only after risking his life following Lord Xiangping to the west. Getting this technique will not be easy for me..."

Li Qiuyang remained silent, thinking to himself, I wonder how Xuanfeng is doing in Yi Mountain City... I've heard the southern border is full of demons and monsters. Fortunately, the sword immortal is also in the south; this should provide him with some protection.

"Shopkeeper!"

Li Qiuyang was deep in thought when Chen Mufeng called out to him, snapping him back to reality. He saw someone descending the stairs, all dressed in gray. The man had meticulously combed gray hair and beard, with his hands clasped behind his back.

"Clan Head!" Li Qiuyang greeted, and Li Xuanxuan nodded. He was nearly fifty years old now and preferred not to move around much, choosing to oversee the store instead.

The market was fiercely competitive. Although the Li Family had Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to back them and marital ties with the Xiao Family, most of the market belonged to the Xiao Family, who were considered insiders. Li Xuanxuan had to balance maintaining relationships and earning sufficient profits, which was mentally taxing.

He stroked his gray beard, calculated the days, and said anxiously, "Xuanling has been gone for months, has he not? Why has he not returned yet...?"

Li Xuanxuan's talent was limited, and was still stuck at the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. However, Li Xuanling—Li Tongya's son—was doing much better, and was already at the third heavenly layer. He also cultivated in the market, frequently traveling north to Xu State and the Great Jiang to gain knowledge. It was common for him to be away for more than half a month, but it had now been over two months, making Li Xuanxuan very anxious.

"Seventy-one days—That's more than two months..." Li Qiuyang mumbled.

Li Xuanxuan gritted his teeth and commanded, "Fetch the ink and brush. I will write a letter home and send Donghe to check on him!"

Whilst that was his intention, the Xu State and the Great Jiang were vast, and Li Xuanling's whereabouts were unknown. Searching for him would be very difficult and a waste of manpower. Li Xuanxuan wrote a few words on the small letter and then sighed dejectedly, putting down the brush.

"Fortunately, the jade talisman is intact..."

Li Xuanxuan took a small jade pendant from his chest, and upon seeing its crystal-clear and warm appearance, he let out a slight sigh of relief.

The Li Family was now considered a prestigious clan, though not on par with the three sects and seven gates. They had some means, with layers of protections on their storage pouches and mana imprints. As long as the jade talisman was not crushed, the others could communicate and share their location to each other.

"I better consult the ancestor..."

Li Xuanxuan pondered for a moment before picking up the brush and ink, writing on the small letter again.

————

Zhao State, Duanchen Village.

Duanchen Village was located at the southernmost part of Zhao State, on the border of Xu State and Zhao State. It was said to be the resting place for northern prestigious clans who crossed the river during their southern migration. However, for hundreds of years, it had been occupied by Buddhist cultivators.

Duanchen Village had a small temple called Duanchen Temple. According to northern customs, all the land in Duanchen Village belonged to the temple. Beneath the monks were tenant farmers, though they were euphemistically called "monastic households." There were also a few foreign nobles who lived and practiced Buddhist cultivation in the temple.

Li Xuanling had stayed in this godforsaken place for a whole month and had deeply experienced the troublesome nature of Buddhism. When he first arrived, dressed in his Daoist robes, the emaciated tenant farmers looked at him as if he were a calamity. Some children even showed obvious and unbridled hatred, secretly spitting at him. If he had not been a Qi Cultivator, they might have tied him up and sent him up the mountain!

"The Central Plain, after hundreds of years under Buddhism cultivation, has completely lost their roots..." Li Xuanling muttered as he gazed at the densely packed temples on the mountain, feeling a surge of emotion stirring within him.

According to the immortal cultivators, after the Immortal-Devil War, the immortal Dao weakened and lost the north. The remaining clans and sects had migrated south. Now, upon returning to the north, there was no trace of immortal cultivation any longer. Although he had little regard for Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, he could not help but sigh at the sight.

Looking at the busy, emaciated tenant farmers below, Li Xuanling felt deeply moved. In the north, there were no songs, dances, operas, theater houses, or merchants. There was only an endless expanse of yellow land and tenant farmers with shaved heads and small braids—a depressing scene of lifelessness.

"In this appearance, I am not suited to travel in the north."

He performed a quick spell, changing his appearance. Wearing brown robes and now sporting a shiny bald head, he used an illusion technique to transform his sword into a long staff before descending to ask for directions.

As soon as he landed in the field, a tenant farmer shouted, and all the tenant farmers prostrated themselves uniformly, their small braids pointing upward like black-stemmed pumpkins spread out on the ground.

"Greetings, Master Monk!"

The one at the front seemed to be their leader, his face withered but his expression fanatical. His voice was high-pitched and crazed. Li Xuanling looked up and saw a few frail women and children in the distance fainting from excitement, collapsing onto the ground with no one turning to check on them.

"You all..." Li Xuanling began as he opened his mouth, an inexplicable sadness rising in his heart, rendering him momentarily speechless.




# Chapter 311: Fahui

Li Xuanling had traversed the Xu State for the past five years. After the battles between the Purple Mansion Realms and the Merciful Ones, the various powers were greatly weakened and focused on recuperation.

With the intervention of the Yue Cultivating Sect in Xu State after the war, rules were established to restrict rogue cultivators, resulting in a period of peace. The common people's lives were relatively decent, though not as prosperous as those under the Li Family's governance, but they were still livable.

Li Xuanling had made connections and recorded various methods of qi gathering in the Xu State. This year, he crossed over to Zhao State to assess the situation there. He saw the desolate land of Duanchen Village and expected the people to be full of complaints, but instead, the tenant farmers were ecstatic. This surprised him, and he asked softly, "How do I get to Mount Luoxia?"

Although the north had fallen under Buddhist control, there were still some Dao lineages and immortal cultivators who lived in seclusion in the mountains, avoiding worldly affairs. They usually had some background, so no one disturbed them.

Mount Luoxia was one such place, where many northern immortal cultivators were still active. Li Xuanling intended to see how the northern Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao differed from the southern ones.

"Mount Luoxia?" The people below exchanged glances with each other upon hearing this, looking puzzled. Li Xuanling shook his head and was about to ride away on the wind when he suddenly looked up, sensing something.

Standing on the ridge of a rice field was a shirtless man with well-defined muscles, his hands clasped together. He stared intently at Li Xuanling and said in a deep voice, "I do not know which path you follow, but you look unfamiliar. Greetings, I am Fahui of Duanchen Temple!"

"Ran into the real deal..." Li Xuanling muttered to himself, feeling awkward now. He wanted to speak but feared revealing his identity. He nodded and was about to ride away on the wind when the monk shouted loudly, "Ha! I knew there was something wrong with you, heretic."

Fahui leaped from the ridge like a soaring eagle, aiming a punch at Li Xuanling. Li Xuanling quickly rode the wind, alarmed, thinking to himself, Is this man crazy?! Why is he attacking me out of nowhere?

Without considering the consequences, he quickly performed a spell to create a mana shield around him while simultaneously grabbing the sword at his waist. His true essence flowed like water as he spoke, "We have no enmity. Why are you attacking, monk?"

The monk's eyes were wide with rage, and his fists, which were like iron, pounded on the shield loudly. Li Xuanling drew his sword, preparing to strike. Fahui kicked the shield, using the force to leap and dodge the sword, then descended like an eagle.

Li Xuanling felt a sharp pain from the cutting wind and raised his sword to block the attack. The sword emitted grayish light, but Fahui, with his steel-like body, grabbed the blade with his bare hands, trying to seize Li Xuanling's wrist.

"Hey!"

Seeing the monk's physical strength, Li Xuanling dared not let him grab hold. He did not want to abandon his sword either, so he thought quickly and cast a spell, aiming it at Fahui's hand while fully activating the sword, emitting waves of gray-black light to force him back.

Fahui was momentarily halted by the spell. He crushed it with his palm, but his other hand was hurt, and the golden light on it showed cracks. Fahui thought, For some reason, I find this person loathsome. My anger is uncontrollable! But this sword is sharp, and holding it will break my Dharma body. I must let go!

He threw a final strong punch at the shield, causing it to shatter with a loud boom, then released the sword and leaped away.

Li Xuanling had gained much experience from killing demons and people in Xu State. This was his first encounter with a Buddhist cultivator and had taken a beating. With a moment to catch his breath, he quickly realized, This person probably can't fly and is only staying aloft by leveraging my power. I don't need to fight him!

He did not pursue but immediately pulled back, leaving Fahui shouting angrily at him. Fahui struggled to stay in the air but eventually fell back to the ground like a heavy bear with a loud crash.

"Hmph! Heretics who lead people astray must be killed!"

Fahui was just a monk who could not ride the wind. Li Xuanling ascended even higher, leaving Fahui glaring angrily from below.

Li Xuanling, both startled and furious after the unexpected attack, cursed, "I only asked for directions. How am I leading them astray?"

Before achieving the status of a true monk, Buddhist cultivators were still ordinary mortals. Despite this, Fahui was highly skilled, breaking Li Xuanling's mana shield with only two punches. Li Xuanling, from his elevated position, could have attacked with his sword but hesitated due to Duanchen Temple's local influence.

The monk below continued cursing, shouting, "You're using illusion technique! How is that not leading people astray? Have you ever led anyone to a land of bliss with your heretical ways? All you seek is to..."

Fahui was still shouting, but Li Xuanling ignored him. He saw figures emerging from the distant mountain temples and knew he could not linger any longer. He sneered and said, "Nonsense! What land of bliss? It is just a pretense to eat people... a self-deceiving concept!"

Fahui's eyes widened in fury as Li Xuanling floated away in the wind. The monk roared in place until other monks arrived where the scene slowly quieted down, but they all glared in the direction Li Xuanling had left.

A monk beside Fahui spoke kindly, trying to calm him down. After a while, an old monk appeared, wearing a gray robe and holding a string of crystal-clear beads. He smiled and said, "Fahui, your destiny has arrived!"

"Abbot," Fahui responded, looking surprised. He asked, "Why do you say that?"

The old monk nodded, looking delighted, and quickly said, "You have been intelligent since young, progressing rapidly in your cultivation. You have the deepest roots of wisdom in our temple and are only a step away from becoming a master monk... I went to the great temple to inquire about you, and now it seems that the opportunity has come!"
𝑓𝘳𝘦𝑒𝑤𝑒𝘣𝘯ℴ𝘷𝘦𝓁.𝑐𝑜𝑚

"What do you mean?" Fahui asked in a low voice, and upon realizing this concerned his path of cultivation, he immediately shifted his attention, feeling overjoyed.

The old monk stroked his white beard and replied, "I crossed three mountains to seek enlightenment. The Merciful One sat at the head, and I detailed the situation. He said, This person was a fisherman in his past life, fond of snake soup. He fished year after year until he encountered a storm and was swallowed by a great whale. In this life, he's fortunate to become human. A Daoist riding the wind will appear, with mana and true essence like rivers. He is the reincarnation of a serpent dragon. If he can convert this person and thus eliminate evil, he will cultivate a land of bliss within his stomach and become a master monk."

Fahui clapped his hands repeatedly, his eyes shining with divine light. He laughed and said, "I see... this must be it! No wonder I felt uncontrollable anger at the sight of this person... It was destiny and fate!"

The old monk laughed heartily and continued, "I then asked, is there a chance for him to become The Merciful One?"

Fahui's eyes widened at this and he licked his lips, staring intently at the old monk. "What was the answer?" he asked eagerly, his eyes gleaming in anticipation.

The old monk deliberately paused. Fahui, already hot-tempered, grew impatient and shouted, "Abbot! Do not keep me in suspense. Tell me quickly!"

"Hahahaha!"

The old monk laughed loudly and said, "The Merciful One calculated, listening intently, and after a long while answered, He must seek the great whale. If he does not survive this ordeal, he will still perish in the belly of the whale dragon."

Everyone exchanged glances, deep in thought, discussing among themselves. Fahui hesitated, then took an artifact handed to him by a fellow monk and said fiercely, "No matter the ordeal, I will convert this heretic and become a master monk!"

With that, Fahui bowed deeply to the old monk, then cupped his fist to the other monks and said loudly, "Fortunately, he mentioned going to Mount Luoxia, so he should not be hard to track. I'll be off now!"
𝕗𝗿𝕖𝐞𝐰𝗲𝕓𝐧𝕠𝕧𝗲𝐥.𝚌𝐨𝚖

With that, he took off swiftly, leaving a trail of dust behind him. The remaining disciples gathered around the abbot, and one of them said, "Senior Brother Fahui practices the Wrathful Eye technique and is on the verge of a breakthrough. If he can catch that person by surprise, he can still kill him!"

"Indeed!"

They discussed it eagerly among themselves while the old monk's smile faded.

He trembled as he turned away, muttering, "Opportunity is also an ordeal... There is no such thing as a perfect situation..."

Fahui of Duanchen Temple had set his sights on Li Xuanling. Meanwhile, Li Xuanling flew on, crossing field after field, his heart filled with concern. He thought to himself, This Zhao State is full of Buddhist cultivators, and if they are all as crazy as this one... it's too dangerous here! I don't even know where Mount Luoxia is, and it's not a place I must visit. I've been out for a few months; perhaps it's best to return now.

He then changed direction and flew south. It was already late, and as he looked down at the gray-yellow land beneath him in the twilight, he saw tenant farmers sitting around fires. They were listening to monks talking about the suffering of this life and the promise of becoming Maha or Dharma Master in the next. Li Xuanling concealed himself quietly, listening to the ordinary monks speaking with great longing.

Although the tenant farmers were emaciated and covered in scars and dirt, their eyes were bright with hope and yearning. Li Xuanling stood silently in the darkness for a while, listening to their joyful cheers and devout prayers, his heart filled with complex emotions.

"Whether the talk of lands of bliss and reincarnation is true or false, who among the immortals, devils, and Buddhists is right or wrong... The world is filled with deceit and darkness beyond words."

————

Time on the lake passed as smoothly as the water, the deep blue waves gradually growing colder. Xiao Xian once again brought several family servants to Lijing Town, sitting nervously under the main hall.

"Brother Xiao!" Li Yuanping called out, his face pale. He smiled as he sat at the head of the hall, looking down at Xiao Xian. "We have not seen each other for a few months, and your cultivation has improved greatly!" he commended with a smile.

Xiao Xian's talent was mediocre, having just broken through to the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Li Yuanping's words were naturally flattery, and Xiao Xian simply smiled and let it pass. After sitting for a while, not knowing how to start the conversation, Li Yuanping decided to take the initiative and asked, "What brings you here today, Brother Xiao?"

Xiao Xian nodded, organizing his thoughts before replying respectfully, "I am now eighteen, and my family is preparing to find a wife for me..."

Hearing this, Li Yuanping immediately understood his intentions. He stroked his chin and thought, Qingxiao is now thirteen or fourteen... Mount Yu's branch probably wants to settle this matter early, fearing problems later.

Xiao Xian paused and then continued sincerely, "You probably already know, but I have admired Lady Qingxiao for a long time and sincerely wish to marry her. Could you convey my feelings to the elders and the lady herself? If it is agreeable, my family will send a proposal."

Li Yuanping rubbed the jade cup in his hand. Marriage proposals between clans were not made rashly. Typically, someone would first sound out the other party to ensure a positive response before formally proposing. Xiao Xian was now bringing this matter forward formally.

After all, for a clan, a direct rejection would be a blatant insult. Giving prior notice prevented awkwardness and enmity from forming if the proposal was unsuccessful.

Li Yuanping nodded, put down his teacup, and said solemnly, "Brother Xiao has helped me greatly... I will not stand idly by. I will inquire and speak well of you. You can expect good news."

Xiao Xian had gone through all this trouble for this assurance. Seeing Li Yuanping agree without asking for anything in return, he felt deeply relieved and grateful. "Thank you very much, Young Master!" he expressed sincerely.

Li Yuanping smiled, and the two chatted about various topics. Suddenly, Li Yuanping remembered something and asked, "Earlier this year, a devil cultivator named Murong Xia passed through our territory... He was quite domineering. Do you know what became of him?"

"Murong Xia?" Xiao Xian repeated as he thought for a moment and replied, "Does he cultivate the Virtuous Benevolence Devil Dao? The one who nurtures a human head in his belly? I have heard some things about him."

"Indeed," Li Yuanping confirmed.

Seeing his affirmation, Xiao Xian became more spirited and replied, "This person went south after passing through your family's territory. In our land, he devoured hundreds of people, acting as if everyone were treated equally. He claimed that they all went to enjoy themselves in his belly."

Li Yuanping remained silent, feeling a stir in his heart, and asked, "I heard my brother mention this person. From your perspective, is this so-called land of bliss real?"

Xiao Xian sneered and answered, "Whether it is real or not, I do not know. I would rather die than enter it! Even if it is true, what good is pleasure when you're under someone else's control?"

He paused and smirked sarcastically before continuing, "As for this Murong Xia, it is said that after devouring 16,756 people, he will become a Maha. He must have some incredible background, with many Master Monks and Merciful Ones escorting him. Even our family had to respectfully send him off."

He took a sip from his tea bowl and continued, "I thought he was some great Dharma Master, but he deliberately avoided the territory of the Yue Cultivating Sect... I guess he was scared."

Li Yuanping suddenly understood and, after a moment of thought, replied, "Could it be the Sword Immortal Daoist Master Shangyuan? Being both a Sword Immortal and at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm, even Murong Xia would not dare provoke him."

Xiao Xian nodded and said, "Exactly. Excluding the Golden Core Realm cultivators, Daoist Master Shangyuan is the strongest in this region. The vast land of Xu State belonging to the Yue Cultivating Sect proves this. Daoist Master Shangyuan cares for the common people and clans. If Murong Xia dared to flaunt his ways there, not even a few Merciful Ones could save him."

The two chatted in detail for a while, but Xiao Xian seemed restless. Seeing this, Li Yuanping laughed and said softly, "Please wait a moment, brother. I will go up the mountain and inquire for you."




# Chapter 313: Ping And Xiao

Li Yuanping performed a hand seal before passing through the golden barrier of the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation and ascending Mount Lijing alone.

Since Li Tongya had gone into seclusion for cultivation and Li Yuanjiao had gone to Mount Wutu, Li Yuanping took over the responsibilities of the Li Family. He often stayed at the foot of the mountain for several months, leaving Mount Lijing largely deserted. The weeds between the stones had grown wildly, giving the place an overgrown look.

Li Yuanping climbed the mountain and pushed open the wooden gate of the side courtyard, where he saw a round-faced girl spreading out books and wooden slips to dry in the courtyard. Her attire was simple and her sleeves were tightly sewn, making her look more like a busy servant rather than a daughter of a prestigious clan.

"Qingxiao!"

A faint smile appeared on Li Yuanping's pale face as he called out to the girl.

The girl looked up in surprise and exclaimed with joy, "Brother?! What brings you up here on the mountain?"

The children of the Li Family had grown up together on the mountain and were close. Li Yuanping laughed heartily and replied, "I have come to see you."

Li Qingxiao smiled sweetly and teased, "I heard you recently married a lovely wife. I thought it was her pillow talk that brought you here!"

Li Yuanping's face turned red with embarrassment, and he quickly changed the subject, saying awkwardly, "How can you stand staying on the mountain? It is eerily quiet here."

Li Qingxiao's lips curled up as she shook her head and replied, "It is not too bad. Big Sister[1] often comes up to visit me. Besides, I have a lot of books to keep me busy!"

Li Qingxiao's resembled Chen Donghe more than her mother. Her features were not remarkable, and if not for the gentle temperament that showed in her eyes, she would have looked quite plain. She grinned, further disrupting the harmony of her facial features, causing her to look less elegant.

"Though I stay on the mountain, I have heard many rumors about the Dou Family being overbearing and possessing private spirit fields," she said bluntly.

Li Yuanping nodded, his eyes widening with interest as he was sensitive to these matters. Although these words came from Li Qingxiao, they immediately made him think of the Chen Family and other branches. Smiling, he asked, "What's your opinion about that?"

Li Qingxiao blinked and answered without hesitation, "I suspect the Dou Family has offended our family's branches!"

"How so?" Li Yuanping asked, intrigued.

Li Qingxiao answered, "I have met Madam Dou. She's a shrewd and capable woman. There's no way she couldn't control her clan. The so-called overbearing behavior of the Dou Family likely touches on the interests of many. Old Master Dou is shortsighted and not worth worrying about.

"As for private spirit fields... This matter is neither big nor small. Which of the prominent families does not secretly open some spirit fields? It is an unspoken rule, but bringing it up suggests a larger issue involving more than just the Dou Family. If pursued, many prominent families would be implicated."

Li Qingxiao blinked and smiled, continuing, "Such direct targeting of the Dou Family without fear of offending other prominent families must come from our own elders and uncles! They must be testing you since you have just taken charge."

The Li Family had specific standards for dividing spirit fields, and the ones with thin spiritual qi were dismissed by the Li Family but eagerly sought after by prominent families.

Li Qingxiao did not need to investigate to know that these people likely had private spirit fields. Li Yuanping laughed heartily and nodded repeatedly, remarking, "You are right, but you missed the Chen Family."

Seeing Li Qingxiao frown in confusion, Li Yuanping explained, "You live alone on the mountain... For you to hear these rumors, they must have come from your father who heard it from the Chen Family. These negative rumors have shown the Chen Family's stance."

Li Qingxiao suddenly understood, clapping her hands in realization. Li Yuanping then continued seriously, "In the past five years, our family has taken over Mount Yuting and Mount Huazhong. The spiritual energy in Huazhong is especially abundant, even richer than in several towns in Lijing. The bustling world thrives on profit, and the chaos is driven by it. Do not think the prominent families and branches are fighting without reason; it is all for the benefit of these two places."

Seeing Li Qingxiao nod thoughtfully, Li Yuanping continued, "For decades, the branches have been suppressed by us, unable to become landlords or wealthy merchants, even enjoying themselves in secret. How can they be content? Naturally, they seek opportunities to speculate in these two places."

"I have just started managing the family and I have not used any harsh methods, so naturally, these people are getting restless. The Dou Family seems arrogant and overbearing, but they are actually good dogs. They do not get along with the other branches, making them handy to use," Li Yuanping explained as he picked up a wooden slip from the desk and gently flipped it over before continuing, "When our Jade Court Guards all break through to the Jade Capital Stage and gain spiritual senses, they will easily be able to monitor the activities in Huazhong and Yuting. Once I have control over the entire clan, these branches will have no room to maneuver, and the time will be right."

Li Qingxiao nodded silently and said, "The families on the lake have always been wary of outsiders and relied heavily on the branches. Yet, Brother, you do the opposite and seem to be most cautious of the branches."

Li Yuanping smiled and replied, "There are loyal cultivators among the branches who naturally need to be promoted. However, most are parasites and wastrels. But at the end of the day, they are still related to us. If I do not handle this well, the next generation will have an even harder time dealing with them due to their lack of seniority. The Lu and Yu Families serve as clear warnings; we must be cautious."

They exchanged a knowing smile with each other. Li Yuanping then remembered his true purpose for the visit and asked abruptly, "By the way, what do you think of Xiao Xian from Mount Yu?"

They had been discussing important family matters, and the sudden change of topic caught Li Qingxiao off guard.

"Ah!" She exclaimed in surprise before lowering her head.

Li Yuanping looked at her carefully and teased, "I guess words aren't needed when it comes to matters between a man and a woman."

Li Qingxiao quickly raised her head, her cheeks slightly red, and retorted, "Brother, what are you saying? This man is frivolous, running to our place every day. Everyone knows how much he admires me, and it is quite embarrassing!"

"Hahaha!" Li Yuanping laughed heartily in amusement and commented, "He is sincere. Given his status in the Mount Yu branch, he has already humbled himself greatly."

"True..." Li Qingxiao smiled as she calmed herself down, and then said seriously, "He appears deeply affectionate, but I am not a naive girl who does not know anything. A few acts of kindness do not make a good man. We have only shared a few encounters; I know his face, but not his heart. We still need to consult the elders."

Li Yuanping nodded lightly and replied, "He has a gentle nature, comes from a prestigious family, and has both good looks and intelligence. He is honest and sincere; it is hard to find someone better. I have already sent for Uncle Donghe and our big brother."

"Good," Li Qingxiao responded softly, tying up her long hair as she softly said, "I have also looked into the children from other families within the clan. None of them seem capable, and their characters are worse. If we can find someone from a prestigious clan outside, it would definitely be better than a prominent family within."

Li Yuanping, his face pale, nodded and smiled, saying, "Brother Yuanyun's children are also on the mountain. How do you find living with them?"

Hearing this, Li Qingxiao hesitated, organizing her thoughts but found herself unable to express them. She shook her head in response, looking regretful and melancholic.

Li Yuanping paused, his expression puzzled. He opened his mouth slightly and said in a low voice, "The ancestor and Uncle Ling both have such excellent temperaments. How could it be that in the later generations..."

Li Qingxiao gave him a look, signaling him to stop, and hinted, "Brother Yuanyun left the mountain years ago and went to Eastern Mount Yue, saying that he was looking for a shamanic method to open up spiritual orifices. He has not returned for several years..."

Both fell silent. Everyone knew that Li Yuanyun had no spiritual orifice but no one dared to mention it, treating it like a taboo. Among the direct descendants, he lived the most aimless life.

However, they all understood that if there were truly a method to open spiritual orifices, it would not be found in a small region like Eastern Mount Yue, nor would it be easily accessible.

Li Yuanping sighed and said, "Uncle Xuanling has gone to travel in Xu State, and Big Sister is cultivating in seclusion. The elders feel guilty toward him and never impose any restrictions on him; they always let him do as he pleases. There's nothing we can do too... I also discussed this with Big Brother, but he suggested we just let him be. As long as he doesn't do anything bad or harm people by performing blood sacrifices while he collects shamanic spells in Eastern Mount Yue, and if it can alleviate his frustration and resentment, it might actually be a good thing."

Li Qingxiao sighed softly and murmured, "I guess that's true..."

1. Li Qingxiao's Big Sister is Li Qinghong. ☜




# Chapter 314: Black Serpent

The crimson fire blazed fiercely in the fields, the piled-up straw crackling in the flames. Under the pitch-black night, the burning blood-red flames illuminated the eerily silent, deserted village. Dark blood flowed quietly on the ground.

In the center stood a dark stone platform covered in dark red runes. Many men and women, dressed in Daoist robes, kneeled upon it. Sharp dharma weapons had pierced through their throats, and they lay collapsed on the sacrificial altar.

A chilling wind blew, creating a mournful wail. Nine piles of bones, varying in size, were neatly arranged around the area, most of them fragmented. In the middle, a cultivator clad in black sat cross-legged, his eyes closed in deep concentration.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes, mana light flickering within its depths. His skin was slightly tanned, his hair disheveled, revealing him to be a man of Mount Yue. He stood up, humming a song, and picked up a black gourd, glancing at the moon. He murmured softly, "The moon is at its zenith, the yin energy is at its peak... Perfect!"

He then gently lifted the black gourd, which was covered in numerous runes that began to glow with a blood-red light. He shook it lightly as his mana flowed freely, and shouted, "Collect!"

Immediately, black and blood-red qi rose from the piles of bones, emitting a cacophony of sharp, mournful screams. The qi interwove in the air like threads, like homing swallows, all of it wafting toward the sacrificial altar and into the small opening of the gourd.

"Good... good!"

The black-robed cultivator waited for an hour until the resentment qi and blood qi were fully collected into his gourd. The piles of bones had now withered, crackling as they disintegrated. The blood-red light on the gourd grew increasingly intense.

He finally stopped in satisfaction and said, "Over three thousand people, six Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators. This batch should please the sect master!"

Smiling contentedly, he looked at the ground and, after some thought, cast a spell. The blood on the ground began to move as it seemed to come to life, quickly forming large characters on the ground—The killer is Jiang Yan.

He examined his work closely, squeezing out a laugh from his throat. His black robe fluttered though there was no wind, and he cackled, "The sect master's method is indeed flawless!"

As he marveled, an indistinct voice emerged from beside him.

"It truly is a good method!"

"Who's there?" he asked as he looked up abruptly and in shock, seeing a young face appear beside him, smirking and staring intently right at him with vermillion lips.

The youth sneered, "Chi Zhiyun has indeed made a good plan... The Azure Pond Sect collects the resentment qi and blood qi while I, Jiang Yan, take the blame..?"

"Jiang Yan?!"

The man was terrified, exclaiming, "You... Are you not in Linghai Prefecture?!"

Realizing the situation, his eyes filled with mana light, blood qi rising from his body. He tried to fly away, turning to escape.

"And here I am, wondering why there are so many devil cultivators around... It seems that it is your Azure Chi Devil Gate stealing from itself!" Jiang Yan sneered, reaching out.

The man had just taken to the air but fell heavily to the ground with a loud thud. As a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, this barely fazed him. He stomped his foot on the ground and reached for the whip at his waist.

Jiang Yan performed a hand seal with his left hand and pointed at the man with his right. The man's robes twisted together and deformed, the runes on the whip transforming into scales that stood up menacingly. The whip came alive, turning into a black, ugly serpent, hissing and lunging at the man's hand.

"What kind of spell is this?!"

The man was horrified as he screamed, quickly casting a spell and striking the serpent away. But before he could react, the nine piles of bones around him stirred, each connecting and forming a massive skeletal hand that reached for him, covering the sky.

"How could a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator still use a Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifact?" Jiang Yan mocked coldly, a smirk appearing on his face.

The cultivator dressed in black conjured a blood-red spell and punched a large hole through the massive skeletal hand, leaping out amidst the raining bones to strike Jiang Yan on the head.

The young man looked up, exhaled a deep black mist, and caught the cultivator's spell. He even had the time to smile as he asked, "Master, what kind of immortal foundation does this person have?"

From within the black mist emerged the sinister black serpent, flicking its tongue and speaking in a gravelly voice, "He drinks the blood of the people... He must be originally from Mount Wu under Duanmu Kui and later joined the Azure Pond Sect..."

When the black-robed cultivator saw Jiang Yan refer to the transformed black serpent as his master, his heart went cold, and he mumbled, "J-Jiang Boqing... How is this possible?! You did not get captured by the Emissaries of Death?! How is this possible..."

The black serpent chuckled, and the blood and bones around them swirled like a whirlwind, violently splitting into numerous small hands that reached for the cultivator. The serpent hissed and cackled, "I do not cultivate the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao... my name is not on their lists! How could they possibly catch me?"

The cultivator who was dressed in black was rendered speechless. As Jiang Yan chanted spells, the attacks from the blood and bones grew more intense. Forced into a corner, he thought to himself with relief, Fortunately, I collected the blood qi and resentment qi first, otherwise, this spell would have been much stronger!

Looking up again, the black serpent had vanished. The black-robed cultivator's heart skipped a beat, his spiritual sense searching all around him as he said respectfully, "Master Jiang, our Dao lineage are similar, both derived from the immortal talisman and curse... I have long admired you..."

But before he could finish begging for mercy, a sinister voice hissed in his ear, "Where is the Answers to a Beggar’s Questions Under the Mulberry Tree?"

"I... I do not know!"

Hearing the name of the secret technique, Answers to a Beggar’s Questions Under the Mulberry Tree, terror almost overflowed from the cultivator's face. He stammered, "N-Not only the Purple Mansion Realms of the three sects and seven gates... but even the Pristine Water is..."

"Silence!"

The black serpent's scales bristled, its eyes bulging as it scolded, "How dare you speak that name out loud? Are you mad? This is not Duanmu Kui's territory... You dare utter that name in Azure Chi Devil Gate's territory?"

"Y-Y-Yes!" the black-robed cultivator stammered, continuing, "E-Even... the True Monarch personally went to Mount Wu. There truly is nothing there! If I'm lying I'll be struck by five thunders and never reincarnate!"

"Hahahahaha... you are quite clever."

The black serpent's voice carried a snake-like hiss, sinister and eerie. "In this day and age, what good are oaths? Since the True Monarch himself came, could he not have divined the truth, or perhaps searched souls and seized spirits?" the snake hissed.

The black-robed cultivator's immortal foundation was operating at full capacity, barely holding off the skeletal attacks. His eyes were bloodshot, blood vessels clearly visible as he stammered, "S-Senior, do not deceive me... Duanmu Kui met the immortals. His fate is so chaotic that even if there were an opportunity, who would dare to calculate it?! The grace of immortals is vast, and their might is like a prison. Even the True Monarch would not dare to probe! As for searching souls and seizing spirits... Duanmu Kui failed his breakthrough and has become a Locust Shade Ghost. Where could you search for his soul!"

The black serpent fell silent, its voice full of resentment as it hissed, "You have cultivated on Mount Wu for many years. Have you ever seen this secret technique?"

"Never..."

The black serpent said nothing more. The cultivator knew this meant trouble, sensing Jiang Boqing's murderous intent. Trapped by Jiang Yan's skeletal spell, he knew he could not escape. Gritting his teeth, he shouted, "I beseech the profound light true talisman, this wicked ghost and demon, disrupting my path... I humbly request the profound light to..."

Before he could finish reciting the shamanic incantation, the black serpent laughed wildly and darted like lightning toward his neck. Its voice hissed and echoed in their surroundings.

"What do you think you are doing?!"




# Chapter 315: Betrothal

The flesh and bones in the air swiftly condensed into chains, binding the limbs of the black-robed cultivator. Below, Jiang Yan completed the final hand seals of his spell. The cultivator was already in a state of shock and despair, watching as the black serpent slithered around his neck.

"Senior, since you know I am from Mount Wu and are aware of many secrets, you should also know that even if I cannot defeat you, I have plenty of ways to take you down with me!" he yelled threateningly.

With a resolute expression, the cultivator glared at the approaching black serpent. The serpent flicked its tongue and let out a cold laugh, taunting, "Why not give it a try?"

The black-robed cultivator's eyes widened in sudden realization, and he exclaimed, "This is... Blood Drinker! How is this possible?!... You!"

Strange, dark red mana lights began to rise from his body, obediently flowing toward Jiang Boqing, dancing and swirling around the serpent.
𝕗𝐫𝚎𝗲𝘄𝐞𝕓𝐧𝕠𝘃𝕖𝐥.𝐜𝚘𝚖

"Why is it impossible?" Jiang Boqing continued taunting as he flicked his tongue, his hissing voice calming down as he said lightly, "I, too, once sought the Supreme Shaman's Three Nine Blood Essence. Though I later abandoned that cultivation path to focus on other methods, I am still far stronger than a half-baked cultivator like you."

The black-robed cultivator could only make incoherent sounds, while Jiang Boqing's voice was filled with satisfaction as he exclaimed, "The Blood Drinker still recognizes me, but it holds you in utter contempt!"

Below, Jiang Yan watched the drama unfold lazily, saying, "Master! Did you not want that thunder attribute immortal foundation? What kind of metallic essence does this Blood Drinker have?"

The black serpent straightened its body, finally transforming into a long black whip that slowly fell to the ground. A dark cloud rose on the face of the black-robed cultivator, who began to babble nonsensically.

"Let's use this body for now and look for a better one to replace it! Although Duanmu Kui is dead, no one practices the Supreme Shaman's Three Nine Blood Essence anymore. Answers to a Beggar's Questions Under the Mulberry Tree is nowhere to be found... Where can I find the remaining immortal foundations? There is no way forward with this Blood Drinker."

Jiang Yan nodded, and then heard Jiang Boqing's sinister voice from above, "It is still a Foundation Establishment Realm body, and it is not easy to take over. Guard me while I occupy it."

The black-robed cultivator sat down heavily, the dark cloud swirling on his face. Jiang Yan walked a few steps forward and took the black gourd from the cultivator's waist, saying with a light smile, "Baleful blood and resentment qi... how convenient, exactly what I needed!"

Though Jiang Yan's tone was casual, his eyes were filled with suspicion. He weighed the gourd in his hand, removed the lid, and glanced at the bright red baleful qi within it. He sat down cross-legged, placed his fingers together at his brow, and drew out a bright golden talisman.

This talisman was entirely golden, glowing with mana light. Jiang Yan poured out the crimson baleful and resentment qi and began to silently refine it.

————

Mount Wutu was close to Mount Lijing. It only took Li Yuanjiao the time to burn half a stick of incense to arrive by riding the wind. When he landed on the mountain, both Li Yuanping and Li Qingxiao stood up and greeted him respectfully.

"Big Brother!"

"Brother Jiao!"

Li Yuanjiao's eyes shone brightly, and his aura was vigorous. It seemed that under the support of the Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit Talisman and his diligent cultivation on Mount Wutu, his strength had significantly improved over the past year or two. He nodded at his younger siblings.

Chen Donghe and his wife had been nearby and quickly returned to Mount Lijing. Li Jingtian looked worried, while Chen Donghe remained calm and thoughtful.

As they chatted, it was clear their minds were elsewhere, waiting for their sister, Li Qinghong, to arrive. However, no matter how long they waited, her heroic figure was nowhere in sight. After an hour, someone finally reported, standing respectfully at the courtyard entrance, "Reporting from Yuting Peak, the immortal master entered seclusion yesterday to attempt a breakthrough to the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and has not yet emerged. I thought she might be at a critical point in her breakthrough and dared not knock on the door, so I came back to report."

"Qinghong is in the midst of a breakthrough..."

The group exchanged glances. Li Jingtian, unable to contain herself since Qingxiao was her daughter, spoke up softly.

"Xiao'er, come with me inside."

With a gentle nod to the others, she smiled and said, "We have some private matters to discuss, please wait a moment."

The group nodded in agreement, and the mother and daughter entered the room. Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist and asked, "Uncle, what do you think?"

Chen Donghe shook his head and replied gently, "I have heard about Xiao Xian... He seems sincere enough. Qingxiao is my only daughter. I do not expect Xiao Xian to become a Foundation Establishment Realm immortal cultivator. As long as he treats my daughter well, that is enough."

Chen Donghe's voice was gentle but firm. Over the years, he had broken through to the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, becoming a mainstay of the Li Family. His dignified presence exuded authority as he continued, "If Qingxiao is willing, I have no objections to this marriage."

Yuanping and Yuanjiao exchanged glances, and Li Yuanjiao spoke, "Uncle, rest assured. The Mount Yu branch would not dare mistreat Qingxiao. If this marriage goes through, it will be a grand affair with betrothal gifts lining up as long as ten li!"

While the group outside discussed matters, Li Qingxiao followed her mother Li Jingtian into the room. Li Jingtian held her daughter's hand, her tone urgent and concerned. "This is a significant matter... Have you thought it through?"

Li Qingxiao lowered her head and quietly replied, "If I refuse Xiao Xian, not only will it be awkward for the family, but Mother... would you be able to find someone better for me?"

Li Jingtian frowned and was about to open her mouth to speak, but then shook her head and said, "Matters of love should always be about mutual willingness. It is not about whether he is good or not, but whether you want to... The family has never forced marriage upon anyone. Even if you want to marry a mortal without a spiritual orifice, your father and I will support you unconditionally."

Li Qingxiao blinked and suddenly laughed lightly, her smile radiant as she said, "Leaving the mortals aside, I have not even considered the prominent families in our household. Mother, you must be joking! This is not some fictional story. Naturally, our spouses must match us in social status. As for whether there is mutual affection... Given our family's current status, how many families can we even marry into? How many would dare to marry into ours? There are only a few families, scattered across a thousand li. Seeing each other once before marriage is rare enough, let alone discussing feelings. We should only consider their appearance and character."

Li Jingtian, who was well aware of this, sighed softly, her concern making her lose perspective. Li Qingxiao lowered her head, her voice calm and rational as she said, "Xiao Xian has shown enough respect... We shouldn't be too overcritical and pursue perfection in life."

After a private conversation, the mother and daughter emerged from the room, and Li Qingxiao agreed to the matter with a smile. Li Yuanjiao nodded and said, "Then I will report to the ancestor and write to Cloud Crowned Peak to finalize this matter."

Everyone nodded in agreement, but just then, a person hurriedly approached. Glancing at the group in the courtyard, he hesitated for a moment before bowing respectfully in front of Li Yuanjiao and said, "Young masters, someone from the Xiao Family has arrived, saying there has been a change within their sect."

"Who has come?" Li Yuanjiao asked.

The clan guard replied, "The eldest son of the Xiao Family, Xiao Guitu."

"Xiao Guitu?!"

Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanping exchanged a look, then cupped their fists toward Li Jingtian and Chen Donghe before leaving in haste.

After seeing them off, Chen Donghe sat down in the room. Li Jingtian nudged her husband, glancing at Li Qingxiao who had gone out to collect the books, and said softly, "Xiao Xian is good, but he lacks ambition. He is clever but not decisive. I fear he will not achieve great things..."

"Great things..." Chen Donghe repeated as he shook his head, putting his sword into its embroidered pouch, and replied gently, "As long as he can live an honest life, what more can we ask for? Soaring eagles and sparrows that fly too high are soon shot down by hunters, leaving our daughter a widow."

Li Jingtian shook her head, her voice filled with worry as she said, "That's not necessarily true. Even if he does not soar, that doesn't guarantee that she won't suffer."




# Chapter 316: Molten Metal Cave

Xiao Xian waited anxiously in the hall, unable to calm his nerves. He fidgeted with the jade cup on the table, constantly changing his posture.

After a long while, a clamor of footsteps echoed from outside the courtyard. Xiao Xian, who had been slumping in his seat, immediately straightened up, his anxiety increasing even more. He heard a flattering voice from outside.

"Young Master Guitu, my master is currently on the mountain discussing important matters with his clan brothers... Please, wait a moment..."

"No problem."

The voice was mature and steady, but it struck Xiao Xian like a bolt of lightning. His mind went blank, with only one thought reverberating in his mind.

Xiao Guitu... what is he doing here?

In just an instant, a young man entered the courtyard. He had broad shoulders and a robust build, exuding a majestic aura. The intricate runes on his armor glowed with mana light, indicating his status as an important figure in the immortal clan.

Xiao Xian dared not be negligent. He quickly adjusted his robes and bowed deeply, greeting respectfully, "Xiao Xian of Mount Yu branch greets the young master!"

This man was indeed Xiao Guitu, now at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, the elder brother of Xiao Guiluan and the most outstanding figure of his generation in the Xiao Family. As the head of the main branch of the Xiao Family, Xiao Guitu's presence commanded great respect. Xiao Xian did not dare to be negligent and immediately showed the proper deference.

"Xiao Xian of Mount Yu..." Xiao Guitu glanced at him with a curious expression and smiled. "I have heard of you. The Mount Yu branch has done well these past few years. I have also heard you have some connection with the second young lady of the Li Family."

Xiao Xian forced a smile, uncertain of Xiao Guitu's intentions. He hesitated but then invited him to sit. Xiao Guitu strode forward confidently before taking his seat. He stared at Xiao Xian and remarked, "Not bad."

Xiao Xian secretly breathed a sigh of relief as Xiao Guitu continued, "I have important matters to discuss with the Li Family. You may listen."

As soon as he had finished speaking, several people entered the hall, led by a man in black with a sword at his waist— it was Li Yuanjiao. He stepped forward with a smile and said, "I am Li Yuanjiao, pleased to meet you, Young Master Xiao."

Xiao Guitu looked up and their gazes met in mid-air, each feeling a sense of awe. Xiao Guitu laughed heartily and replied, "So it is my brother-in-law! I am Xiao Guitu. I have heard much about you."

Li Yuanjiao nodded and took the main seat. With Xiao Guitu seated, Xiao Xian had no place to sit and stood respectfully beside him. When Li Yuanping entered later, he dismissed the others with a nod.

As the people left the courtyard and carefully closed the courtyard gates, an isolating barrier was activated. Xiao Guitu sipped his tea and got straight to the point, speaking in a serious tone.

"I came here for two matters. First, our clan uncle, Xiao Yongling, has broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, achieving the Dao Foundation of Eastern Feather Mountain. He will take over guarding the north and will not return to Cloud Crowned Peak for several decades."

"Congratulations! It is a pity our ancestor is in seclusion; otherwise, he would have personally seen him off," Li Yuanjiao responded respectfully. Xiao Yongling, being of the same generation as Li Tongya, was referred to with great respect.

Xiao Guitu accepted Li Yuanjiao's congratulations on behalf of Xiao Yongling and continued, "Second, according to the Yuan Family, Yu Muxian has come out of seclusion and has also broken through to Foundation Establishment Realm, achieving the immortal foundation Molten Metal Cave... This immortal foundation has not been achieved for over a century and has even drawn the attention of Daoist Masters."

After these words were spoken, everyone present fell silent. Li Yuanjiao played with his jade cup, his expression somber as he replied, "Thank you, Young Master."

Xiao Guitu paused, giving him some time to think, and then continued, "Molten Metal Cave specializes in smithing but is extremely difficult to cultivate. Firstly, it requires exceptional talent. Secondly, during cultivation, one must constantly endure the pain of skin peeling off... Yuanwu Peak once had a disciple who practiced this method, but he wailed day and night, and eventually abandoned it. Yu Muxian's ability to master this Dao shows great perseverance and should not be underestimated."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, his expression unchanged, and sincerely said, "Our family also heard that Yu Muxian is rumored to be well-connected within the sect, quick-witted, and eloquent. I have one more question... Is this Molten Metal Cave... a certain Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's Dao Partner?"

This question was too sensitive, causing Xiao Xian to lower his head. Xiao Guitu paused, his eyes bright, and answered, "I considered this as well. Before leaving home, I specifically asked the ancestor this. There is no Metallic Essence in Jiangnan that aligns with the Molten Metal Cave."

The two men exchanged a glance, both realizing the underlying issue. Li Yuanjiao lowered his voice and sneered. "Chi Zhiyun really thinks highly of him!"

Xiao Guitu drank his tea unhurriedly and replied, "Chi Zhiyun wants to support the Yu Family at Moongaze Lake to keep our family in check. Yu Muxian is just the lucky one. However, this lucky person is ruthless, which is concerning."

Li Yuanjiao looked up, carefully observing Xiao Guitu's expression, and asked softly, "What do you mean, Young Master...?"

Xiao Guitu shook his head silently and replied, "It's a complicated matter... The divine abilities of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are extraordinary. The higher their cultivation, the more divine abilities they possess, and become increasingly inhuman. It is impossible for those below Purple Mansion Realm to interfere. The fact that the Daoist Master personally received Yu Muxian makes the intention clear."

Li Yuanjiao tactfully stopped pressing. Xiao Guitu cupped his fist and continued, "After Yu Muxian came out of seclusion, there were rumors within the sect about a sword immortal being unwell. Your clan should be cautious."

He paused and explained, "There are very few sword immortals in the world. The Qingsui Sword Immortal was famous throughout Jiangnan and Jiangbei during his years. Now, he has not appeared for decades, causing widespread suspicion and rampant rumors."

Li Yuanjiao sighed silently. He had only recently learned the truth—that his nominal grandfather had perished at the southern border. Judging from Xiao Guitu's tone, the entire Xiao Family was likely aware of this.

He nodded in agreement, discussed some matters concerning Xiao Guiluan, and then had Li Xizhi brought up. The child obediently called him uncle, bringing a genuine smile to Xiao Guitu's face.

Xiao Guitu laughed and remarked, "Seeing this nephew of mine reminds me of Guiluan when she was just a kid. I still vividly remember how she was always rowdy and full of laughter. Guiluan came back to visit these past two years, and I've heard about your marriage... It's indeed good news."

Li Yuanjiao laughed heartily. Xiao Guitu played with Li Xizhi for a bit before sending the child away then cupped his fist and took his leave.

Xiao Xian followed behind, managing only a quick cup of his fist to Li Yuanping before saying hastily, "Please inform me if there is any news."

He then quickly chased after Xiao Guitu. Li Yuanjiao saw them off at the edge of the Li Family's territory and then flew back to the courtyard. By then, the sky had already darkened.

Li Yuanjiao settled before his desk, where Li Yuanping had been waiting for some time. The brothers exchanged glances, and Li Yuanping pondered for a moment before asking, "Brother, how credible do you think Xiao Guitu's words are?"

Li Yuanjiao frowned, tapping his jade cup on the desk in frustration. "It is hard to say. Xiao Guitu is no fool. His words seemed sincere, and his demeanor was measured. It is difficult to discern the truth... The Xiao Family is indeed full of talent. Xiao Chuting, Xiao Yongling... and now Xiao Guitu. None of them are easy to deal with.

"The ancestor once said that although the Xiao Family and the Azure Pond Sect appear to be at odds on the surface, they are quite aligned in private. We cannot be sure what these Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are planning. While the Xiao Family has done us favors, they would not deceive us about such things. But if we follow their lead too blindly, we will eventually become stepping stones for their cultivation."

Li Yuanping nodded silently, his pale face showing signs of unease.

"Yu Muxian's recent breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm means he will surely interfere with matters on the lake."

Li Yuanjiao deliberated for a moment, then decisively said, "Open the cave dwelling at Meichi Peak and inform the ancestor!"




# Chapter 317: Forbidden To Return South

"Save me, fellow Daoist..."

"Hand over the panacea!"

............

Since Li Xuanling had decided to return south, he naturally flew straight toward the south. Along the way, he witnessed chaotic scenes—battles between immortal and devil cultivators over treasures, and Buddhist cultivators subduing demons with both sides suffering losses. Despite opportunities to take advantage of such situations, Li Xuanling was determined to return home and flew southward without stopping.

Among the members of the Li Family, Li Xuanling had the deepest mastery of the River Crossing Torrential Step. Thus, he navigated through his journey effortlessly, avoiding any trouble as he flew along. Soon, he reached the border of Xu State where a great river surged. The waves crashed against the shore, forming layers of snow-white spray, presenting a magnificent and captivating scene before him.

Known as the ancestor of southern water veins, this great river divided the north and south, its turbulent waters being one of the most abundant sources of water qi in the land. The upper reaches extended deep into Zhao State, winding around Mount Luoxia before flowing into Wu State. Any cultivator attuned to the energies of large rivers and streams, like Li Xuanling, who practiced the River One Qi Technique, would inevitably pause to admire such magnificent scenery.

"The vastness of the river..."

When Li Xuanling first traveled north, he had passed by this great river. He spent several days there to cultivate, as it relaxed his mind and greatly improved his cultivation. Now, seeing it again upon his return, he felt an uncontrollable surge of emotions, compelling him to land by the riverbank and gaze at the pale green waters flowing east, feeling an overwhelming sense of his own insignificance.

"The momentum of life is like the flow of this great river—beyond one's control."

Reflecting on his northern journey, Li Xuanling realized that his initial aimless wandering in Xu State had inexplicably turned into a determination to visit Mount Luoxia. This thought, like a landslide or tsunami, had driven him north to Zhao State.

If not for being interrupted by Fahui, I would still be ensnared by this idea, unable to escape... Was it truly my desire to go, or was it the will of some Purple Mansion Realm or Maha?

A chill ran down Li Xuanling's spine as he pondered the possibility of being manipulated by unseen hands, making the chaotic events along the way even more frightening.

All these occurrences—like the emergence of precious panacea and Buddhist cultivators subduing demons, could have been illusions crafted to lure me further north!

Deeply disturbed, Li Xuanling walked along the riverbank until he saw a large reef. On the reef sat an old man in a straw raincoat who was dripping wet, patiently disentangling a messy fishing net.

The old man's sharp eyes fixed on Li Xuanling who had just approached, causing him to halt abruptly. As a sense of foreboding overwhelmed him, Li Xuanling's mind echoed with realization, I have been ensnared by a spell!

He immediately activated his mana, but before he could take flight, the old man spoke loudly. "Boy! There is no need to head further south!"

Li Xuanling had barely lifted off the ground before being forced back down, finding himself unable to move save for his lips.

"A Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master!" he exclaimed.

"You truly had strong willpower. We used beautiful women, demons, treasures, and wealth along the way, yet none of it could sway you even a little..."

The fisherman lowered his head again, focusing on the tangled fishing net in his hands, and said gently, "I had to step in personally to intercept you."

Li Xuanling, still unable to move, could only open his mouth slightly and murmur, "I am just a Qi Cultivator, and you are a great immortal. Why go to such lengths to ensnare a lowly cultivator like me..."

The fisherman laughed heartily, staring intently at Li Xuanling and replied, "This plan has been in the works for decades, and it cannot fail. It was no easy task to lure you north, and who knew you would be this cautious... It should not have required such trouble."

Li Xuanling suddenly felt the constraints around him loosen as the Daoist Master removed the bindings. Realizing there was no escape, he simply sat cross-legged, looking defeated. "If I am not mistaken, you are after my father. I am merely bait, right?" he asked.

The Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master shook his head and shot a glance at him, smiling once more.

"Incorrect. Your father is the bait."

A chill ran down Li Xuanling's spine. He opened his mouth and said in a hoarse voice, "But my father is always cautious. I am afraid he will not satisfy your expectations."

The Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master shook his head again and said softly, "Li Tongya has no choice but to come. He already has a premonition; otherwise, he would not be sitting quietly on Mount Lijing."
𝗳𝚛𝚎𝚎𝘄𝕖𝕓𝕟𝕠𝚟𝚎𝕝.𝗰𝕠𝐦

With a sigh of respect, the Daoist Master continued, "We Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have observed the changing world for hundreds of years and seen all kinds of people. I must say, Li Tongya is remarkable but not ruthless enough. He cannot let go of his family and principles, so he must sit and wait for his fate."

Li Xuanling was silent, clutching the long sword at his waist, tears welling up in his eyes as his face turned red. He asked, "If my father and I both go to our deaths, can the Li Family have a night of peace?"

The fisherman gave him a deep look, clapped his hands, and replied, "The demon den of Mount Dali and Xiao Chuting will protect your family. The Li Family will be fine."

Li Xuanling exhaled deeply, intending to ask more, but the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master waved his hand and said, "Enough! I answered out of respect for your father, but you keep asking questions. Go, head to Mount Luoxia!"

Li Xuanling pressed his lips together, and sighed deeply in his heart. He had no choice but to cup his fist to the Daoist Master before flying northward.

The Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master stayed behind, tidying up the fishing net, grumbling, "What a mess, unable to control even the fate of a Qi Cultivator! To think that I had to intervene myself..."

————

The cold winter gradually swept in, and the news of Xiao Yongling's breakthrough reached the market. Li Xuanxuan prepared a modest yet substantial gift and personally delivered it to Cloud Crowned Peak to congratulate Xiao Yongling.

Xiao Yongling, having successfully reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, was in high spirits. He looked at Li Xuanxuan with a complex expression as he received the jade box on the table. With a sweep of his spiritual sense, he recognized the spirit pill inside as the finest among the Qi Cultivation Realm and nodded.

"You are too thoughtful."

"Thank you for your care over the past few years, Senior..."

Li Xuanxuan had been managing the market for these years, and Xiao Yongling's presence had indeed been a significant help. He was naturally full of gratitude and responded respectfully.

Upon hearing this, Xiao Yongling hesitated slightly. He rubbed the jade cup before him with some restraint, wanting to speak but holding himself back. After pausing for over ten breaths, he waved his hand somewhat disheartened and pointed to the white-robed man beside him who was holding a long staff. He said, "After I leave, Ruyu will be in charge of the market. If your family has any important matters, you can go to him."

"Greetings, my lord!" Li Xuanxuan greeted as he cupped his fist immediately.

The white-robed Xiao Ruyu smiled lightly. Now at the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, he said softly, "I have a good relationship with Brother Xuanfeng... There is no need to be so formal. Just call me Ruyu."

After exchanging a few words, Li Xuanxuan cupped his fist and took his leave. Xiao Yongling frowned, his expression showing some guilt as he watched Li Xuanxuan's departing figure. Weary, he said, "Li Xuanling has most likely reached the north. With the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' maneuvers... I cannot speak plainly. The ancestor did his best to be subtle, but this is the result, leaving me feeling ashamed toward Li Tongya."

"It is something beyond our control."

Xiao Ruyu appeared more mature, his eyes firmer, and his voice heavier as he spoke, "Our Xiao Family... has done all we could."

Xiao Yongling gave a bitter smile and replied, "Who knows... This is the best outcome. No family can dominate Moongaze Lake. Once this matter passes, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators will hopefully settle down, sparing us from living in constant fear."




# Chapter 318: Devouring Life

As one of the top five peaks of Azure Pond Sect, Yuanwu Peak towered twice as high as the nearby Qingsui Peak, overlooking various other immortal peaks below. Misty clouds swirled all around, and being the first peak for weapon forging, fire veins surged intermittently. Occasionally, cultivators ascended and descended, creating a lively scene.

In a hidden cave on Yuanwu Peak, the spiritual qi was dense, and a spirit spring gushed forth. The dark stones stood out vividly against the white spiritual mist while a crystal jade table sparkled with brilliance, holding a pot of wine and two jade cups.

On the left was a person dressed in white and wearing a jade crown. He had a handsome appearance and an ethereal demeanor, exuding an otherworldly aura. He held a jade cup, portraying a celestial elegance, and said with a beaming smile, "This Foundation Establishment Realm is indeed different. From now on, it will nourish life and extend my lifespan by three hundred years, granting me some divine abilities!"

The person on the right had an ordinary appearance. He nodded contentedly as he heard those words, paused, and said, "Muxian, you endured the pain of flesh and blood falling away for these twenty years, and finally, you have made it through."

"It was just a small ordeal..." Yu Muxian chuckled as he waved his hand dismissively, his expression resolute with a faint smile. "Senior Brother Tang, I only wish to cultivate divine abilities and seek the metallic essence. No matter how many hardships I face, I am willing to endure all of them. Although cultivating the Molten Metal Cave is painful, it directly points to the Dao of the Purple Mansion Realm... Nothing can replace it."

Senior Brother Tang nodded respectfully and spoke softly, "Since you have achieved Foundation Establishment Realm, should you send a letter home? I have not seen you contact the Yu Family for some time."

"No need!"

Yu Muxian's expression was cold, his aura of immortality imposing as he said sternly, "Chi Zhiyan deliberately told Yu Mugao some things to scare him. It has been years since he wrote to me. My big brother is always cunning and has probably seen through my words, no longer trusting me. Yu Yufeng is already dead, and the Yu Family has lost its influence on the lake. They can't provide me with Foundation Establishment Realm elixirs, and even daily supplies are becoming scarcer. The Yu Family has lost its usefulness... I just hope they do not drag me down."

Senior Brother Tang did not feel surprised at these words and only furrowed his brow, asking, "Why not uplift the Yu Family and scour the lake's resources for yourself?"

"No." Yu Muxian shook his head and replied, "Xiao Chuting is the best at scheming, and his immortal foundation is bizarre. I do not want to confront him. Supporting the Yu Family would only bring more trouble than benefits; it is something wise people would not do."

Senior Brother Tang suddenly understood as he took a sip of the spirit tea, and asked, "I see that you are thinking things through carefully. How do you plan to proceed? Just give the orders, and though I may not have a strong cultivation, I do have some connections."

Yu Muxian pondered for a few breaths and replied, "The situation on the lake must not change... This is the result of multiple compromises. The fate that Wrathful Maha wants to take is getting closer, and the eyes of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are all focused on it. We should not make any moves. When Li Tongya crosses the river and the major matters of the Purple Mansion Realms are settled, I will stabilize the lake's affairs without major changes."

Senior Brother Tang fell silent for a moment and replied, "You mean we should bide our time for now..."

"Exactly."

Yu Muxian nodded slowly and continued softly, "The current Jiangnan appears bright, but hidden currents run deep. To the north is the Maha Reincarnate, and to the south is the shaman. Though the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators are respected, they are only small pieces on the chessboard in this great storm. We must keep our heads down and wait quietly."

Senior Brother Tang sighed. He took another sip of tea and shook his head. "It is a pity Yu Yufeng cultivated the Jade Court General and conflicted with that sword immortal. If this person had not died, he could still be of some use."

"He brought it upon himself!"

Yu Muxian's expression finally changed, showing some resentment as he said, "Daoist Master Shangyuan wanted to claim the Jade True Unified Void Essence. As soon as I heard the news after joining the sect, I specifically informed him. He still clung to luck, secretly conducting some blood sacrifice in the Yu Family! In the end, the truth came out. If I had not cleared myself quickly, I would have been dragged down by him!"

"After all, it is a matter of obstructing the Dao," Senior Brother Tang said as he sighed deeply.

————

Li Yuanjiao and the others kneeled quietly before the stone door of the cave dwelling. After a moment, a broad-shouldered man with a stern expression, carrying a sword on his back and appearing to be around sixty years old, stepped out of the cave. All the younger members of the Li Family immediately greeted him respectfully.

"Greetings, Ancestor!"

"Hmm," Li Tongya responded, holding two small letters in his hand. He glanced at Li Yuanjiao, who was kneeling below, and said warmly, "Not bad, you have already reached the fourth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm."

Li Yuanjiao had always been gifted. Since receiving the talisman, he continuously accumulated power within his body which increased with every passing moment. While Li Qinghong was still in seclusion trying to break through the third heavenly layer, he had naturally broken through to the fourth. He bowed his head slightly and replied respectfully, "All thanks to the power of the talisman qi."

Li Tongya sat down at the jade table inside the cave dwelling and took out two small letters from his sleeve. One of them was written by Li Yuanjiao, concerning Yu Muxian, which both of them were aware of and therefore skipped. The other letter came from Cloud Crowned Peak.

"Reporting to Second Uncle, Brother Ling has gone north for three months and has not returned. His jade talisman remains bright and intact."

"Uncle Xuanling... has gone missing?!" Li Yuanjiao cried out in concern.

Li Tongya nodded slowly, his face showing no surprise. He simply stared at Li Yuanjiao, asking in a low voice, "Indeed. What do you think?"

Li Yuanjiao hesitated slightly, pondering in his heart. He bit his lip and said solemnly, "Uncle Xuanling is missing, his safety unknown. I should not say this, but to speak honestly... there is likely a scheme involved!"

"Oh?" Li Tongya nodded, seemingly unaffected by his son's disappearance, and asked steadily, "Why do you think so?"

Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist and replied, "Uncle Xuanling has always been steady and reliable. It is unlike him to be gone for months without any news... If there has been no news for this long, yet the jade talisman remains undimmed and unbroken, it must be that he is intentionally being held. The intent is likely not about him but to lure the tiger away from the mountain or draw the snake out of its hole... It is either aimed at you, ancestor, or at Mount Lijing."

Li Tongya nodded approvingly and said gently, "If I continue to stay on this mountain and do not go north, within a few months, someone will bring a letter from Xuanling seeking rescue, forcing me to go there anyway."

Li Yuanjiao said hesitantly, "What if ancestor still refuses to go?"

"Then they will send his head."

Li Tongya shook his head and smiled. "The prominent figures have coveted my fate for many years. I have fought with them repeatedly, and now we are at the final move. If I comply, it will mean the deaths of both my son and myself. If I refuse, fearing death, it will be far more than just our deaths."

"So, it is the prominent figures of the Purple Mansion Realm or Maha..." Li Yuanjiao murmured, perplexed and frustrated.

"I just do not understand why they are after you, Ancestor."

"At first, I didn't understand either. I thought some member of the Purple Mansion Realm wanted to use my immortal foundation." Li Tongya chuckled and, staring into Li Yuanjiao's eyes, said seriously, "Later, when Murong Xia came and Minghui intervened to stop me, they hinted at the truth. After inquiring from multiple sources, I finally understood. The one who wants my life is not someone of the Purple Mansion Realm... but a Maha."

Li Yuanjiao frowned deeply, unable to hide his pain. Running his thumb along the Dragon Coiling Pillar sword at his waist, he asked in a low voice, "B-But... the Maha does not need an immortal foundation. What good does it do him to harm you, ancestor?"

Li Tongya took off the Qingche Sword, unwrapping the layers of cloth covering it. With a flick of his finger, the long sword extended a cun, its translucent green-white blade gleaming brightly, illuminating his eyes. His eyebrows arched, and his originally calm demeanor transformed, revealing a sinister, serpent dragon-like aura.

Gently gazing at the immortal sword of peak Foundation Establishment Realm, Li Tongya said, "Immortal cultivators consume qi, while Buddhist cultivators devour life. The Maha covets my Deep Ocean Whale Dragon Fate."




# Chapter 319: Leaving The Cave

"Fate..." Li Yuanjiao muttered to himself as Li Tongya sheathed his sword, fastening the Qingche Sword to his waist for the first time. With a serious expression, he said, "Yuanjiao... the family will need your care from now on. If I go and do not return, you must lower your head and endure for a while. With the Xiao Family supporting us, at worst, we can cede Mount Huazhong and Mount Yuting; it is of no great consequence."

Li Yuanjiao felt as though the sky was darkening and the world was collapsing around him. He said hoarsely, "Ancestor... the family... the family cannot do without you!"

Li Tongya slowly shook his head and spoke gently, "Xuanling is likely beyond saving, and Xuanfeng is stuck at the southern border. Let your father manage the marketplace; he should not come back and complicate matters..."

"You, Yuanxiu, and Yuanping are all capable of managing the family. You must be cautious... Qinghong is still in seclusion and does not need to be called out. She acts too hastily, pursuing immortality single-mindedly, which could lead to her downfall. Make sure she acts with caution!"

Seeing that Li Yuanjiao was listening attentively, Li Tongya nodded and advised, "Once this matter is settled, there should be many peaceful days ahead. After the death of the Yu Family's ancestor and the collapse of their marketplace, Yu Muxian, despite having many connections within the sect, remained passive and did not even utter a word. He doesn't seem to care much for his clan and is unlikely to offend the Xiao Family. You needn't worry about him."

"Yes... Jiao'er will keep your words in mind," Li Yuanjiao replied. His eyes shone brightly as he asked, "Ancestor, what about the Azure Pond Sect?"

At the mention of this name, Li Tongya's expression turned complex. He said softly, "The Azure Pond Sect has entrenched itself in Jiangnan for hundreds of years. Its background is far deeper than we can see, with intricate interests and ruthless methods of suppression and slaughter. It is not something that can be opposed in a single lifetime. Yuan Huyuan was right; we must climb onto the Azure Pond's table rather than fall into its bowl. However, my generation has an unresolvable blood feud with Azure Pond, making reconciliation impossible. After I am gone, you must send our descendants into the sect. Even if they become servants or sacrifices, it is the only way for the family to secure a future!"

Tears fell silently as Li Yuanjiao nodded. Li Tongya grasped his hand, his gray hair fluttering lightly in the wind. Then, with a somber tone, he continued, "Remember, do not perform blood sacrifices, do not massacre innocents, and do not indulge in evil desires..."

Beside him, Li Yuanping's eyes were already red, unable to control himself any longer. Li Tongya took his thin arm, and a glow of mana appeared in his hand, erasing the bruises on Li Yuanping's arm. Feeling somewhat guilty, he said, "If our family had any precious elixirs to mend your root bones, you would not have to suffer this way..."

"Waaah..." Li Yuanping could not hold back anymore and began to cry hoarsely. Li Yuanjiao bit his lip, holding back his tears as he stood.

Li Tongya looked into his eyes and said softly, "If Yuanyun proves to be useless, do not indulge him. If he dares to engage in any murderous blood sacrifices, kill him."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, a glimmer of understanding flashing across his eyes. Despite never having left the mountain, his granduncle seemed to know everything about the world below. Li Yuanping, stifling his sobs and looking up with a flush of excitement on his pale face, said solemnly, "Rest assured, Granduncle. As long as Yuanjiao and I are here, the family will not fall into chaos!"

Li Tongya nodded approvingly then stood up, and with a hearty laugh, said, "Do not be too pessimistic. Though this journey is fraught with danger, there is also a chance of survival."

Adjusting the storage pouch at his waist, Li Tongya took out a pale blue jade box and handed it to Li Yuanjiao solemnly. Li Yuanjiao received it with both hands, and Li Tongya instructed, "This is the Sword Immortal's legacy—the Law of Celestial Moon, a Grade Five sword technique."

"The Sword Immortal's legacy?!"

Both brothers were astonished. Li Yuanjiao's legs went weak, holding the jade box carefully, as if fearing it might melt in his hands. He bowed respectfully and said in a deep voice, "Yuanjiao accepts the task!"

Li Yuanjiao understood that by entrusting him with this legacy, Li Tongya was passing on the responsibility of the Li Family to him. Feeling both terrified and uneasy, he watched as Li Tongya pointed at the jade box, flicked his finger, and retrieved two jade slips—one pale purple and one pure white.

Li Tongya explained, "The pale purple one is the Law of Celestial Moon. The pure white one contains my sixty years of swordsmanship notes on this manual, called the Law of Sexagenary Cycle Sword Manual. Keep them well and do not take them outside the mountain."

Li Yuanjiao nodded repeatedly. Li Tongya continued, "This jade box is also no ordinary item. It contains great space within and can store Purple Mansion Realm treasures."

Without saying any more, he took out most of the items from his storage pouch, leaving only a few healing and qi-replenishing pills. He nodded and finally said, "I'll be off now."

The two brothers quickly stood up and bowed in unison, saying respectfully, "Take care, Ancestor!"

A gentle breeze passed by, and when the two brothers straightened up, Li Tongya's figure was already gone from the courtyard. Li Yuanjiao hurriedly collected the items on the table, wiped his eyes, and walked back to the desk. Picking up a brush, he said solemnly, "I'll quickly write a letter to notify Father! If anything happens to the ancestor, we must keep a low profile in the marketplace!"

While the two brothers were busily making arrangements at the top of Mount Lijing, Li Tongya descended the mountain but did not immediately leave. He concealed his presence and descended the steps, making his way to the mountain's cemetery. Early morning dew covered everything in sight, moss on the stones was lush and green, and a light mist lingered, creating a tranquil and picturesque scene.

He wiped the tombstones of his brothers and then picked up a piece of rock. Using his finger as a chisel, he carved a stone tablet in just a few breaths. Li Tongya placed this tablet in a reserved spot and let sword aura flow from his fingers, delicately engraving patterns on the stone.

All of his brothers' tombstones had been erected by him. He initially intended to carve his own as well but, after thinking it over, waved off the sword aura and laughed self-deprecatingly.

"Erecting a tombstone for myself is quite a gloomy task... Better leave it for future generations..." he said.

With that, he took to the wind again, drifting northward.

————

On the banks of the great river...

An old man quietly untangled a mass of nets on a large rock. Li Xuanling had headed north several days ago, but the old man was not worried about him secretly fleeing. He continued to silently pull at his fishing net by the riverbank.

"The serpent dragon has emerged from its cave."

A man dressed in hemp clothes leisurely approached from below, carrying a white jade fishing rod on his shoulder. He stopped beside the old man and said gently, "Senior Si, it is time for us to leave as well!"

The old man glanced at him but did not respond to his words. Instead, he smiled and said, "The dark clouds are gathering... Xiao Xianyou is quite the meticulous planner. Everything has been prepared for you, and even the timing is impeccable. One cannot help but be impressed!"

Xiao Chuting looked at him deeply without speaking, then silently sat down to wait. The old man sighed and said, "If Xiao Xianyou had not been harmed by Chi Wei, he would have been a Golden Core seed."

Upon hearing this, Xiao Chuting finally spoke. "Senior, you jest. I heard that a Molten Metal Cave has emerged within your sect. That's quite rare. What made you decide to meddle with the Dao lineage of the Central Plains?"

"Nothing of the sort, just an external disciple." The Purple Mansion Realm elder surnamed Si shook his head nonchalantly and said, "A young fellow in the sect managed to cultivate it. The Dao Partners of Molten Metal Cave have been completely lost. Even if he succeeded, he would only reach early-stage Purple Mansion Realm, cut off from further progress. You need not be concerned."

Before long, radiant lights began to emerge by the riverbank. Various Purple Mansion Realm cultivators appeared one by one, some elegant and ethereal, others with sharp gazes and shimmering with divine light. A total of seven beams of light descended. Only then did the old man stand up shakily and say softly, "Since everyone is here, let us proceed together!"




# Chapter 320: Meeting In The Temple

The evening wind swirled through the courtyard, causing leaves and grass to flutter around. The dim candlelight flickered unsteadily. In the courtyard sat a middle-aged woman, not particularly striking in appearance but exuding a sense of grace. She leaned against the stone table.

The servant below her bowed and kneeled, trembling as he said, "We asked the young master... He said the climate in Eastern Mount Yue is pleasant and he does not wish to return."

Lu Wanrong shook her head helplessly and sighed softly, saying gently, "I know what he's thinking... He's seeking shamanic spells in Eastern Mount Yue... trying to open his spiritual orifice. With his father still not returned, I cannot persuade him."

Li Xuanling had only one wife and never took concubines. She bore him two children, each with a different personality. The elder daughter, Li Qinghong, was bright and high-spirited and had reached the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. In contrast, his younger son, Li Yuanyun, who lacked a spiritual orifice, was unremarkable and increasingly sullen.

Lu Wanrong had noticed the changes in Li Yuanyun with growing anxiety, and she had even mentioned it to Li Xuanling several times. Each time the subject of their son was raised, Li Xuanling would just say to let him be, as long as he did not harm anyone...

She had always been a perceptive woman and sensed an inexplicable guilt in her husband who was always lenient with Li Yuanyun, leaving her at a loss on what to do.

Even when she had carried Yuanyun up the mountain years ago, she had trembled, unable to lift her head in Li Tongya's imposing presence. However, the children of the Xuan generation—whether it was Li Xuanfeng or Li Xuanxuan—had always treated Li Yuanyun exceptionally well.

"Perhaps I am overthinking it," Lu Wanrong said as she shook her head to dispel the thought and asked solemnly, "Any news from the marketplace?"

"Yes, Madam... They said that there's still no word of the Third Master," the servant reported.

Lu Wanrong, now nearly forty, had limited talent, only reaching the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Unable to match her husband's progress and constrained by her surname, she had always kept a low profile and refrained from asserting authority. However, with Li Xuanling missing for three months, her composure was beginning to wane.

She tightened her grip on the jade cup, her brow furrowed with worry, and said solemnly, "Three full months without any news... My husband has always been cautious; something must have happened... What is the response from the mountain?"

The servant fell to her knees with a thud and said in a low voice, "Madam, Mount Lijing has been completely sealed off. We humble servants are not allowed to meet the young master."

Lu Wanrong's heart skipped a beat as a deep sense of unease rose within her. She quickly fetched brush and ink, writing urgently while murmuring, "No, something is definitely wrong. I must ask Qinghong about this."

————

Li Xuanling crossed the river again, weaving through the sea of clouds. After asking several people for directions, he confirmed the direction of Mount Luoxia and leisurely rode the wind, occasionally descending to walk. The journey was peaceful and uneventful.

This route followed the borders of the Xu State, where Daoist temples were still predominant. Li Xuanling checked his bearings, meandering along, and eventually found himself near Mount Bianyan. This area now marked the border between the Yue Cultivating Sect and the Golden Tang Gate. The once desolate land now sprouted green vegetable shoots, looking quite pleasant in the misty rain. There were even travelers on the road, adding a lively touch to the scene.

"The Yue Cultivating Sect is indeed the most righteous among the three sects, which is truly rare..."

The Yue Cultivating Sect was one of the few among the three sects and seven gates that upheld the immortal mansion's original philosophy of seclusion and ascension. Most of its disciples cultivated on the mountain and rarely ventured into the secular world, resulting in few renowned cultivators. Aside from the highly esteemed Daoist Master Shangyuan, reputed to be the strongest below the Golden Core Realm, the rest of the Yue Cultivating Sect's members were virtually unknown.

"Mount Bianyan... There seems to be a Daoist temple here. Back then, the temple was forced by a demon to collect children for sacrifice. I wonder how it is now..."

Under the Yue Cultivating Sect's governance, conflicts between Dao lineages were strictly forbidden. Numerous small Daoist temples and clans were established, and though there were still conspiracies, secret betrayals, annexations, and murders, competition here was much milder compared to other regions.

Li Xuanling wandered around for a while. Watching the mountain mist and drizzle, he recalled the Daoist temple he had stumbled upon when he came to exterminate the demon years ago. He thought to himself, The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator asked me to go to Mount Luoxia but didn't give a specific time...

Li Xuanling was not afraid of death and had long accepted this arrangement. However, he still wished to live a few more days and see more of the world. He pondered, After traveling by wind, my mana is somewhat depleted. I might as well check out this small temple and rest for a while before continuing north.

Thus, he descended. The world was peaceful now. The small temple, once hidden by an illusion formation, was now openly visible. The stone statues on either side were imposing, dripping with rainwater that ran down their faces. Li Xuanling performed a hand seal, then knocked gently on the grayish-red wooden door adorned with peachwood talismans. With a smile, he said, "A wandering rogue cultivator is here to visit. May I request the host to open the door?"

Li Xuanling called out twice but received no response. Feeling a bit uneasy, he hesitated before raising his hand to knock again. Just then, the gray-red door creaked open slowly.

It opened on its own, allowing the morning breeze, fresh with rain, to flow into the hall. Li Xuanling stood silently, staring blankly at the scene inside.

The drizzle dampened the courtyard, accompanied by the cries of white cranes. Inside, the hall was dark, illuminated only by dim candles, and a strange mixture of incense and the scent of blood filled the air.

Dark blood flowed on the floor, reflecting specks of golden light. The solemn clay statues stood watch, but below them lay scattered bones. An old Daoist priest's headless corpse kneeled at the front, his white hair scattered and gently scattering in the wind.

In the center, the meditation cushion was buried under a pile of Daoist corpses, all stacked in layers. The eyes of the dead were wide open, yet there was no trace of resentment—only an odd sense of peacefulness.

Atop the mountain of corpses sat a monk, shirtless, who had defined, blood-red muscles. With his hands clasped in meditation and eyes closed, a golden mark glowed on his forehead.

The floor was covered in dismembered limbs and blood, hiding the gilded runes. Blood dripped from the soaked Daoist cloth, a dripping sound echoing as each drop fell onto the monk's near-perfect muscles. However, he remained still, unaware.

"Fahui..."

This was the monk who had fought Li Xuanling in Zhao State's Duanchen Village ten days ago for no reason. Now, drenched in blood, his aura fluctuated as he sat cross-legged atop the corpse mountain.

Fahui's ears twitched, his determined face covered in dried blood. His eyelids fluttered before slowly opening, his pupils ablaze with a golden-red fire. He stared silently at Li Xuanling below.

"Vile serpent! I have waited long for you!"




# Chapter 321: Struggle

Fahui stood up, looking down at Li Xuanling with a cold smile. His sharp white teeth gleamed and blood dripped from the intestines hanging from his body. He sneered coldly.

"Wretched beast, I chased you all the way and gradually awakened memories of my past life. I knew you would come to this small temple, so I waited here..."

"Wretched beast...?"

Li Xuanling, already frustrated from being forced north by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, was further offended by the monk's insult. All these emotions turned into a blazing fury, burning within him as he spat, "You keep calling me a wretched beast, a sinner... Look at the corpses under your feet! Why don't you open your eyes and take a good look at the blood on your body? You'll see who the real beast is!"

"Hahaha!"

Fahui laughed in a crazed rage as golden intricate patterns appeared on his body. He clasped his hands together, causing the blood and flesh on the ground to melt like red wax, transforming into a thin golden mist that spread throughout the courtyard.

"You were the black serpent I caught in my left hand. If you are not the wretched beast, then who is? I never thought you would escape to the south for decades, acting all high and mighty... Now that I am about to reclaim my Maha status, you shall complete my path."

Before he had even finished speaking, his body shot forward like a cannonball, his fist aimed directly at Li Xuanling's face. Li Xuanling placed his left hand on his sword. The Celestial Moon Slash technique had been gathering power for a long time, and he drew it out, unleashing a white sword light that illuminated the hall brilliantly.

Clang!

Fahui caught the sword light with his bare hands, which glowed with a golden radiance, and crushed it into fragments between his palms. His inhuman eyes, shimmering with a golden hue, followed Li Xuanling as he pulled back. Laughing, he said, "As for the Daoists in this temple... the fact that they got killed by me is proof that their sins were indeed too great."

"You!" Li Xuanling was momentarily stunned by his words, then sneered, dismissing them.

Fahui raised an eyebrow and said angrily, "You do not believe me?"

His strong arm slowly rose, causing the golden mist on the ground to swirl like serpent dragons and converge into a radiant golden light in his palm. Within this light, various scenes materialized.

A wolf demon of the Foundation Establishment Realm appeared, riding the wind and enveloped in black mist, with demonic qi swirling around it. The wolf demon devoured the temple master, forcing the old Daoist to gather infants for its consumption. The light revealed a harrowing sequence of crying infants and grieving Daoists, one scene after another.

Li Xuanling knew these Daoists had committed misdeeds, but he understood the circumstances and was not easily swayed. He sneered, "Offering infants was a desperate measure. If they hadn't done it, the wolf demon would have devoured all the villagers. It was a lesser evil. How can you judge so easily?"

"Judge?"

The temple roof had been pierced through, allowing the drizzle to fall through. The dim sunlight filtered through the thick rain clouds, casting a pale light on half of Fahui's face. His eyes shone gold as he solemnly said, "Evil is evil. Evil must be punished, no matter the excuse. Everyone in this world faces difficulties, but that cannot be used to justify evil deeds. This group deserves to be killed!"

"Once I have eradicated all evil, the world shall be pure again."

With that, he leaped forward, his palms glowing with golden light. Li Xuanling was momentarily speechless, and the golden light in the temple grew even more intense. He felt dizzy, his mind overwhelmed with anger and irritation. As he clashed with Fahui several times, his hand ached from the impact, leaving him in a difficult position.

"Hah!"

Fahui's fists were powerful and relentless, each strike fiercer than the last, far beyond what an ordinary monk without mana should possess.

Li Xuanling felt increasingly desperate, thinking to himself, They must want me to die by his hands to complete this person's destiny. A Maha reincarnate, huh...? My death shouldn't be a huge impact but the Li Family must rely on Father to survive...

At that moment, the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed in Li Xuanling's Shenyang Mansion suddenly activated, releasing a stream of cool energy that swirled through his mind.

His mind cleared instantly as if he had eaten a large piece of ice on a scorching summer day. His previously faltering defense stabilized, and Li Xuanling's spirits lifted. He heard a calm, gentle voice in his ear. "Remain calm and hold out for the duration of an incense stick."

Li Xuanling now realized that the previous illusions were all due to Fahui's spell, which was strange and hard to defend against. Someone had intervened to dispel his spell, filling him with both joy and doubt as he thought quietly to himself, Who could it be... Xiao Chuting? But it doesn't sound like him...

————

Under the dark and somber mist, the mountain was desolate, with moon-white buildings scattered throughout. On the uppermost platform, fallen leaves landed on the jade-like table.

"Fate..."

Lu Jiangxian sat before the jade-like table, holding a thin, pure white thread in his hand that extended into the boundless void, swaying gently. In his other hand, he held a silver glow that floated up and down as if it was alive, exuding a mystical aura.

"When I bestowed the Deep Ocean Long Whale Talisman on Li Tongya, this Maha has long locked onto Li Tongya from afar and began his plans... The Wrathful Maha has cultivated for nine lifetimes, gathering various fates, and in this life, he intends to kill Li Tongya to achieve enlightenment... The southern Purple Mansion Realm and Golden Core Realm cultivators are scheming against each other, using divine abilities to protect Li Tongya, using him as bait to kill this Maha..."

Lu Jiangxian frowned slowly, feeling puzzled, "What exactly is the relationship between talisman qi and fate? Everyone receives different talismans. Is it because the talisman qi manifests their fate, or does it bestow a certain fate?"

As he pondered this, Lu Jiangxian suddenly had a moment of clarity.

"Li Tongya is bait, not a sacrifice. If managed properly, he may not necessarily die... As long as he can hold out until the Wrathful Maha fully awakens in Fahui, and the Purple Mansion Realms intervene, he can survive..."

Lu Jiangxian had not yet recovered his strength to the point of contending with Purple Mansion Realms or Mahas, nor the Golden Core Realms or Dharma Masters, but he was no longer the confused and powerless novice he once was. Though cautious, he refused to sit idly by and watch Li Tongya be used as a pawn.

"Even if I cannot intervene directly, I will not let others manipulate us..."

He carefully considered, "Back then, both Minghui and Maha Jinlian were powerless against the mirror. This proves that the mirror has a high inherent rank, likely at the level of an immortal... As long as this matter does not involve an immortal, I can make a move without risking being detected."

Lu Jiangxian activated the power of deduction he had obtained from Liu Changdie. The silver light shrank by a third and then formed a single word—Auspicious.

"Not bad."

Although it was already a scheme among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Mahas, Lu Jiangxian felt more at ease now that he had done a reading. The thread in his hand shimmered with white light as he set a limit for himself.

"I will only act through the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed as a medium. This way, even if those Purple Mansion Realm cultivators go crazy and capture Li Xuanling or Li Tongya, they won't detect anything!"

The Profound Pearl Talisman Seed was one of the roots of the mirror. Even an immortal might not notice it. If not for this, Li Chejing and Li Tongya would have been captured long ago by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

After considering every detail, Lu Jiangxian was confident that nothing could go wrong. A slight smile appeared on his lips as he murmured, "I will play along with these people for now, treating it as gaining experience! After all, I have been benefiting from their incense and sacrifices year after year, so it is time to repay them!"




# Chapter 322: A Stick Of Incense

Having now made up his mind, Lu Jiangxian gently tugged at the thin thread in the void, which reflected dazzling white light. He murmured, "Li Xuanling is at Mount Bianyan... Li Tongya is on his way north..."

He performed a hand seal, and Li Tongya, though far away, immediately sensed something. Without a word, he changed direction and flew swiftly toward Mount Bianyan. Lu Jiangxian watched the father and son silently, feeling inexplicably conflicted.

Li Xuanling is destined to die. Only by killing Li Xuanling and becoming a Master Monk can the Wrathful Maha begin to merge with Fahui's body. According to the plans of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, Fahui is supposed to head north after Li Xuanling's death, with Li Tongya in pursuit...

However, the longer this drags on, the more Fahui and the Wrathful Maha will merge, and with his full strength, Li Tongya's chances of survival will decrease. The further north they go, the more they will slip out of my sight... It is best if Li Xuanling can hold out a bit longer. If Fahui breaks through before then, Li Tongya will have a better chance of confronting him at Mount Bianyan.

As he pondered deeply, the void suddenly flickered. Lu Jiangxian quickly raised his hand, staring intently into the void where he saw an intertwined web of threads. He gently touched one with his finger and said softly, "Remain calm and hold out for the duration of an incense stick."

With that, he fully activated his mana, focusing on the thin threads in the void, deducing silently.

————

Clang!

Li Xuanling drew his sword to block Fahui's iron fist, producing a screeching metallic sound. He retreated a few steps, the sword qi scattering and leaving the large pillar beside him riddled with holes. Drenched in sweat, Li Xuanling felt a searing pain in his internal organs and was unable to suppress a mouthful of blood that spilled from his lips.

Sss... sss...

The blood didn't even reach the ground before it turned into a cloud of golden mist, merging with the golden haze drifting in the courtyard. Fahui raised his muscular arm and unleashed a barrage of punches against Li Xuanling's mana shield.

With the cool stream enhancing his clarity, Li Xuanling's mind was no longer clouded by Fahui's spell. He immediately prepared to ride the wind, thinking to himself, Although I cannot escape, I can hold out longer from a higher position...

However, the golden mist clung to his shield like maggots to a bone, weighing him down. He felt as if his body was burdened with heavy iron, making him unable to rise more than a chi off the ground. Seizing the opportunity, Fahui leaped forward and struck him down with a single, powerful palm strike.

Boom!

Li Xuanling crashed into the temple wall, his body covered in dust. Fahui chuckled darkly as he stepped forward, sneering. "Once I've killed you, I will break through to become a Master Monk. Then I'll seek out your Deep Ocean Whale Dragon father and kill him to become a Merciful One... With that, I'll complete my path to Maha!"

"Path to Maha..."

Struck down and with his internal organs impacted, Li Xuanling felt his condensed mana scatter. Though exhausted, he gritted his teeth upon hearing Fahui's words, mustering newfound strength. He reached into his storage pouch at his waist and flicked out five talismans.

Thanks to Li Xuanxuan's tireless work on talismans, Li Xuanling had several at his disposal. Two were of the peak Embryonic Breathing Realm and three of the early-stage Qi Cultivation Realm. They transformed into flames, icy rain, lightning, and poisonous fog, all exploding onto Fahui's body.

Though his memories were awakening, Fahui only recalled fragments and had little experience in fighting cultivators. He raised a golden light shield hastily to block the incoming attack.

The two peak Embryonic Breathing Realm talismans were manageable, but the early-stage Qi Cultivation Realm talismans hit him squarely, exploding on his gold-patterned body and forcing him back a step.

Li Xuanling was also shaken by the residual energy. His face paled even more as he spat out a mouthful of blood again.

Fortunately, Fahui had been momentarily forced back. Seizing the opportunity, Li Xuanling rolled to his feet, pulling away and gaining a few precious seconds.

Fahui brushed off the dust from his body, staring straight at Li Xuanling with a smile. "You are much stronger than these Daoists. I guess this is the difference between Unrefined Qi Cultivators and true Qi Cultivators... Even among us Buddhist cultivators, such distinctions exist. A simple exchange of blows reveals whether one possesses the true path."

Li Xuanling paid no attention to the monk's rambling, his mind racing only with the thought of delaying the monk as long as possible. He shouted, "I do know something! The true path of Buddhist cultivators lies in the land of bliss... As for someone like you, who kills indiscriminately, you are not following the true path!"

As expected, these words stunned the monk for several seconds. He stared at Li Xuanling with a smirk, performing a hand seal as he replied coldly, "I see, you've already met Murong Xia!"

Without waiting for an answer, Fahui nodded to himself, the intricate golden patterns on his body now glowing with more intensity. With a single step, he crossed a big distance and grabbed Li Xuanling by the neck.

"Good! Let me ask you, why should everyone, regardless of age, sin, or virtue, enjoy his paradise? The wicked should suffer all kinds of punishments and die in agony... Only the virtuous deserve to be consumed by us. Do you agree or not?!" he roared.

His eyes glowed fiercely with golden light, and his skin emitted a bronze-yellow radiance. His hands, brimming with destructive mana and a hint of confinement, produced golden runes that bound Li Xuanling tightly.

Li Xuanling's face turned red, but as a Qi Cultivator, he would not suffocate immediately. He managed to open his mouth slightly and mock, "What a notion... only the virtuous deserve to be consumed by you?"

Fahui's rage intensified, finding Li Xuanling's answer unacceptable. He gritted his teeth and roared, "You ingrate!"

Fahui suddenly lifted his hand and threw Li Xuanling with all his might. Li Xuanling shot out like a cannonball, smashing into the roof of the great hall. The structure, already damaged from their fierce battle, gave way instantly, collapsing in on itself.

Boom—!

Gray-white dust rose abruptly, and broken tiles and wood fragments fell like torrential rain. The dimly-lit hall finally crumbled. Debris was scattered everywhere, and Li Xuanling lay on the steps leading to the hall, his bones shattered and his body limp like a noodle.

One of the two imposing statues at the entrance was shattered into pieces, while the other had its limbs broken, leaving only a solitary head. Rainwater dripped from the smooth stone face, mixing into the faintly blood-red puddles below.

The signboard, which had been precariously hanging from the roof covered by tattered cloth, finally fell with a clatter, landing before him. The cloth fluttered away in the wind, revealing gilded characters—Zhenhui Temple.

The golden characters blazed like the sun, glaring into his eyes. Li Xuanling's cheek split open, and his ragged mouth twisted into an ugly smile as he whispered weakly into nothingness.

"It's been... a stick of incense."




# Chapter 323: Arrival

The cold wind was fierce, and the rain poured down relentlessly. Between heaven and earth, the rain and mist were oppressive, and the thunder hidden within the dark clouds rumbled deeply.

Li Tongya traveled through the wind like a meteor streaking across the sky. Below him, the mountains and forests swayed incessantly in the heavy rain, leaves scattering everywhere. His expression was impassive as he moved through the rain, which gathered around him and transformed into a dozen pale green small serpent dragons that swirled around him, drawn by his Boundless Ocean immortal foundation.

"Mount Bianyan."

He gazed into the distance, his narrowed eyes filled with a gloomy light. The scenery before him flickered and the undulating mountains resembled a cunning viper, twisting and turning. Li Tongya, who had achieved Foundation Establishment Realm over a decade ago, was always calm and clear-headed. However, after flying for just half a day, he now felt muddle-headed and drowsy.

Although he was only a few hundred li away from Mount Bianyan, Li Tongya's speed began slowing. The path before him split into dozens of trails, and he suppressed his anger, thinking to himself, I wonder how many Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities have clashed over the hundreds of li I've flown...

As he struggled to maintain his focus, the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed in his qihai acupoint suddenly shone brightly, and a cool stream of energy flowed from his Shenyang Mansion, clearing his mind.

"This is..."

Li Tongya's drowsiness and distractions were instantly swept away, filling him with joy instead. He sensed the direction of Mount Bianyan and decisively closed his eyes, withdrawing his spiritual sense as he flew straight on ahead.

The mists of Mount Bianyan, perpetually present throughout the year, interwove in the mountains. Now, with the rain clearing the heavens and earth, the scene appeared even more desolate. Trusting his instincts, Li Tongya landed in the mountains. He slowly opened his eyes, then extended his spiritual sense.

Before him lay ruins, the rain splashing recklessly and stirring up droplets of pale red blood. A signboard hung in front of him, broken into three pieces. Despite this, its gilded characters remained glaringly visible.

Zhenhui Temple.

————

In the void beyond Li Tongya's sight, nine beams of light stood suspended in mid-air, each with its own distinct characteristics—some as heavy as mountains, some fluctuating, and others full of vitality. The light of their divine abilities interwove, each pulling the situation in different directions. As these divine abilities clashed together, distortions were created in the void.

As Li Tongya neared Mount Bianyan, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators continuously performed hand seals, until finally, one of them could no longer take it. He stood with hands behind his back and sneered. "It's understandable that everyone wants a share of the metallic essence and fate. However, if something goes wrong and that little snake survives, and the Wrathful Maha realizes something is amiss and reincarnates elsewhere, none of us can bear the consequences!"
𝒻𝘳ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝒷𝘯ℴ𝓋ℯ𝘭.𝑐ℴ𝑚

As soon as he spoke, another Purple Mansion Realm cultivator laughed mockingly. "Ha, Changxi, it seems you have not managed to cultivate your Life Divine Ability and can only watch on enviously... Do not let it frustrate you into speaking nonsense!"

"You!"

Daoist Master Changxi clearly did not get along with this Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. However, having reached the Purple Mansion Realm, none were fools, and he was not easily angered.[1]

He feigned mild anger and fell silent, but the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivator persisted, laughing. "Daoist Chuting attained the Dao through his Life Divine Ability and began developing a second immortal foundation in less than fifty years after his breakthrough... You, having cultivated for a hundred years at the early stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, cannot even compare to a junior. How pathetic."

Daoist Master Changxi merely laughed, replying, "Daoist Chuting is indeed exceptionally talented. I naturally cannot compare. But with important matters at hand, I will not argue with you. Keep an eye on your Guoling Peak so it doesn't end up sinking into the sea."

"Ha... When Duanmu Kui was alive, he was as docile as a quail. Now that he is gone, you have come out to stir trouble..." the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivator mocked.

Daoist Master Changxi merely glanced at him coldly and replied, "If you practiced Fool's Mountain Chase

and heard that the Emperor's Mandate

was destroyed, you'd be terrified enough to disperse your cultivation and start over too."

"Haha." The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator laughed, seemingly agreeing, and finally fell silent.

The others watched silently until a clear voice suddenly said, "Fellow Daoists, he is flying too fast."

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators continued performing hand seals silently, but some nodded and released their spells. To their surprise, Li Tongya was not only unaffected but paused, closing his eyes for a moment before flying straight toward Mount Bianyan. The clear voice appeared again. "Daoist Chuting! Withdraw your divine ability!"

These cultivators, having attained the Purple Mansion Realm, were all exceptionally perceptive. They immediately understood who would benefit from this and thus who was responsible.

All eyes turned to Xiao Chuting.

Dressed in a white robe and carrying a white jade fishing rod, surrounded by pale blue divine light, he stood motionless, though inwardly alarmed.

I have already withdrawn my divine ability... It was not me! It must be someone else... Could it be the one from Mount Dali or the Yue Cultivating Sect..?

Xiao Chuting scanned his surroundings, his deep thoughts racing. Finding himself inexplicably the target of suspicion, he remained calm and immediately saw an opportunity to claim greater influence. He said gently, "It was a senior who acted, not me."

The other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were momentarily stunned, exchanging looks of surprise and doubt. Someone murmured, "Who in Jiangnan could be so domineering to render our efforts useless? It cannot possibly be Daoist Shangyuan, can it?"

"Shangyuan is a sword immortal, not a shaman immortal. How could it be him? Besides, the Yue Cultivating Sect has always been proudly aloof, why would they intervene in such matters?"

Watching Li Tongya fly straight toward Mount Bianyan, one Purple Mansion Realm cultivator quickly deduced with his fingers and murmured, "At this speed, the timing seems just right. As soon as the Wrathful Maha devours the little snake, the big snake will arrive just in time at this temple."

"So, we will have to fight him in this temple?"

While the two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were talking, the clear voice, evidently of higher status, interrupted and asked softly, "Daoist Chuting... can you tell us which senior acted?"

Xiao Chuting smiled faintly and replied, "Daoist Tianyuan... I really cannot say."

Xiao Chuting's ambiguous answer caused a moment of awkward silence among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Then, someone spoke to ease the tension, saying with a laugh, "As long as the Wrathful Maha possesses the body, it is enough. We do not need to hope for more... After all, moving through the void to manipulate fate is exhausting. It is fine if it is in this temple. We need not wait any longer. Let us eliminate the Maha quickly and return to our duties..."

"Agreed."

With this, several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators voiced their agreement.

One even smiled wryly, saying, "We who have just reached the Purple Mansion Realm cannot roam the void as long as the senior cultivators... We risk losing our divine abilities and cultivation if the Wrathful Maha escapes."

Upon hearing this, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators looked silently toward Daoist Master Tianyuan. After a brief pause, the clear voice replied, "Very well."

The void fell silent. The clear voice spoke no more, and the nine beams of light quietly watched Mount Bianyan below, waiting for the right moment.

1. Changxi is from the Profound Peak Gate, one of the Daoist Masters of the Azure Pond Sect. He had briefly appeared in C247 to attend a banquet at Xiao Residence. ☜




# Chapter 324: Subduing the Serpent

Li Xuanling was dead.

The torrential rain continued to pour on heavily, washing away the blood that flowed everywhere. Crows cawed mournfully in the downpour, and the signboard of Zhenhui Temple lay shattered in three pieces on the ground, scattered haphazardly.

Fahui kneeled on the ground, his muscles sleek and defined like a tiger's under the rain. He propped Li Xuanling up, inhaling deeply about three cun away from him. The golden runes in his palm lit up one by one, while Li Xuanling lay motionless in his arm.

Fahui exhaled deeply, invoking his secret technique. His eyes glowed with golden light, ready to devour Li Xuanling's fate.

"The ninth... the ninth... the ninth Maha Reincarnate."

As Fahui inhaled, Li Xuanling's fate and cultivation surged forth. However, the domineering Profound Pearl Talisman Seed in Li Xuanling's qihai acupoint was ready to siphon away his fate and cultivation, unwilling to yield them.

The Profound Pearl Talisman Seed resisted fiercely, fighting to take Li Xuanling's fate and cultivation away. Fahui, being merely a Maha Reincarnate, naturally could not compete with it. Despite his spell, it seemed he would end up empty-handed.

"This is bad!"

Fortunately, Lu Jiangxian had been closely monitoring the situation. From thousands of li away, he formed a hand seal, controlling the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed which buzzed loudly, dispersing the cultivation and fate into the void.

If Fahui could not extract Li Xuanling's fate under the watchful eyes of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, it would be a glaring flaw. Lu Jiangxian quickly took control of the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed, allowing it to release Li Xuanling's fate and cultivation. He also erased any memory of the mirror from Li Xuanling to prevent any mishaps before retreating back into the mirror.

"Damn it..." Lu Jiangxian cursed, upset about losing the talisman seed he had nurtured for decades. Though the Qi Cultivation Realm seed was no longer of much use to him, it was still a small loss.

"You guys can have the Qi Cultivation but don't even think about taking Li Tongya's...!" he muttered inwardly.

Fahui cheered triumphantly as fresh, invigorating white ribbons finally appeared in the void. He inhaled all of them deeply, like mist and smoke. A sweet, spring-like taste lingered on his tongue, and warmth began to spread through his limbs.

"I have attained the Dharma!"

Brilliant rays of light appeared behind his head, and the bronze markings on his body deepened. His eyes shone brightly like two lone pearls in the dim rain.

Plop.

As Fahui rode the wind, he released his grip, letting Li Xuanling's body fall back to the ground with a dull thud. His eyes were wide open, staring at the sky. A gray-robed figure slowly grew larger in their reflection, descending quickly in front of the temple.

Swoosh...

Gray, ordinary cloth shoes stepped into the rain puddles. The pale red water receded quickly to make way. The dark gray robe fluttered lightly in the wind as Li Tongya stopped in his tracks.

"Ling'er..."

With interventions from various Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and Lu Jiangxian guiding from afar, compromises and restraints aligned perfectly for Li Tongya to arrive just in time to see his eldest son die before his eyes.

Li Tongya's gray beard fluttered gently in the wind, his expression slightly dazed. His right hand pressed down on the hilt of his sword. The rainwater at his feet surged continuously, climbing up his robe.

"Whale Dragon? You arrived so quickly."

Fahui glanced at him with his golden eyes, feeling an itch in his throat. He could not help but cough violently, the world spinning around him as he coughed and laughed, eventually spitting out two sharp, white teeth.

Before the teeth hit the ground, they rapidly darkened to amber gold and transformed into two short rods, each covered in intricate patterns. They struck the ground with a resounding thud, creating two large, cracked pits.

"Hahaha!"

Fahui picked up the two short rods, wiped the blood off them, and held one in each hand. He laughed and said, "I wonder why you even bother to come... Was it not you who made sure he died at my hands?"

Li Tongya remained silent, the torrential rain forming two pale blue serpent dragons beside him. The old man stared silently at the monk before him, but Fahui did not flinch and met his gaze calmly.

"You know I am going to devour you. You also knew that I would use your kin to lure you out..."

Anger rose in Fahui's golden eyes as the patterns on the short rods began to glow. His voice turned boundless like the ocean waves as he said, "But you did not know who I would use to lure you... So, you deliberately sent Li Xuanling north, sacrificing your own son... It is fate that I let me devour him, allowing me to break through to a Master Monk. But I should thank you too!"

Fahui saw a flash of anger and guilt cross Li Tongya's face, which dispelled his lingering doubts. He laughed and continued, "I do not know where you got your information to arrive so quickly. Fortunately, I had prepared for this in my previous life and set up a divine ability to delay you. Otherwise, you would have interrupted my achievement in this life..."

He added, "You are quite bold indeed, knowing a Maha has targeted you, yet using your own son to bait me. But caught in my divine ability, you arrived too late. The regret must be unbearable!"

As Fahui and the Wrathful Maha merged more closely, his eyes shone with brilliant golden light. He continued to speak, trying to buy more time, when suddenly a white light illuminated the mountains.

Li Tongya drew his sword.

The green and white Qingche Sword shot out, releasing a massive white sword aura as large as a sail which roared through the air. The surroundings were instantly bathed in white—shattered statues, temple ruins, and rain puddles on the stone slabs, they were all enveloped by the brilliant light.

"Good!" Fahui shouted angrily, rushing forward with weapons in hand. The golden patterns on his body glowed intensely, intertwining along the lines of his well-defined muscles. A burst of golden light clashed with the white light between the heavens and earth.

Unexpectedly, the white sword light was extraordinarily agile. It pulsated, feinting under Fahui and then weaving up his arm, landing lightly.

Clang!

The Law of Celestial Moon was known for its ferocity from the outset, and unleashed by the Qingche Sword, it shone brilliantly. Another burst of gold light appeared as Fahui's left arm was swiftly severed. He raised an eyebrow and smiled. "So, this is a sword essence... Good!"

Despite his words, Fahui's remaining right hand reached for the severed left arm. Suddenly, three streams of white light emerged, floating up and down, aiming for his heart, brow, and abdomen.

Splat...!

Fahui had only just broken through to a Master Monk. Li Tongya's Qingche Sword unleashed the Celestial Moon Sword Essence. Each sword light was imbued with its own consciousness. Unable to contend, Fahui was pierced by the three streams of light, leaving small holes in his heart, brow, and abdomen.

"Strike!" Li Tongya yelled.

Before Fahui's body could fall, the overwhelming sword essence swept over him like a tsunami, cutting him up to pieces within moments.

"Li Tongya."

For a moment, the entire ruin was covered in white flesh. Fahui's face, now reduced to half, lay on the fallen puppet clay figure. His crimson lips moved up and down as he smiled and said, "Since I have taken Li Xuanling's fate, I must ask you a question."

Li Tongya's expression remained unchanged. The long sword in his hand shone with a crystalline pale green light. The scattered limbs on the ground did not bleed nor showed any internal organs. They were like dough, sticky and wriggling, growing hands and feet, all running around and sticking together.

The mouth, still lying between the puppet’s clay hands, continued to shout, "Why? When Jianixi advanced eastward, it was I who rescued Li Jingtian... I brought her deep into enemy territory among the Mount Yue tribes, serving as a slave and laborer. It was I who brought her out, preserving her purity and my own life, so that neither of us would be used as leverage or hostage..."

The half-face trembled, the red mouth opening and closing, revealing sharp white teeth as it emitted mournful cries. "In terms of intellect, how am I inferior to Li Xuanxuan? I am far superior to him! In talent and cultivation, Li Xuanxuan could not even compare to me!! So why?!"

The mouth moved up and down, not casting any divine abilities, nor using any curses or shamanic spells, yet it made Li Tongya's usually unmoved expression crack like an avalanche on a snowy mountain.

"Father! Why did he get to be the family head for twenty-eight years? Why did I have to marry the enemy's daughter, live in obscurity, and be sent to my death?"




# Chapter 325: Wrathful Form

Li Tongya held the sword in his left hand, pointing it diagonally toward the ground. The puddles on the stone bricks reflected the green and white glow, while the white flesh on the stones and broken tiles moved toward the center. The words from that mouth changed Li Tongya's previously calm expression into one of uneasy resentment.

The wriggling flesh had already formed Fahui's head. As the Wrathful Maha slowly possessed him, his features became more refined and handsome, his eyes deepening to a striking gold. His face smoothed out, and those intense golden eyes locked directly with Li Tongya's as he angrily said, "Avoidance! You are avoiding your guilt toward your father and brothers. You honored your deceased brother and elevated his orphan, but the cost falls on me to bear. Li Tongya! How am I at fault?"

"Silence!!"

Li Tongya's voice roared like thunder, his lips turning white and trembling slightly. The sword in his hand emitted a sharp, whistling sound, like the cry of a serpent dragon, causing all the insects and birds in Mount Bianyan to fall silent.

Buzz—

The azure-white sword light surged out, crystalline and transparent. Hundreds of sword qi leaped from Li Tongya's Qingche Sword, crashing down like a waterfall. The puppet clay figure instantly turned to ashes and the entire mountaintop shook violently.

Boom...!

The dazzling green and white sword aura flashed for five full breaths. The sweeping sword qi transformed the ruins into a mess of holes and further wreckage. The rainwater on the platform flowed backward, turning into a misty, pale white vapor, creating an ethereal scene.

"Hahahahaha!"

The rain continued pouring heavily, quickly filling the central pit with gray water. Fahui's white head was covered with numerous fresh red wounds, exposing dark golden bones beneath. His deep golden eyes, almost falling out of their sockets, still blazed with anger as he glared at Li Tongya.

"It is useless. The Wrathful Subduer of the Four Demon Emperors is returning from the void. You could shatter me before, but now you can only see my bones. Soon, you will not even be able to harm my flesh!"

Fahui's arms had already regrown, picking up his shoulders and head from the ground. He took a few tentative steps forward, looking quite horrifying indeed. The wounds on his face healed rapidly. He turned his head and smiled maniacally.

"Father... do you agree or not?"

Li Tongya watched him intently, the sword in his hand glowing with mana light, his eyes simmering with anger. Fahui saw that his spell had affected Li Tongya's mind, yet he showed no intention of fleeing.

With an angry smile, tears streamed from his eyes as he gritted his teeth, "You wanted me to watch over the younger generation, so I abandoned my cultivation to protect them. You wanted me to oversee the mines, so I left the immortal mountain for that barren place. After I finally achieved the Qi Cultivation Realm, you made me escort spirit goods, and in the end, you sent me to die! Mother cultivated for many years, and you never gave her extra resources. You gave them all to Li Xuanfeng and those from the generation of Yuan and Qing. The few pills and elixirs she used were provided by me and the Liu Family. When she was dying, you simply said that it was all right..."

Fahui's face had morphed into that of Li Xuanling, and his voice matched perfectly. His angry gaze compelled Li Tongya to avert his eyes slightly. The old man appeared dazed, the sword in his hand flickering as his once sharp gaze grew weak, yet he remained silent.

Seeing him silent, Fahui pulled his legs out of the ground, and picked up the two intricately patterned bronze rods. He boldly took a step forward, swinging them at Li Tongya.

Clang...!

The dark golden short rods that were covered in complex patterns lit up brilliantly with golden light. The green and white sword light collided with them, sparking fiercely. The halo behind Fahui's head grew more intense as they fought on. Li Tongya's sword clashed with him for a few moves, forcing Fahui to retreat half a step.

"Heh..."

The golden hue in Fahui's eyes intensified. His facial features constantly changed—from Li Xuanling to a bearded man, then to a young child, a middle-aged woman, and a naive girl. His face cycled through these nine visages continuously. Li Tongya, unsettled by the display, drew his sword defensively, his expression reflecting his mounting confusion.

Golden light reappeared all around him, wrapping around Fahui's body like long and thick ribbons. A resonant chant filled the air, solemn and majestic.

"Ha!"

Fahui's body was covered in dense golden patterns and his bronze-colored skin reflected the rainwater falling from the sky. His face kept shifting among nine visages, each marked by an expression of anger. The short rods in his hands radiated golden light as he swung them down fiercely at Li Tongya.

A Buddhist Master Monk was inherently stronger than a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. Furthermore, Fahui was a Maha Reincarnate. Now, awakened to his wrathful form, his aura was comparable to that of the Merciful One. When the short rods collided with the Qingche Sword, a harsh screeching sound filled the air. Li Tongya grunted as the impact sent him flying backward like an arrow through the rain, coming to a stop far away.

"Perfect timing, consuming you will restore my Maha status!"

The Wrathful Maha feared Li Tongya might escape, so he stamped heavily on the ground, instantly closing the distance between them. His golden arm swung out like a statue's, reaching out to grasp Li Tongya with five fingers.

Naturally, Li Tongya swung his Qingche Sword to block him while performing hand seals with his other hand. The Boundless Ocean within him surged, gathering the rainwater and forming blue serpent dragons that pounced on Fahui.

Screeeeech...!

The Wrathful Maha's fingers closed around Li Tongya's sword, emitting a piercing noise. The Qingche Sword, a top-quality Foundation Establishment Realm weapon, blazed with dazzlingly bright light.

"Jing Dragon King."

The Wrathful Maha, having lived for nine lives, recognized the Boundless Ocean by its ancient name. He chuckled, his deep golden eyes fixed on Li Tongya as he spoke in an otherworldly voice that resonated like the ocean waves.

"Your swordsmanship is passable, but your immortal spells are severely lacking!"

The Li Family, having only ascended to prominence over the past sixty years, relied solely on their mastery of swordsmanship and possessed no powerful spells. The Wrathful Maha released the sword and tore the serpent dragons apart. His golden ribbons sprang forth like snakes, swiftly wrapping around Li Tongya's body. With Li Tongya thus ensnared, the Wrathful Maha rained punches down on him relentlessly.

Bang, bang, bang...!

In just a few breaths, the Wrathful Maha had thrown a hundred punches. Li Tongya tried to defend and create distance, but the golden ribbons had already wrapped around his feet unforgivingly, binding him tightly.

Pfft.

Li Tongya endured a hundred punches delivered with the force of a Merciful One, his skin bursting open as his internal organs sustained severe damage. He spat out blood, drenching his entire body crimson, before collapsing limply to the ground.

"Your fate is sealed! I return to my place!" The Wrathful Maha laughed, his body radiating golden light. He punched Li Tongya's abdomen, his eyes blazing with light.

Grasping Li Tongya, he brought his face close to his and inhaled deeply. The golden runes in his palms lit up. The remaining whites of his eyes turned completely deep gold, and he burst into laughter, cackling wildly in a crazed manner.

"Gwaa... Hahaha... Hahaha."

The Wrathful Maha's laughter boomed, echoing between heaven and earth. In front of him, Li Tongya coughed, his face smeared with blood, yet a faint smile curled his lips as he let out a weak laugh in response.

The Wrathful Maha froze, the handsome smile stiffening on his face. Shock and anger surged within him. He slowly lifted his head and looked into the distance.

The torrential rain continued pouring down heavily, the world was dim and lightless. The puddles on the ground reflected the sky, where one by one, beams of light began to appear.

"One, two, three... seven, eight, nine."




# Chapter 326: Dharma Relic

Drip, drip.

The colorful lights of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators rose through the rain. Each Daoist Master held their dharma artifact, their expressions varied—some calm, some filled with pity, others complex. Their divine abilities interconnected seamlessly, leaving no gaps between them.

"Nine Daoist Masters..."

The Wrathful Maha glared with his golden eyes, attempting to activate his metallic essence discreetly, only to find that the void was intricately linked, with a grand formation already set up to prevent his escape. His heart was instantly filled with a mix of shock and fury.

"You... you all... plotted against me?"

The Wrathful Maha's handsome face twisted, his body heating up, steam rising from his being. His well-defined back glistened with sweat as his deep golden eyes stared angrily at the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.

With a twisted smile, he shouted in rage, "I see... I was too preoccupied to notice that something was amiss. You must have been planning this for a long time... No wonder... No wonder!"

The nine beams of colorful light each displayed different forms but stood firm, blocking his way without the slightest concession.

"Azure Pond Sect... Golden Feather Sect... Changxiao Gate... Purple Smoke Gate... Golden Tang Gate... Excellent! You are all here!" The Wrathful Maha roared maniacally, his voice causing the surrounding forest to bend and animals to bow. The oppressive aura thickened, his presence growing ever more powerful.

As the Wrathful Maha faced off against the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, Li Tongya kneeled on the ground. The overwhelming pressure forced him to stay low, crawling carefully and painfully slowly. Blood continued to pour from the wound in his abdomen, dripping steadily into the rainwater.

Hiss...

Li Tongya took a deep breath, performing a hand seal and using the last of his mana to form a water membrane, covering the gaping hole in his abdomen. Using the Qingche Sword for support, he inched toward Li Xuanling's remains.

"Ling'er..."

After the fierce battle, Li Xuanling's body was now in pieces with only his head remaining—eyes open. Li Tongya curled his body and cradled his son's head.

With blood-soaked hands, he reached for his waist, only to realize that his storage pouch had been lost in the fight. Throughout his frugal life, he had only used the most basic storage pouch, with no protective enchantments. Without his mana to shield it, the pouch had been torn to shreds by the immense power around them.

Fortunately, the pouch had contained only items of little value. Li Tongya struggled on the ground for a moment, taking deep breaths to restore his strength. He removed his long robe and wrapped it around Li Xuanling's head, tying it carefully to his waist.

Removed from Li Tongya's body, the robe quickly turned a reddish-brown, soaked by blood and rain. Glancing at the colorful lights above, a constant warning echoed in his mind—If you stay any longer, you will die!

He gritted his teeth, his entire body feeling as if it would tear apart at any moment now. Fortunately, the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed in his qihai acupoint provided a continuous stream of cool energy, keeping him conscious. Li Tongya performed a hand seal and shakily rose into the wind, flying only half a li before crashing into the forest like a falling star.

————

The situation in the sky grew increasingly tense as the colorful radiance of divine abilities shone brightly. The Wrathful Maha roared, his body expanding like an inflating balloon. His face became as large as a house and his eyes were like two lanterns, emitting a blazing golden light in the sky.

"Zhang Tianyuan! It is you, as I suspected... You are the one leading this. I have not seen you in nearly a hundred years. Let us see what divine abilities you have mastered!"

The central beam of light revealed a figure—a young man in a Daoist robe decorated with the eight trigrams. Handsome and exceptional in demeanor, he was the Daoist Master Tianyuan who had been leading the others. He glanced sideways at the wrathful golden figure above, and said calmly, "Wrathful Subduer of the Four Demon Emperors... Monk, you have already been consumed by the Wrathful Form and lost sight of yourself."

"Hmph!"

The Wrathful Maha's patterned short rods expanded along with him, transforming into two large bronze pillars. He swung them vigorously, deflecting two probing artifacts, and sneered defiantly. "As long as I can exorcize evil, what does it matter if I am consumed by the Wrathful Form? You all conspired with traitors from my sect to harm me, yet you underestimate my resolve... A ninth Maha Reincarnate is beyond your understanding!"

The extremely complicated golden patterns on the rods shone brightly. Daoist Master Tianyuan raised his hand, and a small black tortoise shell flew out from his sleeve, growing rapidly in the wind until it was as large as a house. Radiant with mana light, it met the bronze rods head-on.

Thud—!

Daoist Master Tianyuan's artifact blocked the Wrathful Maha's attack easily. He said gently, "Monk, you are just one step away from becoming a Dharma Master. Under normal circumstances, we could not defeat you... But now that you have been possessed by a reincarnate and lost your thread of fate, you are much weaker!"

"Weaker..?"

The Wrathful Maha's eyes gleamed even more brilliantly with gold, showing no fear as he looked around at the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. His immense voice thundered through the air.

"Ridiculous! Do you know what the Wrathful Subduer of the Four Demon Emperors truly is?"

The Wrathful Maha stomped heavily, making a swallowing motion. His teeth, large as human heads, gleamed sharply. Golden light spewed from his throat, scattering in the torrential rain, and transforming into various shapes upon landing.

They turned into monks wielding short rods, arhats entwined with serpent dragons, children, tigers, wolves, foxes, and snakes—all flying through the air and forming formations. The sky was filled with figures, all glaring angrily.

"So, you have mastered the Wrathful Form of Subduing Evil of the Heaven and Earth... It seems you are the closest to becoming a Dharma Master among the Buddhist cultivators. No wonder you are so confident!" Daoist Master Tianyuan praised, yet remained unafraid.

He smiled and continued, "In these centuries, I have not seen a more talented Buddhist cultivator than yourself. It is a pity your mind is filled with twisted ideas of purging worldly filth with wrathful fire, making you mad and wasting your talent. If only you were more reasonable and cooperative with the Seven Dao of Buddhism in the north, you would not have ended up like this..."

The Wrathful Maha, sensing Daoist Master Tianyuan's calm demeanor, felt a growing sense of unease. Speculation began forming in his heart. Daoist Master Tianyuan laughed as he clasped his hands together and performed a hand seal, saying, "I respectfully invite the dharma relic to appear!"

Clang...

As Diaost Master Tianyuan spoke, the clear and unmistakable sound of metal chains echoed through the sky. Black chains emerged from the void, stretching across the heavens, descending upon the Wrathful Maha. They interlinked and branched out, creating hundreds of offshoots, darkening the sky.

The Wrathful Maha finally showed fear, his golden patterns glowing brightly as he tried to evade the chains.

But the dharma relic was inescapable, binding him tightly. The Wrathful Maha screamed wildly, shouting in rage, "A dharma relic... It is a dharma relic... Which True Monarch is it?"




# Chapter 327: The Fall of Wrathful Maha

At the northernmost point of Yue State, there was a towering peak that pierced the clouds. The mountain range stretched endlessly, grand and majestic. However, the highest point of the mountain had been cleaved by a sword, leaving a smooth and flat surface, creating an inexplicable sense of discomfort.

On the flat surface of the peak, a man in a white robe lounged with his feet up, half-reclined in the mist, holding a sword in his arms. The sword had a wooden scabbard which was unremarkable in appearance. The man's face was shrouded in fog, making his features indistinguishable.

The piercing cold wind at the mountain summit was bone-chilling, yet he wore a simple white robe, idly toying with the jade pendant on his sword. He murmured to himself, "Wrathful Maha..."

From below, a woman in flowing robes ascended, her hair neatly combed and styled. Mana light shimmered around her, and her crystal hair ornaments sparkled with extraordinary brilliance. She descended with a radiant glow and greeted gently, "Shangyuan."

"Hmm," Daoist Master Shangyuan responded, staring into the distance as if he could see through the layers of mist to the situation at Mount Bianyan.

"The Wrathful Form is about to die... This grand feast should come to an end. Pity the millions who perished in Xu State, not even causing a ripple," he commented nonchalantly.

The woman's brows furrowed slightly, and she sighed. "Indeed... From the Buddhist cultivators advancing east to the great battle in Xu State and now to the siege of the Wrathful Maha, it has been a grand feast. Three Mahas from the Seven Dao have journeyed through fate and gathered their mounts. Two members of the demon clan have become great demons. We have reclaimed our territory, eliminated the unstable Wrathful Form, and everyone benefited. Things should settle down now."

As the woman spoke, a golden light shone in the distance. Chains emerged from the void, binding the Wrathful Maha's golden body. As the Wrathful Maha roared to the heavens, Daoist Master Shangyuan raised an eyebrow and said softly, "Golden Bridge Lock."

The woman focused her gaze and replied, "Indeed. The dharma relic bestowed by the immortal mansion to that Qingyuan Pristine Water True Monarch for his past meritorious service... It seems the True Monarch intends to annihilate him completely, leaving no trace of his true spirit."

Upon hearing this, the mist on Daoist Master Shangyuan's face swirled, as if he were struggling to contain something. Suddenly, he spoke with deep hatred in his voice, saying, "Old scoundrel, one day I will tear apart his immortal body, shatter his golden core, and make him taste..."

"Shangyuan!"

The woman's face turned pale with shock. She hurriedly grabbed his sleeve and whispered, "No matter what... he is still a Golden Core Realm cultivator! You cannot speak so recklessly."

"Hmm," Daoist Master Shangyuan composed himself, nodding as if nothing had happened. His dharma eyes watched the cultivator who had fallen into the forest until he landed safely. It was only then did Daoist Master Shangyuan pat the sword in his arms and said, "I will go take a look."

————

Mount Bianyan.

The sky was filled with dense chains and intertwining golden light. The dharma relic blazed with the intensity of a thousand suns, exuding an invincible aura. It effortlessly cut through the golden ribbons on the Wrathful Maha, coiling around his bronze skin and producing sizzling noises.

"Gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh...!"

The golden chains of the dharma relic seared the Wrathful Maha as if they were imbued with a unique power, leaving charred marks on his once beautiful skin. The excruciating pain caused the Maha to howl in agony.

"Fellow Daoist... is this a dharma relic?" Daoist Master Changxi asked as he stared dumbfoundedly, his face flushed from the relic's power. Beside him, Xiao Chuting secretly marveled.

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had previously quarreled with Changxi in the void sneered and replied, "Small factions are always so ignorant! A dharma relic naturally possesses boundless power. This is merely a Golden Bridge Lock. If you saw the dharma relic of the immortal mansion, the Sun-Moon Profound Light, you might faint on the spot."

Daoist Master Tianyuan nodded slightly. Seeing Changxi's embarrassed expression, he quickly stepped in to smooth things over, smiling as he said, "My master gave me explicit instructions for this mission, saying that the Azure Pond Sect places great importance on this matter and has even deployed a dharma relic. Honestly, even I didn't expect it to be this formidable."

Changxi's expression eased, and Tianyuan turned to the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, agreeing, "Daoist Master Xianyao, you are indeed knowledgeable. I have heard that the dharma relic of the immortal mansion can emit the sun's essence during the day and the moon's essence at night. Naturally, this Golden Bridge Lock is incomparable."

Daoist Master Xianyao was also surprised, clearly just learning about this, and he admired the marvel of the relic. Xiao Chuting nodded, adding, "Perhaps it should be called an immortal artifact rather than a dharma relic."

As the Daoist Masters conversed, the Wrathful Maha's suffering intensified. His deep golden eyes widened with rage. The more he suffered, the angrier he became, his aura surging and straining against the Golden Bridge Lock, causing loud creaking noises.

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators unleashed their divine abilities, bombarding his golden body. The heaven and earth were filled with the radiance of their mana, causing the ground to shake and the spiritual energy of Mount Bianyan to wane.

"Stop."

Amidst their display of power, a faint voice drifted from the sky. It was not particularly harsh, yet it flowed past the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' ears, causing them to stop and look up silently.

"Who dares to interrupt..." Zhang Tianyuan's expression darkened, but his gaze was quickly drawn to a figure holding a sword in the sky. He halted abruptly, smiling apologetically as he said, "Fellow Daoist Shangyuan, this matter has been agreed upon by the three sects..."

"Hmm," Daoist Master Shangyuan nodded, nonchalantly saying, "I am aware. However, if you continue to recklessly use your divine abilities, you will destroy this entire mountain range. Once you leave, the spiritual energy here will be unusable for three to five hundred years."

"This..." Daoist Master Tianyuan hesitated. He had not considered this and quickly offered, "How about I present a compensation gift..."

"No need." Daoist Master Shangyuan responded softly, his hand resting on his sword as he continued softly, "I will just kill him with one strike."

This statement caused a brief silence.

Though the Wrathful Maha was reincarnated and weakened, suppressed by the Golden Bridge Lock and battered by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators until he seemed near death, Buddhist cultivators were renowned for their survival skills. Ending him with a single strike would not be an easy task.

"Please, go ahead."

Daoist Master Tianyuan's smile became more sincere though he secretly scoffed, thinking to himself, Arrogant fool!

Daoist Master Shangyuan fixed his gaze on the golden body of the Wrathful Maha before him, remaining silent for several breaths. The monk, panting heavily, glared with eyes wide in fury, his voice cracking as he spat, "Cowardly scoundrel, you..."

Daoist Master Shangyuan continued to stare at him. In the monk's dimming vision, the mist on Shangyuan's face began to clear. The monk's rage suddenly ceased, and he stared in stunned disbelief at the figure before him.

"It's you..." The Wrathful Maha gazed at him in disbelief, his lantern-sized eyes fixed straight ahead. As his anger dissipated, his overwhelming aura diminished to a little stream. Daoist Master Shangyuan slowly drew his sword.

Clang!

The long sword was unsheathed. The falling leaves stopped mid-air, and the birds fell from the sky. The world was enveloped in a single, brilliant flash of white light.

————

BOOM!

In Duanchen Temple, far away in the Zhao State, an old abbot was silently striking the wooden bell under the statue of the Wrathful Vajra. Suddenly, a series of ear-piercing sounds echoed through the temple. The old abbot was stunned, raising his head shakily.

Cracks appeared all over the statue of the Wrathful Vajra before him, starting from the neck. With a thunderous crash, the statue shattered into pieces, falling to the ground in a chaotic scatter.

"The Maha... has fallen..."

————

On Yunmo Cliff in Zhao State, the brownish-yellow wind howled. A group of monks walked in a line below the cliff. Countless statues of the Wrathful Vajra, each with a different form—some holding short rods, others riding tigers, leopards, or dragons—stretched for hundreds of li, presenting a spectacular sight.

The lead monk held a torch, illuminating each statue and wiping them down. Suddenly, he looked up in confusion.

Crack, crack, crack...

The eyes of the highest Wrathful Vajra statue shattered with a loud bang. Tiny stone fragments rained down, covering the monk's head and face.

"How... is this possible... How is this possible?!"

The monks scattered like headless chickens, pushing and crying as if the sky itself were collapsing. The sound of the breaking statues resonated through the air, turning into a sea of shattered limbs and debris amidst the cries.

————

Similar events were happening in Xu State's underground cave and Beiliang's Buddhist Grotto.

————

Wrathful Subduer of the Four Demon Emperors Form, the Ninth Maha Reincarnate, fell at Zhenhui Temple on Mount Bianyan.




# Chapter 328: Renowned Throughout Yue State

When Li Tongya finally regained consciousness, the world was a dusky yellow. He had fallen by a small river on Mount Bianyan, half of his body submerged in the water. Several blue river crabs scuttled around his feet, lingering due to the influence of his Boundless Ocean immortal foundation.

Cough, cough...

Li Tongya slowly stood up. Orange-red clouds floated in the sky, and the colorful lights and the golden figure on Mount Bianyan had disappeared. Only a few carrion crows stood on the ruins, cawing mournfully.

"It is over..."

Resentment, guilt, and helplessness surged within him. Barefoot, Li Tongya stepped by the riverbank, staring blankly at the clouds on the horizon, gradually closing his eyes.

The water membrane on his abdomen slowly dissipated, and his flesh wriggled to cover the gaping wound, making it look less horrific.

Only Li Tongya knew that none of his internal organs were intact. He was barely clinging to life with his immortal foundation. From now on, he feared he could no longer progress in cultivation, and even maintaining his current cultivation level would prove to be a challenge.

Immortal cultivation differed from Buddhism cultivation. Buddhist cultivators believed the body was a vessel of suffering, and once they achieved the realm of Master Monk, their internal organs turned to white clay. In higher realms, they could freely change their bodies.

In contrast, immortal cultivators seek personal transcendence. At least until they attained the metallic essence, the body was fundamental to their cultivation. Yu Yufeng's progress stalled after being struck by a single sword from Yu Yuxie, even though his internal organs weren't damaged like Li Tongya.

The pain surging in Li Tongya's heart had not yet subsided when he felt a weight at his waist. He belatedly untied the long robe from his waist, and a round head rolled out.

"Ling'er..."

Li Xuanling's nose had been broken, likely during the battle in the temple. It looked crooked on his serene face. Li Tongya reached out to straighten it, but it flopped back down. He tried again and again, blood oozing from the fractured face, dripping downward.

"Ling'er!"

Li Tongya did not cry when he saw Li Xuanling die before him, nor when tortured and cursed by the Maha. But now, the broken nose of his eldest son easily made this old man, who had borne family and clan grudges for sixty years, wail in sorrow. A stream of tears rolled down his cheeks, falling into the lifeless eyes of Li Xuanling.

"It is my fault... I failed you and your mother..." Li Tongya cried as he managed to choke out these few words. The old man trembled, filled with shame and helplessness, and cried out in a mix of self-justification and despair, "Our family... Our family rose from humble farmers, born into this chaotic world of great strife, killing demons and exorcising evil, navigating through power struggles... Your father never had a moment of peace, never relaxed for a second... Your father did his best, Ling'er... Your father did his best!"

His originally white inner robe was now covered in mud and water, turning gray and yellow. Holding Li Xuanling's head, he alternated between murmuring to himself and crying out loud. With the brilliant sunset behind him, he staggered forward, one step at a time.

"The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and the Maha's hundred-year plan... It is beyond the power of one family, one generation... Human effort has its limits!"

Li Tongya, dressed in his thin white robe with his hair disheveled and his gray eyes full of tears, shone brilliantly in the reflection of the setting sun.

"Xuanling... Xuanling... One day—" Li Tongya's lips trembled as he spoke. Gradually, he moved deeper into the dark forest. The pitch-black shadows of the trees slowly covered his robe. As his figure was swallowed by the darkness, his voice faded into the sounds of chirping insects and birds.

————

Lijing Town.

"Congratulations! Congratulations to the family head!" a middle-aged cultivator praised.

Li Yuanping sat at the seat of honor, all dressed in white, his face pale. He was continually sketching with a brush on the desk, not even glancing at the person below him. He replied with a tone of indifference, "What is there to be happy about?"

Li Tongya had been missing for several days. The scouts sent to gather information only reported that there had been earthquakes and roars of a giant golden figure in the southern part of Xu State. Beyond that, nothing else could be found. Li Yuanping, coordinating with various parties, was worried about this matter and had not slept for several days.

The middle-aged cultivator below, with a fawning smile, repeatedly cupped his fist and replied, "I am a rogue cultivator under the rule of the Golden Tang Gate. A few days ago, I crossed south to this lake and unexpectedly encountered the renowned Li Family of Lijing. I hurried to offer my congratulations."

With a thud, he kneeled down and presented a wooden box with both hands, saying respectfully, "This is a gift—Cloud Floral Fruit, a specialty of Xu State. It is a spirit fruit of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, gentle in its medicinal properties, able to stabilize cultivation and enhance mana..."

The Li Family, now a prestigious clan, often received visits from rogue cultivators who might offer medicinal recipes, spirit herbs, or artifacts, all in hopes of finding a place to stay.

Li Yuanping had seen many of these. Seeing that the man was still holding back information, he said warmly, "Put the gift aside for now. Please share the good news... If the information is valuable, we will not be stingy."

The cultivator nodded repeatedly, responding respectfully, "Your esteemed ancestor slew the Maha Reincarnate, Fahui of Duanchen Temple, at Zhenhui Temple. The green and white sword light was earth-shattering, shaking Xu State. Now, the three sects and seven gates all speak of his name, calling him the Celestial Moon Sword!"

"What?!"

Li Yuanping was stunned, his face flushing with excitement. He quickly dropped his brush and hurried down in two steps, his face full of joy and disbelief. Grabbing the cultivator's hand, he asked urgently, "Which ancestor? Which ancestor?!"

Seeing Li Yuanping's huge reaction, the cultivator also looked pleased. Not daring to mention Li Tongya's name directly, he replied respectfully, "The ancestor from the Tong generation, named Ya, skilled in swordsmanship, and rides a serpent dragon..."

"It is him!"

The cultivator was unaware of the Li Family's generational names and just assumed Li Tongya was of the Tong generation. But Li Yuanping understood him immediately, his face flushing with joy. He looked up and laughed heartily, his excitement causing him to cough. He had to lower his head and laugh quietly.

"Hahaha!"

Dou Yi, sensing the change in atmosphere, stepped forward cheerfully and asked, "Young Master, should we go to Mount Wutu to report this news?"

Hearing this, Li Yuanping coughed twice and suddenly straightened up, startling the two people beside him into lowering their heads quickly. He looked at the cultivator and smiled, "Where did you get this information?"

The cultivator quickly cupped his fist and began to speak in a rambling manner.

It turned out that this person was a humble servant in the market under the Golden Tang Gate. Overhearing a conversation between two disciples of the Golden Tang Gate and hearing that the Li Family was inquiring about the matter of Mount Bianyan, he immediately sensed an opportunity.

He decisively abandoned his job in the market, sold everything he owned to buy the spirit fruit, and rushed overnight to Moongaze Lake to try his luck. Upon arriving at Moongaze Lake, he indeed found that the Li Family was still unaware of this news, so he loudly came forward to report it.

"It does seem somewhat credible..." Li Yuanping mumbled as he listened carefully and nodded secretly. He patted the man's shoulder kindly and said, "Thank you, Fellow Daoist. Please wait a moment while I verify the authenticity of this news. There will be a generous reward if it proves true."

The cultivator repeatedly nodded and thanked him, then hurriedly left. Only then did Li Yuanping beckon Dou Yi to come closer and whispered, "Please ask Brother Jiao to return."




# Chapter 329: Return

On Wutu Peak, clouds and mist enveloped the surroundings entirely. Sunlight pierced through the pale white fog as a young man dressed in black exhaled slowly. Spiritual energy and qi flowed into his mouth like mist, competing to enter, creating a rather mystical scene.

"Whew..."

A beautiful young woman sat on a large rock nearby, dressed in jade armor. With a spear laid across her lap, absentmindedly reading the light-colored jade slip she held in her delicate hands. Tiny characters were finely engraved on the edge of the jade slip—Wing Clipper Spear technique.

The woman mimicked movements with her hands silently. The young man beside her let out a long breath, exhaling white mist. When he finally opened his eyes, the morning glow was slowly rising on the horizon. His face was full of worry as he said, "The ancestor has been gone for several days, and we have not heard any news."

Li Qinghong, who was beside him, put down the jade slip in her hand and picked up the spear on her lap. She then jumped down from the stone, saying sullenly, "Maybe I should go out and look for him!"

"No!" Li Yuanjiao exclaimed as he quickly shook his head, getting up to stop her and saying solemnly, "When the ancestor left home, he specifically instructed me to take good care of you. I called you to Mount Wutu to guard you personally, precisely to prevent you from going out alone to look for him..."

Li Qinghong flipped her hand to put away the jade slip and shook her head with some frustration.

"Who can calm down like this?! I have read this spear technique from the Xiao Family over and over again, but I cannot help worrying about him. When you cultivate, you keep glancing at the sky, making no progress either!" she exclaimed in exasperation.

Li Yuanjiao shook his head and took out a warm jade from his bosom, which was dim and had faint cracks. Li Qinghong leaned over to look and opened her mouth, but no words came.

After the Li Family became a prestigious clan, Li Tongya had specially sought someone to craft this item. He initially wanted to use items like soul wood or soul lamps, which could indicate life or death, but was deterred by the high cost and could only opt for the relatively cheaper life jade.

As long as the life jade was nourished with a drop of blood for a certain period of time, it could show the life and death status of the blood donor. It was already quite expensive and required at least the power level of the Qi Cultivation Realm to use. Hence, only a few Qi Cultivators of the Xuan generation and Li Tongya had one made.

This item should have been in the ancestral hall. Li Xuanling and Li Xuanxuan took theirs to the market, and Li Xuanfeng's life jade had lost its effectiveness due to long neglect. Only Li Tongya's remained at home, and Li Yuanjiao had specifically taken it out and checked it from time to time.

Seeing the life jade dim and lifeless, the siblings exchanged a glance, seeing the worry in each other's eyes. Li Qinghong sighed deeply, her delicate brows furrowing as she said softly, "In the past, with Father and Grandfather guiding us, I always felt secure... Now that you and I must support the family, the path ahead seems dark and perilous, filling me with dread."

"Indeed!" Li Yuanjiao felt this most deeply among the children, as Li Tongya had personally entrusted the Li Family into his hands. When he took the jade box, it felt unbearably heavy, almost suffocating him.

After pondering for a moment, he said softly, "The effect of the Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit Talisman is excellent. I am now at the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm! Within twenty years, I might hope to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm..."

Li Qinghong had just broken through to the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and hearing this, she was somewhat envious.

"No wonder it is a Foundation Establishment Realm talisman qi... It is truly remarkable. You used to cultivate slower than I did, but now you have surpassed me!" she commended.

As they were chatting, a young man who resembled Chen Donghe approached them. He looked to be about twenty years old but was already at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. He was Chen Mufeng, Li Qiuyang's disciple, now transferred from the market to assist Li Yuanjiao.

"Young Master, Young Lady."

Chen Mufeng respectfully saluted and reported, "Young Master Yuanping requests your presence. He says there is news!"

"What?!"

The siblings were overjoyed, exchanging a glance before immediately taking flight toward Lijing Town, without saying another word.

Mount Wutu was not far from Lijing Town. Li Yuanjiao's Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit had the effect of manipulating clouds and mist, while Li Qinghong's Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow enhanced her flying speed. Hence, their flight was significantly faster than that of ordinary Qi Cultivators. They landed one after the other in the courtyard, where Li Yuanping had been waiting for some time and quickly came forward to greet them.

"Brother! Sister Hong! I have received news about our ancestor!"

Li Yuanping did not wait for them to ask questions and immediately shared the news he had received.

Li Yuanjiao was initially overjoyed as he heard the news, exclaiming repeatedly, "Good! Good!"

After thinking for a moment, doubt crossed his mind and his brows furrowed slightly.

"Can this news be trusted?"

"It is about seventy percent reliable..." Li Yuanping began, aware of the many doubts, and continued, "The ancestor calculated that it was a nine-out-of-ten chance of his death before he left, and surviving would be difficult. Who knew the news would spread like this... It does not seem like something a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator could achieve; if it were a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, it would be more believable..."

"Slaying a Maha Reincarnate..." Li Yuanjiao smiled bitterly and said, "Just think about it, and you will know it is impossible. What about the massive difference between a Maha and a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator? Besides, the Maha manipulates fate; if they die, it is likely a deliberate act... they are probably eager to reincarnate into the next life!"

Li Yuanjiao made a small joke amidst his bitterness. Li Qinghong, who idolized her grandfather, believed in the news almost completely, unable to suppress a smile as she said softly, "The Maha must have suffered a loss. Since the matter is settled and the life jade is not broken, we should wait quietly for the ancestor to return."

"That makes sense..." Li Yuanping nodded, seeing the life jade Li Yuanjiao held. With this, he gradually felt more at ease. After a few more quiet words, Li Qinghong spoke again.

"Now that the ancestor's reputation has spread, it will not be long before everyone knows about this. There will be grand celebrations proclaiming the Sword Immortal Clan, and families around the lake and nearby will come to congratulate us and bring us small gifts..."

Despite her words, Li Qinghong did not look pleased. Her delicate brows furrowed and the two brothers, Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanping, exchanged worried looks with each other. Li Yuanping nodded and said, "The ancestor has not returned yet. With such fame, there will inevitably be some trouble... We will just have to accept the congratulatory gifts with stiff upper lips and adapt as we go along."

"That is a minor issue."

Li Yuanjiao rubbed the Dragon Coiling Pillar sword at his waist and said rather grimly, "What worries me more is that the ancestor has killed the Maha Reincarnate... Who knows how many Buddhist cultivators we have offended?!"

Upon hearing this, both nodded with a look of dread on their faces, clearly having anticipated this outcome. Li Yuanping sighed heavily and said in a muffled voice, "It will not be long before grandfather's reputation echoes throughout both Jiangnan and Jiangbei... Along the river, there are countless sword cultivators, rogue cultivators, and small Buddhist temples. Many troubles will arise from this!"

Li Yuanjiao glanced at his younger siblings and calmed the situation by saying, "Fortunately, the ancestor is safe. Let us wait and see how this turns out."

While they were talking, they saw a figure descending from the sky. Dressed in a gray robe with a solemn and dignified expression between his eyebrows, his face was full of sorrow. His sleeves were dotted with wet spots, and he looked weary.

"Father!"

"Family Head!"

The three siblings cried out in surprise.

The person was Li Xuanxuan, who had been stationed at the marketplace. As soon as he descended from the sky, the three younger ones quickly kneeled in respect. Li Xuanxuan waved his hand and took out a few fragments of jade from his sleeve, his voice deep with emotion and sorrow as he spoke.

"Xuanling... has passed away."

Li Xuanxuan's words struck the three like a thunderbolt. Li Yuanping and Li Yuanjiao turned pale, and Li Qinghong raised her head in shock, her face turning ashen. She stared at the piece of shattered jade in Li Xuanxuan's hand and could only stutter out a few words that were barely audible.

"Passed... away..?"

Her complexion became deathly pale as if drained of all blood. Li Xuanling was her father, and upon hearing this news, her heart shattered. She sank to the ground, covering her face and remaining silent.

Yu Clan, Milin Prefecture.

"Li Tongya?"

Yu Xiaogui's face was dark, and the stone door behind him closed slowly. His aura was imposing, indicating further progress in his cultivation. Kneeling before the stone door, Yu Mugao was dressed fully in black with his head lowered, obscuring his expression.

"A Maha in the north was reincarnated at Duanchen Temple and had already ascended to Master Monk. Somehow... he killed Li Xuanling, but was eventually killed by Li Tongya..." Yu Mugao answered respectfully.

Yu Xiaogui frowned deeply, then sneered and waved his hand dismissively.

"Impossible! I have fought with Li Tongya... he's only slightly stronger than me. What do you take a Maha Reincarnate for? Not even Li Chejing, the sword immortal himself, could handle one!"

Yu Mugao nodded in agreement and replied, "There must be more to this than meets the eye."

Seeing Yu Xiaogui's furrowed brow, Yu Mugao cupped his fist and spoke warmly, "Father, Yu Muxian has already broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and attained his immortal foundation. I heard that in a few years, he will personally visit the lake during the next tribute collection."

"What? Xian'er has broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm?!"

Yu Xiaogui was overjoyed, laughing heartily. However, his expression soon shifted and he looked at Yu Mugao suspiciously and asked coldly, "We are all family... Why do you address your younger brother like that?"

"Brother?"

Yu Mugao raised his head and sneered coldly, "You may see him as a son, but he does not see you as a father! You do not know, Father, but Yu Muxian is now the treasured son-in-law of Tang Yuanwu.[1] He could even betray our own ancestor to gain the trust of the Azure Pond Sect... why would he care about our little Yu Family?!"

Yu Xiaogui was stunned by his words, and he grabbed Yu Mugao's collar in fury.

"What did you say?!"

"Yu Muxian has long seen our family as a stepping stone... He knew about our ancestor's death long ago! We have nurtured him since childhood, spent great efforts to send him to the sect, supported him for decades, and let him build connections within the sect... Yet, when our market was destroyed and our family declined, he refused to say a word! He even conspired with the Azure Pond Sect to betray our ancestor and specifically had Chi Zhiyan warn me..."

Yu Mugao, always a schemer, had long noticed that his brother Yu Muxian was no longer the same. He recounted event after event, leaving Yu Xiaogui in a daze, unable to believe the words he was hearing.

"How... how could this be... Despite our sincere devotion to Muxian, how could he..."

Yu Xiaogui's face was a mix of both disbelief and anguish, making his pain all the more evident in his expression.

Yu Mugao stared into his father's eyes and said harshly, "Father... do not hold any more hope for him!"

Yu Xiaogui slowly released him and took a step back, seemingly still processing Yu Mugao's words. After a long silence, he finally spoke, his voice final and decisive.

"Go get your Fourth Uncle."

"Fourth Uncle has passed away." Yu Mugao replied softly.

Yu Xiaogui's expression changed dramatically, and he looked up in shock. "He is a Qi Cultivator barely over seventy years old... how did he die?!" he roared.

"He embezzled family funds... I killed him."

Yu Mugao answered matter-of-factly, his words leaving Yu Xiaogui feeling weak. His face turned pale, and he clenched his teeth. After a long pause, he finally said, "Go get your Sixth Granduncle."

"Sixth Granduncle colluded with rogue cultivators, selling spirit rice at a low price. I killed him too," Yu Mugao answered.

Yu Xiaogui looked up at him in disbelief, his lips trembling. Suddenly, he realized that something was wrong... deathly wrong. While he had been in seclusion, everything outside seemed to have been turned upside down. His face flushed red as he asked, "How many people have you killed?"

"Fifty-eight of our granduncles, sixty-seven uncles, and one hundred ninety-four cousins, all with undeniable evidence of their heinous crimes."

Yu Mugao's expression remained respectful, but his words were chilling, causing Yu Xiaogui to step back and stare at him in disbelief.

"You... you... wretched beast! You!"

Yu Xiaogui raised his hand high and slapped Yu Mugao hard, sending him stumbling back a few steps. His anger was uncontrollable and his eyes were red with fury.

"Beast! Beast! Is there anyone you dare not kill?!"

Yu Xiaogui's face turned crimson, his imposing aura surging as he cried out hoarsely, "Your Fourth Uncle personally carried you to Milin Prefecture and sought a marriage alliance on your behalf. Your Sixth Granduncle raised me... yet you... you... They are your family! Mugao! How could you be so foolish?!"

"I know, Father."

Half of Yu Mugao's face was bright red from the slap, with blood dripping from the corner of his mouth. Yet his expression remained calm as he spoke softly, "In extraordinary times, extraordinary measures must be taken. Without such actions, the Yu Family would not survive beyond three generations."

————

Li Tongya rested for a while in the forest. Using his finger as a sword, he cut a block of wood from a tree, hollowed it out with a wave of his hand, and placed Li Xuanling's head inside carefully. He then carved another piece of wood as a cover, meticulously securing it.

His eldest son's death was tragic, and Li Tongya spent half a day using his mana to mend and repair his son's appearance as best as he could, making it somewhat presentable.

Carrying the wooden box, Li Tongya flew intermittently, finally reaching the Li Family territory. He cast a spell to clean the mud and dust from his body, concealed his presence, and entered Mount Lijing quietly.

The small courtyard on Mount Lijing was spotless, clearly having been cleaned regularly. Li Tongya placed the wooden box on the table, used his mana to send a message, and then went inside to change his clothes and compose himself. By the time he returned, the younger generation had already gathered outside to pay their respects.

Li Tongya sat high on the main seat and looked around. Li Qinghong was the most grief-stricken, weeping inconsolably with her face covered. Her beautiful almond eyes were now red and swollen as she sobbed quietly.

Li Xuanxuan had returned from the market. His years of business had given him a shrewd and calculating demeanor, and his hair was now streaked with white, showing signs of age. He stood silently, staring blankly at the wooden box, lost in thought, and said nothing.

Li Yuanping's pale face looked even worse, his eyes filled with deep resentment. Standing between them, Li Yuanjiao's face was sorrowful but he remained calm, gripping the Dragon Coiling Pillar sword tightly in his left hand with his lips pressed together.

Li Tongya sighed and handed the wooden box to Li Qinghong. She wiped her tears and took it silently, not saying a word. Li Tongya, his voice slightly hoarse, asked, "Has Yuanyun arrived yet?"

Li Yuanjiao stepped forward and replied, "I have already sent someone to Eastern Mount Yue to bring him back."

Li Xuanling had a son and a daughter—Li Yuanyun and Li Qinghong. However, Li Yuanyun, lacking a spiritual orifice, had always been pretty much invisible in the family. This was the first time Li Tongya had summoned him back to Mount Lijing. Hearing this, he nodded and fell silent.

For a while, the courtyard was filled only with Li Qinghong's sobs. The younger generation remained silent, watching Li Tongya's weary and pale face with a sense of foreboding.

After the time it took to burn a stick of incense, footsteps approached from below. The courtyard door creaked open and a middle-aged man stumbled in. He was plump, with dark circles around his eyes, and his lips were trembling.

The middle-aged man fell to his knees in front of Li Tongya with a thud, his voice tinged with sorrow and muffled by tears as he spoke softly.

"Yuanyun, your unworthy grandson, greets Grandfather..."

1. Tang Yuanwu was briefly mentioned in Chapter 236 before, but not much is known about him at this point. ☜




# Chapter 331: Mutual Understanding

Li Yuanyun was now twenty-five years old. Despite being a mortal, he was clad in brocade, enjoying a comfortable life thanks to his father and siblings. He was now a father of three sons and two daughters.

Although Li Yuanyun belonged to the younger Yuan generation, he looked older than his actual age. Unlike his siblings, who still looked fifteen or sixteen due to years of cultivation, he was aging faster than them and bore the appearance of a man in his thirties. This rapid aging had caused his subordinates to stop addressing him as "young master", instead referring to him as "Old Master".

Li Tongya watched silently with a pale face in his main seat as his eldest grandson kneeled dumbly before him, clutching a wooden box.

Though the old man's vitality was waning, his sharp eyes gleamed with intensity. His gaze lingered on Li Yuanyun's smooth and delicate hands for a while as he stayed silent.

Those hands were fair, short, and chubby. They had never wielded swords or spears; and even the calluses from gripping a brush in his youth had vanished, revealing a delicate smoothness akin to that of a carnivore.

A hint of disappointment flashed in Li Tongya's eyes as he spoke hoarsely.

"Yun'er, come here."

Li Yuanyun approached cautiously, his fear of his imposing grandfather palpable. He wiped tears from his face as he moved forward, still kneeling before Li Tongya.

Li Tongya studied him closely, noting only a trace of melancholy on his face, which was otherwise devoid of frustration or resentment.

Finally, he said, "After mourning your father, go to the marketplace and take charge."

"Understood..." Li Yuanyun murmured in response, too apprehensive to say more. He clutched the wooden box tightly and retreated.

Li Tongya surveyed the faces of the younger generation warmly and assured them, "Though my injuries are severe, I can still hold on for a few more years... If I can obtain a spiritual item like Stalactite Jade Liquid, it might extend my life further. There's no need to worry. Carry on with your tasks."

"Ancestor... Take this."

Li Yuanjiao presented a jade box to him with both hands, but Li Tongya gently pushed it away.

Though exhausted, the old man managed a faint smile and replied, "Keep it for yourself."

He carefully rose to his feet, unclasped the Qingche Sword from his waist, and hung the sword on the main seat. This sword, having been nurtured by him for many years, had developed a spirit of its own; and as soon as it left Li Tongya's grasp, it buzzed reluctantly and swayed.

Li Tongya turned back to his descendants, his instructions tinged with uncertainty.

"Do not go out of your way to seek any medicine for me, and above all, do not think about any blood sacrifice. Focus on yourselves."

"Understood!"

The juniors responded in unison.

Li Tongya stood with his hands clasped behind him, then slowly walked out of the courtyard. He made his way along the stone path laid down by Li Xiangping years ago, heading toward the cave dwelling on Mount Meiche.

In the courtyard, several juniors approached to comfort Li Qinghong and discussed the arrangements for Li Xuanling's funeral. Eventually, each went their separate ways down the mountain to attend to their own tasks.

————

Summer gave way to autumn, and rainfall became scarce.

Li Xuanling's funeral on the mountain was conducted in a simple manner. White silk decorated the courtyard for just a few months before being taken down swiftly. Li Yuanyun went to the marketplace, and Li Qinghong stood guard at Mount Yuting.

The first batch of Li Family elders also passed away in succession, and funerals became commonplace. Within a matter of two weeks or a few months, they were concluded haphazardly. When the rice harvesting season arrived, everyone became far too occupied to have time to grieve.

Meanwhile, in Eastern Mount Yue...

Birds chirped on Mount Wutu as newly polished stone benches and chairs were placed in the courtyard.

Li Yuanjiao, dressed in white, sat quietly by the stone table. Setting his jade cup down, he remarked softly, "It's been quite some time since I last saw you, cousin."

The middle-aged man seated opposite him chuckled. He had tan skin, wearing a jade crown and a long robe. His eyes were tinged faintly with violet.

"I heard a rumor recently about our ancestor slaying a Maha with his sword on Mount Bianyan and attaining mastery of the Sword Essence. The tale has spread far and wide, and many pleaded I ask you about it..." he began.
𝐟𝗿𝐞𝚎𝚠𝐞𝚋𝕟𝐨𝚟𝐞𝕝.𝕔𝕠𝚖

Li Yuanjiao chuckled lightly, meeting his gaze with a smile. "Ah, that indeed happened..." he answered.

Shamoli had originally worn a relaxed smile, but upon hearing Li Yuanjiao's confirmation, he was stunned as if struck by lightning. He instantly sat upright and exclaimed incredulously, "But that's...! That's a Maha we're talking about!"

"A Maha Incarnate," Li Yuanjiao corrected him.

"Even so, how could someone at the Foundation Establishment Realm challenge a Maha Reincarnation—let alone slay him with a sword and send ripples through Mount Yue?! The Old Ancestor... he's truly a divine figure!" Shamoli blurted out.

Shamoli, currently only at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, had consumed various unrefined qi, hence resulting in his slow cultivation progress. He had long been outpaced by Li Yuanjiao.

Any aspirations he might have harbored in the past had long been extinguished. Nevertheless, this news filled him with pride, and his eyes gleamed with joy as he exclaimed, "Amazing!"

Li Yuanjiao maintained his composure, smiling as he raised his cup to drink. Shamoli was visibly excited and spoke with great enthusiasm.

"Since the destruction of Mount Wu and the divide of Mount Yue into Western Mount Yue, Mount Yue State, and others, our Eastern Mount Yue has been overlooked by the major families... These Foundation Establishment cultivators on Mount Yue clearly do not respect the main family! It really irked me."

Shamoli brought out several boxes, each containing wooden and jade items. He lined them up neatly on the table and said, "I brought all the congratulatory gifts here. I dare not keep any single one of them for myself!"

"I never suspected you," Li Yuanjiao responded casually, sweeping his spiritual sense over the boxes swiftly. The spirit items in the box appeared in his mind's eye immediately.

These Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of Mount Yue were all calculative men who would not let out the falcon if there was no rabbit in sight, and the spirit items they presented were only of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Nevertheless, Li Yuanjiao collected the insincere gifts.

Shamoli's behavior was exactly as Li Yuanjiao had anticipated. Mount Yue was not alone in traveling to Lijing Town to congratulate the Li Family; several cultivators, whether passing through or arriving specifically for the occasion, did the same. Several prominent families under the Li Family's rule were also joyous and honored, basking in unexpected happiness.

As Shamoli grew older, he grew even more naggy. He shared various tidbits about the Tian Family and the Mount Yue nobles. Li Yuanjiao listened attentively to everything, nodding as he escorted Shamoli down the mountain and bid him farewell.

Xiao Guilan watched Shamoli descend the mountain and slowly depart with his entourage before she gracefully emerged from the house. Her sharp, narrow eyes blinked gently as she laughed.

"That Shamoli is not as bad as rumors might suggest!"

Xiao Guiluan had reached the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. She cultivated the Meridian Nourishment Technique of the Xiao Family, a Grade Four technique that was a grade superior to the Li Family's. Naturally, her progress in cultivation was faster.

"He has been reigning for more than ten years," Li Yuanjiao remarked as he tidied up the jade cups on the table.

"Well, it's a good thing that he's keeping an eye on the Tian Family and the Mount Yue nobles all these years..." Li Yuanjiao said softly, treating his wife with great tenderness.

Xiao Guiluan chuckled lightly, then sat down beside him and said, "The Xiao Family has also sent representatives... My sisters who are familiar with the family are amazed. There are wild rumors circulating, claiming our family has an immortal sword and inherits the way of the sword. Supposedly, whoever draws this sword will become the head of the family! Although your cultivation realm is high, the sword did not acknowledge you, that's why you have no choice but to remain a young master. Meanwhile, Yuanping, who is frail and sickly, happens to be an expert in sword techniques..."

Xiao Guiluan repeated what she heard to Li Yuanjiao, causing him to burst out laughing.

"Do you believe the rumors spread by a bunch of rogue Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators who cultivate with various unrefined qi?" he asked, amused.

"Of course not!" Xiao Guiluan huffed. She lowered her head and voice as she continued, "Rumors concerning the Old Ancestor or our legacy have always been taboo, and the Clan Affairs Courtyard has enforced strict silence on such matters. But now that this rumor has gained considerable spread, it's causing me to have doubts."

Li Yuanjiao's smile faded as he looked at her, noticing her eyelids fluttering.

"Carry on," he encouraged.

Xiao Guiluan's sharp, narrow eyes fixed on him. The two exchanged a few breaths of silence before Xiao Guiluan asked calmly, "Is the Old Ancestor... still in good health?"

Li Yuanjiao fell silent for several breaths, his gaze fixed on Xiao Guiluan. She looked down silently, as though trying to draw answers from the stone table itself.

Finally, after a long pause, Li Yuanjiao sighed and said, "If you already knew the answer, why did you need me to spell it out for you?"

Xiao Guiluan then looked up, taking his hand in hers. "Because I only wished you would treat me like family. Abandoned by my father in the mountains as a child, I endured cold eyes and indifference... There's nothing left for me in the Xiao Family. The only things I hold dear in this life are you and Xizhi... Why would you keep such a significant secret from me?" she asked, her voice soft and gentle.

Li Yuanjiao was deeply moved. He held her hand affectionately and said warmly, "I know you've always been sharp and perceptive, sometimes even surprising me. To think that you were even able to deduce this through the Clan Affairs Courtyard's silence and inactivity..."

Instead of pride in her deduction, her face betrayed a touch of sorrow as she continued glumly, "The Ancestor has always been discreet and reserved... The only time he would make such a move is to intimidate. However, what could be more intimidating than the Ancestor himself?"
𝕗𝐫𝚎𝗲𝘄𝐞𝕓𝐧𝕠𝘃𝕖𝐥.𝐜𝚘𝚖

"We've been married for eight years, and Xizhi is already seven. Did you think you could hide this from me?" she chided.

"Of course not!" Li Yuanjiao said as he shook his head, feeling somewhat awkward. He composed himself and replied earnestly, "This matter is incredibly sensitive. The fewer people know about it, the safer we all are."

Xiao Guiluan nodded in understanding, her expression serious as she asked softly, "How bad is his condition?"

Li Yuanjiao hesitated for a moment, before transmitting his answer through mana.

"All five organs are damaged... He may not have many years left."

"What?!"

Xiao Guiluan had initially believed the issue was limited to stalled cultivation and a drastically reduced lifespan. Now, the severity of the situation dawned on her, and she shook her head in fear as she muttered, "I see... a Maha Incarnate... such an opponent cannot be easily dealt with..."

Suddenly, she looked up as fear lingered in her slender and sharp eyes.

"We must not let Xiao Guitu find out about this!" she hissed.

Grasping Li Yuanjiao's hand tightly, Xiao Guiluan's eyes flickered with determination as she spoke in a serious voice.

"My elder brother is far-sighted and ambitious, supported by everyone in the family... His stance toward our family has always been ambiguous. The whereabouts of our Daoist Master have been unknown for a long time, leaving him in charge of family matters. If he learns of this, he will surely take action! I have studied my family's history, and when my family first rose to power, they used these methods to gradually annex the clans in Lixia Prefecture..."

Xiao Guiluan appeared uneasy. How could she not be? According to the records, none of the daughters married off from their family met a good end.

"How could he?!"

Li Yuanjiao was initially horrified. Upon reflection, he realized that the Li Family's supposed advantages over the Xiao Family were either superficial or already compromised.

The relationship between the Xiao and Li families was merely a transaction of interests centered around Moongaze Lake and Xiao Chuting's appreciation for Li Tongya. However, these were nothing but fragile bonds that held families together amidst the constant threat of calamity...

As Li Yuanjiao pondered these thoughts, he suddenly realized that the Xiao Family was not just a distant ally but also a potential rival lurking beside the Li Family.

"I see. Although the Xiao Family is officially detached from Azure Pond and cannot act openly, they can still exert influence and covertly provide support..." he muttered softly.

Xiao Guiluan nodded slowly and whispered, "During my time in the Xiao Family, I heard that our family had initially intended to align with the Yu Family. However, Yu Muxian's background was too formidable, and the Azure Pond Sect opposed such an alliance, forcing us to abandon the plan..."

Li Yuanjiao listened intently, secretly feeling a mix of relief and amusement.

"I see... I suppose my family owes thanks to Yu Muxian. If the Xiao Family had secretly aligned with the Yu Family over the past few decades, what would have become of my family?" he wondered, deeply troubled.

Xiao Guiluan refilled her husband's cup, her mind already formulating a plan.

"Don't worry, my dear... I was only asking about the ancestor to be sure. I'll take care of matters with the Xiao Family. Unless my brother intervenes personally, there won't be any problems."

"Good!" Li Yuanjiao smiled and pondered for a moment before whispering, "Rumors at home should settle soon. I'll instruct Yuanping to suppress this matter first."

"Mm-hmm."

The couple exchanged a smile, saying volumes in their silent mutual understanding.

————

Meanwhile in Lijing Town...

Li Yuanping counted the boxes on his desk meticulously, his brush tracing over fabric pages.

Suddenly, he heard a commotion outside his door. Dou Yi hurried in and whispered, "Young Master, Madam Ren has arrived."

Li Yuanping's face lit up instantly. He quickly set down his brush and welcomed a young woman into the courtyard, holding the hand of a healthy one-year-old boy with bright eyes.

"Ming'er...!"

Li Yuanping's pale face broke into a rare, wide smile as he reached for the child, causing Li Ximing to giggle in response.

Li Yuanping had married a year ago. His wife, chosen from the Ren Family, was a suitable match in age and possessed a spiritual orifice. Due to their modest cultivation realms, they were able to quickly conceive a child.

Li Yuanping was the one who named him, picking a name that had the character "Ming" in it, which was in accordance with the order of the generation names.

He had been worried about the child for a while but was eventually relieved to see that his own condition did not affect his son's root bone. Li Ximing turned out to be a healthy and robust child.

Li Yuanping gazed into the child's clear eyes and thought to himself, Brother Jiao's son, Xizhi, already possesses a spiritual orifice at seven years old. Since he has just started cultivating, it's still too early to gauge his potential. Ximing is only a little over a year old. In a few more years, he can pay his respects to the mirror...

Cradling little Ximing in his arms, Li Yuanping played with his son, eliciting joyful laughter from the child. He set Ximing down on the table gently, where the boy pushed a jade box around with precision, stopping just short of the edge and glancing back at his father.

Li Yuanping was absorbed in watching his son when suddenly, a commotion erupted outside the courtyard. A clan soldier burst into the room, completely knocking over Dou Yi who stood guard near the door with his head respectfully bowed.

"What's going on?!"

Li Yuanping had always ruled the household with strict discipline, and such disruptions were unprecedented. Rather than scolding the soldier, his heart skipped a beat as he asked sternly once again, "What's the matter?"

The soldier's face was filled with fear, not bothering to even apologize for knocking over the young master from Dou Family before blurting out, "Young Master! A Qi Cultivation Realm demon of the seventh heavenly layer has appeared in town! It's taken on its true form and is causing a disturbance in the streets!"

"Seventh heavenly layer of the Qi cultivation?" Li Yuanping breathed a sigh of relief, though his brow furrowed slightly.

"Where is Uncle Donghe... An Zheyan, and the rest?" he asked.

It had been over ten years since the Li Family had been elevated to a clan and accumulated considerable resources.

An Zheyan was at the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation, Chen Donghe at the fourth heavenly layer, and there were also several early-stage Qi Cultivators. With their strategic advantage, dealing with a seventh heavenly layer demon should be manageable.

"If necessary... the Old Ancestor has also prepared a contingency plan."

Li Yuanping knew his brother Li Yuanjiao possessed a talisman of the Foundation Establishment Realm, acquired from the Xiao Family years ago in anticipation of such events.

With this knowledge, Li Yuanping was able to maintain his composure and speak confidently, which greatly reassured the soldier.

"Master An and Uncle Donghe are currently handling the fox demon. It seems the creature isn't aggressive... It had merely triggered the town's formation, causing the formation to attack it and thus revealing its true form. From the sound of it, they haven't started fighting the demon yet," the soldier informed.

"A fox demon..?"

Li Yuanping was greatly alarmed upon hearing that it was a non-aggressive fox demon and quickly understood the situation. He hurriedly returned Ximing to his wife and swiftly descended from the platform where he had been seated, rushing out of the courtyard.

"It's a friend... It's a friend!" he urgently shouted.




# Chapter 333: Choice

By the time Li Yuanping arrived, the street had already been sealed off. Both ends stood empty, the road deserted except for two rows of clan soldiers that were standing in formation.

The demon in the Qi Cultivation Realm emanated strong demonic qi that posed a danger to mortal humans. Even slight exposure to it could cause sickness, while severe contact could prove fatal. As a result, none of the townspeople dared to stay in its vicinity.

The fox sat cross-legged, anxiously waiting at a wonton stall by the roadside. The stall's owner had long fled in a panic, leaving only a mess behind him.

Standing beside the fox was Chen Donghe, his sword held in silent vigilance, his expression solemn. He had ascended to the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, placing him among the foremost in the family.

Sitting opposite the fox, An Zheyan grinned broadly, holding a bowl of wontons while he chewed enthusiastically. Despite nearing a hundred years old, his appetite was undiminished. The aroma of the grease from his meal made the fox gulp with envy.

Li Yuanping observed the fox from afar and confirmed that it matched the rumors.

"Yuanping greets Senior!"

He hurried forward and cupped his fist respectfully, prompting the fox to emit a high-pitched squeak.

"Where's Li Tongya?"

Seeing Li Yuanping's arrival, An Zheyan tossed aside his bowl immediately, rising to his feet. Chen Donghe nodded to him before they said in unison, "Greetings, Young Master."

Li Yuanping acknowledged them before addressing the fox politely, saying, "Senior, the Old Ancestor is currently meditating in his cave dwelling. You will have to ascend the mountain to speak with him."

The fox twitched its muzzle, casting a wary glance around it. Its narrow eyes then took in the pale golden formation on Mount Lijing and hesitated momentarily before glumly saying, "But first, let's be clear... I am a close friend of your family's Old Ancestor and the demon den knows about it. If this is a ploy to ensnare and kill me within the formation, Mount Dali surely won't let this matter slide!"

"Oh, we would never dare to deceive you, Senior," Li Yuanping assured with a smile. He gestured to dismiss the clan soldiers trailing him and An Zheyan, then led the fox away.

As they passed through the shimmering barriers and entered the mountain, the fox muttered with a hint of annoyance, "Is he really that badly injured that he can't even descend the mountain to meet me?"

Li Yuanping knew that Li Tongya received about fifty percent of his information from this fox. Hence, the fox was likely aware of the Li Family's situation.

In his heart, Li Yuanping could only muster a bitter smile and thought to himself, After all, foxes are known for being cunning and calculating.

However, he replied, 'You'll see him soon and find out, Senior. The last time I saw the Old Ancestor was when I ascended the mountain a few months ago to send him healing medicine... so I am unsure of his current condition.'

After they walked the winding mountain path for a bit, the cave dwelling's entrance eventually came into view.

Li Yuanping hesitated before the sealed stone door and said respectfully, "Please wait here a moment, Senior. My elder brother will arrive shortly to unlock the door."

Despite the long friendship between the White Banyan Fox and Li Tongya, Li Yuanping could not dismiss his reservations—after all, the fox was still a demon, and Li Tongya was seriously injured. If the fox harbored ill intentions, it would be difficult for him to handle the situation.

Li Yuanjiao, at the middle stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm and possessing talismans of the Foundation Establishment Realm, was the best candidate to escort this fox into the cave dwelling.

The fox nodded, seemingly oblivious to Li Yuanping's thoughts, but just then, a loud, grating sound erupted as the stone door creaked open.

"Let it enter."

The hoarse voice of Li Tongya rang out. With no other option, Li Yuanping nodded and gestured for the fox to enter. It hurried into the cave without any further hesitation.

Inside, the cave was filled with abundant spiritual qi and illuminated white by a dharma lamp on the wall. Li Tongya, seated cross-legged on the stone bed at the center, smiled warmly at the fox.

The stone table before him was piled with a variety of spirit elixirs and pills that glowed faintly, most of which remained untouched.

"Li Tongya!" the fox exclaimed when he saw Li Tongya, looking at him with gentle eyes. His white hair and withered face shocked the fox, who hurried forward a few steps and grasped his hand, sniffing anxiously before exclaiming, "T-This... This is..."

Li Tongya chuckled and responded, "Thanks to the information you gathered, I managed to survive the wrathful Maha!"

"Why the hell are you still laughing?!"

Li Tongya had no idea where the fox had learned to say that, but its face quickly fell as it squeaked, "Your Dao has been destroyed..."

"More than that."

Li Tongya rolled up his sleeve, revealing the cracks that covered his arm, oozing droplets of light green liquid. He dabbed the liquid away and continued softly, "My cultivation has been damaged too."

Pointing at the spirit items on the stone table, Li Tongya shook his head in resignation. "I had told them not to send these things.... I know the juniors mean well, but most are of little use. This is just a waste of resources," he said dejectedly.

The fox silently gulped but squeaked, "In my opinion... This is a manageable situation! Your five organs are damaged, hence leading to the imbalance of five qi. I have a technique that involves extracting organs from people to replace your heart, spleen, stomach, lungs, and liver. You can get your disciples and grandchildren to gradually gather qi over a few months... Within three years, you'll be as good as new!"

The fox grew more animated with each word, gesturing eagerly as it continued, "As for your destroyed Dao, we can search for a horned flood dragon and feed it 6,600 people to create a blood pool. As long as we do this every three years..."

The fox's voice trailed off as Li Tongya shook his head and interrupted, "Your proposed technique involves using the internal organs of a living human, right? By gathering qi, you're essentially suggesting a blood sacrifice... And by creating that blood pool to renew my Dao... That's nothing short of dark arts."

He chuckled wryly and continued, "I, Li Tongya, hail from humble peasant origins. My life is worth nothing. Though I have taken many lives, they were mostly evildoers or cultivators, individuals who posed a threat. I've never entertained thoughts of senseless slaughter... All I seek is survival."

"This is a clan rule passed down by my father... and the moral boundary of my family."

The moment Li Tongya said "moral boundary", memories of a shiny mirror flashed through his mind.

After a brief pause, he concluded, "The Li Family may not be virtuous, but we won't resort to such dark arts... Forget it."

"You...!"

The fox froze in irritation. "What's wrong about eating people? It's all just about the survival of the fittest! Isn't it always like this? Just because you refuse to eat people doesn't stop others from doing it!" the fox hissed.

Seeing Li Tongya's silence, the fox grew even more frustrated. It rose from the stone bed and snarled, "Stubborn man! That old-fashioned thinking has prevented you from seeing my good intentions!"

Li Tongya remained seated calmly, watching the fox with a smile. It ranted on for a while, then let out a loud wail of frustration and cried.

"I still have over a hundred years to live... how am I going to continue living?!" the fox grumbled to itself for some time more before eventually falling silent.

Opening its mouth wide, he spat out a fruit the size of a jade bead that emitted a clear, cool light.

The fox cleaned its saliva off with its paws before explaining, "This is my prized Huashang Fruit, it's a precious medicine even among human cultivators. It enhances mana and vitality. If you ingest it, you might sustain yourself for a few more years and regain some strength."

Li Tongya was taken aback, unsure about how to refuse the fox. Before he could respond, the fox jumped off the bed, swinging its tail as it grumbled, "What a great loss... I thought we promised to keep ourselves safe. Now, you're going to kick the bucket in a few years..."

Without waiting for Li Tongya's response, the white banyan fox jumped and exited the cave.

Left alone in the cave, Li Tongya gazed silently at the Huashang Fruit glowing softly in his hand like a luminous pearl. A myriad of emotions flooded through him, but all were condensed into a single sigh.

Li Yuanping waited respectfully inside the cave, his heart pounding with apprehension until the fox finally emerged, looking dejected.

Rushing forward, Li Yuanping's eyes burned with anxiety.

"Senior! How is my family's ancestor?" he blurted out.

"Our family's ancestor..?"

The fox glanced at him, then straightened up suddenly. Its eyes darted around before it spoke, its voice heavy with sadness.

"There isn't much time left for him..."

"What?!"

Li Yuanping was dismayed. Li Tongya had clearly spoken of several more years... How could time be running out for him when only less than a year had passed?

The fox seized the moment to continue, "I have a way that could save your ancestor."

Upon hearing this, Li Yuanping's eyes widened with hope.

"Please tell me, Senior!"

"We'll need fresh human hearts, spleens, stomachs... totaling six thousand for each. Bring them here, and I will teach you the method to gather blood qi. In less than three years, we may heal Li Tongya's injuries."

Li Yuanping stood there in shock as he listened to the fox. Thoughts raced through his mind as he tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword until his knuckles turned white. His lips trembled for a few moments before he finally let out a sigh.

"Senior, my family forbids the practice of blood sacrifice..." he said softly, his face turning pale.

The fox was crestfallen and fell silent. Together, they descended the mountain in silence. As they reached the foot of the mountain, the fox deliberately paused and said with a slight smile, "I'm always on Mount White Banyan. Feel free to come visit if you need anything."

Li Yuanping nodded lightly. The White Banyan Fox clicked its tongue twice, then vanished into the wind.

Li Yuanping's bottom lip nearly bled as he bit down on it, watching as the fox disappeared. Finally, after a long moment, he released his grip on his sword and left the mountain.

His mind was in turmoil. Not only Li Tongya's injuries but even his own frail health and damaged root bone could also be remedied by these methods...

"Yuanping, send a hundred jin of Spirit Rice to the Elder White Banyan Fox every year."

Li Yuanping's heart felt heavy and unsettled when Li Tongya gave him this instruction. It rang in his ears like a warning bell, momentarily clearing his mind. Nevertheless, he heeded it respectfully before quickly descending the mountain.

————

"Quite an intriguing fox..." Lu Jiangxian remarked as he leaned against the jade table leisurely, watching the fox depart reluctantly.

In his sight, the fox shimmered with pure Dharma light from head to tail, exuding a calm and neutral aura. Such an aura was quite uncommon for a demon.

"This fox told Li Tongya that it was born in the wild, but its body radiated with mana light—clearly indicating an inherited lineage and profound background."

Though Lu Jiangxian had yet to recover to the Purple Mansion Realm and could not predict the demon fox's fate, he could already discern this fox's extraordinary background.

He silently pondered to himself, Judging by its insight and knowledge, this fox might be backed by one of the top Purple Mansion demons from the demon den... I wonder what its purpose is in approaching the Li Family.

Even though the Wrathful Maha had perished and Lu Jiangxian had saved Li Tongya, the matter was far from over.

Wrathful Maha, who had dedicated years to his cultivation and amassed a wealth of golden essence, carried a formidable fate. Upon his death, his fate scattered and dispersed throughout the great void, wandering aimlessly.

Daoist Master Shangyuan, either disdainful or no longer finding these fates useful, sheathed his sword and departed. Meanwhile, the nine Purple Mansion Realm cultivators pursued them through the great void, creating a grand spectacle that Lu Jiangxian found interesting.

"The Golden Feather Sect and Azure Pond Sect seem to have gained the most from this affair. Xiao Chuting, if not for his lack of combat prowess due to Man On Creek, could have benefited even more."

His intervention this time had thoroughly exhausted Lu Jiangxian. Yawning, he felt a weariness seep into his heart. He glanced at Li Tongya, who held the night pearl-like Huashang Fruit in his hands, then condensed a talisman pill and sent it into the great void with a flick of his fingers.

"I can't let you suffer too greatly either," he mumbled.

The pure talisman qi obtained through the ritual and condensed by the mirror could enhance the cultivation and the root bone of the demon fox once infused into its body.

Behind the demon fox likely lurked at most a Purple Mansion Realm demon cultivator.

Judging by the look of things, the fox had roamed freely for many years, so Lu Jiangxian had nothing to worry about the Purple Mansion Realm demon detecting something in it.

"I wonder if I've grown more cautious due to my prolonged stay with the Li Family..." Lu Jiangxian mused silently, a faint smile playing on his lips.

In the secret chamber of the Li Family's ancestral hall, the bluish-gray mirror slowly floated into the air, releasing ethereal wisps of moonlight. Like mist, the wisps filled the dark room. From the surface of a shattered mirror emerged a brilliant, radiant stream of light.

This luminous stream seemed to be imbued with a life of its own, meandering through the air with purpose. It effortlessly traversed through thick stone walls, passed through layers of dense formations, and penetrated the golden Sun Rite Profound Light Formation, finally catching up to the demon fox.

The stream of light pulsated with a rhythmic beat and then entered the back of the White Banyan Fox's head. The fox remained oblivious to its presence, continuing on its silent flight toward Mount Dali.

————

Meanwhile at the Yu Residence...

"So you're saying that... Li Tongya has either perished alongside that Maha or suffered grave injuries?" Yu Xiaogui asked in a hushed tone, narrowing his eyes at Yu Mugao who was dressed in white.

Yu Mugao shook his head, gazing at the folding fan in his hand. Absent-mindedly, he traced his finger along its cool, smooth guard.

He replied casually, "It was just my speculation. Who knows, maybe Li Tongya sustained irreversible damage during the process of slaying the Maha?"

Yu Mugao's face, once marked by a red palm print, had regained its usual pale complexion. Despite his middle-aged appearance, he spoke with a deliberate calmness.

"I heard that no one had seen him ever since he slayed the Maha, so I dispatched someone to investigate the Li Family's store in Cloud Crowned Peak's marketplace..."

"Store?" Yu Xiaogui frowned, pausing briefly before Yu Mugao chuckled and added, "Reports indicated a shortage of healing and invigorating spirit item supplies."

"Oh? You're quite thorough!" Yu Xiaogui praised as he raised an eyebrow and delight filled his eyes.

Observing Yu Mugao leisurely sipping his tea, Yu Xiaogui continued thoughtfully, "Your attention to detail is impressive. Back in the day, the only one capable of managing every aspect of the household without a leak, and even capable of betrayal, was Li Yuanxiu. Even Fei Wangbai had his vulnerabilities."

Yu Mugao's expression hardened slightly and muttered, "If not for our family's constraints and internal strife, Fei Wangbai wouldn't have managed to hold us back for so long... allowing the Li Family to flourish for naught."

Yu Xiaogui seemed uneasy, reminded of the lingering troubles from his tenure as family head. Each mention of these matters by his eldest son left him silent, prompting a quick change of subject.

"These are mere speculations on healing spirit items... Li Tongya's absence may simply be due to secluded cultivation."

"Agreed," Yu Mugao nodded gently, prompting Yu Xiaogui to inquire further, "What are your intentions?"

A faint smile played on Yu Mugao's lips, years of setbacks having sharpened rather than dulled his resolve.

"Test the waters."

The father and son exchanged glances as a servant hastily entered the room.

A fleeting look of surprise crossed the servant's face upon seeing Yu Xiaogui. He quickly bowed his head and respectfully cupped his fist to Yu Mugao, reporting, "Family Head... The Fei Family has sealed their mountain!"

"What?!"




# Chapter 335: Ning Heyuan

Mount Yuting was the most treacherous and steepest of the Li Family's mountains, and it reached into the clouds.

The courtyard atop the mountain, while not huge, housed a jade well that was as large as a pond. Despite looking like an ancient well, the water in it was crystal clear, shimmering with a mystical light.

Li Qinghong exhaled a puff of white breath, her almond eyes glowing dimly purple. With a forceful push of her palms, she unleashed a torrent of thunderous mana, her red lips parting in astonishment.

"The Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique—is it truly a secret technique modified by the descendants of its original creator...?"

She had devoted six years to mastering this technique and had studied numerous other Qi Cultivation methods. Yet, the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique's ancient simplicity and uniqueness set it apart from the rest, containing elements unheard of in other methods which often amazed Li Qinghong.

Dreaming of the day she would master the Profound Thunderpool and wield its profound power, she dispersed the spell in her hand with a wave and glanced around the courtyard before softly calling out.

"Li Xicheng!"

Footsteps came from behind the house as a twelve-year-old boy with straight eyebrows and a sweaty forehead rushed into view, stopping right in front of Li Qinghong with a smile.

"Auntie!"

The boy, Li Xicheng, was the son of Li Yuanyun and the oldest among the generation of Xi and Yue.

His father lacked a spiritual orifice and did not cultivate, hence he was the first to father a child among his generation. Li Xicheng, already thirteen, possessed a spiritual orifice. Unfortunately, his innate talent was influenced by his father's lineage and could only be considered average.

With Li Yuanyun away at the market and Li Xicheng in need of supervision, Li Qinghong, his paternal aunt and Li Yuanyun's elder sister, was naturally the best choice. Thus, Li Xicheng had been sent to train on Mount Yuting with her.

"Time for spear practice."

Li Qinghong handed a wooden spear to Li Xicheng, instructing the boy to hold it horizontally in his grasp. He stood alone, maintaining his stance as she observed him with a keen gaze.

"Are you practicing the Supreme Langyang Meridian Nourishment Technique?" she asked.

"Yes, Auntie!"

Li Qinghong nodded, her expression unreadable. The Supreme Langyang Meridian Nourishment Technique was a Grade Three technique, acquired by Li Tongya for those in the direct lineage.

As one of the recipients of the talisman seed in the family, she practiced the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra, which had to be kept a secret.
𝕗𝗿𝕖𝐞𝐰𝗲𝕓𝐧𝕠𝕧𝗲𝐥.𝚌𝐨𝚖

Xicheng, Xizhi, Ximing... I wonder who among them will receive the favor of the mirror...?

Brother Jiao plans to recommend Xizhi to the immortal sect, so he likely won't be a candidate... That means it'll be either Ximing or Xicheng...

While Li Qinghong was lost in thought, Li Xicheng gritted his teeth in silent determination. Sweat drenched his body as he held the spear up shakily.

Li Qinghong straightened his arms and was about to offer guidance when a voice thundered from beyond the compound.

"Rogue cultivator Ning Heyuan has come to pay his respects. I would like to meet the mountain master of the Li Family!"

Startled by the sudden voice, Li Xicheng dropped his spear with a clatter. He wiped the sweat beading his brow while casting a nervous glance at his aunt.

Li Qinghong glanced toward the source of the voice. Outside, a young man in green attire stood outside the formation, his waist adorned with a storage pouch and a dharma sword that glowed with mana light.

His clothes seemed to be woven from spirit yarn, his accessories lavish with top-quality jade—a display of extravagant luxury.

A rogue cultivator? Don't make me laugh!

With a scoff, Li Qinghong flew out of the formation to confront Ning Heyuan, who continued boldly, "I've long admired the renowned Li Family, known to be the master of swordsmanship. I've traveled far to challenge my peers in your family with my sword, seeking to validate my skills in swordsmanship..."

He was interrupted as a woman in a white dress emerged from the grand formation. Her presence was commanding, her eyes electrifying. She pursed her vermillion lips, fixing her intense gaze directly on him.

"A female cultivator?!"

Expecting to see a young swordsman, Ning Heyuan was taken aback, his embarrassment evident.

Li Qinghong sneered coldly, drawing her spear and slicing it through the air. Her movements were accompanied by a surge of purple thunder that crackled ominously.

Ning Heyuan had barely managed to draw his sword in defense.

"W-Wait...! Ancient technique...?! Hey, Lady!"

Before he could finish his sentence, Li Qinghong's spear crashed down, emitting a loud thunderclap. Ning Heyuan was thrown back by its sheer force.

However, Ning Heyuan was no mere novice. After the initial surprise, he swiftly recovered and employed his own technique as rain clouds appeared around his body, floating in the air. The strong sword qi emanated from his longsword, effectively blocking Li Qinghong's assault.

"Nice technique, Ning," Li Qinghong remarked, noting the mana glow around him and deducing his cultivation at the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. His technique was clearly from a major sect and of a notably high grade.

Internally, she speculated, Azure Pond Sect...?

At that moment, still grappling with the loss of her father, Li Qinghong felt an overwhelming surge of emotion within her body. She channeled this intense grief into her strength, causing true essence to pour forth even more powerfully from her Qihai acupoint.

As she executed her Vast Sky Sparrow technique, she moved with increased speed and attack power.

Having only just blocked Li Qinghong's attack, Ning Heyuan did not expect her to continue her assaults even more relentlessly. As they fought, thunder roared and flashes of lightning illuminated the sky, flickering between brightness and darkness.

Facing a cultivator skilled with thunder technique for the first time, Ning Heyuan felt a numbing sensation creeping over his palms. Despite this, he managed a wry smile.

"Isn't the Li Family a Sword Immortal Clan...? Why are you using a thunder technique? This technique is bizarre, capable of conjuring phenomena when employed. It doesn't even look like a Qi Cultivation technique... It can easily pass off as a Foundation Establishment Ream technique!"

As the battle continued, Li Qinghong fought with even greater intensity. Her eyes were an electrifying purple by now.

Ning Heyuan found himself pushed back repeatedly, forced to defend against her spear. In desperation, his longsword burst into radiant light, splitting into two rainbow beams aimed directly at Li Qinghong's face.

Li Qinghong's spear danced so fast that its afterimages seemed to resemble several purple flowers floating in the air before colliding with rainbow lights. She freed one of her hands, sketching a thunder talisman in the air precisely before channeling dark, purple thunder true essence into it.

"HA!" she shouted.

This spell was recorded in the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique, written by a predecessor but was never given a grade, and Li Qinghong had practiced it for many years. Upon invocation, the talisman surged like a rising sun before crashing down toward Ning Heyuan.

"Fine!"

When Ning Heyuan saw Li Qinghong unleash her spell, he also quickly performed a series of hand seals with his single free hand, releasing a bright, clear mana that collided with the talisman.

BOOM!

A thunderous explosion resounded through the clear sky as purple electricity and flames erupted. Smoke billowed and mana scattered in all directions, surging toward Ning Heyuan's face.

He cursed under his breath, hastily performing another series of hand seals to summon a bright light.

Like a misty rain, the spell flew toward Li Qinghong, who attempted to block it with her spear. The dazzling lightning and sharp aura of her spear were repelled several zhang away as fire and smoke finally settled into silence.

Li Qinghong stumbled a dozen steps back as the spear in her hand cracked under the strain and its mana light dimmed.

"That's a good spell!" she exclaimed, her gaze fixed on the mana light in Ning Heyuan's hand. She recognized it instantly as a legacy from the main peaks of the Azure Pond Sect, likely a Grade Four or Grade Five spell.

Only the spells circulating within the three sects and seven gates could truly be considered real spells, guarded closely and never shared beyond their circles.

In contrast, the spells known among rogue cultivators and various prominent clans were mere child's play, typically subpar and rated merely as Grade One or Two.

The mana light flickered in Ning Heyuan's hand. He cursed softly and waved his hand to disperse the spell.

"Your spearmanship and thunder technique are impressive, my lady. I was forced to use the Heavenly Serpent Celestial Light spell... It seems I have overdone it."

Li Qinghong, harboring no fondness for those with the surnames Ning or Chi in the Azure Pond Sect, simply registered the spell's name in her mind.

She nodded coldly as she replied, "Please leave. I apologize for not seeing you off."

Ning Heyuan was taken aback by her coldness. He opened his mouth to speak, only to find his emotions caught in his throat as he watched Li Qinghong prepare to retreat back up the mountain.

"Can you at least tell me your name, fairy?" he asked, arching an eyebrow.

Li Qinghong paused briefly and ultimately chose to answer his question.

"Li Qinghong from the Li Family of Lijing."
