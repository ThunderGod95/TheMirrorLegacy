# Chapter 336: Rogue Cultivator

Li Qinghong retreated alone into the mountains, leaving Ning Heyuan standing awkwardly by himself, unsure of what to do. He could not bring himself to challenge the other mountains after losing this spar.

He wandered aimlessly by the lake, where he spotted a figure walking on the surface.

The beautiful woman wore a blue dress and seemed to be in her early twenties, but was a cultivator at the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Her face was cool and composed as she frowned at Ning Heyuan and asked in a chilly tone, "Are you satisfied now?"

Ning Heyuan grimaced as he subconsciously took a step back, muttering reluctantly.

"Auntie..."

Ning Wan glanced at him, her aura fluctuating from recent exertion with others. She composed herself before saying, "I told you to wait at the lake while I checked on the Fei Family, but instead, you went and provoked the Li Family at their mountain gate!"

Ning Heyuan forced a smile and explained, "But Auntie... After hearing so much about the Sword Immortal, I just wanted to see what makes their swordsmanship so special! Besides, I told them I'm a rogue cultivator, so... no harm done, right?"

Ning Wan's eyes betrayed a hint of guilt at the mention of the Sword Immortal but was quickly angered by Ning Heyuan's stupid remark. Her beautiful eyebrows relaxed a little as she laughed, albeit in anger.

"Rogue cultivator?! Idiot! Have you ever seen any rogue cultivators outside equipped with dharma artifacts from head to toe? Not to mention one that is surnamed Ning with a generation name 'He' and even wielded the Heavenly Serpent Celestial Light spell? You've really spent too much time playing with those other idiots in the sect! Do you really think these outsiders are fools?!" she scolded fiercely.

Ning Heyuan waved her off indifferently, replying, "Who cares? I said my piece. Who dares to challenge me?"

Ning Wan, finding his behavior absurd, retorted angrily, "You're just like Chi Zhiyan!"

Ning Heyuan fell silent, bowing his head.

Ning Wan let out a frustrated sigh, recalling the time she spent with Li Chejing on Moon Lake Peak. She was quite fond of him but never imagined things would turn out the way they did.

She let out a gentle sigh, her expression tinged with sadness as she said, "Li Family... Li Chejing has an elder brother, Li Tongya, who is also skilled in swordsmanship. The Azure Pond Sect owes them an apology, but Chi Wei's words are absolute... A frail woman like myself couldn't make a difference..."

"I suppose by now they already know that Li Chejing has perished. Chi Zhiyun is thorough in his work, so the Li Family likely only knows of his death but not the entire truth."

"The Qingsui Sword Immortal..." Ning Heyuan paused, his voice tinged with empathy for Li Chejing's skill and fate. He sighed regretfully and said, "After everyone in Li Chejing's generation passes away in a few decades, the sect will simply make up a reason for his death, send condolences to the Li Family, and likely accept another descendant of the Li Family into the sect to settle the matter. The living won't let go of such an opportunity just because of one dead man."

He chuckled lightly, his lavish attire shimmering faintly with mana light as he added, "Isn't that how they've managed their rule over the centuries? Nothing can rival the allure of shiny dharma artifacts and spirit items, especially not an elder from a few generations ago whom they barely know."

Ning Wan shook her head, her expression filled with concern as she said softly, "You, Chi Zhihe, Chi Zhiyan, along with the elders of both the Ning and Chi families, have become too arrogant... Such chaos has never appeared in the Azure Pond Sect for the past five centuries of its rule. You're all too conceited."

Ning Heyuan laughed heartily in response. "Our Azure Pond Sect boasts five Purple Mansion Realm legacies, thirty-six peaks, and strategies of domination, coercion, division, and enticements honed over five centuries... We also have a system of recruiting talents from around the world and monopolizing the cultivation of countless techniques. Our goal is not only to dominate the past five hundred years but also aspire to influence the next thousand!" he boasted confidently.

Ning Wan's laughter turned cold as he retorted, "The Moonlight Origin Mansion ruled over Jiangnan for twelve hundred years. Look at where it is now?"

————

As Autumn set in, the letters on Li Yuanping's desk began accumulating day by day as he grew busy with the family's affairs, including organizing the wedding between Li Qingxiao and a son from Mount Yu of the Xiao Family which had left him sleep-deprived.

His slender frame, draped in a white robe, seemed weary, and his already pale face grew paler with worry as his gray-black eyes fixated on the documents on his desk.

Dou Yi, who was standing nearby, cast a few glances at him. After hesitating for a moment, he finally stepped forward and said hesitantly, "Young Master... Madam has come over three times to remind you to rest. Perhaps you should take a break now..."

Li Yuanping shook his head dismissively and continued writing with his brush.

"As a cultivator of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, a few days without sleep is nothing to worry about. Please convey my gratitude to Mother."

Seeing his efforts to persuade Li Yuanping were futile, Dou Yi secretly clenched his teeth and bowed. "Madam means to say that she could assist with some household affairs... She hopes that you'll take care of your health and resume your cultivation soon..." he continued, a look of worry on his expression.

Frowning, Li Yuanping replied curtly, "I know my limits. There's no need to remind me about cultivation!"

Li Yuanping understood his mother meant well, yet he was determined to handle things himself. Setting his brush down, he sighed and asked, "It's been two months since the Fei Family sealed their mountain... Any news about that?"

"Not yet," Dou Yi replied, stealing a glance at Li Yuanping's expression before continuing, "All five immortal mountains of the Fei Family remain sealed. Glacial Cloud Peak has the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation activated every day, emitting steady streams of white light."

"In their secular territory, chaos reigns among the families. Order is barely maintained. Three groups have already approached our family, inquiring about any news regarding their main family..." he added.

Li Yuanping nodded. The Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation of the Fei Family had a long history, dating back several hundred years. It had saved their family from danger multiple times and was one of the prominent formations on the lake. The continuous activation of it for a full month has surely consumed a significant amount of their resources.

"The Old Ancestor is also in seclusion..." Li Yuanping muttered to himself, recalling Ning Heyuan's sudden appearance on the lake half a month ago.

He pondered silently, Ning Heyuan is undoubtedly from the Azure Pond Sect... and the fact that he possesses such advanced spells and techniques indicates he's likely from the direct lineage of the Ning Family... Could it be that cultivators from the Azure Pond Sect are involved in the Fei Family's mountain closure?

Staring at the words Heavenly Serpent Celestial Light written on the paper, Li Yuanping fell silent. Suddenly, someone approached from below, cupping his fist respectfully.

"Young Master! There's a group of rogue cultivators fighting on our territory!"

"Rogue cultivators?" Li Yuanping repeated as he set aside his brush, aware that the matter would not have been brought to his attention if only ordinary Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators were involved.

He asked urgently, "What are their cultivation realms? How many of them are there?"

"There are both Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators and unrefined Qi cultivators... I'm not sure of their exact cultivations, but there are about six or seven of them. They are fighting fiercely in the mountains and forests, alarming Elder An who has gone to investigate!"

Li Yuanping descended from his seat, pacing in the courtyard as he murmured, "A few rogue unrefined Qi cultivators... An Zheyan is at the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi cultivation, so he should be able to handle them."

As he spoke, the courtyard erupted in commotion. A bald man clad in gray fur strode in, holding a frail old man by his collar who appeared close to his death.

"Young Master."

An Zheyan nodded respectfully, tossing the old rogue cultivator to the ground with a thud. The man groaned loudly in pain.

He then cupped his fist and declared, "This is the man!"




# Chapter 337: Heavenly Pure Essence

The old cultivator was an unrefined Qi Cultivator at the fifth heavenly layer, but his cultivation had been sealed by An Zheyan. Blood covered his head and face, his beard and hair disheveled as he kneeled limply at the bottom of the stairs.

Dou Yi stood nearby, supporting him to keep him upright while reminding the man, "Rogue cultivator! You're in the presence of the Li Family's Young Master!"

The old cultivator remained silent, kneeling on his knees in a daze. Dou Yi raised his voice and called out to the old man again. Observing the furrowed brow of Li Yuanping, who remained seated, Dou Yi turned and called out to another person.

"Xu Gongming!"

Xu Gongming hurried forward, seizing the old cultivator by his collar and placing his other hand on the old man's back. After adjusting the old man's true essence, Gongming performed a series of hand seals and applied two Tranquil Mind spells. It was only then did the rogue cultivator stirred from his stupor, as if awakening from a dream.

"Gah!"

The old man coughed up two mouthfuls of blood, his gaze sweeping over the faces of the Li Family members. He whimpered, covering his face. Dou Yi moved to speak but was silenced by Li Yuanping's gesture, allowing the old man to sob.

Li Yuanping continued reading the letters on his table in silence as the guests from various families gathered around to observe the rogue cultivator. After a while, the old cultivator's sobbing subsided, and he opened his mouth to speak.

"Rogue cultivator Bi Huaxuan greets Young Master..." he said mournfully.

"Bi Huaxuan..."

Li Yuanping nodded, setting down his vermillion brush. He spoke warmly, "No need for such formalities, old man. Your name is familiar to me... You have traveled within our Li Family's territories and camped on the Guli Road for many years."

Bi Huaxuan nodded sadly, replying, "Yes... I have been traveling and trading along the road for six years now."

Since the destruction of the Yu Family's market, Moongaze Lake had lost another place to trade. Cloud Crowned Peak in Lixia Prefecture was distant for those in the Embryonic Breathing Realm to reach, hence, Guli Road saw an increase in rogue cultivator traders like Bi Huaxuan, scraping together meager earnings in order to survive.

Li Yuanping, seeing the old cultivator now sober and capable of responding clearly, said, "All travelers on this road are welcomed by the Li Family. I apologize if there was any oversight on our part that led to conflict within our territory..."

His tone was mild and gentle, devoid of any threat. However, Bi Huaxuan, accustomed to the domineering behavior of noble families and immortal sects, trembled in fear.

He had fought over treasure within the Li Family's territory and was already feeling guilty enough. His sadness had not yet dissipated, but fear crept in upon hearing Li Yuanping's words.

Rogue cultivators held the lowest social standing, inferior even to the numerous small temples peppering the mountains. Knowing the Li Family was a Foundation Establishment Realm clan and not just some minor family, Bi Huaxuan bowed deeply.

"Young Master, we are innocent! We were ambushed..."

Without pausing to consider the reactions around him, Bi Huaxuan hurriedly recounted his sequence of events.

Originally from humble origins and working at the Moongaze Lake market, Bi Huaxuan had painstakingly become an unrefined Qi cultivator. He led a small group of mortals and a few Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators in search of fortune, and while traveling along the road yesterday with his merchant group, one of his disciples went off to relieve himself but never returned.

Bi Huaxuan, whose life had been adrift and felt he had reached a ceiling in his cultivation, particularly valued his disciples. Distressed by one's disappearance, he ventured into the Li Family's territory to seek him, thinking that it was probably safe with no powerful demons present.

After searching everywhere and shouting for hours, he discovered tatters of his disciple's clothes outside a cave. Casting a spell to investigate further, Bi Huaxuan came upon a vast expanse of sparkling water.

Looking up, he beheld an underground river that was flowing endlessly. Upon its surface floated a white object about the size of a fist, resembling water, but yet was not quite water. It bounced on the surface, crystal clear and glistening, rolling around in an oddly mesmerizing manner.

While everyone, including An Zheyan who listened intently, was captivated by Bi Huaxuan's story, Li Yuanping sensed that something was amiss and quickly interrupted him.

"Hold on. Someone, get Brother Jiao here!" he quickly instructed.

An attendant hurried off, and Dou Yi, having caught Li Yuanping's discrete signal, quickly followed up with another instruction.

"Everyone, you may attend to your own matters."

An Zheyan and the others nodded and withdrew from the room in an orderly manner. Bi Huaxuan, nervously scanning the room, found Li Yuanping's gaze fixed on him, silently urging him to continue.

Experienced in the ways of the world, Bi Huaxuan suddenly realized the significance of his find. His earlier concerns about his missing disciple faded into the background as thoughts of personal gain took over.

He swiftly dismissed his disciples and recalled the scene carefully in his mind. He felt his saliva sliding down his throat like jade liquid and his cultivation surging within his entire body, realizing that a golden opportunity had presented itself before him.

Bi Huaxuan began, his voice trembling with excitement and his eyes burning with greed. "According to the knowledge gained from my extensive journey, I think that substance I saw was likely known as the Heavenly Pure Essence—a legendary spirit water of heaven and earth! I-It can... It can..."

Li Yuanping gripped the armrest of his seat tightly with a hint of agitation, and finished the old man's sentence for him in impatience.

"Heavenly Pure Essence... This substance can strengthen spiritual sense, heal the wounds of one's foundation, purify true essence impurities, and bestow divine effects to those in the Embryonic Breathing, Qi Cultivation, and Foundation Establishment Realms!"

Heavenly Pure Essence, a rare spirit water of heaven and earth renowned for its unparalleled healing properties, held immense value in the paths of talisman arts and alchemy.

Li Yuanping had learned about it while discussing wound-healing methods with Li Tongya.

Li Tongya's immortal foundation was water-based, making Heavenly Pure Essence an extremely effective medicine for him. The prospect of speeding up Li Tongya's healing process by a few years and potentially further advancing his cultivation left Li Yuanping visibly excited.

Overwhelmed with excitement, Bi Huaxuan struggled to articulate his thoughts. Rushing into qi cultivation without acquiring a proper qi gathering technique had been his lifelong regret, haunting him to this very day.

Therefore, upon discovering the Heavenly Pure Essence, his heart surged like an unstoppable wave.

The spirit water could purify his unrefined qi, transforming it into pure qi. Although he would still pale in comparison to those who cultivated authentic techniques, it offered him a chance to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Bi Huaxuan quickly performed a series of hand seals and carefully secured the spirit water. However, just as he finished, a sudden scream echoed from outside the cave, and a figure dressed in black burst in.

"The man had pure, boundless true essence... My friends and I exchanged blows with him for over ten moves, but he overpowered us all, killing everyone else except me. I was left with no choice but to relinquish my storage pouch and flee, yet he continued to pursue me...If the guest cultivator of your esteemed clan hadn't arrived in time... this old man... would have been long dead...!" Bi Huaxuan wailed dramatically.

Upon hearing the rest of Bi Huaxuan's story, Li Yuanping's initial excitement turned into disappointment. He slumped back into his seat, angry yet unable to bring himself to vent his frustration.

He listened as Bi Huaxuan cried out, "My fate rests solely in your hands now! Please avenge me and claim this Heaven and Earth Spiritual Water for your clan! I have lost my life-long savings and disciples because of this man... Now I've nothing left! I beg you, please punish that man for this old man! I'm willing to give up the spirit water to your esteemed clan in exchange!"

Li Yuanping scoffed in response.

"Punish him? If that man has hidden in the forests, who could possibly find him? My family may be a prominent clan, but we are not a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan!"

Bi Huaxuan composed himself and pulled up his sleeve, revealing a jade bracelet with subtle patterns glowing faintly.

In a subdued voice, he explained, "I picked up these two jade bracelets from a market stall, intending to gift them... One has already been worn, while the other was in the storage pouch I've lost to that man."

"These bracelets can sense each other as long as they are not too far apart. Since the man is only at the early stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm and we fought a few hours ago, he cannot have traveled too far. He's likely recovering in the mountains... If we set out now, we may be able to catch him!"

Li Yuanping's face immediately lit up, a smile breaking through his stoic expression. He moved to take the jade bracelet but then hesitated. Settling back into his seat, he thought, I better wait for Big Brother to arrive first!

Li Yuanjiao had devoted himself to cultivating on Mount Wutu for a long time and was barely involved in overseeing the clan's affairs now.

The Qi Flow Spirit Swallowing technique had significantly accelerated his speed of cultivation and in just six months, he had already made remarkable progress.

Meanwhile, Xiao Guiluan had returned to her home. She had reached a critical juncture in her cultivation that necessitated her return to the Xiao Family to take the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath before she could learn the rest of her qi cultivation technique.

Li Xizhi, now eight years old, was a late bloomer and barely reached Li Yuanjiao's waist. Clutching a wooden slip, his youthful appearance was evident, marked by a hint of innocence in his brows.

"Father..." Li Xizhi began as he gripped the wooden slip tightly, looking up at his father with puzzled eyes, "Why must I read the Record of Immortal Ascension in the Prefecture? Brother Xicheng has already started spear training, yet I still have to read these strange books all day long..."

Li Yuanjiao patted Li Xizhi's head fondly. He opened his mouth but hesitated for a moment before replying, "Your mother borrowed this book because it details the relationships among the thirty-six peaks of Azure Pond and all the prominent clans... It’s important for you to understand these dynamics so that you can navigate the sect smoothly in the future and avoid unwittingly offending anyone."

Li Xizhi fiddled with the wooden slip, rolling and unrolling it repeatedly, seemingly agitated. After a moment of evident frustration, he looked up again and exclaimed, "Father... You’re really sending me to the Azure Pond Sect...!"

Li Yuanjiao sighed inwardly as he met his child’s mournful gaze.

"Zhi'er... my good boy, the teachings at Azure Pond are profound, and the spiritual qi there is much richer than here by the lake. Your talent is exceptional. In the future, you must cultivate qi within the sect and establish an immortal foundation. You are our family’s hope..."

Li Yuanjiao was never good at comforting children and tears began welling up in Li Xizhi's eyes as he listened to his father. He nodded vigorously, yet was unable to hold back his emotions.

Li Yuanjiao's troubled expression was tinged with guilt. As he pondered on what to do next, a clan soldier approached and respectfully announced, "Young Master, please come home. Young Master Yuanping needs to discuss something important with you!"

Relief washed over Li Yuanjiao. He wiped Li Xizhi’s tears and instructed him in a comforting tone, "Wait for me at the peak. Daddy will return soon."

With these words, he soared into the air, leaving Li Xizhi behind. The boy read his wooden slip for a while longer before tossing it aside in frustration and retreating to his room to sleep.

————

Li Yuanjiao flew all the way to Lijing Town and descended gracefully into the courtyard where his brother waited. Li Yuanping was examining the jade bracelet, scrutinizing the delicate pattern on its surface. Upon spotting Li Yuanjiao in his black attire, he hurried over to greet him immediately.

"Big Brother! There's news regarding the Heavenly Pure Essence!"

"What?!"

Li Yuanjiao's face lit up with joy instantly as he eagerly pressed for details. However, as Li Yuanping relayed the news, the joy dissipated, his brows knitting together in concern. Taking the jade bracelet, he closed his eyes to concentrate.

His spiritual sense flowed along the pattern on the jade bracelet before entering it, and he could immediately feel a subtle pull from a distance.

After a few moments, he opened his eyes, his expression now filled with doubt.

"The person is still on a mountain nearby..."

Li Yuanping, lacking the spiritual sense to utilize the bracelet, was stunned by Li Yuanjiao's revelation and murmured softly, "It's strange that he still dares to linger nearby after obtaining such precious spirit water..."

"As per the old rogue cultivator, this person was enveloped in mana light. Since he cultivates an authentic technique, he managed to defeat and kill many despite only being at the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm... It's likely he's a disciple from an immortal sect!"

Li Yuanping pondered carefully with an uneasy look on his face before responding cautiously, "I wonder what his background and identity is... If he can act this fearlessly, he likely comes from a formidable background and is not an easy opponent to deal with."

Li Yuanjiao remained silent, scrutinizing the jade bracelet in his hand thoughtfully.

"Have you sent someone to investigate that cave already?" Li Yuanjiao asked.

Li Yuanping nodded and confirmed, "I've already sent Uncle Donghe there. He should be returning soon."

As they spoke, Chen Donghe hurried in, his attire impeccable and his sword swaying slightly at his waist. He stopped before the brothers, cupped his fist in respect, and reported, "I've inspected the cave. It’s a mess inside due to the fight. The walls are scarred and the ground is littered with stalactite fragments... Besides that, there wasn't much else to find."

"Thank you, Uncle Donghe," Li Yuanping responded. Chen Donghe nodded and cupped his fist once more, then exited the room.

Turning to his elder brother, Li Yuanping shared his thoughts.

"I was considering exploring the cave myself. With the Heavenly Pure Essence nurtured there, I believe the cave is anything but ordinary..."

Li Yuanjiao ascended a few steps, his gaze fixed on the jade bracelet as he traced the patterns with his thumb thoughtfully. Suddenly, he remarked, "This is too much of a coincidence."

Li Yuanping glanced at his brother, then fell into deep thought.

Li Yuanjiao continued, "Our Old Ancestor always warned us to remain cautious in handling family affairs... This situation reeks of coincidence... This person suddenly came and left, yet he lingers nearby after seizing the spirit water..."

"Brot-..." Li Yuanping began, but Li Yuanjiao raised his hand to cut him off. He performed a series of hand seals and began channeling his true essence.

His River True Essence, clear as turquoise lake water, enveloped the jade bracelet. He then stowed it into his storage pouch, explaining, "Guiluan mentioned numerous secret techniques that can manipulate minds and provoke desires through dharma artifacts... This incident is highly suspicious; we must be cautious."

"Yes. The Heavenly Pure Essence is undeniably tempting... Even I almost acted recklessly. After hearing your explanation, I believe your caution is well-founded," Li Yuanping agreed thoughtfully.

Li Yuanjiao nodded solemnly.

"Our family has ruled this territory for generations. I can believe that we've overlooked the spirit water all this time, but the sudden emergence of this jade bracelet is too convenient to be a mere coincidence."

The brothers' perspective had shifted significantly after the incident where Li Tongya was nearly turned into a sacrifice for the Maha Incarnate. They viewed the world much differently now than they did a year ago.

Li Yuanjiao chuckled wryly, remarking, "The so-called opportunities are often baits. They lure you in with promise, but the hidden traps that await are sharp and deadly..."

He continued, "Now that the old ancestor is gravely injured, I wouldn't have suspected anything if this were any other spirit water... But this is the Heavenly Pure Essence we're talking about."

The two brothers exchanged glances, and Li Yuanping sighed.

"The temptation is just too great... We don't know its true nature. If this is truly an opportunity, it would be regrettable to let it slip by."

"It doesn’t matter," Li Yuanjiao replied with a mysterious smile, then used mana to transmit his voice, "Have you forgotten we still possess an immortal item at home that can see a thousand li ahead, unhindered by any mountain or water body?"

"Ah, yes!"

Li Yuanping suddenly remembered the mirror, a family heirloom invaluable in times of crisis, yet he had momentarily forgotten its capability.

He pounded his fist in his palm excitedly and smiled.

"I'll go retrieve it from the mountain now!"




# Chapter 339: Checking On The Fei Family

Li Yuanjiao used a spell to clean the dust from his clothes and burned incense before entering the secret chamber to retrieve the mirror. Holding the cold bluish-gray artifact in his hands made his heart race and left him somewhat bewildered.

"To think that the destiny of our clan is tied to this single mirror..." he murmured.

The general family's historical records made no mention of this particular mirror. After Li Yuanjiao had received a talisman seed, Li Tongya retrieved another version titled Internal History from beneath the stone platform in this secret chamber. It was only after reading it with mixed emotions that Li Yuanjiao finally understood more about this mirror.

He read the jade slips repeatedly, committing them to memory before leaving the ancestral hall.

Li Yuanjiao was puzzled that even the Internal History was vague and contradictory about the origins of the bluish-gray mirror.

Aunt Li Jingtian wrote this in the clan's biography—The ancestor obtained a dharma artifact. From it, he received a talisman seed and began to cultivate.

However, in Li Mutian's biography, it was stated that—The old ancestor journeyed north with an immortal, and established the immortal foundation. With the profound mirror in his hands, he traveled across Wu and Yue states before ultimately returning home to establish his clan 219 years ago.

"Obtained a dharma artifact...? What did they mean by 'obtained a dharma artifact'?"

Li Yuanjiao had heard from Li Xuanxuan that Li Mutian was a mere mortal. How could a mortal obtain such a dharma treasure in the first place...?

Lost in thought, Li Yuanjiao descended the mountain, flying north for over ten li before snapping out of his reverie. He then retrieved the mirror from his chest pocket, glancing at it. The complex patterns around its rim glowed faintly, lending the mirror an even more mystical aura.

Gently running his thumb over its patterns, he immersed his spiritual sense into the dharma artifact and whispered quietly but respectfully, "As a disciple of the Li Family, I, Li Yuanjiao, respectfully request the Profound Light to grant me the Supreme Yin Profound Light to vanquish evil, cleanse impurity, and subdue demons!"

As soon as Li Yuanjiao had finished speaking, a brilliant light burst before his eyes. He felt as if he were soaring into the sky, witnessing Lijing Town and the entire Li Residence sprawled below his eyes.

The bustling townsfolk, the clucking of chickens, and the barking of dogs echoed in his ears. From patrolling clan soldiers to dense forests and the deep turquoise ripples of the lake, everything lay vividly before his eyes.

"Whoa..."

Li Yuanjiao quickly realized that with a mere thought, the dazzling Supreme Yin Profound Light could strike anywhere at the mountain's foot in an instant. He refocused his mind and zoomed in closer toward the direction provided by the jade bracelet.

As his mind traveled through the sky, forests, and dark mountain rocks, a cave finally appeared before his eyes. It was rugged and narrow, with walls marked by deep knife cuts, as if hastily excavated.

At the center of the cave sat a middle-aged man with a short beard in black robes on a futon. He was clearly a Qi cultivator of the second heavenly layer. He was playing with the other jade bracelet with a cold expression on his face, occasionally glancing anxiously at the entrance with a hint of fear lingering in his eyes.

Seeing the jade bracelet in the man's hands, Li Yuanjiao immediately sensed that something was amiss.

"This is indeed suspicious..."

The man's attire was plain, revealing nothing discernible. Li Yuanjiao secretly committed his face to memory before scanning the mountain surroundings around him. However, he found no other signs of human presence.

Suppressing the urge to unleash the Supreme Yin Profound Light on the man, Li Yuanjiao slowly withdrew his hand and began to retreat into the mountain. However, just as he was about to leave, a thought struck him, causing him to halt his actions.

He lifted his head and gazed toward the Glacial Cloud Peak in the north where the Fei Family was, shrouded by the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation. An irresistible curiosity seized him.

"Maybe I should take this opportunity to explore what lies beneath the Fei Family's grand formation!"

After pondering for a few moments, Li Yuanjiao ascended swiftly, concealing the mirror in his chest pocket since it couldn't be stored in his storage pouch.

He flew over the lake, causing ripples on its surface, and found a small island near the northern shore where he landed and sat cross-legged. Once again, he retrieved the mirror and closed his eyes in concentration.

Crossing the lake's shore, the earth's veins loomed ahead on the northern shore, with terrain rising steeply. As Li Yuanjiao gazed upon the chaotic Fei Family territory, he witnessed several towns in disarray.

Fires blazed amidst intertwining mana lights, demonic auras surged, and dark-colored energies flowed ominously. In the midst of the turmoil, cultivators clashed, their dharma weapons colliding in the air.

The immortal mountain of the Fei Family remained sealed and most of the towns were populated by Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators. These cultivators were powerless against any rogue cultivators who passed through and might seek to cause trouble.

Fortunately, the longstanding reputation of the Fei Family had kept these rogue cultivators in check until now. Nonetheless, the towns did not get along with each other, and tension between them remained high.

The demons from Mount Dali and Xu State took advantage of this chaos like hungry wolves on the prowl, causing great havoc and capturing people. The Embryonic Breathing cultivators struggled to defend themselves against them, let alone eliminate these demons.

"The Fei Family has been a prestigious clan for many years... At the very least, these rogue cultivators dare not act rashly. If they did, the situation would be far worse."

After a brief survey of the scene before him, Li Yuanjiao turned his attention to the grand formation radiating white light that enveloped the towering Glacial Cloud Peak. It appeared ancient and complex, rumored to withstand even Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.

Li Yuanjiao cautiously approached the formation and suddenly, his vision brightened, as if he had passed through it effortlessly, overlooking the entire Fei Family town's formation.

Glacial Cloud Peak was shrouded in clouds and fog which was brimming with spiritual qi and covered by pines and cypresses. Snowflakes and scattered paper money[1] fluttered down, covering the mountain like white flowers while courtyards were decorated with white ribbons that swayed gently in the wind.

At the foot of the mountain lay collapsed buildings devoid of people, save for deep sword marks that were etched into the ruins, emitting sharp sword qi that scattered the falling snowflakes.

Li Yuanjiao silently adjusted his field of vision and spotted a handsome young man. He was kneeling in the highest part of the courtyard, all dressed in white and surrounded by elders from his clan, their faces etched with sorrow.

"Tongyu... This grand formation has been running for over half a year. The family can't sustain this anymore..."

"Yes, Tongyu... Although the family head had left behind a vast fortune, it can't support your expenditures like this..."

"All you do is kneel at the ancestral hall all day, yet you don't realize how quickly the Spirit Stones are depleting..."

As the snowflakes continued to fall, Fei Tongyu's handsome features remained composed, masking the grief and worry within.

He clenched his teeth in silence.

Li Yuanjiao recognized him as Fei Tongyu, the young master of the Fei Family. They had met during Li Yuanjiao's wedding and now, he was already a peak Fetal Breath cultivator.

Li Yuanjiao's gaze moved beyond the group to the tablet in front of them.

Here lies the esteemed Ancestor of the Fei Family, whose birth name was Wangbai.

The candle flame flickered, casting an intense glow on the lettering of the golden tablet. In the middle of the snow-covered courtyard lay a black coffin. As Li Yuanjiao peered closer, shock gripped his heart.

"Fei Wangbai... is dead?"

Fei Wangbai's body lay in the coffin, his face looking no different than how it was when he was still alive. His head, however, had been separated from his body. A white cloth covered his neck, concealing a grisly wound.

"Fei Wangbai... He's truly dead."

Fei Wangbai, the only Foundation Establishment Realm Immortal Cultivator of the Fei Family in the recent century—the genius who had quietly elevated the Fei Family to prominence, leading them to stand at the pinnacle of Moongaze Lake—had unexpectedly perished on his own immortal mountain.

# Chapter 340: Schemes

Meanwhile, at the Yu Residence in Milin Prefecture...

"Family Head, Lord Munian said that the Li Family isn't making any moves and that he's been waiting nearby for more than half a day already... so he's wondering if he could withdraw for the time being..."

Yu Xiaogui's expression darkened as he crumpled the letter in his hand in anger and cursed, "That useless fool!"

The attendant who had brought the report immediately quaked with fear and quickly pressed his forehead to the ground, not daring to meet Yu Xiaogui's fiery gaze.

Through gritted teeth, Yu Xiaogui continued ranting, his voice laced with disdain.

"I told him to act according to the plan, yet he's acting like a coward instead! He took so many dharma artifacts with him and killed randomly, but dawdles around on Li Family's territory?! Does he think the Li Family is foolish?!" he roared.

His voice was laced with suppressed anger as he continued through clenched teeth, "It took us great effort to set up this situation, and now he's screwing it up! Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanping are no fools, they've likely detected that something is amiss!"

Yu Mugao, in his elegant white robe, stood at the side in a composed demeanor. He played with his fan and said calmly, "Please calm your anger, Father. Many in our family are inept; such mishaps are to be expected. It would be a surprise to me if we actually succeeded."

Having ruled for many years, Yu Mugao knew well the caliber of individuals within their own family. His anger had long been turned into disappointment, and from consequent disappointment to resignation.

His expression remained unchanged as he muttered, "The world attributes Li Family's swift rise to rogue cultivator Li Mutian's attainment of the Foundation Establishment Realm, Li Chejing's status as the Sword Immortal, and Li Tongya's steady leadership. All of these three are indispensable."

Yu Mugao went through the roster on the table, finding no solace in the available options as he continued, "But in my opinion, the Li Family's greatest strength lies not in their swordsmanship, nor Li Tongya or Li Chejing... but in the fact that for three generations, they have not produced a single useless fool!"

Upon hearing this from his eldest son, Yu Xiaogui sighed. Even a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator like himself could not help but feel a twinge of powerlessness as he muttered, "Useless..."
𝐟𝐫𝕖𝗲𝘄𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝕧𝐞𝚕.𝕔𝕠𝐦

Putting away his brush, Yu Mugao replied softly, "Not entirely."

"Yet the Li Family remains silent!"

Yu Xiaogui furrowed his brow and continued, "If Li Tongya has indeed been injured, there's no way the Li Family will let this Heavenly Pure Essence slip by! Your calculations have fallen short."

"No," Yu Mugao chuckled lightly as he stood up, a smile playing on his lips.

"It's precisely because Li Tongya is in a vulnerable state that they have to give up on the Heavenly Pure Essence."

"Li Tongya is cautious, not cowardly. If he had truly eliminated the Maha with his sword and withdrawn unscathed, he would never give up on a rare spirit water like the Heavenly Pure Essence. It's likely that as soon as Bi Huaxuan was rescued, Li Tongya would have taken up his sword and hunted it down personally."

He glanced at Yu Xiaogui who was listening intently, and added, "Think about it, this spirit water is in the Li Family's territory... Even if it were a trap, Li Tongya would still go for it. After all, he's a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. Why would someone like him feel fearful in his own territory?"

"You have a point," Yu Xiaogui nodded in sudden realization.

Yu Mugao continued, "My intention isn't solely to successfully lay a trap. Even those considered useless have their uses. From this, we arrive at two possibilities—Li Tongya is either gravely injured or is absent from the Li Residence altogether."

Yu Xiaogui was already convinced by his eldest son's reasoning and quickly interjected, "Does that mean... this is the time to attack the Li Family? But they have the Xiao Family's protection and we cannot afford to provoke a Purple Mansion Immortal Clan. At best, we can only reclaim Mount Huazhong and Mount Yuting..."

"No, we'll strike the Fei Family, using the old grudge from what happened to the marketplace as justification."

Yu Mugao adjusted his cuffs, projecting a more commanding presence as he elaborated further, "Li Tongya may simply not have returned home yet. With the Li Family backed by an immortal clan, seizing this opportunity to attack them will only allow us to reclaim Mount Huazhong and Mount Yuting at most. Since this is the case... why not look further north? The Fei Family boasts five peaks and sixteen towns!"

"The Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation has been activated for so long... Fei Wangbai is either not around or attempting a breakthrough. Either way, it's a good time to strike!" he added.

A slight smile played on his lips as he closed his folding fan and continued, "Besides... I have a feeling that Fei Wangbai is very likely dead."

————

Meanwhile in Lijing Town.

Li Yuanping waited anxiously in the courtyard for half a day before he finally saw Li Yuanjiao descend into the courtyard with a look of unease on his face. He hurriedly rushed forward, grasping Li Yuanjiao's arms tightly. Staring into his eyes, he asked with great urgency in his tone, "What is it, Big Brother?"

Li Yuanjiao finally snapped back to his senses, looking at Li Yuanping worriedly before replying hoarsely, "I saw it. It's indeed a trap... but..."

Realization dawned on Li Yuanping, and he quickly turned around and shouted to the clan soldiers on either side, "You're dismissed! Everyone, leave!"

Dou Yi promptly ushered everyone out before leaving himself and securely shut the courtyard gate tightly behind him. An isolation formation hummed to life, enveloping the brothers in a protective shield.

Small beads of sweat formed on Li Yuanjiao's forehead and his voice was strained as he divulged, "Fei Wangbai is dead!"

"Fei Wangbai... the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from the Fei Family..?!" Li Yuanping muttered in shock as he stared at his brother in disbelief.

Li Yuanjiao continued bitterly, "Yes, an esteemed Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, gone quietly on his own immortal mountain! Fei Tongyu had to activate the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation to prevent this news from leaking out... The Fei Family is in absolute chaos right now."

"I wonder if the Yu Family is aware of this. With our old ancestor gravely injured and Fei Wangbai dead... they are practically the only ones on the lake with a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator that's able to fight..." he murmured in concern.

His dark gray eyes then widened slightly as they fixed on his younger brother. "The Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation has been active for months now, and it seems it is more of a trap for those inside than a barrier against the outside world... Fei Tongyu must have suspected that there are Yu Family spies within the Fei Family, hence the necessity to activate such a large-scale formation to isolate internal affairs from external scrutiny..."

Li Yuanping shivered involuntarily as he answered softly, "Yes... with their family's Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator gone, the Fei Family likely dares not seek support from Fei Wangbai's acquaintances of the Foundation Establishment Realm... Even our family isn't informed of this. Fei Tongyu must be really scared. No wonder despite sending inquiries thrice, the Fei Family never responded to us!"

Fei Wangbai's close relationship with the other Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators during his lifetime did not automatically extend to friendship with his insignificant descendants.

While these cultivators might be willing to assist under the guise of past favors, once they entered the Fei Family's formation, there was no guarantee that the Fei Family members could still get to keep their own surname.

Li Yuanjiao composed himself and said quietly, "Yu Mugao is such a cunning fox..."

The very mention of Yu Mugao stirred deep hatred in his eyes, memories of Li Yuanxiu's tragic death still haunting him in his mind. He had to take a deep breath to steady his emotions.

"This whole Heavenly Pure Essence incident is most likely the work of the Yu Family to test our ancestor's reaction... Yu Mugao is cunning and deceitful. Dealing with him will be a challenge for us. Fei Tongyu's tactics surely won't work on him," Li Yuanjiao said thoughtfully.

"Moreover, with Yu Muxian in the sect, the Yu Family's grasp of current events is ahead of ours. Fei Wangbai's death cannot be concealed for long! It's probable that after testing our reaction, the Yu Family is already dispatching forces to Glacial Cloud Peak as we speak!" he exclaimed.

Li Yuanping paused briefly, then remembered something and continued, "Ning Heyuan appeared at Yuting Peak in the first lunar month... I bet his appearance is possibly related to Fei Wangbai's death. However..."

He pondered briefly before concluding, "The Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation has been active for several months; the timing doesn't quite fit."

Shaking off the distracting thoughts, Li Yuanjiao instructed, "Don't concern yourself with these, I'll ascend the mountain and consult with the old ancestor. Keep watch over the Fei Family!"

With that, he swiftly exited the courtyard and took to the winds. It was only then did Dou Yi dare to enter the courtyard once more. Li Yuanping seemed lost in thought for a few moments before he finally spoke, breaking the tense silence.

"Send someone to the lake and station him on a small continent near the northern shore. If there's any change in the Fei Family's grand formation, they must report back to me immediately."

"Understood," Dou Yi replied promptly, hurrying out.

Li Yuanping coughed, his mind's eye fixated on the sinister eyes of Yu Mugao's portrait as he mumbled softly to himself.

"Yu Mugao... is truly our family's greatest adversary."




# Chapter 341: Advancing North

The white snow on Glacial Cloud Peak never melted, covering the eaves of the ancestral hall completely. The flickering candlelight cast a dim glow around the hall, and for the first time since he began his cultivation, Fei Tongyu felt cold.

He was alone, shivering on the ground weakly.

Before him lay the corpse of his grandfather, Fei Wangbai, in a coffin. As a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, his flesh did not decay, appearing just as he did in life, though slightly paler. His eyes were tightly shut, as if just in a slumber.

Fei Tongyu could hardly believe that his grandfather had passed away so abruptly. It felt unreal, almost like he was in a dream—or a nightmare.

On the day news arrived that Li Tongya had slain the Maha Reincarnate, the smile on Fei Wangbai's face vanished. With his eldest son Fei Yihe away in the southern border, he could only hold his eldest grandson Fei Tongyu's hand and say solemnly, "Yu Yufeng is likely dead... Li Chejing probably killed him. The Li Family's power is growing too strong, which is not a good thing."

Fei Yihe's departure disrupted Fei Wangbai's plans, so he had to start over in grooming Fei Tongyu. Fortunately, Fei Tongyu was diligent and hardworking, and it still was not too late.

While they were talking, the door was gently pushed open and a man in white entered, his face covered with a veil. Fei Wangbai's expression changed slightly as he asked, "Who are you?"

The white-clad sword cultivator said nothing, simply glancing at the two men, then drew his sword and attacked.

Although the Fei Family's Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation was not fully activated, it was not something anyone could easily penetrate. However, this person moved like a ghost, his sword techniques ethereal and transcendent... clearly at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Fei Wangbai, only at the early stage of Foundation Establishment Realm, was no match in terms of cultivation techniques and spearmanship. After dozens of moves, his dharma artifact was shattered, and he barely managed to escape to the foot of the mountain. In the ensuing struggle, a sword light severed his head.

The vitality of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was strong, and Fei Wangbai did not die immediately. He picked up his head and tried to reattach it desperately, but the wound spewed sword qi and it was no use. After two failed attempts, he finally dropped his head and collapsed.

His head fell into the snow, still shedding tears as he cried out, "It hurts so much!"

Fei Wangbai, always graceful and meticulous about his appearance, died without any dignity. His previously spotless clothing was now soaked in blood from his neck downward, and his body lay twisted grotesquely on the ground.

The wind and snow picked up, lifting a small corner of his fine robe which was soon covered by the falling snow. The Fei Family stood as if struck by lightning, staring in disbelief at the sword cultivator in the sky.

Some trembled in fear while others wept hysterically, and some attacked with their weapons. The sword cultivator in white simply stood there, dispersing dozens of spells with a single sword strike as he said softly but in a commanding manner, "Listen well! For the next eighty years, do not cultivate the Long Brocade Heart Sutra to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm... Should anyone successfully form the Patterned Brocade, they shall end up like this!"

His tone was calm as if he was not proud of crushing an ant.

With that, he flew away. The Fei Family's ancient formation, the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation, was like a piece of tattered paper before this sword cultivator, yielding to him as if he were its true master.

The Long Brocade Heart Sutra was the core technique of the Fei Family, and Fei Wangbai had used it to cultivate his immortal foundation—Patterned Brocade. The sword cultivator's words meant severing the future path of the entire Fei Family.

Fei Tongyu broke down in tears, and the Fei Family quickly descended into chaos. When Fei Tongyu finally looked up again, Fei Tongxiao had fully reactivated the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation. The fastest cultivators among them could only reach the mountaintop and none could leave.

His gaze refocused on the black coffin before him, and Fei Tongyu murmured, "Father has gone to the southern border... Grandfather... I am only at the peak of Embryonic Breathing Realm... What am I supposed to do...?"

Fei Tongyu kneeled quietly on the ground, staring at the flickering candles and incense sticks on the table. Fei Wangbai's body lay separated in the coffin, covered with a white cloth that barely concealed the gap between his neck and severed head.

"It would not reattach..." Fei Tongyu muttered weakly as he closed his eyes in pain. The sword qi left by the sword cultivator was surging from Fei Wangbai's neck wound, breaking more than ten coffins already. As a result, they had to bury him with his body and head separated.

Fei Tongyu bowed his head and wept. Behind him, Fei Tongxiao, clad in jade armor, remained calm. The childishness had vanished from his face overnight, now replaced by a mature worry and unease.

Adversity could completely change a person. Fei Tongxiao's gaze had become more focused and resilient, though dimmed with sorrow. He stared at the ancestral tablets above, speaking in a deep voice, "Big Brother! We cannot go on like this!"

"What solution do you have?!" Fei Tongyu roared as he glared at him with hatred, sneering, "Notify the Li Family?! I would rather trust those Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators than those hungry wolves of the Li Family!"

Fei Tongxiao remained silent for a long time before saying quietly, "Yu Mugao will make a move sooner or later."

"So what if he does?!"

Fei Tongyu turned abruptly, his voice filled with venom as he snarled, "There is no one in the Fei Family who fears death! Let him come!"

Fei Tongxiao shook his head, speaking softly, "Brother... no more impulsive actions! No matter how much hatred you harbor... we must survive. As long as we live on, there is hope for revenge. Moreover... those Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators are elusive, secluding themselves for years at a time. We have kept our formation running for months; everyone around Moongaze Lake knows it, yet not one has come to our aid... Only the Li Family sent their people a few times. Right now, our only hope is the Li Family!"

Fei Tongyu collapsed to the ground in despair. After a long time, he murmured in defeat, "Notify the Li Family then..."

————

Milin Prefecture.

The Yu Family had improved greatly over the years due to Yu Mugao's relentless purges. The common people's lives had improved significantly, as most of the Yu Family's scoundrels had been beheaded, including three of Yu Mugao's own illegitimate sons.

Yu Mugao's purge and land redistribution greatly slowed the Yu Family's land consolidation, earning him the peak of his popularity among the common folk. Thus, raising an army now was effortless.

"These mortals..." Yu Mugao muttered as he looked down at the reverent faces below, feeling a complex mix of emotions. He was momentarily unsure of what to think.

Yu Xiaogui, who was standing beside him, snorted, "What use are mortals? They can only help with minor tasks; a single spell can solve most problems. The Fei Family's territory is already in chaos, and a few Qi Cultivators could easily handle it."

Yu Mugao was jolted back to reality by his words as his eyes regained their cold and venomous clarity. He said softly, "Maintaining order in occupied towns requires these mortals... Give them a little profit, and they will form their own hierarchy, managing everything efficiently. No spell is more useful than these people!"

Yu Xiaogui flew alongside him, sneering, "You know that well enough! No need to upend things like the Li Family does!"

"The Li Family's reliance on external cultivators is playing with fire; they are different from us," Yu Mugao said as he shook his head.

Yu Xiaogui turned away, as if the mention of "relying on external cultivators" had touched a sore spot in his memories. The two, along with a group of guest cultivators and Yu Family members, flew silently toward Glacial Cloud Peak.

The glistening white Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation appeared before them, with its complex patterns emerging in the air. Yu Xiaogui glanced at it with a sense of nostalgia, murmuring, "This formation has stood on Glacial Cloud Peak since my grandfather's time, buried beneath the earth, only for Fei Tianxuan to take advantage and establish the Fei Family here..."

Yu Mugao stood with his hands behind his back, speaking softly, "At that time, the only family on the southeastern shore was the Jiang Family."

His words caused Yu Xiaogui to look at him sharply. As the eldest son managing the family for many years, Yu Mugao knowing this was not surprising. Yu Xiaogui then gazed at Glacial Cloud Peak and nodded with an unreadable expression in his eyes.

"Indeed..."

Seeing the Yu Family members descending before the

Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation, Yu Xiaogui said softly, "Before my grandfather killed his brother and mother, I was still part of the Jiang Family."




# Chapter 342: Besieging the Mountain

"Brother!"

Fei Tongxiao bent down, gripping his brother's hand tightly. "Three hundred years ago, when our ancestor was killed while traveling, our family was in peril. But then, a disciple from the immortal mansion fought fiercely and subdued the Jiang Family, allowing all the families into seclusion for a hundred years. A little over a century ago, even when our family was in decline, there were still five families that divided the Jiang Family, giving us a respite..." he said in a deep voice.

"These events are precisely why our ancestors strove so hard, elevating our family to the status of a prominent clan! We cannot speak of giving up lightly!" Fei Tongxiao said as he gritted his teeth, his eyes brimming with tears.

"We are not yet at a dead end. We must not give up! Have you forgotten, Brother..." he continued, his tone resolute this time.

"Go, seek out the Li Family."

Hearing these words, Fei Tongyu finally straightened up, composing himself. However, he suddenly felt a tremor. Being a cultivator at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, he managed to steady himself, but his expression turned grim.

"What is happening?!" Fei Tongxiao exclaimed. He was equally alarmed and he was just about to speak when the doors of the ancestral hall burst open.

A middle-aged man in white robes entered, saying in a grave tone, "The Yu Family has surrounded Glacial Cloud Peak!"

"What?!"

Fei Tongyu froze, his expression changing dramatically as he said anxiously, "Notify the Li Family... No... I'm afraid that..."

"It's too late." The middle-aged man, with a gentle demeanor and at the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, was the only surviving brother of Fei Wangbai. His face still bore signs of grief as he continued softly, "The Yu Family has completely encircled Glacial Cloud Peak... Not even a bug can get out!"

Fei Tongyu and Fei Tongxiao exchanged a glance with each other. Fei Tongxiao took a deep breath, calming his deep feelings of unease, and said firmly, "The Yu Family is making a huge commotion... The Li Family will surely notice. Our Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation is a top-tier formation; the Yu Family cannot break through easily! If the Li Family intends to save us, it's not over for us."

Fei Tongyu, however, stared at his younger brother and whispered, "But... what if they have no intention to save us?"

Boom!

A massive jade mountain struck the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation on Glacial Cloud Peak, causing yet another powerful tremor. Fei Tongyu steadied himself, and with a look of madness in his eyes he yelled, "Yu Mugao is no ordinary person... Daring to attack our family like this, he must have prepared to stall the Li Family, even Li Tongya himself! It might already be too late!"

Tears welled in his eyes as he lamented, "The wolves surround us on the lake... Since Grandfather's death, our fate has been sealed. This is not like a century or three centuries ago... We are besieged by wolves in front of us and tigers behind us!"

"It seems that Fei Wangbai is truly dead."

Yu Mugao gazed at the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation on Glacial Cloud Peak, watching the radiant light flowing within it. He had waited for the time it took for an entire incense stick to burn, yet Fei Wangbai had not appeared.

Beside him, Yu Xiaogui, the Yu Family's ancestor, had a complex expression on his face as he murmured, "How could this be?!"

Yu Xiaogui had been in conflict with Fei Wangbai for decades before Yu Mugao took over the family. Their encounters had resulted in mixed outcomes, and Yu Xiaogui had always found Fei Wangbai both troublesome and formidable, relying on the strength of the Yu Family to gain a slight upper hand over them.

Now, with such a figure suddenly declared dead, it gave Yu Xiaogui a sense of disbelief. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, gazing intensely at Glacial Cloud Peak below.

"A free gift like this feels like a trap..." he muttered.

"Heh!"

Yu Mugao let out a cold laugh, having anticipated this outcome. He replied, "When Chi Zhiyan came to Moongaze Lake to recruit, he hinted that Fei Wangbai had blocked the path of some prodigy or Purple Mansion Realm cultivator within the sect. His ill fate was sealed, and it was only a matter of time before he met his end."

Yu Xiaogui felt a slight chill upon hearing this, a sense of shared fate and foreboding creeping into his bones. He muttered, "The Foundation Establishment Realm is already a path of extreme difficulty, with only one in a million achieving it... To discover at the end that you practiced the wrong method and formed the wrong immortal foundation, and end up as fodder facing death... Fei Wangbai was cultivating peacefully on the lake. How... how did he end up blocking someone's path?"

"Who knows?" Yu Mugao said as he shook his head slowly with a hint of desolation.

"Divine abilities involving fate are intricate matters... Without being a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, one cannot see clearly. Like sparrows blind to the eagle's vision, the various families are groping in the dark, being used by others unknowingly."

The Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven was an ancient formation, capable of withstanding Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Yu Xiaogui and his entourage surrounded Glacial Cloud Peak, observing the pristine white formation beneath their feet. Various spells from the Yu Family cultivators fell upon the formation, only to dissipate.

"The Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation is indeed a top-tier formation..." Yu Mugao praised, watching the flames and ice conjured by the Yu Family cultivators vanish into nothing upon contacting the formation.

"It surpasses our Jade Court Guarding Formation from back when our market was thriving. With such a grand formation, it is no wonder the Fei Family could dominate the northern shore for so many years," he remarked.

Yu Xiaogui struck the pristine white formation with both palms, but the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation remained unmoved. He snorted coldly then flicked his sleeve, from which a small jade mountain flew out.

"Jade Smoke Mountain!"

The Yu Family's treasured artifact expanded in the wind, quickly growing to the height of a person. The lifelike cranes and ancient trees on it appeared vividly as it pressed down on the Fei Family's formation, emitting a series of dull thuds.

However, the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation merely shimmered slightly as its intricate patterns glowed even brighter now. No matter how many times the Jade Smoke Mountain struck, the formation remained unmoved.

"Invoke!" Yu Xiaogui commanded as he nodded slightly, performing a hand seal. His Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation surged, and his immortal foundation activated immediately. The Jade Smoke Mountain in the air began to spin rapidly, growing larger and larger until it was the size of a small hill.

The cranes on it raised their heads and cried out as the ancient trees stretched vigorously. Mist swirled around, as if to descend.

"Ha!"

Yu Xiaogui's face reddened slightly, and the Jade Smoke Mountain fell abruptly onto the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation, producing thunderous roars this time. The Fei Family members inside the formation looked terrified and at an utter loss while the Yu Family members outside cheered.

Boom...!

The Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation finally showed some weakness. The thick light shield fluctuated, rippling like waves in a pond before quickly calming down.

"A fine formation indeed!" Yu Xiaogui remarked as he exhaled deeply. The Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation was renowned, and he had not expected to break it by force, but merely to test its strength. He gently raised his hand, and the Jade Smoke Mountain shrank rapidly, spinning in the air before returning to the size of a fist. It obediently flew back into his sleeve.

"No rush..." Yu Mugao muttered, picking out a dozen people from the guest cultivators and Yu Family cultivators. They descended to the foot of the mountain, casting spells to control the earth veins.

"Although the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation is formidable, it consumes energy like a whale swallowing water... We only need to influence and affect the earth veins and attack in turns, increasing the Fei Family's consumption of energy. If we hold out here for a while, the Fei Family will be exhausted within half a month."

"But delays may bring changes..." Yu Xiaogui said in concern as his expression turned gloomy, and he watched the busy Yu Family members below him. The northern wind over the lake grew stronger, and the rolling sea of clouds receded, leaving the sky clear. He absentmindedly raised his head to look at the white dot on the horizon.




# Chapter 343: One Strike

Yu Xiaogui squinted into the distance. The dark green lake water mirrored the cloudless sky while flashes of lightning and rumbling thunder from the island in the lake occasionally illuminated large swathes of the water. A white dot appeared in the distance, floating gently into view.

As the figure drew nearer, Yu Xiaogui could briefly make out a white-robed man who was holding a sword, and seemed to be walking on air. The water beneath his feet churned violently, transforming into serpent dragons and sea beasts of various forms, all surrounding him as he approached slowly and steadily.

"Father! Father!" Yu Mugao called out several times but saw that Yu Xiaogui remained still, staring at the horizon with a grim expression. His fists were clenched tightly together, and his lips were pressed together in solemn silence.

Yu Mugao felt a wave of intense foreboding wash over him instantly. He quickly followed his father's gaze but saw nothing.

"Father!"

Yu Xiaogui's aura surged, his sleeve flapping wildly in the wind, emitting a faint glow of mana. He gritted his teeth.

"Li Tongya..." he mumbled, his voice laced with a trace of fear.

"Li Tongya?! He's here?!"

Yu Mugao looked as though he had been struck by lightning, his face turning deathly pale. His eyes widened and he froze in midair. He opened his mouth but no words escaped his lips, and he was left mumbling to himself.

"How is this possible? How?! Absolutely impossible! Impossible... Something has happened to Li Tongya, it couldn't be him!"

The sky gradually darkened as the scattered clouds from the north gathered. Fine drizzle began to fall, and Yu Mugao, still wide-eyed, finally caught sight of the white-robed figure approaching from across the lake.

The man walked on air, accompanied by serpent dragons and sea beasts. The waters of Moongaze Lake surged upward, and deep green serpent dragons with vivid expressions obediently crawled at his feet. He wore a simple white robe, with long eyebrows, a thin face, broad shoulders, and an imposing presence. He held a sword in his arms, its blade hidden within its scabbard.

"It is raining... It should not be raining at this time... It never rains on the northern shore..."

The Yu Family cultivators all looked up at the sky. The cold rain struck their faces and the somber, oppressive atmosphere left them stunned, causing them to cease their actions and look toward the shore.

"Celestial Moon Sword Li Tongya!"

"Ancestor of the Li Family... Foundation Establishment Realm Sword Cultivator Li Tongya!"

All eyes from both families locked onto the man clad in white. They whispered among themselves, full of fear. Thirty-six Qi Cultivators and over a hundred Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators were instantly cowed by his aura, finding themselves unable to move.

"It is raining..."

Li Tongya, holding his sword, stood on the shore, reaching out to catch the falling raindrops. The drops were cold and piercing but did not turn to frost. Instead, they fell one by one, steadily.

Li Tongya rarely wore white robes, but the effects of the Huashang Fruit in his stomach caused his true essence to surge, and his battle spirit was becoming hard to contain. He had never felt this good before and, in his rare enthusiasm, chose to wear flowing white robes.

His immortal foundation was unstable, and his cultivation continuously leaked away. Relying on this precious medicinal fruit that had healed his meridians and sea of qi, he had temporarily pushed himself to an unprecedented peak, even influencing the natural phenomena with the aura of his Boundless Ocean, exhibiting the majesty of a peak Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator.

In the sky, Yu Xiaogui's eyes were filled with fear. For a moment, he did not know what to say. He extended his spiritual sense cautiously toward Li Tongya, only to feel an endless vastness akin to the sea—almost overwhelming him.

"What kind of cultivation is this... mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm? Late-stage? How is that possible?!"

Just by merely standing by the shore, Li Tongya had already induced changes in the weather. Coupled with his reputation for slaying the Maha, Yu Xiaogui's heart wavered, and he almost considered retreating.

"Senior Yu," Li Tongya began as he looked up at him, his bright eyes filled with calmness. He gently stepped forward, ascending the sky step by step as he approached the Yu Family members. His tone remained as neutral and firm as when he had encountered Fei Wangbai and Yu Xiaogui at a lake banquet while he was a Qi Cultivator at the seventh heavenly layer.

"It has been a long time..."

The efficacy of the Huashang Fruit spread through his internal organs, causing the wrinkles on his face to fade. His white hair had turned black, cascading down his back gracefully.

Li Tongya's appearance gradually changed from that of a worried elderly man to the dignified demeanor of a middle-aged man, before slowly returning to that of a handsome and spirited look of a sixteen-year-old. This youthful visage had long been buried in the archives of his life... never shown to others.

Back then, he had not yet embarked on immortal cultivation. He worked from dawn to dusk, often harvesting wheat in the fields at sunrise, sweating in the morning mist with a cheerful smile. Li Xiangping chattered incessantly by his side while his elder brother Li Changhu sat on the ridge of the field, laughing cheerfully.

"G-Greetings, fellow Daoist..." Yu Xiaogui mumbled as he swallowed hard, feeling the overwhelming pressure emanating from Li Tongya. His fear was indescribable, and even speaking made him tremble in utter fear.

Looking at Li Tongya, now appearing as a sixteen-year-old youth, Yu Xiaogui seemed to see a dormant viper finally baring its fangs or a guarding eagle unburdened. Just standing silently in the air, Li Tongya was like a suspended white immortal sword, making Yu Xiaogui's hair stand on end.

Li Tongya snapped back to the present, his gaze sweeping over the Yu Family members. He spoke gently, "The Fei Family is without fault. Please withdraw your forces."

These words, domineering and indisputable, came from Li Tongya's mouth like a long sword's cry, instilling fear and unease among the Yu Family instantly. Yu Xiaogui's face turned red, yet he dared not utter a single word of defiance.

Hidden within his sleeves, Yu Xiaogui's hands trembled uncontrollably. The air was so heavy it felt like it could drip water at any second. The Yu Family cultivators quietly stowed away their dharma artifacts, exchanging anxious glances, when suddenly a man's voice roared, breaking the tense silence.

"He is bluffing! Attack!"

"Li Tongya! You are bluffing! You cannot possibly leave here unscathed! Cast your spells! What are you all staring at? Cast your spells!"

The voice was hysterical, cold, and impatient, erupting in the dead silence above Glacial Cloud Peak, jolting everyone. Yu Mugao's bloodshot eyes widened in fury, his voice cracking with intensity as he screamed, "Li Tongya! It is impossible! Stop pretending!"

Li Tongya remained indifferent, quietly staring at him. Yu Xiaogui, jolted by his son's outburst, also began to break free from the overwhelming pressure and trance. Greed surged in his eyes, along with a dangerous glint of hope. He gritted his teeth and sneered, "Glacial Cloud Peak is ours for the taking... Forgive me, fellow Daoist!"

With that, he flicked his sleeve, and the fist-sized Jade Smoke Mountain floated out lightly. In the wind, it expanded into a small mountain and came crashing down with all its might.

Whoosh!

Li Tongya's white robe fluttered in the wind. Facing the looming Jade Smoke Mountain, his face broke into a gentle smile, and the Qingche Sword in his arms unsheathed by one chi.

Clang!

A white-green light burst from the peak of Glacial Cloud Peak. The world grew dim and dark, and fine drizzle continued falling. The light was so intense that it was almost blinding.

A bright white-green moon appeared over the northern shore.

Boom——!

The heavy Jade Smoke Mountain, meant to suppress spells, paused for just a moment before the rush of sword energy sent it spinning. It crashed heavily into the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation, shaking the entire Glacial Cloud Peak.

"What?!"
𝕗𝐫𝚎𝗲𝘄𝐞𝕓𝐧𝕠𝘃𝕖𝐥.𝐜𝚘𝚖

The Jade Smoke Mountain, now reduced to the size of a fist, spun in the air like a deflated ball. Yu Xiaogui was struck by immense misfortune. Even before the sword qi arrived, the backlash from the artifact had him spewing blood from his mouth. He cried out, "Mercy, fellow Daoist!!"

Yu Xiaogui quickly slapped his storage pouch, releasing three Foundation Establishment Realm talismans he had accumulated over the years. They transformed into three shields of gold and white as sword qi slashed through all three effortlessly before lightly landing on his waist, splitting him in two with frightful ease.

"FATHER!"

Chaos immediately erupted among the Yu Family members present. Yu Mugao was struck with horror, his vision filled with white-green sword light. It was not until Yu Xiaogui's agonized screams brought him back to reality that he quickly caught his father's two halves, using mana to stop the bleeding and rejoin them frantically.

"Spare me, fellow Daoist! Spare me!"

Yu Xiaogui's vision was also filled with white-green light. He repeatedly begged for mercy, as if he had lost his soul. Li Tongya simply watched silently as the Yu Family members attempted to rescue him.

He lifted the sword in his hand gently, sending chills down the spines of everyone on Glacial Cloud Peak and making the backs of their necks feel cold.




# Chapter 344: Retreat

Silence.

The only sounds left on Glacial Cloud Peak were the faint rustle of falling snowflakes and the drip-drop of rain. Cyan-white light flowed over the scene, filling everyone's eyes.

Yu Mugao was speechless, his face as white as paper.

The impact of the scene before him was overwhelming. The Yu Family's treasured legacy, the Foundation Establishment Realm artifact Jade Smoke Mountain, hovered in the air, returning to its original form, spinning quietly and harmlessly.

Yu Xiaogui had ceased his wailing, his eyes tightly shut, his face ashen.

Between Yu Mugao's trembling hands, mana glowed as he tried to mend the ghastly wound on his father's waist in futility. The sword wound was smooth and clean, and Yu Mugao, completely occupied in maintaining his father's life force, dared not lift his head.

In the sky, Li Tongya stood with his sword, his gaze sharp and silent. The Yu Family below remained muted in deadly silence. After a few breaths, the silence was broken by clear jingling sounds as the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators on the ground finally broke free from the sword light's hold, dropping their artifacts in panic. The mortals were even worse off, throwing down their weapons and kneeling, chaos erupting once more.

Li Tongya's gaze remained calm as he swallowed the blood rising to his throat, not daring to move. Though this strike had taken a toll on him, he stood still, dealing with the after-effects silently, refusing to show any signs of fatigue.

The suppressive force of the Jade Smoke Mountain roiled in his wrist while his qihai acupoint churned violently. His cultivation leaked away as if through a broken vessel, leaving his limbs stiff and immobile.

The mana from the Huashang Fruit clashed fiercely with his true essence, causing the Boundless Ocean within him to rage wildly. Blood welled up in his mouth several times, and his vision grew hazy, his chest tight and breathless.

Just then, light beams emerged from the depths of his Sea of Qi—a white orb glowing brilliantly, illuminating his entire qihai acupoint.

"The Profound Pearl Talisman Seed..."

The talisman seed's light suppressed the turmoil within his Sea of Qi, allowing Li Tongya a moment's respite. A glint of brilliance flashed in his eyes as he sheathed his sword.

Ching!

The clear sound of the sword being sheathed brought relief to the cultivators around him. They exchanged glances, realizing they were all drenched in cold sweat, their nerves on edge.

Li Tongya, with his flowing black hair and handsome features, seemed nonchalant, as if the strike had been effortless. Still holding his sword, he spoke politely and warmly, "Out of respect for Yuanwu Peak and Yu Muxian, I will overlook your transgressions."

His bright, clear eyes showed no hint of malice, but no one from the Yu Family dared to meet his gaze. Li Tongya repeated softly, "Please withdraw your forces."

Yu Mugao carefully lifted his unconscious father, his gaze sweeping over Li Tongya's wind-whipped white robe and the white-green sword light flashing in his mind. He ascended into the air slowly, stopping just before Li Tongya.

"Thank you for your mercy... Senior."

It seemed that Yu Mugao had come to terms with the shock now. Tears still streaked his face as he glanced at Li Tongya one last time before whispering, "Retreat!"

The Yu Family members, feeling as though they had been granted a reprieve, hurriedly followed him southward, not daring to look back. Cheers erupted on Glacial Cloud Peak as men and women embraced, weeping with joy.

Yu Mugao kept his eyes on his pale father until they were out of Fei Family's territory. Only then did Yu Xiaogui open his eyes, his voice hoarse as he said in a low voice, "This was your idea."

Yu Mugao looked at his weakened father, knowing his life was hanging by a thread and his cultivation path was likely severed. He lowered his head, silent.

Yu Xiaogui struggled to stand, shaking off his son's support. Yu Mugao sighed deeply, "Li Tongya likely had only one strike left, but I dared not gamble anymore!"

His figure was desolate and lonely, like a gambler who had lost everything. The Yu Family members nearby shivered at his words, exchanging glances and remaining silent.

————

"What a pity..."

Li Tongya's internal state was already in chaos, barely maintaining a balance. Fortunately, the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed shone brightly, forcefully helping him sustain his present condition.

Holding his sword, Li Tongya slowly descended, watching the retreating figures of the Yu Family members as he murmured to himself, "Yu Mugao is a great threat to my family... It is a pity that I no longer have the strength to strike; otherwise, I would definitely kill him, even if it meant giving Yuanwu Peak and Yu Muxian an excuse to act against us."

He had run out of strength, barely clinging to life in his cave dwelling. Li Yuanjiao had reported the situation, and Li Tongya understood that he had no choice but to act.

"If I ignore the Fei Family, our Li Family will be next. Once Yu Mugao has no more scruples, combined with his cunning and ruthless methods, there will be even greater disasters..."

Li Tongya had left his cave, deliberately building up his aura and riding on a sea beast conjured from his mana, hoping to intimidate the Yu Family and avoid a confrontation.

Originally, the timing and setting were perfect. The natural phenomena stirred by his cultivation had already intimidated everyone, even Yu Xiaogui, who was frightened by his reputation for having slain a Maha.

But Yu Mugao's loud shout woke everyone up, prompting Yu Xiaogui to test the waters. Li Tongya's cultivation was powerful but once unleashed, it drained rapidly like a river bursting its banks.

Li Tongya continued to watch the Yu Family as they disappeared into the horizon, then finally shifted his gaze to the intricate patterns on the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation, admiring it silently.

The Yu Family fled in disarray, allowing the Fei Family to finally breathe a sigh of relief. However, when the man in the sky turned his gaze upon them, their anxiety returned, and they looked at each other in fear.

Fei Tongxiao was terrified, staring intently at the black-haired youth holding a cyan-white longsword in the sky. Although the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation isolated the inside from the outside, he vaguely heard some words but still could not believe his eyes.

"Did the Yu Family say... this is Li Tongya?"

The youth's eyes were bright, his face handsome, his posture tall. The sword light from Li Tongya's weapon hurt Fei Tongxiao's eyes. He said with mixed emotions, "Who is he..?"

"Li Yuanyun?... No... Li Yuanyun has no spiritual orifice... This really is Li Tongya!"

Fei Tongyu had once seen Li Tongya from a distance at the Li Family. However, Li Tongya already sported a mature appearance when he had gained some fame, so now he could not recognize him at once, guessing to himself, "Perhaps Li Tongya gained some unknown benefits from slaying the Maha, causing his cultivation to soar and making him youthful again... This is not unprecedented in Jiangnan."

While the brothers were at a loss for words, Li Tongya gathered his mana and said warmly, "Li Tongya is here to pay respects; please open the formation!"

The two brothers were stunned, exchanged glances for a few moments, and both saw the apprehension in each other's eyes. The same doubt arose in their minds, and they spoke in unison.

"To open... Or not to open?"




# Chapter 345: Reverent Welcome

The snow and rain on Glacial Cloud Peak fell lightly upon the white-robed youth, whose bright eyes were fixed on the intricate patterns of the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation.

The Fei brothers did not keep Li Tongya waiting for long. Within just a few breaths, the dazzling light of the formation began to fade, and a man emerged from within.

This man had a kind face that bore some resemblance to Fei Wangbai and was at the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. He rode the wind and approached Li Tongya, bowing deeply with a humble demeanor.

"Junior Fei Wangjiang greets Senior! Your act of repulsing Yu Xiaogui and saving our family is a great favor we will never forget..."

Li Tongya waved his hand in response and said, "Daoist Wangbai and I are good friends... It is only natural for our families to help each other."

Fei Wangjiang, though middle-aged, showed utmost respect to Li Tongya who looked sixteen or seventeen years old in appearance. He led Li Tongya respectfully to the mountaintop where numerous members of the Fei Family had already gathered.

From aged elders to young children, all kneeled tearfully and cried out in unison, "Welcome, Ancestor..."

Li Tongya stepped aside, still holding his sword, and moved forward. Two young men approached. The older one in a gray robe appeared around twenty-five or twenty-six, with an anxious expression on his handsome face. He kneeled and bowed deeply, saying, "Junior Fei Tongyu greets the ancestor!"

Li Tongya's gaze swept over the sorrowful faces of the Fei Family. Once a distinguished clan in their elegant white robes, now they were filled with grief and devoid of spirit.

"Rise."

Only then did he notice that the traditionally white-clad Fei Family had hastily changed into gray robes. The children's clothes were carelessly wrapped, indicating that they had all changed quickly to avoid clashing with his white robe.

"On my way here... I did not see Daoist Wangbai..." Li Tongya began, though he already knew the answer.

"The ancestor... he... he has passed away!"

At the mention of Fei Wangbai, the Fei Family began to sob hysterically. Fei Tongyu, fearing they might disturb Li Tongya, quickly led him into the courtyard.

Li Tongya stood holding his sword as Fei Tongyu explained the circumstances of Fei Wangbai's death in detail. After he had explained, he respectfully bowed, took a step forward, and gently pushed open the dark coffin.

Creaaaak...

A soft light illuminated Fei Wangbai's dignified face. Fei Tongyu had meticulously arranged his clothes, making him look as though he were merely sleeping. Li Tongya moved the white cloth aside carefully and stared at the horrific wound.

"What are the Patterned Brocade's Dao Partners?" Li Tongya asked gently.

Fei Tongyu hesitated, as the clan's immortal foundation secrets were usually closely guarded. However, Li Tongya had just saved the family, and their lives were now in his hands.

Reluctantly, he replied, "Records mention Jade Court General, Green Jade Cliff, and True Dao Unification... As for the others, we do not know."

"Jade Court General..."

A realization dawned on Li Tongya. The immortal foundations of the lake's families were indeed of the same nature. It was no surprise that Yu Yufeng had been killed first, followed by Fei Wangbai a few years later...

The deep, meaningful look in Fei Wangbai's eyes during the banquet hosted by the Yu Family still lingered in his mind. Now, that same person lay cold and lifeless.

Li Tongya felt a chill down his spine and thought to himself,

The Boundless Ocean from River One Qi Technique and the Jade Court General from Aged Courtly Path Scripture must be practiced sparingly. Even if successfully cultivated, they should not be used to establish a Dao foundation...

Xiao Chuting, who has good relations with our family, mentioned that many techniques from Lingyu Gate were spread around when it fell. Many practiced Boundless Ocean, which is relatively safe, but Jade Court General must be avoided!

Fei Tongyu, mistaking his silence for contemplation, stepped forward with tears in his eyes and said, "Our family has operated on the northern shore for many years, dealing with the three sects and seven gates, as well as several forces in Xu State... Yet, we cannot fathom the origin of the culprit!"

"Yue State has no major sect that uses swords! There are only a few sword cultivators within the three sects and seven gates... but Changxiao Gate is grand and magnificent, Golden Tang Gate is sharp and unparalleled, and Purple Smoke Gate moves like a long rainbow. None of them fit..."

Fei Tongyu felt anxious and hopeful as he looked at Li Tongya, his heart filled with hatred like a raging river but found no place to release these strong emotions of his. All he hoped for at that moment was to get a definite answer from Li Tongya.

In private discussions with his brother, Fei Tongyu had gone through various possibilities, even suspecting Li Chejing from the southern border. However, he had heard that Li Chejing's sword was bright like moonlight and gentle like the breeze, which did not match either.

"Could it be that our ancestor inadvertently offended some Foundation Establishment Realm rogue cultivator..."

Li Tongya listened to Fei Tongyu's tearful recount and then gently raised his hand, brushing past the wound on Fei Wangbai's neck. He then pinched out a faint white sword light, as if picking up a swimming fish.

This sword light had its own consciousness and constantly struggled in his hand, but was unable to escape. Li Tongya combined his two fingers and took two breaths to extinguish it.

"This person's swordsmanship is superior to mine."

Li Tongya slowly closed his eyes, recalling the people from the three sects and seven gates he had seen at Xiao Chuting's gathering, and murmured, "Ethereal and transcendent, yet full of life."

He suddenly paused, exhaled a long breath, then turned to Fei Tongyu and said gently, "This person believes your family absolutely cannot identify him, so he only killed Daoist Wangbai."

Fei Tongyu, although somewhat weak in character, was not a fool. Hearing Li Tongya's words, his heart sank.

"I understand..." he croaked hoarsely.

As they conversed, Fei Wangbai's body and head in the coffin, now no longer hindered by sword qi, slowly rejoined, and his dull eyes gradually opened.

Li Tongya and Fei Tongyu were not surprised by this. A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator's body, nourished by immortal foundations, was extraordinary, comparable to that of a spirit item. If left in the dark for a long time, it might even develop some unusual phenomena.

"How does your clan plan to handle Daoist Wangbai's body?" Li Tongya asked softly.

Fei Tongyu respectfully raised his head and answered, "Our family has always practiced the Patterned Brocade. Three ancestors have successively achieved Foundation Establishment Realm, so there are precedents. In the first three years, the Patterned Brocade causes the cultivator's teeth, hair, and nails to fall off, turning into jade, while the eyes become cinnabar. In the next three years, the flesh turns into silk and brocade, and the internal organs turn into gold and silver... After another three years, everything else turns into mercury, leaving nothing behind."
𝒻𝘳ℯℯ𝑤ℯ𝒷𝘯ℴ𝓋ℯ𝘭.𝑐ℴ𝑚

Li Tongya nodded slightly, his handsome face thoughtful. He had heard of these transformations in his many years of cultivation. Fei Tongyu continued respectfully, "Then we follow the tradition of placing everything in a jade box to be worshiped by the clan."

"It is fine as long as there is a precedent." Li Tongya nodded. After all, he had a friendship with Fei Wangbai. Knowing the Fei Family's current predicament, he was worried they might misuse Fei Wangbai's body for something unsavory. Hearing Fei Tongyu's explanation, he felt greatly relieved.

He closed the coffin, took two steps down, bowed respectfully again, and said softly, "Come in."

As he spoke, the courtyard door creaked open automatically, and Fei Wangjiang and Fei Tongxiao entered together, both bowing respectfully.

"We are here!"

Fei Tongyu's heart raced with anxiety, waiting for Li Tongya to speak. His hand clenched and unclenched a talisman in his sleeve, knowing it was a joke to Li Tongya but feeling a deep sense of despair in his heart.

If the Fei Family perishes today, there must be bloodshed. As the head of the family, I must commit suicide to apologize to the clan... My brother Tongxiao is far more talented than I am. With him protecting the family, they may have a chance to rise again in a hundred years...




# Chapter 346: Long Whale Under the Waning Moon

Fei Tongyu crouched in deep thought, his heart racing. He was prepared for violence, but he had not expected Li Tongya to speak in such a warm voice.

"Brother Wangbai and I have been friends for many years... It's a shame to see him go. Watch over your clan well with your brother. If anyone from the minor sect dares to challenge you due to your youth and shallow cultivation, you can send someone to the southern shore to find me."

Although it sounded like advice from an elder, it also sounded like words deliberately spoken for Fei Wangjiang to hear. There was no demand or expectation of tributes. Instead, Li Tongya conveyed a genuine concern, leaving the two brothers momentarily stunned.

After saying that, Li Tongya rose gracefully from his seat.

"Now that this matter is settled, I'll take my leave."

"I..."

Fei Tongyu was at an utter loss for words, and he could not believe his ears. He paused, then dropped to his knees as he watched Li Tongya soar into the air.

"Thank you, Ancestor! Your kindness will be remembered by the Fei Family for generations...!" he cried out with great emotion in his voice.

The young man in white departed with his sword, leaving Fei Tongyu kneeling in gratitude. He glanced at his younger brother in relief and sighed deeply.

"I misjudged him with my narrow perspective," he said.

"Li Tongya... He remembers old favors and does not exploit others' vulnerabilities... Our family owes him a great debt now!" Fei Tongxiao's said as his voice quivered with emotion.

Fei Tongyu stood, dusting his knees. Hope flickered in his eyes again, and a smile spread across his face for the first time in months.

"Li Qinghong practiced spearmanship too... Back then, she never managed to learn a secret technique when she was training with our family. I guess I'll send over the Dragon Reflection manual to the Li Family in a few days, as a gesture of gratitude for his unexpected kindness..."

Fei Tongxiao's eyes flickered with a strange gleam as he nodded and said, "Yes. Unfortunately, our family is going through hardship now... We'll have to repay this debt slowly."

Beside them, Fei Wangjiang stood silently like a sturdy pine tree. Fei Tongxiao turned to him and respectfully asked, "Granduncle, do you still have Cold Pine Snow Qi at home?"

Fei Wangjiang gazed at him and replied warmly, "There's a portion left."

Sensing that Fei Tongxiao was up to something, Fei Tongyu quickly warned, "What are you up to? The Six White Jade Chakras you condensed through training the Long Brocade Heart Sutra during the Embryonic Breathing Realm stage are unique, you cannot just switch to another cultivation method!"

Fei Tongxiao's shook his head slowly, his gaze unwavering, his lips forming into a firm line before he spoke.

"I'll disperse my cultivation and start anew!"

────

Li Tongya rode the wind back to Mount Lijing. The sky was dark, and he swept his eyes over scattered lights in the town at the foot of the mountain before turning toward his cave dwelling.

The stone door of the cave was ajar. A young man clad in black sat cross-legged on the steps, waiting silently.

Li Tongya cleared his throat softly, rousing him from his reverie. Li Yuanjiao opened his eyes abruptly, freezing as he beheld the young man dressed in white before him. He had a handsome face with angular features and a pair of eyes that gleamed like bright stars as he stared intently at Li Yuanjiao.

After a few moments of silence, Li Yuanjiao asked hesitantly, "You're... the Old Ancestor?"

Li Tongya chuckled lightly and nodded.

"I have rescued the Fei Family and returned from the northern shore... Yu Xiaogui's Dao has been severed by me and he's in a critical condition. He's no longer a concern to us anymore."

"Old Ancestor! You've... recovered?!"

Li Yuanjiao's relief was evident in his eager gaze, but Li Tongya shook his head gently.

"With this victory, peace has returned to the lake. Fei Tongyu, though not as talented as Fei Wangbai, deeply acknowledges their debt to my family..." he began.

"Although Yu Mugao is cunning and shrewd, his talent is mediocre. With his reputation severely damaged and his actions becoming increasingly petty and unreasonable, the absence of Yu Xiaogui's influence will surely give him headaches."

Li Tongya's black hair fluttered in the breeze, lending him a carefree aura.

"The Yu Family lacks a capable successor. With you and Qinghong showing great promise in reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, in less than sixty years, our family will dominate this region."

Li Tongya's unusually talkative demeanor caused Li Yuanjiao to feel deeply uneasy. Nevertheless, Li Tongya gestured for him to join him, sitting together on the steps.

"Although Fei Wangbai has passed, the Fei Family still boasts nine Qi Cultivators. They are far stronger than our family and their Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation is extremely formidable. I fear that after my time, maintaining control may prove challenging, possibly reverting power back to the Yu Family... Hence, I did the Fei Family a favor, so that we can form alliances with them," Li Tongya explained patiently.

"The situation in this region fluctuates, determined not by immediate strength but by strategic maneuvers of multiple parties. If we seek to expand northward, we must navigate these dynamics carefully to avoid discord and unnecessary conflicts," he advised.

Li Yuanjiao understood this as he had the same discussion in detail with Li Tongya before. He nodded and replied, "Jiao'er understands..."

Li Tongya paused briefly before continuing, "To the north lies the Fei Family, to the east the Yu Family, and to the west a rogue Foundation Establishment cultivator named He. He may not meddle in worldly affairs and is focused solely on his cultivation, but we must remain vigilant."

"Understood," Li Yuanjiao replied as he nodded.

Li Tongya stood up with his sword in his arms and slowly ascended the steps.

"I will enter seclusion now. The cave door will remain tightly shut for the next five years," he announced.
𝕗𝐫𝐞𝕖𝕨𝐞𝗯𝚗𝕠𝘃𝐞𝚕.𝐜𝗼𝚖

With that, the ancient formation in the cave dwelling activated almost right away, and the moss-covered stone door began to close slowly.

Creak...

Li Yuanjiao raised his head and watched as Li Tongya retreated back into his cave dwelling. The stone door closed with a loud rumble while Li Tongya's warm voice echoed softly in the air.

"Do not forget the grievances of the clan."

Li Yuanjiao swung his sleeves and quickly fell to his knees, pressing his forehead to the ground three times in worship.

As the stone door finally slammed shut, only then did Li Yuanjiao slowly rise. With a solemn look on his face and slightly reddened eyes, he quietly swore, "Jiao dares not forget..."

Behind the closed door, Li Tongya paused briefly, listening to Li Yuanjiao's solemn affirmation.

He surveyed the neat and orderly cave dwelling before settling into his usual seat. Preparing some ink and a brush, he left a few writings on the stone table before moving to his bed and sat down cross-legged.

"The fox has wasted its efforts... The injury has already scattered my immortal foundation and severed my vitality."

Li Tongya gazed northward with a smile spreading across his handsome face. It was as if the past sixty years had left no trace upon him.

He continued, murmuring warmly, "For over seventy years, I've strived to lead the clan, quell external threats, and bring peace to Mount Yue... Now, I can die with dignity, feeling safe and content. My life has been one of profound contentment, with nothing more to desire."

He rested his chin on his hands and exhaled softly. His flowing black hair cascaded down his back, and the sparkle in his eyes slowly faded. The Qingche Sword in his arms let out a faint cry while Astral Qi within the cave surged, accompanied by gentle murmurs.

After the space of three breaths, a shiny white pill emerged before his body. It hovered briefly in the air before vanishing into the void.

His face retained its youthful appearance from when he was sixteen, his white clothes pristine without a single crease on it. He smiled with his eyes closed as if he were only deep in thought.

Rumble!

The sound of running rivers filled the void. Dewdrops seeped from the cave floor, creating a tinkling spring-like melody. The howling of the winter wind grew louder but the cave dwelling remained tightly sealed.

The energy of his Boundless Ocean caused a phenomenon atop Mount Lijing. The once clear sky quickly darkened with clouds as thunder rumbled, and light rain began to drizzle across the earth.

"It's raining!"

Fine autumn drizzle blanketed Lijing Town. Farmers raised their heads to welcome the refreshing shower while vendors covered their carts with umbrellas, and the carriages of prominent families rolled leisurely through the streets.

The stone paths on the streets at the foot of the mountain grew slick with rain. Dogs barked softly, children played and laughed, and a newlywed woman deliberated over spending a copper coin to buy fabric for a new dress.

Li Tongya passed silently in the cave dwelling. His immortal foundation had crumbled, his vitality spent. Yet to the world outside the cave, the weather was merely a little cold today but the gentle rain was soothing and pleasant.

Such refreshing autumn rain was a rare delight indeed.




# Chapter 347: Tributes On The Lake

"Yu Mugao looked incredibly arrogant, clad in fluttering black attire and wielding a divine weapon. He taunted, "The phoenix resides in the parasol tree~ Do you dare to descend, little cultivator?"

The tavern buzzed with activity as the audience craned their necks to hear better. Throngs surrounded a man clothed in gray at the center of the room, who stroked his goatee as he performed.

"An Jingming, a top-notch immortal talent, scoffed and retorted loudly, I am blessed with the bones of an immortal; favored by the heavens! How dare you, an insignificant centipede, refer to yourself as a parasol tree in my presence~"

As soon as the gray-clothed man had finished speaking those words, the crowd erupted into shouts and applause. He smirked, stroking his beard, evidently pleased with his own performance.

At the edge of the crowd stood a boy of about eleven or twelve, dressed in a leather coat with snow-white fur around the cuffs. It was easy to tell that he was the scion of a wealthy noble family.

Though everyone's attention was not focused on him, they nonetheless were aware enough to leave a space enough for him to stand. The boy held the hand of a younger child, around five or six years old, who looked clever and beautiful.

"Brother Xizhi! An Jingming sure is popular," the boy chirped in his tender voice.

The noble-looking teenage boy beside him simply waved his sleeve and chuckled.

"An Jingming was a remarkable talent who had performed countless heroic deeds during his lifetime, though his end was tragic... It's only natural that people remember him fondly."

The younger boy nodded, though he could hardly make out the distant applause over the din.

"And then..?"

The boy nodded though with uncertainty. Being small in stature, he could not get a clear view of the stage. The crowd was cheering loudly and he could barely hear his voice over the performance.

"And then?" he repeated eagerly.

"And then... the tales recount how he fought against many foes alone, vanquishing them in swift succession. From that moment, he roamed freely between heaven and earth, unfettered," Li Xizhi replied casually, his hands clasped behind his back.

"The tales..?"

Li Xizhi tilted his head, unable to resist asking his next question with innocence in his voice.

"What about in reality?"

"He was killed by the Yu Family. They preserved his severed head and it's probably displayed in the Yu Family's vault now..." Li Xizhi said as his expression darkened.

Every teenager had the dream of practicing qi for three years and establishing the immortal foundation in ten, so he could not help but feel sorry for An Jingming's tragic demise despite being such a talented man.

He held Li Ximing up and said gently, "If you spend less time watching plays and more time reading our family's history... you'll come to understand the bloody realities beyond these tranquil towns."

Li Ximing rested his head against Li Xizhi's chest and hummed in response.

All of a sudden, a figure appeared before them, carrying a sword at his waist. His face was solemn, but his voice was tinged with resignation as he said softly, "I looked everywhere for the both of you..."

Li Xizhi glanced at the man and replied, "Congratulations, Uncle Gongming... I supposed Qi Cultivators are built differently! You actually found us quicker than the Jade Court Guards."

Xu Gongming was in a good mood since he had just recently emerged from seclusion after achieving his breakthrough in the Qi Cultivation Realm. The praise from Li Xizhi caused a smile to appear on his face as he humbly replied, "You flatter me, Young Master."

The Li Family had enjoyed a period of peace over the past five years. News of Li Tongya single-handedly repelling the Yu Family and vanquishing a Maha had spread far and wide, earning him the reputation of the Celestial Moon Sword, garnering recognition even in the Wu and Xu States.

During these years, several members of the Li Family had attained the Qi Cultivation Realm. Madam Dou was among the first, cultivating with the Minor Pure Spiritual Qi. Her accomplishment brought great honor and prestige to the Dou Family.

Next was Xiao Guiluan, who cultivated a Grade Three technique from the Xiao Family with Clear Dusk Origin Qi. Specializing in detoxification and employing soft techniques to subdue enemies, her prowess exceeded that of ordinary Qi cultivators like Madam Dou.

With Xu Gongming's recent breakthrough and Li Xuanxuan who was currently working at the marketplace, the Li Family now boasted five Qi Cultivators, which was already sufficient enough to safeguard the family's interests.

"Why were you looking for me?" Li Xizhi, now at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, asked while holding Li Ximing in his arms.

Xu Gongming replied softly, "Second Old Master has returned from Wutu Peak and is speaking with the family head in town right now... He requests the both of your presence."

Upon hearing his father's return from Wutu Peak, Li Xizhi's demeanor grew serious.

"Understood. Thank you for informing me, Uncle Gongming!"

With that, he activated the Divine Movement Spell and hastened toward the foot of the mountain.

————

Li Yuanping, nearing twenty years of age, possessed a gaze that could exert pressure on anyone due to his many years of managing household affairs. Despite his pale complexion and cultivation merely at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, his presence commanded respect.

Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao, clad in his usual black attire, sat next to Li Yuanping. He had recently attained the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Holding a pale purple jade slip, he asked in a deep voice, "Xizhi took Ming'er out again?"

"Yes..." Li Yuanping chuckled in response. "Xizhi will be leaving home soon, this is a good time for them to bond while they still can."

Li Yuanjiao nodded silently. A year earlier, Yuan Tuan of Qingsui Peak had emerged from her seclusion and broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm by successfully forming her immortal foundation known as Azure Manifest Peak. She had assumed the position of peak master since then, initiating disciple recruitment.

Upon emerging from seclusion, Yuan Tuan immediately sent a response to the Li Family's letter. She wrote warmly, first expressing condolences for Li Chejing's passing and then announcing her upcoming visit to Moongaze Lake in a few months to assess Li Xizhi's aptitude.

Although the Li Family lacked the methods of the three sects and seven gates for assessing root bone, Li Xizhi's rapid cultivation progress—reaching the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm in just six years—clearly qualified him to join the Azure Pond Sect.

Setting aside his brush, Li Yuanping noticed Li Yuanjiao's somber expression and asked, "What brings you all the way back here, brother...?"

Li Yuanjiao frowned and replied, "It's about time to submit tributes to the Azure Pond Sect."

"Don't worry, despite the waning demonic plague, our businesses in the markets are still thriving. We've seen an increase in unrefined Qi Cultivators out there and a bountiful harvest of spirit resources. We have enough for this year's tributes," Li Yuanping assured him.

"I've been busy with preparations for the past few days and have ensured everything is in order. Nothing will go wrong," Li Yuanping added confidently.

Li Yuanjiao nodded approvingly. "I'm relieved you've managed our affairs so capably these past years," he praised.

He then lowered his voice and continued, "However, I received word from Guiluan... Yu Muxian of Yuanwu Peak will oversee this year's tributes. He's already on his way to Moongaze Lake on the Dawn Cloudliner!"

"Yu Muxian?! That indeed complicates things..." Li Yuanping muttered as his expression darkened.

Li Yuanjiao exchanged a knowing glance with Li Yuanping, both aware of the delicate nature of the situation.

After all, Li Tongya had severed Yu Xiaogui's cultivation. Rumors speculated that Yu Xiaogui had been sustaining his life just by using spirit medicines and sacrificial rituals in recent years.

Yu Muxian enjoyed wide connections within the sect, with supporters on Yuanwu Peak who were ready to stand up for him.

However, Yu Muxian himself had yet to take any action, likely intimidated by the formidable reputation of the Li Family's Sword Immortal that echoed throughout the region. As a result, no one dared to find trouble with them.

Now, a Foundation Establishment Immortal Cultivator, personally arriving at Lake Wang Yue, carried significant weight. However, Li Yuanjiao could not help but feel uneasy despite the reputation of the Li Family's Sword Immortal heritage, linked with the Green Spike Sword Immortal and the Moon Que Sword, was indeed formidable.

Now, as a Foundation Establishment Immortal Cultivator, Yu Muxian was personally coming to Moongaze Lake. Naturally, Li Yuanjiao was secretly uneasy about this, even though the Li Family was widely known as the legendary Sword Immortal Clan, where the Qingsui Sword Immortal and Celestial Moon Sword were recognized as formidable brothers.

"No one knows the hardships of their own family better than themselves..."

Only Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanping knew about Li Tongya's passing. Li Yuanjiao pondered silently for a moment before offering reassurance, "I once heard from my late uncle that Yu Muxian is self-serving and ungrateful. Moreover, our family enjoys the protection of an immortal clan... Perhaps he won't push matters too far!"

Li Yuanping nodded slightly as a semblance of relief crossed his pale face.

At that moment, a teenage boy draped in brocade strode into the courtyard, holding the hand of a little boy who was by his side.

Li Xizhi approached respectfully, cupped his fist, and greeted the men.

"Greetings Father, Uncle."




# Chapter 348: Prying Eyes

Before Li Yuanjiao could respond to Li Xizhi, Li Yuanping smiled cordially and said, "Come, come... have a seat first. We'll wait for those two brothers from the second lineage. They're still on the mountain and will arrive shortly."

"Yes," Li Xizhi nodded, releasing Li Ximing's hand to sit beside Li Yuanjiao, who nodded at his greeting and then took a sip of tea.

The two brothers Li Yuanping referred to were naturally those from the generation of Xi and Yue from Li Tongya's lineage—Li Xicheng and Li Xijun.

Of Li Yuanyun's many heirs, only these two sons born with his primary wife had spiritual orifices and were cultivating in the mountains.

As soon as Li Yuanping had finished speaking, two people entered the hall. The first to enter was a normal-looking young man who was about sixteen or seventeen. Clad in a gray robe and carrying a spear on his back, he cupped his fist respectfully and said, "Xicheng greets the two elders."

After Li Yuanping and Li Yuanjiao responded, Li Xizhi lit up with a smile and said, "Brother Cheng!"

Li Xicheng's eyes lit up at the sight of Li Xizhi too, but in front of the elders, he hesitated to say more and merely nodded silently.

Beside him, a boy of six or seven with a handsome face raised an eyebrow and spoke softly, "Jun'er greets the elders and Brother Xiji."
𝒇𝒓𝙚𝒆𝔀𝓮𝓫𝒏𝓸𝙫𝓮𝓵.𝓬𝙤𝙢

Li Xijun was the youngest son of Li Yuanyun, recently confirmed to possess a spiritual orifice. He had spent only a little time with Li Yuanyun before he was sent to the marketplace at the age of one. Growing up in the mountains, he had a much cheerier disposition.

His elder brother, Li Xicheng, who had grown up by Li Yuanyun's side, was more reserved. He stood silently in the courtyard.

Li Yuanjiao observed them attentively, his eyes lingering a little longer on Li Xijun before saying, "Jun'er, you're really good-looking!"

Li Xijun appeared to be accustomed to such compliments. He merely smiled courteously and replied in a childish voice, "Thank you for the compliment, Second Uncle!"

Li Yuanping, who had also been staring at the boy, agreed with a chuckle.

"You're right... This child has the looks of an immortal cultivator. They said he was destined for cultivation even before his spiritual orifice was even confirmed, and now that he has been assessed, it's revealed that he indeed has a spiritual orifice."

Li Yuanjiao nodded with a smile as he observed the child's demeanor, his spirits noticeably lifted.

"I've gathered you juniors here this time to discuss some important matters," he began.

Setting down his tea bowl, Li Yuanjiao continued solemnly, "For many years, rumors have circulated about the demise of the Qingsui Sword Immortal. All the families on the lake have known about it by now. As direct descendants of the Li Family, you must know about this."

At the mention of Qingsui Sword Immortal, the juniors looked up, their expressions grave. Clearly, they had heard similar rumors from their parents.

Li Yuanjiao nodded and confirmed, "The Sword Immortal has indeed passed away..."

The atmosphere grew somber as heads bowed in acknowledgment. Li Yuanjiao said softly, "News of the Sword Immortal's passing has circulated throughout the sect. With our loss of support within the sect and lack of access to information, we only fear vulnerability to exploitation. Hence, I've requested the Qingsui Peak Master to come... Li Xizhi!"

"I'm here," Li Xizhi responded respectfully, stepping forward.

Li Yuanjiao continued, "The clan wishes for you to join the sect and train under Qingsui Peak. Become the pillar of protection for our family, and establish your immortal foundation... Do you understand?"

Li Xizhi kneeled and pressed his forehead on the ground, replying, "Xizhi will not disappoint the trust placed in him."

Meanwhile, Li Xijun and Li Ximing, still too young to grasp the gravity of the situation, felt a tinge of sadness at the prospect of being separated from Li Xizhi for many years.

Li Xicheng, who had no access to the Internal History of their clan, only knew that Azure Pond was the upper sect. He smiled reassuringly at his younger brother.

"Good," Li Yuanjiao said with a glint in his eyes as he helped Li Xizhi to his feet before addressing the group softly, "There is another matter... With the growing number of juniors in the clan, we must establish clearer distinctions among our descendants. In addition to using generation names, we need additional methods to differentiate everyone and avoid misunderstandings."

He continued explaining, "Starting from your generation, those from Changhu's lineage will bear names with either the roof (宀) or the sun (日) radicals, while those of Tongya's branch will use the mountain (山) or the walk (辶) radicals. Xiangping's branch will adopt the work (工) or metal (钅) radicals, while Chejing's branch will use the water (氵) or grain (禾) radicals.[Ref]Translator's Note: I was debating whether I should omit this part from the translation or keep it. Ultimately, I kept it for additional information and tried my best to explain it in a way that made sense in English. Radicals are what we could think of as the base component of each Chinese character, and they are usually the leftmost part of the character. Sometimes, they could be at the top too.[/ref]

Li Yuanjiao stood, folding his arms, and added, "This was what our eldest brother had mentioned. We have all kept his word in mind and named all of you accordingly."

Being from Li Tongya's lineage, the final character of Li Xicheng and Li Xijun's names bore the mountain radical, while Li Ximing, as the eldest of the first lineage, used the sun radical.

Li Yuanjiao, having been adopted to Li Chejing's lineage, picked a character with the water radical for Li Xizhi.

Now that the juniors finally understood the significance of the last characters in their names, they acknowledged the new naming rule.

Li Yuanjiao nodded in satisfaction then said, "One more thing, follow me up the mountain."

————

"The four brothers have perished..." Lu Jiangxian sighed deeply.

The white light in his hand gradually dissipated as he finished assimilating the power of the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed.

Perhaps due to Li Tongya's scattered cultivation, the feedback from the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed he received was not as potent as Li Chejing's.

While it had satisfied Lu Jiangxian, he desired more.

"The power of the Supreme Yin Profound Light has grown, now capable of obliterating a peak Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... After being struck by this Profound Light, survival is impossible unless they possess a special immortal foundation."

He grabbed into the void and retrieved five white pills out of thin air.

"With Li Xuanling dead, the remaining four Profound Pearl Talisman Seeds currently outside the mirror now are in Li Xuanxuan, Li Xuanfeng, Li Yuanjiao, and Li Qinghong..."

The number of Profound Pearl Talisman Seeds did not increase. According to Lu Jiangxian's estimation, he could probably only generate three more when the mirror had recovered its strength to the Purple Mansion Realm.

"On the contrary, my perception has expanded significantly..."

Lu Jiangxian's visual senses now encompassed half of the Yue and Xu States. Apart from a few Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's mountain gates that he dared not probe, the secular world and small clans were within his view.

It was regrettable that his visual sense could not penetrate large formations like his divine sense. Otherwise, he would thoroughly examine the ancestral secrets of various clans.

The coverage of his divine sense now extended across the entire Moongaze Lake, including the Yu and Fei families, among others...

"Well, it's not stealing if it's presented right before my eyes!" he mumbled to himself.

He closed the Long Brocade Heart Sutra in his hand and looked at the other glowing points on the jade table—Jade True Dao Unification Technique Manual, Aged Courtly Path Scripture, Refining Basic Dharma Artifacts On Lake, Talisman Essence Decree, and Introduction to Alchemy...

"That's a lot of legacies!"

The Yu Family had once seized the Jiang Family's legacies years ago, inheriting numerous books, records, as well as alchemy and dharma artifact recipes.

Unfortunately, there were not many high-grade cultivation techniques. The Li Family already had the Grade Four Aged Courtly Path Scripture, which could serve even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator well if in their possession.

As outer disciples of the immortal mansion, the Jiang Family only possessed a few high-grade cultivation techniques. Aside from the Grade Three technique manual known as Gazing Sea Chasing Mountains, which could build an immortal foundation known as Fool's Mountain Chase, the rest were mostly Grade Three cultivation techniques of similar metallic essence.

It was clear that the Moonlight Origin Mansion had left the cultivation paths of the Purple Mansion Realm for its outer disciples, and the families around the lake had five or six cultivation techniques that could be useful up to the Foundational Establishment Realm.

Compared to the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators in the Mushroom Forest Plain who were forced to use common Grade One cultivation techniques, these families were indeed lucky.

"Seems like I, Lu Jiangxian, was a nice man in my previous life..." He chuckled self-deprecatingly as he organized the Dao lineages.

"Jade Court General, Azure Jade Cliff, True Dao Unification, Patterned Brocade...

Just missing one more..." he mumbled.

Lu Jiangxian pondered for a moment, contemplating the deaths of both Yu Yufeng and Fei Wangbai.

Daoist Master Shangyuan is probably the next person to break through to the Golden Core Realm... The metallic essence he sought after is likely this one.

With these thoughts, Lu Jiangxian set aside all these cultivation techniques which he had deemed as dangerous, then picked out three artifact forging, one alchemy, and six talisman secret techniques.

He also picked out two from the remaining Grade Three cultivation techniques—the Fei Family's Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual and the Yu Family's Gazing Sea Chasing Mountains Technique Manual.

"I'll find an excuse to give out these items," he continued mumbling to himself.

After pondering for a while, he mused to himself, "Since the Li Family no longer has a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, the talisman seeds from the mirror should also be decreased from nine to six to match the Li Family's speculations."

Lu Jiangxian struggled briefly. After all, the talisman seeds had gradually increased in number over time, deliberately timed by Lu Jiangxian to coincide with Li Tongya's increased strength.

At that time, Li Tongya had assumed that the talisman seeds increased with the holder's strength. Now that Li Yuanjiao wielded the mirror, the number of talisman seeds should logically also change accordingly.

Lu Jiangxian mulled over this briefly before releasing five talisman seeds in the end, inwardly coming to his own conclusion.

"Never mind. Li Yuanjiao is a smart man, he'll likely find an explanation for this himself."




# Chapter 349: Generation of Xi and Yue Receive Talisman Seeds

Li Yuanjiao led a small group of boys up the mountain path and stood before the rear courtyard's formation that was shimmering in white light.

Li Xijun stared at it in awe. He gripped Li Ximing's hand and whispered, "Third Brother, is this where that rumored green and white immortal sword is...?"

"No idea," Li Ximing replied, furrowing his brow slightly. His features were sharp and smooth, yet next to Li Xijun, they seemed rather plain. "I've never set foot in this courtyard all the years I've been home..." he continued as his voice trailed off.

"This is our ancestral hall," Li Xizhi explained softly, holding his coat tightly. Being much older than Li Ximing and Li Xijun who only reached up to his waist, he spoke warmly.

"After Brother Cheng and I were assessed for spiritual orifice, we were brought here to honor our ancestors and memorize our clan's history."

Realization dawned on the two younger boys while Li Xicheng stood silently at the front. Li Yuanjiao performed a series of hand seals and cast three spells before the large formation was unlocked, allowing them into the rear hall.

In the rear hall, numerous artifacts were displayed—all weathered and ancient. Wolf skins adorned the walls, and prominently positioned among them was a bow of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Its surface bore countless scars that whispered of battles won and lost.

Li Xicheng and Li Xizhi exchanged glances, sharing a mix of both excitement and reverence. With a hushed tone, Li Xizhi whispered softly, "The Ebony Bow..."

Li Xicheng, a man of few words, grunted deeply. This was the bow that Li Xiangping had wielded, a fact well-known to both of them since they had already read and studied the Family History.

Li Yuanjiao glanced at all four of them, then produced a jade slip and said in a solemn voice, "Do you still remember the Reception Method I instructed you to memorize before?"

The four boys looked at each other before nodding in unison.

"Yes..."

"Good! That saves me from further explanations then," Li Yuanjiao praised as he stowed away the jade slip with a satisfied smile.

He then led them through a corridor and pushed open the doors to the ancestral hall. A tablet stood atop a pedestal, its presence commanding amidst the lingering incense.

"Join hands," instructed Li Yuanjiao. The four boys complied right away, each bowing as Li Yuanjiao gently tapped their foreheads, sealing their six senses. They followed him silently to the secret chamber where the bluish-gray mirror faintly glimmered, emitting wisps of ethereal haze that resembled moonlight.

After arranging the juniors in a kneeling row, Li Yuanjiao stood before them, bowing respectfully once more. Then, he stepped forward and extended his spiritual senses into the mirror, only to discover five glowing white talisman seeds within it.

"Five...?!" he murmured in astonishment before a grin broke out on his face.

Uncle Xuanfeng must have attained the Foundation Establishment Realm!

The number of talisman seeds in the mirror reflected the strength of their family. There were a total of nine after Li Tongya had attained the Foundation Establishment Realm, and now with Li Tongya gone and the count unchanged, this pretty much confirms that Li Xuanfeng had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.

"Too bad he's in the remote Yi Mountain City, unable to deliver such great news to us..." Li Yuanjiao sighed to himself.

With newfound confidence, he took a step back and recited respectfully, "The Li Family of Lijing offers respect along with fine delicacies and wine... When the time comes, we will remain true to our oath. With this talisman burned, we express our gratitude to the Supreme Yin."

Lu Jiangxian's divine sense was stirred as it emerged from the mirror, scanning the four youths kneeling before him. Invisible, colorless ripples swept through them, and faint glowing white halos emerged above each child's head.

"Yet another generation..." he mumbled to himself.

The eldest among the four was Li Xicheng, and was already about sixteen or seventeen years old. He had an honest appearance and seemed to be at the third layer of Embryonic Breathing Realm. His talent seemed decent, though the halo above his head measured only three cun, emitting a weak light. Lu Jiangxian's gaze quickly swept past him.

The second youth, who was clad in brocade and fur, bore a striking resemblance to Li Yuanjiao. He exuded a heroic air to him, and the gap between his eyebrows was small, lending him a sly look.

"This must be Li Xizhi... chosen to be sent to the Azure Pond Sect," Lu Jiangxian mumbled thoughtfully.

Li Xizhi, at the third stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm at the age of twelve or thirteen years old, boasted talent that was on par with Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong. Lu Jiangxian took note of his superior talent and the six-cun halo above his head.

Next was Li Ximing, whose white halo was seven cun. While his talent slightly lagged behind Li Xizhi's, Lu Jiangxian's divine sense detected something peculiar.

"Huh?!"

He scrutinized him carefully, from the Shenyang Mansion between his brow to his trachea, and finally into the Qihai acupoint, confirming his initial suspicion.

"The red haze in his sea of qi rises fourfold, and the qi in his Shenyang Mansion is stable and can harmonize water and fire... There's no sign of yin and yang imbalance... He has a natural talent for alchemy!"

Having read various alchemy texts and many relevant books from the Yu and Fei families' collections, Lu Jiangxian's knowledge far surpassed that of the Li Family. His recognition of such a trait brought him instant delight.

"Seven cun halo... After receiving the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed, he'll become a significant genius—a potential pillar for the Li Family, and a valuable asset, given his potential in alchemy!"

Having stayed in the mirror and observed the Li Family's growth over eighty years in solitude, from Li Chejing to Li Tongya, Lu Jiangxian's heart swelled with a mix of pride and nostalgia as he continued assessing the youngest descendant before him: Li Xijun.

"...Good appearance!"

Having encountered countless cultivators around the lake, including the handsome Li Chejing, the graceful Fei Wangbai, and the ethereal An Jingming, Lu Jiangxian could not help but marvel at Li Xijun's striking features.

Li Xijun, born just a month or two after Li Ximing, naturally looked to be about the same age. Despite his youthful countenance, Li Xijun's sharp eyebrows and bright eyes made him stand out among his brothers.

"His talent is mediocre, yet he possesses a nine-cun halo..." Lu Jiangxian noted, counting on his fingers. Though Li Xijun's potential was only average, his nine-cun spiritual orifice set him apart from ordinary cultivators, rivaling Li Ximing's talent before receiving a talisman seed.

"Li Ximing must receive a talisman seed... So I'll have to decide between Li Xizhi and Li Xijun."

With an abundance of talisman seeds at his disposal, Lu Jiangxian acted generously. After a moment's consideration, he waved his hand and sent out three talisman seeds.

"Li Xizhi will be joining the Azure Pond Sect; his cultivation speed will undoubtedly be superior to the rest... He deserves a seed. If Li Ximing is the only one to receive the talisman, he may struggle alone and the Li Family might eventually end up like the Yu Family... Although Li Xijun's talent is average, his nine inches of halo and the talisman seed will make him a small genius. Both of them will receive a seed too!"

The three talisman seeds hovered above their heads while Lu Jiangxian held onto the remaining two for the next generation. He then handed the Golden Temple Radiant Origin Manual, Introduction to Alchemy, and Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual to each of the three boys.

With a hand seal, the three white lights exited the bluish-gray mirror obediently. They pierced through the wisps of moonlight haze, illuminating the air with an otherworldly brilliance. The ends of these streams of light subtly split into faint seven-colored hues, creating a mesmerizing sight indeed.

"Three seeds?!" Li Yuanjiao exclaimed in delight, watching the lights descend upon the three boys. He quickly patted each of them on the shoulder, undoing their mana-sealed six senses.

"Focus your mind, hold your essence, and circulate your mana according to the instructions in the Reception Method!" he instructed.




# Chapter 350: Receiving New Techniques

Li Yuanjiao watched as the three juniors composed their minds and began meditating. He then glanced at Li Xicheng, who sat at the side with his six senses still sealed off. He gently took his hand, leading him out of the courtyard and into a secluded area.

Li Yuanjiao gently tapped on the space between the boy's eyebrows to undo the mana seal on his senses, and the boy immediately awakened. Meeting his slightly confused gaze, Li Yuanjiao asked softly, "Xi Cheng, are you training with the spear?"

Li Xicheng obediently nodded. Li Yuanjiao continued asking, "Did Aunt Qinghong ever teach you the Wing Clipper Spear Technique?"

"No. Auntie said she took the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath so she couldn't pass it on to others, so she didn't teach me," Li Xicheng replied eagerly.

"I see," Li Yuanjiao replied thoughtfully. He retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve and handed it to the boy, explaining, "Your younger brothers are inheriting the clan's legacies. This Grade Three Wing Clipper Spear Technique shall be yours to inherit. Take the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath and memorize it here in this courtyard before you leave, and you must never speak of what has happened today!"

"Yes!" Li Xicheng immediately responded. He hastily took the spiritual oath and accepted the jade slip from Li Yuanjiao as if it were a precious treasure.

"Thank you, Second Uncle!"

Li Yuanjiao nodded then slowly exited the courtyard, closing the door behind him. The protective formation separating the inside from the outside hummed to life, and his expression betrayed a trace of complex emotions.

"At least we've compensated for it... We have no choice but to hide it from him..." he murmured with a sigh.

Li Yuanping, who had been waiting outside, shook his head slightly and replied, "The fewer he knows, the better. Apart from the family head and those who have received a talisman seed, no one else is allowed entry. This rule has been set long ago."

"You're right," Li Yuanjiao replied with a smile before continuing, "Still, it's a surprise that three of them received a seed... That's beyond our expectations. It's about time for us to check on the boys."

————

Li Xizhi guided the profound pearl according to the Reception Method's instruction. It descended through the twelve stories—his trachea—then settled at the Qihai acupoint. Instantly, warmth spread throughout his body and his sea of qi churned vigorously.

"This!"

As a direct descendant of the Li Family, Li Xizhi practiced the best Embryonic Breathing Realm technique in the family—the Supreme Jade Meridian Nourishment Technique. It was a neutral Grade Three technique that harmonized well with most qi cultivation techniques.

Despite the technique's minor drawbacks and potential lifespan reduction, the accelerated cultivation speed made it a worthwhile endeavor. Having dedicated many years to its practice, Li Xizhi had successfully condensed three Supreme Jade Spirit Chakras within his body, each glowing faintly with the luster of jade.

However, as the white pill entered his body, the two of the Spirit Chakras condensed by the Supreme Jade Meridian Nourishment Technique within his Qihai acupoint began to tremble slowly and gradually turned shiny...and brilliantly white.

The previously grayish sea of qi churned, gradually clearing under the white light, transforming into a clear and serene pool.

"W-What... immortal technique is this?!"

Among the six chakras of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, Li Xizhi had already condensed the Profound Scenery, Radiant Lure, and Celestial Whirl chakras. Now, the two of them within his sea of qi had transformed.

He hurriedly circulated his mana and examined the Celestial Whirl chakra in his Juque Court near his lungs. Indeed, it had turned bright white too.

Just as Li Xizhi marveled at such a phenomenon, an imposing and deep voice resounded in his mind.

"Here stands the disciple of the Li Family—who has forsaken his worldly attachments... To him, I bestow the Profound Light, initiating their journey in the path of Dao, transforming them from mere mortals to saints. They will begin with discipline and ultimately ascend to truth! I grant them a scroll of the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra, along with the Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual!"

Li Xizhi's mind was flooded with strange words and profound phrases, deeply imprinting themselves into his mind. He concentrated intently, maintaining focus for the time needed to burn a stick of incense before slowly opening his eyes.

The blurred scenery before him gradually sharpened into focus. Li Xizhi realized he was standing in a dim, mist-shrouded environment that seemed as ethereal as a celestial realm. Soft white mana lights bathed his surroundings, casting a gentle glow overhead.

Directly in front of him stood a tall, ancient stone platform that was adorned with intricate patterns and a dazzling light floating just above it.

"That's..."

A bluish-gray mirror hovered in the air, with wisps of moonlight flowing out of it and creeping up along his robes. Li Xizhi could not even register Li Yuanjiao's words. His gaze was completely fixated on the mirror above him as he gasped softly, "What's that, Father?"

Standing nearby, Li Yuanjiao solemnly replied, "There was once an immortal cultivator who underestimated this immortal object and attempted to capture it with his dharma artifact... He was swiftly reduced to nothingness by the Supreme Yin Profound Light, along with his artifact. If you do not fear death, you may continue gazing upon it."

Li Xizhi recoiled in shock and quickly averted his gaze, mumbling quietly but frantically, "Please forgive me!"

However, his excitement soon returned in a flash as he wondered aloud, "Is it a treasure?!"

"Perhaps even more."

Li Yuanjiao gently guided his eldest son to kneel beside him while waiting for the two younger boys to complete their reception of the Profound Pearl Talisman Seeds.

He continued in a hushed tone, "This immortal mirror has a long history, handed down through generations in our family. Anyway, what technique did you receive?"

Li Xizhi immediately understood his father's question and replied, "The Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual and..."

Observing Li Xizhi's astonished expression, Li Yuanjiao chuckled.

"I see you've realized that regardless of your previous Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivation technique, once the talisman seed enters your body, the chakras you have previously condensed will be instantly transformed into the Supreme Yin Chakras, aligning with the practice of that immortal sutra!"

Overwhelmed by this revelation, Li Xizhi was rendered speechless. After a good while, he shyly admitted, "I had thought the green and white immortal sword was remarkable enough... I never imagined our family harbored such a marvel! Even the rumored Frosty Absolute Sword of the Azure Pond Sect can't possibly be compared to this..."

While they were talking, Li Xijun and Li Ximing had already opened their eyes and looked on with wonder.

Li Yuanping approached and spoke to them warmly before his face beamed with happiness as he announced, "Brother, both of them have received cultivation techniques too!"

"Excellent!" Li Yuanjiao smiled joyfully but quickly lowered his voice and said, "We shouldn't be noisy here, let's talk outside."

————

In the much brighter side hall, two boys were writing furiously. Li Xizhi, the oldest and more skilled with his brush, had already finished transcribing the Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual.

"The immortal foundation that can be established by this Grade Three technique is known as Snow On Pine... This technique harnesses cold qi to control rain and snow, and the manual also includes a qi gathering technique. It seems quite impressive," Li Yuanjiao remarked, nodding as he finished reading the manual.

"The qi is to be gathered during the snowy season in the pine forest on a high mountain, under a cloudless moonlit sky. One can obtain a wisp of it in three months. Ten wisps make a portion," he added.

"That won't be a problem," Li Yuanping responded with a gentle nod, "Mount Yuting is high and snowy; it should be a suitable place to gather qi. I'll arrange for someone to plant the pine trees there as soon as possible."

"There's no need to hurry. The northern coastal peaks are abundant with pine forests. A trip there will be sufficient," Li Yuanjiao said, setting aside the wooden slip. "Moreover, establishing a pine forest will take time, even with the help of spells and techniques. Besides, we can't predict the challenges that may arise with this technique..." he added with a thoughtful gleam in his eyes.

Li Yuanping immediately understood the meaning behind Li Yuanjiao's words and nodded. As soon as they concluded their discussion, Li Xijun presented another wooden slip.

"The Golden Temple Radiant Origin Manual," he announced.

Li Yuanjiao picked up the transcribed manual from Li Xijun and read it carefully. After a moment, he raised an eyebrow in surprise and exclaimed, "A Grade Four technique?!"

He continued flipping through the pages eagerly, mumbling to himself in marvel.

"Excellent...excellent!"

Li Yuanping leaned over to read the manual, initially joyful until he noticed a small note in ink at the end. Their expressions suddenly changed. Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes as he said, "Recorded by Cui Mu from Zhaoyuan Immortal Mansion from Wei State of Central Plain? This is a legacy from Zhaoyuan Immortal Mansion from Wei State of Central Plain?!"

"Wei State?" Li Yuanping echoed, puzzled.

"I've heard of the northern powers like Yan State and Zhao State, but I've never heard of Wei State... let alone this Zhaoyuan Immortal Mansion. There's actually an immortal sect in the north..?"

Li Yuanjiao carefully placed the wooden slip on the desk. His heart was racing as he murmured, "Maybe this Wei State is an ancient territory from centuries past... That would explain why we've never heard of it. Seven hundred years ago when Buddhism was still confined to Mobei, Daoist sects dominated the Central Plain. There were reportedly over 172 states, Wei could have been one of them. If that's true, then it makes sense for immortal sects to exist in the Wei State..."

Li Yuanjiao had gotten this information from Xiao Guiluan. After all, the Xiao Family was an ancient immortal family with ancestors who hailed from the north. Naturally, they were more knowledgeable about the history of the north; in fact, they even had a few northern Dao techniques in their possession.

However, Xiao Guiluan was a concubine-born daughter of the direct lineage, with a status akin to those in the major sect of the Li Family. Now that she had been married into the Li Family, it was even more challenging for her to obtain such information.

Li Yuanjiao could barely contain his excitement while Li Yuanping was slightly taken aback by the revelation. He quickly connected the dots and said in a serious tone, "So... you mean to say that techniques similar to this nature might have already been lost? Doesn't that mean..."

Before Li Yuanping could finish his sentence by saying "Doesn't that mean we'll have a smooth ride ahead", he was interrupted by Li Yuanjiao's sigh.

"Let's not rush to conclusions. We should verify if there's indeed still an immortal sect active up in the north..." Li Yuanjiao said firmly.

Listening intently from the side, Li Xizhi's eyes flickered with curiosity. He hurriedly interjected, "The younger brothers have just begun their cultivation journey, and they will take at least ten years to reach the Qi Cultivation Realm... After I join the Azure Pond Sect, I can investigate Wei State and the Zhaoyuan Immortal Mansion on behalf of our family."

"Very well!" Li Yuanjiao praised, looking more at ease now. For years, the weight of Li Tongya's passing had burdened him, fearing he might fall short of his expectations. Now with a clear direction, he felt uplifted.

"It's a shame Uncle Xian is from a branch of the Xiao Family. Otherwise, Auntie could help us inquire more..." Li Xizhi remarked absentmindedly, his excitement evident as he glanced at the tiny script on the wooden slip.

However, Li Yuanjiao's expression turned stern as he interrupted sharply, "Zhi'er!"

Li Xizhi raised his head in surprise, noticing the fading smile on Li Yuanping's face as he gently explained, "Since your aunt has married into the Xiao Family, she is now one of them. Asking her to do something like that would put her in a difficult position!"

Li Xizhi, who had spent his childhood playing in the mountains, was extremely close to Li Qingxiao. Li Yuanping's words had taken him by surprise.

"I've been thoughtless," he admitted.

Li Yuanjiao looked at him, then sighed.

"Our family does not match theirs in status at present, having been a clan for just three generations. No matter how close we are as a family, we must tread carefully. We cannot impose undue burdens and end up souring familial ties..."
𝑓𝑟𝑒𝘦𝓌𝑒𝑏𝑛𝑜𝘷𝑒𝘭.𝒸𝘰𝑚

"I understand," Li Xizhi responded, cupping his fist respectfully. Li Xijun listened attentively to their conversation, his handsome face betraying a pensive expression.

Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao collected the wooden slips and glanced at Li Ximing, who was still scribbling furiously with sweat beading his forehead.

Li Yuanjiao was amused by such a sight and failed to suppress a chuckle. He walked up to the boy and asked warmly, "Why haven't you completed your writing yet?"

Li Ximing, looking slightly flustered, gestured to the stack of meticulously written wooden slips. He carefully dipped his brush into ink and replied, "Everyone else's entries are so short, but mine turned out so long-winded!"

His complaint drew chuckles from Li Xijun and Li Xizhi. Li Yuanjiao peered closer and saw the title on the slip—Introduction to Alchemy.

"Alchemy?!"

Li Yuanping and Li Yuanjiao exchanged surprised glances.

"How rare! This is the first time I've seen someone being bestowed an alchemy manual among the hundred arts of Immortal Cultivation..." Li Yuanping remarked.

As soon as he finished speaking those words, realization dawned on them. They simultaneously placed their hands on Li Ximing's body—one on his Qihai acupoint, the other on his throat.

"This is..."

The Li Family had never produced a skilled alchemist. After assessing Li Ximing for a moment, the two brothers had their suspicions.

Eventually, Li Yuanjiao chuckled and decided, "You can begin practicing with the manual. We'll send someone to the Xiao Family to invite Senior Yuansi over!"

————

Meanwhile in Yi Mountain City at the southern border...

A middle-aged man clad in leather armor stood silently atop the city wall, the biting cold wind whipping fiercely around him. His sharp eyebrows furrowed as he gazed down at the demon beasts gathering below him. His gray-black eyes, tired yet steady, betrayed no emotion.

He raised the golden longbow in his hands, taking a deep breath before a radiant golden light condensed between his hands, swirling and forming a golden-white arrow.

"Take this!"

Golden-white brilliance gleamed in his eyes as the arrow streaked through the sky like a falling star, slicing through the air and leaving a trail of dazzling light in its wake.

Whoosh!

A massive eagle, as large as a house and soaring in the sky, emitted a cry so piercing that it could crack gold and shatter stone. It flapped its wings desperately, attempting to ascend, but it was too late to evade.

Its shrill cry was abruptly silenced.

Watching the eagle plummet into the distant mountain forest, Li Xuanfeng lowered his bow and straightened up. The glint in his eyes dimmed once more as he turned back toward the city, retrieving a wineskin from his chest pocket and taking a small sip.

"Brother Feng... Your archery skills have improved yet again," Fei Yihe remarked. He was dressed in white as usual as he sat down beside him with his spear.

"That demon beast was at the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, yet you shot it down with just one arrow... You're probably not far from reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, right?" he asked in a hushed tone.

"Yes."

Li Xuanfeng nodded and leaned his longbow against the wall, its weight creating a loud thud that startled the surrounding crowd.

"I've reached the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm, and I am ready to pick a day to enter seclusion for the breakthrough," he announced, causing murmurs of approval and well-wishes from those who were gathered around.

Li Xuanfeng acknowledged them with a wave of his hand.

Fei Yihe smiled wryly and remarked, "Brother Feng, your talent is truly exceptional. If you were still on the lake, Yu Mugao and Yu Xiaogui would surely be troubled by your presence! It's a shame we're stuck in this hellhole, watching the Azure Pond Sect play games with the Demon King day in and day out..."

"If we win, the demons we killed belong to the Azure Pond Sect. If we lose, we become the demon's food and nourishment. We started with fifty-six defenders on these walls; now, we're down to just fifteen. Gambling for too long is bound to lead to losses," he continued.

Li Xuanfeng chuckled in response.

"You seem to fear death less and less now, to speak so openly and frankly about this."

Fei Yihe sighed wearily and said, "All of us are going to die sooner or later anyway. The Azure Pond Sect doesn't care what we think."

Li Xuanfeng gazed into the distance as he took another sip of wine thoughtfully.

"I heard that the Azure Pond Sect is gathering a group of formation masters to repair Yi Mountain City's formations?" he asked.

"Yes."

At the mention of this, the group of people was filled with joy and anticipation. Fei Yihe laughed out loud and continued, "It's been ten years since we've been isolated from the outside world... Finally, someone is coming! I wonder how much the outside world has changed over these years!"




# Chapter 352: Arrival of the Cloudliner

The howling north wind was completely isolated outside the enclosed cabin of the Dawn Cloudliner. The wooden chairs on the Cloudliner were cushioned with brocade fabric and enchanted with spells, making them exceptionally comfortable.

"Yi Mountain City..."

Liu Changdie sank into the wooden chair as his gaze lingered on the majestic city below, feeling emotions stirring within him. He thought to himself, In my previous life, I came to this place as an insignificant Qi Cultivator of the second heavenly layer... In this life, I have already reached the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Looking at the ancient city before his eyes, the image of a golden longbow appeared in Liu Changdie's mind, causing him to frown as he was filled with deep confusion.

There are more and more changes... Li Tongya killed Yu Xiaogui with his sword... This is another event that never happened in my previous life. Could the formation I set up for the Li Family have changed everything?

Liu Changdie was originally an ordinary cultivator, but with these memories, he had been living his life smoothly. Now, everything had become unrecognizable, causing him to feel a fearful chill down his spine.

In my previous life, after Li Tongya killed the Maha, he disappeared. The Master Monks of the Lotus Temple besieged Mount Lijing. I had thought of saving them to make them owe me a favor... But now, Li Tongya is still guarding the Li Family, and the bald monks of the Lotus Temple seem to have become recluses.

The Yu Family not only failed to breach the Fei Family's defense, but they also lost Yu Xiaogui. The situation on the lake is entirely different now. My past life's memories are no longer of much use...

As the altitude continued to drop, he felt a sense of confusion, thinking, Now that Li Qinghong is not dead, the Li Family will be even more different. Without the previous life's knowledge and assistance, Li Yuanjiao may not consider me his brother... Fortunately, I have made friends with those from the Xuan generation, so it's not too bad.

Seeing the advantages of his rebirth gradually fading, Liu Changdie began to lose hope.

I do not know if Mufeng and Zhongqing have reached the Qi Cultivation Realm. It seems I still need to return to the Li Family... After all, I am not destined to roam the world alone.

Lost in thought, he felt a slight weight underfoot as clouds appeared beneath him. The man standing at the bow of the ship poked his head inside and said in a deep voice, "Fellow Daoists, we have arrived!"

Liu Changdie quickly stood up as they descended upon the city below. He saw a majestic great wall stretching out and covered in intricate runes, forming a unified whole and turning the entire city itself into a grand formation.

"As expected of the city left by the Moonlight Origin Mansion. No other formations of the present era could be compared to it!"

Liu Changdie had lost count of the times he had climbed up and down these city walls in his previous life, but he was still filled with emotion. Looking up, he saw eagles and sparrows circling relentlessly above the land with bones scattered everywhere. In the distance, a dense forest raised waves of leaves in the north wind.

"This is Yi Mountain City!"

Following his memories, Liu Changdie landed at this first stronghold of the Yue State, and he saw the cultivators around the stronghold gathering. He searched carefully and finally saw a middle-aged man carrying a golden bow, who was smiling at him.

"Brother Xuanfeng!"

Liu Changdie ignored the others surrounding him and eagerly went over, saying joyfully, "Congratulations!"

Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow, his gaze lighting up with interest. He asked, "What is there to congratulate about?"

"Hahahaha," Liu Changdie laughed heartily and said, "Senior Tongya has slain the Maha with his sword and forced the retreat of a prestigious clan... His reputation is resounding!"

Most of the cultivators on the stronghold were from around Moongaze Lake. Hearing this, they were all stunned, finding it hard to believe and silently swallowing in fear.

Before Li Xuanfeng could speak, someone asked a question that caught everyone's attention immediately.

"Has Senior already broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm?"

"No..." Liu Changdie replied softly as he gathered everyone to sit down and began to explain in detail. The group listened, occasionally gasping and sighing.

When he mentioned Fei Wangbai's death, Fei Yihe suddenly stood up, his face flushed with disbelief. "How is that possible?! Our Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation isn't just for show! What nonsense are you spouting!" he exclaimed in shock and anger.

Liu Changdie smiled wryly, having anticipated his reaction.

"If you do not believe me, you can go to the other cities and ask around. There is nothing more I can do..."

Seeing Fei Yihe's incredulous expression, Liu Changdie thought to himself, Losing just Fei Wangbai is far better than the entire clan being wiped out!

Li Family.

In the hall, Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanping stood with their cupped fists. The middle-aged man at the head wore several medicine pouches at his waist, exuding a gentle demeanor. He stroked his beard with one hand and placed the other on Li Ximing's back, his eyes slightly closed.

"The red haze in the Sea of Qi rises fourfold, Shenyang Mansion harmonizes water and fire, Juque acupoint's spiritual energy flows continuously, and twelve levels of the trachea align in harmony..."

Xiao Yuansi nodded lightly and said warmly, "Congratulations to both of you! This child indeed has a constitution suited for alchemy. His heart fire is balanced and just, making him particularly adept at refining pills that can enhance cultivation and break through barriers. This is quite rare!"

Xiao Yuansi was always gentle and scholarly. Even when facing two juniors, he remained courteous and calm. Li Yuanjiao was overjoyed upon hearing this and replied, "Thank you, Senior!"

Xiao Yuansi chuckled and shook his head, saying kindly, "No need to thank me... but I shall accept it."

He took out a jade slip from his sleeve and handed it to Li Ximing, explaining, "Your family's Snake Dragon Tree bears fruit annually, and it is a hassle to send it to me each time. I used a private recipe to exchange this Snake Essence Pill formula from my clan... Consider it a meeting gift for Ming'er."

Li Yuanjiao had always heard that this senior took great care of their clan and was trustworthy, which was why he dared to invite him. Unexpectedly, Xiao Yuansi presented such a grand gift, leaving Li Yuanjiao somewhat overwhelmed. "This is too much!" he exclaimed.

Xiao Yuansi laughed, shaking his head. He let out a sigh and said, "No need to be so polite. Since you invited me, I cannot be stingy! I promised Jing'er that I would take good care of your family."

The two brothers wanted to express their gratitude further, but Xiao Yuansi simply waved them off and said, "Our family's ancestor has been away for many years. I had just returned from gathering herbs in the mountains this month, only to hear about Tongya slaying the Maha and forcing the retreat of the Yu Family... What happened?"

Li Yuanjiao felt a chill run through him, thinking to himself, The Xiao Family certainly knows the truth about Li Tongya slaying the Maha... Even if they don't know the specifics of what happened in the end, they must know that our ancestor was used as bait!

Xiao Yuansi's gaze was calm and his eyes gentle, giving no hint of any hidden knowledge. This made Li Yuanjiao feel a cold sweat break out on his back, and he thought to himself, It seems the Xiao Family is intentionally keeping things from him... Should I tell him or not?

He hesitated for a moment, his mind racing with thoughts, feeling deeply apprehensive.

Our Li Family shouldn't be aware of this! Although Xiao Yuansi has good intentions, a gentleman should be forthright. Perhaps Xiao Guitu and the others are using this to test us...

He then shook his head and answered, "Our ancestor returned and immediately went into seclusion. We are not aware of the details; we only know that the Maha was merely a reincarnated body."

Xiao Yuansi gazed intently at him for a moment, then nodded thoughtfully before asking, "I received a letter from my junior sister a while ago. Is it true that you have a child studying under her?"

"Indeed!"

Li Yuanjiao was eager for the change in topic and quickly called Li Xizhi over.

Li Xizhi, dressed in a brocade robe, had a dignified appearance. Although he was not as impressive as his younger brother Li Xijun, he still stood in the courtyard with a certain grace.

"Xizhi greets Senior!" Li Xizhi greeted as he cupped his fist respectfully.

Xiao Yuansi nodded and mused, "Yuan Tuan owes your family a great deal... She will certainly take good care of this child. Do not hesitate to ask her for anything he needs!"

However, he soon let out a sigh.

He glanced down at the shimmering Dragon Coiling Pillar sword hanging from Li Yuanjiao's waist and nodded.

"This Dragon Coiling Pillar has been in the Yuan Family for many years... Even though they have no sword cultivators, they never let it go. Now it has easily come into your family's possession... That speaks volumes."

The Dragon Coiling Pillar was a congratulatory gift from the Yuan Family to Li Tongya when he had achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm. It eventually ended up with Li Yuanjiao, who had never thought much about it.

Xiao Yuansi continued to explain, "The Yuan Family of Mushroom Forest Plain owes your Li Family a great debt. Giving you Dragon Coiling Pillar hardly repays even a fraction of that debt... If you need anything, you can always ask the Yuan Family for help."

Li Yuanjiao felt increasingly suspicious. Instead of feeling pleased, he grew alarmed and narrowed his eyes, asking softly, "I was unaware of this matter... Could you enlighten me, Senior?"

"Well..."

Xiao Yuansi looked uncomfortable, pausing for several seconds before speaking vaguely, "I only recently learned of this... The Azure Crest Manifestation was... originally a substitute for Lake Moon Autumn, which is why my junior sister delayed for so many years... It is a complicated mess, and it is really difficult to explain!"

Seeing the puzzled looks on the faces of the two brothers, Xiao Yuansi changed the topic awkwardly but hastily.

"It has been many years, Yuanjiao. At such a young age, you have already reached the sixth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm!" he suddenly remarked with a forced smile.

"You flatter me, Senior..." Li Yuanjiao responded politely despite his confusion.

Xiao Yuansi chuckled. "Each generation brings forth new talents... Rare, indeed!" he commended, though his words hinted to a deeper meaning behind them.

He then looked at the two juniors with a smile and, with a playful tone, said, "Senior Mutian... he's probably more than just a simple Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, is he not?"

The two brothers exchanged glances, both equally confused. Li Yuanjiao respectfully replied, "The family records do not provide detailed information..."

Xiao Yuansi waved his hand and interrupted him before saying loudly, "I see, never mind then... I still have important matters to attend to, so I won't intrude any longer! Please inform me when Tongya emerges from seclusion."

"Of course!"

The two immediately responded before Xiao Yuansi left by riding the wind. Li Yuanjiao respectfully saw him off beyond the borders, then returned.

The affairs in the hall had already been taken care of. Li Yuanping was holding the alchemy recipe, reading it in deep thought. Seeing Li Yuanjiao stride in, he smiled wryly and said, "Senior Xiao has been so considerate, we have no way to repay him. The Xiao Family indeed has shown great kindness to our family... Moreover, we will still need to rely on the Xiao Family in the future."

Li Yuanjiao responded with a sigh, "Xiao Yuansi is Xiao Yuansi... the Xiao Family is the Xiao Family. Senior Xiao's intentions are protective and caring, but Xiao Guitu may not necessarily feel the same. This matter is not urgent... But how did the Yuan Family come to owe us a favor?"

"It seems to be related to the sword immortal... Lake Moon Autumn is the sword immortal's Dao foundation. Perhaps Yuan Tuan owed a favor? It is just a pity we cannot ask the ancestor..."

The two pondered about the matter for a little while longer but ultimately lacked information and could not deduce much, so they had to give it up.

Li Yuanjiao picked up a jade slip, assessed it with his spiritual sense, and said warmly, "This Golden Temple Radiant Origin Manual is indeed excellent, and the Radiant Origin Pass has many wonders. However, collecting the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth known as Golden Yang Radiant Origin is quite difficult."

Li Yuanping had also read this technique and immediately responded, saying, "This Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth indeed sounds extraordinary! Fortunately, the technique also includes methods for gathering this qi. Otherwise, such ancient spiritual qi would be impossible to find even if we turned Yue State upside down."

Li Yuanjiao laughed and shook his head, reading aloud, "Seek a pass extending for thousands of li in the desert... wait until dusk when the wind and sand are calm, and the sunset is half-set. Then, use your mana to extract the power of the glowing sun. There is only a moment to obtain this energy... requiring two years to get a wisp, and ten wisps to make one portion."

"Ancient methods are indeed troublesome!"

Li Yuanping sighed and reminded him, "It is even more than that. The Golden Yang Radiant Origin must not come into contact with gold, iron, copper, water, or wood; otherwise, it will transform into Scorching Smoke Qi... It also requires a fine jade box for storage."

"That is not a concern."

Li Yuanjiao still had a Purple Mansion Realm jade box that Li Tongya had found on the island in the heart of the lake, and it was more than sufficient to store the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi. He was now considering where to find such a pass.
𝐟𝐫𝕖𝗲𝘄𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝕧𝐞𝚕.𝕔𝕠𝐦

"Brother, put these matters aside for now. The Dawn Cloudliner is arriving!" Li Yuanping said as he shook his head slightly.

————

The golden cloudliner glowed brilliantly, its golden wings cutting through layers of clouds. It glided over the dark green lake water, reflecting dazzling golden light.

At the front of the Dawn Cloudliner, a youth in simple green attire stood quietly. His features bore a strong resemblance to Yu Mugao, but while Yu Mugao's expression was often harsh and sinister, this man's face was calm and serene.

"Moongaze Lake, formerly known as the Moongaze Marsh..."

The Dawn Cloudliner docked slowly in Milin Prefecture. Yu Muxian stood with his hands behind his back, his ethereal demeanor making his simple clothing appear elegant and dynamic. Just by standing there, he drew the gazes of all the cultivators on the ship.

Yu Muxian had been away from home for over twenty years, making it hard to recognize the familiar landscape beneath his feet. He gazed down in indifference, continuously playing with the jade buckle in his hand.

The jade buckle was as clear as ice, emitting a faint moonlight-like glow as he twirled it in his hand. Yu Muxian's eyes gazed steadily forward, seemingly observing something in silence.

"Moongaze Lake... truly a blessed land."

The jade buckle in his hand glimmered faintly with colored light, and the immortal foundation within him, the Molten Metal Cave, continued to operate. Shadows appeared in his pupils as he counted silently, "The Yu Family's Jade Smoke Mountain, the Li Family's Qingche Sword, and Daoist He's Nine Gates Temple."

"Hmm?"

A trace of purple light flashed in Yu Muxian's eyes, and he smiled slightly, whispering to himself, "Oh... there is also a hidden spear!"

He withdrew his gaze and glanced around him, raising an eyebrow in curiosity.

"A minor Mount Yue cultivator possessing a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact... Ah, he must be from Duanmu Kui's Mount Wu, I guess it's no surprise they'd have one or two valuable items on hand!"

Yu Muxian examined for a while, then frowned with a hint of disdain in his eyes, envisioning the mountains of corpses and seas of blood. He thought to himself, The Mountain of Human Heads... what a sinister dharma artifact!

Despite his disdain, Yu Muxian could not help but admire the clever design of the artifact. He then mused, There are ten Foundation Establishment Realm legacies and five Foundation Establishment Realm artifacts around this lake. Aside from the three sects and seven gates, no place in Yue State is richer than Moongaze Lake!

While he was lost in thought, the Dawn Cloudliner came to a gentle stop. Yu Muxian disembarked slowly, hearing a chorus of respectful greetings from the mountain below.

"Welcome, Emissary!"

Yu Muxian looked up to see a crowd of bowing cultivators. He rubbed the jade buckle and responded, "No need for formalities!"

The cultivators straightened up right away and returned to their seats. A middle-aged cultivator with a haggard face but hawk-like, piercing eyes that were full of sinister intensity approached Yu Muxian, bowing deeply and cupping his fist.

"Yu Mugao of the Milin Yu Family greets the Emissary!"

This man was his older brother by blood.

"Rise."

Yu Muxian's icy demeanor faltered slightly as he gazed at Yu Mugao, who slowly lifted his head.

Yu Mugao spoke respectfully and courteously, "Thank you, Emissary."

The two brothers locked eyes for a moment, their gazes clashing in silence—one with a hawk-like gaze, the other as cold as snow. Their faces bore a striking resemblance, yet their auras were entirely different.




# Chapter 354: The Jade Buckle

The group of cultivators from Milin Prefecture paid their tributes. The Dawn Cloudliner, with its colorful radiance and long tail, docked in the sky, casting a beautiful golden-red reflection.

Meanwhile at the Li Residence...

In a dim room shrouded in white mist, a bluish-gray mirror slowly floated up, vibrating incessantly and emitting dazzling white light. Lu Jiangxian's divine sense suppressed the trembling of the mirror, and he was filled with suspicion and alarm.

"T-This is...!"

Various illusions appeared before his eyes—a rushing clear stream, a treasure vault glittering with mana lights, a young boy's tender face, fair arms, towering mountains with immortals traversing them, gushing spirit springs, and a cave-dwelling abundant with spiritual qi.

Finally... the vision lingered on the radiant Dawn Cloudliner.

"There is a mirror fragment on the Dawn Cloudliner!"

Lu Jiangxian had experienced this reaction before. The jade stones by the lake and the jade pendant in the old Daoist's hand had both caused similar feelings of trepidation. Now that the mirror's power had gradually recovered, these impulses had grown even stronger.

"Who is it..."

The mirror floated up again, with twelve ancient runes shining one by one on its surface. If not for Lu Jiangxian's suppression, it would have already flown away long ago, drawing the fragments together in reunion.

This sensation and phenomenon even emanated from the mirror, ricocheting within the sealed dark room and transforming into various mystical visions.

Patterns on the ground suddenly sprouted osmanthus trees with golden-white flowers hanging down from their branches. Their stamens were like gold, exuding a pleasant fragrance, and appearing particularly brilliant in the misty moonlight.

The rustling sound grew louder, and a few energetic and lively toads hopped out from the shadows, playing among the fallen osmanthus flowers. A jade buckle appeared in the reflection of the bluish-gray mirror.

"Yu Muxian..! It is on Yu Muxian!"

Amidst the illusions, Lu Jiangxian recognized the face resembling Yu Mugao's, exuding an ethereal aura. Who else could it be but Yu Muxian?

RUMBLE!

The sunlight above the Li Residence dimmed. The mirror's internal world shook, its tremors tracing back through the connection of the talisman seeds. Outside, the talisman seeds trembled, emitting white light.

Li Ximing, who was the closest, was quietly reading an alchemy text in the great hall. His qihai acupoint suddenly churned, radiating brilliant light that caused him intense pain, making him cry out in agony.

"AHH!"

He curled up in pain, breaking out in a cold sweat almost immediately.

Li Yuanping, who was reading a secret letter in the Clan Affairs Courtyard, was startled by the child's scream. He jumped up, not even bothering to put on his shoes, and rushed to the child's side.

"Ming'er! Ming'er!" he called out anxiously.

Li Ximing was Li Yuanping's only son and a precious asset to the Li Family. Naturally, his distress threw Li Yuanping into a panic. He reached out to touch the child's forehead and found it cold and clammy, much to his dismay. When he lifted his hand, he discovered it was covered in transparent mucus.

"This..."

The mucus was icy cold. As it dripped to the ground, it transformed into golden-white petals that scattered everywhere, leaving Li Yuanping stunned.

The petals were striking, shattering upon contact with the ground and rising as bright, moon-like yin energy. The sight blew Li Yuanping's mind.

Dou Yi, standing at the far end, was terrified by the scene. With Li Yuanping's lifespan limited and Madam Dou being heartless, the entire Dou Family depended on young Li Ximing. Dou Yi hurriedly rushed up the steps, alarmed by the turn of events.

"Young master?!"

As the Li Family ascended to the status of a clan, more and more rogue cultivators visited, and the standards for such visits were modeled after those of other clans in Yue State. The upper staircase had over twenty steps, and it took Dou Yi several moments to climb them all.

Dou Yi had just ascended the last few steps when he rushed forward to find Li Yuanping. Li Yuanping turned abruptly, his gray-black pupils dilated, and his forehead covered in a sheen of sweat. The gentleness in his face was completely gone, replaced by a grim and fierce expression.

"Get out!!" he shouted fiercely.

Dou Yi had been with him for almost ten years and had only ever seen such an expression on Li Yuanjiao's face. Li Yuanping was usually much more composed and gentle, and seeing him like this now made Dou Yi's heart pound in fear. He stumbled backward, missed a step, and fell, rolling down the dozen steps.

THUD!

Living a life of luxury and indulgence in recent years had left Dou Yi quite plump, and he rolled all the way to the bottom of the stairs with a heavy thud. Without daring to lift his head, he grabbed his robe and scrambled out of the hall hastily.

Li Yuanping stood at the top, his body trembling slightly. He dared not move an inch, using his wide robe to cover the trembling Li Ximing in his arms.

"Everyone, leave!" he instructed firmly.

It was not until the clinking sounds of armor had faded and the guards at the sides of the stairs had retreated did he quickly grab the alchemy book from the table.

In his haste, Li Yuanping knocked over ink and brushes which fell with a clatter. He paid no attention to the mess, frantically patting the few bright streams of moonlight-like energy beneath him.

Only when the last of the Supreme Yin Moonlight disappeared and the entire hall had turned cold did a bit of color return to his face.

"Father..."

Li Ximing attempted to rise amidst the scattered osmanthus petals.

Li Yuanping hurriedly embraced him, relieved to find that the boy was unharmed. He murmured, "Immortal Mirror... It's the Immortal Mirror..."

Meanwhile on Mount Wutu...

Li Xizhi suddenly looked up, staring at the scattered petals in his hands.

Hundreds of li away at the Cloud Crowned Peak market, Li Xuanxuan, who was bargaining with a customer, abruptly fell silent, hearing a faint rustling sound...

In the Yi Mountain City...

In the Milin Prefecture...

All those who received a Profound Pearl Talisman Seed looked up simultaneously, gazing into the distance pensively as an ethereal face and a translucent, smooth jade buckle appeared before their eyes.

————

Li Yuanjiao suddenly raised his head, the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed in his qihai acupoint vibrating intensely. A point of white light appeared in his eyes and he felt a strong attraction, his gaze fixed on Yu Muxian's white robe.

"Yu Muxian... Jade buckle..."

Seeing Yu Muxian seemingly sense something and look up, Li Yuanjiao slowly lowered his head. He had once read in the family's history about Li Tongya back when he was still a mortal, who had ventured into the reed marshes at night and found that jade stone, a feat that seemed impossible.

The vastness of the reed marshes made it akin to finding a needle in a haystack... How could a mere mortal find it? He had attributed it to Li Tongya's unique fortune, which was different from ordinary people.

Now, truly facing the legendary treasure that could fuse with the mirror, he realized its wondrous nature. Even without looking at Yu Muxian, he could feel the jade buckle in his hand.

At the top, Yu Muxian felt a sudden sense of unease, a fleeting pang that vanished as quickly as it came, leaving no trace behind.

Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators who had refined their immortal foundations possessed certain mystic abilities. A sudden premonition was a significant matter, but after thoroughly inspecting himself and finding nothing out of place, he could only cast suspicious glances at those below him.

"Milin Prefecture's Yu Family!"

The attendant of the immortal sect began calling names, and Yu Muxian dismissed his distractions, quietly watching his brother bow and withdraw. He then stood upright.

His gaze lingered on Yu Mugao's gaunt cheeks and haggard figure. The burdens of thought and schemes seemed to have crushed the man. Despite being at the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm cultivation, he was tormented to this state by the internal strife and intense struggles within the Yu Family.

With Yu Xiaogui severely injured and in seclusion, the various branches of the Yu Family, already dissatisfied with Yu Mugao's control, had erupted into chaos, each faction acting independently. If not for the absence of news confirming Yu Xiaogui's death and Yu Mugao's ruthless methods, the situation might have already turned disastrous.

"Sixteen stalks of Autumn Moon Grass, two thousand jin of Purple Jade Spirit Rice, ninety pieces of Azure Pool Essence Stones, seven Long Sea Pearls..."

Box after box of spirit items were carried to the stage. Yu Muxian, rubbing the jade buckle in his hand, reflected internally, If I had not found this treasure as a child, which allowed me to see through people's true nature and sever worldly ties, I might have ended up mired in the power struggles of the Yu Family at Moongaze Lake… facing a tragic fate.

"Li Family of Lijing!"

Yu Muxian was lost in thought when the attendant's voice brought him back to reality. A young man in black came forward, broad-shouldered with high-set eyebrows, exuding an ambitious air that made him seem untrustworthy at first glance.

"Li Yuanjiao of the Li Family greets the Emissary!" Li Yuanjiao responded with composure, his gaze fixed on Yu Muxian's robe.

Yu Muxian nodded and said warmly, "I have long heard of the Sword Immortal's fame."

He cupped his fist, smiling as he continued, "The Qingche Sword that the Sword Immortal wielded was crafted by my master's own hands. Yuanwu Peak has always had good relations with Qingsui Peak. There is no need for such formalities, fellow Daoist."

These words not only stirred Li Yuanjiao but also drew the attention of the various families around the lake. Yu Mugao slowly closed his eyes, saying nothing.

"So, there is such a connection…"

Yu Muxian's excessive friendliness made Li Yuanjiao uncertain of his intentions. He responded vaguely, and Yu Muxian said no more, simply standing there with his hands clasped behind his back.

As box after box of spirit items were brought up and all the families reported, an attendant verified everything. A young cultivator in green then stepped forward, respectfully addressing Yu Muxian, "Senior Brother, the three clans and sixteen prominent families of Moongaze Lake, along with forty-one smaller households, have all been checked. Please review them."

Yu Muxian took the record from him and read aloud the names of the families marked for discrepancies—either underreporting or for the poor quality of spirit items. Immediately, several disciples in green stepped forward and dragged the offenders out unceremoniously.

Thud!

The people from several families trembled and kneeled. Yu Muxian chuckled lightly and asked, "Junior Brother, how are these cases usually handled?"

The reporting disciple looked disdainfully at the families below and replied, "They shall be punished according to the severity of the discrepancies—some by executing their elders, others by removing their family name, and some by banishment to Yi Mountain City."

The crowd below immediately began to tremble with fear, begging for mercy out loud repeatedly. Yu Muxian glanced at them and saw that several families were under the jurisdiction of Daoist He on the western shore—most likely unable to pay double taxes.

He then said gently, "Just confiscate the storage pouches from a few people to make up for the shortfall. Otherwise, we'll have to require Senior He's advice and trouble him."

"Understood!"

As soon as he had finished speaking, several uniformed cultivators seized the storage pouches from those individuals. Despite their pleas and cries, the cultivators handed the pouches to Yu Muxian, who calmly tucked them into his sleeve. Then he said, "The clans should stay; the rest may leave now."

The smaller households felt as if they had received a pardon and they bid their farewells, then quickly scattered like the wind. In an instant, only the Azure Pond cultivators and the Fei, Li, and Yu families remained on the mountaintop.

Although the Fei Family had lost Fei Wangbai, they were still recognized as a clan by the Azure Pond Sect and therefore did not leave. Representing the Fei Family was Fei Tongyu, who had just reached the Qi Cultivation Realm. His aura was unstable, indicating that he had used some medicinal aid.

Yu Muxian swung his sleeve, stepped forward, and cupped his fist to Fei Tongyu. His immortal grace was evident as he said regretfully, "You must be the young master of the Fei Family… I have heard about Senior Wangbai's passing. As a cultivator under our sect, his death caused quite a stir within the sect, and we sent people to investigate."

Shaking his head with regret, he continued in a low voice, "Unfortunately, the culprit remains elusive, and we have not uncovered any information."

"Thank you for your effort..." Fei Tongyu responded, pretending to be moved by his words as he exchanged pleasantries with Yu Muxian.

Yu Muxian then said, "The Fei Family has provided tributes for many years. Our sect feels obliged to offer some compensation."

Fei Tongyu's eyes lit up, understanding that the crucial moment had arrived. Yu Muxian smiled and said, "My master has decided that the next disciple slot will go to your clan!"

These words shocked the three families. Several moments of silence passed, with only the whistling wind breaking the quietness.

"What?!" Yu Mugao was utterly stunned, his expression one of disbelief.

Li Yuanjiao appeared thoughtful while Fei Tongyu exclaimed in amazement, "Which peak would that be?"

"Naturally, it will be my Yuanwu Peak!" Yu Muxian announced.

After the initial shock, Fei Tongyu was visibly overjoyed. Fei Wangbai's greatest regret while he was alive was not being able to support a disciple within the Azure Pond Sect. Now, despite knowing Yu Muxian's likely had ulterior motives, he could not bring himself to refuse such an offer.

My family still needs to send disciples to the sect, so how could the Fei Family refuse? How could they possibly refuse…

Li Yuanjiao stared silently at Yu Muxian's ethereal profile, lost in countless thoughts. For a moment, he was speechless, only thinking to himself, This Yu Muxian... he is indeed a remarkable figure. With this single move, he has restored the tripartite balance on the lake and caused a rift between the Fei Family and mine... Even if the ancestors were still alive, there would be no changing this. He keeps that jade buckle hidden inside his robe, close to his body… It must have many miraculous properties! Obtaining it will definitely not be an easy task... I must plan carefully.
𝒇𝓻𝓮𝓮𝙬𝙚𝒃𝒏𝓸𝙫𝒆𝙡.𝓬𝓸𝒎

Meanwhile, Yu Muxian discussed some details with Fei Tongyu. Afterward, he turned to address Yu Mugao and Li Yuanjiao, saying softly, "Greetings, fellow Daoists!"

Yu Muxian was a Foundation Establishment Realm immortal cultivator, and both of them felt unworthy of being addressed as fellow Daoists by him. Before they could decline and refuse, Yu Muxian continued, "Every seventy years, the various peaks of the sect rotate their jurisdictions. Moongaze Lake now falls under the jurisdiction of Yuanwu Peak. In recent years, my junior brothers have been handling peak-related affairs, and we have not made proper agreements with you all. This has caused many disturbances on the lake, which is our peak's fault."

Li Yuanjiao dared not let him apologize and quickly brushed things off. Yu Mugao, on the other hand, stared at Yu Muxian in confusion and disbelief, as if he could no longer recognize his younger brother.

Yu Muxian then continued, "So I reported to my master, and Yuanwu Peak has re-evaluated the current situation and redefined the boundaries, which I have brought to you."

With a gentle pat on his silk pouch, three light green jade seals appeared in his hand, which he distributed to the three of them. His gaze finally carried a hint of warning as he said coldly, "With these boundaries set, minor conflicts between minor households will not be our concern, but the major clans must not engage in further disputes! This is also my master's intention..."

Li Yuanjiao received the light green jade seal and brushed it lightly with his hand. The seal emitted a golden light, revealing several large golden characters—Under the jurisdiction of Azure Pond Sect.

Immediately, the boundaries' outlines appeared in silvery light, encompassing Lijing, Huaqian, Huazhong, Yuting, and even including Mount Wutu and Eastern Mount Yue.

The Li Family had previously held a jade seal left by Si Yuanbai, which only marked the four towns of Lijing. It could not compare to this new one.

Now that Yuanwu Peak had acknowledged the legitimacy of the Li Family's territory, Li Yuanjiao felt a sense of relief and responded, "We will strictly follow the Daoist Master's decree!"

Fei Tongyu was even more overjoyed. Of the three major clans on the lake, his was the weakest. He responded eagerly and felt greatly relieved.

Seeing Li Yuanjiao and Fei Tongyu both agree, Yu Muxian nodded approvingly.

"Thank you, fellow Daoists."




# Chapter 356: Conclusion

As soon as Li Yuanjiao put away the jade seal, he caught sight of a stream of light rising in the distance, quickly approaching them. A man and a woman were riding a flying shuttle and soon landed nearby. Several Azure Pond Sect disciples rose on their flying shuttles promptly, forming hand seals as they shouted in unison, "The Azure Pond Cloudliner is here, who goes there?"

The woman, riding the flying shuttle, furrowed her brows but did not stop. She bypassed the disciples, and the spells they cast were futile as they were blocked by a few talismans she threw out, causing them to fall heavily to the ground.

These disciples were outer disciples of the Azure Pond Sect, only slightly higher in status than attendants, and were all at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. The woman managed to barge through them, panting as she landed beside Li Yuanjiao.

"Brother!" she urgently called out.

"Qingxiao?!"

Li Yuanjiao was taken aback, greatly shocked. The female cultivator before him, her face slightly flushed, was none other than Li Qingxiao. She was only at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, yet she stood behind him with her hand on her sword, watching the others intently.

Li Yuanjiao, understanding that Li Qingxiao had come to support him, felt deeply moved but also slightly angered. He whispered sharply, "Why are you so reckless?!"

A man at the back hurriedly stepped forward, pulling Li Qingxiao behind him, and awkwardly cleared his throat before speaking in an apologetic tone.

"Xiao Xian of the Xiao Family greets the immortal sect's Emissary. My wife does not understand the rules and has been disrespectful… I hope you can forgive us."

"No matter." Yu Muxian's gaze lingered briefly on Li Qingxiao and Xiao Xian before continuing, "I will not hold you here any longer. Feel free to go about your business!"

"Thank you, Emissary. Yuanjiao shall take his leave now," Li Yuanjiao replied as he discreetly glanced at Yu Muxian's robe. Li Qingxiao seemed bewildered and was about to say something but closed her mouth obediently after receiving a stern look from Li Yuanjiao.

The Li Family members, feeling as if they had received a pardon, quickly flew off. Li Qingxiao and Xiao Xian, unable to fly since they were not Qi Cultivators, followed on their flying shuttle.

After traveling a few li, Li Qingxiao complained, "Brother, how could you keep such a huge matter from me?! I only heard about it from home. Did Yu Muxian… give our family any trouble?"

"No, he did not." Li Yuanjiao shook his head and explained the situation to her briefly. Then, he turned to Xiao Xian and cupped his fist. "I apologize for my younger sister's ignorance!"

"No apologies needed!" Xiao Xian hurriedly replied, waving his hands.

"I am only an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator without much ability and rely on Xiao Family's influence. This was not only Qingxiao's impulsive decision; I've considered it as well."

Seeing Xiao Xian speaking up for Li Qingxiao, Li Yuanjiao thought more highly of him. Li Qingxiao, ignoring the politeness between the two men, nodded thoughtfully and said, "I heard Yu Muxian is the precious son-in-law of Daoist Master Yuanwu and usually does not involve himself with the Yu Family. From what I have seen, he seems quite unkind and unloyal…"

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly, distracted as he was still thinking about the jade buckle. Xiao Xian hesitated briefly before speaking in a low voice, "Not necessarily… I have a clan uncle who was close to the Yu Family. He mentioned knowing the younger generation of the Yu Family."

Feeling it was awkward to speak about the Xiao Family's past attempts to support the Yu Family, Xiao Xian reluctantly continued as both Li Qingxiao and Li Yuanjiao were looking at him expectantly.

"My clan uncle once said that the Yu Family has four successors! Yu Mugao is thoughtful and resourceful, Yu Muyuan is bright and courageous, Yu Mujian is pure-hearted, and Yu Muxian is gentle and generous… If Yu Muxian leads, with Mugao, Muyuan, and Mujian as his supporters, they will shine for generations. No one could oppose them."

He paused, feeling somewhat embarrassed. Now that Yu Muyuan was dead, Yu Muxian was heartless, and Yu Mujian had left the family, only Yu Mugao was left struggling to support the family. Xiao Xian could not help but think to himself, Clan Uncle said it with such confidence... no wonder he has not returned home for years. He must be afraid of becoming a laughing stock.

While he pondered silently, he spoke, "Judging by those words, Yu Muxian should not be this heartless."

Li Qingxiao looked thoughtfu as she said, "Who knows? Perhaps he feels he cannot afford not to be heartless, to gain others' trust, or maybe..."

Her voice became soft and eerie as she continued, "Perhaps Tang Yuanwu has cast some divine ability on him, planted some spell in his mind… I have heard that the Purple Mansion Realm's divine abilities are the most sinister. It is possible that one of the old ancestors from the Azure Pond Sect has taken over his body."

With these words, both of them felt a chill down their spines. After a brief silence, Xiao Xian whispered, "He's a Daoist Master… Let us not call him by name so casually."

Tang Yuanwu had been a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator for many years. He founded Yuanwu Peak and then went into seclusion to cultivate a second divine ability, passing the position of peak master to his son.

Tang Yuanwu's son managed the peak for many years and reached the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. It was only a few years ago that he perished in an attempt to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, forcing Tang Yuanwu to come out of seclusion to take over once more.

Xiao Xian explained all this and added, "Yu Muxian also married Tang Yuanwu's daughter. He is quite famous in the sect, and it will not be long before he becomes the master of Yuanwu Peak."

Li Yuanjiao finally realized why Yu Muxian was so eager to stabilize the situation around the lake—it was all to prepare for his ascension to peak master. He nodded slowly as it all came together in his mind. The group landed before the Li Family's mountain, where Li Yuanping was already waiting in the courtyard.

"Borhter Ping!" Li Qingxiao called out.

Li Yuanping was momentarily stunned upon seeing her but then greeted her happily, "Sister Qingxiao!"

Li Qingxiao, having been married into the Xiao Family for several years, had grown accustomed to their ways. Despite her ordinary looks, her elegant attire made Li Yuanping take a moment to recognize her.

After a brief chat, she smiled and said, "I have not seen our parents in years. I will first take my husband to greet them, and then come down the mountain to discuss matters with Second Brother."

"Of course," Li Yuanjiao responded with a tender smile as he nodded. After Li Qingxiao and her husband went up the mountain, he then hurried into the hall and asked in a low voice, "Has there been any unusual activity at home?"

Li Yuanping nodded calmly and replied, "Ximing, Xizhi, and Xijun all had visions. When I asked them carefully, they all described seeing a man in white holding a jade buckle."

Originally, Li Ximing had been cultivating in Lijing Town under Li Yuanping's watch. With Li Xizhi preparing to enter the Azure Pond Sect, he had been spending more time with their mother. Li Yuanping had already called the children back and hidden them on the mountain.

Li Yuanping himself had not received any talismans and thus felt nothing significant. However, Li Yuanjiao had felt it profoundly. He shook his head and said gravely, "This is... caused by the immortal mirror. Up the mountain we go!"

On Mount Lijing...

The two men quickly undid the layers of protective formations and strode into the courtyard. The garden was lush and vibrant, bathed in golden sunlight, exuding a sense of vitality.

They hurried to the ancestral hall, pushing open the thick stone door. Immediately, a burst of white qi current rushed out, forcing them to step back as a chilling sensation enveloped their bodies.

The mist swirled in the courtyard, causing leaves and flowers to fall. The green branches turned yellow and withered, creating a cascade of dead leaves. In an instant, the once spring-like courtyard moments before had turned into an autumn scene, filled with a chilling atmosphere.

Li Yuanjiao stepped into the secret chamber and saw five or six small osmanthus trees that had sprouted within. Snow-white jade rabbits and yellow-green toads hopped around on the ground, filling him with astonishment.

The ground was covered with fallen osmanthus flowers, and white moonlight mist spread everywhere. A bluish-gray mirror floated in the air, emitting ribbons of bright light, exuding an impressive aura.

"This is..."

Li Yuanjiao carefully stepped around the hopping toads and rabbits on the ground, approaching the stone platform. He greeted respectfully, "Descendant of the Li Family greets the immortal mirror!"

Whether it was his words or the gradual departure of the Dawn Cloudliner returning to the Azure Pond Sect in the south, the light on the mirror gradually dimmed but remained dazzling.

Li Yuanping, only at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, could not withstand the aura and dared not enter the chamber until the light had faded slightly. Even then, he felt the cold biting into his bones.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the various phenomena in the dark chamber exploded, transforming into thick moonlight, resembling wisps of pure white mist. They swirled rapidly around Li Yuanjiao, who was kneeling in the center. Before him, the mist condensed into a jade buckle.

Li Yuanjiao kneeled before the stone platform, watching the moonlight coalesce into the clear jade buckle. With a solemn expression, he said, "Li Yuanjiao, a descendant of the Li Family, has received the command..."

The radiance slowly receded and the mirror reverted to its dull, gray state. The moonlight flowed back into the mirror from the stone platform. Li Yuanjiao bowed once more before standing up slowly.

The two brothers exited the dark chamber, the stone door closing silently behind them. Li Yuanping then said gravely, "Brother, Yu Muxian is a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, and a member of the Azure Pond Sect at that... We must plan carefully."

"I understand," Li Yuanjiao replied, narrowing his eyes. He continued in a low voice, "Besides, it seems Yu Muxian has also benefited from that jade buckle. He constantly keeps it hidden in his sleeve, often rubbing it subconsciously... His remarkable achievements and rapid cultivation on Yuanwu Peak must be linked to this treasure."

"That makes it even harder!" Li Yuanping exclaimed in exasperation as he shook his head and said seriously, "First, we should send Xizhi into the sect to gather information. As long as the jade buckle remains with Yu Muxian, we can eventually find a way to get our hands on it."

Nodding, Li Yuanjiao left the courtyard with his brother. Li Yuanping continued, "Regarding the matter of the Golden Yang Radiant Origin, this is of great importance and concerns our future path. It will take considerable time and effort. We need a reliable and capable Qi Cultivator to collect the qi."

"Are you suggesting...?" Li Yuanjiao's voice trailed off as his mind conjured up a name. He exchanged a glance with his brother and asked, "Uncle Chen Donghe?!"

"Exactly!" Li Yuanping pursed his lips and continued, "To the west of Moongaze Lake lies the territory of the Golden Feather Sect, with several deserts... We can send someone to search that area. If there is no pass that stretches a thousand li, we may have to head north."

"Go ahead and make the arrangements," Li Yuanjiao responded, fully trusting Li Yuanping. When he noticed Li Yuanping's pale complexion, he frowned and asked, "Why do you look so frail? There are many family matters to handle... Let Xicheng get some practice. Use more spirit herbs and do not strain yourself."

"Heh." Li Yuanping shook his head and replied, "My body is inherently flawed, like a leaking jar. No amount of spirit herbs will help. Maintaining my current cultivation without regression has already consumed many resources."

As they spoke, they arrived at a small courtyard at the foot of the mountain, taking seats one after the other. Li Yuanping waved his hand to shift the topic away from himself and continued, "Speaking of Xicheng... he is soft-hearted and indecisive, popular among the younger generation, but not fit to manage the household. A few days ago, I gave him some tasks, but he was indecisive and was easily swayed by others' opinions. I had to send him to Mount Yue to manage the Spirit Paddies."

Although Li Yuanjiao trusted him, Li Yuanping made sure to explain the situation to avoid any misunderstanding, lest his brother thought he was mistreating the eldest son of the second lineage.

Li Yuanjiao, holding a cup of tea, replied, "It is not a big deal. I see Xijun is clever. Both he and Ximing show great promise. We should not be too hard on Xicheng."

Li Yuanjiao, once fierce and bloodthirsty, had mellowed significantly after enduring the deaths of his older brother and granduncle.

Placing his cup down, he recounted Yu Muxian's visit in detail. Li Yuanping sighed, "Now that a Fei Family disciple has entered Yuanwu Peak, they are at least a junior fellow of Yu Muxian, possibly even his disciple. They will find it hard to align with us as before..."

"More than that..." Li Yuanjiao shook his head and was about to respond when he was interrupted by a well-dressed woman entering the courtyard.

She greeted warmly, "Brother, Yuanping."

Li Qingxiao had just ascended the mountain, meeting a few from the Yuan generation. When she asked about the family's situation, Li Yuanping explained everything in detail, speaking softly, "The family has been doing well these past few years... The ancestor has also gained some insights and is in seclusion for cultivation. You do not need to worry."

"All right..." Li Qingxiao's eyes were slightly red, showing a hint of reluctance. She spoke softly, "My husband has finished his duties in the clan over the past few years. We planned to return to Mount Yu, but when I heard about this, I hurried over. I cannot stay long and have to quickly bid farewell to our parents."

"Mount Yu is quite far from Moongaze Lake. If anything happens at home, it will be difficult to return promptly," she explained, then kneeled and bowed deeply.

"I must trouble Big Brother and Brother Ping to take care of my parents. Qingxiao is forever grateful!" she said.

"Just go without worries..." Li Yuanjiao said as he turned to the side, refusing her formalities. He shook his head slightly and continued in a low voice, "Focus on assisting your husband on Mount Yu. Do not worry about family matters to avoid unnecessary gossip. In a few years, when you have children, bring them back to see me."

"Yes!" Li Qingxiao responded gently and left with Xiao Xian on their flying shuttles.

Li Yuanjiao then turned to Li Yuanping and said, "Soon, I will return to Mount Wutu for seclusion. By then, Qinghong should also be out of seclusion. While she stabilizes her newfound power, you may approach her for any issues."

"Understood..." Li Yuanping responded, watching Li Yuanjiao calculate the time.

Li Yuanjiao then spoke in a serious tone, "Inform Qinghong that three months from now, on the Earth Pig day, wait in the mountain together. I will come home then."

Translator Note: What is Earth Pig Day (Ji Hai Day)?

The Chinese calendar uses a 60-year cycle called the sexagenary cycle, which combines two sets of symbols: the 10 Heavenly Stems (like a set of numbers) and the 12 Earthly Branches (like a set of letters).

Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches:

Heavenly Stems: These are like numbers from 1 to 10 (Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin, Ren, Gui).

Earthly Branches: These are like letters from A to L (Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Wu, Wei, Shen, You, Xu, Hai).

The cycle combines one stem with one branch to create 60 unique pairs, like "1A," "2B," etc.

Ji is the sixth stem, and Hai is the twelfth branch.

Hence, Ji-Hai (Earth Pig) Day is one specific combination in this 60-pair cycle. It represents a specific day in this cycle, which repeats every 60 days.

TLDR: "Ji-Hai Day" is like a special code or name for a specific day in a traditional Chinese 60-day calendar cycle, similar to how we have names for the days of the week. This cycle repeats every 60 days. We don't really use this system anymore in the modern day.

Example:

Li Yuanping was momentarily puzzled, not understanding the significance of the date. The annual sacrificial ceremony was in winter, which was far from that date. Unable to contain his curiosity, he asked, "What is this about...?"

"It has been five years..."

Li Yuanjiao sighed deeply, his lips barely moving as he used his mana to transmit his voice to Li Yuanping's ear, "It has been five years since the ancestor's life jade broke. Following his instructions, we should open the entrance to Meiche cave dwelling to welcome his immortal remains."




# Chapter 358: Five Years Since My Death

Three months passed quietly. Li Qinghong, clad in jade armor, arrived by riding the wind.

She still looked like she was in her early twenties. The spear in her hand was sharp and her jade armor was crystalline, adorned with intricate patterns. This was an Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifact.

Armor-type artifacts were extremely expensive, second only to alchemy furnaces. This set was discovered when the family conquered Mount Yuting, and Li Tongya had gifted it to Li Qinghong, who in turn had given it to Li Yuanping.

However, Li Yuanping insisted on sending it back, having Li Xicheng carry it to Mount Yuting for Li Qinghong, making poor Li Xicheng run back and forth, exhausted and out of breath.

She took a few steps into the hall. Li Yuanping, who was seated at the end of the hall, raised his head. The spirited woman stood there conspicuously with her spear and dazzling jade armor. He quickly got up and smiled warmly with fondness in his eyes.

"Sister Hong."

Li Qinghong smiled radiantly and stepped forward, her eyes shimmering with purple hues as she assessed Li Yuanping. She then remarked in a spirited tone, "Your cultivation is about to be overtaken by Xizhi!"

Li Yuanping smiled gently. Li Ximing stepped forward, bowed respectfully, and said, "Ximing greets Auntie!"

"Our family alchemist has arrived," Li Qinghong said teasingly, making Li Ximing blush.

Li Yuanping saw that Li Qinghong's cultivation had advanced significantly, noting she had been at the fifth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm for a while, and sighed, "You and Brother Jiao's cultivation speed is truly astonishing. Back then, Yu Mujian was considered highly gifted for reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm before thirty. You and Brother Jiao are not even thirty, yet both of you are already at the fifth and sixth heavenly layers respectively. How truly remarkable!"

Li Qinghong laughed heartily before speaking seriously, "An Jingming reached the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm in his twenties... We are nothing compared to him."

Li Yuanping nodded, recounting recent events. Li Qinghong listened carefully, pondered for a moment, and said, "I spent some time with the Fei Family and am familiar with the Fei brothers—Fei Tongyu and Fei Tongxiao."

Her eyes gleamed with a purple hue as she continued softly, "Fei Tongyu is handsome, gentle, and amiable, but lacks decisiveness. He can go with the flow but not survive adversity. Fei Tongxiao is brave and resolute but loyal, and would not betray our family's kindness."

Li Yuanping rarely heard news about these two, so he cherished this information, listening and taking notes mentally. Li Qinghong then smiled and said, "Even if a member of the Fei Family joins the sect, these two would not easily turn against us. At most, they would be indecisive and try to balance both sides, so there is no need to worry!"

They conversed for a while, becoming somber as they remembered their purpose today. Li Yuanjiao and Li Xuanxuan were already approaching the hall. Li Xuanxuan appeared to have just rushed home from the market.

Now over fifty, his temples were graying, and he was stern and unsmiling. The younger generation quickly went up to greet him. The four of them, all clad in white robes, exchanged glances. Li Yuanjiao then gave them the solemn command.

"Let us go up the mountain."

————

Meiche Peak cave dwelling was discovered by Li Xiangping and Li Tongya, who used the Supreme Yin Profound Light to break it open. It had been renovated multiple times with smooth stones, complex formation patterns, and two majestic stone lions.

The four of them stood on the platform before the cave dwelling. Li Yuanjiao performed a series of hand seals and cast a spell, but the door of the cave dwelling remained motionless. He was slightly stunned and frowned.

"It is sealed from the inside..."

Seeing this, the other three turned to Li Qinghong. She practiced spear techniques and had mastered lightning-type skills, excelling in breaking through barriers. Li Yuanping cupped his fists and said, "Elder sister, please."

Li Qinghong, hearing this, stepped forward with her spear, silently apologizing in her heart before swinging the spear. Lightning surged along the spear, concentrating at the tip of it.

"Ha!"

Li Qinghong thrust her spear with great force, swinging it down with a backhand strike. Purple lightning, taking the form of a serpent dragon with its claws bared, crashed into the stone door.
𝘧𝑟𝑒𝑒𝘸𝘦𝘣𝑛𝑜𝘷𝑒𝓁.𝘤𝘰𝓂

This was the Dragon Reflection technique gifted by the Fei Family five years ago, adept at breaking formations and defeating enemies. Li Qinghong had practiced it for years and mastered it, and it was perfect for this occasion.

BOOM!

The formation on the stone door, primarily designed for gathering spiritual energy, suddenly lit up and shattered. Li Yuanjiao and Li Xuanxuan had prepared in advance, pressing their hands against the wall to absorb the aftermath and protect the stone door.

When the last trace of purple lightning disappeared, Li Yuanjiao exhaled deeply and slowly pushed open the stone door.

Whoosh—

A cold wind rushed out from the cave instantly, dispersing into the sky. The three carefully ascended the steps and entered.

Inside, on a stone bed, a white-clothed youth rested his chin on his hand with a sword on his lap. His eyes were closed, his black hair flowing down, with green water pooled on the floor. The stone table by the door had dew dripping from it.

The four stared in a daze at the youth on the bed, bowed together, and then saw the white-clothed youth dissolve into green spirit water, leaving behind coral, glass, mica, and basalt scattered on the ground.

Li Yuanjiao stepped forward and saw writing on the stone table, carved deeply into the surface, with characters like flying dragons and dancing phoenixes—bold and vigorous.

"I have been dead for five years. My eyes have become glass, which can be placed in a box and buried. My bones have turned into mica and basalt; I hope future generations will discard them into the mountain streams for craftsmen to pick up, to be used as a foundation or beam.

My internal organs have turned into green water. Pour it into great rivers and seas, so that I can see the world's scenery. The rest of me has turned into coral and talc, to be scattered in the mountains and forests, or added into medicine and paint.

Final words of Li Tongya, of the Li Family."

In the room, the four remained silent, each with different expressions. Li Xuanxuan gently touched the stone table while Li Yuanjiao took out a jade box, carefully placing the two pieces of glass inside.

He then respectfully removed the Qingche Sword from the bed, holding it close, and said to Li Qinghong, "Sister, please gather the basalt and mica, collect the spirit water, and find a mountain stream and a great river. I will first take Granduncle back to the ancestral hall."

Li Qinghong, with her head bowed, kneeled before the bed, lost in thought. After several moments, she finally managed to utter a word from her lips.

"All right..."

She took out a jade box, carefully picking up the black and white, crystal-clear spirit items with her hands, then used a spell to condense the green spirit water into a water ball. She held it in her hands, then flew away.

Drifting away from Mount Lijing, Li Qinghong flew in silence for a while, searching all around until she finally found a mountain stream.

The spring water trickled melodiously, and the ground was covered with orchid grass. Not far away, there was a small village of mortals, which suited Li Tongya's wishes. She took out the mica and basalt from the jade box and carefully placed them into the spring, one by one.

After finishing her task, Li Qinghong sat down nearby, resting her chin in her hand, gazing thoughtfully.

"Awooo... Awooo..."

She was slightly startled and looked around with reddened eyes. She then noticed a fox with fiery red fur sitting by the stream, crying loudly.

Li Qinghong hesitated, then cautiously stood up and said respectfully, "Junior Li Qinghong greets Senior!"

"Damn it!" the fox cursed, looking up at Li Qinghong.

It spat out a spirit herb and said angrily, "Li Tongya sealed the mark I left on him. I just found out he is dead now, and I had gone into the mountains to find this medicine for him for nothing! What a waste!"

Though cursing, the fox drooped its head, looking dejected. It glanced at her, picked up a piece of mica from the river, threw the spirit herb back into its mouth, and drawled, "I came to find Li Tongya but saw you burying him. Just happened to stop by."

Then, it took off on a demonic wind, disappearing into the sky like a black wind, heading toward the depths of Mount Dali.

Li Qinghong stood still for a moment, slowly bowed in the direction it had left in, then flew off to find the great river.

The serene mountain stream returned to tranquility. Dew dripped softly, and the stream water tinkled as it flowed. After a long while, a figure slowly emerged from the void.

This person wore white robes, his loose clothing adorned with a piece of green jade at the front of it. His face was indistinct, and a sword dangled from his waist. He stood with his hands behind his back.

"Li Tongya..."

He looked down at the mica and basalt in the stream. Lifting one white cloth shoe, he gently kicked a stone, which rolled and tumbled into the water.




# Chapter 359: Testing the Horse

A group of direct descendants discussed for a while and decided to keep Li Tongya's funeral private, only hanging white silk on the mountain. The few direct descendants paid their respects individually before dispersing.

The news of Li Tongya's passing had already been known to a few direct descendants, who had completed their mourning period three years ago. Now, they merely felt a brief moment of sorrow before quickly returning to their respective duties.

Li Xuanxuan stayed at home for a few days, which was a rare opportunity for him to see Li Yuanping every day. He held Li Ximing with a smile, playing with him as he asked gently, "Ming'er, how much have you read from the alchemy books?"

"I can already summon the Pill Flame!" Li Ximing responded happily as he nodded obediently, bringing his hands together to summon a pure white flame. It was as gentle as jade and as cool as water, quietly dancing between his palms.

Li Yuanping happily took Li Ximing in his arms and looked at the smiling Li Xuanxuan, whispering, "Father, since you rarely return, you should stay home for a bit longer. Let the others in the family handle the market affairs..."

"No." Li Xuanxuan's expression immediately turned serious as he replied, "I am old and have long lost my drive. Second Uncle saw this clearly, which was why he sent me to the market."

His usually stern face showed a hint of remorse as he continued softly, "Your granduncle understood well. I am not truly talented at overseeing the family; at best, I am just a caretaker. I had made many mistakes while overseeing the family over those years..."

He sighed with a hint of guilt in his voice as he continued, saying, "Back then, the family had only a few members, and my father died young. My uncles always felt like they owed me, so they left the family's responsibilities on my shoulders."

With a tinge of regret on his face, he added gently, "Xuanling is actually far more capable than myself. Second Uncle's favoritism toward me kept him in the background. Even though my father died young, he was still beloved by the villagers and respected by many."

"And me... what about me...?" Li Xuanxuan sighed deeply, his voice hoarse, "A hundred years from now, how will people speak of me...?"

It was the first time Li Yuanping saw his father like this, feeling a pang of sadness in his heart. Just as he was about to speak, Li Xuanxuan smiled slightly and continued, "Fortunately, the family is thriving and orderly. You are better than I am, so do your best!"

With a proud smile, he patted Li Ximing's head, then stepped out of the courtyard and flew away.

Li Yuanping chuckled quietly and looked down. Li Yuanjiao entered the hall just in time, seemingly having waited outside to avoid interrupting their conversation. He sat down, and soon, a person came forward, bowing.

"Family Head, the lord of Eastern Mount Yue, Shamoli, has come alone with a horse, saying he has broken through to the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and wishes to ascend the mountain to cultivate, and is no longer seeking status and power."

"Shamoli?"

Li Yuanping raised an eyebrow and looked at Li Yuanjiao, whispering, "I remember Shamoli has a son named Li Jiman, raised in our family... He is part of our Li Family branch. A few years ago, he went to Mount Yue to manage a city."

"Correct." Li Yuanjiao simply responded as he swirled his cup slightly, indicating that he had already considered this matter. Li Yuanping flipped through the documents on his desk and upon finding a small letter, he frowned as he read it.

"The assessment of the Clan Affairs Courtyard is that he is courteous and possesses the demeanor of a gentleman... What does Brother think of this person?"

Li Yuanjiao, who had spent years cultivating in Eastern Mount Yue, was familiar with these matters. He shook his head upon hearing the question.

"Outwardly, he appears respectful, but inside, he is combative and far less compliant than Shamoli. However, the influential families in Eastern Mount Yue are powerful, and using him as a weapon is not a bad idea," he said thoughtfully.

"Oh." Li Yuanping put away the small letter and took a sip of tea.

At this moment, Dou Yi, who had been waiting for an opportunity to speak, finally found his chance. He spoke softly, "Family Head, Shamoli has tamed a demon horse. It is at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, just a notch below the one from Jianixi. It is said to leave no tracks in the snow and moves like a ghost."

"Oh?" Li Yuanping looked up upon hearing this and exchanged a cheerful glance with his brother.

Li Yuanjiao asked warmly, "Is it a good horse?"

"Of course!" Dou Yi replied fawningly.

However, Li Yuanping shook his head and said, "A good horse must be tested. One that is too wild can harm its rider, while one that is too docile cannot travel a thousand li."

Dou Yi nodded while visibly looking confused, and Li Yuanjiao chuckled as he said, "Then I will leave it to you, Brother Ping..."

"Rest assured, Big Brother!"

Li Yuanping read the letter in his hand and nodded firmly, then said in a deep voice, "Let him in!"

The person at the lower end of the hall responded and left. Soon, a man dressed in fine clothes and a jade crown entered, bowing respectfully.

"Shamoli greets Family Head!"

This was none other than Shamoli, the ruler of Mount Yue, now at the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Although he practiced various unrefined qi, his high-grade technique made him comparable to cultivators of pure qi.

Li Yuanping looked at him and spoke warmly, "Since you wish to renounce your position and cultivate on the mountain, will you follow my brother to Mount Wutu?"

"I could not ask for more!" Shamoli readily replied as he kneeled down on one knee.

After the formalities were completed, Li Yuanjiao stood up and said with a smile, "Then I shall return to the mountain first!"

"Alright!" Li Yuanping nodded, watching his brother and Shamoli leave. He then waved to Li Ximing, who had been crouching quietly by the side observing everyone. He then said with a smile, "Go and change into your riding clothes."

Li Ximing's eyes lit up instantly as he asked, "Father, where are we going?"

Li Yuanping removed his cloak and said warmly, "To test the horse!"

The climate over Moongaze Lake had always been stable, with extreme droughts and floods being rare occurrences. This year, the rain arrived as expected, falling steadily and marking the end of summer as the evening breeze grew cooler.

Recently, Li Yuanping had been in high spirits. Dressed in riding clothes, he rode his horse at full gallop, his usually pale face now flushed with excitement. His son, Li Ximing, nestled against his chest, giggling continuously.

"Hyah!"

Li Yuanping urged his horse forward, galloping down the road and leaving the convoy of carriages, adorned with black flags, far behind them. Normally found reclining on a soft couch, he now exuded a rare heroic aura, laughing heartily and looking carefree.

The Li Family had grown quite prosperous. The horse under Li Yuanping was a tribute from Mount Yue, named "Zhongsuo". It moved silently like a ghost and possessed the strength of someone at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, having been personally tamed by Shamoli and presented to Mount Lijing.

Thrilled with his new steed, Li Yuanping raced from the outskirts of Lijing Town to the outskirts of Wutu City in Mount Yue, with Li Ximing enjoying every moment. His black hair flew in the wind as he asked, "Father! Where are we?!"

"This is eastern Mount Yue," Li Yuanping replied, his spirits high. He suppressed a cough in his throat, reined in his horse, and pointed his whip toward the northern mountain range.

Smiling, he explained, "Beyond these mountains lies Wutu. Legend has it that Lord Xiangping once led his troops through here, only two li from Mu Jiaoman's army. He held his breath and reined his horse, narrowly escaping disaster."

Li Ximing listened intently. Li Yuanping continued in a gentle voice, "These mountains descend into Wutu City, the border city of Mount Yue. It is quite prosperous, and Li Jiman has been managing affairs here for ten years."

"Li Jiman..." Li Ximing pondered for a moment, then said, "Son of Shamoli, heir to the throne of Mount Yue... Soon to inherit the throne."

"Indeed," Li Yuanping agreed with his son's words. As he glanced around, he saw rain dripping from the leaves and knew that the Jade Court guards and several guest cultivators were closely protecting them. Relaxing, he let the horse follow the road at a leisurely pace.

He rode absent-mindedly, his ears twitching slightly as he spoke with interest, "Li Jiman is a clever man, but he is belligerent and treacherous... outwardly respectful but inwardly deceitful."

The horse snorted and climbed a high slope, revealing a panoramic view of the scenery. Screams and roars echoed through the air, mingled with the sight of blood-stained ground.

On the plain below, the walls of Wutu City were visible in the distance. A group of emaciated Mount Yue villagers, trembling and wielding hoes and pitchforks, had surrounded a gray wolf. The wolf, which appeared to have a low level of cultivation, snarled and roared incessantly.

On a nearby hill, a brown carriage fluttered with flags, and long spears were arranged in a row. A group of soldiers sat idly, laughing and joking with each other. At the top sat a young man who was holding a fruit and laughing heartily.

"That must be Li Jiman!" Li Yuanping remarked casually.

In his arms, Li Ximing frowned and whispered, "Father, what is he doing?"

"Watching a show," Li Yuanping replied coldly. He watched as a blueblood below laughed loudly and threw a fruit, hitting the wolf demon on the head, provoking it. In its anger, the wolf howled and tore a nearby man to shreds in an instant.

The peasant, frail and small, was quickly reduced to a pile of remains, further inciting the wolf's fury. It continued howling madly.

The other nobles and Li Jiman on the hill watched intently and burst into laughter as the body fell apart, guts and blood spilling everywhere. Li Ximing could not bear the sight and turned his head away.

"Watch carefully," Li Yuanping patted his shoulder gently and said, "Remember this scene... It will teach you what the prominent families might do behind your back if the laws are not strictly enforced."

He paused and then continued, "When cultivation stagnates and the future seems bleak, when they tire of their luxuries and possess power and strength far beyond ordinary people, they will always come up with new ways to entertain themselves."

Li Ximing nodded thoughtfully. Li Yuanping then sneered and said, "Bring me my bow!"

A Jade Court Guard quickly handed him a longbow. Sitting steadily on the horse, Li Yuanping exhaled, nocked an arrow, and aimed at the people below. He said softly, "Watch closely, my son."

Whoosh—

The arrow shot through the air, its runes glowing with bright white light, descending like a meteor to the ground.

Li Jiman, stretching his arm and holding a fruit, felt indifferent to the scene before him, and seemed to be merely going through the motions. Tian Rong, who was standing beside him, stepped forward and said with a smile, "Jiman, how about this? Quite amusing, is it not?"

"Very amusing!" Li Jiman responded as he glanced at him with hidden disdain, thinking to himself, The Tian Family controls the politics of Eastern Mount Yue... With the old man about to step down, how can I be a puppet like Shamoli? But Tian Zhongqing is cautious. To get leverage on them and negotiate, I must start with Tian Rong...

He seemed to be watching the wolf demon's desperate struggle, but his mind was preoccupied with figuring out how to seize control of Eastern Mount Yue's politics. Just then, a blinding white light descended from the sky.

Boom!

The wolf demon, barely at the first stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, could not withstand the arrow and exploded into pieces, with its blood splattering everywhere. Tian Rong, who had been laughing, looked as though he had been slapped in the face. He jumped up at once and roared,"Insolence! Who dares to disrupt my entertainment!?"

Li Jiman had already risen and looked up. With his peak Embryonic Breathing Realm vision, he instantly recognized the person on the mountain as his mind went blank with fear, his heart pounding in his chest.

"Li Yuanping..."

He fell to his knees with a thud, prostrating himself on the ground, his forehead pressed tightly against the earth. A surge of panic and terror washed over him, his back soaked with sweat instantly, his eyes bloodshot.

The Family Head despises those who oppress and harm commoners... I am finished! Who set me up... Tian Zhongqing... yes, it must be the Tian Family... Tian Zhongqing... Damn it! No wonder he wanted me to come to this remote place for a feast! I'll remember this, Tian Rong!

A wave of unease swept over the gathered Mount Yue lords, and they all kneeled on the ground. Tian Rong stood there in a daze for a few moments. After attempting to pull some of the kneeling people up, he too realized what was happening and kneeled, bewildered.

Halfway up the mountain, Li Yuanping, clad in riding attire, held the delicate Li Ximing in his arms, his expression calm as he quietly observed them.

"Father... They are so afraid of you! Are you going to kill them?"

The boy's clear voice echoed through the mountain, sending chills down the spines of those below. Li Jiman clenched his eyes shut, wishing he could tear Tian Rong and the Tian Family to pieces.

Li Yuanping steadily held the reins, leaning close to his eldest son's ear and whispered, "No. Li Jiman is a smart man, but Tian Zhongqing and the Tian Family are even smarter."

He handed the bow to one of the Jade Court Guards without looking at the people kneeling below with their foreheads touching the ground, and whispered to Li Ximing, "Father will now teach you how a wise man controls a group of wise men."

"All right!" Li Ximing answered expectantly.
𝗳𝚛𝚎𝚎𝘄𝕖𝕓𝕟𝕠𝚟𝚎𝕝.𝗰𝕠𝐦

Li Yuanping then smiled coldly, tugged the reins, turned the horse around, and Zhongsuo began to walk quietly, its hoofbeats silent, slowly disappearing into the forest they had come from.

The Jade Court Guards on both sides glanced coldly at the people below before following the horse and vanishing as well. After several breaths, Li Jiman finally raised his head and shouted, "Family Head, you have unparalleled insight! I am grateful beyond words!"

Only the whistling wind answered him, and hatred almost overflowed from Li Jiman's eyes.

"The Tian Family... I, Li Jiman, will never coexist with you!"

He stood up, glaring at Tian Rong with hatred and cursed, "You brat, you are good at pretending! Tricking me to watch this show must have taken you a lot of effort! I knew it! I knew it!"

Li Jiman was convinced that Tian Rong had received orders from Tian Zhongqing, intentionally luring him here to be seen by Li Yuanping. He drew his sword with a clang and shouted, "Scoundrel! How dare you deceive me!"

Tian Rong looked utterly confused, unable to grasp what had just happened. Li Jiman's expression changed rapidly, restraining the urge to strike. He kicked Tian Rong in the shoulder, sending him flying over some distance, rolling on the ground with a pained cry.

"Get lost!"

Watching Tian Rong flee in panic, Li Jiman's face darkened. Unlike the other Mount Yue lords, he was of Li Family blood and subjected to the Clan Affairs Courtyard's discipline. Even if Li Yuanping did not punish him, it would not be long before someone came to investigate.

Thinking about the trouble ahead, Li Jiman felt a chill in his heart.

"Damn it!"




# Chapter 361: Dispute Between Master and Disciple

Li Yuanping rode his horse forward, feeling the onset of a cough as his excitement waned. The riding uniform he wore was cold and clammy from sweat. Li Ximing, sensing his father's discomfort, asked, "Father, how have you been feeling lately...?"

"Heh."

Li Yuanping did not answer. His face remained pale as he rode up to the carriage with the black flags fluttering above it. He dismounted, handing the reins to Dou Yi, who quickly took them. Li Yuanping then said, "Take this horse to... to Xicheng. It shall be his mount. Starting tomorrow, there is no need to prepare a carriage for him anymore."

He bent down and entered the carriage, beginning to remove his attire. Li Ximing, understanding his father's needs, lit the brazier inside. Li Yuanping coughed twice, sat by the fire, and spoke gently, "Sitting high in the hall, the letters from various towns always paint a picture of peace. Riding this horse for these past few months, and seeing things with my own eyes, has finally set my mind at ease. Now that we have observed Li Jiman, Ming'er... what do you think of him?"

Li Ximing's face, illuminated by the fire, turned a bit golden-red. He poked the coals with a stick, recalling his thoughts as he finally replied, "I see him as arrogant and cold-hearted."

"Hmm."

Li Yuanping nodded in agreement, speaking softly, "In your opinion, would it be better for Mount Yue State to fall into the hands of the Tian Family or Li Jiman?"

Li Ximing furrowed his brow slightly and responded, "I think it makes no difference who holds it. It depends on who can give our family more benefits... The land of Mount Yue is vast, and the spirit goods and paddies they send up are too few."

Li Yuanping did not expect such profound insights from a child. He sighed softly and said, "It is not just Mount Yue. As our clan grows, open and hidden struggles within the seven towns have intensified. Clashes between prominent families and branch lines are fierce. If it were not for the Clan Affairs Courtyard and the Jade Court Guards maintaining order, there would be even more disgraceful incidents.

"The clan has existed for five generations... If we count from the day our forefather returned to establish it, it has been nearly a century. Achieving success is indeed easy, but maintaining a household is difficult."

As father and son conversed in the carriage, the lead spirit horse snorted and stopped. Outside, Dou Yi called out, "Family Head, we have reached the town."

Li Yuanping led his eldest son out of the carriage. Dou Yi approached and whispered, "Family Head, Chen Donghe and the others are already waiting in the hall."

Li Yuanping hummed in acknowledgement as he walked into the hall. Despite being only an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator, the Qi Cultivators inside stood up from their seats respectfully.

Li Yuanping took the main seat and first looked at Chen Donghe, asking politely, "Uncle, what is the situation?"

Chen Donghe, now in his fifties at the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, cupped his fist and replied gently, "I have prepared my luggage and am ready to head west with Jingtian."

Li Yuanping nodded in understanding as he reached over and picked up a storage pouch from the desk. He walked down the steps and handed it to Chen Donghe. He then said solemnly, "These are the talismans and Spirit Stones prepared by the family. The town has also arranged two Unrefined Qi Cultivators from Mount Yue to assist with minor tasks... Please take care, Uncle!"

Chen Donghe and his wife had always intended to travel. Officially, they were said to be adventuring, but in reality, they were heading west to the deserts of the Golden Feather Sect to collect Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi.

This was a secret mission. Hearing that Li Yuanping had arranged for two Mount Yue cultivators to accompany him, Chen Donghe looked up in surprise. Li Yuanping smiled and said, "Do not worry, Uncle. These two are heavily bound by ties and have sworn a spiritual oath. They can be trusted."

Mount Yue's cultivation methods were simple and archaic, aligning with the bloodlines of its various tribes. They were easy to practice but not effective for achieving significant power. Over the years, only five unrefined cultivators emerged, mainly tending to spirit plants which were of limited use.

To collect the Golden Yang Radiant Origin by oneself would take at least twenty years. Chen Donghe naturally understood Li Yuanping's intention as he nodded in understanding and expressed his thanks. Given the presence of outsiders, he did not say much more. He simply accepted the silk pouch and took his leave.

After Chen Donghe left, Li Xicheng stepped forward and respectfully reported, "Family Head, over the past five years, Eastern Mount Yue has paid its tribute: 2,100 jin of spirit paddies, 200 White Essence Fruit, 200 jin of Yellow Jade Spirit Rice, and eleven types of various other spirit items."

He paused before continuing, "The total value is seventy Spirit Stones! They have already been sent down the mountain."

"Good." Li Yuanping nodded in approval. The Azure Pond Sect barely managed the small households in the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation realms, only collecting a small tribute to establish a hierarchy, but the taxes on clans were steep.

As a clan, the Li Family had to pay a tribute every five years, a significant amount of 10,000 jin of Spirit Paddies, equivalent to a hundred Spirit Stones; 500 White Essence Fruit and 500 jin of Yellow Jade Spirit Rice, also worth a hundred Spirit Stones; and an assortment of other spirit items totaling thirty Spirit Stones."

Currently, the Li Family could only produce less than half of this amount. The remaining hundred-plus Spirit Stones were a constant source of worry for Li Yuanping.

In previous years, they supplemented this deficit through the Cloud Crowned Peak market, issuing tasks for external and family cultivators to collect herbs and hunt beasts. Combined with the talismans drawn by Li Xuanxuan and others, they could barely generate forty to fifty Spirit Stones.

Additionally, they relied on the Ebony Mine on their territory, which, through full exploitation, could yield another forty to fifty Spirit Stones over five years. The rest was covered by Li Yuanping's frugal management.

"Furthermore, we must provide resources for the family cultivators," Li Yuanping muttered, troubled by the modest revenue from Mount Yue as reported by Li Xicheng.

He moved his cup on the desk and mumbled, "Mount Wutu still lacks a large formation and it is truly impoverished... such annual deficits are unsustainable."

Li Xicheng stood respectfully before him. Seeing that his earlier report had been fairly smooth without any signs of awkwardness, Li Yuanping could not help but ask, "What is the situation in Mount Yue?"

Caught off guard, Li Xicheng hesitated for several moments before nervously replying, "The Tian Family holds power... Prince Li Jiman is brave..."

"Enough," Li Yuanping interrupted, noting that Li Xicheng did not assertively say "The Tian Family rules" or "The Tian Family controls the politics." He had completely lost interest in hearing more and kindly dismissed him.

"Go and cultivate."

"Yes!" Li Xicheng cupped his fist and left.

Li Yuanping sighed deeply, turning to look at Li Ximing, who was diligently studying nearby. He softly remarked, "Xicheng is honest and straightforward, kind and generous... In the future, if you manage the family, you can employ your Xicheng, but he cannot be given sole responsibility."

Li Ximing was quite fond of his elder brother Li Xicheng, so he was at a loss for how to respond, simply burying his head in his book. Fortunately, someone came forward and reported, "Family Head, there is news from the Yuan Family."

"Oh?"

Li Yuanping immediately looked up. The person continued, "Immortal Master Yuan Tuan has reached Mushroom Forest Plain and will arrive at Moongaze Lake on the full moon day of the eleventh lunar month."

"Good!" Li Yuanping said as he clapped his hands together, instantly delighted. It was now the third day of the eleventh month, meaning Yuan Tuan would arrive in twelve days. He smiled and said, "Send someone to reply that our family eagerly awaits the Immortal Master's visit."

The rain in Linghai Prefecture was continuous. Located in the south of Yue State, it was surrounded by mountains, humid and stifling. Rainwater gathered in the valleys, often flooding the low-lying areas.

A young man trudged through the water in the dense rainforest, annoyed by the constant croaking of frogs. He frowned and grumbled, "Master, why are we circling back to this godforsaken place?"

"Who knows what madness has taken over the Azure Pond Sect..."

The man behind him, with wild hair and a fierce look, walked on a black mist and spoke in a hoarse voice, "They did not send even one related Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator... We have to first cross Linghai Prefecture and then head to Yi Mountain City at the southern border! This body is already useless. If I had not practiced Blood Drinker, suppressing this body, it would have long turned into a puddle of pus from Metallic Essence erosion..."

The young man squinted his eyes and said ambiguously, "But Master, are you not searching for some special Dao foundations? If you forcefully enter Yi Mountain City, you may never return and have to keep heading south. If you reach the depths of the southern border, where will you find a body for your soul transfer..?"

This young man was none other than Jiang Yan, who had been missing for many years. Many cultivators were causing trouble all over Yue State under his name while he had secretly returned to Linghai Prefecture.

A trace of suspicion flashed in Jiang Yan's eyes as he asked this question tentatively. Jiang Boqing, however, waved it off nonchalantly and replied, "Your Master, a genius who reached the Foundation Establishment Realm at thirty and Purple Mansion Realm at sixty, will figure something out when the time comes!"

Jiang Yan shook his head and laughed, then responded simply, "Since Master claims to be a genius who achieved Foundation Establishment Realm at thirty and Purple Mansion Realm at sixty, why did you abandon the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao and switch to practicing curses and strange scriptures?"

"Damn it..." the rough man groaned, his wrinkles deepening with his changing expression.

He grumbled, "I was a genius back then, oblivious to the filth between the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao. I never met anyone with the same immortal foundation as mine, always burying myself in cultivation... Later, when I reached the Purple Mansion Realm—Only then did I realize that the Lord of Mount Wu, Duanmu Kui, cultivated the same Dao!"

He controlled the body that was on the brink of collapse, his expression twisted and hideous, barely managing to smile as he continued, "Duanmu Kui is a figure of overwhelming power in his era... How could I ever wait for him to make a move? It scared me so much that I immediately diminished my divine abilities and cut down my Dao foundation, seeking emptiness to create talismans. I lost most of my cultivation in the process, which is how I became like this."

"Oh?" Jiang Yan remained composed and asked, "What does seeking emptiness to create talismans mean?"

Jiang Boqing shook his head, a hint of pride on his face as he explained, "This is a method I obtained from an ancient text. It involves treating one's life divine abilities as talismans, turning one's entire cultivation along with the Dao foundation into an immortal talisman, transitioning from the Golden Core Dao to the Shamanic Talisman Dao..."

A glimmer of hope appeared on his face as he continued warmly, "When I was young, I received the legacy of a predecessor from Moonlight Origin Mansion. This technique was part of it, and it is not easy to master. Only I, who sought the Supreme Shaman's Three Nine Blood Essence that had a close relationship with talismans, managed to succeed!"

"Turning one's entire cultivation into talismans..."

Jiang Yan pondered these words, then suddenly looked back, this time with tears glistening on his face as he asked in a low voice, "Master... are you now turning my cultivation into talismans?"

Jiang Boqing, still babbling on, suddenly froze when he heard this and cursed, "What nonsense are you talking about?!"

Jiang Yan, however, became more certain. His tears gradually stopped as he stared into Jiang Boqing's eyes and said coldly, "Although I do not cultivate the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, I understand that this path cannot be easily switched. Turning a core into a talisman is already the limit, how can one so casually seize metallic essences?!"

His eyes glinted as he continued coldly, "If my guess is correct, Master, your metallic essence was already heavily damaged... Now that it has disintegrated, there is no more opportunity for you to seize any Dao foundation and start anew!"

Jiang Boqing sighed loudly as his angry expression gradually calmed, turning into a look of appreciation. He said softly, "Indeed, I have no chance of seizing a body..."

Jiang Yan took a step back, seeing that Jiang Boqing was completely unguarded. A bitter smile appeared on his face as he snarled, "It seems you and the Azure Pond Sect are of the same ilk. No wonder... No wonder the Azure Pond Sect, a colossal entity, could not capture even a small cultivator like me after so many years of wandering through the five prefectures."

"So much bloodshed along the way... and every time I broke through a stronghold of the Azure Pond Sect, materials suitable for breakthroughs always appeared... Those resentment qi and blood qi collected dozens upon dozens of years always ended up in my hands one gourd after another."

His pupils dilated, and his fists were clenched so tightly they nearly bled. He then screamed, "Jiang Boqing! What a self-directed, self-acted play... You and the Azure Pond Sect each got what you wanted... You have really put on such a good show!"

"You were never trying to seize some special immortal foundation... It was just a comforting lie for me! The Three Nine True Talisman in my qihai acupoint, the Shamanic Blood Talisman in my Shenyang Mansion, those were what you plotted for!"

His venomous voice echoed through the mountains, silencing Jiang Boqing. Flesh fell from Jiang Boqing's face in shreds. After a few moments, Jiang Boqing spoke.

"I was indeed close with Buzi, and the devil plague was indeed a trade of interests between the Azure Pond Sect and myself... That is why the resentment qi and blood qi were sent to you one after another. You are a smart child, and you guessed all of these correctly."

He paused, shaking his head slightly as he continued, "But my metallic essence is damaged beyond repair. No talisman or seal can save it. The two shamanic talismans on you are something I nurtured myself... They are exceptionally miraculous, but they are not meant for body seizing."

Jiang Boqing's body was covered in blood, yet his gaze remained gentle. He said softly, "Occupying this body is merely to protect you. Without special elixirs or matching techniques, it will eventually perish along with this body. I thought I could hide it from you until I sent you out of the southern border..."

Jiang Yan remained unmoved, taking another step back with a wary expression, his voice ice cold as he replied, "You say it is not... and I should believe you just like that? How can I trust you!"

Jiang Boqing frowned at him, suddenly startled. He then shouted loudly, "Hey!"

His lips and teeth came together, releasing a thunderous shout that made Jiang Yan's head buzz. Jiang Boqing's expression changed drastically as he cursed, "Damn it, it is a divine ability!"

Jiang Yan's eyes cleared up, and he was taken aback. Jiang Boqing quickly grabbed him, lifted off into the air, and shouted, "We must leave quickly! If he is using a divine ability to block us, he must be close!"

"A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator?"

Jiang Yan's hair stood on end as he pushed his mana to fly, asking, "Are you not in cahoots with the Azure Pond Sect? Why would they send a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator after you!"

"Probably an old enemy of mine!"

Jiang Boqing's rough, wild-haired body cursed loudly, calculating in his mind, "How is this possible?! Who could have predicted this?!"

They had only flown for a moment when the biting wind in the sky suddenly ceased. The wind formed from their mana stopped flowing, and streams of black light appeared in the void before them, bursting with the colorful brilliance of a Purple Mansion Realm's divine ability.

"Senior Jiang," a young man said as he leisurely stepped out from within the void. He wore a simple Daoist robe, his features delicate and refined, holding an unremarkable grayish pearl in his hand.

"To think that this day finally came for you..."

"Qing Jifang..." Jiang Boqing muttered as he stared at the young man, clearly surprised by his appearance and unsure of his intentions. He asked in a low voice, "What do you want?"

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's robe fluttered as he turned the pearl in his hand gently, calmly looking at Jiang Boqing. "Senior, no need to be tense... I have many questions to ask you. Perhaps about the Answers to a Beggar's Questions Under the Mulberry Tree, or about Sword Immortal Shangyuan, Xiao Chuting, Tang Yuanwu... What are you plotting? Who has the immortal book now? Everyone from Mount Changhuai is very curious... Please come with me to Wu State, Senior."




# Chapter 363: Yuan Tuan Arrives

The young Daoist had just spoken when the dharma pearl in his hand rotated once, emitting a layer of hazy gray light. It was like the clouds and mist, continuously rising.

Before the two could make any move, the gray mist had already spread, enveloping them and preventing others from peeping with their divine abilities.

"Oh?"

Jiang Boqing's gaze lingered on the gray light surrounding them for a moment before he said softly, "I do not know anything about Answers to a Beggar's Questions Under the Mulberry Tree... I am only familiar with Buzi from the Azure Pond Sect. As for Xiao Chuting, he is just a somewhat skilled junior whom I have never met, so how would I know anything about him?!"

"Mount Changhuai... it is one thing if you are plotting for the immortal book, but do not go thinking I am an easy target just because I am in a tight spot!" Jiang Boqing spat as he glared at the man with his bloodshot eyes, his face contorted in anger.

"A broken ship still has three jin of nails. When I, Jiang Boqing, was at my peak, you were just a minor Daoist in Wu's jurisdiction. Are you not afraid that I will bite back, at least ending your cultivation path?" he snarled coldly.

"Senior, you must be joking..." Qing Jifang smiled slightly. With this artifact for protection, he was not afraid of being detected by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of Yue State, and he said leisurely, "You claim you do not know Xiao Chuting, but you and the Azure Pond Sect orchestrated this massacre in Lixia Prefecture. To say you have no connection with Xiao Chuting... I simply cannot believe it."

At these words, Jiang Boqing's expression changed dramatically, and Jiang Yan beside him was stunned, lifting his head in disbelief. Jiang Boqing, under Jiang Yan's piercing gaze, forced himself to remain calm and replied, "That was Xiao Chuting and the Azure Pond Sect's scheme. I was just exploiting the situation..."

Qing Jifang, having cultivated to the Purple Mansion Realm, was naturally observant. He immediately sensed the fluctuation in Jiang Boqing's emotions and realized something. He then turned and looked at Jiang Yan behind him as he said softly, "Young man, this person used divine ability to entice your father, bringing calamity and killing your mother, refining you as a talisman... and yet you still call him master. How absurd is that?"

Seeing his pretentiousness, Jiang Boqing instead calmed down and said solemnly, "What is the meaning of this, fellow Daoist?"

Seeing Jiang Yan remain silent, Qing Jifang finally turned his gaze to Jiang Boqing and said softly, "I will not quibble with senior. Answers to a Beggar's Questions Under the Mulberry Tree is an immortal book. Besides Duanmu Kui, no one in Jiangnan knows it better than you, Senior... Now that Mount Wu has fallen, everyone's eyes are on you. Not just my Wu State, but even two of the three True Monarchs of Yue State are watching you. Where do you think you can escape to?"

Qing Jifang's voice echoed in the air, and Jiang Boqing's face was covered in blood as they dripped down silently. Qing Jifang's words shattered Jiang Boqing's self-deceptive dream, causing his expression to turn darker.

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator then shifted his gaze to Jiang Yan and said solemnly, "The father as the yang, the Three Nine True Talisman; the mother's death as yin, the Shamanic Blood Talisman... An excellent body indeed. If Senior is willing to come with me to Wu State, I can spare his life and give you a chance."

"We will just ask about the situation in Yue State, only seeking fragments of the immortal book from your memory. Once done, you can reincarnate." Qing Jifang smiled and continued warmly, "Wu State will have its clues, and Senior will have lost your memory... it is without value anyway, and you will no longer be watched by the True Monarchs. With this excellent body, you can start over and roam the world... is that not wonderful?"

Jiang Boqing stared at him coldly and replied, "I have already obtained a wisp of metallic essence... There is no need to use such divine abilities to confuse me."

Qing Jifang's expression remained unchanged as he smiled and quipped, "It seems I was showing off my skills before an expert, but this offer is sincerely made and still stands."

Jiang Boqing hesitated for a moment, then finally answered, his voice low, "Fine, but first, send my excellent body away."

Qing Jifang was immediately overjoyed and replied, "Senior is courageous... Jifang will never break his promise!"

With that, he drew out a ray of colorful light, lightly capturing Jiang Yan. Jiang Yan, only able to resist the power of a Foundation Establishment Realm with Jiang Boqing's help, was easily captured by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.

"Wait, I will do it myself!" Jiang Boqing interrupted loudly.

Qing Jifang suddenly realized Jiang Boqing's sincerity even more, nodding in agreement, "Indeed... indeed, it is better that I do not handle this myself."

At this moment, a slit appeared in the gray mist, allowing Jiang Boqing to send Jiang Yan away. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could roam the void, and though not instantly covering thousands of li, a hundred li was still achievable. With Jiang Boqing's metallic essence, he could send Jiang Yan a thousand li away, completely erasing his trail.

Jiang Boqing grabbed the colorful light, activated the metallic essence, and unceremoniously seized control from Qing Jifang, causing the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist's eyelids to twitch.

Jiang Yan, unable to speak, stared at him quietly. Jiang Boqing extended his hand to open a path of black light, sending Jiang Yan away, then turned back with a broad smile to Qing Jifang.

"Senior?" Qing Jifang watched him warily.

Jiang Boqing simply glanced at him, saying softly, "Mount Changhuai has shamanic Dao lineages. If one could obtain Answers to a Beggar's Questions Under the Mulberry Tree, a True Monarch would surely reach a higher level."

"And so what?" Qing Jifang asked as he began to sense that something was amiss. The pearl in his hand floated up and down.

Jiang Boqing laughed and said, "Why don't you guess whether Pristine Water prefers the immortal book to be lost within Yue State's borders or for the clues to be controlled by your state, subjected to external manipulation?"

"Oh no... Have you lost your mind?!"

Seeing Jiang Boqing's body explode into fragments, turning into a shower of flesh and blood, Qing Jifang was momentarily shocked. He hastily stowed the pearl and was about to make an attempt to escape into the void.

Clang—

From the shattered body emerged a wisp of golden light, seemingly with eyes, which rushed toward the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator with great speed. In an instant, the light blazed brightly, causing thousands of frogs to croak in unison and rivers to surge.

Qing Jifang was filled with disbelief as the golden light collided with his body, the void around them sealed by the metallic essence. He could only manage to let out a final cry, "You are throwing your life away!"

𝗳𝚛𝚎𝚎𝘄𝕖𝕓𝕟𝕠𝚟𝚎𝕝.𝗰𝕠𝐦

In the eleventh lunar month...

The snow on Mount Wutu was thick and white, covering the stone table with snowflakes, and the rocks in the courtyard were also blanketed in white. A young man in fine clothes and a white fur coat reclined on a redwood chair, silently holding a jade cup between two fingers.

"Zhi'er."

A woman with thin eyebrows and phoenix eyes, dressed in red, spoke warmly, her expression showing signs of fatigue.

"Have you packed?"

"Yes..." Li Xizhi responded softly, adding, "What about Father?"

"Your father has gone to Lijing Town. The Immortal Master is coming, and there are many things to prepare. A carriage will come to fetch you soon," Xiao Guiluan explained softly, observing her son's disappointment.

She attempted to comfort Li Xizhi, but the boy's expression did not change. He focused his gaze on the cup in his hand, speaking in a low voice, "Qingsui Peak is sparsely populated, with only an empty reputation. As the senior brother of the peak, I am afraid there will be endless troubles in the future."

While his words explained his worries, his heart was filled with bitterness which he did not dare to share with his mother.

Hearing that Yuan Tuan was coming, Li Yuanjiao finally showed his eldest son the clan's internal records. Li Xizhi read the book all night, his expression changing several times.

The entanglements between Chi Wei, Chi Zhiyun, and Yuanwu Peak and Li Chejing's tragic end, filled his heart with anguish, leaving him silent and troubled as he thought to himself, So many entanglements within the sect... With this reputation, I am afraid I will become a pawn in their struggles.

He silently gripped the sword at his waist, set down the jade cup, and responded, "Once I join the sect, I will do my utmost."

As Li Xizhi pondered, someone arrived from below. This person wore simple clothes and had some snowflakes on his shoulders, and he appeared to be in a hurry.

He hastily brushed the snow off his body, first bowed to Xiao Guiluan at the top, then called out loudly, "Brother Zhi!"

Li Xizhi quickly stood up and walked over to greet him, asking, "Brother Cheng, what brings you here?"

Li Xicheng, covered in dust and wearing thin clothes without any accessories, cheerfully took out a jade pendant from his chest pocket and smiled. "I heard you are about to join the sect, so I found something good for you!"

He had not received the talisman seed and was oblivious to many family secrets. He only saw joining the Azure Pond Sect as an immensely beneficial thing and proudly presented the jade pendant, which glowed with a green light. He placed it in Li Xizhi's hand while explaining with a smile, "This is an Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifact, capable of condensing spiritual qi. Consider it a gift from your elder brother!"

Li Xizhi was momentarily stunned. His father was Li Yuanjiao, and his grandfather was Li Xuanxuan, the leaders of the Li Family for generations. He lacked for nothing of such trinkets, but seeing Li Xicheng's joyous expression filled him with mixed feelings.

Li Xicheng's father had no spiritual orifice, and his grandfather had died early, making their lives much harder. This jade pendant was a precious item to his elder brother, who forced it into Li Xizhi's hand.

Looking at his brother's simple attire without any mana light, yet still looking at him warmly, Li Xizhi held the jade pendant tightly as strong emotions surged in his heart. Feeling as if it were a burning coal and not knowing what to say, he stammered, "Brother Cheng... you shouldn't have!"

Li Xicheng, who had spent the past few months overseeing Spirit Paddies in the mountains, had gained some experience and spoke more confidently. He laughed and said, "Your elder brother now holds a position in the clan and receives stipends. Do not refuse my gift!"

His tone was warm, but Li Xizhi felt even more conflicted. He grabbed his brother's hand, having long wanted to speak with him, and said softly, "I heard that your expenses are tight, and your pockets are empty. The family's resources and your stipends are half given away and half lent to the clan brothers... Is that true?"

"Well..." Li Xicheng hesitated, stammering, "I'm just helping out the brothers... The clan has been going through tough times lately, and everyone is struggling."

"Oh," Li Xizhi had no idea what to say. He embraced his elder brother firmly in his broad chest as he jokingly reminded him, "You should be more frugal. Be careful, or the clan chief might accuse you of being a spendthrift and a big spender!"

Li Xicheng chuckled softly, but Li Xizhi wasn't sure if he heeded the advice. A servant stepped forward and respectfully informed, "Young master, the carriage has arrived."

Upon hearing this, Li Xizhi nodded slightly. He looked at Li Xicheng's beaming smile, and all his previous frustration vanished, now replaced by determination and anticipation.

————

Lijing Town.

Li Yuanjiao, clad in black, stood silently in the snow, his sword by his side. Snowflakes fell on him, only to slide off shortly after. Li Xizhi stood beside him, gazing absentmindedly at the horizon.

The Li Family members waited for a moment. Amidst the swirling snow, a Daoist in green robes arrived riding a deer. The woman appeared to be in her thirties, radiating an extraordinary aura.

The deer beneath her had pure white fur and was adorned with spots of green, and moved with grace and agility. Its eyes were lively. The woman on the deer wore fluttering robes, giving her a celestial appearance. Around her waist, a long ribbon was tied, fluttering constantly in the wind.

The ribbon had intricate patterns, light and transparent, clearly a fine dharma artifact.

"Members of the Li Family greet the Peak Master!"

The Li Family members greeted her respectfully as Yuan Tuan smiled and nodded. As soon as the white deer touched the ground and kicked its four hooves, it turned into a patch of white snow and disappeared.

This miraculous display left the Li Family and their guests in silent awe. Yuan Tuan responded, "No need for formalities."

Yuan Tuan, who was around the same age as Li Tongya, had reached the Qi Cultivation Realm at eighteen, even faster than his senior brother, Xiao Yuansi. However, for reasons unknown, after achieving the Qi Cultivation Realm, she focused on talismans and spirit plants, causing the progress of her cultivation to suffer.

At that time, their master, Si Yuanbai, was imprisoned, and her senior and junior brothers were all in the southern border. Yuan Tuan had to support Qingsui Peak alone, enduring much hardship. Fortunately, in the past decade, she made several breakthroughs and achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm. Life improved significantly for her since then.

"Please come inside, Immortal Master..." Li Yuanjiao said politely.

Yuan Tuan nodded gently and walked gracefully across the snow. The guest cultivators and other family members withdrew, leaving only a few direct descendants to accompany Yuan Tuan inside.

Her gaze lingered on the sword at Li Yuanjiao's waist for a moment, then she turned her head slightly, feeling somewhat uncomfortable.

"Is that the Qingche Sword..?" she asked softly.

"Indeed!"

Li Yuanjiao had replaced the sword at his waist, the Dragon Coiling Pillar, with the Qingche Sword. He removed its covering, proudly displaying it instead of hiding it like he usually did.

"This sword..."

Yuan Tuan's expression turned complex, and she said in a low voice, "I accompanied my master to acquire this sword for him. At the time, our peak was struggling, and we could only afford a peak Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifact. Yet, Jing'er was overjoyed and thanked us profusely... Who would have thought that this sword, after slaying demons and absorbing sword intent, silently advanced and became a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact."

The Li Family members listened silently. Yuan Tuan raised her eyebrows, glanced at Li Yuanjiao, and asked, "Since you wearing this sword at your waist... you must be the head of the Li Family?"

Li Yuanjiao had rehearsed his response many times. He answered respectfully, "Lord Chejing had no descendants. I, a junior of the Yuan generation named Jiao, am considered his successor and thus wear this sword."

"No descendants, huh..."

Yuan Tuan barely maintained her expression, standing in place for two full breaths before following Li Yuanjiao's lead to the seat of honor. She silently scanned the faces of the crowd, and then asked warmly, "Why do I not see Daoist Tongya?"

Li Yuanjiao lowered his head slightly and said in a deep voice, "The ancestor is in seclusion and has yet to emerge."

"Oh..." Yuan Tuan nodded, then saw Li Yuanjiao signal with his eyes.

Li Xizhi stepped forward and said respectfully, "Junior Li Xizhi greets Senior!"

"Good!"

Yuan Tuan finally showed a hint of a smile. She scanned him with her spiritual sense, observing for a while, carefully examining his Qihai, Shenyang Mansion, and Juque Court acupoints, and then closed her eyes without saying a word.

This sight made everyone in the hall silently tense up. Li Xizhi forced himself to stay calm, feeling the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed in his Qihai acupoint, his heart pounding.

After more than ten breaths, Yuan Tuan finally opened her eyes and nodded.

"Not bad, you should join my Qingsui Peak!"

She then smiled brightly at Li Xizhi and said, "Good child, there is no need to be nervous."

With these words, everyone finally relaxed and felt relieved. Li Xizhi respectfully thanked her as Yuan Tuan looked at him with a smile and said softly, "Raise your head!"

Li Xizhi's face, similar to Li Yuanjiao's, showed a gentle and peaceful demeanor when he lowered his eyes. But when he raised his head, his ambitious look appeared, making Yuan Tuan smile lightly and say, "Your appearance does resemble your father... You have quite a fierce look and the potential to lead. It seems I have indeed picked up a treasure."

"Senior is too kind to my son..." Li Yuanjiao responded quietly and said, "Being able to join Qingsui Peak is a blessing for the Li Family."

"Yes..." Yuan Tuan nodded, then asked, "I heard your family has a young alchemist. Is he here?"




# Chapter 365: Azure Manifestation

Yuan Tuan had just finished speaking when Li Ximing stepped forward, drawing everyone's attention. He wore loose white robes and appeared quite dignified though his voice still sounded somewhat immature.

"Junior Li Ximing greets Senior!"

Yuan Tuan looked at him carefully, the long ribbon at her waist gently fluttering. She smiled and said, "I heard from my senior brother that there is an alchemist with a harmonious aura, blending together both water and fire. Now that I see you, you are indeed a fine seedling!"

With that, she took Li Ximing's hand and asked warmly, "Do you have a suitable alchemy furnace, Ming'er?"

Li Ximing was slightly taken aback and looked at Li Yuanjiao, who gave a slight nod before he replied, "Yes, Senior! I already have one!"

The Li Family's alchemy furnace had been taken by Li Tongya from someone else when the market fell many years ago, and it was at the Qi Cultivation Realm. At that time, the Li Family was still weak, and Li Tongya feared that possessing such a treasure would bring trouble, hence it had been sealed away for many years.

Now that the Li Family's foundation was stable and they had an alchemist, the furnace finally saw the light of day, though its presence was known only to a few direct descendants.

Upon hearing this, Yuan Tuan paused as she rubbed her storage pouch at her waist, sensing the alchemy furnace inside. She could not help but laugh bitterly to herself.

This is awkward. I have owed Yundan Peak a favor for nothing...

The Li Family had only been established for less than a hundred years, so Yuan Tuan did not expect them to have an alchemy furnace ready. She thought for a moment, then took off a jade bead from her wrist which was tied with a red string, and put it around Li Ximing's wrist. She then smiled warmly.

"Consider this my gift to you, Ming'er!"

Li Yuanjiao noticed the brilliant radiance of the jade bead and knew instantly that it was no ordinary item. He was delighted but quickly said modestly, "Peak Master! How can we accept this?!"

Yuan Tuan laughed, looking at Li Ximing's serious little face, liking him more and more. She then explained, "This item was my protective treasure during my years as a Qi Cultivator, and it is called Azure Manifestation. It has been tempered by my cultivation method for many years and possesses some spiritual abilities. It can transform into an eagle, dog, tiger, or deer, making it an excellent dharma artifact for those at the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realms.

"Now that I have achieved the immortal foundation, Azure Crest Manifestation, and nurtured it for two years, it has become even more miraculous, almost a Foundation Establishment Realm artifact... The abilities of Azure Crest Manifestation overlap with this item, so I no longer need it and so I will give it to Ming'er!"

Li Yuanjiao could tell that Yuan Tuan had originally intended to give an alchemy furnace as a favor, but now that she had given the jade bead instead, it must be of equal value. Alchemy furnaces were rare and priceless, and this jade bead being comparable was extraordinary. He immediately said, "Quickly thank the Immortal Master!"

"Thank you, Senior!" Li Ximing replied earnestly.

Yuan Tuan nodded before extending her delicate hand, and released a faint white light that enveloped them, isolating them from the outside. She then asked seriously, "Are you aware of the chaos caused by the devil plague?"

Li Yuanjiao immediately became alert, and Li Yuanping, Li Xicheng, along with the others also pricked up their ears in attention. Li Yuanjiao replied, "Our family is located in northern Yue and has heard some news... It is said that Jiang Yan committed all kinds of evil, spreading the devil Dao lineage everywhere. These teachings have even spread among rogue cultivators and commoners, causing widespread chaos, especially in the south, which suffered greatly..."

"Correct." Yuan Tuan nodded and continued in a low voice, "Although Jiang Yan opposed our sect, he practiced the shamanic dao, not the devil dao as rumored. Moreover, he has been missing for many years... The devil plague must have another cause."

Li Yuanjiao frowned slightly and replied, "Senior, you mean to say that... the devil plague in Yue State is caused by someone who deliberately spread the devil Dao lineage...? Is anyone in the sect going to suppress and resolve it?"

Yuan Tuan's expression was difficult to read as she said softly, "No, but there are concerns among the peaks. We fear that if the devil plague is left unchecked, it will eventually lead to a tragedy like that of Pingming Ford."

The great battle between the immortals and devils took place at Pingming Ford, causing heaven and earth to collapse, mountains and rivers to submerge, and the divine continent to sink. This led to the immortal cultivators abandoning the north, the invasion of the Jie people, and the widespread influence of Buddhism, resulting in the current situation.

Li Yuanjiao nodded silently, understanding the gravity of the situation. Yuan Tuan then advised, "In recent years, we have repeatedly found traces of devil cultivators in the Mushroom Forest Plain, and we have even lost two Qi Cultivation Realm disciples. It seems the situation is worsening and moving north... Please keep an eye on this."

"Thank you for the reminder, Senior!"

Seeing Li Yuanjiao's respectful response and knowing he took this matter to heart, Yuan Tuan's delicate fingers emitted a trace of azure light. As soon as it touched the ground, it transformed into two white deer, blinking their eyes and standing still.

Yuan Tuan then said softly, "Good disciple, follow me back to the peak!"

Li Xizhi hurriedly bade farewell to his parents and brothers, then mounted the white deer and soared into the clouds.

Yuan Tuan gracefully mounted on the back of the deer as well and said softly, "If you wish to send a letter to the sect, send it to the Yuan Family. The favor of the predecessors will eventually fade, so work hard on your cultivation."

Her voice lingered in the air as the two white deer stepped on the clouds and disappeared without a trace. The remaining people looked up, and Li Yuanping finally spoke, "Azure Crest Manifestation truly has the demeanor of an immortal... I wonder which lineage it belongs to!"

The two exchanged glances, both pleased with the smooth proceedings and the gifts they had received. Li Xijun leaned over to Li Ximing curiously and said, "Brother! Let us see your fine dharma artifact!"

Li Ximing nodded eagerly, having been excited for a while but trying to maintain the family's dignity without showing joy in front of Yuan Tuan. His eyes sparkled as he activated his mana and the jade bead glowed slightly, then emitted a stream of azure light that drifted to the ground.

The azure light transformed into a white deer, about the size of a cat, looking very lively and blinking at the people. Li Xijun laughed, flipped onto the deer's back, and attempted to ride it.

The spirit deer, however, would not comply, darting left and right actively and trying to hide behind Li Ximing. Li Xijun laughed, grabbing its antlers and playfully wrestling with the spirit deer while Li Ximing held the bead and grinned.

"First stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm..." Li Yuanjiao muttered as he scanned the spirit deer with his spiritual sense, still dressed completely in black.

Li Yuanping nodded and replied, "It should be related to the cultivation level of the bead holder."

"Ming'er!" Li Yuanping called out, and Li Ximing hurriedly brought the dharma bead over, reluctantly handing it to Li Yuanjiao.

Li Yuanjiao took the dharma artifact, Azure Manifestation, and channeled his mana into it. After a few moments, he remarked, "It has some spirituality... it has already recognized its master."

He then handed the jade bead back to Li Ximing. Li Ximing, whose eyes had been glued to the bead, was overjoyed at this and tied it back onto his wrist.

After sending off the children among the generation of Xi and Yue, several clan guards entered the hall for the night watch. The two men sat down at a small table, and Li Yuanping said in a low voice, "The devil plague is approaching. I reviewed the clan's situation recently and wanted to discuss it with you, Big Brother."

"All right," Li Yuanjiao replied.

Li Yuanping began, "There are currently six Qi Cultivators in the clan. Big Brother is at the sixth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm, Big Sister at the fifth heavenly layer, Uncle Donghe is currently away from home, Father is at the third heavenly layer, Sister-In-Law Guiluan and my mother are at the first heavenly layer."

"Besides the main lineage, there's also a Qi Cultivator in the branch lineage named Li Wen, who has just broken through. He's from the Jade Court Guards, specializing in protective duties." He paused, then called out to the clan guard, "Summon the battalion commander."

The person acknowledged his command and retreated while Li Yuanping continued, "External cultivators Tian Youdao, Tian Zhongqing, and Xu Gongming are all at the first heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm, and guest cultivator An Zheyan is at the seventh heavenly layer. As for Unrefined Qi Cultivators similar to Li Qiuyang, there are seven to eight of them, mainly from Mount Yue. Facing a Qi Cultivation Realm devil cultivator would be a death sentence for them..."

After hearing this, Li Yuanjiao said in a deep voice, "Excluding our uncle and father who are not at home, there are six early-stage Qi Cultivators, two mid-stage, and one late-stage."

"Correct," Li Yuanping confirmed with a nod.

Just then, a robust, tall man with a rough face and strong build entered, kneeling powerfully with an aura that could push down golden mountains and jade pillars.

"Court Guard Li Wen greets Family Head and Clan Uncle!"

The treatment for Jade Court Guards was equivalent to that of a battalion commander, so Li Wen had sufficient resources for his cultivation. He had also been practicing the rapid cultivation method, Guardian of the Courtly Path, and was now just over thirty.

Li Yuanping quickly called him to rise and explained to his elder brother, "This man has been in seclusion and breaking through in recent years, so he may seem unfamiliar to you, Big Brother."

Li Yuanjiao nodded and asked, "Which branch are you from?"

Li Wen replied, "My great-grandfather was the younger brother of Li Mutian, the youngest son of Li Genshui, and the elder of the four branches..."

Seeing this sturdy man's face full of pride and chanting this lineage fluently, Li Yuanjiao found it both amusing but headache-inducing, and quickly interrupted, "I understand, so you are from the youngest son of Ancestor Genshui's line."

Li Wen nodded proudly, the fluent recitation indicating he often spoke of it. Li Yuanjiao took out a bottle of pills from his storage pouch and placed it into Li Wen's hand, saying lightly, "Consider this a greeting gift from your clan uncle."

"Thank you, Clan Uncle!" Li Wen bowed again and murmured his thanks before retreating.

"He seems honest," Li Yuanjiao remarked, watching his retreating figure.

Li Yuanping, his face pale, nodded and hinted, "The branch lineage has many people, but their talent is lacking. Among so many, only he has emerged, and even among the Unrefined Qi Cultivators... there is only Uncle Qiuyang."

"Indeed..." Li Yuanjiao nodded, placing the jade cup on the table. "It does seem too few, which might raise suspicions," he commented with a sigh.

After all, the main lineage of the Li Family consistently produced children with spiritual orifices, each generation more talented than the last. Although the two main branches had many descendants, including many mortals, somewhat balancing the high ratio, the branch lineage had been too lackluster, producing no notable talents for many years. Such a thing could arouse suspicion among those with ulterior motives.

"What is your suggestion, Brother Ping?" Li Yuanjiao asked earnestly.

Li Yuanping had already made his plans but still looked to his elder brother, Li Yuanjiao, for confirmation. Hearing the question, Li Yuanping nodded slowly and answered, "We approach it from two angles. For the branch lineage, reduce their households under charges and encourage cultivators to marry into the main lineage, changing their surnames. For the main lineage, expand the branches and increase the population... I have been working on these matters for the past few years."

Li Yuanping paused, his expression somewhat grim as he explained, "After all, abolishing the ancestral temple is a significant matter. It strikes a painful blow to the branch lineage. Changing the surname from Li to Ye and expelling them is extremely painful for the branch lineage, comparable only to death... This needs to be done gradually."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, staring into Li Yuanping's eyes as he said softly, "I have a good method."

"I would like to hear the details!" Li Yuanping chipped as he looked up.

Seeing this, Li Yuanjiao began, "Nowadays, there are more and more wastrels and ruffians among the branch lineage. Although the Clan Affairs Courtyard has many cultivators, they cannot spend all their cultivation time managing the clan members, and they are gradually becoming overwhelmed. Several fools are even being played around by the prominent families."

His voice was low, almost drifting in the air as he continued, "Should there be a war, we could mobilize the clan disciples as soldiers and generals according to tradition. This would eliminate the weak and retain the strong, cleansing our family and greatly reducing our burden."

Li Yuanjiao had fought on the battlefield in his youth, beheading many in Mount Yue. At that time, Li Yuanping had not yet been born. By the time he took charge, Li Yuanjiao had already restrained his nature, discussing matters with him day and night without showing any ferocity.

Now, hearing these words, Li Yuanping understood why their father, Li Xuanxuan, always said that Li Yuanjiao had too strong of a killing intent. He silently took a deep breath and asked, "Who would we fight?"

"It does not necessarily have to be a war; it is just an idea," Li Yuanjiao chuckled, his eyes fixed on the letter from Eastern Mount Yue on the table. He then said warmly, "Eastern Mount Yue is now also occupied by the bloated and useless clans. Back then, we needed these clans to restrain Shamoli. Now that the Tian Family has succeeded, keeping them around is just allowing them to embezzle spirit resources and occupy spirit fields."

He sipped some tea and said softly, "First, eliminate the parasites in the clan. Second, deal with the lords of Mount Yue. These matters must be resolved before the devil plague arrives to prevent our family from becoming weak and allowing these parasites to grow unchecked."

————

The Xiao Family, Xianyou Peak.

The cold water in the clear pool rippled slightly, and the spiritual grass on the shore grew crookedly. Xiao Chuting rode a rainbow light out of the void and sat on a rock at the highest peak.

"The Supreme Shaman's Three Nine Blood Essence is truly magnificent."

Xiao Chuting stroked his beard, filled with emotion. The golden light had flashed in the void for over ten breaths, alarming all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the Wu and Yue States. Witnessing the once-in-a-century spectacle of the metallic essence dissipating filled them with awe.

"Qing Jifang is still young and judges others by himself... He really thought these Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, no matter how far they advanced, would always be afraid of death and submit to his Mount Changhuai."

Thinking of Qing Jifang's shocked and terrified face when he was solidly hit by the supreme shaman's metallic essence, Xiao Chuting felt quite pleased.

"Jiang Boqing... Since the fall of Duanmu Kui and the loss of Answers to a Beggar's Questions Under the Mulberry Tree, he knew he did not have much time left... He was just unwilling to die without trying to break through one last time..." Xiao Chuting reflected.

Back then, Jiang Boqing materialized in the void of Lixia Prefecture, his aura comparable to the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm. This terrifying presence had left the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of the Azure Pond Sect paralyzed with fear. They could only watch helplessly as Jiang Boqing manipulated them like puppets, not daring to utter a word.

Looking back at today, he had been surviving under the jurisdiction of Azure Pond Sect for over ten years, forced to damage his own metallic essence in order to seize Dao foundations and flee in all directions. In the end, he had to sacrifice his own life only to severely injure a junior, which was truly lamentable.

"Such bad luck. Just when Duanmu Kui fell, he also met his end, becoming a target for everyone and losing his chance for reincarnation..."

Xiao Chuting took out a white jade fishing rod and placed it on the rock. Just as he was about to use his divine ability to see if there was anything valuable nearby, a warm voice sounded in his ear.

"Welcome back to the mountain, Ancestor. Yuansi is here to pay his respects!"

Xiao Chuting face showed a trace of helplessness. Despite his attempts to avoid him, Xiao Yuansi still found him. In a hoarse voice, he said, "Come up!"

Before long, Xiao Yuansi, dressed in white and emanating a medicinal fragrance, flew up. It seemed he had just finished refining a batch of pills. He landed in front of Xiao Chuting and greeted respectfully, "Yuansi greets the ancestor and congratulates the ancestor on attaining advanced mastery of divine abilities!"

Seeing his overly formal and stiff demeanor, Xiao Chuting could not help but laugh inwardly. He asked, "Are you here because of Li Tongya?"

"Ancestor is perceptive; Yuansi is impressed!" Xiao Yuansi replied as he continued to stand respectfully.

Xiao Chuting had to put down the white jade fishing rod and said gruffly, "I have done my best! Li Tongya's fate is sealed. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators pushed him to that place, which is beyond my power to change anything."

Then he recounted the entire cause and effect of the matter with the Wrathful Maha, finally saying, "I have already tried my best to alter fate. Since Li Tongya's fate cannot be changed, we can only use him to gain more benefits... Our Xiao Family has some ties with his family, but not enough to offend numerous Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and disrupt years of plans for his sake."

Having heard the whole story, Xiao Yuansi could not help but exclaimed, "Why Li Tongya?! Why?!"

Xiao Chuting sneered and said in a low voice, "Perhaps it is because his fate is both fragrant and beautiful, or maybe because of his position at the junction of the north and south...making him convenient to manipulate. Or perhaps he was a resource prepared by the Maha years ago..."

He then paused slightly, as if thinking of something, and a scene from the void on that day flashed in his mind. He silently added in his heart, Perhaps it's not just to lure the Wrathful Maha using Li Tongya... but to test some other existence...

Seeing Xiao Yuansi's silent and thoughtful appearance, Xiao Chuting shook his head and sighed. "It is a pity that idiot Liu Changdie ran from east to west, then from west to south, desperately trying to traverse the entire Yue State, mixing up all the fates, making it impossible to deduce anything accurately. By now, there are already more than a dozen Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan who want to kill him with a single slap. They complain in the east, curse in the west, all barely able to restrain their anger."

Xiao Chuting chuckled as if recalling something amusing, leaving Xiao Yuansi confused. He only heard the name Liu Changdie but did not understand what everything else meant.




# Chapter 367: Guest from Afar

Li Jiman rode to Lijing Town on horseback but returned to Wutu City in a carriage. The Clan Affairs Courtyard's enforcer was an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator. Despite Li Jiman's own cultivation, he was still flogged until his skin was torn and flesh lacerated.

Several unsmiling elders of the Clan Affairs Courtyard deliberated amongst themselves for a while before concluding with a judgment of negligence of duty and indulgence of the prominent families. Not only was Li Jiman flogged seventy times, but his reputation was also thoroughly tarnished.

The Tian Family members naturally rushed to the Clan Affairs Courtyard. Tian Zhongqing stepped forward and repeatedly apologized, and Li Jiman accepted it with a smile, but Tian Zhongqing felt a chill down his spine.

Meanwhile, even though the Clan Affairs Courtyard and Li Yuanping's central hall gave no specific instructions to his family, they still broke out in cold sweat.

As the head of the Tian Family in the eye of the storm, Tian Zhongqing felt a lump in his throat, and the joy of advancing to the Qi Cultivation Realm vanished. He drove back to Eastern Mount Yue overnight, smashing the porcelain in the courtyard in anger. He also had to stop his uncle, Tian Youdao, from slapping Tian Rong to death.

"Get out! You wretch!"

With Tian Youdao's roar, Tian Rong slunk away, clutching his swollen cheek. It was only then did Tian Zhongqing release his uncle's hand. Deep down, he did not want to stop Tian Youdao, thinking it would be better if his uncle could end Tian Rong with one slap...

When the old man's slap only made Tian Rong stagger, Tian Zhongqing knew that his uncle still cared for his only son. After finishing the act, he said in a low voice, "Uncle... what should we do now?"

Tian Youdao, an elder of the Li Family, had progressed from the Embryonic Breathing Realm to the Qi Cultivation Realm and held significant seniority in the clan. He sighed deeply and said glumly, "Li Jiman is a petty man who already held a grudge against our family in the first place. Now that this has happened, it has only deepened his grudge..."

The uncle and nephew were both Qi Cultivators and led the largest external force within the Li Family. They had always been cautious. Who could have imagined that while Tian Zhongqing was in seclusion and Tian Youdao was away, Tian Rong would cause such a disaster?

Tian Zhongqing sighed and said softly, "I clearly gave instructions. How did he manage to run off? Now Li Jiman has the support of many Mount Yue lords... If there are any changes in the future..."

Tian Youdao sat at the head, and he was now over seventy years old and well-experienced. Stroking his beard and pondering deeply, he said, "This matter is peculiar... Let me talk to the family head and clarify things. If the clan has any plans, we will cooperate accordingly!"

Since Tian Youdao was Li Xuanfeng's maternal uncle, he held significant seniority in the family, giving him the authority to speak on such matters. Seeing this, Tian Zhongqing could not help but feel a sense of relief.

Only uncle can speak like this in the clan...

"Zhongqing!" Tian Youdao called softly, and Tian Zhongqing quickly looked up. The uncle and nephew exchanged a solemn glance, and Tian Youdao said gravely, "Speaking of this... our family's current power and prestige seem to come from us breaking through to the Qi Cultivation Realm one after another, making the Tian Family a mainstay and earning the trust of the main family to control Mount Yue. But Zhongqing..."

He looked at his nephew and said softly, "You must understand... our family's power and prestige rest solely on me!"

Tian Zhongqing nodded heavily as he understood the gravity of his words. He had established his own family for many years. After fathering many children of his own, he had become much more mature.

He replied in a low voice, "The Ren and Dou Families are tied to the first lineage of the main family... Now that they have Lord Ximing, they eagerly follow him. The Liu Family has declined, and the Xu Family focuses solely on military loyalty, not leaning east or west, so there is nothing for them to worry about. But our Tian Family..."

Tian Youdao was Li Xuanfeng's maternal uncle, and the Tian Family had always been led by the third lineage of the main family. However, Li Xuanfeng had gone to Yi Mountain City in the southern border and had no heirs, leaving the Tian Family without support.

Li Xuanfeng said he was going to guard Yi Mountain City, but few who went there ever returned. Hence, everyone had silently assumed that he would never come back. The other prominent families were indifferent to this, but the Tian Family was secretly worried.

"Indeed..." Tian Youdao shook his head and replied, "I fear that one day if something were to happen to me, the Tian Family will be dismembered like the Liu Family."

Tian Zhongqing hesitated for a moment and asked softly, "Uncle, what do you think of the eldest son?"

Among the Xi and Yue generation of the Li Family, Li Xicheng was the eldest. Li Xizhi was the third, Li Ximing and Li Xijun were the seventh and eighth respectively, and the rest included one daughter and three sons who were all mortals and were sent down the mountain.

Li Xicheng was currently managing affairs in Mount Yue, making him the only son of the Li Family to work outside the mountain. He was from the second lineage of the main family—Li Tongya's line.

Tian Zhongqing, who had frequent interactions with him, explained, "The eldest son is very magnanimous, generous, and kind. If the Tian Family were to marry a daughter to him as a concubine and I sincerely foster a relationship with him, aligning ourselves with the secondary lineage, we might find great support..."

"The second lineage had once declined, lacking support from the maternal family, making him an excellent choice!" Tian Youdao nodded as he took a sip of tea and replied, "Go ahead and give it a try. Establish a good relationship first. I see that he has more than enough magnanimity but lacks firmness, making him easy to rely on. If you gain his trust, the family will be secure for generations."

In the grand hall with many guards, Li Yuanping sat cross-legged in a brocade robe. The meditation cushion beneath him emitted white light, helping him concentrate and avoid distractions.

"Family Head! A letter has arrived from the western road..." a clan guard at the lower seat quietly announced, seeing that Li Yuanping was cultivating in the hall and dared not approach.

Li Yuanping had rare moments of leisure in recent days, which allowed him to cultivate. Although the gains were minimal, it was better than nothing.

"Bring it up."

Li Yuanping exhaled as he reached out to take the letter, using a specific spell to open the secret letter. He unfolded it and read, "Donghe has reached the western desert, a place called the Smoke Valley Desert. The two followers are respectful and without issue. There are many passes here and we are staying as guests at the Smoke Valley Temple under the jurisdiction of the Golden Feather Sect. The three of us will work together, and in seven years we can return with the qi."

"Excellent!"

Seeing that there was a way to collect the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi in the west, Li Yuanping was overjoyed. He looked at the small letter in his hand and asked, "Where did this come from?"
𝚏𝕣𝕖𝚎𝚠𝚎𝚋𝚗𝐨𝐯𝕖𝕝.𝕔𝐨𝕞

"Reporting to Family Head, it was carried by an unrefined Qi Cultivator merchant on the road," the clan guard replied.

Li Yuanping nodded in understanding before taking a brush and wrote a large Excellent, along with some words of encouragement and language to express his gratitude. He sealed it with his own dharma seal and handed it to Dou Yi with a single command.

"Reward him with some Spirit Paddies and let him take it back."

In this world, communication was not supposed to be so troublesome. This was without mentioning ancient times where it was said that a thousand years ago, there were communication talismans and similar items. But later, for unknown reasons, these talismans either lost their effectiveness or became prohibitively expensive, and not many used them anymore.

Collecting his thoughts, Li Yuanping refocused his attention on family affairs.

"Mount Yue is easy to handle."

A few days ago, Li Yuanjiao mentioned this matter and had discussed it in detail with Li Yuanping before returning to the mountain for cultivation. Now, Li Yuanping focused his concentration on figuring out how to solve these two issues.

Li Yuanping had long been dissatisfied with Mount Yue and had secretly made arrangements. However, he found that dealing with the clan's many disciples was a headache.

"If it really comes to what Big Brother said... where would we find another place..."

Li Yuanping sorted the letters on the table, gathering intelligence from nearby families.

The Yu Family had been quiet recently. Yu Mugao was busy organizing the clan, killing some members some days and releasing others the next. Despite the numerous brothers, they could not fight back at all and were slaughtered like lambs daily.

"He really dares to kill..." Li Yuanping mumbled as he looked at the list of names and pursed his lips. He thought to himself and concluded that although Yu Mugao enjoyed the killing, he had left behind many hidden dangers. Shaking his head, he turned his attention back to the families on the eastern shore.

There were more than a dozen families scattered along the eastern shore, though most were small families at the Embryonic Breathing or Qi Cultivation Realms. The situation was quite complex with many entanglements, so few people dared to interfere.

Both the northern and eastern shores of Moongaze Lake used to be the territory of the Golden Tang Gate, and the eastern shore families had numerous connections with the Golden Tang Gate. Although the gate had weakened and lost this territory, some relationships remained. This was one factor.

Another factor was that the eastern shore families held several valuable ore veins and spirit springs, and all were secretly controlled by the Xiao Family from the west. Xiao Family members guarded these places under the guise of guest cultivators, enabling them the power to maintain the situation while profiting from it.

This arrangement should not have been allowed, but the Azure Pond Sect had turned a blind eye to this. The Xiao Family preferred to see the situation fragmented, and so this arrangement remained for years.

Moreover, Moongaze Lake bordered the Xiao Family's territory. These families maintained the buffer zone, bordering the Golden Tang Gate to the north and the Li and Ding families to the south. The competition among various forces made the area highly sensitive.

These factors combined to maintain the status quo among the eastern shore families, with no significant changes for a hundred years. When the Jiang Family prospered, they supported them; and when the Yu Family dominated, they supported them. Now, with the Yu Family's decline and a tripartite power structure on the lake, each family sought its own protector.

Back when the market collapsed and the Yu Family declined, our family had the opportunity to take over some tributary families. However, we were understaffed at the time and only wanted to bide our time, so we missed our chance.

Li Yuanping thought for a moment, his heart stirring with ambition. He thought to himself, Now that our family's finances are tight, if we could intervene... we could gain some tributes and support some forces on the eastern shore...

While considering the feasibility of this idea, he called to Dou Yi at the lower seat.

"Go to the Clan Affairs Courtyard and get me a report on the eastern shore families."

Dou Yi quickly nodded and hurried off. Unexpectedly, another person ran up from below and said respectfully, "Reporting to Family Head! There is a cultivator seeking an audience on the road!"

"A cultivator on the road..?"

Li Yuanping was slightly taken aback. Knowing that anyone who was reported up to the hall must not be any simple or trivial matter, he took this seriously. "What is their cultivation level? Are they seeking something?" he asked.

The clan guard hesitated and answered, "According to Master An, the person is likely not a Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivator. They wear a robe with cuffed sleeves and appear youthful. I heard that their aura far surpasses the Foundation Establishment Realm... As for their business here, they insist on seeing you personally."

An Zheyan had seen powerful figures like Yu Xiaogui and Li Tongya in the past and could roughly estimate the strength of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Hearing that this person far surpassed the Foundation Establishment Realm made Li Yuanping's expression fall solemn.

"Not a Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivator!? Seeking my presence?" Li Yuanping was momentarily stunned and then said sternly, "Go and inform Brother Jiao, but... no need to have him come over. Let him keep watch on the mountain... Have Master An and others ready to suppress this person in case they suddenly act up."

Li Yuanping's face looked somewhat grim. He always despised unexpected troubles, especially when the other party, despite politely visiting, had a cultivation far beyond the Foundation Establishment Realm. If they caused trouble, the Li Family could not handle it.

"Damn it!" he cursed in frustration, then exhaled and said softly, "Escort him to the side hall to wait."

"Yes!" Dou Yi responded as the others quickly retreated.

Li Yuanping sat back on the main seat, thinking to himself, Though he doesn't look like a Buddhist cultivator, he might be disguising himself... Maybe he's a devil cultivator... Our family has never encountered a devil cultivator from Jiangnan, but we've heard they look no different from ordinary people. We might not be able to recognize them.

He took two steps down the stairs. After all, it was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator visiting. In the Li Family, only he had enough weight to handle this, without risking too much loss if things went awry.

"This is not the time to show weakness... It would be bad if he became suspicious. I should go meet him," Li Yuanping mumbled to himself quietly as he walked to the front of the hall and stepped lightly toward the corridor. As he walked, he saw Li Wen following him, carrying a mace as big as a human head without saying a word.

Seeing Li Wen's immense figure, Li Yuanping felt a bit more confident and smiled.

"What a sturdy fellow you are!" he remarked.

"Hehe," Li Wen chuckled in response.

When Li Yuanping reached the side hall, he said gently, "You do not need to come in. Just wait outside."

After all, the gap between Foundation Establishment Realm and Qi Cultivation Realm was too vast. According to An Zheyan's description, if Li Wen went in, it would only take one palm strike from the visitor to send him flying, which would make them seem weak.

Seeing Li Wen nod dumbly, Li Yuanping pushed the door open and entered.

The side courtyard was simple and unadorned, with only a few wooden tables. Sitting by one small table was a young man with an ordinary face and a daoist crown on his head. A wooden sword rested on his knees, which appeared to be made of peach wood.

He looked to be only about twenty years old, wearing a plain Daoist robe with golden embroidery on the cuffs of an unknown origin. The peach wood sword seemed ordinary and dull, not like any precious treasure.

A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator at twenty years old?

Li Yuanping secretly assumed that this person must be using an illusion to disguise his appearance, becoming even more cautious.

"The Li Family welcomes you, Senior... May I ask how to address you?" Li Yuanping stepped forward with a smile, speaking politely yet confidently.

"Greetings, Family Head! I am Wang Xun from Yinghua Prefecture in Zhao State! Thank you for your hospitality!"

Unexpectedly, the young cultivator reacted with great enthusiasm, jumping up from his seat almost right away. The peach wood sword on his knees flipped in the air and floated lightly. Wang Xun, seemingly unaware, had responded courteously.

Seeing his response and demeanor, Li Yuanping felt slightly relieved. He glanced unobtrusively at the peach wood sword and smiled as he said, "Oh, a guest from Zhao State! I am Li Yuanping... Apologies for keeping you waiting."

"No need for apologies!" The man smiled in return. Seeing Li Yuanping not taking the main seat but instead choosing to sit to the side, Wang Xun's tense expression relaxed, and he also sat down.

Watching the young man's sincere reactions, Li Yuanping felt even more at ease and called out, "Serve the tea!"

The attendants quickly brought the tea, placed it before them, and left hurriedly. Li Yuanping smiled, observing the shy and bashful young man in front of him while still on guard. "May I ask, Senior... Where do you come from? Is there anything you need? If my family can help, we will certainly do so."

The young man seemed unaccustomed to worldly interactions and had not mentioned his background. Li Yuanping asked about his background to gauge if he belonged to a significant sect or family, which would inform his response.

Still smiling courteously, he poured tea from a jade pot.

The young man hesitated, nodding repeatedly, as though he had already expected to be asked about his family lineage. I come from the Wang Family in Yinghua, a great-grandson of True Monarch Xiaojin and the son of Daoist Master Yingyuan..." he replied hurriedly.

"Wow..."

Li Yuanping felt as if he had been slapped out of nowhere, and his head buzzed. His steady hand suddenly shook, spilling several drops of tea.

"True Monarch Xiaojin! A Golden Core Realm cultivator!" he exclaimed.

He looked up in shock and stammered, "Senior... you say you are the great-grandson of a True Monarch and the son of a Daoist Master?!"




# Chapter 369: Wang Xun

As soon as Wang Xun had entered the Li Family's territory, Lu Jiangxian, who was deeply engrossed in his studies, was immediately alerted.

Lu Jiangxian had set up several nodes in his divine sense to alert him of the following matters: if a direct descendant of the Li Family was about to die, if the aura of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator appeared, or if a member of the Li Family broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm...

He himself was repeatedly delving into the memory fragments of Maha Jinlian from years ago, trying to find clues to the origin of the Golden Temple Radiant Origin Manual or hints of the Purple Mansion Realm Records.

Wang Xun's powerful sword qi, shining like a great ball of light, instantly woke Lu Jiangxian, who looked at the young man with some confusion.

"He is not a Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivator?!"

Lu Jiangxian's divine sense hovered around Wang Xun, feeling that his fate was completely blank, likely protected by some extraordinary method to avoid worldly entanglements.

Focusing once more, Lu Jiangxian saw a golden sword case appear on Wang Xun's broad back. It was intricately patterned, mostly with cloud motifs, totaling one hundred and twenty-eight in number.

The case contained sixteen sword slots which was already holding ten swords, all hidden within, their forms indiscernible.

"Divine ability... or fate?"

The sword case on Wang Xun's back was invisible to ordinary eyes but seemed extraordinary to him. Although it was clearly a divine ability, it was filled with the aura of fate. Lu Jiangxian, now quite experienced, observed for a while and made some deductions in his heart.

The northern path of cultivation... combines life and essence, consuming qi to seek essence and nourishing life with divine abilities... Difficult, truly difficult!

Lu Jiangxian looked at the sword case for a couple of moments, cautiously refraining from probing it with his divine sense. After all, this was a descendant of a Golden Core Realm cultivator and such an act might have hidden dangers.

After carefully observing the young man, Lu Jiangxian had a strong premonition that this was the most orthodox and original method of cultivation—one that cultivated both heart and essence, seeking truth and immortality... directly pointing oneself to the path of the immortal!

"But if this is how cultivation is done, the difficulty is too great... Only one in a thousand spiritual orifice children might be able to succeed... or less than that. If the Li Family were to practice this method now, not a single one might succeed, and even producing a spark would be considered impressive..." he mused in amazement.

Lu Jiangxian gazed at the sword case, countless profound ideas flooding his mind, and could not help but praise and sigh.

"Life and essence duo cultivation, huh!"

Compared to this immortal method, the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao was completely different. First, they nurtured the chakra and absorbed qi. After reaching the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, they discarded it to build the immortal foundation and cultivate divine abilities. After completing the divine abilities, they sought essence, even absorbing similar immortal foundations to enhance their cultivation...

If Wang Xun's immortal Dao was like climbing a mountain with integrity, the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao was like choosing the easiest path. Destroying and plundering along the way, without the need for seeking truth in the heart, each step bringing its own power.

"No wonder the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao is prevalent; they lower the threshold for cultivation so much..." Lu Jiangxian mumbled. He stared at him for a while, gradually gaining some insight into the ancient battles between immortals and devils, and could not help but sigh softly.

Seeing Li Yuanping lose his composure for the first time in years, Lu Jiangxian smiled lightly, sensing that Wang Xun had no malicious intent and even wished to avoid contact with the Li Family to prevent entanglements, let alone harm them.

"It might even be a good thing!" he smiled triumphantly to himself.

————

Side courtyard at the foot of the mountain.

"Indeed, our True Monarch is Xiaojin, one of the Three Gold in the state... uh..." Wang Xun explained as he nodded but eventually paused, realizing he might have said too much, then slowly continued, "Fellow Daoist Yuanping, I am new to Jiangnan and unfamiliar with the southern customs. I have come with a request and do not intend to use my status to oppress. If I have offended in any way, please do not take it to heart..."

"Not at all! Not at all!" Li Yuanping quickly exclaimed, and he still found the situation hard to believe and wished Wang Xun would say more. Seeing his sincere expression, Li Yuanping quickly responded and secretly began calculating, then asked, "Although our family is somewhat known in this area, we are small and insignificant. What brings you to visit us, Senior..?"

"This... is a long story." Wang Xun replied with a mysterious smile on his youthful face as he continued, "My Wang Family does not cultivate the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao of Jiangnan but the ancient method of spiritual cultivation. This method has been lost in Jiangnan for a long time. If I were to explain it in detail, it might take three days and nights."

"According to the understanding of Daoist cultivation in Jiangnan, I need to cultivate the divine ability known as Nurturing Azure Heaven, which requires gathering one hundred and twenty-eight sword qi and sixteen sword intents, forming a unique path to cultivate this divine ability."

He paused as he picked up the jade cup and smiled, looking at Li Yuanping with anticipation then continued eagerly, "My family has over a hundred people who have cultivated sword qi. I have already gathered them, but sword intents are rare. The Wang Family only has two, and I must venture out to find the rest to complete my Dao. So, I asked my father for advice, and he deduced that there are still four sword immortals and two spirit swords in Jiangnan that I could seek out."

Hearing this, Li Yuanping roughly understood why Wang Xun had come. Wang Xun took a sip of tea and, somewhat shyly, said, "When I arrived at the lake, I secretly divined that your clan possesses a spirit sword, residing in Mount Lijing, known as the Qingche."

Placing the jade cup down, Wang Xun stood up solemnly and shook his sleeves as he stepped back.

"I humbly ask the family head to lend me the sword for a look, so I may advance on my path... I would be immensely grateful!"

Wang Xun simply cupped his fist lightly and bowed his head without bending at the waist. Although his words were respectful, his demeanor seemed somewhat arrogant.

Li Yuanping, thinking Wang Xun was of immortal lineage, found it not unusual. Wang Xun, looking embarrassed, quickly added, "My fate restricts me from bowing to serve others, lest it brings harm to you, Family Head. Please do not take offense!"

Li Yuanping, hearing this explanation for the first time, was suddenly enlightened and took note of it, replying that he dared not take offense. He then explained, "The Qingche Sword is a treasured heirloom of our family, both a dharma artifact and a ritual instrument. This is a serious matter... I must report it to the elders of the clan and let them decide. Please wait a moment."

"Of course, of course! That is as it should be!" Wang Xun exclaimed in understanding as he nodded repeatedly. With this, Li Yuanping stepped outside, whispering to Li Wen about the details and sending him up the mountain to report.

Watching the strong man leave, Li Yuanping returned to the hall, his mind racing with thoughts.

This person seems knowledgeable, speaking of things usually kept secret within sects. It would be wise to take this rare opportunity to learn more! After all, the knowledge from a True Monarch's family is priceless.

Before he could speak, Wang Xun eagerly continued, "Your clan is known for its swordsmanship and bears the surname Li, residing by Moongaze Lake. Could you be related to Daoist Master Donghua of the Moonlight Origin Mansion?"

Li Yuanping, unfamiliar with the name, replied, "No, our family descends from Ancestor Mutian, a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. Our ancestral origins are untraceable, and we have never heard of such a Daoist Master."

Wang Xun nodded and smiled, "The Daoist Master's real name was Li Jiangqun, a sword master of great renown... His reputation even reached Yinghua Prefecture in Zhao State. He was a supreme cultivator of Moongaze Marsh in his time."

"So that is the case..." Li Yuanping mumbled, even deeper in thought.

Privately, the direct descendants of the Li Family had suspected this, but there was no evidence of it. Moreover, the karmic ties of Li Jiangqun were too significant. Being a small clan, the Li Family preferred to avoid such connections rather than seek them out.

At that moment, he decided to change the topic, probing the stance of this spiritual cultivation Dao. With a smile, he said, "I heard that the North has fallen to the Jie people and Buddhism cultivators... I did not expect to still find fellow Daoists like ourselves."

"Well..." Wang Xun paused and explained, "Although the Jie people have pushed north due to the dominance of Buddhism cultivation to their south, there are still many grotto heavens and blessed lands in the North where cultivators seclude themselves. Some small states are not under Buddhist rule... Moreover..."

He smiled awkwardly and continued, "The Spiritual Cultivation Dao waged war with your Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao a thousand years ago. In the past century, although circumstances forced many alliances, we can hardly call each other fellow Daoists..."

"I see... I have overstepped!" Li Yuanping laughed it off as realization dawned upon him. Although he was quite curious about this Spiritual Cultivation Dao, he did not dare pry into another's Dao lineage. The young man before him was naive about worldly matters, not foolish; a few questions were enough.

Wang Xun, feeling slightly guilty at Li Yuanping's apology, quickly added, "There is no inherent good or evil in Dao; it all lies in human actions. I am not one to judge based on Dao lineages. Last year, I visited Yue Cultivating Sect to ask for a sword from Senior Shangyuan and had a delightful conversation with him..."

"Daoist Master Shangyuan..." Li Yuanping responded, hearing a name he had only encountered in rumors, he then continued, "The Daoist Master is said to be a sword immortal second only to Golden Core Realm cultivators, with unparalleled sword intent."

"Indeed, he is formidable!" Wang Xun sighed, showing a serious expression for the first time as he praised, "His sword is astonishing... On one side, it is ethereal and transcendent, purging evil and vanquishing demons. On the other side, it is like cold snow in the vast sky, chilling to the bone! Even our True Monarch has never seen someone with two such distinct sword intents in one body."

On the other side, Li Wen, having received his orders, silently flew up. The courtyard on the mountain was quiet, with Li Yuanjiao standing motionless in black, his face somber.

Xiao Guiluan held his arm silently, her face also showing worry. She had recently broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, her vitality-filled cultivation healing injuries and detoxifying poisons.

"Brother."

Li Qinghong, holding a long spear, also wore a solemn expression. After a long silence, she said, "Though it is said so, leaving Brother Ping alone at the foot of the mountain makes me very uneasy."

"There is no other choice..." Li Yuanjiao muttered as he gritted his teeth and said quietly, "After all... there is no room for sentimental attachments now. I swore before our granduncle's spirit that you and I must not come to harm."

"Hand that spear over to me!" Li Qinghong demanded glumly.

Li Yuanjiao was slightly stunned but still took out a jade box from his storage pouch, speaking softly, "I thought of this before coming and brought it along. Granduncle said this spear is fierce and unruly, damaging one's vitality and shortening one's lifespan... He never used it after acquiring it. He instructed that it should not be handed to you unless you reached the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm, but if things truly turn dire, having this spear might give you a better chance of escape..."

He handed over the jade box, and Li Qinghong quickly took it. Just then, the courtyard door creaked open, and several external Qi Cultivators and guest cultivators hurried in, greeting in unison as they stepped into the courtyard.

After greeting them, Li Qinghong gently opened the jade box, revealing a long spear lying inside.

The spear was entirely silver-white, with a seven cun long, diamond-tipped head, flat like buckwheat. The shaft was six che long and was intricately patterned, with mana light flowing through it. It was all one color, making it indistinguishable without close inspection.

As soon as the box was opened, the spear, as if harboring years of pent-up anger, burst forth with a series of white, shimmering electric sparks, leaping out of the box instantly. However, Li Qinghong caught it single-handedly.

"Hah!"

Delicate purple energy swirled in her almond-shaped eyes. Li Qinghong grunted with joy, and with a flip of her hand, the long spear gradually calmed down, emanating streaks of purple lightning that lay obediently in her red-tinged white palm.

"And the spear's name..?"

The spear bore no markings, as the maker had left no name on it. It would reveal its name only when it acknowledged its master, and Li Yuanjiao had been curious for a long time. Seeing Li Qinghong tame the spear now, he eagerly asked his question out of deep curiosity.

Li Qinghong's jade-like fingers opened, grasped, and turned. The spear spun like a beam of white light, swiftly moving from a horizontal position to an upright one. The long, flat tip pointed diagonally at the ground and it hummed softly.

"Its name is Duruo[1]!"

Li Qinghong's voice was clear and bright, her eyes sparkling like stars. Dressed in jade armor and long boots, her already heroic attire combined with the spear gave her a breathtaking presence, capturing everyone's attention.

Most of the family's Qi Cultivators were present. Tian Youdao and An Zheyan, being the oldest, remained calm, while Tian Zhongqing and Xu Gongming were momentarily stunned before quickly averting their gazes.

Madam Dou, dressed in a red dress, looked at her niece with envy.

"Good!"

Li Yuanjiao could not help but praise, a hint of pride on his face. He did not have time to ponder why the spear had such a name, thinking to himself, Qinghong's equipment is probably on par with that of sect disciples... With this spear, our family will surely gain renown!

The Duruo Spear was considered excellent among Foundation Establishment Realm artifacts. The Li Family had not seen many of such artifacts, but both the Qingche Sword and this spear were clearly superior to the Jade Smoke Mountain of the Yu Family.

Li Yuanjiao recomposed himself and coughed twice, making Tian Zhongqing and Xu Gongming, who kept glancing at Li Qinghong, feel a bit embarrassed. He then said in a deep voice, "A Foundation Establishment Realm external cultivator has arrived at our home and is waiting at the foot of the mountain. Coincidentally, the ancestor is away in the north seeking opportunities to break through to mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm..."

Their doubts were instantly dispelled. Tian Youdao stroked his long beard and said in a grave voice, "I fear that this person might be a devil cultivator... If he goes mad, it could result in a bloodbath!"

Tian Zhongqing and Xu Gongming exchanged a glance and suddenly realized why they had been called up the mountain. If that person was indeed a devil cultivator, only the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation could hold him off to some extent...

"Thank you for your protection, Family Head!" An Zheyan quickly said, offering a word of flattery, though his expression was somewhat grim. After all, his wife and children were still at the foot of the mountain. His wife Li Feiruo had borne him two sons and a daughter, all with spiritual orifices, which was quite rare.

Li Yuanjiao shook his head slightly and said in assurance, "The Clan Affairs Courtyard has already taken the direct descendants and their wives and daughters to the foot of the mountain."

At these words, the group relaxed. Li Yuanping had been thorough in his preparations, easing a lot of the burden on Li Yuanjiao. After all, they might need these people to guard the formation later, and it was better for them to have no distractions.

Liu Changdie had left eight high platforms when he established the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation, which could be used to reinforce the barrier. With eight people present, they could fully activate the formation, making it difficult even for a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to break through it.

Li Wen was still at the foot of the mountain...

As Li Yuanjiao was thinking of this, someone descended into the courtyard with a gust of wind. The figure was large, holding a big mace with both hands, looking quite fierce—it was Li Wen.

Li Wen landed, then bowed respectfully.

"Family Head!"

After conveying Li Yuanping's message and explaining the situation, Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly and waved his hand, "Go to your designated formation points."
𝘧𝑟𝑒𝑒𝘸𝘦𝘣𝑛𝑜𝘷𝑒𝓁.𝘤𝘰𝓂

The guest cultivators and external cultivators all nodded and dispersed. Li Qinghong assigned a formation point to Li Wen, then turned back and asked, "Brother! Can we trust him?"

"Probably..." Li Yuanjiao said as he squinted slightly.

However, Li Qinghong was still wary and cautioned, "I am afraid Brother Ping might be under a spell."

Li Yuanjiao suddenly had an idea and replied, "Let us take a look and find out!"

He turned and entered the courtyard, soon returning with a small bluish-gray mirror. Li Qinghong immediately understood his intentions and Li Yuanjiao closed his eyes, focusing on the mountain.

Sitting by a small table in the side courtyard was a young man in white, with a daoist crown on his head and an ordinary face. His aura was calm and transparent under the mirror's gaze, even exuding a celestial air, and he was clearly not an evildoer.

At that moment, Wang Xun was holding a jade cup, sipping tea. A peach wooden sword lay on his knees, and the cuffs of his daoist robe were embroidered with golden patterns. He carried a sword case on his back that glimmered with a golden light, giving off a slightly ethereal quality.

"A sword case..?" Li Yuanjiao voiced his doubt.

1. Duruo also means White Iris flower. ☜




# Chapter 371: Wanglin Blossom

Li Yuanjiao held the mirror for a while, unable to decipher anything. He assumed this person was an immortal descendant of a Golden Core Realm cultivator and that the item on his back was a treasure.

Gritting his teeth, he handed the mirror to Li Qinghong and said softly, "I will go down and take a look... You hold the mirror and observe. If anything happens, activate the Supreme Yin Profound Light immediately."

"All right!"

Li Qinghong strapped the spear to her back and took the mirror, feeling a cool sensation as the white light flowed across its surface, giving it a mystical aura.

"What a fine mirror..." she murmured to herself as she held the mirror, feeling an all-over coolness on her body, her senses becoming sharp and clear. The spear on her back, which had been emitting white light, quickly dimmed and fell silent.

Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao arrived at the foot of the mountain. Inside the hall, Li Yuanping was having a pleasant conversation with Wang Xun. As Li Yuanjiao approached the courtyard, he heard a hearty laugh.

"Brother Yuanping, you must be joking! My Wang Family is limited to Yinghua Prefecture, with just over 200,000 people in the mundane world! Those who attain the Dao enter our family's grotto heaven, avoiding worldly entanglements, so naturally, there are no connections. The lord of my family is one of the Three Gold, and even among the Buddhist Sects, there is constant internal strife, with factions too busy currying favor to dare interfere with us... And so this is how things have been for centuries."

Li Yuanjiao gently knocked on the door before entering. Wang Xun looked up and immediately fixed his gaze on the sharp sword at Li Yuanjiao's waist. Li Yuanping smiled and introduced him to the guest.

"Senior, this is my elder brother, Li Yuanjiao."

"Greetings, fellow Daoist!"

They exchanged polite greetings. Wang Xun carefully observed Li Yuanjiao before smiling and commenting, "Your brother has quite an impressive presence!"

Li Yuanjiao responded politely to his compliment and then said, "I already know the purpose of your visit, Senior. Our family’s spirit sword contains a preserved sword intent left by our elder, sealed for many years and never used. If you wish to borrow the sword to advance your path, do you intend to take the sword or the intent? And if so, will it damage the sword intent?"

Li Yuanjiao had already thought the matter through and went straight to the point.

"Fellow Daoist..." Wang Xun smiled wryly and replied, "Our Wang Family has plenty of Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts—most of them swords. I have traveled far to seek this sword specifically for its intent."

"As for whether it will damage the sword intent..." Wang Xun paused, thinking for a moment, then answered, "I need to examine the sword to determine that."

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly, removed the sword from his waist, drew it from its sheath, and solemnly presented it.

"Please take a look."

The young man was overjoyed and carefully took the sword, admiring the green-white blade with the elegantly inscribed characters—Qingche.

Wang Xun could not help but praise, "Four che and five cun long, forged from seven che of Qingming Copper... Although the materials are average, the craftsmanship is exceptional. The sword has been nurtured by sword intent for years, making it a fine piece!"

"The sword intent within is as clear as water, as white as the moon, and nurtured for ten years. If this is unleashed... ordinary cultivators would not withstand it."

The Li brothers listened attentively. Wang Xun continued, "I only need a sliver of the intent. Based on my understanding of swordsmanship, it would reduce the sword intent's strength by at most... twenty percent."

He smiled awkwardly and quickly added, "I will not let your family suffer a loss! I can compensate with other items."

The brothers exchanged a glance, and Li Yuanjiao asked, "According to the standards of the Jiangnan Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, what power would this sword intent retain after the reduction?"

"Hmm..." Wang Xun pondered for a moment and then replied, "This sword intent is potent. Even if I draw a sliver from it, once the sword is wielded, a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator at the early stage would surely die. A mid-stage might escape with their life, but even a late-stage would suffer greatly if caught off guard."

As soon as Wang Xun had finished speaking, he saw the hesitation on the brothers' faces and continued, "Our Daoist tradition mandates minimal worldly ties; we cannot owe favors or intervene for others... However, compensating with spirit items, precious herbs, or pills is acceptable."

"Fellow Daoist, please use this sword to advance your path!"

Given Wang Xun's clear explanation and their inability to offend him, Li Yuanjiao reluctantly agreed. Wang Xun was overjoyed but remained cautious, saying solemnly, "What compensation would you require? Please, do not say anything polite, as it would put me in a difficult position!"

He stared intently at the two, fearing they would make unreasonable demands after he extracted the sword qi. It was evident that without clear terms, he would not proceed.

"Allow my brother and I a moment to discuss this," Li Yuanjiao replied courteously.

"Of course!" Wang Xun nodded, examining the sword as the brothers stepped outside the hall to talk.

Once outside, Li Yuanping and Li Yuanjiao both spoke at the same time.

"Essence Gathering Pill!"

"Spirit root!"

Both were momentarily stunned by each other’s outbursts and then laughed wryly. Li Yuanping had intended to ask for Essence Gathering Pills to help his brother and elder sister break through to Foundation Establishment Realm, while Li Yuanjiao had considered requesting a spirit root, similar to the Snake Dragon Tree, to alleviate their family's annual financial struggles.

Each brother had the family's best interests at heart—one focusing on cultivation, the other on the family's well-being. They shared a knowing smile. Li Yuanping quickly said, "The family can manage; the key is for you and our elder sister to break through! Even though the Essence Gathering Pill only increases the chances of Foundation Establishment Realm breakthrough by fifty percent, it's still a big help. Besides, since the Wang Family is descended from Golden Core Realm cultivators, he might have even more powerful pills..."

Li Yuanjiao thought for a moment and hesitated, "I also feel that everything Wang Xun holds is extraordinary... Although the Essence Gathering Pill is precious, it seems a waste to exchange it for a favor from the Wang Family. If he has a spirit root, it would surely be a special one that could sustain our family for centuries to come..."

Given that Wang Xun promised spirit items and precious herbs, and since the brothers had seen many spirit items but not many treasured panaceas, their best bet was a spirit root. With one such root, they could continuously produce spirit items.

After some deliberation, the brothers found themselves in a dilemma. Li Yuanping laughed and said, "Now that we have such an opportunity, it is making us hesitant."

Li Yuanjiao pondered for a moment and then replied, "Let us ask the senior first... We don't know whether he has something better than the Essence Gathering Pill or maybe no spirit roots on hand. With clear options, we can then compare and decide."

"Agreed!"

They then returned to the courtyard and tactfully presented their request to Wang Xun. He nodded in relief as he mumbled thoughtfully, "A spirit root... I do have one, which I found by chance in our grotto heaven."

He retrieved a red-yellow seed the size of an almond from his storage pouch and said softly, "This is called the Wanglin Blossom. A thousand years ago, it was the treasured relic of the Wanglin Upper Sect in Jiangbei. After the spiritual energy waned, it could no longer thrive there, and only a few remain in our grotto heaven. This spirit root blooms every three years and withers in three days, bearing fruit every three hundred years. It is very delicate and requires daily watering with spirit spring water if the spiritual energy is insufficient. Its flowers are a type of spirit item, considered to be of the Foundation Establishment Realm according to the standards of Jiangnan, and can alleviate worries and sustain life."




# Chapter 372: Generation After Generation

"Whoa!"

As soon as Wang Xun spoke, the two brothers were stunned, secretly amazed. After all, Wang Xun was an immortal descendant of a Golden Core Realm cultivator, and his understanding of spirit roots was on a completely different level compared to the Li Family's.

The Li Family's Snake Dragon Tree was merely between the Embryonic Breathing Realm and Qi Cultivation Realm, while Wang Xun immediately offered a Foundation Establishment Realm item, leaving the brothers speechless.

Wang Xun, seemingly unaware of their amazement, continued to explain nonchalantly, "This Wanglin Blossom has the effect of alleviating worries and sustaining life, and its flowers bloom like red jade. Normally, consuming them can calm the mind, eliminate distracting thoughts, and enhance cultivation... In life-and-death situations, chewing and swallowing the flowers can sustain the body and prolong life. From our family's experience, this can sustain a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator for several days. The more consumed, the less effective it becomes. However, if the quantity is sufficient, it can sustain someone for up to half a month without any issues."

Upon hearing this, Li Yuanjiao was immediately tempted. He stared at the red-yellow almond-sized seed, his thoughts racing, Our Mount Huaqian has a spirit spring... I wonder if it can support this spirit root. The flowers can be consumed for cultivation, given as gifts, or sold to wealthy clans!

Although sustaining life for a few days seemed insignificant for a small clan like the Li Family, it was quite valuable for a large clan. Combined with certain pills and talismans, it could enable a heavily injured Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to make it home.

For large clans like the Xiao Family, who possessed numerous elixirs, the chances of survival were significantly higher as long as there was still a breath left.

Seeing the two brothers deep in thought, Wang Xun smiled gently.

"As for the Essence Gathering Pill, our Wang Family has those, as well as better pills. However, such items are of no use to me, so I did not bring them. I only have a few bottles of Essence Gathering Pills for rewards."

After saying this, he took out a jade bottle from his storage pouch and flicked his finger. A pill flew out, snow-white and crystal clear, emitting a pleasant fragrance. Wang Xun smiled and said, "This Essence Gathering Pill is of high quality, certainly not inferior! You may inspect it, but merely exchanging your sword intent for these pills might seem like I am bullying you with my status."

The Essence Gathering Pill, when taken for the first time, could greatly enhance the probability of achieving Foundation Establishment Realm and was an excellent cultivation pill. It was not particularly rare, and the materials required for its production were not exceedingly expensive. However, the recipe and materials were monopolized by the three sects and seven gates, only used as rewards for disciples, making it quite rare in the Yue State.

In Wang Xun's eyes, these were merely common supplementary pills and not particularly valuable, hence he felt it was an inappropriate offer.

Li Yuanping carefully inspected it, finding the fragrance delightful. Li Yuanjiao, upon seeing the pill, was startled, his eyes widening in shock. His back was cold, and he exclaimed, "This is an Essence Gathering Pill?!"

The Li Family had seen Essence Gathering Pills before. Li Tongya had taken them in the past, and there were mentions of them in the family records. Li Yuanping, not being well-versed in cultivation, was unaware, but Li Yuanjiao had memorized the records.

The Essence Gathering Pill the Li Family had obtained was white with gray patterns and coiled in shape, causing dizziness with a single whiff. Yet, the pill before them was bright, smooth, and delicate like a jade bead, filling the room with a nice fragrance; completely different from what they had seen before.

Greatly shocked and speechless, Li Yuanjiao's mind was filled with a terrifying question.

If this is an Essence Gathering Pill... what did our ancestor take back then..?

Wang Xun, noticing Li Yuanjiao's reaction, thoughtfully glanced at him and swirled the small cup on the table.

"The Essence Gathering Pill, named for its ability to consolidate one's essence and remove impurities, uses the Azure Amber Spirit Grass as the main ingredient, combined with twelve supplementary herbs, refined with three specific types of flames..."

Wang Xun appeared knowledgeable about medicinal herbs and pill formulas, calmly explaining as he noticed Li Yuanjiao's reaction.

Li Yuanjiao, feeling a chill down his spine, asked in a low voice, "Senior, if the pill has gray patterns, is coiled in shape, and its spiritual qi is intense with effects similar to the Essence Gathering Pill... Can you identify what kind of pill that might be?"

"Gray patterns?"

Wang Xun pondered for a moment, his expression turning cold, and replied in a low voice, "In Jiangnan, there are many different Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace techniques that incorporate human blood qi into pills. When mortal and spiritual energy combine, they can form certain patterns... Those are pills made from other human's essence and qi. Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace techniques produce pills that are far superior in both quantity and quality compared to ordinary pills. If the streaks are gray, it means that some kind of immortal foundation might have been used. These pills are often taken by the core members of devil sects. Consuming it significantly boosts cultivation and has astonishing effects."

Although Wang Xun's voice was not loud, it exploded like a thunderclap. Li Yuanjiao staggered a step backward, looking at the person in front of him in disbelief. He almost couldn't breathe but managed to squeeze a reply out of himself.

"Thank you, Senior... We will choose the spirit root!"

While responding, his mind finally cleared up and many of his doubts were resolved, though such realization filled him with increasing dread.

Granduncle once said he thought his talent was mediocre and that achieving Foundation Establishment Realm would be a life-or-death struggle... He hadn't expected it to happen so smoothly! So it was... it was... because of the pills?!

That's why it was so easy for him to achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm back then! Of course, in order to make my granduncle a bait for Maha, he must succeed in his breakthrough... If he failed and perished, the Maha would simply find another target and the bait would be lost...

Wang Xun continued to chat with Li Yuanping while taking out a jade box, placing the spirit root inside, and handing it to him.

"I will cultivate in this side courtyard for a few days. The Family Head can stay nearby, so he won't have to worry about me running away with the sword..." he reassured softly.

Li Yuanjiao listened to their polite conversation in a daze and unknowingly walked out of the side courtyard, still in a trance. Wang Xun's words kept echoing in his mind.

In Jiangnan, there are many different Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace techniques that incorporate human blood qi into pills. When mortal and spiritual energy combine, they can form certain patterns... Those are pills made from other human's essence and qi...

Wang Xun's words were vague, but his eyes and hints were extremely clear. "Pills made from human's essence and qi" clearly meant Human Pills... made from the blood qi and essence qi collected from annual slaughters!

He walked in a daze to the main hall, where Li Yuanping, looking worried, called out repeatedly. Li Yuanjiao seemed to wake from a dream and hurriedly took off his storage pouch from his waist.

With a grave expression, Li Yuanjiao gently patted the storage pouch, pouring out several jade bottles that clattered onto the table. He picked up one and poured its contents into his palm.

This pill was the most common Jade Sprout Pill, mostly distributed from the Yundan Peak of the Azure Pond Sect. The Azure Pond Sect's pills were of particularly high quality, favored by rogue cultivators, making them easily recognizable.

The Jade Sprout Pill was a pale yellow color, with nothing special visible on the surface. Li Yuanjiao scanned it repeatedly with his spiritual sense and finally found faint, curly patterns.

The alchemist's skill was exquisite, making these patterns almost imperceptible. They were colorless, blending seamlessly with the pill.

Li Yuanjiao's eyes reddened, and he quickly poured out all the pills from his storage pouch, searching frantically. Finally, he found the Snake Essence Pill made by Xiao Yuansi for the Li Family last year and hurriedly poured it into his palm.

This pill was a pale red color, slightly smaller than the previous one, with a smooth and round surface. After flipping it over a dozen times, Li Yuanjiao could not find a single pattern on it.

I knew it! No wonder the Azure Pond Sect collects blood qi and resentment qi every year; most of them must be used for this! The Azure Pond Sect releases thousands of pills annually, sustaining half of the Yue State... How many circulate in the market?

Li Yuanjiao slowly closed his eyes, knowing that even within the Li Family, almost everyone had taken these pills. Only a few from the generation of Xi and Yue, who had just started cultivating, had not yet taken any...

Seeing his brother's inexplicable expression, Li Yuanping grew extremely anxious. Li Yuanjiao spoke in a low, deep voice, "Brother Ping, all the pills released by the Azure Pond Sect are made using mortal blood qi... Their high-level techniques remove the resentment qi, leaving only the blood qi and essence qi, making it just another ingredient, letting it go unnoticed by people... That pill Granduncle took back then was not an Essence Gathering Pill. The Chi Family knew Lord Chejing would never take that pill but would leave it for our family. They used another's immortal foundation to specially refine it... It might have been the Boundless Ocean!"

After explaining his deductions in detail, Li Yuanping stood still, staring at his brother, speechless for several moments. He slowly sat down, his face bewildered, muttering, "We have all consumed them... Every cultivator in Yue State takes these pills... The Azure Pond Sect has existed for five hundred years. Rogue cultivators, sect cultivators, clan cultivators—whether they know it or not—have been consuming these pills for generations! I have taken them, my father took them, my grandfather took them, and so did our ancestors... You and I... we have been eating humans, and we are also descendants of those who eat humans."

After finally processing this shocking news, he trembled and asked, "In your opinion, do any other clans know?"

"I have no idea."

Li Yuanjiao shook his head slowly, his expression complex, and said, "It is hard to say about the Yuan Family, but Xiao Yuansi is a righteous gentleman and must be unaware of this. As for the Xiao Family, having dominated for so many years, I cannot believe... not a chance, that they do not know."

At the peak of Mount Lijing.

Li Qinghong slowly clenched her fair and delicate hands into fists. The bluish-gray mirror faintly reflected her fine features. The spiritual sense magnified by the mirror covered not just Lijing Town but far beyond. She had heard every word exchanged between the two clearly.

"So that is how it is..."

She recalled the few pills she had consumed, wondering how many men, women, children, and elders had contributed their blood qi to those pills. A wave of nausea swept over her. Beside her, Lu Jiangxian was stunned, his heart sinking.

"The Azure Pond Sect... what kind of trickery is this? This means that the entire Yue State, and even all of Jiangnan, have been consuming these pills..."

For a moment, he was at a loss for words. After all, Lu Jiangxian came from a society that was governed by strict laws. Internally, he drew a line for the Li Family.

No slaughter, no blood sacrifice... I cannot bear to see that. If the Li Family gets involved in this, I might as well use the Profound Light to destroy them... But now, what should I do?

Lu Jiangxian's already limited knowledge was concentrated in the realm of shamanic spells and talismans. When it came to alchemy, his understanding remained at the level of those few alchemical books he had studied. Naturally, he could not identify the issues with these pills.

Furthermore, back when Li Tongya took the pills, Lu Jiangxian was just a novice. If Wang Xun had not pointed it out, he would have had no awareness of the problem contained within.

"Forget it. If they have unknowingly eaten these human meat buns, can it really be considered a crime...?" He sighed as he focused intently on the mirror, its profound light radiating and clearing the minds of the people below him, waking them from their state of growing inner demons.

Seeing the gradually awakening group, Lu Jiangxian felt troubled again. If the Li Family knowingly continued to consume these blood qi pills in the future... what then?

"Logically, past actions cannot be judged, and addressing it now would be too conspicuous. Moreover, these pills, refined from pure blood qi, would not trigger the talisman seeds' warnings... It is impossible to monitor the Li Family constantly..." Lu Jiangxian sighed deeply, shrinking within the mirror's world.

He murmured quietly, "The world is filthy... it is impossible to climb up cleanly. Let's take it one step at a time. Now that the Li Family has their own alchemist, they have room to maneuver. Let's see how they handle this!"

————

The members of the Li Family were deeply shaken by the news that had just been revealed to them. Meanwhile, in the side courtyard, Wang Xun gently held the long sword in front of him, hesitating for a moment as he appeared lost in thought.

"This Li Family still adheres to the righteous path, a rarity under the rule of these Jiangnan powers... But I wonder how long they can endure in such a corrupt world..."

The young man's eyebrows slightly furrowed, showing a hint of compassion. Even his own Wang Family could only avoid the world, what more could a mere Foundation Establishment Realm family achieve?

The currents of the world were like a torrent, and even his family's True Monarch could only protect the clan, let alone consider anything beyond that.

"The Heaven Dao is flawed, and we are powerless... If it were not for my family's teachings of seclusion, we would have been destroyed in that great calamity..."

Wang Xun brought his two fingers together and gently stroked the green-white sword. The clear, bright sword aura reflected in his eyes, filled with innocence, kindness along with... deep pain and guilt.

Although he came from a prestigious family, he had traveled the world, but he was unfamiliar with southern customs. Knowing that the Li Family dared not offend him, he could have easily given a few pills to appease them and avoid further entanglements.

However, as he traveled, he saw only joy and strict laws under the Li Family's governance, making him find them endearing. He felt compelled to offer something better, hence he had taken out the spirit root and given it to the Li Family willingly.

"Jiangnan is indeed as described in the books, with various factions pulling strings and everyone being powerless. Only the Yue Cultivating Sect seems somewhat righteous..."

With this thought, Wang Xun could not help but feel a sense of doubt and pondered, "That True Monarch is not a benevolent person, yet the Yue Cultivating Sect has adhered to the rules set by the Immortal Lord for so many years without overstepping their boundaries... which is truly puzzling."

He mulled over it but could not figure it out. Naturally gifted with an innate connection to the way of the sword, he was not adept at pondering these schemes and conspiracies. He shifted his thoughts and felt the grief and indignation within the spirit of the Qingche Sword.

"That Li Family Sword Immortal has indeed suffered an unjust death..."

Wang Xun let out a bitter laugh. Having traveled in the north, he found it to be dead and stagnant under the Buddhism rule, with everything remaining the same year after year. The Maha forever remained Maha, and the lowly commoners forever remained lowly commoners, filled with despair.

Jiangnan, on the other hand, was constantly chaotic, filled with betrayal and slaughter. Today, someone might break through the Qi Cultivation Realm and forge an artifact to annex another clan, and tomorrow, that person might be killed, resulting in the annihilation of their clan... It was not any better.

Placing the Qingche Sword on his knee, Wang Xun formed a seal and performed a spell, extracting strands of white sword intent. He sighed as he muttered quietly to himself, "If I had to choose, I would rather be born in Jiangnan... At least there is a path to take."




# Chapter 374: Eradicating the Pest

Three days passed in the blink of an eye. Wang Xun handed the Qingche Sword back to the Li Family, saying simply, "It is better than I expected; I only took one-tenth of the sword intent. Thank you all!"

Then, he flew away as if escaping, not daring to say another word. The two brothers looked at each other, realizing that this person truly did not want to get involved in worldly affairs and had only spoken more because he had a request.

One brother held the sword, and the other carried the jade box. They returned to the small courtyard on the mountain in the rain where the rest of the Li Family was already waiting.

Raindrops pattered down, and the courtyard was silent. On the smooth and simple table were several jade bottles, large and small, green and white, emanating spiritual qi. On the other end, there were five or six lonely jade bottles.

"Roughly, this is the situation..."

Li Yuanjiao explained the series of events in a low voice, "Currently, about seventy percent of the pills in the market come from the Azure Pond Sect, while only twenty to thirty percent come from the Xiao and Yuan Families. Now, consider carefully how we should handle this."

All the direct descendants of the Li Family were present. Li Qinghong stood silently to the side, holding her spear, while Li Yuanping bowed his head in thought. The younger generation, seated on the lower end, had varied expressions.

Seeing that Li Yuanping and Li Qinghong remained silent, Li Yuanjiao turned his gaze to the eldest, Li Xicheng, indicating for him to speak.

Li Xicheng, who had been lost in thought, quickly straightened up. After thinking for a moment, he said slowly, "In my opinion, these pills—though precious—are made from human lives... Our family has always upheld strict family traditions and prioritized nurturing the people. It is best to abandon these pills..."

Li Xicheng, who had gained experience managing affairs in Mount Yue, could articulate better now. He clearly suggested that the pills should no longer be used. Li Yuanjiao nodded and looked at Li Xijun.

Dressed in a white robe with silver edges, Li Xijun appeared more handsome. He said respectfully, "In my opinion, since our family will no longer use these pills, we should sell them in the market at slightly lower prices to convert them into Spirit Stones, quickly replenishing our family's resources while creating some buzz. Then, we should establish connections with the Xiao and Yuan Families to ensure future pill supplies come exclusively from them, avoiding the market."

"Excellent!"

Li Xijun, within a few dozen seconds, had provided a complete strategy that made Li Yuanjiao's eyes light up in both joy and pride.

Finally, Li Ximing spoke softly, "I have not yet broken through to the Jade Capital Stage and cannot focus solely on refining pills. We'll have to rely on the Xiao and Yuan Families for several years... Eighth brother's strategy is thorough, but I have one concern about these pills."

Li Ximing paused for a moment, then continued, "Pills made from blood qi, as rumored, are created using Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace techniques that produce a higher quantity and quality of pills... Are there no side effects or hidden dangers? Perhaps the harm is far greater than people know..."

His words made the three elders raise their eyebrows. Having read alchemy books, Li Ximing understood the risks better than the others. He continued, "My point is, even if we disregard the connection to human lives, we should not consume these pills. Who knows what risks they carry? The pills from the clans might not be as sought after as those from the Azure Pond Sect, but they are easier to acquire... so why not?"

"Indeed."

The three elders exchanged glances, and Li Yuanping smiled as he said, "You may all leave now."

After the younger generation had left and the courtyard gate closed with an isolating formation, Li Yuanping remarked, "The younger ones have truly grown."

Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly and said, "Xicheng, although lacking substance, has become less unsophisticated and is willing to learn and improve, which is good... But Xijun is a practical one."

Li Xijun's complete strategy delighted the three elders. Li Qinghong, holding the Duruo Spear, appeared more relaxed and said gently, "Ximing is thoughtful, Xijun is strategic. It is thanks to your teaching, Brother Ping!"

Li Yuanjiao began to put away the pills on the table, contemplating on how to acquire the right connections with the Xiao Family without indebting them. He thought of seeking help from Xiao Yuansi and said with a smile, "Our family has taught through personal examples and historical lessons for three generations while maintaining strict traditions, which is why we have such outstanding descendants."

With the Profound Light of the mirror enhancing their spirits and the encouragement from the younger generation, the three elders felt much relieved. Li Yuanjiao exhaled deeply, picked up the jade box on the table, and, with a slightly lighter tone, said, "This spirit root, the Wanglin Blossom, is at least at the Foundation Establishment Realm... It needs to be watered with a spirit spring. We have one on Mount Huaqian that can be used."

The spirit spring on Mount Huaqian had a long history. Even during the Wan Family's time, the formation genius Wan Huaqian had used this spring to construct formations. Now, in the hands of the Li Family, the spring was primarily used to water spirit plants, hoping to save a few years' worth of growth and help alleviate the family's annual deficit.

"According to Wang Xun, this Wanglin Blossom cannot be stored in gold or jade. When it blooms, we should pick the flowers with wooden chopsticks and store them in a bamboo box," Li Yuanjiao explained.

"This flower cannot hear crying. If it hears crying, it will wither, so be mindful of that!" he reminded.

Li Qinghong nodded solemnly, taking the responsibility seriously. "I will guard Mount Huaqian for the next few years and watch over this spirit root," she said confidently.

"How are the two matters we discussed previously progressing?" Li Yuanjiao suddenly inquired.

Li Yuanping quickly responded, "The situation in Mount Yue is becoming more stable, and the Tian Family is cooperating well. It seems about time... Those fat Mount Yue nobles were like sheep ready for slaughter. They sided with us at the right time back then, so we did not touch them. Now, they are getting more arrogant and even starting to encroach on our spirit resources... We should kill a few to strengthen our family."

Li Qinghong, not being adept at household management and political maneuvers, frowned and asked, "Why not kill them all and send our own people to Mount Yue? Why keep a bunch of mountain pigs around?"

"Dear sister," Li Yuanping chuckled softly as he explained patiently, "If we send our own people, they would still be corrupt, and we will have to waste manpower to supervise them. If the branch families gain benefits, they might unite, making it harder to deal with them."

"Oh," Li Qinghong responded, frowning. Her clear voice then added, "I just returned to the mountain and noticed that the branch families down there do nothing but marry wives, take concubines, play games like pot-throwing, and keep dogs for racing... That does not seem right."

Li Yuanping nodded and continued, "You are right. These guys are indeed useless, hiding their corruption and shame, secretly occupying people's land, and exploiting them. Some even collude with merchants for power and wealth!"

"In the past, when there were fewer of them, the Clan Affairs Courtyard could suppress them. But now, with the family struggling and more relatives joining, our cultivators need to focus on nurturing spirit plants. We cannot waste time on them. And that brings me to my second matter..."

He then poured tea for Li Yuanjiao and continued with a smile, "Brother, regarding the issue you mentioned, I have found an opportunity. We need to look into the families on the eastern shore."

Taking out a gray map from the table, he explained, "To our north are Mount Huazhong and Mount Yuting, bordering the Yu Family. To the east of Mount Yuting are the families on the eastern shore... Among our neighbors are two families, one surnamed Rui and the other Pu."

"These two families only have cultivators in the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Their ancestors were enlightened by the Xiao Family and occupied small mountains. They united with nearby families to mine the local spirit ores for the Xiao Family." Li Yuanping paused and explained further, "Do you remember the Ding Family?"

"Of course," Li Qinghong replied, sipping her tea, "The Yuan Family's vassals and a small buffer household between the three families."

"Correct." Li Yuanping nodded and continued, "The Ding Family has several Qi Cultivators, including Ding Xiding in the late stage. These two families used to pay tribute to the Ding Family. After our ancestor broke through to Foundation Establishment Realm, Ding Xiding was so frightened that he came to pay his respects and abandoned these two families near our border. Without their tribute, these two families sent us gifts a few times. Seeing no response from us, they have become free and content, even attacking and plundering mortals."

"Plundering mortals...?" Li Yuanjiao asked, sensing something ominous.

Li Yuanping, having thoroughly investigated the matter, replied in a low voice, "I found it strange too, so I sent people to inquire. It turns out the Xiao Family only wants the spirit jade ore and does not require tribute, but the Ding and Yu families do. Hence, the eastern shore families have always been short of labor. Mortals, not needing spiritual energy but producing a lot of output, became their only option..."

When Li Yuanping spoke to this point, everything became clear. After all, it was the territory of the devil gates, and Li Yuanjiao had heard of such things before. Similar transactions involving rogue cultivators were also carried out by the Yu Family, and he had become somewhat accustomed to it. He merely nodded silently.

"I intend to intervene in the lands of the eastern shore families, supporting one or two small households in the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realms. This will be an opportunity to conscript over two thousand people from the branch families, specifically selecting those who are idle and frivolous."

Li Yuanping continued to outline his plans in great detail.

Li Yuanjiao nodded in realization, his narrow eyes showing satisfaction. Li Yuanping's gray-black eyes, rounder than Li Yuanjiao's and similar to Li Qinghong's, also reflected cunningness and intelligence.

"I will deliberately have Xicheng lead these troops. Xicheng is kind-hearted and gentle, reluctant to scold or shout. This group of frivolous men is already unreliable. Once they cross the borders into another family's territory, it is unlikely they will be able to restrain themselves from revealing their true nature..."

After saying this, Li Yuanping took a sip of tea and continued softly, "At that time, we will kill some, punish some, and release some. Who among the clan elders would dare voice opposition to such severe crimes? After this campaign, we can ensure at least forty years of clean governance!"

————

Beneath Yi Mountain City

Drip, drip.

Being close to the southern border, Yi Mountain City received ample rainfall. The heavy rain fell, mixing with the blood on the ground, turning the mud into a grayish-red slurry.

A youth with gray-black eyes stared at the city walls. His clothes were tattered, soaked with mud and water, and he stank terribly. Blending in with the other slave soldiers, he was indistinguishable.

"Another hour, and I can leave the city..."

Using his metallic essence to create a rift, Jiang Boqing had sent Jiang Yan to Yi Mountain City in one breath. The old man was in terrible shape, nearly draining Jiang Yan of all his energy to fuel the transport. This extreme exertion nearly depleted Jiang Yan's cultivation, leaving him barely able to recover.

Jiang Yan landed in a slave camp within the city, lying on a corpse where he lay stiffly for a while before slowly recovering. He looked up to see a vast white formation covering the sky, recognizing it as the first city of Jiangnan.

Despite his endless confusion, there was no time to ponder. Barefoot and disoriented, he sat in the camp, his heart full of confusion.

He deceived my father, killed my mother... all to refine the two shamanic talismans in my body... Why does it end like this?!

With Jiang Boqing dead, Jiang Yan felt both sorrow and bewilderment, not daring to think too much. He only knew that if he stayed here, he would be discovered sooner or later.

The great formation in Yi Mountain City was established by an immortal sect and was impossible to break through by force. Jiang Yan had to disguise himself as a slave soldier, waiting in the camp for half a month before encountering a demon beast raid.

"How laughable."

Jiang Yan's gaze swept over the emaciated commoners, immediately discerning the devil gate's intention. Coldly, he thought to himself, This is not defense... it's merely feeding the beasts!

Clang!

The tunnel entrance barely opened, revealing an array formation above him. The mind-bewildering formation activated, driving the commoners to madness as they rushed out.

"Ahhhh..."

Jiang Yan mingled with the crowd, only to face the gaping maw of a wolf demon. Its sharp white teeth glinted menacingly as the crazed commoners hurled themselves at it, resulting in a spray of blood and flying debris.

He took a detour, unable to fly now, and had no choice but to sprint. Unexpectedly, the demon seemed to find him interesting, turning to chase after him.

"Damn it!"

Though injured, Jiang Yan was not someone a mere low-level demon could bully. With a simple slap, he had sent the wolf demon staggering. He then flew low to the ground, escaping southward in a sorry state.

Atop Yi Mountain City.

Liu Changdie had already gone down to maintain the grand formation. Li Xuanfeng stood with his bow while Fei Yihe stood silently beside him, watching the approaching beast horde.

The other cultivators either held bows or spears, concentrating and imbuing their weapons with mana which caused them to glow mystically.

These cultivators, lacking any family heritage, either trained in swordsmanship or spear techniques, only developing sword or spear aura to attach to their weapons. Longer reach meant greater strength, so naturally, they chose spears to increase their chances of survival.

At most, they only managed to cultivate sword or spear qi. The latter had a wider range than sword qi, providing them with better chances of survival. Thus, except for a few disciples from prominent clans, most wielded spears.

They stood ready, and behind them were several green-robed cultivators, mostly at the mid to late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, standing with their hands behind their backs. All of them were disciples of Azure Pond Sect, overseeing the formation.

Screech!

A distant eagle cried, but it did not dare to approach. On the ground lay several corpses being devoured, likely the result of Li Xuanfeng's archery which had killed several creatures, deterring the rest from advancing.

After a while, a dozen or so demon beasts gathered together and finally mustered the courage to charge toward the city walls in a swarm.

"They are coming!"

Li Xuanfeng drew his bow, and the other cultivators quickly adjusted their formation to protect him at the center. They wielded spears and cast spells to fend off the attacking beasts. Black demonic arts clashed with the cultivators' spells, creating a cacophony of explosions.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

In just a few breaths, golden beams shot out from Li Xuanfeng's bow, each one seemingly sentient, seeking out the beasts' eyes, noses, and mouths with terrifying accuracy. Blood splattered everywhere and fur flew everywhere, prompting the disciples of the Azure Pond Sect to nod approvingly.

One of them whispered to the person beside him, "Senior Brother... without this man, these cultivators would not have lasted this long."

The person in front, who seemed to hold a high position, remained silent, his expression grave as he slowly furrowed his brow.

"Is that... a slave soldier?"

His gaze was fixed on the battlefield below, where amidst the bloody chaos, a slave soldier had slapped a wolf demon away and was fleeing at an incredible speed.

Surrounding demons quickly converged on him, making him highly conspicuous. Realizing he had been exposed, the slave soldier decided to fly, shooting like a meteor toward a distant forest.

The leading Azure Pond Sect disciple sneered, forming a golden beam of light in his hand, ready to release it. However, the disciple who had spoken earlier chuckled, "Senior Brother... why use a sledgehammer to crack a nut?"

He waved his sleeve and turned to the person below, smiling brightly as he said, "That Li Family archer, shoot that thing down."

The green-robed cultivator, with a shifty and sleazy appearance, boldly stepped forward. At his words, several Azure Pond Sect disciples turned their gazes toward Li Xuanfeng, who frowned slightly but had no choice but to nock an arrow and draw his bow.

These cultivators were mostly disciples of Yuanwu Peak, known for their condescending behavior toward Li Xuanfeng's group. Fei Yihe and the other cultivators, always submissive, looked nervously at Li Xuanfeng.

Thwang...

Li Xuanfeng remained silent, raising his golden longbow. With a deep breath, he drew the bowstring, gathering dazzling golden light that formed a radiant white arrow.

His eyes mirrored the tattered figure in the distance, the longbow in his hand exuding lethal sharpness. The slave soldier, sensing imminent danger, paused mid-air and turned to look back.

Cultivators possess extraordinary eyesight. Their gazes locked across a hundred chi, and Li Xuanfeng saw a pair of eyes brimming with resentment. A wave of familiarity washed over him as his heart stirred, and his grip on the bowstring slackened.

The arrow radiated light, streaking across the sky like a meteor, and in an instant, it pierced through the slave soldier's back. The slave soldier fell, twisting and turning like a bird with broken wings.

The green-clad cultivator laughed heartily, watching the brilliant trail of the golden-white arrow streak across the sky. He exclaimed, "Nice shot! That arrow is fast!"

He had a cunning and rat-like appearance that cheapened the elegant green robe he wore. He held his belly as he laughed, drawing glances from others. The higher-ranking man, handsome with a high nose bridge, glanced disdainfully at him and said coldly, "He's not dead."

Fei Yihe, who had been waiting for a while, quickly smiled obsequiously and said, "Exalted Immortal, you might not know, but my brother's archery is unique! Once hit, the target will have astral qi attached to them and be reduced into a blood puddle within three quarters of an hour."

The tall leader of the Azure Pond Sect disciples, towering over Fei Yihe, stared at his face for a moment before suddenly swinging his sleeve.

Smack!

The slap sent Fei Yihe stumbling back instantly, and he clutched his face and repeatedly apologized. The tall leader then turned abruptly, full of rage, and kicked the crouching rat-faced man.

Thud.

Caught off guard, the rat-faced man was sent flying, rolling a good ten zhang away on the ground and ending up in a mess.

"Senior Brother!"

The sudden kick shocked the other disciples of the Azure Pond Sect while the clan cultivators exchanged confused glances with each other, unsure why the sect disciples were fighting among themselves. They all lowered their heads, not daring to speak.

"Senior Brother! Please, no!"

The disciples quickly came to mediate the situation. The rat-faced man, seemingly oblivious to this, dusted off his robe and said cheerfully, "Senior Brother Ning's kick is precise... just like the ancestor's style."

Senior Brother Ning, towering and fierce, stepped forward, overshadowing the rat-faced man. Grabbing his collar, he pulled him close and gritted his teeth as he threatened menacingly, "Deng Yuzhi... you better really be an idiotic troublemaker, genuinely affected by your cultivation technique! Stay this way for life, or I will show you the methods of the Yuanxing Peak if I catch you slipping!"

With that, he threw Deng Yuzhi to the ground, shook his robe, and let out a loud command.

"Let's go!"

As he walked away, his jade boots embroidered with gold threads shimmered in the light.

Senior Brother Ning looked noble and imposing. At his command, none of the Azure Pond Sect disciples dared to speak for Deng Yuzhi. They silently bowed their heads and followed him, flying back toward the city.

Deng Yuzhi lay on the ground, now covered in dust, his hair disheveled, looking utterly miserable. Everyone else pretended not to see him, hurrying to face the enemy.

"What a temper..."

Deng Yuzhi got up unhurriedly, cast a spell to dust himself off, and muttered a string of complaints. He glanced at Li Xuanfeng, who was holding his bow in contemplation, and cursed, "Useless! Such a reputation but no substance! Are you not afraid of causing trouble?!"

He then turned and leaped toward the city, leaving everyone else exchanging bewildered glances.

"Those words... seemed to have another meaning."

Li Xuanfeng watched Deng Yuzhi's departing figure and thought to himself, I seem to have seen this person before. He had a long conversation with our ancestor during the recruitment... Perhaps what just happened involves a lot of internal conflicts within the Azure Pond Sect...

He withdrew his gaze, the look in the youth's eyes as he turned back replaying in his mind. Stroking his bow, he thought to himself silently, My shot was just for show, not truly lethal. The enemy of the Azure Pond Sect is our friend... It cannot possibly hurt to save a favor.

Li Xuanfeng, now at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, had far surpassed the young Azure Pond Sect disciples in cultivation. He had yet to meet his match, especially in archery, so he naturally could deceive this group of disciples.

He slung his longbow over his back and looked at the retreating beast tide. Turning to Fei Yihe, he asked, "How are you?"

"I'm fine!" Fei Yihe quickly responded with a dismissive wave. After all, he had taken an unnecessary slap, but he had already wiped away the blood at the corner of his mouth and the red mark on his face was gradually fading.

He replied gently, "For someone in our position, taking a slap is nothing. No harm done!"

————

Eastern Mount Yue.

The grand hall of Mulu Town was resplendent with gold and jade. The dim lights flickered on the walls, casting dark shadows that leaped like demons and monsters.

Tian Zhongqing carefully put away the wooden slips in his hand. A servant rushed in and respectfully reported, "Master! The lords have once again submitted a petition to support Li Jiman's ascension... They say the agreed date is approaching and it cannot be delayed further!"

"Bring it here."

Tian Zhongqing sighed, took the petition from the servant, and began marking it with his brush.

Tian Zhongqing was temporarily in charge of matters in the Eastern Mount Yue. The dark red color used for official documents was a recent change, as they were marked with vermillion previously.

Since the main Li Family used vermillion for their official documents, the Clan Affairs Courtyard used a slightly darker shade to signify their subordinate status. Shamoli, hearing this, had his annotations changed to an even darker red—a tradition that continued to this day.

"Tell them to revise these inappropriate phrases and resubmit in a few days!"

Finding an excuse to dismiss them, Tian Zhongqing felt a chill run down his spine.

"It is not me holding you back... It is the will of the main family... How can we let Li Jiman ascend without eliminating a batch of wastrels first?"

He sighed inwardly, gazing at the grand hall. The opulent decorations gleamed gold, tempting his senses. He had been acting as the temporary ruler for over half a year and was almost becoming fond of this high position.

The flickering lights in the inner hall bathed the jade and gold artifacts in a soft and comforting glow. This grand hall was once the palace of Mu Jiaoman, so it was magnificently built. When it passed to Qimu, much of the extravagance was reduced.

Later, Li Feiruo launched a coup, and the Li Family's carriage entered the palace, staining the palace steps with blood as the peers slaughtered the royal family to curry favor with the Li Family.

"The wheel of fortune turns... Soon, the blood of these wastrels will be spilled..."

Dazed by the sight of the golden red, Tian Zhongqing was jolted awake, shaking off those thoughts hurriedly. Suddenly, he heard a clang from outside the hall as a burly man entered.

The man, eight chi tall with thick eyebrows and a robust build, held a giant mace in his hand. He looked like a bandit ready to crush Tian Zhongqing with his weapon.

Tian Zhongqing quickly jumped down from his seat and hurried to greet him with a smile, "Brother Wen! What brings you here? Is the family head here too?"

"Uncle Tian, you have misunderstood."

Despite his fierce appearance, Li Wen had a gentle disposition and replied in a low voice, "The Jade Court Guards have already been deployed throughout the city. The family head said it is time to close the net, so he sent me to oversee things."

"Good, good, good!" Tian Zhongqing laughed obsequiously and asked, "Brother Wen, does the family head have any other instructions?"

Li Wen nodded and replied, "The family head has agreed. If this matter is resolved, the Tian Family's descendants can return to the twelve towns."

"That's great!" Tian Zhongqing responded, clearly overjoyed. Ever since the Tian Family was sent to Eastern Mount Yue to control the situation, they had been increasingly looked down upon by the people of the East, who saw them as allies of Mount Yue. This disdain was particularly hard to bear in a society that revered the East.

In the Eastern Mount Yue, the Tian Family had a high status, but in Lijing Town, they were treated as inferiors. Despite having two Qi Cultivators, they lacked the backing of the main family and were often looked down upon in secret.

His eldest son had once gone to Lijing Town and, not knowing the local drinking games, was mocked and came back depressed for three months, causing Tian Zhongqing to sigh deeply.

Moreover, being far from the main family in the Eastern Mount Yue, and being the most powerful among the external families, Tian Zhongqing felt like he was walking on a tightrope every day, constantly on edge.

Now, with Li Yuanping's promise, he was overjoyed. All the frustrations of offending Li Jiman and the lords by acting as Li's enforcer dissipated. He thought coldly to himself, I was worried about how to establish myself in Eastern Mount Yue, but now… let's kill! Let heads roll. I'll just wipe my hands clean and leave! Who cares about a few local tyrants?

He immediately gave the order, and the soldiers in the palace began to move. The clanging of weapons resounded, and the palace gates swung open. Carriages and horses drove out right away, riding on the newly built roads.

Rumble…

The noise echoed like thunder between the streets, waking the residents of Mount Yue from their sleep, leaving them bewildered and unsure of what was happening.

————

In another corner of Mulu Town, there was a lively banquet with songs and laughter. Li Jiman sat at the head of the table with a sour expression, watching the lords sing loudly, feeling frustrated.

"Barbarians... What rubbish is this?"

There was no drinking game, pitch-pot, or poetry competition; all the tricks Li Jiman had learned were useless here. They just sang songs and gulped down wine, making him very uncomfortable.

As he was lost in his thoughts, a drunken lord staggered up to him, grinning and slurring, "Great King… do you not think Li Yuanping always looks so pale, as if he is at death's door? Does that not suggest a change might be coming?"

Li Jiman's expression changed abruptly. He was familiar with the main family and often took pride in it. He was also deeply grateful to Li Yuanping for sparing him and held him in the highest respect. How could he possibly tolerate such talk?

Moreover, he vividly remembered how the Tian Family had exploited him. Fear and anger surged within him all of a sudden.

"Hmph!"

Li Jiman threw his cup at the man's face, smashing it and causing him to fall with a thud, blood streaming down his face. Li Jiman cursed, "You scoundrel!"

The hall fell silent. Li Jiman quickly stood up, as if explaining to someone, and shouted, "That is the majesty of a tiger feigning illness, an eagle seeming to sleep! How could lowly people like you understand?!"

As soon as he had finished speaking, everyone fell to their knees. Even the music stopped, and the hall became so silent one could almost hear a pin drop. Li Jiman strained his ears and felt a chill run down his spine instantly.

"Why do I hear the sound of weapons clashing...?"

As he spoke, the people below looked at each other in confusion. Suddenly, a scream pierced through the air.

BANG!

A group of soldiers in white armor burst through the door, wielding weapons with stern expressions. They filed in, ignoring the lords' protests. Some even jumped up, shouting, "Who are you? Do you know where you are?! How dare you act so brazenly here?!"

However, the white-armored soldiers ignored the demands of the lords and simply continued barging through the crowd. Those with cultivation tried to resist but were quickly subdued by the leader. Watching his allies being taken away, Li Jiman stood in shock, unable to believe what was happening.

"Jade Court Guards..?" he murmured in disbelief.

The hall was filled with the sounds of subdued grunts and pleas for mercy. Before Li Jiman could ask further questions, the captives were already being marched out. He stood there, dumbfounded, suddenly left all alone.

The leader of the Jade Court Guards showed a bit of courtesy, lightly cupping his fist in salute.

"Apologies, young master."

"This is..." Li Jiman stammered, feeling as if he had been stripped of everything he owned in broad daylight, taking several moments to find his words.

The leader of the Jade Court Guards respectfully cupped his fist again, his eyes bright as he gestured for his men to withdraw, leaving only two behind. Only then did he explain, "Young master, the Tian Family submitted a cartload of evidence to the Clan Affairs Courtyard, and it implicated many clans in Mount Yue. I am here under orders to arrest them."

"The Tian Family?!"

Li Jiman snapped to attention right away, realizing why the main family had suddenly become so ruthless. His eyes reddened, and he ground his teeth in anger.

"It seems the Tian Family has been plotting this for years, planning to wipe out my followers and turn me into a puppet!" he fumed.

"With the Tian Family controlling Mount Yue unchallenged by the lords, they will become a major threat! This must not happen, Family Head!" he yelled.

Li Jiman, grabbing his robe, hurried closer. The Jade Court Guard, noting his urgency, hesitated and then whispered, "This is indeed an extreme measure. Brother, perhaps you should plead with the family head directly. It is said he intends to recall the Tian Family, but they have persistently refused, spreading slander to remain in Mount Yue."

"Ah! Thank you, brother!" Li Jiman exclaimed, hearing this for the first time. Elated, his face flushed with excitement as he resolved, "Yes… if the Tian Family leaves Mount Yue and returns to the towns, everything will be resolved! I must persuade the family head to make them withdraw!"

Having studied governance for over a decade, he was determined not to be a mere puppet. He hurriedly put on his shoes, ready to rush out of the hall.

The Jade Court Guard, seeing his urgency, hesitated before offering a final piece of advice, "Brother, I have heard the family head has long been troubled by the lack of spirit resources from Mount Yue… He has sent us to investigate many times. If you have any insights, this could be a way to appeal to him!"

Li Jiman's eyes lit up instantly at this timely information. Nodding vigorously, he rushed out but then stopped and turned back.

"Brother, you have helped me greatly today… May I know your name?"

The Jade Court Guard chuckled and replied, "I am Chen Mufeng, I just returned from the market a few days ago. I will need your support in the future, young master."

"Chen Mufeng…" Li Jiman repeated the name, committing it to memory. He thanked Chen Mufeng quickly before rushing out.




# Chapter 378: Black Robe

Watching Li Jiman hurry out of the hall, Chen Mufeng's gaze swept across the remnants of melons and fruit as well as the gold and jade cups. He stepped forward, his eyes fixed on the highest seat at the end of the hall.

"The King of Mount Yue is nothing but a puppet," he murmured to himself while he subconsciously stepped up to the platform. He placed his slender hand on the seat with intricate engravings in silence.

The Chen Family had always been exceptionally talented. Chen Mufeng, now at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, surpassed all but those from the main family. He took great pride in this achievement.

"The main family's bloodline is undoubtedly noble, so I can't possibly compare to them. But Tian Zhongqing and Xu Gongming are just a few years older than me... Who among them can match my talents and background?"

He was young and at the peak of his ambition. His heart was brimming with boundless dreams, and he could only fix his gaze on the seat of power.

Lost in thought, Chen Mufeng was staring at the chair when a group of white-armored cultivators suddenly parted the curtain and entered.

One of them respectfully greeted, "Young Master, the preparations are done. Your orders...?"

Chen Mufeng quickly retracted his hand from the chair as though he had been electrocuted by it. He cleared his throat and responded quickly.

"Let's go then."

————

Meanwhile in Lijing Town…

Li Yuanping, dressed in brocade, was meticulously writing with a vermillion brush, and a stack of wooden slips was neatly arranged on his desk. He glanced up as Li Wen approached quickly and solemnly kneeled before him before reporting, "Family Head, the Jade Court Guards have seized control of Mount Yue… Li Jiman has traveled without rest and arrived in the town."

Li Yuanping hummed in response, stroking his chin in silent contemplation. Li Wen got up and stood guard below the platform. Shortly after, a commotion of footsteps heralded the arrival of a man bursting into the hall.

This man, with a slightly tanned complexion, clutched the hem of his lavish robe. He stepped forward and fell to his knees abruptly.

"Family Head, the Tian Family harbors great ambitions—they aim to monopolize Mount Yue and use it as their stronghold. If we yield it to them, I fear it could lead to significant troubles!" the man lamented.

"Jiman..?"

Li Yuanping frowned slightly and continued with displeasure in his voice, "The Tian Family are close relatives and loyal to the core... How can you say such a thing?!"

He looked slightly upset and pushed over the small pile of wooden slips on his desk. They fell on the ground with a loud clatter, tumbling right down in front of Li Jiman.

"The evidence of crimes committed by those on Mount Yue is here—witnesses and exhibits for each charge! What do you have to say about this then?" he asked coldly.

These incriminating pieces, diligently collected by the Clan Affairs Courtyard, were undeniable, but they were submitted in the name of the Tian Family. Although Li Jiman did not know this, he was aware of these prominent families' nature and did not dare examine the documents.

"Family Head! Although the Mount Yue tribes are violent and tyrannical, they serve as a crucial counterbalance to the Tian Family. If eradicated, the Tian Family will dominate, and the Mount Yue State will be at their mercy…. They could also breed disaster!" he pleaded.

"I've studied history! The Jiang Family of Moongaze Lake once depended on external families, which eventually led to their division into various factions and was overtaken by the Yu Family! This is a very important lesson to learn from..." he continued.

Li Yuanping looked at him silently, a little swayed.

"What do you suggest we do?" he asked.

"Family Head... please recall the Tian Family!" Li Jiman said in an outburst as he remained kneeling, his face flushed with urgency.

Li Yuanping let out a soft sigh, scanned the room, and commanded the two rows of guards, "You're all dismissed!"

As the room cleared in an orderly fashion, Li Yuanping let out another long sigh. He quickly descended the platform, helped Li Jiman to his feet, and spoke warmly.

"Jiman, what are you doing? You are a member of my Li Family; the Tian Family cannot compare to us!"

For a moment, Li Jiman was too stunned to respond, but then he heard Li Yuanping continue, "I'm aware that the Tian Family has deep roots in Mount Yue, and is restricting your freedom to act."

"But the tribes of Mount Yue are tyrannical, greedy, and vicious. If we don't remove them, how can Mount Yue ever fall into your hands?" he asked.

Li Jiman's expression was frozen for a long while before it finally gave way to a spark of realization.

"I see… I was far too incompetent to understand Family Head's foresight!" he exclaimed.
𝐟𝐫𝕖𝗲𝘄𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝕧𝐞𝚕.𝕔𝕠𝐦

Li Yuanping sighed and took his hand, leading him up to the platform while speaking earnestly.

"The Tian Family, while well-connected within the clan, is innocent of any wrongdoing. If we don't sacrifice the Mount Yue tribes, we have no valid reason to transfer them," he explained.

Li Jiman nodded vigorously, then saw Li Yuanping smile.

"I have already issued the decree to transfer the Tian Family. Once this night passes, the wolves will perish, the tigers will migrate, and Mount Yue will be cleared from top to bottom. The honor of restoring it will be yours!"

Li Jiman was deeply moved, whispering softly and guiltily, "Family Head! You've planned everything for my benefit, yet I scarcely realized... I am truly ashamed!"

Li Yuanping shook his head and said, "I will place part of our family's cultivators under your command. You have studied the art of governance for over a decade. Raise the poor families, redistribute the land, protect the spirit fields, elevate the upper class... I'm sure you don't need further guidance from me, right?"

Confident and excited, Li Jiman quickly replied, "Yes! It's better to put those who are to be punished to good use by having them tend to the fields. Give me some time to train the cultivators. In less than five years, Mount Yue's productivity could increase by more than thirty percent!"

Delighted by Li Jiman's response, Li Yuanping offered a few words of encouragement. Li Jiman expressed his profound gratitude and departed, his head held high—a stark contrast to his earlier subdued arrival.

As he disappeared outside the hall, the smile on Li Yuanping's face slowly faded. Leaning back, he held his forehead with one hand and picked up his brush, lost in deep thought.

"Li Jiman is a clever man. The Tian Family's initiative was too abrupt, and the action to eradicate the other tribes was overly decisive… Sooner or later, he'll suspect me. Better to speak out first, dispel his doubts, and in doing so, also curry favor..." he mumbled to himself.

He gently set the brush aside and coughed a few times before noticing a person approaching. Clad in jade armor, the figure appeared steadfast and honest.

Kneeling on one knee, he reported in a deep voice, "Family Head, of the thirteen Mount Yue clans, two have been eradicated for their crimes. Nine are under custody, and the remaining two have been found innocent."

Li Yuanping nodded, appreciating the fact that the Mount Yue clans still knew how to moderate themselves which allowed two families to survive. He glanced toward the back where large chests and wooden boxes were stored and asked, "How is the harvest?"

Chen Mufeng listed several spirit items before replying, "The total value is thirty-five Spirit Stones, all accounted for here."

Li Yuanping instructed him to dispatch the items, and amidst a bout of coughing, he thought to himself, Once the guest cultivators are escorted to Cloud Crowned Peak, the family's finances will see improvements. The Wanling Blossom might bloom in a few more years, and things might get better."

A gentle, chilly breeze swept through Cloud Crowned Peak Market, causing the pole in front of the door to sway. A black and red flag emblazoned with the character "Li" fluttered conspicuously in the wind.

The dark threshold was marred by more than a dozen footprints, lending it a distinctly worn appearance. A middle-aged man, slouched over, sat silently on the threshold with his chin in his hand, watching the world pass by.

A cultivator clad in gray paused briefly before him and asked, "Brother Yun, do you still have any pills in stock?"

A few days ago, the Li Family store had released over a dozen bottles of high-quality pills at a reasonable price, attracting a large crowd and selling out in less than a day. As a result, passing cultivators frequently inquired about them.

Li Yuanyun looked up and drawled, "Already sold out long ago."

The man waved his sleeve and walked away, muttering something to himself.

Li Yuanyun knew this person well—a regular Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator at the market.

Since he was not highly skilled, he could not afford to provoke the Li Family. Despite being a mortal, Li Yuanyun still belonged to the main family's lineage, which usually earned him some respect. As a result, he was bold enough to show his bad mood in the cultivator's presence openly.

After the cultivator left, Li Yuanyun continued to sit on the threshold with a somber expression. Now in his thirties and showing his age, he now appeared even older since the death of his father, Li Xuanling.

"A direct descendant, yet relegated to such menial tasks..." he muttered bitterly.

Li Yuanyun once held a great appreciation for the clan rules that governed his fellow clan members. Now that these rules were directly applied to him, he no longer felt the same way about them. He sat silently, staring at the passersby, feeling utterly at a loss.

After a while, a black-robed cultivator stopped in front of him, causing the wind chimes at the door to tinkle softly. Recognizing the signs of a Qi Cultivator, Li Yuanyun quickly straightened up and respectfully invited the man, "Senior, please come inside!"

"Hm." the cultivator grunted hoarsely. His bamboo hat obscured his face and his voice was deep and raw.

Li Yuanyun could not help but look up, but at the cultivator's dismissive snort, he quickly lowered his head again and followed him inside. From a corner, Li Qiuyang hastily looked up and greeted the visitor with a respectful smile, "Senior seems unfamiliar... May I ask what brings you here today?"

When Li Yuanyun heard the tone in Li Qiuyang's voice, he could tell that the man was likely at the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, perhaps even at the peak. Li Yuanyun stepped backward discreetly.

The black-robed cultivator nodded slowly, his gaze fixed on Yuanyun for a moment before surveying the room, appraising the merchandise. He was dressed in an unusual attire, his face obscured by a black veil.

"Take a look at this."

With a flick of his fingers, he sent a dark jade pearl flying toward Li Qiuyang, who caught it and inspected it closely.

The pearl was about the size of a fist. As Li Qiuyang held it, a slight tingling sensation passed through his hand. The object was rather heavy and opaque, revealing nothing of its contents.

Li Qiuyang scrutinized the pearl for a bit but could discern no details. He extended his spiritual sense, probing the object briefly, then expressed his confusion.

"Senior, this is my first time seeing such a rare pearl. Our store doesn't usually accept spirit items though, and I hope you will forgive my ignorance... But is this a spirit item of the Qi Cultivation Realm?"

"Hahaha!" the black-robed cultivator laughed harshly, smacking his sword on the counter with a resonant clang that startled both Li Qiuyang and Li Yuanyun.

His voice raspy, he chided, "To run a family store with such a lack of knowledge about spirit items! Is this the standard of the Lijing's Li Family? Ridiculous!"

Qiuyang's expression darkened, anger flaring within him.

Looks like this guy is here to make trouble!

Despite knowing that the man came with ill intentions, he restrained himself and replied calmly, "Please, give me a moment, Senior. I'll consult the owner... He's very knowledgeable and will surely be able to identify this item."

With a respectful gesture, he handed the pearl back to the man.

The black-robed figure calmly put away the item before dismissing Li Qiuyang with a wave, arrogantly saying, "Get out of my sight."

Biting back his frustration, Qiuyang departed. The black-robed cultivator continued to eye the various leather and spirit items displayed around the shop, his murmurs filling the air.

Li Yuanyun cowered in a dark corner and watched silently, too fearful to speak.

Shortly after, Li Xuanxuan quickly descended from upstairs with a smile and said, "Forgive me for the lack of welcome! I am Li Xuanxuan, the owner of this modest establishment."

The cultivator glanced at him and placed the mysterious pearl on the counter, asking curtly, "Do you know what this is?"

Li Xuanxuan hurriedly took the jade pearl and carefully studied it. A sense of familiarity washed over him as if the memory was sparking within him.

"The size of a fist, a tingling sensation upon touch, heavy and black, devoid of light or color. I think I've read about this object before..." he murmured.

As he searched his memory, a shock ran through him like an electric jolt. His heart pounded as realization struck him.

"So this is the item..." he muttered quietly through gritted teeth.

This jade pearl had haunted Li Xuanxuan's dreams countless times, as vivid as if he had read its description repeatedly. In his dreams, he had tried to stop Li Pingyi time and again, only to wake up in agony, his grip crushing the edge of the bed...

Despite its harmless appearance, this object had claimed the life of his most cherished eldest son and plunged him into a life-long despair. Although he had never seen it before, he was able to recognize it right away.

"Hey, you!"

The raspy voice of the black-robed cultivator jolted him back to reality.

Covered in a cold sweat, Li Xuanxuan realized he had been standing frozen to the spot, a chill spreading through his body as he regained his senses.

He wiped his face with his sleeve, suppressing the urge to smash the pearl. With a forced smile, he gently placed it on the counter.

The cultivator found his reaction quite suspicious. He peered at Li Xuanxuan intently from beneath his bamboo hat, his gaze piercing as he repeated his question.

"So... do you know what this is?"

Li Xuanxuan straightened up, hesitating to speak as thoughts raced through his mind.

Why is this person here...? He seems to know what it is... What's going on?

What is the meaning of this? Who would dare to cause trouble in the Xiao Family's market?

He exhaled slowly before replying in a calm voice, "Truth be told, I don't recognize it..."

"Hmph!"

The cultivator smacked the counter and was about to react harshly, but paused when he saw Li Xuanxuan hesitate and open to speak once again.

"But..." Li Xuanxuan began.

"But what?!"

The tension was palpable as the cultivator's voice grew strained, his impatience clear.

"If I am not mistaken, this pearl holds a mysterious technique that could unleash both thunder and fire. It's likely an extremely powerful object."

"Oh?"

The black-robed cultivator appeared slightly surprised, pausing for a breath before his voice deepened with interest.

"You have keen eyesight..."

Adjusting the edge of his bamboo hat, he watched Li Xuanxuan with an amused expression.

Li Xuanxuan, noticing the small gesture, felt a growing sense of alarm and said in a low voice, "Of course, my family possesses a unique secret technique! Mastering this skill would allow one to discern spirit items easily."

"Tell me more."

The black-robed cultivator's eyes glinted with a hint of greed as he stared at Li Xuanxuan, who quickly responded, "Just a moment, Senior!"

He moved to close the door properly before quickly peering outside. As he expected, several nearby shops were embroiled in heated arguments with cultivators inside—each one at the late stage of Qi Cultivation. The confrontations had escalated, already turning physical, with two individuals vandalizing a nearby store.

With a chill in his heart but a smile on his face, he turned back to find the black-robed cultivator staring at him intently.

Li Xuanxuan hurriedly whispered, "Senior, you may not be aware, but my family has a superior perception technique known as Spirit Eye Perception. I would be willing to impart it to you discreetly for a fair price."

"I see!"

The black-robed cultivator was delighted. He knew that such a secret technique was hard to come by as they were usually only memorized within the family. He thought to himself, No matter the cost, I must acquire this technique first before I deal with these people... With only an unrefined Qi cultivator and an early-stage Qi Cultivator, they're as good as dead.




# Chapter 380: Chaos In Cloud Crowned Peak Market

Li Xuanxuan glanced at the man sideways, then seated himself before a desk. Stroking his beard, he said bluntly, "This secret technique is a rare perception technique... Three hundred Spirit Stones and it's yours, Daoist!"

This exorbitant price was clearly inflated, but knowing that he had to finish up soon and leave, the man in black was in no mood to haggle. He rudely snapped, "That's fine! Just hand over the technique... Don't waste my time!"

Seeing that the man was uninterested in bargaining, Li Xuanxuan agreed readily. With this, his suspicion that this cultivator harbored ill intentions increased from seventy to nearly ninety percent in certainty.

Smiling, he proposed, "Your generosity is impressive, Daoist. Let us proceed to the Xiao Residence to formalize this agreement and complete the transaction..."

The black-clad cultivator's demeanor shifted suddenly; his voice turned icy and he narrowed his eyes as he demanded, "What agreement?"

Li Xuanxuan feigned confusion and explained, "Is this your first visit, Senior? When it comes to transactions involving significant amounts, it's customary to involve the Xiao Family for validation and to draft a deed. This safeguards against any discrepancies, preventing any potential losses for you..."

The cultivator, clearly impatient, retorted gruffly, "There's no need for that! Just deliver the secret technique, and that will suffice!"

Li Xuanxuan nodded, still smiling, and reassured the man once more.

"Since you're ready to pay generously, I'll have my assistants fetch the deed from Xiao Residence. It won't be much trouble..."

He gave Li Qiuyang a meaningful look, and Li Qiuyang quickly exited the store. The cultivator in black grunted coldly and clapped his storage pouch, causing an array of dharma weapons to clatter out. An assortment of dharma weapons, each glowing faintly with mana, tumbled out with a clatter.

Among them were swords, axes, and halberds. Some were in poor condition, while others were fairly usable. All of these were smeared with dried blood that crumbled and scattered as they hit the floor.

"These dharma weapons are either of the Embryonic Breathing or Qi Cultivation Realm. Do they cover the cost?"

As his words hung in the air, dark brown dust drifted gently in the sunlight. Li Xuanxuan inhaled quietly and pretended to calculate, though thoughts were racing through his mind.

This man must be a devil cultivator from the north... The thought of such a group lurking here in the Cloud Crowned Peak Market is unsettling. That thunder pearl he carries is far too potent for use against someone of my low stature; it's likely intended to destroy the market's formation eye...

His gaze lingered on the assortment of dharma weapons, knowing deep down that there was no way he could save this store. At least he had already sent Li Qiuyang away; he trusted Qiuyang was sharp enough not to misinterpret his intentions.

"What's happening? What's wrong with you all?"

"Quiet! No fighting in the marketplace!"

The commotion outside grew louder, marked by the roar of mana collisions and the metallic clanging of dharma weapons. It seemed imminent that the group would soon make their move.

Li Xuanxuan's anxiety flared, and he softly said, "This doesn't come close to the agreed three hundred, Daoist!"

"Not enough?"

The black-robed cultivator, increasingly impatient, waved dismissively and reached again into his storage pouch.

Li Xuanxuan, feigning greed, sharply instructed Li Yuanyun who was lingering nearby, "You, get out of here!"

Li Yuanyun, along with a few apprentices of the store, quickly vacated the premises, easing Li Xuanxuan's worries somewhat.

He then called out, "Daoist, may I take another look at that exceptional item you showed earlier? I've been in this business for years, and it's the first time I've seen something so precious! Such a rare item could definitely fetch a handsome price!"

"Oh?"

The black-robed cultivator paused, then burst into hearty laughter as if he had just heard the funniest joke. Regaining his composure, he pulled the black jade pearl from his sleeve and chuckled.

"You have quite the eye! Here, take it!"

He tossed the Thunder Pearl toward Li Xuanxuan, who clumsily caught it. The cultivator then demanded coldly, "Now, hand over the secret technique!"

"Of course, immediately!"

Li Xuanxuan gazed at the precious pearl with a greedy glint in his eyes while retrieving a jade slip from the storage pouch at his waist and handing it over nonchalantly.

As the black-robed cultivator delved into the jade slip with his spiritual sense, Li Xuanxuan seized the opportunity to act. With a swift sweep of his sleeve, he sent the pile of dharma weapons scattering and cluttering loudly across the floor. Amidst the ensuing cacophony of clanging, he quickly burst through the door and made his escape.

"Huh?"

The cultivator surnamed Qiu was enraged upon realizing the jade slip contained nothing more than trivial travelogs and cultivation notes.

"Such audacity!" he cursed angrily.

Furious, he stamped his foot, causing a burst of white vapor to rise that rattled the building. He lunged at Li Xuanxuan, his palm wind transforming into clouds of white qi currents that surged toward his target.

Li Xuanxuan's expression darkened as he quickly activated the shimmering golden talisman that was already in his hand, unleashing a burst of golden light that enveloped him.

As a thick aura of blood-red light erupted, he retreated swiftly like the wind.

————

BOOM!

Li Xuanxuan's golden shield barely withstood a few breaths against the onslaught of the white qi currents before shattering like a fragile eggshell. He could not dodge in time, and part of the skin and flesh on his hand were scoured away, leaving a sight of his white bones exposed to view.

Gritting his teeth, he stifled a cry of pain, channeling all his mana to counter the black-robed cultivator's ferocious attack. He staggered back a few steps, then propelled himself into the air.

Li Xuanxuan had always sold the talismans he crafted for Spirit Stones to send home, neglecting to prepare anything of quality for himself. Feeling secure within the market, the talismans he retained were all only of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

The moment the shield was effortlessly shattered by a simple palm strike, he deeply regretted his lack of preparation.

"GAAAAAAAAHHHH!"

The apprentices, all mere cultivators in the Embryonic Breathing Realm, were caught completely off guard. One moment they were chatting idly outside the door, and the next, they were screaming in agony as white qi enveloped their bodies.

The upper torso of the apprentice closest to the door instantly evaporated, leaving only the lower half of his body behind—two stark, white thigh bones grotesquely standing on the floor.

The others met similarly gruesome fates: some were beheaded, while those who retained their heads managed only a few cries of despair before collapsing.

Li Yuanyun, who was watching the commotion on the street, was unaffected by the white qi but was drenched in cold sweat from fright and screamed in terror.

He was horrified by the sight of an apprentice, who had lost his lower body, crawling toward him with blood-red hands, leaving a trail of crimson on the ground behind him. In his terror, he jumped up and fled without looking back.

Before Li Xuanxuan could even assess his injuries, the cultivator surnamed Qiu was already advancing toward him at a rapid pace. His bamboo hat was raised high, revealing a face marred by scars. His eyes glinted fiercely as he bellowed, "How dare you deceive me?!"

Li Xuanxuan, heart racing, hurled the dark jade pearl like a lightning bolt toward the cultivator's face. At the same time, he activated the Blood Escape Technique, vanishing in a trail of crimson.

The cultivator sneered.

"Ridiculous!"

The Thunder Pearl required a specific spell and mantra to detonate it, which was why the cultivator surnamed Qiu had dared to hand it over to Li Xuanxuan without a hint of fear.

When he saw Li Xuanxuan throw the pearl without any incantation, he merely gave a cold snort and continued to advance undeterred.

BOOM!

The dark pearl exploded in midair with a flash of crimson sparks, lighting up the cultivator's face. He froze, shocked.

"IMPOSSIBLE!" he exclaimed in shock.

Almost instinctively, he reached for a talisman in his sleeve. As he prepared to launch the talisman, he fought the impulse suddenly, stepping back and watching the black jade pearl as it fell, producing only a few tiny sparks.

"Phew..."

The cultivator wiped the cold sweat from his brow and then retrieved the jade pearl. He chuckled coldly. Noting that the crimson light was already too far off for him to catch up to it, he muttered, "What a clever man. He stuck a piece of talisman on this pearl and nearly fooled me with it... Fortunately, years of fighting experience have saved me from wasting a precious protective treasure."

"Unfortunately, I still need to proceed to the formation point. I'll have to let this one go... The Li Family, huh? I've heard they're a sword immortal clan... With Li Tongya dead, I suppose I can lead my people through there..."

He cast a distant glance at Li Xuanxuan and abruptly turned away. Li Yuanyun had already scrambled to his feet and sprinted a dozen chi within moments.

The black-robed cultivator let out a cold laugh and snapped his fingers.

"AH!"

A white aura, swift as a meteor, struck Li Yuanyun's exposed back. He had time only for a brief cry of pain before his skin and flesh vanished, immediately becoming reduced to a heap of white bones that was scattered across the ground.

The marketplace was in chaos, littered with signs of the recent skirmish. In the pulsating light of the white formation, the cultivator surnamed Qiu let out a hearty laugh and flew toward the formation point where he was supposed to be heading to.

Li Xuanxuan, employing the potent Blood Escape Technique, sped forward. Ahead lay the Xiao Family's grand formation, flickering intermittently, its energy undulating like water ripples—clearly on the verge of collapse due to both internal and external pressures.

He stared intently at it. Though it was noon, darkness and swirling devilish smoke enveloped the outside. He paused, hesitant to venture out.

"Who knows how many devil cultivators are lurking outside, just waiting for this formation to break and swarm in... all eager to plunder this market... If I go out recklessly now, I risk becoming the appetizer for those fiends!"

Blood qi and mana were flowing out of him like a river that had burst its banks. Li Xuanxuan could barely endure it, and the vivid red of his shield was also too conspicuous to maintain.

Looking back and seeing that the black-robed cultivator had not followed, Li Xuanxuan quickly deactivated the technique and stumbled into the street, coughing painfully. Every part of his body ached. He checked himself with his spiritual consciousness, only to find himself much thinner with a ghastly visage.

"Fortunately, it's not as bad as it could have been," Li Xuanxuan murmured with a quiet sigh of relief.

He had narrowly escaped death by employing the Blood Escape Technique, bracing for the severe toll it could take on his vital qi. To his surprise, it had merely shortened his lifespan and altered his appearance.

He suddenly winced in pain. The wound on his hand was deep, exposing his bone, and blood was spilling copiously.

Li Xuanxuan sealed the wound with mana, cast several healing spells, and swallowed two pills hastily. "Venturing out now seems impossible. Qiuyang must still be around the marketplace, hiding somewhere... and Yuanyun is probably dead by now..." he muttered somberly to himself.

Li Xuanxuan almost could not breathe. Li Xuanling had only died recently, followed by Li Tongya. Now, with Li Xuanling's son also dead in the marketplace, the weight of his guilt was unbearable...

If not for Li Qinghong, who now stood as one of the two strongest cultivators in the family, and Xicheng and Xijun, who each possessed a spiritual orifice, the lineage of Li Tongya would be on the brink of extinction.

Reflecting on these circumstances deepened Li Xuanxuan's sorrow, a feeling that overshadowed even the loss of years from his life.

Looking at the sky, Li Xuanxuan realized his only chance to escape was to wait for the devil cultivators to break the grand formation and swarm into this marketplace.

He paused to rest, catching his breath and recalibrating the qi within his body. His mind began racing with thoughts.

This invasion is too sudden! Aren't the devil cultivators still in neighboring prefectures...? How did they traverse the vast Mushroom Forest Plain and appear in Lixia Prefecture unnoticed?!

Does... Xiao Chuting know about this?!

He huddled in a corner to remain unseen as more thoughts continued racing through his head.

The marketplace was under the supervision of Xiao Yongling, a cultivator of the Foundation Establishment Realm. However, he was reassigned five years ago, leaving only Xiao Ruyu, who is still a Qi Cultivator here... No, maybe Xiao Ruyu has already left the mountain long ago!

Li Xuanxuan looked up at Cloud Crowned Peak which was shrouded in dark clouds, his heart filled with unease. If Qiu, planted in the market as a spy, was already a peak Qi Cultivator, that must mean that the Cloud Crowned Peak was currently surrounded by Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators!

"Four..."

Li Xuanxuan observed silently. After Xiao Yongling's reassignment, the Xiao Family had only one or two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators left at the marketplace on the Cloud Crowned Peak. They were clearly outnumbered and forced into a defensive stance.

"It takes the time to burn a stick of incense to travel here from Xianyou Peak, and a quarter of that time has already passed."

Li Xuanxuan's expression was grim. He was painfully aware of his modest abilities—merely at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and not adept in combat.

If the situation escalated into chaos, he feared the worst.

BOOM!

The attic before him exploded with a loud bang, and as scorching flames erupted, Li Qiuyang's hurried steps halted. He looked up at the sky, awash with streaks of light, and felt torn.

"That black-robed cultivator is most likely a devil cultivator... Brother Xuan probably sent me out to seek help from the Xiao Family... But given the current situation, the Xiao Family can hardly protect themselves, let alone assist others!"

The marketplace sprawled around Cloud Crowned Peak, crowned by a grand formation that enveloped the entire area. Numerous nodes were scattered throughout the market.

Amidst the dark clouds looming over the peak, Li Qiuyang spotted several black-robed cultivators. It was then that he realized that seeking help by ascending the mountain would be futile.

As the angry shouts of the other black-robed cultivators that were wreaking havoc in the marketplace filled the air, a sense of foreboding grew within Li Qiuyang. Hiding under the eaves, he brooded darkly.

Brother Xuan must be fighting that cultivator right now... That man is a peak Qi cultivator. How can Brother Xuan possibly hold his ground...?

He wanted to step forward but paused, gripped by hesitation.

But I am just an unrefined Qi Cultivator... I'd be killed instantly by the devil cultivators as soon as I stepped out! How can I even stand a chance to help Brother Xuan?!

Outside, the battle raged with cries of pain and splattering blood. Gritting his teeth, Li Qiuyang knew he could not remain hidden for long without being discovered. He quietly activated a Qi Restraining Technique before cautiously venturing out.

The black-robed devil cultivator ahead was an early-stage Qi Cultivator and was wielding a large ax. He radiated a fierce aura, laughing maniacally as he swung his weapon.

Opposite him, a group of Xiao Family cultivators stood in formation, led by a figure who had only recently attained the Qi Cultivation Realm. Li Qiuyang, familiar with the local cultivators, recognized him and recalled their brief interactions.

Behind him stood five cultivators of the third and fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm holding white mana light in their hands that formed a small, shimmering formation. Each time the devil cultivator's axe struck, the formation shook, threatening to collapse under the force.

A chill ran down Li Qiuyang's spine. He had often seen Xiao Family's cultivators resolve disputes with calm efficiency, but now they struggled to hold their ground. It was his first time witnessing such a formidable battle.

The Xiao Family's cultivators are strong, and they have always been regarded as formidable among their peers. Yet, they have to form a defensive formation just to withstand this devil cultivator's assault!

Li Qiuyang reached into his sleeve and pulled out two talismans—one early-stage and one late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm—which he had initially planned to sell for Spirit Stones.

Holding them tightly, he prepared for action.

The Xiao Family's cultivators, sweating under pressure, glanced up and caught sight of Li Qiuyang hiding in the distance. A fleeting relief flickered across their faces before they swiftly resumed a guise of anxiety. Quietly, they marshaled their strength, preparing to coordinate their counterattack with Li Qiuyang.

Understanding their intentions, Li Qiuyang slowly channeled his mana into the talisman in his hand. As soon as it glowed with a red aura, he cried out loudly, "RELEASE!"




# Chapter 382: Profit From Chaos

Li Qiuyang's spell ignited in his hand instantly, flaring into a stream of light that split the air as it flew toward the unsuspecting man. Focused on the group of Xiao Family's cultivators in front of him, the man felt his skin crawl and turned just in time.

"Damn it!"

The devil cultivator saw the fire spell barreling toward him and hastily shifted his stance to block it. Despite his experience and strong martial prowess, he was forced to brace himself and counter the spell.

Meanwhile, the Xiao Family's cultivators reacted swiftly and grasped this opportunity to attack. They positioned themselves behind the man now, seizing the opportunity as they swung their dharma artifacts.

Their leader commanded, "Men, reposition yourselves! Shift the formation to the offensive!"

The golden light, long gathered in his palms, was bursting forth. The Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators behind him had been channeling their mana to empower the spell all this while, making it blaze ever brighter, transforming into a prismatic golden missile that hurtled toward their foe.

"SHIT!"

An ordinary Qi Cultivator caught between these attacks would have had no chance of survival. However, this devil cultivator was not ordinary. A brilliant blood light flared around him, and a small red shield emerged behind him.

CLANG!

He raised his large axe, its blade aglow with sinister blood light. With a single sweeping blow, it had already shattered Li Qiuyang's spell. However, an unyielding streak of golden light struck him squarely in the back.

The shield lasted only a moment before vanishing under the onslaught of the golden light. It was a brief respite, but enough for the cultivator to adjust his position and narrowly avoid a fatal blow.

A muffled poof was heard before blood splattered everywhere. The devil cultivator's body was cleaved all the way from his left shoulder to left hip, and his organs spilled out gruesomely.

He gritted his teeth and cursed, then quickly performed a hand seal. The blood and flesh in the air quickly transformed into a swirling blood mist before touching the ground, and just like a whirlwind, the remnants of his body vanished into the depths of the alley.

Li Qiuyang, having never before encountered a devil cultivator of such resilience, stood frozen in shock for a moment before exclaiming, "How can he still escape in that state? How can this be possible?!"

"Brother Qiuyang!"

The Xiao Family cultivators had already broken their formation and approached him with gratitude.

"Thank you for your help, Brother Qiuyang!"

"No problem," Li Qiuyang replied, but he was still a little dazed from being surprised by the devil cultivator's maneuver.

"Are we going to just let him go like this?" he asked.

Noticing Li Qiuyang's surprise, a member of the Xiao Family smiled bitterly and said, "You may not know about this, Brother Qiuyang, but devil cultivators are masters at preserving their lives. Among all cultivators, those who followed the path of Diverse Mansion Unified Cauldron were notoriously difficult to defeat."

"What's more, devil cultivators like him generally disregard their physical bodies, just like the Buddhist cultivators. While their bodies aren't as disposable as the Buddhists, they certainly don't hold the same value to him as to us. Do not be fooled by his injuries; a few days of absorbing blood qi and devil qi will see him fully restored," he added bitterly.

While the Xiao Family's cultivator was explaining, the white formation in the sky above them suddenly rumbled, revealing cracks all over. The faces of those around him immediately turned ashen with fear.

"Then we should leave quickly! If this devil cultivator gathers reinforcements and attacks, we'll be as good as dead!" Li Qiuyang urged hastily.

The expression of the Xiao Family's cultivator darkened as he said gravely, "You're right, the market seems to still be surrounded by devil cultivators... It's impossible to escape now. There's still a major formation atop the Cloud Crowned Peak, why don't you come with me to the market's center? There's a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator on Cloud Crowned Peak, and with the grand formation's protection, I think we can hold out until my family sends help..."

Li Qiuyang shook his head, pulling a jade pendant from his storage pouch and sensing its direction before replying, "Brother Xuan from my family is still in the marketplace. I must go help him... Forgive me, but I cannot accompany you."

"Ah!"

A look of disappointment appeared on the Xiao Family's cultivator's face as chaos reigned around them in the city. He knew Li Qiuyang, an unrefined Qi Cultivator, might struggle even with self-protection, let alone find someone in the marketplace.

But seeing Li Qiuyang's solemn, determined expression, he could only cup his fist respectfully and say in a subdued voice, "Take care of yourself, Brother!"

Flying was not an option as such ascent would make them easy targets for the lurking devil cultivators, so the cultivators activated their Divine Movement Spell and swiftly parted ways.

The Xiao Family's cultivator led his group down an alley, while Li Qiuyang clutched the talisman in his sleeve with one hand and held the jade pendant in the other, racing toward Li Xuanxuan.

————

Meanwhile on Cloud Crowned Peak...

The wind blew gently across the frigid mountaintop where Xiao Ruyu stood, his expression as somber as the murky clouds rolling endlessly beyond the protective formation.

On the jade platform before him lay a formation plate with complex patterns. Six of its points still shone brightly like stars, while the other six were dull and cracked, having clearly been tampered with.

Contrary to Li Xuanxuan's assumptions, Xiao Ruyu was still on Cloud Crowned Peak. He stood there, unprepared and brooding, his teeth clenched.

"I'm afraid... I've fallen into a trap."

The jade in his hand emitted a faint red glow as light flowed across the six engraved names.

"Cloud Crowned Market, Mount Yu, Xianyou Peak, Yuyuan Market... I don't think our family can save them."

A chill settled in Xiao Ruyu's heart. The devil plague was wreaking havoc, not just on the fringes of Cloud Crowned Peak but at almost every Xiao Family stronghold, including the main peak, Xianyou Peak.

"The Old Ancestor has been gone for months, and with the devil plague intensifying, I fear my family will suffer great losses!"

BOOM!

Lost in his grim thoughts, Xiao Ruyu did not immediately notice two more points on the formation plate flicker and die. Clutching his dharma artifact, he looked up to find several black-robed cultivators outside the formation, silent yet clearly hostile, leaving him puzzled.

They said the devil plague would spread north from the Mushroom Forest Plain, through Lixia Prefecture to the boundary of the Purple Smoke Gate... Why the sudden change? Could the Azure Pond Sect... be against us now?

Having led his family for three years and managed the Cloud Crowned Peak town for five, Xiao Ruyu was no longer the impulsive youth who had once sought revenge at the Golden Tang Gate together with Li Xuanfeng. His knowledge of hidden secrets and his tactical acumen had evolved immensely.

Impossible... impossible... How could the Azure Pond Sect turn against us now, with at least fifty years until Daoist Master Shangyuan breaks through?

His thoughts were in disarray as the formation points shook violently before finally being extinguished. The cracks in the large white formation above widened, and devil qi began seeping through like billowing smoke, emitting a shrill whistle.

Xiao Ruyu watched on with a calm look on his face, but a tense voice beside him quickly broke the silence.

"Young Master!"

A swordsman with an ethereal aura landed on the peak, his body encircled by two serpent dragons with bared fangs. In a grave voice, he said urgently, "Please descend the mountain quickly, Young Master. I will handle things here!"

He was Chen Taojing, once an ally in the siege of Yu Yufeng alongside Li Tongya. His Dao foundation was the Boundless Ocean, and the light green serpent dragons around him looked extremely formidable.

"Uncle Taojing..."

Xiao Ruyu hesitated, his eyes flickering between the faltering grand formation and the stalwart figure beside him.

"My Boundless Ocean prowess is the strongest here; I can control many with one. I've also prepared pills for this. Please leave quickly now, Young Master!" Chen Taojing urged.
𝘧𝓇ℯ𝑒𝓌𝑒𝑏𝓃𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘭.𝒸ℴ𝓂

Gritting his teeth, Xiao Ruyu cloaked his figure and hurried down the mountain, leaving Chen Taojing standing alone, sword in hand, facing the silhouettes outside the crumbling grand formation.

Li Xuanxuan waited in the street for a bit. He saw no one, only the stark red blood that had seeped into the earth and stained it. He retrieved a jade talisman from his storage pouch and focused on it intently for a moment.

"Qiuyang's position is still changing... I can't tell if he's alive or if someone has taken his talisman..." he murmured to himself in worry.
𝕗𝐫𝐞𝕖𝕨𝐞𝗯𝚗𝕠𝘃𝐞𝚕.𝐜𝗼𝚖

The fact that Li Qiuyang was an unrefined Qi Cultivator made him vulnerable, especially amidst such widespread calamity. Li Xuanxuan clung to hope for his safety, though his certainty waned.

Anxiously, Li Xuanxuan watched the direction indicated by the jade talisman and began to move toward it.

After a moment's hesitation, he crammed the talisman into a crack in the wall. His hand glowed with mana light as he quickly wrote a few lines of words on the wall:

Qiuyang, if you're reading this, then wait for me here.

He secured the message with their family's encryption method before swiftly departing.

Walking down the street, Li Xuanxuan passed by a gruesome scene—bodies young and old lay scattered, their ends evidently violent. Amidst the debris, he noticed fragments of a jade bottle and two blood-stained white pills emitting a faint glow.

Years of experience working in the store allowed him to quickly identify them as Clear Mind Pills. These were used by cultivators to clear their minds and stabilize their qi to enhance cultivation. He promptly approached the pils and scooped them up. He wiped them on his robe first before casting a spell to remove the remaining bloodstain and squinted closely at them.

The pills had smooth surfaces and were well-made; clearly produced by a prestigious clan. Despite being stained with blood, their efficacy was only slightly diminished. Relieved, he sealed them in a jade bottle and resumed his search.

The corpse in the blood pool was desiccated, with its life force completely drained. However, Li Xuanxuan was undeterred. He searched the body, only to find that the storage pouch had already long since been robbed clean by the devil cultivators.

He rubbed the sleeve of the clothes that the corpse was wearing and realized that it was made of high-quality spirit cloth, suggesting that the deceased cultivator had a notable background. Without hesitation, he stripped the robe from the body and stowed it in his storage pouch.

After looting the corpse, Li Xuanxuan looked up and saw a shiny store sign across the street that read Elixir Pavilion.

His heart surged with excitement. Staring at the deserted entrance which reeked of blood, a greedy thought crossed his mind.

The devil cultivators must have raided this place in haste... perhaps they left something behind!

Elixir Pavilion was owned by the Yu Family of Cloud Crowned Peak. Just days before, Li Xuanxuan had purchased various items there. The selection of elixirs was extensive, and he could have easily spent all day browsing through their offerings.

Snapping back to reality, Li Xuanxuan immediately cast an Aura Restraint Technique on himself before quietly approaching the pavilion.

At the entrance, a cultivator dressed in brocade kneeled with his head drooped downward. Blood flowed down the steps from his hollowed chest—his heart had been stolen. Recognizing the man as the Yu Family's shopkeeper, Li Xuanxuan shuddered at the sight.

If I hadn't recognized that Thunder Pearl and acted swiftly, my family's store might have suffered the same fate... or worse!

Li Xuanxuan moved past the corpse and quickly searched the counter. Despite a thorough search, the grim reality was that it had been completely looted. The devil cultivators, fond of Spirit Stones, had evidently taken them all, leaving nothing behind.

The Elixir Pavilion was shrouded in darkness, littered with broken fragments of jade bottles and bloodstains. Using his spiritual sense, Li Xuanxuan managed to salvage five robes and seven pills—six of Embryonic Breathing and one of Qi Cultivation Realm.

He glanced back at the disrobed corpses. Feeling a twinge of remorse and guilt, he decided to cover them up with other fabric he found in the store before stepping into the pavilion's backyard.

The backyard was even dimmer and partially collapsed. The bare stone slabs underfoot glowed a dark red; though they were not hot, the pungent smell of the smoldering ground was sharp and acrid, stinging his nostrils.

"Warm yet not searing—it's a fire vein... The Yu Family must have been planning to build an alchemy room, so they had drawn the fire vein here..." Li Xuanxuan murmured thoughtfully.

Although the Li Family did not have an alchemy room, Li Xuanxuan was able to identify the baleful flame used in one. The devil cultivators had likely ransacked the area and stolen the furnaces. Without the furnaces and their suppressing formations, the fire vein had erupted, scorching the ground around it.

Casting a protective spell over his nose and mouth, Li Xuanxuan cautiously advanced, pushing aside the debris of a pillar to reveal the smoldering dark red flames beneath it, confirming his suspicion that the furnaces in two rooms had indeed been stolen. What was left behind was only the fiery veins that were exposed and glowing intensely.

"What a waste..." he sighed.

The Yu Family must have expended many Spirit Stones to harness these fire veins as it required a lot of work.

As he turned to leave, a faint groan caught his ear.

"Hmm..?"

He paused, listening intently. Following the sound, he spotted a furry arm poking out from beneath the rubble. A hand with sharp, black nails was struggling to push aside a boulder.

Li Xuanxuan's first thought was alarm.

Is it a demonic creature?!

How could a demonic survive in Yu Family's marketplace, at the heart of the city?!

Yet as he observed more closely, the creature showed no signs of demonic qi but instead radiated pure mana.

This can't be a demon... It must be one of the Yu Family's spirit beasts! Perhaps one that guarded the storehouse or served them!

Relieved, Li Xuanxuan stepped forward and struck the boulder with his palm, shattering it instantly. The creature pinned beneath flipped over, revealing a monkey's face.

"A spirit monkey..?" Li Xuanxuan wondered aloud.

The monkey appeared exhausted, its eyes red and face deeply wrinkled, yet its gaze was lucid, brimming with worldly wisdom. Tears filled its eyes as it looked at Li Xuanxuan with great emotion in his eyes. Each breath it took was labored, resonating like air wheezing through a broken furnace.

Li Xuanxuan held the monkey's furry hand and was taken aback to discover that this spirit beast was stronger than him. It had reached the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, but despite its strength, the monkey was suffering from fire poisoning and had sustained numerous injuries, teetering on the brink of death.

Li Xuanxuan gazed at its tear-stained face which was filled with gratitude, and felt a tug at his heartstrings. He reached into his sleeve and produced two healing pills, offering them to the monkey.

"Here, take these," he said warmly.

The hunched spirit monkey eagerly accepted the pills and swallowed them. It then began gesturing animatedly, moving its body to generate a clattering din akin to clanking iron.

It was at this moment that Li Xuanxuan finally noticed a cold, heavy collar around the monkey's neck. Nearby, a jade green mortar and pestle lay discarded, its edge chipped but still glinting like a precious treasure.

He picked it up, recognizing it as a Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifact used for grinding herbs—a rare find which was highly prized among alchemists and worth even more than any elixir.

Overjoyed, Li Xuanxuan exclaimed, "Good monkey, with these treasures, many of Ming'er's problems will be solved!"

Trying to contain his excitement, he carefully stored the dharma artifacts into his storage pouch. The monkey kneeled and parted its charred fur, revealing several puncture wounds of varying sizes. The wounds oozed black blood, presenting a startling and grim sight.

Realization dawned on Li Xuanxuan as he quickly retrieved a bottle of ointment and applied it to the wound, then cast three spells to heal the monkey's wounds. Looking at the creature, he speculated, This spirit beast likely tended to the Yu Family's fires. I wonder where it was hiding during the devil cultivators' attacks... its survival is nothing short of miraculous!

As he tended to the monkey's blistered skin and singed fur, horror struck him at the realization of what it had endured.

It must have hidden itself in the fire vein! Such a smart and resilient monkey... Its mental fortitude is impressive!

The fire vein, fraught with toxic flame and chaotic energy, could disrupt spiritual senses. It was a perilous hideout, yet the monkey had endured the suffering silently...

Still in disbelief, Li Xuanxuan watched as the monkey dug through the debris, retrieving a charred body. From the sleeve pocket of the corpse's robe, it pulled out a shiny jade piece.

Click.

In just the space of two breaths, the monkey had used the jade piece to unlock the spirit iron collar around its neck. It presented both items to Li Xuanxuan, then crouched on the ground and began to meditate.

Li Xuanxuan had only taken a brief look at the items when the monkey's eyes suddenly snapped open. Its ears twitched as fear flickered in its eyes. It began making silent gestures, miming the motions of pounding herbs.

Sensing the urgency, Li Xuanxuan quickly stowed the items and retracted his spiritual sense as much as possible as he huddled in the corner, not daring to move. The monkey anxiously alternated between bowing and miming the action of pounding herbs but did not dare to make any noise.

Li Xuanxuan watched it quietly for a moment before taking out the mortar and pestle from his storage pouch and handing it back to the monkey. In an instant, the creature gratefully grabbed the dharma artifacts and disappeared into the ruins like a wisp of smoke.

Meanwhile on Wutu Peak...

Li Yuanjiao exhaled deeply. The scale pattern of the longsword named Dragon Coiling Pillar in his grip shimmered with an azure sheen as it caught the light. With his other hand, he held a light purple-colored manual titled the Law of Celestial Moon.

Now thirty-three, Li Yuanjiao stood at the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, just a step away from achieving the seventh heavenly layer. His progress, fueled by the Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit Talisman and the considerable resources of the Li Family, was already regarded as extraordinary.

By comparison, Li Tongya was already fifty when he reached the seventh heavenly layer, and Li Xuanfeng was nearly forty. Li Yuanjiao's rapid ascent definitely positioned him as an exceptional cultivator among the other disciples of the Li Family.

"I should break through to the seventh heavenly layer by the end of the year! The late stages of Qi Cultivation Realm are about accumulation... With seven or eight years of effort, followed by a talisman pill, I should be ready to attempt a breakthrough to the most difficult ninth heavenly layer. Just two more years, and I might attempt to build the Immortal Foundation."

If everything went according to plan, Li Yuanjiao should be able to seclude himself to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm in his early forties.

He stowed the manual away and retrieved a white jade slip, titled the Law of Sexagenary Cycle Sword Manual—a commentary written by Li Tongya. Compared to the complicated Law of Celestial Moon, it was much easier to understand.

After carefully reading the content twice, he thought to himself, Granduncle's swordsmanship is exceptional, having been mentored by the Sword Immortal himself, yet he only grasped the sword element at the age of eighty... That shows how difficult it is to master the art of killing. I wonder how many swordsmen and Sword Immortals there are in Jiangnan...

Currently, only I can match my granduncle in sword talent. Qinghong and Xicheng prefer spears, and the next best swordsman in our family, Zhi'er, has gone to the sect. Xijun shows promise, whereas Ximing treats his sword merely as a tool, lacking the true spirit of a swordsman.

Deep in thought and stroking his chin, Li Yuanjiao was interrupted by a middle-aged man with slightly tanned skin, high eyebrows, and huge eyes. He approached and cupped his fist.

"Peak Master, there's been an incident on Guli Road!"

He was none other than Shamoli, a Qi Cultivator of the fourth heavenly layer who had given up on ruling Mount Yue State and now cultivated alongside Li Yuanjiao.

Despite being an unrefined Qi Cultivator, he consumed spiritual qi that had been mixed with water and purified. Skilled in the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique, he stood on par with regular Qi Cultivators.

Taken aback by the news, Li Yuanjiao rose on the winds. As he ascended, he saw smoke billowing from Guli Road, drawing cultivators from various families who also rose to investigate. Several white lights stayed in the air, signaling hesitation.

"Something happened at Cloud Crowned Peak!"

Thanks to the Xiao Family's efforts in renovating Guli Road, complete with stationed cultivators at newly established relay posts, news from Cloud Crowned Peak reached them swiftly.

Li Yuanjiao's expression darkened.

Oh no... How could this happen?! Father and the others are still at the marketplace!

"Let's go!"

He quickly descended, summoning Li Qinghong and An Zheyan, along with other seasoned Qi Cultivators before flying eastward together.

————

Li Xuanxuan watched the monkey vanish, his mind swirling with doubts and a nagging sense of fear that the creature might not return, which stirred a vague regret within him.

Splat.

Before he could dwell on these thoughts, a subtle flipping sound set off alarms in his heart. Unfortunately, the baleful flames in the backyard from the fire vein suppressed his spiritual sense, confining it to a mere few inches around him and preventing any investigation of his surroundings.

After waiting in the fire-enshrouded backyard for some time, Li Xuanxuan finally glimpsed a tall, dark figure with a halo of red light around him emerging from the baleful flames.

While Li Xuanxuan was waiting, he already had the most powerful fire talisman in his clutch. His eyes were fixated on the figure, carefully contemplating his next move.

Dressed in black and exuding blood qi, he must be a devil cultivator. I need to strike first! Even if I can't defeat him, I can at least escape...

While this person was busy looking around, Li Xuanxuan quickly acted. The talisman in his hand glowed a fierce red as he hurled it toward the figure while he drew a large ax from his storage pouch with the other hand, swinging it with a swift twist.

The devil cultivator, whose spiritual sense was suppressed by the baleful flames, had not anticipated such a sudden ambush from the shadows. Caught off guard and struck by a talisman of mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm, his face and body were instantly engulfed in flames.

"OWWW—!"

The baleful flame in the backyard and the fire spell sparked a chain reaction, boosting the fire intensity by thirty percent and casting a brilliant, red glow over the ruins. In this fiery light, Li Xuanxuan's ax gleamed menacingly as it descended upon the cultivator's neck.

Snap...!

A gruesome noise was heard as the devil cultivator's neck split into two like sugar cane, blood spurting everywhere violently.

Li Xuanxuan felt a moment of relief—until the headless body of his enemy staggered forward, its pale hands striking Li Xuanxuan's chest with surprising force.

"What?!"

The impact sent him flying, and he crashed into a crooked beam causing a loud noise. Ash and smoke billowed as two large pillars collapsed onto him.

Gasping and spitting out two mouthfuls of blood, Li Xuanxuan dared not continue staying on the ground. He struggled to rise to his feet, and the world was spinning around him. Meanwhile, the devil cultivator had somehow managed reattached his head, his face pale and his eyes filled with vivid anger and fear.

He cursed loudly, "I knew something was off! To think an immortal cultivator nearly killed me outright!"

Despite his exclamations, his actions were swift. He drew two short blades, their edges slick with blood. He was lightning fast and closed the distance in a blink, blades poised to strike.

Thankfully, Li Xuanxuan had held onto his dharma weapon through the pain. Twisting the handle of his ax, he used it like a shield to block the incoming attack, though the impact still sent a shock of pain through his chest.

With his free hand, he retrieved yet another talisman, releasing streams of golden light that formed a protective barrier around him. This allowed him a moment to catch his breath.

The devil cultivator, having missed his blow, quickly retreated, gasping for breath. Clearly still reeling from the earlier talisman attack, he cursed vehemently, "You motherfucking bum... How dare you sneak up on me?!"
𝑓𝓇𝘦ℯ𝘸𝘦𝑏𝓃𝑜𝘷ℯ𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝓂

Li Xuanxuan rose to his feet silently and carefully assessed the situation. His enemy was probably a mid-stage Qi Cultivator, now slightly weakened by his sneak attack.

This man is a lot faster than me... I can't afford to rush my escape; I need to seize every opportunity to get out of this alive!

In any case, Li Xuanxuan was secretly grateful that his foe was not as formidable as the previous devil cultivator with the thunder pearl, and their cultivation paths seemed quite different too.

I should strike while he's weak!

With that thought in mind, he swung his ax directly at the cultivator's face. The devil cultivator glared at him furiously and quickly crossed his blades in response to block the ax. He then moved his lips and spat out a mist of blood qi.

This blood qi mist was most likely some vile technique from devil cultivation. Unfamiliar with such means, Li Xuanxuan could only grit his teeth and back down.

What should I do?!

Li Xuanxuan was not adept in combat and lacked powerful strategies. The dharma ax that he wielded was more ornamental than practical, chosen only because it was an unused weapon in his family.

The devil cultivator began slicing away chunks of flesh, leaving a bloody, gaping wound in his thigh. As Li Xuanxuan watched the devil cultivator regain his composure and use his superior speed to fight, anxiety gripped him.

With gritted teeth, he pulled out a dozen talismans from his sleeve, muttering quietly to himself.

"I'm reluctant to use these... but my life depends on them."

The devil cultivator's expression paled at the sight of Li Xuanxuan reaching for another talisman. Scrambling about desperately, he managed to produce only two talismans of his own.

Meanwhile, several talismans in Li Xuanxuan's hands were already glowing fiercely before being hurled straight toward the devil cultivator.

"Such madness!"

In the narrow confines of the backyard, the combined might of the talismans was overwhelming. The devil cultivator emitted a sharp whistle as half of his body transformed into a cloud of blood mist. In the pitch darkness of the courtyard, they stood merely three or four chi apart when Li Xuanxuan issued a command.

"RELEASE!"

The talismans burst into brilliant red light. Li Xuanxuan had selected fire spells since the room was filled with baleful flames, and could be used to his advantage. The darkness in the room was instantly replaced by a vivid crimson glow as flames surged, engulfing both figures.

BOOM!

The Elixir Pavilion could no longer withstand the onslaught and collapsed under the fiery assault, but fortunately, fires raged throughout the marketplace, making the destruction less conspicuous amidst the chaos.

The shield around Li Xuanxuan shattered instantly, flinging him backward. He rolled twice before coming to a stop, coughing up a mouthful of blood. Several of his ribs were broken and his left leg hung limply, likely broken too.

Flames blazed all around him, searing his skin into blisters. Despite the excruciating pain, he forced himself to stand. His left calf, though badly injured, was still attached to his thigh by the tendon—indicating that the wound, while painful, was not severe.

After casting a healing spell on his leg, Li Xuanxuan staggered to his feet, feeling drained of all energy. The mana shield had saved his life, but at the cost of depleting his mana reserves.

"Where is that person...?"

The baleful flames roared, further fueling the burning fire and spreading it from the broken wooden beams. It twisted through the air like serpents, warping his vision. Through the distorted haze, Li Xuanxuan saw the devil cultivator rise to his feet unsteadily, his skin seared and emitting a burnt odor. His hands, reduced to bare bone, were still holding the two short blades. He moved toward Li Xuanxuan steadily, clearly in a far better condition.
𝓯𝙧𝓮𝓮𝒘𝓮𝙗𝙣𝒐𝒗𝒆𝓵.𝓬𝓸𝒎

"You..."

The devil cultivator fixed him with a spiteful glare and managed to squeeze out a single word before a smaller figure burst forth from the flames. A turquoise jade pestle, as thick as an adult's arm, swung through the air and struck the cultivator's head with a sickening crack.

The devil cultivator's head burst open like a watermelon instantly, splattering the scene with a gruesome mix of white and red—almost like fireworks. Teeth scattered around like rain, a few of them even hitting Li Xuanxuan's face and with two rolling into his sleeve.

Thud.

Li Xuanxuan finally fell to his knees, blood spilling from his mouth.

Bam!

The monkey continued swinging the pestle, striking the fallen devil cultivator's chest. Flesh and blood flew everywhere, staining the monkey into a gory red. Yet, it showed no sign of stopping.

Li Xuanxuan swallowed a pill and paused to meditate, quickly restoring his mana. He then cast several healing spells upon himself, still focusing on his recovery. Nearby, the fire intensified, painting the surroundings in ominous shades of red while smoke billowed around him.

Li Xuanxuan called out, "Good monkey... Burn him with the fire! Burn him..."

Before he could finish speaking, he saw the devil cultivator's finger twitch ominously.

Aware of the threat this man posed, Li Xuanxuan dared not let his guard down. Despite tearing up from the smoke, he kept his eyes on the devil cultivator and immediately noticed this subtle movement. He yelped in fear and quickly grabbed his large ax at the ready.

However, the devil cultivator's stomach suddenly swelled up massively before exploding. A thin, frail and bloody child jumped out from within, eyes wide with terror. As soon as his feet hit the ground, he immediately started sprinting toward the flames.

Fortunately, Li Xuanxuan had already raised his ax. With a powerful swing, he heard a sickening crunch as the emaciated child fell to the ground limply, cleaved into two. However, he continued pleading, "Mercy, Immortal Master! Forgive me, please! I've made a mistake! I..."

While Li Xuanxuan was still gasping for breath, the monkey turned around in terror and swung its green jade pestle, pulverizing the child's remains into unrecognizable masses. Without further delay, Li Xuanxuan performed a hand seal and unleashed a fire spell.

The flame of the spell roared, reducing the devil cultivator's body into mere charcoal. Li Xuanxuan grabbed the monkey's bloody hand and whispered hoarsely, "Let's go!"

His voice was so raspy that even he could hardly hear it, but the monkey quickly understood his words, nodding and handing over the black and gold-colored storage pouch that belonged to the devil cultivator to Li Xuanxuan.

"Good monkey!"

After collecting the pouch, Li Xuanxuan and the monkey dashed from the fire, seeking refuge in a nearby house that was untouched by flames. They collapsed onto the ground and began meditating to heal their injuries.

"Shit..." Li Xuanxuan cursed.

It had been so many years since he last cussed. The word scratched his throat as it came out, bringing tears of relief. His cultivation which had been stagnant for years suddenly stirred to life.

After a few moments, he rose abruptly in alarm and instructed the monkey, "You stay here and heal first."

Li Xuanxuan placed two bottles of pills in front of the monkey before carefully stepping outside. He navigated two streets and spotted someone anxiously waiting near where he had concealed the jade pendant earlier.

With the Elixir Pavilion now collapsed and the fire spreading, everyone's spiritual sense was dulled on the street. Squinting through the flames, Li Xuanxuan could barely discern the figure. However, their eyes met, sending a jolt of fear coursing through him.

"Is that Brother Xuan?!"

Li Qiuyang was equally shaken, but gritted his teeth and called out to the man in the distance, his voice trembling.

Overwhelmed with relief, Li Xuanxuan cried out hoarsely, "Qiuyang!"

Li Qiuyang took a step forward, then recoiled in shock again.

"Brother Xuan?!" he exclaimed in disbelief.

The man limping before him had a gaunt face and a skeletal frame. His eyes were clouded, his skin was smeared with blackened blood and covered in blisters. His hair and eyebrows were completely singed off, leaving his scalp bare. Blood dripped from his sleeves, giving him the eerie appearance of a corpse freshly retrieved from a blaze. If he had not called out his name, Li Qiuyang would not have recognized him at all.

Li Qiuyang stared at him blankly. Just when Li Xuanxuan was about to say something, the ground trembled beneath them.

Rumble!

Cracks began forming on the surface of the grand formation's barrier in the sky, causing the expressions of both men to change.

"Brother Xuan, let's go!" Li Qiuyang urged anxiously.

As if remembering something, Li Xuanxuan stopped him.

"Wait... Wait!"

He shook off the dripping blood from his sleeves, then swiftly flew deeper into the street. Li Qiuyang stomped his foot in frustration, then quickly hurried after him. As soon as he took a turn, he saw Li Xuanxuan rushing toward him again, this time with a monkey.

"Ah...?!"

Li Qiuyang froze, staring at the monkey in disbelief and shock. Its fur was matted with pitch-black blood and its exposed skin was covered with blisters. Startled by Li Qiuyang's gaze, the monkey bared its teeth menacingly, raising the jade pestle in its hand as if ready to strike him.

"Ah?"

Li Qiuyang stumbled back, baffled.

Li Xuanxuan quickly yelled out, "He's with us!"

The old man's shout seemed to calm the monkey instantly. Together, the two men and the monkey rushed against the wind.

Li Xuanxuan instructed urgently, "This formation is about to break... We must escape through the Elixir Pavilion! Once the formation collapses, the devil cultivators will swarm in. The baleful flames can disrupt spiritual senses, and the chaos will conceal us!"

As soon as he finished speaking, realization dawned upon him. He quickly retrieved the black and gold storage pouch and emptied it, using his robe to catch the contents. A myriad of colorful and glowing items came tumbling out, including several sharp dharma weapons that sliced through the fabric of his robe and pierced his skin.

Wincing in pain, Li Xuanxuan quickly transferred the dharma weapons and jade slips into his own storage pouch. With a swift motion, he discarded the remaining useless items, scattering them across the ground, along with the emptied pouch.




# Chapter 386: Rescue

"Where are the Xiao Family members?"

Li Yuanjiao led the members of his family forward and stopped more than ten li away from Cloud Crowned Peak, in front of a massive formation that shrouded the sky. They hovered in mid-air, their expressions grim.

The entire Cloud Crowned Peak was enveloped in a fog and the formation was riddled with cracks. Four or five Immortal Foundations manifested. Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators surrounded the peak, deterring any approach.

"Something's gone terribly wrong with the Xiao Family!" Li Qinghong said, her eyes alight with anxiety. She carried the White Iris Spear on her back and clutched a gray spear of the Qi Cultivation Realm in her hand. Her gaze, tinged with a hint of purple, was fixed intently on the formation.

"It only takes the time taken for an incense stick to burn to get here from Xianyou Peak... The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator should have beaten us here from Mount Lijing, if he meant to come at all. They must have been detained by someone!" she exclaimed.

The group fell silent, each person grappling with the gravity of the situation. The Xiao Family was the Li Family's main supporter, and the thought of them in distress was unbearable—not to mention that their own family members were still trapped in the marketplace...

"My dear!"

While Li Yuanjiao and the others were waiting anxiously, a woman suddenly approached them, riding on the wind. Her elegant face was tinged with anxiety as well, just like the rest. It was Xiao Guiluan, who had rushed over upon hearing of Xiao Family's plight.

"Luan'er...There are likely many devil cultivators ahead, do not go any further!" Li Yuanjiao instructed as he moved to intercept her, his tone firm.

Despite her estrangement from her father, Xiao Guiluan remained deeply connected to the Xiao Family who had raised her. She glanced toward the besieged Xiao Family marketplace with distress, knowing that her uncle, Xiao Ruyu, was likely trapped inside.

"The ancestor must be held up by someone! Xianyou Peak and Mount Yu are surely under attack, preventing any rescue at the Cloud Crowned Peak marketplace... Xiao Ruyu, who has always looked after our family store, is also trapped inside!" she exclaimed.

Li Yuanjiao's heart was equally fraught with worry and concern, but he maintained a composed exterior to comfort his wife.

"Xiao Ruyu is one of the Xiao Family's strongest peak Qi Cultivators... He surely has some means of escape. There's no need to worry!"

As they spoke in hushed tones, a thunderous boom resounded in the sky.

Rumble!

A flash of white filled everyone's vision.

The Xiao Family's meticulously crafted Foundation Establishment Realm formation, which had held on for an hour, finally shattered like glass, disintegrating into a thunder that vanished between heaven and earth.

A swarm of devil cultivators then rode in on a cloud, descending upon the marketplace in a frenzied looting spree. As chaos ensued, the Xiao Family cultivators at Cloud Crowned Peak knew defeat was inevitable and descended the mountain in a desperate bid to escape.

Unfortunately, Cloud Crowned Peak had become the focal point of the devil cultivators' siege, and it was uncertain how many would make it out alive.

"Go!"

As the devil cultivators flooded the marketplace, several onlookers exchanged glances and began to close the distance. After covering a few li, they heard a bellowing cry.

"Chen Taojing of the Xiao Family is here! Don't think you can act as you please!"

In the sky above Cloud Crowned Peak, a brilliant white light flashed, revealing two pale red serpent dragons, their fangs and claws bared in a ferocious display against numerous adversaries. Both serpents had four streams of black qi in their clutches.

It appeared that Chen Taojing had either consumed a powerful elixir or performed some kind of secret technique. The serpent dragons, though oddly colored, were impressively lifelike and formidable.

As his declaration echoed loudly, Li Yuanjiao felt the Dragon Coiling Pillar at his waist buzz and tremble, as if on the verge of flying through the air. He quickly pressed down on it in alarm.

"I heard about this Chen Taojing from Uncle... He's a formidable swordsman. However, Why then does his presence agitate the Dragon Coiling Pillar so much..?"

While he pondered, a mocking voice cut through his thoughts.

"Chen Taojing of the Xiao Family? Hahahahaha..."

A female devil cultivator's laughter rang out shrilly as if she had just heard the funniest joke. After a pause, the voice softened to a taunt.

"I heard that the Xiao Family used to be the lapdogs of Lingyu Gate's Chen Family... How amusing that the roles have reversed in a mere hundred years, and now it's the Chen Family who bows to the Xiao!"

Chen Taojing paused in the air as if trying to identify something before sneering coldly.

"Here I thought what sort of devil plague this was... Turns out it's just something that crawled out of the tower!"

"Shut up!"

The female voice, now furious, let out several shrill screams. The black qi in the air grew restless, quickly encircling Chen Taojing and muffling his words.

Seeing that the Foundation Establishment Realm devil cultivators in the sky were entangled and immobilized, Li Yuanjiao saw an opportunity. He turned to the group behind him and whispered, "Master An and I have the highest cultivation realm here, we' will approach and assess the situation. The rest of you wait here."

Upon hearing the instruction, An Zheyan stepped forward. Behind him, Li Qinghong pursed her lips, quickly grasping Li Yuanjiao's intent.

She drew the White Iris Spear from her back and said softly, "Big Brother, my thunder technique is highly effective against demons and devils, and it should also work well against devil cultivators... Why don't you stay here and watch over the group while Master An and I go ahead to investigate?"

Li Qinghong spoke convincingly, prompting Li Yuanjiao to reconsider his options. Realizing that both he and Li Qinghong could not risk danger simultaneously, he nodded reluctantly and replied with a sigh, "Fine! But retreat immediately if the situation worsens... Do not risk your life."

With that, the two hastened toward the Cloud Crowned Peak Market. Driven by urgency, Li Qinghong and An Zheyan moved swiftly, reaching the market outskirts in mere moments.

They stopped just outside the forest surrounding the marketplace. The ground was stained with blood, and inside, the fire blazed fiercely with smoke billowing everywhere.

An Zheyan shivered slightly but secretly reassured himself.

With her beside me, we should be able to escape unscathed as long as we don't encounter a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator...

Li Qinghong had bested most of the Li Family cultivators in duels. Those in the early stages of Qi Cultivation Realm could not match her, and only those in the middle and late stages could challenge her.

An Zheyan himself could only trade a few hundred blows with her before being inevitably overwhelmed by Li Qinghong's spear.

The only people who possessed the strength to suppress her were Li Yuanjiao and Chen Donghe, who was now away from home. However, should a battle ensue, the outcome would be uncertain, especially considering that Li Qinghong wielded the White Iris Spear, a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma weapon.

An Zheyan had just breathed a sigh of relief when Li Qinghong tightened her grip on her spear, her face turning slightly pale. The devastation around the market was a grim reminder of the peril facing her uncle, Li Xuanxuan, and her clan uncle, Li Qiuyang... not to mention her mortal brother—Li Yuanyun.

Still harboring a sliver of hope, she quickly retrieved a jade pendant from her storage pouch. This pendant could locate others from the main family and their aides within a li or two.

"Oh?"

Upon sensing with her spiritual sense, Li Qinghong was relieved to see two pendants moving together, steadily heading away from the chaos of the market.

Overjoyed, she exclaimed, "Clan Uncle Qiuyang and Uncle Xuan Xuan are together and close by!"

An Zheyan nodded, relieved at their safety. As they descended toward the market, he thought to himself, I only hope that Li Xuanxuan and Li Qiuyang haven't fallen to the same enemy, or had their pendants taken... This woman's wrath would be a force of nature, summoning thunder that could obliterate her enemies, leaving no trace behind!




# Chapter 387: Benefits

"Brother Xuan!"

Li Qiuyang flew close to the ground with Li Xuanxuan beside him, whose face was ashen. He was dragging the scorched monkey along, occasionally pulling out a talisman from his sleeve and tossing it behind them.

BOOM!

The talisman barely emitted a glow before a blood-red hammer shadow crushed the spell into countless fragments.

The man holding the hammer laughed heartily.

"You must be from a rich family, so full of treasures!" he mocked.

They chose a path shrouded in infernal fire to escape, but Li Xuanxuan's luck was never good, and they soon ran into a devil cultivator. This one, wielding a large hammer and seeming to be quite powerful, appeared to be in the middle stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

Li Xuanxuan and the monkey were already in terrible shape, and Li Qiuyang was only an unrefined Qi Cultivator, making them no match for this opponent. They immediately turned to flee for their lives.

"Fortunately, this guy's techniques are broad and slow, unlike the previous devil cultivator. This gives us a bit more time," Li Xuanxuan said as he touched the jade pendant in his sleeve, formulating a plan in his mind.

Although his internal mana was almost depleted and he could not increase his speed, he used the River Crossing Torrential Step to dodge left and right, managing to hold on.

The devil cultivator chased them on a rolling black cloud, brandishing his hammer and toying with them like a cat would with mice. Occasionally, he would speed up, forcing Li Xuanxuan to use talismans to fend off his attacks.

This devil cultivator was clearly more experienced in combat than the previous dual-wielding one, methodically depleting their mana and forcing Li Xuanxuan to exhaust his talismans.
𝓯𝙧𝙚𝙚𝔀𝒆𝓫𝓷𝙤𝓿𝒆𝙡.𝒄𝙤𝓶

"Brother Xuan… this is not working. Let me cover the rear," Li Qiuyang whispered through gritted teeth to Li Xuanxuan, whose face looked ghastly.

"No need."

Though his mana was nearly depleted, Li Xuanxuan gripped the jade pendant inside his robe tightly, boiling with anger as he thought to himself, According to this pendant's guidance, Qinghong is just a li away. I'll show you the consequences of bullying a Li Family member!

Seeing Li Xuanxuan's determined tone, Li Qiuyang silently followed him.

Qi Cultivators were extremely fast. They had been running for only a few breaths before a woman appeared ahead.

The woman seemed to be in her late teens, clad in bright white jade armor that shimmered with an azure light. Her almond-shaped eyes were filled with anger, tinged with a hint of purple. She held a spear, its tip pointing downward.

She had an attractive face that exuded a heroic aura. The ribbons on her jade armor fluttered in the wind. Her hair was simply tied up in a ponytail with a plain jade hairpin and her jet-black hair flowed freely in the wind.

"Lady Qinghong!"

Li Qiuyang, seeing hope in despair, was overjoyed. He finally understood the source of Li Xuanxuan's confidence earlier. They staggered to her side, breathing a sigh of relief.

The devil cultivator's face darkened, intimidated by Li Qinghong's imposing presence. He slowed down but upon realizing she was only a mid-stage Qi Cultivator, he laughed mockingly.

"Damn, these cultivators look prettier one after the other… with weak cultivation but such grand airs. One might think she is an immortal general!" he sneered.

Noticing her impressive artifacts, he remained unafraid. He had killed many and knew that the cultivation methods of Jiangnan's families and rogue cultivators were mostly rubbish that did not use pure qi and not worth worrying about.

His own cultivation came from techniques passed down by powerful devils, comparable to Grade Four immortal techniques of Jiangnan. He sneered and shouted, "Little female cultivator, you—"

Before he could finish, Li Qinghong lunged forward, her jade armor jingling. A bright purple spear shadow flowed like a dragon, striking in an instant.

The devil cultivator swallowed his words right away, raising his hammer to block the incoming attack. The spear, crackling with bright purple lightning, transformed into a dragon, smashing against the blood-red hammer with a loud bang, emitting a brilliant purple spark.

BOOM!

The devil cultivator felt a surge of annihilating thunder force travel through his hammer. His dharma artifact emitted a series of mournful wails, and a flash of lightning burst between his palms, releasing tendrils of black smoke. His face quickly turned pale.

Li Qinghong knew this place was not suitable for a prolonged fight and preferred a quick resolution. She immediately drew her Duruo Spear, seizing the opportunity of her opponent's arrogance. She launched the Fei Family's ultimate technique—the Dragon Reflection.

For some reason, the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow talisman qi within her surged upon seeing this devil cultivator. Dark red light flowed from her elbow to the spear, adding extra power and might to her weapon. The thunderous dragon-like shadow struck, causing a tremendous thunderclap that left the devil cultivator at a severe disadvantage.

"A thunder cultivator?!" the devil cultivator groaned, his hands dropping powerlessly. He felt his cultivation dwindle, and even his dharma artifact slipped from his grip, clattering to the ground.

Panic-stricken, he wailed loudly, "When did Jiangnan produce such a powerful Dao lineage?!"

Abandoning his dharma artifact, he whipped up a blood-red whirlwind and hurriedly fled into an alley.

"Only an idiot would fight her with all these treasures lying around! Whether I can win or not, my cultivation is already half gone!"

Specialized in escape techniques, the devil cultivator disappeared at the end of the alley in the blink of an eye, leaving his hammer on the ground.

Li Qinghong watched him go with a smile, unhurried. Her delicate hand twirled the spear and rested it behind her. With her other hand, she crafted a talisman in the air, emitting mysterious purple patterns.

Bzzzt... bzzzzt…

The thunder talisman formed before her, glowing brightly. The Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique she practiced was ancient and profound with several secret techniques attached to it, this being one of them.

Li Qinghong chuckled softly, flicking the talisman like a meteor after the fleeing devil cultivator. Without waiting for the result, she picked up the hammer and calmly turned to her uncles, saying softly, "Uncles, we should leave quickly."

Li Xuanxuan and Li Qiuyang were awestruck by her spear's power, nodding hastily. The three of them took off, flying just a few chi before a loud explosion sounded from the market.

BOOM!!

Purple lightning erupted, and black smoke rose. Several screams and curses ensued, with a few red lights and demonic smoke shooting up. Li Xuanxuan and the others ducked instinctively, even the monkey looked terrified and distanced itself from her.

Hearing the commotion, Li Qinghong calculated their next steps. Realizing her brother Li Yuanyun was missing, her heart sank.

"Uncle… where is Brother Yun?" she asked softly.

Li Xuanxuan and Li Qiuyang exchanged glances, unsure of how to respond, leaving only the sound of their sighs. Li Qinghong understood immediately and flew on in silence.

On the Guli Road.

Li Yuanjiao and his group waited for a while, chasing away some scavenging rogue cultivators before seeing Li Qinghong approach with the others. He hurried to meet them, staring at Li Xuanxuan's condition in shock.

"Father?!"

Li Xuanxuan raised his head, his left leg crooked and dangling. He looked emaciated and withered, his eyes half gray and half white. He gave a weak smile and managed to croak out softly, "Jiao'er!"

Though Li Yuanjiao had minor grievances with his father, he still cared deeply for him. He quickly supported him, asking gruffly, "What... happened to you?!"

"Ah!"

Li Xuanxuan, despite his haggard appearance, was filled with the joy of survival, unable to hide his glee. He exclaimed with a hint of pride, "Nothing I have done in my whole life compares to what I have achieved in this past hour!"

Li Xuanxuan used to think of himself as mediocre and incompetent. Reflecting on the multiple times he had skirted the edge of death, he could not help but feel a bit of pride in himself, his eyes brimming with tears. He thought to himself, It must be Second Uncle's spirit in heaven protecting me! It must be his accumulated virtue...

At this moment, Li Xuanxuan deeply understood why Li Tongya had handed down the River Crossing Torrential Step and the accompanying Blood Escape Technique, insisting that the direct lineage must practice them diligently.

Without these two secret techniques, he would have perished at who knows where. As these thoughts crossed his mind, tears began to trickle from his eyes, burnt gray by the fire.

Everyone was deeply moved, and for a moment, no one remembered Li Yuanyun. Only Li Qinghong, who clutched her spear, wept silently. Li Yuanjiao, feeling distressed, handed his father over to Xiao Guiluan who was skilled in healing, and comforted him for a while longer before they all returned home together.

On Lijing Peak.

Li Yuanjiao and his group returned to the peak, sending Tian Youdao and An Zheyan off, one to Xianyou Peak and the other back to Cloud Crowned Peak to survey the situation and gather news. Li Yuanjiao personally helped Li Xuanxuan into the cave dwelling to treat his injuries while the remaining cultivators returned to their respective peaks.

Li Yuanping hurried up to check on Li Xuanxuan, personally tending to him for a while. Li Qinghong called over Li Xicheng and Li Xijun, informing them of what had happened to Li Yuanyun, and they waited for the chaos in the marketplace to subside before they could search for his remains.

The two brothers, grieving their father's death, were naturally filled with sorrow. Li Qinghong, having experienced numerous life-and-death separations herself, understood their pain the most and did not allow them to dwell on it. She gave them heavy and tedious tasks to occupy them before hurrying down the mountain.

The greatest loss in the disaster at Cloud Crowned Peak's marketplace was naturally borne by the Xiao Family. As Li Xuanxuan lay unconscious and recovering, Li Yuanjiao and Li Qiuyang estimated that the Xiao Family had probably lost dozens of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators and about ten Qi Cultivators.

The loss of these ten Qi Cultivators was not significant, as most were external and guest cultivators of the Xiao Family, with few true Xiao Family members. However, the loss of those dozens of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, including some true Xiao Family heirs sent down to gain experience, was substantial, and it was uncertain how many had escaped.

As for the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Chen Taojing, who fought against four opponents, although protected by the Boundless Ocean, it was easy for him to defend himself but hard for him to escape, thus he was likely dead.

Next were the various families of Lixia Prefecture and the rogue cultivators in the marketplace. Most of the families in Lixia Prefecture were vassals of the Xiao Family, also suffering losses in this disaster.

The Xiao Family had a significant influence, controlling two-fifths of Lixia Prefecture. Most of the remaining families were directly or indirectly controlled by the Xiao Family. Even the families on the eastern shore of Moongaze Lake, bordering Lixia Prefecture, were mostly under the Xiao's control, and many had suffered losses in the marketplace attack.

"As for the rogue cultivators, this disaster might have severed many lineages..." Li Yuanjiao sighed inwardly, puzzled. "But the Xiao Family is an important ally of the Azure Pond Sect, and the devil plague is said to be the dogs of the Azure Pond Sect… How could the Xiao Family be caught off guard and bitten so hard by the devil cultivators?" he continued, muttering to himself.

He stroked his sword at his waist, murmuring quietly, "Either the Azure Pond Sect has fallen out with the Xiao Family, or the devil cultivators have gone rogue... or perhaps someone from the three sects and seven gates interfered, altering the overall situation."

Recalling the hints given by Yuan Tuan when she visited the Li Family, Li Yuanjiao dismissed these speculations. "If the devil cultivators spread out in Lixia Prefecture, it will be our Moongaze Lake that suffers," he mumbled, understanding the situation.

Feeling anxious, he wondered whether to take another pill to break through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm when the stone door in front of him rumbled open, interrupting his thoughts. Li Xuanxuan hurried out.

Li Xuanxuan had changed into a clean robe and most of his burn scars had healed, though his eyes still had a grayish hue. He looked emaciated and haggard, lacking his former solemn and dignified appearance.

"What about that monkey?!"

Li Xuanxuan's first question upon waking was about the obedient spirit beast he had brought back, causing Li Yuanjiao to smile wryly.

Turning to a nearby family soldier, he gave a command.

"Go bring that spirit beast here."

Li Yuanjiao watched Li Xuanxuan eagerly, who had been the head of the family for many years. Li Xuanxuan understood the unspoken request and happily took off the storage pouch from his waist, saying with a smile, "Let's see what we have gathered!"

The family's finances had been in poor shape for many years, so both Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanping were keenly interested in what Li Xuanxuan had managed to collect during the disaster at the market. They both nodded eagerly.

Rustle…

Li Xuanxuan reached into the storage pouch and poured out a stream of treasures, most of which he had taken from the storage pouch of the dual-wielding cultivator. The rest included a few robes and some pills.

The dharma artifacts were all of the Qi Cultivation Realm. There were four low-grade and inferior-grade artifacts, which were not worth mentioning. The highlight was a medium-grade artifact, a large oval-shaped earth-yellow shield called the Six-Stone Cloud Plate, a well-crafted item known for its sturdiness.

As for how they knew its name and origin, the shield's edge had a small inscription on it that said, "Six-Stone Cloud Plate, medium grade, Yuanwu Peak, forged by Yu Muxian."

"This..?!"

Both men were rendered speechless by the discovery. It was the first time they learned that the term medium grade referred to the mid-stage of Qi Cultivation Realm within the sect.

Li Yuanjiao hefted the Six-Stone Cloud Plate, finding it light and handy, and remarked, "It is indeed the work of an old acquaintance… Yu Muxian does have some skill indeed."

"After all, it is from the long-lost Molten Metal Cave technique," Li Xuanxuan said quietly as he heard many rumors in the market. He stored the Six-Stone Cloud Plate away and brought out a pair of twin blades.

These twin blades were also medium-grade, and they were flat and thin. Without the devil cultivator's mana, they showed a faint blue-green hue. They examined them for a while but found no signature, indicating they were not from the three sects and seven gates.

Li Yuanjiao swung the blades, which emitted a thin blue blade qi. It was thinner and sharper than sword qi, requiring specific skills to wield it properly.

"Let's call them Azure Blades."

The Li Family's collection of Qi Cultivation Realm artifacts was limited, with none of medium grade until now. The Azure Blades were a pair of artifacts, significantly increasing their value. Naturally, Li Yuanjiao carefully noted them down and stored them away, considering their potential future use.

The form of each dharma artifact determined the reach and range of its qi and aura, each with its own characteristics. Having a variety of different weapons in the family's repertoire was greatly beneficial.

"There is also the large hammer that Qinghong has. I wonder what grade it is," Li Xuanxuan said thoughtfully. After sorting through the dharma artifacts, he set aside the pills and picked up a jade slip from the table, marveling at it.

"It is strange that this devil cultivator carried his legacy so openly. Perhaps he had no fixed residence and nowhere else to store it," he mused.

Li Yuanjiao scoffed and offered a different perspective.

"If not for this, how could devil cultivators grow so rapidly in Jiangnan? They probably copied countless copies and spread them widely. It is no wonder they have several copies in their storage pouch!"

Li Xuanxuan found this explanation reasonable. He had seen the bizarre resilience of devil cultivators with their numerous backup plans, unafraid of damaging their bodies or their cultivation. Many rogue cultivators, unable to resist temptation, naturally turned to the devil cultivation in droves.

He placed his spiritual sense into the jade slip, and a few large characters appeared in his mind: Blood Dharma Manual. Annotated by Anonymous. Part One.

Li Xuanxuan dared not delve deeper, merely noting the title mentally. He was puzzled and mumbled, "Blood Dharma Manual... Why does this name sound so familiar?"

Blood Dharma Manual...

Li Xuanxuan pondered for a moment and vaguely remembered hearing Li Tongya mention this cultivation method before. It seemed to be a method from the Golden Feather Sect, with the first volume marked as Grade Four, containing only the Qi Cultivation Realm section.

"It appears that even among the devil cultivators, they use cultivation methods to control and threaten each other. After all, devil cultivators are selfish. Without such control over their cultivation paths, they would have scattered long ago..."

"It should be more than that." Li Yuanjiao paused slightly and contemplated for a moment. Not all devil cultivators had hopes of breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. There must be other connections or methods of control among these devil cultivators.

"It is not surprising that the three sects and seven gates have devil cultivation methods... But finding a Golden Feather Sect method on a devil cultivator within Azure Pond Sect's territory is interesting. Could it be that Azure Pond's devil cultivators have secretly defected to the Golden Feather Sect?"

Li Xuanxuan was filled with doubt, and he murmured, "Or perhaps... The devil plague was something both the Golden Feather Sect and Azure Pond Sect tacitly approved of or even intentionally facilitated. But if that is the case..."

"What good would that do?" Li Yuanjiao asked.

He was all dressed in black and stared intently at his father, puzzled as he continued, "The clans and rogue cultivators have been supporting Azure Pond for years! To allow them to be slaughtered by devil cultivators just like that doesn't make sense... Azure Pond would have to send people to re-establish control next year, and areas ravaged by the devil plague would be desolate for decades. Small families and rogue cultivators would take nearly a century to grow again... It is like giving away their egg-laying hens for others to enjoy!"

"Maybe... the devil plague has another purpose."

Li Xuanxuan shook his head, shifting his thoughts as he read through several black jade slips one by one.

There were escape techniques like the Sacrificial Blood Escape, likely the blood wind the devil cultivator used to escape, a reincarnation method Belly Ghost Infant, and a method to convert from immortal to devil cultivation, Blood Conversion Scripture...

In total, there were five techniques. They all required human blood, spiritual energy, resentment qi, and human heads—all of which were not good things. The two only read the summaries to gain a rough understanding of the devil cultivator's secrets.

Devil cultivators also started from the Embryonic Breathing Realm, but instead of immediately progressing to the Qi Cultivation Realm after condensing the six chakras, they combined them into what was known as a Diverse Mansion.

Once this Diverse Mansion was formed, the Juque Court, Shenyang Mansion, and Qihai Acupoints would be merged, and their body ceased to be the basis of cultivation. Instead, it became something like a boat on a sea of suffering in Buddhism cultivation.

The intricacies of this method were profound and mysterious, seemingly possessing a strange power that tried to draw the reader's spiritual sense into it, compelling them to follow the outlined cultivation path. Fortunately, this power was not strong, and the two quickly regained their senses after a moment of confusion.

Li Xuanxuan, knowing he did not have strong willpower, did not dare delve deeper and quickly released his grip on the jade slips.

"The Diverse Mansion... so the term Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace Technique refers to this..."

Li Yuanjiao had also heard about it when Mu Rongxia ventured south, mentioning something about nurturing a human head in the belly, though it was slightly different. In any case, cultivation paths varied greatly, making it hard to fully comprehend them.

Just recently, when I went to Cloud Crowned Peak Market, the four Foundation Establishment Realm devil cultivators surrounding it radiated the glow of immortal foundations... What does that mean then?

As Li Yuanjiao was busy pondering these thoughts, Li Xuanxuan silently picked up the black jade slip titled Blood Conversion Scripture.

CRACK!

With a squeeze, Li Xuanxuan crushed the jade slip and put away the remaining four. He turned to Li Yuanjiao and instructed, "Store these in a secret chamber. Having these methods as references will ensure our younger generations won't be caught unprepared when facing devil cultivators."

Li Yuanjiao nodded then picked up a jade bottle from the table, examining it carefully. The bottle was slightly larger than a typical pill bottle and was pale blue in color.

Using his spiritual sense to probe inside the bottle, he found it contained clear, cold spirit water with a faint black hue, about half a bottle's worth. It swirled as if it were a single entity, emitting waves of coldness that made Li Yuanjiao shiver.

He murmured softly, "Spirit water of heaven and earth..?"

Li Xuanxuan took it from him hurriedly and shivered from the cold. Though he had seen many spirit items in the market over the years, he had never encountered spirit water of heaven and earth.

"Perhaps it is? Or maybe it is some special kind of spiritual qi of heaven and earth..." he wondered aloud.

Seeing Li Yuanjiao carefully storing it away, he quickly added, "Better place it in the clan's vault just in case."

The remaining pills were scattered and few were usable. There were two blue bottles: one containing blood qi and the other containing resentment qi, roughly the essence of over a thousand people. There were also some heads and organs of Qi Cultivators, used for spellcasting, which they quickly buried.

Not knowing how to handle the two blue bottles, they decided to store them away for now. The thirty-odd Spirit Stones were the real prize, bringing Li Yuanjiao great relief.

The devil cultivator's loot was quite substantial, considering that typical Qi Cultivators carried only five or six Spirit Stones. This one had thirty-five, which was enough to keep the Li Family afloat for the next five years.

"It is a shame we cannot keep the storage pouch... It must be quite valuable with such a large space! The devil cultivator did not seem that powerful, I wonder where he stole it from..." Li Xuanxuan lamented.

Storage pouches were the easiest to tamper with, and even the pouches of the direct Li Family members had traps set within them. Given the urgency of the situation, he had not considered the pouch's quality and did not dare to keep it.

After dividing the spoils, both were in high spirits. Some clan guards arrived, followed by an old monkey about five chi tall, with a face full of wrinkles and intelligent eyes, silently bowing and looking up at Li Xuanxuan gratefully.

The old monkey had healed and was now free of the fire poison. Li Xuanxuan noticed its advanced age now that it was clean and groomed well enough. Washed clean of soot, its fur was snow-white. It was short and only reached up to Li Xuanxuan's chin.

"If I may I ask..." Li Xuanxuan hesitated, unsure whether to address it as a fellow Daoist or senior. He noticed that the monkey's throat seemed damaged, and was only able to make sounds. He asked gently, "What is your name?"

The old monkey shook its head, pointed to Li Xuanxuan, and then to its own forehead. Li Xuanxuan seemed to understand and asked, "Fellow Daoist, would you like to stay with us, the Li Family?"

The old monkey nodded repeatedly. Li Xuanxuan was overjoyed. This monkey, a Qi Cultivator at the fourth heavenly layer who likely understood medicine and spirit plants, was a valuable addition to his family.

"Well then, you shall be part of our family from now on and take our surname," Li Xuanxuan said tentatively.

The white monkey nodded, opened its mouth, and spat out a jade pestle. Li Yuanjiao, watching Li Xuanxuan accept it, was also delighted and commented, "The Wanglin Blossom on Mount Huaqian has yet to sprout. Maybe it could help."

Li Xuanxuan agreed and explained the situation to the monkey, then ordered a guard to escort it to the mountain. Turning back to Li Yuanjiao, he smiled and said, "Do not be fooled by those flashy dharma artifacts. This old monkey is far more valuable than them! Tomorrow, we will have it learn to write, record its knowledge and techniques, and our clan will gain another legacy."

"That's a brilliant idea, Father," Li Yuanjiao praised. He also had the same idea. He picked up the green jade pestle and mortar, both low-grade artifacts but valuable as a set.

He thought for a moment before saying, "These shall be named the Jade Pestle and Jade Mortar."

Li Xuanxuan's mouth twitched, realizing his son's lack of creativity in naming for the very first time. He shook his head and remarked, "I'm sure Guiluan is the one who named Xizhi, yes?"

"Yes," Li Yuanjiao replied, puzzled by his father's sudden question. Li Xuanxuan merely smiled and continued shaking his head in amusement.

Li Xuanxuan recuperated in the cave dwelling for several days. While waiting for news from Cloud Crowned Peak, Li Yuanjiao decided to stay on Mount Lijing and learn about family matters from his father.

Li Xuanxuan started from the death of his father, Li Changhu, speaking for two full days. Just then, a clan guard reported that Tian Youdao and An Zheyan had returned.

Tian Youdao, who broke through to the Qi Cultivation Realm at sixty, now looked like an old man, dressed in a gray robe. He was sent to check on the situation at Cloud Crowned Peak.

Cupping his fist solemnly, he reported, "Chen Taojing fought against four enemies, holding out for half a day before finally dying of exhaustion. Before his death, he shouted, The Great Ling Dao lineage is no more, shaking the heavens with his voice."[1]

Li Xuanxuan and Li Yuanjiao exchanged glances, both feeling a sense of foreboding. Tian Youdao continued in a serious tone, "With his death, the green water floated over Cloud Crowned Peak like rain and mist. The smoke rolled southward, carrying a group of devils with it."

"Southward?"

They both relaxed slightly. As long as the devils did not scatter across Lixia Prefecture, it was a good thing. Li Yuanjiao whispered, "Southward probably means toward places like Mushroom Forest Plain..."

This made the actions of these devil cultivators particularly suspicious. Originally gathered from places like Mushroom Forest Plain, they attacked the Xiao Family's market and then immediately returned home, clearly showing that they were targeting the Xiao Family.

After Tian Youdao finished his report and left, An Zheyan hurriedly approached. Though his personality was still rather carefree despite experiencing great ups and downs, he spoke in a brisk, fiery manner.

"Reporting to the Family Head! The great formation on the Xiao Family's Xianyou Peak was active for six days, isolating them completely and making us wait anxiously. When the formation finally lifted, the Xiao Family members only came out to lead us inside. We met with Young Master Guitu, who said that despite the attack, the Xiao Family suffered no major losses, only losing two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. The Daoist Master has returned to the peak, so there is no need for concern."

"So the Daoist Master has returned..." Li Yuanjiao waved him off. He was unable to discern how much of Xiao Guitu's words were true, but knowing that the Xiao Family was their backing, they had to believe it regardless.

"Let us just wait and see..." Li Xuanxuan muttered.

After An Zheyan left, the old monkey eagerly came forward. It communicated with Li Xuanxuan through gestures, and he finally understood the issue with Wanglin Blossom.

"The spirit spring on Mount Huaqian is insufficient; it cannot provide enough spiritual energy..." Li Yuanjiao repeated.

He remembered Wang Xun's remark about the fragility of the Wanglin Blossom. The spring on Mount Huaqian was clearly not enough to sustain this spirit root. After thinking it over, he suddenly said, "Among the eastern shore families... The Rui and Pu families near us seem to have a spirit spring, right?"

Sending troops to the eastern shore was already part of Li Yuanping's plan. It would resolve internal conflicts, tribute collection, and uphold righteousness, as those families used commoners as ingredients for their medicines.

"Given this, we must deal with those families." He sent word to Li Yuanping. Since the devil cultivators hadn't headed west, Li Yuanjiao didn't rush to consume the pill. Instead, he focused on cultivating, aiming to break through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm before the year's end.

With the market destroyed, Li Xuanxuan could not return, so he took advantage of the insights gained from his near-death experience to go into seclusion and cultivate. Li Qiuyang, having not spent time with his family for years, went home.

————

It was snowing heavily at the end of the year.

Snow was rare in the past two years, making this year's end special. Perhaps it was meant to honor those who perished in the recent calamity as it fell even more heavily.

The world was blanketed in white. Li Yuanping stood on a high watchtower, looking down at the troops below, who were restless and shivering in the cold winter.

He brushed the snow off his clothes. Beside him stood Li Ximing, who was already nine years old and at the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Wrapped in fur, he accompanied his father in the snow.

Li Yuanping's face remained pale, but compared to the past two years, it had become more withered, and his hair was slightly graying. He had dyed it black on purpose, which made him look a bit younger at least.

As the devil cultivators came and went, countless lives were lost along the way. It took the Li Family several months to gather information. Some said these devil cultivators had wandered to the territory of the Purple Smoke Gate, while others said they roamed the Mushroom Forest Plain.

It is the Yuan Family who should be worried, Li Yuanping thought to himself. Having dealt with the affairs of Mount Yue recently, he took the opportunity to settle the matters at home while the devil cultivators had yet to march toward Moongaze Lake.

This included his long-contemplated plan to deploy troops to the eastern shore and bring order to the chaotic families there.

"Family Head, it is time."

A youthful voice brought him back to reality. Before him stood Li Xicheng, clad in armor and holding a long spear. The experiences of recent years had matured him, making him more capable in both speech and action.

"Yes," Li Yuanping nodded, looking down once more at the troops below. They had been standing in the heavy snow for a while, appearing lethargic. The other four contingents had already set out, leaving only this one to depart.

Having received the order, Li Xicheng hurried down from the high platform and mounted his horse. The heavily armored horse beneath him had a cultivation level higher than his own and stood quietly in the snow.

"Hyah!"

Cold snowflakes scattered as he spurred his horse forward, leading the group of young soldiers through the snow-covered forest. He could not shake the confusion in his heart.

The eastern shore families are weak... With just one Qi Cultivator and a few Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, it would be an easy task. Why bother using the clan's younger members as soldiers? Isn't it unnecessary?

This time, the Li Family mobilized over five thousand people, divided into five groups. The other four groups were composed of clan soldiers, but due to a lack of manpower, Li Xicheng's group included young members of the clan, led by himself.

Maintaining a steady pace through the forest, Li Xicheng could not understand the clan's intentions. The snow fell softly, and his thoughts wandered.

The Family Head said it was to rectify the clan's customs, hence using the clan's young members as soldiers... But there had been no prior training, and suddenly we are marching through the snow at night. What use could it serve..?
𝚏𝗿𝗲𝐞𝚠𝕖𝐛𝗻𝗼𝐯𝕖𝚕.𝚌𝗼𝗺

The more he thought about it, the more puzzled he became. This recruitment felt abrupt, almost like rounding up criminals, forcefully dragging the young members along. Most of them had bad records.

Suddenly, realization dawned upon him. Looking back at the soldiers trailing a dozen steps behind him, he gulped silently.

"Perhaps... they are not needed at all..."

1. Just my guess here, the Great Ling Dao lineage probably refers to the Lingyu Gate's lineage as the River One Qi Technique Chen Taojing cultivated originated from there. ☜




# Chapter 391: The Rui Family

Li Xicheng wandered in the forest for a whole day. The clan soldiers complained endlessly, feigning illness and refusing to move. Li Xicheng continued on his own, with only about forty percent of the troops remaining, until they finally reached the hills bordering the Li Family's territory.

These hills contained a Qi Cultivation Realm spirit jade mine, jointly controlled by five Embryonic Breathing Realm families who mined for the Xiao Family, known as the Five Spirit Jade Families.

A few more li brought them into the territory of the Rui Family, which bordered the Li Family. There, they saw two small fields of Spirit Paddies. The remaining soldiers immediately scattered, jumping into the fields to pull up the paddies, leaving only a hundred or so following behind him.

"These are Spirit Paddies!" one of the soldiers shouted jubilantly.

The four previous groups of clan soldiers had passed by without touching the Spirit Paddies, but now it was being trampled on and destroyed in the blink of an eye. Li Xicheng reined in his horse and shouted a few reprimands.

Although Li Xicheng cherished the talented members of his clan and often provided them with money and food, he had no sympathy for these wastrels who tarnished the family's reputation. He continued riding along the narrow path, thinking to himself, The lazy and foolish ones already ran off on the way here. Now we have gotten rid of a batch of greedy and foolish ones, and what remains are...

As he was contemplating, a group of soldiers came forward, respectfully reporting, "Young Master, the formation has been broken. Please ascend the mountain."

Li Xicheng nodded and surveyed the terrain, then spurred his horse forward, wondering aloud, "With such a large spirit jade mine, why is the local earth vein and spiritual energy so impoverished?"

The spirit fields here were so poor that even the humblest Li Family member would not bother planting them. Yet, the Rui Family used them for growing Spirit Paddies. It was evident that the spiritual energy here was severely lacking. Li Xicheng thought to himself, This land probably takes seven or eight years to mature a single crop... No wonder the Five Spirit Jade Families haven't produced a single Qi Cultivator in all these years!

At Rui Family Peak.

The grand formation on Rui Family Peak had long since collapsed, not even broken by the Li Family. Chen Mufeng had symbolically attacked a few times, shouted out the Li Family's name, and the Rui Family had hastily opened their formation.

Li Xicheng, remembering his family's instructions, first went to check the spirit spring at the mountain's peak.

The spirit spring on Rui Family Peak was a pool of green jade. It was slightly chilly, and the spiritual energy content here was slightly lower than that of the Li Family's Mount Huaqian. He filled a small jade bottle with it to take back for examination.

After handling the most important matter, Li Xicheng finally crunched through the snow and entered the Rui Family's main hall.

Before him stood a young man clad in armor, holding a long halberd—it was Chen Mufeng. After breaking the mountain's defenses, he had been waiting here for Li Xicheng obediently, standing in the main hall with two rows of clan soldiers, their drawn swords glinting coldly.

Chen Mufeng was a junior relative of Chen Donghe and Li Qiuyang's son-in-law and disciple. Although the Chen Family did not have many descendants with spiritual orifices, those who did possessed outstanding talent. At twenty-seven, Chen Mufeng has already condensed the Jade Capital Chakra and reached the fifth stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm.

Though he had only recently broken through and his cultivation was not yet stable, he had a thirty percent chance of reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm in the future. The Li Family valued him highly, and he was considered a rising star within the clan.

As soon as Li Xicheng entered, the Rui Family members scrambled down hastily to kneel before him, some rolling and some crawling. An old man with white hair, holding a jade seal high, bowed his head and said, "The Rui Family respectfully welcomes the great family's commander! We humbly present the Azure Seal, willing to serve as your loyal dogs and horses, forever at your service..."

This old Rui Family Head appeared to be the strongest cultivator in his family, at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, even lower than Chen Mufeng. They dared not offend the Li Family, which had a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator and many Qi Cultivators, hence they surrendered the jade seal inscribed with Under the Governance of Azure Pond Sect.
𝐟𝐫𝕖𝗲𝘄𝚎𝗯𝕟𝐨𝕧𝐞𝚕.𝕔𝕠𝐦

Chen Mufeng, who had once served as a servant in the market and later led troops to slaughter the lords of Mount Yue, had become a general. With his rich experience, he watched the Rui Family Head's lip service with disdain, remarking, "Your words are pretty, but..."

Li Xicheng sighed but did not respond to him immediately. He looked around and saw two small piles of Spirit Paddies set aside, presumably as offerings. The amount was pitiful, even less than the Li Family's regular tributes. He glanced at it and moved on.

However, what caught his eye were dozens of small, white, fleshy objects arranged on jade plates, looking quite delicate and lovely, along with five or six jade bottles filled with blood qi.

Having spent a few years in the Eastern Mount Yue, Li Xicheng had learned about various spirit items but had little exposure to the clandestine transactions among cultivators. He asked with some confusion, "What are these?"

The old head of the Rui Family brought them over to him hurriedly. The pinkish, fleshy items looked cute and delicate. He respectfully said, "These are called rice meat, something the Yu Family demanded as tribute in the past."

Li Xicheng stared at them, feeling a vague sense of unease. He waved them away, and Chen Mufeng, who already knew what it was, whispered with a grim expression, "This so-called rice meat was made from those who were fed rice, likely mortals refined through a secret method... Blood slices are just a refined term for blood qi."

Li Xicheng's face turned pale though he maintained his composure. The old head of the Rui Family, seeing their expressions, realized his flattery had backfired. He quickly stammered, "I did not know that your esteemed clan disdains these items! I beg your pardon! My name is Rui Qiongcuo... My ancestors were enlightened by the Xiao Family."

Rui Qiongcuo was trying to align himself with the Xiao Family for protection. Chen Mufeng merely threw him a glance and ignored his existence.

The Rui Family and the other families around the spirit jade mine were early vassals of the Xiao Family, mining for them. Though called vassals, they were more like mining slaves. Hence, surrendering to the Li Family was nothing to be ashamed of.

Even though the Xiao Family had not issued any official certificates, the Li Family would not annex its own supporter's vassals. Chen Mufeng, seeing Li Xicheng remain silent, also stood still.

Rui Qiongcuo was getting nervous. He knew about the attack on the Xiao Family but did not know their current status. He thought to himself, The Li Family is also supported by the Xiao Family... so maybe there won't be any problems?

As he was thinking this, another person arrived outside the hall. Rui Qiongcuo, who had not developed his spiritual sense, heard Chen Mufeng respectfully address the newcomer as Master, indicating the person was likely a Qi Cultivator. He quickly bowed his head in silence.

The newcomer was Li Qiuyang. Since these small families only had Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, it was not necessary for a Qi Cultivator from the main family to come, so Li Qiuyang was sent instead.

Li Qiuyang adjusted his robe which was still covered with snow, and appeared deep in thought, holding a light green, diamond-shaped piece of ore. He said softly, "I was ordered by the clan to investigate the spirit jade mine shared by the five families."

"Thank you, Clan Elder," Li Xicheng replied, noting Li Qiuyang's hesitant expression.

Li Qiuyang put the ore away and said sternly, "Since the Rui Family has joined our Li Family, you should adhere to our rules. You must no longer use humans as spirit materials to make rice meat or blood slices. Our family places great importance on this matter, so do not test us."

This matter was not honorable to begin with, and now that Li Xicheng had bluntly pointed it out, Rui Qiongcuo felt deeply embarrassed. He nodded repeatedly, inwardly complaining, How domineering... The Yu Family demanded blood qi as tribute, and now the Li Family bans rice meat. Each clan has its quirks, huh? But this land is so barren; without using the old and infirm as medicine... What else can we do?

Although there was a valuable spirit jade mine in the area controlled by the five families, the spirit veins and spiritual energy seemed to have been concentrated around the mine, leaving the rest of the land barren and severely lacking in spiritual energy. This made it extremely difficult for the Rui Family to grow Spirit Paddies and other spirit crops, forcing them to resort to various means to barely survive.

Seeing Rui Qiongcuo's submissive demeanor, Li Xicheng organized his thoughts and continued, "Our family head understands your situation. We are not demanding tribute from you for nothing. We permit the Rui Family to send people to our Yuting Peak to cultivate paddies and study. Our family will only take a twenty percent tax."

The old man was stunned for a moment, his eyes no longer showing his usual cunning but rather a deep confusion. He looked at Li Xicheng, somewhat dazed, and murmured, "To Yuting Peak to grow paddies...?"

Rui Qiongcuo muttered these words twice, his eyes reddening, and he quickly asked, "What kind of tribute does your esteemed clan require?"

"We only ask for the water from your spirit spring and the twenty percent tax as your tribute!" Li Xicheng declared as he waved his hand dismissively. Rui Qiongcuo still could not believe these words and stared at him in a daze.

Rui Qiongcuo was well aware of how fertile the lands of clans were and how abundant their spiritual energy was. He had once harbored greedy thoughts, but during his tenure, the Ji Family was at its peak, especially Ji Dengqi, who was particularly domineering, leaving no room for Rui Qiongcuo's ambitions.

Later, when the Ji Family was replaced by the An Family and then the Li Family came, with their White Jade Fist and Celestial Moon Sword, they were even stronger, capable of obliterating the Rui Family with a mere breath.

As for secretly selling the ores, the Xiao Family had a profound technique for detecting veins. They knew exactly how much was missing from the mine and how much was delivered. If discovered, it would lead to the extermination of the entire Rui Family.

The Rui Family had thought about escaping from this impoverished place, but the Xiao Family sent people annually to collect the ores, making them too afraid to act. They could only struggle year after year.

Now that there was hope, decades of hardship welled up instantly, and tears streamed down the old man's face.

"Thank you, young master!" he exclaimed gratefully.

Seeing the old man prostrate himself on the ground in deep gratitude, Li Xicheng was somewhat surprised.

The order was given by Li Yuanping, and he had not thought much about it. The Li Family was short on manpower, and there were still large tracts of vacant spirit fields under Yuting Peak, so it was merely a matter of renting them out instead of leaving them idle.

"That is enough."

The old man had become a kowtowing worm. Li Xicheng ordered someone to help him up. The old man's face was covered in tears, and he seemed genuinely moved.

The Rui Family's gratitude did not mean much to the Li Family, but Li Xicheng had a kind disposition. Seeing the old man's emotional state, he felt rather warm and said some comforting words. Meanwhile, Tian Zhongqing also arrived with his men.

The Pu Family similarly expressed their profound gratitude and sent two Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators.

"Let us return home then."

After settling everything and repeatedly warning the Rui Family, Li Xicheng transcribed their techniques. As expected, they were common and already present in his family, so he led his men back to their clan.

————

This expedition felt like a lot of noise for little action. In just one day, they subdued two families and returned triumphantly. The Li Family took the nearby Rui and Pu families as vassals, tying them together through land leases, which were far more binding than usual tributes.

Li Xicheng returned with over a hundred men. Over a thousand were executed by the Jade Court Guards due to disregarding military and family laws, while the rest were expelled to Mount Yue, thus purging the clan.

The charges were securely placed, so Li Yuanping did not have to argue with the clan elders and uncles. He even took the opportunity to rectify the family's moral conduct. Feeling a great burden now lifted from his shoulders, his steps were lightened.

"Though these elders and uncles are not fools, they have noticed my actions, and my reputation has undoubtedly suffered."

Although Li Yuanping had heard some insults about himself, he paid them no mind. He spent a few days appeasing the clan elders and uncles before putting the matter behind him.

Sitting at the wide desk, Li Yuanping picked up a small letter and frowned.

This letter was from An Zheyan, who was stationed at Mount Huaqian. The Rui Family's spring water had been sent over, filled into seven or eight bottles, but the old monkey had resolutely thrown each one out of the cave.

An Zheyan, chattering with the old monkey for half a day like a monkey himself, finally understood that the Rui Family's spring water was too cold and carried some metallic poison. If it were used to water the spirit root, it could potentially destroy it.

Li Yuanping was immediately covered in a cold sweat upon hearing this news, silently feeling grateful. If not for the old monkey's vigilance, they might have wasted this Foundation Establishment Realm money tree.

Mentally giving the old monkey credit, Li Yuanping pondered on whether to send someone to investigate the spring water while summoning Li Qiuyang, who claimed to have important matters to report.

Li Qiuyang, with a serious expression, took out a light green ore from his storage pouch and said in a low voice, "Reporting to the clan head, we examined the ore samples claimed to be spirit jade from the five families, and brought one back."

He handed over the ore. Li Yuanping examined it, noticing its light green hue with traces of gold. This ore was a Qi Cultivation Realm spirit item, potentially harmful to the body. Li Qiuyang, fearing it might harm Li Yuanping, had sealed it with a spell.

Unable to discern much, Li Yuanping heard Li Qiuyang say solemnly, "This is not spirit jade; it is Green Origin Copper Essence, a rare spirit item. I learned about it during a chat with a cultivator from the Xiao Family."

"Green Origin Copper Essence is a Qi Cultivation Realm spirit item that requires Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators to mine... Its cold and fierce nature harms the body. Without reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm, mining it impairs one's cultivation path and lifespan, making it increasingly difficult to break through," Li Qiuyang explained as he continued to report, "Year after year, the Five Spirit Jade Families mined it without realizing this. The copper essence also contaminated the spirit fields, damaging the spirit plants. This explains why the five families' Spirit Paddies and crops yield so poorly."

Li Yuanping felt a chill down his spine as realization dawned upon him. He set down the copper essence, nodding as he said, "No wonder the Five Spirit Jade Families have remained at the Embryonic Breathing Realm for so many years without producing many Qi Cultivators... No wonder the Xiao Family sought to enlighten other families! On one hand, the Azure Pond Sect strictly forbids cross-peak and inter-prefecture activities... This is done in order to avoid provoking the sect. On the other hand, the Xiao Family does not want to send their people to mine."

With a bit of thought, Li Yuanping's previous doubts were resolved, and he mumbled, "No wonder the spring water had metallic poison... it must have been contaminated by the Green Origin Copper Essence."

Feeling much relieved now, he asked, "Have the cultivators from the Rui and Pu families been settled?"

"They have been arranged at the Yuting Peak to cultivate Spirit Paddies," Li Qiuyang responded with a nod.

Li Yuanping then picked up a vermillion brush, wrote a few words on An Zheyan's letter, and handed it to Li Qiuyang.

"Please have this delivered to Wutu Peak, Clan Uncle."




# Chapter 393: Buzi

Azure Pond Sect, Qingsui Peak.

The small pavilion at the mountaintop had changed owners several times but still stood quietly in the snow. As the golden sun rose, radiant beams scattered all around, and a young man in a green robe sat cross-legged inside the small building, quietly absorbing the energy.

Time flew by, and Li Xizhi had been cultivating under Yuan Tuan's guidance for over a year now. The spiritual qi on Qingsui Peak was dense. He had just broken through the third stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm before coming to Azure Pond, and now he was ready to break through the fourth stage.

Creak.

Yuan Tuan appeared to have just returned to the mountain. Her clothes were neat, with tightly bound cuffs. Glancing into the pavilion, she saw Li Xizhi silently cultivating as usual and nodded approvingly.

“Xizhi is truly obedient...”

This year, Yuan Tuan had taken in another disciple, sent by the Yuan Family. Although Yuan Tuan harbored some resentment toward the Yuan Family, she still accepted the child. However, the child was unruly and unlikely to achieve greatness.

The sharp sword hung quietly on the wall was the very one used by Li Chejing back in the day. Yuan Tuan's gaze lingered on it for a moment. Li Xizhi finally awakened from his meditation, stood up hurriedly, and respectfully greeted her.

“Master! You are back!”

Yuan Tuan nodded in acknowledgement and asked, “How is your swordsmanship?”

“The sword aura has formed, but I am still far from achieving sword qi...” Li Xizhi replied with some frustration, looking quite pressured as he continued, “There are always people in the sect who come to challenge me. If it were not for the fact that you were out and locked the mountain gate, I would have been in trouble.”

Yuan Tuan smiled slightly at this.

“The Xiao Family was attacked. I went back to Mushroom Forest Plain a few days ago to settle a few things and feel a bit more at ease now. It's still chaotic out there and devil cultivators are rampant. Staying outside for too long is not wise.”

Back in the day, Yuan Tuan had managed to maintain her position on Qingsui Peak alone, carving out a path for herself and breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm all alone. Her sensitivity to the situation and observational skills were naturally extremely sharp, so she had returned quickly.

Since his mother, Xiao Guiluan, was from the Xiao Family, they could be considered his maternal family. Li Xizhi was naturally very concerned and asked eagerly, “How is the Xiao Family?”

“They are fine,” Yuan Tuan replied briefly, taking down the sword from the wall and playing with it.

The sword gleamed coldly but moved obediently in her hand. She continued, “Daoist Master Chuting underestimated the killing intent of the three sects and seven gates toward the Chen Family. He was trapped in the Eastern Sea by a scheme from Tianyuan of the Golden Feather Sect and could not return to aid. The Xiao Family suffered a moderate loss."

"The Xiao Family is a shield for our Azure Pond Sect... Daoist Master Chuting's Man On Creek is very crucial, so they dare not act rashly. This elaborate effort was merely to kill Chen Taojing," she added.

Yuan Tuan's words were startling. Li Xizhi silently took note of this, wanting to say something, but Yuan Tuan changed the subject and smiled.

“Your Li Family should be fine. I was near Cloud Crowned Peak at that time and used Azure Crest Manifestation to pray for your family members—probably your uncles and granduncles—three times, which should at least protect their lives.”

Li Xizhi was overjoyed and repeatedly expressed his gratitude.

“Thank you, Master!”

“No need to be so formal.”

Yuan Tuan's lips curled into a smile as she continued, “This is just a Dao foundation, not a divine ability. At most, it offers some small assistance and cannot be considered a significant help.”

Li Xizhi obediently said some words of praise, and Yuan Tuan seemed to be in a very good mood, enjoying the flattery. Suddenly, she asked, “Is Li Tongya no longer around?”

Li Xizhi, still overjoyed, was caught off guard by the question, and his body stiffened. He responded almost immediately, “I have not heard...”

His reaction was swift, but his body could not lie. Yuan Tuan knew immediately, staring straight at him and sighing.

“What a pity.”

Li Xizhi silently lowered his head, trying to suppress his unease. He was just a boy of fourteen or fifteen and could not deceive Yuan Tuan. Realizing this, Yuan Tuan mourned for two breaths before saying, “If Li Tongya is not dead and joined forces with Chen Taojing, they might still be able to protect Cloud Crowned Peak... From now on, more and more flaws will be revealed. I hope your father can cover his death for a few more years.”

Seeing Li Xizhi's somewhat downcast appearance, Yuan Tuan comforted him, "Do not worry. I have heard that your granduncle, Li Xuanfeng, has already taken a leave of absence at Yi Mountain City and is in seclusion to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Once he succeeds, he will be a great help."

When Yuan Tuan mentioned this, Li Xizhi had some questions that had been on his mind for a long time. Seizing the opportunity, he asked earnestly, "Master! Is there any precedent for recalling external cultivators from Yi Mountain City? If there is, how can they be recalled?"

Yuan Tuan paused slightly, showing a thoughtful expression, and replied in a low voice, "The sect has summoned cultivators before. If they are direct disciples of the sect, they usually return after a dozen years. Recruited family cultivators generally do not last more than a few years... There are precedents for releasing them, typically between fifty to sixty years, and if someone within the sect speaks on their behalf, they might be released sooner."

Li Xizhi nodded thoughtfully. Yuan Tuan pondered for a few moments, swallowing some unspoken words, then quickly changed the subject. Calculating the time, she then asked softly, "Have you decided which qi to gather for your Qi Cultivation Realm?"

Li Xizhi remained silent for a long time, his mind racing with thoughts, his heart pounding. Finally, he smiled calmly and said, "I will cultivate whichever technique has the most cultivators in the sect."

"Oh? Why is that?" Yuan Tuan asked as she looked at him deeply.

Li Xizhi replied, "With more people cultivating it, the path might be smoother."

Creak...

Before Yuan Tuan could respond, they heard a creak—the sound of the outer courtyard gate slowly opening. Both their expressions changed. Li Xizhi frowned, while Yuan Tuan's face filled with shock.

Li Xizhi, having not yet developed a spiritual sense, assumed it was a junior disciple from the Yuan Family visiting. However, Yuan Tuan's Foundation Establishment Realm spiritual sense swept over their surroundings and discovered that there was no one in the snow-covered courtyard!

"How is this possible?!"

Yuan Tuan's heart shook. There could only be one type of person who could completely escape her detection and move freely on Qingsui Peak, as if walking in their own backyard...

A Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master?!

Yuan Tuan's face changed, her shock overwhelming her like a tidal wave, momentarily causing her entire body's mana to stall. Her mind raced with thoughts.

Their expressions varied, and the footsteps outside moved like the wind. In a few strides, the person reached the front of the pavilion, casually removing their shoes and stepping inside.

Swish...

The bamboo curtain of the pavilion was suddenly lifted, and a handsome cultivator walked in, with a jade ornament hanging from his waist. Despite the smile on his face, his eyes were cold, staring directly at Li Xizhi.

Yuan Tuan, the peak master who had locked the peak and set up a formation to isolate the inside from the outside, was shocked to see the Daoist quietly enter the room. Li Xizhi was terrified and was just about to voice a question when he realized he was completely paralyzed, unable to move.

The scene before him dimmed, and Li Xizhi's gaze stiffened as he saw the horrified expression on his master's face. Alarm bells rang in his mind. In his remaining consciousness, he saw Yuan Tuan's red lips moving, forming the words Buzi.

Buzi?




# Chapter 394: Pig Demon

Li Xizhi, bewitched by Daoist Master Buzi's divine ability, collapsed onto the desk with a thud, losing all consciousness and senses, and sinking into a deep darkness. However, the Talisman Seed in his Qihai acupoint stirred, allowing him to vaguely break free from the divine ability's restraint and hear some sounds.

Yuan Tuan's voice was gentle and warm.

"Junior pays respects to the Daoist Master."

Yuan Tuan lifted her gaze, forcing herself to remain calm as she greeted the man. The green-robed Daoist in front of her simply glanced at her sideways, then sat cross-legged and picked up a jade teapot.

Gurgle, gurgle...

Emerald green tea flowed into the cup. Daoist Master Buzi did not respond immediately but poured himself some tea before saying, "Azure Crest Manifestation is indeed a high grade ancient technique. You have wasted so much time on it... We did not expect you to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, so it seems you have your own fortune. Not bad."

"Thank you for the praise, Ancestor," Yuan Tuan replied obediently.

Gentle breezes blew into the pavilion as the Daoist and the female cultivator sat facing each other. Daoist Master Buzi rolled up his sleeves, took a sip of tea, and continued, "What did you gain?"

Yuan Tuan's heart skipped a beat. She feigned ignorance, frowning as she asked, "What do you mean, Daoist Master?"

Daoist Master Buzi chuckled, his gaze sharp and his voice turning cold.

"Did you not secretly go to Cloud Crowned Peak to seek a Dao scripture? I'm just wondering which Dao scripture the Yuan Family wants... Is it the Heavenly Night Badger Scripture or Clear Clouds Scripture?"

He squinted at Yuan Tuan's submissive demeanor, pondering to himself, Azure Crest Manifestation protects the mind and spirit, and dispels disasters... I wonder how much my divine ability can influence her.

Yuan Tuan, being in the Foundation Establishment Realm, was not as easy to manipulate as Li Xizhi beside her. Daoist Master Buzi stared at her and said in a low voice, "It certainly cannot be Aged Courtly Path Scripture or River Mountain Sutra, which are beyond the Yuan Family's capability. Do not bring trouble upon yourself."

Daoist Master Buzi's words were full of warning, causing Yuan Tuan to hurriedly bow her head in apology. She was about to speak, but Buzi abruptly interrupted her.

"But the former two are also acceptable!"

He swirled his jade cup gently and said in a warm tone, "Your ancestor Yuan Licheng was brought up by me. If he could find the Clear Clouds Scripture, he may re-enter the sect as the master of Qingsui Peak and become a Daoist Master of the Azure Pond Sect after breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm."

"That was how Tang Yuanwu and Si Boxiu rejoined. Having Yuan Licheng follow their path won't a problem... This is the sincerity of our Azure Pond Sect."

Buzi put down the jade cup and, seeing Yuan Tuan's contemplative look, smiled as he continued, "Not everyone can be as resourceful as Xiao Chuting, walking along the edge of a cliff day and night. Look, despite his strength, how well has the Xiao Family been doing these past few years?"

"Thank you for the guidance, Daoist Master..." Yuan Tuan responded.

Only then did Daoist Master Buzi turn his gaze to the unconscious Li Xizhi, speaking in a low voice, "A member of the Li Family?"

"Indeed," Yuan Tuan answered.

Hearing her affirmative answer, Buzi looked at Li Xizhi with interest with an unreadable smile on his face.

"There is one more thing: years ago, Si Yuanbai claimed he himself obtained the Dao of the Supreme Yin Moonlight and gave it to his disciple Li Chejing. We thought he was foolish for not using such a valuable thing himself, but could not question him because of Si Boxiu."

"Thinking about it now..." Daoist Master Buzi paused as he stared coldly at Li Xizhi and spoke softly, "Si Yuanbai may be honest but he's not stupid. It should be the Li Family that obtained the Supreme Yin Moonlight, and decided to give it to Li Chejing with Si Yuanbai's help to cover it up."

His long fingers beckoned, and the collapsed Li Xizhi suddenly sat up, dazed and vacant-eyed. Daoist Master Buzi asked softly, "Where did the Li Family get the Supreme Yin Moonlight?"

Li Xizhi seemed bewitched by his divine ability, stammering out a story about how the Li Family had gained access to a cave dwelling on Meiche Peak, obtained the Supreme Yin Moonlight, and let Li Chejing bring it back to the sect. The logic was seamless, making Daoist Master Buzi nod slightly.

"That makes sense... A small family getting one Supreme Yin Moonlight is fortunate enough. How could they have a second one?"

Daoist Master Buzi, needing this Supreme Yin Moonlight for alchemy, tried his luck and sighed regretfully upon hearing this, murmuring quietly, "Maybe I will find another opportunity to search Moongaze Lake. Perhaps there might be more."

He rose from his seat, brushed his sleeves, and adjusted his shoes and socks under the curtain by the entrance before leaving on his own.

Yuan Tuan remained silent by the desk for a long while before slowly exhaling. She then awakened Li Xizhi, speaking gently, "Xizhi!"

Li Xizhi pretended to be confused, but with the Talisman Seed protecting him, he had been awake for a while. He had deliberately revealed some information, having heard the Azure Pond Sect's promises to the Yuan Family, and silently noted it in his heart.

————

The Li Family, Wutu Peak.

Li Yuanjiao let out a long breath, his cultivation gradually stabilizing. After months of seclusion last year, he had successfully broken through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Now, after half a year of silent cultivation, his progress was steady.

With a few more years of accumulation, he could easily break through to the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. With the help of the talisman pill, the Foundation Establishment Realm was within reach.

The past two years had been relatively stable, though there were still some devil cultivators in Mushroom Forest Plain. The number was not large, but the Purple Smoke Gate north of Lixia Prefecture began to suffer attacks from devil cultivators. The rumors seemed true; the group of devil cultivators who previously besieged Cloud Crowned Peak feared the Xiao Family's retaliation and dared not stay long, mostly moving north.

Many had died in Mushroom Forest Plain, but since it was the Yuan Family's backyard, they could not allow any devil cultivators to wreak havoc.

Yuan Licheng, the peak Foundation Establishment Realm ancestor of the Yuan Family, personally led four Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to sweep out the devil cultivators, driving out the rest, and bringing stability back to Mushroom Forest Plain.

The Li, Yu, and Fei families behind Moongaze Lake, nestled between Lixia Prefecture and Mushroom Forest Plain, were shielded by the Xiao and Yuan families and thus suffered no losses. They even gained considerable benefits.

First, rogue cultivators, fearing the devil cultivators, retreated to Moongaze Lake or to Mount Dali to establish their own Dao lineages, or temporarily resided among the various families scattered around Moongaze Lake. Some rogue cultivators, after fleeing, grew tired of wandering and submitted to the Li Family as guest cultivators.

Second, the destruction of the Cloud Crowned Market left many rogue cultivators without a place to trade their materials. With devil cultivators rampant, travel became unsafe, forcing them to sell their goods cheaply to the nearest clans.

Li Yuanjiao's half-year seclusion saw many changes in the family. Li Yuanping visited Mount Wutu to sort out the family's affairs, reporting, "In Eastern Mount Yue, there are sixty-five Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators in total. They tend to the spirit fields, yielding 1,400 jin of Spirit Paddies annually, valued at about twenty Spirit Stones along with other spirit items."

"Our own Lijing, Huaqian, Huazhong, and Yuting Peaks have over seventy Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators. After deducting wages, they produce 1,600 jin annually, valued at twenty-five Spirit Stones with other spirit items!"

Li Yuanping, looking very pleased, continued with a smile, "Our family now makes a yearly profit of forty-five Spirit Stones. Over five years, that is two hundred and twenty-five spirit stones, enough to cover the tribute to the Azure Pond Sect!"

Li Yuanping, who had racked his brains to balance the family's income and expenses, was pleased to finally see the accounts balanced. His complexion looked much healthier now.

After all, the Li Family was now a large and prosperous one, and the expenses needed to maintain it were astronomical. This wave of rogue cultivators fleeing to them had helped alleviate the burden somewhat.

Li Yuanjiao also showed a hint of joy, and Li Yuanping continued, "There are ten unrefined Qi Cultivators of Mount Yue who do not possess much combat strength... They mostly handle transportation and errands within the clan. Five family cultivators and external unrefined Qi Cultivators have also been assigned to various positions. As for the Qi Cultivation Realm, we have an additional guest cultivator, also surnamed Li, named Li Qilang. He is at the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Originally, he was running errands in Mushroom Forest Plain, but upon hearing about the Li Family at Moongaze Lake, he came over to join us."

True Qi Cultivators among the rogue cultivators were few, so recruiting one was quite a success. Li Yuanjiao did not mind and set his sword down. Li Yuanping then continued, saying, "I have already sent people to the Yuan Family to purchase the spirit springs. Although it will cost some money, we can plant the Wanglin Blossom sooner and not delay it any longer."

"Well done!" Li Yuanjiao praised, and Li Yuanping then summoned an old monkey.

The old monkey was now dressed in a Daoist robe, with shoes and socks on its feet, and a storage pouch tied around its waist. Its eyes were bright, its demeanor calm, and there was an inexplicable air of high cultivation about it.

This old monkey, with snow-white fur and neatly dressed, had learned to read and write but could not speak. It bowed respectfully and handed over two jade slips.

One was White Monkey's Travel Notes, an autobiography of the monkey demon. Li Yuanjiao skimmed through it briefly.

It turned out that this monkey demon was born in the Wu State's Mount Qingkong, originally a mountain monkey demon. It was unclear how many years it had cultivated, but it slowly gained wisdom after condensing the Profound Scenery Chakra, only to be captured and forced to grind medicine.

Later, when Qingkong Temple, which had captured it, was destroyed, it wandered to the Wu State's border and fell into the hands of the Slaughter Jun Gate. Again, it was made to grind medicine for over ten years until Slaughter Jun Gate was destroyed, and it finally ended up with the Yu Family.

The Yu Family, needing an extra pair of hands, saw its proficiency and continued to use it for grinding medicine.

"So, it is truly proficient in this field huh..."

What followed was the destruction of the market town. Li Yuanjiao skimmed through this part and then picked up the other jade slip.

This one, titled Medicine Grinding Notes", recorded the properties and conflicts of over a thousand spirit herbs. Li Yuanjiao was amazed, and at the end were two alchemical recipes of unknown origin, Jade Sprout Pill and Clear Mind Pill.
𝚏𝐫𝚎𝗲𝕨𝐞𝐛𝕟𝚘𝐯𝚎𝗹.𝕔𝐨𝗺

Both were commonly used by Qi Cultivators and were already recorded in their family's alchemy books, holding little value. However, the detailed properties of the herbs made Li Yuanjiao smile, and he exchanged a pleased glance with Li Yuanping.

As for the cultivation method of this monkey demon, it had relied on breathing exercises before the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Afterward, it used a demon cultivation method granted by the Yu Family, but due to some spell, it could not recall the details.

Li Yuanjiao comforted the old monkey, giving it two bottles of pills. The old monkey did not hesitate and accepted them, tucking the pills into its pouch and bowing deeply.

"Family Head!"

As the brothers were speaking, Shamoli quietly approached, his expression a bit strange. He whispered into Li Yuanjiao's ear, "Family head! A pig demon has arrived at the foot of the peak, dressed neatly, claiming to be a demon soldier from Vermilion Cave and is here to pay a visit..."

"A demon soldier? Here to pay a visit..?"

Li Yuanjiao was taken aback. Although he had never heard of Vermilion Cave, he immediately thought of the Foundation Establishment Realm pig demon on the northern slopes of Mount Dali and asked softly, "What is its cultivation level?"

"Peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm," Shamoli replied in a low voice.

Li Yuanjiao frowned and responded, "Invite it up."

Shamoli nodded and left. Li Yuanping, pondering thoughtfully, then said, "It must be that the pig demon has something to discuss but does not dare to come personally due to our ancestor's reputation. So, it sent a lesser pig demon as a messenger."

"Indeed..." Li Yuanjiao agreed as he gripped the hilt of his sword, speculating quietly, "I have heard some rumors. It seems that as our family rises and our territory expands, these demons, deprived of live food and often killed by cultivators entering the mountains, have grown resentful."

As they conversed in low voices, a white pig about six chi tall quickly ascended the peak. Walking on two legs, with a fat head and big ears, it looked rather comical. If not for the bone fork it carried, its ferocity as a demon would be undetectable.

"Pig Two from the demon den of Mount Dali greets the great king of the Li Family..."

The pig demon bowed clumsily, its eyes furtively glancing at the old monkey, probably wondering about its unfamiliar cultivation method. Nonetheless, it respectfully addressed them.

"Are you the messenger of the mountain pig demon?"

Demons were always bullies, fearing the strong and preying on the weak. Moreover, this pig demon reeked of the consumption of many humans, with an aura of darkness about him. Naturally, Li Yuanjiao showed no kindness, calling out sternly and glaring at the pig demon.

"Yes...yes, I am."

Despite the pig demon's high cultivation level, it was terrified of Li Yuanjiao. It moved its large head nervously, not knowing how to soften its words, and said hurriedly, "Your esteemed den has monopolized hundreds of thousands of live sacrifices from the mountains below! My lord has not had a proper meal in years..."

It turned out that although the demon den of Mount Dali forbade its demons from leaving the mountain to consume humans, this restriction only applied to demon generals and those registered in the cave. Lesser demons and ordinary beasts were generally never controlled.

Although this pig demon was registered in the den and forbidden from leaving the mountain to consume humans, it could still send minor demons out to capture some people for occasional meals. The demon den of Mount Dali was far from human governance and wouldn't strictly enforce its rules.

After all, with so many demons coming and going, it was unlikely that demons passing through human territories would not eat a person or two. However, with the rise of the Li Family, the pig demon's live sacrifices had dwindled, naturally leading to discontent.

Seeing the pig demon's fearful and cowardly demeanor, Li Yuanjiao glared fiercely. The pig demon, scared out of its wits, spilled the rest of its complaints like beans from a bamboo tube.

"Your esteemed den is the master of this land, monopolizing all the live sacrifices from the mountains below... It is understandable that our den members are not allowed to scavenge. But... your esteemed den has repeatedly slaughtered my lord's soldiers lately. This is simply unreasonable!"

Hearing this, Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanping exchanged a glance and immediately understood.

It seems rogue cultivators entered the mountains and indiscriminately killed demons, harming this pig demon's subordinates in the process...

The lesser pig demon, still trembling, kneeled on the ground and said in a low voice, "My lord hopes for some compensation in live sacrifices, just one hundred strong men."

Li Yuanjiao frowned upon hearing this and said, "There have always been rogue cultivators entering the mountains. They come for profit, kill demons, and flee. How can this be blamed on my family? Your lord is just looking for an excuse to extort us!"

He then let out a cold laugh, drawing his sword with a clang. The scales of the Dragon Coiling Pillar sword glimmered as he cursed, "Does he really think my family can be bullied so easily?"

Before the words had fully left his mouth, the Celestial Moon Slash technique flashed, slicing down toward the pig demon. Being at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, the pig demon was quick to react, it ducked and summoned a thick black mist to enshroud itself.

Clang!

The Li Family's sword technique had a fierce start. The pig demon, having been caught off guard, suffered a minor loss. The moon-white sword qi pierced through the black mist forcefully, cutting a small chunk of flesh from the greasy face of the pig demon.

"Ah!"

Pig Two screamed, clutching its face and retreating several steps, saying hurriedly, "Misunderstanding! It is a misunderstanding!"

Li Yuanjiao, contemplating leaving the pig demon to perform a sacrificial ritual for the mirror, refrained from further action given the demon's background. Nonchalantly, he picked up a cloth from the desk to wipe his sword, the Dragon Coiling Pillar, and said harshly, "Tell your great king that if he has the guts, let him send someone else to test us. But he should beware of using his pig head to test the sharpness of my ancestor's treasured sword!"

"Yes, yes, yes..." the pig demon replied sheepishly as it kowtowed repeatedly.

Li Yuanjiao then commanded in a stern voice, "See the guest out!"

Li Yuanping quickly escorted the pig demon away, speaking kindly, "Escort Brother Pig down."

After Shamoli led the pig demon away, the old monkey also took its leave. Only then did Li Yuanjiao sheathe his sword, speaking softly, "This pig demon has grown suspicious and came to test our family... We cannot hesitate at this moment. Demons always bully the weak and fear the strong."

Li Yuanping agreed, saying in a low voice, "Regardless, this pig demon is restrained by the demon den and cannot descend the mountain. Even if it wants to trouble our family, it will at most send a few Qi Cultivation Realm demons, which would fall right into our hands. That is exactly what we want."




# Chapter 396: The Calamity of Mount Yu

The pig demon stumbled out of the Li Family territory hastily, wiping the wound on his face. He flew deep into Mount Dali without a word and only then did it dare to curse out loud, "Damn dog... What kind of lousy idea was that?! Making me take that sword for nothing! At least it was not face-to-face with Li Tongya... Lucky me...!"

He did not dare hold a grudge against the Li Family but was already seething with hatred for the hyena in the demon den who had come up with the idea. He cursed all the way back.

When he arrived at the demon den, a light gray hyena eagerly greeted him, its eyes darting around slyly as it squeaked, "Pig Two! What did the Li Family say?"

Pig Two was already looking for trouble with the hyena, and here it came to him. Although he had cowered before the Li Family, he had some status in the den. Now, his eyes bulged with rage as he yelled, "Damn dog! Filthy dog! Get out of my sight!"

With that, he kicked the hyena, which was only at the early stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, sending it rolling away with a yelp. Pig Two stormed into the cave, where a burly creature with a full beard sat.

The creature was devouring something, holding a chunk of flesh in his hand. Blood dripped from his brown-red beard, making it wet and sticky. His eyes were bloodshot as he glared at Pig Two and hissed, "What did Li Tongya say?"
𝒻𝑟ℯℯ𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑛𝘰𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝒸𝑜𝘮

Pig Two immediately wilted and stammered as he recounted the events. The demon general flew into a rage, cursing, "What nerve!"

His blood-red eyes flared, and his demonic qi surged as he yelled, "How dare they wave around the flag of the Devil Gate and act like some esteemed clan! When I ruled this mountain, that Li Tongya was just a garden boy! A mere small-time cultivator at the Embryonic Breathing Realm! If it were not for Si Yuanbai, the Li Family would not even exist! And now, I send a messenger, and Li Tongya does not dare to even meet him! This is too much! Argh... This is too much!"

The Foundation Establishment Realm pig demon roared furiously. The demon soldiers below, knowing his temper, huddled silently together until he had smashed the tables and chairs and left the ground covered in blood and debris. Only then did he calm down slightly.

The gray-furred hyena, who had recently joined the den and suggested testing the Li Family, thought himself clever. He sneaked forward and whispered, "Great king! The Li Family is arrogant, why not send..."

The burly creature, his face fierce, did not wait for him to finish. He backhanded the hyena, sending him flying and scattering teeth and blood everywhere as the hyena howled in pain loudly.

"Never mention the Li Family again!" the demon general roared, and the demon soldiers, feeling as if they were granted amnesty, understood that their great king was afraid and had decided to lay low.

They exchanged glances, relieved, "At least we do not have to face those immortal swords..."

The Li Family.

Spring winds once again swept over the land, turning the lake water back to a gentle light green. Perhaps it was the season, or the ample spiritual energy that nourished it, but the Li Family's Wanglin Blossom finally sprouted.

The tender green shoot appeared fragile and weak, but it was a Foundation Establishment Realm spirit root. The Li Family treated it like a treasure, watering it with spirit spring water consistently, engraving formations around it, and burying Spirit Stones in the soil, fearing that the spirit root might wither.

Fortunately, the old monkey tended to it meticulously, adjusting the soil composition and managing the spiritual energy in the earth veins. Though the spirit root seemed unspirited, it grew day by day, much to the relief of the Li Family.

Mount Lijing.

"The Spirit Paddies are growing well this year."

Li Xuanxuan walked along the mountain path with his hands clasped behind his back. Since the market's destruction, he had become idle as all the other roles in the family had been filled, and no one dared to order him around, leaving him with nothing to do.

Apart from his daily talisman drawing, Li Xuanxuan had no other engagements, so he wandered around and spent time with his grandson.

"It is funny... In the past, when there were few cultivators in the family, these Spirit Paddies were as hard as iron. Initially, mortals had to use axes enhanced with Golden Light spell to cut it..."

Li Yuanjiao, who was walking beside him, listened to his ramblings and nodded gently. Although Li Xuanxuan was his biological father, he had grown up under the care of his elder brother Li Yuanxiu, and had little to no direct contact with Li Xuanxuan.

Because of Li Yuanjiao's background, Li Xuanxuan was also not very close to him and harbored a silent guilt toward his son. Now, as he babbled on, Li Yuanjiao noticed a trace of nervousness in his father's demeanor, so he remained silent.

This life-and-death crisis had finally propelled Li Xuanxuan to break through to the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, but his progress was as slow as a turtle's. Now at fifty-nine years old, his cultivation speed would only decrease further after sixty, and he muttered quietly, "With my aptitude, it will take more than a decade to break through to the next heavenly layer after sixty. I might as well take the talisman pill now and break through to the fifth heavenly layer to avoid trouble after sixty..."

As he was thinking about this, a cheerful voice called out from behind them.

"Grandfather! Clan Uncle!"

Li Xuanxuan turned around to see two young boys, about twelve or thirteen, walking up the mountain path. The one in front, at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, had a radiant smile that made one feel like a spring breeze. He wore a brocade robe with a green jade bead tied to his wrist, swaying as he walked.

The other, taller and more handsome with a sword on his back, appeared more reserved. He smiled and greeted, "Xijun greets Granduncle and Clan Uncle."

"Good... good!"

Li Xuanxuan happily took the hands of the two juniors, warmly asking about their cultivation progress. Li Yuanjiao watched with a smile as they chatted and laughed, making their way to the small courtyard on the mountain.

Li Yuanping sat in his seat, silently reading the letters in his hand.

The Li Family had received two letters this month. One was from Chen Donghe to the west, stating that devil cultivators had also appeared in the territory of the Golden Feather Sect, with one dead and one injured among the two unrefined Qi Cultivators who accompanied him.

The Li Family currently had many unrefined Qi Cultivators from Mount Yue, so Li Yuanping decided to send two more loyal ones over. If not for the sensitive nature of the matter, he would have sent more.

The other letter was from Li Xizhi within the sect, stating that everything was going well. He hinted at the complex situation in the Cloud Crowned Peak market and advised against investigating too deeply to avoid trouble.

He also mentioned that members of the Fei Family had joined Yuanwu Peak two years ago. A female cultivator named Fei Qingyi, though not skilled in smithing, had good talent in cultivation and had gained the favor of Yu Muxian.

"Two years ago..." Li Yuanping sighed softly. The Fei Family had been quiet for the past seven or eight years, and their joining of the sect had been tightly covered up. If not for the letter from within the sect, there would have been no news on the lake, indicating their fear of interference from the Li Family.

"Ping'er!" Li Xuanxuan called out.

Seeing his aged face appear at the courtyard entrance with the two youths cupping their fist respectfully beside him, Li Yuanping quickly welcomed them in, handing the letter to Li Yuanjiao.

Li Yuanjiao read the letter and silently pondered to himself. Li Yuanping then said, "The Fei Family has been silent these years, rarely communicating with us. Their disciples only cultivate on the peak."

Li Yuanjiao nodded and replied, "How could our family obstruct the recruitment of disciples? If they were open about it, it would be fine... Sneaking around only shows their own guilt. Clearly, this is Fei Tongyu's doing, cautious and fearful like a busy white mouse preparing for winter."

He handed the letter back to Li Yuanping and said, "Do not worry about it!"

Li Yuanping nodded and put away the letter, smiling as he said, "Brother's description is quite apt."

Li Xuanxuan, on the other hand, was reading Chen Donghe's letter with a frown.

"It is troublesome for Donghe to handle this alone... Let me go and help him," he said finally.

Li Yuanping shook his head and replied, "That pass is large, but three people collecting qi is already the limit."

Speaking of qi collection, Li Yuanping had considered sending people into the mountains to gather the mountain's spiritual qi. It would take seven or eight years to collect one portion of Minor Pure Spiritual Qi.

Minor Pure Spiritual Qi required a vast mountainous area, and the Li Family, backed by the expanse of Mount Dali, could accommodate three or four people collecting qi simultaneously.

Moreover, Minor Pure Spiritual Qi was useful not only for advancing true Qi Cultivators but also in alchemy, smithing, and talisman drawing. Each portion was worth about thirty Spirit Stones. Unfortunately, though this qi was common, it was very troublesome to collect, requiring seven years of leaping through the mountains, delaying one's own cultivation.

"Once we have more unrefined Qi Cultivators, we can send them into the mountains, bringing in additional income each year..."

Li Yuanping was calculating the profit after deducting the salaries and subsidies for these cultivators when someone hurriedly approached them.

He respectfully reported, "Clan head! Madam Qingxiao has returned to visit her family... but..."

"Qingxiao?! Quickly, let her in!" Li Xuanxuan called out repeatedly, then stopped abruptly, seeing the hesitant expression on the clan soldier's face, and asked in confusion, "But what?"

The soldier dared not hide anything and answered, "Madam is dressed in mourning clothes..."

Everyone in the courtyard was startled as they heard this. Li Yuanping paused for a moment before exclaiming, "In... mourning clothes?!"

Li Yuanjiao also turned pale and quickly reacted, asking urgently, "Is it Xiao Xian? Or Xiao Jiuqing?"

The clan soldier rushed away, leaving everyone with grim faces. Li Xuanxuan clenched the armrest and said in a deep voice, "It must be the devil plague!"

After a while, Li Qingxiao indeed arrived in mourning clothes.

Now, her face was much thinner than when she left, her eyebrows lighter, and her lips were pale. She looked exhausted, with a faint scar on her wrist. She seemed like she had been through hard times.

Li Qingxiao had left as a charming young girl, but in less than ten years, she had returned as a frail woman. Her face was pale, her eyes slightly red, and as soon as she entered the courtyard, she fell to her knees with a thud.

"Please, my save my family, clan brothers!" she cried out desperately.

She looked ashen, tears streaming down her face like broken beads. Li Yuanping could not bear to see this, hurriedly stepping forward to help her up. However, Li Qingxiao remained kneeling stubbornly.

"What happened?!" Li Xuanxuan asked with a pained voice.

Li Qingxiao, her voice mournful as she wept, began explaining.

"My Mount Yu is located at the northernmost part of the Xiao Family territory, adjacent to the Purple Smoke Gate... We suffered heavy losses during that devil plague. My husband's clan uncles and clan brothers died in battle, and many were injured or lost cultivation path..."

"Later, when the devil cultivators moved north toward the Purple Smoke Gate, they passed through Mount Yu. My husband and father-in-law were cleaning up the aftermath when they encountered the devil cultivators..."

She wept bitterly, pressing her delicate fingers against the stone tiles, closing her eyes in pain as she wept, "When the clan members arrived, both my father-in-law and husband were dead... along with more than ten relatives, their bodies never found..."

"Dammit!"

The Li Family members all mourned silently, helping Li Qingxiao up and offering her comfort and tea, though she wa not in the mood to drink.

She cried anxiously, "The main line of Jiuqing on Mount Yu is now extinct, leaving only my two young sons... But according to the Xiao Family's branch rules, the position of head must be handed over to some clan brothers!"

With tears still streaming down her face, she continued, "But Xiao Xian always worried about the malicious intentions of these clan brothers... If I give up this position, how can I face my husband? What will become of my two children in the future?!"

Li Yuanping, upon hearing these words, had a vague premonition. His face turned slightly pale, and he took a step back, speaking gently, "Sister, do you mean to say...?"

Li Qingxiao kneeled again, her face as white as snow, her lips trembling, finding it difficult to speak. She said in a low voice, "I only hope... I only hope the family can send a few loyal people to accompany me to Mount Yu... as long as they have the strength to suppress the various branches of Mount Yu..."

"You..." Li Xuanxuan also fell silent, stumbling back, caught in a dilemma.

Li Qingxiao looked around at everyone's faces, then said sorrowfully, "Qingxiao understands the difficulties of the family. I have not troubled the family in these past years... but... but... I really cannot bear to see the position of Mount Yu fall into the hands of others!"

Li Yuanjiao's face darkened as he stared at Li Qingxiao. After a long silence, he finally said glumly, "This is a Xiao Family's matter! Sister... The Xiao Family is an immortal clan of the Purple Mansion Realm... how can our humble clan interfere?"

"Qingxiao understands!" Li Qingxiao kneeled, crying silently. Eventually, she said nothing more.

Li Yuanjiao's expression changed, and he asked, "Is Senior Yuansi in the clan?"

"He has already been ordered to go to the Eastern Sea!" she responded weakly.

How could Li Qingxiao not have thought of Xiao Yuansi? She had already sent someone to the clan to look for him.

Li Yuanjiao sighed deeply as he helped her up and wiped her tears, then said in a serious tone, "Do not be anxious... There will always be a way."

Once Li Qingxiao was seated properly, Li Yuanjiao waved his sleeve and instructed, "Invite Guiluan and Qinghong to come over."

When Xiao Guiluan and Li Qinghong arrived swiftly by riding the wind and heard the news, Li Qinghong gripped her spear tightly, her brow furrowed, unable to speak.

Xiao Guiluan, though not directly involved, was much clearer-headed. She considered the situation briefly and then said softly, "Madam, the main line of Mount Yu was severely damaged and should be recuperating. Why would they suddenly act so recklessly? Xiao Jiuqing is a smart person; he would never do such a thing. Was it an order from the family?"

Li Qingxiao shook her head and replied in a low voice, "It was not that my family acted recklessly, but... Mount Yu was already mostly ruined by the previous devil plague. Countless formations were breached, with only a few intact, making it easy for them to be slaughtered... My father-in-law had foresight and found an excuse to send the women and children to Xianyou Peak, allowing me to escape this disaster."

Xiao Guiluan nodded silently. The Xiao Family was currently recuperating, with the first formations to be repaired certainly being at Xianyou Peak and the main line. The formations of the branches at Mount Yu were numerous and complicated, so it was normal for them to be delayed.

She paused, her expression serious. She then asked in a deep voice, "Did the Xiao Family eventually eradicate these devil cultivators?"

Li Qingxiao, overwhelmed by sorrow, had not rushed here immediately. She had mde many arrangements and sought help from various sources, but all to no avail. Hence, she had no choice but to return home.

She immediately replied, "This group of devil cultivators came suddenly... They entered Mount Yu through the pass, killed people, and fled north without a trace. Although the family came to the rescue, it was already too late!"




# Chapter 398: Who Is It

Xiao Guiluan asked more detailed questions while Li Yuanjiao listened silently from above, calculating in his mind. Upon hearing that the Xiao Family had not captured the devil cultivators but had instead come up empty-handed, Xiao Guiluan breathed a sigh of relief.

Li Yuanjiao raised an eyebrow and asked in a deep voice, "Are you worried that Xiao Guitu orchestrated this..?"

It was not unreasonable for the couple to be suspicious. Li Yuanjiao's brother-in-law was quite capable and ambitious, always having intentions to further align with the Li Family.

However, it seemed that Xiao Chuting had given an order, causing Xiao Guitu to abandon his plans. Over time, there had been no further movement, allowing Li Yuanjiao to relax quite a bit.

Now, fearing that Xiao Guitu's ambitions had resurfaced, it had prompted him to ask this question. Once it was out of his mouth, everyone's expressions changed immediately.

Li Xijun, who was deep in thought, gradually relaxed his sharp eyebrows and cupped his fist before speaking.

"I also think that this might be Xiao Guitu's doing... he might be trying to lure our family into taking action, giving him an excuse to intervene. If we set a precedent, the Xiao Family could interfere in our affairs whenever there is turmoil."

His straightforward explanation laid bare the suspicion, surprising both Xiao Guiluan and Li Qingxiao.

"My brother would not do that," Xiao Guiluan said after a while as she shook her head, pondering for a few moments before explaining further, "My brother is proud and always favors a righteous path. Even if he wanted to deepen his control over our family, he would not resort to such tactics. Besides..."

She paused before continuing, "If it were a deliberate scheme, he would have set an ambush at Mount Yu, waited for the devil cultivators to massacre, and then pretended to arrive late to annihilate them, killing two birds with one stone. That way, he would not damage his reputation by showing both internal weakness and external ruthlessness."

Li Yuanjiao, having had suspicions initially, now realized the inconsistency and agreed, "Exactly. The Xiao Family has suffered a loss and needs to demonstrate strength to avoid being preyed upon. This is not the time to scheme against us... Xiao Guitu would not go that far."

Li Xijun nodded lightly, though his expression remained unchanged as he replied, "I guess I have overthought it."

His unmoved demeanor made Li Xuanxuan glance sideways, wondering if Li Xijun had intentionally brought this up. Xiao Guiluan, meanwhile, had already spoken and broken the silence.

"Do not worry. Since it is not my brother's doing, there is much that can be done," she reassured.

She took Li Qingxiao's hand and said gently, "My father holds a high status in the clan and has some influence. My eldest brother, who manages the household, speaks with authority but is greedy and narrow-minded. Take some Spirit Stones and send someone to Xianyou Peak. Flatter him well and bribe him heavily; secure the position of head of Mount Yu first."

While she was speaking, Li Yuanping had already taken out over seventy Spirit Stones from a storage pouch, and said warmly, "Sister, the family's savings are here... Use them as needed."

Li Qingxiao wept as she trembled and accepted the Spirit Stones meekly. Before she could speak, Xiao Guiluan continued, "Even if my brother has no such intentions, we cannot set a precedent. I have two close friends in the clan with some influence in the Xiazhong and Dongshan branches... I will write a letter asking them to lend you a few Xiao Family cultivators to support you."

"Yes... please..." Li Qingxiao said gratefully as she kept the Spirit Stones. Xiao Guiluan then took up a brush, dipped it into the ink, and began writing.

Li Yuanjiao stepped forward and said solemnly, "I also have a Foundation Establishment Realm talisman here for your protection. It can deter minor threats."

Instead of offering sentimental words as her older brother, he shoved the talisman into her hand and began explaining how to use or not use it.

Li Qingxiao nodded and accepted the letter Xiao Guiluan handed over to her. Li Yuanjiao then said, "The family will send a caravan to Mount Yu. Stay in touch with us as the situation evolves."

"Thank you... thank you, brothers. Qingxiao has no way to repay this..."

Li Qingxiao was moved, responded gratefully, and accepted everything. She bowed deeply and said, "The grace of the family will be remembered by the lineage of Mount Yu. Once Mount Yu is stabilized, we will repay you."

With no one to preside over Mount Yu, every moment Li Qingxiao spent away increased the danger. Without any further delay, she rode her flying shuttle and took her leave.

"Mount Yu has no cultivators of significant power. With these measures, they should be able to handle ordinary threats..." Xiao Guiluan said softly as she watched Li Qingxiao depart.

"I will return to the Xiao Family too. I cannot stand aside while my family is in trouble. Besides, I need to gauge my brother's stance on Mount Yu," she added.

"Sorry to trouble you," Li Yuanjiao said affectionately, moved by his wife's dedication as he readily agreed. Xiao Guiluan smiled softly and rode the wind away.

Once she had left, Li Yuanping shook his head regretfully and said, "Xiao Xian and Xiao Jiuqing were both excellent men. What a pity..."

He had a brief acquaintance with Xiao Xian back in the day, and although it was only superficial, Xiao Xian had always seemed reliable.

Li Yuanjiao, however, had a different thought and said in a low voice, "I am afraid Daoist Master Chuting is still missing!"

Li Qinghong, who had been thinking about this matter throughout the conversation, finally spoke up.

"Brother is right. If Xiao Chuting were at Xianyou Peak, how could he allow devil cultivators to openly slaughter at Mount Yu? Xiao Guitu's claim that the Daoist Master has returned must be to pacify the people!"

Li Yuanjiao sighed, growing worried about the Xiao Family's situation. He then turned his thoughts to other matters as he said, "With the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's struggles above, how can we possibly intervene? I am afraid the devil cultivators are difficult to deal with... If they come to Moongaze Lake, our family might be in trouble."

He looked around at the remaining core members all within their family's formation, and said boldly, "The clan's immortal mirror has the power to perceive the heavens and earth, and the Supreme Yin Moonlight is extremely powerful. However, it holds a high inherent rank, and using it frequently for surveillance might be disrespectful. We must remain vigilant ourselves... The devil cultivators in Mushroom Forest Plain are scattering in all directions. Stay within the grand formation and cultivate in peace."

Li Qinghong nodded while holding her spear. She scanned with her spiritual sense and said softly, "Brother, you have reached the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm!"

Li Qinghong was more talented than Li Yuanjiao, but with the Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit talisman qi, his cultivation speed had doubled, now surpassing hers.

Li Qinghong was now only at the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, while Li Yuanjiao had reached the seventh heavenly layer. He received the talisman at twenty, and now at thirty-seven or thirty-eight, he had advanced almost one layer every two years, which was astonishingly fast.

"Yes," Li Yuanjiao replied.

When he saw the envious look on Li Qinghong's face, he continued saying, "No need to be envious... In a real fight, I might not be your match. The Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique is incredibly fierce, ancient, and mysterious. With Duruo Spear in hand, you might even wreck the devil plague."

However, Li Qinghong still had doubts in her heart. Her expression turned a little strange as she dismissed the younger generation. She then pulled Li Yuanjiao aside and whispered in a serious tone, "Brother! All these years I have been cultivating this technique, and I have been finding it increasingly extraordinary... It comes with both a thunder talisman and a thunder spell, which are both remarkable!"

She put away her spear, sat down, and continued in a low voice, "Back then, Ning Heyuan of the Azure Pond Sect fought with me. He is a direct descendant of the Azure Pond Sect, and his Heavenly Serpent Celestial Light spell is a secret technique of the Sect, yet it barely managed to hold my thunder talisman."

"Although my cultivation was slightly higher, which gave me an advantage, it shows the power of the thunder talisman. It is just a pity that it is integrated with the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique and cannot be cultivated separately," Li Qinghong explained, her eyes filled with doubt as she continued, "Grandfather always said that nine out of ten good things in the world turn out to be bad... That is why I am apprehensive."

Li Yuanjiao nodded silently and replied, "This technique was a gift from a Purple Smoke Gate cultivator whom our granduncle saved... It might not necessarily be problematic. The cultivator claimed it came from an ancient sect and he had not practiced it himself. He was a bit unreliable, so he might not have known its true value. In any case, I will write a letter to Xizhi, asking him to inquire about it within the sect."

After discussing it for a while, the two of them went their separate ways.

Xiao Guiluan rode the wind for two full days.

Given the current rise of devil cultivators, the road was unsafe. She took a detour through Mushroom Forest Plain, passing respectfully through a dozen or so immortal mountains of the Yuan Family before making a large loop to reach Xianyou Peak.

Everywhere on Xianyou Peak was draped in white cloth, and Xiao Guiluan could not help but feel deeply sorrowful as she visited various familiar old friends. Many of her childhood playmates had now become minor peak masters, and many were no longer close to her.

The Xiao Family was simply too vast, with many interests and factions. Some old friends had joined different branches and dared not speak much with her for fear of getting involved in conflicts.

Currently, Xiao Guitu was the cultivator managing the Xiao Family, elevating Xiao Guiluan's status as well. In the past, she would have had to wait a long while for her arrival to be reported, but now she was quickly escorted up the main peak with just a brief announcement.

Xiao Guitu, clad in golden armor and playing with a pair of jade rings, sat at the head of the main hall on the main peak. Xiao Guiluan walked on jade tiles, bowed deeply upon entering, and seized the opportunity to observe her brother.

Xiao Guitu looked much somber now, and was at the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. His once-smiling face had become impassive, but upon seeing his long-unseen sister, a faint smile appeared. He spoke warmly, "It is rare to see you return."

These words left Xiao Guiluan speechless. Xiao Guitu took two steps down and sat by the side of the stone steps. Only then did Xiao Guiluan notice the small holes covering his golden armor, making it unusable.
𝒻𝓇𝑒𝘦𝘸𝑒𝒷𝓃ℴ𝑣𝘦𝑙.𝒸ℴ𝘮

Xiao Guitu quietly removed his armor, saying softly, "What a coincidence... Daoist Master Buzi just left, and you arrived."

"Daoist Master Buzi? From Azure Pond Sect?" Xiao Guiluan exclaimed, instantly shocked.

Xiao Guitu tossed the armor piece from his elbow to the ground with a loud clanging sound and replied, "Yes. Since the ancestor has not returned, he has become audacious."

Xiao Guiluan stared blankly at him, her mind racing with thoughts. She could not understand why Xiao Guitu was suddenly behaving unpredictably and being so straightforward with her.

Without looking at her expression, Xiao Guitu continued, "The Li Family must have noticed as well. For something like this to happen at Mount Yu, it shows that the ancestor is not at the peak. With a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator overseeing, how could they dare to use the Mount Yu path? Now, the Yuan Family, Chen Family, and the twenty-eight families affiliated with my Xiao Family are all in turmoil, sending people to inquire and offer condolences... Everyone knows what they are really thinking."

Xiao Guiluan listened attentively while Xiao Guitu looked fatigued and said wearily, "The Daoist Master is merely trapped somewhere in the Eastern Sea... Zhang Tianyuan cannot kill him."

He stared blankly at Xiao Guiluan, seemingly making a resolution. He walked down slowly, a sincere expression as he spoke.

"The Xiao Family has helped your family a lot over the years. The Daoist Master raised your family from obscurity, and Ancestor Yuansi personally handled many matters. Regardless of whether the Li Family has a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator or the Mount Dali demon clan behind them, go to the Eastern Sea to help."

The Li Family has a Purple Mansion behind them?!

Xiao Guiluan was shocked, thinking of the Li Family members' worried expressions which did not match up to having a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's support.

She assumed Xiao Guitu had misunderstood and quickly said, "Brother! The Li Family is utterly impoverished, struggling even to have Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators! How could they have a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's protection... this... this..."

Xiao Guitu shook his head and said softly, "Just convey my words to Li Yuanjiao."

Xiao Guiluan paused, then gritted her teeth and agreed. Only then did Xiao Guitu say, "I also know about the situation at Mount Yu. Do not worry, there will not be any problems."

Xiao Guiluan felt that her brother might have misunderstood something, but seeing him so agreeable, she felt relieved and left obediently.

Xiao Guitu watched her departing figure, silently sitting on the jade steps, staring into space.

Does the Li Family have a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator behind them?

In Xiao Guitu's mind, it was a certainty. There had to be at least one extraordinary Purple Mansion Realm cultivator behind the Li Family!

In the past, Xiao Guitu had always felt uneasy about having the Li Family, a formidable force, nearby. He watched as the Li Family conquered the Mount Yue region and two other mountains, and as Li Tongya's swordsmanship astonished everyone. He tossed and turned, unable to find peace.

However, after Xiao Chuting's incident with the Wrathful Maha, leveraging Li Tongya's immunity to divine abilities to intimidate the other Purple Mansion cultivators, Xiao Chuting had returned home and pondered, gradually becoming suspicious. Furthermore, the Mount Dali demon clan staunchly supported the northern family, which quickly led to speculation.

Xiao Guitu had planned to make the Li Family a subordinate through marriage. Before any significant movement occurred, however, Xiao Chuting had summoned him to the mountain. When Xiao Chuting explained his suspicions, Xiao Guitu finally understood.

"No wonder... no wonder the Li Family could rise so rapidly within decades, effortlessly outmaneuvering other families! No wonder both Li Tongya and Li Chejing, starting from humble beginnings, could reach the Foundation Establishment Realm..."

It turned out the Li Family was a hidden asset of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator! The Li Family's meteoric rise was clearly orchestrated by some profound life divine ability. The Li Family was even likely descendants of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, hidden among the common folk, which would explain their exceptional talent!

Li Mutian was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, yet there was no trace of him in the Wu and Yue States, clearly indicating the involvement of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. When Xiao Guitu thought more carefully about the matter, he realized that only two families had caused losses to the Li Family.

Mount Wu killed Li Xiangping, and the Azure Pond Sect killed Li Chejing.

Both incidents pointed to two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators on the verge of breaking through to the Golden Core Realm! It was evident that the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters were exchanging blows, interfering with each other.

With this calculation, the vague figure behind the Li Family emerged; proficient in manipulating fate, hidden behind the scenes of some sect, at odds with the Azure Pond Sect, and at least in the later stages of the Purple Mansion Realm.

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator behind the Li Family remained hidden, and the Xiao family dared not expose them. They quietly facilitated the Li Family in the market, supporting them silently.

Now that Xiao Chuting was trapped, Xiao Guitu had nowhere to turn for help. He remembered the silent cooperation between Xiao Chuting and the Li Family's Purple Mansion Realm cultivator—one leveraging power, the other remaining hidden. Thus, he had no choice but to make a risky move and seek help from the Li Family.

"I can only hope I don't anger that Daoist Master... Guiluan is straightforward, it should be fine..." Xiao Guitu mumbled, as he could not help but worry.

Xiao Chuting had been missing for over two years now, and he had only learned from Buzi's mouth that Xiao Chuting was trapped by Zhang Tianyuan. That green-robed Daoist Master had gloated, suggesting that Xiao Chuting's situation was dire.

"Our family has broken away from the Azure Pond Sect... Now, our survival rests on you alone!"




# Chapter 400: Here Comes Buzi

Eastern Sea.

Among the four seas, the Eastern Sea was the most vast, with rolling waves and clear turquoise waters. Various demons often rode the wind and traversed the waves on the sea's surface.

The demons thrived the best in the Eastern Sea. Led by the dragon species, each established palaces deep within the sea, becoming a formidable force and lending vibrant life to the waters.

The islands were scattered like stars in the sky, and the closer they were to the Yue State's coastal prefecture, the larger and broader they became. The area was filled with rogue cultivators and sects with a significant number of devil cultivators, extraordinary beings, and shamans, making it a chaotic region.

Additionally, the Eastern Sea was home to numerous demons, where killings occurred daily. Sixty percent of the demonic materials on the mainland were harvested from the Eastern and Southern Seas. In contrast, vast regions of the mainland cultivated Spirit Paddies, which were then exported overseas, benefiting both parties for over a millennium.

The sects in the Eastern Sea also constantly thought about relocating to the mainland. In fact, many among the Yue State's three sects and seven gates had achieved the Purple Mansion Realm on the Eastern Sea before migrating inland.

Deep within the sea, after passing through layers of mysterious forbidden formations, there was an undersea cliff covered with corals, ruins, and scattered fragments of tiles.

Xiao Chuting sat cross-legged, dressed in gray, with a calm and composed expression. Facing a radiant stone wall, the wall was crystalline and clear, with lines of golden characters appearing one after another.

The perfection of Nine Arts lies in the Qingming. The three disasters and nine tribulations are bestowed by the heavens. The wind and fire of the Great Void are the essence of spirit energy...[1]

Xiao Chuting observed the words carefully, and after the text on the stone wall had finished appearing, a new line of large characters reappeared—Hunyi Golden Core Mysterious Method[2].

As the lines of small characters reappeared, Xiao Chuting watched on silently. He has been trapped here for years, staring at the stone wall every day without a hint of impatience.

"Daoist Chuting... Still unwilling to speak?"

Zhang Tianyuan, dressed in golden robes, stood with his hands behind his back and said softly, "This mysterious method is a legacy from before the ancient cataclysm... Reading it will make you forget it completely. Do not waste your effort!"

Seeing Xiao Chuting remain silent and continue staring at the stone wall, Zhang Tianyuan's brow furrowed with a trace of impatience. He said in a deep voice, "Under the Hunyi Immortal Wall, even the True Monarchs cannot investigate it. Only you and I know about this. What are you worried about?"

"By the way, which Purple Mansion Realm expert intervened during the Wrathful Maha incident?"

Xiao Chuting paused, finally looking at him and saying gently, "Daoist Tianyuan, I only met that senior once. I only know of his divine ability, nothing else."

"Ha!" Zhang Tianyuan sneered, speaking in a deep voice, "Could it be that person used a life divine ability to fight eight just to save Li Tongya's life? The Li Family is just a small Foundation Establishment Realm clan. How could they have such great influence?"

"Since he is your backer and is proficient in life divine abilities, he must have some plan of his own!" he spat.

He stared deeply at Xiao Chuting and continued softly, "Since you refuse to speak, we will continue to wait and see if that Daoist is willing to help you escape. Without your support, the Xiao Family will not last long."

"You overestimate me, fellow Daoist," Xiao Chuting said, completely unfazed by his words. He saw through Zhang Tianyuan's bluff and sat steadily, with even a hint of a smile on his face.

"We can wait, but Azure Pond cannot. If I am not mistaken, now that Chen Taojing is dead, the devil plague has moved toward the seven gates," he calmly spoke.

Speaking of Chen Taojing's death, a hint of regret flashed in Xiao Chuting's eyes as he continued, "If I am not inland, with only Chi Buzi and Yuansu, they cannot mobilize so many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. If the True Monarch's plans are ruined, not even Daoist Tianyuan can bear the responsibility."

Xiao Chuting's words darkened Zhang Tianyuan's face, and his golden robe trembled slightly as he said sternly, "You are quite calculative... No wonder you hid for five years, waiting for this moment...! Fine... Fine!"

Zhang Tianyuan gritted his teeth as he continued, "First targeting my Zhang Family, then using Azure Pond Sect... Fine! Take your perilous path and see how long you can hold out!"

He then swung his sleeve, his figure disappearing into the distance. This place was filled with forbidden formations left by the ancient Immortal Sect, preventing entry into the Great Void. Even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators had to fly openly.

After Zhang Tianyuan left, Xiao Chuting also stood up, his hands behind his back. To protect that hidden pawn of the Li Family for the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master, Xiao Chuting had expended considerable effort, using clues to point all suspicion toward himself. Now, he had thoroughly offended Zhang Tianyuan.

"I hope that senior... has his own plans arranged." Xiao Chuting muttered to himself.

————

"Chen Mufeng."

Li Yuanjiao picked up the small letter in his hand silently, reading its contents. He looked at the young man half-kneeling before him and praised, "Not yet thirty and already at the peak of Embryonic Breathing Realm... truly a genius!"

Chen Mufeng, with lowered gaze and head, responded loudly, "Clan Brother is the one with a profound affinity for the Dao and is naturally gifted in cultivation! Mufeng is but a firefly's light, incomparable to the brilliance of Clan Brother's moonlight."

Chen Mufeng's words were sincere. Li Yuanjiao, only six or seven years older, had already reached the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, making any comparison futile for Chen Mufeng.

Hearing him call him "Clan Brother," Li Yuanjiao was slightly taken aback. He then remembered that Chen Mufeng was the son-in-law of his clan uncle, Li Qiuyang, and the husband of his cousin, making him his brother-in-law by marriage.

"Have you decided on which cultivation technique to practice?" Li Yuanjiao asked.

Chen Mufeng bowed again and replied, "I will follow the clan's arrangements!"

"Very well," Li Yuanjiao nodded, "then it shall be the River One Qi Technique."

"Thank you, Clan Brother! Thank you! Mufeng will serve the clan with all his might..." Chen Mufeng exclaimed readily with ears pricked up, as he had been waiting for these words. He was overjoyed, bowing excitedly and reciting a string of vows.

Li Yuanjiao merely waved his hand and said softly, "Go to Yuanping to collect the cultivation technique, pills, and spiritual qi. There is no need to report back."

The Li Family's support for external cultivators was indeed generous, as even Li Yuanjiao himself practiced the River One Qi Technique. A technique one grade stronger would significantly enhance one's strength. Chen Mufeng hurriedly thanked him and left in a rush.

Watching the young man leave, Li Yuanjiao turned to Li Xuanxuan and asked softly, "How does he compare to Uncle Donghe?"

Li Xuanxuan, holding a talisman produced by the Azure Pond, carefully scrutinized the brushwork and said, "He lacks Donghe's steadiness, is less tempered, and inevitably reckless, unlike our clan members."

The Li Family's direct descendants were aware of the great treasures they possessed and understood the severe methods of the higher sects. They were always taught the grave consequences of a single moment of negligence, leading to the clan's annihilation. Hence, the younger members like Ximing and Xijun were all introspective and cautious, differing greatly from the ambitious Chen Mufeng.

With the strict clan laws, the atmosphere within the clan was always somber. Li Yuanjiao feared excessive strictness and laughed softly, saying, "As long as he is useful. The clan needs a few with drive."

1. Translator's Note: The Qingming here probably means Qingming Copper which is used to forge weapons. ☜

2. Translator's Note: Hun means "mix" and yi means "one", so Hunyi could also mean "mixed into one". ☜

As they were talking, Xiao Guiluan arrived, full of curiosity. She descended from the wind and bowed to Li Xuanxuan, saying respectfully, "Father."

Li Xuanxuan waved his hand, signaling her to speak. He then urgently asked, "What did Xiao Guitu say?"

Xiao Guiluan hesitated for a moment and then repeated her brother's words. Li Yuanjiao and Li Xuanxuan were both stunned, looking at her in disbelief.

"Our family's Purple Mansion Realm cultivator?!"

Li Yuanjiao was dazed for a few moments, frowning as he looked up and said in a deep voice, "Where would our family get a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator? If the Li Family had one, we would not be in our current state!"

Li Xuanxuan put away the talisman in his hand, still puzzled. Xiao Guiluan herself was also confused. Seeing Li Yuanjiao's genuine expression, she hesitated and said slowly, "Perhaps it is a good thing! But... I always feel uneasy for some reason."

Li Yuanjiao turned the cup in his hand silently and said softly, "No wonder Xiao Guitu was so courteous..."

"What should we do now?" Xiao Guiluan asked.

Li Yuanjiao, surprisingly calm, had a fleeting image of the immortal mirror in his mind before replying nonchalantly.

"Act as if nothing happened. Proceed as usual."

He had a guess: the family's immortal mirror was of extremely high rank yet excelled at concealment... Perhaps Xiao Chuting miscalculated due to this misunderstanding.

He could not send someone to the Xiao Family to clarify either. Whether Xiao Guitu believed it or not, if word spread to others, it could spell trouble.

"If Xiao Chuting can return safely and promptly... Everything will be fine. If he cannot return..."

Li Yuanjiao said this, but in his heart, he felt that Xiao Chuting was definitely not someone who would take risks rashly and get trapped. With the mysterious nature of the Man On Creek, it was more likely that he would be the one setting traps for others.

He shook his head and continued, "Xiao Chuting would never risk himself unnecessarily... It is likely a calculated exchange. Do not worry about the Xiao Family; let us prepare to deal with the devil cultivators first."

Seeing Li Yuanjiao casually brush off the matter, Xiao Guiluan had no choice but to nod. Suddenly, a moment of clarity struck her mind, and she felt inexplicably uneasy. She gasped, "Oh no!"

Both men looked over to see Xiao Guiluan's face turn pale as she murmured, "No wonder I felt so uneasy! Brother... has been hit by a divine ability... It is Buzi! No wonder... I understand now...I understand! Buzi intentionally met with him. No wonder he demanded the Purple Mansion Realm expert to come personally... he forced my brother to meet him!"

Xiao Guiluan continued, "Brother is only at the Qi Cultivation Realm, while Buzi is already at the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. He must have used his divine ability to confuse and shake his mind, forcing him to seek help. He probably wanted to see what the Xiao Family's backup plan was!"

Xiao Guiluan had only brief contact with him but was already influenced to the point of distraction, showing how deep Xiao Guitu's enchantments were. If it were someone less resolute, they would have broken down and revealed all secrets by now.

"What?!"

Li Yuanjiao was momentarily stunned but quickly reacted, horrified, "What level is the Xiao Family's formation?! Does the Xiao Family have the means to isolate from the outside? If Buzi overheard your conversation with your brother, his next step would be to come to our house!"

Buzi was no ordinary Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. If he learned that the Li Family had a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, he would definitely visit personally. Their family did not have one, and they had a hidden treasure on the mountain. If it was seen by a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, it would spell the end of the family.

If Buzi saw this treasure that absorbs the Supreme Yin Moonlight, he wouldn't care about the Azure Pond Sect or Mount Dali; he would slaughter our family and flee with the treasure!

Li Yuanjiao thought of the worst-case scenario.

"Impossible!"

Xiao Guiluan, freed from Buzi's divine influence and much clearer-headed, said decisively, "Our Xiao Family's main hall was personally refined by our ancestor! It has a barrier with the Great Void. Even Buzi would have to lower himself, land on the mountaintop, and then enter the hall. It is impossible for him to overhear our conversation. Once isolated from the Great Void, even if someone died inside, their soul lamp in the sect would not extinguish immediately, let alone leave any means to eavesdrop!"

Li Yuanjiao glanced at her, still feeling a chill run down his spine as he murmured, "Let's hope that's the case..."

————

The water on Moongaze Lake rippled as a green-robed cultivator descended with the wind, landing on a small island in the lake.

"Moongaze Marsh."

He gazed silently at the blue water, calculating that it had been over a hundred years since he last came to this place.

In the records of the Azure Pond Sect, the spiritual energy here was once the greatest in the Yue State, a treasure land of the immortal mansion with white mist curled around the vast marsh. Five hundred years ago, it plummeted, and later, the siege of Li Jiangqun severely damaged the spiritual energy, almost depleting it entirely.

Daoist Master Buzi looked around. His grandfather and uncles all died in that great battle. Now, hundreds of years old, he still felt that the green water had a tinge of red to it.

"Jiangqun is dead, the bright moon rises in the east, its light like frost. Snow falls in the prefecture, the lake sparkles with a myriad of lights, red and green intertwine..."

The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who died in that battle were countless. Some returned home with an indelible sword intent, slowly awaiting death. But the spectacle over the lake was more magnificent than the previous hundred years combined.

Li Jiangqun never had the chance to transform into a spirit object. His flesh was divided among the three sects, treated as precious treasures. What followed was the reckoning with Lingyu Gate and the extermination of a few immortal clans.

He snapped out of his recollections, shook his head, and withdrew his gaze, extending his spiritual sense to search the bottom of the lake repeatedly.

"I'll search three times. If there is nothing, I'll leave."

The lakebed of Moongaze Lake churned, treacherous and filled with numerous demons, some of which were Foundation Establishment Realm creatures. Usually domineering, they now trembled in the mud, cowering in fear before the Purple Mansion Daoist Master.

Buzi ignored them, carefully searching three times. Finding nothing, he could not resist searching two more times. Finally, he shook his head and sighed. "Still nothing... I supposed it's not so easily found."

In fact, the sects had long given up on finding the Supreme Yin Moonlight in Moongaze Lake. It was more likely to be found in the ruins of the Eastern Sea. However, Buzi could not resist coming after hearing Li Xizhi's account.
𝗳𝚛𝗲𝕖𝕨𝕖𝗯𝚗𝚘𝕧𝕖𝗹.𝗰𝗼𝕞

"The Purple Mansion Realm expert aiding the Xiao Family did not show up... It might be Xiao Xianyou's favor. It is best to release Xiao Chuting first, to avoid further complications."

Buzi glanced at Mount Dali, swung his sleeve, and vanished into the Great Void.

Watching Buzi vanish into the Great Void, Lu Jiangxian finally let out a long sigh of relief, "Thank goodness... he was not coming for me."

When Daoist Master Buzi passed by the Ding Family and stepped into Moongaze Lake, Lu Jiangxian was immediately alerted. Seeing this man with such a formidable aura, he briefly feared that he had been exposed.

As he secretly calculated whether he could escape from Buzi, a mid-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had mastered three divine abilities, he realized that Buzi was just passing by to search for the Supreme Yin Moonlight.

In the future, the Li Family must not expose the Supreme Yin Moonlight again... If another one appears, this lake will constantly be visited by Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. The three sects might even start fighting over the ownership of Moongaze Lake...

As he pondered this silently, he noticed a ripple in the Great Void once more. Buzi, dressed in green, returned. He was stepping lightly over the water, which startled Lu Jiangxian.

This guy! What is he up to now? Lu Jiangxian cursed.

Buzi had a slight smile on his face as he calmly landed on the lake, looking toward the glittering grand formation on Mount Dali.

Isn't there still the Li Family? That Li Xizhi is just a young brat and might not know the family secrets. If the cave dwelling contains such a precious item as the Supreme Yin Moonlight, there might be other treasures as well!




# Chapter 402: Soul Searching

Listening to Xiao Guiluan's explanation, Li Yuanjiao felt a chill in his heart, his mind racing with countless thoughts.

Where is Buzi now? Has he heard anything about our family?! Xiao Guitu had just been hit by his divine ability, and Guiluan immediately went to see him... Wouldn't Buzi misunderstand this?

Should I replace the immortal mirror with Qingche Sword?

Li Yuanjiao believed that if he quietly placed the bronze immortal mirror in the woods or a river, even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator would not find it. No one would suspect a thing if he replaced it with the Qingche Sword on the stone platform.

He pondered, his legs stiffening as another possibility crossed his mind.

The speed of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator far exceeds that of a Qi Cultivator... If Buzi has already reached Moongaze Lake, he could be watching from the Great Void right now!

If Buzi was indeed at Moongaze Lake and used the Great Void to bypass the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation, any action he took now would be under Buzi's watchful eye, and attempting to retrieve the mirror would be suicidal.

But I can't just sit by and wait to be killed! A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator wouldn't waste time idly watching from the Great Void! With a single sweep of his divine ability, he could learn everything... Buzi shouldn't be at the lake!

Li Yuanjiao knew that a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could travel in an instant, much faster than Xiao Guiluan's return. His thoughts spun rapidly, but his actions did not stop. He suddenly called out in a deep voice, "Guiluan, return to Mount Wutu at once!"

With that, he headed to the backyard. Xiao Guiluan, understanding the urgency in his tone, left swiftly like the wind. Li Xuanxuan's face also changed drastically, wanting to speak but stopping himself.

Li Yuanjiao stepped out, feeling a sudden warning in his mind. The Profound Pearl Talisman Seed in his Qihai acupoint trembled, sending chills through his body as though he was being watched by something sinister.

"Oh no!"

He stopped abruptly, only to see the space in front of him darken. Slowly, the image of a green-robed cultivator appeared, standing with his hands behind his back.

The green-robed cultivator had a small smile on his face. He looked to be around twenty-seven or twenty-eight, dressed in a flowing robe. His long hair fluttered in the wind as he stared at Li Yuanjiao quietly.

Daoist Master Buzi...

Li Yuanjiao felt a bitterness in his mouth as Buzi raised his head. The sleeve of his green robe moved as he held up a small, exquisite white jade bottle in his right hand.

"What is this?" Buzi asked casually, but his question made Li Yuanjiao break out in a cold sweat.

The jade bottle in Daoist Master Buzi's hand came from the Li Family's treasure vault, containing a talisman pill that the immortal mirror had condensed!

Buzi has been to our treasure vault...

Li Yuanjiao hurriedly bowed, feigning a terrified demeanor, and said in a trembling voice, "Junior Li Yuanjiao from the Li Family under the governance of Azure Pond greets Daoist Master Buzi!"

His voice was neither too loud nor soft, but it was enough for Li Xuanxuan, who was standing guard outside, to hear clearly. Li Xuanxuan was so terrified that he almost went to retrieve the mirror.

Just as he took a step, Li Xuanxuan realized that the spiritual sense of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could easily cover the entire Mount Lijing; going to the backyard now would be like doing so right in front of Buzi.

Outside, Li Xuanxuan was like an ant on a hot pan, while inside, Li Yuanjiao tried to buy time, quickly making a judgment in his mind.

Buzi broke through the Great Void and immediately went to our treasure vault, attracted by the talisman pill, and is directly asking about it...

Although a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator could easily bypass most formations via the Great Void and enter it, their spiritual sense could not penetrate the formations; they had to go in person to sense what was inside.

The Li Family had five mountains with over twenty formations, and with the small formations protecting the spirit fields, there were likely over a hundred. Buzi could not possibly check each one.

Even Mount Lijing had five separate formations, three for spirit fields, one for the ancestral hall, and one for the family vault.

He only went to the treasure vault at the mountaintop and has not been to the ancestral hall yet!

Countless thoughts flashed through his mind as Chi Buzi watched him.

"You recognize me?" Chi Buzi asked.

Li Yuanjiao bowed again and respectfully said, "I have seen portraits of the four Daoist Masters of the upper sect. Daoist Master Yuanwu and Daoist Master Yuan Xiu are both white-haired cultivators, only you and Daoist Master Yuan Su are young men in green robes. Daoist Master Yuan Su is stationed in the southern border all year round, so it must be you..."

"Not bad."

Chi Buzi smiled and looked at him. Among the remaining four Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of Azure Pond, Tang Yuanwu, Si Boxiu, and Ning Tiaoxiao were all of the same generation, serving as the left and right arms of Chi Wei, hence using Yuan as their Daoist title.

He was from a later generation, and by the time he reached the Purple Mansion Realm, the Azure Pond Sect no longer followed the custom of using Daoist titles. Hence, he was simply called Buzi. Seeing that Li Yuanjiao could name so many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from Azure Pond, his smile broadened as he repeated, "What is this thing?"

Of course, he was referring to the talisman pill. Li Yuanjiao responded promptly and respectfully, "This item was obtained by our clan in a cave dwelling, along with the Supreme Yin Moonlight of that year. The clan could not identify this pill or discern its quality, and we feared possessing a valuable item would bring disaster, so we did not dare reveal it..."

Chi Buzi waved his hand to interrupt him, smiling brightly as he remarked, "This pill has excellent boundary-breaking effects and is quite rare... It seems to be made with an ancient method. I see that your clan's fortune is not shallow!"

Just as Li Yuanjiao was about to reply, he suddenly felt a wave of panic overwhelm him. The world before him turned gray and dark, shrouded in a misty gloom as if draped in a veil of darkness, making everything hazy.

Divine ability!

A cramping pain shot through his stomach, and his face felt damp. His consciousness splintered into fragments, with large sections of text and images drifting through his mind.

With the last vestiges of his awareness, he clamped his mouth shut, his lips trembling. The talisman seed in his Qihai acupoint emitted a slight coolness, keeping his consciousness intact but not fully awakening him to avoid revealing any abnormalities.

Outside, Li Xuanxuan was also affected by the divine ability. Fortunately, Buzi focused on Li Yuanjiao alone, so Li Xuanxuan only felt slightly dizzy and immediately recognized it as a divine ability.

Feeling his mind growing increasingly muddled, Li Xuanxuan, knowing his will was weak, slapped the Shenyang Mansion between his eyebrows with his palm before collapsing with a thud.

Chi Buzi paid no attention to Li Yuanjiao's reactions. He waited for Li Yuanjiao to kneel and become dazed, then gently placed a hand on Li Yuanjiao's Shenyang Mansion. Pressing the spot between his defiant brows, he performed a hand seal with his other hand.

"Yin Quarters Nine Hills Heart Questioning Spell!"

This technique was a pure soul-searching spell from the Daoist sects, far superior to the crude methods of devil cultivators. Once a forbidden spell hindering the Dao path, it had now become a useful immortal method.

Li Yuanjiao's act was flawless, but Chi Buzi had no interest in guessing the origin of the pill. Whether Li Yuanjiao told the truth or lied, he did not care to listen to the details. A soul-searching spell would reveal everything.

Chi Buzi focused intently, closing his eyes slightly. He has used this spell many times with unfailing success. His spiritual sense smoothly entered Li Yuanjiao's sea of consciousness, guiding all his memories to the surface.

The origin of this pill!

He manipulated the spell and colorful lights appeared in his hand. These then entered Li Yuanjiao's Shenyang Mansion, transforming into pale gray runes that danced in his sea of consciousness.

Chi Buzi's vision darkened for a few moments before a dimly lit secret chamber appeared, cold and icy, with one or two flickers of white mana light.

This is... a cave dwelling?

Chi Buzi's gaze shifted, noticing the floor, intricately patterned, with osmanthus trees bearing ethereal white flowers that were fragrant yet chilling.

What is this... it looks somewhat like the Moon Glazed Tree, our sect's Purple Mansion Realm spirit root.

Given that this was the place where Supreme Yin Moonlight was obtained, some anomalies were expected. Chi Buzi quickly looked away, then saw a stone platform ahead which was shrouded in a white mist, exuding an aura of mystery.

This is...

Chi Buzi's heart stirred, but then he heard rustling noises. Golden and white osmanthus flowers fell, their golden stamens and pleasant fragrance particularly striking in the misty moonlight.

Rustle, rustle...

Several lively, adorable toads and rabbits hopped out from the dark corners, trampling on the fallen osmanthus petals.

Li Yuanjiao finally straightened up, allowing Buzi to see what was on the platform.

Suspended on the stone platform was a small grayish-green sphere, inscribed with ancient and profound runes. Suddenly, a pair of eyes appeared on it.

They were gentle yet indifferent and majestic.

On the peak of Mount Lijing, Chi Buzi's hand, which was hidden in his sleeve and performing the hand seals of his spell, began to tremble violently. Tears of blood streamed from his eyes that were closed tightly, trailing down his cheeks and making him look especially terrifying.

Drip, drop.

Two droplets of blood tears fell to the stone floor, shattering two bricks, then rolled like beads, producing crisp, echoing sounds.

————

Buzi's arrival was too sudden, a consequence of his reckless pursuit of Supreme Yin Moonlight for Li Chejing's Dao foundation years ago.

Although Si Yuanbai had claimed to have obtained the moonlight himself to protect the Li Family, deceiving the various Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, no one had anticipated that the matter would resurface years later. Eventually, some greedy individuals took a chance and personally visited the Li Family.

"I guess there's no running away this time..."

The immortal mirror had not regained its full power, but its inherent rank was exceedingly high. Once it was used for calculations, it was equivalent to predicting the fate of those above the Dao Embryo Realm. Lu Jiangxian had borrowed its power back then and was well aware of its capabilities.

Whether it was Master Monk Minghui or Maha Jinlian, they were merely following Li Qinghong's trail. When Lu Jiangxian directed them to the mirror, they immediately suffered significant losses.

The talisman seed of the mirror was even more domineering. Those in the Li Family who bore the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed had their souls, fates, and cultivation all linked to it. As long as Lu Jiangxian willed it, no one could touch them.

Now, with Buzi searching Li Yuanjiao's soul, he should have found nothing. Seeing Buzi's persistence, Lu Jiangxian grew increasingly fearful. If Li Yuanjiao's soul search failed, it would only raise more suspicion and complicate the situation. Ultimately, he might be exposed.

The Supreme Yin Profound Light was only at the Foundation Establishment Realm, but it was powerful enough to instantly kill a peak Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator or even threaten a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. However, Chi Buzi was not a stationary target and could escape into the Great Void, making it impossible to hit him.

Seeing Buzi initiate the soul search and about to reach the mirror, Lu Jiangxian gritted his teeth and thought to himself, I might as well use the talisman seed as a bridge and connect to Chi Buzi's spell immediately.

Although Lu Jiangxian was not skilled in soul-searching techniques, his proficiency in shamanic talisman had grown considerably over the years. Moonlight surged as it connected to fate, and the immortal mirror lit up, forcefully crashing into Chi Buzi's sea of consciousness.

Although I have not recovered, my divine sense far exceeds ordinary spiritual senses! Only by using this technique to counterattack can I hope for a chance at survival...!

————

Li Yuanjiao's consciousness drifted in a haze for a long time before suddenly clearing. A cool sensation rose from his Qihai acupoint, and he snapped his eyes open. Before him was Chi Buzi's hand, pressed against his forehead.

All around him was pitch-black and gloomy, the corners shrouded in darkness, and the atmosphere was oppressive. It was the time of day when baleful qi was at its peak.

The sky had already darkened, indicating that nearly two hours had passed. The blood-red setting sun, accompanied by dark red clouds, flowed on the horizon, signaling an ominous portent.

He glanced around and saw that the ground was covered with glittering red jade beads, lying quietly and reflecting dazzling colors in the dim light, creating a rather beautiful scene.

"Daoist Master..?" Li Yuanjiao called out cautiously, unsure of what Chi Buzi had done to him with his divine ability. He bowed his head in silence.

I am still alive... Chi Buzi must not have discovered anything.

Chi Buzi gave no response.

A sense of unease rose within Li Yuanjiao. After a long moment, he began to step back slowly. Chi Buzi remained silent, his sleeve hanging limply. When Li Yuanjiao finally looked up, he saw that the Daoist Master's face was grim, and his eyes were tightly shut.

The darkened twilight illuminated Chi Buzi's face, revealing two streams of blood tears. The sight struck Li Yuanjiao like a thunderclap, leaving his mind blank.

Chi Buzi! What is this..?!

Drip, drip...

Blood flowed down continuously Chi Buzi's cheeks, dripping from his chin as two blood beads hit the ground, transforming instantly into sparkling red jade beads. They collided with the ones on the ground, creating a series of crisp clinking sounds.

Li Yuanjiao now understood how the jade beads had come to be. Though he felt somewhat relieved, he was also horrified and took a step back. Chi Buzi remained motionless like a statue in the dim twilight.

Li Yuanjiao cautiously extended his spiritual sense to scan Chi Buzi, only to find nothing but an empty shell where the previous oppressive aura had been.

The jade bottle containing the talisman pill had fallen from Chi Buzi's sleeve and shattered on the ground. The pill rolled out and settled in a crack between the bricks.

Silently, Li Yuanjiao moved out of the courtyard. His father, Li Xuanxuan, lay stiffly on the ground. Li Yuanjiao checked his breathing, which was steady and long, then spotted a bloody wound on his head, indicating that he had been knocked unconscious.

Li Yuanjiao immediately took to the air, his spiritual sense sweeping the area. The two clan guards outside the courtyard seemed to have been affected by a spell and were sound asleep, snoring loudly.

Seeing that some were beginning to stir, Li Yuanjiao hurried back into the courtyard. He closed the gate hurriedly and helped Li Xuanxuan to his feet, using a spell to awaken him.

Li Xuanxuan gradually regained consciousness, groggy and bewildered. Upon seeing Li Yuanjiao, he asked in shock, "Where is the Daoist Master?!"

Li Yuanjiao gave a bitter laugh, shook his head, and helped Li Xuanxuan up to his feet. Opening the courtyard gate, he saw the two clan guards standing straight, showing no signs of their earlier slumber.

"Go fetch Qinghong and Yuanping!" Li Yuanjiao ordered.

After the guards left, Li Yuanjiao led Li Xuanxuan to the backyard.

The sky grew darker, and Chi Buzi remained standing there, tears of blood continually dripping from his stoic face. Li Xuanxuan felt dizzy at the sight. The red jade beads covering the ground gleamed brightly.

"Jiao'er..."

Li Xuanxuan trembled as he scanned Chi Buzi with his spiritual sense. The man stood like a jade pillar, and it was hard to believe what he saw. He checked repeatedly.

The colorful light of Chi Buzi's divine ability and overwhelming aura had vanished. The oppressive presence that once traversed the Great Void was gone, leaving only his thin green robe on his jade-like body.

Chi Buzi's face showed slight pain, but still, the bloody tears continued flowing.
𝕗𝐫𝐞𝕖𝕨𝐞𝗯𝚗𝕠𝘃𝐞𝚕.𝐜𝗼𝚖

"...Is he dead? ...Is he really dead?"

Li Xuanxuan's face turned pale, and he staggered back a few steps, filled not with relief or satisfaction, but with trembling fear.

"The Azure Pond Sect... how many years has it been since a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was killed..."




# Chapter 404: Awakening

The setting sun was blood-red, casting a gloomy shadow over the surroundings.

At Moongaze Lake, an unusual evening fog was particularly thick, reducing visibility to the point where one could not even see their hand right in front of them. The place was eerily silent, and even the insects had fallen silent and still.

In the streets of Lijing Town, people were scarce. The reddish light of the setting sun crept along the bricks. Even the street vendors had become lax, closing up early and heading home, making the large city of tens of thousands feel empty and silent.

Li Yuanping hurried up the mountain where his father and brother were already waiting. The clan guards had been dismissed from the courtyard where his elder sister stood, holding a spear with a complex expression.

Li Qinghong's face showed a hint of satisfaction, yet her tightly crossed arms revealed a slight unease. It was the first time Li Yuanping had seen his sister like this, immediately raising a question in his mind.

"Elder Sister!" Li Yuanping entered the courtyard and called out to her.

Li Qinghong nodded in acknowledgment but said nothing further, closing the courtyard gate.

Drip, drip...

A crisp sound reached his ears as Li Yuanping slowly crossed the courtyard. His brother Li Yuanjiao stood silently in the backyard, while his father, Li Xuanxuan, sat on the doorstep, holding a handful of red jade beads.

The sky was growing darker, and Li Yuanping, lacking spiritual sense, could barely make out the scene in the courtyard. He performed a spell to produce a thin beam of bright light.

"Brother, what is this..."

Just as he inquired, he slowly lifted his head, realizing that there was another person present. The figure had smooth, jade-like skin, and sharp features. He was standing as still as a cold statue, draped in green robes.

Li Yuanping's gaze moved slowly until it met a face streaked with bloody tears.

Drip.

The sound of blood-red beads falling and colliding with each other filled the air as one rolled to his ankle. Li Yuanjiao's hoarse voice reached his ear.

"This is Daoist Master Buzi from the Azure Pond Sect... He arrived at our home two hours ago, found our talisman pill, and ended up like this."

Li Xuanxuan, still turned away from them, took a sip of spirit wine from a gourd, his face slightly flushed. He continued where Li Yuanjiao left off, "We examined him for a long time, and it seems that Buzi was frightened to death by what he saw."

Frightened to death... frightened to death...?!

His father's words echoed in his ears. Li Yuanping stood there, stunned, mumbling in shock, "You mean... a Daoist Master from the Azure Pond Sect suddenly died in our house..?"

Fear slowly filled his pale face as he said urgently, "We must flee! At the very least, we need to send the younger family members away, this..."

"No."

Li Yuanjiao shook his head, his expression dark, clearly having considered this before. He continued in a low voice, "The Azure Pond Sect still does not know about this... his soul lamp in the sect is not extinguished yet. Otherwise, Azure Pond cultivators would have broken through the Great Void and come here long ago, and our family would have already been destroyed!"

If a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from Azure Pond Sect died at Moongaze Lake, the consequences would be unimaginable, especially since this Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was a direct descendant of the Chi Family, the actual leaders of Azure Pond Sect.

The sect would not only be in an uproar, but it might also alarm cultivators above the Purple Mansion Realm.

Even if the Azure Pond Sect lacked Golden Core Realm cultivators, the cunning nature of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would prevent them from coming in person. But if they learned of Chi Buzi's death, there would be numerous Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators emerging from the Great Void, turning Moongaze Lake upside down!

Everyone understood the gravity of the situation and fell silent.

"Perhaps the Daoist Master is not dead."

Li Qinghong suddenly spoke, causing the others to exchange glances and then retreat, closing the small door to the backyard and taking positions in the front yard.

"Brother."

As Li Yuanping reached the front yard, he had calmed down and spoke in a serious tone, "Regardless of whether the Daoist Master is dead or alive, we must quickly send out the direct family members, dispersing them in all directions to preserve our family's legacy while Azure Pond Sect remains unaware... "

Li Yuanping paused to consider the options, then said, "We could head to the Wu State, and take over a small mountain or temple. Although we would lose everything, at least we can survive... Or go to the Eastern Sea, where we could seize a small island and bide our time..."

Li Qinghong interrupted him with a clear voice, "If our entire Li Family flees, it will be as good as admitting guilt. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators can trace our whereabouts! Moreover..."

Her expression turned somewhat forlorn, her voice lowering as her red lips parted, "Grandfather killed Wrathful Maha, right here in the southern Yue State, by the shores of Moongaze Lake... The monks of the Wrathful Form dare not come for revenge, but if we leave this place, those monks, led by The Merciful One, will surely descend upon us like wolves. Forget about the Merciful One... even a Master Monk could destroy our family!"

Li Yuanping suddenly recalled the burden of guilt unjustly placed upon their family by an unknown Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. He gritted his teeth and said, "Then are you suggesting we go to the Yue Cultivating Sect? The three major sects usually do not interfere with each other. We are under the governance of the Azure Pond; if we go to the Yue Cultivating Sect, do you think they will accept us?"

Li Qinghong clenched her spear and shook her head slightly as she continued, "There's no place for us in the territory of the Yue Cultivating Sect... We can only be their guest cultivators, and our number of Qi Cultivators is not something one or two immortal mountains can sustain."

Li Yuanjiao was silent for a while before transmitting his voice through mana.

"The immortal mirror has a high inherent rank... I do not know if the person holding it can be detected. If not, there might be a chance to escape."

His meaning was clear: someone from the Li Family should escape with the mirror. Hearing this, Li Xuanxuan and the others fell silent.

"If Buzi is dead, then we have a chance. But if he is not, there's no way he'd let us go after this..." Li Yuanjiao continued grimly.

The constant dripping of blood in the backyard was nerve-wracking. Finally, Li Xuanxuan, stroking his beard, said, "Jiao'er, you take the mirror and leave. Do not concern yourself with the matters of the family."

Li Yuanjiao touched the sword at his waist as he organized his thoughts, but before he could speak, Li Xuanxuan continued, "We will handle the rest. You have the highest cultivation and a low-profile technique. With the Qingche Sword, you can travel far and find a place to seclude yourself and break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm..."

Li Yuanjiao gritted his teeth, his thoughts racing as his grip on his sword grew tighter.

The courtyard was eerily silent; it was a silence that made one's heart race. The night was bright with the white moonlight casting its glow around their surroundings. Li Yuanjiao looked up at his siblings, but his expression suddenly froze.

There had been no movement for some time. His father, Li Xuanxuan, stood still, clutching his beard, his pupils dilated. Li Yuanping's face was covered in sweat which trickled down his neck.

Li Qinghong stood motionless like a statue, her hand holding the Duruo Spear which emitted no light. Her grip was so tight that her knuckles turned white. Sweat began forming on the bridge of her delicate nose.

Why is it so quiet?!

Li Yuanjiao suddenly had a bad premonition.

Creak...

In the white moonlight, the door to the backyard slowly opened. A fair hand rested on the door frame, the green robe appeared dazzlingly pale in the moonlight as if glowing.

Clatter...

Red jade beads scattered across the backyard ground, rolling lightly onto the stone bricks of the front yard.

Thud.

Then, it was followed by the sound of a footstep.




# Chapter 405: Water Mansion Immortal Official

Azure Pond Sect.

Azure Pond Peak was enveloped in swirling clouds and mist. Within the cave dwelling on the mountain, a dark golden bell with intricate patterns hung in the center. It was only rung upon the death of a Daoist Master or the ascension of a sect master.

Chi Zhiyun landed on the peak hurriedly, followed by a group of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. As soon as he landed, a tall young man approached, cupping his fist in greeting.

"Sect Master!"

"Hejing."

Chi Zhiyun waved his hand urgently, not stopping, and stepped into the stone cave, asking, "How is it?"

"The flame is dim and turned bright white... The lamp oil is rising, the nine lines are flickering. This has never happened before." Ning Hejing's voice was grave.

Chi Zhiyun's expression grew increasingly grim as he muttered, "Bright white...? How could that be?!"

He dismissed the others and quickly stepped deeper into the cave dwelling. Several soul lamps rested on lotus seats carved from wood, burning quietly.

The wood sculpture was made from Soul-Tuning Mulberry Wood, which could foretell blessings and disasters, was impervious to the five elements, and feared only thunder. The lamp oil used Nine Refined Soul Essence, once a precious treasure was now no longer particularly valued.

Chi Zhiyun focused his gaze, and indeed, Daoist Master Buzi's flame was noticeably smaller. It has changed from a pale gray to bright white, with the patterns on the lamp base interweaving between dark and light.

Only Chi Zhiyun and Ning Hejing were in the cave, both looking grim. Ning Hejing spoke in a low voice, "I have already inquired; the Daoist Master left the sect earlier without leaving any message."

Chi Buzi was Chi Zhiyun's great-grandfather, and Chi Zhiyun's lineage was the maternal family of Ning Hejing's branch. The two grew up together, their interests closely intertwined, making them almost like real brothers.

As soon as Chi Zhiyun became sect master, Ning Hejing was appointed as the peak master of Yuanxing Peak, gaining significant influence within the sect. Now that there was an issue with Chi Buzi, he was naturally worried.

"Do Daoist Masters Yuanwu and Yuan Xiu know of this?" Chi Zhiyun blurted out suddenly.

Ning Hejing shook his head and replied, "Rest assured, Clan Brother. I have sealed off this information immediately. The two disciples guarding the lamps are trusted members and will not leak this news. As of now, only Daoist Master Yuan Su is aware."

"Good." Chi Zhiyun praised him and speculated in a low voice, "Now that devil cultivators are running rampant, without the Man On Creek, they cannot be contained. Xiao Chuting is trapped in the Eastern Sea, and the Daoist Master must have gone to find him."

Chi Zhiyun tapped the edge of the table anxiously and muttered, "Could it be Zhang Tianyuan? What is his Golden Feather Sect thinking? Do they not fear ruining things?!"

"That is not necessarily so!"

A clear voice echoed through the cave.

Chi Zhiyun and Ning Hejing both relaxed, respectfully stepping aside as they greeted the newcomer.

"Welcome, Daoist Master."

Daoist Master Yuan Su, dressed in green, his robe looser with a small white seal at his waist and a slightly rounded face, spoke softly, "Zhang Qiushui of Golden Feather Sect has mastered the Moistening Radiant Lead life divine ability, which can also attract these devil cultivators... just not as effectively as Man On Creek or Heavy Murk. The matter of the True Monarch is crucial; it will not be entirely entrusted to the three of us."

Chi Zhiyun and Ning Hejing both bowed their heads respectfully. Daoist Master Yuan Su continued, "However, without at least five or six Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, it is impossible to detain Buzi. Zhang Tianyuan cannot orchestrate such a formation; at most, he would cause Buzi some trouble."

Daoist Master Yuan Su appeared unconcerned, smiling as he continued, "Buzi is just like my senior brother was in life, now having reached the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. Over the decades, he has become arrogant and conceited, yet also inherently greedy... Though he is calculating, it is rare for him to suffer setbacks. It will not be a problem!"

Chi Zhiyun and Ning Hejing, not daring to interrupt, shrank back like quails. After a moment, they finally suggested, "Daoist Master, maybe you should deduce it..."

They only dared to ask due to Daoist Master Yuan Su's mild temperament. Daoist Master Yuan Su merely shrugged and replied, "He is cautious, leaving no traces in the Great Void, and his cultivation is high. I possess the divine abilities of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, not the fate-determining power of a Maha... what could I use to deduce?"

He shook his head and joked, "If he is dead and his divine abilities dissipate, I might be able to deduce something."

Chi Zhiyun and Ning Hejing exchanged glances, clearly not amused. Daoist Master Yuan Su shrugged, reached out to trace the air in front of him, and stepped into the Great Void, his voice still echoing in their ears.

"He most likely got caught up in something while rescuing Xiao Chuting in the Eastern Sea. I will go check it out."

————

Lu Jiangxian's divine sense was even more formidable than expected, forcefully entering Chi Buzi's sea of consciousness, and disorienting his soul. Chi Buzi, being from an immortal sect with considerable experience, quickly realized he was facing a highly skilled cultivator.

Activating a secret technique, he gathered his spiritual sense and called out, "I am a disciple under the Pristine Water Origin Talisman True Monarch... I do not know which senior is before me, but if I have offended you, please forgive me!"

Despite being several hundred years old and seasoned, Chi Buzi was not intimidated by Lu Jiangxian's overwhelming presence. He observed closely and discerned that Lu Jiangxian was all bluster. If it were not for his high intrinsic rank, Chi Buzi would not have felt threatened.

He spoke politely while thinking to himself, This old man appears to be an ancient cultivator who has fallen on hard times... if I could kill him, the rewards would definitely elevate me to greatness!

Lu Jiangxian, however, remained silent, his divine sense ruthlessly overwhelming Chi Buzi. Although Chi Buzi's spiritual sense was not as strong, he had a large quantity of it, and he resisted stubbornly, continuing to shout out, "May I know which metallic essence the senior cultivate?"

No matter how Chi Buzi inquired, Lu Jiangxian did not respond, relentlessly pursuing him. Chi Buzi had not anticipated that Lu Jiangxian's divine sense would be so unyielding, causing him to retreat repeatedly.

After about an incense stick's time, Chi Buzi began to grow anxious.

"Senior, be cautious... I am known to the True Monarch, and if something happens to me, it will surely alarm him!"

Ignoring him, Lu Jiangxian continued his aggressive assault, finally grabbing him tightly as he sighed with relief, If this were within the world of the mirror, eliminating him would be a matter of a single thought... but here in his Shenyang Mansion, it took so much effort!

Seeing Chi Buzi still struggling, Lu Jiangxian made up his mind. Using the backlash from the Yin Quarters Nine Hills Heart Questioning Spell, he began to read Chi Buzi's memories.

Just as he had this thought, Lu Jiangxian felt uneasy, and a clear pool appeared hazily before his eyes, startling him.

"Of course, there is still the Pristine Water!"
𝕗𝕣𝐞𝐞𝘄𝐞𝚋𝚗𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗹.𝚌𝕠𝚖

He was in Chi Buzi's sea of consciousness; not within his own mirror world. Lu Jiangxian knew that reading Chi Buzi's memories would alert the True Monarch of the Azure Pond Sect...

I can't kill him... Since I can't erase his memories, I'll plant a shamanic spell in his spiritual sense!

Lu Jiangxian waved his hand, condensing the dense moonlight and setting up a backlash monitoring spell. He reluctantly extracted a string of talisman qi.

I'll tie you to my boat so you can't go running to Pristine Water to tattle!

After setting up several layers of precautions to ensure that Chi Buzi would be utterly destroyed if the spell activated, Lu Jiangxian had a sudden inspiration. He used his divine sense to bring forth an object.

This was a piece extracted from the soul of Maha Jinlian, purified numerous times by Lu Jiangxian's moonlight. It was now blank and shining white.

A bold idea arose in Lu Jiangxian's mind, almost making him quiver with excitement.

Why not... replace him with a substitute... make him one of my own...

After careful consideration, Lu Jiangxian shook his head. Chi Buzi, after all, was associated with Pristine Water. If the sect discovered something was amiss upon his return, it would spell disaster for Lu Jiangxian.

Then a compromise—create a friend out of him!

He took the glowing orb and embedded it with fabricated memories, including various exalted immortals and immortal courts from past lives, checking everything thoroughly.

Satisfied with his work, he also altered the shamanic spell in Chi Buzi's Shenyang Mansion, linking it to the soul fragment of Maha Jinlian. After reviewing it, he was extremely pleased with his handiwork.

"It's flawless!"

————

On Mount Lijing.

The continuous sound of blood tears falling from Chi Buzi's body had stopped, leaving an eerie silence that made even the faintest sound audible.

"Hmm..."

Daoist Master Buzi pushed open the door and stumbled forward, a strange smile on his face. He leaned against the doorframe, taking another step out.

Buzi!

Li Yuanjiao's mind was racing with alarm bells.

The Daoist Master in green robes stepped forward, his eyes closed, the blood tears having ceased. Buzi then exhaled deeply, stiffly turning his head toward the members of the Li Family.

Li Yuanjiao felt his legs go numb and a chill run down his spine, raising the hair on the back of his neck.

At that moment, Buzi's face was divided; one side was clean and sharp-featured, while the other side was distorted and covered in fine white fur with the muscles twitching slightly. His ears were elongated and drooped downward.

His eyelids moved slightly, and he slowly opened his eyes, revealing empty black sockets with bulging green veins around them, the red-purple eyelids struggling to open.

"G... Greetings, Daoist Master!" Li Yuanjiao's hoarse voice echoed in the courtyard.

Buzi stared blankly at him for several breaths before speaking, "What Daoist Master? I am an Immortal Official under the command of the Immortal Lord at the Water Mansion of Dangjiang Creek.... What era is this? Where is the Immortal Court? Which is the nearest Water Mansion?..."

Buzi took a moment to examine his body before exclaiming, "After waiting so long to obtain a Purple Mansion Realm body, why is it still a damn devil cultivator?! How can devil cultivators run rampant in broad daylight in this era?"

The Li Family stared at him, dumbfounded. Buzi looked at them impatiently and asked, "Are you recipients of the talisman? Which sect do you belong to?"

Li Yuanjiao was still processing Buzi's words when Buzi suddenly stepped back, muttering, "No, I need to find a Water Mansion and reclaim my immortal position!"

He shouted, "You little yellow hats, quickly open this broken formation before I break it with a single palm, making you cry all over the place!"

Li Yuanjiao, observing Buzi's behavior, felt a sudden jolt of fear in his heart as his mind raced with thoughts.

Could it be that Chi Buzi has been possessed by some being with Metallic Essence? This entity keeps talking about a Water Mansion; who knows how ancient it is... no wonder Chi Buzi looks so disheveled! But... why isn't this being using the Great Void to travel..?

Since Chi Buzi was possessed, Li Yuanjiao wanted this disaster to leave as soon as possible. He quickly deactivated the formation, revealing the dark night sky.

"Good! You little yellow hats are sensible!"

The Metallic Essence spirit was overjoyed and flew away like a shooting star, leaving a loud laugh behind.

"Visit my Water Mansion of Dangjiang Creek another day, and I will surely reward you with merit!"

————

Chi Buzi then left the Li Family, flying south. As Lu Jiangxian's residual power waned, his expression grew increasingly bizarre. He suddenly stopped, shouting aloud, "What Metallic Essence fiend is this?!"

As soon as he spoke, he became furious and slapped himself on the face with incredible force, shouting, "Audacious! The Daoist Lord is an Immortal Official of the Water Mansion of Dangjiang Creek, not some fiend!"

Chi Buzi was shocked, raising his hand to press against his Shenyang Mansion. Halfway through the motion, his hand stopped in mid-air, as if struggling against an invisible force. Chi Buzi warned, "I am a disciple under the Pristine Water True Monarch, you fiend... stop this! I will find you a good body!"

"Body? I want yours!"

The soul remnant left by Lu Jiangxian, infused with Maha Jinlian's personality, was chaotic and unruly, spewing profanities endlessly.

But Chi Buzi ignored him, focusing on controlling his hand toward his Shenyang Mansion. As the original owner of the body and a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, he was slowly gaining the upper hand.

Seeing itself losing, the immortal official laughed coldly, and a bright spell mark rose within Chi Buzi's soul.

Try moving again! I'll detonate this spell and escape with Metallic Essence, then I'll see what you can do!

Chi Buzi looked down in disbelief, muttering, "How is this possible..?!"

What's impossible? What did you think I was doing when I took control of your body earlier? You can try, see if you can exterminate me faster than I can detonate this formation!

The immortal official, thinking it was a remnant of metallic essence, felt triumphant, no longer controlling Chi Buzi, allowing him to land by a stream.

It continued, I've waited in that yellow hat's mind for decades, finally using that Supreme Yin Moonlight to lure you! A pity that you're a devil cultivator... why didn't you hide properly instead of wandering around seeking death? I won't hold it against you devil cultivators as long as you take me to a Water Mansion and send me to the Immortal Court... maybe I'll even petition the Immortal Court to give you a chance at survival.

Chi Buzi suddenly laughed maniacally, angered. He immersed his spiritual sense into his Shenyang Mansion, cursing at the white glowing circle, "What nonsense! What Immortal Court? What Water Mansion?! You are full of ancient, unheard-of nonsense! What kind of era is this? Stupid... fool!"

He cursed angrily, then suddenly paused, greed rising in his heart.

Before him, several objects that were neither talismans nor seals, floated within the glowing circle, glowing dully. A sweet fragrance of fate, blood qi, and incense filled the air.

What... What is this?




# Chapter 407: Departure

The object, neither talisman nor seal, flipped and hovered slightly before condensing into a small bluish-gray orb that emitted flashes of mana light. It was easy to tell at first glance that it was no mundane artifact; it was the very treasure Li Yuanjiao remembered his family had discovered in a cave dwelling.

"I see... This was that person's last resort."

Chi Buzi recognized it instantly. After observing it briefly, he took a moment to chastise himself for his earlier greed. Who would have guessed that the Supreme Yin Moonlight was a lure set by that old schemer?

Suppressing his greed, Chi Buzi thought to himself, This old thing is probably an ancient monster by now... I shouldn't rush things and coax out his secrets first. Maybe within them lies my opportunity to form a core and acquire my own essence!

The shamanic spell was still rooted deep within his soul, yet Chi Buzi felt no fear as he focused on the talisman qi.

It's a mere shamanic spell... In eighty-three years, when the True Monarch emerges from his seclusion, this spell can be dispelled easily. But securing that ancient relic is truly a treasure, I must secure it before meeting the True Monarch!

While he contemplated his next move, the Water Mansion Immortal Official suddenly grew vigilant and snapped, "What concern is it of yours? This is the legacy of the immortal position bestowed by the Immortal Court! It's mine alone to claim... Don't even think about it!"

However, Chi Buzi was not really listening to him. He was fixated on the promise hidden within his words—A legacy of an immortal position! A chance at the Dao Embryo!

Breathing heavily, Chi Buzi's thoughts raced with possibilities.

Could it be true? Does this ancient being truly believe in the Immortal Court? If so, how can I ensure my safety against Pristine Water? The True Monarch is ruthless—once he learns of this, the Azure Pond Sect won't protect me... It could mean more than just my demise.

Chi Buzi was adept at quick thinking. Within moments, he had weighed all possible outcomes.

In this case, it's better to vanish overseas and plot quietly in secret to claim this legacy than to be silenced or killed.

He rubbed his tired eyes, only then noticing his horrible state. He organized his thoughts.

I Investigated the Moongaze Lake, searched the soul of a Li Family member... and fell into the trap of this old thing...

His divine abilities were impaired, and chaotic moonlight energy surged through his body—a direct consequence of his daring gaze upon the immortal position.

A decade or so of recovery should suffice.

Despite the potential risks, Chi Buzi felt indifferent; encountering such ancient relics was worth any personal loss, especially since the power of the immortal position seemed extraordinary at first encounter.

"First, I need to restore my eyes."

Rolling up his sleeves, Chi Buzi began scooping up some river mud, deftly molding it into two thumb-sized balls which he then inserted into his empty eye sockets.

The two mud balls fitted into his sockets nicely. Closing his eyes, he performed a hand seal and cast a divine ability. A burst of colorful light emerged, and when he opened his eyes again, the mud balls had become real eyeballs that could move around.

This will suffice for now! I must have damaged my eyes by gazing directly at that immortal position... I'll craft proper replacements once I return to my sect for some blood qi.

Now with his new eyes, Chi Buzi's vision had become clearer and his mind turned sharper.

Although he had tasted the formidable power of the ancient being when he assaulted his sea of consciousness, Chi Buzi remained skeptical.

Could the Dao Embryo legacy really be so easily obtained? I could not even scan it with my spiritual sense, who knows what it is? If Pristine Water believes this, I'll be as good as dead.

As this thought crossed his mind, Chi Buzi's expression hardened as if recalling something.

"Old thing, is the Li Family even aware of your existence?" he asked.

"I've hidden in their house for decades but never spoken to any of them and have long erased their memories," the Water Mansion Immortal Official replied nonchalantly.

The Immortal Official's tone was dismissive, but for Chi Buzi, it was a matter concerning his own safety. He whispered fiercely, "I'll go silence them and reclaim the divine ability that I've leaked while I'm at it!"

Although Azure Pond and Mount Dali had promised not to perform blood sacrifice in the northern foothills, there was no problem in killing a few mortals. As for the divine power, it was referring to the scattered blood beads on the ground.

Chi Buzi was not after those spirit items, knowing they would soon dissipate. However, he feared they might be exploited by others. He opened the void, only to be stopped by the Immortal Official's harsh admonition.

"How dare you commit such acts that defy the natural order!"

His words carried weight, and after counting silently to four, Chi Buzi sighed deeply and reluctantly halted, replying coldly, "What an old-fashioned man you are! We, who possess divine abilities, are not the same as those mere mortals and lowly cultivators... How absurd it is for us to be bound by the same moral constraints fabricated by the mundane world!"

The Immortal Official snorted coldly and was about to respond when Chi Buzi cut in sharply, "Let me ask you this, old thing... When the heavens and the earth were first formed, were there any morals, laws, or honor when there was nothing but the vast land?"

Caught off guard, the Immortal Official responded, "There were none."

Chi Buzi smiled coldly and then continued, "In the earliest days of humanity, those who emerged first were revered, while those who followed were deemed lesser. The powerful became emperors; the meek, their slaves. The so-called morality was nothing more than a set of rules crafted by the revered to control the lesser, by emperors to dominate their subjects, and by elders to discipline the young."

He continued, "When the elders died, and the young became wiser and ascended to power, they preserved the established order. Over time, it morphed into a system of superiority and inferiority, morality and etiquette."

"Morality and laws are mere constructs; they exist if you believe in them and vanish if you don't. Now, as a revered figure with divine abilities, I can set my own rules. Why should I bow to the whims of those long gone?" he challenged.

The Immortal Official retorted in anger, "Slaughtering the innocent and disrupting the peace of heaven... Do you not fear the repercussions of karma?"

Chi Buzi scoffed and muttered darkly, "Karma? It is but a toy in the hands of the Mahas, and the people are mere livestock under my divine abilities. How adorable do you think these creatures are? They despise me, yet they would eagerly take my place."

With a sinister smile, he added, "As for the repercussions, it's nothing more than a feeble cry... a pitiful delusion."

Despite the distance, Chi Buzi's location was still within the perception of Lu Jiangxian's divine sense. With the help of the shamanic spell in his soul and his own divine sense, Lu Jiangxian could read every thought in his mind.

"THis is the only thing I can do since Chi Buzi's visit was too abrupt..."

With talisman qi that could elude even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, Lu Jiangxian tried to bluff in away that would entice a potential Golden Core Realm cultivator. As long as Chi Buzi did not dare to gamble with Pristine Water's vision, it was naturally impossible for him to report anything.

The soul of the Immortal Official, though under Lu Jiangxian's influence, retained considerable autonomy. Armed with complete knowledge of Immortal Court systems from his past life and the Sacrificial Rituals Method's instructions in the mirror, he had managed to deceive Chi Buzi for the time being.

If contradictions arose, the Immortal Official would assume his fragmented memories were to blame, rather than suspect that his soul had been fabricated by another.

As long as Chi Buzi refrained from probing into the Pristine Water, the ever-watchful soul would ensure any slip led swiftly to his demise, which was far preferable to falling at Moongaze Lake.

"Once I finish using this man and ensure they won't be able to track me down, things will be easier."

Lu Jiangxian relaxed, a hint of anticipation coloring his face.

The Immortal Official's inquiry into today's events will certainly extend to the cultivation method and other secret techniques of the Azure Pond. He might even uncover aspects only accessible to those of the Purple Mansion Realm... Once Chi Buzi ventures to Moongaze Lake, I'll connect to his soul and extract his memories.

Surveying the area around Moongaze Lake with his divine sense, Lu Jiangxian sifted through the family treasuries. While there was nothing new, the Ding Family had a new set of legacies that included a Grade Two cultivation method of little significance.

Nevertheless, Lu Jiangxian noted down the cultivation technique before leisurely returning to the mirror. Chi Buzi's blood beads were still rolling on the ground.

These could be useful...

Although the beads contained only a modest amount of Chi Buzi's divine abilities, the shamanic path excelled in harnessing dharma blood. The abundant quantity was more than sufficient for Lu Jiangxian's purposes.

Just a bit more persuasion is needed for the Li Family to surrender them to me...

Aside from divine sense and the Supreme Yin Moonlight, the mirror's ability to interact with the outside world was limited. Unless someone triggered the mirror's fate, it was impossible for it to move, let alone pull someone into the realm within it.

Lu Jiangxian, though desiring the blood beads, had to wait for the Li Family to offer them to him.

Li Yuanjiao and the others watched Chi Buzi ride the wind and disappear into the distance, exchanging surprised glances.

"An official from the Dangjiang Creek Water Mansion? An Immortal Mansion?"

"It must be the reincarnation of some metallic essence..." speculated another.

The Li Family was more knowledgeable now.

Li Yuanping nodded in agreement.

"Brother is right, but considering what we've seen at home, how could it manifest a metallic essence...?"

They stopped abruptly, exchanging knowing looks with each other before swiftly changing the subject.

"The one possessing the Daoist Master's body seems reasonable enough, but who knows what he might do next."

Li Xuanxuan, noticeably more relaxed, wiped the sweat from his brow and added softly, "I'm also unsure if this Daoist Master will regain consciousness and seek revenge. We must prepare for all possibilities..."

Turning to Li Yuanjiao, he asked, "What do you think about relocating overseas?"

Li Yuanjiao shook his head slowly and replied, "We would need at least two family members at the Foundation Establishment Realm to consider establishing a branch overseas. Currently, sending anyone would be futile—they'd merely be marching to their demise."

He paused, then proposed, "Why don't we discreetly send Ximing to the Xiao Family to consult with Ancestor Yuansi? We could have Ximing fostered under his tutelage in the guise of practicing alchemy."

Li Yuanjiao gradually regained his composure and continued elaborating, "Ancestor Yuansi is a warm and generous elder. Under his guidance, Ximing will surely thrive, learning much more than he would at home."

"Moreover, should disaster befall the Li Family and we face annihilation, the Purple Mansion would surely attempt to erase us. Without divine abilities, fleeing would be futile. Xiao Chuting, who has sheltered Chen Taojing, a suspected remnant of the immortal sect, will likely use his divine abilities to conceal Ximing's whereabouts as well, ensuring our family's legacy endures," he added.

Li Xuanxuan sighed as he sat down.

"Ancestor Yuansi has already done much for our family... The debt of gratitude we owe is immense, and I would not involve him further unless absolutely necessary."

Li Yuanping, who had been listening quietly, nodded slightly, then cupped his fist and excused himself.

"I will make the necessary arrangements."

Li Xuanxuan gave him a nod, then turned back to Li Yuanjiao.

"In these perilous times, perhaps you should take the mirror, seal the ancestral hall, and retreat to Mount Wutu for safety."

Li Yuanjiao performed a hand seal, then carefully collected the red beads from the ground and placed them in a jade box. Once done, he picked up one and examined it in the moonlight.

The bead's radiant red hue, shadowed by a faint gray mist, shone particularly brightly. Staring at it for an extended period stirred a deep-seated sense of unease and irritability within him, feelings that were difficult to put into words.

As soon as he secured the beads, Li Yuanjiao felt the talisman seed within him stir and was immediately delighted.

Oh, they can be used as an offering in the sacrificial ritual..? I knew these were good stuff!

"This is a serious matter. We must consult the mirror," he replied to Li Xuanxuan.

With that, he activated the complex formation, entered the ancestral hall, and pushed open the heavy stone door. He kneeled and bowed deeply before the mirror.

"I, Li Yuanjiao, the disciple of the Li Family that is beset by calamity and faces great peril, respectfully request the Profound Light to protect and preserve... I pray for your supreme guidance..."

After completing the ritual and offering deep bows, the mirror's light gradually dimmed before descending before him, indicating his prayer's success.

Li Yuanjiao had studied several books of prayers from the mirror, dedicating himself to understanding these mystical incantations. He often wondered why the mirror required such elaborate rituals, assuming it was a reflection of its exceedingly high status.

However, his recent encounter with a metallic essence claiming that he was the Immortal Official from the Dangjiang Creek Water Mansion governed by the Immortal Lord, had left him deeply unsettled. Piecing together all he knew about the mirror, a startling possibility emerged.

Perhaps this mirror serves a vast immortal mansion in a realm beyond our skies! Maybe it is merely a medium for communicating with this distant celestial realm...

If this were truly the case, then everything made sense! Perhaps Chi Buzi had inadvertently met a specific criterion—maybe an offense against the Immortal Mansion or he was destined to become a physical sacrifice, thus allowing an Immortal Official to descend to the mortal realm!

With these thoughts unraveling in his mind, the potential of mighty forces behind the scenes slowly became apparent. Li Yuanjiao dared not speak of his suspicions aloud but held them close in his heart.

Feeling a surge of excitement, he wondered, Does expressing our gratitude to Supreme Yin meant... we'll be able to reach the immortal mansion as long as our cultivation is high enough...?

Suppressing his wild speculations, Li Yuanjiao carefully stored the mirror and exited the backyard. He nodded to his father and announced respectfully, "I'm going to Mount Wutu to cultivate!"

Li Xuanxuan exhaled deeply, nodding in return as he watched his son leave. He then proceeded to close up the formations, ensuring all traces were concealed within the secret chamber before leaving to meditate as well.

As soon as Li Yuanjiao returned to Wutu Peak, he was greeted warmly by Xiao Guiluan.

"How was it?"

Li Yuanjiao shook his head and replied, "Nothing to worry about, it was just a false alarm."

He quickly changed the subject.

"The family plans to send Ximing to the Xiao Family to study alchemy... I'll need you to make the journey as well."

"Understood," Xiao Guiluan responded succinctly, taking to the winds without further question.

Li Yuanjiao felt a pang of guilt and unease in his heart. Xiao Guiluan trusted him completely, yet he had to keep secrets from her.

After all, having experienced it firsthand and hearing it from Li Tongya, the talisman seed could indeed protect against the Purple Mansion Realm Cultivator's deceptions. Only those who received the seed could lie directly to Purple Mansion Realm cultivators without fear of detection.

Xiao Guiluan did not have such protection from a talisman seed, and knowing too much would probably only endanger her.

"Hm?" Li Yuanjiao paused, a sudden thought striking him.

The Yu Family has been too quiet!

Compelled to investigate, he took out the bluish-gray mirror and soared northeast, over mountains and forests, before landing at the Yu Family's cave dwelling.

The highest cave, richest in spiritual qi, was heavily fortified by a grand formation. The entrance was also sealed tightly with multiple layers of spirit formations.

Inside, Li Yuanjiao found the cave floor littered with shiny jade fragments that were still rolling around. Blue, green, red... They scattered across the ground, reflecting off one another. The cave was also filled with various crystals from ceiling to floor, and the ground was blanketed with fine white salt.

A skeleton, colored like jade but broken in half, lay collapsed. The upper section of the skeleton had fallen to the ground, cleanly severed, the cut so smooth and flat it seemed almost polished.




# Chapter 409: Settling

"Yu Xiaogui is dead."

Li Yuanjiao had heard many rumors and lived through the death of his family's ancestor. With a quick glance, he instantly grasped the situation at hand.

The two families had a blood feud, and Li Yuanjiao, feeling no sorrow, sighed in relief that the turmoil was finally settling.

"Fei Wangbai fell to an unknown swordsman. He fell with just a single attack... Yu Xiaogui met his end at the hands of my granduncle, armed with only a Huashang Fruit and his Qingche Sword... It took just a single strike too. The Three Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of the lake are now all dead..."

The Azure Pond Sect would not ease its grip on prestigious clans just because their Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators had fallen. The tributes that were due would still be demanded under the guise of honoring past legacies. These families would still be labeled a prestigious clan for another fifty years so that the sect could drain all their remaining resources before discarding them for good.

Should a few more Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators emerge in the Li Family or annex additional territories, their required tributes would undoubtedly increase, mirroring the substantial offerings made by the Yuan Family, who paid far more than the Li Family.

The scene of Yu Xiaogui's death was strikingly magnificent, with jade scattered all across the ground. Li Yuanjiao observed in silence, then left the cave to survey the Yu Family's territory for a while.

Under the Yu Family's governance, conditions had significantly improved over the years. Now, at least, their subjects led decent lives. Despite Yu Mugao's sinister and brutal nature, his bold reforms to the clan system and his elevation of commoners not born into the family all led to positive progress.

Understanding the situation, Li Yuanjiao put away the mirror. As the familiar stone wall of his cave dwelling came back into view, he murmured, "Chi Buzi's visit has indeed unsettled my family... The long-term consequences of it are still unclear."

The day's events had caused frustration to accumulate within him. Li Yuanjiao took the Qingche Sword from its place and started practicing his sword techniques.

It was not until he had practiced for half the day that he felt the mounting pressures begin to dissipate, and he sensed a slight improvement in his skills.

Sitting cross-legged, he began to clean the sword. At that moment, a man in brown robes and a jade crown approached, his face breaking into a broad, respectful smile.

"Clan Brother! Clan Brother! Good news!"

It was none other than Shamoli. Despite being older than Li Yuanjiao, he had learned the ways of the world and preferred addressing Li Yuanjiao as his clan brother with familiarity.

"Clan Brother! There's good news from Lijing! Daoist Master Chuting has appeared in Mount Yu and vanquished dozens of devil cultivators lurking over there! He has already returned to Xianyou Peak... The devil cultivators in the Xiao Family's territory have scattered, fleeing in all directions!"

Xiao Chuting has returned!

Li Yuanjiao silently sighed in relief, a smile breaking across his face.

With Xiao Chuting in command, the Xiao Family's plight will be solved... My family will be safer as well.

With that in mind, he patted Shamoli's shoulder and replied, "That's indeed good news! Keep watch for a while; I'll cultivate in seclusion now."

Shamoli then nodded and silently withdrew.

————

As news spread, the cultivators on the mountain breathed a sigh of relief and the crowds at the foot of the mountain rejoiced. They did not understand the intricacies of the struggle but knew that the Xiao Family backed the Li Family. Hence, the return of such an important figure was naturally a cause for celebration.

The generation of Yuan and Qing, who held important positions across various mountains and towns, were elated too. Having returned to Lijing to report on their duties, they gathered in Li Yuanping's central hall to offer their congratulations.

The generation of Yuan and Qing originally numbered over ten, but now nine remained. Excluding Yuanjiao and Qinghong in the mountains, and Yuanping who managed family affairs, most of them were Li Xuanxuan's concubine-born children.

There were four sons and two daughters—the eldest was thirty, and the youngest just over ten, each holding a significant role within the family. Two among them possessed spiritual orifices, though their talents paled in comparison to even Li Yuanping's and were nearly indistinguishable from mortals.

"Greetings, Family Head!"

This group, representing nearly half of the Li Family's worldly influence, gathered in the hall. Li Yuanping greeted them with a warm smile and helped his siblings to their feet.

Their unruliness during Li Yuanxiu's reign had completely vanished. Everyone had a warm smile on their face and was devoted to the family.

It was not that Li Yuanping was better at leading the family than Li Yuanxiu; it was rather because his siblings had married, settled down, and started families of their own.

The distinction between those with spiritual orifices and ordinary mortals was profound. While it was challenging to produce heirs with such rare traits, these siblings endeavored to conceive them, aiming to nurture children as remarkable as their father, Li Xuanxuan.

According to the Li Family's rules, concubine-born children from the major sect identified with spiritual orifices by the age of six could be sent to the mountains for training. With their precious children cultivating on the mountain, the parents naturally shifted their allegiances to become staunch supporters of the main lineage.

This was a strategy Li Yuanping understood well. By boldly promoting key positions, he eased his own burdens considerably. Over the years, his warm relationships with his brothers had greatly strengthened their bonds.

With a laugh, he chirped, "Although this is good news, all of you shouldn't have gone out of your way to make this trip."

After exchanging pleasantries, the group pushed forward a man with a broad, round face—the eldest son born to Li Xuanxuan from a concubine. After some extended conversation, one of them said, "There are still untapped talents within our family, talents that have been overlooked and underutilized by the clan... We've come to bring them to your attention, Family Head!"

"Oh?"

Li Yuanping's interest was instantly piqued.

The man continued, "These two brothers are the sons of Master An... They are also part of the Li Family."

He motioned, and two teenagers, about thirteen or fourteen years old, stepped forward. Dressed in cloaks with their hair neatly tied back, they wore gold bracelets on their wrists and had round faces with dark eyes.

Both bowed formally as they greeted him respectfully.

"An Siwei greets the Family Head!"

"An Siming greets the Family Head!"

They were the only children of An Zheyan and Li Feiruo. The siblings both possessed spiritual orifices and had attained the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm by the ages of thirteen and fourteen!

However, their aura seemed unsteady, indicating they had only recently achieved this breakthrough. Nevertheless, their progress still astounded everyone.
𝑓𝑟ℯ𝘦𝓌𝘦𝘣𝑛𝑜𝓋𝑒𝓁.𝑐ℴ𝓂

Li Yuanping studied them intently and suddenly exclaimed in surprise, "Both of you... are cultivating the

Guardian of the Courtly Path technique?!"

Both brothers nodded, prompting Li Yuanping to secretly sigh in relief.

No wonder they've advanced so quickly... The Guardian of the Courtly Path is known for accelerating progress in the Embryonic Breathing Realm while slowing Qi Cultivation; but it's impressive nonetheless.

Although they can't match An Jingming's progress at fourteen, they're still better than many of our external cultivators. Not just the Chen Clan, but their speed also matched even those in my family who have received a talisman seed!

He shook his head and stated firmly, "Given your current level of cultivation, I don't have any responsibilities for you."

The other siblings and the An brothers were dismayed upon hearing Li Yuanping's statement. Li Yuanping, however, continued, "I'll write a letter to find a cave dwelling on Mount Huazhong for you two to focus on your cultivation so you can swiftly achieve the Qi Cultivation Realm... The clan will have significant duties for you by then!"

"Yes!"

The brothers readily responded, clearly elated upon hearing this.

Li Yuanping immediately wrote the letter. The An brothers accepted it and respectfully withdrew.

Meanwhile at the Xiao Residence...

Xiao Chuting broke through the void and descended lightly atop Xianyou Peak. The water in the cold pool was crystal clear and icy as usual. Sitting down, he gazed at a mountain rock across the bank, lost in thought.

Battles of wit had left him exhausted. As Xiao Chuting settled on the rock, he was suddenly reminded of his dead elder brother, Xiao Chuchou.

The brother, with whom he had discussed current events and changes in the world by that pool for years, had been consumed by him and transformed into one of his half-realized divine abilities.

Xiao Chuting knew in his heart that even if he had not consumed Xiao Chuchou, his brother's days were numbered due to his old age. Xiao Xianyou had orchestrated everything masterfully, making the best use of every resource.

There's no turning back...

Devil cultivators had wreaked havoc, and Xiao Chuting ensured that those of the Qi Cultivation and Embryonic Breathing Realms on Mount Yu Qi met their ends in both miserable and humiliating ways.

Despite his efforts, he could not pursue the demon cultivators who had fled to the Purple Smoke Gate for revenge. Instead, he was left to vent his frustration by eliminating just a few of their masses.

The land of Jiangnan was exceptionally fertile with deep earth veins enriching it. Planting a few seedlings guaranteed a bountiful harvest the next year. Although tens of thousands had perished on Mount Yu, the population would flourish again within a few generations, much like crops. Therefore, the losses sustained by the Xiao Family were relatively minor.

Despite his many successful schemes over the years to turn small investments into large profits, the old man's face remained gloomy. He could never quite satisfy his ambitions. Silently, he picked up his white jade fishing rod and began to fish.

After a long while, a messenger arrived, announcing that Xiao Guitu, the family head, had come to pay his respects to the old ancestor.

Xiao Chuting hummed in acknowledgment. Xiao Guitu quickly ascended the mountain path, dressed in casual clothes. With a happy look on his face, he said respectfully, "Junior Guitu greets the Daoist Master!"

"Hm."
𝒇𝙧𝙚𝓮𝔀𝓮𝒃𝙣𝓸𝒗𝒆𝒍.𝙘𝒐𝒎

Xiao Chuting gave him a brief glance and asked, "Chi Buzi looked for you?"

Xiao Guitu bowed and replied, "With the protection of the dharma artifact from the old ancestor, I didn't fail too badly before the Daoist Master of Azure Pond. However, I was still influenced by his divine ability. I also asked Guiluan regarding the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Li Family."

Xiao Chuting shook his head gently and replied, "That's fine. Chi Buzi has since returned to the Azure Pond Sect after visiting Moongaze Lake... We don't know if he was injured, but he had likely retreated hastily after being warned by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Li Family."

Xiao Guitu nodded thoughtfully, then asked, "What of Mount Dali's demon den?"

Xiao Chuting remained silent for a moment before responding evasively, "Send someone to the South Sea to fetch Xiao Yuansi, so Guiluan need not wait any longer."

"Understood!" Xiao Guitu replied and respectfully withdrew.

Xiao Guiluan had stayed with the Xiao Family at the foot of Xianyou Peak for just over half a month, reconnecting with old acquaintances to gather information about Mount Yu.

Her father, learning it involved the Xiao and Li Clans, adamantly refused to meet with Li Qingxiao.

Yet, with dozens of Spirit Stones presented, the door that was once closed suddenly opened, transforming formal strangers into eagerly welcomed guests.

Xiao Guiluan was not surprised by his father's greed and spitefulness. It seemed that with the right incentive—particularly an expensive gift and Xiao Guitu's tacit approval—a door once closed could indeed be opened.

With Xiao Guitu's clandestine support, arrangements concerning Mount Yu proceeded smoothly, and Xianyou Peak even dispatched a few guest cultivators to stabilize the situation.

Good news continued to arrive. While Xiao Guiluan wondered how much longer she would have to wait for Xiao Yuansi to return to Xianyou Peak, she received news of his imminent return.

Perhaps Xiao Chuting's presence allowed for the reallocation of resources, facilitating Xiao Yuansi's reassignment from the South Sea.

Xiao Guiluan quickly sought an audience with Xiao Yuansi, who readily accepted. Subsequently, Xiao Guiluan entrusted an alchemy furnace to Li Ximing, asking him to remain with the Xiao Family, then bade farewell and departed.

Upon her return to Li Residence, she learned that Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong, the Li Family's main pillars, were cultivating in seclusion. Understanding that the family's situation had stabilized, she was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief.

————

Two years swiftly passed. Li Yuanjiao had been waiting for news from the Azure Pond Sect, but heard nothing nor did their Purple Mansion Realm cultivator appear in the sky as he feared. Day and night, he wondered if the Immortal Official managed to deceive the sect. With no catastrophic developments, he finally felt a measure of relief.

The devil plague had also diminished, no longer presenting the collective threat it once did while it was ravaging several prefectures. Now, the scattered devil cultivators spread malevolence throughout the Yue, Wu and Xu States, leading to a steady stream of smaller, yet more frequent disasters.

During this period, some devil cultivators infiltrated the Li Family's territory. Thanks to the family's thorough and detailed household registration system, these invaders were quickly discovered after harming just one or two people. These Embryonic Breathing Realm devil cultivators proved not particularly formidable and were easy to eliminate.

The Li Family's sacrificial ritual that took place every five years was approaching once again. With Chi Buzi's blood beads, the preparations this time were even more elaborate. Access to Mount Dali was heavily restricted. Li Qinghong, having emerged from her seclusion after advancing to the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, was tasked with the preparations of this ritual.

The Li Family now boasted a plentiful number of Qi Cultivators. However, due to the secretive nature of their sacrificial ritual, seeking external assistance would necessitate fabricating an elaborate tale. Therefore, the main family opted to undertake the task themselves, starting with a search around Moongaze Lake.

The bottom of Moongaze Lake shimmered. Dark waters flowed, swirling up clouds of gray silt. Li Qinghong and Li Yuanjiao stood in the water, their mana light deliberately dimmed to blend with the underwater shadows, waiting patiently.

Li Qinghong's jade armor, an heirloom of the An Family, was enchanted with a Water Avoidance Spell, providing her comfort in the water. Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao's mastery of the River One Qi Technique enabled him to navigate the water as naturally as a fish.

Moongaze Lake was deep and teeming with demonic creatures that had already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. After two months of meticulous searching, the pair finally encountered a catfish demon of no significant background.

Glug, glug...

As the distant waters rushed in, Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong exchanged a knowing nod.

Suddenly, they spotted a beast swimming swiftly through the dark waters, as large as a hut, with its long whiskers flinging about. It opened its massive mouth to gulp water, swallowing several times before spitting out bone fragments.

Large, flat forehead... Sticky, slippery saliva... It's definitely a catfish demon.

This catfish demon, only at the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and with a poor bloodline, lacked significant legacy and intelligence. However, it excelled in water control and swam swiftly. Once startled, it could dart away instantly, making it nearly impossible for the duo to catch up to it underwater.

Beneath the lake, demonic creatures of the Foundation Establishment Realm lurked, and this particular catfish demon, with its low intelligence, roamed the waters haphazardly. Should Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong inadvertently stray into the territory of another demon general, it could spell trouble for both of them.

Li Yuanjiao racked his brain for a while before deciding to rent a Qi Cultivation Realm water-aligned formation plate known as the Muddy Water Talisman Flowing Formation from the Yuan Family. While the catfish demon foraged, he set up the formation in its lair and waited.

As the catfish demon blundered forward, Li Yuanjiao activated the formation. A blue light rippled open instantly and a greenish-blue barrier emerged from the lakebed, seamlessly merging with the water, isolating the area completely.

Startled, the catfish swiftly turned and shot out like an arrow, only to collide with the Muddy Water Talisman Flowing Formation and causing the entire formation to shake slightly.

Since the catfish demon's skin was thick, it showed no reaction of pain. After a moment's pause, it attempted to flee again in a different direction.

"It's done!" exclaimed Li Yuanjiao.

This demon, inexperienced in battles with cultivators and unfamiliar with formations, panicked. At that moment, Li Yuanjiao drew his sword and advanced.

Buzz...

His bright white sword qi sliced through the lake, leaving two long waves in its wake. The catfish demon responded by expelling water from its mouth, which transformed into multi-layered shields.

This spell was primitive, typical of a wild demonic creature with scant mana. The arc from Li Yuanjiao's Celestial Moon Slash technique cut through the water shields and pierced the catfish demon's body, creating a small gash.

Despite its large size, and tough scales which had mucus and mana protection, the sword arc managed to still pierce through and damage the demon's scales and bones. Writhing in pain, the catfish rolled on the lakebed.

As Li Yuanjiao raised his sword to strike again, Li Qinghong quickly interjected, "Brother, your sword qi is too powerful, I fear you might accidentally kill this demon. My thunder techniques are better suited for capturing it alive. Shall I take over?"




# Chapter 411: Engraved Stone

"Fine," Li Yuanjiao said as he smiled and nodded, then stepped to the side.

Li Qinghong had been cultivating in seclusion for a long time. This was an opportunity for her to stretch and loosen her muscles.

Her face broke into a grin as she advanced, drawing her weapon. With practiced grace, she spun the spear that was radiating with a purple glow. Although she had fought many battles in the lake, she did not immediately unleash her thunder. Instead, she slowly approached the catfish demon.

Thunder technique worked differently compared to sword qi, which was the sharp qi derived from the metal element. Sword qi harmonized well with water, so it could work well under water.

On the other hand, thunder techniques were characterized by attributes of thunder and fire, as well as the dynamic balance of yin and yang, where the yang manifested as lightning. Naturally, it was less effective when released in water compared to on land. Yet, it was still formidable enough for Li Qinghong to deal with a minor demon.

Li Qinghong activated the River Crossing Torrential Step, then lunged, targeting the demon's underbelly with her spear.

The White Iris Spear was deadly, so she would not use it to deal with a mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm demon. The dharma weapon in her hand was instead a low-grade Qi Cultivation Realm spear.

Poof!

Li Yuanjiao had barely registered a tingling sensation on his face when a bright light suddenly flashed, followed by the muffled sounds of an explosion. Water churned into froth and mud.

The catfish demon, caught off-guard, winced and recoiled. The spell it had been gathering in its mouth dispersed as it staggered backward, its whiskers stretched taut, emitting a piercing screech.

Li Qinghong pressed on now that she had gained her advantage. Her spear movements were swift and precise, killing the fish and prawns in the water and causing them to surface. The catfish demon, clearly outmatched, turned in panic and fled.

Li Yuanjiao, observing the scene before him, could not help but express his admiration.

"Thunder techniques are truly impressive! It's rare in Jiangnan... If it didn't shorten lifespans and harm the body, it would have been the most formidable offensive technique in our family," he remarked.

If their family had not acquired the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual recently, nothing could truly rival this Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique. Though the former was a Grade Four technique, brilliant and powerful as the sun, it might still fall short of the intimidating power of the thunder technique, which could overwhelm both the enemy and the wielder alike.

With that in mind, Li Yuanjiao recalled something else.

Xicheng has made remarkable strides in the past few years... He celebrated his twenty-sixth birthday just a few days ago with a breakthrough to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Meanwhile, Uncle Donghe hasn't returned from the western desert...

Chen Donghe was expected to return in a year or two and likely be around when Li Xicheng entered the Qi Cultivation Realm. However, Ximing who was studying alchemy with the Xiao Family, and Xijun who was training on Meiche Peak showed remarkable talent. They were already close to reaching Li Xicheng's level.

Ximing and Xijun have already reached the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm at just fourteen and fifteen... It seems likely they'll advance to the Qi Cultivation Realm within the next five to seven years. If the Golden Yang Radiant Origin is bestowed upon Xicheng, then at least one of them won't be able to receive this spiritual qi in time for their breakthrough.

With the devil plague rampant across the land and communication from the west sporadic, gathering a portion of the Golden Yang Radiant Origin spiritual qi within the next seven years posed a significant challenge to them.

I better discuss this with Xicheng once I return!

By the time he regained his composure, Li Qinghong was already returning, dragging along a large catfish behind her. The fish's body, marked with patches of black and white, was now rigid, with its cultivation sealed. Foam bubbled from its gaping mouth.

This demonic creature, struck by lightning and slightly charred, had regurgitated all sorts of things—bits of fish, ducks, crabs, snakes, along with some fabric and driftwood... It also seemed like some of the fishermen on the lake had fallen prey to it before.

"Hm."

Li Yuanjiao cast a glance at it before performing a hand seal to deactivate the isolating barrier. The formation plate on the ground slowly floated up, settling gently onto his hand.

"This Muddy Water Talisman Flowing Formation is quite useful and extremely isolating... As long as the formation plate is guarded, it can reliably trap enemies," Li Qinghong commented thoughtfully.

Li Yuanjiao put the plate away, then remarked, "It's a solid water-based formation, though regrettably only available for rent. Purchasing it would set us back over a hundred Spirit Stones."

Li Qinghong was in a good mood, conversing with her brother as she channeled mana to her hands to lift the catfish demon that was the size of a small hut. The two of them then flew side by side back to the mountain.

Meanwhile, Li Yuanping had already finished preparing for the ceremony. Dressed in a Daoist robe, he waited with the old monkey who was also dressed in a Daoist robe and a pair of clogs. Standing beside them was Li Ximing, who seemed to have just returned not long ago and was ready to join the family rituals.

Upon seeing his elder siblings return with the demonic beast, Li Yuanping praised them and produced a wooden box from his sleeve joyfully.

"Big Brother! The Wanglin Blossom has bloomed!" he exclaimed in excitement.

He opened the wooden box to reveal three slightly reddish spirit flowers, each delicate and soft, about the size of a palm, with slender stamens and five bicolored petals—red on top and white beneath.

As soon as the wooden box was opened, everyone, including Li Yuanping himself, smiled at the sight of it. Li Yuanping explained, "This flower makes the heart light and joyful. Whether mortal or cultivator, unless they've formed their Immortal Foundation, they can't help but show a true smile."

The wooden box had just been opened, but Li Yuanping and everyone else laughed muffledly, with the corners of their mouths upturned.

"The owner of this flower is happy, smiles when he sees it, and is very gentle... No matter whether he is a mortal or a monk, as long as he had not become an immortal, he must smile honestly." Li Yuanping finished with a warm, genuine smile.

After admiring the flowers for a moment, Li Yuanjiao instructed, "Give two of these to Ximing and have him deliver them to Ancestor Yuansi as a modest gift, a token of our gratitude for his long-standing support."

After giving the instructions, Li Yuanjiao rewarded the old monkey with some cultivation resources which the monkey accepted with a grateful nod.

Li Ximing then came forward.

"Thank you, Second Uncle!"

Li Ximing was gentle and respectful. Having trained with the Xiao Family for two years, Master Xiao Yuansi had taught him everything he knew. Li Ximing had studied numerous medicinal texts and had become proficient in gathering and identifying herbs, reflecting some of Master Xiao's refined demeanor.

He had grown taller and his features had become more distinct, bearing a strong resemblance to Li Yuanping, though less delicate in appearance and not as handsome. However, his temperament compensated for his plain looks.

The aura at Xianyou Peak was rich, and his cultivation had been progressing well. He was not far behind Li Xijun, who was also focused on advancing his cultivation. Li Yuanjiao noticed a hint of concern in his eyebrows and said, "If there are any difficulties, feel free to speak up."

Li Ximing hesitated for a moment before gesturing to a few medicine pouches on his waist and replied, "Master Xiao gifted me an old set of medicine pouches to store spirit items. I accepted it in the end, so I fear our family is further indebted to him..."

Li Yuanjiao nodded in understanding. The family had already stretched its resources thin by giving Li Qingxiao seventy Spirit Stones.

"Our family currently lacks additional resources; we only have a few dharma artifacts left in our treasury. Does Senior Yuansi have any children? What is their level of cultivation?" Li Yuanjiao asked.

With a look of guilt, Li Ximing answered, "The ancestor's children were not strong in their cultivation and died in a conflict. There's a descendant in their family named Xiao Guixiang who comes from a well-off family that doesn't lack dharma weapons nor elixirs."

Li Yuanjiao sighed and gritted his teeth in frustration, mentally noting this information.

We shouldn't delay this any longer... If there's little chance of resolving this, it might be best to offer the alchemy legacy from our family.

He waved dismissively and said, "Now that you're back, let's prepare for the ritual."

Yi Mountain City was constructed around Mount Lingqiu, a once majestic and renowned peak. It used to blaze with flames in ancient times and produced a type of golden spirit ore mined extensively by an immortal sect known as the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion. As a result of this, the earth veins became thinner, and the mountain eventually stopped burning.

At the highest cave dwelling atop the mountain, shrouded in clouds and swirling green fog, Daoist Master Yuan Su stood, playing with a light golden jade seal. He gazed down at the grand city below him.

"Buzi must have lost his mind... He wanders Wu and Yue States day and night, refusing to return to the sect. Thankfully, the devil plague is progressing well..." he murmured.

Daoist Master Yuan Su hailed from the same era as Chi Wei. Unfortunately, he practiced a cultivation method that prematurely ended his progress, confining him to the early stages of the Purple Mansion Realm. If not for the fact that it was a life divine ability, Yuan Su might have lost all standing.

Disillusioned, especially with people like Si Boxiu, he decided to choose a quieter life, hence retreating to the southern border.

"Hm?"

Yuan Su paused, sensing the surge of golden aura at the foot of the mountain.

"Someone's establishing a Dao foundation... it's the Engraved Stone..." he mumbled to himself.

He calculated silently; the one from Golden Tang Gate had not moved in ages but he still lived. If memory served, his divine ability was incomplete.

"Situ Huo practices the Engraved Stone, but that fool isn't skilled in alchemy and hasn't established his Dao Foundation... He's probably not destined for it."

Yuan Su chuckled to himself before picking up a jade token from the desk, muttering to himself, "Li Xuanfeng... another from the Li Family?"

The image of a certain young man flashed through his mind. As the jade token spun in his hand, Yuan Su mused, "I owe something to the Li Family... but who knows what that man thinks? Maybe Xiao Chuting has already beaten me to it. He probably detests the Chi Family and myself as well."

His other hand rose slowly, capturing a wisp of colorful light in the void. Unleashing his divine ability, he connected it across the heavens to Li Xuanfeng.

Yuan Su calculated carefully again with his divine ability.

It seems respect and fear prevail... Xiao Chuting doesn't dare make a move. Perhaps the Li Family only resents Chi Wei...

Back then, no outsiders knew who took Li Chejing away. When Yuan Su was forced to carry out this task, he was cautious enough to veil his face.

In terms of prudence, only Xiao Chuting can match me, he thought smugly.

Since the Li Family bore no malice toward him, Yuan Su decided to let the matter rest. With a flick of his fingers, he sent the jade token soaring like a shooting star, landing before a specific cave dwelling at the mountain's base.

"Damn it," Daoist Master Yuan Su cursed as he reattached the jade seal to his waist.

He settled back on the rock and muttered, "With Chi Wei dead, Yi Mountain City is mine... Who cares what the Chi Family thinks!"

————

In a brightly lit cave dwelling, a middle-aged man sat cross-legged beside a spirit spring, slowly exhaling.

His features were sharp, and he bore the visage of someone both brave and ruthless. Yet, a lingering sadness softened the harsh lines between his brows, tempering the fiery intensity within him that otherwise defined his presence.

Behind him stood his golden longbow, radiating an extraordinary aura.

He was none other than Li Xuanfeng.

"After more than fifty years of arduous cultivation, I've finally achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm!" he declared proudly, releasing a long breath and opening his eyes slowly. A golden fire danced within their depths. His eyes brightened momentarily before fading back to their natural hue.

As soon as Li Xuanfeng achieved his breakthrough, a few rays of light appeared behind him, and the name of Daoist Master Yuan Su surfaced in his thoughts. The Profound Pearl Talisman Seed within him stirred violently, emitting a white light that briefly clouded his vision before clarity returned.

However, this memory swiftly vanished, leaving Li Xuanfeng unaware of the internal struggle between the two forces within his mind.

My Immortal Foundation... The Engraved Stone!

This immortal foundation was established with cultivation techniques from the Golden Tang Gate. Its Qi was capable of breaking formations, cleaving mountains, and destroying enemies' dharma artifacts. Specializing in precision attacks, it becomes increasingly powerful with each enemy defeated, tempered by their blood qi.

Once formed, this Immortal Foundation could detect gold in earth veins, consume gold and jade for healing, ward off baleful qi, and render the body as impervious as metal and stone. With just a wave of his hand, he could wield sharp qi, making it difficult for spells and curses to harm him.

"It's an excellent tool for battle and breaking through formations," Li Xuanfeng mused as he rose to his feet. The Golden Age Longbow behind him vibrated and leaped into his hand instantly. He ran his fingers over the bowstring, only to notice that the cave wall was filled with brown and golden ores that seemed like spirit items.

"This is the phenomenon that accompanies the establishment of my foundation..." he mumbled quietly in awe.

The cave dwelling was brimming with baleful qi and astral qi. Thankfully, the grand formation of the Azure Pond Sect prevented the cave walls from being ravaged by the corrosive forces.

With a wave of his hand, Li Xuanfeng cleared the turbulent qi in the cave dwelling. Pushing open the door, he stepped out into the night. The stars and moon were shining brightly above in the sky.

The two Daoist children stationed keeping watch at the cave entrance exchanged surprised glances with each other, clearly not expecting that Li Xuanfeng—a mere clan cultivator—would succeed in establishing his foundation.

They quickly kneeled before him.

"Greetings, Old Ancestor! Congratulations on establishing your immortal foundation and ascending to immortality once again!"

Li Xuanfeng nodded and took a step forward, only to pause and look up as a fluorescent light streaked across the night sky.

Wrapped in a white glow and trailing a colorful tail three chi long, it slowly descended before him. Stunned, Li Xuanfeng watched as the light dimmed, transforming into a diamond-shaped jade pendant that landed at his feet.

Before he could speak, a tall figure appeared beside him, clad in the all-green attire and jade boots typical of an Azure Pond Sect disciple. Each item he wore glowed with the light of mana.

The Azure Pond Sect disciple slowly bowed, then sank to his knees gracefully and announced, "Hejing bears the imperial decree of the Daoist Master!"

After rising from his bow, an awkward smile spread across his face as he continued, "Please accept the decree, fellow Daoist!"

It must be Daoist Master Yuan Su...

Li Xuanfeng observed the man's reaction and understood that this was indeed an order from the esteemed Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master.

That's quick!

Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly before accepting the decree with a smile. "Where is the Upper Sect sending this humble servant to?" he asked.

"You have humor, fellow Daoist. I am Ning Hejing, Peak Master of Yuanxing Peak, stationed in Yi Mountain City."

The smile on the man's face was stiff. Li Xuanfeng took a closer look at him before realization dawned upon him as well.

So, it's him!

This person was Senior Brother Ning who led a group of Yuanwu Peak disciples back then. He was tall and quite outstanding. He had kicked Deng Yuzhi over and let him shoot the fleeing cultivator with an arrow.

"Daoist Master Yuan Su has personally appointed you as a general, entrusting you with a significant responsibility," Ning Hejing quickly regained his composure and spoke with forced cheerfulness.

"This appointment is part of your entry into Yi Mountain City's cultivation registry. You'll receive immortal stipends and can also accumulate merits to request spirit items from the sect. From now on, you and I are colleagues," he explained.

Ning Hejing's eyelids twitched as incredulity flickered in his heart. He scanned Li Xuanfeng's face, pondering how this man, seemingly without notable background or talent—save for his archery skills, had been chosen for promotion.

How could Daoist Master Yuan Su personally promote a Foundation Establishment Realm clan cultivator when there are dozens of other cultivators of the same realm within the sect in this city? Is it out of admiration... or does he have other motives?

Li Xuanfeng raised his eyebrows, clearly pleased as he responded, "Thank you to the Daoist Master."

He did not dwell much on his situation. Since his arrival in Yi Mountain City, he had been resigned to a fate of death over dishonor, simply seeking to enhance his cultivation and extend his life a few more years. Now realizing he could still provide for his family in his remaining years, a thought struck him as he said with a smile, "How can I call myself your colleague? If the Peak Master has any requests, I am yours to command."

Ning Hejing studied Li Xuanfeng for a moment, clearly taken aback by his humble words despite his formidable prowess with the bow. Feeling somewhat reassured now, he replied warmly, "You are too polite, fellow Daoist. After all, you were personally promoted by Daoist Master Yuan Su... There's no need for formalities with Hejing. If you have any requests, just let me know."

Li Xuanfeng, though not particularly shrewd, had the wisdom of fifty years of experience. Since his family had no connections to Daoist Master Yuan Su, and suspecting that his promotion was more about Yuan Su's interests than his own merit, he said tactfully, "There's no need to trouble the Peak Master. I only wish to inquire about my duties."

"Nothing more than to help maintain order. The southern border is currently in chaos, and I have no interest in engaging in any cunning games."

Ning Hejing laughed, his demeanor turning eager as he warmly suggested, "Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng, why don't you come with me to meet all your colleagues?"




# Chapter 413: Brothers Bound Together

After two years of careful nurturing, Lu Jiangxian observed the murky qi of heaven and earth surging within the mirror, accompanied by flowing golden light and a subtly rising aura. With his divine sense, he traced the connection from the mirror to the talisman seed.

"Li Xuanfeng has established his foundation..." he murmured.

The feedback from Li Xuanfeng's breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm was even less substantial than before, only slightly strengthening his divine sense and the Profound Light, just like when Li Chejing first broke through to the Qi Cultivation Realm.

The subsequent breakthroughs of other Li Family members in the Qi Cultivation Realm gradually showed diminishing returns, generally lacking any significant qualitative change.

Now that I have the means, I need to grow a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator...

As Lu Jiangxian's mastery of shamanic talismans grew stronger, he gradually possessed more shamanic techniques. To his dismay, all of them were of the Moonlight lineage, which drew unwanted attention and made it likely that all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would covet any Auspicious Children[1] he raised...

I'll just have to wait for the Li Family to offer that Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's dharma blood before I can plan further.

The talisman qi was condensed by mixing essence qi, incense, and soul. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's dharma blood could not be obtained easily, and Lu Jiangxian had to rely on the ritual performed by the Li Family to get it inside the mirror.

"It's a pity that the mirror can't house cultivators for now... Otherwise, everything would be much easier!"

He mused to himself for a while before a fragmented voice reached his ears.

"The Li Family of Lijing offers respect along with fine delicacies and wine with unwavering devotion year upon year... Observing the three yuan festivals and six regular festivals, we maintain reverence—ensuring to pay timely respects... Through the smoke of our offerings and the blood of our sacrifice..."

Swoosh.

A white light pierced through the layers of gloomy clouds and mist, landing in Lu Jiangxian's hand while a series of red beads also appeared on the table. Lu Jiangxian used his mana to secure them and first examined the talisman qi in his hand.

"It's a mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm demonic creature."

He assessed that the talisman qi was somewhat weak. Mount Dali was challenging to access, and most of the demonic creatures in Moongaze Lake were cunning and grouped together; capturing this demon must have been quite a feat.

"It is good that I still have reserves."

Lu Jiangxian had saved many excess Qi Cultivation Realm gray talisman qi left over from the Li Family's previous sacrifice rituals. He drew out a strand and combined it with the weak gray talisman qi in his hand. The Li Family still had plenty of talisman pills, so no further additions were necessary.

His divine sense swept over the jade platform on the mountain where the Li Family members who had received a talisman seed stood.

"Talisman qi can assist in breakthroughs and improve cultivation progress... It is best bestowed upon a Qi Cultivator. Since the generations of Xi and Yue are still Embryonic Breathing cultivators, it is better to save this until there is a Foundation Establishment Realm white talisman to give out."

Then again, talisman qi could only be granted to those who had received a talisman seed. After much consideration, Lu Jiangxian's gaze settled on Li Xuanxuan, who appeared emaciated and aged after narrowly escaping death with the Blood Escape Technique previously.

Sixty years of arduous effort, and now his cultivation path has been obstructed... Perhaps I should bestow this talisman on him. With a pill, he should be able to elevate to the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

With a deft movement, the gray talisman flew into Li Xuanxuan's brow like a meteor.

A light appeared before Lu Jiangxian's eyes and several gray characters emerged—Holding Profit and Keeping Prosperity.

Unlike in the past when the Li Family members had several talisman qi to choose from, Li Xuanxuan was given only one option.

This particular talisman qi, though uncommon, could slightly enhance the success rate of alchemy, talisman drawing, and other hundred arts of immortal cultivation. Based on Lu Jiangxian's current understanding of talisman qi, it should also be able to balance fortunes, calm storms and mitigate any potential turmoil.

"This talisman qi is a decent one for Li Xuanxuan... It's a blend of fate and divine ability. With its protection, he should be able to live a few more years."

After bestowing the talisman qi, Lu Jiangxian returned his attention to the blood beads on his table.

With a gentle manipulation of his mana, the blood beads quickly melted and merged, forming a fist-sized crimson jade pearl. Lu Jiangxian swept his divine sense through it, silently discerning the divine ability it harbored.

I knew it... Chi Buzi's Dao foundation is the Heavy Murk.

If Chi Wei could advance to the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm, then surely the Azure Pond Sect must have a complete set of cultivation techniques to build the Dao Partners. I wonder which metallic essence these Dao Partners are after...

Observing the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of Jiangnan, they all seem intent on avoiding cultivating the same Dao lineage. If it is the Pristine Water Origin Talisman Essence they are looking for, will it impact the Pristine Water True Monarch?

Lu Jiangxian's limited understanding of cultivation realms above the Purple Mansion left him with a nagging doubt.

I guess I can only wait for a more suitable time to gather further information...

————

When blood was spilled on Mount Lijing's jade platform, the catfish demon collapsed immediately. Blood light and incense slowly floated away, invisible to the onlookers.

Li Xuanxuan was closely monitoring the younger ones in the family when he suddenly felt something stirring in his Shenyang Mansion. A gray light appeared and the mana in his body surged.

Stunned by the unexpected surge in mana, Li Xuanxuan's face flushed. After a few moments, he grasped the situation and quickly seated himself cross-legged.

The Li Family members quickly stepped back, and after the time it took for a stick of incense to burn, Li Xuanxuan's cultivation realm had risen from the fourth to the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. He slowly exhaled and opened his eyes.

"Congratulations, Father!" a group of juniors said in unison.

Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard, smiling broadly as he explained the function of his new talisman qi to his family.

"I never thought I'd receive talisman qi at this old age, and its effects align so well with my needs... With this, my success rate in crafting talismans has improved!"

He laughed, then cheerfully pulled Li Yuanjiao closer and said, "Maybe I should stabilize my cultivation for a few years, then use that talisman pill to reach the late stage of Qi Cultivation Realm and boost our family's combat power."

Li Yuanjiao naturally congratulated him and nodded in agreement, inwardly pleased with the outcome.

Despite that, the blood of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had not been particularly impactful. It had merely produced a gray talisman. While it looked more refined than usual and glowed slightly brighter, it was still just a gray talisman and too ordinary to be given to Ximing or Xijun.

By the time a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator emerges in our family, those two children should also be in the Qi Cultivation Realm... Perhaps by then, we should hunt for a Foundation Establishment Realm demon to request a talisman for them.

————

Two separate sacrificial rituals were being conducted at the mountain. The one hosted by those who had received a talisman seed in the Li Family took place atop the mountain, while another happening at the foot of the mountain was overseen by Li Xicheng. As the eldest of the generation of Xi and Yue, Li Xicheng led the others in his generation in a ceremony that was both lively and vibrant.

Li Yuanping had planned everything meticulously. Although Li Xicheng initially felt awkward about not receiving a talisman seed, his role in managing the ceremony proved to be a strategic decision. It not only prevented him from feeling out of place but also provided valuable exposure for the younger members of the Xi and Yue generation.

Feeling the weight of his responsibilities, Li Xicheng had begun preparing half a year ago. Now, with the ritual successfully completed without a hitch, he finally let out a sigh of relief and noticed only then that his back was soaked with sweat.

As soon as he changed his clothes after descending from the sacrificial platform, someone came over to inform him that Li Yuanjiao wished to see him.

Without further delay, Li Xicheng hurried up the mountain. Upon entering the main hall, he saw a man dressed in a black robe sitting at the center, his brow furrowed with concern.

Ever since the passing of the Old Ancestor, Second Uncle rarely smiles...

Unbeknownst to Li Yuanjiao, these changes in him were more apparent to Li Xicheng, who, being significantly older than his younger brothers, remembered vividly what Li Yuanjiao was like in his youth.

Given his kind and generous nature, Li Xicheng was an empathetic person. He kneeled and greeted, "Xicheng pays his respects to Second Uncle of the fourth lineage! Congratulations on your significant advancement in immortal cultivation!"

1. The Auspicious Children in this context refers to whoever in the Li Family that received a talisman seed. ☜

Although Li Yuanjiao originated from the first lineage as a direct descendant of Li Changhu, he had been adopted into the fourth lineage as a direct descendant of Li Chejing. However, the major sect on the mountain was close-knit and typically overlooked such nuances, paying attention to these distinctions only during formal events.

Unbeknownst to Li Xicheng, whose heart ached to see the changes in his second uncle, Li Yuanjiao also harbored feelings of guilt toward him.

Back then, this child wasn't picked for the talisman seed and I had to make him leave the mountain... And now, I have to take away the spiritual qi of heaven and earth aura that he rightfully deserves to his younger brother...

Though Li Yuanjiao felt guilty, his decisive nature did not allow him to dwell on it for long. He paused briefly before saying warmly, "Xicheng, now that you've broken through to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, it seems that your cultivation efforts are paying off."

"Cheng'er dares not feel complacent about his progress," Li Xicheng replied modestly.

After a brief conversation, Li Yuanjiao said bluntly, "Uncle Donghe has managed to gather that Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi in the west. It's estimated to arrive in a year or two. This spiritual qi is extremely difficult to collect; the family has spent seven years just to gather a portion of it... Since this resource is so scarce, I'm afraid not everyone in the four lineages can receive it. It will only be allocated to the second lineage..."

Li Xicheng was slightly taken aback before he hurriedly replied, "Xijun is now also at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm! It's better for Second Uncle to reserve this spiritual qi for himself! Cheng'er is not as talented and fears wasting such a precious resource... I cannot bear to make my younger brother wait another seven years."

Li Yuanjiao had not even finished speaking when Li Xicheng interrupted him. He halted his speech, sitting up straight with a hint of dangerous suspicion in his eyes.

Hm?

Having led his family, commanded soldiers, killed adversaries from Mount Yue, and dealt with corrupted nobles, Li Yuanjiao was accustomed to cunning and deceit. Consequently, Li Xicheng's display of loyalty aroused his suspicion, causing him to narrow his eyes as he scrutinized the young man closely.

Yet, upon observing Li Xicheng, he saw clear, honest eyes. Despite Li Xicheng's plain appearance and weak presence, his gaze was filled with trustworthy sincerity.

"You..."

Li Yuanjiao averted his gaze, secretly ashamed of his skepticism. He nodded and said solemnly, "If that's what you truly think... then very well, you may leave now."

As Li Xicheng bowed and was about to leave, Li Yuanjiao's mood lightened. He laughed warmly and sighed, "Ah! You're... You're truly a good older brother... Xijun is fortunate to be your younger brother!"

Li Xicheng turned back and shook his head. He bowed to Li Yuanjiao again and said warmly, "Second Uncle, as the eldest of my generation, whether it's Xijun, Ximing, or Xizhi who is currently training in the immortal sect, they are all my younger brothers. Brothers bound together by blood should stay united. Covetous envy or struggles for power are not in my nature, nor do they interest me."

This was the first time he had spoken so boldly to Li Yuanjiao. Standing with his spear slung behind him and his robes billowing, his expression was earnest. In his mid-twenties, the young man was at the height of his heroic vigor that lent a dignified air to his ordinarily plain and almost overly honest face.

"Good!"

Li Yuanjiao tapped his knuckles on the table and sighed, feeling a weight lift from his heart. He chuckled, beckoning Li Xicheng closer. Taking a jade bottle from his sleeve, he said, "This is our family's secret Barrier Breaking Pill. Take it and break through to the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Strive to reach the Qi Cultivation Realm before thirty... it will do you good. This potion is astonishingly effective, a treasured ancestral elixir that must remain a secret."

"Understood!"

Li Xicheng's face lit up as he accepted the bottle. After taking a Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, he patiently awaited further instructions.

Li Yuanjiao waved his hand with a smile and said, "Go now, find a cave dwelling and attempt your breakthrough in seclusion."

Li Xicheng nodded then retreated. Li Yuanjiao took out several pills and spirit items from his storage pouch, arranging them on the desk before writing a brief note to Li Yuanping.

"Cheng can be the mainstay of the clan. He is respectful to his elders and cherishes his younger peers. Second Uncle lived frugally when he was still alive, and the second lineage suffered. Wutu Peak shall provide the sustenance and spirit resources he needs."

After putting away his brush and ink, the smile on Li Yuanjiao's face slowly faded. He gazed into the distant sky, piercing through layers of clouds, and thought he saw a handsome and dignified face smiling back at him.

Brothers bound together by blood should stay united...

Big Brother...

————

Meanwhile on Mount Lijing...

Li Ximing had not returned home in two years. Upon his return, he and his father, Li Yuanping, discussed family affairs late into the night. After their long conversation, he first visited his mother, then Madam Dou.

Madam Dou, the wife of Li Xuanxuan and mother of Li Yuanping, was a distinguished Qi Cultivator within the clan, known for her formidable abilities.
𝕗𝕣𝐞𝐞𝘄𝐞𝚋𝚗𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗹.𝚌𝕠𝚖

Li Ximing, who had always been dearly loved by his grandmother since childhood, was now also a Qi Cultivator. Upon their reunion, she eagerly handed him pills and spirit items, whispering, "These are from your grandmother's maternal family... Just use them without reservation!"

Li Ximing smiled wryly as he accepted them, then spent a few days settling a few family matters. Finally finding some leisure time, he sat on the stone steps of the small courtyard under the moonlight and began meticulously organizing his medicine pouch.

Xiao Yuansi had prepared a set of medicine-gathering techniques for him. Li Ximing had devoted himself to studying it and was now seeing modest benefits. At least, he could now store most spirit items of the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realms without damaging their medicinal properties.

Brother Cheng invited me to Eastern Mount Yue. He has probably prepared a few spirit items... Big Brother always puts others before him...

As he was lost in thought, a sudden tap on his shoulder startled him. Unguarded in the safety of his own home's formation, he looked up with a smile to see a figure with sharp eyebrows and bright eyes.

"Xijun!"

Li Xijun, usually somber and reserved, rarely smiled. Seeing his brother after so many years brought a smile to his face as he leaned in, sniffing. "You have a strong scent of herbs on you!" he commented playfully.

Li Ximing replied with a warm smile, "That's how Master Xiao's medicine-gathering technique is... The scent is quite potent but it can sharpen your mind and soothe your soul."

"You seem to have softened up quite a bit," he added.

Li Xijun stood with his hands clasped behind him. Among the brothers from the generation of Xi and Yue, he most embodied the Li Family's spirit. While Li Xicheng was generous and Li Xizhi was graceful, Li Ximing was gentle. Only Li Xijun remained cautious and skeptical, carrying his sword with him everywhere he went.

Li Ximing chuckled and asked, "I heard you've been training diligently on Mount Yuting every day... What brings you home so suddenly?"

"Second Uncle sent for me."

Li Xijun's face turned slightly gloomy as he continued in a subdued tone, "I wonder why Uncle Jiao summoned me up the mountain. He spoke of Big Brother's generous nature, insisting that it not be taken for granted... He also mentioned that I am more talented and should watch out for my big brother."

His gray-black eyes shimmered in the moonlight, giving him a particularly striking look as he added with a hint of suspicion, "I wonder if he's indirectly blaming me... Given my big brother's nature, who wouldn't get along with him? Could someone be gossiping..?"

Li Ximing replied softly, "Uncle Jiao lost his brother when he was younger... Perhaps he was just being emotional and fearing that history would repeat itself. I've heard that the performances in the Liyuan Theater below the mountain often leave the audience in tears, regardless of their age."

The two fell silent for a while. Li Xijun, cradling his sword, finally spoke softly after a long pause.

"Brother Cheng is gradually taking over home affairs. Our half-brothers have families of their own, you and I are approaching the Qi Cultivation Realm and Second Uncle is nearing the Foundation Establishment Realm... The clan's future will soon rest in our hands."

He turned his head slightly to the side, the cold blade in his arms catching the moonlight and gleaming coldly as he chuckled.

"Study well with the fire, while I take to the snowy paths... With your medicine and my blade, the clan has nothing to fear!"

Li Ximing laughed in cheerful agreement.

"Indeed!"

The two brothers shared spirit wine under the moonlight, conversing through the night—from Azure Pond to Jiangnan and its northern reaches. It was only when dawn broke, painting the world in golden red, that they staggered to their beds.




# Chapter 415: Dawn Colored Qi

In the Azure Pond Sect...

A brisk breeze swept along the quiet path as a cultivator, covered from head to toe, sped along the road. The white glow beneath his feet was a clear sign that the Divine Movement Spell was activated.

Finally back...

Li Xizhi looked weary with a furrowed brow as he navigated the path at the base of Qingsui Peak, his black robe tattered and dusty.

This assignment lasted two whole months! There are countless matters to address below the mountain... without my prior experience at home, this would have been quite the challenge.

Not every disciple of the Azure Pond Sect could focus solely on cultivation; worldly distractions often interrupted their practices.

The nature of these distractions varied—some trivial, others troublesome—and their assignment typically depended on the influence of their immortal peak within the sect.

Qingsui Peak had been in decline for years.

Under Si Yuanbai's protection, Li Chejing could cultivate in peace most of the time. Si Yuanbai's profound skills in the way of talisman and his backing in the sect shielded his disciples from menial tasks.

But now, since Yuan Tuan lacked significant influence or backing in the sect, Li Xizhi often got the shorter end of the stick. His responsibilities often required him to leave the mountain and work his fingers to the bone.

Moreover, with the arrival of more sword cultivators to the other peaks, Li Xizhi dared not reveal himself and could only lament his plight inwardly.

These swordsmen were primarily qi cultivators who liked to challenge him to duels, promising to suppress their cultivation to make it a fair fight. They had trained with the sword for a few more decades than Li Xizhi.

Putting aside their profound mastery of the sword, with the viciousness gleaming in their eyes alone, Li Xizhi knew that he was no match for them.

Fearing he might embarrass himself and Qingsui Peak, Li Xizhi always made his journeys up and down the mountain as inconspicuous as possible, wrapped tightly in his cloak to maintain a low profile and avoid trouble.

When he finally reached the platform on the summit, he took a deep breath and looked up.

The bamboo forest before him swayed in the wind, leaves fluttering down and surrounding a green deer that was as tall as a human.

Atop it sat a Daoist woman with a lovely face, who was watching him silently.

"Master!" Li Xizhi greeted her respectfully.

Yuan Tuan nodded but said nothing about his unusual attire, seemingly unsurprised.

"I've brought you the cultivation technique," she said softly.

She extended a slender arm, presenting a pale yellow jade slip. Li Xizhi accepted it eagerly, and a quick scan with his spiritual sense revealed its contents—Dawn Dew Gathering Technique.

Instant relief washed over him as Yuan Tuan continued, "This is also a Grade Four technique. While it may not rival the teachings exclusive to the immortal peaks of direct lineage, it is on par with the sect's standard cultivation technique. It's challenging to master, which deters many from practicing it... The content is only available up to the Foundation Establishment Realm."

Li Xizhi listened in silence, not questioning why his master had not chosen the superior Clear Essence Rain Control Technique.

Yuan Tuan moved her lips slightly but her whispers seemed to echo directly in his ears.

"Most of this cultivation technique's Dao Partners are lost... Only several incomplete legacies remain in Wu State, so there's no cause for concern."

Li Xizhi could not fathom the trouble Yuan Tuan had gone through to secure this cultivation technique. Moved, he began to express his gratitude.

"Master's kindness is..."

However, Yuan Tuan cut him off abruptly with a gentle voice.

"It is what I should do."

She locked eyes with him as she continued, "This cultivation technique requires you to gather Dawn Colored Qi, but it's a rather troublesome process as it requires one to ascend to the clouds and descend into deep valleys. The sect would never hand over the qi gathering technique to your family so they could help you collect it either... The only option is to purchase the spiritual qi from the sect—and at a steep price."

Li Xizhi looked up, his voice tense with unease.

"About the price..."

"A hundred and twenty Spirit Stones."

Yuan Tuan's voice was cold, tinged with a hint of vexation.

The amount shocked Li Xizhi, causing him to bow his head as a tumultuous conflict waged within him.

Yuan Tuan added, "Should your family coffers fall short, I will provide the remainder."

"Thank you, master!"

Li Xizhi kneeled and bowed deeply in respect. When he rose, Yuan Tuan had already vanished.

He wandered to his small courtyard in a daze, wordlessly lighting a lamp and spreading out a sheet of letter paper, yet he just stared at it for a long time and wrote nothing.

Under the flickering yellow lamplight that cast a golden-red glow over his face, Li Xizhi pursed his lips.

A single drop of ink fell from his brush.

Setting the brush aside, he replaced the spoiled paper with a fresh sheet, but his anxiety persisted and he began zoning out once more.

————

Li Ximing bid farewell to his family and relatives at the Li Residence and set out to return to the Xiao Residence.

Although he had yet to achieve Qi Cultivation Realm, the dharma artifact on his wrist—the Azure Manifestation—had transformed into a barking deer with vibrant green markings, playfully bounding along behind him.

Concerned for his safety in a region now teeming with devil cultivators, the Li Family refused to let Li Ximing return to the Xiao Residence alone.

Although the deer was a lot faster than Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, the journey would still take several days and was fraught with danger.

Without needing any suggestion from the clan, Li Yuanjiao decided to personally escort Li Ximing on the wind.

Winter had arrived early this year, bringing flurries of snow.

After Li Yuanjiao departed with Li Ximing, Li Yuanping assigned tasks to the other men. Just as they were also about to disperse, a streak of white light appeared in the distance, rapidly descending upon the grand formation.

"Yuan Huyuan from the Yuan Family has come to pay his respects! Please open the mountain gate!"
𝓯𝙧𝙚𝙚𝔀𝒆𝓫𝓷𝙤𝓿𝒆𝙡.𝒄𝙤𝓶

His voice, amplified by mana, echoed as Li Yuanping watched from within the mountain, momentarily startled.

Yuan Huyuan...? Why is he here?

Yuan Huyuan, a peak qi cultivator from the Yuan Family's direct lineage, held an esteemed position despite little hope of achieving Foundation Establishment Realm. He stood outside patiently, clad in dharma clothes.

With Li Yuanjiao away, Li Qinghong took charge. She rode the wind and exited the grand formation, clasping her hands together and greeting the man in a clear voice.

"Li Qinghong of the Li Family greets Senior..."

Clad in jade armor and carrying a spear on her back, her appearance was striking. Although Yuan Huyuan was nearly a century old, his eyes shone brightly with recognition.

He stroked his beard and smiled.

"Ah, so you're the thunder cultivator of your esteemed clan... I've heard much about you."

He politely reached out with his spiritual sense and quickly retracted it. A look of surprise appeared on his face.

"To think you've reached the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm already! And at such a young age—barely thirty! That's..."

Li Qinghong, uninterested in prolonging the discussion about her accomplishments, which she assumed he mentioned out of courtesy, offered a polite smile.

"What brings you here, Senior...?" she asked politely.

"Ah."

Regaining his composure, Yuan Huyuan retrieved a sealed letter from his sleeve, despite the lingering look of disbelief on his face.

"My family received a few letters, one of them was from Xizhi, so I came to deliver it," he explained.

Given Yuan Huyuan's stature, Li Qinghong surmised that there must be a significant reason for his personal visit. He must have something important that could not be discussed outside the formation. She accepted the letter and swiftly stowed it in her sleeve pocket.

"Please come in and have a seat, Senior," she invited with a smile.

"Sure!"

Yuan Huyuan accepted the offer immediately, and the two flew into the formation together. Below them, Li Yuanping had already tidied the hall. By the time they stepped inside, even the spirit tea had been prepared readily.

Yuan Huyuan exchanged a few pleasantries with Li Qinghong before smoothly transitioning to the main topic.

"How is Senior Tongya these days?" he asked softly.

Yuan Huyuan's initial visit to the Li Family was to escort Li Chejing home. At that time, his cultivation had already reached the middle stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, while Li Tongya was merely a humble Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator. Now that he was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Yuan Huyuan had to address him as senior with due respect.

Li Qinghong chuckled and replied, "I'm sorry that his absence disappoints you, Senior. You've come at the wrong time, and our ancestor is currently cultivating in seclusion."

"Ah..."

Yuan Huyuan gave her a look but did not dwell on the subject. Instead, he changed the topic.

"Your family's Xizhi has been cultivating at Qingsui Peak and has become quite formidable, now at the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. I've come on behalf of Ancestor Yuan Tuan to ask this as both of us are Xi Zhi's elders—with the child close to advancing to Qi Cultivation Realm, does your family have any plans for him?"

Li Qinghong feigned surprise before responding without hesitation.

"The cultivation techniques available in the sect are certainly superior to those of my humble clan... We shall let your family ancestor decide."

"Haha," Yuan Huyuan chuckled dryly and replied, "Our ancestor, of course, wants the best for Xizhi. The Grade Four Clear Essence Rain Control Technique is naturally a good choice, but she is thinking of trying out a Grade Five technique..."

"Among the Azure Pond legacies, the Grade Five Dark Floating Compliant Cloud Sutra is exclusive to the Chi Family's direct lineage, and the Heavenly Pronouncement Sutra is a secret that we guard closely..."

Yuan Huyuan shared several points before pausing. He chuckled and then continued, "There are many ancient techniques available though. I wonder how your esteemed family views them..."

Li Qinghong sipped her tea and eyed Yuan Huyuan, who nearly had the Supreme Yin Moonlight written across his forehead. With a resigned thought, she mused, Does he think I'm gullible? This is all too obvious!

A soft chuckle escaped her vermilion lips and she replied, "The Li Family is of humble background, we put our faith in the Old Ancestor."

"Very well... You're an understanding person, young lady."

Yuan Huyuan nodded, despite being secretly surprised. He was a seasoned cultivator now over a century old, and usually treated people with generosity and kindness. His venerable status also carried considerable influence across various families.

Had it not been for the Ancestor Yuan Licheng's greedy scheming, Yuan Huyuan would never have stooped to such measures. With a sigh of relief, he smiled and said, "I have some good news to share with you, young lady."

Li Qinghong gestured for him to continue and Yuan Huyuan announced, "Fellow Daoist Li Xuanfeng from your esteemed clan has successfully established his immortal foundation, Engraved Stone, in Yi Mountain City!"

"What! Uncle Xuanfeng has achieved Foundation Establishment Realm?!" Li Qinghong exclaimed, her face lighting up with a genuine smile.

"Many thanks for this joyful news, Senior Yuan!"

Yuan Huyuan nodded, his face beaming as he replied, "Congratulations! Your family now boasts three generations of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators—truly the mark of a prestigious clan!"

Although the inclusion of Li Mutian in his statement stretched the truth somewhat, it was meant as a felicitous remark. Li Qinghong smiled and thanked him, then heard the rustling sound of falling snow as a man dressed in a black robe entered the hall.

Li Yuanjiao had just returned from escorting Li Ximing. Along the way, he encountered and defeated a devil cultivator. He was merely at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, far below his own capabilities. With a decisive palm strike, Li Yuanjiao ended the confrontation almost instantly and seized the cultivator's storage pouch easily.

Shaking the snow from his cloak, he tossed the blood-stained pouch onto the desk, exhaling warm breaths into the cold air. Glancing at Yuan Huyuan, he asked, "And you are...?"

"Yuan Huyuan from the Yuan Family," the man replied. After Li Qinghong explained the situation to Li Yuanjiao, he smiled at the man and said, "Greetings, Senior."

Li Yuanjiao was not surprised by the news, having already anticipated it.

Yuan Huyuan added, "Furthermore, Senior Xuanfeng has been promoted by Daoist Master Yuan Su and serves as a general in Yishan City... He could be considered a distinguished member of the Azure Pond Sect now."

The siblings exchanged a glance with each other. Given their family's unpleasant history with the Azure Pond Sect in the past, they had already lost their trust in those Purple Mansion Realm cultivators long ago. They could only muster a strained smile, bracing for potential complications.

Yuan Huyuan then mysteriously remarked, "Daoist Master Yuan Su has always been a loner and kept his distance from the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators within the sect. He has neither immortal peaks nor prestigious clans under his command. Your family could seize this opportunity..."

Seeing the thoughtful looks on the siblings' faces, Yuan Huyuan laughed heartily and cupped his fist.

"Well... I've delivered the message. I shall take my leave now!"

After the siblings had escorted Yuan Huyuan out of the formation, they returned to the hall, still puzzled.

Li Yuanjiao then mused, "I heard that Daoist Master Yuan Su's immortal foundation is Spring's Echo, which has completely nothing to do with Engraved Stone... This immortal foundation is probably only valuable in the Golden Tang Gate..."

A thought suddenly struck Li Qinghong as she remarked, "Spring's Echo? Our family has a cultivation technique related to that—Uncle Xuan's Cave Spring Clear Spirit Technique, though it's merely Grade Three and can only be cultivated to the Foundation Establishment Realm. If it's from the Azure Pond Sect, even the technique to form this immortal dao will surely surpass Grade Three."

Realizing their speculation led nowhere, they finally gave up in resignation. Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao pulled out a green-colored jade bottle from a storage pouch.

"Take a look at this," he said with a grin.

His journey to the Xiao Family involved more than just escorting his nephew.

Back then, Li Xuanxuan had unknowingly acquired a spirit water of heaven and earth from a devil cultivator's storage pouch in the marketplace. For a long time, they had not been able to identify it. So, Li Yuanjiao had taken the opportunity to consult Xiao Yuansi himself.

Xiao Yuansi, well-versed and insightful, quickly referenced several books before determining the substance's nature.

Seeing Li Qinghong's baffled expression, Li Yuanjiao explained, "This spirit water of heaven and earth is comparable to a treasured panacea. Named Earth Fiend's Cold Spring, it could quench fire poison, replenish baleful qi, and harmonize with numerous techniques—truly valuable spirit water!"

"Comparable to a treasured panacea..?" Li Qinghong repeated, tightening her grip on the bottle.

A Treasured panacea was far more significant than mere spirit items of the Foundation Establishment Realm. While items like Wanglin Blossom qualified as a spirit item of the Foundation Establishment Realm, they could not be called treasured panacea.

The distinction was profound—Foundation Establishment Realm spirit items benefited only cultivators in that realm, whereas the treasured panacea possessed miraculous properties that even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators coveted.

The two siblings put away the spirit water of heaven and earth and took out Li Xizhi's letter, carefully reading it.

After a moment, Li Yuanjiao silently put the letter away. Li Qinghong stood up, holding her spear. Having scanned the letter with her spiritual sense and read its contents, she clenched her jaw and said gloomily, "A hundred and twenty Spirit Stones? Are they crazy?! What kind of spiritual qi of heaven and earth costs that much? It's extortion!"

Although that was what she said, Li Qinghong looked at her silent elder brother, unsure of his thoughts. She then asked tentatively, "Are we still amassing the funds for Zhi'er?"

Li Yuanjiao put the letter away gently, then gritted his teeth. He raised his eyebrows, looking somber as he replied, "Yes... Even if it means selling off all the spirit items in our treasury."

He paused and then asked in a deep voice, "How many Spirit Stones do we have in our family's savings?"

Li Yuanping, who was nearby, stepped forward and replied, "More than eighty."

As soon as Li Yuanping answered his question, he quickly added, "It's almost time to pay our tributes though, Big Brother! After we gave Qingxiao a sum of Spirit Stones, we're already struggling... We can't afford to spend these savings!"




# Chapter 417: Setting Sun

"I know," Li Yuanjiao said, waving his hand dismissively.

He picked up the storage pouch he got from the Embryonic Breathing Realm devil cultivator he had killed earlier on his way home and began sifting through its contents quietly.

"The clan's vault still holds the mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm Azure Blades... We can sell them to build the emergency funds. As for that Six-Stone Cloud Plate... It's a rare dharma shield produced by the Azure Pond. We should keep that for ourselves," he said thoughtfully.

After considering his options, he finally put the pouch away, adding, "Considering this was an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator, the capacity of his pouch is small—hardly the size of a tabletop. Everything inside is probably worth only ten Spirit Stones in total."

Despite this, the devil cultivator was actually considered wealthier than most of his peers in the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Li Yuanjiao stowed the items just as Li Qinghong, who had been quietly observing, spoke up.

"The second lineage has nothing much to offer, but I have nine Spirit Stones. You can have them, Big Brother."

Without waiting for a response, she handed the stones to Li Yuanjiao, who accepted them silently.

"Thanks, I owe you."

Li Xizhi was his only son. Selling dharma artifacts was the limit of what he could leverage from the clan without causing a scandal. In other families, such actions might have led to accusations of selfishness and provoked internal strife, and it is not something that could be settled with a mere discussion.

Li Qinghong merely shrugged and chuckled.

"They're yours now."

They looked at each other for a moment before a smile broke across their faces. As soon as Li Yuanjiao put away the pouch he was going through, he took a few more Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts out of the store room. He unfolded a map and scanned it briefly, intending to find a marketplace.

"Now that the Cloud Crowned Peak market is destroyed, it takes much longer to reach other marketplaces," he murmured while analyzing the map before him. He initially planned to head to the Yuan Family's market but after estimating the distance, he realized that the Smoke Valley Market to the west in the desert was much closer.

"I'll head to Smoke Valley Market then! With communications being so unreliable now, this is a good chance for me to meet up with Uncle Donghe."

————

Li Yuanjiao packed his belongings on the mountain hastily before departing. The snowfall intensified, drifting like goose feathers and blanketing the town and mountains in white. Li Xijun, accompanied by a group of elders, bid farewell to Li Ximing before returning to the mountain himself.

He walked in the snow with his hands clasped behind his back. His thin and bright clothing stood out against the increasingly ethereal landscape.

Unlike his elder brother Li Xicheng, who was burdened with many clan responsibilities, Li Xijun enjoyed an easier role at the Clan Affairs Courtyard. He spent his days training in seclusion, occasionally descending the mountain to slay demons.

After walking about a dozen li, Mount Yuting loomed ahead, its peak covered in snow and peppered with green pines.

"Upon Yuting's pines the snow falls, chasing away evil with its silent thrall..." Li Xijun murmured.

Having cultivated on Mount Yuting for many years, he had seen the pines multiply, and the mountain itself seemed to stretch ever higher, almost piercing the clouds. Li Qinghong, the town's guardian, wielded thunder to vanquish demons. The four towns at the base of Mount Yuting often celebrated her with poetry. Li Xijun had read some of them and even remembered a few lines.

Approaching the mountain's base with his sword in arms, he was met by two figures who bowed respectfully upon seeing him.

"Greetings, Young Master."

They were the An Family's brothers—An Siming and An Siwei. Both of them were a few years older than Li Xijun, and were sent by Li Yuanping to train at Yuting Peak.

An Siming had a sword at his side, while An Siwei carried a spear on his back. Both wore gold rings around their wrists. Li Xijun exchanged a few pleasantries with them before opening the grand formation with a secret seal. The golden light flickered slowly just as it opened.

An Siming stepped forward, hesitating before saying softly, "Young Master, our younger sister at home is twelve this year. She has a spiritual orifice and is in the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm... Not only that, she has a lovely face and..."

He looked rather awkward and was stumbling slightly over his words. Li Xijun, holding his sword, stepped forward with the grand formation closing behind him. He trudged through the snow, asking, "Is Master An thinking of aligning An Family with the second lineage through marriage?"

Both men affirmed eagerly, then offered some nice words. However, Li Xijun merely laughed and said, "After my father's passing, the second lineage is now led by my aunt. If she and the clan agree, I can certainly meet your sister."

Upon hearing his reply, the two brothers could only nod in agreement. Li Xijun gazed at the white snow dusting the pines and sighed.

"This matter is not ours to decide..."

The An brothers nodded in understanding. Running his thumb along the sheath of his sword, Li Xijun let his thoughts wander.

The An Family members are all very talented. If Second Uncle fails to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, at least my two brothers-in-law will become peak Qi Cultivators in fifty years... By then, perhaps my father-in-law will also reach peak Qi Cultivation Realm or beyond...

He caught a falling snowflake and watched it melt in his palm.

The An Family is unaware that my family is protected by a mirror... They likely worry that if their daughter marries into our first lineage, their children could meet a grim fate, and marrying into the second lineage might require them to shoulder the heavy responsibility of overseeing the family's affairs.

An Zheyan is probably clueless, so Li Feiruo had to send these brothers to test the waters.

Just then, a clump of snow fell from a green pine, disrupting Li Xijun's thoughts. He smiled at the brothers and said courteously, "I'm ascending the mountain to resume my training."

Li Yuanjiao had been riding on the wind for half the day and he crossed the center of Moongaze Lake to its western shore. The area was dotted with both large and small mountain ranges, home to dozens of immortal cultivation families. Most were Embryonic Breathing Realm families, with very few being Qi Cultivation Realm families.

This region was under the domain of a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm rogue cultivator named Daoist He, a recluse who had little to do with the wider world, subsisting on offerings collected within his small parcel of land. The nearby families wisely chose not to provoke him.

Continuing along the western shore, a towering mountain that split the sky soon came into view. The terrain was rugged and narrow with a stark, rocky summit, and the spiritual energy here was sparse. Known as Xiping, this mountain marked the boundary between the arid desert and Moongaze Lake; it also served as the frontier between the Azure Pond Sect and the Golden Feather Sect.

After traversing Mount Xiping, the climate immediately turned hot and dry. Days of flying brought the gradual emergence of yellow sands, and soon, an imposing pass loomed ahead—Smoke Valley Pass, an ancient stronghold in Yue State, now occupied by the Golden Feather Sect's Smoke Valley Temple.

As Li Yuanjiao approached the pass, his spiritual sense detected the heat and light of a powerful grand formation, ready to activate at a moment's notice.

"Li Yuanjiao from Lijing's Li Family has arrived to pay respects. Please open the grand formation, Temple Master!" he said as he transmitted his voice via mana.
𝐟𝗿𝐞𝚎𝚠𝐞𝚋𝕟𝐨𝚟𝐞𝕝.𝕔𝕠𝚖

Moments later, a Daoist priest emerged from the formation. His cultivation was modest, at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. However, his half-yellow and half-white robe looked somewhat unusual. Nevertheless, he greeted Li Yuanjiao with a broad smile.

"Greetings, fellow Daoist! I am Bai Yinzi from Smoke Valley!"

Li Yuanjiao returned the smile, observing the priest's overly humble demeanor and eager expression.

"Are you here to see Daoist Donghe? Come with me inside, fellow Daoist!" the man said in a welcoming manner.

Although Chen Donghe had resided here for many years, Li Yuanjiao was still too wary to follow the man inside. His gaze lingered on Bai Yinzi's face before chuckling and resting his hand on the hilt of his sword.

"I prefer to stay here. Please get Uncle Donghe to come out here," he said.

Bai Yinzi's face fell slightly as he wiped the sweat on his face, his lips quivering as he replied hesitantly, "I'm afraid that won't be convenient! Daoist Donghe has sustained injuries and shouldn't be moving around... It's better for you to come inside, fellow Daoist."

Li Yuanjiao laughed and replied, "Is that so?"

Bai Yinzi breathed a sigh of relief, his smile returning. However, as Li Yuanjiao advanced a step forward, his expression abruptly hardened, turning fierce.

"Such audacity!" he boomed.

He had already unsheathed the Qingche Sword. The blade gleamed brightly, emitting a piercing whistle as Li Yuanjiao executed the Celestial Moon Slash technique.

Bai Yinzi felt a sharp cut on his face. With a horrified cry, he hastily summoned his earth-yellow Tortoise Shield dharma artifact, pleading miserably, "You've misunderstood me, fellow Daoist! Spare me... please!"

Li Yuanjiao, however, was not inclined to trust this man. Thoughts raced through his mind like lightning.

Is Uncle Donghe still inside? He's trying to lure me into the formation... there must be no other Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators around. I must hold him hostage and see if I can negotiate for Uncle Donghe's release. If that doesn't work out, I can at least avenge him!

As these thoughts flashed through his mind, his sword arc struck the shield. This Tortoise Shield, likely a prized dharma artifact of the temple and appearing to be of high-grade Qi Cultivation Realm, wailed under the impact. The Qingche Sword, a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma weapon, proved far superior.

Bai Yinzi's face flushed red from the exertion and fear as he cried out desperately, "Daoist Donghe! Come quickly! Your family is about to kill me!"

These words caught Li Yuanjiao off guard, and he relented slightly.

"Let go of your dharma artifact and I'll spare you!" he said.

Bai Yinzi's face was still crimson. He shut his eyes and stood frozen on the spot as the light on his dharma artifact slowly faded. With his sword held to the man's throat, Li Yuanjiao was somewhat convinced by the man now and began to feel rather awkward.

"Young Master! Young Master!"

A middle-aged man flew out of the formation, looking pale and with several medicinal packs attached to his body. He smiled wryly and assured Li Yuanjiao, "This is a misunderstanding..."

Li Yuanjiao sheathed his sword, then bowed slightly to Bai Yinzi and apologized with mild embarrassment.

"Sorry, fellow Daoist..."

Still trembling with fright, Bai Yinzi muttered, "I see... Such is the might of the sword immortal clan... Half of my soul nearly fled my body as soon as you raised your sword."

Chen Donghe also apologized to Bai Yinzi. Having regained his composure, Bai Yinzi waved off the incident and simply replied, "It was my poor choice of words that caused the misunderstanding... I should be the one apologizing. You have been most gracious, Young Master!"

Despite being away from home for many years, Chen Donghe respectfully addressed Li Yuanjiao as Young Master, consequently influencing Bai Yinzi to do the same too. Li Yuanjiao said nothing and simply allowed them to address him that way.

With the misunderstanding resolved, Bai Yinzi let out a long sigh and was finally comfortable enough to speak normally.

"It's no surprise that your esteemed clan could thrive in the treacherous territories of the Azure Pond Sect, expand its territory, and ascend to become such a prestigious clan... Such determination is truly beyond my emulation!"

Having sheathed his sword, Li Yuanjiao's stern features relaxed. Although he no longer looked as vicious as earlier, he still looked rather fierce.

Bai Yinzi clicked his tongue in admiration before continuing, "The Golden Feather Sect, under which I serve, also imposes a hefty immortal tax. Yet, it's nothing compared to the ruthless measures of the Azure Pond Sect. They obliterate opposition at every opportunity. Even when temples are annexed, we must report to the Golden Feather Sect before proceeding with any further mergers, and we certainly do not resort to killing everyone..."

"In my opinion, the Azure Pond Sect and Gold Tang Gate behave no differently than devil cultivators. Let's keep our conversation between us, lest we be accused of slandering the immortal sect..." he added with a slow shake of his head, almost as though in dejection.

Li Yuanjiao listened patiently to Bai Yinzi's tirades. As soon as Bai Yinzi paused to catch his breath, Li Yuanjiao seized the opportunity to turn to Chen Donghe, his voice filled with concern as he asked, "What has gotten you into this state?"

"Devil cultivators!"

Chen Donghe was now at the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. A smile appeared on his pale face as he explained, "A few days ago, a band of devil cultivators headed north, passing by Smoke Valley Temple over Mount Xiping. I helped the temple cultivators defend the grand formation, but I sustained some injuries and have been bedridden for many days. I requested the temple master to come out and greet you, but I didn't know that would end up causing a misunderstanding..."

Upon hearing this, Li Yuanjiao pressed further, eager for details.

"Where did those devil cultivators go?"

"After a prolonged battle, they crossed Mount Xiping and likely headed to the west shore," Chen Donghe replied.

Li Yuanjiao estimated the timing and realized he likely could not catch up to them now, so he could only sigh regretfully.

The fact that those devil cultivators failed to breach this grand formation meant that most of them were early-stage Qi Cultivators. If Li Yuanjiao could rally the cultivators in his family to intercept them, they could potentially eliminate the threat and loot them to amass funds.

Li Yuanjiao then retrieved several pills from his storage pouch and handed them to Chen Donghe, whose own supply had long been depleted in the fierce battle. Gratefully accepting the supplies, Chen Donghe expressed his gratitude.

He smiled and introduced the other man, saying, "This is Bai Yinzi, the temple master who has greatly aided me over the years, providing everything from rations to spirit vein support. He is truly a kind and honest soul!"

Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist and acknowledged Bai Yinzi, while Bai Yinzi waved his hand and laughed.

"Daoist Donghe has also been a great help to me over these years... He has defeated several rivals at the temple fair. I owe him much for the support and am more than happy to provide food and lodging for him."

Chen Donghe responded with a warm laugh, and Bai Yinzi continued enthusiastically, "Fellow Daoist Donghe is a good-natured person. Even those he has defeated admire him... He's earned quite a reputation across this desert over the years!"

The two continued conversing for some time. Bai Yinzi then invited them both back to drink and feast until the sunset. Eventually, Chen Donghe finally returned to his courtyard with Li Yuanjiao.

As they closed the door behind them, they activated an isolating formation. In the center of the courtyard sat an old woman, her face etched with wrinkles around her eyes and on her forehead. She held an oil lamp which illuminated the paper she was writing on with a brush. Looking up as the two men entered, she greeted them softly.

"Ah... You are here, Jiao'er."

"Auntie..."

Li Yuanjiao hesitated for a moment before recognizing her. Li Jingtian had aged significantly, now over fifty and drastically different from his memories, except for her eyes, which remained as gentle and warm as ever.

It was rare for mortals of Mount Dali to reach such an age. Chen Donghe had been nourishing Li Jingtian with spirit items, so she still seemed to be in good health.

With a smile, she asked, "How is everything at home? Is Second Uncle still doing well?"

Hearing her questions, Li Yuanjiao's composure faltered, and tears welled up in his eyes. He shut his eyes, his hand gripping the hilt of his Qingche Sword which buzzed and vibrated with his emotion.

With a sorrowful tone, he revealed, "The Old Ancestor has left this world to express his gratitude to the Supreme Yin..."

Upon hearing this, Li Jingtian's face immediately paled and tears streamed down her cheeks. Chen Donghe also seemed to be taken aback by the news as the expression on his face changed and he stood frozen in place.

"I see... this moment has finally come..."

Although Li Jingtian had received a few pieces of news from home and had somewhat mentally prepared herself, Chen Donghe reacted as if struck by lightning, his face contorted in disbelief.

"Impossible... How can this be?!" he cried aloud.

Chen Donghe, normally composed even in the direst of circumstances, had completely lost his composure. His face contorted with a torrent of emotions. Taking a few steps back, his eyes darkened as he uttered in disbelief, "Unless a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator intervened, who could possibly have killed Second Uncle?!"

Without thinking, Chen Donghe had also addressed him as Second Uncle. His face flushed as he gasped for breath. Li Yuanjiao quickly reached out to support him, channeling qi through his meridians. After a moment, Chen Donghe coughed up a mouthful of black blood.

Since he had sustained internal injuries, his complexion visibly improved after he spat out the blood. Looking up, he asked, "Was it an old wound from Maha?"

"Yes..."

With this confirmation, Chen Donghe wiped away the blood from the corner of his mouth and murmured, "The heavens must be envious of the talented... To think that all the four brothers of Lijing died so silently!"

Li Yuanjiao turned his head away slightly, as the family had not acknowledged Li Chejing's death. Chen Donghe, who had supported them for years, must have had his reasons for keeping such matters close to his heart. Now, overcome with emotion, he had let the words slip.

After being comforted by Li Jingtian for a moment, Chen Donghe regained his composure. He hung his head and apologized, "I'm sorry you had to see that."

Unable to find the right words of comfort, Li Yuanjiao continued to focus on helping Chen Donghe fix his meridians.

Chen Donghe then remarked, "Please allow me to rest for a bit. Tomorrow, I will take you to Smoke Valley Market."

Li Yuanjiao nodded, and the couple supported each other as they moved toward the inner courtyard.

Soon after, the sound of muffled sobs could be heard from the doorway.

Li Yuanjiao sat in silence and was lost in his own thoughts, now all alone in the courtyard. The tea on the table remained untouched, its colors mingling with the hues of the blood-red sunset.

He rested his hand on his knee, gazing toward the red sun dipping below the desert horizon as he let out a sigh. Smoke rose in shapes that resembled serpents, whales, wolves, and snakes, all melding into the dark red distant sky.




# Chapter 419: Compassionate Appearance

Located in the desert, the street of Smoke Valley Market was paved with sandstone. After walking for a bit, Chen Donghe and Li Yuanjiao heard the calls of merchants hawking their wares. As they raised their gaze, a sea of people stretched before them.

During their walk, Li Yuanjiao shared the news of Li Xuanfeng's breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm with Chen Donghe, who looked slightly better upon hearing it, though his tone suggested that he had already expected this.

"Xuanfeng has always been extraordinary since young. He's the most talented among all his brothers, so his achievement was to be expected," Chen Donghe had remarked simply.

After walking a little more, Chen Donghe had pretty much returned to his usual self. He pointed at the bustling crowd and explained, "Despite the barrenness of Smoke Valley Desert, it is rich in spirit resources and ores. Cultivators from all directions flock here, making the number of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators here far surpass those at Cloud Crowned Peak."

He looked around cautiously, his voice diminishing to a whisper before shifting to mana transmission.

"Ultimately, it's due to the Golden Feather Sect's lax control over the temples and their handling of rogue cultivators. This balance allows many lower-ranked cultivators to thrive peacefully here, their numbers dwarfing those at Azure Pond."

Li Yuanjiao observed the crowd around them and nodded in agreement. "The Azure Pond Sect has the largest number of Purple Mansion, Foundation Establishment, and Qi cultivators though. It sees less return from the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators than it could gain from regular annexations and purges... This also ensures that the incapable naturally yield to the more capable and talented. Thus, valuable resources aren't squandered on mediocrity."

After serving the Azure Pond Sect for such a long time now, the Li Family had naturally developed deep connections and insights over the years. Li Yuanjiao elaborated, "The many Embryonic Breathing Realm families in the region can only cultivate Spirit Paddies and must contend with others... They will never be able to compete with Foundation Establishment prestigious clans with high-ranking cultivators in their ranks."

His gaze lingered on the market stalls briefly as he sighed.

"Yet, I must admit that the Azure Pond Sect's systems and strategies are more ruthless and sophisticated, enabling them to evolve from a minor sect on Mount Azure Pond to the formidable entity that they are today."

Chen Donghe fell silent. The atmosphere grew somber, prompting them to shift the conversation. Li Yuanjiao furrowed his brow.
𝙛𝒓𝒆𝙚𝒘𝒆𝓫𝙣𝓸𝙫𝓮𝒍.𝒄𝒐𝓶

"Uncle Donghe, I brought a bottle of Minor Pure Spiritual Qi with me. It's a common item, yet I've seen none for sale. Why is that?" he asked.

Chen Donghe pointed at the pervasive yellow sand and explained, "Minor Pure Spiritual Qi can only be collected from mountains and forests, which are absent in the desert. The people have found various ways to resolve this issue since ancient times. Historically, the locals have devised various alternatives... Nowadays, most have adopted Minor Quicksand Qi as a substitute. Minor Pure Spiritual Qi is now rarely seen and not worth much."

Chen Donghe's explanation enlightened Li Yuanjiao. The two then searched for a shop and traded the Azure Blades for fifty Spirit Stones.

Although the Azure Blades were mid-quality Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts, it was unfortunate that the curved dual blades were rarely seen. After several rounds of negotiation, it managed to only fetch a moderate price.

Li Yuanjiao accepted the Spirit Stones with a sigh of relief.

No wonder most Qi Cultivators wield Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts... Fifty Spirit Stones will take an ordinary Qi Cultivator over ten years to save by just gathering qi without active cultivation. If they are actively cultivating, they will also need to buy supplies and rations, which can easily triple or quadruple this period... That's about forty years of savings for a single dharma artifact. How many such forty-year spans does one have in a lifetime?!

He then retrieved a devil cultivator's sledgehammer that he had gotten from Li Qinghong from his storage pouch. This inferior Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifact was worth only thirty Spirit Stones. After selling the remainder of the Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts, including Li Qinghong's nine Spirit Stones, Li Yuanjiao managed to amass nearly a total of a hundred Spirit Stones.

With Minor Pure Spiritual Qi being both cheap and rare here, Li Yuanjiao decided to keep it for now. Chen Donghe pushed six Spirit Stones into Li Yuanjiao's hands, rounding out the majority of the sum, leaving just over a dozen Spirit Stones unaccounted for.

Xizhi's letter mentioned that Yuan Tuan could provide some Spirit Stones, but relying on a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator's favors for just a few stones really isn't worth it.

Having gathered all their items, the two exited the market and flew across the vast desert. Li Yuanjiao hesitated slightly before asking Chen Donghe, "Is there a way to earn Spirit Stones in the desert?"

Chen Donghe pondered briefly before replying, "There are ways, but most would take years, and it's unlikely you could gather more than ten Spirit Stones."

Upon hearing that, Li Yuanjiao could only perish this train of thought. He handed over the few pills in his possession to Chen Donghe, then asked, "Uncle Donghe, how's the progress with the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi?"

"It's about 80% ready," Chen Donghe replied as he pulled a jade bottle from his storage pouch and added, "It'll be ready in another year and a half!"

"Good," Li Yuanjiao acknowledged with a nod of approval, "I'll head back to the clan first. Take care, Uncle Donghe... After some time, I will come find you again."

After exchanging a few parting words and promising to pay respects to Li Tongya on Chen Donghe's behalf, Li Yuanjiao rode away on the wind.

————

The Yu Family of Linghai Prefecture had been a prominent clan for generations. Its descendants pledged allegiance to various immortal peaks within the Azure Pond Sect, often competing fiercely among themselves for power and influence.

In the abandoned city, streets and alleys lay dry and deserted, save for the faint sounds of conversation emanating from the great hall at the city's highest point. Here, a few of the Yu Family's Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators stood in an awkward line.

Historically, the heads of these family branches rarely met, communicating instead through messengers even for internal discussions. Yet this time, they found themselves together in this desolate city, their expressions both a mixture of respect and tension. They were all clad in distinct attire.

At the end of the hall sat a black-robed monk, his belly protruding as if he were six months pregnant. His face, gleaming with grease, shifted between broad grins and labored gasps for breath.

"Are you satisfied, Master Monk?" asked the eldest of the Yu Family, stepping forward with a smile.

"Absolutely! I have no complaints! Your family has always been the most generous... offering up sixteen thousand souls! Truly, the Yu Family possesses the greatest wisdom in not clinging to mortal coils," Murong Xia responded with a huge grin.

"Hahaha! I'm glad to hear that, Master Monk!"

The old master of the Yu Family laughed as a gust of wind swept through the empty streets, a sense of satisfaction welling within him.

This one is about to become a Maha! Without the exchange of interests between the immortals and the Buddhists, how could the Yu Family have ever connected with such a powerful figure? Now is the perfect opportunity to earn his favor before he attains the Maha status!

With a broad, obliging smile, he continued with forced sweetness, "Is this city sufficient for you, Master Monk? If not, I can find more people of great virtue and wash them well before sending them into your belly for a good time!"

The monk, half reclining on a grand golden seat, hummed a few notes. His protruding belly was exposed, and it was visibly marked with blue and purple veins.

He simply laughed off the offer.

"No need... no need! I've already gathered 106,756 people... Any more, and they might rupture my blessed land."

He winced, grappling with the discomfort in his belly briefly. After several labored breaths, he added with a broad grin, "Since embracing the Virtuous Benevolence Zen Dao, I've abandoned The Merciful One's feeble ways... Now, having realized the way, I will soon ascend to Maha! Then, I shall reclaim the cultivation of my previous lives and reach even greater heights!"

Murong Xia was the Master Monk who had once passed through the Li Family's territory over a decade ago. While traveling and consuming humans, he eventually found himself in Linghai Prefecture. Sitting in the golden seat with his swollen belly, he smacked his lips and proclaimed loudly, "This old monk is about to be enlightened... This old monk is about to be enlightened!"

Those from the Yu Family naturally began congratulating him. Blood began flowing out from Murong Xia's lower body. He flipped over as if trying to adjust his posture before exclaiming suddenly, "ALAS!"

BOOM!

His enormous belly burst open, emitting a strange fragrance and radiating bursts of colorful light. The sounds of whistling wind, a pleasant melody, and the laughter of men, women, and children erupted powerfully from within him.

From the bloody remains of his body, a baby emerged from Murong Xia's stomach. He rapidly aged into a seventeen or eighteen-year-old figure with an androgynous and serene face. He had fourteen arms, each wielding a dharma artifact.

As he moved, shimmery golden powder fell from his body, instantly transforming into animated figures that scurried about in excitement.

The Yu Family, witnessing this surreal scene, recoiled in horror with their eyes wide open in shock. The androgynous being picked up Murong Xia's lifeless torso and consumed it as if it were a cucumber, devouring it in just four or five bites.

"Delicious."

Blood trickled from the corner of the Maha's mouth as his figure began to swell dramatically. In mere moments, he had grown to the size of a hill, his massive form blotting out the sun. As he towered over houses and cities, crushing them beneath his feet, he parted his lips slightly and spoke in a soft, mysterious voice.

"I, Murong Xia, have today attained enlightenment as the Ninth Maha Reincarnate. I have connected with the Six Paths of Compassion World View and gained great divine ability... In seven days, I invite all fellow cultivators to join me at the religious assembly..."

His voice rippled through the air smoothly like water, garnering echoes of congratulations. Cultivators from various sects in the north and south voiced their praises as Murong Xia stood silent and proud in Linghai Prefecture.

Murong Xia moved his gaze and was about to say something when the void before him suddenly tore open. A man in white emerged, cradling a sword and regarding him silently.

His face, obscured by mist, remained unseen, halting Murong Xia's attempt to speak immediately. The celebratory sounds vanished too, leaving only a deadly silence around them.

"S-Shangyuan..."

A flicker of fear crossed Murong Xia's androgynous, compassionate face, and he lowered his fourteen slender arms.

Daoist Master Shangyuan, clutching his sword, stared coldly at him and gave a simple command.

"Return to Yan State."

Arrogance immediately left Murong Xia's face as he looked visibly deflated. He shrank until his body became the size of a normal human again before he quickly scurried off into the void and vanished without a word.

The remaining Yu Family members were still kneeling in terror. They watched as Daoist Master Shangyuan also disappeared into the void without sparing them a single glance, leaving behind an empty city marked only by two large footprints.

Phew!

The Yu Family members wiped the sweat from their foreheads, exchanged glances with each other, and then snorted coldly before dispersing.

————

Meanwhile on Mount Yuting...

Li Qinghong had said her farewells to Li Yuanjiao before settling into a period of cultivation on Mount Yuting. However, she soon felt the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow within her becoming restless. With frustration in her heart, her progress was slowed.

"How could this be...?"

She set her spear down horizontally, her brow furrowed in deep thought.

Could it be that a devil cultivator has trespassed on my grounds, or perhaps there is a disturbance in the blood qi that has affected my talisman qi...? It might also be that I haven't had a proper fight in too long... All these years, the battles have been swift, decided within a few moves.

Li Qinghong was not one for a peaceful life of quiet cultivation; she thrived in the heat of battle, only making progress when her spear was stained with blood. Now, having spent nearly a decade on Mount Yuting, practicing sporadically, her progress had naturally begun to slow down.

After offending that demonic creature, I dare not enter Mount Dali recklessly. The demons in Moongaze Lake lurk in its dark undercurrents, elusive and well-hidden...

She missed her family, but knowing she could not venture far, Li Qinghong decided to settle on Mount Yuting. Cradling her spear, she watched the sunrise silently. Suddenly, her thoughts were interrupted by a loud noise and the crunching of snow underfoot.

"Auntie!"

Li Xijun approached, walking on the snow. He cupped his fist respectfully and said, "There's a monk by the lake, and he has constructed a hut at the mountain's base to meditate."

"A monk..?"

Li Tongya's incident had left Li Qinghong with a deep-seated hatred for monks. She frowned immediately, gripping her spear tightly as she asked in a cold voice, "What is his cultivation realm?"

"Appears to be just a monk," Li Xijun replied, raising an eyebrow with concern, fearing his aunt's impulsiveness.

He quickly added, "Auntie, this person traveled south under the guise of a mere monk, so he must have powerful backing... Please exercise caution and avoid unnecessary risks."

"I know," Li Qinghong replied, her almond eyes narrowing as she clutched her spear.

"Yet, we cannot allow him to stay at the base of our mountain. What if he is lying in wait for Brother Jiao's return? Send someone to inquire why this bald cur has come," she instructed.
𝑓𝓇𝘦ℯ𝘸𝘦𝑏𝓃𝑜𝘷ℯ𝑙.𝑐𝑜𝓂

After a brief pause, she continued, "Ensure that those at Lijing are aware of the situation... and ready to act anytime to suppress this threat."

"The Family Head has been informed," Li Xijun replied with a nod.

Together, they approached the formation plate. Li Qinghong reached out with her delicate hand and pressed on it, sending her spiritual sense through the device to survey the surroundings. As expected, she found a monk seated amidst the grass at the foot of the mountain.

The monk was clad in a brown robe with wide sleeves, his head marked with ordination scars. His face was round and his features were unassuming, though not unattractive.

He sat cross-legged with a bronze-ringed monk staff resting on his knees, his eyes firmly shut.

After Li Xijun issued instructions, the formation soon stirred slightly. An Siwei approached warily with a spear in hand and said softly, "I am An Siwei of the Li Family... Venerable monk, what brings you from afar? Do you have any questions?"

The monk opened his small eyes and replied, "I am Kongheng of the Liao River Temple in Yan State... I wish to meet with the peak master of Yuting. Could you kindly convey my request?"

An Siwei, having received Li Xijun's instruction before descending the mountain, nodded and inquired, "May I know what you would like to find out, Master Kongheng? At least, that will make it easier for me to relay it to the peak master."

Kongheng paused gently before replying, "I come with no ill intentions. My journey is merely dictated by the path of Buddhism and the workings of fate, thus I have traveled far to wait here for the peak master."

An Siwei, unable to return empty-handed, pressed further, but the monk's replies circled back to his initial statement. Reluctantly, he returned up the mountain to report his words.

Li Qinghong, typically wary of Buddhist cultivators, shook her head upon hearing this and said, "We know nothing of this monk's background, and it wouldn't be right to kill him outright... Let him wait if he so wishes. Additionally, send someone to the Xiao Family to inquire about this Liao River Temple."

The two boys departed right away to carry out her orders. Li Qinghong, finding her cultivation progress stalling, retrieved the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique manual and began studying two of the secret techniques in it.

After several days of studies, An Siwei returned, bearing his spear and speaking gravely.

"Peak master, this monk initially claimed to be treating ailments. However, the townspeople, still traumatized by Murong Xia, have ignored him. Undeterred, he has now settled in a hut at the mountain's base, continuing his cultivation alone!"

Li Qinghong set aside her jade slip and asked softly, "What did the Xiao Family say?"




# Chapter 421: Ambushed By Devil Cultivators

"The Xiao Family has sent a letter."

An Siwei respectfully presented a small, light green envelope with both hands.

Li Qinghong took it, noting that the letter was as soft as cloth or silk rather than ordinary paper.

To think that they use some kind of spirit cloth for letters... The Xiao Family truly lives up to their reputation as an immortal clan.

An Siwei bowed before withdrawing. Li Qinghong unfolded the letter and read the first line.

"From Guitu: The Liao River is situated in the Liao of northern Yan. The Xiao Family knows little about it and the Liao River Temple is unknown to us. We only know that Liao is a cold and harsh place, where Buddhism cultivation began long ago. Many ascetic cultivators reside there, and the sutras are strictly guarded. Cultivators are often denied access, but there are no notable figures wielding divine abilities. Nowadays, Buddhist cultivators practice the Seven Dharma Forms, which differ significantly from the ways of Liao."

"Northern Yan..."

Li Qinghong put the letter away and ran her fingers along the handle of her spear with a contemplative expression. Suddenly, she detected a fluctuation from the grand formation. A black-clad man appeared and landed on the mountaintop swiftly.

"Qinghong."

"Big Brother!"

Seeing Li Yuanjiao descend, Li Qinghong knew he must have brought the mirror with him. She then handed over the letter, which Li Yuanjiao read with a serious expression. After a moment, he said softly, "Let's descend the mountain to meet him."

Two figures flew out of the grand formation and saw a monk carrying a piece of redwood, splitting it into several pieces with his bare hands before smoothing them, sending wood shavings flying into the wind.

A man clad in black and a beautiful woman landed at the foot of the mountain. The man appeared somber, while the woman in white exuded a commanding presence. Kongheng immediately set the redwood down and rose to his feet.

"Kongheng greets Daoists!"

"I am Li Yuanjiao. I'll gladly answer any questions you have, Master Monk," Li Yuanjiao replied with a calm demeanor.

Kongheng bowed and replied, "I am not fit to be called a Master Monk... Nevertheless, I am simply passing by and wish to stay here for a while, as a guest cultivator."

Li Yuanjiao smiled and observed Kongheng's serene and clear eyes before refusing politely, "I'm afraid that my modest home is ill-suited to accommodate an esteemed monk like yourself from a grand temple. To the east, half a month's journey away, is the Xiao Residence, home to an immortal clan. Perhaps you might consider visiting them?"

Kongheng shook his head helplessly and responded, "I wish to cultivate in your family's territory for a while. If there's anything I can do, please let me know, Daoist."

Li Yuanjiao was slightly taken aback by Kongheng's insistence on staying despite his suggestion. Behind him, Li Qinghong raised an eyebrow and asked, "How can my family possibly agree to allow you to stay if you don't clarify your intentions?"

Her voice was gentle, yet her tone was firm.

Kongheng simply bowed his head.

"I am facing a calamity and must seek refuge with your family. Please rest assured, I do not practice the Seven Dharma Forms..."

His answer was still vague and unclear. Before Li Qinghong and Li Yuanjiao could continue pressing on, a deafening roar echoed through the sky.

Dark clouds of black qi rose from the town, which was accompanied by loud screams. The clouds swiftly moved through the streets and alleyways, and the town was filled with the sounds of malevolent laughter.

Li Yuanjiao felt heat rising in his chest.

His face darkened as he shouted, "Devil cultivators!"

With a swift motion, he drew a talisman from his sleeve and sent it soaring into the sky where it ignited into crimson flames. Instantly, the grand formations on the Li Family's five mountains activated, and multicolored barriers appeared around the mountains.

As he rested his hand on his Qingche Sword, doubts crept into his mind. He briefly glanced at the monk, who was equally astonished, and thought bitterly to himself, Buddhist cultivators are usually so good at divination... Now, as soon as Kongheng arrives, a demon cultivator appears... Could this be a deliberate act? Some kind of scheme..?"

His thoughts were interrupted by a loud, mocking voice.

"Hahaha! You reacted pretty quickly!"

The cloud of devil qi was fast approaching. A rough voice came from the mist, accompanied by a swirling white mist and the indistinct figures of people.

A devil cultivator in black stepped forward. He was a peak Qi Cultivator. He immediately greeted Li Yuanjiao with a palm strike and exclaimed, "Where is Li Xuanxuan? He has certainly made me suffer... Qiu is here to settle the score!"

Having heard about everything that had transpired in the marketplace from Li Xuanxuan, Li Yuanjiao immediately realized the severity of the situation. His heart sank, knowing that this cultivator wielded an unusual and destructive technique that was extremely difficult to deal with.

The Qingche Sword flew from his hand, unleashing a radiant sword arc through the air. The sword qi collided with the white mist, dissipating several of its wisps and forcing them back toward the devil cultivator's face.

"A Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact?!"

Upon seeing his usually invincible spell so easily countered, the devil cultivator was visibly delighted instead of surprised. A greedy glint appeared in his eyes as he shattered the sword qi with his palm strike.

"I suppose sword immortal clans are something else entirely! To think that even a Qi Cultivator can wield a Foundation Establishment dharma artifact... How extravagant!"

As soon as he finished his exclamation, a thunderclap echoed through the air.

Rumble!

Without a word, Li Qinghong had swung her White Iris Spear, unleashing a purple dragon's shadow. Qiu gathered white qi in his hand before delivering a palm strike to the side of the spear, causing a loud explosion.

"Another Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact?!" he exclaimed.

Li Qinghong's face hardened with silent fury, knowing that her younger brother, Li Yuanyun, was killed by this devil cultivator. Her spear moved with lethal precision, delivering a relentless barrage of strikes.

Oblivious to the fact that the mortal he casually killed before was Li Qinghong's younger brother, the devil cultivator surnamed Qiu saw only the deep-seated hatred in the female cultivator's eyes. He neutralized her attacks and looked at her contemptuously.

"Do you really think I'm like those other weaklings practicing the Blood Dharma Manual who only know how to flee but not fight? You think thunder is going to scare me away? I might be afraid if you unleash some sort of spell instead..."

Despite his tough act, he was beginning to feel the pressure from Li Qinghong's relentless assault. With Li Yuanjiao joining the fray, he could only focus on defense for the moment.

However, he did not come here alone. Amidst the swirling smoke, several figures emerged that were all glowing with red and black light. They were laughing loudly, mockingly.

"Master Qiu... are you struggling against these Qi Cultivators of the sixth and seventh heavenly layer?"

One devil Qi Cultivator at the sixth heavenly layer stepped forward with a mocking laugh, holding a dharma artifact that appeared to be a red mirror. After his teasing remark, he simply walked past the three battling cultivators and led his companions toward Mount Yuting.

Mount Yuting's grand formation, left behind by the An Family years ago, was of moderate power in the Qi Cultivation Realm. As the devil cultivators attacked, the surface of the barrier rippled like water.

The group, armed with various tools—a hammer, a mirror, a large shield, and even a rare pagoda—were unable to break through the formation's defenses. Their combined efforts only created ripples on the surface of the formation.

Under the intense pressure from the two attackers, the devil cultivator surnamed Qiu grew increasingly frustrated and cursed, "Damn Zhang Huaide! I'm struggling here, and yet you're busy attacking the formation? Combine your forces to deal with these two first, then we can divide the spoils! Really... How stupid can you be?!"

Zhang Huaide shrugged indifferently and said with a smile, "Boss, give me a moment to break this formation, and then I'll come back to help you!"

Devil cultivators were often driven by greed. Seeing Mount Yuting as a tempting prize, they were naturally eager to take advantage of the situation, striking first to loot the place while Qiu was kept busy by the two cultivators.

Although Li Chejing and Li Tongya are dead, the Li Family might still have hidden tricks up their sleeves.

Zhang Huaide thought to himself with a cold smile.

I should just grab a few valuables and go... Wouldn't want to piss those two off too much. If they unleash their divine ability, talisman, dharma sword, or jade token, they could easily crush us like ants!

With his perceptive abilities heightened by his cultivation, Zhang Huaide felt a shiver at the sight of Li Yuanjiao's Qingche Sword. Instinctively, he wanted to retreat and only focused on escaping with whatever he could get.

Just then, several streams of light appeared in the distance, streaking across the sky. Leading them was a man with a shiny bald head clad in leather fur.

"Little devil cultivators, how dare you trespass on my immortal mountain?! Do you wish to get a taste of my immortal sword?!" he yelled.

The man was An Zheyan, a cultivator at the eighth layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Sweat beaded his forehead as his sons, An Siming and An Siwei, were within Mount Yuting's grand formation. Without any hesitation, he unleashed a barrage of spells at the devil cultivator.

Zhang Huaide remained unfazed. With a flick of his hand, he released a blood-colored mana light that easily neutralized An Zheyan's spells.

"How absurd... It seems like you're all talk," he laughed derisively.

Despite An Zheyan's advanced cultivation at the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, Zhang Huaide, at the sixth heavenly layer but armed with the Blood Dharma Manual and numerous secret techniques, proved to be more than a match for him.

Li Xuanxuan, with a grim expression, followed closely behind. Armed with a large ax and at the seventh heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation, his appearance was that of a formidable cultivator from the main lineage. He was accompanied by an elderly monkey at the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Together, they presented a truly formidable and imposing presence indeed.

Li Xuanxuan looked at the devil cultivators below him, initially apprehensive but then smirking as he exchanged a few blows with a devil cultivator of the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

"And here I thought you were a big deal!" he remarked with an arched brow.

The next two streams of light were Tian Zhongqing, Tian Youdao, and Xu Gongming. All three early-stage Qi Cultivators worked together to fend off an early-stage devil cultivator.

Seeing that breaching Yuting was proving difficult, the remaining two devil cultivators decided to abandon the formation and attack Tian Zhongqing and his uncle.

Kongheng, who had been left behind by the crowd, sighed deeply. With a swift motion, he wielded his staff and rode the wind, despite being only a monk. A golden light began pooling in his hands.

"Do not commit any sins of murder, Benefactors!" he boomed.

The staff, adorned with copper rings, whirled and danced at incredible speed, trapping the two devil cultivators instantly. The golden light in his hands radiated brightly.

The two devil cultivators were taken aback and shouted in alarm, "A Master Monk!?"

Unlike immortal cultivators, Buddhist cultivators could only ride the wind when they became Master Monks with strength comparable to that of a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator.

This realization caught the two devil cultivators by surprise, prompting the red glow on their bodies to intensify as they instinctively pulled apart.

Yet, the golden light was suppressing their blood light. The two were startled before realization finally struck them. One of the cultivators, who was wielding a large shield, exclaimed, "And here I was wonderin' why a monk could fly and thought him a Master Monk! Turns out it is a dharma artifact he's wielding!"

The other cultivator, who had a similar face to him, cursed, "Ugh...! You fool! Master told us to speak the official language!"

The loud exchange startled Kongheng, whose tiny eyes widened slightly in surprise as he recognized their accent.

"You're from Zhao State!" he exclaimed.

As the two devil cultivators raised their dharma artifacts and made their move to attack Kongheng, the monk quickly blocked their attacks with his staff. However, the relentless assault of the two cultivators forced him backward.

The shield-bearer urged, "No! A Buddhist enemy we mustn't provoke!"

The other who was wielding a pagoda, silently relented. Despite Kongheng's efforts, he found himself on the defensive, with the situation stalemated.

Zhang Huaide, who heard the entire conversation clearly, let out an exasperated sigh. He muttered in frustration, "Those two worthless fools!"

He was engaged in a fierce battle with An Zheyan, and while Qiu was attacking unrelentingly, he still struggled to shake off his opponents.

Initially uncoordinated due to a lack of opportunity to fight together in the past, Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong gradually found their synergy. Li Qinghong's thunder techniques and Li Yuanjiao's sharp sword qi began to turn the tide in their favor.

The cultivator surnamed Qiu, who relied on a cultivation technique that was most effective against dharma artifacts and flesh, had enjoyed success over the years. However, he was unlucky to run into these Qi Cultivators who wielded Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts. No matter how hard he tried, he could not penetrate their defenses. This left him in a state of great frustration.

He scanned the battlefield, his anxiety easing as he saw that his side had a significant advantage in several areas. With the situation more favorable, he coldly mocked the two opponents he was contending with.

"So what if your dharma artifacts are impressive? Your spear and sword qi are still inferior and can't break my spell!"

As soon as he had finished speaking, three more figures arrived—Xiao Guiluan, Madam Dou, and a guest cultivator, Li Qilang.

Li Qilang, a Qi Cultivator at the third heavenly layer with an honest face, stood behind the women. Xiao Guiluan's phoenix eyes quickly scanned the battlefield and instructed decisively, "Save the Tian Family first!"

Tian Zhongqing and his uncle practiced a subpar cultivation technique and lacked effective dharma artifacts or spells. As a result, they were steadily pushed back by the devil cultivator's particularly powerful attacks, finding themselves in constant danger.

The devil cultivator's hammer struck him hard, causing Tian Zhongqing to cough up blood. His face was flushed red, and his hands trembled uncontrollably. Despite his pain, he managed to utter words of thanks.

With the arrival of three reinforcements, the situation shifted dramatically. Xiao Guiluan, wielding the Xiao Family's Grade Three cultivation technique and her dharma artifact—a silk shawl—made a significant impact on the battle. Through combined efforts, they overwhelmed the devil cultivator, who was now desperately calling for help.

Seeing the situation take a turn for the worse, Zhang Huaide could no longer hold back. He activated a spell, slapping An Zheyan aside, and raised his red mirror high into the air. Concentrating his mana, he made the mirror glow with a fierce red light.

Boom!

A bolt of purple lightning streaked across the sky, disrupting his spell.

Shamoli, who had traveled from Eastern Mount Yue and was now at the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, arrived just in time. Wielding thunder, he joined the fight to support An Zheyan.

Zhang Huaide was thrown into a panic as he saw An Zheyan now supported by a thunder cultivator, whose power was particularly effective against devil cultivators. Just as he was beginning to turn the tide of the battle, this unexpected arrival had made his task even more daunting.

"Zhang Mutong! Move faster!" Zhang Huaide shouted.

Zhang Mutong, a mid-stage Qi devil cultivator, was struggling to keep up with Li Xuanxuan and the old monkey. He frantically unleashed several spells, his frustration evident as blood light flowed chaotically around him.

Despite Li Xuanxuan's dire condition, he managed to hold his ground while spitting out mouthfuls of blood. The devil cultivator, however, was struggling to catch his breath after the old monkey dealt him a heavy blow from behind him. Meanwhile, Zhang Huaide could only watch the entire scene in bewilderment.

Upon seeing the situation stabilizing, Li Qinghong exchanged a glance with her elder brother. Li Yuanjiao immediately understood her intention. He stepped forward with his sword while Li Qinghong performed a hand seal, conjuring a swirl of purple light.

"Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique!"

This was one of the two secret techniques from the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique manual, a technique that had long been forgotten and lost its name. After years of study, Li Qinghong had finally mastered its subtleties and given it a name.

She brought her hands together, gently rubbing them to conjure a rich purple light. She then traced talisman symbols in the air, carefully outlining each character.

Seeing this, the cultivator surnamed Qiu was immediately alarmed. He quickly brought his hands together and unleashed clouds of white qi.

"Shit, this bitch is getting serious! Zhang Huaide, stop hiding and act now!" he yelled frantically.

Zhang Huaide's face grew grim as he adjusted his robe. His sleeves billowed without wind as he summoned a swirling blood-red light from his body. In a deep voice, he commanded, "Fellow Daoists, protect me!"




# Chapter 423: Shattered

When the devil cultivator surnamed Qiu saw Zhang Huaide's pathetic state, he could not help but wonder about the man's true abilities.

The Ancestor Difu sent this person, but I can't tell his purpose here... From the look on the ancestor's face, this guy likely has some background. Perhaps he has some trick up his sleeve!

Gritting his teeth in frustration, the devil cultivator pushed his palms out. White qi surged forth as he tried to resist the thunder talisman Li Qinghong unleashed with a yell. The two attacks collided with a loud noise and Qiu tried forcing it away with all his might.

Li Qinghong's Purple Talisman Origin Light Secret Technique was the highest-grade spell available in the Li Family. Spells and techniques were strictly controlled by the three sects and seven gates, so the Li Family was unable to obtain other secret techniques of comparable quality.

BOOM!

The talisman in front of Qiu exploded. Purple lightning crackled aloud, and white smoke billowed in every direction.

"AHH!"

The devil cultivator cried out in pain, his palms now scorched black. But before he could even catch his breath, a brilliant sword light had emerged from the smoke and dust, heading directly for his neck. The devil cultivator had no choice but to use his hands to defend himself.

His spell was shattered by Li Qinghong's thunder talisman, and the Qingche Sword, a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, flashed with deadly precision, cleanly severing five of his fingers. Blood streamed from the stumps as his eyes burned with rage.

"Damn it, Zhang Huaide! Qiu Ji is getting out of here!" he screamed.
𝘧𝓇𝑒𝑒𝑤ℯ𝑏𝓃𝘰𝑣ℯ𝘭.𝘤ℴ𝘮

The light in Zhang Huaide's hand continued to intensify. Li Yuanjiao had readied the last remaining Foundation Establishment Realm talisman from his clan in his hand while gripping the Qingche Sword with his other, his gaze fixated on Zhang Huaide.

As Li Yuanjiao's gaze locked onto him, Zhang Huaide felt a sharp pain in the center of his forehead but remained calm and unafraid.

"Pitiful fool! I shall let you witness the true power of a devil cultivator's secret technique!" he declared coldly and arrogantly.

The devil cultivators around him were thrilled, eager for him to strike. Zhang Huaide lifted the red mirror up high. Five jade rings appeared around him as he recited loudly, "By the grace of the Heavens, preaching across ten jungles and the underworld, I call upon the law of the four seas and the great void... The Blood Imperial Void Escape Spell!"

The mirror in his hands flickered as his body transformed into a blood-colored stream of light. It was no larger than a fist, trailing a long red tail as it swiftly moved away.

The field fell silent.

The devil cultivators were too stunned to even utter curses. Among those who had been contemplating escape but were surrounded by the Li Family, the ones most aware of Zhang Huaide's shamelessness reacted the quickest.

Taking advantage of the crowd's distraction, the devil cultivator seized an opening. With his hammer, he shattered the mana shield of Tian Youdao—the weakest among the group—and struck him squarely in the chest.

Crack!

A sickening sound of splintering bone filled the air.

"UNCLE!"

Tian Zhongqing's anguished cry pierced through the chaos.

Qiu Ji's figure blurred as he retreated, enveloped in a blood-red light, moving in a direction different from where Zhang Huaide had vanished.

Of course, Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong were not going to let him escape. They rode the wind and gave chase, not anticipating that Qiu Ji would be heading straight toward Xu Gongming, who was armed with a dharma artifact.

While Xu Gongming was fighting another devil cultivator and saw Qiu Ji approaching, his eyes immediately lit up.

If I can delay him for even a moment, it might earn me some credit!

With that thought in mind, he swung his dharma artifact—the Ebony Saber— in an attempt to intercept Qiu Ji. Unfortunately, since the family had no legacy to help him wield a saber effectively, he could not even manifest proper saber qi.

Qiu Ji, annoyed by the interference, sneered at the audacity of the puny ant whom he could easily crush with a strike of his palm.

"How dare you, vermin!" he roared angrily.

Without hesitation, Qiu Ji unleashed a blast of white qi, which instantly enveloped Xu Gongming's Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifact, shattering it instantly. The white qi also breached his protective mana shield, striking his cheek with devastating force.

As flesh and blood splattered everywhere, Xu Gongming plummeted from midair with a cry, no longer able to maintain his footing. Madam Dou rushed to catch him, attempting to dispel the malevolent qi from his face.

Meanwhile, the Li siblings pressed on, pursuing Qiu Ji. At that moment, An Zheyan, who had received a beating from Zhang Huaide earlier, regained his strength and moved to intercept the hammer-wielding devil cultivator who was in the early stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm.

He had always been close to Tian Youdao. Upon seeing the state he was in, An Zheyan's rage boiled over as he yelled out in anguish, "SCOUNDREL!"

An Zheyan, at the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, forced the devil cultivator back with a powerful palm strike, gaining an overwhelming advantage. The devil cultivator spat out blood at the impact, now too disoriented to even take flight.

BOOM!

The combined efforts of the group quickly overwhelmed the devil cultivator. They battered him into a bloody mess and incinerated him with a barrage of fire spells, reducing him to a charred heap.

Tian Zhongqing had already descended to his uncle's side. Tian Youdao's bloody chest was no longer moving, and was lying on the ground with a pallid face.

The hammer had struck him squarely in the chest, causing his eyes to bulge and the area around them to turn purple. He had also broken several bones when he plummeted from the sky and hit the ground with extreme force. The once venerable old man now lay limp and paralyzed in his nephew's arms, blood staining the ground all around him.

On the other side, one of the people fighting Kongheng shouted, "Hey, Zhang has fled!"

"Damn it, let's retreat too!"

These two brothers, who had been fighting Kongheng half-heartedly, quickly apologized to him before also escaping.

The last devil cultivator, Zhang Mutong, faced the worst fate. The blood wind he summoned was instantly shattered by Shamoli's lightning, and he was not as powerful as Qiu Ji and so failed to take flight several times. The members of the Li Family closed in on him and brandished their dharma artifacts fiercely.

All sorts of dharma artifacts and spells rained down on him instantly. His red-glazed beads deflected some attacks, but Shamoli's persistent strikes kept disrupting his blood wind, preventing his escape.

Zhang Mutong endured a few more breaths than the other devil Qi Cultivators. In his desperate struggle, he managed to injure a few more people before finally being dismembered. After being incinerated by fire and struck by lightning, he was completely dead.

As the situation settled, Li Yuanjiao and his sister returned as well. However, Li Yuanjiao looked pretty upset to have come back empty-handed.

Qiu Ji had been incredibly ruthless, using every secret spell at his disposal to escape. Despite their River Crossing Torrential Step, which was adept at evasion, it proved less effective against Qiu Ji's relentless escape tactics. Even with their skills, they struggled to find a way to secure his capture.

As they strayed further and further away from home, they eventually had to give up and turn back, fearing that the enemy would lead them into a trap.

"My lord..."

Among the injured, Li Xuanxuan and Tian Zhongqing fared worse, but Li Xuanxuan was doing slightly better since he had the support of his monkey. Tian Zhongqing, however, held Tian Youdao's corpse with tears streaming down his face.

Xu Gongming had lost consciousness. Half of his face was reduced to exposed bone, presenting a truly horrifying sight. Despite the severe disfigurement, he sustained no further serious injuries. His dharma artifact had absorbed much of the attack's force, which was already weakened in the first place due to Qiu Ji's injuries.

Among the guest cultivators, Li Qilang and An Zheyan were the least injured and were tending to the others on-site. Madam Dou cradled Li Xuanxuan, who appeared extremely aged, in her arms. At that moment, they looked like father and daughter instead.

While everyone was tending to their wounds, Xiao Guiluan approached her husband and announced softly, "Elder Tian has fallen."

Li Yuanjiao tightened his grip on the Foundation Establishment Realm talisman in his sleeve as he watched Granduncle Tian lying lifelessly on the ground. Standing with his sword in hand, he could not bear to look at Tian Zhongqing's pained expression and sent Li Qinghong to console him instead.

About an hour later, as the sky began to dim, Li Qilang handed two storage pouches to Li Yuanjiao, and then approached Tian Zhongqing to offer a few words of comfort before leaving him to grieve in silence.

Kongheng approached silently with his staff, the copper rings on it jingling with each step he took. Li Yuanjiao, overwhelmed with complex emotions and still grappling with his own suspicions, lowered his gaze.

"Many thanks for your help, monk."

Kongheng shook his head slightly, then walked over to Tian Youdao's limp body. He quietly recited a few sutra verses, as if offering a blessing for the deceased.

However, Tian Zhongqing suddenly raised his head and let out a loud wail.

"Go away, bald donkey! Nothing good happens when you guys are around!" he shouted in anguish.

However, Kongheng remained unruffled. He retreated a few steps, then addressed Li Yuanjiao warmly, "I will be cultivating at the little island near the lake. If your esteemed clan needs anything, they may come find me there."

With that said, he rode the wind and swiftly departed. The remaining people began taking their leave too as the hues of the crimson sunset and the blood-stained ground overlapped with each other. Li Qinghong offered a few more words of comfort to Tian Zhongqing who then picked up Tian Youdao's body, and apologized to Li Yuanjiao before he left.

In the forest, only the core members of the Li Family remained.

Li Yuanjiao stood alone. Li Xuanxuan coughed slightly before wiping the trail of blood from the corner of his mouth.

"There is no fault in choosing and weighing the costs..."

Li Yuanjiao nodded slowly, gripping the green and white Qingche Sword tightly.

"I understand. As I hold this sword, it is only right that I prioritize the clan's interests above all else, even if it means bearing dirt and grudges."

————

Tian Youdao, younger brother to Tian Yun, was Li Xuanfeng and Li Jingtian's uncle. He was an elder of significant status in the Li Family and one of the few who had broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm. His death at the hands of the devil cultivators was a significant loss.

The funeral ceremony was simple. Apart from the immediate Li and Tian families, the other guests showed little grief and some even felt a sense of relief.

The battle had killed two devil cultivators, one of whom was a mid-stage Qi Cultivator. Naturally, the Qi Cultivators in the family were too excited by the prospects of the spoils to be mourning at the moment.

Meanwhile at the central hall in Lijing Town, where the head of the Li Family, Li Yuanping, who handled the family affairs, also served as the center of the Li Family's secular power. Originally magnificent, the hall now showed its age, with worn bricks on the steps visibly marking the passage of time.

Since the Li Family had been accused of indulgence and luxury, Li Yuanping had not made any attempts to repair the building and simply used it as it was. Today, it was Li Yuanjiao who occupied the seat, all dressed in white, with two storage pouches before him.

An ordinary Qi Cultivator typically carried only about ten Spirit Stones on them, with a net worth ranging from thirty to forty stones. However, they had seized a total of forty-six Spirit Stones from these two devil cultivators alone. Even the Li Family would struggle to produce this amount of wealth within such a short time.

Of the eleven cultivators who participated in the battle, five were direct family members. Xu Gongming and Tian Zhongqing, both at the early stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm and severely injured, earned three Spirit Stones for contributing the most. Li Qilang received two.

The old monkey and Shamoli, who were at the mid-stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, acquired two Spirit Stones each. An Zheyan, at the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, received six. Ten more were allocated as Tian Youdao's death gratuity, and the remaining eighteen were confiscated.

The external guest cultivators eagerly stepped forward to receive their share. Xu Gongming, disfigured and concealing his appearance with a mask, smiled despite his condition.

When Tian Zhongqing approached to claim the substantial sum of thirteen Spirit Stones, Li Yuanjiao personally gave him a few bottles of medicine and asked him softly, "With Grand Uncle's passing, is this gratuity received by Tian Rong, his only son?"

Tian Zhongqing, having already composed himself, quickly responded in a respectful manner.

"Old Master, Tian Rong has always tended to mistreat maidservants... During the mourning period, he became heavily intoxicated and was secretly killed by several maidservants with a hairpin in the dead of night. It seems this sum will likely be claimed by the eldest and legitimate grandson, Tian Ling."

"Oh."

The external guest cultivators showed no surprise. Tian Youdao's only son was considered a disappointment; he not only lacked good judgment but also got into conflicts with multiple families. Even the king of Mount Yue, Li Jiman, harbored deep disdain for him. It was Tian Youdao's deep affection for his son that led him to protect him at all costs.

Now that Tian Youdao had been dead for half a month, any discussion of his death was overshadowed by the good karma he had accumulated during his lifetime. Whether his death was disgraceful or not was of little concern, and even Tian Zhongqing himself showed no interest in determining who was responsible.

Li Yuanjiao stroked his beard and sighed.

"Since Granduncle is no longer around and has left behind this orphan, we will send him to the mountains for cultivation. From now on, the responsibility for his training will fall under the main family."

"Understood!"

Tian Zhongqing bowed and the guest cultivators began to withdraw, heading toward the town's tavern amidst their happy chatters.

Li Qinghong, who was observing the situation, realized that Li Yuanjiao's actions and compensation were also a form of a test. "I need to send someone west to inform Aunt Jingtian," she said, feeling somewhat disheartened.

"I've already done that," Li Yuanjiao replied, dismissing the blood qi, resentment qi, and cultivation technique on his desk. He picked up the hammer and the glazed beads, both of which were low-grade Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts. The hammer was unremarkable and could be sold off easily.

"This string of red glazed beads is a valuable dharma artifact... The runes within are quite profound; they can release mana light for protection. It'll be useful for the juniors," he remarked thoughtfully.

With a flick of his wrist, a red light was released from the beads, which was accompanied by a flowing neutralizing force. Li Yuanjiao assessed its power and determined it could neutralize most early-stage Qi Cultivation Realm spells.

"How about calling it..." Li Yuanjiao mumbled as he began thinking of a name for it.

Li Qinghong, concerned that he might come up with something uncreative like Red Light Beads or Crimson Light Beads, quickly interjected with a smile.

"I see that the beads are made of Rouge Glaze. They share the hue of dusk and hold all sorts of runes in them... Why not name it Glazed Dusk?"

Li Yuanjiao thought for a moment, then nodded in agreement.

"Good. Send it to Xijun."

The remaining items were mostly spirit items and Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts of unknown origins, and likely plundered from others. Altogether, they were worth about ten Spirit Stones. Since Li Yuanjiao had recently sold a batch of spirit items and dharma artifacts in the family vault, these truly helped.

Combining all the Spirit Stones he had gathered, Li Yuanjiao finally accumulated one hundred and twenty pieces together. He handed them to Li Qinghong with a sigh of relief.

"Please take these to the Yuan Family, sister."

Li Qinghong nodded. Li Yuanjiao hesitated briefly before taking out the bluish-gray mirror which he handed over respectfully. He then retrieved the Foundation Establishment Realm talisman and continued, "I'm worried that Zhang Huaide and Qiu Ji might still be plotting against us and could ambush you on the road... It would be better for you to make the trip with the mirror, just in case."

As he watched Li Qinghong depart on the wind, Li Yuanjiao took a deep breath. Counting the days, he took out a Jade Sprout Pill and murmured quietly to himself.

"It's time to cultivate in seclusion and break through to the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm..."

Upon riding the wind and returning to Mount Wutu, he saw Xiao Guiluan standing in the courtyard, smiling and gazing at him. Li Yuanjiao was puzzled but did not expect to see her phoenix eyes crinkle up as she said warmly, "It's time for you to think of a name again!"

Having been husband and wife for many years, they shared a deep bond and understood each other well without words. Seeing Xiao Guiluan caressing her tummy, realization immediately dawned upon Li Yuanjiao.

"WHAT?!"

He was both astonished and delighted. They already had a son when he was an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator, and now that they were both Qi Cultivators, the chances of having a child were even slimmer. He never expected much while bedding his wife, treating it as a way to bond with her.
𝘧𝑟𝑒𝑒𝘸𝘦𝘣𝑛𝑜𝘷𝑒𝓁.𝘤𝘰𝓂

Xiao Guiluan's unexpected pregnancy was joyous news to him. Laughing heartily, he kissed his wife and replied, "I wonder if it's going to be a boy or a girl... This child is truly a late arrival!"

After spending a tender moment together, Li Yuanjiao focused on preparing for his breakthrough.
